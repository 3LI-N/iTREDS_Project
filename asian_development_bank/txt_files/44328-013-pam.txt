PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
A.  
Rationale 
The  project  will  help  the  Government  of  Cambodia  increase  agricultural  production  by 
1. 
rehabilitating, modernizing, and climate-proofing selected irrigation systems in Kampong Thom 
and  Battambang  provinces.  Subprojects  will  be  undertaken  to  (i)  enhance  the  efficiency  and 
climate resilience of irrigation systems, and (ii) improve water resource management by building 
the  capacity  of  government  agencies  and  of  farmer  water  user  communities  (FWUCs)  so  that 
they  can  operate  and  manage  the  irrigation  systems  better.  The  project  will  contribute  to 
achieving  targets  of  the  Government’s  Rectangular  Strategy  on  Growth,  Employment,  Equity 
and Efficiency 2014–2018. The strategy aims to develop and expand the country’s irrigated land 
and  manage  its  water  resources  more  effectively  by  improving  existing  irrigation  systems, 
making water user communities more efficient, and reducing the vulnerability of the Cambodia’s 
people to disasters caused by natural hazards.   
B. 
Impact and Outcome 
2. 
The  impact  will  be  inclusive  economic  growth  through  agriculture  and  irrigation,  in  line 
with  phase  3  of  the  government’s  Rectangular  Strategy  on  Growth,  Employment,  Equity,  and 
Efficiency  for  2014–2018.  The  outcome  will  be  water  and  agriculture  productivity  enhanced  in 
the project areas. 
C. 
Outputs 
3. 
Output  1:  Enhanced  efficiency  and  climate resilience  of  irrigation  systems  in  the 
project areas. The project will support rehabilitation, modernization, and climate proofing of at 
least  three  irrigation  systems  to  increase  the  cultivated  area  in  the  project  areas  in  Kampong 
Thom  and Battambang provinces  to  29,500  ha.1 It  will  (i)  rehabilitate the undersluices  and  the 
spillway of the Taing Krasaing headworks, 22-kilometers (km) main Taing Krasaing canal, and 
48.0  km  of  secondary  and  tertiary  canals;  (ii)  install  a  pumping  system  and  associated 
distribution channels to lift water by a maximum of 3 meters for 2,960 ha of developed rain-fed 
land  in  the  Taing  Krasaing  system  command  area;  (iii)  rehabilitate  the  Prek  Chik  headworks 
(including  raising  the  spillway  by  1.5  meters),  28-km  main  Prek  Chik  canal,  and  70.2  km  of 
secondary  and  tertiary  canals  to  cover  10,400  ha  net  irrigated  area;  (iv)  install  structures  and 
gauges for water measurement, control, and distribution on the Taing Krasaing and Prek Chik 
system’s  main  and  distribution  canals;  (v)  improve  drainage  facilities  for  1,800  ha  to  climate 
proof  the  irrigation  facilities  against  floods;  (vi)  carry  out  laser  land  leveling  of  2,000  ha;  (vii) 
improve 21,000 ha of land through irrigation, drainage, and/or flood protection; and (viii) conduct 
feasibility studies, design, and improvement works for the O Kra Nahk irrigation system serving 
about 1,500 ha in Kampong Thom province, and other noncore subprojects.2 
4. 
Output  2:  Improved  water  resource  management.  The  project  will  organize  FWUCs 
and  provide  gender-inclusive  training  to  FWUC  members  on  (i)  O&M  of  canals,  (ii)  
management  of  FWUCs,  (iii)  issues  related  to  climate  variability  and  change,  and  (iv)  water 
management.  It  will  also  involve  them  in  the  design  and  implementation  of  subprojects.  It  will 
1  Feasibility  studies  have  been  completed  for  the  Taing  Kraisang  and  Prek  Chik  irrigation  systems.  The  feasibility 
study for the O Kra Nahk irrigation system will be carried out during project implementation.  
2  If  savings  remain  from  the  loan  proceeds  after  awarding  the  contracts  for  the  three  identified  subprojects,  the 
project may finance more subprojects. 
2 
install  hydrometeorological  stations  in  the  watersheds  and  establish  canal  flow  measurement 
systems.  The  project  will  train  staff  of  the  Ministry  of  Water  Resources  and  Meteorology 
(MOWRAM), MOWRAM’s Department of Farmer Water User Communities (DFWUC), provincial 
departments of water resources and meteorology (PDWRAMs), the FWUCs, and the MAFF on 
(i)  modern  canal  operation  techniques,  (ii)  irrigation  scheduling,  (iii)  watershed  management, 
and (iv) water management. It will also strengthen their awareness of climate resilience in water 
resource  management.  The  project  will  modernize  canal  operations,  undertake  irrigation 
scheduling,  and  integrate  the  scheduling  with  the  canal  flow  gauging  system  to  manage 
supplies,  particularly  during  droughts.  It  will  also  design  joint  reservoir  operations for  (i)  Stung 
Chinit and Taing Krasaing reservoirs in Kampong Thom, and (ii) Bassac and Dauntri reservoirs 
in  Battambang.  This  will  improve  water-sharing  arrangements  between  linked  systems  and 
ensure equitable distribution, particularly during droughts.

Implementation Procedures  
7. 
The core subproject Taing Krasaing main canal is designed and ready for bidding. The 
feasibility studies of Taing Krasaing in Kampong Thom province and Prek Chik in Battambang 
province have been done. Detailed designs of both main canals are ready for bidding. Bidding 
of Taing Krasaing main canal will be started before loan effectiveness but Prek Chik main canal 
bids  will  be  invited  after  water  availability  study  of  Bassac  reservoir  is  completed.  Detailed 
engineering  design  of  distribution  system  of  both  irrigation  systems  will  be  done  by  the  PMIC 
canal systems in phases. After completion of design of each phase, the contract for construction 
will  be  awarded  by  the  PMU.  FWUCs  will  be  formed  and  trained  and  involved  in  the  design 
process. Feasibility study of O Kra Nahk irrigation system in Kampong Thom province and other 
non-core subprojects will be carried out by the PMIC. The subprojects will be assessed on the 
following selection criteria before making final decision for investments.

IV. 
COSTS AND FINANCING 
11. 
The  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $66.12  million.  The  Government  has  requested  a 
loan  of  SDR43,121,000  [$60.0  million  equivalent]  in  various  currencies  from  ADB’s  Special 
Funds Resources (ADF) to help finance the project. The loan will have a 32-year term, including 
a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% 
per annum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. 
The  ADB  loan  represents  90.7%  of  total  project  costs.  It  will  be  utilized  for  civil  works, 
12. 
hydrometeorology  equipment,  vehicles,  office  equipment,  furniture,  consulting  services,  and 
incremental  operating  cost.  The  government  will  also  borrow  for  financing  charges  during 
implementation.  ADB  will  finance  taxes  and  duties  on  ADB  financed  expenditures  except  civil 
works. 
13. 
The Government will finance the equivalent of $6.12 million (9.3% of total project costs), 
from the central government budget allocations.  The Government counterpart funds will be for 
(i) salaries of government staff working for the project, (ii) land acquisition and resettlement, and 
(iii) taxes and duties on civil works through exemption.

FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT 
A.  Financial Management Assessment 
16. 
The financial management assessment (FMA) report (Supplementary Document 17) was 
prepared  in  accordance  with  the  FMA  technical  guidance  note  (ADB,  2015).  It  was  initially 
updated  by  a consultant, from the  FMA  done  by  the  MOWRAM  in 20143   and finalized  by  the 
ADB’s  Senior  Financial  Management  Specialist,  during  a  fact-finding  mission,  from  22  to  26 
June  2015.  This  FMA  incorporates  the  financial  management  internal  control  and  other  risk 
assessment required by the guidance. It may need to be amended further to reflect subsequent 
developments  and  agreements  during  the  project  implementation.  The  FMA  preparatory 
activities included reviewing documents, interviewing staff of government agencies, consultants, 
beneficiaries and other stakeholders, and completed with inputs from other references through 
desk studies. 
The  purpose  of  this  assessment  was  to  determine  the  robustness  of  the  accounting, 
17. 
financial  controls  and  internal  audit  arrangements,  and  the  capability  of  the  executing  and 
implementing  agencies  to  meet  all  the  fiduciary  requirements  which  are  set  out  in  the  loan 
agreement,  and  other  project  documents.  The  FMA  has  assessed  the  executing  and 
implementing  agencies  and  financial  arrangements,  financial  responsibilities  and  perceived 
financial  risks  and  risk  management.  This  FMA  also  provides  guidance  to  the  executing  and 
implementing  agencies  for  mitigation  measures  to  ensure  the  effective  project  performance, 
following  country  laws  and  regulations  as  well  as  ADB’s  requirements.    The  executing  and 
implementing  agencies  have  worked  in  the  past  with  ADB  and  are  currently  implementing 
several ADB funded projects. MOWRAM is also part of the government’s comprehensive Public 
Financial Management Reform Program (PFMRP) which is being supported by an ADB Grant.4 
The executing agency has the experience and capacity to administer the imprest fund and SOE 
procedures. 
18. 
Summary of the assessment: The FMA overall is rated as “Moderate” and is expected to 
become “Low” with mitigating measures.  General environment for public financial management 
(PFM) in Cambodia is generally satisfactory due to large extent to the standardized policies and 
guidelines  which  are  implemented  for  all  externally  financed  projects  and  programs.  The 
following tables present the risk summary for both inherent- and project risks. 
Table 2: Inherent and Project Risks 
Risk Description 
I. Inherent Risks 
A. Country Specific:  PFM: (i) low 
accountability for public expenditure and 
service delivery; (ii) inadequate

Mitigation Measures 
or Risk Management Plan 
Improve the government’s standard operating 
procedures, procurement manual, and FM 
manual; deliver training on ADB’s guidelines 
and procurement procedures; and continue to 
identify procurement risks and implement 
mitigation measures. 
In coordination with other DPs and NGOs, 
ADB will continue to support the ACU in 
fulfilling its mandate.

including MOWRAM. These rural 
development ministries are being supported in 
budget preparation and execution, financial 
management and accounting, procurement, 
internal audit development, and in monitoring 
and evaluation. 
MOWRAM will require all contractors /bidders, 
suppliers and consultants to sign declarations 
of ethical conduct; strengthen transparency 
through posting project information on the 
executing agency websites; develop complaint 
handling mechanisms; strict monitoring and 
enforcement of procurement procedures and 
contracts; and joint investigation by the NAA 
and the ADB’s Office of Anticorruption and 
Integrity on irregularities. 
Provide  training  on  ADB’s  LDH    for  the 
Finance  Officer  and  her  staff  as  part  of  the

B. 
Disbursement 
 The  Loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  Loan  Disbursement 
20. 
Handbook  (2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time),6  and  detailed  arrangements  agreed  upon 
between  the  Government  and  ADB.  The  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  describes  the 
procedures and provides standard forms for withdrawal of funds. Online training for project staff 
on disbursement policies and procedures is available at: http://wpqr4.adb.org/disbursement_ e-
learning.  Project  staffs  are  encouraged  to  avail  of  this  training  to  help  ensure  efficient 
disbursement and fiduciary control. 
 The following are different financing and disbursement arrangements,7 of ADB Loan i.e. 
21. 
through  direct  payment  by  ADB,  reimbursement,  imprest  fund  procedures,  liquidation  and 
replenishment,  and  the  statement  of  expenditures  (SOEs).  DFWUC  in  MOWRAM  will  be 
responsible  for  (i)  preparing  contract  awards  and  disbursement  projections,  (ii)  requesting 
budgetary  allocations  for  counterpart  funds,  (iii)  collecting  supporting  documents,  and  (iv) 
preparing and sending withdrawal applications to ADB. 
22. 
Immediately  after  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government,  through  MEF,  will  open  a  US 
dollar ($) imprest account at the National Bank of Cambodia or a commercial bank  exclusive for 
the  project  loan. The  imprest  account  will  be  opened  and managed  by  MOWRAM,  as follows: 
imprest  account  for  ADB  –  MEF  will  be  the  account  holder,  and  delegates  the  authority  to 
DFWUC in MOWRAM, the authorized party. The imprest account is to be used exclusively for 
ADB’s share of eligible expenditures. The executing agency is accountable and responsible for 
proper  use  of  advances  to  the  imprest  account.  The  executing  agency  will  request  initial  and 
additional  advances  from  ADB  based  on  its  estimate  of  ADB’s  share  of  eligible  project 
expenditures for the forthcoming six months which are to be paid through the imprest account. 
The total outstanding advance to the imprest accounts will not at any time exceed the estimated 
ADB expenditures to be paid from the imprest account for the next six months. 
23. 
The  request  for  initial  advance  to  the  imprest  account  should  be  accompanied  by  an 
Estimate  of  Expenditure  Sheet8  setting  out  the  estimated  expenditures  for  the  first  six  (6) 
months  of  project  implementation,  and  submission  of  evidence  satisfactory  to  ADB  that  the 
imprest account has been duly opened.  For every liquidation and replenishment request of the 
imprest  account,  the  borrower  will  furnish  to  ADB  (a)  Statement  of  Account  (Bank  Statement) 
where the imprest account is maintained, and (b) the Imprest Account Reconciliation Statement 
(IARS)  reconciling  the  above  mentioned  bank  statement  against  the  executing  agency’s 
records.9 
24. 
Statement  of  Expenditure  (SOE)  Procedure.  The  SOE  procedure  may  be  used  for 
reimbursement and to liquidate and replenish the imprest account for eligible expenditures. Any 
individual  payment  to  be  reimbursed  or  liquidated  under  this  procedure  shall  not  exceed  the 
equivalent of $50,000 for the implementing agency. Reimbursement and liquidation of individual 
payments  in  excess  of  the  SOE  ceiling  should  be  supported  by  full  documentation  when 
submitting  the  withdrawal  application  to  ADB.  SOE  records  should  be  maintained  and  made 
readily available for review by ADB's disbursement and review mission or upon ADB's request 
for submission of supporting documents on a sampling basis, and for independent audit.10 The

after the annual audit of the project. 
25. 
Before the submission of the first withdrawal application, the borrower should submit to 
ADB  sufficient  evidence  of  the  authority  of  the  person(s)  who  will  sign  the  withdrawal 
applications on behalf of the borrower, together with the authenticated specimen signatures of 
each  authorized  person.    The  minimum  value  per  withdrawal  application  is  US$100,000

26. 
Disbursement  and  Liquidation  Procedures  for  Government  Funds.  Withdrawal  of 
government counterpart funds must be carried out in accordance with the government policies 
and procedures (Government’s Financial Management Manual). MOWRAM will be responsible 
for submitting withdrawal applications to MEF. Counterpart funds withdrawal applications should 
be made in accordance with the budget plan agreed between MOWRAM and MEF. Counterpart 
funds may only be  withdrawn for expenditures of the project which are specified in the project 
loan agreements.  
27. 
Key  Internal  Controls.  Withdrawal  applications  must  be  signed  by  an  authorized 
signatory  or  signatories.  Withdrawal  applications  must  be  sequentially  numbered  starting  with 
the number one.  
28. 
Counterpart  Funds  Initial  Advance/Liquidation/Replenishment.  The  PMU  completes  the 
government  withdrawal  application  form  for  the  initial  advance/liquidation/replenishment  of 
counterpart funds and submits to the MEF–Department of Cooperation and Debt Management 
(DCDM).  The  maximum  amount  of  the  advance  of  counterpart  funds  will  be  the  estimated 
expenditures for the first six (6) months of project implementation. The government withdrawal 
application form must be signed by the authorized signatories of MOWRAM/PMU and submitted 
to  the  MEF-DCDM.  The  government  withdrawal  application  must  be  recorded  in  the  project 
counterpart funds withdrawal application register. 
The  DCDM  reviews  the  completed  forms  and  in  conjunction  with  the  General

Department of National Treasury (GDNT) transfers the funds to the project’s Counterpart Funds 
Imprest Account and advises MOWRAM of the transfer. On receipt of advice from the NBC that 
the funds have been deposited into the Counterpart Funds  Imprest Account, the receipt of the 
funds  should  be  recorded  in  the  general  ledger  and  the  government  WA  register  must  be 
updated.

23 
31.  MOWRAM will cause the detailed consolidated project financial statements to be audited 
in  accordance  with  International  Standards  on  Auditing  and  with  the  Government's  audit 
regulations,  by  an  independent  auditor  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  audited  project  financial 
statements will be submitted in the English language to ADB within six months from the end of 
the fiscal year by the executing agency.  
32. 
The annual audit report for the project accounts will include an audit management letter 
and  audit  opinions  which  cover  (i)  whether the project financial  statements  present  a true  and 
fair  view  or  are  presented  fairly,  in  all  material  respects,  in  accordance  with  the  applicable 
financial reporting framework; (ii) whether loan proceeds were used only for the purposes of the 
project  or  not;  (iii)  the  level  of  compliance  for  each  financial  covenant  contained  in  the  legal 
agreements  for  the  project;  (iv)  use  of  the  imprest  fund  procedure;  and  (v)  the  proper  use  of 
SOE procedure, certifying to the eligibility of those expenditures claimed under SOE procedures 
and  imprest  procedures  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2015,  as 
amended from time to time) and the project documents. 
Compliance  with  financial  reporting  and  auditing  requirements  will  be  monitored  by 
33. 
review  missions  and  during  normal  program  supervision,  and  followed  up  regularly  with  all 
concerned, including the external auditor.  
The  Government,  MOWRAM  and  DFWUC  have  been  made  aware  of  ADB’s  policy  on 
34. 
delayed submission, and the requirements for satisfactory and acceptable quality of the audited 
project  financial  statements.11  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  require  a  change  in  the  auditor  (in  a 
manner consistent with the constitution of the borrower), or for additional support to be provided 
to the auditor, if the audits required are not conducted in a manner satisfactory to ADB, or if the 
audits are substantially delayed. ADB reserves the right to verify the project's financial accounts 
to  confirm  that  the  share  of  ADB’s  financing  is  used  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  policies  and 
procedures.  
35. 
Public  disclosure  of  the  project  financial  statements,  including  the  audit  report  on  the 
project  financial  statements,  will  be  guided  by  ADB’s  Public  Communications  Policy  (2011)12. 
After review, ADB will disclose the project financial statements for the project and the opinion of 
the  auditors  on  the  financial  statements  within  30  days  of  the  date  of  their  receipt  by  posting 
them on ADB’s website. The Audit Management Letter will not be disclosed. 
11 ADB Policy on delayed submission of audited project financial statements:  
•  When  audited  project  financial  statements  are  not  received  by  the  due  date,  ADB  will  write  to  the  executing 
agency  advising  that  (i)  the  audit  documents  are  overdue;  and  (ii)  if  they  are  not  received  within  the  next  six 
months,  requests  for  new  contract  awards  and  disbursement  such  as  new  replenishment  of  imprest  accounts, 
processing of new reimbursement, and issuance of new commitment letters will not be processed. 
•  When audited project financial statements have not been received within 6 months after the due date, ADB will 
withhold  processing  of  requests  for  new  contract  awards  and  disbursement  such  as  new  replenishment  of 
imprest accounts, processing of new reimbursement and issuance of new commitment letters. ADB will (i) inform 
the executing agency of ADB’s actions; and (ii) advise that the loan may be suspended if the audit documents 
are not received within the next six months. 
•  When audited project financial statements have not been received within 12 months after the due date, ADB may 
suspend the loan.

D. National Competitive Bidding 
A. Regulation and Reference Documents 
1. 
The procedures to be followed for national competitive bidding shall be those set forth for the "National 
Competitive Bidding" method in the Government's Procurement Manual issued under Sub-Decree Number 74 
ANKR.BK,  updated  version  dated  22  May  2012  with  the  clarifications  and  modifications  described  in  the 
following paragraphs. These clarifications and modifications are required for compliance with the provisions of 
the Procurement Guidelines. 
For the procurement of ADB financed contracts under National Competitive Bidding (NCB) procedures, 
2. 
the  use  of  harmonized  national  bidding  documents  (NCB  and  National  Shopping)  developed  in  consultation 
with development partners including ADB, is mandatory except where the Government and ADB have agreed 
to amendments to any part of the documents. The Procurement Manual also advises users to check the ADB 
website  from  time  to  time  for  any  update  on  ADB  documents,  which  form  the  basis,  among  others,  of  the 
existing harmonized national bidding documents. 
29 
B. Procurement Procedures 
1. Application 
3. Contract packages subject to National Competitive Bidding procedures will be those identified as such in the 
project  Procurement  Plan.  Any  change  to  the  mode  of  procurement  of  any  procurement  package  in  the 
Procurement  Plan  shall  be  made  through  updating  of  the  Procurement  Plan,  and  only  with  prior  approval  of 
ADB. 
2. Sanctioning 
4.  Bidders  shall  not  be  declared  ineligible  or  prohibited  from  bidding  on  the  basis  of  barring  procedures  or 
sanction lists, except individuals and firms sanctioned by ADB, without prior approval of ADB. 
3. Rejection of all Bids and Rebidding 
5. The Borrower shall not reject all bids and solicit new bids without ADB's prior concurrence. Even when only 
one or a few bids is/are submitted, the bidding process may still be considered valid if the bid was satisfactorily 
advertised and prices are reasonable in comparison to market values. 
4. Advertising 
6. Bidding of NCB contracts shall be advertised on the ADB website via the posting of the Procurement Plan. 
Borrowers have the option of requesting ADB to post specific notices in the ADB website. 
C. Bidding Documents 
5. Use of Bidding Documents 
7.  The  Standard  National  Competitive  Bidding  Documents  provided  with  the  Government's  Procurement 
Manual shall be used to the extent possible both for the master bidding documents and the contract-specific 
bidding documents. The English language version of the procurement  documents shall be submitted for ADB 
review and approval in accordance with agreed review procedures (post and prior review) as indicated in the 
Procurement  Plan.  The  ADB-approved  procurement  documents  will  then  be  used  as  a  model  for  all 
procurement financed by ADB for the project. 
6. Bid Evaluation 
8. Bidders shall not be eliminated from detailed evaluation on the basis of minor, non-substantial deviations. 
30 
9. A bidder shall not be required, as a condition for award of contract, to undertake obligations not specified in 
the bidding documents or otherwise to modify the bid as originally submitted. 
7. Employer's Right to Accept or Reject Any or All Bids 
10. The decision of the Employer to accept or reject any or all bids shall be made in a transparent manner and 
involve an obligation to inform of the grounds for the decision through the bid evaluation report. 
8. ADB Policy Clauses 
11. 
A provision shall be included in all NCB works and goods contracts financed by ADB requiring suppliers 
and contractors to permit ADB to inspect their accounts and records and other documents relating to the bid 
submission and the performance of the contract, and to have them audited by auditors appointed by ADB. 
12. 
A provision shall be included in all bidding documents for NCB works and goods contracts financed by 
ADB stating that the Borrower shall reject a proposal for award if it determines that the bidder recommended 
for award has, directly or through an agent, engaged in corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices in 
competing for the contract in question. 
A provision shall be included in all bidding documents for NCB works and goods contracts financed by 
13.

VII. 
SAFEGUARDS 
The  project  is  categorized  as  environment  category  B  in  accordance  with  ADB‘s 
47. 
Safeguard Policy Statement (SPS) (2009). Details about the procedures to ensure that potential 
environmental impacts are avoided, reduced and mitigated in accordance with ADB SPS (2009) 
and  regulations  from  the  Government  of  Cambodia  can  be  found  in  the  Environmental 
Assessment  and  Review  Framework  (EARF)  (Linked  Document  11).  An  initial  environmental 
examination (IEE) (Linked Document 10) report including an Environmental Management Plan 
(EMP)  was  prepared  for  the  core  subprojects  in  Taing  Krasaing  and  Prek  Chik.  The  EMP 
outlines  the  anticipated  environmental  adverse  impacts  of  the  subproject,  proposed  mitigation 
and  monitoring  measures,  and  roles  and  responsibilities  of  the  executing  and  implementing 
agencies, consultants, and contractors for each measure. 
48. 
Based on the screening for potential environmental impacts and risks, the IEE concluded 
that  the  proposed  core  subprojects  can  be  implemented  in  an  environmentally  acceptable 
manner with the corresponding EMP. For other subprojects to be prepared during the project’s 
implementation,  the  EARF  will  be  followed  for  environmental  assessment  and  an  IEE  of  each 
subproject will be prepared to ensure consistency with ADB’s SPS (2009), and respective EMPs 
will be included in the IEEs and civil works contracts. No category B subproject for environment 
will be selected.  
49. 
The  supervision  and  monitoring  of  environmental  activities  during  the  pre-construction, 
construction  and  operation  phases  are  the  functions  of  the  PMU.  In  line  with  this,  it  is 
appropriate  that  the  position  of  an  Environmental  Management  Officer  (EMO)  be  appointed  in 
the  PMU,  responsible  for  supervision  of  environmental  management  and  for  environmental 
monitoring.  Terms of reference for the EMO positions are at Annex C of the EARF. 
B.  
Involuntary Resettlement 
50. 
A resettlement framework (Linked Document 12) has been prepared to guide subproject 
screening  and  resettlement  planning  and  implementation.  Subprojects  screened  to  involve 
significant  involuntary  resettlement  impacts  (Category  A)  are  not  eligible  under  the  project. 
Should  a  subproject  involve  insignificant  involuntary  resettlement  impacts  (Category  B),  the 
Government  will  prepare  draft  resettlement  plan(s)  in  accordance  with  the  Resettlement 
Framework.  The  Government  will  submit  the  draft  resettlement  plan(s)  to  ADB  for  approval 
during  project  implementation.  After  approval,  the  Government  will  implement  the  RP. 
Construction  can  be  started  only  in  areas  where  compensation  has  been  paid  and  an  income 
restoration program has been put in place.  
C.  
Indigenous Peoples 
51. 
The project is Category C for Indigenous Peoples safeguards. To ensure that the project 
remains in that Category, subprojects will be screened using the form in Appendix 2. As per the 
subproject eligibility criteria, only Category C subprojects (no impact on Indigenous Peoples) are 
eligible for financing under the project. 
35 
VIII.  GENDER AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS 
52. 
The Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (Linked Document 8) identify the 
implementation  of  a  Gender  Action  Plan  (GAP),  a  Stakeholders  Communication  Strategy  and 
measures to address identified social risks. 
53. 
The  project’s  gender  classification  is  “Effective  Gender  Mainstreaming”  (EGM),  which 
means  that  at  least  two  of  the  project  outputs  are  targeted  to  support  women’s  active 
participation,  access to project  benefits  and  information  and empowered through various skills 
development. A Gender Action Plan (GAP) is developed in accordance with the project activities 
and  based  on  the  findings  of  the  gender  assessment  report  (Supplementary  Document  18) 
conducted in the project area. In implementing the proposed GAP, the mitigation measures on 
the  issues  identified  in  the  study  conducted  are  addressed.  The  GAP  proposes  to  include 
gender issues in almost all project activities and training ensuring that both men and women get 
benefit  from  the  project  equally.  The  GAP  also  pays  attention  to  the  project  management, 
monitoring and reporting. Sex-disaggregated data should be included in project progress report.   
Outputs  
1.  Efficiency and climate 
resilience of irrigation 
systems in the project 
areas enhanced 
2.   Water resource 
management improved

B. 
Monitoring  
55. 
Project  performance  monitoring.  A  project  performance  monitoring  system  (PPMS), 
has  been  developed  (Appendix  3)  based  on  the  key  indicators  and  targets  outlined  in  the 
project design and monitoring framework (DMF). It shall be established after the  implementing 
agency  has  develop  comprehensive  PPMS  procedures  and  plans  in  accordance  with  ADB's 
Project Performance Monitoring System Handbook within six months of loan effectiveness with 
support  of  PMIC.  The  PPMS  procedures,  performance  indicators,  and  their  targets  will  be 
reviewed and approved by ADB. Benchmark review mainly focusing on secondary data will be 
conducted.  With  the  help  of  PMIC,  the  implementing  agency  will  then  undertake  every  six 
months quantitative and qualitative project-performance monitoring for each project component 
to evaluate the delivery of planned facilities and the project benefits that accrued.  
56. 
Compliance monitoring. A number of assurances have been given by the Government 
to ensure smooth implementation of the project. Those are subject to the Loan covenants (Loan 
Agreement –schedule 5). ADB will monitor compliance with those covenants during the project 
implementation  through  regular  review  missions,  quarterly  progress  reports  submitted  by  the 
PMU, and review of project accounts and procurement procedures. 
Social  safeguards  monitoring.  The  Resettlement  Framework  details  monitoring  and 
57. 
reporting  requirements  for  involuntary  resettlement.  In  essence,  both  internal  and  external 
monitoring will be conducted. PMU will be responsible for internal monitoring while an external 
monitoring  agency  will  be  hired  to  conduct  external  monitoring  and  evaluation  for  involuntary 
resettlement. Internal and external monitoring will produce quarterly monitoring reports. 
58.  Gender  and  social  dimensions  monitoring.  The  progress  of  gender  and  social 
activities  outlined  in  the  GAP  will  be  reported  by  the  PMU  in  QPRs.  Achievement  of 
performance  indicators  of  the  GAP  outlined  in  the  DMF  will  be  updated  six  monthly  in  the 
PPMS. 
C. 
Evaluation 
59. 
 The implementing agency, with support of the PMIC, will provide six monthly updates of 
the  project’s  performance  through  PPMS.  The  status  of  achievement  of  performance 
targets/indicators  of  the  project’s  outcome  and  output  will  be  provided  in  the  six  monthly 
updates.  ADB  review  missions  will  review  the  PPMS  bi-annually  to  evaluate  the  project’s 
performance  and  likelihood  of  delivering  the  desired  outputs  and  achieving  the  envisaged 
outcome.  The  corrective  actions  will  be  agreed  with  the  executing/implementing  agency  and 
recorded  in  the  aid  memoirs/MOUs  and  subsequently  monitored  by  ADB  and  the  executing 
agency. 
D. 
Reporting  
The executing agency will provide ADB and MEF with (i) quarterly progress reports in a 
60. 
format  consistent  with  ADB's  project  performance  reporting  system;  (ii)  consolidated  annual 
the 
reports 
(a)  progress  achieved  by  output  as  measured 
including 
through 
40 
indicator's/performance  targets,  (b)  key  implementation  issues  and  solutions;  (c)  updated 
procurement  plan  and  (d)  updated  implementation  plan  for  next  12  months;  and  (iii)  a  project 
completion  report  within  6  months  of  physical  completion  of  the  project.  To  ensure  projects 
continue to be both viable and sustainable, project accounts and the executing agency’s audited 
financial  statements,  together  with  the  associated  auditor's  report,  should  be  adequately 
reviewed. 
E.

ANTICORRUPTION POLICY  
62. 
ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any violations of the 
Anticorruption  Policy  relating  to  the  project.16  All  contracts  financed  by  ADB  shall  include 
provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the 
executing agency and all project contractors, suppliers, consultants and other service providers. 
Individuals/entities  on  ADB’s  anticorruption  debarment  list  are  ineligible  to  participate  in  ADB-
financed activity and may not be awarded any contracts under the project.17  
63.

ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISM 
64. 
People who  are,  or may  in the future  be,  adversely  affected  by  the  project may  submit 
complaints  to  ADB’s  Accountability  Mechanism.  The  Accountability  Mechanism  provides  an 
independent  forum  and  process  whereby  people  adversely  affected  by  ADB-assisted  projects 
can voice, and seek a resolution of their problems, as well as report alleged violations of ADB’s 
operational  policies  and  procedures.  Before  submitting  a  complaint  to  the  Accountability 
Mechanism, affected people should make a good faith effort to solve their problems by working 
with  the  concerned  ADB  operations  department.    Only  after  doing  that,  and  if  they  are  still 
dissatisfied, should they approach the Accountability Mechanism.18

Methodology 
33. 
The methods for external monitoring activities include: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
Review  of  DMS  process  to  be  able  to  establish  a  baseline  for  monitoring  and 
evaluating  project  benefits.  The  external  monitoring  organization  (EMO)  to 
check  on  a  random  basis4  the  DMS  process  with  APs,  from  identification  to 
agreement  on  DMS  results.  The  EMO  will  also  evaluate  the  DMS  process  to 
determine and assess if DMS activities are being carried out/was carried out in 
a participatory and transparent manner.  
Resettlement  audit  conducted  during  monitoring.  The  EMO  will  carry  out 
random checks of payments5 disbursed to APs during monitoring. The EMO will 
submit  a  resettlement  audit  report  upon  completion  of  compensation  payment 
to APs. 
Review  of  socioeconomic  data6  prepared  during  the  project  preparatory 
technical  assistance  (PPTA).  With  this  review,  the  DMS  data,  and  additional 
data compiled, the EMO will provide the baseline data to be used in comparison 
to  the  post-resettlement  survey.  A  post-resettlement  survey  will  be  carried  out 
one  year  following  completion  of  all  resettlement  activities,  including  livelihood 
restoration  activities.  Sampling  will  include  at  least  20%  of  severely  affected 
and  vulnerable  households,  as  well  as  at  least  10%  of  all  other  APs.  Special 
attention  will  be  paid  to  the  inclusion  of  women,  ethnic  groups,  the  very  poor, 
the  landless  and  other  vulnerable  groups,  with  set  questions  for  women  and 
other  target  groups.  The  database  will  disaggregate  information  by  gender, 
vulnerability, and ethnicity. 
Participatory  Rapid  Appraisal  (PRA),  which  will  involve  obtaining  information, 
identifying  existing  or  potential  problems,  and  finding  specific  time-bound 
solutions  through  participatory  means  including:  a)  key  informant  interviews 
including  representatives  of  civil  society,  community  groups,  and  NGOs;  b) 
focus  group  discussions  (FGDs)  on  specific  topics  such  as  compensation 
payment,  income  restoration  and relocation7;  c)  community  public  meetings  to 
discuss  community 
in  host 
communities or construction work employment; d) direct field observations, for 
example,  of  resettlement  site  development;  e)  formal  and  informal  interviews

PROJECT PERFORMANCE MONITORING SYSTEM 
I. 
Introduction 
This  document  presents  the  project  performance  monitoring  system  (PPMS)  for  the 
1. 
Cambodia: Uplands Irrigation and Water Resources Management Sector Project, funded by the 
Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Government of Cambodia. The PPMS is developed for 
monitoring the indicators and targets for outcome and outputs outlined in the project design and 
monitoring framework (DMF).  
II. 
Project Description 
A. 
Components 
2. 
The project will have the following two outputs:  
Output  1:  Enhanced  efficiency  and  climate resilience  of  irrigation  systems  in  the 
3. 
project areas. The project will support rehabilitation, modernization, and climate proofing of at 
least  three  irrigation  systems  to  increase  the  cultivated  area  in  the  project  areas  in  Kampong 
Thom  and Battambang provinces  to  29,500  ha.1 It  will  (i)  rehabilitate the  undersluices  and  the 
spillway of the Taing Krasaing headworks, 22-kilometers (km) main Taing Krasaing canal, and 
48.0  km  of  secondary  and  tertiary  canals;  (ii)  install  a  pumping  system  and  associated 
distribution channels to lift water by a maximum of 3 meters for 2,960 ha of developed rain-fed 
land  in  the  Taing  Krasaing  system  command  area;  (iii)  rehabilitate  the  Prek  Chik  headworks 
(including  raising  the  spillway  by  1.5  meters),  28-km  main  Prek  Chik  canal,  and  70.2  km  of 
secondary  and  tertiary  canals  to  cover  10,400  ha  net  irrigated  area;  (iv)  install  structures  and 
gauges for water measurement, control, and distribution on the Taing Krasaing and Prek Chik 
system’s  main  and  distribution  canals;  (v)  improve  drainage  facilities  for  1,800  ha  to  climate 
proof  the  irrigation  facilities  against  floods;  (vi)  carry  out  laser  land  leveling  of  2,000  ha;  (vii) 
improve 21,000 ha of land through irrigation, drainage, and/or flood protection; and (viii) conduct 
feasibility studies, design, and improvement works for the O Kra Nahk irrigation system serving 
about 1,500 ha in Kampong Thom province, and other noncore subprojects. 
4. 
Output  2:  Improved water  resource  management.  The  project  will  organize  FWUCs 
and provide gender-inclusive training to FWUC members on (i) O&M of canals, (ii) management 
of FWUCs, (iii) issues related to climate variability and change, and (iv) water management. It 
will  also  involve  them  in  the  design  and  implementation  of  subprojects.  It  will  install 
hydrometeorological stations in the watersheds and establish canal flow measurement systems. 
The  project  will  train  staff  of  the  Ministry  of  Water  Resources  and  Meteorology  (MOWRAM), 
MOWRAM’s Department of Farmer Water User Communities (DFWUC), provincial departments 
of  water  resources  and  meteorology  (PDWRAMs),  the  FWUCs,  and  the  MAFF  on  (i)  modern 
canal operation techniques, (ii) irrigation scheduling, (iii) watershed management, and (iv) water 
management.  It  will  also  strengthen  their  awareness  of  climate  resilience  in  water  resource 
management. The project will modernize canal operations, undertake irrigation scheduling, and 
integrate  the  scheduling  with  the  canal  flow  gauging  system  to  manage  supplies,  particularly 
during  droughts.  It  will  also  design  joint  reservoir  operations  for  (i)  Stung  Chinit  and  Taing 
Krasaing  reservoirs  in Kampong Thom,  and (ii) Bassac  and Dauntri reservoirs  in  Battambang. 
1  Feasibility  studies  have  been  completed  for  the  Taing  Kraisang  and  Prek  Chik  irrigation  systems.  The  feasibility 
study for the O Kra Nahk irrigation system will be carried out during project implementation.  
Appendix 3

Project Implementation Arrangements 
8. 
MOWRAM will be the executing agency and DFWUC will be the implementing agency. A 
PMU  has  been  established  in  DFWUC  before  commencement  of  the  project  preparatory 
technical  assistance  (PPTA).  The  PMU  is  headed  by  a  Project  Director  who  is  the  Deputy 
Director General for Technical Affairs, DFWUC and a Project Manager who is the Director of the 
DFWUC.  The  PMU  was  fully  involved  in  the  preparation  of  the  project.  For  implementation  of 
the  project, the  PMU  will  be  composed  of  24  designated  personnel from  MOWRAM,  DFWUC, 
MAFF, Department of Hydrology and River Work (DHRW), and (PDWRAMs) of Kampong Thom 
and  Battambang  provinces.  MAFF  staff  will  coordinate  the  land  levelling  and  other  supporting 
activities to be provided from CRRCSDP including access to quality seed and agriculture value 
chain  facilities  and  services.  PDWRAMs  will  be  responsible  for  coordinating  all  field  activities 
with FWUCs and DFWUC. DHRW will coordinate installation, operation, and data collection of 
hydro-meteorological stations.  
9. 
A  steering  committee,  chaired  by  H.E.  Minister  MOWRAM  and  comprising  senior 
officials  from  MOWRAM,  MAFF,  Ministry  of  Economy  and  Finance  (MEF)  and  Provincial 
Governor’s  Office  of  two  provinces,  will  oversee  the  project  implementation  and  management 
and  provide  policy  guidance.  Resettlement  and  land  acquisition  will  be  implemented  by  and 
under the management of the Inter-Ministerial  Resettlement  Committee  (IRC)  chaired  by  MEF 
with  membership  from  the  representatives  of  relevant  line  ministries  in  close  cooperation  with 
the Kampong Thom and Battambang Provincial Resettlement Sub-committees. The PMU will be 
responsible for  implementation,  planning,  organization,  monitoring  and reporting  of  the  project 
and will be supported by the project management and implementation consultants (PMIC). The 
PMIC  will  comprise  64  person-months  of  international  and  610  person-months  of  national 
experts  to  provide  technical  support  to  the  PMU  to  efficiently  manage  and  implement  the 
project. ADB’s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time) will 
be  used  for  recruiting  the  consulting  firms.  The  anticipated  procurements  include  small  and 
large  works  contracts  and  goods,  which  will  be  procured  by  using  ADB’s  national  and 
international competitive bidding and shopping methods. An imprest account will be maintained 
at the PMU level for ADB loan funds.

C. 
Data Management System  
The  process  of  Data  Management  consists  of  Data  Collection,  Data  Communication, 
17. 
Analysis and Reporting. This is discussed in detail below.  
18. 
Data will be collected on all the indicators defined in the DMF by PMIC and PDWRAM. It 
shall  be  reported  to  the  M&E  specialist  of  the  PMIC  in  the  PMU.  This  will  include  data  on 
irrigation  infrastructure  improved,  irrigation  efficiency,  upgrades  of  drainage  facilities,  land 
leveling,  percentage  of  women  employed  as  unskilled  laborers,  FWUCs  formed  and  trained, 
O&M, and installation of hydro-meteorological stations.  
The  PMIC  and  PDWRAM  will  compile  the  information  in  respect  of  the  individual 
19. 
schemes  carried  out  by  the  project  and  submit  this  to  the  PMU  once  they  have  collected  the 
necessary details required for evaluating the output of the activities.  The PMU would review the 
data submitted and will accordingly update the PPMS with support of PMIC. 
20. 
Data  on  indicators  related  to  laser  land  leveling  and  FWUC  will  be  collected  by 
MOWRAM and PMIC through MAFF. Data on indicators related to irrigation, O&M planning, and 
allocation  of  government  funds  for  O&M  of  main,  secondary  and  primary  canals  and 
storage/diversion structures will be collected by MOWRAM.  
72 
Appendix 3 
 Data will be collected by MOWRAM through their PDWRAM in the two project focused 
21. 
provinces.  PDWRAM  will  assign  a  focal  point  in  their  respective  province.  This  person  will  be 
responsible for collecting and communicating data to MOWRAM. The focal point in MOWRAM 
will also analyze the data and then report it to the PMIC and PMU.  
22. 
PPMS will be updated every 6 months from the start to end of the project. It will be sent 
to  ADB  by  30  January  and  30  July  every  year.  The  diagram  presenting  the  data  flow  is 
presented as Figure 7 below.
