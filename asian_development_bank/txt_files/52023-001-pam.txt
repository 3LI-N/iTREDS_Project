Project Administration Manual Purpose and Process 
1.  The  project  administration  manual  (PAM)  describes  the  essential  administrative  and 
management requirements to implement the project on time, within budget, and in accordance 
with  Government  and  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  policies  and  procedures.  The  PAM 
should include references to all available templates and instructions either through linkages to 
relevant URLs or directly incorporated in the PAM. 
2.  The Dengzhou City Government (DCG), as the executing agency, and Integrated Urban Rural 
Development Pilot Area Administration Bureau (IURDPAAB), Environment Protection Bureau 
(EPB),  and  Water  Resources  Bureau  (WRB)  as  the  implementing  agencies,  are  wholly 
responsible for the implementation of the project, as agreed jointly between the borrower and 
ADB;  and  in  accordance  with  government  and  ADB  policies  and  procedures.  ADB  staff  is 
responsible to support implementation including compliance by the DCG of their obligations and 
responsibilities for project implementation in accordance with ADB policies and procedures. 
3.  At loan negotiations, the borrower and ADB shall agree to the PAM and ensure consistency 
with the loan and project agreements. Such agreements shall be reflected in the minutes of the 
loan negotiations. In the event of any discrepancy or contradiction between the PAM and the 
loan and project agreements, the provisions of the loan and project agreements shall prevail. 
4.  After ADB Board approval of the project's report and recommendations of the President (RRP), 
changes in implementation arrangements are subject to agreement and approval pursuant to 
relevant government and ADB administrative procedures (including the project administration 
instructions) and upon such approval they will be subsequently incorporated in the PAM.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
1. 
The  project  will  help  the  Dengzhou  City  Government  (DCG)  restore  the  Tuan  River 
ecosystem  and  improve  the  water  services  with  a  well-balanced  mix  of  structural  and 
nonstructural interventions, leading to environmental sustainability and improved livelihoods. The 
project will adopt an integrated approach to enhance rural and urban water links that addresses 
a  complex  environmental  problem  in  rapidly  developing  societies  therefore  serves  as  a 
demonstration model for the PRC and beyond. 
A. 
Rationale 
2. 
The  Yangtze  River  Economic  Belt  (YREB)  is  one  of  the  three  key  economic  growth 
engines in the PRC. Its nine provinces and two specially administered municipalities account for 
more  than  40%  of  the  PRC’s  population,  40%  of  its  freshwater  resources,  and  about  45%  of 
economic output. While the YREB has benefited from extensive development since the 1980s, 
economic growth in the middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze River Basin lags that of the 
coastal  areas.  These parts  of the  YREB  still face significant  challenges as a  result  of  (i)  weak 
institutional coordination for strategic planning; (ii) increasing  pollution and pressure on natural 
resources;  (iii)  slow  transformation  to  green  development;  and  (iv)  limited  integration  of 
waterways, ports, and intermodal logistics. To manage these challenges, the Government of the 
PRC  formulated  the  Yangtze  River  Economic  Belt  Development  Plan,  2016–2030.1 The  Asian 
Development Bank (ADB) and the government have agreed to adopt a framework approach to 
strategically program ADB’s lending support for development initiatives in the YREB.2 Priority is 
given to (i) institutional strengthening and policy reform; (ii) ecosystem restoration, environmental 
protection,  and  management  of  water  resources;  (iii)  inclusive  green  industrial  transformation; 
and (iv) construction of an integrated multimodal transport corridor.  
3. 
Rural livelihoods in the YREB have lagged industrial production and urban livelihoods. As 
a result, income inequality and poverty persist in rural areas of  the less-developed middle and 
upper reaches of the Yangtze River Basin. Most rural wastewater and solid waste is discharged 
directly  to  the  water  system  without  treatment  and  proper  disposal. 3  As  the  rural  economy 
expands, increasing regulatory, administrative, and environmental management challenges will 
require stronger institutional capacity. Against this background, the  government formulated the 
National  Strategic  Plan  for  Rural  Vitalization,  2018–2022  to  promote  poverty  reduction,  rural 
development,  and  green  and  inclusive  growth. 4  The  rural  vitalization  strategy  focuses  on 
governance  reform,  wastewater  and  solid  waste  management,  rural–urban  integration, 
ecosystem protection, and rural development. The strategy prioritizes managing climate change 
and the environment to support ecological  civilization and rural vitalization. 
4. 
Project area. Dengzhou, a county-level city in Nanyang City, Henan Province, is poor and 
relatively rural. It has weak institutional capacity in environmental management and is strategically 
located  at  the  sources  of  South–North  Water  Diversion  Project. 5  As  part  of  the  Han  River 
watershed in the Yangtze River Basin, Dengzhou City is a national key ecological function zone,

3  In  2017,  only  25%  of  villages  had  appropriate  sanitation  facilities  and  only  60%  had  solid  waste  collection  and 
disposal services, contributing to poor environmental conditions. In 2015, the Thirteenth Five-Year Plan, 2016–2020 
mandated  the  installation  of  sanitation  systems  in  at  least  70%  of  the  rural  villages  in  the  country  by  2020 
(Government  of  the  PRC.  2016.  Outline  of  the  Thirteenth  Five-Year  Plan  for  National  Economic  and  Social 
Development, 2016–2020. Beijing).

as designated by the government. With 28 townships and 606 villages, the city has an area of 
2,369 square kilometers and had a population of 1.78 million people in 2018, of which 60% are 
rural. The project area covers the townships and villages along the Tuan River, a tributary of the 
Han River in Dengzhou City. In 2018, most of the city’s 32,465 poor people (with an annual per 
capita income of less than CNY3,208) were low-paid women. The Tuan River Basin has (i) a per 
capita freshwater availability of only 345 cubic meters (m3) per year (less than 13% of the national 
average), (ii) the lowest water supply coverage that relies on polluted groundwater, and (iii) the 
highest disposal rate of untreated wastewater and solid wastes. Located in Henan Province, an 
ecological red-line area, Dengzhou City is part of a cluster of cities and counties surrounding the 
YREB that significantly contribute to the YREB’s development goals.6 
5. 
Poor water quality. Almost 100% of Dengzhou City’s rural population and 30% of its urban 
population lacks proper access to water, wastewater, and solid waste management facilities. This 
results in poor health and creates heavy burden particularly for women, who play a major role in 
household water and waste management in the city. Despite experiencing an acute water scarcity, 
the city, as a source of water diversion project, helps resolve the water scarcity problems in the 
water-deprived northern region of the PRC. About 143,000 of the city’s rural population relies for 
their  drinking  water  supply  on  shallow  groundwater  that  is  contaminated  by  the  heavily  polluted 
Tuan  River,  untreated  wastes,  and  chemical  fertilizers  used  extensively  on  farmland.  The  city’s 
groundwater quality is far below national standards.7 From 2008 to 2018, there were 300,000 cases 
of waterborne diseases, affecting mainly women and children.8 The Tuan River is heavily polluted 
from  point  sources,  including  6  million  m3  of  wastewater,  and  300,000  tons  of  garbage  directly 
disposed into the river annually; and nonpoint sources, mainly from farmlands; and water quality 
exceeds class V (the worst on the scale) in almost every section of the lower Tuan River.9 
6. 
Impaired water ecosystem service. The untreated wastewater and accumulated solid 
waste in the Tuan River have severely impacted the aquatic life and impaired the entire water 
ecosystem.  The  river’s  hydrology,  water  environment,  and  geomorphology  have  also  been 
substantially altered by water operation, urbanization, and climate change impacts, resulting in a 
degraded river corridor environment. Serious riverbank erosion has progressively damaged the 
productive farmlands. The undercutting of the riverbank and accumulation of construction wastes 
in various sections of the river have also exacerbated the degradation of the water environment 
and damaged the riverfront design in the urban area. Further, several of the city’s natural wetlands 
and  drainage  channels,  including  small  creeks  of  hydrological,  environmental,  and  historical 
significance,  have  disappeared  since  2010.  The  frequency  of  floods  is  on  the  rise  because  of 
morphological changes, urbanization on the floodplain, and climatic variability, therefore likely to 
pose a serious problem for the city. The 30-kilometer (km) river profile in the city is fully eutrophic, 
and the resulting persistent foul odor has impaired the living environment along the river reach.10  
7. 
Weak institution and capacity to manage water resources. Since beginning operations 
in late 2014, the water diversion project has allocated 692 million m3 of free of charge water to 
Dengzhou City each year, of which only about 15% has been used because of a lack of proper 
planning and limited water resource management capacity. The DCG adopted various measures 
to protect the river environment and improve the livelihood of the people, but it could not deliver 
the expected results because of inadequate problem analysis, fragmented management of water 
6   In  2015,  PRC  formulated  a  national  policy,  mandating  local  governments  to  establish  ecosystems  services 
assessments in land use planning, which is known as ecological redline policy.

and ecosystem services, and poor planning and design without proper stakeholder participation. 
Lack of asset management in the DCG has substantially increased the risk of poor public services 
and  unforeseen  costs  in  development  investments.  Located  at  the  headstream  of  the  water 
diversion  project,  the  city  faces  restrictions  on  development  mainly  because  water  quality  and 
quantity  in  the  Danjiangkou  Reservoir  is  being  degraded. 11 To  ensure  sound  environmental 
management and protection of the reservoir, the DCG receives eco-compensation annually from 
the Beijing Municipal Government as an incentive, but this has not been used properly.12  
8. 
Given the competing needs for soil and water conservation and rural livelihood development 
in this unique ecosystem, an integrated watershed management is required with strong database. 
To  establish  a  fair  compensation  mechanism,  a  performance-based  approach  with  proper 
monitoring and evaluation of outcomes and financial rewards or penalty provisions also needs to 
be developed with the involvement of the DCG and the cities that benefit from the water diversion 
project. To do this, the DCG needs to strengthen its institutional and operational capacities. 
9. 
Rural–urban water linkages. Complex and poorly managed rural–urban water links have 
direct implications on rural and urban livelihoods, and the Tuan River environment. For example, 
untreated sewage from the urban area on the right bank of the river is discharged directly into the 
Tuan River, where it recharges the groundwater that is the only source of drinking water in the 
rural  area  on  the  left  bank.  Similarly,  poor  sanitation and  solid waste  management  in  the rural 
villages,  and  the  use  of  chemical  fertilizer  and  pesticides  on  the  farmlands,  contaminate  the 
groundwater and damage the river environment and the river front design of the urban area. Urban 
encroachment  into  the  river  corridor  and  disposal  of  construction  wastes  into  the  river  have 
resulted in river sedimentation leading to the water contamination and frequent flooding in rural 
villages 30 km downstream.  
10. 
The  DCG  urgently  needs  to  address  these  links  by  improving  its  water  management 
strategy and plan and strengthening its institutional and technical capacities to achieve the goals. 
Located in a less-developed region in the middle of Yangtze River Basin, the city can demonstrate 
an environmentally sustainable growth model for addressing the rural–urban water links that can 
be replicated in other parts of the river basin and the PRC. 
Strategic  fit.  Under  the  rural  vitalization  plan  (footnote  4),  local  governments  will 
11. 
implement their own plans to improve rural public services and the environment. The DCG has 
formulated its Thirteenth Five-Year Plan, 2016–2020, consistent with the national Thirteenth Five-
Year Plan, 2016–2020.13 In addition to local development plans, the project is aligned with ADB’s 
Strategy  2030,  especially  the  operational  priority  areas  of  tackling  climate  change,  building 
disaster resilience, and enhancing environmental sustainability; promoting rural development and 
food  security;  and  making  cities  more  livable. 14 It  is  also  closely  aligned  with  ADB’s  country 
11 The reservoir of the water diversion project, constructed in the 1950s, has a surface area of 1,050 square kilometers; 
storage capacity of 29.05 cubic kilometers; and a watershed area of 95,200 square kilometers. Besides irrigation, 
flood control, and hydropower generation, it also supplies water through a 1,274 km stretch of canal to 14 cities in 
the northern PRC, benefiting more than 50 million people in the water-deprived cities of Beijing and Tianjin, and the 
provinces of Hebei and Henan under the water diversion project. 
12 The eco-compensation includes CNY278 million in direct cash payments, CNY340 million for capacity building  in 
environmental protection, medical coverage and education for affected populations, and free use of 692 million m3 
of water from the water diversion project for various uses. The amount is part of the city government’s annual budget 
and there is no proper accounting provision for the compensation fund by source and area.

partnership strategy for the PRC, 2016–2020, particularly the three major principles of managing 
climate change and environment, supporting inclusive economic growth, and fostering knowledge 
cooperation.15 It is consistent with ADB’s Water Operational Plan, 2011–2020, which emphasizes 
integrated water resources management (IWRM) with a focus on rural water management;16 and 
Sustainable Development Goals 6, 11, and 13.17 The project also supports ADB’s new action plan 
for healthy oceans by reducing the amount of solid waste discharged into the Yangtze River and 
eventually the sea.18 The project will contribute to the fulfillment of the Paris Agreement that the 
PRC signed in 2015, and is aligned with the PRC’s Intended Nationally Determined Contributions 
to limit carbon emissions by 2030.19 
12. 
Lessons learned. The project will implement IWRM focusing on rural–urban integration 
aiming  at  improving  the  rural  livelihoods  and  Tuan  River  environment  in  Dengzhou  City.  The 
project design has incorporated lessons from previous ADB-financed projects and policy-oriented 
studies on IWRM, environmental and ecosystem improvement, wetland and lake management, 
and rural–urban integration in the PRC and other developing member countries. Past and ongoing 
ADB support in the PRC underscore the importance of (i) strengthening nature-based solutions 
and  community  engagement;  (ii)  ensuring  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  provisions  with 
sustainable sources of finance; (iii) using high-level technologies in IWRM including in decision-
making;  (iv)  introducing  institutional  and  financial  management  reforms  that  contribute  to 
sustainable water resources management; (v) developing capacity for project implementation and 
O&M; and (vi) instituting an effective project monitoring and evaluation system. 20 
B.

17. 
Special project features and value addition. The project will (i) contribute to global and 
regional public goods through soil and water conservation and waste management in the Yangtze 
River Basin. It will also contribute to (i) the PRC’s Intended Nationally Determined Contributions 
to  ensure  that  carbon  emissions  peak  by  2030  through  afforestation  and  (ii)  regional  water 
distribution under the water diversion project; and will help launch the implementation of the rural 
vitalization plan (footnote 4). The project represents a fraction of the larger 5-year investment plan 
by  the  DCG  and  will  demonstrate  ecological  protection,  while  advocating  a  river-basin-scale 
IWRM approach in the YREB. 25 It will support the DCG in identifying and improving the rural–urban 
water links in a complex but representative case of rapidly urbanizing societies in the PRC.  
18. 
The  project  will  also  demonstrate  urban  planning  by  preserving  the  historical  sites  and 
establishing  ecological  parks  that  reflect  Dengzhou  City’s  historical  values.  It  will  establish  an 
advanced asset management practice with (i) digital asset inventory and records on geographic 
information  systems,  (ii)  an  interactive  service  delivery  system  and  automatic  water  leakage 
detection  system,  (iii)  a  decision  support  system  for  asset  acquisition  and  disposal,  and                      
23 The park will feature the city’s 2,500 years of history related to Chinese medicine, literature, governance, agriculture, 
and architecture for educational and tourism purposes. 
25 A  comprehensive  river  basin  model  developed  during  project  appraisal  will  be  further  developed  during  project 
implementation to establish a decision support system and aid development planning and project design. 
6 
(iv) guidelines and training courses for asset criticality and risk assessment. The project will promote 
the sustainability of the rural water supply system by integrating it with the urban water services for 
the management, including O&M, and service delivery provisions to fill the current institutional and 
policy gaps in rural water supply in the PRC. It will leverage the knowledge partnership between the 
DCG and local research institutes by establishing an environmental research and education center 
that  studies  and  monitors  the  local  water  and  environmental  issues  and  evaluate  project 
performance. Lastly, it will support the DCG in implementing the project in a gender-responsive and 
socially inclusive manner. The project’s innovations and value addition will be disseminated through 
knowledge products and knowledge-sharing events.

applied to disbursed loan proceeds, and a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such other 
terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. Financial charges during 
the project implementation will not be capitalized in the loan. The government has requested that 
repayment will follow the straight-line repayment method. The average loan maturity is 15.75 years 
with a maturity premium of 0.1% payable to ADB. Accrual of commitment charge will commence 
60 days after loan signing and will not be billed before the loan agreement has become effective. 
All conditions will be finalized at the loan negotiation. 
22. 
The ADB loan will finance 45.06% of the total project costs including expenditures relating 
to  civil  works,  goods,  consulting  services,  capacity  development,  interest  during  construction, 
commitment charges; and taxes and duties of €6.43 million for eligible ADB-financed expenditures. 
The  government  will  finance  52.73%  of  the  total  project  costs,  including  engineering  designs, 
procurement activities, and construction supervision; land acquisition and resettlement; civil works; 
environmental protection; taxes and duties of €6.09 million, and contingencies. 
Climate mitigation is estimated to cost €17.75 million and climate adaptation is estimated 
23. 
to cost €2.27 million. ADB will finance 100% of mitigation and adaptation costs. 
A. 
Cost Estimates Preparation and Revisions 
24. 
Cost estimates were prepared on behalf of the project management office (PMO) by the 
feasibility  study  report  design  institute,  in  consultation  with  the  implementing  agencies  and 
transaction technical assistance consultants, and under the guidance of the ADB project officer. 
Costing  was  completed  using  government  costing  standards,  costing  information  from  site 
investigations, and project files of the design institute.  
Responsibility for revising and updating the cost estimates during implementation rest with 
25. 
the  PMO  and  implementing  agencies.  The  PMO  and  implementing  agencies,  supported  by  the 
design institute, a procurement agent, supervision companies and implementation consultants, are 
responsible for the design and procurement, the administration and monitoring of contractors and 
suppliers.  The  revision  of  cost  estimates  will  be  undertaken  during  the  execution  of  these 
responsibilities. Cost evaluations will occur, and revisions will be made as necessary at detailed 
design during the review of tenders, and during the monitoring of contract execution.  
B. 
Key Assumptions 
26. 
The following key assumptions underpin the cost estimates and financing plan: 
Exchange rate: CNY 7.813348 = €1.0 (as of 18 October 2019) 
(i) 
Price contingencies based on expected cumulative inflation over the implementation 
(ii) 
period are as follows:27 
27  A purchasing power parity model is used to account for international cost inflation.

FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT 
A. 
Financial Management Assessment 
A financial management assessment of the executing agency and implementing agencies 
27. 
were conducted in January 2019 in accordance with ADB’s Technical Guidance Note on Financial 
management Assessment (2015), to determine their financial management capacity with respect 
to funds flow arrangements, staffing, accounting policies and procedures, internal and external 
auditing arrangements, reporting and monitoring, and financial information system. 
28. 
The assessment determined that the main financial management risks arise because the 
executing agency and implementing agencies have no experience in the implementation of an 
ADB  loan  project  before.  The  overall  pre-mitigation  financial  management  risk  is  rated  as 
“moderate”.  The  Henan  Provincial  Finance  Department  (HPFD),  which  is  experienced  with 
several  ADB  funded  projects  and  has  adequate  financial  management  capacity,  will  ensure 
proper use of the advance account and SOE procedures. With HFPD supervision, the executing 
agency  (DCG)  has  adequate  capacity  to  administer  use  of  Statement  of  Expenditures  (SOE) 
procedures.  The  borrower  and  executing  agency  and  implementing  agencies  have  agreed  to 
implement  an  action  plan  as  key  measures  to  address  the  deficiencies.  The  identified  risks  in 
financial management will be closely monitored during the project implementation. 
29. 
It was agreed that the implementing agencies will strengthen their capabilities by (i) setting 
up  clear  institutional  arrangements  and  coordination  mechanisms;  (ii)  completing  staff 
deployment  in  appropriate  financial  management  positions  with  English  language  support;  (iii) 
developing  methodologies  for  managing  foreign  exchange  and  interest  rate  risks;  and  (iv) 
undertaking more training, particularly on ADB policy and procedures. Table 11 demonstrates a 
financial  risk  mitigation  plan  to  be  adopted  by  the  implementing  agencies  during  the  project 
implementation:

Disbursement 
1. 
Disbursement Arrangements for ADB Funds 
The  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  Loan  Disbursement 
30. 
Handbook  (2017  as  amended  from  time  to  time), 28  and  detailed  arrangements  agreed  upon 
between the government and ADB. Online training for project staff on disbursement policies and 
procedures  is  available.29  Project  staff  are  encouraged  to  avail  of  this  training  to  help  ensure 
efficient disbursement and fiduciary control. 
31. 
The  implementing  agencies,  through  the  PMO,  will  be  responsible for  all disbursement 
arrangements  including  (i)  preparing  disbursement  projections;  (ii)  requesting  budgetary 
allocations  for  counterpart  funds;  (iii)  collecting  supporting  documents;  and  (iv)  preparing  and 
sending withdrawal applications through DFB to ADB. 
32. 
Advance fund procedure. To facilitate project implementation through timely release of 
loan proceeds, the HPFD will establish an advance account promptly after loan effectiveness at 
a commercial bank. The advance account is to be used exclusively for ADB’s share of eligible 
expenditures.  The  currency  of  the  advance  account  is  US  dollar.  HPFD,  who  established  the 
advance account in its name, is accountable and responsible for the proper use of advances to 
the advance account.  
33. 
The total outstanding advance to the advance account should not exceed the estimate of 
ADB’s share of expenditures to be paid through the advance account for the forthcoming 6 months. 
HPFD may request initial and additional advances to the advance account based on an Estimate 
of  Expenditure  Sheet 30 that  sets  out  the  estimated  expenditures  to  be  financed  through  the 
account  for  the  forthcoming  6  months.  Supporting  documents  should  be  submitted  to  ADB  or 
retained by HPFD in accordance with ADB’s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended 
from time to time) when liquidating or replenishing the advance account. 
28 The handbook is available electronically from the ADB website (http://www.adb.org/documents/ loan-disbursement-
handbook. 
29  Disbursement eLearning. http://wpqr4.adb.org/disbursement_elearning  
30 Estimate  of  Expenditure  sheet  is  available  in  Appendix  8A  of  ADB’s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2017,  as 
amended from time to time). 
30 
Statement  of  expenditure  (SOE)  procedure.31 The  SOE  procedure  may  be  used  for 
34. 
reimbursement  of  eligible  expenditures  or  liquidation  of  advances  to  the  advance  account. 
Supporting  documents  and  records  for  the  expenditures  claimed  under  the  SOE  should  be 
maintained and made readily available for review by ADB’s disbursement and review missions, 
upon  ADB’s  request  for  submission  of  supporting  documents  on  a  sampling  basis,  and  for 
independent audit. 
35. 
Before  the  submission  of  the  first  withdrawal  application,  the  DCG,  through  the  HPFD, 
should  submit  to ADB  sufficient  evidence  of  the  authority  of  the  person(s)  who  will  sign  the 
withdrawal  applications  on  behalf  of  the  DCG,  together  with  the  authenticated  specimen 
signatures of each authorized person. The minimum value per withdrawal application is stipulated 
in the Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time). Individual payments 
below this amount should be paid by the DCG and subsequently claimed from ADB (i) through 
reimbursement;  or  (ii)  from  the  advance  account,  unless  otherwise  accepted  by  ADB.  The 
borrower  should  ensure  sufficient  category  and  contract  balances  before  requesting 
disbursements. Use of ADB’s Client Portal for Disbursements (CPD) system is encouraged for 
submission of withdrawal applications to ADB. 32 
2. 
Disbursement Arrangements for Counterpart Fund 
The DCG will provide counterpart funds on a timely basis for civil works; goods; design, 
36. 
procurement, and supervision; land acquisition and resettlement; environmental protection; and 
contingencies as specified in the loan and project agreements. The DCG will disburse counterpart 
funds to  contractors,  suppliers,  service  providers,  and  people  affected  by  land  acquisition  and 
resettlement.  
C. 
Accounting 
The DCG will maintain, or cause to be maintained, separate books and records by funding 
37. 
source for all expenditures incurred on the project following the Accounting Methods for Projects 
Financed  by  the  World  Bank  (reference  No.  2000  [13]).33 The  DCG  will  prepare  consolidated 
project financial statements in accordance with the government's accounting laws and regulations, 
which are consistent with international accounting principles and practices. 
D. 
Auditing and Public Disclosure 
DCG  will  cause  the  detailed  consolidated  project  financial  statements  to  be  audited  in 
38. 
accordance with national auditing standards by an independent auditor acceptable to ADB. The 
audited  project financial statements  together  with  the auditor’s  opinion  will  be  submitted  in  the 
English language to ADB within 6 months of the end of the fiscal year by the DCG. 
39. 
The annual audit report for the project accounts will include a management letter and audit 
opinions which cover (i) whether the project financial statements present a true and fair view or 
are presented fairly, in all material respects, in accordance with the applicable financial reporting 
framework; (ii) whether loan proceeds were used only for the purposes of the project;  and (iii) 
whether the borrower or DCG was in compliance with the financial covenants contained in the 
legal  agreements  for  the  project  where  applicable.  The  management  letter  may,  in  addition  to 
other matters, describe the satisfactory arrangements with regard to the proper use of the SOE 
31 SOE forms are available in Appendix 7B and 7D of ADB’s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from 
time to time). 
32 The CPD facilitates online submission of withdrawal applications to ADB, resulting in faster disbursement. The forms 
to be completed by the Borrower are available online at https://www.adb.org/documents/client-portal-disbursements-
guide.

and  advance  procedures  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2017,  as 
amended from time to time) and the project documents. 
40. 
Compliance with financial reporting and auditing requirements will be monitored by review 
missions  during  normal  program  supervision,  and  followed  up  regularly  with  all  concerned, 
including the external auditor.  
41. 
DCG  and  the  implementing  agencies  have  been  made  aware  of  ADB’s  approach  to 
delayed submission, and the requirements for satisfactory and acceptable quality of the audited 
project  financial  statements. 34 ADB  reserves  the  right  to  require  a  change  in  the  auditor  (in  a 
manner consistent with the constitution of the borrower), or for additional support to be provided 
to the auditor, if the audits required are not conducted in a manner satisfactory to ADB, or if the 
audits are substantially delayed. ADB reserves the right to verify the project's financial accounts 
to  confirm  that  the  share  of  ADB’s  financing  is  used  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  policies  and 
procedures.  
Public disclosure of the audited project financial statements, including the auditor’s opinion 
42. 
on the project financial statements, will be guided by ADB’s Access to Information Policy.35 After 
the  review,  ADB  will  disclose  the  audited  project  financial  statements  and  the  opinion  of  the 
auditors on the project financial statements no later than 14 days of ADB’s confirmation of their 
acceptability  by  posting  them  on  ADB’s  website.  The  management  letter,  additional  auditor’s 
opinions, and audited entity financial statements will not be disclosed. 
34  ADB’s approach and procedures regarding delayed submission of audited project financial statements:  
(i)  When audited project financial statements are not received by the due date, ADB will write to the executing 
agency advising that (a) the audit documents are overdue; and (b) if they are not received within the next 6 
months, requests for new contract awards and disbursement such as new replenishment of advance accounts, 
processing of new reimbursement, and issuance of new commitment letters will not be processed. 
(ii)  When  audited  project  financial  statements  are  not  received  within  6  months  after  the  due  date,  ADB  will 
withhold processing of requests for new contract awards and disbursement such as new replenishment of 
advance accounts, processing of new reimbursement, and issuance of new commitment letters. ADB will (a) 
inform the executing agency of ADB’s actions; and (b) advise that the loan may be suspended if the audit 
documents are not received within the next 6 months. 
(iii)  When audited project financial statements  are not received within 12 months after the due date, ADB may 
suspend the loan.

VI. 
PROCUREMENT AND CONSULTING SERVICES 
43. 
A project procurement risk assessment was conducted for the project, in accordance with 
the Guidance Note on Strategic Procurement Planning and Guidance Note on Procurement Risk 
assessment (2018). The overall project procurement risk is moderate. 
44. 
The  main  weaknesses  identified  include:  (i)  lack  of  experience  of  the  DCG  and 
implementing  agencies  in  internationally  financed  projects;  (ii)  some  discrepancies  between 
domestic and ADB practices; and (iii) lack of procedures in place for procurement management 
and project implementation.  
45. 
Proposed mitigation measures include training to be provided to relevant staff of the DCG 
and implementing agencies and the officials who are responsible for procurement regulations in 
the Public Resource Trading Center. The procurement training was delivered by the ADB officials 
and TRTA consultants during the project preparation to the implementing agencies on topics in 
ADB procedures for procurement of goods, works, and consulting services to ensure that the non-
familiarity with ADB procurement framework has been addressed. The procurement training will 
be  delivered  on  a  well-defined  interval  by  the  loan  implementation  consultants  during  project 
implementation to ensure that procurement activities are undertaken in full conformity with ADB 
procurement guidelines and regulations. 
46. 
A  procurement  market  assessment  was  undertaken  to  understand  and  assess  the 
availability of potential qualified bidders to supply works, goods, and services for each sector. It 
was concluded that some works and goods contracts would require international advertisement, 
since domestic suppliers in the PRC cannot provide certain specialized equipment of value more 
than  3  million  dollars.  The  majority  of  the  works  and  goods  contracts  would  require  national 
advertising to attract enough qualified bidders due to the following reasons: (i) most of the project 
components are classified as normal infrastructures, requiring only mature technology which are 
widely  available  nationally;  (ii)  there  are  good  number  of  national  bidders  who  have  adequate 
capacities and resources to meet the requirements; and (ii) the practices evidenced that most of 
the bidders were national, even though the contracts were advertised internationally.36  
The  majority  of  works  and  goods  contracts  can,  therefore,  be  advertised  nationally 
47. 
following open competitive bidding (OCB) procedures, and one works and goods contracts will 
be advertised internationally following OCB procedures. 
A. 
Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing 
48. 
Advance  Contracting.  All  advance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  will  be 
undertaken in conformity with ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and 
Procurement  Regulations  for  ADB  Borrowers  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). 37
 The 
issuance of invitations for bid under advance contracting and retroactive financing will be subject 
to ADB’s approval. The borrower, DCG, and the implementing agencies have been advised that 
approval of advance contracting and retroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance the 
project. 
49. 
Retroactive  financing.  Under  retroactive  financing,  the  implementing  agencies  would 
implement  project  activities  using  their  own  funds.  The  government  was  informed  that  as  a 
general rule, retroactive financing is permitted only if (i) activities are required to be part of the 
detailed project description and have been fully appraised by ADB; (ii) goods and works, for which 
it is requested are on the basis of the approved procurement plan and are procured in accordance

33 
with  ADBs  Procurement  Guidelines  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time);  (iii)  amount  to  be 
retroactively financed does not exceed 20% of the loan amount; (iv) due diligence on the proposed 
contracts  for  advance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  on  engineering,  environmental, 
financial,  social,  and  other  safeguard  requirements  has  been  completed  to  satisfy  project 
preparation  requirements;  and  (v)  expenditures  must  have  been  incurred  before  the  loan 
effectiveness but, generally, no earlier than 12 months before signing of the loan agreement. In 
either instance, detailed assessments (due diligence) on each retroactive financing proposal must 
demonstrate that (i) the expenditures incurred are genuine, reasonable, and material to getting 
the project off the ground; and (ii) they were incurred for proper reasons, in a transparent manner 
over a reasonable period.  
B. 
Procurement of Goods, Works and Consulting Services 
50. 
All  procurement  of  goods  and  works  (including  consulting  services)  will  follow  ADB 
Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and Procurement Regulations for ADB 
Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time).38  
51. 
Open competitive bidding (OCB) using national advertising will be used for the majority of 
civil works and goods contracts. For the first package civil works and goods, regardless of the 
estimated  contract  amount,  the  invitations  for  bids,  bidding  documents,  bid  evaluation  reports, 
and  draft  negotiated  contracts  need  ADB’s  prior  review  and  approval.  For  the  subsequent 
nationally  advertised  OCB  packages,  invitations  for  bids,  bidding  documents,  bid  evaluation 
reports, and signed contracts provided they are consistent with previously approved documents 
will  not  require  ADB’s  prior  review.  However,  such  documents  will  be  subject  to  post  review 
sampling. The relevant sections of ADB’s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended from time to 
time) will be included in all procurement documents and contracts.39  
52. 
Before  the  start  of  any  procurement,  ADB  and  the  government  will  review  the  public 
procurement  laws  of  the  central  and  local  governments  to  ensure  consistency  with  ADB’s 
Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and Procurement Regulations for ADB 
Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time).  
All  consultants  will  be  recruited  according  to  ADB’s  Procurement  Policy  (2017,  as 
53. 
amended from time to time) and Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended 
from time to time).40  Estimated 206 person-months (16 international, 190 national) of consulting 
services are required to (i) facilitate project management and implementation; (ii) strengthen the 
institutional  and  operational  capacity  of  the  DCG  and  participating  implementing  agencies  on 
project management and implementation; and (iii) implement external monitoring for environment 
and resettlement issues. Consulting firms for project management and capacity development for 
flood  and  environmental  risk  management  will  be  engaged  using  the  quality-  and  cost-based 
selection  method  with  a  standard  quality:  cost  ratio  of  90:10  and  using  full  technical  proposal 
procedure. Qualified national institutes/firms will be engaged through consultants’ qualifications 
selection method to provide external environmental monitoring services and external resettlement 
monitoring  services.  Four  project  management  start-up  support  packages  will  engage  four 
individual consultants through individual consultant’s selection method.

Procurement of Goods, Works and Non-Consulting Services 
Comments 
The potential for attracting enough qualified bidders to ensure contracts 
are delivered on time was examined in the procurement assessment. It 
was concluded that the majority of civil works and goods contracts can 
be advertised nationally following the open competitive bidding 
procedures. 
ADB’s prior review applies to (i) the first OCB AN for works; (ii) the first 
OCB AN for goods; and (iii) packages estimated at $10 million or 
above. All other packages will be for post-review (sampling) by ADB.  
RFQ 
As per the PPRA, RFQ will be applied for small/simple contracts in the 
procurement of goods, works, and non-consulting services 
ADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  AN  =  advertised  nationally,  OCB  =  open  competitive  bidding,  PPRA  =  project 
procurement risk assessment, RFQ = request for quotations. 
  Note: Post review (sampling) will be conducted at annual project review missions by ADB or its consultants,or on an 
ad hoc basis when necessary. Each sample size should cover at least 20% of the total number of the post review 
(sampling)  contracts  awarded  before  the  initial  post  review  (sampling),  or  between  two  consecutive  post  reviews 
(sampling). Total sample size aggregated should capture contracts representing (i) about 30%–50% of total project 
value and (ii) about 20% of the total number of contracts identified for post review (sampling). It should ensure that, 
to the extent possible, all types of contracts are included in the sample.

Consultant's Terms of Reference 
60. 
In addition to the  consulting  services  financed  by  the  ADB  loan,  domestically  funded 
consulting services will also be recruited by the PMO and implementing agencies. The PMO in 
coordination with the implementing agencies will recruit a national tendering agency to provide 
tendering  support,  including  preparation  of  bidding  documents,  invitation  for  bids  and  bid 
evaluation reports, and engage domestic design institutes to carry out preliminary and detailed 
designs. Construction supervision engineers will also be recruited for overseeing and inspecting 
the construction sites to ensure compliance with national regulations, safety standards, and the 
ADB requirements. 
The PMO will be responsible for engaging the consulting services in accordance with 
61. 
ADB’s Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and Procurement Regulations 
for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time).  Indicative terms of reference for all 
the consulting services packages are shown in Appendix 4 and will be detailed by the project 
implementation support consultants during the project implementation.  
40 
A. 
Environment 
VII. 
SAFEGUARDS 
Environmental due diligence. The project was classified by ADB as Category B for 
62. 
environment.  A  project  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  including  an  environmental 
management plan (EMP) was prepared in compliance with ADB’s policies and requirements 
included in ADB’s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). The project IEE and EMP form a basis 
of the official loan agreement between ADB and the executing agency. The IEE concluded that 
full  and  effective  implementation  of  the  project  EMP,  together  with  the  training  and  project 
assurances, will minimize the environmental risks of the project and achieve compliance with 
the policy and regulatory standards applied in this project IEE. 
63. 
Environmental management plan.  The project EMP (Appendix 1 of the IEE) is to be 
implemented in all phases of the project – design, pre-construction, construction, and operation. 
The EMP is to ensure project compliance with PRC environmental laws and ADB’s Safeguard 
Policy  Statement  (2009).  The  EMP  contains:  (i)  objectives;  (ii)  roles  and  responsibilities;              
(iii) mitigation measures; (iv) inspection, monitoring, and reporting arrangements; (v) training 
and institutional strengthening; (vi) GRM; (vii) future public consultation; and (viii) a feedback 
and adjustment mechanism. 
64. 
EMP implementation. The DCG will be responsible for ensuring that the project will be 
designed, constructed, decommissioned, and operated in accordance with (i) the national and 
local  government  environmental,  health,  and  safety  laws,  regulations,  procedures,  and 
guidelines;  (ii)  the ADB’s  SPS,  and  (iii)  the  IEE  including  the  EMP.  The  executing  agency, 
through the PMO, holds final responsibility for implementation of and compliance with the EMP. 
The EMP will be implemented in all phases of the project (design, pre-construction, construction, 
and operation).  
65. 
For  preliminary  and  detailed  designs,  the  PMO  will  forward  the  EMP  to  the  design 
institutes  for  incorporating  mitigation  measures  into  the  detailed  designs.  The  EMP  will  be 
updated at the end of the detailed design, as needed. To ensure that bidders will respond to 
the  EMPs  provisions,  the  PMO  and  implementing  agencies  will  prepare  and  provide  the 
following  specification  clauses  for  incorporation  into  the  bidding  documents:  (i)  a  list  of 
environmental management requirements to be budgeted by the bidders in their proposals; (ii) 
environmental clauses for contractual terms and conditions; and (iii) domestic EIAs, and the 
project IEE including updated EMP for compliance. 
66. 
Capacity building. The PMO and implementing agencies have no previous experience 
with ADB-funded projects or safeguard requirements. To ensure effective implementation of the 
EMP, a capacity building program will be implemented on EMP implementation, supervision, 
reporting,  and  the  grievance  redress  mechanism  (GRM).  Training  will  be  provided  by  the 
individual  consultant  for  environment  for  project  implementation  startup  support,  the 
environment  specialist  in  the  project  management  support  consultant  team,  and  other 
consultants  in  the  team. Trainees  will  include  the  staff  of  the  PMO,  implementing  agencies, 
contractors, and construction supervision consultants. Training programs will cover adjustment 
and implementation of the EMP, GRM, environmental risks of the project, mitigation measures, 
monitoring, and reporting. 
67. 
Grievance  redress  mechanism.  A  project  specific  GRM  has  been  developed  in 
compliance with ADB’s SPS (2009) requirement to address environmental, health, safety, and 
social concerns associated with project. This complements the PRC’s national environmental 
complaint hotline (12369). The GRM is designed to achieve the following objectives: (i) provide 
channels  of  communication  for  local  villages  and  communities  to  raise  concerns  about 
environmental  and  social-related  grievances  which  might  result  from  the  project;  (ii)  prevent 
41 
and mitigate adverse environmental and social impacts to villages and communities caused by 
project construction and operation, including those associated with resettlement; (iii) improve 
mutual trust and respect and promote productive relationships between the project agencies 
and  local  villages  and  communities;  and  (iv)  build  village  and  community  acceptance  of  the 
project.  The  GRM  is  accessible  to  all  members  of  the  villages  and  communities,  including 
women, youth, minorities and poverty-stricken villagers and residents. Multiple points of entry 
are  available,  including  face-to-face  meetings,  written  complaints,  telephone  conversations,      
e-mail,  and  social  media.  The  details  of  the  GRM,  including  a  time-bound  flow  chart  of 
procedures, are included in the project EMP. 
68. 
Procedures  for  feedback  and  adjustment  of  the  EMP,  including  in  the  event  of 
non-compliance. Based on environmental inspection and monitoring reports, the PMO shall 
decide, in consultation with the LIEC, whether (i) further mitigation measures are required as 
corrective  actions,  or  (ii)  some  improvements  are  required  for  environmental  management 
practices. The effectiveness of mitigation measures and monitoring plans will be evaluated by 
a  feedback  reporting  system.  Adjustment  to  the  EMP  will  be  made,  if  necessary.  The  PMO 
Environmental  Officer  and  the  LIEC  will  play  critical  roles  in  the  feedback  and  adjustment 
mechanism. If during inspection and monitoring, substantial deviation from the EMP is observed 
or  any  changes  are  made  to  the  project  that  may  cause  substantial  adverse  environmental 
impacts or increase the number of affected people, then the PMO will immediately consult with 
ADB  and  form  an  environmental  assessment  team  to  conduct  additional  environmental 
assessment. If necessary, further public consultation will be undertaken. The revised domestic 
EIAs and IEE, including the EMP, will be submitted to ADB for review, appraisal, and public 
disclosure.  The  revised  EMP  will  be  passed  to  the  contractors,  CSCs  and  operators  of  the 
project facilities, for implementation. 
B. 
Land Acquisition and Resettlement 
Category  and  Impacts.  The  project  is  classified  as  Category  A  for  involuntary 
69. 
resettlement  due  to  significant  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  impacts.  The  project  will 
permanently occupy 479.43 ha of land area. Of this, 346.03 ha is existing state-owned land; 
and 133.4 ha collective land will be obtained through land acquisition. A total of 793 households 
with 3,023 persons will be affected by the project’s land acquisition and resettlement impacts.  
A  total  of  525  households  with  1,841  persons  will  be  physically  relocated  due  to  residential 
house demolition. Two agencies with 9 persons will be affected by demolition of non-residential 
structures. In addition, 196.87 ha land will be used temporarily during construction.   
70. 
Resettlement Plan. A resettlement plan (RP) has been prepared in accordance with 
ADB’s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  and  relevant  laws  and  regulations  of  the  PRC.  The  RP 
includes  adequate  measures  of  compensation,  resettlement,  and  rehabilitation  for  affected 
people. Surveys and consultations were undertaken with affected people in preparation of the 
RP during the project preparation. Affected people will be further consulted for updating and 
implementation of the RP during the project implementation. A grievance redress mechanism 
has been established and incorporated into the RP. The RP also includes measures of (i) the 
capacity building of the EA and IAs to implement the RP in compliance with ADB requirements; 
and (ii) internal and external monitoring and reporting on the RP implementation.  
71. 
Updating  Resettlement  Plan.  The  RP  will  be (i)  updated  based  on the  final  design, 
detailed measurement survey and census of affected persons, (ii) disclosed to affected persons, 
and (iii) submitted to ADB for review and approval prior to the award of civil works contract and 
commencement of land acquisition or house demolition. 
Implementation Arrangements. The DCG is the executing agency of the project and 
72. 
has established the PMO to be wholly responsible for comprehensive planning and decision-
making  for  the  project.  The  PMO  will  be  responsible  for  coordination  and  management  of 
42 
resettlement activities of the project. The Land and Resources Bureau, the House Acquisition 
Office of Dengzhou City, relevant town governments and village committees in the project area 
will assist in implementation of the RP. 
Capacity  Building.  The  executing  and  implementing  agencies  have  the  capacity  to 
73. 
implement domestically funded projects. Their capacity will be strengthened to implement the 
RP  in  compliance  with  ADB  requirements.  To  ensure  smooth  implementation,  the  staff  in 
charge  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  will  participate  in  training  on  resettlement 
implementation organized by the PMO. A resettlement start-up consultant will provide training 
in ADB’s policy requirements and will assist the implementing agencies to update and finalize 
the resettlement plan.  
Implementation  Schedule.  The  resettlement  implementation  schedule  has  been 
74. 
prepared and included in the RP.  A summary table below.

75.  Monitoring  and  Evaluation.  Provisions  of  both  internal  and  external  monitoring  is 
included in the RP. With assistance of project management support consultants, the PMO will 
prepare and submit semiannually the internal monitoring reports to ADB. Furthermore, PMO 
will  employ  an  external  resettlement  monitoring  institute  or  firm  to  (i)  monitor  and  evaluate 
resettlement progress and results; and (ii) submit semiannual monitoring reports to ADB during 
resettlement implementation. 
C. 
Indigenous Peoples/Ethnic Minorities 
76. 
The  project  is  categorized  as  B  for  the  Indigenous  Peoples  Safeguard.  There  are  8 
villages involving Hui ethnic minorities in the project area. The ethnic minorities are integrated 
with the mainstream society in terms of socioeconomic and livelihood systems, while they have 
different  religious  and  cultural  beliefs  and  practices.  To  ensure that  ethnic  minorities  benefit 
equitably  from  the  project  activities,  an  ethnic  minority  development  plan  (EMDP)  has  been 
prepared based on social analysis and consultations during the project preparation. The project 
will  strengthen  the  capacity  of  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies  to  implement  and 
monitor the EMDP during the project implementation.  
77. 
The  executing  and  implementing  agencies  will  implement  the  EMDP  with  help  of 
consultants.  ADB  loan  will  finance  the  costs  for  the  consultants.  The  project  will  further 
strengthen  the  capacity  of  the  DCG  and  implementing  agencies  through  training  and 
consultancy supports to implement the EMDP in line with ADB’s social safeguard requirements. 
With assistance project consultants and monitoring experts, the PMO will ensure (i) monitoring 
of the EMDP implementation and (ii) submit semi-annual monitoring reports to ADB on EMDP 
implementation (together with the resettlement monitoring report).  
78. 
Capacity  for  social  and  safeguard  measures.  The  executing  and  implementing 
agencies have experience in implementing domestic projects, but they do not have experience 
with  ADB-financed  projects.  To  implement  social  and  safeguard  measures  properly  and 
incompliance  with  ADB  requirements,  (i)  executing  and  implementing  agencies  will  each 
appoint  focal  social  and  safeguard  staff,  (ii)  project  implementation  support  consultants  will 
include social and safeguard specialists, (iii) staff of executing and implementing agencies will 
be trained on social and safeguard measures, and (iv) an external monitoring agency will be 
recruited for external monitoring of social safeguard plans. 
79. 
Grievance Redress Mechanism. A GRM has been developed in compliance with the 
SPS’s requirements to address environmental, health, safety, and social concerns associated 
with construction, operation, and land acquisition arrangements under the project. The details 
of the GRM, including a time-bound flow chart of procedures, are included in the EMP, EMDP, 
and RP. The complaint channels are slightly different for environmental and resettlement issues, 
but the PMO will maintain an integrated system to document, follow-up, and report on all cases.  
80. 
Prohibited investment activities. Pursuant to the SPS, ADB funds may not be applied 
to the activities described on the ADB Prohibited Investment Activities List set forth at Appendix 
5 of the SPS.

VIII.  GENDER AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS 
81. 
Poverty and Social. The project is classified general intervention for poverty reduction. 
The poverty and social analysis was undertaken based on intensive stakeholder consultations 
and socioeconomic surveys. It indicated that a total of 746,000 residents in 11 project towns, 
including  13,137  poor  people,  will  directly  benefit  from  the  project  through  reduced  water 
pollution,  improved  drinking  water  supply  system,  and  better  environment  and  ecological 
protection  in  the  Tuan  River  watershed.  Other  residents  in  Dengzhou  City  will  also  benefit 
indirectly from  improved  environment  and  ecology.  The  project  will  create  3,000  jobs  during 
project implementation and 150 jobs during operation. A social development action plan has 
been prepared based on the poverty and social analysis, with specific targets for the poor and 
low-income people. Consultations were undertaken with local residents and other stakeholders 
during  the  project  preparation.  A  consultation  and  participation  plan  for  the  project 
implementation stage has been included in relevant social and safeguard plans. 
82. 
Gender. The project is classified as effective gender mainstreaming, following ADB’s 
Guidelines  for  Gender  Mainstreaming  Categories  of  ADB  Projects  (2012).  The  project  will 
ensure women will participate and benefit equitably under each output. Women are expected 
to  benefit  from  increased  employment,  piped  water  supply  in  rural  areas,  improved  living 
environment, and better quality of life. A gender action plan (GAP) has been prepared based 
on  gender  analyses to  ensure that  the  project  contributes  to  improved  gender  equality.  The 
GAP includes the following key measures and targets for women: (i) equitable participation of 
women in decision-making during project design and implementation, with at least 40% women 
participants;  (ii)  training  and  capacity  building  of  staff  of  the  executing  and  implementing 
agencies to implement the GAP and related measures; (iii) priority employment opportunities 
for  women,  with  at  least  30%  women  employees  during  construction  and  40%  women 
employee during operation; (iv) participation of women in awareness raising activities as well 
as public hearings, with 40% women participants; (v) participation of women in decision making 
for the pilot community-based environment and ecology supervision program, with at least 40% 
women members in community groups; and (vi) ensuring women employees equitable access 
to  sanitation  facilities  and  health  education  (e.g.,  HIV/AIDS  awareness)  during  construction. 
Key gender targets have also been included in the design and monitoring framework.

B. 
Monitoring 
83. 
Project  performance  monitoring.  The  PMO  will  be  responsible  for  monitoring  and 
reporting on project performance. The basis for performance monitoring will be the design and 
monitoring framework (DMF), which identifies performance targets for the impact, outcome, and 
outputs of the project. By the loan effectiveness, the PMO will prepare a format of quarterly project 
progress reports acceptable to ADB; and make necessary arrangements for preparation of the 
reports,  including  a  flow  of  data  and  information  collection,  responsibility  definition  of  each  of 
relevant agencies, and reporting formats (from contractors to the  implementing agencies, from 
consultants to the PMO, from the implementing agencies to the PMO). Quarterly project progress 
reports  will  include  progress  of  the  overall  project  and  each  component;  status  of  consulting 
services  and  activities  performed  by  each  consultant;  information  on  training,  workshops,  and 
study tours conducted; status of land acquisition and resettlement based on internal monitoring; 
status  of  the  implementation  of  the  EMDP,  social  development  action  plan  (SDAP),  and  GAP; 
records  of  grievance  and  complaints;  project  performance  (achievement  of  each  performance 
indicator  against  the target);  and  particular  issues;  and,  overall  status  of  EMP  implementation, 
based on submission of semi-annual environmental monitoring reports (para. 84). 
84. 
At  the  beginning  of  the  project  implementation  stage,  the  PMO  will  develop  a  project 
performance management system (PPMS) to monitor the progress of the project in achieving the 
planned  outcome  and  outputs.  The  PPMS  will  be  developed  with  assistance  of  the  project 
implementation management consultant as one of its work tasks in accordance with ADBs policy 
requirements, including baseline setting, operational data collection, data analysis, and reporting.  
The PPMS will adopt indicators relating to the following aspects of the project: (i) Urban and rural 
water infrastructure in Dengzhou City improved; (ii) Ecological zones in Han River restored, (ii) 
Water  resources  management  capacity  enhanced.  The  PMO  will  assign  staff,  or  contract 
consultants, to collect baseline and progress data at the requisite time intervals to be used in the 
PPMS. The PMO will be responsible for analyzing and consolidating reported data and reporting 
outcomes to ADB through semiannual progress reports. 
85. 
By collecting data from the sources identified in the design and monitoring framework, the 
PMO will be able to report the performance of the project on an annual basis. Specific reporting 
requirements will be set out in the loan and project agreements between ADB and the Government. 
The PMO will collect the data, calculate the indicators, analyze the results, and prepare a brief 
report describing the extent to which the project is generating the intended outputs and outcomes. 
The relevance and practicability of data collection for indicators will be confirmed with the PMO 
and IAs. Meanwhile, the agreed socioeconomic and environmental indicators to be used will be 
further enhanced to measure project impacts. The PMO and implementing agencies will (i) refine 
and integrate the PPMS framework at the start of project implementation; (ii) confirm that targets 
are achievable; (iii) develop recording, monitoring, and reporting arrangements; and (iv) establish 
systems and procedures no later than six months after project inception. 
86. 
Promptly after physical completion of the project, but in any event not later than 6 months 
thereafter or such later date as ADB may agree for this purpose, the PMO will prepare and submit 
to ADB  a  project  completion  report,  in  such  form  and  in  such  detail  as ADB  shall  reasonably 
request,  on  the  implementation  and  evaluation  of  the  project,  including  project  description, 
evaluation of design and implementation, evaluation of performance, and overall assessment and 
recommendations. 
87. 
Compliance  monitoring.  During  project  implementation,  the  executing  agency,  PMO, 
and consultants will conduct compliance monitoring, and submit reports and information to ADB 
55 
concerning  the  use  of  the  loan  proceeds,  project  implementation,  the  implementing  agency’s 
project implementation performance, compliance of loan and project covenants under the project, 
and will take necessary remedial actions for any non-compliance. The compliance status of the 
covenants  will  be  reported  in  the  quarterly  progress  reports  by  the  PMO.  ADB  will  verify  the 
compliance by reviewing quarterly project progress reports, communicating with the PMO, and/or 
conducting review missions.  
88. 
Environmental safeguard monitoring. The project monitoring program focuses on the 
environment in the project areas of influence. The environmental monitoring program is included 
in  the  project  EMP,  including  parameters,  time  and  frequency,  implementing  and  supervising 
agencies, and estimated costs. Three types of monitoring will be conducted in accordance with 
the EMP: (i) internal monitoring, to be conducted by the implementing agencies and construction 
supervision consultants (CSCs); (ii) external monitoring of air, water, noise and soil standards, to 
be conducted by local environment monitoring agencies (EMA) contracted by the PMO; and (iii) 
compliance  monitoring  to  be  conducted  by  consultants  (environment  specialists)  for  project 
management supports to ensure the EMP is being implemented. Monitoring shall comply with the 
PRC standards for environmental monitoring. ADB will oversee the compliance on the basis of 
semiannual environmental monitoring reports provided by the PMO and review missions. 
Internal  environmental  monitoring.  During  construction, 
89. 
the 
implementing  agencies  will  be  responsible  for  conducting  internal  environmental  monitoring  in 
accordance with the monitoring plan. Results will be reported through the CSC monthly reports 
to the implementing agencies and PMO. 
the  CSCs  and 
External monitoring. PMO will contract one certificated EMA to conduct environmental 
90. 
monitoring in accordance with the monitoring programs specified in the EMP. Monitoring will be 
conducted during construction and operational periods, until a project completion report is issued. 
Semiannual  monitoring  reports  will  be  prepared  by  the  EMA  and  submitted  to  the  PMO  and 
implementing agencies.  
91. 
EMP compliance monitoring. The LIEC will review the project progress and compliance 
with  the  EMP  based  on  field  visits,  and  the  review  of  the  environmental  monitoring  reports 
provided by the EMAs. The findings of the LIEC will be reported to ADB through the semiannual 
EMP  monitoring  and  progress  reports.  The  reports  will  include  (i)  progress  made  in  the  EMP 
implementation,  (ii)  overall  effectiveness  of  the  EMP  implementation  (including  public  and 
occupational health and safety), (iii) environmental monitoring and compliance, (iv) institutional 
strengthening  and  training,  (v)  public  consultation  (including  GRM),  and  (vi)  any  problems 
encountered during construction and operation, and the relevant corrective actions undertaken. 
The LIEC will help the PMO prepare the reports and submit to ADB for disclosure; and will assist 
the  PMO  for  local  disclosure  of  the  reports  e.g.  on  the  website  of  the  local  ecology  and 
environment bureau.  
92. 
Environmental  acceptance  reporting.  Following  the  PRC  Regulation  on  Project 
Completion Environmental Audit (Ministry of Environmental Protection, 2001), within three months 
after  the  completion  of  major  components,  an  environmental  acceptance  report  for  each 
subproject  shall  be  (i)  prepared  by  the  implementing  agencies  or  capable  environmental 
monitoring institute in accordance with the PRC Guideline on Project Completion Environmental 
Audit  (2017);  and  (ii)  finally  reported  to  ADB  through  the  semiannual  EMP  monitoring  and 
progress reporting process. The environmental acceptance reports of the component completions 
will indicate the timing, extent, effectiveness of completed mitigation and of maintenance, and the 
needs for additional mitigation measures and monitoring during operations. 
56 
93. 
Land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  Internal  and  external  monitoring  of  the  RP 
implementation will be conducted. Monitoring methodologies are specified in the RP. The PMO 
and implementing agencies assisted by the project management consultants will carry out internal 
monitoring  and  reporting  to  ensure  compliance  with  the  provisions  of  the  RP.  The  PMO, 
implementing agencies, and consultants for project management supports will develop a set of 
supervision milestones in accordance with the RP to ensure timely and effective implementation 
of resettlement activities. The PMO will submit internal monitoring reports semiannually to ADB. 
94. 
An external monitoring agency acceptable to ADB will be engaged by the PMO by January 
2020  prior  to  commencement  of  land  acquisition.  The  external  monitoring  agency  will  conduct 
external M&E semiannually during the implementation of land acquisition and resettlement and 
conduct follow-up evaluation semiannually for two years after the completion of land acquisition 
and resettlement. The cost of the external resettlement M&E will be funded from the ADB loan. 
External resettlement M&E reports will be submitted semi-annually to ADB. 
Gender  and  social  dimensions  monitoring.  Monitoring  indicators  for  the  GAP  and 
95. 
SDAP  will  be  incorporated  into  the  PPMS.  The  PMO  and  implementing  agencies  will  be 
responsible for establishing and coordinating regular monitoring and evaluation.  
The regular project progress reports to ADB will include, at least semiannually, reporting 
96. 
on  GAP  and  SDAP  progress.  Assistance  will  be  provided  to  the  executing  agency  and 
implementing  agencies  by  the  project  consultant  who  will  help  to  set  up  effective  monitoring 
systems and work with the focal points and implementing agencies to ensure implementation of 
the GAP and SDAP. The project’s consultants will assist the PMO and implementing agencies to 
collect data for qualitative analysis to assess the effectiveness of the GAP and SDAP. This will 
include an end-of-project survey of a small number of sample beneficiaries and/or focus group 
discussions with beneficiaries to obtain qualitative information on the improvements to their lives 
as a result of the project.  
C. 
Evaluation 
In addition to regular monitoring, the project performance will be reviewed at least once a 
97. 
year  jointly  by  ADB  and  DCG.  The  review  will  assess  the  implementation  performance  and 
achievement of project outcomes and outputs, assess the financial progress, identify issues and 
constraints affecting implementation, and work out a time-bound action plan for resolutions. ADB 
and DCG will undertake a midterm review to assess implementation status and take appropriate 
measures - including modification of scope and implementation arrangements, and reallocation 
of loan proceeds, as appropriate - to achieve the project impact and outcome. Within 6 months of 
physical completion of the project, DCG will submit a project completion report to ADB. 
D. 
Reporting 
98. 
The  DCG  and  PMO  will  provide  ADB  with  (i)  quarterly  progress  reports  in  a  format 
consistent  with  ADB's  project  performance  reporting  system;  (ii)  consolidated  annual  reports 
including  (a)  progress  achieved  by  output  as  measured  through  the  indicator's  performance 
targets,  (b)  key  implementation  issues  and  solutions,  (c)  updated  procurement  plan  and  (d) 
updated  implementation  plan  for  next  12  months;  and (iii)  a  project  completion  report  within  6 
months of physical completion of the project. To ensure projects continue to be both viable and 
sustainable,  project  accounts  and  the  project  audited  financial  statements,  together  with  the 
associated auditor's report, should be adequately reviewed. 
57 
99.  Within 6 months after project completion, the PMO will prepare a project completion report, 
in  coordination  with  the  implementing  agencies  and  DCG,  and  submit  to  ADB,  evaluating  the 
performance of the PMO and IAs; summarizing the loan funds utilization, project implementation, 
attainment of project impact, outcome, outputs, implementation experience, project performance, 
actual  costs  incurred,  benefits,  and  other  information  requested  by  ADB;  and  assessing  the 
accomplishment of the purposes of the loan.

102.  Environment.  Meaningful  consultation,  participation  and  information  disclosure  was 
conducted  during  project  preparation.  Information  disclosure  and  public  consultation  included 
newspaper disclosure; informal communication with key stakeholders, including residents, local 
authorities  and  sector  specific  institutions  and  authorities;  questionnaire  surveys;  and  wider 
stakeholder  meetings  attended  by  affected  people  and  other  concerned  stakeholders.  A  GRM 
has  been  defined  to  address  community  concerns,  reduce  risks,  and  assist  the  project  in 
maximizing environmental and social benefits. Meaningful consultation will continue throughout 
project implementation, especially prior to and during civil works. Planning for public consultations 
will ensure that environmental and social safeguard requirements are discussed. 
103. 
Involuntary  resettlement.  All  of  the  affected  households  were  involved  in  the  project 
impact and socioeconomic survey. Through meetings, interviews, focus group discussions, public 
consultation workshops, and community consultation meetings; local representatives participated 
in  the  planning,  and  their  concerns  have  been  integrated  into  the  RP.  The  RP  has  also  been 
posted  on  the  ADB  website.  Resettlement  information  booklets  were  distributed  to  affected 
households. The booklets contain information such as the affected project areas, implementation 
progress of and procedures for land acquisition and relocation, compensation standards for land 
acquisition and house demolition, relocation assistance, livelihood restoration strategy, and post-
resettlement  supports.  Each  implementing  agency  includes  a  full-time  resettlement  and  social 
officer for supervision of implementation, continued public consultation, monitoring of progress, 
and  response  to  grievances.  The  grievance  redress  procedures  have  been  established  and 
explanations have been included in the resettlement information booklets. 
104.  Ethnic  minority  development  plan,  social  development  action  plan  and  gender 
action plan.  Consultations with communities were conducted and will be continued during the 
implementation  of  the  EMDP,  SDAP,  and  GAP,  not  only  to  inform  people  about  project 
components  or  activities,  but  also  to  enable people to  ask  questions, make  suggestions,  state 
preferences, and/or express concerns. Special attention will be paid to the participation of women, 
ethnic minorities, and other vulnerable groups, such as the poor. Public hearings will be held for 
any proposed adjustments in the water supply tariff, with attendance of adequate representation 
of the poor, women, and ethnic minorities. 
105.  Public Disclosure. ADB, the DCG including the PMO, and implementing agencies will 
disclose  relevant  project  information  to  the  public  and  interested  parties.  This  includes  the 
information regarding the overall project and environment and social safeguards. The information 
disclosure measures for different stakeholders are described in Table 17. 
106.  A consultation and participation plan has been prepared for the concerned stakeholders 
within  the  project  areas  as  required  by  ADB  to  ensure  inclusiveness,  transparency,  and 
meaningful consultation and participation of concerned stakeholders for the Project. The purpose 
of this plan is to engage the stakeholders in meaningful consultation and decision-making process; 
inform  them  about  the  project  and  consult  them  on  various  issues  relevant  to  the 
project/subcomponents and activities during project design and implementation. Consultation and 
participation  serves  as  a  venue  for  the  key  stakeholders  (i.e.,  government  agencies,  project 
beneficiaries, and women) to be informed about the project, clarify and express feedbacks, issues 
and concerns, and suggestions; learn how they will be benefited by the projects; participate in 
decision-making and take action and/or be involved during the design, project implementation and 
operation/maintenance stages. The plan is in Table 19.

ANTICORRUPTION POLICY  
107.  ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any violations of the 
Anticorruption  Policy  relating  to  the  project. 41  All  contracts  financed  by  ADB  shall  include 
provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the 
executing agency and all project contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers. 
Individuals and/or entities on ADB’s anticorruption debarment list are ineligible to participate in 
ADB-financed activity and may not be awarded any contracts under the project.42 
108.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  are  included  in  the  loan  and  project 
agreements and the bidding documents for the project. 
XI. 
ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISM 
109.  People  who  are,  or  may  in the  future  be,  adversely  affected  by  the  project may  submit 
complaints  to  ADB’s  Accountability  Mechanism.  The  Accountability  Mechanism  provides  an 
independent forum and process whereby people adversely affected by ADB-assisted projects can 
voice,  and  seek  a  resolution  of  their  problems,  as  well  as  report  alleged  violations  of  ADB’s 
operational  policies  and  procedures.  Before  submitting  a  complaint  to  the  Accountability 
Mechanism, affected people should make an effort in good faith to solve their problems by working 
with  the  concerned  ADB  operations  department.    Only  after  doing  that,  and  if  they  are  still 
dissatisfied, should they approach the Accountability Mechanism.43 
XII. 
RECORD OF PAM CHANGES  
110.  All revisions and/or updates during the course of implementation should be retained in this 
section to provide a chronological history of changes to implemented arrangements recorded in 
the PAM, including revision to contract awards and disbursement s-curves.

INDICATIVE TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR CONSULTING SERVICES FOR 
PACKAGE CS-08: ASSET MANAGEMENT FOR WATER SUPPLY AND WASTEWATER 
TREATMENT SYSTEMS 
A. 
Background 
1. 
With the rapid development of China’s economy, the PRC State Council has set up a goal 
for building up eco-friendly societies across the country to promote sustainable development and 
to adapt to the economic and social changes. 
2. 
The  Project  will  serve  as  a  demonstration  example  in  China  on  integrated  urban-rural 
development and management, which can be replicated to other municipalities and provinces to 
other  regions  of  the  country.  The  proposed  Dengzhou  Ecological  Protection  and  Integrated 
Rehabilitation  Project  includes  three  main  outputs:  (i)  Urban  and  rural  water  infrastructure  in 
Dengzhou City improved; and ii) Ecological zones in Han River restored; and (iii) Water resources 
management capacity enhanced. 
3. 
The Project is located in an integrated urban-rural development area within Dengzhou City, 
Henan  Province.  Dengzhou  City  is  a  prefecture-level  city  located  in  the  southwestern  area  of 
Henan Province. 
4. 
Strategic,  risk-based  asset  management  practices  are  important  during  an  era  of 
infrastructure replacement. Asset management plans can be developed to document how groups 
of  assets  will  be  managed  to  provide  a  satisfactory  service  level  in  a  sustainable  and 
environmentally  responsible  manner.  A  critical  component  of  the  asset  management  structure 
involves risk management, where information on the physical condition of existing infrastructure 
is collected and recorded. Although many municipalities have traditionally relied solely on expert 
opinion when determining asset condition, a wide range of advanced inspection technology and 
condition  assessment  tools  are  now  available  for  those  municipalities  seeking  accurate  and 
reliable  condition  data.  The  ability  for  a  utility  to  effectively  manage  its  water  and  wastewater 
infrastructure assets will largely be controlled by its ability to organize large amounts of data. 
5. 
The  key  objective  of  the  consulting  service  is  to  replace  the  conventional  asset 
management practice by a modern one with the use of (a) digital asset inventory and records on 
geographic  information  systems,  (b)  interactive  service  delivery  system  and  automatic  water 
leakage  detection  system,  (c)  decision  support  system  for  asset  acquisition  and  disposal,  (d) 
guidelines and trainings for asset criticality and risk assessment, and (e) performance indicators. 
The asset management in this document does not only for the components implemented under 
the  project  but  for  the  entire  DCG  asset  management.  However,  the  consulting  service  will 
demonstrate the system for the selected project components that includes system development, 
trial  applications,  and  regular  application  of  the  system  throughout  the  project  implementation 
period that also covers certain time of project operation. The consulting service will also help build 
the capacity of DCG in asset management and establishing decision support mechanism.   
B.  
Asset Management of Water Supply Systems 
Project Content and Objectives 
6. 
At present, urban water supply is managed by Dengzhou Water Supply Company, while 
the water supply plants in Dengzhou City are separately managed by the Water Resources Bureau. 
29 
Rural water supply plants (WSP) are basically run by the water resources organizations, which 
means  the  organization  that  constructed  the  WSP  will  keep  managing  and  operating  it.  Rural 
WSPs are operated by the township government. However, a document has been published by 
the provincial government recently. In the future, the township water supply plants will be planned, 
invested and operated by the municipal government. 
7. 
In  this  project,  innovative  asset  management  system  will  be  developed  to  register  the 
inventory, record the performance status, and operation and maintenance needs of the assets. 
Management information systems and GIS will be utilized simultaneously to establish an asset 
management system to effectively track water supply assets. The structure design of GIS asset 
registration system is divided into two subsystems of ground and underground assets. The ground 
assets  include  water  source,  raw  water  reservoir,  water  plant  facilities,  pumping  station,  water 
supply  tank  and  various  electromechanical  equipment,  while  underground  assets  include: 
underground water pipe network and related facilities. 
8. 
To develop an effective and sustainable asset management program for Dengzhou city 
through the project, by improving existing practices and performance to ensure service standards 
(as reported in regional benchmarking studies) are achieved and maintained. 
9. 
Key advantages of the asset management system include reduction on unacceptably high 
levels of nonrevenue water, while Non-revenue water is low in PRC by international standards, it 
is  higher  for  Henan  province,  at  an  average  of  38%.1 Other  benefits  include  planned,  timely 
replacement  and  maintenance  of  existing  assets,  improved  services  levels,  accurate  tariffs 
projections and better cost recovery. 
10. 
A  newly  established  water  supply  company  will  be  responsible  for  the  operation  and 
maintenance  of  the  project  assets,  the  preservation  and  appreciation  of  the  assets,  asset 
registration and asset database structure, to register the inventory, record the performance status, 
and operation and maintenance needs of the assets. Management information systems and GIS 
system  will  be  utilized  simultaneously  to  establish  an  asset  management  system  to  effectively 
track water treatment assets. 
The total investment of the asset management system is roughly estimated to be 700,000 
11. 
RMB. 
12. 
The objectives of the system are: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
To  realize  the  dynamic  management  of  the  newly  constructed  water  supply 
pipelines; 
To provide the data support for pipeline construction and inspection management;

40.  Maintenance  system  is  composed  of  handheld  terminal  (M/S)  and  monitoring  terminal 
(B/S), which are integrated and complementary. 
Handheld terminal (Mobile/Server, M/S) 
Common  tools:  Using  the  handheld  terminal,  basic  operations  such  as  information 
41. 
browsing, map locating, spatial query, distance/area measurement can be carried out. 
42. 
Task  list:  New  maintenance  tasks  can  be  automatically  obtained  and  alerted.  For 
maintenance  tasks  issued  by  the  monitoring  terminal,  maintenance  personnel  can  use  the 
handheld terminal to view the specific spatial location. 
43. 
Task details: For the tasks in the task list, details of the task can be clicked to view. 
34 
Task processing: For each task, maintenance personnel can use the handheld terminal 
44. 
to process "receiving" or "withdrawing" orders. 
Field  feedback:  For  the  tasks  received,  the  maintenance  personnel  can  report  the 
45. 
situation of the site using the handheld terminal when they arrive at the site. 
Handling feedback: The handheld terminal can be timely used for the feedback of specific 
46. 
processing situation, uploading live photos, audio and other multimedia information. 
GPS status: Maintenance personnel can report their GPS spatial position information in 
47. 
real time when processing tasks. 
Monitoring terminal (Browser/Server, B/S) 
48. 
Graphic browsing: Via monitoring terminal, the pipeline network of the whole area based 
on  electronic  map  can  be  viewed,  and  the  spatial  distribution  of  maintenance  engineering, 
maintenance personnel and other information can be visualized. 
49. 
Event Management: The monitoring terminal of the system can visually display the basic 
information of all types of maintenance events in the form of lists and can also display the classified 
lists per the progress of events. 
50. 
Emergency  repair  management:  For  the  emergency  repair  events  distributed  by 
dispatchers,  the  monitoring  terminal  can  display  visually  in  the  form  of  a  list  and  indicate  the 
processing  status  of  each  event.  It  can  also  track,  manage  and  assess  the  events,  alarm  and 
remind the tasks that exceed the time limit, and display graphics per the status of the tasks. 
51.  Maintenance: Supervisors can use the system monitoring terminal to send maintenance 
tasks to the maintenance personnel's handheld system and track the implementation process and 
completion of the task in real time. 
52. 
Statistical  analysis:  Not  only  can  the  trend  of  reporting  different  types  of  events  be 
analyzed according to the historical situation of maintenance events, but also the overall analysis 
of the incident execution rate and effective mileage of inspectors can be made.

•  Develop  monitoring  mechanism  for  fixed  assets,  including  condition  monitoring  (simple 
condition  monitoring  illustrated  in  Table  2  and  incidental  events  recording.  To  be  more 
specific: 
38 
o  Check CCTV video playback regularly to prevent video settings from changing due 
to incidental events. 
o  Check the CCTV video playback regularly to find out if there is a time period when 
the video is not recorded, so as to find out the problem, and prevent the loss caused 
by finding out no video was recorded during the incidental event happened. 
o  Check whether the CCTV is recording regularly to prevent the software database 
from being damaged by sudden power failure. If the database is damaged and not 
repaired, the situation that the video cannot be recorded will occur. In this case the 
database needs to be repaired manually. 
o  Check the operating system log regularly to prevent hard disk damage, leading to 
the system unable to record. 
•  Develop asset life cycle decision making (opex and capex strategies) based fixed asset 
register

The  process requires  commitment  from  management.  It  should be  based on  a detailed 
diagnostic  study  of  existing  systems.  The  consultant’s  outputs  are  dependent  upon  the  utility 
providing an implementation team and sustaining the team for the duration of the implementation 
period. They also depend on the acquisition of new software or modification of existing software, 
including the geographic information systems (GIS), needed to underpin reliable asset registers 
and the asset management modules referred to in the implementation plan. 
65. 
As an alternative to a full technical assistance project, a pilot study could be conducted to 
provide  at  least  a  diagnostic  report,  which  could  then  be  used  to  frame  a  more  substantive 
assistance project.
