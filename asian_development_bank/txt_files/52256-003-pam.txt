Activity Administration Manual Purpose and Process 
1.  The  activity  administration  manual  (AAM)  for  an  activity  subgrant  under  a  small  expenditure 
financing facility (SEFF) is an abridged version of the regular AAM of the Asian Development 
Bank  (ADB)  and  describes  the  essential  administrative  and  management  requirements  to 
implement  the  SEFF  Activity  on  time,  within budget,  and  in accordance with  the  policies and 
procedures of the government  and  ADB. The  AAM  should include references  to all  available 
templates and instructions either through linkages to relevant URLs or directly incorporated in 
the AAM.  
2.  The Ministry of Finance as the borrower/recipient and the Department of Drinking Water Supply 
and Sewerage Development (DDWSSD) under the State Agency for Water Resources under 
the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic as the activity executing agency are wholly responsible 
for the activity subgrant, as agreed jointly between the borrower and ADB, and in accordance 
with  the  policies  and  procedures  of  the  government  and  ADB.  ADB  staff  is  responsible  for 
supporting  implementation  including  compliance  by  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  DDWSSD  of 
their obligations and responsibilities for SEFF Activity implementation in accordance with ADB’s 
policies and procedures. 
3.  The borrower and ADB shall agree to the AAM and ensure consistency with the short form legal 
agreement. In the  event  of  any  discrepancy  or  contradiction  between the  AAM  and the grant 
agreement, the provisions of the grant agreement shall prevail. 
4.  After  ADB’s  management  approval  of  the  activity  subgrant  summary  report,  changes  in 
implementation  arrangements  are  subject  to  agreement  and  approval  pursuant  to  relevant 
government  and  ADB  administrative  procedures  (including  the  Project  Administration 
Instructions) and upon such approval, they will be subsequently incorporated in the AAM. 
The key  implementation  activities,  including  monthly  or quarterly  small  expenditure financing facility  (SEFF)  implementation 
1. 
activities,  are  updated  annually  and  submitted  to  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  with  updated  contract  and  disbursement 
projections for the following year. The implementation schedule is prepared per subgrant activity (Table 1).

COSTS AND FINANCING 
A. 
Cost Estimates Preparation and Revisions  
2. 
The  cost  estimates  have  been  prepared  in  July  2019  based  on  market  prices  for  civil 
works. The cost estimates will be updated upon finalization of the detailed engineering design of 
the chlorine neutralization unit at Osh-Plotina water treatment plant (WTP) civil works package in 
October 2019. 
B. 
3. 
Key Assumptions 
The following key assumptions underpin the cost estimates and financing plan: 
(i) 
Price contingencies used an average of 1.6% on foreign exchange costs and 4.4% 
on  local  currency  costs  and  include  provisions  for  potential  exchange  rate 
fluctuations under the assumption of a purchasing power parity exchange rate. The 
exchange rate used as of 13 August 2019 is Som69.8367= $1.00.  
Price contingencies and exchange rates based on expected cumulative inflation 
over the implementation period are as follows:

FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT FOR ACTIVITY SUBGRANT1 
6. 
The DDWSSD within the State Agency for Water Resources under the Government of the 
Kyrgyz Republic will be the implementing agency (IA). A Project Management Office (PMO) will 
be established to manage day-to-day project implementation. Reporting directly to the DDWSSD, 
the PMO’s responsibilities will include procurement, contract and financial management, project 
administration, and safeguards compliance and reporting. The IA will be responsible for project 
and safeguards compliance coordination. 
A. 
Financial Management Assessment for SEFF Activity  
7. 
The project financial management assessment (FMA) was conducted in June 2018 for the 
Issyk-Kul Wastewater Management Project (50176-002) with same Implementing agency (IA) in 
accordance with ADB’s Guidelines for the Financial Management and Analysis of Projects and 
the Financial Due Diligence: A Methodology Note. The FMA considered the capacity of DDWSSD, 
including funds-flow arrangements, staffing, accounting and financial reporting systems, financial 
information systems,  internal  and  external  auditing  arrangements,  and  the  use  of statement  of 
expenditure (SOE) procedures with the terms described. The financial management risk for the 
implementing  agency  for  the  first  activity  is  substantial.  Mitigating  measures  have  been 
incorporated under the approved Issyk-Kul Wastewater Management Project that will ensure that 
the Department of Drinking Water Supply and Sewerage Development has (i) adequate staff to 
handle  project  financial  management,  although  they  are  unfamiliar  with  ADB’s  disbursement 
guidelines  and  procedures;  (ii)  an  adequate  accounting  system  that  integrates  project-specific 
accounting, budgeting, auditing, and reporting requirements; on top of (iii) the experience as an 
executing  agency  for  projects  financed  by  other  international  financial  institutions,  with 
responsibilities for grant disbursements and advance account management; and (iv) capacity for 
internal  audit.  The  financial  management  action  plan  (FMAP)  set  on  the  June  2018  financial 
management  assessment,  is  in progress,  consultants  are being recruited,  and by  the  time the 
SEFF becomes effective, capacity is expected to be in place and short-term initial action to be 
implemented.  
8. 
The key identified financial management risks are in the areas of (i) staffing, (ii) internal 
audit, (iii) external audit, and (iv) reporting and monitoring. The FMAP discussed with the EA and 
the IA and its PMO addresses these risk areas is in Table 8.

Disbursement 
1. 
Disbursement Arrangements for ADB Funds 
The  SEFF  Activity  grant  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  Loan 
9. 
Disbursement  Handbook  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time),3  and  detailed  arrangements 
agreed upon between the government and ADB. Online training for project staff on disbursement 
policies and procedures is available.4 Project staff are encouraged to avail of this training to help 
ensure efficient disbursement and fiduciary control. 
Advance fund procedure. Separate advance account will be established and maintained 
10. 
by IA at a commercial bank to facilitate disbursements. The currency of the advance account is 
the United States dollar. The advance account is to be used exclusively for ADB’s share of eligible 
expenditures. The borrower/EA is accountable and responsible for appropriate bank selection for 
the  advance  account.  The  IA  who  administers  the  advance  account  is  accountable  and 
responsible for proper use of advances to the advance account. IA will establish the account in 
its name and shall be accountable and responsible for proper use of advances to the advance 
account.  
11. 
The total outstanding advance to the advance account should not exceed the estimate of 
ADB’s  share  of  expenditures  to  be  paid  through  the  advance  account  for  the  forthcoming  6 
months.  The  ADB’s  project  team  responsible  for  activity  administration  will  review  the 
reasonableness of the 6-month estimates provided by IA. The PMO under IA administering the 
advance account may request for initial and additional advances to the advance account based 
on an estimate of expenditure sheet setting out the estimated expenditures to be financed through 
3   The handbook is available electronically from the ADB website (http://www.adb.org/documents/ loan-disbursement-
handbook 
4   Disbursement eLearning. http://wpqr4.adb.org/disbursement_elearning  
14 
the account for the forthcoming 6 months.5 Supporting documents should be submitted to ADB or 
retained by the IA in accordance with ADB’s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended 
from time to time) when liquidating or replenishing the advance account. 
Statement of expenditure procedure for SEFF Activity.6 The SOE procedure may be 
12. 
used  for  reimbursement  of  eligible  expenditures  or  liquidation  of  advances  to  the  advance 
account(s).  Supporting  documents  and  records  for  the  expenditures  claimed  under  the  SOE 
should be maintained and made readily available for review by ADB's disbursement and review 
missions, upon ADB's request for submission of supporting documents on a sampling basis, and 
for independent audit. Any individual payments to be reimbursed or liquidated under SOE will not 
exceed  the  equivalent  of  $200,000.  Reimbursement  and  liquidation  of  individual  payments  in 
excess  of  the  SOE  ceiling  should  be  supported  by  full  documentation  when  submitting  the 
withdrawal application to ADB. 
13. 
Before  the  submission  of  the  first  withdrawal  application  for  an  activity,  the  borrower 
should  submit  to  ADB  sufficient  evidence  of  the  authority  of  the  person(s)  who  will  sign  the 
withdrawal applications on behalf of the government, together with the authenticated specimen 
signatures of each authorized person. The minimum value per withdrawal application is stipulated 
in the Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time). Individual payments 
below such amount should be paid (i) by the implementing agency and subsequently claimed to 
ADB  through  reimbursement,  or  (ii)  through  the  advance  fund  procedure,  unless  otherwise 
accepted  by  ADB.  The  borrower  should  ensure  sufficient  category  and  contract  balances  before 
requesting disbursements. Use of ADB’s Client Portal for Disbursements system is encouraged for 
submission of withdrawal applications to ADB.7   
14. 
Direct payment procedure. The PMO will submit direct payment withdrawal application 
to ADB if the PMO could not pay the invoice from the advance account due to specific reasons 
outside the control of the PMO. 
2. 
Disbursement Arrangements for Counterpart Fund 
15. 
The PMO will be responsible for (i) preparing disbursement projections, and (ii) requesting 
budgetary allocations for counterpart funds. If the government will finance local taxes and duties 
under the project, describe how the government will exempt, or provide funds to pay, such local 
taxes  and  duties.  See  Appendixes  4C  of  ADB’s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2017,  as 
amended from time to time) for further guidance on the proper presentation of local taxes and 
duties  financing  in  the  detailed  cost  estimate  by  financier  and  allocation  table  in  the  grant 
agreement. 
C. 
Accounting 
16. 
The implementation agency will maintain, or cause to be maintained, separate books and 
records by funding source for all expenditures incurred under the activity following accrual-based 
accounting following the equivalent national accounting standards. The implementation agency 
5  Estimate  of  Expenditure  sheet  is  available  in  Appendix  8A  of  ADB’s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2017,  as 
amended from time to time).  
6   SOE forms are available in Appendix 7B and 7D of ADB’s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from 
time to time). 
7   The CPD facilitates online submission of withdrawal application to ADB, resulting in faster disbursement. The forms 
to be completed by the Borrower are available online at https://www.adb.org/documents/client-portal-disbursements-
guide.     
15 
will  prepare  consolidated  project  financial  statements  for  the  activity  in  accordance  with  the 
government's accounting laws and regulations which are consistent with international accounting 
principles and practices. 
The implementing agency will maintain separate accounts and records by funding source 
17. 
for  all  expenditures  incurred  within  the  activity,  following  either  cash  or  accrual  basis  of 
accounting. The activity accounts will follow international accounting standards. 
D. 
Auditing and Public Disclosure 
18. 
The implementing agency will cause the detailed activity financial statements to be audited 
in accordance with International Standards on Auditing, by an independent auditor acceptable to 
ADB. The audited financial statements together with the auditor’s opinion will be presented in the 
English language to ADB within 6 months from the end of the fiscal year by the EA.  
19. 
The audited entity financial statements, together with the auditor’s report and management 
letter, will be submitted in the English language to ADB within 1 month after their approval by the 
relevant authority. 
20. 
The audit report for the activity financial statements will include a management letter and 
auditor’s opinions, which cover (i) whether the project financial statements present an accurate 
and fair view or are presented fairly, in all material respects, in accordance with the applicable 
financial  reporting  standards;  (ii)  whether  the  proceeds  of  the  grant  were  used  only  for  the 
purpose(s) of the activity; and (iii) whether the borrower, EA, or IA was in compliance with the 
financial covenants contained in the short form agreements (where applicable). 
21. 
Compliance with financial reporting and auditing requirements will be monitored by review 
missions and during normal program supervision, and followed up regularly with all concerned, 
including the external auditor.  
27. 
The  government,  Ministry  of  Finance,  and  DDWSD  have  been  made  aware  of  ADB’s 
approach to delayed submission, and the requirements for satisfactory and acceptable quality of 
the audited project financial statements.8 ADB reserves the right to require a change in the auditor 
(in  a  manner  consistent  with  the  constitution  of  the  borrower),  or  for  additional  support  to  be 
provided to the auditor, if the audits required are not conducted in a manner satisfactory to ADB, 
or if the audits are substantially delayed. ADB reserves the right to verify the activity's financial 
accounts to confirm that the share of ADB’s financing is used in accordance with ADB’s policies 
and procedures.  
8   ADB’s approach and procedures regarding delayed submission of audited project financial statements:  
(i)  When audited project financial statements are not received by the due date, ADB will write to the  EA advising 
that (a) the audit documents are overdue; and (b) if they are not received within the next 6 months, requests for 
new  contract  awards  and  disbursement  such as new  replenishment  of advance  accounts,  processing  of  new 
reimbursement, and issuance of new commitment letters will not be processed. 
(ii)  When audited project financial statements are not received within 6 months after the due date, ADB will withhold 
processing  of  requests  for  new  contract  awards  and  disbursement  such  as  new  replenishment  of  advance 
accounts, processing of new reimbursement, and issuance of new commitment letters. ADB will (a) inform the 
executing agency of ADB’s actions; and (b) advise that the loan may be suspended if the audit documents are 
not received within the next 6 months. 
(iii) When  audited  project  financial  statements  are  not  received  within  12  months  after  the  due  date,  ADB  may 
suspend the loan. 
16 
Public disclosure of the audited financial statements, including the auditor’s opinion on the 
28. 
financial statements, will be guided by ADB’s Access to Information Policy.9 After the review, ADB 
will  disclose  the  audited  financial  statements  and  the  opinion  of  the  auditors  on  the  financial 
statements no later than 14 days of ADB’s confirmation of their acceptability by posting them on 
ADB’s website. The management letter, additional auditor’s opinions, and audited entity financial 
statements will not be disclosed.10

evaluation of bids. 
B. 
Procurement of Goods, Works, and Consulting Services 
Procurement  (including  consulting  services)  to  be  financed  by  ADB  will  follow  ADB’s 
31. 
Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and Procurement Regulations for ADB 
Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time).  
Project procurement risk assessment has been undertaken for the Issyk-Kul Wastewater 
32. 
Management Project (50176-002) having the same EA and IA as the first activity less than 18 
months  before  the  approval  of  this  activity.  The  overall  procurement  risk  assessment  is 
“substantial.”   
Open competitive bidding advertised international will be used for the procurement of civil

C. 
Procurement Plan 
34. 
The first procurement plan is indicated as below. The procurement plan will be updated 
by  the  Ministry  of  Finance  for  approval  by  ADB,  at  least  annually,  and  more  frequently  if 
necessary,  and  should  cover  the  next  18  months  of  procurement  activity.  A  delay  in  grant 
effectiveness,  other  start-up  delays,  and  delays  during  implementation  will  require  an 
unscheduled procurement plan update. ADB will review each updated procurement plan prior to 
its  publication.  The  estimated  package  cost  in  the  procurement  plan  is  inclusive  of  taxes  and 
duties.

SAFEGUARDS 
40. 
Environment (category B). An environmental assessment and review framework (EARF) 
have been prepared for the facility in accordance with ADB’s Safeguards Policy Statement 2009 
(ADB  SPS  2009)  to  guide  the  preparation  of  environmental  assessment  reports  (i.e.,  initial 
environmental  examination  (IEE)).11  Activity  subgrant  (1)  of  the  project  covering  the  chlorine 
neutralization unit in Osh-Plotina WTP is category B for environment. The IEE has been prepared 
and  is  disclosed  on  DDWSSD  and  ADB’s  website.  Public  consultations  were  conducted  and 
involved  affected  people  from  nearby  houses  and  other  project  stakeholders.  Project  impacts 
during construction are expected to be site-specific and temporary and related to the construction 
activities.  Expected  impacts  include,  among  others,  noise,  dust,  and  exhaust  emissions  from 
equipment and construction vehicles; impacts on the river and surface water, waste management, 
occupational  health  and  safety,  community  health  and  safety,  construction  traffic.  During 
operation phase, potential impacts are related to limited local capacity to maintain functionality of 
the  components,  with  expected  positive  impacts  due  to  the  rehabilitation  works.  Adequate 
mitigation measures are included as part of the assessment, and will be implemented through, 
the environmental management plan (EMP) and site-specific environmental management plans 
(SEMP).  
41. 
PMO will be responsible for EMP and SEMP implementation, will ensure that EMP will be 
adequately included in bidding documents and in construction contracts. PMO will be responsible 
to ensure that contractor prepares and submits SEMP to DDWSSD, which will contain the method 
statement for construction. SEMPs shall be reviewed and endorsed by the DDWSSD and submit 
for PMO’s approval. PMO will approve all SEMPs before start of any construction works. 
11  ADB. 2009. Safeguard Policy Statement. Manila.  
20 
42.  Monitoring of environmental quality and the implementation of mitigation measures will be 
performed by the PMO in line with EMP, with sufficient terms of reference and staff-time for this 
task. The monitoring results will be included in the project quarterly progress reports and semi-
annual environmental reports to be submitted to ADB. The cost for EMP implementation will be 
financed  under  the  grant,  specifically  the  costs  of  mitigation  measures  will  be  included  in  the 
construction contracts.  
43. 
PMO  will  be  responsible  for  establishing  and  implementing  the  grievance  redress 
mechanism  in  accordance  with  the  IEE  and  EMP.  PMO  will  promptly  inform  ADB  of  the 
occurrence of any risks or impacts, with detailed description of the event and proposed corrective 
action  plan  if  any  unanticipated  environmental  and/or  social  risks  and  impacts  arise  during 
construction, implementation or operation of the project that were not considered in the IEE. PMO 
will report any actual or potential breach of compliance with the measures and requirements set 
forth in the IEE and EMP promptly after becoming aware of the breach. 
44. 
Involuntary resettlement (category C). A land acquisition and resettlement framework 
has been prepared for the facility subsequent activities in accordance with the SPS. The SEFF 
will include consulting services and upgrading or rehabilitation works within existing facilities. They 
are not expected to involve any physical or economic displacement. For the first activity,  Osh-
Plotina  WTP  chlorine  neutralization  unit,  no  land  acquisition  and  involuntary  resettlement  is 
envisaged, as no household will experience severe impact on their livelihood and no household 
was found to belong to vulnerable groups. 
45. 
Indigenous peoples (category C). There are no indigenous peoples in the project areas, 
as defined in the ADB SPS 2009 for operational purposes. Accordingly, no indigenous peoples 
planning documents will be required. 
46. 
Stakeholder  consultations  were  conducted  on  9  July  2019.  A  fully  functional  grievance 
redress mechanism  is  already  in place  at the  PMO.  It  has  an  understandable and transparent 
process, gender responsive, culturally appropriate, and readily accessible to all affected persons. 
EA,  IA,  are  PMO  responsible  and  the  resources  required  to  implement  the  actions

reports  will  include  (i)  each  sub-activity’s  progress  measured  against  the  implementation 
schedule, (ii) key implementation issues and solutions, (iii) an updated procurement plan, and (d) 
an updated implementation plan for the next 12 months. To ensure SEFF Facility and the SEFF 
Activity continues to be both viable and sustainable, the Ministry of Finance should adequately 
review the SEFF Facility and Activity financial statements and the associated auditor's report. In 
the event that: (i) an ensuing loan is not approved, or where the associated ADB-financed loan 
21 
has been issued, the Ministry of Finance will submit a SEFF Activity completion report to ADB 
within 6 months of physical completion of the SEFF Activity.12

Compliance monitoring. IA, on behalf of EA, will monitor compliance of grant covenants, 
including that relating to policy, legal, financial, economic, environmental, and others and ensure 
compliance  with  grant  covenants  and  assurances.  All  non-compliance  issues,  if  any,  will  be 
updated  in  quarterly  progress  reports  together  with  remedial  actions.  PMO  and  ADB  review 
missions (at least twice a year) will also monitor the status of compliance with grant covenants 
and raise the noncompliance issues with the Ministry of Finance and EA and agree on remedial 
actions. 
Safeguards monitoring. The government will do the following or cause the EA and the 
51. 
IA to do the following: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
submit  semi-annual  environmental  and  social  safeguards  monitoring  reports  to 
ADB  and  disclose  relevant  information  from  such  reports  to  affected  persons 
promptly upon submission; 
if  any  unanticipated  environmental  and/or  social  risks  and  impacts  arise  during 
construction, implementation, or operation of the project that were not considered 
in the IEE and the EMP, promptly inform ADB of the occurrence of such risks or 
impacts, with detailed description of the event and proposed corrective action plan;  
report  any  actual  or  potential  breach  of  compliance  with  measures  and 
requirements set forth in the EMP promptly after becoming aware of the breach; 
and 
the status of safeguards implementation will also be discussed at each ADB review 
mission and with necessary issues and agreed actions recorded in aide memoires. 
B. 
Reporting  
The  EA  will  provide  ADB  with  (i)  quarterly  progress  reports  in  a  format  consistent  with 
52. 
ADB's  project  performance  reporting  system;  (ii)  consolidated  annual  reports  including  (a) 
progress achieved by output as measured through the indicator's performance targets, (b) key 
implementation  issues  and  solutions,  (c)  updated  procurement  plan,  and  (d)  updated 
implementation plan for the next 12 months; and (iii) if required, a SEFF activity completion report 
within 6 months of physical completion of the project. To ensure that projects will continue to be 
both  viable and sustainable,  project  accounts  and  the  EA  audited financial  statement together 
with the associated auditor's report, should be adequately reviewed.

ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISM 
People  who  are,  or  may  in  the  future  be,  adversely  affected  by  the  SEFF  Activity  may 
56. 
submit complaints to ADB’s Accountability Mechanism. The Accountability Mechanism provides 
an independent forum and process whereby people adversely affected by ADB-assisted projects 
can voice, and seek a resolution of their problems, as well as report alleged violations of ADB’s 
operational  policies  and  procedures.  Before  submitting  a  complaint  to  the  Accountability 
Mechanism, affected people should make an effort in good faith to solve their problems by working 
with  the  concerned  ADB  operations  department.  Only  after  doing  that,  and  if  they  are  still 
dissatisfied, should they approach the Accountability Mechanism.15
