Project Administration Manual Purpose and Process 
  The  project  administration  manual  (PAM)  describes  the  essential  administrative  and 
management requirements to implement the project on time, within budget, and in accordance 
with the policies and procedures of the government and Asian Development Bank (ADB). The 
PAM should include references to all available templates and instructions either through linkages 
to relevant URLs or directly incorporated in the PAM. 
  The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF), the Ministry of Economy and Finance 
(MEF),  and  the  Ministry  of  Rural  Development  (MRD)  are  wholly  responsible  for  the 
implementation of ADB-financed projects, as agreed jointly between the borrower and ADB, and 
in  accordance  with  the  policies  and  procedures  of  the  government  and  ADB.  ADB  staff  is 
responsible for supporting implementation including compliance by MAFF, MEF, and MRD of 
their  obligations  and  responsibilities  for  project  implementation  in  accordance  with  ADB’s 
policies and procedures. 
  At  loans  and  grant  negotiations,  the  borrower  and  ADB  shall  agree  to  the  PAM  and  ensure 
consistency  with  the  loans  and  grant  agreements.  Such  agreement  shall  be  reflected  in  the 
minutes  of the  loans  and  grant  negotiations.  In  the  event  of  any  discrepancy  or contradiction 
between the PAM and the loans and grant agreements, the provisions of the loans and grant 
agreements shall prevail. 
  After ADB Board approval of the project's report and recommendations of the President (RRP), 
changes in implementation arrangements are subject to agreement and approval pursuant to 
relevant government and ADB administrative procedures (including the Project Administration 
Instructions) and upon such approval, they will be subsequently incorporated in the PAM.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
1. 
The  Cambodia  Agricultural  Value  Chain  Competitiveness  and  Safety  Enhancement 
Project (ACSEP or the project) will strengthen value chains of competitive agricultural products 
(CAPs)— cassava, mangoes, cashew nuts, vegetables, and native chicken—in the provinces of 
Kampong  Cham,  Kampong  Thom,  Oddar  Meanchey,  Preah  Vihear,  Siem  Reap,  and  Tboung 
Khmum. 1  The  project  will  (i)  facilitate  access  to  credit  for  agro-enterprises  and  agricultural 
cooperatives;  (ii)  promote  viable  market  links  among  agro-enterprises  and  agricultural 
cooperatives, and enhance food safety and quality; and (iii) improve farm-to-market connectivity. 
The project will benefit about 230 agricultural cooperatives (about 27,000 households) and about 
50 agribusinesses in the project areas. 
A. 
Impact and  Outcome 
2. 
The project is aligned with the following impacts: (i) inclusive and sustainable development 
in  agriculture  sector  achieved;  and  (ii)  private  sector  developed  by  promoting  SMEs  and 
entrepreneurship.2 The project will have the following outcome: value addition of five competitive 
AVCs in the project areas increased.3 
B. 
Outputs 
1.   
3. 
Output  1:  Agricultural  value  chain  financing  enhanced.  This  output  will  promote 
investments by agro-enterprises and agricultural cooperatives to be engaged in CAP value chains 
(para. 2) through financial intermediation.4 Participating financial institutions (PFIs)5 will provide 
the agro-enterprises and agricultural cooperatives (borrowers) with four types of subloans from 
the  AVC  loan  credit  line  depending  on  needs  of  borrowers. 6 To  facilitate  PFIs’  provision  of 
subloans, the project will introduce two other financing schemes: an equity capital loan credit line 
and  a  credit  guarantee  fund.  The  equity  capital  loan  credit  line  will  provide  borrowers  with 
supplemental equity on a subordinated basis in cases where the borrower lacks equity to qualify 
for the primary loan (i.e., AVC loans). The credit guarantee fund will provide guarantees to PFIs’ 
provision  of  AVC  loans  and  equity  capital  loans  to  reduce  their  risk  exposure.  In  addition,  the 
project,  in  cooperation  with  PFIs,  will  help  the  agro-enterprises  and  agricultural  cooperatives 
1  These five value chains are selected considering export orientation, import substitution, value addition, and impact 
on income enhancement. Cashew, cassava, and mangoes are important crops for processing and export; vegetables 
will strengthen import substitution; and poultry (native chicken) has high income-generation impact. 
2  At $10–$13 per 100 kilometers (km) per ton in 2015, Cambodia’s domestic transport costs remain higher than its 
regional competitors. Domestic transport costs about $5 per 100 km per ton in Thailand and about $7 per 100 km 
per ton in Viet Nam. 
3  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1 of the RRP. 
4  Beneficiary agro-enterprises have operations in, or source agro-products from, the six project provinces. However, 
given the growing need for access to finance after COVID-19, the geographic coverage and target AVCs may be 
expanded, while support for agricultural cooperatives will be limited to the six project provinces. A majority of the 
beneficiary agro-enterprises and agricultural cooperatives of output 1 are expected to be from project participating 
agro-enterprises and participating agricultural cooperatives. 
5  Sathapana Bank and the Agricultural and Rural Development Bank have been selected as PFIs for their substantial 
portfolio in agriculture and SME lending, and their interest and willingness to participate in the project. 
6  Four types of AVC loans comprise: (i) farm production loans for contract growers, (ii) short- to medium-term business 
loans, (iii) inventory procurement loans/seasonal revolving line of credit, and (iv) long-term business loans. Details 
are in Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). 
2 
strengthen  their  business  planning  and  loan  applications.  The  project  will  also  pilot  a  green 
financing scheme to be financed by the ASEAN Infrastructure Fund.7 
4. 
Output 2: Agricultural value chain linkage and safety strengthened. This output will 
address key bottlenecks in the value chains by (i) engaging and supporting about 230 participating 
agricultural  cooperatives  (PACs) 8 to  improve  their  production  capacity  through  demonstration 
farms  and  small  agricultural  infrastructure  support  and  to  establish  inclusive  business 
partnerships  (IBPs)  with  participating  agro-enterprises  (PAEs)  to  be  engaged  for  sustainable 
value  chain  linkages;9 (ii)  building  the  capacity  of  PACs  and  PAEs  on  food  safety  control  and 
supporting them to obtain agro-product safety assurance certificates;10 (iii) supporting research 
and development on crop seed varieties and poultry breeds, and multiplying and disseminating 
high-yield,  drought-resilient,  and  disease-resistant  crop  seeds  and  planting  materials;  (iv) 
for 
upgrading  agro-product  safety 
Standardization 17025 accreditation;11 and (v) enhancing digitalization of government’s services 
through an integrated agricultural data platform, multichannel extension services, and piloting of 
a traceability system. The project will also support developing a strategic plan for agro-food safety 
testing  laboratory  system  upgrading  and  operation  plans  as  a  condition  for  item  (iv);  and 
developing a strategic plan for digitalization of MAFF services as a condition for item (v).

Output  3:  Agricultural  value  chain  connectivity  enhanced.  This  output  will  improve 
about  110  kilometers  of  farm-to-market  roads  in  the  project  areas. 12  Laterite  roads  will  be 
upgraded with double bituminous surface treatment. Climate change adaptation measures have 
been  incorporated  into  the  design  of  farm-to-market  roads  (FMRs). 13  Improved  FMRs  will 
enhance connectivity among value chain actors of the CAPs by reducing transport time and cost, 
increasing  the  volume  of  transportation,  and  reducing  road  maintenance  costs.  The  project 
communities will be trained in road safety. The project will ensure that there is sufficient budget 
to operate and maintain the improved FMRs.14 
7  ADB will provide technical assistance to design the green financing mechanism. (ADB. 2018. Green and Innovative 
Finance Initiative for Scaling Up Southeast Asian Infrastructure. Manila [TA 9621-REG]). The ASEAN Infrastructure 
Fund will provide financing to pilot the scheme under the proposed project. 
8  There  are  currently  240  registered  agricultural  cooperatives  and  several  unregistered  farmers  groups  in  the  six 
project provinces. Of these, 230 will be selected and new ones to be added if needed as the PACs based on criteria 
including minimum years of operation and minimum proportion of female members. Details are provided in the Project 
Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). Of the 230 target PACs, 60 will 
specialize in cashew, 100 in cassava, 10 in mangoes, and 60 in vegetable production. Poultry farmers are individuals. 
9  The IBP is a mutually beneficial business partnership between PACs (or farmers groups) and PAEs that source raw 
materials from the PACs. The roles and responsibilities of PAEs and PACs under an IBP are provided in the Project 
Administration Manual. The IBPs are expected to improve PACs’ access to finance by providing the PFIs assurance 
of the PACs’ business viability, together with sales agreements and contract farming. 
10 Certificates include Cambodian Good Agricultural Practices (CamGAP), CamOrganic and Good Animal Husbandry 
Practices (GAHP) for PACs, and Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) and Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points 
(HACCP) for PAEs. 
11 The laboratories the project will support include the National Agriculture Laboratory for pesticide residue analysis (for 
mangoes and vegetables), the Cambodia Laboratory of Agricultural Products and Foods for mycotoxin analysis (for 
cashew nuts), and the National Animal Health and Production Research Institute for antibiotics analysis (for meat). 
12 While the Cambodian Road Law classifies such roads as rural roads, the term “farm-to-market road” is used in this 
document to emphasize the nature of rural roads supported by the project. 
13 Funded by the Nordic Development Fund to incorporate climate change proofing to the road design and improve 
project  readiness,  the  detailed  engineering  designs  have  been  completed  for  five  of  the  six  envisaged  FMR 
subprojects. The detailed engineering design for the remaining subproject will be complemented in October 2020. 
14 The project will follow the practices of ADB’s rural roads improvement projects in Cambodia. Under the Second Rural 
Roads  Improvement  Project,  a  rural  roads  asset  management  system  and  asset  management  tools  are  being 
developed and will be completed by the end of 2020. (ADB. 2014. Report and Recommendation of the President to 
the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan and Administration of Grants to the Kingdom of Cambodia for the Second 
Rural Roads Improvement Project. Manila.)

IV. 
COSTS AND FINANCING 
15. 
The  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $110.06  million.  The  government  has  requested  (i)  a 
concessional loan of $70.00 million from ADB’s ordinary capital resources (A loan); (ii) a loan of 
$5.00 million from the ASEAN Infrastructure Fund (B loan) through its Inclusive Finance Facility; 
and (iii) a grant not exceeding $3.00 million from the JFPR to help finance the project. 
16. 
The A loan will have a 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years; an interest rate 
of 1.0% per year during the grace period and 1.5% per year thereafter, and such other terms and 
conditions set forth in the loan agreement. The B loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace 
period of 5 years; an interest rate of 1.0% per year during the grace period and 1.5% per year 
thereafter, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the loan agreement. The B loan will 
be  administered  by  ADB.  The  A  loan  will  finance  expenditures  in  relation to  financial  services, 
works, goods, consulting and non-consulting services, and incremental operating cost. The B loan 
will  provide  pilot  green  financing  through  financial  intermediation  loans  and  works.  The  JFPR 
grant will finance expenditures related to demonstration of farm activities. 
17. 
AFD  will  provide  cofinancing  of  the  euro  equivalent  of  $25  million,  to  be  partially 
administered  by  ADB.20 The  AFD  loan  will  have  a  20-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  7 
years.21 It will finance works and consulting services for output 3 and part of goods for output 2. 
The government will finance the remaining $7.06 million through in-cash and in-kind contributions. 
A. 
Cost Estimates Preparation and Revisions  
The project team prepared the cost estimates using data collected by individual specialists 
18. 
from  primary  and  secondary  sources.  During  project  implementation,  project  staff  and  project 
implementation team will revise costs in accordance with detailed final designs and will also be 
responsible  for  detailed  costing  of  additional  water  resources  and  cooperative  value  chain 
infrastructure  investments  implemented  as  part  of  the  project.  Tables  may  be  revised  during 
midterm review or special administration review mission.  
B. 
Key Assumptions 
19. 
The following key assumptions underpin the cost estimates and financing plan: 
(i) 
(ii) 
The  contingencies  comprise  physical  and  price  contingencies.  Physical 
contingencies  are  computed  at  10%  for  civil  works,  goods  and  services, 
demonstration farms, research and development, and consulting services and 0% 
for cooperative support, financial services, and incremental operating costs. 
Price  contingencies  based  on  expected  cumulative 
the 
inflation  over 
implementation period are in Table 5. Project payments will be made in US Dollar 
for foreign costs and therefore the international cost escalation factor was applied. 
Local costs were calculated in US Dollar and irrespective of whether payments are 
made in Riel or US Dollar, the domestic cost escalation factor was applied to the 
costs. 
20 Partial administration includes ADB’s administration of procurement and disbursement activities for the AFD loan 
following  ADB’s  Procurement  Policy  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time),  Procurement  Regulations  for  ADB 
Borrowers  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time),  and  disbursement  guidelines  (ADB’s  Loan  Disbursement 
Handbook [2017, as amended from time to time]). 
21 Interest rates will be determined after AFD’s board meeting. AFD requires climate change co-benefit worth at least 
80% of its financing.

In-kind contributions were calculated based on or using government staff salaries 
as specified in the Government Order. The farm gate costs are applied to all farm 
inputs,  and  provincial  construction  costs  norms  for  civil  works  costs  based  on 
industry specific norms and cross referenced to local market rates.

Contract and Disbursement S-Curve  
20. 
Below  figure  and  tables  show  quarterly  contract  awards  and  disbursement  projections 
over  the  life  of  the  project.  The  S-curve  is  only  for  ADB  financing  and  ADB-administered 
cofinancing (AFD loan, AIF loan, and JFPR grant), which will be recorded in ADB’s systems and 
reported through ADB’s e-Operations. Counterpart funds and any other cofinancing is excluded. 
The projection for contract awards includes contingencies and unallocated amount but excludes 
interests  during  construction  which  is  financed  by  the  government.  The  total  projected 
disbursement is equal to the full loan amount, up to 4 months after loan closing.

Financial Management Assessment 22 
V. 
FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT 
The  financial  management  assessment  (FMA)  was  conducted  during  August-  October 
21. 
2019 (for MAFF and MRD) and during July 2020 (for MEF) in accordance with ADB’s Guidelines 
for  the  Financial  Management  and  Analysis  of  Projects,  and  the  Financial  Due  Diligence  A 
Methodology Note. The FMA assessed the capacity of MAFF as the executing agency and MRD 
and MEF, as implementing agencies including funds flow arrangements, staffing, accounting and 
financial  reporting  systems,  financial  information  systems,  and  internal  and  external  auditing 
arrangements.  
The  overall  pre-mitigation  financial  management  risk  for  the  project  is  substantial.  The 
22. 
weaknesses identified include (i) complex implementation arrangements (i.e., three implementing 
agencies and units); (ii) project staff’s lack experience in accounting and financial management; 
(iii)  lack  of  IT  software  and  equipment;  and  (iv)  weak  internal  audit.  The  mitigation  measures 
include  (i)  engagement  of  financial  management  consultants;  (ii)  capacity  building  on  financial 
management and internal audit for project staff; (iii) procurement of IT software to be used for the 
project; and (iv) submission of quarterly reports. Financial due diligence was also conducted on 
the two PFIs covering the areas of corporate governance and risk management. Both were found 
to have adequate systems and policies in place for the purpose of the project. 
23. 
Based on the assessment, all IAs have adequate administrative and accounting capacity 
to establish sufficient internal control, accounting, and auditing procedures to ensure efficient use 
and operation of the advance account procedure. Moreover, they have adequate administrative 
and accounting capacity to prepare and maintain proper SOE records and make them available 
for examination.   
The  IAs  have  agreed  to  implement  an  action  plan  as  key  measures  to  address  the 
24. 
deficiencies. The financial management action plan is provided below. 
22  The Financial Management Assessment is found in Supplementary Document 19 of the RRP.

Table 12: Financial Management Action Plan 
Mitigation Action 
• PAM describes the roles and duties of each 
agency and clear guidance on project 
implementation and orientation at project 
inception. A PMU at MAFF will be established to 
provide oversight and coordination among all 
implementing agencies. The financial 
management coordination at the PMU will be 
supported by an international financial 
management consultant.  
• Quarterly progress reports will be required to be 
submitted. 
• National Financial Management Specialist will 
be recruited to provide support to the PMU. In 
collaboration with Asian Development Bank 
(ADB) Cambodia Resident Mission (CARM), they 
will train accountants of EA/IA on budget 
execution, accounting, reporting, and auditing.  
• Training on project management, financial 
management, SOP and project fund flows shall 
be provided to the project staff in EA and IAs.  
• Training on ADB disbursement procedures, 
including online training, will be made available 
to EA and IA staff; and project staff will be 
encouraged to undertake the training to help 
ensure efficient disbursement and fiduciary 
control.  
Weakness 
• Lack of adequate coordination from project 
management unit (PMU) of the Ministry of 
Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) as 
executing agency (EA) with implementing 
agencies (IAs), project implementation units 
(PIUs), and provincial PIUs given the 
complexity of the project arrangement  
• Inability to maintain financial reports 
following the project requirements due to lack 
of experience on the part of the finance staff 
as not all proposed accountants at PIU/IA 
have experience working for ADB-funded 
project and have not been trained on 
Standard Operating Procedures (SOP), 
Financial Management Manual (FMM) and 
ADB’s Loan Disbursement Handbook (LDH).  
Also, not all proposed managers at the IAs of 
Provincial Department of Agriculture, Forestry 
and Fisheries (PDAFF) and Provincial 
Department of Rural Development (PDRD) 
have experience working for ADB’s funded 
project. Some of them have experience 
working with other donors such as the World 
Bank and International Fund for Agricultural 
Development (IFAD). 
• Weak internal audit due to limited capacity 
in internal audit.  
• Delays and errors in financial reports due to 
inability of the PIUs to operate the systems 
and inadequate IT equipment such desktop 
computers and printers  
• Capacity building for internal audit staff will be 
provided. 
• Technical training on the use of information 
systems will be provided to the users.  
• The necessary IT equipment such as desktop 
computer and printers shall be procured under 
the loan proceeds for the PPIUs/IAs.

Disbursement 
1. 
Disbursement  Arrangements  for  ADB  and  ADB-administered  Cofinancier 
Funds 
25. 
The ADB, AFD, and AIF loans and JFPR grant proceeds will be disbursed in accordance 
with ADB’s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time), 23 and detailed 
arrangements agreed upon between the government and ADB. Project staff will undertake the 
ADB  online  training 24  on  disbursement  policies  and  procedures  to  help  ensure  efficient 
disbursement and fiduciary control. In addition, they will attend training courses on disbursement 
offered by ADB and Cambodia Resident Mission.  
The proposed PMU will have a strong key control in managing the disbursement of all the 
26. 
project  funds  and  will  strictly  follow  the  Financial  Management  Manual  (FMM)  and  its  Internal 
Financial Management Guidelines to monitor the disbursements.  
Fund  flows  will  be  arranged  following  the  standard  operating  procedures  (SOP)  of  the 
27. 
government, the FMM of the project, the ADB’s procedures, and discussions with MAFF, MEF, 
MRD, and ADB. The fund flows for the proposed project are presented in Figure 3. 
ADB direct payment procedures will generally be used to pay suppliers, contractors and 
28. 
consultants.  With  oversight  of  MAFF,  the  PMU  will  be  responsible  for  preparing  the  annual 
contract  awards  and  disbursement  projections.  Each  IA  will  however  be  responsible  for  (i) 
requesting budgetary allocations for counterpart funds; (ii) preparing withdrawal applications; and 
(iii) collecting supporting documents for the project expenditures which they have incurred.  
29. 
Advance  Fund  Procedure.  Immediately  after  loan  effectiveness,  MEF  (GDICDM)  will 
open  four  separate  pass-through  accounts  for  each  of  the  four  funding  sources.  Separate 
advance accounts will be opened by the respective PIUs (MAFF, MEF, and MRD) for each output. 
Two advance accounts (one for the ADB loan funds and one for the AIF loan funds) will be opened 
and managed by MEF (GDFI) for Output 1. To avoid conflict of interest, there will be segregation 
of duties between the two general departments (GDICDM and GDFI) within MEF and different 
approvals  for  the  pass-through  accounts  and  the  advance  account  for  Output  1.  To  ensure 
compliance with internal controls in-place, MEF has an internal audit department which regularly 
conducts audit on systems and procedures. Four advance accounts (one for the ADB loan, one 
for the AFD loan, one for the AIF loan, and one for the JFPR grant) will be opened and managed 
by MAFF for Output 2. One advance account (for the AFD loan) will be opened and managed by 
MRD for Output 3. The currency of the advance accounts will be in US dollars. It is important for 
fiscal management to maintain separate advance accounts for the implementation activities that 
each of the three IAs will be responsible for, as they are distinctly different in nature. The IA for 
Output  1,  MEF,  the  appointed  financing  modalities  administrator,  will  provide  for  and  finance 
through the participating financial institutions (PFIs): (i) credit line activities associated with the 
agricultural value chain loan credit line (AVCL-CL) and the equity capital loan (ECL-CL) credit line 
on behalf of PFIs extending agriculture and equity loans to agribusiness end-users, and (ii) credit 
guarantee fund (CGF) for those PFIs which elect to use credit guarantee to cover their credit line 
loans  to  end-user borrowers  under the  project. The  three IAs  who  will  administer  the  advance 
accounts are accountable and responsible for proper use of advances to the advance account. 
23 The handbook is available electronically from the ADB website (http://www.adb.org/documents/ loan-disbursement-
handbook 
24 Disbursement eLearning. http://wpqr4.adb.org/disbursement_elearning  
35 
To facilitate effective project implementation in view of the cash flow requirement and the 
30. 
need to make a large number of small payments, PMU will be in charge of necessary planning 
and documentation for the project advance accounts and seeking the review and approval from 
MEF.  
31. 
The total outstanding advance to the respective advance accounts should not exceed the 
estimate of ADB, AFD, AIF, and JFPR share of expenditures to be paid through the respective 
advance accounts for the forthcoming six months. The implementing agencies may request for 
initial  and  additional  advances  to  the  respective  advance  accounts  based  on  an  estimate  of 
expenditure sheet setting out the estimated expenditures to be financed through the respective 
advance account for the forthcoming six months. Supporting documents should be submitted to 
ADB  or  retained  by  the  borrowers’  implementing  agencies  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  Loan 
Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time) when liquidating or replenishing 
the advance accounts. 
Statement  of  Expenditure  (SOE)  Procedure.25 The  SOE  procedure  will  be  used  for 
32. 
reimbursement and to liquidate and replenish the advance accounts for eligible expenditures. The 
ceiling of the SOE procedures is the equivalent of $50,000 per individual payment. Supporting 
documents  and  records  for  the  expenditure  claimed  under  the  SOE  procedure  should  be 
maintained and made readily available for review by ADB's disbursement and review mission or 
upon  ADB's  request  for  submission  of  supporting  documents  on  a  sampling  basis,  and  for 
independent external audit. Reimbursement and liquidation of individual payments in excess of 
the  SOE  ceiling  should  be  supported  by  full  documentation  when  submitting  the  withdrawal 
application to ADB. Before the submission of the first withdrawal application (WA), the borrower 
should submit to ADB sufficient evidence of the authority of the person(s) who will sign the WA 
on behalf of the borrower and the authenticated specimen signatures of each authorized person. 
WAs  and  supporting  documents  will  demonstrate,  among  other  things  that  the  goods,  and/or 
services were produced in or from ADB member countries and are eligible for ADB financing. The 
minimum  value  per  WA  is  stipulated  in  the  ADB  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2017,  as 
amended  from  time  to  time).  Individual  payments  below  this  amount  should  be  paid  (i)  by  the 
executing  agency  and/or  implementing  agency  and  subsequently  claimed  to  ADB  through 
reimbursement, or (ii) through the advance fund procedure, unless otherwise accepted by ADB. 
The  borrower  should  ensure  sufficient  category  and  contract  balances  before  requesting 
disbursements. Separate withdrawal applications must be submitted for the ADB loan, the AFD 
loan, the AIF loan, and the JFPR grant for eligible expenditure items. Use of ADB’s Client Portal 
for Disbursements (CPD) system is encouraged for submission of withdrawal applications to ADB. 
33. 
Disbursement to PFIs. PFIs will enter into subsidiary loan agreements with MEF (PIU for 
Output 1) to access AVCL-CL, ECL-CL and CGF.26 PFIs will provide subloans from AVCL-CL and 
ECL-CL  to  eligible  borrowers  to  invest  in  eligible  activities 27   Appendix  3  details  the  subloan 
eligibility criteria. Potential PAEs and PACs by commodity have also been initially identified and 
their profiles are in Appendixes 4 and 5 while Appendix 6 outlines the eligibility criteria for PACs 
and PAEs to partner with the project. 
Upon  project  effectiveness,  MEF  reviews  the  initial  quarterly  forward  estimate  of  total 
34. 
AVCL-CL,  ECL-CL  and  CGF  required  by  PFIs  and  submits  withdrawal  application  for  initial 
advance to ADB; (ii) ADB disburses initial advance to the advance accounts held with MEF; (iii) 
25 SOE forms are available in ADB’s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time). 
26 Subsidiary loan agreements need to be in a form acceptable to ADB. 
27 See General Operating Guidelines for Credit Lines and Credit Guarantee Fund in Supplementary Document 24 of 
the RRP for specific terms governing fund use and fund flow.  
36 
MEF disburses funds to PFIs in accordance with arrangements in the agreements between MEF 
and PFIs; (iv) PFIs issue AVCL-CL and ECL-CL for qualified subloan borrowers and submits to 
MEF the required documentation to liquidate the funds received from MEF; (iv) MEF submits to 
ADB the list of AVCLs, ECLs and credit guarantees (using the statement of expenditure [SOE] 
procedure below) issued by each PFI to liquidate the initial advance; (v) ADB liquidates the initial 
advance  based  on  eligible  AVCLs,  ECLs  and  credit  guarantees  made;  (vi)  MEF  submits 
replenishment  request  to  ADB  based  on  new  estimate  of  AVCL-CL,  ECL-CL  and  credit 
guarantees of the PFIs in the next quarter; and (vii) ADB replenishes the advance accounts. 
35. 
As  a  condition  to  disbursement  for  the  financial  services  component  of  output  1,  a 
subsidiary loan agreement acceptable to ADB must be duly authorized, executed, and delivered 
on behalf of the two PFIs, as set out in the loan agreement. 
36. 
For  AFD  funds,  the  borrower  should  submit  one  original  of  the  WA  and  copies  of 
supporting documents to AFD, and one original of the WA and copies of supporting documents 
to ADB.  ADB will review each WA and advise AFD to make the necessary payment, if any.     
2.  
Disbursement Arrangements for Counterpart Funds 
37. 
Disbursement  and  Liquidation  Procedures  for  Counterpart  Funds.  Withdrawal  of 
government counterpart funds must be carried out in accordance with the government policies 
and procedures, through its regular budget for cash and through taxes exemption, issued by MEF, 
for  consulting  services  and  goods  sourced  from  overseas.  Counterpart  funds  WAs  should  be 
made in accordance with the budget plan agreed between MAFF, MRD, and MEF. Counterpart 
funds may only be withdrawn for expenditures of the project which are specified in the project 
financing agreements. 
38. 
Key Internal Controls for Counterpart Funds. For the initial advance of the counterpart 
fund,  the  EA  and  IAs  complete the  government WA  form for  the  initial  advance  of  counterpart 
funds and submits to the General Department of International Cooperation and Debt Management 
(GDICDM)  at MEF.  The  maximum  amount  of  the  advance  of  counterpart funds  will  be  agreed 
between  MAFF,  MRD,  and  MEF-appointed  financing  modalities  Administrator  and  MEF.  The 
government WA form must be signed by the authorized signatories of  each respective EA and 
IAs and submitted to GDICDM. The government withdrawal application must be recorded in the 
project counterpart funds WA register.  
Counterpart Funds Replenishment. The project team completes the government WA 
39. 
form and attaches a statement of actual expenditure. Supporting expenditure documentation must 
be maintained by the project team for subsequent review by MEF or audit. The government WA 
form must be signed by the authorized signatories and submitted to the GDICDM and must be 
recorded in the project counterpart funds WA register.  
40. 
The  GDICDM  will  review  the  completed  forms  and  transfers  the  funds  to  the  project’s 
counterpart fund account and advises the MAFF of the transfer. On receipt of advice from the 
National  Bank  of  Cambodia  that  the  funds  have  been  deposited  into  the  counterpart  funds 
account, the receipt of the funds should be recorded in the general ledger and the government 
WA register must be updated.  
37 
C. 
Accounting 
41.  MAFF,  MEF,  and  MRD  will  maintain,  or  cause  to  be  maintained,  separate  books  and 
records by funding source for all expenditures incurred on the project for their respective outputs 
in accordance with the government's accounting laws and regulations which are consistent with 
international accounting principles and practices.  
D. 
Auditing and Public Disclosure 
42.  MAFF, MEF and MRD will each prepare project financial statements and will cause these 
financial  statements  to  be  audited  in  accordance  with  the  international  standards  on  auditing 
and/or in accordance with the government’s audit regulations by an auditor acceptable to ADB; 
and with the TOR acceptable to ADB. The audited project financial statements, which should be 
in the English language, will be submitted to the PMU at MAFF for compilation and submission to 
ADB  within  six months  from  the  end  of the  fiscal  year.  The  annual  audited  report  includes  the 
audited  project  financial  statements  (APFS),  auditor  opinion  on  the  use  of  loans  and  grant 
proceeds, and management letter. These cover (i) whether the project financial statements are 
presented  in  all  material  respects  or  in  accordance  with  the  applicable  financial  reporting 
framework; (ii) whether loans and grant proceeds were used only for the purposes of the project 
or  not;  and  (iii)  the  level  of  compliance  for  each  financial  covenant  contained  in  the  legal 
agreements for the project (if any).  
43. 
PFIs will also need to submit to ADB annual audited statement of utilization of funds, and 
in addition an audit management letter and audit opinions on the (i) use of loan proceeds, and (ii) 
compliance with financial covenants as stated in the legal agreements. The EA will also cause 
the  PFIs  to  submit  the  entity-level  financial  statements  to  be  audited  in  accordance  with 
International Standards on Auditing by an independent external auditor acceptable to ADB.  The 
audited entity financial statements, together with the auditor’s report and management letter, will 
be submitted in the English language to ADB within 1 month after their approval by the relevant 
authority but within 12 months from the end of the fiscal year. 
44. 
The  government  and  the  PFIs  has  been  made  aware  of  ADB’s  policy  on  delayed 
submission,  and  the  requirements  for  satisfactory  and  acceptable  quality  of  the  audited 
accounts. 28  
45. 
ADB reserves the right to require a change in the auditor (in a manner consistent with the 
constitution of the borrower), or for additional support to be provided to the auditor, if the audits 
required  are  not  conducted  in  a  manner  satisfactory  to  ADB,  or  if  the  audits  are  substantially 
delayed. ADB reserves the right to verify the project's financial accounts to confirm that the share 
of ADB’s financing is used in accordance with ADB’s policies and procedures. 
28 ADB’s approach and procedures regarding delayed submission of audited project financial statements:  
(i)  When  audited  project  financial  statements  are  not  received  by  the  due  date,  ADB  will  write  to  the  executing 
agency advising that (a) the audit documents are overdue; and (b) if they are not received within the next six 
months, requests for new contract awards and disbursement such as new replenishment of advance accounts, 
processing of new reimbursement, and issuance of new commitment letters will not be processed.  
(ii) When audited project financial statements are not received within six months after the due date, ADB will withhold 
processing  of  requests  for  new  contract  awards  and  disbursement  such  as  new  replenishment  of  advance 
accounts, processing of new reimbursement, and issuance of new commitment letters. ADB will (a) inform the 
executing agency of ADB’s actions; and (b) advise that the loan may be suspended if the audit documents are 
not received within the next 6 months.  
(iii)  When  audited  project  financial  statements  are  not  received  within  12  months  after  the  due  date,  ADB  may 
suspend the loan.  
38 
Public disclosure of the audited project financial statements, including the auditor’s opinion 
46. 
on the project financial statements, will be guided by ADB’s Public Communications Policy 2011. 29 
After the review and confirmation of acceptability, ADB will disclose the audited project financial 
statements and the opinion of the auditors on the project financial statements no later than 14 
days  of  ADB’s  confirmation  of  their  acceptability  by  posting  them  on  ADB’s  website.  The 
management letter, additional auditor’s opinions, and audited entity financial statements will not 
be disclosed. 30 
VI. 
PROCUREMENT AND CONSULTING SERVICES 
A. 
Value for Money in Procurement 
Given the geographical spread of project sites and large number of relatively non-complex 
47. 
packages, the project will achieve value for money in procurement through (i) bundling roads into 
packages with lots, where feasible, to maximize opportunities for local contractors, while still being 
of  interest  to  locally  based  international  contractors;  (ii)  dividing  the  laboratory  equipment  in 
separate  packages,  in  order  to  target  specialist  providers;  (iii)  direct  contracting  the  sole  local 
provider  of  laboratory  maintenance  services  saving  time  and  cost;  and  (iv)  use  of  request  for 
quotations  for  low  value/complexity  packages  to  reduce  administrative  effort  and  procurement 
time. 
B. 
Advance Contracting 
48. 
All advance contracting will be undertaken in conformity with ADB’s Procurement Policy 
(2017, as amended from time to time) and ADB’s Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers 
(Goods, Works, Nonconsulting and Consulting Services) (2017, as amended from time to time). 
The  issuance  of  invitations  to  bid  for  goods  and  civil  works  and  advertisement  of  consulting 
packages under advance contracting will be subject to ADB’s prior approval. The government, 
MAFF and the implementing agencies have been advised that approval of advance contracting 
does not commit ADB to finance the project.  
49. 
The project will proceed to recruit under advance contracting the (i) project implementation 
consultants  (PIC),  (ii)  construction  supervision  consultants  (CSC),  and  (iii)  financing  specialist 
consultants (FSC); and issue invitation for bids for procurement of (i) works for roads improvement, 
and (ii) vehicles. These packages are identified in the procurement plan. 
C. 
Procurement of Goods, Works, and Consulting Services 
50. 
All procurement of goods, works and services will be undertaken in accordance with ADB’s 
Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and the Procurement Regulations for 
ADB Borrowers (Goods, Works, Nonconsulting and Consulting Services) (2017, as amended from 
time  to  time).  The  procurement  strategy  has  been  guided  by  ADB’s  Strategic  Procurement 
Planning: Guidance Note on Procurement (June 2018). 31 
The procurement of goods and non-consulting services will use open competitive bidding 
51. 
with both international and national advertising, and request for quotations, while the procurement 
of  works  will  use  open  competitive  bidding  with  international  advertising.  The  recruitment  of 
29 Public Communications Policy: http://www.adb.org/documents/pcp-2011?ref=site/disclosure/publications 
30  This type of information would generally fall under public communications policy exceptions to disclosure. ADB. 2011. 
Public Communications Policy. Paragraph 97(iv) and/or 97(v). 
31 Strategic Procurement Planning (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2 of the RRP). 
39 
consulting services will use open competitive bidding with international advertising using quality 
and cost-based selection, and individual consultant selection.  
As the project procurement packages will be cofinanced, universal procurement will apply 
52. 
for all packages, except those funded by the JFPR Grant.32 
53. 
Procurement undertaken by eligible sub-borrowers under Output 1 of the project shall be 
undertaken in accordance with established commercial practices and procedures acceptable to 
ADB. 
54.  Where  harmonized  national  bidding  documents  are  proposed  to  be  used  for  packages 
contained in the procurement plan, their use shall be subject to ADB review and approval prior to 
use.  
55. 
To  provide  technical  assistance  to  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies  in  the 
implementation and management of the project, the following consulting services will be engaged:

SAFEGUARDS 
64. 
The  safeguard  documents  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  Safeguard 
Policy  Statement  (SPS  2009).33 In  compliance  with  ADB’s  information  disclosure,  consultation 
and participation requirements, the safeguards documents will be posted on ADB’s website. The 
safeguards  categorization  is  B  for  environment  and  C  for  both  involuntary  resettlement  and 
indigenous peoples. 
65. 
The safeguard documents comprise: (i) the Environment and Social Management System 
(ESMS) for output 1, (ii) the Initial Environmental Examination (IEE) including the Environment 
Management Plan (EMP) for outputs 2 and 3, (iii) the social safeguard due diligence report for 
output  2,  (iv)  the  social  safeguard  due  diligence  report  for  output  3,  and  (v)  the  Community 
Participation Framework (CPF) for output 3. 
66. 
Project  Grievance  Redress  Mechanism.  ADB  SPS  requires  that  the  Government 
establishes  and  maintains  a  grievance  redress  mechanism  (GRM)  to  receive  and  facilitate 
resolution  of  affected  peoples’  concerns  about  project  social  and  environmental  performance. 
PMU will establish the project safeguards GRM, as detailed in safeguard plans within 60 days of 
33 ADB. Safeguard Categories. The ADB SPS will be applied to the social and environmental assessment and planning 
process, and safeguards planning documents for all project activities whether they are financed by ADB or AFD. 
Meaningful consultation and disclosure requirements will follow those outlined in the ADB SPS. ADB will monitor 
safeguard compliance as part of its supervision missions along with AFD. 
47 
the project effectiveness date, or before implementation of land acquisition activities, whichever 
is  the  earliest.  The  GRM  comprises  a  set  of  clear  procedures  to  receive,  record,  and  address 
concerns  or  complaints  raised  about  safeguard  and  other  project-related  issues  at  village, 
commune, district and provincial level. Affected persons will have the option of seeking redress 
through the existing country system or through the project specific GRM entry points. Since the 
three project outputs each have different implementing agencies, it is appropriate that the PMU, 
which comprises representation from the three IAs, will set up and coordinate the GRM and report 
complaints  and  their  resolution  to  ADB  as  part  of  its  progress  monitoring  and  reporting 
responsibilities.  The PMU is expected to establish the grievance redress committee and to ensure 
that GRM focal points are established within PMU, PIUs and contractor teams. Where complaints 
are  related  to  roads  (Output  3)  they  will  be  addressed  via  the  existing  complaints  procedures 
within the MRD Social and Environment Office (SEO). For a complaint arising from activities under 
the other project output, the complaint will be handled by the PMU which will direct it to the PIU 
responsible for that output. Since only Output 3 has major civil works, it is likely that majority of 
complaints  will  be  to  MRD  and  addressed  via  SEO  procedures  but  will  still  be  reported  to  the 
PMU. Records of complaints received and how they are addressed will be maintained by the PMU 
and reported in the quarterly project progress reports and semi-annual environmental monitoring 
report. All other stakeholder project agencies and staff will be initiated into the GRM procedures 
by  the  project  implementation  consultants  (PIC) and  PMU  Safeguards Officer  and  will  take  an 
active role in supporting the GRM when necessary. The detailed procedures are set out in the 
Project EMP and CPF. 
ADB  rates  project  performance  quarterly,  safeguards  indicators  include  assessment  of 
67. 
whether GRM is functioning effectively, indicators of a functioning GRM, include:  
  PMU provided formal letter that confirms that the GRM has been established and is 
operational, included as an attachment- the list of GRM committee members at each 
level and the PMU and PIU focal persons for GRM. 
  Pamphlet/Leaflet and/or Project Information Booklet has the GRM steps explained and 
GRM focal point contacts and has been handed out to all AHs and available at village 
halls. Copy provided. 
  Evidence of consultation/verbal dissemination of the GRM to AHs and public 
consultation. This could be shown through presentation materials, minutes of meetings, 
photos and attendance sheet. 
  Evidence of project signage within the community and at construction sites/camps with 
GRM focal point contacts. 
  GRM focal points mobilized and functioning in their role. 
  GRM record-keeping system is established and functioning. 
  Complaints and resolutions included in quarterly progress reports and semi-annual 
safeguards monitoring reports. 
68. 
Prohibited investment activities. Pursuant to ADB’s Safeguard Policy Statement (SPS 
2009), ADB funds may not be applied to the activities described on the ADB Prohibited Investment 
Activities List set forth at Appendix 5 of SPS 2009. All financial institutions will ensure that their 
investments are in compliance with applicable national laws and regulations and will apply the 
prohibited investment activities list (Appendix 5 of SPS 2009) to any project activities financed by 
ADB. 
48 
A. 
Environment Safeguards 
69. 
For  output  1  through  financial  intermediary,  an  Environment  and  Social  Management 
System (ESMS) was developed for the PFIs which need to adopt the ESMS before they approve 
any  subproject  and  disburse  the  project  fund.  The  guarantee  scheme  fund  to  be  managed  by 
government unit will employ the same ESMS procedure and requirements for better consistency 
in risk control.  
The  IEE  assesses  impacts  of  project  activities,  the  EMP  identifies  mitigation  and 
70. 
management  measures  to  address  identified  impacts,  environmental  capacity  building  and 
consultation  plans  and  associated  costs,  as  well  as  roles  and  responsibilities  of  subproject 
designers,  construction  contractors,  output  PIUs  and  the  PMU.  The  PIC  team  includes 
Environmental Specialists to assist throughout implementation. 
71. 
The EMP includes an environmental monitoring program to confirm that the measures are 
effective and if adjustments are needed. Responsibility for monitoring is shared among the PIC, 
contractors and PIUs. All monitoring results will be consolidated in the PMU’s progress reports 
and  semi-annual  environmental  monitoring  reports  to  the  ADB.  The  outline  for  the  safeguards 
monitoring report is included in Appendix 7. 
To ensure domestic compliance on environmental, health and safety, no contract will be 
72. 
awarded without the domestic EIA clearance, if required by domestic regulation, and its conditions 
being included in the bidding documents and contracts. No project work (including that related to 
laboratories)  can  be  commenced  without  necessary  domestic  permits  on  health  and  safety 
including on covid-19. Violation of the above will need to be remedied within the timeframe agreed 
with the ADB. Continued non-compliance can lead to suspension of ADB fund disbursement or 
other penalties. 
The ESMS is a system for PFIs to screen, assess and manage the environmental-social 
73. 
impacts of their subprojects under the project. Only subprojects that have minimal or moderate 
environmental impacts and risks that are equivalent to category C and B as defined by the ADB 
and have all necessary domestic approval and permits be eligible for funding. To this end, a step-
by-step screening procedure is designed as core part of the ESMS supported by worksheets and 
checklists in line with both domestic and ADB requirements. 
74. 
For  environmental  category  B  subprojects,  the  proponent  needs  to  carry  out  simplified 
impact  assessment  mainly  following  domestic  requirements  as  summarized  in  the  ESMS, 
including  disclosure  and  public  consultation,  and  prepare  an  Environmental Management  Plan 
(EMP)  to  mitigate  the  potential  impacts  identified  in  the  assessment  and  consultation.  The 
relevant measures in the EMP prepared for the overall project apply to output 1 activity. 
75. 
All  subproject  proponents  need  to  fill  out  the  environmental  worksheets  as  part  of  the 
application and provide other information and site access as needed by the PFIs. Once selected 
for  financing,  the  sub-borrowers  are  responsible  for  implementing  the  EMP  and  applicable 
environmental code of practice (for category C). The PFI is responsible for supervision, monitoring 
and reporting according to the requirements in the ESMS. 
76. 
During  subproject  contract  period,  any  changes  to  the  subprojects  that  may  cause 
negative environmental impacts shall be screened by the environmental specialists of the PFIs, 
PMU/PIU and/or the ADB. If such impacts go beyond the original environmental category resulting 
in a rise from category C to B, impact assessment and EMP will need to be prepared according 
49 
to  the  ESMS.  In  case  of  a  category  B  subproject  originally,  a  rise  to  category  A  will  in  effect 
disqualify it for the project support. As a result, fund to such subproject will be discontinued or 
follow Non-compliance procedure described in the ESMS. 
B. 
Social Safeguards  
77. 
The project is classified as category C for involuntary resettlement (IR) and category C for 
indigenous  peoples  (IP)  as  per  ADB  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).34 The  project  is  not 
anticipated  to  cause  any  involuntary  resettlement  impacts  in  any  of  subproject  activities.  The 
project loan funds or legal process of expropriation are not allowed to be used for land acquisition 
for output 1 and output 2. No involuntary land acquisition is expected to be required for output 3 
activities.  The  expected impacts  are mostly  temporary  during  the  civil  works  activities  for rural 
roads, as detailed in the due diligence report (DDR) for output 3. Output 3 rural roads have been 
designed to be located entirely within the existing right-of-way (ROW) of the roads following road 
design criteria as prescribed in the CPF.  
CPF provides guidance on community consultations and participation prior to and during 
78. 
construction  and  project  implementation,  as  well  as  procedures  for  any  temporary  or 
unanticipated impacts. The DDR for output 3 will be prepared prior to construction of the roads, 
for the roads for which DED is under preparation, and for any new road to be financed. This will 
include  consultations,  transect  walk/drive  and  disclosure  of  information  of  the  designed  roads, 
and submitted to ADB for approval. In the event of unavoidable or unanticipated impact on the 
rural roads are identified during the project implementation project activities which will cause IR 
impacts, the concerned section/road will be either excluded from financing or a resettlement plan 
(RP) will be prepared in accordance with the laws and regulations of the Government and ADB’s 
SPS. 
79. 
Any  land  requirements  for  investments  funded  under  outputs  1  and  2  will  have  to  be 
managed or financed by the fund recipient / beneficiary, such as agricultural cooperative (AC), 
through willing buyer willing seller from open market following eligibility criteria set in ESMS35 for 
output 1, and Inclusive Business Partnership (IBP) agreement for output 2.36 The due diligence is 
conducted for output 1 as part of ESMS assessment, and a DDR is prepared for output 2 to screen 
the proposed type of activities, and assess any potential impact resulting from financing these 
activities, and inform the selection criteria in the IBP. The project funds should not be used for 
any  land  acquisition  activity.  This  is  included  as  part  of  the  eligibility  criteria  and  the  prepared 
ESMS and IBP.  
80. 
No adverse impacts on indigenous peoples are anticipated and improved rural roads in 
output 3 will benefit all households including indigenous peoples in the project areas. Meaningful 
and widespread consultations will continue with all communities in the project area. In the event 
of indigenous people issues are identified during the project implementation specific mitigation 
will be prepared in accordance to ADB’s SPS on Indigenous People safeguards or the project 
activities which will cause negative impacts to indigenous people (IP) communities (if any) will be 
excluded from financing.  
34 For the AFD co-financing partly administered by ADB, the ADB SPS will be applied to the social and environmental 
assessment and planning process, and safeguards planning documents for all project activities despite whether they 
are financed by ADB or AFD. Meaningful consultation and disclosure requirements will follow those outlined in the 
ADB SPS. ADB will monitor safeguard compliance as part of its supervision missions along with AFD.

81. 
The  MAFF  PMU  will  be responsible  for  ensuring  that  output  1  and  2  social  safeguards 
compliance is monitored throughout implementation and the project is implemented in line with 
ADB and government requirements for social safeguards. Specific tasks are listed in Table 4. The 
MAFF  PMU  will  be  staffed  with  three  project  safeguards  officers:  (i)  environment;  (ii)  social 
safeguards;  and  (iii)  gender.  The  officers  will  be  active  in  site  supervision,  management  and 
appraisal, particularly to identify potential and any current problems, and solve them in a timely 
manner. The officers will be supported by the international and national safeguards experts from 
the PIC. The safeguards officers will be provided with capacity development and training. Project 
Officer (Social Safeguard) will have overall responsibility in implementation of   outputs 1 and 2, 
including appropriate monitoring and reporting responsibilities.  
2.  
MRD/SEO  
82. 
The  Social  Safeguards  Project  Officer  (SSPO)  in  MRD/SEO,  with  assistance  from  PIC 
Social  safeguards  consultant,  will  have  overall  responsibility  in  implementation  of  the  output  3 
using CPF with support from the PIC to ensure compliance. This includes appropriate monitoring 
and  reporting  responsibilities,  and  output  3  is  implemented  in  line  with  ADB  and  government 
requirements  for  social  safeguards.  Specific  tasks  are  listed  in  Table  4.  MRD  will  appoint  a 
national  safeguards  officer  at  MRD  PIU.  S/he,  duly  assisted  by  the  international  and  national 
safeguards  experts  of  the  PIC,  will  be  active  in  site  supervision,  management,  and  appraisal, 
particularly to identify potential and any current problems, and solve them in a timely manner.

MEF & MAFF PIUs  
83. 
Third-Party  Verification.  Output  3  rural  roads  will  engage  village  development 
committees (VDCs) to act as third-party verification body for any donation of unproductive and 
unregistered land within the existing right-of-way (ROW).  
84. 
Capacity Building. For output 1, PFIs staff will be provided capacity building on ESMS 
policies checklists and criteria, screening mechanisms, safeguards monitoring and development 
of standard reporting formats. For output 2, the capacity building on safeguards compliance and 
land acquisition criteria for ACs will be provided to the PMU, and as part of the general capacity 
building  and  training  of  the  ACs  under  value  chain  improvements.  For  output  3,  MRD/SEO 
Safeguards Officers will be trained by PMC’s social safeguards expert on safeguards issues of 
the  project,  CPF  and  ADB  Safeguards  Policy.  Safeguards  briefings  will  also  be  conducted  by 
PMC safeguards experts to the relevant project team members. The targeted participants of the 
briefings would be MRD/SEO and PIU staff, and VDCs. The briefings will include the procedure 
and required measures for implementation of the project GRM. The PMC’s safeguard experts will 
develop the training schedule and module upon their mobilization and share it with the PMU and 
ADB.  
85. 
Civil  Works  Contracts  and  Contractors.  The  project  will  ensure  that  bidding  and 
contract  documents  include  specific  provisions  requiring  contractors  to  comply  with  all  (a) 
applicable  labor  laws  and  core  labor  standards  on  (b)  prohibition  of  child  labor  as  defined  in 
national legislation for construction and maintenance activities, on (c) equal pay for equal work of 
equal  value  regardless  of  gender,  ethnicity  or  caste,  on  (d)  elimination  of  forced  labor,  (e)  the 
requirement to disseminate information on sexually transmitted diseases including HIV/AIDS to 
employees  and  local  communities  surrounding  the  project  sites,  and  (f)  responsibility  of  the 
construction contractor for reinstatement of temporary impacts and compensation for construction 
51 
related  impacts  during  implementation  of  rural  roads  (output  3).  Contractors  will  carry  out  all 
environmental and social mitigation and monitoring measures outlined in their contract, including 
paying compensation for affected assets (crops, trees, infrastructures) to the affected households. 
PIC  experts,  MRD/SEO  and  PIU  safeguard  officers  will  assist  the  PMU  safeguard  officer  in 
monitoring contractor’s compliance activities.  
VIII.   GENDER AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS 
The  project  promotes  women’s  participation  in  PAEs,  PACs,  and  as  farmers  by  (i) 
86. 
developing  and  delivering  outreach,  education,  and  community  activities  to  increase  the 
proportion of PAEs owned by women and female borrowers’ access to subloans; (ii) supporting 
women-led  PACs  in  obtaining  agro-product  safety  certificates;  (iii)  undertaking  a  needs 
assessment  and  delivering  training,  including  on  gender  sensitization,  access  to  finance, 
improved planting materials  and  breeds,  demonstration  farming,  and  leadership  skills;  and  (iv) 
delivering road safety training along the improved roads.37 Further, the project will support the two 
PFIs  in  developing  inclusive  and  gender-responsive  loan  application  criteria  and  guidelines  to 
enable successful loan applications from women-owned PAEs and female borrowers. The MAFF 
and the PFIs will appoint gender focal points to implement and monitor the gender action plan. 
87. 
The  project  is  categorized  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  Based  on  the  gender 
analysis conducted during project preparation, a gender action plan (GAP) has been prepared.38

PERFORMANCE MONITORING, EVALUATION, REPORTING, AND 
COMMUNICATION 
A. 
Project Design and Monitoring Framework  
Please refer to Appendix 1 of the RRP for the project design and monitoring framework 
88. 
(DMF). 
B. 
Monitoring  
Project  performance  monitoring.  A  draft  project  performance  monitoring  system 
89. 
(PPMS) has been developed and included in Appendix 8, based on the key indicators and targets 
outlined  in  DMF,  the  gender  action  plan,  environment  and  social  safeguards,  the  financial 
management action plan, and compliance with project covenants, among others, that need to be 
monitored. It shall be implemented by the PMU in conjunction with the implementing agencies 
and  support  from  the  PIC  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Project  Performance  Monitoring  System 
within six months of project effectiveness. The PPMS procedures, performance indicators, and 
their  targets  will  be  reviewed  and  approved  by  ADB.  Benchmark  review  mainly  focusing  on 
secondary data will be conducted. With the help of PIC, the PMU will then undertake every six 
months quantitative and qualitative project-performance monitoring for each subproject activity to 
evaluate the delivery of planned facilities and the project benefits that accrued.  
Compliance monitoring. A number of assurances have been given by the government 
90. 
to ensure smooth implementation of the project as reflected in the financing covenants. ADB will 
monitor compliance with those covenants during project implementation through regular review 
37 Women-led agricultural cooperatives are differentiated from project women-owned agro-enterprises as cooperatives, 
by definition, are not owned by any one individual, but rather are led by a collaborative partnership.

52 
missions, quarterly progress reports submitted by the PMU, and review of project accounts and 
procurement procedures. 
91. 
Environmental  safeguards  monitoring.  The  IAs,  assisted  by  PIC,  will  prepare  and 
submit to the executing agency semi-annual reports on the implementation of environmental and 
GRM requirements and monitoring results. The report will cover environment performance based 
on implementation of the EMP and ESMS. The executing agency, through PIC, will be responsible 
for the consolidation and submission of the reports to ADB. The quarterly progress reports will 
also include a summary of environmental progress and identifying any grievance raised/resolved 
through the project GRM during the reporting period. 
92. 
Social safeguards monitoring. The project has been confirmed as categorized as C for 
IR  and  IP  based  on  the  social  impact  assessment  conducted  during  the  transaction  technical 
assistance,  therefore,  the  environmental  safeguards  monitoring  reports  will  integrate  social 
safeguard  section.  PMU  will  be  responsible  for  preparing  and  submitting  a  single  semi-annual 
integrated environment and social safeguards monitoring report for the project covering Outputs 
1, 2 and 3, they will conduct in close cooperation with MEF/IA Administrator and SEO experts of 
MRD respectively.  
93. 
For the Output 1 the ESMS Manager (or other designated staff) reports to the Head of 
Credit  Department  who  reports  to  Chief  Executive  Officer  of  PFI.  The  ESMS  Manager  has 
oversight  for  environmental  and  social  issues,  ensures  the  resources  are  made  available  to 
safeguards  officer  for  environmental  and  social  management,  monitoring  and  reporting,  and 
should  sign  and  submit  the  annual  environmental  and  social  performance  report  to  the  IA 
Administrator  who  submits  the  same  to  the  EA  and  ADB.  S/he  should  ensure  that  the  IA 
Administrator for Output 1, the EA and ADB are notified if and when the responsible staff have 
been changed or replaced with new staff.  
For the Output 2, PMU, with their overall responsible for monitoring and reporting of social 
94. 
safeguards will also cover monitoring for Output 2. 
95. 
For  the  Output  3,  the  MRD  PIU  shall  be  responsible  for  supervision  of  the  CPF 
implementation and the internal monitoring throughout the implementation of the Project. The PIU 
shall collect the data as per the monitoring indicators adopted and report them to the MRD SEO. 
The  data  on  results  of  CPF  implementation  shall  be  later  consolidated  and  presented  in  the 
regular  safeguards  monitoring  reports  and  submitted  to  ADB  per  reporting  period  for  review, 
clearance and disclosure on ADB and EA’s websites. In addition, VDC, which is an independent 
legally  constituted  community  body,  will  be  the  independent  third-party  monitor  for  the 
implementation of the CPF in case voluntary asset or land donation is required. Regular feedback 
will be sought from VDC and incorporated in the regular monitoring reports submitted to ADB. 
96. 
Climate  change.  The  climate  change  assessment  concluded  that  there  are  currently 
medium to high risks for flood and low risk for drought and storm in the project provinces, and that 
these risks are likely to increase in the future.39 It is therefore important that the PIC responsible 
for infrastructure development and capacity building have sufficient climate change experience 
and capability to ensure and maximize adaptation possibilities, promote climate smart agricultural 
practices, and ensure that the project satisfactorily ensures that farmers are aware of the risks 
and the steps they can take to adapt.

53 
Gender and social dimensions monitoring. Sex-disaggregated data will be collected 
97. 
wherever relevant and gender specific and sensitive indicators (from the DMF and GAP) will be 
integrated as part of the PPMS. The progress of gender and social activities and targets outlined 
in the GAP will be monitored and reported regularly (at least semi-annually) by the PMU together 
with the project progress reports. Achievement of performance indicators of the GAP outlined in 
the DMF will be updated semi-annually in the PPMS. 
C. 
Evaluation 
98. 
ADB  will  conduct  regular  (i.e.  at  least  twice  per  year)  reviews  throughout  project 
implementation to (i) assess the progress of project activities and outputs and effectiveness of 
implementation  arrangements;  (ii)  monitor  safeguards  compliance  with  ADB  Safeguard  Policy 
Statement (2009); (iii) review compliance with loans and grant agreements and related matters; 
(iv) follow up on decisions and actions agreed during previous review missions; and (v) resolve 
any project implementation issues that may arise. Within six months of physical completion of the 
project, the executing agency will submit a project completion report to ADB. 40 
D. 
Reporting  
99. 
PMU will provide ADB with (i) quarterly progress reports in a format consistent with the

Stakeholder Communication Strategy  
100.  A stakeholder communication strategy has been prepared to ensure that vulnerable groups, such as the poor and the women, 
who  risk  marginalization,  are  provided  with  opportunities  for  receiving  timely  information,  and  can  provide  feedback  during  project 
implementation. Table 14 explains further on what project information will be communicated, the means of communication, who will 
provide the information, the audiences and the frequency.

ANTICORRUPTION POLICY 
101.  ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any violations of the 
Anticorruption  Policy  relating  to  the  project. 41  All  contracts  financed  by  ADB  shall  include 
provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the 
executing agency and all project contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers. 
Individuals and/or entities on ADB’s anticorruption debarment list are ineligible to participate in 
ADB-financed activity and may not be awarded any contracts under the project. 42  
these  efforts, 
relevant  provisions  are 
102.  To  support 
loan 
agreements/regulations  and  grant  agreement/regulations  and  the  bidding  documents  for  the 
project. The project design and implementation arrangements provide for mitigation of corruption 
risks. Risks associated with project management, including procurement and disbursement, will 
be mitigated by the engagement of PIC to advise and assist in the procurement of goods and 
services, and the engagement of other consultants. The project will also establish a website in 
which  it  will  disclose  implementation  progress,  bid  notifications  and  their  results,  and  provide 
grievance mechanism against any corrupt practice. References on ADB’s Anticorruption Policy 
can  be  accessed  through  the  following  link:  http://www.adb.org/integrity/.  Guidelines  on 
governance and anticorruption action plan are also available. 43

ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISM 
103.  People  who  are,  or may  in the  future  be,  adversely  affected  by the  project  may  submit 
complaints  to  ADB’s  Accountability  Mechanism.  The  Accountability  Mechanism  provides  an 
independent forum and process whereby people adversely affected by ADB-assisted projects can 
voice,  and  seek  a  resolution  of  their  problems,  as  well  as  report  alleged  violations  of  ADB’s 
operational  policies  and  procedures.  Before  submitting  a  complaint  to  the  Accountability 
Mechanism, affected people should make an effort in good faith to solve their problems by working 
with  the  concerned  ADB  operations  department.  Only  after  doing  that,  and  if  they  are  still 
dissatisfied, should they approach the Accountability Mechanism. 44

APPENDIX 3: SUBLOAN ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA 
I. 
ACSEP FINANCIAL SCHEMES 
To  help  agribusinesses  and  agricultural  cooperatives  access  credit,  the  project  will 
1. 
introduce three complementary financial schemes: agricultural value chain loan credit line (AVCL-
CL), equity capital loan credit line (ECL-CL) and credit guarantee fund (EGF). 
The  AVCL-CL  aims  to  encourage  and  motivate  commercial  banks  and  other  financial 
2. 
institutions serving as PFIs under ACSEP to extend financial services to eligible agribusinesses, 
agricultural cooperatives and farmers engaged in project-supported agricultural commodity value 
chains and investment sub-projects. Under the AVCL-CL, participating financial institutions (PFIs) 
will be able to offer eligible borrowers four types of specialized loan products tailored to various 
needs of the eligible borrowers. In addition, output 1 of ACSEP also introduce two other financial 
schemes. The ECL-CL aims to support AVCLs by providing supplemental equity to the borrower 
through subordinated equity loans, thereby allowing the borrower to meet the lender’s minimum 
equity  requirements  for  conventional  financing.  The  CGF  aims  to  help  PFIs  spread  risk  more 
evenly between the CGF, lenders and borrowers, thereby reducing the lender’s dependency on 
collateral. 
To help implement the financial schemes, general operating guidelines were developed 
3. 
and they include below borrower eligibility criteria and activity eligibility criteria.45

APPENDIX 8: PROJECT PERFORMANCE MONITORING SYSTEM 
1. 
This  document  presents  the  project  performance  monitoring  system  (PPMS)  for  the 
Cambodia  Agricultural  Value  Chain  Competitiveness  and  Safety  Enhancement  Project  (the 
project)  funded  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank (ADB),  Agence  Française  de  Développement 
(AFD),  Inclusive  Finance  Facility  under  the  ASEAN  Infrastructure  Fund  (AIF),  Japan  Fund  for 
Poverty Reduction (JFPR), and the Royal Government of Cambodia. The PPMS is developed for 
monitoring the indicators and targets for outcome and outputs outlined in the project design and 
monitoring framework (DMF) and against those targets and indicators in the Gender Action Plan 
(GAP),  environment  and  social  safeguards,  financial  management,  and  those  covenants  as 
detailed in the loans and grant agreements. 
Impact, Outcome, and Outputs. [Copy the impact, outcome, and outputs in paras. 9 to

3. 
Project  Areas.  The  project  will  strengthen  value  chains  of  competitive  agricultural 
products  (CAPs)—cassava,  mangoes,  cashew  nuts,  vegetables,  and  native  chicken—in  the 
provinces of Kampong Cham, Kampong Thom, Oddar Meanchey, Preah Vihear, Siem Reap, and 
Tboung Khmum.1 
Project Costing. The project cost is estimated at $110.06 million, $70 million from the

Data Management: The process of data management consists of data collection, data 
communication, analysis and reporting. Data will be collected on all the indicators defined in the 
DMF by the PMU, the PIC, and the PIUs. The data collected will be reported to the M&E officer 
of  the  PMU  who  will  be  supported  by  the  PMU  Project  Director  and  the  relevant  PIC  team 
members, particularly those working in management, procurement, and contract implementation. 
The  social  development,  gender  inclusion,  social  safeguards,  and  environmental management 
and climate change adaptation aspects of the subprojects will be monitored by the PIC Experts 
and  Specialists  in  close  collaboration  with  the  Regional  Representatives  of  the  PMU,  and  the 
PIUs. The regional Representatives will play an important role in the collection of data during the 
subproject implementation process and capacity building activities. 
The PIC, the PMU, and the PIUs will compile the information on the project implementation 
10. 
and the PMU will aggregate and analyze the ensuring the necessary details and data are relevant 
to verify performance and to evaluate the outputs. The PMU will subsequently update the PPMS 
with support of PIC.  
11. 
Data on indicators related to the PFIs will be monitored by the relevant PIU for Output 1. 
All  concerned  PIUs  for  each  of  the  three  outputs  will  monitor  gender,  social  safeguards  and 
development and the capacity building activities linked to the subprojects.  
Status of Compliance with Loans and Grant Covenants: There are a number of loans 
12. 
and  grant  covenants,  out  of  which  the  PPMS  will  indicate  and  report  the  number  where 
compliance has been achieved, or if they are partly complied and are ongoing, and are still not 
met  or  are  not  yet  due.  The  list  of  covenants  under  relevant  categories  and  their  status  of 
compliance as of a certain date is provided in the table below.
