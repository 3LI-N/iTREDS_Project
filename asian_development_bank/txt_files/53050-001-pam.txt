Project Administration  Manual Purpose and Process 
1.  The  project  administration  manual  (PAM)  describes 
the  essential  administrative  and 
management  requirements  to implement  the project  on time, within  budget, and  in accordance 
with  the policies  and procedures  of the  borrower,  the Government  of the  People’s  Republic  of 
China;  and  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  The  PAM  should  include  references  to  all 
available  templates  and  instructions  either  through  linkages  to  relevant  URLs  or  directly 
incorporated  in the PAM. 
2.  The  Xiangxi  Tujia  and  Miao  Autonomous  Prefectural  Government,  the  executing  agency;  and 
the  Jishou  City  Government  and  the  county  governments  of  Baojing,  Fenghuang,  Guzhang, 
Huayuan,  Longshan,  Luxi,  and  Yongshun,  the  implementing  agencies,  are  wholly  responsible 
for the implementation  of the ADB-financed projects, as agreed jointly between the borrower and 
ADB; and in accordance with the policies and procedures of the government  and ADB. The ADB 
staff is responsible  for supporting the implementation,  including compliance  by the Xiangxi Tujia 
and  Miao  Autonomous  Prefectural  Government;  the  Jishou  City  Government;  and  the  county 
governments  of  Baojing,  Fenghuang,  Guzhang,  Huayuan,  Longshan,  Luxi,  and  Yongshun  of

PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
1. 
As one of the three key economic growth engines in the People’s Republic of China (PRC), 
the Yangtze  River  Economic  Belt (YREB)  and its nine provinces  and  two specially  administered 
municipalities  account for more than 40% of the PRC’s population and freshwater resources, and 
45%  of  the  country’s  economic  output. 1  While  the  YREB  has  benefited  from  extensive 
development  since the 1990s, economic  growth in the middle  and upper reaches of the Yangtze 
River  Basin  significantly  lags  the  lower  reaches;  the  middle  and  upper  reaches  face  particular 
challenges  from  (i)  weak  institutional  capacities  and  poor  coordination  between  institutions;  (ii) 
increasing  pollution  and  pressure  on  natural  resources;  (iii)  slow  transformation  into  green 
development;  and  (iv)  limited  integration  of  waterways,  ports,  and  intermodal  logistics. 2   To 
manage these challenges, the Government of the PRC formulated  the YREB Development  Plan, 
2016–2030.3  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and the  government  have agreed  to adopt  a 
framework  approach  to  support  the  plan,  focusing  on  (i)  institutional  strengthening  and  policy 
industrial 
reform, 
transformation,  and (iv) construction of an integrated  multimodal  transport corridor.  
restoration  and  environmental  protection, 
(ii)  ecosystem 
(iii)  green 
2. 
In many rural areas of the YREB, agricultural production and rural livelihoods have lagged 
behind  industrial  production  and  urban  livelihoods,  income  inequality  and  poverty  are  still 
persistent.  The  majority  of  rural  wastewater  and  other  wastes  are  being  directly  discharged  to 
waterways;  and  solid  waste,  particularly  plastic  waste,  is  increasing.  To  promote  poverty 
reduction,  rural  development,  and  green  and  inclusive  growth,  the  government  formulated  the 
National  Strategic  Plan  for  Rural  Vitalization,  2018–2022. 4  The  strategic  plan  focuses  on 
agricultural  modernization;  rural  wastewater  and  waste  management;  rural–urban  integration; 
ecosystem  services  protection;  rural  health  and  education  services  development;  rural 
governance  reform, including enhancement  of policy frameworks;  institutional and organizational 
development;  and capacity building. 
3. 
As  part  of the  YREB,  the  Xiangxi  Tujia  and  Miao  Autonomous  Prefecture  (Xiangxi)  is in 
Hunan Province,  and is between the Yangtze  River and the PRC’s designated  special economic 
zones.5 Xiangxi is also at the border between the central and western PRC and is the only part of 
Hunan  that is targeted  under the  China Western  Development  policy.6 Xiangxi  has  one city  and 
seven  counties;  and a land area  of 15,462 square  kilometers  which  is dominated  by mountains; 
about 70.2% of the mountainous area is forest; and urban areas comprise 556 square kilometers. 7 
At the end of 2018, the total registered population of Xiangxi was 3.0 million, with 54% being rural 
residents. The ethnic population,  mainly the Miao and Tujia people, accounts for 80% of the total 
population of Xiangxi. The total production value in Xiangxi was CNY58.3 billion in 2017, of which 
1  The  other  key economic growth  engines  are the  Belt  and  Road  Initiative  and  the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei  Integrated 
Regional  Development  Strategy. 
2  Green  development  is  a  sustainable  development  concept  underpinned  by  three  pillars:  (i)  environmental 
responsiveness,  (ii) resource efficiency, and  (iii) community and cultural  inclusiveness.  It enables  a single  project to 
approach  environmental  protection  and inclusive  economic development  in an integrated  manner.

5  The  PRC designated  Shantou,  Shenzhen,  and  Zhuhai  in  Guangdong  Province; Xiamen  in Fujian  Province; and  all 
of Hainan  Province as special  economic zones  during  1980−  1984.  The  special  economic zones  are  given special 
economic policies  and flexible governmental  measures,  which attract firms to do business  there. 
6  China  Western  Development  is a policy adopted  in 1999  to develop the  western  regions  that  were severely lagging 
behind.   
7  Xiangxi’s  one  city  is  Jishou  City  and  its  seven  counties  are  Baojing,  Fenghuang,  Guzhang,  Huayuan,  Longshan, 
Luxi, and Yongshun  counties.

CNY8.4  billion  was  by  the  primary  industry,  CNY17.9  billion  by  the  secondary  industry,  and 
CNY31.9  billion  by  the  tertiary  industry.  The  per  capita  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  was 
CNY22,094  in 2019. 
Xiangxi  is  one  of  the  poorest  regions  in  the  PRC.  All  of  its  seven  counties  are  national 
4. 
poverty counties designated  by the Government  of the PRC. At the end of 2018, the incidence of 
rural poverty  in Xiangxi  was 5.2%  and urban  poverty  4.3%. Of  the 49.2 million  cubic meters  per 
year of wastewater  in Xiangxi, only 7.4 million cubic meters per year are treated. About 24.7% of 
the  villages  do  not  have  solid  waste  collection  or processing  facilities.  Garbage  classification  is 
not  practiced;  but  is  needed  for  the  reduction  and  recycling  of  garbage,  particularly  for  plastic 
waste.  Residents  do  not  have  adequate  capacity  for  solid  waste  management,  including 
classification  and recycling,  and institutional  capacities  for solid waste  management  is still weak. 
About 48.2% of households  do not have sanitary toilets. The lack of wastewater  and solid waste 
management  negatively  impacts the living environment  and health of Xiangxi’s  rural residents.  
5. 
The mountainous  landscape in Xiangxi makes farming less suitable  and profitable.  There 
are  135,000  hectares  of  arable  land,  which  is only  8.7%  of the  total  land area.  Xiangxi  has  rich 
local-featured vegetation. Agricultural GDP is CNY14 billion, or 14.4% of the total GDP in Xiangxi. 
About 60% of the agricultural  GDP is from local-featured  products,  given the prefecture’s  unique 
climate  and  biosphere. 8   These  products  include  citrus,  kiwifruit,  camellia,  tea,  and  herbal 
medicine.  However,  yields  are  highly  variable  and  of  low  value  because  of  the  poor  quality  of 
seeds  and  seedlings,  use  of  chemical  fertilizer  and  pesticide  (resulting  in  nonpoint  source 
pollution),  outdated  agricultural  and  forestry  production  and  management  systems,  and 
inadequate  cold chains.   
6. 
The  Government  of  the PRC  designated  Xiangxi  as  Tujia  and  Miao  Cultural  Ecosystem 
Conservation  Area,  one  of  the  seven  National  Cultural  Ecosystem  Conservation  Areas  in  the 
PRC. 9  There  are  three  national  nature  reserves,  three  national  forest  parks,  three  national 
geological parks, two national scenic spots, one national wetland park, and a World Heritage Site 
of  the  United  Nations  Educational,  Scientific,  and  Cultural  Organization  (the  Tusi  site  at 
Laosicheng in Yongshun County). All these reserves and parks are of high ecological and cultural 
value,  attracting  57.2  million  visitors  in  2019.  Seven  expressways  connecting  local  cities  and 
counties  have  been  opened  successively  in  Xiangxi.  Xiangxi  is  becoming  part  of  an  economic 
circle, including Changsha,  Chongqing,  Guilin, and Guiyang, with the construction  of the Zhang–
Jihuai highspeed  railway and  the Xiangxi Airport.10 Xiangxi  also plays  a leading role  in industrial 
integration in the PRC with a national agricultural technology  zone in Huayuan County and a pilot 
industrial zone in Yongshun County. 
7. 
However,  Xiangxi’s  unique  combination  of  natural  and  cultural  diversity  (with  high 
ecological  and  cultural  value)  as well  as its  transportation  and agricultural  advantages  have  not 
been fully utilized to enhance residents’ living conditions and livelihood opportunities.  The poverty 
ratio remains  high; institutional  capacities  are weak; and job opportunities  are limited, especially 
for women in Xiangxi. To increase rural industrial  productivity, generate job opportunities,  reduce 
poverty  and  inequality,  and  empower  women  and enhance  gender  equality,  Xiangxi’s  approach 
to rural  vitalization  includes  (i) producing  organically  certified  ecological  agricultural  and  forestry 
8  For  this  project,  local-featured  products  refer to products  which are  produced  or  harvested  in a  local  area,  making 
the  best  use  of the  local  climate, geographic  conditions,  and  resources;  represent  and  make the area  famous; are 
demanded  by other areas;  and provide  livelihood  opportunities  and  develop economy in the area.

of the PRC.

value chain improvements (production, processing, and marketing) and promotion od ecotourism; 
and (iii) strengthening  institutions  and building capacities.

improvement.  The  strategy  and  the  plan  identify  the  key  growth  engines  for  Xiangxi  to  realize 
high-value agricultural and forestry products and ecotourism backed by research, technology, and 
value chain development  and supported by institutional and capacity development.     
9. 
Xiangxi  is  an  appropriate  demonstration  area  for  rural  environmental  improvement  and 
green  development  since  it (i) is one of the poorest  regions  in the PRC,  (ii) is an important  area 
to  connect  the  central  and  western  regions  of  the  PRC  and  the  Yangtze  River  and  special 
economic zones in the southern provinces, (iii) has agricultural and forestry products with potential 
for further development,  (iv) has unique tourism resources  and environmental  and transportation 
advantages,  and  (v)  plays  a  leading  role  in  industrial  integration  in  the  PRC  through  its  two 
industrial zones. 
10. 
Coronavirus  disease  pandemic.  The  coronavirus  disease  (COVID-19)  pandemic  that 
began in the beginning of 2020 has amplified the interlinkages between biodiversity, public health, 
and ecosystem-dependent  global  supply chains.  The COVID-19  pandemic  is being contained  in 
the  PRC;  but  it  remains  a  risk,  particularly  for  rural  remote  areas  that  depend  on tourism.  With 
growing recognition  of the need for measures to prevent the spread  of infectious  diseases  in the 
future, rural vitalization is a key part of the PRC’s recovery  from COVID-19. 
Strategic  fit.  The  project  will  demonstrate  environmental  improvement  and  green 
11. 
development  through  natural  capital  investment  in  the  rural  areas  of Xiangxi.  This  is consistent 
with  (i)  the  PRC’s  Thirteenth  Five-Year  Plan,  2016–2020,11 which  aims  to  eradicate  extreme 
poverty  and  balance  the  development  of  rural  and  urban  areas  for  improvement  of  agricultural 
productivity  and  rural  incomes;  (ii) the  PRC’s  rural  vitalization  strategy  for 2018–2022  (footnote 
3),  which  promotes  poverty  reduction,  rural  development,  and  green  and  inclusive  growth;  (iii) 
ADB’s Strategy 2030,12 which (a) emphasizes the importance of addressing the remaining poverty, 
reducing  inequalities,  and  promoting  rural  development  and  food  safety;  and  (b)  encourages 
upper  middle-income  countries  to  strengthen  institutions  and  share  knowledge;  and  (iv)  ADB’s 
country partnership  strategy for the PRC, 2016–2020,  which aims to support  inclusive economic 
growth  by  reducing  poverty  and  inequality.13  It is  also  in line  with  the  Sustainable  Development 
Goals 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 12, 13, and 15.14

12. 
The  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  rural  vitalization  with  environmental 
improvement  and green  development  in the YREB  realized  (footnotes  2 and  3). The project  will 
have  the  following  outcome:  rural  living  environment  and  value  of  agricultural  and  forestry 
products in Xiangxi enhanced.15  A total of 32 subprojects will be implemented across one city and 
seven counties in Xiangxi. 
Output 1: Rural waste and sanitation management  facilities and services improved. 
13. 
Activities  for  this  output  will  include  (i)  construction  and  operation  of  wastewater  management 
systems  for about  45,800  households  with  innovative  technologies  (e.g.,  distributed  wastewater 
management  systems),  innovative  arrangements  (e.g.,  a public–private  partnership  appropriate 
for  the  operation  and  maintenance  [O&M]  of  small  wastewater  management  systems  in  rural 
areas),  and  capacity  development  of  technicians  for  the  O&M  of  the  wastewater  management 
systems, considering  citywide or countywide inclusive sanitation; (ii) solid waste management for 
about  87,500  households  through  the  establishment  of  garbage  transfer  stations  and  rural 
garbage  management  teams,  of which  at least  30% are led  by women;  and  (iii) the provision  of 
sanitary toilets to about 5,500 rural households.

Lessons. The project design has incorporated lessons from international practices related 
to  rural  vitalization  and  agricultural  development,  such  as  the  importance  of  (i)  climate-smart 
agricultural practices; (ii) improvement of farming technologies and marketing; (iii) help for farmers 
in  improving  their  access  to markets  and  product  quality  control;  (iv)  value  chain  development, 
resulting in the promotion  of specialized agricultural products;  (v) development, participation,  and 
empowerment  of farmers  and farmer organizations;  (vi)  effective institutional  arrangements  and 
government  management;  (vii)  sustainable  O&M  with  capacity  development;  and  (viii)  a 
monitoring  and evaluation  (M&E) system for project performance. 
C. 
Value Added by ADB  
Value added by ADB assistance.  Based on its international  experience  and knowledge, 
19. 
ADB  has  added  innovative  features  to  the  project,  including  but  not  limited  to,  (i)  distributed 
wastewater management systems, which have advantages over the traditional centralized system 
such as lower operation cost; (ii) a public–private partnership appropriate for the O&M of the small 
wastewater  management  systems  in  rural  areas  (ADB  funding  will  induce  private  sector’s 
participation  in and financing  for the  O&M); (iii)  garbage  classification  and  recycling  (particularly 
recycling of plastic); (iv) technologies to produce  quality local-featured  ecological  agricultural and 
forestry  products;  (v)  methodologies  to  add  value  to  local-featured  ecological  agricultural  and 
forestry  products,  including  improvement  of  value  chains  and  integration  of  agriculture  and 
forestry  with  ecotourism;  and  (vi) institutional  and  capacity  development  for the management  of 
rural  waste, the  development  of local-featured  ecological  agricultural  and  forestry  products,  and 
the value addition  to the local products.   
20. 
Nature-positive  recovery  from the  COVID-19  pandemic.  The  project  will contribute  to 
holistic  development  in the YREB  by prioritizing  investments  in  natural capital  conservation  and 
6 
restoration  and  shifting traditional  investments  toward  the valuing  of nature  and the reduction  of 
inequalities in rural areas. Rural vitalization is a key part of the nature-positive  stimulus packages 
for recovery  from the COVID-19  pandemic, aimed at building resilience in the YREB in the short, 
medium,  and  longer  terms.  Nature-based  approaches  focus  on  natural  capital  investments, 
including promotion of waste and sanitation management,  climate resilience, resilient sustainable 
agriculture,  and  sustainable  value  chains.  With  the  integration  of  nature-based  solutions,  the 
project  will  introduce  complementary  elements  across  sectors  to  address  multi-dimensional 
issues  with  a  multi-stakeholder  approach.  By  promoting  greener  and  healthier  growth  models 
which will  focus on nature  and strengthen  institutional  and  governance  mechanisms,  the project 
will create a safe and healthy living environment,  reducing  the risk of epidemics  in the future. 
21. 
Knowledge  management  and  dissemination.  Experiences  and  knowledge  gained 
through  the project will be disseminated  and replicated  in other poor rural  areas in the PRC and 
ADB’s  developing  member  countries.  One  of  the  main  vehicles  to  share  knowledge  and  an 
accelerator  for  nature-positive  investments  will  be  the  Natural  Capital  Lab,  currently  under 
development.  It will provide a regional  platform to scale natural  capital investments  and create  a 
marketplace  for  nature-positive  recovery  solutions  with  sustained  impacts.  Project  results  and 
lessons will be leveraged through  the ADB−PRC  Regional Knowledge  Sharing Initiative.17  Some 
of  the  outputs  for  knowledge  sharing  will  be  workshops;  publication  of  high-quality  knowledge 
products,  including  working  papers  and  academic  articles;  e-learning  activities;  strategic 
partnership  with centers  of excellence;  policy toolkits; and award programs.

FINANCIAL  MANAGEMENT 
A. 
Financial  Management  Assessment 
The financial  management  assessment  (FMA) was conducted  from May to June 2020 in 
32. 
accordance  with  ADB’s  Guidelines  for  the  Financial  Management  and  Analysis  of  Projects  and 
the Financial Due Diligence:  A Methodology  Note. The COVID-19  pandemic that occurred  in the 
beginning  of 2020 did not affected  the FMA since the XPG and the implementing  agencies  were 
back to normal  operations  before the FMA  was conducted.  The FMA considered  the capacity of 
the XPG and the implementing  agencies,  including fund  flow arrangements,  staffing,  accounting 
and financial reporting  systems, financial information  systems,  and internal and external  auditing 
arrangements.  Based  on the assessment,  the key financial  management  risks identified  include 
lack  of  familiarity  with  ADB’s  requirements  and  procedures  for  disbursement;  and  lack  of 
familiarity  with ADB’s  requirements  for financial  management,  particularly  accounting,  reporting, 
and auditing. It is concluded  that the overall pre-mitigation  financial management  risk of the XPG 
and the implementing  agencies  is moderate.22  The FMA confirmed  that, with the implementation 
of  the  financial  management  action  plan  below,  the  XPG  and  the  implementing  agencies  can 
properly  conduct  financial  management,  including  fund  flow  management,  use  of  statement  of 
expenditures  (SOE) procedures,  accounting  and financial  reporting,  and  auditing. The  XPG and 
the implementing agencies have agreed to implement an action plan as key measures to address 
the  deficiencies.  The  financial  management  action  plan  is  provided  in  Table  V-1.  An  advance 
account will be established  and managed  by the Hunan Provincial  Finance Department  (HPFD). 
The HPFD has established  and managed advance  accounts for about 10 ADB projects.

Disbursement 
1. 
Disbursement  Arrangements  for ADB Funds 
The  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  Loan  Disbursement 
33. 
Handbook  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time),  and  detailed  arrangements  agreed  upon 
between the government and ADB.23 Online training for project staff on disbursement policies and 
procedures  is  available.24  Project  staff  are  encouraged  to  avail  of  this  training  to  help  ensure 
efficient disbursement  and fiduciary control. 
34. 
The  XPG,  including  the  PMO,  will  be  responsible  for  disbursement  arrangements  for 
expenditures  related  to  activities  which  the  XPG  conducts,  including  provision  of  consulting 
services,  research,  project  publicity,  and study  visits.  The  implementing  agencies,  including  the 
local  PMOs,  will  be  responsible  for  disbursement  arrangements  for  expenditures  related  to 
activities  which  the  implementing  agencies  conduct,  including  construction  and  operation  of 
facilities  and  provision  of  equipment  for  waste  and  sanitation  management,  local-featured 
ecological  agricultural  and  forestry  product  development,  and  value  addition  to  local-featured 
ecological  agricultural  and  forestry  products;  and  relevant  research,  publicity,  and  capacity 
development. 
35. 
Each  of  the  eight  local  PMOs  prepare  the  withdrawal  applications,  obtain  the  City  or 
County  Finance Bureau’s  endorsement  of the withdrawal  applications,  and  submit the endorsed 
withdrawal applications to the PMO. The PMO prepares the consolidated withdrawal applications, 
obtain the XPG Finance  Bureau’s endorsement,  and submit them to the HPFD. The HPFD, after 
its review and endorsement,  will submit the withdrawal  applications  to ADB.

Advance  fund  procedure.  The  HPFD  will  establish  and  maintain  an  advance  account. 
The currency of the advance  account is Euro. The advance  account is to be used exclusively for

ADB’s  share  of  eligible  expenditures.  The  HPFD  that  administers  the  advance  account  is 
accountable  and responsible for proper use of advances  to the advance  account. 
37. 
The total outstanding  advance  to the advance account  should not exceed the estimate of 
ADB’s  share  of  expenditures  to  be  paid  through  the  advance  account  for  the  forthcoming  6 
months.  The  XPG  through  the  HPFD  may  request  for  initial  and  additional  advances  to  the 
advance  account  based  on  an  Estimate  of  Expenditure  Sheet,  setting  out  the  estimated 
expenditures  to  be  financed  through  the  account  for  the  forthcoming  6  months.25 Supporting 
documents should be submitted to ADB or retained by the HPFD, the XPG, and the implementing 
agencies in accordance  with ADB’s Loan Disbursement  Handbook  (2017, as amended  from time 
to time) when liquidating  or replenishing  the advance account.

expenditures  or  liquidation  of  advances  to  the  advance  account.  Supporting  documents  and 
records  for  the  expenditures  claimed  under  the  SOE  should  be  maintained  and  made  readily 
available  for  review  by  ADB’s  disbursement  and  review  missions,  upon  ADB’s  request  for 
submission  of supporting  documents  on a sampling  basis, and for independent  audit.  
39. 
Before the submission  of the first withdrawal  application, the HPFD should submit to ADB 
sufficient  evidence  of the authority  of  the person(s)  who  will sign  the withdrawal  applications  on 
behalf  of  the  HPFD,  together  with  the  authenticated  specimen  signatures  of  each  authorized 
person.  The  minimum  value  per  withdrawal  application  is  stipulated  in  the  Loan  Disbursement 
Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time). Individual payments below such amount should 
be paid (i) by the XPG and the implementing  agencies, and subsequently  claimed to ADB through 
reimbursement;  or (ii) through  the advance  fund procedure,  unless  otherwise  accepted  by ADB. 
The  XPG  and  the  HPFD  should  ensure  sufficient  category  and  contract  balances  before 
requesting  disbursements.  Use of ADB’s  Client  Portal  for Disbursements  system  is encouraged 
for submission  of withdrawal applications  to ADB. 27

The XPG and the implementing  agencies  will timely  provide counterpart  funds for works; 
project  preparation,  project  management,  procurement,  and audit;  environmental  management; 
land  acquisition  and  resettlement;  social  development;  contingencies;  and  financial  charges 
during project implementation  as specified  in the loan and project agreements. The XPG and the 
implementing  agencies  will  disburse  counterpart  funds  to  contractors,  suppliers,  service

Accounting 
42. 
The XPG will maintain, or cause to be maintained, separate books and records by funding 
source for all expenditures  incurred on the project, following the Accounting Methods for Projects 
Financed  by  the  World  Bank  (reference  No.  2000  [13]).28 The  XPG  will  prepare  consolidated 
project financial statements in accordance with the government’s accounting laws and regulations 
which are consistent with the international  accounting  principles  and practices. 
D. 
Auditing and Public Disclosure 
43. 
The XPG will consolidate  all financial  information  of itself and the implementing  agencies 
into  one  set  of  detailed  project  financial  statements  and  cause  the  Hunan  Provincial  Audit 
Department in the Hunan Provincial Government, authorized by the National Audit Department of 
the  PRC,  to  audit  the  consolidated  detailed  project  financial  statements  in  accordance  with  the 
PRC’s auditing standards. The audited project financial statements  for the whole project together 
with the auditor’s opinion will be presented in the English language  to ADB within 6 months from 
the end of the fiscal year by the XPG.  
44. 
The audit report for the project financial  statements  will include a management  letter and 
auditor’s  opinions,  which  cover  (i)  whether  the  project  financial  statements  present  an accurate 
and  fair  view  or  are  presented  fairly,  in  all  material  respects,  in  accordance  with  the  applicable 
financial reporting standards; (ii) whether the proceeds of the loan were used only for the purposes 
of the project; and (iii) whether the XPG was in compliance  with the financial covenants contained 
in the legal agreements. 
Compliance with financial reporting and auditing requirements will be monitored by review 
45. 
missions  and during  normal  program  supervision,  and  followed  up regularly  with all  concerned, 
including the external auditor.   
The XPG  and  the implementing  agencies  have  been made  aware  of ADB’s  approach  to 
46. 
delayed  submission  and  the requirements  for satisfactory  and  acceptable  quality  of the  audited 
project  financial  statements.29  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  require  a  change  in  the  auditor  (in  a 
manner  consistent  with the constitution  of the borrower);  or for additional  support  to be provided 
to the auditor,  if the audits  required are  not conducted  in a manner  satisfactory  to ADB; or if the 
audits are substantially  delayed.  ADB reserves  the right to verify the project’s  financial accounts 
28 Accounting regulations  issued  by the Ministry of Finance for all foreign aid-funded  projects. 
29 ADB’s approach  and procedures  regarding  delayed submission  of audited  project  financial statements:   
(i)  When  audited  project  financial  statements  are  not  received  by the  due  date,  ADB will  write  to  the  executing 
agency  advising  that  (a)  the  audit  documents  are  overdue;  and  (b)  if  they are  not  received  within  the  next  6 
months,  requests  for new contract awards  and disbursement  such as new replenishment  of advance accounts, 
processing  of new reimbursement,  and  issuance  of new commitment letters  will not be processed. 
(ii)  When audited  project financial statements  are not received within 6 months after the due date, ADB will withhold 
processing  of  requests  for  new  contract  awards  and  disbursement  such  as  new  replenishment  of  advance 
accounts,  processing  of new reimbursement,  and  issuance  of new commitment letters.  ADB will  (a) inform the 
executing  agency of ADB’s  actions;  and (b) advise  that the  loan  may be suspended  if the  audit  documents are 
not received within the next 6 months. 
(iii)  When  audited  project  financial  statements  are  not  received  within  12  months  after  the  due  date,  ADB  may 
suspend  the loan. 
26 
to  confirm  that  the  share  of  ADB’s  financing  is  used  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  policies  and 
procedures. 
47. 
Public disclosure of the audited project financial statements, including the auditor’s opinion 
on the project  financial statements,  will be guided by ADB’s Access to Information  Policy.30 After 
the  review,  ADB  will  disclose  the  audited  project  financial  statements  and  the  opinion  of  the 
auditors  on the project financial  statements  not later than 14 days of ADB’s  confirmation  of their 
acceptability  by posting them on ADB’s website.  The management  letter and additional auditor’s 
opinions will not be disclosed.31

of its English version through ADB’s Consultant  Management  System.  
55. 
ADB review. There are two ADB review procedures  for procurement of works and goods: 
prior  review  and  post  review  (sampling).  For  contract  packages  for  prior  review,  each  step  of 
bidding  (bidding document,  bid evaluation  report,  draft negotiated  contract,  and signed contract) 
needs  ADB’s prior  review and  approval.  For contract  packages  for post-review  (sampling),  ADB 
reviews the bid evaluation report and signed contract after the contract is signed; and on sampling 
basis. Under the project, contract packages for works and goods for prior review are the 1st to 10th 
OCB  packages  for  works  and  the  1st  to  10th  OCB  packages  for  goods.  All  the  other  contract 
packages  for works and goods are for post-review  (sampling).  Regarding consulting  services, all 
contract  packages  are for prior  review.  Each  sample  size should  cover  at least  20% of  the total 
number of the post review (sampling) contracts  awarded before the initial post review (sampling), 
or  between  two  consecutive  post  reviews  (sampling).  Total  sample  size  aggregated  should 
capture contracts representing  (i) about 30%–50%  of total project value and (ii) about 20% of the 
33 http://www.adb.org/Documents/Policies/Anticorruption-Integrity/default.asp 
28 
total number of contracts identified for post review (sampling).  It should ensure that, to the extent 
possible, all types of contracts  are included in the sample.

Each contract financed with the proceeds of the Loan shall provide  that the suppliers and 
contractors  shall permit  ADB, at its request,  to inspect  their accounts  and records  relating to the 
performance of the contract and to have said accounts and records audited by auditors appointed 
by ADB. 
76. 
A  provision  shall  be  included  in  all  bidding  documents  (with  national  advertisement)  for 
works and goods contracts  financed by ADB, stating that the borrower shall reject a proposal for 
award  if it determines  that  the bidder  recommended  for award  has,  either directly  or through  an 
agent,  engaged  in corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  coercive,  or obstructive  practices  in competing 
for the contract in question. 
A  provision  shall  be  included  in  all  bidding  documents  for  the  OCB  (with  national

firm  or  individual  ineligible,  either  indefinitely  or  for  a  stated  period,  to  be  awarded  a  contract 
financed  by  ADB,  if  it  at  any  time  determines  that  the  firm  or  individual  has,  either  directly  or 
through an agent, engaged  in corrupt, fraudulent,  collusive,  coercive, or obstructive  practices; or

A. 
Environment   
VII. 
SAFEGUARDS 
Institutional  arrangements.  The  project  is  classified  by  ADB  as  Category  B  for 
79. 
environment.  The  project  environmental  safeguard  assessments  and  documents  comprise  an 
initial environmental examination (IEE), including an environmental management plan (EMP). The 
EMP  is  in  Appendix  1  of  the  IEE.  The  EMP  covers  all  project  components.  The  IEE  and  EMP 
have been  prepared  in compliance  with ADB’s Safeguard  Policy Statement  (SPS,  2009). For all 
project  matters  relating  to  environmental  safeguard,  the  EMP  forms  the  basis  of  the  loan 
agreement  between ADB and the PRC. 
80. 
Content  of  the  environmental  management  plan.  The  EMP  describes  (i)  the  project 
environmental  safeguard  objectives;  (ii)  roles  and  responsibilities  for  the  EMP  implementation; 
(iii) mitigation  measures; (iv) inspection, monitoring,  and reporting  arrangements;  (v) training and 
institutional strengthening; (vi) a project-specific  grievance redress mechanism (GRM); (vii) public 
consultation during project implementation; and (viii) a feedback and adjustment mechanism. The 
EMP identifies  specific roles and responsibilities  for all agencies  that will be involved  in the EMP 
implementation,  including  the  XPG,  the  implementing  agencies,  contractors,  construction 
supervision  companies  (CSCs),  and  operators.  The  mitigation  measures  are  tailored  to  the 
project-specific  conditions  and  risks  identified  in  the  IEE.  The  scope  and  content  of  the  EMP 
comply  with  the  SPS  for  environmental  safeguards  and  the  PRC’s  environmental  laws  and 
regulations.  All of the XPG and the implementing  agencies  are required  to comply with the EMP. 
81. 
Environmental  management  plan implementation.  The EMP will be implemented in all 
phases  of  the  project:  design,  pre-construction,  construction,  and  operation.  The  XPG  will  be 
responsible  for  ensuring  that  the  project  will  be  designed,  constructed,  decommissioned,  and 
operated  in  accordance  with  (i)  national  and  local  governments’  laws,  regulations,  procedures, 
and  guidelines  on  environment,  health,  and  safety;  (ii)  the  SPS;  and  (iii)  the  IEE,  including  the 
EMP. The XPG, through the PMO, holds final responsibility  for implementation of and compliance 
with the EMP. 
82. 
For  finalization  of  a  preliminary  design  for  each  subproject  of  the  project,  the  PMO  will 
forward the EMP to the design institute  which prepares  the preliminary  design.  The environment 
officers  of  the  PMO  and  local  PMO  will  work  with  the  design  institute  to ensure  that  safeguard 
risks  identified  in  the EMP  are  considered  in the  preliminary  design  and avoided,  minimized,  or 
mitigated. The EMP will be updated reflecting the preliminary designs, as needed. To ensure that 
bidders  will respond  to the EMP’s provisions,  the PMO and local PMOs will prepare  and provide 
the  following  specification  clauses  for  incorporation  into  the  bidding  documents:  (i)  a  list  of 
environmental  management  requirements  to  be  budgeted  by the  bidders  in  their  proposals;  (ii) 
environmental  clauses  for contractual  terms  and conditions;  and (iii) the IEE,  including  the EMP 
(updated as necessary)  for compliance.  All bidders for civil works will be required to fully address 
the EMP requirements,  especially the mitigation and monitoring measures. 
83. 
Personnel.  The  EMP will  be coordinated  by the  following  personnel:  (i) at least  one full-
time  and  qualified  PMO  environment  officer  appointed  by  the  XPG,  who  will  be  responsible  for 
overall  coordination  for the  EMP; (ii) at least  eight full-time  local PMO  environment  officers  (one 
for each of the eight local  PMOs), who  will oversee coordination  for the EMP for all subprojects, 
and  (iii)  at  least  24  full-time  social-and-environmental  safeguard  officers  within  the  agencies 
involved in the subprojects (one for each of the 24 agencies). These officers will have a combined 
role for social and environment safeguards and will lead daily coordination for the EMP (and social 
44 
safeguard  requirements)  at  the  site  level.  They  will  coordinate  closely  with  the  PMO  and  local 
PMO environment  officers. 
84. 
The  environment  officers  of  the  PMO  and  local  PMO  and  the  social-and-environmental 
safeguard  officers  of the  agencies  involved  in the  subprojects  will be  supported  in their  roles by 
(i) a national consultant for initial (start-up) project management support for environment, who will 
provide support to the PMO for initial environmental  management  activities,  including the update 
of the EMP, as necessary,  in the early phases  of implementation,  before a project  management 
support  consultant  team  is  engaged;  and  (ii)  a  national  environment  specialist  in  the  project 
management  support consultant team, who will support the XPG and the implementing  agencies 
in implementing  the EMP, including  assessments  of whether  subprojects  are consistent  with the 
scope  of  the  preliminary  designs  and  the  EMP  or  whether  new  safeguard  assessments  are 
required,  integration  of the EMP  in bidding documents  for civil works,  site visits and liaising  with 
contractors  and  the  CSCs,  and  supports  for  the  preparation  of  semiannual  environmental 
monitoring reports. Terms of reference for the positions are provided in Appendix 2 of this project 
administration  manual (PAM) and also in Appendix  2 of the EMP. 
85. 
Capacity  building.  To ensure  effective  implementation  of  the  EMP,  a  capacity  building 
program is included in the EMP for training  of staff of the XPG and the implementing  agencies in 
the EMP implementation,  mitigation  measures, supervision,  monitoring,  reporting,  and the GRM. 
Training  will  be  provided  by  the  national  consultant  for  initial  project  management  support  for 
environment  and  the  national  environment  specialist  and  other  specialists  in  the  project 
management  support  consultant  team.  Trainees  will  include  staff  of  the XPG,  the  implementing 
agencies,  contractors, and the CSCs. 
86. 
Procedures  for  feedback  and  adjustment  of  the  environmental  management  plan, 
including  in  the  event  of  noncompliance.  Based  on  site  inspections  and  monitoring  reports, 
the PMO, local PMOs, and agencies involved in subprojects  shall decide, in consultation  with the 
consultants,  whether  (i)  further  mitigation  measures  are  required  as  corrective  actions,  or  (ii) 
improvements  are  required  for  environmental  management  practices.  The  effectiveness  of 
mitigation  measures  and monitoring  plans will be evaluated  by a feedback  reporting  system and 
the  EMP  will  be  adjusted,  if  necessary.  The  environment  officers  of  the  PMO  and  local  PMOs, 
social-and-environmental  safeguard  officers  of  the  agencies  involved  in  subprojects,  and 
consultants  will  play  critical  roles  in  the  feedback  and  adjustment  mechanism.  Prior  to  making 
such changes  in the EMP,  the PMO will first seek the endorsement  of ADB.  If, during inspection 
and monitoring,  substantial  deviation from the EMP is observed  or any changes  are made to the 
project  that  may  cause  substantial  adverse  environmental  impacts  or  increase  the  number  of 
affected  people,  the  PMO  will  immediately  consult  with  ADB  and  form  an  environmental 
assessment  team  to conduct  additional  environmental  assessment.  If  necessary,  further  public 
consultation  will  be  undertaken.  A  new  or  updated  domestic  environmental  assessment  and  a 
new  IEE  (including  an  EMP)  will  be  prepared  and  submitted  to  ADB  for  review,  appraisal,  and 
public  disclosure.  The  revised  EMP  will  be  passed  to  the  contractors,  construction  supervision 
consultants,  and operators of the constructed  project facilities, for implementation.

B. 
Involuntary  Resettlement 
89. 
Category  and  impacts.  The  project  is classified  by  ADB  as Category  B  for  involuntary 
resettlement.  The  project  will  involve  a  use  11,634.10  mu  of  land,  including  state-owned  land 
occupation  of 535.10  mu, 34 permanent  land  acquisition  of  98.59  mu, land  use  rights  transfer  of 
9,860.00  mu,  and land  use for rural  public infrastructure  of 1,140.50  mu. In addition,  the  project 
will temporarily use 9.00 mu of land during construction.  The project will not involve any physical 
house relocation. A total of 61 households  with 261 persons will be affected permanently  by land 
acquisition,  of which 34 households with 151 persons will be significantly  affected. 
90. 
Resettlement  plan.  A  resettlement  plan  has  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB’s 
SPS  and  relevant  laws  and  regulations  of  the  PRC.  The  resettlement  plan  includes  adequate 
compensation  and livelihood  restoration  measures  for  affected  people.  The resettlement  plan is 
based on surveys and consultations  with affected people during  project preparation.  A GRM has 
been  established  and  incorporated  into  the  resettlement  plan.  Frameworks  for  land  use  rights 
transfer  and  land use  for public  infrastructure  have been  attached  to the  resettlement  plan.  The 
resettlement  plan  also  includes  measures  of  (i)  the  capacity  building  of  the  XPG  and  the 
implementing  agencies  to  implement  the  resettlement  plan  and  conduct  internal  monitoring  in 
compliance  with  ADB’s  requirements;  and (ii)  internal  and  external  monitoring  and  reporting  on 
implementation  of the resettlement  plan. 
91. 
Updating  the resettlement  plan. The resettlement  plan will be (i) updated based on the 
final  design,  detailed  measurement  survey,  and  census  of  affected  persons;  (ii)  disclosed  to 
affected  persons;  and  (iii)  submitted  to  ADB  for  review  and  approval  prior  to  the  award  of  civil 
works contract and commencement  of land acquisition  and resettlement. 
92. 
Capacity  building  for implementation  and monitoring  of the resettlement  plan. The 
XPG  and  the  implementing  agencies  have  capacity  to  implement  domestically  funded  projects. 
Their  capacity  will  be  strengthened  to  implement  the  resettlement  plan  and  conduct  internal 
monitoring  in  compliance  with  ADB’s  requirements  through  several  measures,  including  (i) 
appointment  of a  full-time  social  officer  to each  of  the PMO  and  local  PMOs  by the  XPG  or the 
implementing  agency;  (ii) inclusion  of a national resettlement  specialist  in a project management 
support consultant  team; (iii) training  of relevant staff of the XPG and the implementing  agencies 
on  implementation  and  monitoring  of  the  resettlement  plan;  (iv)  provision  of  training  on  ADB’s 
relevant  policy  requirements  and  assistance  to  the  XPG  and  the  implementing  agencies  in 
updating and finalizing the resettlement  plan, by an initial project management  support consultant 
for  social  safeguard  and  social  development;  and  (iv)  recruitment  of  an  external  agency  for 
semiannual  external M&E for resettlement  and social development. 
C. 
Indigenous  People or Ethnic  Minority 
Category. The project is classified by ADB as Category B for indigenous peoples or ethnic 
93. 
minorities.  There  are  368,307  ethnic  minorities  in  the  project  area,  mainly  the  Miao  and  Tujia 
people,  comprising  a big majority  of the project beneficiaries.  They will benefit  from (i) improved 
waste  and sanitation  management,  (ii) development  of local-featured  ecological  agricultural  and 
forestry products,  (iii) employment  opportunities,  and (iv) capacity development.  While the ethnic 
minority  groups  have  socioeconomic  conditions  similar  to  that  of  the  Han  population,  the  Miao 
and Tujia people  have their own languages  and cultural practices. 
34 A mu is a Chinese  unit of measurement  (1 mu = 666.67  square  meters). 
46 
Ethnic  minority  development  plan  update.  An  ethnic  minority  development  plan 
94. 
(EMDP)  has  been  prepared,  which  includes  (i)  benefits  and  targets  for  ethnic  minorities;  (ii) 
consultation, participation,  and information disclosure; (iii) GRM; (iv) implementation and capacity 
building; and (v) monitoring and reporting requirements.  The EMDP will be updated in case there 
are any changes in the project scope during the preparation of preliminary designs of subprojects 
or the project implementation. 
95. 
Capacity  building  for  implementation  and  monitoring  of  the  ethnic  minority 
development  plan.  The  project  will  strengthen  the  capacity  of  the  XPG  and  the  implementing 
agencies  to  implement  and  monitor  the  EMDP.  The  capacity  building  measures  include  (i) 
appointment  of a  full-time  social  officer  to each  of  the PMO  and  local  PMOs  by the  XPG  or the  
implementing  agency;  (ii)  inclusion  of  a  national  social  development  specialist  in  the  project 
management  support  consultant  team;  (iii)  training  of  relevant  staff  of  the  XPG  and  the 
implementing  agencies  on implementation  and monitoring  of the EMDP;  (iv) provision  of training 
on  ADB’s  relevant  policy  requirements,  by an  initial  project  management  support  consultant  for 
social  safeguard  and  social  development;  and  (iv)  recruitment  of  an  external  agency  for 
semiannual  external M&E for resettlement  and social development. 
D. 
Grievance  Redress Mechanism 
Two  project-specific  GRMs,  one  for  environmental  safeguards  and  one  for  social 
96. 
safeguards,  have  been  developed  in  compliance  with  requirements  of  the  SPS  to  address 
concerns on environment, health, safety, and social matters associated with ADB-funded projects. 
The GRMs  complement  and  build upon  existing  PRC mechanisms  for environmental  and social 
including  existing  national  environmental  complaint  hotlines  for 
complaints,  respectively, 
environmental  safeguards.  The  GRMs  have  been  designed  to achieve  the  following  objectives: 
(i)  provide  channels  of  communication  for  communities  to  raise  concerns  about  environmental 
and social  grievances  which might  result from  the project; (ii) help  prevent and  mitigate adverse 
environmental  and  social  impacts  to  communities  that  might  be  caused  by  construction  works 
and/or  operation  of  the  project;  and  (iii)  build  trust  and  respect  and  promote  productive 
relationships  between  the  XPG,  the  implementing  agencies,  and  communities.  The  GRMs  are 
accessible  to  all  residents  of  the  project  communities,  including  women,  youth,  minorities,  and 
poor  households.  Multiple  points  of  entry  are available,  including  face-to-face  meetings,  written 
complaints,  telephone  conversations,  e-mail,  and  social  media.  Details  of  the  GRMs,  including 
time-bound  flow charts of procedures,  are described  in the EMP for the environment  safeguard s 
GRM, and resettlement  plan for the social safeguards GRM. The complaint channels and redress 
procedures  are  slightly  different  for  environmental  and  social  issues,  but  the  PMO  will maintain 
an integrated  reporting  system  to document,  follow-up,  and report  all cases.  All of the  XPG and 
the  implementing  agencies  will  train  their  staff  in  the  GRMs  and  will  take  an  active  role  in 
supporting  the staff when necessary. 
E. 
Prohibited  Investment  Activities 
Pursuant  to ADB’s  SPS, ADB funds may not be applied  to the activities  described  on the 
97. 
ADB Prohibited Investment  Activities  List set forth at Appendix 5 of ADB’s SPS. 
VIII.   GENDER AND SOCIAL  DIMENSIONS 
A. 
Poverty Reduction  and Social Strategy 
The  project  is  classified  as  general  intervention  for  poverty  reduction.  The  poverty  and 
98. 
social analysis was undertaken based on extensive stakeholder consultations and socioeconomic 
47 
surveys.  A total of 422,022  residents  in the project areas,  including  108,702  poor or low-income 
people  (25.8%)  will directly benefit  from the  project through  improved  rural waste  and sanitation 
management,  development  of  local-featured  ecological  agricultural  and  forestry  products,  and 
value  addition  to  local-featured  ecological  agricultural  and  forestry  products.  It is  estimated  that 
1,317 skilled and 5,612 non-skilled  local jobs will be created during construction  and operation. A 
social development  action plan (SDAP) has been prepared, with specific targets for the poor and 
low-income  people.  The  project  will  strengthen  the  capacity  of  the  XPG  and  the  implementing 
agencies to implement and monitor the SDAP. 
B. 
Gender 
The  project  is  classified  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming,  following  ADB’s  Guidelines 
99. 
for  Gender  Mainstreaming  Categories  of  ADB  Projects. 35 A  gender  analysis  was  undertaken 
during  project  preparation,  which  showed  that  (i)  64.6%  surveyed  women  were  in  engaged  in 
farming  and  casual  work;  (ii)  had  a  low  level  of  participation  in  public  affairs  (34.5%  of  village 
committee members and 4.8% of village committee  heads were women); (iii) had low educational 
attainment  levels  (only  8.4%  of  surveyed  women  had  college  or  university  degrees);  and  (iv) 
lacked  income-generating  opportunities.  The  project  will  provide  opportunities  for  women  to 
participate in and benefit equitably from the project activities. Women will benefit particularly from 
increased  jobs,  income-generating  opportunities  (agricultural  and  forestry  products,  ecotourism, 
etc.), and better sanitation  services. 
100.  A gender  action  plan  (GAP)  has  been  prepared  to ensure  that  the  project  contributes  to 
improved  gender  equality.  Key  measures  of  the  GAP  include  (i)  skills  training  and  capacity 
building on advanced technologies for local-featured ecological agricultural and forestry products; 
(ii)  provision  to  women  of  new  skilled  and  non-skilled  job  opportunities  created  by  the  project 
(baseline  and targets  have been set based on data provided by PMOs from similar projects); (iii) 
consultations  on  preliminary  designs  of  the  subprojects  and  tariff  proposals,  with  at  least  40% 
female participants;  (iv) participation  in paid rural garbage management  teams, with at least 30% 
are women; (v) promotion of women’s entrepreneurship  and management capacity in agricultural 
and ecotourism industry that will include skills training; and (vi) women’s participation in the design 
of  e-commerce  platforms  to  integrate  their  specific  requirements  in  the  designs.  Key  gender 
targets have also been included in the design and monitoring framework. 
101.  The  project  will  strengthen  the  capacity  of  the  XPG  and  the  implementing  agencies  to 
implement and monitor the GAP. The capacity building measures include (i) appointment of a full-
time social officer  to each of the PMO and local PMOs by the XPG or the implementing  agency; 
(ii) inclusion  of a national  gender specialist  in the  project management  support  consultant  team; 
(iii)  training  of relevant  staff  of the  XPG  and  the implementing  agencies  on  implementation  and 
monitoring of the GAP; (iv) provision of training on ADB’s relevant policy requirements by an initial 
project  management  support  consultant  for  social  safeguard  and  social  development;  and  (iv) 
recruitment  of  an  external  agency  for  semiannual  external  M&E  for  resettlement  and  social 
development,  including the M&E  of the GAP.  Reporting  of gender  actions  and progress  towards 
gender  targets  in  the  DMF  and  the  GAP  will  be  provided  as  part  of  quarterly  project  progress 
reports  and semiannual  external  resettlement  and  social development  M&E  reports,  during mid-
term review, and in the project  completion report.

will include progress of the overall project and each component;  status of consulting services and 
activities  performed  by  each  consultant;  information  on  training,  workshops,  and  study  visits 
conducted; status of land acquisition and resettlement  based on internal monitoring; status of the 
implementation  of  the  EMDP,  the  SDAP,  and  the  GAP;  records  of  grievance  and  complaints; 
project  performance  (achievement  of  each  performance  indicator  against  the  target);  and 
particular issues. 
2. 
Compliance  Monitoring 
103.  The XPG, including  the PMO; the implementing  agencies,  including  the local PMOs; and 
consultants  for  project  management  support  will  closely  monitor  the  compliance  of  all  the 
covenants  included in the loan and project  agreements.  The compliance  status of the covenants 
will be  reported  through  quarterly  progress  reports.  ADB  will verify  the compliance  by reviewing 
quarterly  project  progress  reports,  communicating  with  the  PMO,  and/or  conducting  review 
missions. 
3. 
Safeguard  Monitoring 
a. 
Environment 
104.  The  environmental  monitoring  program  focuses  on  the  environment  in  affected  project 
areas. The environmental  monitoring program is included in the EMP, including parameters, time, 
and  frequency;  implementing  and  supervising  agencies;  and  estimated  costs.  Three  types  of 
monitoring will be conducted in accordance  with the EMP: (i) internal monitoring, to be conducted 
by the implementing  agencies and the CSCs; (ii) external  monitoring of air, water, noise, and soil 
standards, to be conducted by a certified external EMA engaged by the PMO; and (iii) compliance 
monitoring  to  be  conducted  by  a  national  environment  specialist  in  the  project  management 
support  consultant  team, to ensure the EMP  is being  implemented.  The monitoring  shall  comply 
with  the  standards.  ADB  will  review  project’s  compliance  with  the  EMP  standards  based  on 
semiannual environmental  monitoring reports provided by the PMO (which will include the reports 
and findings of the external EMA) and review missions. 
105. 
Internal monitoring. During construction, the PMO and local PMO environmental officers, 
social and environment  safeguard officers of agencies involved in the subprojects, and the CSCs 
will  be  responsible  for  conducting  internal  environmental  monitoring  in  accordance  with  the 
monitoring plan. Results will be reported from the CSCs to the agencies, from the agencies to the 
local PMOs, and from the local PMOs to the PMO. 
106.  External  monitoring.  The  PMO  will  contract  an  external  EMA  to  conduct  the  external 
environmental monitoring described in Section D of the EMP. The EMA will have relevant national 
certifications and capacity to undertake the external monitoring specified in the EMP. The external 
monitoring  will  be conducted  during  the entire  construction  phase  and first full  year of operation 
57 
of facilities constructed under the project. The EMA will prepare semiannual monitoring  reports of 
the methods and results. The EMA will submit  the reports to the PMO and the local PMOs at the 
same time, to ensure independence.  The PMO will include the reports of the EMA as appendices 
in the semiannual  environment  monitoring  reports  to ADB,  and will ensure  that the EMA  reports 
are not altered or edited in any way prior to submission  to ADB. 
107.  Compliance  monitoring.  The  environmental  specialist  in  the  project  management 
support consultant team will review project progress and compliance with the EMP based on field 
visits, discussions  with the PMO, local  PMOs, and  agencies involved  in subprojects,  and review 
of  monitoring  reports  provided  by  the  CSCs  and  the  EMA.  The  findings  of  the  environmental 
specialist will be reported  to ADB through semiannual  environment  monitoring  reports. 
108.  Semiannual  environmental  monitoring  reports and  disclosure.  The PMO  will submit 
semiannual  environmental  monitoring  reports to ADB. The reports will include  (i) progress  made 
for the EMP implementation;  (ii) overall effectiveness of the EMP implementation (including public 
and  occupational  health  and  safety);  (iii)  environmental  monitoring  and  compliance;  (iv) 
institutional  strengthening  and training;  (v) public  consultation  (including  the  GRM); and  (vi) any 
problems  encountered  during  construction  and  operation,  and  relevant  corrective  actions 
undertaken.  The environmental  specialist  will help  the PMO  prepare  the  reports  and submit  the 
English reports to ADB. ADB will review and disclose the reports  on the ADB website.   
109.  Environmental  acceptance  reporting.  Following  the  PRC’s  Regulation  on  Project 
Completion  Environmental  Audit  (Ministry  of  Environmental  Protection,  2001),  within  3  months 
after the completion of major subprojects, an environmental acceptance report for each subproject 
shall be (i) prepared  by the implementing  agency or a capable environmental  monitoring  institute 
in accordance  with the PRC’s Guideline  on Project  Completion  Environmental  Audit  (2017); and 
(ii)  finally  reported 
to  ADB  through  semiannual  environmental  monitoring  reports.  The 
environmental  acceptance  reports will indicate the timing, extent, and effectiveness  of completed 
mitigation and maintenance,  and needs for additional mitigation measures  and monitoring  during 
operations. 
b. 
Resettlement  Plan, EMDP, SDAP, and GAP (Social Measures) 
110. 
Internal  and  external  monitoring  of  the  implementation  of  the  resettlement  plan,  EMDP, 
SDAP, and GAP will be conducted. For monitoring of the implementation  of the resettlement plan 
and  EMDP,  monitoring  methodologies  are  specified  in  the  resettlement  plan  and  EMDP.  For 
monitoring  of the  implementation  of  the  SDAP  and the  GAP,  clear  targets  and  indicators  are in 
the  SDAP  and  GAP  and  some  indicators  are  also  included  in  the  design  and  monitoring 
framework. 
111.  To  ensure  implementation  and  monitoring  of  the  resettlement  plan,  EMDP,  SDAP,  and 
GAP,  the  resettlement  specialist,  social  development  specialist,  and  gender  specialist  in  the 
project  management  support  consultant  team  will  assist  the  PMO  and  local  PMOs,  by  working 
with relevant focal staff of the PMO and local PMOs, in (i) setting up effective monitoring systems; 
(ii)  internally  monitoring  the  implementation  of  the  plans;  and  (iii)  reporting  the  results  of  the 
internal  monitoring  to  ADB  through  quarterly  project  progress  reports  and  disclosing  relevant 
information  locally,  until  the  project  completion.  The  PMO  and  local  PMOs  will  ensure  that  civil 
works  contractors  comply  with  applicable  labor  laws  and  core  labor  standards  and  provide 
relevant training to their workers. 
58 
112.  An  external  resettlement  and  social  development  M&E  agency  will  implement  external 
M&E  of  the  implementation  of  the  resettlement  plan,  the  EMDP,  the  SDAP,  and  the  GAP, 
semiannually.36  The  cost  of  the  external  resettlement  M&E  will  be  funded  from  the  ADB  loan. 
External resettlement  and social development  M&E reports will be forwarded directly  to ADB. 
C. 
Evaluation 
113. 
In  addition  to regular  monitoring,  project  progress  and  performance  will  be  monitored  at 
least  once a  year jointly  by  ADB and  the XPG  during  ADB’s  review  mission.  ADB  and  the XPG 
will undertake  a midterm review in the mid-year of the project implementation  period to conduct a 
detailed  evaluation  of  the  project  scope,  implementation  arrangements,  progress  of  the  overall 
project  and each  component,  and  status of achieving  the performance  targets;  and recommend 
implementation 
in 
appropriate  measures, 
arrangements, reallocation of loan proceeds, changes in the ADB financing rations, and extension 
of  the  loan  closing  date.  Promptly  after  physical  completion  of the  project,  but in  any  event  not 
later  than  6 months  thereafter  or  such  later  date  as ADB  may  agree  for  this  purpose,  the  PMO 
will  prepare  and  submit  to  ADB  a  project  completion  report,  in  such  form  and  in  such  detail  as 
ADB shall reasonably request,  on the implementation  and evaluation of the project.

including  changes 
D. 
Reporting   
114.  The XPG will provide ADB with (i) quarterly project progress reports in a format agreed by 
ADB;  (ii)  semiannual  environmental  monitoring  reports;  and  (iii)  a  project  completion  report 
promptly  after  physical  completion  of  the  project,  but  in  any  event  not  later  than  6  months 
thereafter  or such  later date  as ADB  may agree  for this purpose.  The XPG  will also ensure  that 
an  external  resettlement  and  social  development  M&E  agency  will  submit  the  M&E  reports  to 
ADB. To ensure that project will continue to be both viable and sustainable,  project accounts and 
the  audited  project  financial  statements  together  with  the  associated  auditor’s  report  should  be 
adequately  reviewed. 
E. 
Stakeholder  Communication  Strategy  
115.  Project  information  will  be  disclosed  through  ADB’s  and  the  government’s  websites, 
meetings,  interviews,  focus  group  discussions,  and  community  consultation  meetings,  in 
accordance  with requirements  of ADB’s information  disclosure  policy. Main stakeholders  are the 
different  agencies  of  the XPG,  the  implementing  agencies,  beneficiaries,  affected  persons,  and 
participants  in  the  project  implementation.  Stakeholder  communication  is  also  part  of  the  IEE, 
including the EMP, resettlement plan, EMDP, SDAP, and GAP; and will be monitored accordingly. 
116.  Environment.  Meaningful  consultation,  participation,  and  information  disclosure  was 
conducted  during  project  preparation.  Information  disclosure  and  public  consultation  included 
newspaper  disclosure;  informal  communication  with  key stakeholders,  including  residents,  local 
authorities,  and  sector  specific  institutions  and  authorities;  questionnaire  surveys;  and  wider 
stakeholder  meetings  attended  by  affected  people  and  other  concerned  stakeholders.  A  GRM 
has  been  defined  to  address  community  concerns,  reduce  risks,  and  assist  the  project  in 
maximizing  environmental  and  social  benefits.  Meaningful  consultation  will  continue  throughout 
36 The  M&E of the implementation  of the  resettlement  plan  will be conducted  semiannually  during  the  implementation 
of the resettlement  plan  and annually  for 2 years after that. 
59 
project implementation,  especially prior to and during civil works. Planning for public consultations 
will ensure that environmental  and social safeguard  requirements  are discussed. 
Involuntary  resettlement.  Affected  villagers  and  households  were  consulted  during 
117. 
in 
project  preparation  and  socioeconomic  surveys.  Local 
resettlement  planning  and  their  concerns  have  been  integrated  into  the  resettlement  plan.  The 
resettlement  plan  has  also  been  posted  on  ADB’s  website.  Resettlement  information  booklets 
were  distributed  locally.  The  grievance  redress  procedures  have  been  established  and 
explanations  have been included in the resettlement  information  booklets. 
representatives  participated 
118.  Ethnic  minority  development,  social  development,  and  gender  action  plans. 
Consultations  with communities  were conducted  and will be continued during the implementation 
of the  EMDP,  SDAP,  and GAP.  Special  attention  will be paid  to the  participation  of women,  the 
poor and/or  low-income  people,  and ethnic  minority  groups.  Information  from monitoring  reports 
will be disclosed  periodically. 
119.  Public  disclosure.  ADB;  the  XPG,  including  the  PMO;  and the  implementing  agencies, 
including  the  local  PMOs,  will  disclose  relevant  project  information  to the  public  and  interested 
parties.  This  includes  particularly  the  information  regarding  the  overall  project  and  environment 
and  social  safeguards.  The  information  disclosure  measures  for  different  stakeholders  are

ANTICORRUPTION POLICY 
121.  ADB reserves  the right to investigate,  directly  or through  its agents,  any violations  of the 
Anticorruption  Policy  relating  to  the  project. 37   All  contracts  financed  by  ADB  shall  include 
provisions  which  specify  the right  of ADB to audit  and examine  the  records  and accounts  of the 
executing agency  and all project contractors, suppliers,  consultants,  and other service providers. 
Individuals  and/or  entities  on  ADB’s  anticorruption  debarment  list  are  ineligible  to  participate  in 
ADB-financed  activity and may not be awarded any contracts under the project.38 
122.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  are  included  in  the  loan  and  project 
agreements  and the bidding documents  for the project. 
XI. 
ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISM 
123.  People  who  are,  or  may  in  the  future  be,  adversely  affected  by  the  project  may  submit 
complaints  to  ADB’s  Accountability  Mechanism.  The  Accountability  Mechanism  provides  an 
independent forum and process whereby people adversely affected by ADB-assisted projects can 
voice,  and  seek  a  resolution  of  their  problems,  as  well  as  report  alleged  violations  of  ADB’s 
operational  policies  and  procedures.  Before  submitting  a  complaint  to  the  Accountability 
Mechanism, affected people should make an effort in good faith to solve their problems by working 
with  the  concerned  ADB  operations  department.    Only  after  doing  that,  and  if  they  are  still 
dissatisfied,  should they approach the Accountability  Mechanism.39 
XII. 
RECORD  OF CHANGES  TO THE PROJECT ADMINISTRATION MANUAL 
124.  All revisions and/or updates during the course of implementation should be retained in this 
section  to provide  a chronological  history of  changes  to implemented  arrangements  recorded  in 
the PAM manual,  including revision to contract awards and disbursement  S-curves.

INDICATIVE TERMS OF REFERENCE  FOR CONSULTING SERVICES  FOR 
PACKAGE  OP41-PPMO-CS03:  EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENTAL  MONITORING AGENCY 
A. 
Introduction 
1. 
This  document  sets  out  the  indicative  terms  of  reference  for  external  environmental 
monitoring  to  ensure  that  the  Hunan  Xiangxi  Rural  Environmental  Improvement  and  Green 
Development Project will be implemented in conformity with the People’s Republic of China (PRC) 
laws  and  regulations  and  the  Asian  Development  Bank’s  (ADB)  Safeguard  Policy  Statement 
(2009). The direct client  is the project management  office (PMO). The PMO is under the  Xiangxi 
Tujia and Miao Autonomous  Prefectural  Government  (XPG, the executing  agency of the project) 
and  physically  located  in  the  Development  and  Reform  Committee  of  the  XPG.  The  consulting 
services will be also provided to two local PMOs which are physically located in the Development 
and Reform Committees  of the Jishou City Government  and the county governments  of Baojing, 
Fenghuang,  Guzhang,  Huayuan,  Longshan,  Luxi,  and Yongshun  (implementing  agencies).  As a 
part  of  the  loan  conditions,  an  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  and  an  environmental 
management  plan (EMP) have  been prepared. The EMP requires  that environmental  monitoring 
of  the  construction  and  operation  of  the  facilities  will  be  conducted  by  an  external  monitoring 
agency (EMA). 
B. 
Implementation  Arrangements 
2. 
 The external environmental monitoring will be carried out by a team of specialists through 
a competent  EMA, twice a year during the construction  of the facilities and in the first year of the 
operation  of the facilities.  The monitoring  will be financed  by ADB,  and an EMA will be recruited 
by the  PMO according  to ADB’s Procurement  Policy  (2017,  as amended  from  time to  time) and 
ADB’s  Procurement  Regulations  for  ADB  Borrowers  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  
through  consultants’  qualifications  selection.  The  EMA  will  work  closely  with  the  environment 
officers of the PMO and local PMOs; the Ecological and Environmental  Protection Bureaus of the 
XPG  and  the  implementing  agencies;  and  contractors,  consultants,  communities,  and/or  other 
personnel; as required. The consulting services are expected to start in July 2021 until June 2027. 
The PMO, local PMOs, and relevant agencies of the XPG and the implementing agencies 
3. 
will assist the EMA, particularly  in the aspects of field survey,  staffing, and logistics.  Specifically, 
they will (i) provide the EMA with hard and soft copies of the EMP, domestic environmental  impact 
assessment, IEE, domestic feasibility study report, loan and project agreements,  maps, and other 
supporting materials, as necessary;  (ii) facilitate and arrange meetings with key project agencies, 
including  contractors  and construction  supervision  companies;  (iii)  conduct  overall  coordination, 
including  review  of  external  environmental  monitoring  reports;  and  a  consolidated  external 
environmental  monitoring  report;  and  (iv)  take  final  responsibility  for  submission  of  the external 
environmental  monitoring  reports and the consolidated  external environmental  monitoring  report 
to ADB. 
C. 
Reporting  Requirements 
4. 
The EMA will submit to ADB, the PMO, and local PMOs external environmental monitoring 
reports  regularly  twice  a  year during  the  construction  of the  facilities  and in  the  first  year  of the 
operation  of  the  facilities,  and  a  consolidated  external  environmental  monitoring  report  within  2 
months after the completion  of the project. For each report, the EMA will submit a soft copy of the 
Appendix 2 
 93           
English version  to ADB and soft copies of the English and Chinese versions  to each of the PMO 
and local PMOs. 
5. 
The  external  environmental  monitoring  reports  will  include,  but  not  be  limited  to,  (i) 
description  of  activities  conducted  in  the  reporting  period  and  results;  (ii)  all  cumulative  data 
collected  up  to  the  current  reporting  period;  (iii)  any  cases  of  noncompliance  with  the  target 
standards;  (iv) any  additional  observations  (qualitative  or quantitative);  (iv) lessons  learned;  and 
(f) work schedule  for the next semiannual  monitoring  period. 
6. 
The  consolidated  external  environmental  monitoring  report  will  summarize  the  results, 
conclusions,  lessons  learned,  and recommendations  for the overall  monitoring  program.  All raw 
data will be handed over to the PMO and local PMOs in a clear and simple format.  The EMA will 
submit to ADB (i) a draft final consolidated external monitoring report for review by ADB, the PMO, 
and local PMOs; and (ii) a final report incorporating comments made by ADB, the PMO, and local 
PMOs. 
The  EMA  will  take  full  responsibility  for  the  content  and  quality  of  the  reports  and,  if 
7. 
necessary,  must  revise  reports  based  on  comments  of  ADB.  Format  of  the  reports  will  be 
proposed  by the EMA in the technical  proposal.  The EMA may seek  guidance from  examples of 
reports on ADB’s website. 
D.

Introduction 
(ADB)  Safeguard  Policy  Statement 
1. 
This  document  sets  out  the  indicative  terms  of  reference  for  external  resettlement  and 
social  development  monitoring  and  evaluation  (M&E)  agency  needed  to  ensure  that  the  Hunan 
Xiangxi  Rural Environmental  Improvement  and Green Development  Project will be implemented 
in  conformity  with  the  People’s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  laws  and  regulations  and  the  Asian 
Development  Bank’s 
involuntary 
resettlement  and  indigenous  people.  The  direct  client  is  the  project  management  office  (PMO). 
The  PMO  is  under  the  Xiangxi  Tujia  and  Miao  Autonomous  Prefectural  Government  (XPG,  the 
executing  agency  of  the  project)  and  physically  located  in  the  Development  and  Reform 
Committee of the XPG. The external resettlement and social development  M&E will be conducted 
for the resettlement  plan (including  frameworks  for land  use rights transfer  [LURT]  and land use 
for  rural  public  infrastructure  [LURPI])  and  social  plans  (implementation  of  the  ethnic  minority 
development  plan  [EMDP],  social  development  action  plan  [SDAP],  and  gender  action  plan 
[GAP])  in Jishou  City  and  the  counties  of  Baojing,  Fenghuang,  Guzhang,  Huayuan,  Longshan, 
Luxi, and Yongshun. Each of the Jishou City Government and the county governments of Baojing, 
Fenghuang,  Guzhang,  Huayuan, Longshan,  Luxi, and Yongshun  (implementing  agencies)  has a

Implementation  Arrangements 
2. 
The  external  resettlement  and  social  development  M&E  will  be  carried  out by  a team  of 
specialists  through  a  competent  external  M&E  agency.  The  M&E  will  be  financed  by  ADB,  and 
the team of specialists will be recruited by the PMO according to ADB’s Procurement Policy (2017, 
as amended  from  time to  time) and  ADB’s  Procurement  Regulations  for ADB  Borrowers  (2017, 
as  amended  from  time  to  time)  through  consultants’  qualifications  selection.  The  PMO,  local 
PMOs,  and  relevant  agencies  of  the  XPG  and  the  implementing  agencies  will  assist  the  M&E 
agency,  particularly  in the aspects of field survey,  staffing, and logistics.  The consulting services 
are expected to start in February 2021 until January 2027. 
C. 
Reporting  Requirements 
3. 
The M&E agency will submit to ADB, the PMO, and the local PMOs external resettlement 
and social development  M&E reports semiannually.2  For each report, the M&E agency will submit 
a soft copy of the English version to ADB; and soft copies of the English and Chinese versions to 
each  of  the  PMO  and  the  local  PMOs,  not  later  than  30  days  after  the  completion  of  the  field 
investigations. 
4. 
 The M&E agency will take full responsibility  for the content and quality of the reports and, 
if necessary,  must  revise reports  based  on  the comments  of ADB.  Format  of the  reports  will be 
proposed  by  the  M&E  agency  in  the  technical  proposal.  The  M&E  agency  may  seek  guidance

Scope of Services  and Consultants’  Inputs 
5. 
According  to ADB’s requirements,  the implementation  of the resettlement  plan (including 
frameworks  for  LURT  and  LURPI),  EMDP,  SDAP,  and  GAP—besides  internal  monitoring 
undertaken  by  the PMO  and  local  PMOs—should  be monitored  by  the  M&E  agency.  The  M&E 
agency  will monitor  the implementation  of the resettlement  plan (including  frameworks  for LURT 
and LURPI), EMDP, SDAP, and GAP; and report progress  to ADB semiannually  (footnote 2). 
6. 
The  general  objective  of  the  external  resettlement  and  social  development  M&E  is  to 
assess the compliance  with principles,  policies,  and requirements  mentioned  in the resettlement 
plan  (including  frameworks  for  LURT  and  LURPI),  EMDP,  SDAP,  and  GAP,  including  (i) 
determining  and assessing  whether  or  not the relevant  project  activities  are  being carried  out in 
compliance  with  principles,  requirements,  and  procedures  according  to  the  resettlement  plan 
(including  frameworks  for LURT and  LURPI),  EMDP,  SDAP, and  GAP; (ii) reviewing  whether  or 
not  the  objectives  of  the  resettlement  plan  (especially  those  that  improve  or  at  least  restore 
affected  persons’  living  standards),  EMDP,  SDAP,  and  GAP  are  adequately  implemented  and 
achieved;  and  (iii)  reviewing  shortcomings  in  the  implementation  of  the  resettlement  plan  
(including  frameworks  for  LURT  and  LURPI),  EMDP,  SDAP,  and  GAP;  and  developing 
recommended  solutions  for discussion  with  the PMO,  local PMOs,  and relevant  agencies  of the

agency  will  semiannually  monitor  and  evaluate  the  implementation  of  the 
resettlement  plan (including frameworks  for LURT and LURPI). 
Annual  evaluation  of  the  land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  After  the 
completion  of the  LAR, the M&E  agency will  annually  carry out annual  M&E for  2 
years to evaluate the results of the implementation  of the resettlement  plan and its 
impact of the affected persons. 
Social  development  monitoring  and  evaluation.  For  each  subproject,  during 
project  implementation,  the  M&E  agency  will  semiannually  monitor  and  evaluate 
the implementation  of the EMDP, SDAP, and GAP.
