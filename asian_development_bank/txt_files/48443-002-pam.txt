Environmental Management Plan 
Project Administration Manual Purpose and Process 
  The  project  administration  manual  (PAM)  describes  the  essential  administrative  and  management 
requirements to implement the project on time, within budget, and in accordance with the policies and 
procedures  of  the  government  and  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  The  PAM  should  include 
references  to  all  available  templates  and  instructions  either  through  linkages  to  relevant  URLs  or 
directly incorporated in the PAM. 
The executing agency, Hunan Provincial Housing and Urban–Rural Development Department, and 
implementing agencies (Changning City Government, Dong'an County Government, Guiyang County 
Government,  Hengshan  County  Government,  Hengyang  County  Government,  Lanshan  County 
Government, Leiyang City Government, Lengshuijiang City Government, Yongzhou City Government, 
Zixing City Government) are wholly responsible for the implementation of the ADB-financed project, 
as agreed jointly between the borrower and ADB, and in accordance with the policies and procedures 
of  the  government  and  ADB.  ADB  staff  is  responsible  for  supporting  implementation  including 
compliance  by  executing  and  implementing  agencies  of  their  obligations  and  responsibilities  for 
project implementation in accordance with ADB's policies and procedures. 
  At loan negotiations, the borrower and ADB shall agree to the PAM and ensure consistency with the 
loan  agreement.  Such  agreement  shall  be  reflected  in  the  minutes  of the  loan  negotiations.  In  the 
event of any discrepancy or contradiction between the PAM and the loan agreement, the provisions 
of the loan agreement shall prevail. 
  After  ADB  Board  approval  of  the  project's  report  and  recommendation  of  the  President  (RRP), 
changes in implementation arrangements are subject to agreement and approval pursuant to relevant 
government  and  ADB  administrative  procedures  (including  the  Project  Administration  Instructions) 
and upon such approval, they will be subsequently incorporated in the PAM. 
I. 
PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
A. 
Rationale 
The Xiangjiang River and its watershed are part of the larger Dongting Lake watershed. 
1. 
Both watersheds are integral elements of the downstream Yangtze River watershed. The Yangtze 
River Economic Belt (YREB) covers nine provinces and two specially administered cities in the 
Yangtze  River  Basin.  It  accounts  for  over  40%  of  the  PRC’s  population  and  has  40%  of  the 
freshwater  resources.  It  also  serves  as  the  drinking  water  resource  for  400  million  people, 
provides 60% of the total fisheries production, has 20% of the total wetland area, and contributes 
about 45% of the PRC’s economic output.  The PRC’s YREB Development Plan, 2016–2030,1 
stipulates the prioritization of ecological protection and promotion of green development as the 
guiding principle for the YREB development. As upstream watersheds, the Xiangjiang River and 
Dongting Lake play a pivotal role in the water quality of the Yangtze River watershed and in the 
general maintenance of healthy rivers and waterways. Therefore, the Xiangjiang River watershed 
is a key water resource in the overall strategic planning for water security in the Yangtze River, 
and its ecological improvement in turn promotes ecosystem restoration, environmental protection, 
and water resources management of the YREB and its watersheds.  
2. 
The Xiangjiang River watershed has a total area of about 94,660 square kilometers, with 
approximately 90% of it located in Hunan and the remaining 10% located in the Guangxi Province. 
The  economic  activity  and  expansion  of  the  human-made  surroundings  have  extensively 
developed  the  Xiangjiang  River  watershed.  By  2017,  approximately  61%  of  Hunan’s  total 
population,  or  about  25.1  million  people,  lived  within  the  watershed.  The  total  gross  domestic 
product for the Xiangjiang River watershed in 2017 was estimated to be 75% of the overall total 
gross domestic product of Hunan Province.  The 
experienced 
countrywide  from  the  mid-1980s  until  the  present,  coupled  with  inadequate  environmental 
protection,  contributes  to  the  deterioration  of  the  environment  and  the  increased  pollution  in 
Hunan and the Xiangjiang River watershed. By 2000, the surface water of the Xiangjiang River, 
which met class III quality or better, was less than 70% along the entire river system.2 Based on 
the PRC drinking water code, water along most reaches of the Xiangjiang River did not meet the 
standards to be used as a source for raw water. The pollution in the Xiangjiang River had negative 
impacts on living standards and the health of residents living around the river. The pollution was 
recognized by the government as a threat to the long-term sustainable growth of industry along 
the river, an impediment to the maintenance of overall river health, a material risk to the strategic 
supplies for downstream drinking water, and an unacceptable visual intrusion on the watershed's 
well-recognized cultural attraction.

The  main  sectors  responsible  for  the  Xiangjiang  River  watershed’s  environmental 
degradation  are  industry,  agriculture,  and  domestic  (with  domestic  sources  being  primarily 
municipal  wastewater  and  MSW).  In  the  period  2000–2017,  the  government  adopted  an 
integrated approach to pollution control to protect water quality in the Xiangjiang River watershed. 
In  2011,  the  Hunan  Provincial  Government  (HPG)  initiated  a  major  program  of  environmental 
pollution control to target the major pollution sources.3 Subsequent environmental regulations and 
incremental  enforcement  in  Hunan  have  reduced  the  impacts  from  industrial  and  agricultural

sources, and new wastewater treatment plants have reduced pollution from untreated sewage. 
However,  significant  challenges  remain  regarding  MSW.  Urbanization  has  left  a  legacy  of 
substandard landfill sites that were once in outlying rural areas and are now located close to newly 
created urban areas. Much of the countryside has been urbanized and has become part of the 
built environment of the counties and county-level cities. With the expansion of MSW services 
being limited in these areas, the challenge of managing MSW in a sustainable manner has grown. 
Addressing the poor management of substandard landfill sites.4 Aging landfill sites, 
4. 
which are generally no longer receiving any MSW, are one of the last remaining long-term sources 
of  pollution  that  have  not  yet  been  fully  addressed  in  Hunan.  Most  of  these  landfill  sites  are 
referred  to  as  substandard  MSW  landfills,  or  dumpsites,  meaning  they  were  not  planned, 
engineered, constructed, or operated to appropriate standards. They have been left untreated or 
partially sealed at various locations. They are typically closed in an operational sense. However, 
they  have  not  been  closed  and  restored 
for 
decommissioning. 5  Because  they  were  not  closed  competently,  liquid  leachate  continues  to 
pollute surface water and groundwater and the waste is also releasing landfill gas.6 The liquid 
leachate and waste contribute to long-term pollution of the river system and downstream water 
quality by raising the biological and chemical oxygen demands, while gross pollution of the soil 
below the landfills remains unchecked. Without any form of managed closure, they will continue 
to generate leachate. The landfills pose risks to the health and well-being of people living near 
them  and  are  a  safety  risk  to  anyone  accessing  them.  HPG  has  identified  59  landfills  in  the 
watershed to be treated and improved by county and county-level city governments.7 While some 
landfills have been treated under domestically funded projects, there are still untreated sites that 
continue  to  generate  leachate  when  rainfall  and  runoff  infiltrates  the  solid  waste  body,  further 
generating leachate from the natural process of waste decomposition.   
in  accordance  with 
the  best  practice 
5. 
Improvement  of  inadequate  municipal  solid  waste  management  services  in  rural 
areas. Efficient MSW management, which promotes reduction (by waste minimization), reuse (of 
waste  materials),  recycling,  and  recovery,  is  gaining  ground  in  the  PRC.  However,  the 
management and disposal of MSW generated in rural areas is underdeveloped and inadequate. 
Most waste is randomly dumped onto open areas without treatment. In some cases, it is burned 
openly, generating polluting emissions. Randomly dumped MSW allows waste to break down and 
decompose  without  the  means  to  prevent  leachate  from  percolating  into  the  groundwater  or 
flowing into surface water bodies; indiscriminately dumped MSW can clog streams and drains. In 
the PRC, MSW management focuses on urban areas. For vast rural areas, the management of 
domestic waste is delegated to villagers. In 2016, HPG commenced the implementation of a five-
year plan for rural MSW treatment, which targeted the achievement of at least 70% of rural waste 
being  treated  by  2020.8 This  builds  on  rigorous  national  guidance  on  controlled  treatment  and 
disposal of MSW.9 It supports the 3-year Action Plan for Rural Settlement Environment Regulation 
4  Before the mid-1980s, disposal of MSW in Hunan was rarely managed in accordance with best practice, and formal 
services were rare. MSW was typically disposed of in so-called substandard landfill sites. The sites have become 
contaminated resulting from gradual decomposition of buried waste, with consequent degradation of soil and water. 
5  Closure and restoration is an MSW industry recognized term, which describes the process of closing a site from an 
engineering and environmental perspective, including a process of restoration using agreed design standards for 
future land use. It is not operational closure of a landfill site whereupon materials are no longer delivered to the site. 
6   As waste within a landfill decomposes, it generates leachate which is a highly polluting liquid contaminant.

in  Hunan  Province  issued  by  HPG  in  2018  which  requires  comprehensive  implementation  of 
enhanced services for rural sewage and waste treatment. In the rural areas of Hunan, there has 
been some progress despite remaining limited and inconsistent.  
6. 
Expansion of municipal solid waste to include collection and treatment of kitchen 
waste. HPG is also promoting the treatment of kitchen waste from commercial sources, which is 
typically disposed of in landfills or in small dumpsites without treatment. However, because of its 
high water and protein content, kitchen waste tends to generate more leachate and greenhouse 
gas  emissions  than  other  MSW.  There  is  concern  about  unregulated  kitchen  waste  handling 
regarding food safety and its impacts on human health.10 According to a proposal raised in the 
Hunan People’s Congress,11 eight kitchen waste management projects have been proposed to 
recover by-products for beneficial reuse, with due regard to public health and overall food safety.  
7. 
Strategic context. In the PRC's Thirteenth Five-Year Plan, the government’s strategy is 
to intensify the control of water pollution and the protection of key watersheds.12 This includes the 
ecological  restoration  of  resource-depleted  areas  and  the  promotion  of  treating  pollutants  in 
contaminated river basins. HPG is committed to meeting these obligations and to eliminating or 
minimizing  pollutants.  It  has  prioritized  reducing  long-term  pollution  and  promoting  the 
comprehensive  treatment  and  effective  management  of  MSW. 13  HPG  focuses  on  landfill 
management and MSW collection, transfer, and treatment in urban and rural areas. 
8. 
ADB support. The project demonstrates alignment with the operational priorities of ADB 
Strategy  2030  particularly  in  terms  of  environmental  sustainability  and  integrated  solutions  for 
livable  cities.  It  closely  supports  the  strategic  priorities  set  out  in  ADB’s  country  partnership 
strategy  for  the  PRC,  2016–2020;  ADB's  Water  Operational  Plan,  2011–2020,  particularly  in 
integrating  the  management  of  water  resources  including  pollution  control;  and  ADB’s  Urban 
Operational  Plan,  2012–2020,  particularly  in  improving  environmental  sustainability,  promoting 
green and inclusive growth, and enhancing urban–rural links.14 The project is ADB’s first MSW 
investment in Hunan and the only one in the PRC that focuses entirely on MSW management. 
The project will adopt lessons learned from over 20 years of ADB experience in national dialogue 
with the government on MSW policies and practices. This dialogue has contributed to an enabling 
environment  that  has  facilitated  policy,  regulatory,  and  operational  improvements.  Starting  in 
2000, ADB supported the government in strengthening urban MSW through technical assistance 
projects, which helped develop a national policy framework and plans for MSW and wastewater 
management, focusing on small cities and towns. ADB has also provided specific support for the 
treatment  of  substandard  landfills  in  the  PRC  and  for  the  environmental  management  of 
watersheds  in  Hunan.  The  project  supports  HPG’s  approach  to  urban–rural  integrated  MSW

10 There is an unregulated business that collects kitchen waste to recover oils for cooking (known as “gutter” oil) and 
proteins for animal feed. Both uses are strictly prohibited and have serious impacts on human and animal health, yet 
this traditional form of recycling and reuse continues unabated.

management,  which  seeks  to  address  the  entire  cycle  of  MSW  starting  in  households  with 
collecting, separating, and recycling; and continuing in counties and cities with transferring and 
treating  the  remaining  wastes.  It  covers  a  large  population  and  various  levels  of  government 
agencies. The engagement with multiple agencies is designed to drive ownership and build wide-
ranging capacity at the lowest administrative level and act as a model project. 
9. 
Value addition of ADB assistance. The PRC has adequate policies and regulations for 
MSW management to which ADB knowledge studies and technical assistance have contributed.15 
The implementation of these policies in rural areas, counties, and county-level cities has been a 
constant  challenge.  HPG  recognizes  this  and  has  requested  ADB’s  support  to  develop  an 
investment  project  in  rural  and  urban–rural  areas,  which  is  intended  to  show  how  policy  and 
regulations can be translated into projects that follow best practices. This is intended to keep from 
duplicating past practices of low-cost interventions that deliver substandard outcomes. This builds 
on  lessons  from  ADB’s  past  engagements,  showing  the  demand  for  clear  statements  on  best 
practice  and  for  robust  technical  guidance  and  support.  ADB’s  presence  offers  a  unique 
opportunity to deliver numerous projects under one overarching project, wholly focused on MSW, 
to  allow  collaboration  and  comparative  assessment.  ADB’s  focused  support  on  a  chronically 
underserved sector allows it to be comprehensively addressed. ADB’s engagement assists the 
government  in  the  last  stage  of  providing  MSW  services  and  in  addressing  overlooked  aging 
landfills. The government and ADB have designed the project collaboratively to have a sharper 
focus  on  consistent,  effective,  and  innovative  approaches  with  a  high  potential  for  replication, 
based  on  the  best  international  and  national  practices.  This  enhanced  design  development 
broadened the project’s scope while adopting more holistic and strategic approaches, leading to 
improved MSW service outcomes and the adoption of appropriate high-level technologies with 
large-scale demonstration potential, including (i) practical and environmentally sound approaches 
to landfill closure and restoration, building on recent codes of practice;16 (ii) robust operational 
practices  to  improve  the  treatment  of  leachate  from  landfills;  (iii) the  selective  adoption  and 
promotion  of  the    reduce,    reuse,    and  recycle    (3Rs)  principle; 17 (iv)  improved  operational 
management  with  approaches  incorporating  information  and  communication  technology;  and     
(v) a kitchen waste management system as a large-scale demonstration to appropriately manage 
this valuable resource.18 The project has been designed to fit with Hunan’s future development 
goals and service-level needs and, noting past lessons, it has been designed to build ownership 
and deliver practical outcomes. It is expected to act as a catalyst for further investment projects 
in Hunan, and the government is keen to promote cross-country learning.

A. 
Cost Estimates Preparation and Revisions 
IV. 
COST AND FINANCING 
The cost estimates were prepared jointly by the project management office (PMO) and 
20. 
ADB with assistance from the transaction technical assistance consultant. The source and basis 
for the cost estimates were reviewed during the project preparation and have been confirmed by 
related parties. The process was facilitated by a financial model in Microsoft Excel software which 
enabled easy updating or revision as necessary. The model is maintained by both the PMO and 
ADB.  Revision  of  the  cost  estimates  will  be  conducted  when  deemed  necessary  during 
implementation. The PMO will be responsible for proposing and drafting any revision which would 
be subject to ADB approval. 
B. 
Key Assumptions 
21. 
The following key assumptions underpin the cost estimates and financing plan: 
(i) 
Exchange rate: $1.00 = CNY6.28 (as of 31 January 2018);  
(ii) 
Price  contingencies  based  on  expected  cumulative 
implementation period are as follows:

a   Includes taxes and duties of $21.96 million to be financed from ADB and government resources. ADB loan will finance 
taxes  and  duties  of  $15.53  million;  such  amount  does  not  represent  an  excessive  share  of  the  project  cost.  The 
government will finance taxes and duties of $6.43 million through cash contribution. 
b  In early-2018 prices as of 11 January 2018.

c   Physical contingencies computed at 8% for civil works; and 6% for field research and development, training, surveys, 
and studies. Price contingencies computed at average of 1.6% on foreign exchange costs and 2.4% on local currency 
costs; includes provision for potential exchange rate fluctuation under the assumption of a purchasing power parity 
exchange rate. 
d   Includes interest and commitment charges. Interest during construction for the ordinary capital resources (OCR) loan 
has been computed at the 5-year US dollar fixed swap rate plus an effective contractual spread of 0.5% and maturity 
premium of 0.1%. Commitment charges for the OCR loan are 0.15% per year to be charged on the undisbursed loan 
amount. 
Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. 
The government has requested a regular loan of $150 million from ADB's ordinary capital 
23. 
resources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period 
of 5 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB's London interbank offered 
rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility;  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%  per  year;  and  such  other 
terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. Based on the straight-line 
repayment  method, the average maturity is 15.25 years, and the maturity premium payable to 
ADB is 0.10% per year. The PRC is the borrower of the loan and will make the loan available,

Financial Management Assessment 
V. 
FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT 
The  financial  management  assessment  (FMA)  was  carried  out  for  the  project  in 
25. 
accordance with ADB's Guidelines for the Financial Management and Analysis of Projects and 
Financial Due Diligence: a Methodology Note.25 HURD (the executing agency) has set up a PMO 
to manage and monitor the overall project implementation process; communicate and coordinate 
with  ADB,  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  and  the  National  Development  and  Reform  Commission; 
approve  and  submit  tendering  documents  and  fund  withdrawal  applications  to  ADB;  submit 
consolidated project audited financial statements; and supervise the monitoring and evaluation of 
environment, resettlement, and social issues during project implementation. The director of the 
urban construction division in HURD is assigned as the PMO manager and has three full-time 
staff  managing  project  implementation,  including  finance,  procurement,  resettlement,  and 
environment. The FMA was conducted for the financial management capacity of HURD and the 
10  project  counties/county-level  cities  (the  implementing  agencies).  The  assessment  covered 
funds  flow  arrangements,  staffing,  accounting  and  financial  reporting  systems,  financial 
information systems, and internal and external auditing arrangements. 
26. 
The Hunan Provincial Finance Department (HFD), particularly its Foreign Fund Utilization 
Division, as the project advance account holder, has sufficient financial management experience 
for donor-funded projects, including ADB, World Bank, and Japan bank loans. HFD has managed 
several  foreign  loan  projects  involving  urban  development,  agriculture,  environment,  and 
transportation sectors.      
27. 
The  financial  management  capacity  of  HURD  was  assessed  as  adequate.  The 
assessment  concluded  that  the  skills  in  the  general  financial  management  practices  such  as 
bookkeeping, statutory reporting, project budgeting and costing, corporate treasury and budgeting 
were sufficiently developed. This is due to the good conventional accounting environment and 
standardized practices within PRC Government's financial departments. HURD's experience in 
the computerized accounting systems and payment processing, project budgeting and costing, 
and  internal  auditing  is  satisfactory.  The  financial  management  capacity  of  the  implementing 
agencies was assessed as adequate since they are similarly operating under PRC Government 
standard financial management and accounting systems. While the executing and implementing 
agencies  have  adequate  financial  management  capacity,  they  are  new  to  ADB  project 
implementation procedures and requirements. The overall financial management risk is rated as 
moderate.  The  assessment  concluded  that  (i)  there  are  established  accounting  and  financial 
management policies and procedures in the PRC, which are strictly followed by the implementing 
agencies;  and  (ii)  they  have  sound  accounting  and  financial  management  capability  and  are 
experienced  in  managing  urban  development  and  construction  projects.  However,  they  lack 
experience in implementing foreign-funded projects, and the managers and financial personnel 
have  little  knowledge  of  ADB  policies  and  procedures,  especially  the  annual  project  reporting 
requiring a different accounting method. The lack of ADB project implementation experience may 
delay project implementation due to ineffective management in terms of reporting, disbursement, 
safeguards  monitoring,  and  other  required  project  management  tasks.  The  identified  risks  in 
financial management will be closely monitored during project implementation. It was agreed that 
the executing and implementing agencies will further strengthen their capabilities by (i) setting up 
clear institutional arrangements and coordination mechanisms; (ii) completing staff deployment in

appropriate  financial  management  positions  with  English  language  support;  (iii)  developing 
methodologies for managing foreign exchange and interest rate risks; and (iv) undertaking more 
training,  particularly  on  ADB  policy  and  procedures.  Table  7  demonstrates  the  financial  risk 
mitigation  plan  to  be  adopted  by  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies  during  project 
implementation.

Mitigation Measures and Risk Management Plan 
IAs will be responsible for the implementation, O&M of 
the Project and will build on their experience in 
successfully managing and implementing domestically 
funded construction projects. The project will monitor 
compliance with financial management policies and 
procedures. 
IAs lack experience for foreign funded projects.  
Provide additional training to project implementation units 
in handling ADB disbursements and utilization of project 
funds. 
HFD provided assurance on adequate and timely 
provision of counterpart funds. Price contingency and 
physical contingency are included in the cost estimates to 
accommodate cost escalation. 
Capacity building and institutional strengthening for 
components with substantial O&M costs shall be 
provided and HFD will provide assurance on O&M budget 
provision. 
5. Counterpart funding. The provision 
for counterpart funding is delayed. 
Moderate 
The corresponding counties and cities have issued 
commitment letters for counterpart funding provision 
6. Staffing. Accounting staff do not 
have adequate understanding of ADB 
requirements. 
Low in EA

The EA has implemented several foreign-funded projects. 
However, both the EA and IAs will need to recruit 
additional financial staff for the project as the current 
financial departments are understaffed. The IAs have 
limited capacity in project accounting and financial 
reporting. The finance staff have basic knowledge and 
training for domestic accounting systems but training in

Mitigation Measures and Risk Management Plan 
ADB financial management and disbursement 
procedures will be provided. 
Although, in general terms, foreign exchange hedging is 
not widely practiced in the PRC, the foreign currency risk 
is moderate to ADB since local governments have issued 
commitment letters for repayment. Corresponding risk for 
the IAs would be moderate too since the CNY exchange 
rate is expected to be stable over the midterm. Interest 
rate risk is expected to be moderate since international 
capital market has had no volatility since 2008. In 
addition, ADB offers interest conversions at low 
transaction costs. 
9 IAs will use accrual basis for the Project with separately 
maintained books instead of cash basis as currently 
used. Training will be provided by the FM Specialist to 
comply with this requirement 
Lack of accounting staff for review procedure because 
given the size of the IAs and EA, having own internal 
independent audit divisions is difficult to justify from an 
efficiency point of view. 
The IAs are audited by local government audit bureaus 
on an irregular basis in accordance with the Chinese 
accounting and auditing system. The project, as an 
integrated part of the IAs, will be within the scope of 
future audits. Although external audit is not annual, the 
IAs’ fund flows are subject to strict procedures governed 
by HPG since their income is fiscal appropriation.  
No previous problems were identified for the participating 
IAs, but bookkeeping and reporting may be a challenge 
to the IAs as they lack experience with international 
financing institutions. 
12. Information systems 
High 
The IAs are using computerized accounting systems, but 
at rudimentary levels on a cash basis.

B. 
Disbursement 
28. 
The  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Loan  Disbursement 
Handbook  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time), 26 and  detailed  arrangements  agreed  upon 
between the government and ADB. Online training for project staff on disbursement policies and 
procedures  is  available.27 Project  staff  are  encouraged  to  avail  of  this  training  to  help  ensure 
efficient disbursement and fiduciary control.  
29. 
The project will use the combination of direct payment, reimbursement, and advance fund 
procedures for disbursements of the loan. Responsibilities by the PMO on disbursement activities 
are  summarized  as  follows:  (i)  preparation  of  disbursement  projections  based  on  the 
26 The handbook is available electronically from the ADB website: http://www.adb.org/documents/ loan-disbursement-
handbook 
27 Disbursement eLearning. http://wpqr4.adb.org/disbursement_elearning  
32 
implementing agencies' respective projections; (ii) request budgetary allocations for counterpart 
funds;  (iii)  remind  implementing  agencies  to  submit  supporting  documents  for  review  and 
endorsement;  and  (iv)  consolidate, prepare,  and  send  withdrawal  applications  through  HFD  to 
ADB. 
30. 
HFD is responsible for making direct payments to contractors and suppliers, and transfer 
funds  to  the  implementing  agencies  from  the  advance  account.  HFD  is  also  responsible  for 
sending loan withdrawal applications to ADB to initiate either advance account replenishment or 
where appropriate, to request direct payments by ADB to consultants or suppliers.  
31. 
Advance  fund  procedure.  To  facilitate  project  implementation  and  funds  flow  to  ADB 
upon loan effectiveness, an advance account will be established and maintained by HFD. The 
currency of the advance account is the US dollar.28 The advance account is to be used exclusively 
for  ADB's  share  of  eligible  expenditures.  HFD,  who  administers  the  advance  account  is 
accountable and responsible for proper use of advances from the advance account.  
The total outstanding advance to the advance account should not exceed the estimate of 
32. 
ADB's share of expenditures to be paid through the advance account for the forthcoming 6 months. 
HFD may request for initial and additional advances to the advance account based on an Estimate 
of Expenditure Sheet29 setting out the estimated expenditures to be financed through the account 
for the forthcoming 6 months. Supporting documents should be submitted to ADB or retained by 
HFD,  executing  agency,  and  implementing  agencies  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Loan 
Disbursement Handbook when liquidating or replenishing the advance account. 
Statement of expenditure procedure.30 The statement of expenditure (SOE) procedure 
33. 
may be used for reimbursement of eligible expenditures or liquidation of advances to the advance 
account. The ceiling of the SOE procedure is the equivalent of $200,000 per individual payment. 
Supporting  documents  and  records  for  the  expenditures  claimed  under  the  SOE  should  be 
maintained and made readily available for review by ADB's disbursement and review missions, 
upon  ADB's  request  for  submission  of  supporting  documents  on  a  sampling  basis,  and  for 
independent audit. Reimbursement and liquidation of individual payments in excess of the SOE 
ceiling should be supported by full documentation when submitting the withdrawal application to 
ADB. 
34. 
Reimbursement. The reimbursement procedure is a disbursement procedure where ADB 
pays from the loan account to the borrower's account for the eligible expenditure which have been 
incurred and paid for by the borrower out of its budget allocation or its own resources. Use of the 
procedure is encouraged for all eligible expenditures when the borrower has sufficient resources. 
Under this procedure, ADB's payment are made only to the borrower. 
Before the submission of the first withdrawal application, the borrower should submit to 
35. 
ADB sufficient evidence of the authority of the person(s) who will sign the withdrawal applications 
on  behalf  of  the  government,  together  with  the  authenticated  specimen  signatures  of  each 
authorized  person.  The  minimum  value  per  withdrawal  application  is  stipulated  in  the  Loan 
Disbursement Handbook. Individual payments below such amount should be paid (i) by HFD and 
28 The bank charges on the imprest account will be financed from the proceeds of the loan. 
29 The Estimate of Expenditure sheet is available in Appendix 8A of ADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as 
amended from time to time).  
30 SOE forms are available in Appendix 7B and 7D of ADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from 
time to time). 
33 
subsequently claimed to ADB through reimbursement, or (ii) through the advance fund procedure, 
unless otherwise accepted by ADB. The borrower should ensure sufficient category and contract 
balances  before  requesting  disbursements.    Use  of  ADB’s  Client  Portal  for  Disbursements 
(CPD)31 system is encouraged for submission of withdrawal applications to ADB. 
36. 
For the counterpart funds, the PMO shall cause the implementing agencies to allocate the 
designated funding for the project as indicated in the loan and project agreements. Counterpart 
funds  from  the  government  will  be  disbursed  and  liquidated  by  the  implementing  agencies  to 
contractors, suppliers, and service providers. The disbursement procedures will follow the project 
implementing agreement mutually signed between each implementing agencies and HFD as well 
as the local financial management practices by each counties and cities.  
C. 
Accounting 
37. 
The  executing  agency  and  each  implementing  agency  will  maintain,  or  cause  to  be 
maintained, separate books and records by funding source for all expenditures incurred on the 
project following Accounting Methods for Projects Financed by the World Bank (reference No. 
2000  [13]). 32 Each  implementing  agency  will  prepare  its  own  project  accounts  covering  their 
respective  components  of  the  project  and  submit  them  to  the  PMO  after  verification  by  their 
respective local finance bureau. The PMO will check the project accounts and consolidate the 
accounts  of  all  the  implementing  agencies,  and  incorporate  the  PMO  expenses  related  to  the 
project  operations.  The  executing  agency,  through  PMO,  will  prepare  the  consolidated  project 
financial statements in accordance with the government's accounting laws and regulations which 
are consistent with international accounting principles and practices.  
D. 
Auditing and Public Disclosure 
38. 
The executing agency will cause the detailed consolidated project financial statements to 
be audited in accordance with the PRC national auditing standards by an independent auditor 
acceptable  to  ADB.  The  audited  consolidated  project  financial  statements  together  with  the 
auditor's opinion will be presented in the English language to ADB within 6 months from the end 
of the fiscal year by the executing agency.  
39. 
The audit report for the project financial statements will include a management letter and 
auditor's opinions, which cover (i) whether the project financial statements present an accurate 
and fair view or are presented fairly, in all material respects, in accordance with the applicable 
financial  reporting  standards;  (ii)  whether  the  proceeds  of  the  loan  were  used  only  for  the 
purpose(s) of the project; and (iii) whether the borrower or executing agency was in compliance 
with the financial covenants contained in the legal agreements (where applicable). 
Compliance with financial reporting and auditing requirements will be monitored by review 
40. 
missions and during normal program supervision, and followed up regularly with all concerned, 
including the external auditor.  
41. 
The HFD, executing agency, and implementing agencies have been made aware of ADB's

34 
approach to delayed submission, and the requirements for satisfactory and acceptable quality of 
the  audited  project  financial  statements. 33 ADB  reserves  the  right  to  require  a  change  in  the 
auditor (in a manner consistent with the constitution of the borrower), or for additional support to 
be provided to the auditor, if the audits required are not conducted in a manner satisfactory to 
ADB,  or  if  the  audits  are  substantially  delayed.  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  verify  the  project's 
financial accounts to confirm that the share of ADB's financing is used in accordance with ADB's 
policies and procedures.  
Public disclosure of the audited consolidated  project financial statements, including the 
42. 
auditor's opinion, will be guided by ADB's Public Communications Policy 2011.34 After the review, 
ADB  will  disclose  the  audited  consolidated  project  financial  statements  and  the  opinion  of  the 
auditors  no  later  than  14  days  of  ADB's  confirmation  of  their  acceptability  by  posting  them  on 
ADB's website. The management letter, additional auditor's opinions, and audited entity financial 
statements will not be disclosed.35 
VI. 
PROCUREMENT AND CONSULTING SERVICES 
A. 
Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing 
43. 
To  expedite  project  implementation,  the  government  requested  ADB  to  approve 
(i) advance contracting, which includes the recruitment of consultants, procurement of civil works, 
and equipment purchase; and (ii) retroactive financing of eligible expenditures. 
44. 
All  advance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  will  be  undertaken  in  conformity  with 
ADB's Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time) and Guidelines on the Use 
of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). The issuance of invitations to bid under 
advance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  will  be  subject  to  ADB's  prior  approval.  The 
borrower,  executing  agency,  and  implementing  agencies  have  been  advised  that  approval  of 
advance contracting and retroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance the project.   
45. 
Advance contracting. Advance contracting will include (i) tendering and bid evaluation 
for  civil  works  packages;  (ii)  recommendation  for  contract  award;  and  (iii)  recruitment  of 
consultants.  The  advance  contracting  includes  civil  works  packages  and  consulting  service 
contracts. The issuance of invitations to bid and bidding documents under advance procurement 
action will be subject to ADB's prior approval. 
33 ADB's approach and procedures regarding delayed submission of audited project financial statements are as follows: 
(i)  When  audited  project  financial  statements  are  not  received  by  the  due  date,  ADB  will  write  to  the  executing 
agency  advising  that  (a)  the  audit  documents  are  overdue;  and  (b)  if  they  are  not  received  within  the  next 
6 months, requests for new contract awards and disbursement such as new replenishment of advance accounts, 
processing of new reimbursement, and issuance of new commitment letters will not be processed. 
(ii)  When audited project financial statements are not received within 6 months after the due date, ADB will withhold 
processing  of  requests  for  new  contract  awards  and  disbursement  such  as  new  replenishment  of  advance 
accounts, processing of new reimbursement, and issuance of new commitment letters. ADB will (a) inform the 
executing agency of ADB's actions; and (b) advise that the loan may be suspended if the audit documents are 
not received within the next 6 months. 
(iii)  When  audited  project  financial  statements  are  not  received  within  12  months  after  the  due  date,  ADB  may 
suspend the loan.

Retroactive financing. The government was informed that as a general rule, retroactive 
46. 
financing is permitted only if (i) it is specifically agreed by ADB and the borrower; (ii) the goods, 
works, services, and consultants for which it is requested are procured in accordance with ADB's 
Procurement  Guidelines  (2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of 
Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time); (iii) the amount to be retroactively financed 
does  not  exceed  20%  of  the  loan  amount;  and (iv)  the  expenditures  must  have  been  incurred 
before effectiveness of the relevant loan but, generally, no earlier than 12 months before signing 
of  the  loan  agreement.  In  either  instance,  detailed  assessments  (due  diligence)  on  each 
retroactive financing proposal must demonstrate that (i) the expenditures incurred are genuine, 
reasonable, and material to getting the project off the ground; and (ii) they were incurred for proper 
reasons, in a transparent manner over a reasonable period of time. 
B. 
Procurement of Goods, Works, and Consulting Services36 
47. 
All procurement of goods and works, including consulting services, will be undertaken in

Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  All  civil  works 
contracts will be procured using national competitive bidding (NCB). For goods contracts, 9 will 
be procured using international competitive bidding (ICB), 10 will use NCB, and 1 will procured

implementing agency (translated in English) should be submitted to ADB for approval regardless 
of the amount. Subsequent bidding documents will be for post review. 
48. 
To  facilitate  project  management  and  implementation,  provide  capacity  building  and 
institutional strengthening, and undertake external monitoring; an estimated 256 person-months

of China promulgated on August 30, 1999 with the clarifications and modifications described in 
the following paragraphs required for compliance with the provisions of the ADB Procurement

43 
Procurement Procedures  
Competitive Bidding Procedure (Procurement Law Article 26 and Law on Bidding 
Article 10) 
Public tendering is the acceptable method of government procurement, and public invitation is 
the accepted bid invitation mode. 
Eligibility  
The  eligibility  of  bidders  shall  be  as  defined  under  section  I  of  the  Procurement  Guidelines; 
accordingly,  no  bidder  or  potential  bidder  should  be  declared  ineligible  for  reasons  other  than 
those provided in section I of the Guidelines, as amended from time to time. 
Advertising 
All  invitations  to  prequalify  or  to  bid  shall  be  advertised  in  the  national  press  (China  Daily 
Newspaper)  or  a  free  and  open  access  website  (www.chinabidding.com).  Such  advertisement 
shall  be  made  in  sufficient  time  for  prospective  bidders  to  obtain  prequalification  or  bidding 
documents and prepare and submit their responses. In any event, a minimum preparation period 
of twenty-eight (28) days shall be given. The preparation period shall count (a) from the date of 
advertisement, or (b) when the documents are available for issue, whichever date is later. The 
advertisement and the prequalification and bidding documents shall specify the deadline for such 
submission. 
Bidding Period 
The minimum bidding period is 28 days prior to the deadline for the submission of bids. 
Participation by Government-Owned Enterprises 
Government  owned  enterprises  in  the  Borrower's  country  may  be  permitted  to  bid  if  they  can 
establish that they (a) are legally and financially autonomous, (b) operate under commercial law 
and (c) are not a dependent agency of the Borrower/Project Executing Agency. 
Rebidding 
Re-bidding shall not be allowed solely because the number of bids is less than three (3). 
Bidding Documents  
Qualification Requirements 
Qualification requirements of bidders and the method of evaluating the qualification of each bidder 
shall be specified in detail in the bidding documents, and in the prequalification documents if the 
bidding is preceded by a prequalification process.  
Bid Submission and Opening 
Bidders shall be allowed to submit bids by mail or by hand. 
44 
All bids shall be opened in public; all bidders shall be afforded an opportunity to be present (either 
in person or through their representatives) at the time of bid opening, but bidders shall not be 
required to be present at the bid opening. 
Bid Evaluation and Award

Environment  assessment.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  A  for  environment 
following  ADB's  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (SPS  2009).  The  project  environmental  impact 
assessment  (EIA)  and  environmental  management  plan  (EMP)  identify  the  environmental 
mitigation and monitoring measures needed during project implementation to address identified 
environmental risks and impacts. For existing facilities proposed for upgrade under the project, 
an environmental compliance audit including on-site assessment report identify whether actions 
53 
were  in  accordance  with  ADB's  safeguards  principles  and  requirements,  and  appropriate 
mitigation measures to address any outstanding compliance issues are incorporated in the EMP. 
These  documents  comply  with  the  PRC's  regulatory  requirements  and  SPS  2009  and  will  be 
disclosed on the ADB website at least for 120 days prior to ADB's Board consideration.

county/county-level city and no significant issue has been identified. Public consultations informed 
the  project  design  and  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  process,  and  will  continue 
throughout project implementation. Any environmental grievances will be handled in accordance 
with  the  grievance  redress  mechanism  (GRM)  established  for  the  project.  The  EMP  outlines 
potential  impacts,  mitigation  and  monitoring  measures,  institutional  arrangements,  training 
requirements, and implementation budget. 
69. 
The  EIA  identified  potential  direct,  indirect,  cumulative,  and  induced  environmental 
impacts  and  risks  and  proposed  mitigation  measures  for  pre-construction,  construction,  and 
operation  phases  of  the  project.    These  include  air,  soil,  and  groundwater  and  surface  water 
pollution caused by excavation, collection and treatment of leachate, collection and transportation 
of solid wastes, and closure of landfill sites. The EIA includes information on issues associated 
with specific contaminants such as polychlorobiphenyls, asbestos, persistent organic pollutants, 
and other hazardous substances expected from the substandard sites. Large-scale collection and 
transportation  of  solid  waste  is  required  with  temporary  impacts  on  air  and  dust,  noise,  odor, 
disruption to traffic, and community safety. Avoidance of impact through design, site management, 
and mitigation measures through construction management is identified for each impact in the 
project EMP which will be implemented by the contractors and monitored and reported by the 
PMO. The proposed closure works will include site regrading, stormwater interception ditches, 
surface  water  drainage  system,  earth  cover  incorporating  a  linear  low-density  polyethylene 
geomembrane,  site  restoration,  landscaping,  and  installation  of  groundwater  monitoring  wells 
downstream  of  the  site.  The  landfill  gas  will  be  collected  using  landfill  gas  wells  sunk  into  the 
waste body, with the gas being treated with biocovers before discharging into the atmosphere. In 
all  cases,  where  the  EMP  requirements  are  strictly  followed,  it  is  expected  that  construction 
impacts  will  be  kept  at  acceptable  levels.  None  of  the  project  sites  is  located  or  adjacent  to 
environmentally  sensitive  areas.  Biodiversity  impacts  are  expected  to  be  minimal  and  suitable 
mitigation measures will be adopted during detailed design and implementation.  
70. 
The  project  is  classified  as  medium  climate  risk  and  the  climate  risk  and  vulnerability 
assessment  conducted  found  that  intense  precipitation  and  flood  as  the  most  important  risk 
affecting project design, construction, maintenance, and performance. Intense precipitation may 
cause  considerable  damage  to  construction  sites  with  landfill  liner  structure  fractures  and 
waste/leachate  overflow.  Intense  precipitation  and  flood  can  damage  operational  or  closed 
landfills and other facilities within the project boundary. It can also disturb regular operation and 
maintenance  in  case  the  project  sites  have  access  difficulties.  The  project  will  implement 
adaptation measures in response to climate vulnerability of the watershed to reduce the risk of 
pollutant diffusion in extreme climate events, mainly floods.  
71. 
The EIA will be updated during detailed design stage to include (i) additional baseline data 
collected  by  investigation  of  leachate  movement  and  groundwater  table,  (ii)  additional  data 
gathered by sampling in different seasons and locations at suitable distance with the project site, 
(iii)  any  potential  chemical/hazard  which  may  pose  public  health  concern  including  sludge 
management and disposal at leachate treatment facilities; (iv) occupational health and safety risks 
identified during construction, and (v) assessment of land use plan for each of the MSW landfill 
sites to be closed.  The updated EIA will also include detailed guidance on the land use planning 
54 
and development in accordance with the local city/county rules and regulations. This will cover 
any requirements related to the restriction on public access and movement, types of activities for 
which the area can be used, etc. The subsidence rate of the landfills post-closure will be monitored 
annually based on geo-technical assessments, and suitability and sustainability of each site's safe 
and beneficial use will be evaluated by a technically competent team prior to clearance for any 
future use or public access.     
72. 
In  the  design  stage,  the  PMO  will  coordinate  between  the  design  institute  and  the  EIA 
institute to incorporate the EMP mitigation measures into the detailed engineering designs with 
allocated  environmental  mitigation  budgets.  Any  changes  to  the  designs  will  be  reviewed  and 
approved  by  the  government  and  ADB,  and  the  EMP  will  be  updated  as  needed.  The  EMP 
includes a comprehensive monitoring plan which covers both internal monitoring (by contractors 
during  construction  and  operation)  and  external  monitoring.  The  results  of  monitoring  will  be 
included in the project progress reports. A loan implementation environmental consultant (LIEC) 
will  be  engaged  using  the  ADB  loan.  The  EMP  will  be  a  part  of  the  bidding  documents  when 
procuring all civil work packages. To ensure that bidders respond to the EMP provisions, the PMO 
and the implementing agencies will prepare and provide the following specification clauses for 
incorporation  into  the  bidding  documents:  (i)  budget  for  EMP  implementation  in  the  bidders' 
proposals; (ii) environmental clauses for contractual terms and conditions; and (iii) updated project 
EIA and EMP, and the domestic environmental impact assessment reports.  In the design stage, 
the PMO will coordinate between the design institute and the EIA institute to incorporate the EMP 
mitigation measures into the detailed engineering designs with allocated environmental mitigation 
budgets.   
HURD and the implementing agencies will be responsible for ensuring that the project will 
73. 
be designed, constructed, and operated in accordance with (i) the domestic environmental, health, 
and safety laws, regulations, procedures, and guidelines; (ii) ADB's SPS, and (iii) the project EIA 
and EMP.  HURD holds the final responsibility for the implementation and compliance with the 
EMP  and  submission  of  semiannual  environmental  monitoring  reports  to  ADB  for  review  and 
disclosure on the ADB website. 
74. 
Project county and county-level city governments will supervise and provide guidance to 
the contractors to ensure that the EMP is effectively implemented. They will consolidate monthly 
environmental  monitoring  reports;  ensure  timely  disclosure  of  the  project  EIA  and/or  EMPs  in 
locations  and  forms  accessible  to  the  public;  and  take  corrective  actions  when  necessary  to 
ensure no environmental impacts. Their capacity to implement the EMP, as well as the capacity 
of the operation and maintenance unit to manage project facilities, will be strengthened through 
capacity building and training activities defined under project output 6. The responsible parties for 
environmental management and supervision are outlined in Table 13.

B. 
Involuntary Resettlement 
78. 
The  project  is  category  B  for  involuntary  resettlement.  The  project  will  require  the 
acquisition of about 23.5 hectares of land for the 127 waste transfer stations. Of these, only three 
households will be marginally affected due to partial loss of their garden land and forest land. The 
rest of the waste transfer stations will be located on wasteland or unallocated arable and forest 
land owned by village collectives. There will be no impact on houses or structures except one 
abandoned village office. Six resettlement plans have been prepared in accordance with the PRC 
laws  and  regulations  and  ADB's  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (SPS).  For  the  existing  waste 
transfer stations, landfill sites, and kitchen waste sites which are either owned by HURD or leased 
from  the  village,  due  diligence  have  been  carried  out  and  no  legacy  or  outstanding issue  was 
found. 
57 
The  government  will  ensure  that  (i) the  resettlement  plans  agreed  between  the 
79. 
government  and  ADB  are  updated  based  on  final  technical  design  and  submitted  to  ADB  for 
review and concurrence prior to land acquisition activities, and implemented in accordance with 
applicable  government  laws  and  regulations  and  ADB's  SPS;  in  case  of  any  inconsistency 
between  government  laws  and  ADB's  policy,  the  latter  will  prevail;  (ii) all  affected  persons  are 
given adequate opportunity to participate in resettlement planning, updating, and implementation; 
(iii) counterpart funds for land acquisition and resettlement activities are provided according to the 
budget and project schedule; (iv)  any additional costs in excess of the resettlement plan budget 
estimates are met within the project schedule; (v) the PMO and all implementing agencies will 
designate adequate staff and resources to supervise and monitor updating and implementation 
of the resettlement plans and submit semiannual internal monitoring reports to ADB; and (vi) a 
functional and effective grievance mechanism is established. 
80. 
The implementing agencies will not handover a specific section of a contract to the civil 
works contractor until (i) payment of compensation has been fully disbursed to the affected people 
and rehabilitation measures are in place for that specific section as per the resettlement plan; 
(ii) affected people who were compensated for that specific section have vacated the site; and 
(iii) the specific section is free from any encumbrances. 
C. 
Ethnic Minorities 
81. 
The  project  is  category  B  for  indigenous  people  following  ADB's  SPS.  In  the  four 
prefectural cities, there are 0.64 million ethnic minorities, including the ethnic minority of Tujia, 
Miao,  Dong,  Yao,  Bai,  and  Hui,  accounting  for 9.91%  of  the  total ethnic  minority  population in 
Hunan Province. However, the Yao minority group is the biggest accounting for 83.43% minority's 
population in Hunan Province. An EMDP has been prepared to facilitate the inclusion of ethnic 
minority people in all project activities.  
The government will ensure that (i) the EMDP agreed between the government and ADB 
82. 
is implemented in accordance with applicable government laws and regulations and ADB's SPS; 
(ii) all  ethnic  minorities  are  given  adequate  opportunity  to  participate  in  the  planning  and 
implementation process; (iii) counterpart funds for EMDP activities are provided; (iv) the PMO and 
all implementing agencies will designate at least one person to supervise and monitor, and submit 
semiannual  internal  monitoring  reports  to  ADB;  (v)  a  functional  and  effective  grievance 
mechanism  is  established;  and  (vi)  ethnic  and  religious  affairs  bureau  in  each  project 
county/county-level city will provide support as necessary, as well as the community offices, the 
project county/county-level city centers for disease control, and the labor bureaus. 
83. 
Prior to the commencement of any component, the PMO and the implementing agencies 
will ensure that briefings on ADB's safeguards policies with respect to ethnic minorities, and on 
the EMDP, are provided both for their own members and the implementing agencies. The ethnic 
and religious affairs bureaus will assist in these briefings. The government will also ensure that 
contractors, their supervisors, and workers will be required to undergo briefings on local ethnic 
minority customs and beliefs to ensure that the beliefs, traditions, and culture of ethnic minorities 
are respected.  
D. 
Grievance Redress Mechanism 
84. 
A  project  safeguards  GRM,  as  detailed  in  the  resettlement  plans,  EMDP,  and  EMP  is 
established  within  60  days  of  the  loan  effectiveness  date  or  before  implementation  of  land 
acquisition and resettlement or other advance construction activities, whichever is the earliest. 
58 
The GRM sets out procedures for managing public concerns and safeguard issues which may 
arise during project implementation. The GRM comprises a set of clear procedures to receive, 
record, and address any concerns or complaints raised; and specific contact details of individuals 
from the executing and implementing agencies, contractors' teams, and other relevant authorities 
and stakeholders. All contractors and work staff will be briefed on the project safeguards GRMs. 
Multiple  entry  points  to  the  GRM  will  be  available  such  as  face-to-face  meetings,  written 
complaints,  hotline  number  and  telephone  conversations,  anonymous  drop-boxes  for  written 
comments,  and/or  e-mail.  During  implementation  and  prior  to  the  project  completion  review, 
complaints and their resolution will be reported to ADB in quarterly project progress reports and/or 
semiannual safeguard monitoring reports.  
85. 
Prohibited investment activities. Pursuant to ADB's SPS (2009), ADB funds may not be 
applied  to  the  activities  described on  the  ADB  Prohibited  Investment  Activities  List  set  forth at 
Appendix 5 of the SPS. 
VIII.  GENDER AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS 
86. 
A poverty and social assessment (PSA) was undertaken during the project preparation 
phase in accordance with ADB guidelines on gender and social dimensions. The PSA included a 
review  of  secondary  data,  a  household  survey,  focus  group  discussions,  and  key  informant 
interviews.  The  PSA  assisted  in  the  design  of  the  various  subcomponents  to  ensure  they  are 
socially inclusive and implemented with a high degree of community participation, especially for 
the  local  people  including  women,  ethnic  minorities,  poor  and  other  vulnerable  persons  in  the 
project areas. 
87. 
The government will ensure that the PMO and implementing agencies will implement the 
SGAP.37 The following measures are included in the SGAP: (i)  participation and consultation of 
women  during  project  design  and  implementation  (at  least  50%  women  participants  in  public 
consultations and public hearings); (ii) gender sensitive training for all staff from the executing 
and implementing agencies; (iii) providing women with employment opportunities associated with 
project  construction  activities  (at  least  40%  hired  are  women);  (iv)  training  on  environmental 
protection,  MSW  management  and  3Rs  principle  (at  least  40%  women  participants);  and 
(v) training  on  leadership  or  management  during  project  construction  and  operation,  including 
awareness building (at least 50% women participants). 
In addressing the risk of spread of HIV/AIDS/STI, the government will ensure that there 
88. 
will be (i) inclusion of clauses on HIV/AIDS/STI and other communicable disease awareness for 
the  contractors/subcontractors  and  employees  into  contract  bidding  documents;  (ii)  conduct  of 
public  health  and  HIV/STI  prevention  education  to  the  civil  works'  contractors  and  labor  force; 
(iii) establishment  of  health  measures  for  construction  workers  (e.g.,  setting  up  a  temporary 
infirmary  and  using  local  medical  resources);  (iv)  conduct  of  diverse  publicity  activities  on 
HIV/AIDS (e.g., brochures, posters, and leaflets); and (v) construction workers hired from the local 
communities will be trained on sanitation knowledge campaigns, health and occupational safety 
measures while working at the construction sites. Sexual harassment awareness and prevention 
program will also be included in the contract bidding documents. 
89. 
Labor issues. The government will ensure that core labor standards will be complied with 
based on national laws. Civil works contracts will stipulate priorities to (i) employ local people for 
37 SGAP  is  accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in  Appendix  2  of  the  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the 
President for this project.

Monitoring 
1. 
Project Performance Monitoring 
The PPMS indicators, their relevance, and monitoring practicalities will be discussed with 
90. 
the  executing  agency,  implementing  agencies,  and  project  beneficiaries  during  project 
implementation. Disaggregated baseline data for output and outcome indicators gathered during 
project  processing  will  be  updated  and  reported  quarterly  through  the  semiannual  progress 
reports of the PMO and after each ADB review mission. These semiannual reports will provide 
information  necessary  to  update  ADB's  project  performance  reporting  system.38 At  the  start  of 
project  implementation,  the  PMO  and  implementing  agencies,  with  the  project  implementation 
consulting services, will develop integrated PPMS procedures to generate data systematically on 
the inputs and outputs of the components, as well as the indicators to be used to measure the 
project's  impact  and  outcome  taking  into  account  the  components'  scope.  The  PMO  will  be 
responsible  for  monitoring  and  reporting  on  project  performance.  The  basis  for  performance 
monitoring  will  be  the  design  and  monitoring  framework  (DMF),  which  identifies  performance 
targets for the impact, outcomes, and outputs of the project. By collecting data from the sources 
identified in the DMF, the PMO will be able to report on an annual basis the performance of the 
project. Specific reporting requirements will be set out in the agreement between ADB and the 
government.  The  PMO  will  collect  the  data,  calculate  the  indicators,  analyze  the  results,  and 
prepare a brief report describing the extent to that the project is generating the intended outputs 
and  outcomes,  as  well  as  the  overall  impact  on  the  project  municipalities.  The  relevance  and 
practicability of data collection for indicators was confirmed with the PMO and the implementing 
agencies. Meanwhile, the agreed socioeconomic and environmental indicators to be used will be 
further enhanced to measure project impacts. The PMO and the implementing agencies agreed 
and confirmed that they will (i) refine and integrate the PPMS framework at the start of project 
implementation; (ii) confirm that targets are achievable; (iii) develop recording, monitoring, and 
reporting arrangements; and (iv) establish systems and procedures no later than 6 months after 
project inception. 
2. 
Compliance Monitoring 
The executing agency, implementing agencies, and the project management consultant, 
91. 
will conduct compliance monitoring, submit reports and information to ADB concerning the use of 
the loan proceeds, project implementation, project implementation performance, and compliance 
of  loan  and  project  covenants.  These  reports  will  include  (i)  semiannual  progress  reports  on 
project implementation; and (ii) midterm adjustment report, and (iii) a project completion report 
(PCR),  which  should  be  submitted  not  later  than  3  months  after  the  completion  of  the  project 
facilities.  The  compliance  status  of  loan  and  project  covenants  will  be  reported  and  assessed 
through the semiannual progress report. ADB review missions will verify these statuses.

implementation  monitoring  and  progress 
reporting.  The  LIEC  will  review  project  progress  and  compliance  with  the  EMP  based  on 
consultation with environmental supervision consultant (internal), field visits, and the review of the 
environmental  impact  monitoring  conducted  by  the  EMSs.  The  findings  of  the  LIEC  will  be 
reported to ADB through the semiannual EMP monitoring and progress reports. The reports will 
include  (i)  progress  made  in  EMP  implementation,  (ii)  overall  effectiveness  of  the  EMP 
implementation  (including  public  and  occupational  health  and  safety),  (iii)  environmental 
monitoring  and  compliance,  (iv)  institutional  strengthening  and  training,  (v)  public  consultation 
(including GRM), and (vi) any problems encountered during construction and operation, and the 
relevant  corrective  actions  undertaken.  The  LIEC  will  help  the  PMO  prepare  the  reports  and 
submit the English report to ADB for appraisal and disclosure. 
External monitoring by independent agency. The PMO shall employ a qualified and 
95. 
experienced  external  environment  monitoring  agency  for  environmental  monitoring  using  loan 
proceeds. The external environment monitor shall monitor the project on a semiannual basis until 
a PCR is issued. The monitoring will include the review and analysis of project-related significant 
environmental  impacts,  progress  of  implementation  of  mitigation  measures  as  outlined  in  the 
project  EIA  and  EMP,  participation  in  ongoing  stakeholder  consultations  and  evaluation  and 
reporting  on  how  environmental  grievances,  if any,  are  handled.  The external  monitor/agency, 
through its report, will provide recommendations and suitable actions to the PMO. The external 
monitoring report will be provided to ADB for review and disclosure on the ADB website.

98. 
Internal monitoring of the EMDP will be conducted semiannually. Monitoring and reporting 
methodologies  are  specified  in  the  EMDP.  Each  implementing  agency  will  carry  out  internal 
supervision and monitoring to ensure compliance with the provisions of the EMDP. The PMO will 
prepare and submit an EMDP completion report to ADB. 
65 
d. 
Social and Gender Action Plan Monitoring 
99. 
The PPMS will include monitoring of the SGAP. Clear targets and indicators have been 
established and some indicators, such as those on employment, are also captured in the DMF. 
The SGAP will be monitored semiannually and reported via the quarterly project progress reports 
and during ADB missions. 
C. 
Evaluation 
100.  ADB, the executing agency, and implementing agencies will undertake semiannual review 
missions  to  evaluate  the  progress  of  project  implementation.  ADB,  the  executing  agency,  and 
implementing agencies will undertake a comprehensive midterm review within 2 years after the 
start  of  project  implementation  to  have  a  detailed  evaluation  of  the  scope,  implementation 
arrangements, resettlement, achievement of scheduled targets, and progress on the agenda for 
policy  reform  and  capacity  building  measures.  Feedback  from  the  PPMS  activities  will  be 
analyzed. Within 3 months of physical completion of the project, the PMO will submit a PCR to

E. 
Stakeholder Communication Strategy 
103.  Project  information  will  be  communicated  through  public  consultation,  information 
disclosure  mechanism  in  ADB's  and  government's  website,  meetings,  interviews,  focus  group 
discussions, and community consultation meetings, in accordance  with ADB's requirements of 
information disclosure policy (footnote 34). 
104.  Environment. Meaningful consultation at each project county/county-level city has been 
conducted during feasibility study and environmental impact assessment in accordance with the 
PRC Interim Guidelines on Public Consultation in EIA (2006) and ADB's SPS. During construction, 
the  affected  people  will  be  consulted  through  questionnaire  surveys  and  interviews  by  the 
environmental  management  unit  of  the  PMO  and  the  external  environmental  monitor.  The 
project's  environmental  information  shall  be  disclosed  by  the  local  EPBs  and ADB  as  follows: 
(i) the project EIA is disclosed at www.adb.org; (ii) the Chinese EIAs are disclosed on the website 
of  the  relevant  environmental  protection  bureaus;  and  (iii)  the  semiannual  EMP  progress  and 
monitoring reports will be disclosed at www.adb.org. 
105. 
Involuntary  resettlement.  Consultations  with  affected  households  and  other 
stakeholders  have  been  undertaken  and  will  continue  during  resettlement  plan  updating  and 
implementation. 
106.  Ethnic minority, and social and gender action plan. Consultations with communities 
have  taken  place  and  will  continue  at  different  points  in  the  implementation  of  the  EMDP  and 
SGAP not only to inform people about the components or specific activities, but also to enable 
people  in  the  community  to  ask  questions,  make  suggestions,  state  preferences,  and  express 
concerns. Special attention will be paid to the participation of women, ethnic minorities, and any 
other vulnerable groups, such as the poor. The PMO and implementing agencies will disclose the 
EMDP in their offices as well as the community offices and to ethnic minority beneficiaries in local 
languages where needed. 
107.  Public awareness and education program on solid waste recycling, sanitation, road safety 
etc. will be conducted as part of the project components and actions to enhance the involvement 
of women are included in the SGAP. Public hearings will be held for any proposed adjustments 
67 
in solid waste tariff attended with adequate representation of poor, women, and ethnic minorities, 
should the local government decide to set tariff for improved water services in the future. 
108.  Public disclosure. Public disclosure of all project documents will be undertaken through 
the project PMO and on the ADB website, including the project datasheet, DMF, environmental 
impact assessment, resettlement plan, EMDP, SGAP, and the report and recommendation of the 
President.  Disclosure  of  external  social  monitoring  reports  will  be  undertaken  during  project 
implementation. 
X. 
ANTICORRUPTION POLICY 
109.  ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any violations of the 
Anticorruption  Policy  relating  to  the  project. 40  All  contracts  financed  by  ADB  shall  include 
provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the 
executing agency and all project contractors, suppliers, consultants and other service providers. 
Individuals/entities  on  ADB's  anticorruption  debarment  list  are  ineligible  to  participate  in  ADB-
financed activity and may not be awarded any contracts under the project.41  
110.  To support these efforts, relevant provisions are included in the loan agreement, and the 
bidding documents for the project. ADB's Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) will 
be explained to and discussed with the executing and implementing agencies. Consistent with its 
commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to 
investigate any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the project. 
To address the risks on governance and corruption related to procurement of civil works, relevant 
provisions of ADB's Anticorruption Policy will be included in the loan agreement and the bidding 
documents  for  the  project.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in  connection  with  the 
project will include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and 
accounts  of  the  executing  agency,  implementing  agencies,  and  all  contractors,  suppliers, 
consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the project. The executing agency has 
indicated  its  commitment  to  promote  good  governance  and  establish  a  corruption-free 
environment under the project. Further to this, a number of good governance and anticorruption 
provisions have been included in the loan and project agreements. 
111.  The executing and implementing agencies will comply with ADB's Anticorruption Policy 
(1998, amended from time to time). The executing agency agrees (i) that ADB reserves the right 
to investigate any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the project; 
and (ii) to cooperate fully with, and to require contractors and suppliers to cooperate fully with, 
any such investigation and to extend all necessary assistance, including providing access to all 
relevant  books  and  records,  as  may  be  necessary  for  the  satisfactory  completion  of  any  such 
investigation. 
112.  The  executing  agency  will  (i)  conduct  periodic  inspections  on  the  contractors'  activities 
related to fund withdrawals and settlements; and (ii) ensure that all contracts financed by ADB in 
connection with the project include relevant provisions of ADB's Anticorruption Policy (1998, as 
amended to date) in all bidding documents for the project specifying the right of ADB to audit and 
examine the records and accounts of the PMO, implementing agencies, and all the contractors, 
suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the project.

41 ADB's Integrity Office web site is available at: http://www.adb.org/integrity/unit.asp. 
68 
113.  The executing agency and the implementing agencies will also (i) involve the agencies 
responsible for oversight of each implementing agency in bidding and construction to enhance 
construction quality control and supervise effective work; (ii) introduce a dual-signing system in 
which  each  works  contract  winner  also  signs  an  anticorruption  agreement  with  the  employer; 
(iii) periodically  inspect  the  contractors'  activities  related  to  fund  withdrawals  and  settlements; 
(iv) require  the  project  management  consulting  service  to  support  the  PMO  and  implementing 
agencies to ensure good governance, accountability, and transparency in project operations; and 
(v) in consultation with relevant ministries at the central level, update rules and regulations on 
corporate  governance  and  anticorruption  to  enhance  the  transparency  of  operations  of  the 
executing agency and implementing agencies. 
XI. 
ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISM 
114.  People who are, or may in the future be, adversely affected by the project may submit 
complaints  to  ADB's  Accountability  Mechanism.  The  Accountability  Mechanism  provides  an 
independent forum and process whereby people adversely affected by ADB-assisted projects can 
voice,  and  seek  a  resolution  of  their  problems,  as  well  as  report  alleged  violations  of  ADB's 
operational  policies  and  procedures.  Before  submitting  a  complaint  to  the  Accountability 
Mechanism, affected people should make a good faith effort to solve their problems by working 
with  the  concerned  ADB  operations  department.  Only  after  doing  that,  and  if  they  are  still 
dissatisfied, they should approach the Accountability Mechanism.42

ENVIROMENTAL MANAGEMENT PLAN 
A. 
Introduction 
This Environmental Management Plan (EMP) has been prepared for the proposed Hunan 
1. 
Xiangjiang River Watershed Exiting Solid Waste Comprehensive Treatment Project (the project). 
The  project  has  ten  subprojects  located  in  central  and  south  Hunan  province,  the  People’s 
Republic of China (PRC). This EMP has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of 
Asian Development Bank’s (ADB’s) Safeguard Policy Statement (SPS, 2009) on the basis of (i) 
a  consolidated  domestic  environmental  impact  assessment  (DEIA)  prepared  by  a  certified 
domestic EIA institute from Hunan province, (ii) a project feasibility study report (FSR), (iii) social 
and  economic  assessments  conducted  under  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance 
(PPTA),  (iv)  discussions  held  during  ADB  missions,  PPTA  consultants,  Hunan  project 
management  office  (PMO),  Hunan  Department  of  Environment  Protection,  ten  subproject 
city/county governments, including local environmental protection bureaus (EPBs), (v) two rounds 
of public consultation meetings at the ten subproject cities/counties attended by PPTA consultants 
and surveys. The EMP covers all project implementation phases, including planning, design & 
pre-construction, construction, and operation of all project components, and the impacts identified 
in relation to physical, biological, cultural and socio-economic resources, as discussed in Section 
VI (Anticipated Impacts and Mitigation Measures) of the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) 
for the project.  
B. 
Objectives 
The objectives of the EMP are to ensure the implementation of: (i) identified mitigation and 
2. 
management  measures  to  avoid,  reduce,  mitigate,  and  compensate  for  anticipated  adverse 
environment impacts, and (ii) monitoring and reporting against the performance indicators while 
ensuring that the project complies with PRC’s environmental laws, standards and regulations and 
ADB’s Safeguard Policy Statement (SPS 2009). Organizational responsibilities and budgets are 
identified for execution, monitoring and reporting. 
for 
The  EMP  defines  appropriate  mitigation  measures 
3. 
the  anticipated  project 
environmental  impacts,  and  the  institutional  responsibilities  and  mechanisms  to  monitor  and 
ensure  compliance.  The  EMP  specifies  (i)  objectives;  (ii)  implementing  organizations  and 
responsibilities;  (iii)  major  environmental  impacts  and  mitigation  measures;  (iv)  environmental 
monitoring  and  reporting  arrangements;  (v)  training  and  institutional  strengthening;  (vi)  future 
public consultation; (vii) a feedback and adjustment mechanism; and (viii) the project level GRM. 
The EMP will be reviewed and updated, if necessary, before construction starts, and will further 
be revised during the project implementation if determined that mitigation measures need to be 
amended or new measures needed. The updated EMP will be reviewed by ADB and disclosed 
on ADB’s website. 
C. 
Implementation Arrangements 
Hunan  Provincial  Housing  and  Urban–Rural  Development  Department  (HURD)  is  the 
4. 
executing agency (EA) for the project and it will provide the overall direction and guidance during 
project  preparation  and  implementation.  The  PMO  has  been  set  up  under  the  EA  and  is 
responsible for coordinating the implementation of the project activities on behalf of the HURD. 
5. 
The PMO is responsible for implementing EMP. At the design stage, the PMO and the ten 
implementation agencies (IAs) will request design institutes to incorporate mitigation measures 
70 
Appendix 
specified in the EMP in the detailed designs. The EMP will be updated at the end of the detailed 
design phase, and construction contractors are requested to comply with the updated EMP. To 
ensure the contractors comply with the EMP, the PMO and the implementing agencies assisted 
by the environmental consultants will prepare and provide the following specification clauses to 
incorporate in the bidding documents: (i) a list of environmental management requirements to be 
budgeted by the bidders in their tendering documents; (ii) environmental clauses for contractual 
terms and conditions; and (iii) environmental monitoring requirements in domestic EIAs, the EIA 
and the EMP. The PMO supported by the loan implementation environmental consultant (LIEC), 
will prepare semi-annual environment progress reports and submit them to ADB and the provincial 
EPB. 
6. 
The  PMO  will  nominate  a  qualified  environment  officer  to  undertake  effective 
environmental  management  activities  specified  in  the  EMP.  Environmental  engineers  of 
construction  supervision  companies  (CSCs)  contracted  by  each  implementing  agency  will  be 
responsible for the daily inspection, monitoring, and evaluation of implementation of mitigation 
measures. 
7. 
Each implementing agency will establish a project implementation unit (PIU) under which 
an environmental management unit (EMU) will be assigned. The EMU consists of a leader and

Asbestos 
The two MSW landfills to be 
extracted (mined) are 
located in small towns of 
Lanshan and Zixing with 
little industry in the 1970s 
and 1980s. The landfills 
were for municipal solid 
waste. Thus, it’s unlikely the 
waste to be extracted from 
the landfills contains ACM.

Environment Monitoring Plan 
20. 
An environmental monitoring plan (EMoP) focuses on the environment impacts within the 
project‘s areas of influence for each of the ten subprojects. The EMoP for the project has been 
developed  to  ensure  the  environmental  impacts  and  mitigation  measures  are  implemented.  A 
summery the EMoP is shown in Table EMP-6, which covers the scope of monitoring, monitoring 
parameters, time and frequency, and implementing agencies. The monitoring will comply with the 
methodology  provided  in  the  relevant  PRC  national  environmental  monitoring  standards. 
Environmental  Monitoring  during  the  detail  design  phase  will  be  conducted  as  per  the  EMoP 
including  further  investigations  for  high  mercury  concentration  in  surface  and  groundwater  at 
Loudi and Chenzhou city. Other associated compliance standards to be followed are the national 
environmental quality standards for ambient air, Groundwater, surface water and noise, and the 
effluent  discharge  standards  (see  project  EIA  Chapter  II).  Environmental  monitoring  program 
include the following: 
21. 
Internal monitoring by contractors. Civil works contractors will develop site EMP with 
environmental  management  and  internal  supervision  systems  based  on  the  approved  project 
EMP and the DEIAs, undertake self-check activities and fully cooperate with the local EPBs. Each 
contractor will have designated EHS staff responsible for site EMP implementation. 
Internal  monitoring/supervision  and  reporting  by  CSCs.  During  construction,  the 
22. 
designated  EHS  staff  from  CSCs  will  be  responsible  for  conducting  internal  environmental 
monitoring (consisting mainly of visual site inspection) in accordance with the monitoring plan. 
The  CSCs  will  be  supported  the  EMU  staff  and  the  LIEC.  Supervision  results  will  be  reported 
through the monthly reports to the PMO. 
23. 
Internal  environmental  monitoring  and  reporting  by  PMO.  The  LIEC  will  conduct 
regular site visits to monitor the EMP implementation progress. Results of site visits, project EMP 
implementation and environmental impact monitoring will be communicated to ADB through the 
semi-annual project progress reports prepared by the PMO. 
24. 
Independent/external EMP compliance monitoring. The PMO will contract a qualified 
independent  environment  monitor  agency  (EMA)  to  conduct  periodic  environmental  quality 
monitoring and EMP compliance verification in accordance with the monitoring program (Table 
EMP-6). The EMP will visit each construction site at least twice a year and submit semi-annual 
EMP monitoring reports during the construction phase to the PMO, which will forward the reports 
to ADB for review and disclosure on ADB’s website. A detailed cost breakdown will be provided 
by the EMA when the environmental monitoring program is updated and finalized at the start of 
each subproject implementation.

environmental performance of Guiyang County Tailing Pond. 
29. 
Semiannual  external  EMP  compliance  monitoring  report.  The  PMO  will  recruit  an 
external EMA to conduct independent EMP compliance monitoring and reporting. The EMA will 
visit each construction site, review information/data from the contractors and CSCs, review the 
semiannual  project  progress  report,  review  and  evaluate  the  environmental  monitoring  report 
prepared  by  the  monitoring  organization,  assess  construction  site  safety  management,  review 
EMP training program implementation and training records, and evaluate the effectiveness the 
internal  EMP  monitoring.  Semiannual  external  EMP  compliance  monitoring  report  will  be 
submitted  to  the  PMO.  The  report  will  include  a  comprehensive  assessment  of  the  EMP 
implementation, findings and recommended corrective actions to be taken. The PMO will forward 
the report to ADB semiannually for review and disclosure on ADB’s website. 
30. 
Environmental  acceptance  monitoring  report.  Within  two  months  after  project 
completion, environmental acceptance monitoring report for each subproject shall be completed. 
120

Training and Capacity Building 
31. 
To  ensure  effective  implementation  of  the  EMP,  the  capacity  of  the  PMO,  PIU,  CSCs, 
contractors  will  be  strengthened,  and  all  parties  involved  in  implementing  mitigation  measures 
and monitoring of environmental performance must have an understanding of the goals, methods, 
and the best practices of project environmental management. The EPB and LIEC will offer series 
of trainings to strengthen the capacity of the PMO and IAs concerned for EMP implementation. 
The main training emphasis will be to ensure that the contractors, CSCs, PIUs and PMO are well 
versed  in  environmentally  sound  practices  and  are  able  to  undertake  all  construction  and 
operation with the appropriate environmental safeguards. 
32. 
The training program also addresses long-term capacity building and awareness raising 
needs, i.e. for the operational phase of the sanitary MSW landfills. Training and awareness raising 
campaigns will be provided by qualified operation and maintenance experts and the consultants. 
33. 
Training  Needs  Assessments  will  be  conducted  by  the  LIEC  to  tailor  the  training  for 
maximum impact. The trainer will include in their program a before/after assessment to evaluate 
the success of the training. An evaluation questionnaire will be used to assess the effectiveness 
of  the  training  and  the  training  program  will  be  adjusted  based  on  feedbacks.  Training  will  be

Two rounds of public consultations were held during the preparation of the DEIAs and the 
project EIA. The results of the stakeholder consultation process demonstrated that all components 
under the project have strong local support. In compliance with ADB’s SPS (2009), environmental 
information related to the project was and/or will be disclosed to affected people as follows: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
this EIA is disclosed on ADB’s project website (www.adb.org), and is available for 
consultation in the PIUs’ and PMO’s offices;  
the DEIAs will be reviewed, disclosed and approved by the municipal EPBs where 
the subprojects are located; and  
semi-annual external monitoring reports on project’s compliance with the EMP as 
well as the Project Completion Report (PCR) will be disclosed ADB’s website at 
www.adb.org. 
37. 
During  project  implementation,  affected  people  will  be  consulted  and  informed  through 
formal questionnaire surveys, site visits and informal interviews by the PIUs and the LIEC. Public 
meetings will be organized by the PIUs prior to mid-term mission to present and discuss EMP 
implementation  progress,  solicit  community  opinions  and  concerns,  and  agree  on  required 
corrective  actions.  The  LIEC  will,  prior  to  the  PCR  mission,  organize  a  survey  to  assess 
community satisfaction with project implementation and project outputs. The EMA will assess the 
EMP implementation performance. 
K. 
Grievance Redress Mechanism 
38. 
A grievance redress mechanism (GRM) will be established for each subproject level. Each 
PIU  will  assign  one  staff  prior  to  construction  to  establish  a  Project  Complaint  Unit  (PCU)  at 
subproject level to deal with complaints from affected people throughout implementation of the 
project.  The  PCU  will  be  the  key  contact  point  for  local  community  representatives  who  may 
require information about the project or who have an issue they would like to discuss. The PCU’s 
phone  number,  fax,  address,  email  address  will  be  disseminated  to  the  public  and  each 
construction  sites.  Each  PIU  will  maintain  a  complaints  database  and  communicate  with 
contractors,  construction  supervision  engineers,  local  EPBs,  the  PMO,  and  representatives  of 
affected  local  communities.  All  costs  involved  in  resolving  the  complaints  (meetings, 
Appendix 
127 
consultations,  communication  and  reporting/information  dissemination)  will  be  borne  by  the 
respective PIUs. Costs related to escalated grievances will be covered by the PMO. 
39. 
Once  a  complaint  is  received  and  filed,  the  PCU  will  assess  if  complaints  are  eligible. 
Eligible complaints include those where (i) the complaint pertains to the project; and (ii) the issues 
arising in the complaint fall within the scope of environmental issues that the GRM is authorized 
to  address.  Ineligible  complaints  include  those  where:  (i)  the  complaint  is  clearly  not  project-
related; (ii) the nature of the issue is outside the mandate of the environmental GRM (such as 
issues related to resettlement, allegations of fraud or corruption); and (iii) other procedures are 
more appropriate to address the issue. Ineligible complaints will be recorded and passed to the 
relevant  authorities,  and  the  complainant  will  be  informed  of  the  decision  and  reasons  for 
rejection. 
The procedures and timeframes for the grievance redress process are described in the 
40. 
following five steps and also shown in Figure EMP-1. 
Stage 1: Resolution at Subproject Level. If a concern arises, the affected person (AP) 
41. 
may  try  to  resolve  the  issue  of  concern  with  the  GRM  designated  staff  at  the  subproject  or 
complain to the local authorities, such as local EPB. If the concern is resolved successfully by the 
subproject,  no  further  follow-up  is  required.  Nonetheless,  the  GRM  designated  staff  at  the 
subproject  shall  record  any  complaint  and  actions  taken  to  resolve  the  issues  and  report  the 
results to the GRM designated staff of PMO. If no solution is found within 7 working days or if the 
complainant is not satisfied with the suggested solution, proceed to Step 2. 
Stage 2: Official Complaint to PMO. The AP will submit the grievance directly, or via the 
42. 
PCU at the subproject, to the GRM designated staff of PMO who must assess the eligibility of the 
complaint,  including  whether  Step  1  has  been  implemented  properly,  identify  a  solution  in 
conjunction with the subproject, and give a clear reply within 7 working days to the complainant 
and to the GRM designated staff at the subproject with the suggested solution. The subproject 
PIU shall implement the redress solution and convey the outcome to the PMO within 7 working 
days. 
Stage  3:  Stakeholder  Meeting.  If  no  solution  is  identified  or  if  the  complainant  is  not 
43. 
satisfied  with  the  suggested  solution  under  Step  2,  the  subproject  PCU  will  organize,  within  7 
days, a multi-stakeholder meeting where all relevant stakeholders, including the complainant, the 
GRM designated staff at the subproject or other representative(s), the GRM designated staff of 
PMO, and local EPB will be invited. The meeting will aim to find in a solution acceptable to all 
parties, and identify responsibilities and an action plan. The subproject PIU will implement the 
agreed-upon redress solution and convey the outcome to the PMO within 7 working days. 
Stage  4:  Special  consultation. If  the  multi-stakeholder  hearing  process  under  Step  3 
44. 
cannot resolve the complaint successful, PMO in consultation with the PIU, the relevant EPBs, 
and ADB, will review the situation and attempt to develop an alternative approach to resolve the 
complaint within 7 working days. 
45. 
Step 5: Large  Scale  Stakeholder Meeting. If the  complainant  is not satisfied  with the 
suggested  solution  under  Step  4,  the  subproject  PIU,  PMO, relevant  EPBs,  and  other  local 
government authorities, shall organize another multi-stakeholder hearing process within 10 days 
and shall find a solution acceptable to all parties. Based on the agreement, an action plan shall 
be developed and implemented by the subproject PIU within the agreed timeframe.

Mechanisms for Feedback and Adjustment 
46. 
Based  on  site  inspections  and  monitoring  reports,  including  internal  and  external 
environmental monitoring reports, the PMO with the assistance from the LIEC will decide whether 
(i)  EMP  is  adequate  and  effective  and  further  mitigation  measures  are  required  as  corrective 
actions, or (ii) some improvements are required for environmental management practices. 
Appendix

The  effectiveness  of  mitigation  measures  and  monitoring  plans  will  be  evaluated  by  a 
47. 
feedback reporting system. Adjustment to the EMP will be made, if necessary. The PMO will play 
a critical role in the feedback and adjustment mechanism with the support from the LIEC.
