JFPR Project Administration Manual Purpose and Process 
The Japan Fund for Prosperous and Resilient Asia and the Pacific (JFPR) project administration 
manual  (PAM)  describes  the  essential  administration  and  management  requirements  to 
implement  the  JFPR  funded  project  on  time,  within  budget,  and  in  accordance  with  the 
government and Asian Development Bank (ADB) policies and procedures. The JFPR PAM should 
include references to all available templates and instructions either through linkages to relevant 
URLs or directly incorporated in the JFPR PAM. 
The  Civil  Society  Alliance  Forum  (CSAF)  will  act  as  the  executing  agency,  and  the  National 
Authority for Preah Vihear (NAPV) and Angkor Borei District Administration Office (ABDAO) will 
act  as  the  implementing  agencies.  The  executing  and  implementing  agencies  are  wholly 
responsible for the implementation of the project, as agreed jointly between the grant recipient 
and ADB, and in accordance with the government and ADB’s policies and procedures. ADB staff 
is  responsible  for  supporting  implementation  including  compliance  by  the  executing  and 
implementing  agencies  of  their  obligations  and  responsibilities  for  project  implementation  in 
accordance with ADB’s policies and procedures. 
CSAF, NAPV, ABDAO, and ADB shall agree to the JFPR PAM and ensure consistency with the 
grant agreement. In the event of any discrepancy or contradiction between the JFPR PAM and 
the grant agreement, the provisions of the grant agreement shall prevail. 
After  ADB  Board  approval  of  the  project's  grant  assistance  report  (GAR),  changes  in 
implementation  arrangements  are  subject  to  agreement  and  approval  pursuant  to  relevant 
government  and  ADB  administrative  procedures  (including  ADB’s  Project  Administration 
Instructions) and upon such approval, they will be subsequently incorporated in the JFPR PAM. 
I. 
PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
1. 
The  Community-Based  Tourism  COVID-19  Recovery  Project  will  promote  tourism 
development in (i) Techo Thamacheat village in Choam Khsant district, Preah Vihear province, 
and (ii) Prek Taphor village in Angkor Borei district, Takeo province. The two villages are located 
in waterfront areas and are close to significant heritage sites of the Sacred Site of the Temple of 
Preah Vihear and the Phnom Da temple.1 The project takes a two-pronged approach by promoting 
tourism along with supporting surrounding communities through high-value agriculture, to create 
new  agritourism  products  and  help  stabilize  rural  incomes  during  the  low  tourist  season.  The 
project will benefit 4,000 villagers by (i) building the capacity of local communities to provide new 
tourism services and products; (ii) improving tourism and agricultural livelihood opportunities; and 
(iii) providing  infrastructure  and  equipment  to  support  tourism  operations.  Through  tourism 
development and livelihood improvement, the project will catalyze the project villages’ economic 
recovery from the impacts of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. 
A. 
Impact and Outcome 
2. 
The  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  tourism  products  and  destinations 
diversified.  The  project  will  have  the  following  outcome:  tourism  developed  and  incomes 
increased in project villages.2 
B. 
Outputs and Key Activities 
3. 
Output 1: Local capacity for community-based tourism development and promotion 
strengthened.  This  output  will  benefit  villagers by enhancing  their  capacity  to  provide  tourism 
services. Under this output, the project will establish one community-based tourism (CBT) group 
in  each  project  village,  ensuring  women’s  representation,  to  become  local  tour  operators  and 
service providers.3 Membership of the CBT groups will be open to all villagers throughout the life 
of the  CBT  groups.  A  national  consulting  firm  will  be  recruited  to  support  local  communities to 
establish and manage CBT operations. Training will be provided on CBT group formation, guiding 
and servicing, hospitality, housekeeping, food and lodging hygiene, public health and COVID-19 
prevention, environmental and waste management, and maintenance of the tourism infrastructure 
to  be  provided  under  output  3.  While  the  CBT  groups  own the  tourism  infrastructure,  they  will 
have the option to enter into sublease agreements with local businesses to manage restaurants 
at  the  tourist  centers.  The  project  will  also  provide  a  three-year  marketing  campaign to  attract 
tourists.4 Trainings on sanitation will follow the government’s latest health and safety standards, 
which are updated in response to COVID-19. 
4. 
Output  2:  Community-based  tourism  and  livelihood  activities  implemented.  The 
1   United  Nations  Educational,  Scientific  and  Cultural  Organization  (UNESCO).  Cambodia.  The  Sacred  Site  of  the 
Temple of Preah Vihear was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2008. The Phnom Da temple is on the 
tentative list for UNESCO World Heritage sites. While lesser known, Angkor Borei district is about two hours’ drive 
from Phnom Penh and is an excellent weekend destination or a stopover en route to coastal provinces.  
2  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. 
3   Community-Based Tourism Groups Establishment, Bylaws, and Land Use Agreement (accessible from the list of 
linked documents in Appendix 2). The draft CBT bylaws provide for CBT groups formation and selection criteria for 
CBT members and board members.  
4   The project will initially target domestic tourism, and gradually shift to promoting intraregional tourism as Cambodia’s 
borders open. The marketing campaign will (i) support the CBT groups to raise awareness about the project villages 
and tourist centers, as new attractions that offer services such as boat paddling and freshwater prawn fishing, and 
amenities such as restrooms and waterfront restaurants; (ii) work with UNESCO to further amplify the world heritage 
status of the two temples and other cultural resources; and (iii) promote homestays in the project villages. 
2 
project  will  support  villagers,  including  female  headed  households  and  those  from  vulnerable 
groups,  to  establish  tourism  livelihoods,  such  as  guiding  services,  restaurants,  transport 
operations, equipment rental, homestay operations, and handicraft and souvenir manufacturing. 
The project will also support high-value agriculture in both project villages, such as cucumbers, 
long  beans,  watermelons,  chicken,  tilapia,  and  freshwater  prawns,  by  providing  agricultural 
trainings  and  equipment.5  With  proper  marketing,  high-value  agriculture  will  be  synergic  with 
tourism  and  stabilize  income  during  the  low  tourist  season.6  Agritourism  interventions  will  be 
supported in Techo Thamacheat village (for tilapia farming) and in Prek Taphor village (for prawn 
farming) so that, as an alternative to dine-in services at tourist centers, tourists can catch and grill 
fish and prawns after completing hatchery tours.7  
5. 
Output 3: Community-based public facilities and services enhanced. As the project 
villages lack tourism infrastructure, the project will provide the necessary infrastructure to enhance 
the  villages’  appeal  to  tourists  who  are  already  visiting  the  nearby  heritage  sites.  Civil  work 
construction will include female laborers. As basic connectivity infrastructure is already in place, 
the  project  will  focus  on  “last-mile”  tourism  infrastructure,  including  two  tourist  centers  (with 
parking  lots,  restrooms,  restaurants,  and  souvenir  outlets);  walking  tracks;  small  piers;  and 
support for homestays.8 The project will also implement CBT-managed waste collection services 
on  a  cost-recovery  basis  and  support  the  expansion  of  potable  water  services  to  about  3,000 
households in Techo Thamacheat village and surrounding areas, where the availability of clean 
water is identified as a constraint to tourism development.9 Asset maintenance will be performed 
by the CBT groups who will receive relevant training under output 1.

5   Financial  Analysis  for  High-Value  Agriculture  Livelihoods  for  Angkor  Borei;  Financial  Analysis  for  High-Value 
Agriculture Livelihoods for Preah Vihear (both accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). The crops, 
fisheries, and poultry are selected using the following key criteria: (i) financial viability; (ii) income generation potential 
during the low tourist season; and (iii) women’s economic empowerment. 
6   Between the peak tourist season (November to February) and the low tourist season (May to June), the variation in 
international arrivals can be as high as 47%. Tourism alone cannot provide year-round livelihoods for residents.  
7   Before COVID-19, the La Plantation peppercorn farm in Kampot province received over 50,000 visitors annually. The 
farm provided visitors with a free tour on peppercorn cultivation, after which the visitors bought peppercorn products 
as souvenirs and dined at the farm restaurant. 
8  Support for homestays will include house renovations and provision of sanitary toilets with septic tanks. Homestay 
households will receive related training under output 1, including on hospitality, housekeeping, waste management, 
and COVID-19 prevention. In total, about 10 households headed by women will be selected for homestay support.  
9   Potable water services are currently not available in Techo Thamacheat village. Potable water services are already 
in place in Prek Taphor village, Angkor Borei district.

7. 
National  Project  Steering  Committee.  The  Inter-ministerial  Committee  will  act  as  the 
National  Project  Steering  Committee  (NPSC)  and  will  provide  oversight  and  guidance  for  the 
project  at  the  national  level  and  will  meet  quarterly  in  the  first  two  years  and  semiannually 
hereafter  to  review  project  progress,  provide  policy  guidance,  and  facilitate  interagency 
coordination and exchange of lessons learned. The NPSC includes (i) the Chair; and (ii) selected 
members of the Inter-ministerial Committee which represent different technical ministries. 
11 
Executing Agency/PCU. CSAF will establish a project coordination unit (PCU). The PCU 
8. 
will  be  comprised  of  counterpart  staff  including  (i)  Project  Director,  (ii)  Project  Manager,  (iii) 
Financial  Officer,  (iv)  Procurement  Officer,  (v)  Gender  Officer,  (vi)  Monitoring  and  Evaluation 
(M&E) Officer, and (vii) Safeguards Officer. The PCU will be supported by two full-time contract 
staff: (i) an Accountant and Administration Assistant, and (ii) a Procurement Assistant. The project 
implementation  consultants  will  support  the  PCU  in  project  implementation,  compliance 
monitoring and reporting, and semiannual work planning and review processes.11 In addition to 
the responsibilities in table 3, the PCU will implement a 3-year marketing and branding initiative 
in  consultation  with  national  and  provincial  stakeholders  to  attract  tourists  to  the  new  tourist 
facilities, products and services, demonstration farms, including prawn hatcheries and homestays 
in the project areas. The marketing and branding initiative will target the domestic tourism market. 
The outputs and materials developed under this promotion and marketing initiative will be made 
available  to  the  larger  national  marketing  effort  aimed  at  attracting  international  visitors  from 
Cambodia’s Greater Mekong Subregion neighbors when travel bubbles and land borders reopen 
gradually over time. The project’s marketing and branding initiative will be supported by UNESCO, 
CATA, and MTCO.  
9. 
Implementing Agencies/PIUs. The PIUs in NAPV and ABDOA will be staffed with (i) PIU 
Project Director, (ii) PIU Coordination Officer, (iii) Accounting Officer, and (iv) Gender and M&E 
Officer. The PIUs will also be supported by full-time contract staff: (i) Finance and Administration 
Assistant and (ii) Gender and M&E Assistant. The PIUs will receive support from the PCU and 
the project implementation consultants. Technical trainers from the provincial line departments of 
(i)  Tourism;  (ii)  Agriculture,  Forestry,  and  Fisheries;  (iii)  Culture  and  Fine  Arts;  (iv)  Women’s 
Affairs;  (v)  Environment;  (vi)  Rural  Development;  and  (vii)  Health,  will  be  mobilized  to  provide 
targeted training and capacity building.  
Both PIUs will work closely with social enterprises and existing development partners for 
10. 
the following interventions: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
Support  the  expansion  of  potable  drinking  water  infrastructure  and  equipment 
through  co-financing  with  Teuk  Saart  1001  social  enterprise  to  provide  potable, 
affordable  and  home  delivered  drinking  water  to  3,000  individuals  and  14,100 
family’s members in Techo Thamacheat village;12  
Provide farmers with alternatives to existing expensive, polluting and high-water 
consumption  farming  practices  through  providing  water  pumps,  above  ground 
storage tanks and drip irrigation systems which have been effectively introduced 
by  Swiss  Development  Cooperation  “Cambodia  Horticulture  Advancing  Income 
and Nutrition Project” in horticulture production in Cambodia;  
Cooperate with the Natural Agriculture Village (NAV) to support farmers growing 
long beans, cucumber, and watermelons on Integrated Pest Management and in 
achieving  recognition  as  safe  vegetables  producers  under  the  Cambodian 
Participatory  Guarantee  System,  thereby  helping  farmers  to  access  the  more 
profitable safe-vegetables market through NAV’s clientele network;13  
11  The consultants’ terms of reference is in Appendix 5.  
12  Teuk Saat 1001 is the parent organization of O’We water filtration enterprises which are franchises operated by local 
entrepreneurs.  
13 PGS in essence is a group-guarantee system. Individual farmers are organized into a production group and pledge 
to each other on following safe cultivation practices (for example, abstinence from chemical inputs). On this basis, 
the group as a whole is recognized as safe agricultural producers by the partnering enterprises (in this case NAV 
and KOC), and the farmers’ produce will be marketed in the enterprises’ outlets as safe produce, which often fetch 
a premium. Under PGS, the famers and enterprises – and to a lesser extent, consumers, local government agencies 
12 
(iv) 
(v) 
(vi) 
Cooperate  with  Khmer  Organic  Cooperative  (KOC)  to  support  farmers  raising 
locally bred chickens under Participatory Guarantee System, which can be sold to 
KOC to its central market in Phnom Penh;  
Cooperate  with  NAV,  KOC,  and  Provincial  Department  of  Agriculture,  Fisheries 
and Forestry to build farmers’ capacity on IPM and keep pesticides application to 
the minimum level to minimize the risks to human health and the environment. 
Facilitate the Asian Institute of Technology (AIT) to support farmers in Angkor Borei 
district  to  establish  Cambodia’s  first  two  prawn  hatcheries,  with  the  capacity  to 
produce  feed  for  prawn  fingerlings  to  create  self-sufficiency  in  the  freshwater 
prawn aquiculture industry;14 and 
(vii)  Cooperate  with  Terao  Litech  Cambodia to facilitate tilapia  fingerlings  production 
and to provide stock for fish-rising farmers. 
11. 
CBT management of project-funded facilities will pilot a new mechanism developed under 
the  transaction  technical  assistance to underwrite the  sustainability  and independence  of  CBT 
groups  controlling  and  operating  project--funded  facilities.  Under  the  newly  introduced  sub-
national approval system under Sub decree 184 (December 2019), newly formed district technical 
teams under the district administration offices will provide CBT groups with formal certification. 
This new system which delegates authority to District governments is overseen by the Provincial 
Department of Economy and Finance (PDoEF) and the District Office of Interior. 
12. 
CBT  management  board  and  members  will  be  elected  based  on  experience  and 
qualification for board positions and professionally trained to the Association of Southeast Asian 
Nations CBT Standard which has been adopted and approved by the Ministry of Tourism (MOT). 
The PDoEF has the mandate for executing procurement, oversight of contracts arbitration and 
overall transparency for CBT contracts signed by CBTs with local business, suppliers, and civil 
works contractors. Within this policy and legal framework, the project will support CBT control and 
management of tourism facilities funded by the project. The detailed procedures are as follows: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
(v) 
(vi) 
CBT  groups  will  be  established  and  the  purpose,  aim,  mission  statement  and 
scope of operations of the CBT groups will be clearly defined in the by-laws of the 
legally registered CBTs; 
The CBT groups will be formally certified under the district registration systems;  
CBT  groups  will  be  “registered”  through  the  MOT’s  Department  of  Product 
Development;  
The management board will be elected by CBT group members based on the job 
descriptions and skills for management board positions; 
The government will provide CBT groups with legally binding land use agreements;  
At  the  option  of  the  CBT  groups,  PDoEF  will  support  CBT  groups  to  issue 
expressions of interest and requests for proposals for local businesses to manage 
the  restaurants  at  each  tourist  facility;  The  CBT  groups  may  sign  the  lease 
agreement with local businesses for a set term, renewable based on performance 
including  quality  of  services  and  profitability;  except  where  the  CBT  group 
determines  that  restaurant  operations  can  be  profitably  managed  by  the  CBT 
group management; 
and non-government organizations  – will organize periodic farm visits to exchange information and  monitor each 
other’s farming practices to ensure compliance with safe cultivation standards. Repeated non-compliance will result 
in the expulsion of the violator from the production group, or else the entire group will lose the PGS recognition.   
14 Currently, the fingerlings are imported from Viet Nam as Cambodia lacks capacity to breed them. 
13 
(ix) 
(vii) 
A monthly lease/rental fee will be negotiated (which could be incrementally scaled 
up or as a percentage of net profits) and this rental fee will be paid into the bank 
accounts of the CBT groups which will be audited by PDoEF each year;   
(viii)  The CBT groups will use the rental fee to provide basic services including waste 
management,  security  patrols  and  reserve  funds  for  depreciation  (capital 
replacement);  
In  the  event  of  dispute  between  the  CBT  groups  and  the  local  businesses,  or 
between the CBT groups or local authorities, the PDoEF will act as an arbitrator 
as a first step. If the disputes cannot be settled by the PDoEF within the specified 
time frames  in  the  land use  agreement  or  sublease  contracts,  CBT  groups  and 
private  sector  operators  can  revert  to  the  provisions  of  dispute  resolution  and 
arbitration  provisions  of  the  Civil  Code  of  Cambodia  (June  2003).  In  addition, 
PDoEF  will  support  CBT  groups  to  achieve  tax  exemptions  from  the  General 
Department  of  Taxation  to  further  underwrite  financial  viability  of  CBTs  for  a 
specified  period  to  be  agreed  by  the  General  Department  of  Taxation.  Draft 
Community-Based  Tourism  Groups  Establishment,  Bylaws,  and  Land  Use 
Agreement are in Supplementary Document 15. 
E. 
Community Coordination  
From  each  project  area,  the  community  will  elect  and  appoint  Community  and  Gender 
13. 
Focal  Points  (CGFPs)  consisting  of  five  males  and  five  females  to  serve  as  focal  points  to 
coordinate with the PIUs on all aspects of project planning, implementation, and monitoring.15 Of 
the 10 CGFPs, one male and one female will be seconded and selected from each CBT group 
managing tourism infrastructure at Choam Khsant and Angor Borei Districts. To promote mutual 
ownership of project work plans, the selected CGFPs will work with PCU and PIUs to monitor and 
review the semiannual workplans. Before the completion of each work plan period, the PIUs and 
CGFPs will review accomplishments, challenges, and lessons learned before selecting activities 
for inclusion in subsequent work plans. This information will be presented during NPSC meetings 
to demonstrate successful gender inclusiveness and meaningful community participation. 
F. 
Stakeholder Participation 
14. 
During  project  preparation,  comprehensive  consultations  were  held  with  government 
ministries,  provincial  departments,  development  partners,  nongovernment  organizations,  the 
Embassy  of  Japan  in  Cambodia,  the  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency,  and  potential 
project beneficiaries in the project areas. 
15. 
Local  ownership  and  mutual  responsibility  for  the  success  of  various  programs  will  be 
assured through community participation in project planning and review processes. Productive 
working  relationships  between  implementing  partners  and  beneficiaries  will  be  continually 
reviewed and improved through participatory planning and evaluation over the life of the project. 
The  executing  agency-based  PCU  and  field-based  project  implementation  consultants  will 
actively  encourage  continuous  dialogue  between  all  stakeholders  and  facilitate  adaptive 
management practices as required. 
15 CGFPs will work closely with PIUs to review and endorse semiannual work plans, assist in the planning of detailed 
interventions related to tourism and community health and sanitation and gender. In total there will be 10 CGFPs (5 
males, 5 females) from each project area.

FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT 
The financial management assessment was conducted during August to November 2020 
22. 
in accordance with ADB’s Technical Guidance Note for the Financial Management Assessment 
(2015). The financial management assessment considered the financial management capacity, 
staffing,  funds  flow  arrangements,  accounting  and  financial  reporting  systems,  financial 
information  systems,  internal  and  external  auditing  arrangements  of  CSAF  as  the  executing 
agency  for  the  project.  The  financial  management  assessment  also  assessed  the  financial 
management capacity of NAPV and ABDAO as implementing agencies. 
23. 
The  overall  pre-mitigation  financial  management  risk  of  the  project  was  assessed  as 
“high”. The major identified risks were the following: (i) the executing and implementing agencies 
20 
have  no  experience  in  implementing  ADB  projects;  (ii)  limited  capacity  and  experience  of  the 
executing  and  implementing  agencies’  staff  in  financial  management,  especially  in  financial 
reporting;  (iii)  lack  of  formal  financial  management  information  systems  for  project  financial 
reporting;  and  (iv)  lack  of  internal  audit  capacity  for  both  the  executing  and  implementing 
agencies.  
24. 
CSAF, NAPV, and ABDAO will need significant support to augment financial management 
capacity.  CSAF  will  be  supported  by:  (i)  a  National  Financial  Management  and  Administration 
Specialist  (17.5  months);  (ii)  a  National  Procurement  and  Contract  Management  Specialist  (8 
months); (iii)  an  Accountant  and  Administration Assistant  (48 months);  and  (iv)  a  Procurement 
Assistant. Relevant staff will be trained in disbursement and financial management procedures to 
establish  adequate  capacity  within  3  months  of  grant  effectiveness,  and  regularly  thereafter. 
Moreover,  MEF  will  stringently  supervise  CSAF,  NAPV,  and  ABDAO  in  the  preparation  of 
withdrawal applications. 
25. 
In  addition,  to  ensure  mitigation  of  the  identified  weaknesses,  the  executing  and 
implementing agencies have agreed to implement a financial management action plan throughout 
the project implementation period. The key measures, timeline, and respective responsibilities in 
the action plan are listed below:

Disbursement 
26. 
The JFPR grant proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB’s Loan Disbursement 
Handbook  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time),16  and  detailed  arrangements  agreed  upon 
between the government and ADB. In addition, they will attend training courses on disbursement 
offered by ADB and the Cambodia Resident Mission. 
27. 
Fund  flows  will  be  arranged following  the  standard operating  procedures  and Financial 
Management  Manual  of  the  government,  ADB’s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2017)  and 
16  Available at http://www.adb.org/Documents/Handbooks/Loan_Disbursement/loan-disbursement-final.pdf

procedures, and discussions with CSAF and ADB. The fund flow for the project is presented in 
Section G above.   
28. 
ADB  direct  payment  procedures  will  also  be  used  to  pay  suppliers,  contractors,  and 
consultants.  With  oversight  of  CSAF,  the  PCU  will  be  responsible  for  preparing  the  annual 
contract awards and disbursement projections, including in (i) requesting budgetary allocations 
for  counterpart  funds;  (ii)  preparing  withdrawal  applications;  and  (iii)  collecting  supporting 
documents for the project expenditures which they have incurred. 
29. 
Advance Account Procedure. After grant effectiveness, MEF’s General Department 
of International Cooperation and Debt Management will open an advance account for the grant 
funds in the National Bank of Cambodia. The General Department of International Cooperation 
and Debt Management will then transfer the control of the advance account to CSAF, thereby 
delegating the advance account. Two subaccounts will be opened for NAPV and ABDAO. The 
currency of the advance and sub-advance accounts will be the United States dollars. ADB and 
the  government’s  disbursement  procedures  will  be  followed  for  the  withdrawal  of  grant  funds 
through the advance and subaccounts. The executing agency, who will administer the advance 
is accountable and responsible for proper use of advances to the advance account, including 
advances to any subaccounts. 
The total outstanding amount of the advance account should not exceed 10% of the grant 
30. 
amount or the estimated expenditure for the next 6 months, whichever is lower.17 The request for 
initial advance to the advance account should be accompanied by an Estimate of  Expenditure 
Sheet setting  out  the  estimated  expenditures  for  the  first  6  months  of  project implementation, 
and  submission  of  evidence  satisfactory  to  ADB  that  the  advance  account  has  been  duly 
opened.18  For  every  request  for  liquidation  and  replenishment  of  the  advance  account,  the 
recipient  will  furnish  to  ADB:  (i)  Statement  of  Account  (bank  statement)  where  the  advance 
account is maintained; (ii) the Advance Account Reconciliation Statement reconciling the above-
mentioned  bank  statement  against  the  executing  agency’s  records,  and  (iii)  other  supporting 
documents as required and in accordance with ADB’s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as 
amended from time to time).19
Statement of Expenditure Procedure.20 The Statement of Expenditure (SOE) procedure 
31. 
will be used for reimbursement and to liquidate and replenish the advance account for eligible 
expenditures.  The  ceiling  of  the  SOE  procedures  is  agreed  at  the  equivalent  of  $30,000  per 
individual  payment.  Supporting  documents  and  records  for  the  expenditure  claimed  under  the 
SOE  procedure  should  be  maintained  and  made  readily  available  for  review  by  ADB's 
disbursement and review mission or upon ADB's request for submission of supporting documents 
on  a  sampling  basis,  and  for  independent  external  audit.  Reimbursement  and  liquidation  of 
individual payments in excess of the SOE ceiling should be supported by full documentation when 
submitting the withdrawal applications to ADB. 
32. 
Before  the  submission  of  the  first  withdrawal application, the recipient should submit to 
ADB sufficient evidence of the authority of the person(s) who will sign the withdrawal applications

missions and during normal program supervision, and followed up regularly with all concerned, 
including the external auditor. 
39. 
The government, executing agency, and implementing agencies have been made aware 
of ADB’s approach to delayed submission, and the requirements for satisfactory and acceptable 
quality of the audited project financial statements.22 ADB reserves the right to require a change in 
the auditor (in a manner consistent with the constitution of the borrower), or for additional support 
to be provided to the auditor, if the audits required are not conducted in a manner satisfactory to 
ADB,  or  if  the  audits  are  substantially  delayed.  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  verify  the  project's 
financial accounts to confirm that the share of ADB’s financing is used in accordance with ADB’s 
policies and procedures.  
Public  disclosure  of  the  project  financial  statements,  including  the  audit  report  on  the 
40. 
project financial statements, will be guided by ADB’s Access to Information Policy (2018). After

VI. 
PROCUREMENT AND CONSULTING SERVICES 
All procurement of goods, works, consulting and non-consulting services will follow ADB’s 
41. 
Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and Procurement Regulations for ADB 
Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time), and will be subject to ADB’s prior review.  
A. 
Advance Contracting  
42. 
No  contracts  will  be  signed  prior  to  grant  effectiveness.  All  advance  contracting  will  be 
undertaken  following  ADB’s  Procurement  Policy  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and 
Procurement  Regulations  for  ADB  Borrowers  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  its 
associated staff instructions. Advance contracting shall be applied for (i) the construction of the O 
Svay Lake tourist center in Preah Vihear, (ii) a project vehicle, (iii) office equipment; (iv) office 
furniture; and (v) seven consultancy contracts, (a) an International Tourism Development/Project 
Management Specialist - Team Leader, (b) a National Financial Management and Administration 
Specialist, (c) a National Procurement and Contract Management Specialist, (d) a National Civil 
Engineer;  (e)  a  National  Physical  Cultural  Resources  Conservation  Specialist,  (f)  Freshwater 
Prawn Aquaculture Technical Services; and (g) a National Firm to Support CBTs. Procurement 
procedures  for  all  advance  contracts  will  be  subject  to  ADB’s  prior  review.  The  executing  and 
implementing  agencies  have  been  advised  that  approval  of  advance  actions  does  not  commit 
ADB to finance the project. The steps to complete advance contracting include (i) for civil works 
and goods – tendering, bid evaluation and notice of contract award (ii) for individual consultants 
22 ADB approach and procedures regarding delayed submission of audited project financial statements:  
(i)  When audited project financial statements are not received by the due date, ADB will write to the executing 
agency advising that (i) the audit documents are overdue; and (ii) if they are not received within the next 6 
months, requests for new contract awards and disbursement such as new replenishment of advance accounts, 
processing of new reimbursement, and issuance of new commitment letters will not be processed. 
(ii)  When audited project financial statements have not been received within 6 months after the due date, ADB 
will withhold processing of requests for new contract awards and disbursement such as new replenishment of 
advance accounts, processing of new reimbursement, and issuance of new commitment letters. ADB will (i) 
inform the executing agency of ADB’s actions; and (ii) advise that the loan may be suspended if the audit 
documents are not received within the next 6 months. 
(iii)  When audited project financial statements have not been received within 12 months after the due date, ADB 
may suspend the loan. 
25 
– advertising (receiving of expression of interest [EOI]), evaluation and shortlisting (iii) for firms 
(CQS CBT firm) – advertising, evaluation of EOIs, issuance of RFP evaluation, and negotiations 
(iv) for (the direct selection for Freshwater Prawn Aquaculture Technical Services) issuance of 
RFP including cost estimates and evaluation, and negotiations. 
B. 
Procurement of Goods, Works, and Consulting Services 
43. 
All procurement of goods, works, and consulting services will be undertaken in accordance 
with  ADB’s  Procurement  Policy  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  Procurement 
Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time). 
44. 
In  case  of  inconsistency  between  ADB  procedures  and  the  Standard  Operating 
Procedures for Externally Financed Projects in Cambodia (December 2019), ADB procedures will 
prevail. The Project will recruit a National Procurement and Contract Management Specialist  to 
assist and provide guidance to PCU on procurement of works, goods, and services. 
Open  Competitive  Bidding  (OCB)  national  methods  will  be  used  for  civil  works  valued 
45. 
above $100,000 up to $3,000,000; and request for quotation (RFQ) procedures will be used for 
civil works valued at $100,000 and below. Goods packages are expected to cost not more than 
$100,000 and RFQ (both with advertisement and no advertisement) procedures will be used.  
46. 
Before  the  start  of  any  procurement,  ADB  and  the  government  will  review  the  public 
procurement laws of the government of Cambodia to ensure consistency with ADB’s Procurement 
Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and Standard Operating Procedures for Externally 
Financed Projects (December 2019). All procurement through OCB national  method will follow 
the applicable public procurement laws in Cambodia. 
47. 
An 18-month procurement plan indicating threshold and review procedures, goods, works, 
and consulting service contract packages, OCB national method, bidding guidelines is in Section 
C.  A  Strategic  Procurement  Plan  was prepared  to ensure  value for money is  achieved for  the

Pursuant  to  ADB's  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (SPS)  (2009),  ADB  funds  may  not  be 
applied  to the  activities described on the  ADB  Prohibited  Investment  Activities List  set forth at 
Appendix  5  of  the  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.  All  financial  institutions  will  ensure  that  their 
investments are in compliance with applicable national laws and regulations and will apply the 
prohibited investment activities list (Appendix 5) to subprojects financed by ADB. 
A. 
Environment Safeguards 
54. 
The  project  is  classified  as  Category  B  for  environment.  An  initial  environmental 
examination (IEE) was prepared for the project sites in  Techo Thamacheat village and Angkor 
Borei  district.  Adverse  environmental  impacts  are  expected  to  be  limited,  site-specific  and 
reversible,  as  analyzed  in the IEE.  These  impacts  will  be managed  through  the  environmental 
and  social  management  plan  (ESMP)  including  on  cultural  resources.  Domestically  no  impact 
assessment is required except the ESMP which is consistent with that in the IEE for ADB. 
55. 
The executing agency through the implementing agencies shall ensure that:  
(i) 
The project is implemented in accordance with the country’s laws and regulations 
related to environment, health and safety (EHS), including requirement on COVID-
19, as well as ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), as reflected in the ESMP;    
The ESMP shall be included in the bidding and contracts requiring contractors to 
comply with all applicable provisions and requirements;  
Adequate budget and staff resources are allocated for the ESMP implementation;  
(ii) 
(iii) 
25 For individual consultants (excluding time inputs for the three firms). 
38 
(iv) 
(v) 
During construction, the arrangement for supervision, monitoring and reporting of 
the  ESMP  implementation  consists  of  the  followings  in  order  to  be  more  cost-
effective: 
(a)  The National Civil Engineer and the resident engineers who will be on site will 
carry out routine checking and need to submit to the PIU at least monthly report 
on civil work progress and quality as well as contractors’ performance on the 
ESMP; 
(b)  On top of that, the PCU and PIUs supported by their environmental staff and 
consultants will carry out on-site supervision and inspection on random basis, 
and record in writing the findings and corrective actions if any; 
(c)  Quantitative  monitoring  as  specified  in  the  ESMP  will  be  undertaken  by  an 
external monitoring entity recruited by the PCU. The monitor will submit to the 
testing results, explanation if they comply with applicable standards or not, and 
analyze  the  reason  for  any  non-compliance.  A  budget  $10,000  from  JFPR 
Grant is allocated for this purpose. 
(d)  Based  on  the  work  of  items  (a)  to  (c)  above,  the  PCU  supported  by  its 
consultant  can  readily  compile  semiannual  reports  to  ADB  on  ESMP 
implementation. 
During operation phase, the measures developed as part of the ESMP provides 
guidance,  procedure  and  requirements  for  all  major  parties  involved  (the  PIUs, 
relevant  local  authorities,  operators,  etc.)  to  follow  to  ensure  compliance  with 
applicable EHS requirements. 
56. 
A grievance redress mechanism (GRM) will be established in each project community in 
compliance with ADB’s SPS (2009) requirement to prevent and address community concerns and 
adequately reverse any negative environment and social impacts. The GRM will be accessible to 
all  stakeholders  in  the  communities,  including  vulnerable  groups  such  as  women  and  youth. 
Multiple  points  of  entry,  including  face-to-face  meetings,  written  complaints,  telephone 
conversations, or e-mail, will be available. Details about the GRM can be found in the IEE and 
Stakeholder Communication and Participation Plan (SCPP) in Table 13.  
57. 
CSAF will appoint a Safeguards Officer tasked with the above key work and those detailed 
in  the  ESMP.  The  CSAF  needs  to  ensure  domestic  EHS  compliance  and  secure  relevant 
approvals/permits  before  the  project  effectiveness.  The  project  will  recruit  a  National 
Environmental Specialist to support the PCU Safeguards Officer for the above tasks.                     
Disclosure. The executing and implementing agencies will be responsible for disclosing 
58. 
all  safeguard  reports  at  the  provincial  level  and  on  the  CSAF’s  website.  During  project 
implementation, the semiannual environmental and social safeguards monitoring reports will be 
submitted to ADB every six months which will cover the reporting period from January to June 
(submitted in July) and July to December (submitted in January) for disclosure on ADB’s website.  
B. 
Social Safeguards 
Involuntary  Resettlement.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  C  for  involuntary 
59. 
resettlement in accordance with ADB’s SPS (2009). The due diligence and site assessments have 
been completed for Techo Thamacheat village and Angkor Borei district. It is confirmed that all 
the selected tourism facilities are located on state-owned land. Neither private land acquisition 
nor resettlement impacts are expected. 
39 
All the planned civil works will take place within the demarcated land areas. Consultations 
60. 
were conducted and a social due diligence report has been prepared to reflect the outcomes of 
the assessment and consultations with communities and local government authorities. Detailed 
engineering  design  (DED)  for  most  facilities  were  prepared,  and  due  diligence  completed  and 
covers all phases of construction. The PCU will appoint a Safeguards Officer who will oversee 
monitoring of both environmental and social safeguards to ensure compliance with ADB’s SPS 
(2009) requirements. The PCU will be supported by a National Social Safeguards Specialist, and 
a National Physical Cultural Resources Conservation Specialist. During implementation, the PCU, 
with the assistance of the relevant specialists, will update the safeguards documents as the DED 
for the remaining facilities are finalized. 
61. 
Indigenous  Peoples.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  C  for  Indigenous  Peoples 
safeguards in accordance with ADB’s SPS (2009). The due diligence confirmed that the project 
will not impact on indigenous peoples as it is not being implemented in indigenous communities. 
The project will not affect the dignity, human rights, livelihood systems, or culture of indigenous 
peoples or affect the territories of natural or cultural resources that indigenous peoples own, use, 
occupy, or claim as their ancestral domain. 
62. 
The government ensures that the project will not finance any project activities and tourism 
facilities entailing impact on ethnic minorities or indigenous peoples. The due diligence report will 
be updated in the event that there is any change to the DED or work methods as agreed between 
the executing agency and ADB. 
VIII.  GENDER AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS 
63. 
A  Social,  Poverty  and  Gender  Safeguards  Assessment  (SPGSA)  was  conducted  in 
accordance  with ADB  guidelines  to determine  the  socioeconomic  characteristics  of the  project 
areas.  The  SPGSA  includes  social,  poverty,  and  gender  analysis,  and  information  collected 
through meaningful consultations with communities living in the project areas. A summary poverty 
reduction and social strategy has been prepared to present benefits of the project, address and 
mitigate negative social impacts and enhance an equitable outcome for project beneficiaries.  
The project is categorized Effective Gender Mainstreaming under ADB’s project gender 
64. 
classification system. Project features ensure women’s participation in the design and function of 
tourism facilities at O Svay Lake and Angkor Borei tourist facilities and women’s participation in 
piloting  selected  high-value  agricultural  production  interventions.  The  project  has  specifically 
targeted  small  and  micro  enterprise  development,  high-value  agriculture  diversification  and 
gender-sensitive environmental and public health including COVID-19 preventions, clean water, 
and solid waste management awareness raising programs. Increasing women’s representation 
in project management and leadership roles in CBT had been prioritized (Table 13). 
65. 
Gender  action  plan  (GAP)  implementation  and  monitoring  is  estimated  to  cost  about 
$194,331  including  (i)  $36,303  for  gender  training,  gender  responsive  tourism  services  and 
agriculture  trainings  and  workshops;  (ii)  $31,818  for  homestay  renovation;  (iii)  $48,360  for 
different agriculture equipment supports, (iv) $49,000 for the National Gender and M&E Specialist 
and (iv) $28,800 for the Gender and M&E Assistants to be financed by the project. The executing 
and  implementing  agencies  with  support  from  the  National  Gender  and  M&E  Specialists  will 
for 
collect  sex-disaggregated  baseline  data  at  project 
implementation of the GAP. The PCU and PIUs will appoint counterpart Gender and M&E Officers 
and  Assistants  to  manage  and  monitor  the  implementation  of  GAP  activities  which  will  be 
articulated  in  semiannual  workplans.  In  addition,  communities  will  provide  10  gender  and 
inception  and  be  responsible 
40 
community  focal  points  to  support  GAP  implementation  and  the  GAP  monitoring  table  will  be 
included  in  the  project’s  quarterly  progress  reports  reviewed  by  ADB  and  the  NPSC.  ADB  will 
conduct detailed GAP reviews as part of the project’s midterm and final evaluations.

66. 
The project initially prepared a SCPP which is included in the SPGSA. The SPGSA will be 
updated during project implementation and is incorporated into the overall project design to further 
strengthen the project’s participatory processes. The SCPP outlines stakeholder and beneficiary 
participation processes and mechanisms that will be managed and implemented by the executing 
and  implementing  agencies.  The  SCPP  ensures  information  is  adequately  captured  and 
disseminated  between  stakeholders  at  each  level;  including  direct  and  indirect  beneficiaries, 
village and commune leaders, government agencies, non-government organizations, and social 
enterprises.   
Because  community  participation  is  fundamental  to  successful  implementation  of  the 
67. 
project, the SCPP will ensure mechanisms are established to effectively engage and represent 
local communities, women, and vulnerable groups. The project’s quarterly progress reports will 
monitor  the  effectiveness  of  the  SCPP  and  update  its  strategies  periodically  to  ensure  its 
mechanisms are functioning properly.

PERFORMANCE MONITORING, EVALUATION, REPORTING, AND 
COMMUNICATION 
A. 
Project Design and Monitoring Framework 
68. 
The DMF is in Appendix 3. 
B. 
Monitoring  
69. 
Project  performance  monitoring.  Project  performance  will  be  monitored  using  the 
targets, indicators, assumptions, and risks in the DMF. The PCU will be responsible for quarterly 
monitoring  and  reporting  on  the  performance  of  the  project.  Within  12  months  of  project 
effectiveness, the PCU, with assistance from the International Tourism Development and Project 
Management  Specialist  and  the  National  Gender  and M&E  Specialist,  will  develop  the  project 
performance management system (PPMS) that shall be used to monitor and evaluate the project 
during implementation. During PPMS preparation, the PCU will: (i) update baseline data for output 
indicators  gathered  during  project  preparation;  (ii)  determine  monitoring  and  reporting 
arrangements;  (iii)  confirm  data  sources;  (iv)  check  assumptions  and  risks;  and  (v)  establish 
systems and procedures for systematic data collection. The PCU will submit the final PPMS to 
ADB  for  approval  within  12  months  of  project  effectiveness.  The  National  Gender  and  M&E 
Specialist will organize training courses for staff at national and provincial levels on M&E skills 
and the implementation of the PPMS. 
70. 
Quarterly progress reports will include an assessment of overall implementation progress 
using  a  weighed  implementation  table  in  which  physical  progress  for  each  project  activity  is 
recorded and an aggregate overall weighted activity progress percentage is calculated. Quarterly 
progress reports will also include progress achieved as measured against the output indicator’s 
performance targets, and updates on the implementation status of the FM time-bound action plan. 
Prior to the midterm review and at the project’s physical completion, in addition to activity and 
output data, data will be collected on progress toward achieving the project outcome, which shall 
feed into the midterm review and project completion report. The weighed implementation table is 
in Appendix 4. 
71. 
The  executing  agency  will  be  responsible  for  managing  the  PPMS,  including  the 
confirmation of baseline data, collection of data, monitoring of benefits, and evaluation of social 
and environmental impacts. Data will be presented in simple, easy-to-understand formats. The 
PCU will be responsible for analyzing and consolidating monitoring data through the PPMS and 
ensuring its incorporation into periodic project reports. 
72. 
Compliance  monitoring.  Compliance  with  project  covenants  will  be  reviewed  during 
each  ADB  review  mission,  to  be  conducted  at  6-month  intervals.  The  executing  agency  will 
monitor  compliance  against  the  covenants  and  report  updates  in  quarterly  progress  reports 
submitted  to  ADB  and  the  Government.  Any  non-compliance  issues  will  be  specified  in  these 
reports,  with  proposed  remedial  actions  for  consideration  at  ADB  review  missions.  ADB  will 
update the e-Operations system following each review mission.  
73. 
Safeguards monitoring. The project’s classification is category B for environment, and 
category  C  for  involuntary  resettlement  and  Indigenous  Peoples  safeguards.  The  executing 
agency, through the PCU, will prepare integrated safeguard semiannual monitoring reports which 
will  report  on  status  of  ESMP  implementation,  and  confirm  that  there  are  no  unanticipated 
49 
involuntary  resettlement  or  indigenous  peoples  impacts.  These  will  be  disclosed  on  the  ADB 
project website.  
74. 
Gender  and  social  dimensions  monitoring.  Gender  and  social  dimensions  will  be 
monitored  internally  by the  PCU  and  PIUs’  Gender  and  M&E  Assistants  based  on  the  gender 
performance indicators indicated in the PPMS and using ADB’s GAP monitoring framework. The 
gender targets under outputs 1, 2 and 3 of the DMF include: (i) average annual gross income 
increased by 20% in Techo Thamacheat village and by 25% in Prek Taphor village, (ii) number 
of tourists increased 15% in Choam Khsant district, Preah Vihear province, and 10% in Angkor 
Borei district, Takeo province, (iii) at least 30% of members of each CBT are women, (iv) at least 
50% of female management committee members are trained on CBT and promotion, (v) 10% of 
CBT  and  high-value  agricultural  trainee  are  female  headed  households,  (vi)  at  least  30% 
participation  of  women  in  experience  sharing  workshops,  (vii)  at  least  200  individuals 
(disaggregated by sex) are supported by tourism and agriculture related activities, (viii) at least 
10% of female headed households are actively targeted and benefited from tourism related and 
high-value agricultural livelihood activities, (ix) at least 30% of attendees in consultation meetings 
on infrastructure design are women, and (x) at least 20% of unskilled labors are women. Within 
12  months from  project effectiveness  the  PCU, with assistance  from  the  International  Tourism 
Development and Project Management Specialist, and the National Gender and M&E Specialist 
will  develop  the  PPMS  and  associated  forms  to  systematically  generate  data  for  each  output. 
Selected indicators require sex-disaggregated data; these have been specified in the DMF. The 
PCU and PIUs are responsible for preparing and submitting quarterly reports on GAP and SCPP 
activities to the PCU, as part of the quarterly progress report, for consolidation and subsequent 
submission to ADB. 
75. 
During project preparation, a SPGSA was conducted in accordance with ADB guidelines 
to determine the socioeconomic characteristics of the project area. It included a poverty analysis, 
a social analysis and a gender analysis, and meaningful consultations with people living in the 
project areas. A summary poverty reduction and social strategy  has been prepared to present 
project benefits and mitigation measures, to address social impacts, and enhance distribution of 
project benefits to target communities. 
C. 
Evaluation 
76. 
Over  the  project  implementation  period,  ADB  and  the  government  will  conduct  regular 
missions, including one inception mission, seven semiannual review missions, and one project 
completion review mission. The inception mission will be fielded as soon as the project becomes 
effective. The first semiannual mission will be fielded approximately two calendar quarters from 
the  date  of  the  inception  mission,  and  the  remaining  missions  will  be  held  every  two  calendar 
quarters hereafter. Where possible, ADB review missions will be timed to be fielded within one 
month of submission of the quarterly progress reports to capture the latest project data. The mid-
term review mission will be fielded two years (eight calendar quarters) from the date of project 
effectiveness. Lastly, a project completion review mission will be fielded following  the project’s 
physical completion date. The missions will (i) review physical progress, achievement of contract 
awards  and  disbursements,  procurement  issues,  safeguards  compliance,  financial  audit  and 
grant  covenant  compliance,  grievances  redress  mechanism  establishment  and  its  functioning, 
GAP implementation and M&E issues; (ii) hold consultation meetings with Embassy of Japan and 
project stakeholders, including Japan International Cooperation Agency, UNESCO, CATA, and 
social enterprises; (iii) visit project sites to hold consultation meetings with project communities; 
and (iv) the performance of government agencies, implementation units, consultants, contractors 
and  suppliers.  Within  6  months  of  physical  completion  of  the  project,  CSAF  will  submit  the 
50 
government’s project completion report to ADB. In addition to the regular reviews, ADB and the 
government may conduct special project administration reviews to address and resolve specific 
administration problems. Guidance notes on the visibility of Japan and the Embassy of Japan are 
in Appendices 2 and 3.  
The  midterm  evaluation  will 
77. 
include  a  comprehensive  assessment  of  project 
implementation and record any changes necessary to improve project relevance or effectiveness 
or accelerate physical progress. The National Gender and M&E Specialist will assist the executing 
agency to collect the necessary data and assessments of the project that will be used to compile 
the midterm evaluation report. Specific areas of focus will include (i) review of project scope and 
progress towards DMF output targets and the project’s outcome; (ii) suitability of implementation 
arrangements;  (iii)  adequacy  of  costs  and  financing  and  reallocation  of  grant  proceeds;  (iv) 
performance  of  consultants,  contractors  and  suppliers;  (v)  performance  of  the  executing  and 
implementing agencies; (vi) compliance with project covenants; and (viii) sustainability of project 
interventions.  
D. 
Reporting  
78. 
The  executing  agency  will  provide  ADB  with  (i)  quarterly  progress  reports  in  a  format 
consistent  with  ADB’s  project  performance  monitoring  system;  (ii)  consolidated  annual  reports 
including  (a)  progress  achieved  by  output  as  measured  through  the  indicator’s  performance 
targets  against the  baseline  data, (b)  key implementation  issues  and  solutions;  (c)  safeguards 
compliance;  (d)  annual  project 
the  auditor’s 
recommendation; (e) updated procurement plan; (f) updated implementation plan for the next 12 
months; (g) updates on the implementation status of the FM time-bound action plan; (iii) annual 
audited project financial reports; and (iv) a government’s project completion report within 6 months 
of the project physical completion. To ensure projects continue to be both viable and sustainable, 
project financial statements, together with the associated auditor’s report, should be adequately 
reviewed. 
financial  statements  with  updates 
from 
E. 
Stakeholder Communication Strategy  
79. 
Stakeholder  consultations  will  continue  throughout  project  implementation,  regularly 
referencing the information gathered during initial consultations with various stakeholders. The 
various stakeholders to be  consulted,  objectives  of  involvement, mechanisms  for  participation, 
agencies responsible for leading/organizing consultations, timing and resources are in the SCPP. 
The executing and implementing agencies’ implementation of the SCPP will be supported by the 
project’s  International  Tourism  Development/Project  Management  Specialist  and  the  National 
Gender and M&E Specialist (Table 13).

ANTICORRUPTION POLICY  
Cambodia  has  evolving  anti-corruption  institutions  and  legislation  in  place  however,  ad 
80. 
implementation  and  enforcement  of  anti-corruption  measures  expose  Cambodia’s 
hoc 
vulnerability  to  corruption.  Transparency  International’s  Corruption  Perception  Index  ranks 
Cambodia 160/180 and a score of 21/100 of the assessed countries in 2020. At the same time 
Transparency  International’s  Global  Corruption  Barometer  for  Cambodia  reveals  33%  of 
Cambodians see corruption as a major issue, with 37% of public service users paying bribes to 
51 
government officials in the last 12 months.26 Cambodia also ranked 106 out of 140 countries and 
with a score of 52.08% on the Global Competitive Report released by the World Economic Forum 
for 2019.27 Cambodia also remains on the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) grey list which 
indicates that member countries have deficiencies in the laws, rules, and regulations to combat 
money laundering, financing terrorism, and weakness to mitigate financial crime. The FATF’s Asia 
Pacific Group on Money Laundering in its Jurisdictions Under Increased Monitoring Report (June 
2021) noted Cambodia’s continued progress across its action plan; however, all deadlines have 
now  expired,  and  significant  work  remains  to  be  completed.28  Cambodia  established  an  anti-
corruption  mechanism  in  1999  and  joined  the  ADB/OECD’s  Anti-Corruption  Initiatives  for  Asia 
and the Pacific in 2003. Cambodia’s Anti-Corruption Unit was inaugurated in 2006 and Cambodia 
joined the United Nations Convention Against Corruption as a full member in 2007. In the same 
year,  Cambodia  became  a  member  of  the  Southeast  Asia  Parties Against  Corruption.  In  2010 
Cambodia  enacted  the  Law  on  Anti-Corruption  which  further  strengthened  the  ACU’s  work  in 
partnership with the National Anti-corruption Council. Given the increasing expectation of citizens 
of improved governance, the anti-corruption mechanisms need to be strengthened. In this regard, 
integrity due diligence in respect of CSAF was conducted and no significant integrity risks were 
identified. Cambodia’s integrity and corruption risks have also been considered in the project risk 
assessment and risk management plan. ADB’s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) 
was  explained  and  discussed  with  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies  during  project 
preparation and through a one-day workshop on 28 September 2021 on ADB’s Anti-corruption 
Policy. 
81. 
ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any violations of the 
Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) relating to the project. All contracts financed by 
ADB shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and 
accounts of the executing agency and all project contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other 
service providers. Individuals and entities on ADB’s anticorruption debarment list are ineligible to 
participate in ADB-financed activity and may not be awarded any contracts under the project. 
82. 
To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  anti-corruption  provisions  are  included  in  the  grant 
agreement covenants and the bidding documents for the project. The government will ensure that 
all  PCU  and  PIU  project  staff  are  fully  aware of and comply  with the  government’s  and  ADB’s 
procedures for: (i) implementation; (ii) procurement; (iii) use of consultants; (iv) disbursement; (v) 
reporting; (vi) monitoring; and (vii) prevention of fraud and corruption.  
83. 
The  executing  agency  shall  (i)  undertake  necessary  measures  to  create  and  sustain  a 
corruption-free environment for activities under the project; (ii) comply with ADB’s Anticorruption 
Policy  (1998,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  (iii)  where  appropriate,  ensure  that  relevant 
provisions of ADB’s Anticorruption Policy are included in all bidding documents for the project. 
The executing agency (i) acknowledges ADB’s right to investigate, directly or through its agents, 
any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive and coercive practices relating to the project; and (ii) 
agrees  to  cooperate  fully  with  any  such  investigation  and  to  extend  all  necessary  assistance, 
including  providing  access  to  all  relevant  books  and  records,  as  may  be  necessary  for  the 
satisfactory completion of any such investigation. All external costs related to such investigations 
shall be met by the project resources or by the executing agency.

84.  Without limiting the generality of the preceding paragraph, the executing agency shall (i) 
conduct periodic inspections on the activities of the suppliers, contractors, consultants and other 
service providers relating to the grant proceeds, fund withdrawals and settlements; and (ii) ensure 
that all contracts financed by ADB in connection with the project include provisions specifying the 
right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  executing  agency,  and  all 
suppliers, contractors, consultants and other service providers as they relate to the project.  
XI. 
ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISM 
85. 
For  civil  subprojects,  PCU  will  ensure  that  the  grievance  redress  mechanism  (GRM)  is 
publicized locally so that the community is fully aware of the mechanism and the local focal points 
which will provide access to the GRM. People who are, or may in the future be, adversely affected 
by the project may submit complaints to ADB’s Accountability Mechanism.29 The Accountability 
Mechanism provides an independent forum and process whereby people adversely affected by 
ADB-assisted projects can voice, and seek a resolution of their problems, as well as report alleged 
violations of ADB’s operational policies and procedures.  
86. 
A  GRM  will  be  established  for  the  project.  The PCU  and each  PIU  will  appoint  a  GRM 
focal point to respond to any complaints concerning civil work subprojects. This mechanism will 
align with the mechanism outlined in the safeguards and environment planning documents. The 
PCU will keep a record of complaints and will report any significant complaints in the project’s 
quarterly progress reports and the semiannual safeguards monitoring reports.  
For general complaints, the PCU will establish a Project Public Complaint Unit which will 
87. 
act as a central recording and coordinating unit for all complaints. The Project Public Complaint 
Unit will consist of the PCU Project Manager, Safeguards Officer, PIU Gender and M&E Officer, 
two community representatives (one from CBT group, and one from farming communities), and 
one representative from the Commune Council Office, who will convene to discuss and address 
the  complaints.  The  PCU  Project  Manager  will  act  as  the  chairperson  of  the  Project  Public 
Complaint Unit. 
For  complaints  relating  to  procurement,  the  executing  agency  shall  set  up  a  project 
88. 
website that shall disclose how the grant proceeds are being used, contracts awarded, and other 
project information including: (i) the list of participating bidders; (ii) the name of the winning bidder; 
(iii) basic details on bidding procedures adopted; (iv) the amount of the contract awarded; (v) the 
list of goods and/or services purchased; (vi) safeguards monitoring reports; (vii) quarterly progress 
reports; and (viii) the GRM. The website shall be updated within two weeks after: (i) each award 
of contract; and (ii) each submission of quarterly reports and safeguards monitoring reports. In 
addition, winning bids for each civil works contract will be posted on participating commune notice 
boards.

APPENDIX 1: GUIDANCE NOTES ON VISIBILITY OF JAPAN FUND FOR PROSPEROUS 
AND RESILIENT ASIA AND THE PACIFIC AND ON JAPANESE VISIBILITY 
I. 
INTRODUCTION 
1. 
The Revised Operating Framework for the Japan Fund for Prosperous and Resilient Asia 
and the Pacific (JFPR) was approved on 6 October 2009, combining Japan’s project grant and 
technical assistance support under one umbrella, and paving the way for a more comprehensive 
approach to the use of these funds towards addressing poverty, building up human resources, 
and empowering institutions and communities in the region. Japan has been making generous 
contributions for technical assistance activities through the Japan Special Fund, and for poverty 
reduction projects through JFPR, since they were established in 1988 and 2000, respectively. It 
is but fitting and proper that said contributions are acknowledged and the recipients and general 
public are informed of the source of the funding assistance both at the Fund level and at the level 
of  the  individual  TA  and  project  grants.  The  purpose  of  this  note  is  to  provide  guidance  on 
measures to ensure that the contribution of Japan in supporting JFPR is widely recognized.1  
II. 
STATEMENT ON JAPANESE VISIBILITY  
Project teams are required to help promote the visibility and local awareness of JFPR in 
2. 
recipient countries through the following:  
(a) 
(b) 
(c) 
All press releases issued by ADB with respect to JFPR should refer to the financial 
contribution from the Government of Japan (GOJ);2   
Signing  ceremonies  and  other  publicity  events  should  be  encouraged,  inviting 
Japan embassy officials, JICA staff, local and international press;3  
Civil  works,  project  billboards/signages, vehicles,  and  equipment must carry  the 
JFPR and Japan ODA logos (see below). Likewise, all publications and training 
programs  must  bear  the  said  logos,  including  all  collaterals  used  (i.e.  training 
materials, banners, posters, flyers, etc.) that are financed by JFPR; these logos 
are available in the SDPF-JFPR website; 3  
(d) 
(e) 
Publications,  reports,  training  programs,  seminars  and  workshops  financed  by 
JFPR should acknowledge receipt of funding from GOJ;  
Recipients should be encouraged to ensure that JFPR-financed activities are well 
covered by local print and electronic media, and that all related publicity materials, 
1   A copy of the Guidance Note on Japanese Visibility is appended to the Project Administration Manual as guide to 
the project team and the government, during project implementation.    
2   Staff may coordinate with the Department of Communications. 3 Coordination with resident missions are necessary.

54        Appendix 1 
and  official  notices  explicitly  acknowledge  funding  from  GOJ.  Below  is  the 
suggested standard text to be used by those who prepare publicity materials:  
“The grant fund for (project name/activity) was received from the Japan Fund for 
Prosperous  and  Resilient  Asia  and  the  Pacific  financed  by  the  Government  of 
Japan through the Asian Development Bank”.   
III. 
PARTICIPATION OF JAPANESE ENTITIES IN IMPLEMENTATION  
It  is  also  important  to  generate  visibility  of  the  project  within  Japan.  Involvement  or

APPENDIX 2: GUIDANCE NOTE ON COORDINATION WITH THE EMBASSY OF JAPAN 
AND JICA 
I. 
INTRODUCTION 
The Final  Report  on the  Review  of  Japanese Official  Development  Assistance  1  (ODA) 
1. 
underscores the need for strategic and effective aid. One way to ensure alignment of Japan Fund 
for Prosperous and Resilient Asia and the Pacific (JFPR) projects and technical assistance (TA) 
with  Government  of  Japan’s  (GOJ)  bilateral  assistance  strategy  for  a  particular  developing 
member country (DMC) is by bringing on board the comments and suggestions of the Embassy 
of Japan (EoJ) and the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA).2 Thus, the summary of 
consultations with EoJ and JICA (to include, date of consultation, name and position of staff met, 
and EoJ and JICA’s response) should be included in the proposal submitted to the Partner Funds 
Division (SDPF) of the Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department of the Asian 
Development  Bank.3  This  Guidance  Note  provides  detailed  instructions  regarding  coordination 
activities with EoJ and JICA.  
II. 
EOJ AND JICA CONTACT PERSONS  
As soon as project officer informs SDPF of the intent to apply for JFPR funding,4 SDPF 
2. 
will identify the appropriate contact persons in EoJ and JICA. The contact persons’ information5 
will be provided by SDPF to the project officer to start consultation.   
III. 
CONSULTATION WITH EOJ AND JICA – PROPOSAL PREPARATION  
At  concept  stage,  project  officer  should  consult  with  EoJ  and  JICA6  through  e-mail  the 
3. 
proposed project to, (i) seek if it is in line with Japan ODA priorities, (ii) ensure no duplication, and 
(iii) present the concept itself, with copy to SDPF.   
4. 
Upon SDPF’s confirmation to proceed with proposal preparation, the project officer may 
arrange  the  project  design  meeting  with  EoJ  and  JICA.  This  meeting  intends  to  explain  and 
discuss the actual project design. This is ideally conducted during the fact-finding mission.7 The 
proposal,8 should be provided to EoJ and JICA with copy to SDPF at least 5 working days before 
the meeting to give ample time for review and consideration. After the meeting, if needed, SDPF 
in coordination with the project officer, may follow-up with EoJ and JICA, and respond to requests 
for clarification.  
In the case of regional Tas, the draft TA Summary and Report should be sent by email to

the resident mission9 with copy to SDPF. If needed, SDPF supports identifying the appropriate 
staff to be consulted.   
Resident mission will also arrange the Grant Agreement/TA letter signing event (section 
7. 
V) and in the overall coordination/relationship management with EoJ and JICA.  
8. 
SDPF’s role are as follows: (i) provide contact details of relevant staff from EoJ and JICA 
for project consultation; (ii) liaise any need for clarification by EoJ and JICA in coordination with 
the project officer, during project consultation; (iii) inform EoJ and JICA when there is withdrawal 
or cancellation of a project; and (iv) forward all completion reports to both agencies.    
V. 
COORDINATION WITH EOJ AND JICA – UPON APPROVAL OF THE PROPOSAL  
9. 
Project  officer  should  inform  EoJ  and  JICA  about  ADB’s  approval.  Project  officers  are 
strongly  encouraged  to  conduct  signing  or  launching  ceremonies  with  the  attendance  of  EoJ 
officials.10  
10. 
In coordination with the resident mission, the project officer should inform EoJ and SDPF 
of the signing ceremony – at least 10 working days in advance. SDPF then informs GOJ of this 
activity. The project officer should also draft news releases in consultation with the Department of 
communications and coordinate arrangements with the resident mission. Local and international 
press are invited to these ceremonies.  
VI. 
COORDINATION WITH EOJ AND JICA – DURING PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION 
AND UPON PROJECT COMPLETION  
11. 
Throughout implementation, the project officer should inform EoJ about project progress, 
milestones,  and  outcomes,  and  discuss  when  major  changes  in  scope  and  objectives  are 
required. Progress and outcomes of JFPR projects are also requested to be shared with JICA. 
From time to time, EoJ and JICA may also wish to join completion review missions in order to see 
project results and to interact first-hand with project recipients. Lessons from the JFPR projects 
are also requested to be shared to enable both sides to explore and seek potential collaboration. 
Completion reports are required to be submitted by the project officer to SDPF for forwarding to 
EoJ and JICA.11

Project Background 
21. 
The  proposed  Community  Based  Tourism  for  COVID-19  Recovery  Project  will  help 
accelerate  post-coronavirus  disease  (COVID-19)  tourism  recovery  in  rural  communities  living 
near Preah Vihear (Preah Vihear province) and Phnom Da (Takeo province) heritage sites. The 
project  aims  to  (i)  strengthen  local  capacity  for  inclusive  community-based  tourism  (CBT) 
development and promotion; (ii) support tourism and commercial agricultural livelihood activities; 
and (iii) enhance community-based public facilities and services. Initially, the project will promote 
domestic tourism, which is less affected by COVID-19 related travel restrictions. As Cambodia’s 
borders open to international travel the project focus will shift to promoting intra-regional tourism. 
22. 
Output 1: Local capacity for community-based tourism development and promotion 
strengthened. The project will train CBT groups, ensuring women’s representation, to become 
local tour operators and service providers. Training will cover CBT group formation, guiding and 
servicing,  food  and  lodging  hygiene,  maintenance  of  tourist-related  infrastructure  (to  be 
constructed under output 3), financial management, domestic and intra-GMS marketing activities, 
and tourism management including tourist traffic control and mitigating potential adverse impacts 
(environmental impact, child labor or exploitation, and human or antique trafficking). Any aspect 
of  the training  pertinent  to sanitation  and  hygiene  will  straightly  follow  MOT’s  latest  health  and 
safety standards, which are updated in response to the pandemic. 
23. 
Output  2:  Community-based  tourism  and  livelihood  activities  implemented.  The 
project will develop tourist activities and complementary services such as food servicing, lodging, 
and  handicrafts.  Tourist  activities  will  be  developed  through  inclusive  consultations  and 
customized  to  the  villages’  comparative  advantages  in terms  of  cultural  and  natural  resources 
endowment.  The  project  will  support  project  villages  to  develop  complementary  CBT  products 
and explore ways to link traditional rural Khmer cultural practices and agricultural livelihoods with 
itinerary development. Lastly, the project will support commercial agricultural activities to provide 
livelihoods to (i) current residents and returning emigrants who lose employment; and (ii) stabilize 
income during non-tourist season. The project will mitigate demand risks by (i) collaborating with 
United  Nations  Educational,  Scientific  and  Cultural  Organization  (UNESCO)  and  Cambodian 
Associations of Travel Agents (CATA) on tourism product development and promotion; and (ii) 
connecting farmers to a safe vegetable cleaning company that is supplying to supermarkets in 
Phnom Penh. Tourism and commercial agriculture can be synergic. With proper marketing and 
guiding,  agriculture  can  become  an  attraction  as  is  demonstrated  by  a  private  peppercorn 
planation in Kampot province. 
24. 
Output 3: Community-based public facilities and services enhanced. The project will 
provide  small-scale  rural  infrastructure  and  equipment  that  are  essential  to  the  operations  of 
tourism  and  livelihood  activities.  Since  basic  connectivity  infrastructure  is  already  in  place,  the 
project will focus on “last-mile” infrastructure to improve the villages’ appeal to tourists. Examples 
include  village  tracks,  small  piers,  market  facilities,  and  sanitation  facilities,  shelters  for  small 
livestock,  and  equipment  for  commercial  agricultural  and  agro-tourism  activities.  Asset 
maintenance is to be performed by CBT groups, and the project will provide related training under 
output 1. The provision of public infrastructure will also improve the livability of rural areas.  
These outputs will result in the following outcome: income increased tourism development 
25. 
in project villages, and the following impacts: tourism products and destination diversified. 
Purpose of the Assignment

implemented. In particularly, the project will support the technical assistance on giant freshwater 
prawn  hatchery  development  and  grow  out  training  in  Angkor  Borei  District  in  Takeo  Province 
Cambodia. 
27. 
Giant freshwater prawn (Macrobrachium rosenbergii) in Cambodia is delicacy and fetches 
high prices. Most prawns are caught from natural water bodies such as rivers and lakes. However, 
this  wild  resource  is  declining  and  there  has  never  been  enough  supply  to  satisfy  the  market 
demand. Freshwater prawns are also imported from Vietnam and Thailand especially near the 
border areas. The introduction of aquaculture farming technology is the most efficient method to 
compensate this  declining  wild stock. If  the  technologies are  made  available,  it  will  allow  local 
communities to produce high protein, farmed freshwater prawns which will generate substantial 
income  for  local  people  and  also  support  the  tourism  industry  with  new  attractions  including 
recreational fishing. Several countries are developing aquaculture of freshwater prawns such as 
Bangladesh, Fiji, Myanmar, Madagascar, Nepal, Nigeria and the Pacific Islands. 
In  Thailand,  hatchery,  nursery  and  grow-out  technologies  are  available  that  make  it 
28. 
possible to produce mass-scale seed (post-larvae) and large size prawn for local and international 
markets. Cambodia has the opportunity to replicate the success of freshwater prawn farming in 
Thailand  and  develop  self-sufficiency  in  terms  of  breeding  and  feed  production.  The  technical 
assistance consultancy for giant freshwater prawn hatchery development and grow out training 
aims to increase the income of local people through prawn farming. 
Duration and Location of the Services 
29. 
The  timeframe  of  the  services  is  36  months  from  mid-2021  to  mid-2024  and  may  be 
subject to extensions with mutual consent of all the parties in writing. The location of the services 
is at Angkor Borei district of Takeo province in Cambodia. 
Scope of Services 
30. 
Technical  assistance  services  include  i)  feasibility  study  and  planning  visits,  ii)  farmer 
training at the beginning of the project with the goal of providing knowledge and skills to build the 
systems to operate and maintain the hatcheries, and iii) local trainings and demonstration to local 
farmers in Angkor Borei to provide skills to the farmers so that they can grow prawn successfully 
after purchasing larvae/seed/fingerlings from the two selected hatcheries to be supported by the 
project. 
Detailed Outputs of the assignment

Table 5 presents the key assignment milestones and indicative timeline. AIT’s contract, 
covering  remunerations,  per  diem  and  travel  expenses,  is  $65,664  Cost  of  the  supporting 
equipment for the hatcheries and prawn farm is estimated to be $68,100 and will procured by the 
project. Detailed cost plan, including equipment for the hatcheries, is attached in Appendix A.

significant heritage sites of Preah Vihear Temple and Phnom Da Temple. The project has three 
components,  including  (i)  capacity  building  for  local  communities  to  provide  improved  tourist 
services and products; (ii) tourism and agricultural livelihood improvements; and (iii) provision of 
infrastructure and equipment to support tourism operations and high-value agriculture. The project 
will improve sanitation and potable water supply and promote good public hygiene, to the benefits 
of both residents and tourists. The project is executed by the Civil Society Alliance Forum (CSAF) 
under  the  Councils  of  Ministers  with  financial  support  from  Japan  Fund  for  Prosperous  and 
Resilient Asia and the Pacific (JFPR) under Administration of Asian Development Bank (ADB). 
The project is expected to be implemented from 2022 to 2026. 
Scope of Assignment 
The CSAF now invites Expressions of Interest (EOI) from national marketing firms, bidding 
33. 
either individually or jointly with partners, to develop and implement a CBT support package for 
the 2 project sites in Decho Thamacheat village of Choam Khsant district and Angkor Borei district 
in Takeo province. The assignment is scheduled for implementation in early Q1 2022 to provide 
support  to  local  communities  establish,  develop  and  implement  operational  and  financially 
sustainable  CBTs.  The  CBTs  will  help  drive  economic  recovery  for  the  tourism  sector  in  both 
project  areas,  which  continue  experiencing  significant  financial  hardship  due  to  the  escalating 
worldwide  COVID-19  pandemic.  The  assignment  is  linked  to  Output  1  “Local  Capacity  for

will be financed from the proceeds of the JFPR grant. The advance account shall be denominated 
in US dollars. 
 Delegation of Authority for Withdrawal Applications. The Government delegates full 
3. 
authority to the EA to countersign all applications for withdrawal of the JFPR Funds and to receive 
payment  for  all  JFPR  Funds.  Such funds shall  be  deposited  directly  into the  advance  account 
opened by MEF then delegated to the EA. 
4. 
 All WAs submitted by the EA shall be signed by duly authorized persons. At the start of 
project  implementation,  the  EA  shall  furnish  to  ADB  the  names  and  titles  of  the  authorized 
signatories together with their authenticated specimen signatures. 
5. 
Initial  Advance  and  Ceiling.  Before  applying  for  the  initial  deposit  into  the  advance 
account, the EA will submit, for ADB approval a work plan and budget for the first six months of 
project  implementation.  When  applying  for  the  initial  deposit,  the  EA  needs  to  prepare  a 
withdrawal  application  form)  including  an  estimated  expenditure  sheet  for  the  next  six  months 
(refer to Appendix 7A of the LDH for the sample). Upon evidence satisfactory to ADB that the 
advance account has been opened, JFPR funds will be deposited to the advance account in the 
amount of 10% of the grant amount or six months estimated expenditures,  whichever is lower, 
and will be regarded as a ceiling for replenishment purposes. This ceiling may be changed by the 
mutual agreement between ADB and the EA. 
6. 
Replenishment  and  Liquidation.  To  avoid  disruption  in  the  project's  implementation 
schedule, application for replenishment of the advance account is to be lodged before the account 
balance reaches no less than one month equivalent of project expenditures. When applying for 
replenishment, the EA needs to submit a withdrawal application with statements of expenditure 
attached  together  with  supporting  documents  deemed  necessary  and  other  evidence  as  ADB 
shall reasonably request and showing that each payment was made for eligible expenditures. Any 
individual payment to be reimbursed or liquidated/replenished under the Statement of Expenditure 
(SOE) procedure shall not exceed the equivalent of $30,000.  
7. 
The EA shall also submit together with the withdrawal applications the bank statement of the 
advance  account.  Details  of  advance  account  deposit  and  debit  entries  should  be  shown  on  the 
statement.  
8. 
Accounts and Records. The EA shall ensure that all amounts received for or in connection

with the advance account and amounts withdrawn are recorded in separate books in accordance with 
the  government  accounting  standards.  Upon  receipt  of  monthly  bank  statements,  the  EA  should 
reconcile its records against the bank statements and follow-up on any unreconciled entries. The EA 
shall retain until one year following receipt by ADB of the final APFS or two years after the loan closing 
date (whichever is later), all accounts and records including orders, invoices, bills, receipts and other 
original documents evidencing the expenditures paid out of the advance account and shall enable 
ADB's  representatives  to  examine  such  accounts  and  records  during  disbursements  and  review 
missions. 
9. 
 On  a  quarterly  basis,  the  EA  will  prepare  a  physical  progress  report  and  report  of  project 
expenditures and the quarterly project expenditures. ADB will reserve the right not to replenish the 
advance account if ADB has not received the latest quarterly report of the project within 30 days of 
the end of each quarter.  
10. 
 The EA shall cause an adequate independent auditor or government auditor acceptable to 
ADB to periodically audit the advance account above and furnish the audit report thereon to ADB not 
later than 6 months after the end of each fiscal year. 
11. 
 Ineligible  or  Unjustified  Payment.  Where  any  withdrawal  or  payment  from  the  advance 
account is determined by ADB to have been utilized for any purposes not eligible, or not justified by 
the evidence furnished, the EA shall promptly upon notice from ADB and unless otherwise agreed by 
ADB, return to the advance account the amount equal to the amount of such ineligible or unjustified 
payment.  Payment shall be made in the same currency as that in which the amount was withdrawn 
from the JFPR account. Alternatively, ADB may offset the unjustified payment against new withdrawal 
application for reimbursement.  
12. 
 Closing of the Advance Account. Upon determination that the project components to be 
financed with payments from the advance account are near completion, ADB may reduce the amount 
of  any  replenishment  as  ADB  may  deem  appropriate  with  a  view  towards  gradually  closing  the 
advance account. 
13. 
 In the event that (a) ADB determines that the amount outstanding in the advance account will 
not be required to cover eligible expenditures, or (b) any amount remains outstanding in the advance 
account after the closing date specified in the JFPR Agreement, the EA shall, promptly upon notice 
from ADB, and unless otherwise agreed by ADB, refund to ADB such amount then outstanding in the 
advance account. Any foreign exchange  loss during the closing of account can be finance by the 
project subject to fund availability. 
II. 
DISBURSEMENT MODALITIES 
A. 
Four Major Types  
14. 
Disbursement procedures consist of four major types, described briefly as the:  
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
direct  payment  procedure  where  ADB,  at  the  borrower’s  request,  pays  a 
designated beneficiary directly (see chapter 7 of the LDH for details);  
commitment  procedure  where  ADB,  at  the  borrower’s  request,  provides  an 
irrevocable undertaking to reimburse a commercial bank for payments made or to 
be made to a supplier against an LC financed from the grant account (see chapter 
8 of LDH for details);  
reimbursement  procedure  where  ADB  pays  from  the  grant  account  to  the 
recipient’s  account  or,  in  some  cases,  to  the  project  account  for  eligible 
expenditures which have been incurred and paid for by the project out of its budget 
allocation or its own resources (see chapter 9 of LDH for details); and  
90 
Appendix 6 
(iv) 
advance fund  procedure  where ADB makes  an advance disbursement from the 
grant account for deposit to an advance account to be used exclusively for ADB’s 
share of eligible expenditures (see chapter 10 of LDH for details).  
B. 
Simplified Documentation under the Reimbursement Procedure  
15.  While  normally  ADB  requires  submission  of  full  supporting  documentation,  there  are 
special cases where it accepts simplified documentation when:  
(i) 
(ii) 
the statement of expenditures (SOE) procedure involves the recipient submitting 
an SOE to support an application (see paragraphs 9.8 to 9.22 of LDH for details);  
the  force  account  works  procedure  involves  the  recipient  submitting  periodic 
certification of the progress or completion of civil works in support of its application 
for reimbursement (see paragraphs 9.23 to 9.26 of LDH for details); and  
C. 
Suggested Disbursement Procedures 
16. 
The four procedures are normally used for the following kinds of payment:  
Nature of Payment/s 
Mainly large civil works, 
progress payments, consultants’ 
fees, procurement of goods  
Importation costs  
Local currency costs, petty 
purchases, and small civil works  
Contractors’ bills and suppliers’ 
invoices, numerous items of 
operating expenses, other 
eligible expenditures  
Precondition for Payment 
Suggested Procedure 
Payments are due  
Direct payment

Appendix 7 
14. 
Indicator 2.a: Tourism-related and high-value agriculture livelihoods provided to at 
least 200 individuals. The project will support different high-value agriculture livelihoods such as 
cucumber,  longbean,  watermelon,  jasmine  and  herb,  chicken,  tilapia  and  freshwater  prawn  as 
well as homestay. Throughout the project, there will be 20 farmers for cucumber and long-bean, 
20 farmers for watermelon, 20 farmers for jasmine and herbs, 40 farmers for chicken, 20 farmers 
for  tilapia,  20  farmers  for  freshwater  prawn,  4  farmers  for  chick  producers  and  2  private 
progressive  farmers  for  prawn  hatcheries.  Furthermore,  the  project  will  equip  10  farmers  with 
homestay  development  equipment  and  provide  capacity  building  and  ongoing  support  to  20 
farmers  for  enterprise  development,  marketing  and  promotion.  The  project  will  support  the 
provision  of  climate  resilient  as  well  as  gender  sensitive  equipment  and  materials  to  selected 
farmers  to  improve  their  productions  together  with  series  of  capacity  building  on  Participatory 
Guarantee System (PGS) standard for agriculture. Specifically, for the prawn hatchery, the project 
will  co-support  and build on farmers  existing  resources to  set  up  the  community  hatchery  with 
technical  assistance  from  AIT.  Lastly,  poor  female  farmers  will  be  supported  for  homestay 
development with equipment allocation under the project fund.
