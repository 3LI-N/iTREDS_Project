Project Administration Manual Purpose and Process 
1.  The  project  administration  manual  (PAM)  describes  the  essential  administrative  and 
management requirements to implement the project on time, within budget, and in accordance 
with the policies and procedures of the government and Asian Development Bank (ADB). The 
PAM should include references to all available templates and instructions either through linkages 
to relevant URLs or directly incorporated in the PAM. 
2.  The  Government  of  Tamil  Nadu  (the  state  government),  acting  through  its Water  Resources 
Department (WRD) (the executing agency) is wholly responsible for the implementation of the  
project,  as  agreed  jointly  between  India  as  the  borrower  and  ADB,  and  in  accordance  with 
Government  and  ADB’s  policies  and  procedures.  ADB  staff  is  responsible  to  support 
implementation  including  compliance  by  the  the  executing  agency  of  their  obligations  and 
responsibilities for project implementation in accordance with ADB’s policies and procedures. 
3.  At Loan Negotiations the borrower, State, WRD, and ADB shall agree to the PAM and ensure 
consistency with the Loan Agreement. Such agreement shall be reflected in the minutes of the 
Loan Negotiations. In the event of any discrepancy or contradiction between the PAM and the 
Loan Agreement, the provisions of the Loan Agreement shall prevail. 
4.   
After  ADB  Board  approval  of  the  project's  report  and  recommendations  of  the  President, 
changes in implementation arrangements are subject to agreement and approval pursuant to 
relevant government and ADB administrative procedures (including the Project Administration 
Instructions) and upon such approval, they will be subsequently incorporated in the PAM. 
A. 
Rationale 
PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
Tamil Nadu is one of the most water-stressed states in India, with a per capita availability 
1. 
of water resources of 900 cubic meters per year (m3/year) compared with a national average of 
1,545 m3/year and a water stress threshold of 1,700 m3/year.1 The mean annual rainfall is 912 
millimeters, of which 48% comes from the erratic northeast monsoon (October to December) and 
32% from  the southwest monsoon  (June to  September). Of the  17 major  river  basins  in Tamil 
Nadu, the Cauvery Basin is the largest. The Cauvery River flows through the states of Karnataka, 
Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and the Karaikal enclave of the Union Territory of Puducherry. Around 54% 
of its catchment area lies within Tamil Nadu.  
2. 
The Cauvery delta lies on the east coast of Tamil Nadu and is referred to as the “rice bowl 
of  Tamil  Nadu.”  About  73%  of  the  delta’s  population  of  4.8  million  is  engaged  in  farming  and 
fishing,  and  is  dependent  on  water  resources  for  their  livelihoods.  However,  the  availability  of 
water  resources  in  the  delta  is  unreliable  and  flooding  is  common  during  the  erratic  northeast 
monsoon. District Revenue Department records estimate damage caused by floods in 2004–2013 
at  $70.4  million.  Meanwhile,  climate  change  projections  indicate  an  intensification  of  floods  as 
rainfall increases during the monsoon and sea levels rise. Storm rainfall is predicted to increase 
by 19%. In coastal areas, flooding will increase because sea levels are projected to rise from 0.29 
meters (low scenario) to 0.87 meters (high scenario) by 2100, compared with a 1990 baseline.2 
Rising temperatures will increase crop water demand and evaporative losses. By 2050, maximum 
temperatures  will  rise  by  1.0°C–1.5°C,  according  to  climate  projections,  and  minimum 
temperatures  will  increase  by  a  larger  2.0°C–3.0°C.3  The  climate  models  demonstrate  drier 
conditions from January to May.  
3. 
The sharing of Cauvery waters among the states has been disputed since the 1890s, and 
in  February  2013,  the  Supreme  Court  of  India  upheld  the  water  allocation  decision  that  the 
Cauvery  Waters  Dispute  Tribunal  had  made  in  2007.  Tamil  Nadu  was  allocated  58%  of  the 
surface water resources of the basin. Despite high levels of water stress, recurrent flooding, and 
increasing  risks  of  climate  change,  the  long-standing  dispute  prevented  investments  toward 
improving  the  irrigation  and  drainage  systems  in  the  delta  beyond  essential  maintenance. 
Therefore, the irrigation and drainage systems are dilapidated and unable to effectively convey 
irrigation  and  floodwaters.  This  led  to  inequitable  distribution  of  irrigation  water,  with  upstream 
farmers  benefiting,  and  increased  flooding  due  to  overtopping  or  breaching  of  embankments. 
Some  of  the  tail-end  areas  no  longer  have  access  to  irrigation  water.  Malfunctioning  tail-end 
regulators  led  to  seawater  ingress  along  channels.  In  the  lower  reaches  of  the  delta,  the 
availability  of fresh groundwater  is  limited  as a result  of  variable recharge  and saline  aquifers. 
Communities along the lower coastal reaches of the delta are particularly disadvantaged since 
they have access to neither fresh groundwater nor fresh surface water. This  negatively affects 
the agricultural production in the area. In 2012, because of a poor southwest monsoon, the paddy 
production in the Cauvery delta was only 825,500 tons—compared with an annual average of 1.6 
million tons in 2009–2014. Climate change is expected to exacerbate such vulnerabilities, so the 
need to upgrade the infrastructure is urgent, as is better water management to meet the present 
and future needs.

4. 
At the field level, water use is generally inefficient because of high distribution and field 
losses,  low  priority  given  to  water  conservation,  and  highly  consumptive  crops.  Rising 
temperatures and uncertainties related to future rainfall demonstrate a need for stronger water 
management. It is essential to support the information systems with robust monitoring networks, 
good  data  archiving,  and  an  interface  to  enable  better  decision-making  in  water  resource 
management. 
Following  the  2013  Supreme  Court  decision,  the Water  Resources  Department  (WRD) 
5. 
within  the  Public  Works  Department  prepared  the  Cauvery  Modernization  Proposal,  which 
includes  the  rehabilitation  of  most  of  the  flood  control  and  irrigation  infrastructure,  and 
improvements  to  on-farm  irrigation  systems  in  the  Cauvery  delta.4  The  four  main  irrigation 
systems in the delta are Lower Coleroon Anicut, Cauvery, Vennar, and Grand Anicut. Of the four, 
the Vennar system is considered to be the most critical in terms of vulnerability to flooding and in 
need of improvements. 
The  Vennar  System.  Irrigation  to  the  delta  is  supplied  from  the  Cauvery  River  at  the 
6. 
Grand  Anicut,  where  the  Cauvery  River  bifurcates  into  Cauvery  and  Vennar.  The  irrigation 
systems in the delta have evolved over centuries, whereby natural rivers were adapted to serve 
as irrigation canals and drains. The result is a complex network of natural and built canals and 
drains. Most of the regulatory structures in the Vennar system are more than 100 years old and 
some are fully dilapidated. Shoals formed in the center of the channels hinder  the free flow of 
water, and some tail-end command areas no longer receive surface water. Existing embankments 
are damaged or weak. At the operational level, water distribution is not systematic and is based 
mainly on the judgment of WRD staff in response to requests from farmers. At the farm level, the 
application of irrigation water is inherently inefficient.  
7. 
The Government of Tamil Nadu has requested Asian Development Bank (ADB) financing 
to  upgrade  the  Vennar  system.  On-farm  irrigation  systems  will  be  improved  through  another 
project to be financed by the state government and other development partners. The proposed 
project is consistent with ADB’s country partnership strategy, 2013–2017 for India,5 which seeks 
to  overcome  water  insecurity  and  help  communities  adapt  to  climate  change,  and  to  promote 
efficient and sustainable water management in agriculture. The proposed project is aligned with 
the  aims  of  the  Government  of  India’s  National  Water  Policy,6  Twelfth  Five  Year  Plan,7  and 
National Water Mission.8 The project is also consistent with the state government’s Twelfth Five 
Year Plan, 2012–2017,9 which includes improving water use efficiency by modernizing irrigation 
systems and bolstering service delivery. The project is aligned with ADB’s strategic and sector 
goals  as  articulated  in  (i)  ADB’s  Strategy  2020  and  its  midterm  review;10  (ii) the  Water  for  All

Disaster Risk Management, 2014–2020.13 They all aim to reduce the water demand–supply gap 
in water-scarce areas, foster integrated water resource management, improve water governance 
and delivery of services, improve resilience to climate change, integrate disaster risk reduction in 
development,  and  reinforce  the  intersection  between  disaster  risk  management  and  climate 
change adaptation. 
B.

from the main channels; (v) upgrading 20 bed dams and grade walls within the main channels; 
(vi)  upgrading  136  other  minor  irrigation  and  drainage  structures;  and  (vii) upgrading  13  pump 
stations through new pumps and electrical systems and repairs to pump houses. 
11. 
Output  2:  Improved  water  and  flood  risk  management  systems  established.  This 
output will deliver nonstructural interventions designed to (i) improve decision-making on water 
resources, and (ii) manage flood risks and flood events. Initiatives to be developed under item (i) 
are:  (a)  greater  participation  by  stakeholders  in  the  planning  and  delivery  of  water  services 
through the formation of channel stakeholder groups; (b) better assessment of water resources 
through the installation of additional equipment to monitor and measure rainfall, surface water, 
groundwater,  tide  levels  and  flows;  (c)  development  of  a  decision  support  system  that  would 
provide system status information and enable more accurate water allocation planning and more 
effective asset management; and (d) training for WRD officers on more effective management of 
water resources. Flood risks and flood events will be managed by (i) installing flood forecasting 
and warning systems, and (ii) mapping flood risks. The output also includes a feasibility study,

16 The straight cuts allow the floodwaters of the three channels that fall into the Vedharanyam canal to be discharged 
directly  to  the  sea,  instead  of  flowing  through  the  Vedharanyam  canal,  which  cannot  fully  drain  the  combined 
floodwaters.

and  the  detailed  design  of  similar  improvements  in  the  remainder  of  the  Vennar  and  Cauvery 
systems that may be financed under a subsequent project. 
a. 
Improved decision making on water resources 
12. 
Initiatives to be developed are: (i) greater participation by stakeholders in the planning and 
delivery  of  water  services  through  the  formation  of  informal  channel  stakeholder  groups;  (ii) 
improved assessment of water resources through installation of additional rainfall, surface water 
level, groundwater level, tide level monitoring, and flow measurement sites, (iii) development of a 
Decision  Support  System  (DSS)  which  would  provide  system  status  information,  enable 
enhanced water allocation planning and facilitate improved asset management, and (v) training 
for Water Resources Department officers in improved management of water resources. 
i. 
Participation 
13. 
Channel  level  stakeholder  groups  will  be  established  for  the  six  channels  where 
infrastructure improvements will be made. Stakeholder groups will be created in the Pandavaiyar, 
Vellaiyar, Harichandra nadhi, Vedharanyam, Adappar and Valavanar channels.  
14. 
The  membership  of  each  stakeholder  group  will  include  officials  from  the  District 
Departments  (WRD,  Agriculture,  Fisheries,  district  revenue  office,  and  Environment)  and 
representatives of the farmer communities and elected representatives of the area.  
15. 
Each stakeholder group will have 5 government officials and a minimum of 15 farmers of 
the region, comprising of not less than 3 women (if participation of active women land owners is 
not  feasible,  then  women  from  farming  families  will  be  included),  and  representatives  from 
marginal  farmers,  small  farmers,  and  large  farmers.  The  district  revenue  officer  will  act  as  the 
group’s Chairperson. The two vice-chairpersons will be (i) one farmer representative nominated 
through  consensus  from  among  the  member-farmers  and  (ii)  an  official  from  department  of 
agriculture. The farmer representative will  hold  office for  a  period  of  one year  by  rotation. The 
assistant  executive  engineer  (AEE),  WRD  from  the  division  concerned  will  be  the  member 
secretary, who will be responsible to convene the group and forward the decisions of the group 
to higher authorities for necessary actions. 
16. 
The principal objectives of the channel stakeholder groups will be to (i) discuss progress 
of the project, identify issues and suggest remedial actions, (ii) propose quantities and timings of 
normal surface water flows down the channel for irrigation to maximize productivity and equity of 
water distribution and minimize waste, (iii) recommend the use of water resources in each channel 
catchment during times of water shortage to minimize crop losses, (iv) coordinate local responses 
during floods, and (v) identify maintenance works required. 
The channel stakeholder groups will meet at least four times between June and January 
17. 
each growing season and twice during construction season.  
ii. 
Improved assessment of water resources 
18. 
A network of digital telemetric rainfall, river, groundwater and tide monitoring stations will 
be installed in the Vennar system with connectivity to the DSS. The rainfall and river monitoring 
stations will be installed at selected head, cross and tail-end regulators. The groundwater stations 
will be located at existing observation wells. The stations will capture and store data digitally and 
5 
transmit  at  regular  intervals  to  the  appropriate  databases  in  the  DSS.  Details  of  the  DSS  are 
provided in Appendix B. 
19. 
From the DSS, the data are available on demand to WRD engineers for the assessment 
of current flows in the channel and water levels in the aquifers and comparison with the current 
irrigation requirements in the command areas associated with the channel.  This would enable 
adjusting  surface  water  deliveries  from  head  works  to  farm  off  takes  to  meet  actual  needs 
considering groundwater availability and recent rainfall. 
20. 
A program of direct flow measurements at each regulator using flow meters will verify the 
theoretical stage-discharge ratings of the regulators or replace them with more accurate empirical 
ratings  covers  all  flow  conditions.  The  flow  meters  will  be  portable  Acoustic  Doppler  Current 
Profilers which will provide accurate direct measurements of discharge. Improved ratings for the 
regulators will increase the accuracy of assessments of surface water availability in the system. 
iii. 
Decision Support System 
21. 
A  simple  DSS  comprising  surface  water  and  groundwater  databases  containing 
hydrometeorological,  hydrological  and  hydrogeological  data,  and  irrigation  command  area 
(ayacut) information will be developed in the Vennar system. This DSS will be accessible to WRD 
staff through a user-friendly computer interface allowing them to inspect up-to-date river levels, 
flows, water demands in the catchments and their associated ayacuts and to adjust surface water 
deliveries to actual needs considering groundwater availability and recent rainfall. The DSS will 
also  incorporate  an  asset  management  component  to  enable  improved  monitoring  of 
infrastructure condition, repair requirements, and maintenance scheduling. 
iv. 
Capacity development  
Capacity development initiatives will include on the job training and organized training for 
22. 
WRD officers and training for farmers on improved agricultural practices. Refer Appendix E for 
details of the training program. 
b. 
Improved Management of Flood Risks and Flood Events 
Improved  management  of 
23. 
flood  events  and  risks  will  be  delivered 
(i) establishment of flood forecasting and warning systems, and (ii) flood risk mapping. 
through: 
i. 
Flood forecasting and warning systems 
24. 
The network of digital telemetric rainfall, river, groundwater and tide monitoring stations to 
be installed to provide real time data for water resources monitoring purposes (see paragraph 18) 
will also serve to detect, forecast, warn and monitor flood conditions. 
25. 
Flood forecasting and warning systems will be developed for each channel using water 
level triggers derived from (i) statistical correlations and travel times between monitoring sites and 
flood zones, (ii) hydraulic models of the catchments that forecast water levels in the flood zones 
from  observed  or  forecast  rainfall,  and  (iii)  rainfall  depth,  area  and  duration  curves  for  the 
catchments etc.  
26.  Water level triggers at key regulators that correspond to critical water levels and incipient 
overtopping  in downstream flood  zones  will  be  determined from  analysis  of  existing  river  level 
data and the known onset of flood conditions. Flood forecast and flood warning triggers will be 
6 
programmed into the DSS so that WRD decision makers can be alerted to the risk of flooding and 
the  potential  need  to  issue  targeted  flood  warnings  through  the  District  Disaster  Management 
Authorities and District Collectors offices to the public and mobilize emergency services to the 
most vulnerable locations. 
ii. 
Flood risk mapping 
This will include updating of flood risk maps17 and post flood mapping and surveys. Except 
27. 
for the inspections of structures and embankments, that are carried out by WRD immediately after 
floods or as part of routine annual asset management surveys, no formal records are kept of the 
impacts of flooding, specifically the physical extent and duration of flooding. Such information is 
invaluable in assessing flood risk and in designing interventions to mitigate those risks. 
28. 
To  collect  this  additional  data,  the  scope  of  the  post-flood  surveys  by  WRD  will  be 
expanded to include the extent, depth, duration, velocity and direction of flow on the flood plains. 
This information will be used by WRD modelers to increase the understanding of flood frequency 
and refine and extend the configuration and calibration of the flood models, flood warning systems 
and flood risk maps produced. WRD staff will be trained to undertake such surveys and update 
flood maps. 
The  flood  maps  will  be  used  by  WRD  to  (i)  refine  the  flood  forecasting  and  warning 
29. 
systems by developing geographically targeted forecasts and warnings which will assist DDMAs 
to deploy emergency services accurately and efficiently, (ii) identify high risk areas which require 
additional flood mitigation measures, and (iii) support flood disaster planning by the DDMAs.  
17 Flood risk maps for 25, 50 and 100 year return floods with and without climate change were prepared under the 
project preparatory technical assistance

The funds for this project will be provided by the state government which will undertake 
the financing of this project along with the other projects as part of annual budgetary allocation 
and claim reimbursement from ADB for the eligible expenditure after deducting the share of state 
government. The fund flow arrangements for the project will be on reimbursement basis from the 
ADB loan proceeds. Detailed movement of funds is summarized in the diagram below (Figure 4).

Financial Management Assessment 
FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT 
The  Financial  Management  Assessment  (FMA)  of  the  Water  Resources  Department 
37. 
(WRD)  of  The  state  government,  the  proposed  EA,  was  carried  out  in  respect  of  its  current 
activities  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  Guidelines  for  the  Financial  Management  and  Analysis  of 
Projects (2005) (the Guidelines) and the publication Financial Due Diligence A Methodology Note 
(2009). The FMA considered the capacity of WRD including funds-flow arrangements, staffing, 
accounting  and  financial  reporting  systems,  financial  information  systems,  and  internal  and 
external auditing arrangements. Based on the assessment, the key financial management risks 
identified are: (i) lack of internal audit function, (ii) expected delays in submission of the audited 
project financial statements and (iii) additional financial management staff required. It is concluded 
that  the  overall  pre-mitigation  financial  management  risk  is  moderate.  WRD  have  agreed  to 
implement an action plan as key measures to address the deficiencies. The financial management 
action plan is provided in Table 13 below.

This assessment borrowed from previous financial management assessments including a 
recent country public sector financial management system assessment for India.18 In addition, a 
detailed  Financial  Management  and  Analysis  Questionnaire (FMAQ)  was completed based  on 
document reviews and interviews  with the Chief Engineer, Trichy, Divisional Accountant at the 
offices  of  the  Executive  Engineer’s  Offices  at  Thiruvarur  (one  of  the  proposed  Project 
Implementing  Units  under  the  project)  and  the  Irrigated  Agriculture  Modernization  and  Water 
Bodies Restoration and Management (IAMWARM) multi-disciplinary Project Unit at Chennai. A 
review of some transactions undertaken during the previous year and monthly accounts submitted 
to  the  Accountant  General’s  Offices  was  conducted  to  understand  the  process  of  receipt  and 
disbursement of funds, certification of works/invoices for goods and services. The findings from 
this assessment were considered while drawing up the financial management arrangements and 
oversight for the project.  
39. 
The assessment indicates that, although the overall risk is assessed as  moderate, with 
the proposed mitigating measures the financial management arrangements of WRD are adequate 
to implement the project:

Conclusions 
WRD  and  the  state  government  have  undertaken 
various  other  multilateral  agencies  projects  mainly 
through the reimbursement method of seeking funds.  
The  overall  allocation  for  the  project  is  carried  out 
through the annual allocation of Budgetary resources. 
Based  on  past  experience  in  the  other  multilateral 
agency  funded  projects  there  is  no  risk/concern  on 
providing counterpart resources 
The present staff at the WRD are qualified and trained 
to  undertake  the  accounting  function.  There  are 
enough  resources  at  the  execution  and  supervisory 
levels  to  maintain  adequate  internal  controls  and 
segregation  of  duties.  The  head  of  accounting 
function  is  deputed  from  the  Principal  Accountant 
General’s  office  maintaining 
independence  of 
accounting  function.  However  the  staff  at  the  EEs 
offices which were subject to review are not trained to 
handle the reimbursement procedures of CAAA and 
ADB. To address this WRD shall organise to take on 
deputation, resources from the Project Management 
Unit  of  IAMWARM  project  (a  World  Bank  funded 
project  which  will  close  in  June  2015)  or  train  their 
staff on reimbursement procedure of ADB. 
Government Accounting System is being followed by 
WRD and includes maintenance of books of accounts 
on a cash basis of accounting and the overall financial 
finance  and 
management 
accounting  procedures  as  has  been  done 
in 
implementing  other  externally  aided  projects  in  the 
recent past. There is a centrally established chart of 
accounts at Pan India level which is followed by WRD 
leading  to  an  effective  consolidation  of  the  overall 
financial  results.  The  present  staff  at  the  project 
implementation/monitoring unit level is not trained to 
provide project financial statements required by ADB. 
WRD  shall  undertake  to  get  such  resources  on 
deputation  from  IAMWRM  project  or  train  their 
personnel at PMU by IAMWARM project staff 
An  assessment  of  the  budgetary  allocations  for 
activities of WRD in the past few  years   indicate  an  
increase  in  funding  and  dovetailing  of  funds  from 
Central  schemes,  multilateral  agencies,  to  integrate 
and  enhance  the  interventions  envisaged  by  WRD 
towards 
active 
engagement in the field. The policies and procedure 
of  budgeting  for  the  Project  would  involve  adequate 
annual  budget  allocations  by  the  State  Government 
for 
the  Project  Finance 
Components  under  the  designated  project  specific 
budget  heads.  There  is  an  effective  monitoring 
system during the year to measure the performance 
against the budget and take corrective action.

Project plans and budgets are generally realistic as it 
goes through vigorous checks from the technical and 
planning departments before it gets adopted into the 
budget.  The  state  has  committed  to  allocate  a 
minimum  of  2%  of  capital  expenditure  towards 
operation and maintenance. 
There is no internal audit function at WRD. A private 
audit  firm  shall  be  engaged  by  WRD  to  undertake 
internal audit of the project.  
The Statutory audit of Government of Tamil Nadu is 
conducted  by  the  Comptroller  and  Auditor  General 
(C&AG) of India through their offices in Chennai which 
includes annual and propriety audits. The C&AG is a 
constitutional  body  and  are  independent  of  the 
Executive.  WRD  will  have  to  strengthen  its  staff 
strength  by  bringing  people  on  deputation  from  the 
IAMWARM  project  to  ensure  that  audited  project 
financial  statements  are  available  within  180  days 
from  the  date  of  completion  of  relevant  accounting 
year. The latest audit report for FY 2012-13 on GOTN 
state Finances does not indicate any specific issues 
relating to WRD, although in general there is delay in 
provision of Utilisation Certificates for audit 
All accounting records and supporting documents are 
retained by the project implementation units to allow 
proper  and  effective  external  audit.  Monthly  reports 
are  generated  by  the  project  implementation  units 
manually  and  sent  to  the  controlling  authorities  for 
monitoring.  
The primary accounting records are maintained in a 
manual system at the project implementation units. A 
summary of the said manual records are transferred 
physically  on  a  monthly  basis  to  the  central  agency 
(Principal  Accountant  General’s 
for 
maintenance of accounting records. The  accounting 
at the central agency is maintained in a computerized 
system. As a result of the above, there is a time lag in 
the maintenance of accounting records and a need to 
reconcile  the  manual  and  computerized  accounting 
records. WRD is in the process of computerizing the 
system under a World Bank funded project.

 Staffing:  The  PMU  will  be  staffed  with  a  divisional  accountant,  with  the  requisite 
experience and qualifications, who will be assigned with the responsibility for oversight of financial 
management  of  the  project  during  implementation.  It  is  also  proposed  that  the  divisional 
accountants at the PIU’s will report to the divisional accountant who will  be responsible for the 
following activities: (i) coordination of all financial management requirements of the  project, (ii) 
preparation  of  project  financial  statements  (iii)  preparing  financial  progress  and  monitoring 
reports, (iii) follow up with the State Finance Department for the release of funds, (iv) preparation

the MDPU of IAMWARM project as they have prior experience in handling the requirements of 
multilateral  funding  agencies  or  have  PMU  staff  trained  by  IAMWARM  staff.  The  day  to  day 
accounting function at the PIUs will be conducted by the existing divisional accountants and his 
staff. 
Budget Line Item in the State Government Budget: The project will be pre-financed by 
41. 
the Government of Tamil Nadu through a dedicated budget head, separately identifiable line item 
under the Major Head no. DPC 4701 – 03 – 434 – PA – 1604 for the ADB project in the Demand 
for Grants of the State Water Resources Department (WRD). Funds allocated under this budget 
head for the Financial Year 2015-16 are based on the projected expenditure for the project for 
2015-16. This budget head will be distinct from other budget lines under this Major Head. This 
exercise of establishment of a distinct budget head was initiated as part of the budget exercise 
for the current financial year which commenced in mid 2014 for the Financial Year 2015-16. The 
budget submitted shall include both ADB’s share and counterpart (State) contribution agreed to 
finance  approved  activities  planned  under  the  project.  Upon  approval  of  budget  by  the  State 
legislature, the State Finance Department would release funds under this subhead to the project 
management  to  allow  these  agencies  to  effect  need  based  draw  down  of  funds  to  finance 
approved project activities.

Disbursement  of  loan  proceeds  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  Loan  Disbursement 
Handbook (2015, as amended from time to time)19 and the detailed arrangements agreed upon 
between  the  government  and  ADB.  Training  for  project  staff  on  disbursement  policies  and 
procedures is available online.20 PMU and PIU staff are encouraged to avail of this training to help 
ensure efficient disbursement and fiduciary control. 
Before  the  submission  of  the  first  withdrawal  application,  the  state  government  should

Statement  of  Expenditure  Procedure  (SOE):  The  Statement  of  Expenditure  (SOE) 
procedure will be used to reimburse eligible expenditures. The ceiling of the SOE procedure is 
the  equivalent  of  $100,000  per  individual  payment.  Supporting  documents  and  records for  the 
expenditures claimed under the SOE should be maintained and made readily available for review 
by ADB’s disbursement and review missions, upon ADB’s request for submission of supporting 
documents on a sampling basis, and for independent audit.

Accounting 
46.  WRD  will  maintain  separate  project  accounts  and  records  by  funding  source  for  all 
expenditures incurred on the project. Project financial statements will follow the government of 
India’s  cash  based  accounting  laws  and  regulations  which  are  consistent  with  international 
accounting principles and practices. Template financial statements provided in the Standardized 
Terms of Reference for audit of ADB assisted projects, agreed with the Comptroller and Auditor 
General  of  India,  the  DEA  and  ADB  can  be  referred  to  as  a  guide  for  preparing  financial 
statements. 
D. 
Auditing and Public Disclosure 
47.  WRD  will  cause  the  project  financial  statements  to  be  audited  in  accordance  with 
International Standards on Auditing and/or in accordance with Government's audit regulations, by 
the  CAG  or  any  private  external  auditor  empanelled  and  assigned  to  the  audit  by  the  CAG, 
acceptable  to  ADB.  The  audited  project  financial  statements  will  be  submitted  in  the  English 
language to ADB within six months of the end of the fiscal year by WRD. 
48. 
The  annual  audit  report  for  the  project  financial  statements  will  include  audit  opinions 
which  cover:  (i)  whether  the  project  financial  statements  present  a  true  and  fair  view  or  are 
presented  fairly,  in  all  material  respects,  in  accordance  with  the  applicable  financial  reporting 
framework; (ii) whether loan proceeds were used only for the purposes of the project or not; and 
(iii)  the  level  of  compliance  for  financial  covenants  contained  in  the  legal  agreements  for  the 
project. If the auditor issues a management letter, a copy will also be submitted to ADB. 
49. 
Compliance with financial reporting and auditing requirements will be monitored by review 
missions  and  during  normal  project  supervision,  and  followed  up  regularly  with  all  concerned, 
including the external auditor.  
50. 
The  Government  and  WRD  have  been  made  aware  of  ADB’s  approach  to  delayed 
submission,21  and  the  requirements  for  satisfactory  and  acceptable  quality  of  the  audited 
accounts. ADB reserves the right to verify the project's financial accounts to confirm that the share 
of ADB’s financing is used in accordance with ADB’s policies and procedures.  
51. 
Public  disclosure  of  the  project  financial  statements,  including  the  audit  report  on  the 
project financial statements, will be guided by ADB’s Public Communications Policy (2011).22 After 
review, ADB will disclose the project financial statements for the project and the opinion of the 
auditors on the financial statements within 14 days of their endorsement by posting them on ADB’s 
website. The management letter will not be disclosed.  
21 ADB approach and procedure for delayed submission of audited project financial statements: 
  When audited project financial statements are not received by the due date, ADB will write to the executing 
agency advising that (i) the audit documents are overdue; and (ii) if they are not received within the next six 
months, requests for new contract awards and disbursement such as processing of new reimbursement, and 
issuance of new commitment letters will not be processed. 
  When audited project financial statements have not been received within  6 months after the due date, ADB 
will withhold processing of requests for new contract awards and disbursements such as processing of new 
reimbursement and issuance of new commitment letters. ADB will (i) inform the executing agency of ADB’s 
actions, and (ii) advise that the loan may be suspended if the audit documents are not received within the next 
six months. 
  When audited project financial statements have not been received within 12 months after the due date ADB 
may suspend the loan.

29 
52. 
Internal  Audit:  The  internal  audit  of  the  project  will  be  conducted  by  an  independent 
auditing  firm  recruited  by WRD  under  agreed  terms  of  reference.  The  objective  of  the  internal 
audit is to strengthen the internal control framework and provide project management with timely 
fiduciary assurance that: (i) the financial management, the procurement systems and the internal 
control procedures as applicable to the activities under the project are being adhered to by the 
PMU, PIOs and the support entities; and (ii) the financial information being submitted to and by 
the  PMU  is  in  agreement  with  the  financial  records,  and  can  be  relied  upon  to  support  the 
disbursements made by the ADB as reimbursement of eligible expenditures. The internal auditor 
will submit a quarterly internal audit report to the Steering Committee. An executive summary of 
the key findings of the internal audit will also be submitted with the internal audit report for sharing 
the same with ADB, for the latter’s information. The terms of reference for the internal audit are 
attached as Appendix D. 
30 
PROCUREMENT AND CONSULTING SERVICES 
53. 
This is the first ADB loan to be implemented by the EA. WRD staff are experienced with 
competitive  procurement  procedures,  especially  for  civil  works.  However,  they  are  not  directly 
familiar with ADB’s procedures, and the relevant staff have no direct experience with recruiting 
consulting  firms.  The  project  will  provide  training  on  ADB’s  rules  and  procedures,  and  a 
procurement  specialist  will  directly  support  the  PMU.  A  procurement  risk  assessment  was 
conducted  during  the  period  April  to  September  2014  and  is  included  as  a  supplementary 
document. 
A. 
Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing 
All  advance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  will  be  undertaken  in  conformity  with 
54. 
ADB’s  Procurement  Guidelines  (April  2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)23  and  ADB’s 
Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time).24 The issuance of 
invitations  to  bid  under  advance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  will  be  subject  to  ADB 
approval. The borrower, State and WRD have been advised that approval of advance contracting 
and retroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance the project. 
55. 
Advance  Contracting:  Before  negotiations  with  ADB  for  the  loan,  bidding  documents 
(including evaluation criteria) for all civil works and goods contracts to be awarded during first 12 
months of project implementation will be prepared by the EA and approved by ADB. The invitation 
for bids for civil works will be issued prior to negotiations. Furthermore, the tenders for 30% of the 
packages  to  be  awarded  in the  first  year  will  have  their  evaluations  approved  by  ADB  and  be 
ready for award. The call for expressions of interest for project implementation consultants will 
also be issued prior to loan negotiations. The detailed advance action schedules on procurement 
of works, which will be updated regularly, are presented below in Tables 15, 16 and 17.

B. 
Procurement of Goods, Works, and Consulting Services 
57. 
All  procurement  of  goods  and  works  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB’s 
Procurement  Guidelines.  An  18-month  procurement  plan  indicating  threshold  and  review 
procedures, goods, works, and consulting service contract packages is in Appendix C. 
58. 
Civil  works  and  goods.  All  procurement  of  goods  and  works  will  be  undertaken  in 
accordance with ADB’s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time). ADB’s 
standard bidding documents for international competitive bidding (ICB) will be used as a basis for 
preparing bid documents for national competitive bidding (NCB) for use under the project. The 
procurement plan indicates the threshold, mode of procurement and consultant selection, review 
procedures, and contract packages. International competitive bidding procedures will be used for 
civil  works  contracts  estimated  to  cost  $40  million  or  more,  and  supply  contracts  valued  at  $3 
million or higher. Shopping will be used for contracts for procurement of works and equipment 
worth less than $100,000. All civil works for channels and pumping stations are expected to use 
NCB, with single-stage, two-envelope bidding procedure. Equipment will be procured using both 
NCB  and  shopping,  in  accordance  with  the  procurement  plan.  Master  bidding  documents 
prepared  for  Vellayar  and  Pandavayar  packages  have  been  adopted  for  all  other  packages. 
Tenders for all goods and works contracts costing more than $1 million have been called for under 
advance action. 
59. 
Consultant services. All consultants and nongovernment organizations (NGOs) will be 
recruited according to ADB’s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The terms of reference for all 
consulting services are detailed in Appendix D. 
60. 
Seven national consultants will be recruited as individuals to supplement the capacity of 
WRD  staff  and  assist  the  PMU  and  PIU  in  project  implementation.  These  are  indicated  in  the 
procurement plan as Project Implementation Consultants. The cumulative person months fo the 
project implementation consultants are 102 months. In addition an individual consultant will be 
recruited as external resettlement monitoring specialist for 8 month input.  The PMU will obtain 
ADB’s prior review on the detailed terms of reference (TOR), cost estimate, and evaluation criteria 
for  each  individual  before  advertising  for  each  position  in  an  English  language  daily  national 
newspaper and on WRD’s and ADB’s websites. 
61.  WRD will recruit a firm to support the PMU in the following deliverables: (i) preparation of 
flood maps and establishing a decision support system, and (ii) preparation of feasibility study, 
detailed  design,  and  project  documents  for  follow  on  project  for  the  remainder  of  the  Cauvery 
Delta.  The  consultant  team  is  called  Project  Technical  Assistance  Consultants  (PTAC)  in  the 
procurement plan. An estimated 25 person months international, 74 person months national are 
required for PTAC, and the quality- and cost-based selection (QCBS) method with a quality:cost 
ratio of 80:20 will be used. In addition two survey firms will be recruited to undertake topographic 
surveys for the proposed new project areas. 
62. 
Implementation of the resettlement plan will require consultancy services of a NGO. A firm 
will be recruited to develop and maintain a management information system (MIS). WRD will use 
least  cost  selection method for the  NGO  package  and QCBS for the  MIS  package .  Expertise 
consist solely of national expertise.  
34 
C. 
Procurement Plan 
63. 
The  procurement  plan  indicating  threshold  and  review  procedures,  goods,  works,  and 
consulting service contract packages and national competitive bidding guidelines is in Appendix 
C.  The  procurement  plan  provides:  (i)  a  list  of  goods,  works,  and consulting  services  contract 
packages that will be processed over the next 18 months with milestone dates for activities; (ii) the 
proposed methods for procurement of such contracts permitted under the loan agreement; and 
(iii) the related ADB review procedures. The procurement packages in the procurement plan will 
be updated by the PMU for approval by ADB. The procurement plan should be updated at least 
every June (more frequently if necessary) and should cover the next 18 months of procurement 
activity. A delay in  loan effectiveness, other start-up delays, and delays during implementation 
may  require  an  unscheduled  procurement  plan  update.  ADB  will  review  each  updated 
procurement plan prior to its disclosure. When appropriate, this activity may be undertaken in the 
field by ADB missions in consultation with borrower and EA. 
D. 
Consultant's Terms of Reference

SAFEGUARDS 
67. 
The  EA  will  ensure  that  all  requirements  prescribed  in  the  initial  environmental 
examination  report  and  resettlement  plan  will  be  complied  with  during  preparation  of  relevant 
safeguard documents and implementation of the project.  
Pursuant to ADB's SPS 2009 (SPS), ADB will not reimburse expenditure incurred on any 
68. 
activities listed in in the ADB’s Prohibited Investment Activities List set forth in Appendix 5 of the 
SPS,  attached  in  Appendix  G.  WRD  will  ensure  that  all  investments  are  in  compliance  with 
applicable national laws and regulations, and ADB’s SPS 2009. 
A. 
Environmental Safeguards 
69. 
The project is categorized B as per ADB’s SPS 2009. An initial environment examination 
(IEE) was prepared for the project and includes an environmental management plan (EMP) which 
describes  mitigation  measures  to  be  adopted  during  design,  construction  and  operation.    The 
environment officers assigned by WRD (one assistant executive engineer assigned as safeguard 
officer at the PMU and assistant engineers at the PIU) supported by the environmental specialist 
attached  to  the  PIC  will  monitor  implementation  of  the  environmental  management  plan  and 
submit  semi-annual  environmental  monitoring  reports  to  ADB  and  government.  WRD  will  be 
responsible  to  get  the  necessary  governmental  clearances,  including  the  clearances  required 
under the Coastal Regulation Zone act, prior to award of contract. 
70. 
The  EMP  will  be  included  in  the  bidding  documents  and  form  part  of  the  contract 
documents. All bid documents will include a requirement to incorporate necessary resources into 
the contractor’s bid to implement mitigation measures specified in the EMP. Where unanticipated 
environmental impacts become apparent during project implementation, the IEE including EMP 
will be updated by the environment specialist attached to the PMU. Any updates to the IEE or 
EMP will be submitted to ADB for review. 
71. 
The EA through the PMU with the support of the environmental specialists in the PIC and 
environmental safeguards officers attached to the PMU and PIUs will be responsible to: (i) provide 
oversight  on  environmental  management  aspects  of  the  project  and  ensure  that  the  EMP  is 
implemented by the contractors, (ii) facilitate and ensure contractors comply with all government 
rules and regulations and obtain any  relevant approvals required for works, (iii) supervise and 
guide  contractors  on  implementation  of  the  EMP;  (iv)  review,  monitor  and  evaluate  the 
effectiveness with which the EMP is implemented, and recommend necessary corrective actions 
to be taken as necessary; (v) submit semi-annual monitoring reports to ADB; (vi) ensure timely 
disclosure of the IEE in locations and forms accessible to the public; (vii) take corrective actions 
when necessary when unforeseen negative environmental impacts occur; (viii) conduct ongoing 
consultation  with  the  community  during  implementation  of  the  project;  and  (ix)  establish  a 
grievance redress mechanism and ensure it is operated satisfactorily.  
72. 
ADB will review progress of implementation of the EMP during regular review missions. 
ADB  will  also  review  periodic  monitoring reports and officially  disclose  the  IEE  and monitoring 
reports on ADB’s website. 
B. 
Social Safeguards 
73. 
The  project  will  not  involve  any  land  acquisition,  because  all  civil  works  along  the  6 
channels  will  be  within  the  available  right-of-way.  However,  the  project  will  have  a  significant 
40 
impact  due  to  its  need  to  displace  3,235  squatter  households,  occupying  the  embankment  of 
these channels, comprising of 2,642 residences, 478 shops and 115 cattle sheds/sheds, with total 
12,887 affected peoples. The project is categorized A in accordance to ADB’s Safeguard Policy 
Statement  (2009).  The  resettlement  plan  (RP)  complies  with  government  regulations  on 
resettlement rehabilitation and ADB’s safeguard requirements for involuntary resettlement. The 
RP was prepared in close consultation with affected people and comprehensively assesses the 
impacts  of  involuntary  resettlement,  and  provides  adequate  measures  to address the  impacts. 
The  RP  is  based  on  the  detailed  design,  and  therefore,  the  RP  is  final  unless  unanticipated 
changes in design are encountered during project implementation. To strengthen the capacity of 
WRD in implementing the plan, the PMU will be assisted by a non-governmental organization and 
a  social  development  consultant.  An  external  monitoring  consultant  will  also  be  engaged  to 
monitor implementation of the resettlement plans. The WRD has secured a budget to implement 
the RP including budget to recruit consultants for implementing RP. 
74. 
For  the  EA  this  RP  is  the  first  to  be  developed  in  accordance  with  the  Government  of 
India’s new Act on land acquisition and ADB’s SPS 2009. Therefore, the EA will need continuous 
support to ensure that the RP is implemented as planned. The PMU and PIUs will be assisted by 
an NGO and Social Development consultant. The following actions will be carried out by PMU 
and PIU to implement the RP.  
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
(v) 
(vi) 
(vii) 
the  RP  will  be  updated  if  required  and  implemented  by  an  NGO  that  will  be 
engaged  by  PMU.  This  team  will  be  supervised  by  PMU’s  social  development 
consultant. During implementation, meaningful consultation with project affected 
persons (PAP) will be undertaken. During consultations the following will be shared 
(i) the entitlement matrix,  (ii) the availability of GRM as an avenue to bring PAP 
concerns, and (iii) implementation arrangements. 
the  PMU’s  social  development  consultant  (SDC)  will  be  responsible  to  keep  all 
records  on  implementation  of  RPs/updated  RPs  to  (i)  record  the  progress 
payments  to  displaced  persons,  (ii)  record the  progress  in  handling  grievances, 
and  (iii)  other  related  matters  in  implementing  the  RPs.  This  information  will  be 
included in the quarterly progress reports and semi-annual monitoring report. 
the Independent monitoring consultant will monitor the  implementation of RP to 
review  of  the  objectives  of  the  RP  are  achieved,  including  verifying  progress 
reports on RP implementation and submit monitoring reports to ADB. 
the PMU and PIUs assisted by SDC and the NGO will coordinate with the relevant 
authorities to establish the GRM. 
the WRD assisted by PMU and PIUs will ensure that land and the basic facilities 
such as road, clean water for resettled displaced  peoples (DPs) will be available 
prior to removing the DPs from project areas. 
the PMU and PIUs will be responsible to: (i) obtain  ADB’s approval on RPs and 
updates  if  any,  prior  to  awarding  a  civil  work  contract;  (ii)  monitor  the 
implementation of RP, (iii) submit  semi- annual resettlement monitoring reports to 
ADB, while quarterly progress on resettlement implementation will be reported in 
the Project quarterly progress report. All monitoring reports will also include GRC 
activities during the reporting period. 
The EA must ensure that if the RP needs to be updated due to any design changes 
during implementation the updated RP is submitted to and approved by ADB prior 
to award of any contract.   
75. 
Indigenous  Peoples:  Currently,  there  are  no  indigenous  peoples  under  the  project. 
Therefore, it is categorised as Category-C for indigenous peoples. The PMU and PIUs assisted 
41 
by SDC will continually oversee whether any IP will be affected by the project implementation, 
although the project is categorized as a C project, to ensure, if necessary action to address impact 
to IP is needed. 
C. 
Grievance Redress Mechanism 
76. 
Under  the  safeguards  implementation,  a  project  specific  grievance  redress  mechanism 
(GRM) will be established to receive and facilitate the resolution of affected people’s concerns, 
complaints and grievances if any about the social and environmental performance at the project 
level. The GRM will aim to provide a time bound and transparent mechanism to voice and resolve 
social  and  environmental  concerns  linked  with  the  project.  The  project  specific  GRM  is  not 
intended to bypass the government’s own redress process, rather it is intended to address project 
affected people’s concerns and complaints promptly, making it readily accessible to all segments 
of affected persons and is scaled to the risks and impacts of the project. 
77. 
A three tier GRM will be established. The first tier GRM will be a single contact point at the 
jurisdictional PIU Vennar Division, Thiruvarur or PMU. When a stakeholder raises an issue with 
the  PMU  or  PIU  every  attempt  will  be  made  to  respond  speedily  and  the  complaint  should be 
acknowledge within three days. If the PMU or PIU are unable to find a resolution within two weeks 
of receiving the complaint it will be raised to the second tier. The second tier will be established 
at  the  project  level,  at  Thiruvaur,  and  Nagapatinam.  The  second  tier  will  have  a  grievance 
redressal committee (GRC) headed/chaired by Revenue Divisional Officer (RDO) and comprising 
of Executive Engineer (Thiruvarur), Projects, WRD as member secretary, a local person of repute 
and standing in the society, one male representative from among the displaced persons and one 
female representative from among the displaced persons. The RDO will nominate the local person 
of repute and standing in the society and the displaced persons representatives. The selected 
local person will function as the secretary of the GRC and will receive grievances and forward 
these to the member secretary for placing before the GRC.  GRC will be convened once in every 
the  aggrieved  person  pass  necessary  orders.  The 
three  weeks  and  after  hearing 
complaint/grievance will be redressed in 2 weeks and written communication will be sent to the 
complainant. A complaint register will be maintained at PIU level with details of complaints lodged, 
date  of  personal  hearing,  action  taken  and  date  of  communication  sent  to  complainant.  Minor 
complaints such as disturbances due to construction activity will be resolved immediately by the 
WRD and contractor. WRD will maintain a log of complaints made. 
78. 
Any complaint that cannot be resolved or redressed in 2 weeks by GRC will automatically 
move to the third tier of GRM. The third tier of the GRC will be headed/chaired by District Collector 
and will comprise Executive Engineer, PMU, WRD as member secretary, District Revenue Officer 
and relevant officers from district level officers (membership may change based on the grievance). 
The second tier will focus on finding resolutions for the complainants, and with  time frame not 
more than 2 weeks.

  GENDER AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS 
79. 
The survey undertaken as part of the poverty and social assessment (PSA) study for the 
project area shows that female population are higher than male population (1,035 females per 
1,000 males). The survey undertaken to prepare the resettlement plan, show that the project will 
displace  3,235  squatter  households  living  along  the  embankments.  Only  2,479  households 
provided sex disaggregated data during the survey. Of these households 2,186 households are 
headed by males and 293 are headed by females. Along the six channels, among the affected 
persons, 746 of the 1,780 agricultural laborers are women. 
80. 
The  results  of  the  PSA  survey  of  the  Vennar  system  indicate  that  the  percentage  of 
households  belonging  to  the  Scheduled  Tribes  category  ranged  from  0.15%  in  Thanjavur  to 
0.29% in Thiruvarur district. The survey did not record any differences in livelihood patterns or 
cultural identities between the Scheduled Tribes and non-Scheduled Tribes. On the basis of these 
factors, it is concluded that the project will not directly or indirectly affect indigenous people as 
described in the ADB SPS 2009 and therefore an indigenous peoples plan is not required. The 
findings of the census survey undertaken for preparation of the resettlement plan also supports 
this  conclusion,  because  out  of  the  2,500  households  willing  to  provide  information  only  16 
households are from schedule tribes. However, they are not living as a group but have merged 
with other families. 
81. 
The project includes some features to include gender and social dimensions. This will be 
addressed  primarily  through  the  involvement  of  farmers,  initially  through  channel  stakeholder 
groups. Each stakeholder group will have 5 government officials and 15 farmers of the region, 
comprising of not less than 3 women. This forum is expected to promote participatory planning, 
operation  and  maintenance  of  irrigation  schemes  which  will  enhance  water  use  efficiency, 
productivity and incomes of male and female farmers as indicated in the design and monitoring 
framework of the project. 
82. 
The project is expected to have some gender benefits, and therefore the PMU assisted 
by SDC and PIUs will take the following actions: (i) ensure that the training for farmers will include 
at least 30% participants from women farmers and will consider women’s needs and constraints 
(including possible limitations in time availability, mobility, literacy) in selecting the venue, timing 
and duration of training to enable maximum participation by women, (ii) ensure that each channel 
stakeholder group will have a minimum of 3 women farmers as member and support a female 
farmer to be elected as vice chair of the group, (iii) ensure that capacity building training programs 
of WRD will have at least 10% women officers, and (iv) ensure that the project quarterly report 
submitted to ADB will include a gender section to report the progress in implementing these above 
actions, including gender disaggregated data. 
Labor standards: The borrower, State and WRD will ensure that Works contracts under 
83. 
the project follow all applicable labor laws of the borrower and the State and that these further 
include provisions to the effect that contractors; (i) carry out HIV/AIDS awareness programs for 
labor  and  disseminate  information  at  worksites  on  risks  of  sexually  transmitted  diseases  and 
HIV/AIDS  as  part  of  health  and  safety  measures  for  those  employed  during  construction;  and 
(ii) follow  and  implement  all  statutory  provisions  on  labor  (including  not  employing  or  using 
children  as  labor,  equal  pay  for  equal  work),  health,  safety,  welfare,  sanitation,  and  working 
conditions. Such contracts shall also include clauses for termination in case of any breach of the 
stated provisions by the contractors. WRD will closely monitor compliance 
The PMU and PIU will require the contractors to report in each monthly progress report 
84. 
on labor employed covering the following information: (i) total number of contractor workers based 
on type of jobs in the particular reporting month, (ii) number of female and male workers in each 
job category, (iii) age of workers, and (iv) a statement of any difference in wages for male and 
female workers and the reasons.

B. 
Monitoring  
86. 
Project  performance  monitoring.  The  PMU  will  establish  a  project  performance 
management  system  (PPMS)  which  will  include  monitoring  using  the  targets,  indicators, 
assumptions, and risks identified in the project design and monitoring framework. The baseline 
data  for  indicators  and targets  set  out  in  the  design  and monitoring  framework  were  collected 
during the PPTA and will be stored in the PPMS. Data indicators for subsequent years will be 
entered annually into the PPMS by PMU. Financial and physical progress will be recorded in the 
project management module of the PPMS.25 
87. 
Compliance monitoring. The status of compliance with assurances, conditions and loan 
covenants—policy, legal, financial, economic, environmental, and others— will be included in the 
PMU  quarterly  progress  reports  and  will  be  reviewed  at  each  ADB  review  mission.  All  non-
compliance issues, if any, together with remedial actions, will be updated in quarterly progress 
reports. 
Safeguards Monitoring. WRD will establish a social and environmental monitoring cell 
88. 
within the PMU, which will be staffed by two government officers. Each of the two PIUs will include 
four  government  officers  each  assigned  to  implement  and  monitor  environmental  and  social 
safeguards. The PMU and PIU will be supported by the PIC environment and social development 
consultants in monitoring and reporting. 
89. 
The RP implementation will be monitored internally by the PIU assisted by PMU Social 
Development Consultant (SDC). The NGO engaged to help implement the resettlement plan will 
submit to PMU and PIUs monthly progress reports outlining the progress on paying compensation 
to  displaced  persons,  physical  progress  of  resettlement  sites,  progress  on  implementing  other 
aspects of RP. On this basis, the PMU SDC will include quarterly progress in implementing RP, 
in the project quarterly progress reports submitted to ADB.  In addition, the EA will submit a stand-
alone  semi-annual  report  on  implementing  RP  to  ADB  and  the  government.  The  final  RP 
semiannual  report  will  cover  overall  implementation  of  RP  and  will  be  considered  as  RP 
compliance report. The external monitoring of the RP implementation will be undertaken by an 
external  monitoring  consultant  who  will  submit  semi-annual  reports  to  WRD  for  submission  to 
ADB.  
90. 
On  environmental  safeguards,  the  PMU  and  PIU  responsible  officers  supported  by  the 
environment specialist of the PIC will be responsible to monitor and report on implementation of 
the  EMP.  Progress  of  implementation  of  the  EMP  will  be  included  in  WRD’s  quarterly  project 
progress reports and environmental monitoring reports will be submitted semi-annually. 
ADB will monitor implementation of social and environmental safeguards during its review 
91. 
missions. 
92. 
Gender and social dimensions monitoring. The PMU will report on public participation, 
gender, and implementation of labor law in the project quarterly progress report. The report on 
public participation will focus on the progress of formation and implementation of the channel level 
stakeholder participation and report on consultations undertaken during project implementation. 
On gender aspects, the quarterly progress reports will include information on participation of WRD 
staff in the project either through capacity building training or their direct involvement in managing 
25 ADB's project performance reporting system is available at:  
http://www.adb.org/Documents/Slideshows/PPMS/default.asp?p=evaltool 
47 
this  project.  The  gender  progress  should  also  include  data  on  sex  disaggregated  data  on 
involvement of women farmers/communities in the project. 
C. 
Evaluation 
93. 
A mid-term review of the project will be undertaken 18 months after the loan effectiveness 
date.  It  will  evaluate  the  scope  of  the  loan,  implementation  arrangements;  safeguard  issues, 
achievement  of  scheduled  targets,  contract  management  progress,  and  other  issues  including 
mid-course corrections. As an input to the mid-term review, WRD will prepare with the assistance 
of its consultants an assessment of project results and implementation progress, and submit this 
to ADB two weeks in advance of the mid-term review mission. An evaluation will be undertaken 
by ADB one year after the closure of the project. Findings of the completion report will be shared 
and disseminated within ADB and with key government officials at the national and state level. 
94.  Within  6  months  of  physical  completion  of  the  project,  WRD  will  submit  a  project 
completion report to ADB.26 
D. 
Reporting  
95. 
The PMU will provide ADB with (i) quarterly progress reports in a format consistent with 
ADB's  project  performance  reporting  system;  (ii)  consolidated  annual  reports  including  (a) 
progress achieved by output as measured through each indicator's performance targets, (b) key 
implementation 
issues  and  solutions;  (c)  updated  procurement  plan;  (d)  semi-annual 
environmental monitoring and semi-annual social safeguards monitoring reports and (e) updated 
implementation  plan  for  next  12  months.  To  ensure  projects  continue  to  be  both  viable  and 
sustainable, project financial statements and the executing agency audited financial statements, 
together with the associated auditor's report, should be adequately reviewed. 
E. 
Stakeholder Communication Strategy  
96. 
Effective  participation  of  various  stakeholders  in  the  project  will  be  achieved  using  a 
stakeholder communication plan (see Appendix F). Government officials, policymakers and water 
users,  particularly  farmers,  will  be  the  primary  stakeholders  in  the  project.  Dissemination  of 
information and seeking ideas and opinions of stakeholders is built into the communication plan. 
The following table summarizes the communications plan.

ANTICORRUPTION POLICY 
97. 
The Government, the state government, and WRD are advised of ADB’s Anticorruption 
Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date).  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, 
accountability  and  transparency,  implementation  of  the  project  shall  adhere  to  ADB’s 
Anticorruption Policy. ADB reserves the right to review and examine, directly or through its agents, 
any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  project.  In  this 
regard, investigation of government officials, if any, would be requested by ADB to be undertaken 
by the government. 
98. 
To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB’s Anticorruption Policy are included 
in  the  Loan  Regulations,  Agreements,  and  the  bidding  documents.  In  particular,  all  contracts 
financed by ADB shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the 
records and accounts of the State and WRD, and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other 
service  providers  as  they  relate  to  the  project.  Individuals/entities  on  ADB’s  anticorruption 
debarment list are ineligible to participate in ADB-financed activity and may not be awarded any 
contract under the Project.27 
99. 
ADB's Anticorruption Policy designates the Office of Anticorruption and Integrity (OAI) as 
the point of contact to report allegations of fraud or corruption among ADB-financed projects or 
its  staff. OAI  is responsible for  all  matters  related to allegations  of fraud  and  corruption.  For  a 
more  detailed  explanation  refer  to  the  Anticorruption  Policy  and  Procedures.  Anyone  coming

ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISM 
100.  People  who  are,  or may  in the future  be,  adversely  affected  by the  project  may  submit 
complaints  to  ADB’s  Accountability  Mechanism.  The  Accountability  Mechanism  provides  an 
independent forum and process whereby people adversely affected by ADB-assisted projects can 
voice,  and  seek  a  resolution  of  their  problems,  as  well  as  report  alleged  violations  of  ADB’s 
operational  policies  and  procedures.  Before  submitting  a  complaint  to  the  Accountability 
Mechanism, affected people should make a good faith effort to solve their problems by working 
with  the  concerned  ADB  operations  department.  Only  after  doing  that,  and  if  they  are  still 
dissatisfied, should they approach the Accountability Mechanism.28 
XII. 
RECORD OF CHANGES TO THE PROJECT ADMINISTRATION MANUAL 
 On  16  June  20017,  after  discussions  held  during  the  12-16  June  review  mission,  the 
101. 
following updates were agreed on and updated in the PAM: 
  Table 3 and Figure 2: Two additional PIUs have been formed to support the supervision 
of the construction works: (i) Thanjavur-Cauvery and (ii) Thanjavur-Vennar. The PIUs are 
also being supervised by the SE, lower Cauvery basin circle, Thanjavur.  
  Paragraph  77:  Grievance  Redress  Mechanism  (GRM):  Any  complaint  will  be 
acknowledged within three days, and if unresolved after two weeks raised to the second 
tier.  Additionally,  the  first  tier  GRM  has  been  amended  to  a  single  contact  point  at  the 
jurisdictional PIU Vennar Division, Thiruvarur or PMU.  The grievance redressal committee 
(GRC) was also updated with an Executive Engineer (Thiruvarur).  
 Table 3 and Appendix F - paragraph 9: The field implementation coordination committee 
(FICC) is chaired by the relevant district collector, with the district revenue officer as the 
vice chair. The FICC was also formed in Thiruvarur and Nagapattinam districts.

Appendix A 
APPENDICES 
Appendix A: Management of Flood Risk and Flood Events 
Assessment of Flood Risk 
1. 
Analysis of flood risk on rivers and drains and adjacent flood plains in the Vennar system 
will be based on flood risk mapping derived from modelling of flood frequency and impact under 
current  and  future  climate  scenarios  using  the  digital  terrain  models  (DTMs)  to  prepare  flood 
extent, duration, and depth maps for a range of design storms under current and future climate 
and sea level scenarios. 
Flood risk mapping for the Pandavayar, Vellaiyar, Harichandra, Adappar and Valavanar 
2. 
catchments has already been undertaken. For the follow on project it will be undertaken by the 
PTAC  consultants,  the  Hydrologist,  Surface  Water  Modeller  and  GIS  Specialist.  On  the  job 
training  will  be  provided  to  WRD  staff  in  the  process.  Flood  forecasting  and  warning  will  be 
installed in the project area and recommendations provided for the follow on project. 
Flood Forecasting and Warning 
There is already an effective flood warning system for the Cauvery and Coleroon rivers 
3. 
but flood forecasting and warning for the smaller delta watercourses such as the Lower Cauvery 
and Vennar rivers and the Grand Anicut Canal are less well developed. 
4. 
The flood forecasting and warning systems will comprise the following: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
(v) 
Links  between  the  WRD  DSS  and  1-3  day  rainfall  forecasts  in  the  Indian 
meteorological  department  (IMD)  daily  weather  bulletin  for  Tamil  Nadu  and 
Pondicherry1  which  includes  3-day  forecasts  of  rainfall  according  to  six  classes 
(widespread,  fairly  widespread,  scattered,  isolated,  mainly  dry  and  dry)  and 
warnings of heavy rainfall according to three severities (Heavy (64.4-124.4 mm; 
Very Heavy (124.5-244.4 mm; Extremely Heavy (>244.4 mm)). The IMD bulletin 
also provides a weather outlook for the 4-day period following the 3-day forecast 
period. 
Real  time  links  between  the  WRD  DSS  flows  within  the  river/canal/drainage 
systems as indicated by the network of telemetered water level recorders 
Modelling  by  WRD  hydrologists  of  storm  runoff  from  the  Vennar  and  Cauvery 
systems using a simple catchment rainfall-runoff model such as SWAT (Soil and 
Water  Assessment  Tool)  or  similar  from  forecast  rainfall  obtained from  the  IMD 
daily weather bulletins. 
For  normal  flood  operation  of  regulators  in  the  irrigation  systems,  model  water 
levels within the channels at key locations for up to 3 days 
Modelling of alternative modes of flood operation of regulators to identify optimum 
gate  settings  to  minimize  flood  impacts  and  conserve  excess  surface  water  in 
natural  storage  areas.  During major  widespread floods  it  is  standard  practice to

Appendix A  
53 
fully  open  all  regulators  in  the  Vennar  system  (except  the  Harichandra  and 
Adappar head regulators) in order to discharge flood waters to the sea as quickly 
as possible. However during less widespread flooding there may be opportunities 
to reduce flood impacts locally and save water by re-routing flood water towards 
natural storage areas such as the flood plain/paleo-lagoon on the lower Valavanar 
Drain. 
(vi) 
(vii) 
Identify areas where high water levels in the channels will impede field drainage or 
exceed embankment levels. 
Develop  links  to  District  Collectors,  District  Disaster  Management  Authorities, 
Municipalities and Panchayats for the dissemination of flood warnings. 
5. 
The techniques to be used will include: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
(v) 
(vi) 
(vii) 
Statistical  correlations  between  historical  IMD  forecasts  of  rainfall  and  locally 
observed rainfall and peak water levels at the principal structures in the Vennar 
and Cauvery systems 
Rainfall  intensity  and  duration  thresholds  corresponding  to  observed  flooding  in 
the systems. 
Statistical  correlations  between  historical  observed  water  levels  at  the  principal 
structures in the Vennar and Cauvery systems 
Water level thresholds corresponding to observed flooding in the systems. 
Confirmation of rainfall and water level thresholds through hydraulic modelling of 
the without-project and with-project configurations of channels and structures 
Determine flood forecast and flood warning triggers. 
Flood forecast and flood warning triggers will be programmed into the DSS so that 
WRD decision makers can be alerted to the risk of flooding and the potential need 
to  issue  targeted  flood  warnings  through  the  District  Disaster  Management 
Authorities to the public.  
Flood Risk Mapping 
6. 
Post-flood surveys of structures and embankments that are normally carried out by WRD 
after  floods  will  be  expanded  to  include  the  mapping  of  flood  extent  and  estimation  of  depth, 
duration, velocity and direction of flow on the flood plains. This information will be used to improve 
the configuration and calibration of the flood models, flood warning triggers and indicate high risk 
locations where additional flood risk mitigations are required. 
7. 
Using the DTMs produced from the topographic surveys of channels, structures and flood 
plains and stereo imagery and any existing DTMs of the Vennar and Cauvery systems and the 
hydrological and hydraulic models of the systems, geo-referenced maps of flood extent, duration 
and  depth  for  a  range  of  design  floods  (25,  50  and  100-year  floods  with  and  without  climate 
change) for the with-project scenario and the without-project scenarios will be produced. 
54 
Appendix A 
The  flood  maps  will  be  used  by  WRD  to  (i)  refine  the  flood  forecasting  and  warning 
8. 
systems by developing geographically targeted forecasts and warnings which will assist district 
disaster  management  authorities  (DDMAs)  to  deploy  emergency  services  accurately  and 
efficiently, (ii) identify high risk areas which require additional flood mitigation measures and (iii) 
support flood disaster planning by the DDMAs.

will be provided by the equipment suppliers. Training in the operation and maintenance of hydro 
meteorological  databases  required  for  flood  forecasting  and  warning,  including  data  quality 
control, processing, reporting and archiving will be provided in the course of setting up the DSS. 
Training  in rainfall-runoff  modelling,  hydraulic  modelling  and  the  development  of flood  warning 
triggers will be delivered by the PTAC consultants.
Appendix B

Appendix B: Implementation of Decision Support System 
A. 
Summary 
A Decision Support System (DSS) is to be developed to support WRD to improve water 
1. 
resources management in the project area by providing a near real time overview of the water 
resources related information in the Vennar system and providing guidance on action to be taken. 
It  is  envisaged  that  the  information  provided  by  the  system  would  progressively  developed  in 
response to user needs once they become familiar with the system. 
2. 
The DSS will comprise basic information and data necessary to support decision making 
for regulator operations, irrigation planning and management of water resources by the WRD and 
will  include  surface  water  and  groundwater  databases  and  irrigation  command  area  (ayacut) 
information  such  as  crop  water  requirements  and crop  areas. The  DSS would also include an 
asset management component to support improved planning of system maintenance. 
The simple DSS will be accessible to WRD decision makers and operating staff through 
3. 
a user-friendly computer interface (or tablets and smartphones) allowing them to inspect up-to-
date storage level at Mettur Dam, river levels, flows, water demands throughout each irrigation 
and  drainage  system  and  to  adjust  surface  water  deliveries  to  actual  needs  considering  local 
groundwater availability and recent rainfall. 
4. 
There are three main components to the system: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
Equipment along the six channels to capture key data, particularly water levels and 
telemetry to convey the data to a central data base 
A database with software to process the channel data and combine with other data 
to  provide  information  relating  to  the  system  status  and  provide  guidance  on 
operation.  
Users who access the information through the internet using fixed (e.g. desktop 
computers) and mobile (e.g. smartphones and tablets) devices in order to make 
decisions and take action on system operation and and maintenance. The system 
would  also  be  able  to  automatically  generate  messages  through  SMS  or  other 
technological means for pre-determined conditions. 
5. 
In  the  interests  of  benefit  to  all  users,  transparency,  accountability  and  stakeholder 
participation, the water users may be given access to the system status information provided by 
the DSS. 
6. 
The architecture of the DSS will comprise will comprise of software and hard ware with 
excellent  internet  connectivity  and  backup  systems  such  as  in  the  PWD  Surface  Water  and 
Groundwater  Data  Centre  in  Chennai.  Computers  in  the  offices  of  the  divisional  Executive 
Engineers and/or the sub-divisional Assistant Executive Engineers will be able to access the main 
DSS database through the internet using either reports or web pages created on demand or by 
downloading specific data for local analysis. A tablet/smartphone or suitable application should 
be developed to enable key data in the DSS to be accessed by field staff when out of office. For 
example,  incorporation  of  gate  rating  curves  in  the  system  would  enable  operating  staff  to  be 
guided on the appropriate gate openings to achieve the required flow distribution. 
56 
Appendix B 
The monitoring stations will deliver data into the database automatically in near real time 
7. 
and will be immediately available for automatic quality control, archiving, processing and analysis. 
Interpretation, decision-making and reporting would be undertaken by qualified WRD technicians 
to support  operational  decisions  by  key WRD  engineers. To  the maximum  extent  possible the 
data processing functions will be automated with reports and graphs created on demand to meet 
user requirements. The database software will detect abnormal conditions and automatically raise 
alarms by SMS or email to pre-defined users. 
Key decision-making that would be supported initially include: (i) Irrigation planning and 
8. 
efficient water distribution to the systems on seasonal and crop watering (e.g. 6-day) time scales, 
based on actual immediate crop water requirements in individual command areas, (ii) integrated 
operation of Mettur dam, anicuts, head regulators, cross regulators and tail regulators to maintain 
appropriate flows and water levels in the rivers and main drains during normal supply periods and 
floods,  and  (iii)  Detection  and  response  to  distribution  system  problems  and  breakdowns  at 
regulators. The system would also entry the entry of data by authorised field staff on operational 
problems and maintenance requirements to facilitate the generation of status reports 
9. 
After WRD familiarity  and confidence  in  the  usefulness  DSS  has  been  established,  the 
DSS should be developed into a more sophisticated tool that will support the planning, execution 
and monitoring of water use, the integration of hydrologic and hydraulic models to inform decision 
making about irrigation operations during normal and stressed water resource conditions. These 
developments maybe considered during the proposed follow on project. 
10. 
Further development of the DSS could include flood forecasting (using links to the India 
Meteorological  Department  and  the  CWC)  and  flood  warning  and  management  of  regulators 
during flood events. 
B. 
Analysis of Needs 
11. 
Surface water supply to the Cauvery Delta during June to October is determined largely 
by the amount of water available in the Stanley Reservoir at Mettur Dam. Estimates of irrigation 
requirements are prepared by the WRD sub-divisional engineers according to irrigated farm areas 
and  standard  water  duties.  The  sub-divisional  estimates  are  aggregated  by  the  Executive 
Engineers and Superintending Engineer and used to decide the necessary releases of water from 
Mettur Dam. 
Operation  of  head  regulators  in  the  Cauvery  Delta  determines  the  distribution  of  water 
12. 
released from  Mettur  Dam. The Grand  Anicut  is the  apex  regulator  in the  delta  which  controls 
discharges to the Cauvery, Vennar and Grand Anicut Canal systems. In the Vennar system, the 
VVR head regulator is used to release the necessary discharges to maintain normal supply levels 
in the Vettar, Vennar and Vadavadar rivers. 
13. 
Formal control rules and structure ratings, published in 1937, are still referred to by WRD 
gate  operators.  These  instruct  the  operators  how  to  determine  appropriate  gate  settings  to 
maintain the required supply levels. WRD review gate settings on a six day cycle using information 
on irrigation demands and recent rainfall to decide appropriate discharges and gate settings for 
the next 6 days. This procedure is based on the experience and judgment of WRD Engineers.  
Actual discharges through the head regulators are now probably less than those indicated 
14. 
by the 1937 theoretical discharge tables because of the influence of vegetation and sediment on 
flow characteristics in the vicinity of the regulators. Therefore, based on their judgment, the gate 
Appendix B  
57 
operators compensate by adjusting gate openings in order to maintain normal supply levels in the 
system. 
15.  WRD  engineers  attempt  to  maintain  the  rivers  at  normal  supply  levels  but  operate  the 
canal head sluices in response to farmers’ requests, many of which are received individually by 
telephone or through direct lobbying. Decision-making on water distribution to the command areas 
is therefore not systematic or collective. There appear to be no formal water distribution plans or 
watering schedules for each command area (ayacut). Present practices tend to favor upstream 
users,  giving  them  the  opportunity  to  consume  more  water  than  needed  and  to  disadvantage 
downstream users. 
16. 
During flood conditions inflows into the delta from the Cauvery River are stopped at the 
Grand Anicut and diverted to the sea through the Ullar channel to the Coleroon River. At these 
times most regulators in the Cauvery, Vennar and Grand Anicut Canal systems are opened fully 
to  discharge  storm  runoff  generated  within  the  delta  to  the  sea  as  quickly  as  possible.  In  the 
Vennar  system,  flood  waters  are  directed  preferentially  down  the  Vettar  River,  then  down  the 
Vennar River and finally, if necessary, down the Vadavar River. 
17. 
This indicate that (i) there is a need for greater accuracy of discharge measurements at 
all  regulators  through  updated  calibrations  of  the  gates,  (ii)  linking  gate  operation  with  rainfall 
forecasts  could  improve  the  management  of  the  irrigation  systems  by  reducing  irrigation 
requirements,  increasing  water  use  efficiency,  and  securing  crop  production,  and  (iii)  some 
irrigation head sluices are unregulated because they are blocked or stuck partially open, or fully 
open, due to lack of maintenance,. 
C. 
 Functions of the Decision Support System 
a. 
Water Distribution 
18. 
The current method of operation of the canal systems in the Cauvery Delta is in response 
to requests from farmers for water. It favors individual farmers but is inefficient in terms of water 
management. There is also the problem of collating all requests, and identifying and scheduling 
the most effective way of meeting all individual requirements. 
19. 
Optimal irrigation supply requires that rainfall in the irrigated area is anticipated and supply 
reduced accordingly. A DSS function could be provided to link the operation of the Mettur Dam, 
Grand  Anicut  and  VVR  head  regulator  with  the  forecast  rainfall.  This  would  support  decision-
making by WRD to adjust river flows in advance. It takes water approximately 3 days to travel 
from Mettur Dam to Grand Anicut and a further 3 days from Grand Anicut to the tail end regulators 
in the delta. 
20. 
There  is  also  the  issue  of  equity  of  supply  as  farmers  closer  to  the  source  of  irrigation 
water will receive more water than those at the tail of the system. Special arrangements have to 
be made if equity of supply is to be achieved. The DSS, by providing up-to-date information on 
the current status of flows in the rivers, the availability of surface water and irrigation requirements 
in the ayacuts, will facilitate decision-making by WRD to reallocate surface water more equitably 
and more efficiently to maximize productivity.   
In some years the volume of water stored in the Stanley Reservoir at Mettur Dam is not 
21. 
adequate  to  meet  irrigation  requirements  for  the  whole  cropping  season.  Under  those 
circumstances, rationing of water releases is needed. The DSS could support WRD decisions on 
58 
Appendix B 
optimal releases to minimize crop losses, making use of data in the DSS on cropped areas, crop 
water requirements, water transmission efficiencies and the other related data. 
22. 
If shortfalls are expected, the DSS could provide guidance on likely reduction in crop yields 
for a given supply strategy – for example share deficit evenly over all potential planted areas and 
throughout the full growing season, or advise a reduction in cropped area to match the available 
water resources and spread supply throughout the full irrigation season. 
The DSS could also provide short-term guidance on distribution of water within the system.  
23. 
For example, if rain is forecast (or occurs) re-evaluate the irrigation water requirements based on 
estimated  soil  moisture  conditions  following  the  rain  then  reduce  irrigation  water  requirements 
through the canal  system  accordingly  (perhaps making  use  of temporary  storage in reservoirs 
and tanks within the irrigation system at the same time as reducing releases from Mettur). 
24. 
It could also take into consideration actual water stress in the region (if suitable monitoring 
systems were to be set up) so that irrigation water supply could be sent to areas suffering more 
than others to relieve such stress. The DSS could advise from such data what the scheduling of 
flows in each canal at each regulator should be – and what gate settings should be. 
25. 
Incorporation  of  an  asset  management  component  in  the  DSS  would  enable  problem 
reports  and  maintenance  requirements  to  be  logged  in  a  systematic  manner  to  support  more 
effective planning and efficient implementation of maintenance. Maintenance requirements that 
impact on operations would be automatically reflected in the operating guidance provided by the 
DSS. 
b. 
Management of Flood Flows 
26. 
The network of telemetered rain gauges, weather stations and flow gauges can be used 
to  forecast  and  manage  flood  conditions.  The  telemetry  system  will  be  capable  of  real-time 
reporting of: 
(i) 
(ii) 
Water levels and flows within the canal system to inform decisions on the timely 
operation of control structures  
Expected inflows to the system – both at the head of the system (main river) and 
the drainage from land within the irrigated area 
(iii) 
Sea water levels or downstream water levels as appropriate 
(iv) 
The state of groundwater and surface water storage in the catchment 
27. 
The  DSS  forecasts  of  critical  water  levels  in  the  channels  will  be  based  on  statistical 
correlations between water levels at the head regulators and water levels in downstream flood 
zones. A potential further development of the DSS would replace the statistical correlations by 
forecasting models (rainfall-runoff, hydraulic and water balance models) to give forecasted water 
levels and flows within the system (forecasts are updated as real time data is received).The flood 
management function of the DSS would: 
(i) 
Provide links to 1-6 day rainfall estimates from appropriate web-sites e.g. the India 
Meteorological Department, 
Appendix B  
59 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
(v) 
Forecast flows in the Cauvery River at Grand Anicut up to 6 days ahead (through 
statistical  correlation  between  observed  levels/flows)–  implying  that  a  routing 
model is required (either a hydrodynamic model or a routing model) 
Forecast flows and water levels at key locations in the Vennar and Cauvery Rivers 
in  the  delta  up  to  6  days  ahead  using  the  CAVSCD  hydrologic  and  hydraulic 
models prepared by the PPTA and PTAC consultant with forecast rainfall from the 
IMD and real-time data from the telemetric monitoring stations, 
 modelling such as SWAT, eWater Source, HEC-HMS or NAM (models such as 
HEC-HMS or NAM become more appropriate at short time intervals) 
For  assumed  flood  management  flow  distribution  for  this  6  day  period,  and 
assumed operation of tail sluices, estimated water levels within the canal/drainage 
system at key locations and for the three day forecast 
(vi) 
Identify river embankments where water levels are expected to exceed top levels 
and indicate the likely extent, depth and duration of flooding, 
The DSS would support rapid assessment of alternative strategies for regulator operations 
28. 
to direct flood flows away from vulnerable assets and minimise the impact of flooding 
D. 
Training of WRD Staff  
Training and capacity development of WRD planning and operation staff will be required 
29. 
to introduce them to the concept and capabilities of the DSS and then progressively enhance their 
ability to use the system in the execution of their daily  workload. The training will also provide 
opportunity  for  feedback  on  the  DSS  capabilities  and  development  of  the  user  interface  (for 
example, additional reports and graphs).  
30. 
Provision would be included within the DSS development contract for ongoing support and 
refinement of the DSS in response to user requirements and suggestions to ensure that the DSS 
becomes an integral part of the system operation and maintenance. 
31. 
Specific  WRD  staff  will  be  given  training  in  operation  and  maintenance  of  the  system 
hardware  (including  the  field  equipment)  and  software  although  it  is  envisaged  that  primary 
responsibly for the DSS operation and maintenance during the project implementation period will 
rest with the supplier. Training in the use of the ultrasonic flow measurement equipment would 
also be provided by the hydrologist in the project technical advisory consultants. 
Beyond  this,  an  overall  capacity  building  program  in  climate-resilient  integrated  water 
32. 
resources management would be provided for WRD staff. In addition to training on the DSS tools 
described above, WRD staff would gain knowledge and upgraded skills in using climate change 
projections, using the new criteria for engineering designs prepared through the setting up and 
using hydraulic and hydrologic modelling for design and planning, flood forecasting and warning, 
and how to work with farmers to manage their surface water and groundwater resources.

Calibration of Regulator Discharges 
34. 
To  promote  fairly  accurate  decisions  on  releasing  flow  through  various  channels  it 
becomes important to generate a simple model of discharge rating calibration. The gate rating 
calibration involves measuring the actual discharge using flow meter reading and cross section 
of the river at a reasonable distance downstream of the regulator over the widest possible range. 
Each discharge value will reflect a different gate opening (or combination of gate openings where 
Appendix B  
61 
there are multiple gates) condition. A coefficient of discharge Cd (Cd is the ratio of actual flow 
rate to theoretical discharge) is calculated for each set of measurements. The flow measurements 
would be obtained using Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers to be procured under the project. 
Such  an  approach  will  be developed  by  experts  in the  PTAC  working    alongside WRD 
35. 
staff, using feedback from current day-to-day operations and processes to help develop an “expert 
system” that fully reflects the extent of information needed by those making operational decisions 
for the system management. The spreadsheet (or other simple computational tool such as a tablet 
or  smartphone  app)  could  be  adapted  to  incorporate  improvements  made  to the canal  system 
under  the  project  and  become  a  “live”  system  capable  of regular  revision to  incorporate future 
changes. 
d. 
Water Schedule Calendar 
36. 
This is a practical spreadsheet-based approach to the management of irrigation schemes 
in  the  Vennar  system  using  a  calendar  of  projected  crop  water  requirements  to  plan  irrigation 
schedules well in advance. The spreadsheet would provide a calendar of gross and net irrigation 
requirements for a target command area based on planned cropped areas and crop calendars 
and  normal  rates  evapotranspiration.  The  spreadsheet  could  then  be  updated  contingent  on 
actual rainfall, evapotranspiration and availability of groundwater and surface water in the rivers 
and  local  tanks  in  order  to  improve  canal  operations.  While  the  spreadsheet  may  be  initially 
developed as a stand-alone tool, it would be advisable to have this facility incorporated into the 
DSS database software so that the foundation data are automatically provided. 
e. 
Asset Register 
37. 
The DSS requires knowledge of the infrastructure (channels, regulators, etc., which forms 
the water distribution system with their hydraulic connectivity and operating parameters so that 
the system can determine operational recommendations. An enhancement of this inventory is to 
include provision for the maintenance status so that the DSS becomes the system for recording 
problems  and  the  maintenance  status.  The  DSS  will  also  require  data  for  catchments  and 
command areas

Appendix D: Detailed Terms of Reference for Project Technical Advisory Consultants, 
Project Implementation Consultants, NGO/CBO services for implementation of 
Resettlement plan, External Resettlement Monitor, and Internal Audit Firm 
TERMS OF REFERENCE 
PROJECT TECHNICAL ADVISORY CONSULTANTS 
A. 
Background 
1. 
These terms of reference (TOR) outline the scope of works, deliverables and work project 
for  the  Project  Technical  Advisory  Consultants  (PTAC).  The  PTAC  will  support  the  Water 
Resources  Department,  Tamil  Nadu  implement  the  Climate  Adaptation  in  Vennar  Subbasin  in 
Cauvery Delta. The expected outcome is improved water management in the Vennar Subbasin. 
The  project  comprises  two  outputs:  (i)  flood  risk  management  and  irrigation  infrastructure 
upgraded, and (ii) improved water and flood risk management systems established. 
2. 
Agriculture is the dominant employment sector in Tamil Nadu and it provides livelihoods 
for  nearly  45%  of  the  population.  However,  the  sector’s  contribution  to  state  gross  domestic 
product (GDP) fell from 11.1% in 2004-05 to 8.2% in 2010-11.1 Estimated total water demand in 
Tamil Nadu in 2001 was 54,395 MCM mainly for irrigation (50,007 MCM), industry/power/livestock 
(2,192  MCM)  and  drinking  (1,445  MCM)  compared  to  an  estimated  annual  water  potential 
including surface (24,864 MCM) and groundwater (22,423 MCM) is assessed of 46,540 MCM.2 
While the total demand is forecast to go up to 57,725 MCM by 2050, usage for irrigation is not 
expected to increase significantly because of demand for land for urbanization. 
3. 
There are 17 major river basins in the state, of which the Cauvery basin (81,115 km²) is 
the largest. About 90% of surface water is used in irrigation. The Cauvery River basin spans the 
states of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and part of the Union Territory of Pondicherry. According 
to the decision of the Cauvery Waters Dispute Tribunal in 2007, 58% (11,865 MCM in an average 
year) of the surface water resources of the basin are allocated to Tamil Nadu. The total potential 
irrigation demand in the Cauvery delta,3 excluding irrigation demand upstream of the delta and 
other water uses, exceeds the available resource. 
4.  The  Cauvery  Delta  (6900  km²)  has  a  total  population  of  about  4.8  million,  with  about  73% 
relying on farming and fishing. There are four main irrigation systems in the delta: (i) Lower 
Coleroon  Anicut  (53,000  ha),  (ii)  Cauvery  (200,000  ha),  (iii)  Vennar  (190,000  ha),  and  (iv) 
Grand  Anicut  (121,000  ha).  Key  constraints  faced  by  the  Cauvery  Delta  farmers  are:  (i) 
difficulty in planning of annual cropping pattern due to the lack of assurance about surface 
water availability; (ii) inefficient distribution and application of water; (iii) inequitable access to 
water resources with downstream users have intermittent access to surface water and poor 
access to suitable quality groundwater, (iv) crop damage during the north east monsoon due 
to  flooding  and  poor  drainage  in  coastal  areas.  The  three  districts  in  the  Vennar  System

5. 
Climate change is expected to worsen the already challenging situation. The projections 
indicate much drier conditions between January and May but wetter and warmer conditions during 
the  irrigation  season  (June  to  December).  However  the  climate  projections  also  show  large 
increases  in  storm  rainfall  and  runoff.  Therefore  more  frequent  and  serious  flooding  can  be 
expected. Flooding in coastal areas will gradually be exacerbated by rising sea levels. 
The  key  management  issues  facing  the  water  resources  sector  are:  (i)  inadequate

in  resource  management,  (ii) 
The Project will contribute to the initial improvement of water resources management in

B. 
The Project 
8. 
The project comprises two outputs: (i) flood risk management and irrigation infrastructure 
upgraded, and (ii) improved water and flood risk management systems established. Under Output 
1,  the  project  will  support  the  (i)  repair  and  upgrading  of  existing  infrastructure  including 
embankments  designed  to  withstand  a  25  year  return  flood  taking  into  consideration  climate 
change projections, and (ii) construction of new essential infrastructure.  
Output 2 will deliver non-structural adaptations designed to improve the management of 
9. 
surface  water  resources,  and  manage flood  risks  and flood  events.  Initiatives to be  developed 
are: (i) improved assessment of water resources through installation of additional rainfall, surface 
water  level,  groundwater  level  and  tide  level  monitoring  stations  and  through  direct  flow 
measurements  at  key  structures,  (ii)  development  of  a  Decision  Support  System  (DSS)  and 
(iii) capacity development of Water Resources Department officers in improved management of 
water  resources.  The  improvements  to  management  of  flood  risks  and  flood  events  will  be 
achieved through establishment of flood forecasting and warning systems and preparation of flood 
risk maps. 
C. 
Implementation Arrangements 
The  executing  agency  is  the Water  Resources  Department  and  a  Project  Management

Background 
These  terms  of  reference  (TOR)  outline  the  scope  of  works,  deliverables  and  work 
1. 
program for the Project Implementation Consultancy team, who will support the Water Resources 
Department, Tamil Nadu implement the Climate Adaptation in Vennar Subbasin in Cauvery Delta. 
The  expected  outcome  is  improved  water  management  in  the  Vennar  system.  The  project 
comprises two outputs: (i) flood risk management and irrigation infrastructure upgraded, and (ii) 
improved water and flood risk management systems established. 
2. 
Agriculture is the dominant employment sector in Tamil Nadu and it provides livelihoods 
for nearly 45% of the population. However, the sector’s contribution to state GDP fell from 11.1% 
in 2004-05 to 8.2% in 2010-11.1 Estimated total water demand in Tamil Nadu in 2001 was 54,395 
MCM  mainly  for  irrigation  (50,007  MCM),  industry/power/livestock  (2,192  MCM)  and  drinking 
(1,445 MCM) compared to an estimated annual water potential including surface (24,864 MCM) 
and groundwater (22,423 MCM) is assessed of 46,540 MCM.2 While the total demand is forecast 
to go  up to 57,725  MCM  by  2050,  usage for  irrigation  is  not  expected to increase  significantly 
because of demand for land for urbanization. 
There are 17 major river basins in the state, of which the Cauvery basin (81,115 km²) is 
3. 
the largest. About 90% of surface water is used in irrigation. The Cauvery river basin spans the 
states of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and part of the Union Territory of Pondicherry. According 
to the decision of the Cauvery Waters Dispute Tribunal in 2007, 58% (11,865 MCM in an average 
year) of the surface water resources of the basin are allocated to Tamil Nadu. The total potential 
irrigation demand in the Cauvery delta,3 excluding irrigation demand upstream of the delta and 
other water uses, exceeds the available resource. 
The Cauvery Delta (6900 km²) has a total population of about 4.8 million, with about 73% 
4. 
relying  on  farming  and  fishing.  There  are  four  main  irrigation  systems  in  the  delta:  (i)  Lower 
Coleroon Anicut (53,000 ha), (ii) Cauvery (200,000 ha), (iii) Vennar (190,000 ha), and (iv) Grand 
Anicut  (121,000  ha).  Key  constraints  faced  by  the  Cauvery  Delta  farmers  are:  (i)  difficulty  in 
planning of annual cropping pattern due to the lack of assurance about surface water availability; 
(ii) inefficient distribution and application of water; (iii) inequitable access to water resources with 
downstream users have intermittent access to surface water and poor access to suitable quality 
groundwater, (iv) crop damage during the north east monsoon due to flooding and poor drainage 
in coastal areas.  The three districts in the Vennar System (Thanjavur, Thiruvarur, Nagapattinam) 
record the lowest average rice productivity in Tamil Nadu. 
5. 
Climate change is expected to worsen the already challenging situation. The projections 
indicate much drier conditions between January and May but wetter and warmer conditions during 
the  irrigation  season  (June  to  December).  However  the  climate  projections  also  show  large 
increases  in  storm  rainfall  and  runoff.  Therefore  more  frequent  and  serious  flooding  can  be 
expected. Flooding in coastal areas will gradually be exacerbated by rising sea levels.

in  resource  management,  (ii) 
The long standing Cauvery water dispute prevented substantial investments in the sector. 
7. 
Since the Cauvery Waters Dispute Tribunal ruling in 2007 on allocating 58% of the surface water 
resources  was  upheld  by  the  Supreme  Court  in  2013,  the  state  government  formulated 
investments plans for the modernization of the irrigation systems. These include improvements 
to  water  resources  management  and  increased  climate  resilience  of  water  services  in  the 
subbasin. 
The Project will contribute to the initial improvement of water resources management in 
8. 
the Cauvery Delta. 
B. 
The Project 
The project comprises two outputs: (i) flood risk management and irrigation infrastructure 
9. 
upgraded, and (ii) improved water and flood risk management systems established. Under Output 
1,  the  project  will  support  the  (i)  repair  and  upgrading  of  existing  infrastructure  including 
embankments  designed  to  withstand  a  25  year  return  flood  taking  into  consideration  climate 
change projections, and (ii) construction of new essential infrastructure.  
10. 
Output 2 will deliver non-structural adaptations designed to improve the management of 
surface water resources, and (ii) manage flood risks and flood events. Initiatives to be developed 
are: (ii) improved assessment of water resources through installation of additional rainfall, surface 
water  level,  groundwater  level  and  tide  level  monitoring  stations  and  through  direct  flow 
measurements at key structures, (ii) development of a Decision Support System (DSS), initially 
piloted in the Pandavayar, Vellaiyar and Harichandra channels, and then conditionally to the rest 
of the area and (iii) capacity development of Water Resources Department officers in improved 
management  of  water  resources.  The  improvements  to  management  of  flood  risks  and  flood 
events  will  be  achieved  through  establishment  of  flood  forecasting  and  warning  systems  and 
preparation of flood risk maps. 
C. 
Implementation Arrangements

Appendix F: Stakeholder Communications Plan 
A. 
Objective and Principles 
The  objective  of  the  Stakeholder  Communications  Plan  (SCP)  is  to  describe  how  the 
1. 
project  will  ensure  meaningful  participation  of  all  stakeholders  in  project  implementation  and 
monitoring. The SCP recognizes that beneficiaries participate from different starting points and 
cultural  experience,  and  that  this  has  implications  on  how  beneficiaries  will  participate  and 
contribute. 
2. 
A  fundamental  principle  of  participation  is  that  all  legitimate  stakeholders  be  heard,  in 
particular, women and other disadvantaged groups that have traditionally been excluded, such 
that benefits reach the broadest possible cross section of people. This ensures that the project 
will  be  designed  and  implemented  as  per  the  needs,  capacities  and  constraints  of  those 
benefiting.  
Effective participation of various stakeholders will be achieved by keeping them informed 
3. 
of project activities and involving them in decisions that affect them. Dissemination of information 
and seeking ideas and opinions of stakeholders is built into the SCP.   
B. 
Stakeholder Analysis and Key Areas for Participation 
4. 
Stakeholder  analysis  is  the  means  to  identify  types  of  stakeholders  acting  at  different 
levels  to develop  and implement the  project. These groups  interact  within communities and  at

facilitated under the project. The Project Management Unit will monitor the CPC Plan and will be 
expected to report on the status of implementation of each of the activities listed below in their 
progress reports and during ADB review missions. Stakeholder interests and needs may change 
during the implementation period, and if so the activities needed to engage various stakeholders 
will also change. The PMU will update the CPC Plan as necessary. 
7. 
Project  Management  Unit  (PMU).  The  PMU  will  be  responsible  for  developing  and 
maintaining a project website that includes up-to-date information about the project and status of 
implementation. It will produce posters and brochures for wide dissemination of the project. It will 
ensure targeted information is prepared for households affected and identified in the resettlement 
plan.

Project  Implementation  Unit  (PIU).  The  PIU  is  responsible  for  monitoring  of 
implementation of resettlement and environmental management plans,  organizing the Channel 
Stakeholder  Groups,  and  conducting  general  stakeholder  consultations,  and  organizing  and 
ensuring the grievance redress committees are established and operational at the district level. 
The PIU will organize regular consultations with farmers in the pilot area or the conjunctive use 
scheme. 
Field  Implementation  Coordination  Committee  (FICC).  An  FICC  will  be  formed  in

Thiruvarur and Nagapattinam districts. Chaired by the relevant district collector, with the district 
revenue  officer  as  the  vice  chair  ,  the  FICC  includes  representatives  of  other  district-level 
stakeholder  agencies  (agriculture,  fisheries,  disaster  management,  environment,  and  local 
roads),  and chairperson of channel stakeholder groups. The PMU will use the FICC platform to 
report  in  FICC  project  status,  facilitate  coordination  among  government  agencies,  and  hear 
feedback from district-level stakeholders.
