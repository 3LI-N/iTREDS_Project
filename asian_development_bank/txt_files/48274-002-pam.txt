Project Administration Manual Purpose and Process 
The  project  administration  manual  (PAM)  describes  the  essential  administrative  and 
management requirements to implement the project on time, within budget, and in accordance 
with the government’s and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) policies and procedures. The 
PAM  should  include  references  to  all  available  templates  and  instructions  either  through 
linkages to relevant URLs or directly incorporated in the PAM. 
The Zuoquan County Government, the executing agency; the four implementing agencies—the 
Zuoquan  Water  Resource  Bureau;  the  Zuoquan  Housing  Security,  and  Urban  and  Rural 
Construction and Management Bureau; the Zuoquan Shixia Reservoir Management Office; and 
the  Zuoquan  Forestry  Bureau—are  wholly  responsible  for  the  implementation  of  the  ADB-
financed project, as agreed jointly between the borrower and ADB, and in accordance with the 
government’s  and  ADB  policies  and  procedures.  The  ADB  staff  is  responsible  to  support 
implementation, including compliance by the Zuoquan County Government, of their obligations 
and responsibilities for project implementation in accordance with ADB policies and procedures. 
1.  At loan negotiations, the borrower and ADB shall agree to the PAM; and ensure consistency 
with  the  legal  agreements.  Such  agreements  shall  be  reflected  in  the  minutes  of  the  loan 
negotiations. In the event of any discrepancy or contradiction between the PAM and the legal 
agreements, the provisions of the legal agreements shall prevail. 
2.  After  ADB  Board’s  approval  of  the  project’s  report  and  recommendations  of  the  President, 
changes in implementation arrangements are subject to agreement and approval pursuant to 
relevant government and ADB’s administrative procedures (including the project administration 
instructions); and upon such approval, they will be subsequently incorporated in the PAM. 
I. 
PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
A. 
Rationale 
Rapid  economic  development  in  the  People’s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  has  led  to  its 
1. 
severe ecological and environmental degradation. To address these issues while continuing to 
eliminate  absolute  poverty,  the  Government  of  the  PRC  has  been  promoting  ecological 
civilization1 and has specificied targets in its Thirteenth Five-Year Plan on National Economic and 
Social Development, 2016–2020.2 Water resources protection and flood risk mitigation are key 
elements of ecological civilization and effective means for poverty reduction. The government has 
identified  Zuoquan  County,  a  national-level  poverty  county  in  the  water-scarce  and  heavily 
polluted Hai River basin, as an integral part of the ecological belt for Shanxi Province. Assistance 
to Zuoquan County is expected to demonstrate the ability and merits of working at county level to 
advance the government’s goal of ecological civilization and poverty reduction.  
2. 
Zuoquan County is in the Hai River basin, bordering Hebei Province on the east. It has a 
population of 165,042 (in 2015), 57% of which is rural. The county’s mean annual precipitation is 
520 millimeters, with more than 70% of rainfall occurring from June to September; and its average 
annual evaporation is 1,620 millimeters. With 33% of its population being poor, Zuoquan County 
is  designated  as  a  national-level  poverty  county.  About  98%  of  Zuoquan  County  is  in  the 
Qingzhang watershed. Originating in the county, the Qingzhang River flows into the Zhang River 
in Hebei Province—a tributary of the Hai River. The Qingzhang River, together with the Shixia 
and Xiajiaozhang reservoirs, is a strategic water source for 1.92 million people in Shanxi Province. 
As an important source for the Hai River basin, the water quality of Qingzhang River also bears 
significantly on the water safety of 1.2 million people in the downstream areas in Hebei and Henan 
provinces. 
3. 
Soil  erosion  and  sedimentation.  Located  on  the  Loess  Plateau,  Zuoquan  County 
experiences serious soil erosion, with over 50% of its land eroded to some degree. The vegetation 
coverage  of  the  Qingzhang  River’s  upstream  catchment  is  generally  good,  but  the  vegetation 
condition for areas near villages and towns and along the roads is poor. Heavy rain has caused 
soil erosion from these areas with little or without coverage. Soil erosion also comes from non-
protected river banks. Sediment from soil erosion has resulted in siltation of rivers, streams, and 
reservoirs. According to the record of Zuoquan Shixia Reservoir Management Office from 1990 
to 2013, the total accumulated siltation volume during these 23 years was 345,000 cubic meters 
(m3),  with  an  average  siltation  volume  of  15,000  m3  per  year.  Siltation  of  the  reservoir 
compromises its flood control function and reduces the water storage capacity. Soil erosion also 
impairs other vital ecosystem services. Projected increases in storm intensities will likely increase 
the risk of soil erosion. 
Flood risks. Zuoquan County suffers from frequent floods because of lack of adequate 
4. 
infrastructure. Riverine floods occur in most sections of the Qingzhang River at a flood frequency 
of one in 5 years. The main urban section contains a structural embankment whereas rural areas 
only have isolated earth bunds. Bank protection for both sides of the river in the west district (a 
new  city  district  under  development)  is  almost  nonexistent  —a  few  earth  bunds  built  from  the 
1950s to the 1980s are in dilapidated conditions, and some have been washed down to the river, 
1  Ecological  civilization  refers  to  achieving  harmony  between  growth,  people,  and  nature.  It  includes  activities  to 
mitigate  ecological  damage,  relieve  pressures  on  natural  resources,  and  improve  the  balance  between  the 
environment and the economy.

Development. Beijing.

causing  severe  blockages.  Flood  risks  are  heightened  by  the  projected  increase  in  climate-
induced  storm  intensities.  A  major  flood  in  August  1996  caused  huge  losses,  affecting  about 
100,000 people in all 10 townships in Zuoquan County. About 9,000 houses were destroyed, and 
nearly 140,000 mu of cropland were damaged.3 The flood caused more than 30 deaths and 550 
injuries. Flooding not only poses a significant risk to people’s lives, but is also a key restraining 
factor of sustainable development in Zuoquan County. 
5. 
Low quality and inadequate water supply. The separate planning process and different 
ownership  structures  for  water  management  in  Zuoquan  County  have  resulted  in  serious 
development  gaps  in  water  supply  facilities.  Zuoquan  County  has  functioning  water  supply 
facilities to its 60,000 residents in the county’s urban center. However, the water supply to rural 
residents is lacking or of poor quality without any treatment. The water supply pipes are also aged 
and leaking. Further, though they have permits to withdraw water from the Shixia Reservoir, most 
rural  enterprises  use  groundwater  without  adequate  infrastructure  to  access  surface  water, 
resulting in the depletion and unsustainable use of groundwater. These rural enterprises, which 
hire over 90% of local villagers, are an important income source for rural farmers. Inequitable and 
unsafe  water  supply  is  inconsistent  with  socially  inclusive  development,  and  hinders  the 
government’s goal of urban–rural integration.  
6. 
Insufficient  wastewater  collection  and  treatment.  The  wastewater  collection  and 
treatment capacity in Zuoquan County cannot meet the demand of increasing urbanization. Like 
elsewhere in the PRC, urbanization has been a key driver of development and economic growth. 
However,  continuous  rapid  urbanization  puts  significant  pressure  on  scarce  land  and  natural 
resources, and contributes to pollution for Zuoquan County. Some sewer networks are aged and 
leaking, causing pollution to the Qingzhang River. Key issues include (i) wastewater overflowing 
from some flow interceptors into the Qingzhang River, even in the dry season; (ii) the trunk sewer 
leaking  directly  into  the Qingzhang  River,  as  it  is  laid  along  the  river; (iii)  the Zuoquan  County 
wastewater  treatment  plant  facing  frequent  equipment  breakdowns;  and  (iv)  the  capacities  of 
wastewater collection and treatment being unable to meet current and future needs. 
7. 
Lack of ecosystem-friendly infrastructure connecting urban center and new district. 
Zuoquan  County’s  urban  development  master  plan  expected  the  urban  population  to  grow  to 
about 82,000 in 2020 and 113,000 in 2030.4 The urbanization rate is projected to increase to 62% 
in 2030. The existing Binhe Road, a trunk road connecting the urban center to the new district in 
peri-urban and rural areas, cannot satisfy current and increasing traffic demands. The east section 
of the Binhe Road has reached its design capacity, while the west section of about 5 kilometers 
(km) is yet to be expanded to meet the demand. Moreover, the storm water pipe and the trunk 
sewer to the new district need to be installed concurrently along the Binhe Road—as an integrated 
approach to improving water resources management together with road improvement—which will 
be cheaper than constructing them separately. The Binhe Road provides unique opportunity to 
pilot test the government’s sponge city initiative, which will not only help slow down surface runoff 
but also reduce nonpoint source pollution from urban runoff.5 The experience gained will be used 
for Zuoquan County’s new urban district development. 
Weak  institutional  capacity.  Zuoquan  County’s  water  resources  management  is 
8. 
fragmented, lacking a coordinated and integrated approach to land use planning, and urban and

5  The sponge city initiative is the government’s policy to promote water conservation. A key principle is to minimize the 
impact of urban development on the natural water cycle through green infrastructure such as preserved floodplains, 
storm water wetlands, retention ponds, sunken parks, bio-retention swales, seepage wells, and green roofs. 
3 
rural development. The urban and rural water supply systems are separate, with large gaps in 
water  quality  and  service  reliability.  Zuoquan  County’s  capacity  for  project  planning  and 
implementation  is  weak  since  it  has  little  experience  with  international  organizations.  The 
counterpart staff of the project do not have experience in implementing Asian Development Bank 
(ADB)  projects  and  are  unfamiliar  with  ADB  procedures  and  requirements.  The  current  flood-
warning  system  is  inadequate  and  cannot  provide  effective  and  timely  warnings  to  rural 
communities. 
Strategic fit. The project is aligned with the PRC’s Thirteenth Five-Year Plan on National 
9. 
Economic  and  Social  Development,  2016–2020  for  integrated  urban–rural  development  and 
ecological civilization (footnote 2). It is also consistent with Zuoquan County’s urban development 
master plan (footnote 3). The project conforms to the strategic priorities of ADB’s Midterm Review 
of Strategy 2020;6 and is aligned with ADB’s country partnership strategy for the PRC, 2016–2020 
for managing climate change and the environment, and supporting inclusive economic growth.7 
It also conforms to ADB’s Water Operational Plan, 2011–2020 to increase coverage and improve 
services for water supply and sanitation, and promote integrated water resources management.8 
10. 
Lessons. The project design has incorporated lessons from good practices in integrated 
water resources management financed by ADB and other international development agencies. 
Major lessons include (i) an integrated management approach, incorporating cross-sector water 
resources  management,  urbanization,  and  environmental  issues  (including  projected  climate 
change  impacts);  (ii)  the  inclusion  of  nonstructural  measures  and  community  participation  in 
addition  to  structural  interventions;  (iii)  coordinated  management  of  urban–rural  planning,  and 
management of resources and services to facilitate integration and linkage to infrastructure; and 
(iv) provision of trainings to strengthen government agencies.

A. 
Financial Management Assessment 
V. 
FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT 
29. 
The  financial  management  assessment  (FMA)  was  conducted  in  September  2016  in 
accordance with ADB’s Guidelines for the Financial Management and Analysis of Projects11 and 
the Financial Due Diligence: A Methodology Note.12 The instrument used for the assessment was 
ADB’s FMA questionnaire.  
30. 
The FMA considered the capacity of the executing and implementing agencies, including 
fund flow arrangements, staffing, accounting and financial reporting systems, financial information 
systems, and internal and external auditing arrangements.  
31. 
The  executing  agency,  the  Zuoquan  County  Government  (ZCG),  does  not  have 
experience in the preparation, implementation, and management of projects funded by ADB. The 
Zuoquan  County  Finance  Bureau  (ZCFB)  is  responsible,  on  behalf  of  ZCG,  for  (i)  financial 
management of the project, including the ADB loan withdrawal applications and payments; and 
(ii) overseeing the ADB loan repayment and the counterpart fund arrangements for the project. 
32. 
The  Shanxi  Provincial  Finance  Department  (SPFD)  will  operate  and  administer  the 
advance account and will be responsible for applications and withdrawals of the ADB loan. SPFD 
has many years of experience in these activities and in the general financial oversight of the ADB- 
and World Bank-funded projects.  
33. 
The implementing agencies will be the Zuoquan Housing Security, and Urban and Rural 
Construction  and  Management  Bureau  (ZHCB),  the  Zuoquan  Shixia  Reservoir  Management 
Office  (ZSRMO),  the  Zuoquan  Water  Resource  Bureau  (ZWRB),  and  the  Zuoquan  Forestry 
Bureau; and they are also ZCG’s agencies. The project implementation offices (PIOs) established 
by each implementing agency will be responsible for the day-to-day implementation, organization, 
and  management  of  the  project  components. They  are  also  responsible  for  the  daily  financial 
management of subprojects, including project accounting, financial statements preparation, the 
ADB loan withdrawal and payment, and the counterpart fund withdrawal and payment. 
34. 
ZCFB  has  adequate  financial  staff,  accounting  policies  and  procedures,  internal  and 
external controls, audit arrangements, and reporting system. ZCFB does not have experience on 
ADB projects. Meanwhile, the designated Financing Division, which is  responsible for the ADB 
project  management,  also  does  not  have  experience  on  project  management,  including 
accounting.  The  comprehensive  training  and  support  is  required  on  the  ADB  policies  and 
procedures, 
including  project  management;  disbursement,  procurement,  and  safeguard 
procedures; and accounting. 
35. 
The implementing agencies have sound financial management systems which can meet 
the  minimum  financial  management  requirements  for  their  current  activities.  But  significant 
training and support will also be required on the ADB policies and procedures, including project 
management; disbursement, procurement, and safeguard procedures; and accounting.

36. 
(ii) 
The assessment identified the main financial management risks to include the following: 
(i) 
Implementation risk. Lack of familiarity with the ADB disbursement procedures 
and requirements which could delay project implementation; 
Compliance  risk.  Lack  of  familiarity  with  the  ADB  financial  management 
requirements,  particularly  relating  to  accounting,  reporting,  and  auditing,  which 
may  delay  project  reporting  and  the  identification  of  issues  on  the  use  of  loan 
proceeds; 
Financing risk. Delays in provision of, or inadequate counterpart funding which 
could delay project implementation; and  
Construction and operational risk. Inadequate experience in construction and 
operation  management,  which  will  impact  project  progress  and  quality  of  the 
services to be provided after project completion.  
(iv) 
(iii) 
37. 
The overall financial management risk rating of the project before considering mitigating 
measures  is  moderate.  The  identified  financial  management  risks  and  the  implementation  of 
agreed mitigation measures need to be closely monitored during project implementation.  
38. 
The proposed financial management action plan includes the following:  
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
(v) 
covenants  in loan agreements  to  ensure adequate counterpart funds to support 
capital, O&M, and debt repayment requirements; 
training on the ADB disbursement procedures and requirements;  
training on the ADB financial management requirements, specifically accounting 
and reporting, auditing;  
close monitoring to quickly identify potential issues in counterpart funding; and  
a financial expert requirement and some professional engineers to be included in 
the  capacity  building  package  in  Output  4  of  the  project.  They  will  provide 
professional financial  management  and  engineering support  and  training for the 
financial and related staff in the project entities, including financial management 
manual development.

Advance Account 
  The  advance  account  will  be  established  and  maintained  by  the  Shanxi 
Provincial Finance Department, on behalf of the Shanxi Provincial Government, 
after the loan becomes effective; 
  The  Shanxi  Provincial  Government  will  be  responsible 
for 
the  use, 
management, replenishment, and liquidation of the advance account; 
  The  advance  account  will  be  exclusively  used  to  finance  the  Asian 
Development Bank’s share of eligible expenditures; and 
  The  outstanding  advance  (initial  advance  and  subsequent  deposits)  to  the 
advance  account  should  not  exceed  the  executing  agency’s  estimate  of  the 
Asian Development Bank’s share of eligible expenditures for the next 6 months 
which are to be paid through the advance account.

Disbursement Arrangements for ADB Funds 
40. 
The  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  Loan  Disbursement 
Handbook  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time),13 and  detailed  arrangements  agreed  upon 
between ADB and the government. Online training for project staff on disbursement policies and 
procedures  is  available.14 The  project  staff  will  be  encouraged  to  avail  of  this  training  to  help 
ensure efficient disbursement and fiduciary control. 
The  implementing  agencies  will  be  responsible  for  all  disbursement  arrangements  for 
41. 
expenditures related to the implementation of subcomponents in Zuoquan County, including (i) 
preparing disbursement projections; (ii) requesting budgetary allocations for counterpart fund; (iii) 
collecting supporting documents; and (iv) preparing withdrawal applications that will be submitted 
to ADB by SPFD. 
42. 
Each year, necessary amount of counterpart funding is allocated by ZCG and disbursed 
upon request from the implementing agencies. For ADB’s loan proceeds, withdrawal applications 
will be prepared by the PMO on behalf of ZCG, and then submit to ADB through SPFD. At the 
end  of  each  year,  realistic  projections  of  the  contract  awards  and/or  commitments  and 
disbursements for the following calendar year will be made for an assessment and projection of 
the ADB funds required to cover the contract awards and/or commitments and disbursements for 
ongoing loans. The PMO will be responsible for preparing the contract award and/or commitment 
and disbursement projections each year. 
43. 
Direct payment procedure will generally be used for large civil works, equipment contracts, 
and  consulting  service  contracts.  Reimbursement  procedure  will  also  be  used  as  appropriate 
when the government initially funds ADB’s eligible expenditures from its own resources. 
44. 
Advance fund procedure. To facilitate project implementation and fund flow upon loan 
effectiveness,  SPFD  on  behalf  of  the  Shanxi  Provincial  Government  (SPG)  will  establish  the 
advance account at a commercial bank acceptable to ADB. The loan funds from ADB will be paid 
from the SPFD advance account to implementing agencies through pass-through accounts based 
on  expenditures  incurred.  Expenditures  not  using  the  advance  account  may  use  other 
disbursement  procedures,  such  as  direct  payment  (to the  supplier  or contractor),  commitment, 
and reimbursement. 
45. 
The currency of the advance account will be United States dollar. The advance account 
is  to  be  used  exclusively  for  ADB’s  share  of  eligible  expenditures.  SPG,  through  SPFD  which 
established the advance account under its name, is accountable and responsible for the proper 
use  of  advances  to  the  advance  account.  SPG,  through  SPFD,  may  request  for  initial  and 
additional  advances  to  the  advance  account  based  on  estimate  of  ADB’s  share  of  eligible 
expenditures to be financed through the advance account for the next 6 months. The advance 
account  will  be  established,  managed,  and  liquidated  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  Loan 
Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time) and other detailed arrangements 
agreed  by  ADB  and  the  government.  The  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  describes  which 
supporting documents should be submitted to ADB and which should be retained by SPG, through 
SPFD, for liquidation and replenishment of the advance account.

Statement  of  expenditure  procedure.  To  expedite  funds  flow  and  simplify  the 
46. 
documentation  process,  the  statement  of  expenditure  (SOE)  procedure  may  be  used  for 
liquidation and replenishment of the advance account; and reimbursement of eligible expenditures 
not  exceeding  $300,000  per  individual  payment.  Payments  exceeding  the  SOE  ceiling  will  be 
reimbursed, liquidated, or replenished based on full supporting documentation process. The SOE 
records should be maintained and made readily available for review by ADB’s disbursement and 
review missions; or upon ADB’s request for submission of supporting documents on a sampling 
basis, and for independent audit.15 
47. 
Before the submission of the first withdrawal application, SPG, through the SPFD and the 
PMO, should submit to ADB sufficient evidence of the authority of the person(s) who will sign the 
withdrawal applications on behalf of SPG, together with the authenticated specimen signatures 
of each authorized person. The minimum value per withdrawal application is in accordance with 
the  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (footnote  9).  Individual  payments  less  than  such  amount 
should be  paid  (i)  by the  executing  or  implementing  agencies,  and  subsequently  claimed  from 
ADB  through  reimbursement;  or  (ii)  through  the  advance  fund  procedure,  unless  otherwise 
accepted by ADB. 
2. 
Disbursement Arrangements for Counterpart Fund 
For the counterpart funds, the implementing agencies will timely allocate the designated 
48. 
funding for the project as specified in the loan and project agreements. Counterpart funds from 
the governments will be disbursed by the implementing agencies to contractors, service providers, 
and those affected by land acquisition and resettlement. The disbursement process will follow this 
process:  (i)  according  to  the  progress  of  the  contract,  the  implementing  agencies  will  submit 
disbursement request to the PMO; and (ii) once approved, counterpart funds will be disbursed 
from ZCFB. 
C. 
Accounting 
49. 
The  executing  agency  will  maintain,  or  cause  to  be  maintained,  separate  books  and 
records  by  funding  source  for  all  expenditures  incurred  on  the  project.  Consolidated  project 
financial statements will be prepared annually by ZCG through the PMO in accordance with the 
government’s accounting laws and regulations, which are consistent with international accounting 
principles and practices.16 
D. 
Auditing and Public Disclosure 
50. 
The executing agency will cause the detailed consolidated project financial statements to 
be audited in accordance with International Standards on Auditing and the Government Auditing 
Standards of the PRC (where these are consistent with International Standards on Auditing), by 
an independent auditor acceptable to ADB. The audited project financial statements together with 
the auditor’s opinion will be presented in the English language by the executing agency to ADB 
within 6 months from the end of the fiscal year.  
15 SOE forms are available in Appendix 7B of ADB’s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to 
time). 
16 Applicable  laws,  regulations,  and  guidelines  include  the  (i)  Accounting  Law  of  the  PRC  (2000);  (ii)  State-Owned 
Construction Enterprise Accounting Control Regulations; (iii) Capital Construction Financial Control Regulations; and 
(iv) Accounting Methods of Projects Financed by the World Bank. 
32 
The audit report for the project financial statements will include a management letter and 
51. 
auditor’s opinions, which cover (i) whether the project financial statements present an accurate 
and fair view or are presented fairly, in all material respects, in accordance with the applicable 
financial reporting standards; (ii) whether the proceeds of the loan were used only for the purposes 
of  the  project;  and  (iii)  whether  the  borrower  or  executing  agency  was  in  compliance  with  the 
financial covenants contained in the legal agreements, where applicable. 
52. 
Compliance with financial reporting and auditing requirements will be monitored by review 
missions and during normal program supervision, and followed up regularly with all concerned, 
including the external auditor.  
53. 
ZCG, the executing agency; and the implementing agencies have been made aware of 
ADB’s  approach  to  delayed  submission,  and  the  requirements  for  satisfactory  and  acceptable 
quality of the audited project financial statements.17 ADB reserves the right to require a change in 
the auditor (in a manner consistent with the constitution of the borrower); or for additional support 
to be provided to the auditor, if the audits required are not conducted in a manner satisfactory to 
ADB,  or  if  the  audits  are  substantially  delayed.  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  verify  the  project’s 
financial accounts to confirm that the share of ADB’s financing is used in accordance with ADB 
policies and procedures.  
Public disclosure of the audited project financial statements, including the auditor’s opinion 
54. 
on the project financial statements, will be guided by ADB’s Public Communications Policy 2011.  
After the review, ADB will disclose the audited project financial statements and the opinion of the 
auditors on the project financial statements no later than 14 days of ADB’s confirmation of their 
acceptability  by  posting  them  on  ADB’s  website.  The  management  letter,  additional  auditor’s 
opinions, and audited entity financial statements will not be disclosed.18 
17 ADB’s approach and procedures regarding delayed submission of audited project financial statements:  
(i)  When audited project financial statements are not received by the due date, ADB will write to the executing 
agency advising that (a) the audit documents are overdue; and (b) if they are not received within the next 6 
months, requests for new contract awards and disbursement such as new replenishment of advance accounts, 
processing of new reimbursement, and issuance of new commitment letters will not be processed. 
(ii)  When  audited  project  financial  statements  are  not  received  within  6  months  after  the  due  date,  ADB  will 
withhold processing of requests for new contract awards and disbursement such as new replenishment of 
advance accounts, processing of new reimbursement, and issuance of new commitment letters. ADB will (a) 
inform the executing agency of ADB’s actions; and (b) advise that the loan may be suspended if the audit 
documents are not received within the next 6 months. 
(iii)  When audited project financial statements are not received within 12 months after the due date, ADB may 
suspend the loan.

VI. 
PROCUREMENT AND CONSULTING SERVICES 
A. 
Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing 
ZCG  has  been  advised  that  retroactive  financing  may  only  apply  to  up  to  20%  of  the 
55. 
amount of the ADB loan in respect for expenditures incurred before loan effectiveness, but not 
earlier than 12 months before the signing of the loan and project agreements. The borrower, the 
executing agency, and the implementing agencies have been advised that approval of advance 
contracting  and  retroactive  financing  does  not  commit  ADB  to  finance  the  project.  Advance 
contracting and retroactive financing will be used for (i) water supply, (ii) revegetation, (iii) flood 
embankment, and (iv) consulting services. 
All  advance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  will  be  undertaken  in  conformity  with 
56. 
ADB’s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time)19 and ADB’s Guidelines on 
the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time).20 The issuance of invitations to bid 
under advance contracting and retroactive financing will be subject to ADB’s approval.  
B. 
Procurement of Goods, Works, and Consulting Services 
57. 
All  procurement  of  goods  and  works  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB’s 
Procurement  Guidelines  (2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time),  (footnote  19).  International 
competitive bidding (ICB) will be used for civil works contracts estimated to cost over $40 million. 
National competitive bidding (NCB) will be used for civil works contracts estimated to cost over 
$100,000 up to $40 million. For goods and equipment, ICB will be used for contracts valued at 
above $5 million; while NCB will be used for goods and equipment from over $100,000 up to $5 
million. 
A  procurement  plan  indicating goods,  works,  and  consulting service contract  packages 
58. 
and expected contract preparation and implementation timeline is in subsection C. 
59. 
All consultants financed by ADB will be recruited according to ADB’s Guidelines on the 
Use  of  Consultants  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time),  (footnote  20).21 An  estimated  171 
person-months (16 international, 155 national) of consulting services are required to (i) facilitate 
project  management  and  institutional  strengthening,  including  financial  management;  and 
environmental and social safeguards; (ii) conduct external resettlement and social monitoring; (iii) 
advise on initial project implementation support, including project management and procurement; 
(iv) conduct integrated urban–rural water supply capacity building; and (v) development of action 
plan for applying sponge city concept in the new district of Zuoquan. The PMO will engage a team 
of specialists following ADB’s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time 
to  time)  through  quality-  and  cost-based  selection,  consultants’  qualifications  selection,  and 
individual selections (footnote 20). 
The PMO will engage a national project management and procurement specialist by ADB

support. The implementing agencies will engage national consultants by self-funding for detailed 
design, construction supervision, and quality inspection. 
61. 
For works contracts estimated to cost $10 million or more, prior review  of the following 
documents  is  required:  invitation  for  bids,  bidding  documents,  bid  evaluation  report,  draft 
negotiated contract, signed contract, and contract variations. ADB’s no-objection is required for 
each step of procurement. All contracts under advance contracting are subject to prior review. 
ADB’s  approval  of  the  procurement  documents  (prequalification,  bidding,  contract,  etc.)  is 
required. Procurement for goods and works contracts with value less than $10 million are subject 
to post review. Documents in English language must be submitted for post review not later than 
1 month after they are completed or issued.

A. 
Environment 
VII. 
SAFEGUARDS 
Environment due diligence. The project is classified as category B for environment. An 
85. 
initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  and  an  environmental  management  plan  (EMP)  were 
prepared and disclosed on ADB’s website on 18 November 2016. 22 The IEE complies with ADB 
policies  and  requirements,  including  ADB’s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009). 23  The  IEE 
concludes  that  the  project’s  anticipated  environmental  impacts  can  be  addressed  through  the 
mitigation  measures  prescribed  in  the  EMP.  The  EMP  includes  mitigation  and  monitoring 
requirements  and  institutional  responsibilities  to  ensure  proper  environmental  management 
throughout the project construction and operation. 
86. 
Updating the environmental management plan and inclusion in bidding documents. 
In  the  design  stage,  ZCG  will  forward  the  EMP  to  the  design  institutes  for  incorporating  the 
mitigation measures into the detailed technical designs. In the event any changes are made to 
the  designs  approved  by  ADB,  the  EMP  will  be  updated  as  needed.  To  ensure  that  bidders 
respond to the EMP provisions, the PMO and the implementing agency will prepare and provide 
the  following  specification  clauses  for  incorporation  into  the  bidding  documents:  (i)  a  list  of 
environmental management requirements to be budgeted by the bidders in their proposals; (ii) 
environmental clauses for contractual terms and conditions; and (iii) the updated IEE and EMP, 
and the domestic environmental impact assessment reports.  
87. 
Environmental  management  plan  implementation.  ZCG  will  be  responsible  for 
ensuring  that  the  project  will  be  designed,  constructed,  decommissioned,  and  operated  in 
accordance  with  (i)  the  national  and  local  government  environmental,  health,  and  safety  laws, 
regulations, procedures, and guidelines; (ii) ADB’s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009); and (iii) 
the  IEE,  including  the  EMP.  ZCG  holds  the  final  responsibility  for  the  implementation  and 
compliance  with  the  EMP.  A  full-time  environmental  officer  has  been  assigned  in  the  PMO  to 
coordinate implementation of the EMP. The contractors and construction supervision companies 
(CSCs)  will  be  responsible  for  internal  environmental  monitoring  and  supervision  during 
construction,  respectively.  Environmental  impact  monitoring  will  be  conducted  by  the  local 
environment monitoring stations, contracted by ZCG. Roles and responsibilities to implement the 
EMP  are  defined  in  the  EMP.  The  project  implementation  management  support  consulting 
services  will  include  a  loan  implementation  environment  consultant  (LIEC),  environmental 
engineer,  and  constructed  wetland  specialist.  These  specialists  will  support  the  PMO  and 
contractors in implementing the EMP. 
88. 
Budget  requirements  for  the  environmental  management  plan.  ZCG  shall  make 
available  the  necessary  budgetary  and  human  resources  to  fully  implement  the  EMP.  If  any 
unanticipated environmental risks and impacts arise during construction or operation of the project 
that were not considered during the environmental assessments, ZCG, through the implementing 
agencies, shall promptly inform ADB in writing of the occurrence of such risks or impacts, with 
detailed description of the event and the proposed action plan for incorporation in the updated 
EMP. The total estimated cost for the EMP implementation is CNY32.70 million ($4,939,577) for 
5-year construction (Table EMP-8 of the EMP). The estimated cost for the PMO is CNY265,000 
(0.81%) and for contractors is about CNY31,645,000 (96.77%). About CNY790,000 (2.42%) will

43 
be  paid  from  the  ADB  loan  consulting  services  and  the  remaining  costs  by  the  implementing 
agencies. Total costs are small given the large scale of the project and when spread over 5 years. 
89. 
Capacity  building.  The  project  agencies  do  not  have  previous  experience  with  ADB-
funded  projects  or  safeguard  requirements.  To  ensure  effective  implementation  of  the  EMP,  a 
capacity  building  program  will  be  implemented  on  the  EMP  implementation,  supervision,  and 
reporting;  the  grievance  redress  mechanism  (GRM);  and  the  design  and  O&M  of  the  project 
technical designs, including “sponge city” guidelines and the constructed wetlands. Training will 
be provided by the LIEC and other experts under the loan implementation consultant services. 
Trainees  will  include  the  PMO,  the  implementing  agencies,  the  contractors,  and  the  CSCs. 
Training  programs  will  cover  the  (i)  EMP  adjustment  and  implementation;  (ii)  GRM;  (iii) 
environmental protection and monitoring; and (iv) sponge city and/or constructed wetland O&M.  
90. 
Grievance redress mechanism. A GRM has been developed in compliance with ADB’s 
Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  requirement  to  address  environmental,  health,  safety,  and 
social  concerns  associated  with  project  construction,  operation,  and 
land  acquisition 
arrangements.  The  details  of  the  GRM,  including  a  time-bound  flow  chart  of  procedures,  are 
included in the project EMP and resettlement plan. The complaint channels are slightly different 
for  environmental  and  resettlement  issues,  but  the  PMO  will  maintain  an  integrated  system  to 
document, follow up, and report on all cases. 
91. 
Climate  change.  A  climate  risk  vulnerability  assessment  indicated  that  the  project 
infrastructure is at moderate to high risk of adverse climate change impact. Water components 
(outputs 2 and 3) are at moderate risk from greater variability in precipitation, rising temperatures, 
and/or increased storm intensity. Ecosystems and natural resources components (output 1 and 
part of output 2) are rated high risk because of the strong likelihood of physiological stress from 
rising  temperatures;  and  increased  probability  of  heatwaves  in  summer,  leading  to  increased 
mortality rates, loss of biodiversity, and reduced productivity and provision of ecosystem services. 
The  overall  design  is  geared  toward  climate  resilience.  Each  project  component  incorporates 
adaptation  measures,  including  raising  embankment  heights  and  increasing  reservoir  storage 
capacity to cope with climate-induced flooding; adopting a mix of climate-resilient native species 
for  the  revegetation  and  forest  planting  components;  enhanced  hydrological  and  water  quality 
monitoring;  and  capacity  building  on  water resources  management that  is mindful  of projected 
climate risks. The project is expected to reduce carbon dioxide emission by 640 tons per year. 
Climate mitigation is estimated to cost $3.25 million and climate adaptation is estimated to cost 
$18.52 million.24 ADB will finance 93% of mitigation and adaptation costs. 
B. 
Resettlement  
92. 
Resettlement  impact  category.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  A  for  involuntary 
resettlement due to significant land acquisition and  resettlement (LAR) impacts. ZCG, with the 
support of a local institute, prepared the resettlement plan according to ADB’s Safeguard Policy 
Statement (2009). The resettlement planning and implementation is designed to ensure that the 
affected persons will be better off or at least not worst off as result of the project. 
93. 
Land acquisition and resettlement scope. The project needs to permanently occupy a 
total  of  3,693.95  mu  of  land,  including  2,309.04  mu  of  state-owned  land;  and  1,398.29  mu  of 
24 Details  on  the  estimates  of  climate  risk  adaptation  and  mitigation  measures  can  be  found  in  the  Climate  Risk 
Vulnerability Assessment and Management Report (accessible from the list of linked document in Appendix 2 of the 
report and recommendation of the President). 
44 
collective land; and the cultivated land area is 528.26 mu.25 As this project is an environmental 
improvement project, the greening works do not change the nature of farmland; and do not need 
to acquire (changing the land property and the ownership) 384.64 mu of village lands (to be rented 
or leased for planting trees). 
94. 
This project will permanently acquire 1,049.65 mu of collective land (including 528.26 mu 
of cultivated land and 521.39 mu of non-cultivated land), and demolish 8,099.62 square meters 
(m2) of residential housing area and 2,475 m2 of business building area, which affects a total of 
33  villages in  4  townships  and/or towns:  Hanwang,  Liaoyang,  Longquan,  and  Shixia,  involving 
591 affected households with 1,384 affected persons. Of these, 24 households with 104 persons 
and four enterprises owned by affected people with 32 employees will be physically displaced or 
relocated. Among the affected people, the female population is 670; and 37 households belong 
to the vulnerable groups. 
95. 
The project will temporarily occupy 231 mu of collective land during construction, which 
affects 231 households with 647 persons. Altogether, the project affects a total of 2,031 persons 
in 822 households. 
96. 
Resettlement plan. ZCG, with the assistance of consultants engaged under the project 
preparatory  technical  assistance,  prepared  a  resettlement  plan  in  line  with  ADB’s  Safeguard 
Policy Statement (2009) and related laws and regulations of the Jinzhong Municipal Government 
(JMG)  SPG,  and  the  national  government.  ZCG  has  endorsed  the  resettlement  plan,  and 
disclosed  the  relevant  information  to  affected  people.  The  resettlement  plan  has  been  also 
disclosed on ADB’s website on 19 December 2016. The resettlement plan will be updated before 
the contract award for relevant civil works involving the LAR impacts.  
97. 
Legal  and  policy  framework.  The  LAR  compensation  standards  will  follow  the  Land 
Administration Law of the People’s Republic of China (2004), the Decision of the State Council 
on  Deepening  the  Reform  and  Rigidly  Enforcing  Land  Administration  (SC  [2004]  No.28,  21 
October  2004),  and  other  applicable  guidelines.  They  will  also  be  based  on  local  policies 
regarding the LAR in Shanxi Province, Jinzhong Municipality, and Zuoquan County; and ADB’s 
Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  SPG  and  ZCG  will  provide  necessary  assistance  for 
relocation and rehabilitation during resettlement implementation. 
98. 
All affected people are eligible to compensation and assistance. The compensation rates 
on land acquisition shall be executed according to the Notice on the Adjustment of the Province’s 
Unified Average Annual Output Value (AAOV) by SPG (JinZhengFa [2013] No. 22) as follows: 
CNY28,800–CNY43,200 per mu for cultivated land; CNY26,400–CNY40,320 per mu for garden 
land;  CNY24,000–CNY37,440  per  mu  for  woodland;  CNY21,600–CNY34,560  per  mu  for 
grassland;  CNY4,800–CNY5,760  per  mu  for  construction  land  in  city,  town,  or  village;  and 
industrial  mining  land;  and  CNY4,800–CNY5,760  per  mu  for  transportation  land.  The 
compensation  rate  is  CNY1,440/mu  for  green  crops.  The  annual  compensation  rate  is 
CNY1,440/mu  for  temporarily  occupied  land.  The  annual  compensation  rate  for  rented  non-
cultivated  land  is  CNY960/mu.  The  final  compensation  rates  for  house  demolition  will  be 
determined based on the appraisal price under the replacement principle. 
99. 
An independent  real  estate  appraisal  agency (will  be jointly  determined  by  the  affected 
people and the project implementation units) undertakes the housing appraisal for this project. 
The guiding  prices for  compensation for  house demolition  are  CNY2,300/m2 for  brick-concrete 
25 Including 348.64 mu of land to be rented and 1,049.65 mu of land to be acquired.  
structure, and CNY1,980/m2 for brick-wood structure. In addition, the affected people will receive 
transition subsidy of CNY8/m2, and moving subsidy of CNY10/m2. For those who have signed the 
resettlement compensation agreement and completed the house demolition prior to the deadline 
prescribed by local governments, each household will receive award a certain percentage of the 
total compensation as the incentive fee. The ground attachments and ancillary buildings will be 
compensated with replacement cost.

100.  Resettlement  and income  restoration.  To  minimize  the  impact,  detailed  resettlement 
and livelihood  restoration measures  are  developed. These measures  are  developed  based  on 
socioeconomic surveys and analysis on the affected households and villages, and referring to the 
successful  experience 
include  monetary 
compensation for land acquisition, endowment insurance, employment opportunities created by 
existing and new enterprises in Zuoquan County, skills training for affected people, employment 
of  affected  people  by  the  project  itself,  and  other  non-monetary  compensation  supports.  The 
resettlement  and  livelihood  restoration  measures  also  include  monetary  compensation  for 
demolished  houses,  and  providing  resettlement  houses  for  the  affected  people’s  households 
choosing  in-kind  compensation.  According  to  survey,  23  relocated  households  selected  cash 
compensation.  They  will  buy  apartments  in  the  real-estate  market  of  Zuoquan  County.  A 
household chose the replacement house to be provided by the government.

water  source  protection  of  the  Qingzhang  headwaters.  The  ZHCB  is  responsible  for  the 
implementation  of Qingzhang  River  rehabilitation  and  integrated  low-impact facilities (including 
the river dredging works, river flood control and ecological rehabilitation works, construction of 
wetland  park  and  associated  amenity  facilities,  and  sewage  treatment  plant  works),  water 
pollution  control  works,  and  related  roads  and  bridges  improvement  and  widening  works.  The 
ZWRB is responsible for the implementation of rural water supply system. The Zuoquan County 
PMO is the coordinating agency for the overall management; and the implementing agency for 
the resettlement, including the resettlement plan preparation, implementation, and management, 
progress  reporting,  internal  monitoring,  and  engagement  of  external  monitor.  Each  subproject 
implementation  unit  will  be  responsible  for  implementation  the  resettlement  plan  with  the 
assistance  of  local  authorities,  including  the  confirmation  of  affected  land  and  houses, 
consultation  with  the  affected  people,  financing  and  payment  of  compensation  fund,  and  the 
implementation  of  measures  for  resettlement  of  the  affected  people.  The  township  (town) 
government  and  village  committees  will  be  actively  involved  in  the  implementation  of  the 
resettlement plan. To guarantee the smooth implementation of the project, the Zuoquan County 
PMO  will  organize  training  on  how  to  implement  the  land  acquisition  and  house  demolition 
compensation and resettlement. 
102.  All  resettlement  costs  have been  included  in the total  project  budget.  Calculated  at the 
price level of October 2016, the total resettlement cost of this project is CNY105,134,307 (about 
9.77% of the total project budget of  CNY1.075 billion), including the basic resettlement cost of 
CNY74,760,634  for  land  acquisition  and  house  demolition,  accounting  for  71.11%  of  the  total 
resettlement cost. Other costs at CNY20,816,055 include land tax, resettlement monitoring fee, 
management fees for resettlement, personnel training costs for resettlement agencies, and the 
assistance fund for helping and supporting the vulnerable groups, accounting for  19.8%; while 
the contingency of CNY9,557,669 accounts for 9.09%. 
103.  Grievance redress mechanism. A GRM has been developed in compliance with ADB’s 
Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  requirement to address  people’s  concerns  associated  with 
project  construction,  operation,  land  acquisition,  and  leasing  arrangements.  The  details  of  the 
46 
GRM, including a time-bound flow chart of procedures, are included in the resettlement plan. The 
GRM will be functional before the resettlement plan update and implementation.    
104.  Affected persons may file an appeal on any aspect of resettlement including compensation 
rates.  The  means  of  appeal;  and  the  names,  locations,  persons  responsible,  and  telephone 
numbers of the appeal accepting agencies will be communicated to the displaced persons at a 
meeting, through an announcement or the resettlement information booklet, so that the displaced 
persons know their right of appeal. Mass media will be used to strengthen publicity and reporting, 
and comments and suggestions on resettlement from all parties concerned will be shared by the 
resettlement  organization.  All  agencies  will  accept  grievances  and  appeals  from  the  affected 
people for free, and costs so reasonably incurred will be disbursed from the contingency costs. 
During  the  whole  design  and  construction  periods  of  the  project,  these  appeal  procedures  will 
remain  effective  to  ensure  that  the  affected  people  can  use  them  to  address  relevant  issues. 
Affected people can also submit complaints to ADB which will be handled by the project team. If 
an  affected  person  is  still  not  satisfied  and  believes  he  or  she  has  been  harmed  due  to 
noncompliance with the ADB policy, he or she may submit a complaint to ADB’s Accountability 
Mechanism.26 
105.  Monitoring. A detailed plan for both the internal and external monitoring is included in the 
resettlement  plan.  The  PMO  will  submit  an  internal  monitoring report  through  project  progress 
report to ADB. Furthermore, the PMO will employ an external resettlement monitoring institute or 
firm to deliver independent and unbiased external monitoring reports. A baseline study of affected 
people will be completed for the resettlement plan before the LAR begins and the first monitoring 
report  will  be  submitted  together  with  the  baseline  study  report.  After  that  and  until  project 
completion,  semiannual  monitoring  reports  will  be  prepared  and  submitted  to  ADB  during 
resettlement implementation and annually for 2 years after completion of resettlement.  
106.  Pursuant to ADB’s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the ADB funds may not be applied 
to the activities described on the ADB Prohibited Investment Activities List set forth at Appendix 
5 of the Safeguard Policy Statement (footnote 23).  
C. 
Ethnic Minorities 
107.  The project is categorized as C for the indigenous peoples safeguard. The project will not 
have any impact on the dignity, human rights, traditional lands or culture of the ethnic minority 
communities as defined under ADB’s Safeguard Policy Statement (footnote 23). The project area 
does not have buildings with cultural or religious significance to ethnic minorities. 
108.  Prohibited  investment  activities.  Pursuant  to  ADB’s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement 
(2009),  the  ADB  funds  may  not  be  applied  to  the  activities  described  on  the  ADB  Prohibited 
Investment  Activities  List  set  forth  at  Appendix  5  of  the  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009), 
(footnote 23).

VIII.  GENDER AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS 
A. 
Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy 
109.  A poverty and social analysis  was undertaken in accordance with ADB guidelines. The 
analysis  collected  information  to  assist  in  the  design  of  the  project  by  identifying  the  poor, 
examining causes of poverty and recommending poverty reduction measures within the scope of 
the project. Several measures are adopted in the project design for social inclusion and improving 
living  standards  of  local  residents,  including  (i)  the  project  area  to  cover  rural  villages  for  tree 
plantation in upstream  watersheds, flood  protection  and environmental  improvement  along the 
Qingzhang  River,  and  water  supply  in  rural  villages  and  townships;  (ii)  involvement  of  local 
communities in project design and implementation; (iii) targeted job opportunities for local people, 
especially for the poor and women; and (iv) providing benefits to communities through several 
means, such as water supply, waste management, annual payments to villages for afforestation 
on collective lands, and eco-compensation to upstream communities. 
110.  A total of 98,627 people will directly benefit from the project, including 45,137 men and 
53,490 women. Among them, 58% are in rural villages and townships, and 42% are in urban area; 
and 11%  are below  the national  poverty  line.  The project  will  provide  several  opportunities for 
local  beneficiaries,  including  (i)  new  job  opportunities  during  construction  and  operation;  (ii) 
improved living conditions through rural water supply,  wastewater management, reduced flood 
risks,  and  other  environmental  services;  (iii)  economic  opportunities  boosted  by  better 
environment and water security; (iv) improved road and traffic safety; and (vi) training and capacity 
building. 
B. 
Gender Development and Gender Action Plan 
111.  The project has been designed as effective gender mainstreaming. Women focus group 
discussions  found  that  environmental  improvements,  better  service  of  water  supply  and 
wastewater treatment are anticipated to have a significant positive gender impact. The project will 
also create women’s employment opportunities. A gender action plan (GAP) has been prepared 
to  ensure  that  women  are  kept  fully  informed  and  consulted  throughout  the  project  and  they 
participate in and benefit from the project. Gender specific indicators have also been included in 
the project’s design and monitoring framework (DMF). The GAP includes measures to address 
gender concerns in all project components and capacity development, which include (i) ensuring 
that there will be sufficient project management support consultants with appropriate awareness 
of  gender  issues  to  effectively  oversee  the  implementation  and  monitoring  of  the  GAP;  (ii) 
ensuring the effective inclusion of women in all project activities; and (iii) ensuring that the targets 
set for the employment of women are met, and the work conditions of and pay for men and women 
are  equitable.  Resettlement  plan  measures  will  mitigate  any  possible  negative  impacts  of  the 
project on women due to the LAR impacts.  
112.  The  GAP  includes  provisions  to  ensure  that  staff  of  the  PMO  and  the  implementing 
agencies are fully briefed on gender in development and the GAP at the commencement of project 
implementation. The staff responsible for social safeguards and gender will work with women’s 
federations, contractors, related government agencies, and community and/or village office staff 
to facilitate the participation of women in opportunities for project works; and ensure that all PRC 
labor laws and core labor standards are respected. The staff will also ensure that (i) the gender-
disaggregated  baseline  and  survey  data  will  be  collected;  and  (ii)  the  GAP  is  implemented, 
monitored  semiannually,  and  reported  to  ADB  through  regular  progress  reports.  Social 
development  specialists  engaged  for  project  management  support  will  mentor  the  staff,  as 
48 
necessary; and facilitate achievement of the project’s gender and development objectives. The 
GAP will be monitored during the ADB review missions as well. See Table 14 below for the GAP. 
C. 
Social Development Action Plan 
113.  A  social  development  action  plan  (SDAP)  has  been  prepared  to  facilitate  continued 
consultation and participation of communities in the project, as well as ensure that labor rights 
and entitlements are observed and that the needs of poor households are considered. 
114.  The SDAP requires that (i) local people will receive priority with respect to employment in 
project works; and (ii) contractors will sign labor contract with construction workers, and follow 
labor regulations. 
115.  The  SDAP  also  includes  activities  to  communicate  and  disseminate  knowledge  and 
awareness  on  environmental  protection  in  Qingzhang  River  upstream  and  downstream  areas, 
and  in  the  county  urban  area;  and  on  water  saving  to  all  water  users  in  the  project  area. 
Meanwhile,  training  on  awareness  about  HIV/AIDs,  STI,  and  communicable  diseases  will  be 
conducted to all construction workers and managers. See Table 15 below for the SDAP.

Monitoring 
1.  
Project Performance Monitoring  
116.  The  project  performance  management  system  (PPMS)  indicators,  their  relevance,  and 
monitoring practicalities will be discussed with the executing agency, the implementing agencies, 
60 
and project beneficiaries during project implementation. Disaggregated baseline data for output 
and outcome indicators gathered during project processing will be updated and reported quarterly 
through the semiannual progress reports of the PMO and after each ADB review mission. These 
semiannual  reports  will  provide  information  necessary  to  update  ADB’s  project  performance 
reporting  system. 27  At  the  start  of  project  implementation,  the  PMO  and  the  implementing 
agencies,  with  the  project  implementation  consulting  services,  will  develop  integrated  PPMS 
procedures to generate data systematically on the inputs and outputs of the components, as well 
as the indicators to be used to measure the project’s impact and outcome taking into account the 
components’  scope.  The  PMO  will  be  responsible  for  monitoring  and  reporting  on  project 
performance. The basis for performance monitoring will be the design and monitoring framework 
(DMF), which identifies performance targets for the impact, outcomes, and outputs of the project. 
By collecting data from the sources identified in the DMF, the PMO will be able to report on an 
annual basis the performance of the project. Specific reporting requirements will be set out in the 
agreement  between  ADB  and  the  government.  The  PMO  will  collect  the  data,  calculate  the 
indicators, analyze the results, and prepare a brief report describing the extent to which the project 
is  generating  the  intended  outputs  and  outcomes,  as  well  as  the  overall  impact  on  ZCG.  The 
relevance and practicability of data collection for indicators was confirmed with the PMO and the 
implementing agencies. Meanwhile, the agreed socioeconomic and environmental indicators to 
be used will be further enhanced to measure project impacts. The PMO and the implementing 
agencies agreed and confirmed that they will (i) refine and integrate the PPMS framework at the 
start  of  project  implementation;  (ii)  confirm  that  targets  are  achievable;  (iii)  develop  recording, 
monitoring, and reporting arrangements; and (iv) establish systems and procedures no later than 
6 months after project inception. 
2.  
Compliance Monitoring 
implementation, 
117.  ZCG, the implementing agencies, and the project management consultants will conduct 
compliance monitoring; and submit reports and information to ADB concerning the use of the loan 
implementation 
proceeds,  project 
performance,  and  compliance  of  loan  and  project  covenants.  These  reports  will  include  (i) 
quarterly progress reports on project implementation; and (ii) a project completion report, which 
should  be  submitted  not  later  than  3  months  after  the  completion  of  the  project  facilities.  The 
compliance status of loan and project covenants will be reported and assessed through quarterly 
progress report. The ADB review missions will verify the status.

3. 
Safeguards Monitoring 
a. 
Environment 
118.  Three types of environmental safeguard monitoring will be conducted under the EMP: (i) 
internal  monitoring—to  be  conducted  by  the  implementing  agency  and  the  construction 
supervision companies (CSCs); (ii) external monitoring—of air, water, noise and soil standards—
to be conducted by the local external monitoring station (EMS); and (iii) compliance monitoring—
to be conducted by the loan implementation environment consultant (LIEC), to ensure the EMP 
is being implemented. The project monitoring program is in Table EMP-4 of the EMP (Attachment 
2). Monitoring shall comply with the PRC standards for environmental monitoring and quality. ADB 
will  oversee  project  compliance  based  on  the  semiannual  environmental  monitoring  reports 
provided by the PMO and site visits, as required.  
27 ADB’s project performance reporting system is available at: 
http://www.adb.org/Documents/Slideshows/PPMS/default.asp?p=evaltool 
61 
119.  Project readiness inspection. Before construction, the LIEC will assess the readiness 
of the PMO and the implementing agencies for environmental management, based on a set of 
indicators  (Table  A1.3  in  the  EMP)  and  report  to  ADB  and  the  PMO.  This  assessment  will 
demonstrate  that  environmental  commitments  are  being  met  and  environmental  management 
systems are in place before construction starts, and/or suggest corrective actions to ensure that 
all requirements are met. 
120.  Environmental  acceptance  reporting.  Following  the  PRC  Regulation  on  Project 
Completion Environmental  Audit  (Ministry  of  Environmental  Protection,  2001),  within  3  months 
after the completion of major components, an environmental acceptance report for each shall be 
prepared  by  a  licensed  environmental  monitoring  institute.  The  report  will  be  reviewed  and 
approved  by  the  Zuoquan  County  PMO  and  reported  to  ADB.  The  environmental  acceptance 
reports of the component completions will indicate the timing, extent, effectiveness of completed 
mitigation and of maintenance, and the needs for additional mitigation measures and monitoring 
during operations. 
b. 
Resettlement 
121. 
Internal and external monitoring of resettlement plan implementation will be conducted. 
Monitoring methodologies are specified in the resettlement plan. Zuoquan County PMO will carry 
out  internal  supervision  and  monitoring  to  ensure  compliance  with  the  provisions  of  the 
resettlement plan and submit internal resettlement monitoring reports semiannually during project 
implementation,  to  be  submitted  together  with  the  regular  project  progress  report.  An  external 
monitoring  agency  acceptable  to  ADB  will  be  engaged  by  Zuoquan  County  PMO  prior  to 
commencement  of  the  resettlement  plan  implementation  and  land  acquisition.  The  external 
monitoring  agency  will  conduct  a  pre-resettlement  plan  implementation  baseline  study  of  the 
affected persons. Semiannual external monitoring reports will be prepared and submitted to ADB 
during the resettlement plan implementation, and annual evaluation reports will be submitted to 
both the PMO and ADB for 2 years after conclusion of the resettlement plan implementation.  
c. 
Gender and Social Development Action Plans 
122.  Monitoring indicators for the GAP and the SDAP have been incorporated into the PPMS. 
Clear targets and indicators have been established and some indicators are also captured in the 
DMF. The regular project progress reports to ADB will include, at least semiannually, reporting on 
those  indicators.  Assistance  will  be  provided  for  the  executing  agency  and  the  implementing 
agencies  by  the  social  and  gender  development  consultant  who  will  help  to  set  up  effective 
monitoring  systems  and  work  with  the  focal  points  in  ZCG  and  the  implementing  agencies  to 
ensure implementation of the GAP and the SDAP. 
C. 
Evaluation  
123.  ADB, ZCG, and the implementing agencies will undertake a semiannual review mission 
to evaluate the progress of project implementation. ADB, ZCG, and the implementing agencies 
will undertake a comprehensive midterm review 2 years after the start of project implementation 
to  have  a  detailed  evaluation  of  the  scope,  implementation  arrangements,  resettlement, 
achievement of scheduled targets, and progress on the agenda for policy reform and capacity 
62 
building  measures.  Feedback  from  the  PPMS  activities  will  be  analyzed.  Within  3  months  of 
physical completion of the project, the PMO will submit a project completion report to ADB.28 
D. 
Reporting 
124.  The  executing  agency  will  provide  ADB  with  (i)  quarterly  progress  reports  in  a  format 
consistent  with  ADB’s  project  performance  reporting  system;  (ii)  consolidated  annual  reports 
including  (a)  progress  achieved  by  output  as  measured  through  the  indicator’s  performance 
targets,  (b)  key  implementation  issues  and  solutions,  (c)  updated  procurement  plan,  and  (d) 
updated implementation plan for the next 12 months; and (iii) a project completion report within 3 
months  of  physical  completion  of  the  project.  To  ensure  that  projects  will  continue  to  be  both 
viable and sustainable, project accounts and the executing agency’s audited financial statement 
together with the associated auditor’s report should be adequately reviewed. 
E. 
Stakeholder Communication Strategy 
125.  Project  information  will  be  communicated  through  public  consultation,  information 
disclosure  mechanism  in  ADB’s  and  government’s  website,  meetings,  interviews,  focus  group 
discussions,  and  community  consultation meetings,  in  accordance  with ADB’s  requirements  of 
information  disclosure  policy.  Main  stakeholders  are  the  different  government  agencies, 
beneficiaries,  affected  persons,  and  participants  in  the  project  implementation.  Stakeholder 
communication is also part of the SDAP and the GAP, and will be monitored accordingly.  
126.  Environment.  Meaningful  consultation,  participation  and  information  disclosure  was 
conducted  during  project  preparation.  Information  disclosure  and  public  consultation  included 
newspaper disclosure; informal communication with key stakeholders, including residents, local 
authorities  and  sector  specific  institutions  and  authorities;  questionnaire  surveys;  and  wider 
stakeholder  meetings  attended  by  affected  people  and  other  concerned  stakeholders.  A  GRM 
has  been  defined  to  prevent  and  address  community  concerns,  reduce  risks,  and  assist  the 
project in maximizing environmental and social benefits.  
127. 
Involuntary  resettlement.  All  affected  households,  town  and/or  township  leaders,  and 
town  and  township  governments  will  be  involved  in  the  project  impact  and  social–economic 
survey. Through meetings, interviews, focus group discussions, public consultation workshops, 
and community consultation meetings, local representatives have participated in the planning and 
concerns have been integrated into the resettlement plan. Before implementation, the PMO, the 
implementing  agencies,  and  other  relevant  leaders  will  further  discuss  and  consult  with  the 
affected  persons’ representatives the  impacts  on  every  town  and/or township and the  detailed 
compensation plan to ensure affected persons’ interests are protected and to provide employment 
opportunities for the affected persons’ livelihoods as result of project implementation. The PMO 
and the implementing agencies will disclose the resettlement plan in the offices and to affected 
people.  The  resettlement  plan  was  disclosed  on  ADB’s  website  on  19  December  2016.  The 
resettlement information booklet was distributed to affected households. This contains information 
such  as  the  affected  project  area,  proposed  land  acquisition  and  relocation  implementation 
progress and procedure, compensation standards for land acquisition, relocation assistance, and 
livelihood  restoration  strategy.  Each  implementing  agency  will  establish  a  project  resettlement 
unit for supervision of implementation, continued public consultation, monitoring of progress, and 
28 Project completion report format available at http://www.adb.org/Consulting/consultants-toolkits/PCR-Public-Sector-
Landscape.rar 
63 
response to grievances. The grievance redress procedures will be established and explanations 
have been included in the resettlement information booklet. 
128.  Gender  and  social  development  action  plan.  Consultations  with  communities  have 
taken place and will continue at different points in the preparation and implementation of the GAP 
and  SDAP  within  the  components,  and  will  be  designed  not  only  to  inform  people  about  the 
component or specific activities related to its preparation and implementation, but also to enable 
people  in  the  community  to  ask  questions,  make  suggestions,  state  preferences,  and  express 
concerns. Special attention will be paid to the participation of women and any other vulnerable 
groups, such as the poor. 
129.  Public  disclosure  of  information.  Public  disclosure  of  all  project  documents  will  be 
undertaken through the implementing agencies and on ADB’s website, including the project data 
sheet,  the  DMF,  the  environmental  impact  assessment  report, the resettlement  plans,  and  the 
report and recommendation of the President. Disclosure of social and environmental monitoring 
reports will be undertaken during project implementation. 
64 
X. 
ANTICORRUPTION POLICY 
130.  ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any violations of the 
Anticorruption  Policy  relating  to  the  project. 29  All  contracts  financed  by  ADB  shall  include 
provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the 
executing agency and all project contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers. 
Individuals and/or entities on ADB’s anticorruption debarment list are ineligible to participate in 
ADB-financed activity and may not be awarded any contracts under the project.30  
131.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  are  included  in  the  loan  and  project 
agreements and the bidding documents for the project.  
XI. 
ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISM 
132.  People who  are,  or may  in the future  be,  adversely  affected  by the  project  may  submit 
complaints  to  ADB’s  Accountability  Mechanism.  The  Accountability  Mechanism  provides  an 
independent forum and process whereby people adversely affected by ADB-assisted projects can 
voice,  and  seek  a  resolution  of  their  problems,  as  well  as  report  alleged  violations  of  ADB’s 
operational  policies  and  procedures.  Before  submitting  a  complaint  to  the  Accountability 
Mechanism, affected people should make an effort in good faith to solve their problems by working 
with  the  concerned  ADB  operations  department.  Only  after  doing  that,  and  if  they  are  still 
dissatisfied, should they approach the Accountability Mechanism.31 
XII. 
RECORD OF CHANGES TO THE PAM
