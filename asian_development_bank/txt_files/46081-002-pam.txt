PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
The  Henan  Sustainable  Livestock  Farming  and  Product  Safety  Demonstration  Project 
1. 
aims  to  demonstrate  model  livestock  production  and  processing  with  improved  environmental 
sustainability  and  product  safety  in  eleven  project  counties/districts  in  Henan  Province.1  The 
project  will  help  (i)  the  Henan  Provincial  Government  (HPG)  upgrade  livestock  product  safety 
monitoring  and  inspection  facilities;  and  (ii)  eight  medium-  and  large-sized  private  livestock 
production and/or processing enterprises, or project participating enterprises (PPEs),2  improve 
food  safety  control  and  implement  environmentally  sustainable  livestock  production  and 
processing.3  Henan is suitable for the demonstration given the province’s strategic importance in 
food security and agriculture in the People’s Republic of China (PRC). 
A.  Rationale 
2. 
Henan Province covers a large part of the fertile North China Plain, with a population of 
104.89 million; 62.34 million people (59.4%) live in rural areas, where the poverty rate is 13.1%. 
Agriculture  has  traditionally  been  an  important  part  of  Henan Province’s  economy, contributing 
12.7% of the provincial gross domestic product and 41.8% of the total labor force in 2012. Henan 
Province is  also  known for  its significant contribution to  national  food  security,  with  the PRC’s 
highest output of wheat, second-highest output of rice, and second-highest livestock production 
in value in 2012. 
3. 
With  the  economic  growth  and  increasing  household  incomes,  consumption  of  animal 
protein-based  food,  particularly  meat  products,  has  also  increased  in  the  PRC.  During  1978– 
2012, per capita meat consumption doubled in urban and more than tripled in rural areas,4  with 
further  growth  in consumption  expected.  Food safety  awareness  is  rising,  and  consumers  are 
demanding  properly  processed  meat  products  with  adequate  labeling.  Livestock  sector 
1  The eleven project counties/districts comprise (i) Gushi County of Xinyang City, (ii) Liangyuan District of Shangqiu 
City, (iii) Luoning County of Luoyang City, (iv)–(v) Neixiang and Sheqi counties of Nanyang City, (vi) Shanzhou 
District of Sanmenxia City, (vii)–(viii) Jian’an District and Yanling County of Xuchang City, (ix) Zhengyang County of 
Zhumadian City, (x) Shenqiu County of Zhoukou City, and (xi) Gongyi county of Zhengzhou City. 
2  Those PPEs were selected based on criteria chosen by HPG. The selection criteria and process are summarized     
in Annex 4 of this project administration manual. The eight PPEs comprise (i) six pig farming enterprises (Dadi, 
Fenghua, Muyuan, Muyuan Meat, Sheqi Muyuan and Yongxin), three (Fenghua, Muyuan and Muyuan Meat) of which 
have processing capacity; (ii)one cattle farming enterprise(Hengtianran); and (iii) one poultry farming enterprise 
(Sangao) with processing capacity. 
3  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance for the Henan Value Chain 
and Products Safety Demonstration Project (TA 8352-PRC).

development in the PRC is necessitated by fast-growing domestic demand for high-quality meat 
products that are trusted by food safety-conscious consumers. 
4. 
The Government of the PRC faces tremendous pressure in ensuring sufficient supply of 
high-quality  meat  products  to  meet  the  domestic  demand;  this  is  complicated  by  increasingly 
challenging  resource  constraints,  including  a  decline  in  the  active  rural  labor  force;  and 
degradation  and  reduction  in  the  quantity  of  arable  land  and  water.  The  national  government 
proposes  to  address  these  challenges  by  upgrading  to  intensive  and  modernized  livestock 
production and processing systems; but this faces two major challenges: (i) ensuring the safety 
of livestock and meat products, and (ii) addressing pollution from livestock waste. 
5. 
During the Twelfth Five-Year Plan period (2011–2015), the national government has made 
significant  progress  in  food  safety  management  to  control  recurrent  food  safety  incidents—by 
increasing cohesion in government food safety supervision, unifying food safety standards, and 
increasing  noncompliance  penalties.5  The  national  government  issued  the first  comprehensive 
Food Safety Law (FSL) in 2009, which is being further revised. The FSL and relevant regulations 
stipulate  that  (i)  local  governments  have  overall  responsibility  for  the  supervision  and 
management of food safety in their jurisdiction; and (ii) food producers and traders are responsible 
for strict compliance with the FSL, relevant regulations, and food safety standards. 
Although  HPG  has  been  upgrading  its  food  safety  infrastructure,  procedures,  and 
6. 
enforcement  capacity,  the  substantial  improvements  needed  for  full  compliance  with  the 
strengthened food safety regulations have yet to be made. Provincial governments are required 
to  improve  hazard  risk  assessment  as  part  of  their  existing  monitoring  and  inspection 
responsibility,  while  lower-level  government  administrations  are  required  to  be  equipped  with 
rapid screening and testing capacity to enhance their sampling and inspection efficiency. Food 
producers, particularly agro-enterprises, are required to have adequate quality control and self- 
testing capacity. As a major food producer for the PRC, Henan Province needs to further improve 
food  safety  management—particularly  of  meat  and  other  livestock  products—  undertaken  by 
HPG, local governments, and food producers, which poses challenges because of the complex 
supply chain. 
The expansion of the intensive livestock production has significant negative environmental 
7. 
impacts. The waste produced by the livestock farms and enterprises contains high concentrations 
of pollutants, and is often discharged without proper treatment, resulting in serious land and water 
pollution; and threats to public safety. In 2010, only 36.5% of the large- scale livestock farms in 
Henan  Province  met  the  PRC’s  environmental  standards  for  waste  discharge  and  control. 6 
Livestock waste also produces significant greenhouse gas emissions. The national government 
has promoted production of renewable energy using livestock waste, particularly for medium- and 
large-scale livestock farms and enterprises; but many lack proper waste treatment facilities. The 
reluctance  of  livestock  enterprises  to  invest  in  waste  treatment  facilities  and  the  national 
government’s weak enforcement of environmental laws makes it difficult to address this negative 
environmental impact. 
As the PRC’s major livestock producer, Henan Province is expected to help demonstrate 
8. 
model livestock production and processing intensification and modernization systems. The project

supports the long-term goal of building a harmonious and moderately prosperous society through 
livelihood improvement, and regionally balanced and environmentally sustainable growth in the 
PRC’s Twelfth Five-Year Plan (2011–2015).7It also supports the national government’s renewed 
commitment  to  food  safety  system  improvement  and  sustainable  environmental  and  natural 
resources management in the third plenum of the Eighteenth Communist Party of China Central 
Committee (2013), which will guide the Thirteenth Five-Year Plan (2016–2020).8  The project is 
aligned with the country partnership strategy, 2011–2015 for the PRC of the Asian Development 
Bank  (ADB)  that supports  the  national  government’s  overarching  strategic  goal  by  focusing  on 
inclusive and environmentally sustainable growth;9  and the ADB operational plan for agriculture 
and  natural  resources,  which  promotes  increased  productivity  and  resource  efficiency, 
agribusiness development, and enhanced food safety and quality. 
The  project  will  also  complement  ADB’s  technical  assistance  on  National  Food  Safety 
9. 
Regulatory and Strategic Framework and build upon lessons learned from previous projects in 
Henan Province, which include the effectiveness of medium-term financing for agro-enterprises 
and  farmers,  cooperation  mechanisms  between  agro-enterprises  and  farmers,  and  the 
importance of capacity building.10  A project loan is the proposed financing modality.

11  In October 25, 2018, due to institute reform, Henan Animal Husbandry Bureau (HAHB) and Henan Department of 
Agriculture (HAD) has been merged and founded Henan Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs 
(HDARA). The duties of HAD has been succeeded by HDARA, and meanwhile the implementing agency HAHB has 
been revised into HDARA, who will carry out subproject construction contents, duties and obligations of HAHB.

(MAHBs),12  and  nine  project  county/district  animal  husbandry  bureaus  (CAHBs);13  (ii)  helping 
PPEs upgrade and/or establish in-house testing facilities for livestock and feed products; and (iii) 
providing  information technology  equipment  and  software  for  HAHB, MAHBs,  CAHBs, and the 
PPEs  to  establish  a  laboratory  information  management  system,  which  will  complement  the 
comprehensive  livestock  information  platform  and  traceability  system  being  financed  by  HPG. 
This  output,  together  with  relevant  training  activities  of  output  3,  will  help  HPG  strengthen  its 
institutional  capacity  for  livestock  and  feed  product  safety  monitoring  and  inspection;  and 
enforcement of relevant regulations. 
13. 
Output  2:  Establishment  of  environmentally  sustainable  livestock  production 
facilities.  This  output  will  promote  environmental  sustainability  and  energy  conservation  in 
livestock  production  and  processing.  The  project  will  help  the  PPEs  establish  (i)  livestock 
production and meat processing facilities; (ii) feed processing facilities; and (iii) in-house animal 
waste  and  wastewater  treatment  and/or  processing  facilities,  including  biogas  generators  and 
organic fertilizer  processing facilities.  These facilities  will  be  equipped  with  energy-  and  water- 
saving  technologies.  The  output  is  expected  to  generate  significant  environmental  benefits, 
including  avoided  greenhouse  gas  emissions;  and  employment  and  income-generating 
opportunities at the PPEs for local people and farmers who supply livestock, raw materials, and 
other inputs to the PPEs, and/or receive organic fertilizer from the PPEs. 
Output 3: Strengthened capacity and project management. This output will comprise 
14. 
capacity-development activities and project management. The project will provide (i) training on 
livestock product safety for the HAHB, MAHBs, CAHBs, and PPEs; (ii) training on environmentally 
sustainable livestock production and processing for the PPEs and associated farmers from which 
the PPEs source their livestock;14  (iii) training on project management for project management 
offices  (PMOs)  of six  project  municipal  governments  and  eleven county/district  governments15, 
HAHB, the PPEs, and other relevant government agencies; and (iv) oversea and domestic study 
Henan Livestock Product Quality Monitoring and Inspection Center (HLPQMIC) under HDARA is responsible for the 
subproject implementation, and the fixed assets transferred from this subproject belongs to HDARA, and the loan will 
be repaid by HDARA. During implementation of the subproject, contracts signed by the HAHB, invoices and other 
related documents and materials of HAHB will continue to be valid. From February 1, 2021, the subsequent contract 
signing, withdrawal and accounting, training and study tours, inspection and audit, and completion acceptance of the 
subproject will be handled by HDARA. The responsibilities of the PPMO will continue to be undertaken by the Foreign 
Economic Cooperation Center (FECC) of HDARA. One of the original implementation agencies, the HAHB, was 
changed to Henan Livestock Product Quality Monitoring and Inspection Center (HLPQMIC) of HDARA, referred to as 
provincial quality inspection center. Accordingly, the Municipal/County Animal Husbandry Bureau (AHB) was changed 
to Municipal/County Livestock Product Quality Monitoring and Inspection Center of (LPQMIC) of municipal/county 
Agriculture and Rural Affairs Bureau (ARAB), referred to as municipal/county quality inspection center. 
12  The five municipalities comprise Luoyang, Nanyang, Sanmenxia, Shangqiu, and Xuchang. 
13  Nine CAHBs include (i) Shanzhou District, Sanmenxia City; (ii) Zhengyang County, Zhumadian City; (iii)- (iv)   
Yanling County and Jian'an District, Xuchang City; (v)    Neixiang County, Nanyang City; (vi) Gushi County, Xinyang 
City; (vii) Shenqiu County, Zhoukou City; (viii)    Liangyuan District, Shangqiu City;  （x）Luoning County, Luoyang 
City.   
14  The areas to be covered by the training include market-based production system certification standards (e.g., 
hazard analysis and critical control point and China Good Agricultural Practices); animal welfare; biosecurity, 
including animal disease control; and waste management. Further details are included in Annex 1 of this project 
administration manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2 of the report and recommendation 
of the President). 
15  After the adjustment of the sub-project in July 2018, 7 counties in which the sub-project enterprises are located, 
including (i) Shanzhou District, Sanmenxia City; (ii) Zhengyang County, Zhumadian City; (iii) Jian’an District, Xuchang 
City; (iv)-(v) Neixiang County and Sheqi County, Nanyang City; (vi) Gushi County, Xinyang City; (vii) Shenqiu County, 
Zhoukou City. Additionlly, there are four counties/districts in the original quality inspection system, including (viii) 
Yanling County, Xuchang City; (ix) Liangyuan District, Shangqiu City; (x) Luoning County, Luoyang City and (xi) 
Gongyi County, Zhengzhou City. 
7 
tours and training.16  Under this output, the project will help the PPEs establish hazard analysis 
and critical control  point  (HACCP)  and/or  HACCP-based food  quality control systems, such  as 
the China Good Agricultural Practices. The training will also cover animal welfare and health, such 
as appropriate use of animal medicines as part of International Organization for Standardization 
(ISO) 9001 requirements. The project will also provide office equipment for project management. 
A  project  implementation  consultant  team,  which  will  be  financed  by  HPG,  will  assist  (i)  the 
provincial  PMO  in  managing  project  implementation  and  organizing  training  on  project 
management and environmentally sustainable livestock production and processing; and (ii) HAHB 
in  organizing  training  on  livestock  product  safety.  Training  of  trainers  will  be  introduced  to 
maximize the impact of capacity development. 
15.  Multilevel  approach  to  food  safety  control.  One  of  the two key  project  features  is  a 
multilevel  approach  to  food  safety  control:  (i)  under  output  1,  the  project  will  assist  three 
administrative  levels  (HAHB,  MAHBs,  and  CAHBs)  of  food  safety  regulators  and  producers 
(PPEs) in upgrading their quality-testing capacity to meet the PRC’s food safety regulations. The 
strengthened food safety control will not only improve the safety of livestock products; but also 
the safety of feed; (ii) under output 3, the project will provide capacity building to help the PPEs 
adopt  HACCP  and/or  HACCP-based food  quality control systems;  and  (iii)  under  output  1, the 
project will help establish a laboratory information management system through which HAHB will 
access  livestock  product  quality-testing  results  provided  by  the  PPEs.  The  resultant  livestock 
product safety monitoring and inspection system is expected to enable the food safety regulators 
to monitor the PPEs’ up-to-date information on livestock and its products to mitigate the risk of 
distribution of contaminated food and animal disease outbreaks. Establishment of the system is 
an important element in HPG’s efforts to build a traceability system for livestock products. The 
resulting food safety improvements will benefit a number of consumers. 
16. 
Environmentally sustainable livestock production. A second key project feature is the 
demonstration  of  environmentally  sustainable  livestock  production  and  processing.  For 
sustainable  sector  growth,  environmental  impacts  need  to  be  mitigated  as  much  as  possible 
through efficient resource use. Despite their significant production activities, most PPEs still rely 
on conventional waste management, involving the drying of waste and its application to crops. 
This project will help all PPEs invest in facilities to enable proper waste treatment. Six PPEs (DD，
HTR，MY，YX，SQMY，SG) will process solid waste for organic fertilizer, while four PPEs (DD，
MY，YX，SQMY) will process liquid waste through biogas digesters to generate gas for power 
generation and residues for organic fertilizer. As a result, the project is expected to avoid more 
than 1,313 tons per year of carbon dioxide equivalent greenhouse gas emissions; and provide 
41,000 tons per year of organic fertilizer. Six PPEs will use part of the organic fertilizer to grow 
feed  and  other  crops  which  will  promote  feed  safety  and  environmental  sustainability  in  feed 
material production at the PPEs and elsewhere. Although production of feed materials that are 
sourced by PPEs from markets are beyond the project scope, the PPEs will be encouraged to 
use  certified  feed  with  quality  assurance  standards,  such  as  the  China  Good  Agricultural 
Practices, to promote food safety. 
The project will also establish a mechanism to monitor and promote water- and energy- 
17. 
saving  technologies  through  an  environmental  sustainability  monitoring  program,  which  was 
developed  and  pilot-tested  by  the  PMO  and  the  PPEs  during  project  preparation  and  will  be 
implemented under the project.17  The program will record quarterly water and energy use in new 
16  A list of training planned under the project is provided in Annex 1 of this project administration manual (accessible 
from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2 of the report and recommendation of the President). 
17  The program is described in section E of the initial environmental examination and in section VIII of this project 
8 
and existing PPE facilities of the same livestock type and in the same counties. The program is 
anticipated  to  enable  the  PPEs  to  increase  efficiency,  which  may  have  financial  and

III. PROJECT MANAGEMENT ARRANGEMENTS 
A.  Project Implementation Organizations – Roles and Responsibilities 
HPG  will  be  the  executing  agency  for  overall  project  planning  and  management.  The 
18. 
project  coordination group, chaired  by the  director  general  of  the  Henan Provincial Agriculture 
Department (HDARA), will provide policy guidance, oversight, and interdepartmental coordination 
for  the  project.  The  PMO,  established  under  the  Foreign  Economic  Cooperation  Center  of 
HDARA,  will  provide  oversight  and  coordination  for  day-to-day  project  implementation 
activities.18Municipal and county PMOs, established by the six project municipal governments and 
eight project county governments, will facilitate project implementation at municipal and county 
levels. Project coordination groups will also be established at municipal and county levels. The 
implementing agencies are HAHB, five MAHBs and nine CAHBs for output 1, and eight PPEs for 
output 2. The PMO will organize training under output 3. HAHB will implement output 1 in close 
coordination with the five MAHBs and nine CAHBs.

The national government has requested a loan of $69 million from ADB’s ordinary capital 
resources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace period 
of 5 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB’s London interbank offered 
rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility;  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%  per  year;  and  such  other 
terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  project  agreements. 24   The  national 
government will be the borrower of the loan and relend the loan to HPG. HPG will in turn on-lend

loan to the national government. HPG will make the remaining loan proceeds available for output 
3 activities and for HAHB to implement relevant part of output 1 activities. HAHB and the PPEs 
will assume foreign exchange and interest rate risks for their portions of the ADB loan proceeds. 
23.

V. FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT 
A.  Financial Management Assessment 
The  financial  management  assessment  (FMA)  was  conducted  in  accordance  with 
24. 
ADB’s  pertinent  guidelines.  The FMA includes  a  review  of  the  executing and  implementing 
agencies  (including  each  PPE):  (i)  funds  flow  arrangement;  (ii)  the  staff  of  finance;  (iii) 
accounting  policies  and  procedures  (segregation  of  duties,  budgeting  system,  payments, 
policies  and  procedures,  cash  and  banking,  safeguarding  assets,  other  offices,  and 
implementing agencies); (iv) internal and external auditing; (v) reporting and monitoring, and 
(vi)  information  systems.  The  instrument  used  for  the  assessment  was  ADB’s  FMA 
questionnaire. 
25. 
The  Henan  Finance  Department  (HFD),  particularly  its  international  division,  as  the 
project  imprest  account  holder,  has  sufficient  financial  management  experience  for  donor- 
funded projects, including 10 ADB loan projects since 2000. The assessment confirmed that 
HFD  meets  all  ADB  requirements.  The  project  management  office,  currently  implementing 
ADB’s  Loan  2474-PRC:  Dryland Sustainable  Agriculture Project,26  is  also  demonstrated  as 
experienced with ADB projects. The 9 implementing agencies (i.e., HLPQMIC of HDARA and 
eight PPEs) are classified into three categories based on the extent to which they meet ADB’s 
financial  management  requirements.  27   Muyuan  group  involving  3  PPEs  (MY,  MYM  and 
SQMY)  of  eight  PPEs  is  classified  in  the  first  category,  which  meets  all  the  requirements. 
HAHB  and  the  three PPEs  (FH, SG  and YX PPEs)  are  grouped  into the second category, 
which mostly meet ADB’s financial management requirements. The remaining two PPEs (Dadi 
and Hengtianran PPEs) are classified into the third category, which meet minimum financial 
management requirements. 
26. 
The  overall  financial  management  risk  of  the  project  is  considered  moderate  given 
relatively low risk at the executing agency, but varying financial management capacity at the 
eight  PPEs.  The PPEs’  lack  of  experience  of ADB  project management,  lack  of  accounting 
staff,  and  insufficient  internal  auditing  are  major  issues  identified,  which  will  be  closely 
monitored during project implementation. Significant training and support will be required on 
including  procurement,  disbursement,  and  project 
ADB  policies  and  procedures, 
management.  A  comprehensive  financial  policies  and  procedures  manual  should  be 
developed in order to guide financial management activities and ensure staff accountability at 
the implementing agency level. The HPG will ensure that each PPE to appoint finance staff to 
manage  project  accounts  and  provide  financial  management  assistance  as  needed.  The 
following are the recommended actions to mitigate the identified risks.

MGs, CGs and other participating government 
bureaus and agencies and ADB to ensure that ADB 
guidelines are followed. 
Regular interagency coordination at all levels to be 
put in place to discuss the portfolio performance of 
the loan. 
Provide financial and technical support to upgrade 
the existing project management information system 
(PROMIS) to develop monitoring and evaluation 
capability in the IAs. 
Separate accounts to be maintained for all project 
components financed by ADB and the Government, 
and to be audited by the State/Provincial Auditors 
and/or an external auditor acceptable to ADB. 
Annual project accounts and underlying working 
papers prepared by the IAs on a timely basis in 
preparation for the annual financial statement audit. 
Quarterly  and  annual  progress  reports  on  project 
implementation and operation prepared. 
Compliance with loan covenants monitored, 
including submission of audited project accounts. 
Overall, the IAs established and maintained sound 
financial management systems, including, (i) the 
establishment of separate project accounts and 
records; (ii) data processing and systems financial 
reports; (iii) recruit additional finance staff as 
needed; and (iv) seek external assistance in 
financial management if needed.

27. 
The  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with ADB’s  Loan  Disbursement 
Handbook (2015, as amended from time to time),28  and detailed arrangements agreed upon 
between the government and ADB. 
28. 
Direct  payment,  reimbursement, commitment,  and imprest fund  procedures  may  be 
used  to  withdraw  funds  from  the  loan  account.  To  expedite  the  flow  of  funds  and  simplify 
document  processing,  the  statement  of  expenditures  (SOE)  procedure  may  be  used  to 
reimburse,  replenish,  and  liquidate  eligible  expenditures  for  any  individual  payment  not 
exceeding  $200,000  equivalent.  Payments  exceeding  this  ceiling  will  be  reimbursed, 
replenished, and liquidated based on the full documentation process. SOE records should be 
maintained and made readily available for review by ADB’s disbursement and review mission, 
or upon ADB’s request for submission of supporting documents on a sampling basis and for 
independent audit.29 
An  imprest  account  will  be  set  up  for  the  project  by  HFD  in  a  commercial  bank 
29. 
acceptable  to  ADB.  HFD  will  be  responsible  for  the  management,  monitoring,  and 
reconciliation of the imprest account. For every liquidation and replenishment request of the 
imprest account, the borrower will furnish to ADB (i) the statement of account (bank statement) 
where the imprest account is maintained, and (ii) the imprest account reconciliation statement 
reconciling  the  above-mentioned  bank  statement  against  the  executing  agency’s  records. 
Follow the format provided in Appendix 30 of ADB’s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2015, as 
28  Available at: http://www.adb.org/documents/loan-disbursement-handbook 
29  Checklists for SOE procedures and formats are in Appendices 9A and 9B of the Loan Disbursement 
Handbook (2015, as amended from time to time). Available at: http://www.adb.org/documents/loan-disbursement-
handbook

amended from time to time). The bank charges in the operation of the imprest account may 
be  financed from  the  loan  proceeds.  The  total  outstanding  advance  to  the  imprest  account 
should not exceed the estimate of ADB’s share of expenditures to be paid through the imprest 
account  for  the  forthcoming  6  months.  The  executing  agency  may  request  for  initial  and 
additional  advances  to  the  imprest  account  based  on  an  estimate  of  expenditure  sheet 
available in Appendix 9B of ADB’s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2015, as amended from 
time to time), setting out the estimated expenditures to be financed through the account for 
the forthcoming 6 months, and submission of evidence satisfactory to ADB that the imprest 
account has been duly opened. Supporting documents should be submitted to ADB or retained 
by  the  executing  agency  and  the  implementing  agencies  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  Loan 
Disbursement  Handbook  (2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  when  liquidating  or 
replenishing the imprest account. 
30. 
Before the submission of the first withdrawal application, HPG should submit to ADB 
sufficient evidence of the authority of the person(s) who will sign the withdrawal applications 
on  behalf  of  the  borrower,  together  with  the  authenticated  specimen  signatures  of  each 
authorized person. The minimum value per withdrawal application is US$100,000 equivalent. 
Individual payments below this amount should be (i) paid by HPG and subsequently claimed 
to ADB through reimbursement, or (ii) through the imprest fund procedure. 
C.  Accounting 
31. 
HFD,  on  behalf  of  HPG,  will  maintain,  or  cause  to  be  maintained,  separate  project 
accounts and records by funding source for all expenditures incurred on the project. HFD will 
prepare  consolidated  project  financial  statements  in  accordance  with  the  government’s 
accounting laws and regulations, which are consistent with international accounting principles 
and practices. 
D.  Auditing 
32. 
HPG will cause the project implementing agencies to (i) maintain separate accounts 
and  records  for  the  project;  (ii)  have  their  general  financial  statements  and  the  financial 
statements  for  the  project  audited  annually  by  independent  auditors  whose  qualifications, 
experience and terms of reference are acceptable to ADB, in accordance with international 
standards  for  auditing  or the  national  equivalent  acceptable to  ADB;  (iii)  enable ADB,  upon 
ADB's request, to discuss the financial statements for the project and financial affairs of the 
project  implementing  agencies  where  they  relate to  the  project  with the  auditors  appointed, 
and shall authorize and require any representative of such auditors to participate in any such 
discussions requested by ADB. This is provided that such discussions shall be conducted only 
in the presence of an authorized officer of HPG and the relevant project implementing agency, 
unless  HPG  and the  relevant  project implementing  agency shall  otherwise  agree.  HPG  will 
cause  the  detailed  consolidated  project  accounts  to  be  audited  in  accordance  with 
International  Standards  on  Auditing  and  the  Government  Auditing  Standards  of  the  PRC 
(where  these  are  consistent  with  International  Standards  on  Auditing),  by  an  auditor 
acceptable  to  ADB.  The  audited  project  financial  statements  will  be  submitted  in  English 
language to ADB within 6 months of the end of the fiscal year by the executing agency. 
The annual audit report for the project will include an audit management letter30  and 
33. 
auditor’s opinions, which cover (i) whether the project financial statements present a true and 
fair  view  or  are  presented  fairly,  in  all material  respects,  in  accordance  with  the  applicable 
30  A management letter means formal communications from the auditor to the client management in accordance 
with the International Standard on Auditing 265 (communicating deficiencies in internal control to those charged 
with governance and management), which is not required to be provided separately as it is equivalent to the

financial reporting framework; (ii) whether loan proceeds were used only for the purposes of 
the project; (iii) the level of compliance for each financial covenant contained in the loan and 
project agreements, including compliance with those key financial ratios described in para. 36; 
(iv)  use  of  the  imprest  fund  procedure;  and  (v)  use  of  the  SOE  procedure  certifying  to  the 
eligibility of those expenditures claimed under SOE procedures, and proper use of the SOE 
and imprest procedures in accordance with ADB’s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2015, as 
amended from time to time) and the project documents. 
Compliance  with  financial  reporting  and  auditing  requirements  will  be  monitored  by 
34. 
review  missions  and  during  normal  program supervision,  and followed up  regularly  with  all 
concerned, including the external auditor. 
The  government,  HPG,  and  the  implementing  agencies  have  been  made  aware  of 
35. 
ADB’s policy on delayed submission,31  and the requirements for satisfactory and acceptable 
quality of the audited project financial statements. ADB reserves the right to require a change 
in the auditor (in a manner consistent with the constitution of the borrower), or for additional 
support  to  be  provided  to the  auditor,  if the  audits  required  are  not  conducted  in  a manner 
satisfactory to ADB, or if the audits are substantially delayed. ADB reserves the right to verify 
the  project's  financial  accounts  to  confirm  that  the  share  of  ADB’s  financing  is  used  in 
accordance with ADB’s policies and procedures. 
36. 
Public disclosure of the project financial statements, including the audit report on the 
project  financial  statements,  will  be  guided  by  ADB’s  Access  to  Information  Policy  (AIP) 
(2018). 32  After  review,  ADB  will  disclose  the  financial  statements  for  the  project  and  the 
opinion of the auditors on the financial statements within 30 days of the date of their receipt 
by posting them on the ADB website. The audit management letter will not be disclosed. 
E.  Financial Performance of the Project Participating Enterprises 
37. 
The PPEs shall submit audited entity financial statements to the PMO within 6 months 
after  the  end  of  each  financial  year.  HPG  will  submit  to  ADB  a  brief  review  of  the  PPEs' 
financial performance with key financial ratios as part of project progress reporting for the third 
quarter of every year during project implementation. The PPEs shall maintain a debt–equity 
ratio not  exceeding  1.5  (60:40),  a  debt service coverage  ratio  of  at  least 1.2,  and  a current 
ratio of at least 1.0. When HPG identifies poor financial performance of any PPE, HPG shall 
consult  with  ADB  regarding  measures  to  be  taken  to  resolve  the  problem,  if  deemed 
necessary. 
31  When audited project financial statements are not received by the due date, ADB will write to the executing 
agency advising that (i) the audit documents are overdue; and (ii) if they are not received within the next 6 
months, requests for new contract awards and disbursement such as new replenishment of imprest accounts, 
processing of new reimbursement, and issuance of new commitment letters will not be processed. 
•  When audited project financial statements have not been received within 6 months after the due date, ADB will 
withhold processing of requests for new contract awards and disbursement such as new replenishment of 
imprest accounts, processing of new reimbursement, and issuance of new commitment letters. ADB will (i) inform 
the executing agency of ADB’s actions, and (ii) advise that the loan may be suspended if the audit documents are 
not received within the next 6 months. 
•  When audited project financial statements have not been received within 12 months after the due date, ADB 
may suspend the loan.

retroactive  financing  does  not  commit  ADB  to  financing  the  project.  The  borrower  and  the 
executing and implementing agencies have been advised that retroactive financing may only 
apply up to 20% of the amount of the ADB loan in respect for expenditures incurred before 
loan effectiveness, but not earlier than 12 months before the signing of the loan agreement. 
B.  Procurement of Goods, Works, and Consulting Services 
39. 
All  procurement  of  goods  and  works  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB’s 
Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time). Contracts for goods estimated 
to cost  $3.0 million  and  above  and contracts  for  works  estimated  to cost $40.0 million  and 
above shall be procured using international competitive bidding (ICB) procedures. Contracts 
for works and goods estimated to cost less than the above ICB value but equal to $100,000 
and above will be procured through national competitive bidding (NCB) procedures. NCB will 
be  conducted  in  accordance  with  the PRC’s  Tendering  and  Bidding  Law  (1999), subject  to 
modifications agreed with ADB.35  Contracts for goods and works estimated to cost less than 
the above NCB values will be procured using shopping procedures. The relevant sections of 
ADB’s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)36  will  be  included  in  all 
procurement documents and contracts. 
40. 
Procurement  under  the  ICB  procedures  shall  use  the  latest  ADB  standard  bidding 
documents which can be downloaded from the ADB website. Documents for all procurement 
under ICB will be subject to the prior review of ADB. 
41. 
For procurement under NCB, the following provisions will apply: (i) the advertisement 
may be limited to the national press, an official gazette or an open access website; (ii) bidding 
shall  follows the standard  bidding  documents  issued  by  the  Ministry  of Finance  (MOF)  and 
approved by ADB; and (iii) bidding documents may be only in the Chinese language, and CNY 
may be used for the purpose of bidding and payment. Procurement under NCB will be subject 
to the provisions of the NCB annex of the procurement plan. Additionally, before the start of 
any  procurement, ADB and  the  government  will  review  the  public  procurement  laws  of the 
central and provincial governments to ensure consistency with ADB’s Procurement Guidelines 
(2015, as amended from time to time). 
42. 
For ICB, all invitations for bids, bidding documents, bid evaluation reports, and draft 
negotiated  contracts  need  ADB’s  prior  review  and  approval.  For  NCB,  invitations  for  bids, 
bidding documents, bid evaluation reports, and draft negotiated contracts for the first NCB for 
civil works and the first NCB for goods need ADB’s prior review and approval. For subsequent 
NCB  packages,  invitations  for  bids,  bidding  documents,  bid  evaluation  reports,  and  signed

VII. SAFEGUARDS 
Pursuant  to  ADB's  Safeguard Policy  Statement  (2009, SPS),38  ADB  funds may  not  be 
52. 
applied  to  the  activities  described  on  ADB  Prohibited  Investment  Activities  List  set  forth  at 
Appendix 5 of the SPS. 
A.  Environment 
53. 
The  project  is  classified  as  “category  B”  for  environment.  An  initial  environmental 
examination (IEE) and EMP were prepared, and are consistent with the requirements of ADB’s 
SPS (2009, footnote 32). The IEE incorporates the results of the domestic environmental impact 
assessment  (EIA)  reports  approved  by  the  Henan  Provincial  Department  of  Environmental 
Protection  in  2013–2014.  Consultations  to  raise  public  awareness  of  the  project  and  receive 
stakeholder’s  inputs to  project design  were conducted  with communities  and  local  government 
agencies.  The  conclusions  and  recommendations  of  the  environmental  assessments  and 
consultations were integrated in the project design. 
54. 
The  IEE  forms  the  basis  of  the  official  loan  agreement  between  ADB  and  HPG. 
Environmental safeguard management for  the  project  will  be  implemented  on  the  basis  of  the 
EMP in the IEE. It includes impact mitigation measures, an environmental monitoring program, 
grievance redress mechanism (GRM), and public consultation plan. It is the principal document 
to  be  used  by  the  government  and  contractors  to  avoid,  mitigate,  monitor,  and  report  the 
environmental  impacts  of  project  construction  and  operation.  HPG,  through  the  PMO,  will  be 
responsible  for  the  EMP  implementation  and  compliance,  including  inspection,  monitoring, 
reporting, and initiating corrective actions or measures. The PMO will have final responsibility for 
implementation of the GRM for handling any disputes. The IEE focuses mainly on project output 
2.  This  output  comprises  eight  PPEs  (Afanti,  Dadi,  Donghan,  Fenghua,  Hengtianran,  Kerchin, 
Muyuan, Niuniu, and Sangao PPEs) engaged in intensive livestock production and processing in 
seven counties of six cities across Henan Province.

management and recycling of livestock solid waste and wastewater, increased efficiency in the 
use of water and energy, reduced pressures on surface and groundwater, improved health and 
safety of workers and consumers of livestock products, and improved monitoring of environmental 
resource use and veterinary products. Potential construction impacts include localized and short 
term air and water pollution, noise and vibration, fugitive dust, soil erosion, solid waste disposal, 
interference  with  traffic  and  municipal  facilities,  and  occupational  and  community  health  and 
safety. These impacts will be avoided and/or mitigated through full implementation of the EMP. 
Potential  operational  impacts  are  groundwater  pollution  from the PPE  waste  (to  be  avoided  by 
appropriate  site  containment  measures),  solid  waste  disposal  (to  be  treated  and  recycled), 
operational odor and noise (negated by the 500-meter buffer zone around the PPEs), regulated 
re-use  of  treated  wastewater  for  farm  land,  based  on  compatibility  with  crop  type,  and 
sustainability  of  groundwater  use  for  the  PPE  operations.  The  status  of  groundwater  aquifers 
utilized  by  the  PPEs  will  be  monitored  during  a  long-term  monitoring  of  key  natural  resource 
variables  throughout  the  life  of  project  operations.  The  IEE  concludes  that  full  and  effective 
implementation  of  the  EMP,  together  with  the  prescribed  capacity  training,  will  result  in  minor 
38  Available at: http://www.adb.org/documents/safeguard-policy-statement 
52 
53 
residual impacts which are within the limits of the PRC standards defined in the EMP. Mitigation 
measures are detailed in the project EMP. 
56. 
Public  consultation  and  GRM.  Information  disclosure  and  two  rounds  of  public 
consultations with the key stakeholders, including the representatives of the affected persons and 
local village committees, was conducted during the IEE in accordance with the PRC’s Guideline 
on  Public  Consultation  in  EIA  (2006)  and  the  SPS.  Over  650  people  were  consulted.  Public 
concerns  about  air  and  water  pollution  from  PPE  operation  were  documented  and  have  been 
addressed  in the  project  design.  In compliance  with the  SPS,  a  GRM  has  been  established  to 
receive and manage any community concerns which may arise due to the project. The PMO is 
the lead agency responsible for overall management, implementation, and reporting of the GRM. 
The PMO environmental and social officers will coordinate the GRM and: (i) instruct the PPEs, 
local  environmental  protection  bureaus  (EPB),  and  contractors  on  their  responsibilities  in  the 
GRM; (ii) establish a simple registry system to document and track grievances received (including 
forms to record complaints and how they have been resolved); and (iii) report on progress of the 
GRM  in  the  quarterly  project  progress  reports  and  the  semiannual  environmental  and  social 
safeguards  monitoring  reports  to  ADB.  The  GRM  procedures,  reporting  timelines,  roles  and 
responsibilities of all agencies, and GRM contact persons in each PPE, are described in section 
G of the EMP. 
Environmental management plan. The EMP was developed during the IEE and defines 
57. 
impacts and mitigation measures for the phases of detailed design, construction, and operation, 
as well as a monitoring program, reporting, institutional responsibilities, training plan, and budget 
(Annex  5  of  the  PAM).  The  EMP  will  be  implemented  until  project  completion,  except  for  the 
monitoring of potential operational-phase impacts, which will start upon the physical completion 
of  each  project  component  and  be  implemented  for  12  months  after  the  date  of  physical 
completion of the overall project. HPG is responsible for the implementation of, and compliance 
with,  the  EMP.  If  necessary,  ADB  and  HPG,  through  mutual  agreement,  will  update  the  EMP 
based on the detailed final project designs. During the final design stage, the PMO will provide 
the EMP to the design institutes to incorporate the mitigation measures into the detailed designs. 
Particular attention will be given to: (i) the re-use of biogas slurry as liquid fertilizer for crops; (ii) 
the  protection  of  surface  and  groundwater  from  waste  or  wastewater;  and  environmental 
monitoring as described in the EMP. In addition to the EMP monitoring program, a program to 
measure the environmental sustainability of project output 2 will be conducted. This is separate 
from  environment  safeguards  and  is  not  part  of  the  EMP  (Section  VIII),  which  is  described  in 
Annex 3. 
58. 
The final  updated  EMP following  detailed technical  design  will  be  reposted  on  the ADB 
website.  A  full-time  environmental  officer  has  been  assigned  in  the  PMO  to  coordinate 
implementation of the EMP. The effectiveness of mitigation measures will be evaluated through 
environmental  inspections  and  monitoring.  The  construction  contractors  and  supervision 
companies will incorporate the EMP mitigation measures into their construction plans and will be 
responsible for internal environmental monitoring during construction. To ensure that contractors 
comply with the EMP, the PMO will prepare and provide the following for incorporation into the 
bidding  documents:  (i)  a  list  of  environmental  management  requirements  to  be  budgeted  by 
bidders in their proposals, (ii) environmental clauses for contractual terms and conditions, and (iii) 
full  domestic  EIAs  and  project  EMP  for  compliance.  Contractors  will  be  responsible  for 
implementing mitigation measures during construction, supervised by the PMO and implementing 
agencies.  The  PPEs  will  be  responsible  for  implementing  the  EMP,  and  environmental 
sustainability monitoring, during operation overseen by the PMO. 
53 
54 
59.    Training. The institutional capacity of the PMO, the implementing agencies, and the PPEs 
to implement the EMP and ensure compliance with the SPS is weak; and the project includes a 
capacity development program. The PMO environment and social officers will be included in the 
training.  This  will  impart  an  understanding  of  the  goals,  methods,  and  practices  of  project 
environmental management. Capacity development will be provided through workshops and on-
the-job  training,  and  will  supplement  training  given  in  the  PPTA  phase.  Training  will  cover  all 
aspects  of  the  EMP,  particularly  the  GRM,  impact  monitoring,  environmental  sustainability 
monitoring, and reporting (Tables A1.4–7 in EMP). Training will be facilitated by the LIC (Section 
F of the EMP). 
B.  Resettlement and Land Leases   
The project is classified as category B in terms of involuntary resettlement. For one PPE, 
60. 
three households need to be relocated to fulfill environmental zoning requirements.39  The cost of 
house demolition and relocation will be paid by the PPE at market value. A resettlement plan was 
prepared, including a GRM. The resettlement will be monitored, and annual resettlement reports 
will be prepared by an external monitoring agency as per resettlement plan. 
61. 
For the project, seven PPEs made commercial land lease contracts over the total area of 
2019.9 mu (134.66 hectares) with 7 villages representing 406 land user households with a total 
of 1,718 affected people.40  Due diligence has been conducted to ensure that these contracts (i) 
are  legal  following  the  PRC  laws  and  requirements,  and  (ii)  that  parties  signed  the  contracts 
voluntarily,  with  consultation  conducted  taking  into  account  information  inequalities,  that  lease 
prices are fair acceptable, and that expropriation was no possible outcome of the negotiations. 
Due diligence was conducted by a third party engaged during the project preparation. 
C. 
Indigenous Peoples 
62. 
The project is classified as category C for indigenous peoples. The assessment conducted 
during the project preparation found that no ethnic minority groups in the past or are in the present 
residing in townships and villages impacted upon by the project. 
VIII. GENDER AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS 
63. 
A social, poverty, and gender analysis was undertaken in accordance with ADB’s policies 
on  Gender  and  Development  in  ADB  Operations  (Operations  Manual  Section  C2),  and 
Incorporation of Social Dimensions into ADB Operations (Operations Manual Section C3). The 
analysis  collected  information  to  assist  in  the  design  of  the  project  by  identifying  the  poor, 
examining causes of poverty, and recommending poverty reduction measures within the project 
scope. 
64. 
Social  and  poverty  dimensions.  A  poverty  and  social  assessment  that  included  a 
household survey, community, and focus group discussions, and key informant interviews, was 
conducted during project preparation. The incidence of poverty among households impacted upon 
by this project is 21.5% based on the PRC’s current poverty income line of CNY2,300 per person 
per  annum  according  to  the  analysis  of  household  income  and  expenditure  undertaken  by  the 
39  Households are not allowed to reside with 500-meter radius from agro-processing plant according to the PRC’s 
environmental regulations. 
40    Three PPEs have state-owned industrial land with a total area of 191.3 mu, among them, among them, Fenghua 
is 40 mu, Yuyuan Meat is 74 Mu and Sangao is 77.3 mu. 
54 
55 
PPTA. Households living in extreme poverty and receiving local country support constitute 1.6% 
of  households  and  another  2.7%  of  households  are considered socially  vulnerable  because  of 
physical or intellectual disabilities. 
Improved  food  safety  will  benefit  millions  of  people  in  the  PRC  as  well  as  consumers 
65. 
overseas. The project will benefit the livelihoods of 15,110 households in eight counties in Henan 
through employment generation from the PPEs’ value chains such as youngstock suppliers, and 
fodder and feed crop suppliers. Among those beneficiaries, 1,526 employees, of which 40% are 
female, will be hired directly by the PPEs. It is expected that about a half of those beneficiaries 
are  from  poor  and  vulnerable  households.  There  will  be  little  impact  on  smallholder  livestock 
producers as the PPEs’ target markets do not overlap with local markets where smallholders sell 
their livestock and meat products. Besides, the project assumes supply shortage of livestock and 
its  products  at  local  and  national  levels;  hence,  the  project  activities  will  neither  crowd  out 
smallholder livestock producers, nor widen the income inequality. 
66. 
Gender  dimension.  The  project is categorized  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming  and 
anticipated to benefit about 13,900 women from their involvement in on-farm activities and off- 
farm  based  waged  employment  opportunities  provided  by  the  increased  production  and 
processing of the PPEs. Female staff of the PPEs and government agencies will be trained in (i) 
livestock  product  quality  and  safety  monitoring  and  testing  systems;  and  (ii)  environmentally 
sustainable livestock production and processing. Women staff members of government agencies 
will also be provided with capacity strengthening in (i) project management and monitoring, (ii) 
safeguards, and (iii) procurement and financial management. 
Gender action plan. The gender action plan (GAP, Table 5) was prepared jointly by the 
67. 
PMO and the participating local governments, with the assistance of the PPTA social and gender 
specialists. The purpose of GAP is to ensure that salient gender issues are addressed during the 
project implementation, and its implementation mitigates likely negative impacts and enhances 
project  benefits  for  women.  The  GAP  will  ensure  suitable  avenues  will  be  available  for 
participation of women, and it includes realistic measures for maximizing their participation in local 
decision-making.  Additionally,  the  GAP  will  put  in  place  measures  to  mitigate  and  possible 
negative impacts and reduce risks associated with the project support for each of the PPEs. The 
table below provides details of the GAP, including target indicators and responsibilities indicators. 
68. 
Institutional  responsibilities  and  monitoring.  The  PMO  will  support  and  assist  the 
implementing agencies in the implementation and internal monitoring of the GAP. The PIC will 
include  one  social  development  specialist.  Internal  monitoring  will  be  undertaken  by  the 
implementing  agencies  and  concerned  PMO  social  and  gender  specialist  and  findings  will  be 
consolidated in the project’s quarterly progress reports

B. 
Monitoring 
1.  Project Performance Monitoring 
69. 
To monitor the progress of the project in achieving the planned outcome and outputs, the 
PMO will establish and maintain a project performance management system (PPMS), which will 
be  designed  to  permit  adequate  flexibility  to  adopt  remedial  action  regarding  project  design, 
schedules, activities, and development impacts.41  The PPMS will cover the following aspects of 
the  project  implementation:  (i)  project  physical  and  financial  progress,  (ii)  results  of  capacity 
development  program,  (iii)  livestock  products  monitoring  and  inspection system  establishment, 
employment 
implementation  of  environment  safeguards  and  environmental 
sustainability monitoring program, and (vi) social safeguards and GAP, and compliance with loan 
covenants (policy, financial, economic, sector, and others). 
impact,  (v) 
70. 
Disaggregated  baseline  data  for  output  and  outcome indicators  gathered during  project 
preparation will be updated and reported quarterly through quarterly project progress reports and 
after  each  ADB  review  mission.  These  quarterly  progress  reports  will  provide  information 
necessary  to  update  ADB’s  PPMS.  At  the  start  of  project  implementation,  the  PMO  and  the 
implementing agencies will develop integrated PPMS procedures to generate data systematically 
on the inputs and outputs, as well as the indicators to be used to measure the project’s impact 
and outcome taking into account the project scope. 
71. 
The PMO  will  be  responsible for  monitoring  and  reporting  on  project  performance. The 
basis  for  project  performance  monitoring  will  be  the  design  and  monitoring  framework  (DMF), 
which  identifies  performance  targets for the impact,  outcomes,  and  outputs  of  the  project. The 
PMO will collect the data, calculate the indicators, analyze the results, and prepare a brief report 
describing the extent to which the project is generating the intended outputs and outcomes. The 
PMO and the implementing agencies agreed and confirmed that they will (i) establish the PPMS 
framework  at  the  start  of  project  implementation;  (ii)  confirm  that  targets  are  achievable;  (iii) 
develop  recording,  monitoring,  and  reporting  arrangements;  and  (iv)  establish  systems  and 
procedures no later than 6 months after project inception. 
2.  Environmental Safeguard Monitoring 
Three types of environmental safeguard monitoring will be conducted under the EMP: (i) 
72. 
compliance monitoring,  which  documents  overall  procedural compliance  of the  project  with  the 
EMP,  including  all  required  tasks  of  mitigation,  monitoring,  and  reporting  (to  be  conducted  by 
project  implementation  consultant);  (ii)  internal  monitoring,  which  is  the  management  of 
construction activities and quantitative measurement of selected environmental variables (to be 
conducted by the PPEs and their construction contractors); and (iii) external monitoring, which is 
the quantitative measurement of selected environmental variables at and near construction sites 
to  ensure  compliance  with  regulatory  standards  (to  be  conducted  by  the  county  environment 
roles, 
monitoring  stations;  EMS).  The  environmental  monitoring  program, 
responsibilities, monitoring frequency and variables, is described in section D of the EMP. ADB 
and the PMO will monitor the status of the EMP implementation through (i) the PMO’s quarterly 
project progress reports and semiannual environmental safeguard monitoring reports to ADB, (ii) 
including 
41  ADB’s project performance management system is available at: http://www.adb.org/countries/prc/project-learning-
resources 
61 
62 
reports by the project implementation consultant to the PMO and ADB, (iii) review missions. EMP 
implementation  will  be  coordinated  by  the  PMO  environment  officer,  supported  by  the  PMO, 
HEPD, project municipal and county EPBs, and PIC to ensure overall compliance of all relevant 
agencies with the EMP. 
73. 
Project  readiness  inspection.  Before  construction,  the  LIEC  will  assess  each  PPE’s 
readiness  in  terms  of  environmental management  based  on  a set  of  indicators  (Table  A1.3  in 
EMP) and report it to ADB and the PMO. This assessment will demonstrate that environmental 
commitments are being carried out and environmental management systems are in place before 
construction starts, or suggest corrective actions to ensure that all requirements are met. 
Environmental  acceptance  reports.  Following  the  PRC  Regulation  on  Project 
74. 
Completion  Environmental Audit  (Ministry  of Environmental Protection,  2001),  within  3 months 
after the completion of each subproject, an environmental acceptance monitoring and audit report 
for the component shall be prepared by a licensed environmental monitoring institute. The report 
will be reviewed and approved by HEPD, and then reported to ADB (Table A1.6 in the EMP). The 
environmental acceptance reports of the component completions will indicate the timing, extent, 
effectiveness of completed mitigation and of maintenance, and the needs for additional mitigation 
measures and monitoring during operations. 
3.  Social Safeguard Monitoring 
75. 
Internal  and  external  monitoring  of  implementation  of  the  resettlement  plan  will  be 
conducted. Monitoring methodologies are specified in the resettlement plan. Internal supervision 
and  monitoring  of  implementation  of  resettlement  plan  will  be  conducted  by  the  implementing 
agencies  to  ensure  compliance  with  the  provisions  of  the  resettlement  plan.  To  ensure  that 
affected  persons  have  been  adequately  compensated  and  rehabilitated,  the  implementing 
agencies will keep ADB informed of the progress in implementing the resettlement plans through 
quarterly project progress reports through the PMO until resettlement is completed. The LIC, an 
independent monitoring party, will assist the PMO in monitoring and reporting resettlement plan 
implementation semiannually and annual evaluation of resettlement results for 2 years after the 
completion of resettlement. 
4.  Gender Action Plan Implementation and Social Monitoring 
76. 
Comprehensive monitoring will be conducted during project implementation to ensure that 
the  project  will  fulfill  its  aims  and  objectives,  including  the  implementation  of  the  land  lease 
arrangements. The implementing agencies will be responsible for establishing and coordinating 
monitoring and evaluation. The PMO will be responsible for the monitoring and evaluation, and 
for reporting to ADB twice each year through Q2 and Q4 project progress reports of year during 
project  implementation.  The  ADB  staff  with  expertise  in  gender  issues  will  participate  in  the 
midterm review. The PIC will work with the PMO and the implementing agency staff to create a 
detailed implementation and monitoring plan for each of the tasks outlined, help to complete the 
GAP implementation reports. 
62 
63 
C. 
Evaluation 
technical,  environmental,  social,  poverty  reduction,  economic, 
77. 
In addition to regular monitoring, project performance will be reviewed at least once a year 
jointly by ADB and HPG. The review will assess implementation performance and achievement 
of  project  outcomes  and  outputs,  assess  financial  progress,  identify  issues  and  constraints 
affecting  implementation,  and  work  out  a  time-bound  action  plan  for  their  resolution.  ADB  will 
undertake  annual  project  reviews  during  the  project  period.  Additionally,  ADB  and  HPG  will 
undertake  a  midterm  review  of  the  project  in  2019,  covering  all  institutional,  administrative, 
organizational, 
financial, 
procurement,  and  other  relevant  aspects  that  may  have  an  impact  on  the  performance  of  the 
project and its continuing viability. The review will (i) examine the progress in implementing project 
outputs;  (ii)  evaluate  environment,  social,  and  poverty  impact;  (iii)  ensure  compliance  with 
assurances  in  the  loan  agreement;  and  (iv)  evaluate  effectiveness  of  the  procurement 
implementation  activities  of  the  executing  agency  and  tendering  company  using  procurement 
review for effective implementation evaluation. The review shall also undertake a comprehensive 
review  of  potential  loan  savings,  identify  areas  for  reallocation  of  loan  proceeds,  and  change 
disbursement percentages, as appropriate. Within 6 months of physical completion of the project, 
HPG will submit a project completion report to ADB42. 
D. 
Reporting 
78. 
HPG  will  provide  ADB  with  (i)  quarterly  progress  reports  in  a  format  consistent  with  ADB’s 
project performance reporting system; (ii) updated procurement plan and updated implementation plan 
for the next 12 months during the annual review missions; and (iii) a project completion report within 
6  months  of  physical  completion  of  the  project.  To  ensure  projects  continue  to  be  both  viable  and 
sustainable, project accounts and the executing agency audited financial statements (AFS), together 
with the associated auditor's annual report, should be adequately reviewed.

Stakeholder Communication Strategy 
80. 
Project  information  will  be  communicated  through  public  consultation,  information 
disclosure mechanism in ADB’s and the government’s website, meetings, interviews, focus group 
discussions,  and  community consultation meetings,  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  requirements  of 
information disclosure policy. Extensive consultation will take place on aspects of infrastructure 
design  and  design  of  nonstructural  measures  such  as  awareness  raising  campaigns,  with 
institutional  stakeholders,  beneficiaries,  and  affected  persons.  In  the  consultative  meetings, 
participants,  including  male,  female,  and  poor  and  vulnerable  residents  and  other  significant 
stakeholders  will  be  consulted  about  concerns  or  complaints  raising  mechanisms,  information 
needs, and further consultation expectations. 
81. 
Consultations with communities have taken place at different points in the preparation of 
the GAP  within the components,  and  have been  designed  not  only  to  inform  people  about the 
component or specific activities related to its preparation and implementation, but also to enable 
people  in  the  community to  ask  questions, make  suggestions, state  preferences,  and  express 
concerns. Further consultation will be conducted during GAP implementation. Special attention 
will be paid to the participation of women and any other vulnerable groups, such as the poor.

X.  ANTICORRUPTION POLICY 
82. 
ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any violations of the 
Anticorruption  Policy  relating  to  the  project. 43   All  contracts  financed  by  ADB  shall  include 
provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the 
executing agency and all Project contractors, suppliers, consultants and other service providers. 
Individuals/entities  on  ADB’s  anticorruption  debarment  list  are  ineligible  to  participate  in  ADB- 
financed activity and may not be awarded any contracts under the project.44 
83. 
To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  are  included  in  the  loan  and  project 
agreements and the bidding documents for the project. The project design and implementation 
arrangements provide for mitigating corruption risks. Risks associated with project management 
will  be  mitigated  by  (i)  training  of  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies’  staff  in  the 
procurement of civil works, goods, and services under the project; and (ii) periodic inspection of 
contractors’ activities related to fund withdrawals and settlements by the executing agency’s staff. 
XI.  ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISM 
84. 
People  who  are,  or may in the future  be,  adversely  affected  by  the  project may submit 
complaints to ADB’s Accountability Mechanism. The Accountability Mechanism provides an inde 
adversely affected by ADB-assisted projects can voice, and seek a resolution of their problems, 
as  well  as  report  alleged  violations  of  ADB’s  operational  policies  and  procedures.  Before 
submitting  a complaint  to the Accountability  Mechanism,  affected  people should make  a  good 
faith effort to solve their problems by working with the concerned ADB operations department (in 
this  case  ADB’s  East  Asia  Department—  Environment,  Natural  Resources,  and  Agriculture 
Division).  Only  after  doing  that,  and  if  they  are  still  dissatisfied,  should  they  approach  the 
Accountability Mechanism.45

ANNEX 3: ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY MONITORING PROGRAM FOR OUTPUT 2 
1. 
Overview. Project output 2 is “environmentally sustainable livestock production facilities 
established.” Under this output the project is assisting the project participating enterprises (PPEs) 
to finance civil works and equipment for production units, processing facilities, feed processing 
facilities,  and  in-house  process facilities  for  animal  waste  and  waste  treatment.  Environmental 
sustainability is a key aspect of the output. The collection and analysis of sustainability indicators 
is an activity which is separate from the environmental management plan (EMP) environmental 
monitoring. It is intended to measure progress in achieving environmentally sustainable livestock 
production for  each PPE. For this  project,  environmental sustainability is defined  as  “Livestock 
production and processing which is sited, designed and operated to minimize the use of external 
resources (especially water, energy, chemicals) and to maximize recycling and reuse of its waste 
products.” 
Baseline and performance indicators. The assessment of environmental sustainability 
2. 
for each PPE will be achieved by quantitative comparison between two sets of indicators: baseline 
and  performance  indicators.  Up  to  15  indicators  will  be monitored, covering  water  and  energy 
resources, waste treatment, and expenditure on veterinary drugs (Table A3.1); the exact number 
will depend on the extent of water and/or energy resources used by each PPE. Indicators were 
selected on the basis of: (i) they reflect important issues concerning natural resource use in the 
livestock industry in the PRC and globally; and (ii) replicability and ease of collection, low cost, 
and limited training needs. Baseline indicators are collected from the PPE’s existing (non-ADB-
funded) operations which are similar to the planned ADB-funded facilities, specifically: (i) support 
the same livestock type; (ii) similar size and operations; and (iii) in the same county. Performance 
indicators are the same set of parameters as the baseline indicators, to be measured in the new 
facilities once operational. 
3. 
Data collection, timing, and duration. Monitoring data will be collected in a standardized 
form  (Table A3.1).  Data sources  and collection methods  are  described  in the form  and  will  be 
refined  during  project  implementation.  Data  sources  include  meter  readings  for  water  and 
electricity  (meters  will  be  installed  in  the  new  facilities  as  part  of  the  project  design),  billing 
statements, and inventory records. Data will be collected in three-month periods (e.g., quarterly) 
at  each  PPE.  Data  collection  will  continue  throughout  the  life  of  project  operations.  To  help 
prepare the form, a trial data collection phase was implemented and baseline indicators for 2013 
were collected for seven of the eight PPEs. 
Data  standardization.  All  raw  data  will  be converted to  “per  head  of  livestock”, so that 
4. 
valid comparisons can be made between baseline and performance indicators. For example: if 
the enterprise used 100,000 liters of water over a 3-month period, and HDARA an inventory of 70 
cattle, then the water use for that quarter was 1,429 liters/head. 
5. 
Data storage. Quarterly monitoring data will be entered into an excel sheet in the same 
format as Table A3.1. Completion of the form requires the conversion of raw data to “per head of 
livestock”. These adjusted values will then be entered into a database which stores all adjusted 
data for baseline and performance indicators, for each PPE, per quarter and per year (Table A3.2). 
The monitoring form (Table A3.1) and database (Table A3.2) have been provided to the PMO as 
an excel file. The database contains individual spreadsheets for each PPE. 
80 
81 
Reporting.  The  PPEs  will  (i)  provide  the  quarterly  data  to the PMO;  (ii)  provide  a  brief 
6. 
annual report to the PMO summarizing the annual monitoring results, any issues encountered, 
how these were resolved, and lessons learned. This can be included within the overall PPE annual 
report to the PMO. The PMO will summarize the annual results from all PPEs and include this in 
the semiannual progress reports to ADB. 
A. 
Roles and Responsibilities 
Project  participating  enterprises.  (i)  Collect  all  quarterly  raw  data;  (ii)  at  end  of  each 
7. 
quarter, enter raw data into excel sheet and submit to the PMO; (iii) ensure raw data forms (hard 
copies) and excel files are stored in a safe, clean and dry place, and can be easily retrieved (e.g., 
if requested by the PMO and/or ADB); and (iv) submit brief annual report to the PMO (see above) 
by the following January. 
8. 
PMO  environment  officer.  (i)  Review  the  quarterly  data  and  discuss  with  the PPEs  to 
check for any missing data or obvious errors or concerns; (ii) enter the PPE quarterly data into 
the livestock product quality and monitoring inspection system (output 1 of the project); (iii) include 
the results in the semiannual environment reports to ADB; and (iv) ensure that the PMO includes 
the results in the progress reports to ADB for outputs 1 and 2 of the project. 
Loan  implementation  environment  consultant.  (i)  For  each  PPE,  clarify  the  specific 
9. 
water and energy sources and methods (meters, well gauges, etc.) that will be recorded quarterly, 
for both the existing and new (ADB-funded) facilities, to ensure that monitoring will be consistent. 
If necessary, tailor the quarterly data form to the individual PPEs, e.g., if more columns need to 
be inserted for extra meters or wells. For each PPE, clearly describe the specific methods used 
for measurements at the existing and new (ADB-funded) facilities; (ii) prepare simple and brief 
reporting templates for (a) the PPE annual report to the PMO; (b) the PMO reports to ADB, for 
inclusion in the semiannual progress reports to ADB; (iii) ensure that by the end of the first year 
of PPE operations, data collection is operational and any issues have been resolved; (iv) in the 
first  3  years  of  operation,  closely  support  the  PPEs  and  the  PMO  environment  officer  in  the 
collection, analysis, and reporting of data. Ensure that by the second year, the PPEs and the PMO 
are fully capable of independently conducting all data collection, storage, analysis, and reporting; 
(v)  prepare  independent  progress  reports  which  review  the  status  of  the  monitoring  program, 
including  progress  by  the  PPEs  and  the  PMO,  issues  and  lessons  learned,  and  comparison 
between baseline and performance indicators.

The  process  used for  the subproject  selection  involved  representatives from the  Henan 
Provincial  Development  and  Reform  Commission  (HDRC),  the  Henan  Provincial  Finance 
Department  (HFD),  and  the  Henan  Provincial  Agriculture  Department  (HDARA).  The  selection 
criteria were drawn up and agreed by those provincial government agencies and were then sent 
to all municipalities and counties in the province asking them to recommend one or two enterprises 
in their respective areas that were likely to meet the criteria and might be interested to participate 
in the project. A total of more than 20 enterprises were proposed as potential candidates for the 
project.  A  joint  delegation  from  the  provincial  government  agencies  then  visited  each  of  the 
candidate enterprises to collect data and discuss possible participation in the project with each 
company’s senior management. A selection was then made of those enterprises that best met the 
criteria  for  participating  in  the  project.  This  original  list  included  17  enterprises.  For  various 
reasons,  nine  of  them  have  dropped  out,  and  one  was  added  later  leaving  a  total  of  nine 
enterprises currently included in the proposed project. 
The subproject selection criteria, translated from the original document, are given in para. 
2. 
3 below. 
Enterprises  to  join  the  project  must  be  those  recognized  as  leading  agro-processing 
3. 
enterprises by either provincial level or national level. Specific criteria are 
i)  Enterprise  scale.  For  processing  enterprises,  total  assets  shall  exceed  CNY50 
million, fixed assets shall exceed CNY20 million, and annual sales revenue shall be 
more  than  CNY70  million;  for  service  enterprises,  total  assets  shall  exceed  CNY30 
million, fixed assets shall exceed CNY10 million, and sales revenue shall be more than 
CNY50 million; for special wholesale marketing enterprises, the annual volume of trade 
shall exceed CNY200 million. 
ii) 
Economic  benefits.  Rate  of  return  on total  assets  of  the  enterprise shall be  higher 
than  bank  lending  rate  in  the  corresponding  period;  the  enterprise  shall  not  have 
outstanding taxes, salaries or social security payments, nor shall it have deficits. 
iii)  Corporate reputation. The debt equity ratio of the enterprise is generally below 60% 
and the corporate credit rating shall be Grade A and above.46
iv) 
Employment  impact.  Generally,  the  number  of  rural  families  supported  by  the 
enterprise (except special production and state-owned land reclamation enterprises) 
through a contract or other stable and binding mechanism shall exceed 2,000. During 
the  production  and  processing  of  agricultural  products,  raw  materials  or  goods 
purchased through contracts, share buying and cooperation shall make up more than 
70% of raw materials needed or goods purchased. 
Competitiveness.  The  enterprise  shall  be  leading  in  product  quality,  scientific  and 
technological contents, and ability to develop new products among enterprises in the 
same industry within the province. Its main products shall accord with industrial and 
environmental policies and quality management standard system of Henan Province 
and  the  capacity  utilization  shall  exceed  90%.  The  enterprise  shall  have  a  good 
financial situation with relatively strong economic strength and loan repayment ability. 
v) 
Enterprise standing. The enterprise shall have good social credibility, have a great 
46  This refers to corporate credit ratings given by domestic banks     
84 
85 
vi) 
influence  on  local  economic  development,  and  enjoy  a  high  capacity  of  local 
government support. There shall be no bad records of business operation. 
Local government’s fiscal condition. Municipalities or counties in which the projects 
are located shall fully consider other factors like local GDP, fiscal revenue and debts, 
and conduct risk assessment to find out whether local indicators including growth rate 
of debts and financial ability, debt ratio, debt-to-GDP ratio, debt repayment ratio and 
loan  repayment  reserve  ratio  are  in  the  green  (safe)  areas  according  to  computing 
methods  and  evaluation criteria  specified  in  Notification  from  Ministry  of  Finance  on 
issuing  “Interim  Procedures  For  Inspection  on  Foreign  Debts  Index  of  Local 
Governments”  (CAI  JIN  [2008]  No.175).  Meanwhile,  the  local  government  should 
undertake a financial assessment of the enterprises with regard to financial status and 
loan repayment capacity and report to HFD whether they agree to the selection of the 
enterprise. 
vii) 
Production scale. Inventory of pigs shall exceed 10,000; inventory of chicken or duck 
shall  exceed  100,000;  cattle  inventory  shall  exceed  2,000.  Product  quality  shall  be 
stable  with  broad  market  prospects  and  good  economic  benefits,  and  environment 
protection requirements shall be met. 
viii)  Project design. Project design needs to take into full account recycling of resources, 
sustainable  development,  value  chain  linkages  and  additional  value  improvement; 
innovation in developing pattern and management philosophy shall be emphasized. 
ix)  Demonstration and local economic impact. Project selection shall have the potential 
for a relatively strong demonstration effect in its area and neighboring areas, for the 
economic development of its area and for increasing the income of farmers. 
4. 
As noted above, the subproject selection process was undertaken by representatives of 
HDRC, HFD, and HDARA. The selection criteria were partly quantitative and partly qualitative and 
among  the  quantitative  criteria  not  all  involved  data  that  would  be  readily  available  and  easily 
obtainable. For example, most of the criteria included in para. 3 above involve readily available 
quantitative data or other evidence (e.g., leading enterprises [para. 3(v)] are formally recognized 
by various government agencies and certification to this effect may often be produced). However, 
the criterion that more than 70% of raw materials should be purchased “through share contracts, 
share  buying,  and  cooperation”  appears  to  have  been  difficult  for  the  selection  delegation  to 
assess and no data about this has been available either from the selection process or from the 
selected enterprises. 
The production scale criteria in para. 3(viii) are also quantitative and straightforward. However, the 
criteria outlined in paras. 3(vi)–(x) above are qualitative or require judgments based on the evaluation 
of quantitative data by the selection delegation from the three provincial agencies (such as whether 
enterprises meet local government financial and fiscal criteria).

A. 
Introduction 
1. 
This  environmental  management  plan  (EMP)  is  developed  for  the  Henan  Sustainable 
Livestock  Farming  and  Product  Safety  Demonstration  Project  (the  project).  It  summarizes  the 
potential  project  environmental  impacts  and  defines  mitigation  measures  and  monitoring 
requirements for the design, construction, and operational stages of the project. It also defines the 
institutional arrangements and mechanisms, roles and responsibilities of different institutions, and 
costs for EMP implementation. The EMP seeks to ensure continuously improving environmental 
protection activities during preconstruction, construction, and operation to avoid, reduce, and/or 
mitigate adverse impacts and risks. The EMP is based on the findings of the initial environmental 
examination (IEE) and domestic environmental assessment reports. 
2. 
This  EMP  will  be  disclosed  on  the  Asian  Development  Bank’s  (ADB)  public  website 
(www.adb.org) and included in the project administration manual (PAM). It will also be included 
as a separate annex in all bidding and contract documents. The contractors will be informed of 
their obligations to implement the EMP, and to provide for EMP implementation costs in their bids 
for project works. 
3. 
The EMP  includes  a monitoring  program. Monitoring  results  will  be  used  to  evaluate:  (i) 
the  extent  and  severity  of  actual  environmental  impacts  against  the  predicted  impacts;  (ii)  the 
performance  of the  environmental  protection measures  and compliance  with  relevant  laws  and 
regulations; (iii) trends of impacts; and (iv) overall effectiveness of the EMP. 
B. 
Institutional Arrangements and Responsibilities for EMP Implementation 
The Henan provincial government is the executing agency (EA) for the project. The EA has 
4. 
set up a project coordinating group (PRG) to facilitate liaison with project agencies and to assist 
in  complaints  resolution  in  the  GRM.  The  PRG  comprises  representatives  from  the  Henan 
Provincial  Development  and  Reform  Commission  (HDRC),  the  Henan  Provincial  Finance 
Department  (HFD),  the  Henan  Animal  Husbandry  Bureau  (HAHB),  the  Henan  Provincial 
Environmental  Protection  Department  (HEPD),  the  Henan  Poverty  Alleviation  Bureau,  and  the 
Women’s Federation of the People’s Republic of China (PRC). 
The EA has established a project management office (PMO), who will be responsible, on 
5. 
behalf  of  the EA, for  the  day-to-day  management  of the  project  and  the implementation  of  the 
EMP. The PMO has nominated and established the position of a PMO environment officer (Table 
A1.1) who will coordinate the activities of the EMP. The terms of reference for this officer are in 
Annex A. 
The  PMO,  through  the  PMO  environment  officer  and  in  coordination  with  the  loan 
6. 
implementation environment consultant (LIEC), will do the following. 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
(v) 
Prepare  and  provide  the  following  specification  clauses  for  incorporation  in  the 
bidding procedures: (a) environmental management requirements to be budgeted 
by the project participating enterprises (PPEs) and their construction  contractors; 
(b) environmental clauses for contractual terms and conditions; and (c) the EMP; 
Translate the EMP into Chinese language, and ensure that it remains consistent 
with this original version in English language; 
Ensure the EMP  is  implemented  by the contractors,  and  that  all  contractors  and 
the PPEs comply with the EMP; 
Implement the grievance redress mechanism (GRM, Section G); and 
Prepare and submit semiannual environmental monitoring reports to ADB. 
Environmental monitoring station. In each project county, the environmental monitoring 
7. 
station  (EMS)  of  the  environmental  protection  bureau  (EPB)  will  be  contracted  by  the  PPE  to 
88 
89 
implement the external environmental monitoring program described in this EMP. The PMO will 
supervise this monitoring. Each EMS will report to the local EPBs and PMO. Each EMS  will  be 
identified in the project procurement plan. 
8. 
The LIEC will be hired under the loan implementation consultancy services. The terms of 
reference for this position are in Annex B. The LIEC is essential to completion of environmental 
pre-construction activities and should be recruited as soon as possible after loan effectiveness. 
The LIEC will assist the PMO environment officer with the following: 
1. 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
(v) 
(vi) 
(vii) 
2. 
(i)

(iii) 
(iv) 
Before Construction 
Assist the PMO and the PPEs to integrate the EMP mitigation and management 
measures into construction contracts and arrangements; 
Ensure that relevant sections of the project EMP are incorporated in the 
construction contract documents; 
Assist the PMO to establish and publicize the GRM; 
Facilitate and engage the implementation of the Environmental Sustainability 
Monitoring Plan; 
Develop procedures to (a) monitor and report on the EMP implementation 
progress, and (b) record and collate complaints and resolution under the GRM; 
Provide support and training to the PMO, the PPEs, and contractors on the 
specific requirements of the EMP, as required; and 
Assess the project components’ environmental readiness prior to implementation. 
During Project Implementation 
Conduct regular EMP compliance assessments; undertake site visits, as required; 
identify  any  environment-related  implementation  issues;  and  propose  necessary 
responses in corrective action plans; 
Assist the PMO to prepare semiannual environmental monitoring progress reports 
for submission to ADB; 
Assist the PPEs in the completion of performance indicators from the initial 
operation phase for the sustainability demonstration form (Annex C); and 
Prepare a sustainability demonstration report for each PPE comparing baseline 
sustainability indicators with operational performance indicators. 
9. 
The  PPEs  will  implement  the  project  components  and  EMP  mitigation  measures, 
administer and monitor contractors and suppliers, and be responsible for construction supervision 
and quality control at each subproject site. Each PPE has assigned an environment and social 
officer (Table A5.1). 
The contractors will need to understand their requirements under the EMP. Each contractor 
10. 
will be required to assign a specific member of  their work team who  will be responsible  for  the 
team’s  environmental,  health,  and safety  management. The contractors  will  work  with  the PPE 
environment  and  social  officers,  the  PMO  environmental  and  social  safeguard  officer,  and  the 
LIEC to ensure that prior to any works, the EMP is jointly reviewed and any site-specific measures 
are identified and agreed.

Monitoring and Reporting 
12. 
Three types of project monitoring will be conducted under the EMP. 
(i) 
(ii) 
Compliance monitoring. To be conducted by the LIEC; 
Internal monitoring. To be conducted by the PPE. This will include monitoring 
of  air  quality  and  noise  during  construction,  and  wastewater  quality  (including 
inlet  and  outlet  of  sewage  treatment  station,  and  pay  attention  to  the  periodic 
change of water quality and quantity) and groundwater during operation; and 
External monitoring. To be conducted by a qualified environmental monitoring 
unit.  This  will  include  air,  noise  and  water  during  construction  and  air  (odor), 
noise, wastewater quality and groundwater during operation. 
(iii) 
13. 
ADB  will  oversee  project  compliance  on  the  basis  of  the  semiannual  environmental 
monitoring reports provided by the PMO and site visits as required. Monitoring and reporting 
arrangements defined for this project are described below. 
14. 
Project readiness inspection. Before construction, the LIEC will assess each PPE’s 
readiness  in  terms  of  environmental management  based  on  a set  of  indicators  (Table  A5.3) 
and  report  it  to  ADB  and  the  PMO.  This  assessment  will  demonstrate  that  environmental 
commitments  are  being  carried  out  and  environmental  management  systems  are  in  place 
before construction starts, or suggest corrective actions to ensure that all requirements are met. 
Some  of  these  commitments  are  particularly  important  because  information  relating  to  them 
was either not submitted in the PPTA phase or submitted too late in the PPTA phase for proper 
resolution.  These include compliance with  loan covenants and assurances relating to (i) the 
management of treated wastewater as liquid fertilizer and (ii) the sustainability of groundwater 
extraction, as well as confirming environmental compliance of facilities providing store chickens 
associated with the Sangao subprojects.

Project monitoring. Table A5.4 shows the environmental monitoring program designed 
for this project, defining the scope, location, parameter, duration and frequency, and responsible 
agencies, for monitoring during the construction and operational stages. Monitoring parameters 
were identified in the environmental assessment for each PPE (Chapter VI.B of the IEE) and also 
reflect the requirements of national regulatory standards. Internal environmental monitoring will 
include monitoring of air quality and noise in the construction stage and wastewater quality and 
groundwater in the operations stage. External monitoring will include air, noise and water during 
construction and air (odor from biogas plant and organic fertilizer plant), noise, wastewater quality 
and groundwater during operations. 
The environmental monitoring results will be compared with relevant PRC performance 
16. 
standards  (Table  A5.5).  Noncompliance  with  these  standards  will  be  highlighted  in  the 
monitoring  reports. Monitoring  results  will  be submitted  to  the PMO  and  then  reported  by  the 
PMO to ADB in semiannual environmental monitoring reports (prepared with the support of the 
LIEC – Table A5.6).

17. 
Compliance  evaluation.  Independent  evaluation  of  the  compliance  with  EMP 
measures will be undertaken by the LIEC. The PMO will report the LIEC’s independent evaluation 
to  ADB  on  the  project’s  adherence  to  the  EMP,  information  on  project  implementation, 
environmental performance of the contractors, and environmental compliance through quarterly 
project  progress  reports  and  semiannual  environmental  monitoring  reports  (Table  A5.6).  The 
LIEC will support the PMO in developing the semiannual environmental monitoring reports. The 
reports should confirm the project’s compliance with the EMP and local legislation (including the 
PRC’s EIA requirements), the results of independent evaluation (both the PPE and/or contractor 
compliance  with  the  EMP  and  the  results  of  environmental  monitoring  by  the  qualified 
environmental monitoring stations), identify any environment related implementation issues and 
necessary  corrective  actions,  and  reflect  these  in  a  corrective  action  plan.  Operation  and 
performance  of  the  project  GRM,  environmental  institutional  strengthening  and  training,  and 
compliance with all covenants under the project will be included in the report. 
18. 
Environmental  acceptance  reporting.  Following  the  PRC  Regulation  on  Project 
Completion  Environmental  Audit  (MEP,  2001),  within  3  months  after  the  completion  of  each 
subproject,  an  environmental  acceptance  report  for  each  subproject  shall  be  prepared  by  a 
licensed  environmental  monitoring  institute.  The  report  will  be  reviewed  and  approved  by  the 
HEPD  and  reported  to  ADB  (Table  A5.6).  The  environmental  acceptance  reports  of  the 
component completions will indicate the timing, extent, effectiveness of completed mitigation and 
of  maintenance,  and  the  needs  for  additional  mitigation  measures  and  monitoring  during 
operations.

Environmental Sustainability Indicators for Output 2 
Overview.  Project  Output  2  is  “environmentally  sustainable  livestock  production  and 
19. 
processing  implemented”.  Under  this  Output  the  project  is  assisting  the  PPEs  to  finance  civil 
works and equipment for production units, processing facilities, feed processing facilities, and in-
house process facilities for animal waste and waste treatment. “Environmental sustainability” is a 
key aspect of the Output. The collection and analysis of sustainability indicators is an activity which 
is  separate  from  the  environmental  monitoring  plan  of  this  EMP.  It  is  intended  to  measure 
progress in  achieving  environmentally sustainable  livestock  production for  each PPE.  For  this 
project, environmental sustainability is defined as: 
Livestock  production  and  processing  which  is  sited,  designed,  and  operated  to 
minimize the use of external resources (especially water, energy, chemicals) and 
to maximize recycling and reuse of its waste products. 
20. 
Baseline and performance indicators. The assessment of environmental sustainability 
for each PPE will be achieved by quantitative comparison between two sets of indicators: baseline 
and  performance  indicators.  Up  to  15  indicators  will  be  monitored,  covering  water  and  energy 
resources,  waste treatment,  and  expenditure  on veterinary  drugs  (Annex C); the  exact  number 
will depend on the extent of water and/or energy resources used by each PPE. Indicators were 
selected on the basis of: (i) they reflect important issues concerning natural resource use in the 
livestock  industry  in  the PRC  and  globally;  (ii)  replicability  and  ease  of collection, low cost, and 
limited  training  needs.  Baseline  indicators  are  collected  from  the  PPE’s  existing  (non  ADB-
funded) operations which are similar to the planned ADB-funded facilities, specifically: (i) support 
the same livestock  type;  (ii) similar size  and  operations;  (iii) in  the same county. Performance 
indicators are the same set of parameters as the baseline indicators, to be measured in the new 
facilities once operational. 
21. 
Data collection, timing, and duration. Monitoring data will be collected in a standardized 
form (Annex C). Data sources and collection methods are described in the form and will be refined 
during  project  implementation.  Data  sources  include  meter  readings  for  water  and  electricity 
(meters will be installed in the new facilities as part of the project design), billing statements, and 
inventory records. Data will be collected in three-month periods (i.e., quarterly) at each PPE. Data 
collection will continue throughout the life of project operations. To help prepare the form, a trial 
data collection phase was implemented and baseline indicators for 2013 were collected from the 
eight PPEs. 
22. 
Data  standardization. All  raw  data  will  be  converted to  “per  head  of  livestock”, so  that 
valid comparisons  can  be made  between  baseline  and  performance  indicators. For  example:  if 
the enterprise used 100,000 liters of water over a 3-month period, and HDARA an inventory of 70 
cattle, then the water use for that quarter was 1,429 liters/head. 
Data storage. Quarterly monitoring data will be entered into an excel sheet in the same 
23. 
format as Annex C. Completion of the form requires the conversion of raw data to “per head of 
livestock”. These adjusted values will then be entered into a database which stores all adjusted 
data for baseline and performance indicators, for each PPE, per quarter and per year (Annex D). 
The monitoring form (Annex C) and database (Annex D) have been provided to the PMO as an 
98 
99 
excel file. The database contains individual spreadsheets for each PPE. 
Reporting. The  PPEs  will  (i)  provide the  quarterly  data  to the  PMO;  (ii) provide  a  brief 
24. 
annual  report to the  PMO summarizing  the  annual monitoring  results,  any  issues  encountered, 
how these were resolved, and lessons learned. This can be included within the overall PPE annual 
report to the PMO. The PMO will summarize the annual results from all PPEs and include this in 
the semiannual progress reports to ADB. 
25. 
Roles and Responsibilities 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
Project participating enterprises. (a) Collect all quarterly raw data; (b) at end of 
each quarter, enter raw data into excel sheet and submit to PMO; (c) ensure raw 
data forms (hard copies) and excel files are stored in a safe, clean and dry place, 
and can be easily retrieved (e.g., if requested by PMO and/or ADB); and (d) submit 
brief annual report to the PMO (see above) by the following January. 
Project management office environment officer. (a) Review the quarterly data 
and  discuss  with  the  PPEs  to  check  for  any  missing  data  or  obvious  errors  or 
concerns;  (b)  enter  the PPE  quarterly  data  into  the  livestock  product  quality  and 
monitoring inspection system (Output 1 of the project); (c) include the results in the 
semiannual environment reports to ADB; and (d) ensure that the PMO includes the 
results in the progress reports to ADB for Outputs 1 and 2 of the project. 
Loan  implementation  environment  consultant  (LIEC).  (a)  Review  and  if 
necessary,  refine  the  quarterly  data  collection  form  (Annex  C)  and  database 
(Annex D). Prior to making any revisions, seek review and approval from the PMO 
and ADB; (b) prepare simple and brief reporting templates for (i) PPE annual report 
to PMO; (ii) PMO reports to ADB, for inclusion in the semiannual progress reports 
to ADB; (c) ensure that by the end of the first year of PPE operations, data collection 
is  operational  and  any  issues  have  been  resolved;  (d)  in  the  first  3  years  of 
operation,  closely  support  the  PPEs  and  the  PMO  environment  officer  in  the 
collection,  analysis,  and  reporting  of  data.  Ensure  that  by  the  second  year,  the 
PPEs  and  the  PMO  are  fully  capable  of  independently  conducting  all  data 
collection, storage, analysis, and reporting; and (e) prepare independent progress 
reports which review the status of the monitoring program, including progress by 
the  PPEs  and  the  PMO,  issues  and  lessons  learned,  and  comparison  between 
baseline and performance indicators. 
F. 
Training 
The  capacity  of  the  PMO  and  the  PPEs  and  their  environment  and  social  officers 
26. 
responsible for EMP implementation and supervision will be strengthened through training. This 
will  impart  an  understanding  of  the  goals,  methods,  and  practices  of  project  environmental 
management. Initially, the training will be in formal workshops but will extend to on the job training 
by the LIEC as he/she visits construction sites. 
27. 
The formal training will cover EMP implementation, supervision, and reporting, and on the 
Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM, Table A5.7). Training will be facilitated by the LIEC with 
support of other experts under the loan implementation consultant services. Attendees from the 
PPEs will be the environmental and social officers and supervising engineers.

G. 
Grievance Redress Mechanism 
A GRM has been established as part of the project EMP to receive and manage any public 
28. 
environmental and/or social issues which may arise due to the project. The project agencies will 
ensure that potentially affected communities are informed on GRM at an early stage of the project. 
The PPEs, the PMO, and the HEPD personnel have received training from the PPTA team on the 
GRM. 
29. 
Project agencies (i.e., those directly involved in the project) comprise the PMO, the PPEs, 
contractors,  village  committees,  and  local  EPBs.  The  PMO  is  the  lead  agency  responsible  for 
overall  management,  implementation,  and  reporting  of  the  GRM.  The  PMO  environment  and 
social  officers  coordinate  the  GRM  and  will  (i)  instruct  the  concerned  PPEs,  local  EPBs,  and 
contractors on their responsibilities in the GRM; (ii) establish a simple registry system to document 
and  track  grievances  received  (including  forms  to  record  complaints  and  how  they  have  been 
resolved); and (iii) report on progress of the GRM in the semi-annual environmental monitoring 
and progress reports to ADB. 
30. 
The  full  list  of  GRM  officers  and  their  contact  points  is  in  Table  A5.1.  Each  PPE  has 
assigned an environmental and/or social contact person within their staff, who are responsible for 
implementation  of  the  GRM  and  other  relevant  aspects  of  the  EMP.  Tasks  include  keeping  a 
record of complaints. At least 2 months before construction commences, these contacts will be 
publicized at each PPE construction site and forwarded to local village committees to ensure that 
entry points to the GRM are well known. 
31.  GRM readiness procedures prior to start of construction. To be successful and reduce 
the  likelihood  of  public  concerns,  the  following  measures  will  be  implemented  before  any 
construction: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
Land acquisition. As per the project covenants, leasing agreements for land and 
buildings  or  other  facilities  to  be  leased  have  been  accepted  by  the  affected 
peoples  (women  and  men) that  are  leasing  all  or  portions  of their  land  or  other 
physical assets to the project. 
On-site procedures. (a) All contractors and work staff will be briefed by the PMO 
on the GRM. Contractors and workers will be instructed to be courteous to local 
residents  and,  in  the  event  they  are  approached  by  the  general  public  with  an 
issue, to immediately halt their work and report the issue to the foreman; and (b) 
at least one sign will be erected at each construction site providing the public with 
updated project information, the GRM process, and contact names and details for 
the GRM entry points (Table A5.1). 
Non-project  agencies. Prior  to  project  construction,  the PMO  and  will  notify  all 
relevant  agencies  about the  project  and GRM,  so that  if  these  agencies  receive 
complaints, they know to contact the PMO and follow up, as necessary. This will 
include, but not be limited to, local EPBs, the local courts, and police. 
32. 
The procedure and timeframe for the GRM is shown in Figure A5.1 and is as follows. 
(i) 
Stage 1 (maximum 15 working days). Affected persons or groups can submit a 
written or oral complaint to the project agencies (i.e., village committee, contractor, 
PPE, local EPB, PMO) as well as any other relevant institutions they wish to (e.g. 
the local courts, police, etc). Project agencies take the following steps in Stage 1 
if they receive a complaint. 
101 
102 
(a) 
(b) 
(c) 
(d) 
(e) 
(f) 
Step 1. Project agency receives complaint. Within 2 working days, notifies 
the PMO. 
Step  2. The PMO  assesses if  the  complaint is  eligible.  Within  1  working 
day  (i.e.,  maximum  of  3  working  days from  first  receipt  of the  complaint) 
informs the project agency handling the complaint of its eligibility. Eligible 
complaints  include  those  where  (i)  the  complaint  pertains  to  the  project; 
and (ii) the issues fall within the scope of environmental and social issues 
that the GRM is authorized to address. 
Step 3a—Eligible complaints. The agency attempts to resolve the issue 
directly  with  the  affected  person.  Within  5  working  days  of  receiving  the 
complaint, the agency will provide clear advice to the affected person on 
the proposed corrective action and by when it will be taken. In general, the 
corrective action(s) will be implemented not later than 10 working days from 
this point. If quick corrective action is not possible, or the agency receiving 
the complaint is unsure how to proceed, or the complainant is not satisfied 
by  the  initial  corrective  action,  then  the  complaint  will  be  referred  to  the 
PMO and Stage 2 actions. 
Step  3b—Ineligible  complaints.  If  a  complaint  is  assessed  to  be 
ineligible, the PMO and the project agency meet with the affected person 
and inform them. The PMO will ask the affected person if they would like to 
be referred to relevant agencies. 
Step 4. The project agency submits all documentation on the case to PMO. 
The PMO will enter the complaint and resolution in the complaints register. 
This will include making a written record of any oral complaints. 
Non-project  agencies.  In  the  event  that  non-project  agencies  receive 
complaints  and  refer  these  to  the  PMO,  the  PMO  will  follow  the  steps 
above. 
(ii) 
Stage  2  (maximum  10  working  days).  For  complaints  not  resolved  by  other 
project  agencies  in  Stage  1,  Stage  2  is  initiated.  The  PMO  environment  and/or 
social  officers  will meet  with the  affected  person  and together  discuss the  issue 
and identify possible solutions. Prior to the meeting, the PMO will ask the affected 
person if the subject agency (e.g., contractor, the PPE) and village committee can 
attend the meeting. At the meeting, a possible solution will be agreed upon. The 
subject  agency  (e.g., contractor, the PPE, village committee)  will implement  the 
agreed solution and report the outcome to the PMO within 5 working days of receipt 
of this advice. The PMO will also inform ADB and include all relevant documents 
in its progress reports to ADB. 
(iii) 
Stage 3 (maximum 6 weeks). If Stage 2 is unsuccessful (i.e., no solution can be 
identified  or the  affected  person  is  not satisfied  with the  proposed solution),  the 
PMO will refer the complaint to the PCG. The PCG will work with all stakeholders 
to  identify  a solution  acceptable to  all.  The  agreed  solution  will  be  implemented 
and a report on the outcome provided to the PMO within 4 weeks. 
33. 
Time limits for these steps are listed in Table A5.8.

Any costs incurred to receive, document, and address grievances will be paid by the PMO. 
34. 
The grievance procedures will remain valid throughout the duration of project construction and 
the first 2 years of project operation. 
The  tracking  and  documenting  of  grievance  resolutions  by  the  PMO  will  include  the 
35. 
following  elements:  (i)  tracking  forms  and  procedures  for  gathering  information  from  project 
personnel  and  complainant(s);  (ii)  regular  updating  of  the  GRM  database  by  the  PMO 
environment and social officers; (iii) processes for informing stakeholders about the status of a 
case;  and  (iv)  a  simple  but  effective  filing  system,  so  that  data  can  be  retrieved  for  reporting 
purposes, including reports to ADB. 
36. 
No  part  of the  project  GRM  affects  the  existing  rights  of  affected  persons  to  take their 
complaints to the courts. At any time in this process, an affected person may contact ADB (East 
Asia Department) directly, including ADB’s Resident Mission in the PRC (PRCM). 
37. 
If the above steps are unsuccessful, people adversely affected by the project may submit 
complaints  to  ADB’s  Accountability  Mechanism.  The  Accountability  Mechanism  provides  an 
independent  forum  and  process  whereby  people  adversely  affected  by  ADB-assisted  projects 
can voice, and seek a resolution of their problems, as well as report alleged violations of ADB‘s 
operational  policies  and  procedures.  Before  submitting  a  complaint  to  the  Accountability 
Mechanism, affected people should make a good faith effort to solve their problems by working 
with the concerned ADB operations department (in this case, ADB’s East Asia Department). Only 
after  doing  that,  and  if  they  are  still  dissatisfied,  should  they  approach  the  Accountability 
Mechanism.53

Cost Estimates 
The cost for EMP implementation comprises three items: mitigation measures (Table 
38. 
A5.2),  environmental  monitoring  (Table  A5.4),  and  training  (Table  A5.6).  The  costs  are 
summarized in Table A5.10. Excluded from the budget are (i) detailed design revisions and 
adjustments (ii) infrastructure costs which relate to environment and public health but which 
are already included in the project direct costs and (iii) remuneration for the PMO environment 
and  social  officers  and  loan  implementation  consultants.  All  costs,  including  training  were 
104 
105 
estimated by the PPTA team based on experience in similar projects. The need for the EMP 
and preliminary cost estimates were discussed with the PPEs during the PPTA phase. 
39. 
The PPEs will pay for compliance environmental monitoring costs during construction 
and initial operating phase. The PPEs and their contractors will pay for all mitigation measures 
during construction, including those specified in the contract documents and any unforeseen 
impacts due to construction activities. The PMO and the PPEs will bear the costs related to 
environmental supervision during construction and operation respectively. The PMO will bear 
the costs for training, the GRM, and the LIEC (Table A5.9).
