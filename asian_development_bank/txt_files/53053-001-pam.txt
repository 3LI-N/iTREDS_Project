FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT 
A. 
Financial Management Assessment  
The  financial  management  assessment  (FMA)  is  conducted  in  accordance  with ADB’s 
19. 
Technical Guidance Note: Financial Management Assessment.  
20. 
The FMA assesses the financial management capacity of Xichuan County Government 
(XCG)  as  executing  agency  (EA)  and  Water  Affairs  Bureau,  Housing,  and  Urban-Rural 
Construction Bureau, Tourism Service Center, Agriculture, and Rural Bureau, and Ecology and 
Environmental Bureau under the county as project implementing agencies (IA). The assessment 
covers funds-flow arrangements, staffing, accounting and financial reporting systems, internal and 
external auditing arrangements, and financial information systems. 
21. 
The assessment showed that the executing and implementing agencies have satisfactory 
financial  management  capability  to  (i)  record  required  financial  transactions  and  balances,  (ii) 
provide  regular  and  reliable  financial  statements  and  monitoring  reports,  and  (iii)  safeguard 
financial assets. 
22. 
The assessment identified the main financial management risks as: (i) implementation risk 
–  lack  of  familiarity  with  ADB  disbursement  procedures  and  requirements  which  could  delay 
project implementation; (ii) compliance risk – lack of familiarity with ADB financial management 
requirements,  particularly  on  accounting,  reporting,  and  auditing,  which  may  delay  project 
reporting  and  detail  identification  of  issues  on  the  use  of  loan  proceeds;  (iii)  operational 
risk/inadequate experience in building some project components such as cloud-based transport 
information system that could impact project progress and quality of the services to be provided 
after project completion.  
The overall financial management risk-rating of the project before considering mitigation 
23. 
measures is moderate. The identified financial management risks will be closely monitored during 
project implementation. The financial management action plan is as follows: 
Table V-1: Proposed Action Plan for Financial Management 
Action 
1. Training on ADB financial management 
requirements, including disbursement, accounting, 
asset registration, and management, auditing 
procedures, foreign exchange, and interest rate risk 
management

24. 
It was agreed that the EA and implementing agencies will further enhance their capabilities 
by  (i)  setting  up  clear  institutional  arrangements  and  coordination  mechanisms;  (ii)  completing 
staff deployment in appropriate financial management positions with English language support; 
(iii)  developing  methodologies  for  managing  foreign  exchange  and  interest  rate  risks;  and  (iv) 
undertaking more training, particularly on ADB policy, and procedures. 
The project’s financial management arrangements with appropriate mitigation measures 
25. 
are considered satisfactory. 
B. 
Payment Methods 
Summary 
(i) 
(ii) 
Direct payment may be used for large contracts. 
Reimbursement will be used for eligible expenditures incurred and paid for by the 
government out of its budget allocation or its own resources. 
(iii) 
Advance account: 
• 
the account will be established and maintained by  Henan Provincial Finance 
Department (HPFD), on behalf of Henan Provincial Government (HPG), after 
the loan becomes effective; 
•  HPG  will  be  responsible  for  the  use,  management,  replenishment,  and 
• 
• 
liquidation of the advance account; 
the  advance  account  will  be  exclusively  used  to  finance  the  ADB  share  of 
eligible expenditures; and 
the  outstanding  advance  (initial  advance  and  subsequent  deposits)  to  the 
advance  account  should  not  exceed  the  EA’s  estimate  of  ADB’s  share  of 
eligible expenditures for the  next  6 months  which  are to  be  paid through the 
advance account.  
1. 
Disbursement Arrangements for ADB Funds 
The  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  Loan  Disbursement 
26. 
Handbook  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time), 4 and  detailed  arrangements  agreed  upon 
between the government and ADB. Online training for project staff on disbursement policies and 
procedures  is  available.5 Project  staff  are  encouraged  to  avail  of  this  training  to  help  ensure 
efficient disbursement and fiduciary control.

5 Disbursement eLearning.http://wpqr4.adb.org/disbursement_elearning. 
26 
The  implementing  agencies  will  be  responsible  for  all  disbursement  arrangements  for 
27. 
expenditures related  to  the  implementation  of  subcomponents  in Xichuan  County,  including  (i) 
preparing disbursement projections, (ii) requesting budgetary allocations for counterpart funds, 
(iii)  collecting  supporting  documents,  and  (iv)  preparing  withdrawal  applications  that  will  be 
submitted to ADB by Henan Provincial Government (HPG). 
28. 
Each year, necessary amount of counterpart funding is allocated by XCG and disbursed 
upon request from the implementing agencies. For ADB’s loan proceeds, withdrawal applications 
to ADB will be prepared by the HPG on behalf of XCG. At the end of each year, realistic projections 
of contract awards/commitments and disbursement for the following calendar year will be made 
for an assessment and projection of ADB funds required to cover contract awards/commitments. 
The  PMO  will  be  responsible  for  preparing  contract  award/commitment  and  disbursement 
projections each year. 
29. 
Advance fund procedure. To facilitate project implementation through timely release of 
loan  proceeds,  HPFD  will  establish  an  advance account  promptly  after  loan effectiveness at  a 
commercial bank. The advance account is to be used exclusively for the ADB’s share of eligible 
expenditures.  
30. 
The currency of the advance account will be Euro. HPFD, who established the advance 
account in its name, is accountable, and responsible for proper use of advances to the advance 
account. The total outstanding advance to the advance account should not exceed the estimate 
of  ADB’s  share  of  eligible  expenditures  to  be  paid  through  the  advance  account  for  the 
forthcoming  6  months.  HPFD  may  request  for  initial  and  additional  advances  to  the  advance 
account based on an estimate of expenditure sheet setting out the estimated expenditures to be 
financed  through  the  account  for  the  forthcoming  6  months.  Supporting  documents  should  be 
submitted to ADB or retained by HPFD in accordance with ADB’s Loan Disbursement Handbook 
(2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  when  liquidating  or  replenishing  the  advance  account 
(footnote 2). 
Statement  of  Expenditure  (SOE)  procedure.  The  SOE  procedure6 may  be  used  for 
31. 
reimbursement  of  eligible  expenditures  or  liquidation  of  advances  to  the  advance  account. 
Supporting  documents  and  records  for  the  expenditures  claimed  under  the  SOE  should  be 
maintained and made readily available for review by ADB's disbursement and review missions, 
upon  ADB's  request  for  submission  of  supporting  documents  on  a  sampling  basis,  and  for 
independent audit.  
32. 
The minimum value per withdrawal application is $200,000 or 1% of the ADB loan amount, 
whichever  is  lower.  Individual  payments  below  this  amount  should  be  paid  by  implementing 
agencies and subsequently claimed from ADB (i) through reimbursement; or (ii) from the advance 
account, unless otherwise accepted by ADB. 
C. 
Accounting 
The EA will maintain, or cause to be maintained, separate books and records by funding

34. 
The  EA  will  prepare  consolidated  project  financial  statements  in  accordance  with  the 
government's accounting laws and regulations, which are consistent with international accounting 
principles and practices. 
D. 
Auditing and Public Disclosure 
35. 
The EA will cause the detailed consolidated project financial statements to be audited in 
accordance with national auditing standards by an independent auditor acceptable to ADB. The 
EA will submit the audited project financial statements together with the auditors’ opinion in the 
English language to ADB within 6 months of the end of the fiscal year. 
The annual audit report for the project accounts will include an audit management letter 
36. 
and audit opinions which cover (i) whether the project financial statements present a true and fair 
view or are presented fairly, in all material respects, in accordance with the applicable financial 
reporting framework; (ii) whether loan proceeds were used only for the purposes of the project or 
not; (iii) whether the borrower or executing agency was in compliance with the financial covenants 
contained in the legal agreements (where applicable). 
37. 
Compliance with financial reporting and auditing requirements will be monitored by review 
missions  and  during  normal  project  supervision,  and  followed  up  regularly  with  all  concerned, 
including the external auditor. 
38. 
The government and the executing and implementing agencies have been made aware 
of ADB’s approach to delayed submission, and the requirements for satisfactory and acceptable 
quality of the audited project financial statements. ADB reserves the right to require a change in 
the auditor (in a manner consistent with the constitution of the borrower), or for additional support 
to be provided to the auditor, if the audits required are not conducted in a manner satisfactory to 
ADB,  or  if  the  audits  are  substantially  delayed.  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  verify  the  project's 
financial accounts to confirm that the share of ADB’s financing is used in accordance with ADB’s 
policies and procedures. 
Public disclosure of the audited project financial statements, including the auditor’s opinion 
39. 
on the project financial statements, will be guided by ADB’s Access to Information Policy.8 After 
the  review,  ADB  will  disclose  the  audited  project  financial  statements  and  the  opinion  of  the 
auditors on the project financial statements no later than 14 days of ADB’s confirmation of their 
acceptability by posting them on ADB’s website. The management letter and additional auditor’s 
opinions will not be disclosed.

VI. 
PROCUREMENT AND CONSULTING SERVICES 
A. 
Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing 
The XCG and the five implementing agencies were advised that retroactive financing may 
40. 
only  apply  up  to  the  equivalent  of  20%  of  the  total  ADB  loan,  to  cover  eligible  expenditures 
incurred  for  civil  works,  goods,  and  consulting  services  procured  through  advance  contracting 
before loan effectiveness, but not more than 12 months before the signing of the loan agreement. 
41. 
All advance contracting and retroactive financing should be undertaken in conformity with 
ADB’s  Procurement  Policy:  Goods,  Works,  Nonconsulting  and  Consulting  Services  (2017,  as 
amended from time to time)9 and Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers: Goods, Works, 
Nonconsulting and Consulting Services (2017, as amended from time to time).10 The issuance of 
invitations  to  bid  under  advance  contracting  and  retroactive financing  will  be  subject  to  ADB’s 
prior approval. The approval of advance contracting and retroactive financing does not commit 
ADB to subsequently approve the project or to finance the procurement costs. In addition, ADB 
will  not  finance  expenditures  paid by the  EA  and  implementing  agencies prior to loan  or  grant 
effectiveness, even if advance contracting is approved, unless retroactive financing has also been 
approved by ADB.  
B. 
Procurement of Goods, Works, and Consulting Services 
42. 
All  procurement  of  goods  and  works  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB’s 
Procurement  Policy  and  Procurement  Regulations  for  ADB  Borrowers:  Goods,  Works, 
Nonconsulting and Consulting Services (2017, as amended from time to time). Open competitive 
bidding advertised nationally (OCB-AN) will be used for all civil works packages except for request 
for  payment  (RFQ)  packages  as  may  be  identified  in  the  procurement  plan.  For  goods  and 
equipment,  open  competitive  bidding  advertised  internationally  (OCB-AI)  will  only  be  used  for 
supply of high-tech equipment and systems (such as high precision biochemical detector, nuclear 
magnetic  resonance,  aeroengine,  and  business  application  information  system  development 
etc.);  OCB-AN  will  be  used  for  common  goods  and  equipment  packages  except  for  RFQ 
packages  identified  in  the  procurement  plan.  OCB-AI  shall  be  used  for  Support  and  Business 
Application  System  Development  and  Integration  of  Xichuan  Integrated  Information  System 
Construction  (contract  no.:  ISC-GS03-IT,  1S1E,  cost  estimated  at  $1.335  million).  For  the  first 
civil  works  and  goods  contracts  to  be  procured  through  OCB-AN,  the  draft  procurement 
documents in English (prequalification (if applicable), invitation for bids, bidding documents, bid 
evaluation reports, and draft negotiated contracts) should be submitted for ADB prior review and 
approval regardless of the estimated contract amount. Subsequent procurement through OCB-
AN are subject to post review (sampling). The executing and implementing agencies and PMO 
shall  retain  all  documentation  with  respect  to  each  contract  where  post  review  (sampling)  is 
required during project implementation and for at least 1 year after the project closing date. All 
contracts under advance contracting are subject to prior review. 
43. 
For  all  works  contracts  and  goods/installation  contracts,  separate  service  contracts  for 
quality control and site supervision will be procured by the local governments independent of the 
civil works or goods/installation contracts using country system requirements.

and expected contract preparation and implementation timeline is in subsection C. 
45. 
All consultants financed by ADB will be recruited according to Procurement Regulations 
for ADB Borrowers: Goods, Works, Nonconsulting and Consulting Services (2017, as amended 
from  time  to  time). 11  An  estimated  228  person-months  (22  international,  206  national)  of 
consulting  services  are  required  to:  (i)  facilitate  project  management  and  institutional 
strengthening,  (ii)  conduct  external  resettlement  and  social  monitoring,  (iii)  advise  on  project 
implementation  support  including  contract  management  and  disbursement,  and  (iv)  conduct 
integrated capacity building. 
The PMO will engage a national project management and procurement specialist by ADB 
46. 
initial  project  management  activities,  particularly  capacity  development  for 
funding  for 
implementation  of  the  project  performance  monitoring  system  (PPMS);  advance  procurement; 
and consultant recruitment, including recruitment of a team of consultants for project management 
support. The implementing agencies will engage national consultants by self-funding for detailed 
design, construction supervision, and quality inspection. 
1.  Open Competitive Bidding for Goods and Works 
OCB will be used for ADB financed contracts for works and goods. If a bidding attracts 
47. 
foreign companies, the bidding document will be written in English using the latest ADB standard 
bidding document for OCB advertised internationally packages, which can be downloaded from 
ADB  website.  If  a  bidding  does  not  attract  foreign  companies,  the  following  provisions  will  be 
applied: (i) an advertisement will be published on a national press, official gazette, or free, and 
publicly accessible website, as well as on the national e-procurement information and monitoring 
portal  at  the  ADB  special  section  of  the  China  Tendering  &  Bidding  Public  Service  Platform 
(http://www.cebpubservice.com);  (ii)  the  PRC  specific  standard  bidding  documents  (SBD, 
accepted by ADB, as updated in 2020) will be used unless otherwise agreed between the XCG 
and ADB; and (iii) documents for bidding and contract will only be in Chinese language (except 
for  documents  which  require  ADB’s  review  and  approval),  and  the  currencies  for  bidding  and 
payment will be in Chinese yuan (CNY) unless otherwise agreed between the XCG and ADB. If 
a  bidding  document  is  internationally  advertised,  regardless  of  ADB  prior  or  post  review 
(sampling)  arrangements,  the  invitations  for  bids  need  to  be  submitted  to  ADB  latest  1  week 
before the advertisement for parallel advertisement in Business Opportunities of ADB’s website. 
Unless  otherwise  agreed  between  XCG  and  ADB  and  set  forth  in  the  procurement  plan, 
procurement under OCB will use the single-stage one-envelope procedure. The relevant sections 
of  ADB’s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  will  be  included  in  all 
procurement documents and contracts.12

50. 
All  ADB  financed  individual  consultants,  consulting  firms,  and  above-mentioned 
monitoring agencies will be recruited according to ADB’s Procurement Policy and Procurement 
Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time). Consulting firms will be 
engaged using the quality- and cost-based selection (QCBS) method with a quality–cost ratio of 
90:10 or Consultants’ Qualifications Selection (CQS) method. The indicative terms of reference 
are in Appendixes 2–5. 
3.  ADB’s Prior Review and Post Review (Sampling) 
Following the ADB Procurement Review: Guidance Note on Procurement Review (June 
51. 
2018, as amended from time to time)13 for (i) all ADB financed contracts with advance contracting, 
and (ii) the first ADB financed contract of each type (OCB advertised internationally or nationally) 
for  civil  works  and  goods,  ADB’s  prior  review  and  approval  of  the  following  documents  (if 
applicable)  will  be  required:  invitation  for  bids,  bidding  document  and  relevant  clarification and 
addendum (if any), bid evaluation report, draft negotiated contract, and contract variations.  
ADB’s prior review is applicable to other complex packages with high risk and high value, 
52. 
based on the procurement risk assessment and strategic procurement planning. 
53. 
For OCB packages under post review (sampling), (i) ADB’s prior approval of the invitation 
for bids, bidding document, bid evaluation report, and draft negotiated contract (if applicable) will 
not be necessary, as long as the first type of OCB bidding document approved by ADB is used 
as the master bidding document without substantial modification; (ii) procurement process can be 
conducted without ADB’s prior approval; (iii) ADB reviews the bid evaluation report and signed 
contract after the contract is signed; and on sampling basis. Each sample size should cover at 
least 20% of the total number of the post review (sampling) contracts awarded before the initial 
post review (sampling), or between two consecutive post reviews (sampling). Total sample size 
aggregated should capture contracts representing (i) about 30%–50% of total project value and 
(ii)  about  20%  of  the  total  number  of  contracts  identified  for  post  review  (sampling).  It  should 
ensure that, to the extent possible, all types of contracts are included in the sample. 
For  all  ADB  financed  consultant  recruitment,  ADB’s  prior  review,  and  approval  of  each 
54. 
step will be required.

Comments 
The potential for attracting enough qualified bidders to ensure contracts are 
delivered on time was examined in the strategic procurement planning and 
procurement risk assessment. It was concluded that all of civil works and 
goods contracts can be advertised nationally (AN) and using PRC specific 
SBD  for  works  and  goods  (updated  in  2020)  and  following  the  open 
competitive  bidding  (OCB)  procedures,  except  the  contract  package 
(No.:ISC-GS03-IT) 
for  Support  and  Business  Application  System 
Development  and  Integration  of  Xichuan’s  Integrated  Information  System 
which will follow OCB advertised internationally (AI) using ADB’s SBD for 
Procurement of IT Products and Services. 
ADB's prior review applies to (i) the first OCB-AN for works; (ii) the first OCB-
AN  for  goods  and/or  nonconsulting  services;  (iii)  OCB-AI  for  integrated 
information system development and integration. 
All other packages will be for post review (sampling) by ADB. 
The  RFQ  (if  any)  will  be  applied  for  small/simple  contracts  in  the 
procurement of goods, works, and nonconsulting services.  
RFQ packages will be subject to post review (sampling). 
Distribution  of  environmental  protection  publicity  lectures  and  brochures, 
and  for  public  service  advertising,  public  service  video  production,  and 
publicity,  the  Community  Participation  in  Procurement  (CPP)  shall  be 
applicable.  
Special  procedures  and  review  arrangements  for  CPP  will  defined  and 
approved by ADB prior to its implementation.

VII. 
SAFEGUARDS 
76. 
Prohibited  investment  activities.  Pursuant  to  ADB’s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement 
(2009),  ADB  funds  may  not  be  applied  to  the  activities  described  on  the  ADB  Prohibited 
Investment Activities List set forth at Appendix 5 of the Safeguard Policy Statement (2009).  
A. 
Environment 
77. 
Domestic  EIAs  and  consolidated  IEE.  The  project  is  classified  as  environmental 
category B. Domestic Environmental Impact Assessment reports (DEIAs) were prepared for each 
of  the  subprojects  and  were  reviewed  and  approved  by  Xichuan  Ecology  and  Environment 
Department (EED). The methods and standards applied in the preparation of DEIAs for the project 
components are in accordance with the guidelines of the Ministry of Ecology and Environment, 
and also meet national, and provincial laws and regulations. A consolidated initial environmental 
examination (IEE), including an environmental management plan and environmental monitoring 
program, was prepared, which complies with ADB’s policies and requirements, including ADB's 
Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). The IEE was disclosed in ADB website on 5 October 2020. 
78. 
Environmental  Management  Plan  (EMP).  An  EMP  has  been  developed  covering  all 
subprojects.  The  EMP  defines  all  potential  impacts  of  the  project  components,  mitigation 
measures  to  avoid,  or  reduce  these  impacts  to  acceptable  levels,  monitoring  measures,  and 
defines the responsibilities, procedures, and budgets for implementation of the EMP. 
79. 
EMP Implementation Responsibilities. The XCG will have the overall accountability for 
the  overall  project  and  its  subprojects  for  ensuring  compliance  with  the  PRC’s  laws  and 
regulations as well as the provisions of ADB’s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). PMO will also 
be  accountable  for  ensuring  the  implementation  of  the  environmental  management  plan  and 
responsible for ensuring the implementation of the specific mitigation measures as prescribed in 
the EMP. 
80. 
The  PMO,  through  the  environmental  officer,  and  in  coordination  with  the  Loan 
Implementation  Environmental  Consultant  (LIEC)  will  prepare  and  provide  the  following 
specification clauses for incorporation in the contract documents for project implementation: (i) 
environmental  management  requirements  to  be  budgeted  by  PMO  and  their  construction 
contractors; (ii) environmental clauses for contractual terms and conditions; and (iii) the EMP. 
81. 
A LIEC will be contracted by the PMO to provide assistance during the pre-construction, 
construction, and initial operational periods. The LIEC should be contracted as soon as possible 
after loan approval so that the LIEC can assist in the important pre-construction activities listed in 
the  EMP.  The  LIEC  will  advise  the  PMO  on  all  aspects  of  environmental  management  and 
monitoring  for  the  Project.  The  LIEC  will  ensure  the  compliance  of  construction  and  initial 
operation activities with the mitigation and management measures in the EMP and report to the 
ADB. 
82. 
PMO  will  be  responsible  for  (i)  updating  the  IEE  and  EMP  during  detailed  design  as 
required, and establishing the grievance redress mechanism (Section VII.D); (ii) implementing the 
EMP and developing further implementation details; (iii) supervising their staff and contractors’ 
implementation of mitigation measures during construction; (iv) implementing training programs 
for construction crews; (v) incorporating environmental management, monitoring, and mitigation 
measures into construction and operation management plans; (vi) developing and implementing 
internal regular environmental monitoring; (vii) redressing public grievances; and (viii) reporting 
performance of the EMP to ADB semiannually. 
83. 
The environmental performance of the project will be verified by an external environmental 
monitoring agency (EMA). The EMA will be contracted by the PMO. The EMA will conduct the 
external monitoring of EMP implementation. The results will be forwarded to the PMO and to the 
EPBs at the district/county level, delegated by provincial EPD, who will ensure compliance with 
the PRC and local environmental regulations. 
Training. Environmental officer(s) in PMO and IAs will receive training in environmental 
84. 
management,  environmental  monitoring,  and  supervision,  mitigation  planning,  emergency 
response, environmental policy-making, and other environmental management techniques. PMO 
will  ensure  that  the  training  plan  defined  in  the  EMP  is  implemented.  The  LIEC  will  facilitate 
training. The scope of training will also include efficient and effective environmental monitoring at 
the project operation phase. 
85. 
EMP  Costs.  Cost  estimates  for  mitigation  measures,  environmental  monitoring,  and 
training in EMP procedures are estimated in the EMP. Before implementing a monitoring plan, 
responsible  agencies  will  present  a  more  detailed  breakdown  of  the  estimated  budget.  During 
project  implementation,  the  budgets  will  be  adjusted  based  on  actual  requirements.  PMO  and 
their contractors will bear the costs for all mitigation measures during construction, which will be 
included in the contract documents. The IAs will also bear the costs related to mitigation measures 
during operation. 
B. 
Involuntary Resettlement 
The project is classified as category “B” for involuntary resettlement according to ADB’s 
86. 
Safeguard Policy Statement (SPS, 2009).  
44 
87. 
The project will involve land acquisition/transfer and resettlement impacts. It will require a 
total land use of 3,184.73 mu, including the state-owned land occupation (SLO) of 491.09 mu, 
permanent land acquisition (PLA) of 2,309.64 mu, and land use rights transfer (LURT) of 384 mu. 
In addition, 1,841.6 mu land will be used temporarily during construction. No households will be 
physically relocated. A total of 728 households with 2,815 persons will be affected by the project’s 
permanent land acquisition, of which, 4 households with 8 persons will experience more than 10% 
income loss because of permanent land acquisition. In addition, 151 households with 604 persons 
will  be  affected  by  temporarily  land  occupation.  The  due  diligence  was  carried  out  on  existing 
facilities confirming that there are no outstanding and legacy issues of past land acquisition. The due 
diligence of existing LURT confirmed no outstanding issues; and a LURT framework has been 
prepared for voluntary LURT agreements to be completed during project implementation. 
88. 
The Government will ensure that (i) the draft Resettlement Plan that was prepared for the 
project and that is agreed between the Government and ADB is updated based on final detailed 
design  and  detailed measurement  surveys,  and  submitted to  ADB for  review  and concurrence 
prior to land acquisition and house demolition activities and prior to contract award of concerned 
civil works contracts, and be implemented in accordance with applicable Government laws and 
regulations and ADB’s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009); in case of any inconsistency between 
Government  laws  and  ADB’s  policy,  the  latter  will  prevail;  (ii) all  affected  persons  are  given

C. 
Indigenous Peoples/Ethnic Minorities 
89. 
The project is categorized as category C on indigenous peoples; and it is not expected to 
impact distinct and vulnerable communities of indigenous peoples or ethnic minorities. There are 
Hui, Man, Mongolian ethnic minority population accounting for 0.64% of the total population in the 
project  area,  and  no  significant  differences  exist  between  them  and  Han  residents  in terms  of 
language and socioeconomic conditions. The ethnic minority population will benefit from improved 
services and employment opportunities under the project. 
D. 
Grievance Redress Mechanism 
90. 
A Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM) has been established to prevent and address 
community concerns, reduce risks, and assist the project to maximize environmental and social 
benefits.  The  PMO  will  act  as  the  head  office  for  the  GRM,  establishing  a  tracking,  and 
documentation system of complaints and responses. The project implementing agencies (IAs) will 
operate the GRM at the local level and will ensure that all complaints received and immediately 
resolved are reported, and that more difficult issues are referred to the PMO for a coordinated 
response. PMO will report all GRM records to the ADB through semiannual progress reports. 
VIII.  GENDER AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS 
91. 
Social  and  Poverty  Dimensions.  A  poverty,  gender  and  social  analysis  (PSA)  of  the 
Project  was  conducted  under  the  guiding  frameworks  on  social  development,  gender,  poverty 
reduction, ethnic minorities, resettlement, and public participation in ADB’s Handbook on Poverty 
and Social Analysis: A Working Document (2012), ADB’s Guidelines for Gender Mainstreaming 
Categories of ADB Projects (2012) and ADB’s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009).  
In total, 605,080 people in the 17 project towns/subdistricts are identified as project direct 
92. 
beneficiaries, including 307,381 rural residents (50.8% of the total), 286,808 women (47.4%), and 
89,921 poor people 14 (15%). The project will benefit: (i) 382,827 rural and urban residents, who 
will  have  access  to  safety  water  supply;  (ii)  367,239  rural  and  urban  residents,  who  will  have 
access to livable environment through improved river embankment management, soil, and water 
conservation,  sewage  management,  kitchen  waste  and  municipal  sludge  management;  (iii) 
13,703 rural residents, agricultural cooperatives, and enterprises, who/which will have access to 
improved rural infrastructure, smart irrigation facilities and cold storages; and (iv) restaurants and 
enterprises  having  canteens  in  the  urban  area  of  the  county  and  the  center  area  of  the 
towns/townships of the county, which will access to improved kitchen waste management. 
93. 
Employment  targets  for  vulnerable  groups  and  women  are  included  in  the  design  and 
monitoring  framework  (DMF)  and  loan assurances.  This  will  provide  the  local  people including 
women, and APs an opportunity to have temporary jobs. The local people including women will 
also  have  the  opportunity  to  participate  in  capacity  building/public  awareness  campaign  on 
improved  health  and  sanitation,  environmental  protection  that  will  be  conducted  during  the 
duration of project implementation phase. 
94. 
A  Social  Development  Action  Plan  (SDAP)  has  been  prepared  to  facilitate  continued 
consultation and participation of communities in the project, as well as ensure that labor rights 
and entitlements are observed and that the needs of poor households are considered. 
95. 
The SDAP indicates that civil works contracts will stipulate (i) that local people will receive 
priority  with  respect  to  employment;  (ii)  Contractors  will  sign  labor  contract  with  construction 
workers and follow labor regulations. 
96. 
Gender  Dimension.  The  project  has  been  designed  as  effective  gender 
mainstreaming. Women focus group discussions found that environmental improvements, better 
service of water supply and wastewater treatment are anticipated to have a significant positive 
impact toward gender equality. The project will also create women’s employment opportunities. 
A gender action plan (GAP) has been prepared to ensure that women benefit from the various 
activities  under  the  project  and  are  kept  fully  informed  and  consulted  throughout  its 
implementation. Gender specific indicators have also been included in the project’s design and 
monitoring framework.  
97. 
The  gender  action  plan  (GAP)  includes  specific  measures  and  targets  for  women, 
including (i) fair and equitable participation in decision-making during project design, with at least 
40% women participants; (ii) in Xipingtou Village, promote women’s participation in the project 
design,  implementation  and  supervision  of  Xipingtou  Village  watershed  management  by 
community  women  committee‘s  leadership  trainings  and  capacity  building  activities;  (iii)  In  the

four  villages  of  Xichuan  County  Rural  Infrastructure  Construction  Project,  initiate  “Beautiful 
Family” activities led by Village Women's Committees to promote women’s engagement in the 
beautiful village governance; (iv) priority employment opportunities for women, with 25% quota of 
skilled  jobs  and  35%  quota  of  non-skilled  jobs  for  women;  (v)provide  awareness  trainings  on 
environment protection and skills trainings in agriculture and tourism aspects, with at least 40% 
women participants. Key gender targets have also been included in the design and monitoring 
framework. 
federations,  contractors, 
For effective GAP implementation, the GAP includes provisions to ensure that staff of the 
98. 
PMO and Implementing Agencies is fully briefed on gender in development and the GAP, at the 
commencement of project implementation. The staff responsible for social safeguards and gender 
will  work  with  women’s 
related  government  agencies,  and 
community/village office staff to facilitate the participation of women in opportunities for physical 
works; and, ensure that all PRC labor laws and core labor standards are respected. The staff will 
also ensure (i) gender disaggregated baseline and survey data will be collected, (ii) the GAP is 
implemented, monitored, and reported to ADB as part of the semiannual project progress reports. 
Progress in implementation of actions and achievement of GAP targets will also be reported in 
midterm and project completion reports. Social development and gender specialists engaged for 
project management support will mentor the staff as necessary and facilitate achievement of the 
project’s  gender  and  development  objectives.  The  GAP  will  be  monitored  during  ADB  review 
missions and supervision will be supported by ADB’s social development specialist.

B. 
Monitoring 
99. 
To monitor the progress of the project in achieving the planned outcome and outputs, the 
PMO  will  establish  a  project  performance  monitoring  system  (PPMS)  before  the  project 
implementation  starts  (before  loan  effectiveness),  and  will  maintain  accordingly.  The  basis  for 
project  performance  monitoring  and  reporting  will  be  the  DMF  which  identifies  performance 
targets for the outcomes and outputs of the project. It will be designed to permit adequate flexibility 
to  adopt  remedial  action  regarding  project  design,  schedules,  activities,  and  development 
impacts.  The  PPMS  will  cover  the  following  aspects  of  the  project  implementation:  (i)  project 
physical  and  financial  progress;  (ii)  progress  and  results  of  capacity  development;  (iii)  farmer 
institutions  establishment;  (iv)  implementation  of  EMP;  (v)  implementation  of  GAP,  SDAP, 
Resettlement Plan, LURT Framework; and (vi) compliance with loan covenants (policy, financial, 
economic,  sector,  and  others).  The  PMO  agreed  and  confirmed  that  they  will  (i)  establish  the 
PPMS before the loan effectiveness; (ii) recruit the LICs before the loan effectiveness to facilitate 
the project start-up and provide consulting service as described in Appendix 2; (iii) confirm that 
targets are achievable; and (iv) develop recording, monitoring, and reporting arrangements. 
100.  Compliance monitoring. During project implementation, ADB and the PMO will closely 
monitor the  compliance of  all  the covenants  under the  project  and  will  take necessary remedy 
actions for  any  noncompliance.  The compliance  requirements  are  given  in the  EMP, and their 
status will be reported in the semiannual progress reports by the PMO and will be reviewed during 
project  review  missions.  Compliance  monitoring  will  also  be  undertaken  by  (i)  the  PMO’s 
environment officer to ensure overall compliance of all relevant agencies with the EMP, and (ii) 
the  PMO’s  social  officer  to  ensure  overall  compliance  with  the  relevant  social,  gender,  and 
resettlement plans. Semiannual environmental monitoring reports and social monitoring reports 
will be prepared by the PMO, supported by the LICs, and will be submitted by the PMO to ADB. 
101.  Environmental  monitoring.  Three  types  of  environment  safeguard  monitoring  will  be 
conducted under the EMP: compliance monitoring, internal monitoring, and external monitoring. 
The  environmental  monitoring  program,  including  roles,  responsibilities,  monitoring  frequency, 
and  variables,  is  described  in  the  EMP.  ADB  and  the  PMO  will  monitor  the  status  of  EMP 
implementation through: (i) semiannual project progress reports and semiannual environmental 
monitoring reports to ADB; and (ii) review missions. EMP implementation will be coordinated by 
the PMO environment officer, supported by the LICs, and IAs, to ensure overall compliance of all 
relevant agencies with the EMP. 
102.  Resettlement  monitoring.  Internal  and  external  monitoring  of  the  resettlement  plan 
implementation will be conducted. The PMO will carry out internal supervision and monitoring to 
ensure compliance with the provisions of the resettlement plan and LURT Framework, and submit 
internal  resettlement  monitoring  reports  semiannually  during  project  implementation,  to  be 
submitted together with the semiannual social monitoring reports. The PMO will also employ an 
external monitoring organization to conduct external monitoring. The external monitoring agency 
will  prepare  a  baseline  study  and  implement  external  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  the 
resettlement plan and LURT Framework implementation. Semiannual external monitoring reports 
will be prepared and submitted to the PMO and ADB during the project implementation. 
103.  Gender  and  social  dimensions  monitoring.  Project  activities  will  be  monitored  for 
impacts on gender and social dimensions with the assistance of PICs. In particular, the activities 
laid out in the GAP and SDAP will be monitored, and sex-disaggregated data on project activities 
collected.  GAP  and  SDAP  monitoring  information  will  be  included  in  the  semiannual  social 
monitoring reports and will describe the progress on GAP and SDAP implementation against the 
57 
targets. The format of social monitoring report will be finalized and agreed between ADB and the 
PMO during the project inception.  
C. 
Evaluation 
technical,  environmental,  social,  poverty  reduction,  economic, 
104. 
In addition to regular monitoring, project performance will be reviewed at least once a year 
jointly by ADB and XCG. The review will assess implementation performance and achievement 
of  project  outcomes  and  outputs,  assess  financial  progress,  identify  issues  and  constraints 
affecting  implementation,  and  work  out  a  time-bound  action  plan  for  their  solution.  ADB  will 
undertake  annual  project  reviews  during  the  project  period.  Additionally,  ADB,  and  XCG  will 
undertake  a  midterm  review  of  the  project  in  2024,  covering  all  institutional,  administrative, 
organizational, 
financial, 
procurement,  and  other  relevant  aspects  that  may  have  an  impact  on  the  performance  of  the 
project and its continuing viability. The review will (i) examine the progress in implementing project 
outputs;  (ii)  evaluate  the  project’s  environment,  social,  and  poverty  impacts;  (iii)  ensure 
compliance  with  assurances  in  the  loan  agreement;  and  (iv)  evaluate  the  effectiveness  of  the 
procurement  implementation  activities  of  the  executing  agency  and  tendering  company  using 
procurement review for effective implementation evaluation. The review shall also undertake a 
comprehensive review of potential loan savings, identify areas for reallocation of loan proceeds, 
and change disbursement percentages, as appropriate. Within 6 months of physical completion 
of the project, the XCG will submit a project completion report to ADB.15 
D. 
Reporting 
105.  The XCG, acting through the PMO, will provide ADB with (i) semiannual project progress 
reports  in  a  format  consistent  with  ADB's  project  performance  reporting  system,  including  (a) 
progress achieved by output as measured through the indicator's performance targets, (b) key 
implementation  issues  and  solutions,  (c)  updated  procurement  plan,  and  (d)  updated 
implementation  plan  for  the  next  12 months;  (ii)  semiannually  environment  monitoring  reports; 
and  (iii)  a  project  completion  report  within  6  months  of  physical  completion  of  the  project.  To 
ensure that the project will continue to be both viable and sustainable, project accounts and the 
audited  project  financial  statements  together  with  the  associated  auditor's  report,  should  be 
adequately reviewed. 
E. 
Stakeholder Communication Strategy 
106.  Project  information  will  be  communicated  through  public  consultation,  information 
disclosure  mechanism  in  ADB’s  and  government’s  website,  meetings,  interviews,  focus  group 
discussions,  and  community  consultation meetings,  in  accordance  with ADB’s  requirements  of 
information  disclosure  policy.  Main  stakeholders  are  the  different  government  agencies, 
beneficiaries, displaced persons, and participants in the project implementation.  
107.  Environment.  Meaningful  public  participation  and  consultations,  and  information 
disclosure  were  conducted  during  project  preparation.  Information  disclosure  and  public 
consultations  included  posters  in  public  bulletin  boards,  local  governments’  websites  and 
newspaper  disclosure;  informal  and  formal  communication  with  key  stakeholders,  including 
residents,  local  authorities,  and  implementing  agencies;  questionnaire  surveys;  and  wider 
stakeholder  meetings  attended  by  affected  people,  nearby  communities,  and  other  concerned 
stakeholders. A GRM has been designed to prevent and address community concerns, reduce 
risks, and assist the project in maximizing environmental and social benefits. The project IEE and 
15    Project completion report format is available at:

58 
EMP  have  been  disclosed  on  the  ADB  website  and  the  domestic  environmental  assessment 
reports are available from the executing agency and provincial and local bureaus of ecology and 
environment.  During  implementation,  (i)  the  translated  EMP  will  be  circulated  to  all  project 
agencies,  and  (ii)  public  consultations  will  be  held  with  affected  communities  before  works  to 
inform about the established GRM and the planned works, and during, and after works to monitor 
community feedback and concerns.  
Involuntary  resettlement.  Affected  households,  villages  and 
108. 
towns/townships 
governments  will  be  involved  in  updating  and  implementing  the  resettlement  plan.  Through 
meetings,  interviews,  focus  group  discussions,  public  consultation  workshops,  and  community 
consultation meetings, local representatives have participated in the planning stage and concerns 
have been integrated into the resettlement plan. Before implementation, the PMO, Implementing 
Agencies and other relevant agencies will further discuss and consult with the affected persons’ 
representatives  in  every  town/township  to  update  the  resettlement  plan  to  ensure  affected 
persons’  rights  are  protected  during  project  implementation.  The  PMO  and  Implementing 
Agencies  will  disclose  the  updated  resettlement  plan  in  the  local  government  offices  and  to 
affected  people.  The  updated  resettlement  plan  will  also  be  posted  on  the  ADB  website. 
Resettlement  information  booklet  was  distributed  to  affected  households  during  the  project 
preparation,  which  contained  information  such  as  the  affected  project  area,  proposed  land 
acquisition,  compensation  standards  for  land  acquisition,  assistance  and  livelihood  restoration 
strategy.  The  PMO  and  implementing  agencies  will  be  responsible  for  supervision  of 
implementation of resettlement plan, continued public consultation, monitoring of progress, and 
response  to  grievances.  The  grievance  redress  procedures  have  been  included  in  the 
resettlement plan and disclosed to affected people. 
109.  SDAP and GAP. Consultations with communities have taken place and will continue at 
implementation of the SDAP and GAP. Special attention will be paid to the participation of women 
and vulnerable groups. 
X. 
ANTICORRUPTION POLICY 
110.  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its  agents,  any  violations  of  the 
Anticorruption Policy relating to the project.16 All contracts financed by ADB shall include provisions 
specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of the executing agency 
and  all  project  contractors,  suppliers,  consultants,  and  other  service  providers.  Individuals  and/or 
entities on ADB’s anticorruption debarment list are ineligible to participate in ADB financed activity 
and may not be awarded any contracts under the project.17  
111.  To support these efforts, relevant provisions are included in the loan and project agreement 
and  the  bidding  documents  for  the  project.  The  project  design  and  implementation  arrangements 
provide for mitigating corruption risks. Risks associated with project management will be mitigated 
by (i) training of the executing and implementing agencies’ staff in the procurement of civil works, 
goods, and services under the project; and (ii) periodic inspection of contractors’ activities related to 
fund withdrawals and settlements by the executing agency’s staff.

17 ADB's Office of Anticorruption and Integrity: https://www.adb.org/site/integrity/main 
112.  People  who  are,  or  may  in  the  future  be,  adversely  affected  by  the  project  may  submit 
complaints  to  ADB’s  Accountability  Mechanism.  The  Accountability  Mechanism  provides  an 
independent forum and process whereby people adversely affected by ADB-assisted projects can 
voice,  and  seek  a  resolution  of  their  problems,  as  well  as  report  alleged  violations  of  ADB’s 
operational policies and procedures. Before submitting a complaint to the Accountability Mechanism, 
affected  people  should  make  an  effort  in  good  faith  to  solve  their  problems  by  working  with  the 
concerned ADB operations department. Only after doing that, and if they are still dissatisfied, should 
they approach the Accountability Mechanism.18

Scope of Services and Consultants’ Inputs 
According  to  ADB’s  requirements,  the  implementation  of  the  resettlement  plan  should  -
7. 
besides internal monitoring undertaken by the XPMO and IAs—be monitored by the EMA. The EMA 
to be selected will monitor the implementation of the resettlement plan, LURTF, SDAP, and GAP 
and report progress semiannually during the implementation of LAR for the project, and annually for 
two years after the completion of the LAR for the whole project. The EMA will establish an M&E team. 
The main duties of the team are to (i) carry out the M&E on the implementation of the resettlement 
plan, LURTF, SDAP, and GAP to ensure it is in compliance with ADB-approved plans; (ii) advise 
PMO and IAs on the implementation of the resettlement plans LURTF, SDAP, and GAP to ensure 
relevant policies and procedures are complied with; and (iii) provide information and data, monitoring
