Project Administration Manual Purpose and Process 
1.  The  project  administration  manual  (PAM)  describes  the  essential  administrative  and 
management requirements to implement the project on time, within budget, and in accordance 
with the policies and procedures of the government and Asian Development Bank (ADB). The 
PAM should include references to all available templates and instructions either through linkages 
to relevant URLs or directly incorporated in the PAM. 
2.  The  Ministry  of  Emergency  Situations  is  wholly  responsible  for  the  implementation  of  ADB-
financed projects, as agreed jointly between the borrower and ADB, and in accordance with the 
policies and  procedures of the  government  and ADB.  ADB  staff  is  responsible  for  supporting 
implementation  including  compliance  by  Ministry  of  Emergency  Situations  of  their  obligations 
and  responsibilities  for  project  implementation  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  policies  and 
procedures. 
3.  At loan negotiations, the borrower and ADB shall agree to the PAM and ensure consistency with 
the loan and grant agreements. Such agreement shall be reflected in the minutes of the loan 
negotiations. In the event of any discrepancy or contradiction between the PAM and the  loan 
and grant agreements, the provisions of the loan and grant agreements shall prevail. 
4.  After ADB Board approval of the project's report and recommendations of the President (RRP), 
changes in implementation arrangements are subject to agreement and approval pursuant to 
relevant government and ADB administrative procedures (including the Project Administration 
Instructions) and upon such approval, they will be subsequently incorporated in the PAM. 
I. 
PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
1. 
This project is the Asian Development Bank’s (ADB) first integrated preemptive landslide 
risk reduction investment to safeguard rural communities in the Kyrgyz Republic.1 The project will 
take a comprehensive approach combining structural (including civil works and equipment) and 
non-structural (strategy, training, and analysis) interventions. 
2. 
The project outcome will be: vulnerability and exposure of communities and infrastructure 
to landslide events reduced. The project is aligned with the following impacts: human and material 
loss  from  climate-  and  geophysical-related  disasters  reduced  and  level  of  protection  of  the 
population and territories from emergency situations increased for sustainable development. 
Output 1: Landslide mitigation engineering measures implemented. The exposure of 
3. 
at-risk  communities  to  landslides  will  be  reduced  through  mitigation  engineering  measures  in 
about 15–20 subprojects. These include unloading soil overburden, reshaping bulging or cracked 
areas  on  hillsides,  and  draining  underground  and  surface  water.  Subprojects  will  incorporate 
considerations for future climate change. Nature-based solutions, including regreening and timber 
retaining  and  drainage  structures,  will  be  implemented  where  appropriate.  Beneficiary 
communities,  particularly  women  and  households  headed  by  women,  will  be  engaged  in  the 
planning,  implementation,  and  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  of  subprojects.  Sustainable 
asset  management  and  O&M  plans  and  budgets  will  be  prepared  and  implemented  for  each 
subproject. These will identify roles and responsibilities for community representatives. 
4. 
Output  2:  Systems  for  on-site  and  national  landslide  monitoring  improved.  The 
landslide  risk  monitoring  capacity  of  the  MES,  at-risk  communities,  and  other  stakeholders 
including the KCHE, MTACC, and local authorities will be modernized. The project will establish 
an integrated risk-based multilevel landslide monitoring system. It will combine on-site monitoring 
and a pilot national landslide monitoring approach using satellite-based interferometric synthetic 
aperture radar (InSAR). On-site monitoring systems will be installed in about 20 subprojects not 
included under output 1.2 The pilot InSAR system will provide broad-based monitoring of surface 
displacements and analysis of historical slope movement, and support the updating of the national 
landslide inventory under output 3. The integrated system will be linked to the existing national 
early warning system and the network of crisis management centers. Beneficiary communities, 
particularly women and households headed by women, will be engaged for planning and O&M of 
monitoring  sites.  Associated  gender-sensitive  training  will  be  provided  to  key  government  and 
community stakeholders. Sustainable asset management and O&M plans and budgets will also 
be prepared and implemented for each monitoring subproject. 
5. 
Output 3: Capacity for landslide risk management strengthened. The capacity of the 
MES,  at-risk  communities,  government  agencies  including  local  authorities,  and  other 
stakeholders for landslide risk assessment, mitigation, and resettlement will be strengthened. The 
project  will  develop  a  gender-sensitive  national  landslide  risk  management  road  map.  It  will 
develop  a  geographic-information-system-based  platform  and  database  to  assess  landslide 
hazard, exposure, and vulnerability with sex-disaggregated data. This will build on the existing 
data-sharing platform and risk maps. Updated maps will be disseminated to key government and 
community  stakeholders  to  support  coordination  and  planning.  The  project  will  develop 
1  A landslide is the movement of a mass of rock, debris, or earth down a slope. Landslides can be initiated by rainfall, 
snowmelt,  changes  in  ground  water,  earthquakes,  disturbance  by  human  activities,  or  any  combination  of  these 
factors. Source: United States Geological Survey. What is a landslide and what causes one? 
2  The systems are expected to comprise sensors to measure and assess slope stability, groundwater levels, and key 
trigger variables. 
2 
procedures and case studies to strengthen institutional capacity for planning, implementation, and 
O&M of landslide mitigation and resettlement. Emphasis will be given to community engagement 
and  consideration  for  future  climate  change  impacts  to  ensure  long-term  sustainability  and 
effectiveness.3 The project will conduct a participatory gender-sensitive landslide risk awareness, 
planning, and information-sharing program for at-risk communities. The MES staff will be trained 
in  O&M  and  financial  management  of  O&M  to  strengthen  their  internal  asset  management 
systems, records, and safeguards. 
The project will apply a sector lending approach in selecting and implementing landslide 
6. 
risk  management  subprojects  under  output  1.  A  feasibility  study,  including  geotechnical  and 
geophysical  survey  and site  landslide  risk  mapping,  has  been  undertaken for  a representative 
subproject in Ayusai, Ayu village, Osh oblast.4 The MES has prepared a long list of 46 prospective 
subprojects, which have undergone preliminary assessment during project preparation.5  To be 
financed under the project, the subprojects must comply with the applicable selection criteria and 
procedures  described  in  Section  III  (D)  below.  Eligibility  criteria  include:  (i)  ideally  9%  and 
minimum  6%  expected  economic  internal  rate  of  return;  (ii)  category  B  or  C  environment  and 
social  safeguard  classification  and  avoiding  or  minimizing  permanent  land  acquisition  and 
resettlement; and (iii) no association with a uranium mining site.

Selection and Approval of Civil Works Subprojects  
14. 
In accordance with the ADB sector modality approach, subprojects under Output 1 will 
be selected and prepared for implementation in line with the following procedures and subject to 
project budget. A feasibility study has already been prepared for one representative landslide 
risk  management  subproject  in  Ayu  Village.  Subprojects  (sites)  may  be  grouped  together  as 
appropriate into individual civil works procurement packages. 
1. 
Subproject Eligibility Criteria 
15. 
The PIU with support of the PIC will identify, evaluate, and select civil works subprojects 
based on the following criteria: (i) alignment of subproject objectives with the overall purpose of 
the project; (ii) quality and resilience standards; (iii) safeguards compliance; and (iv) economic 
viability and financial sustainability. 
Criterion 1: Subproject Objectives 
16. 
A subproject will be selected if: 
(i) 
(ii) 
It will physically mitigate the risks of landslide to households, infrastructure, and 
economic activities consistent with the project design and monitoring framework 
(DMF) and gender action plan (GAP) (see Sections VIII and IX below); and 
It will not finance deferred O&M activities. 
Criterion 2: Quality Control Standards 
17. 
Risk  mitigation  subprojects  will  incorporate  (i)  best  practices  in  disaster  risk  reduction 
and management, (ii) multi-hazard resistance standards (as applicable), and (iii) lessons learned 
13 
from previous landslides and/or similar projects in the country or region. The PIU with support of 
the PIC will (i) consider a range of technical alternatives and select options based on life-cycle 
costs and economic viability; (ii) actively seek to maximize community consultation engagement 
in site selection, planning, design and construction, and subsequent O&M, with emphasis on the 
participation  of  women  and  female-headed  households;  (iii)  minimize  adverse  environmental 
and social impacts including seeking to restore vegetation, land access, and land use to pre-
mitigation  conditions 
for 
implementation  within  and  across  subprojects;  and  (v)  ensure  safe  site  handover  and  O&M 
including any subsequent third-party construction within the previously at-risk areas. 
following  subproject  completion; 
(iv)  optimize 
timescales 
Criterion 3: Environmental and Social Safeguards 
Subprojects will conform with ADB’s SPS 2009 with respect to social and environment 
18. 
considerations.  Subprojects  with  significant  environmental  and/or  involuntary  resettlement 
impact (category A) will be excluded. Subprojects with activities described in ADB’s Prohibited 
Investment Activities List (Appendix 5 of ADB’s SPS 2009) will also be excluded. 
Environment 
19. 
The following subprojects are not eligible for funding under the project: 
Subprojects classified as Category A per ADB’s SPS 2009. 
(i) 
Subprojects located in or with foreseeable adverse impacts on any critical 
(ii) 
habitat or legally protected area. 
Subprojects that fall in part or in whole within an area supporting high 
biodiversity value.7 
Subprojects associated with uranium mining sites. 
(iv) 
(iii) 
Subprojects will be screened and assessed based on procedures defined in the Project’s 
20. 
environmental assessment and review framework (EARF).8 
Social Safeguards (Resettlement) 
Involuntary resettlement is considered when the affected persons have no right to refuse 
21. 
the land acquisition by the government that result in their displacement. This occurs when land is 
acquired through (i) expropriation by invoking the eminent domain power of the state or (ii) land 
is  acquired  through  negotiated  settlement  when  the  pricing  is  negotiated  in  a  process  where 
expropriation will be the consequence of a failure in the negotiation. 
22. 
Subprojects with significant impacts classified as Category A for involuntary resettlement 
per ADB’s SPS 2009 are not eligible for funding under the project.  Significant impact is defined 
as 200 or more persons being physically displaced from housing; and/or 200 or more persons 
losing 10% or more of their productive (income generating) assets. Subprojects should avoid or 
minimize  permanent  land  acquisition  and resettlement  as  assessed  at  the  time  of  subproject 
selection. In some instances, subprojects may feature loss of land (changes in land size) due to 
deep trenches, re-shaping, etc. to be assessed during subproject design and implementation. 
23. 
Subprojects will be screened and assessed based on procedures defined in the Project’s 
7  Key Biodiversity Areas as defined in the World Database of Key Biodiversity Areas.

land acquisition and resettlement review framework (LARF).9 
Criteria 4: Economic Viability and Financial Sustainability 
Subprojects  must  be  shown  to  be  economically  viable  and  financially  sustainable. 
24. 
Economic viability and/or cost effectiveness should be assessed in line with the ADB Guidelines 
for  the  Economic  Analysis  of  Projects  (2017).10    Subproject  economic  internal  rate  of  return 
should  ideally  be  above  9%,  minimum  6%.  Benefits  that  cannot  be  adequately  quantified  in 
monetary  terms  should  be  well  documented.  Financial  sustainability  of  the  subproject  O&M 
should be confirmed. 
2. 
Prior Review and Approval by ADB 
25. 
approval by ADB. 
Subprojects  to  be  undertaken  under  the  project  will  be  subject  to  prior  review  and 
Prior to conducting site specific feasibility studies, the PIU will submit for ADB review 
26. 
an  initial  assessment  of  prospective  subprojects  against  the  four  eligibility  criteria  using  best 
available information and/or informed estimates. The report will follow the general structure in 
Appendix 3 of this PAM. 
27. 
Prior to conducting detailed engineering design and preparing bidding documents, PIU 
will submit for ADB review: (i) socio-economic baseline survey of target community; (ii) technical 
feasibility  study  with  associated  studies,  cost  estimates,  and recommended  safety measures; 
(iii)  initial  environmental  examinations  (IEE)  and  environmental  management  plan  (EMP)  as 
required;  (iv)  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plan  (LARP)  and/or  due  diligence  report  as 
required;  (v)  economic  and  financial  analysis;  and  (vi)  reconfirmation  of  subproject  eligibility 
against four eligibility criteria. The report will again follow the general structure in Appendix 3 of 
this PAM. 
3. 
Procedures 
Each  selected  subproject  will  be  prepared  and  processed  in  accordance  with  the 
28. 
following procedures. 
29. 
Subproject preparation and implementation including on-site monitoring and safety 
measures will (i) seek to incorporate best practice techniques and technologies, and (ii) follow 
the approach and guidance of the technical feasibility study for the Ayu Village representative 
subproject and the draft asset management and O&M plan prepared during project processing.11 
A summary of the approach and guidelines is provided in Appendix 4 of this PAM. The PIU with 
the support of the PIC will identify relevant studies and surveys to be undertaken for the technical 
feasibility study. The following process is expected to be implemented: 
(i) 
Geophysical,  geological, 
investigations, including of the groundwater table.

30. 
Prior to the completion of each landslide risk mitigation site, the PIU with support of the 
PIC  will  prepare  an  updated  site-specific  sustainable  asset  management  and  O&M  plan  and 
budget,  to  be  adopted  and  implemented  by  MES.  The  plan  will  include,  but  not  be  limited  to: 
(i) required  near-term  monitoring,  physical remediation,  and regreening activities; (ii)  long-term 
O&M activities; (iii) acceptable timelines for subsequent third-party construction or land use within 
the  previously  at-risk  areas;  (iv)  budget  and  cost-sharing;  and  (v)  mapping  of  responsible 
agencies. 
Environmental  and  Social  Safeguards  will  be  prepared  in  line  with  requirements 
31. 
outlined in Section VII below. 
32. 
Economic  and  Financial  analysis.  The  PIU,  with  support  from  PIC,  will  conduct 
economic and financial analysis of each subproject according to ADB Guidelines for the Economic 
Analysis of Projects (2017) and ADB Preparing and Presenting Cost Estimates for Projects and 
Programs  Financed  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (2014).  Feasibility-level  economic  and 
financial analysis has already been prepared for the Ayu Village subproject, which is among the 
largest of long-listed subprojects covering two landslides.13 The analysis is expected to include 
cost-benefit analysis, analysis of alternatives, sustainability analysis, risk and sensitivity analysis, 
analysis of distribution of project costs and benefits, and identification of indicators and baselines 
for project design and monitoring framework. The analysis will confirm that adequate funds are 
available for O&M of the various facilities created with project funds. 
Socio-economic  and  Gender  Assessment  will  be  conducted  to  ensure  appropriate 
33. 
alignment  of  the  subproject  with  overall  project  objectives  and  targets,  identify  gender-
disaggregated baseline indicators, and support community consultation process. The assessment 
should include, but may not be limited to: (i) demographic profile of communities and landslide 
vulnerability  and  exposure  in  the  project  area;  (ii)  gender  differences  in  access  to  economic 
resources; (iii) mobility patterns of women and men, means of transportation used by women and 
men,  girls  and  boys;  (iv)  women’s  community  involvement  and  leadership,  including  in  local 
governance  and  disaster  risk  management,  if  any,  or  in  any  civil  society  organization;  and  (v) 
mapping  of  stakeholders,  identifying  where  women  are  and  their  extent  of  involvement  as 
12 We cannot expect that a contractor will complete the works simply by “reading” the design. This will likely require the 
presence of an international expert, depending on level of expertise of local engineers.

stakeholders. Hazard mapping should include gender as one of the factors being considered, to 
identify where women and children are at certain times of the day. 
4. 
Staffing Support 
34.  MES  shall  ensure  that  (a)  all  reports,  standards,  procedures,  guidelines  and  training 
materials developed under the project are developed in a timely manner, and by integrating local 
and international learning and good practices; (b) the personnel nominated and appointed for the 
training and capacity building activities under the project are fully qualified and have the expertise 
to provide the requisite training and capacity building; and (c) each training and capacity building 
activity under the project is adequately staffed with qualified personnel. 
35.  MES  shall  ensure  that  all  divisions,  offices  and units,  including  associated  entities  and

with personnel who have been fully trained for such operation and maintenance, in accordance 
with the requirements of the project. 
IV. 
COSTS AND FINANCING 
The  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $39.0  million.  The  government  has  requested  (i)  a 
36. 
concessional  loan  of  $11.5  million  from  ADB’s  ordinary  capital  resources;  and  (ii)  a  grant  not 
exceeding $23.5 million from ADB’s Special Funds resources (Asian Development Fund) to help 
finance the project.14 ADB will finance the expenditures in relation to: civil works, goods, consulting 
services, gross remuneration of PIU staff (inclusive of income and social tax), and land acquisition 
and  resettlement.15  The  government  contribution  is  estimated  at  $4.0  million  equivalent  for  (i) 
exemptions of  taxes and duties on civil works, goods, and services; (ii)  cash contributions for 
non-resident  income  tax  of  international  consultants;  and  (iii)  in-kind  contribution  of  houses  for

FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT 
A. 
Financial Management Assessment 
40. 
The financial management assessment (FMA) was conducted in July and August 2020 in 
accordance with ADB’s Guidelines for the Financial Management and Analysis of Projects and 
the  Financial  Due  Diligence:  A  Methodology  Note.  The  FMA  considered  the  capacity  of  MES, 
including funds-flow arrangements, staffing, accounting and financial reporting systems, financial 
information  systems,  and  internal  and  external  auditing  arrangements.  It  is  concluded that  the 
overall pre-mitigation financial management risk of executing agency is substantial. The Financial 
Management Internal Control and Risk Management Assessment is found in Table 2 of the FMA 
linked document. The borrower and executing agency have agreed to implement an action plan 
as key measures to address the deficiencies. The financial management action plan is provided 
in  Table  17.  Taking  into  considerations  the  pre-mitigation  risk  and  the  financial  management 
26 
action plan for risk mitigation, it is concluded that the capacity and suitability of MES through the 
PIU is adequate to utilize the advance fund and statement of expenditure procedures with the 
proposed  ceilings  described  below,  accompanied  by  the  use  of  direct  payment  and 
reimbursement procedures.

Disbursement 
1. 
Disbursement Arrangements for ADB Funds 
The  concessional  loan  and  ADF  grant  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with 
41. 
ADB’s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time),17  and  detailed 
arrangements agreed upon between the government and ADB. Online training for project staff on 
disbursement policies and procedures is available.18 Project staff are encouraged to avail of this 
training to help ensure efficient disbursement and fiduciary control. 
42. 
The  PIU  will  be  responsible  for  (i)  preparing  disbursement  projections;  (ii)  requesting 
budgetary  allocations  for  counterpart  funds  from  MOF;  (iii)  collecting  and  retaining  supporting 
documents; and (iv) preparing and sending withdrawal applications to ADB. 
43. 
Advance  fund  procedure.  The  PIU  will  establish  and  maintain  a  separate  advance 
account  for  each  the  ADB  loan  and  grant  funds  at  a  commercial  bank.  The  currency  of  the 
advance accounts will be US dollar. The advance accounts are to be used exclusively for ADB’s 
share  of  eligible  expenditures.  The  MES  is  accountable  and  responsible  for  proper  use  of 
advances to the advance accounts.19 
The total outstanding advance to the advance account should not exceed the estimate of 
44. 
ADB’s  share  of  expenditures  to  be  paid  through  the  advance  account  for  the  forthcoming  6 
months. The PIU may request for initial and additional advances to the advance accounts based 
on  an  Estimate  of  Expenditure  Sheet20  setting  out  the  estimated  expenditures  to  be  financed 
through the accounts for the forthcoming 6 months. Supporting documents should be submitted 
to  ADB  or  retained  by  the  borrower  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook 
(2017, as amended from time to time) when liquidating or replenishing the advance account. 
Statement  of  expenditure  procedure.21  The  SOE  procedure  may  be  used  for 
45. 
reimbursement of eligible expenditures or liquidation of advances to the advance accounts. The 
ceiling  of  the  SOE  procedure  is  the  equivalent  of  $50,000  per  individual  payment.  Supporting 
documents and records for the expenditures claimed under the SOE should be maintained and 
made  readily  available  for  review  by  ADB's  disbursement  and  review  missions,  upon  ADB's 
request for submission of supporting documents on a sampling basis, and for independent audit. 
Reimbursement  and  liquidation  of  individual  payments  in  excess  of the SOE  ceiling  should  be 
supported by full documentation when submitting the withdrawal application to ADB. 
46. 
Before  the  submission  of  the  first  withdrawal  application,  MOF  should  submit  to  ADB 
sufficient evidence of the authority of the person(s) who will sign the withdrawal applications on 
behalf of the government, together with the authenticated specimen signatures of each authorized 
person.  The minimum  value  per  withdrawal  application  is  stipulated  in the  Loan  Disbursement 
Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time). Individual payments below such amount should

be paid (i) by the executing agency and subsequently claimed to ADB through reimbursement, or 
(ii) through the advance fund procedure, unless otherwise accepted by ADB. The borrower should 
ensure sufficient category and contract balances before requesting disbursements.  The use of 
ADB’s  Client  Portal  for  Disbursements  (CPD)22  system  is  encouraged  for  submission  of 
withdrawal applications to ADB.  
2. 
Disbursement Arrangements for Counterpart Fund 
The government will provide (i) exemptions of taxes and duties on civil works, goods, and

services;  (ii)  cash  contributions  for  non-resident  income  tax  of  international  consultants;  and 
(iii) in-kind contribution of temporary houses for resettlement, collectively estimated at $4.0 million 
equivalent. PIU will open a separate bank account for use only for the government’s counterpart 
funding of eligible expenditures identified in (ii). The currency of the counterpart fund bank account 
is Som. 
48. 
The PIU will be responsible for (i) projecting taxes to be financed by the government in 
the forthcoming 12 months, and (ii) requesting on a monthly basis budgetary allocation for the 
government counterpart funds. The MES will be accountable and responsible for proper use of 
counterpart funds.  
C. 
Accounting 
49. 
The MES through the PIU will maintain, or cause to be maintained, separate books and 
records  by  funding  source  for  all  expenditures  incurred  on  the  project  following  International 
Public-Sector  Accounting  Standard  for  cash-based  accounting.  The  MES  through  the  PIU  will 
prepare  consolidated  project  financial  statements  in  accordance  with  the  government's 
accounting laws and regulations which are consistent with international accounting principles and 
practices. The PIU will purchase and install commercial accounting software for use under the 
project. 
D. 
 Auditing and Public Disclosure 
External  Audit.  The  MES  through  the  PIU  will  cause the  detailed  consolidated  project 
50. 
financial statements to be audited in accordance with International Standards on Auditing by an 
independent auditor acceptable to ADB. The MES through the PIU will submit the audited project 
financial statements together with the auditor’s opinion will be presented in the English language 
to ADB within 6 months from the end of the fiscal year.  
51. 
The audit report for the project financial statements will include a management letter and 
auditor’s opinions, which cover (i) whether the project financial statements present an accurate 
and fair view or are presented fairly, in all material respects, in accordance with the applicable 
financial reporting standards; (ii) whether the proceeds of the loan and grant were used only for 
the  purpose(s)  of  the  project;  and  (iii)  whether  the  borrower  or  executing  agency  was  in 
compliance with the financial covenants contained in the legal agreements (where applicable). 
52. 
Compliance with financial reporting and auditing requirements will be monitored by review

missions and during normal program supervision, and followed up regularly with all concerned, 
including the external auditor. 
53. 
The government and the executing agency have been made aware of ADB’s approach to 
delayed submission, and the requirements for satisfactory and acceptable quality of the audited 
project  financial  statements.23  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  require  a  change  in  the  auditor  (in  a 
manner consistent with the constitution of the borrower), or for additional support to be provided 
to the auditor, if the audits required are not conducted in a manner satisfactory to ADB, or if the 
audits are substantially delayed. ADB reserves the right to verify the project's financial accounts 
to  confirm  that  the  share  of  ADB’s  financing  is  used  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  policies  and 
procedures.  
Public disclosure of the audited project financial statements, including the auditor’s opinion 
54. 
on the project financial statements, will be guided by ADB’s Access to Information Policy.24 After 
the  review,  ADB  will  disclose  the  audited  project  financial  statements  and  the  opinion  of  the 
auditors on the project financial statements no later than 14 days of ADB’s confirmation of their 
acceptability  by  posting  them  on  ADB’s  website.  The  management  letter,  additional  auditor’s 
opinions, and audited entity financial statements will not be disclosed.

PROCUREMENT AND CONSULTING SERVICES 
A. 
Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing 
55. 
All  advance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  will  be  undertaken  in  conformity  with 
ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and Procurement Regulations for 
ADB Borrowers (2017 as amended from time to time). The issuance of invitations to bid under 
advance contracting and retroactive financing will be subject to ADB approval. The borrower and 
executing  agency  have  been  advised  that  approval  of  advance  contracting  and  retroactive 
financing does not commit ADB to finance the project. 
56. 
Advance contracting. Advance action may be undertaken on staffing of PIU, recruitment 
of project implementation consultant, and procurement of goods. All advance contracting will be 
undertaken  in  conformity  with  ADB  Procurement  Policy:  Goods,  Works,  Non-consulting  and 
Consulting  Services  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  issuance  of  invitations  to  bid 
under advance contracting will be subject to ADB approval. 
57. 
Retroactive financing. Retroactive financing will not be used under the project.  
23 ADB’s approach and procedures regarding delayed submission of audited project financial statements:  
(i) When audited project financial statements are not received by the due date, ADB will write to the executing agency 
advising that (a) the audit documents are overdue; and (b) if they are not received within the next 6 months, requests 
for  new  contract  awards  and disbursement  such  as  new  replenishment  of  advance  accounts,  processing  of  new 
reimbursement, and issuance of new commitment letters will not be processed; (ii) When audited project financial 
statements are not received within 6 months after the due date, ADB will withhold processing of requests for new 
contract  awards  and  disbursement  such  as  new  replenishment  of  advance  accounts,  processing  of  new 
reimbursement, and issuance of new commitment letters. ADB will (a) inform the executing agency of ADB’s actions; 
and (b) advise that the loan may be suspended if the audit documents are not received within the next 6 months; and 
(iii)  When  audited  project  financial  statements  are  not  received  within  12  months  after  the  due  date,  ADB  may 
suspend the loan and grant.

All procurement of goods, works, consulting services, and non-consulting services will be 
undertaken in accordance with ADB’s Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) 
and Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017 as amended from time to time).25 The 
project is expected to procure goods, works, and consulting service contract packages. 
56. 
Before  the  start  of  any  procurement,  ADB  and  the  government  will  review  the  public 
procurement  laws  of  the  central  and  state  governments  to  ensure  consistency  with  ADB’s 
Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and Procurement Regulations for ADB 
Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time).

The cost for implementing the EMP will be financed by the grant and loan. Specifically, 
the  costs  of  mitigation  measures  will  be  included  in  the  contracts,  and  the  cost  for  supporting 
environmental monitoring will be included in the consulting service of the project implementation 
consultant (PIC). The contractor is required to submit an SSEMP to PIU prior to start of works. 
The SSEMP will contain the method statement for construction, detailed mitigation and monitoring 
program, and other specific plans as required the IEE. The SSEMPs shall be endorsed by the 
PIC  before  submission  to  the  PIU  for  approval.  No  works  will  be  allowed  until  the  PIU  has 
approved the SSEMP. 
66. 
The PIU will promptly inform ADB of the occurrence of any risks or impacts, with detailed 
description  of  the  event  and  proposed  corrective  action  plan.  This  is  if  any  unanticipated 
environmental  and/or  social  risks  and  impacts  arise  during  construction,  implementation  or 
operation of the project that were not considered in the initial environmental examination. The PIU 
will report any actual or potential breach of compliance with the measures and requirements set 
forth  in  an  IEE  and/or  EMP  promptly  after  becoming  aware  of  the  breach.  The  IEE/s  will  be 
updated  to  include  corrective  actions,  associated  costs  and  schedule.  All  IEEs,  the  EARF, 
environmental monitoring reports, and corrective action plans (if any) will be disclosed on ADB 
and the project’s website. PIU shall likewise disclose the reports locally in a timely manner, an 
accessible place, and a form and language understandable to affected persons. Consultation and 
public participation will continue throughout implementation, and any environmental grievances 
will be handled in accordance with the grievance redress mechanism (GRM) developed for the 
project. 
67. 
The PIC will assist the PIU in ensuring safeguard compliance, conducting tasks related to 
preparing/finalizing/updating  IEEs,  undertaking  consultations,  disclosing  project  information  to 
35 
stakeholders,  obtaining  necessary  clearances  and  permits,  monitoring,  compiling  contractors’ 
reports, and submitting semi-annual environmental monitoring reports (SAEMR) commencing 6 
months after grant and/or loan effectiveness. The SAEMR will follow the suggested format in the 
EARF  and  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  within  one  month  after  each  reporting  period.    The  PIU 
Environment  Specialist/Coordinator  will  also  provide  updates  on  safeguards  implementation  in 
the  quarterly  progress  report  as  required  in  Section  IX.  Environmental  monitoring  results  and 
status  of  safeguards  compliance  will  be  included  in  the  project  quarterly  progress  reports  and 
SAEMR.  The  submission  of  the  monitoring  reports  is  carried  out  on  an  ongoing  basis  until 
executing agency’s project completion report is issued. This post-construction report is part of the 
monitoring report to be submitted to ADB. Environmental monitoring reports will be disclosed on 
ADB and project websites, and at project sites.

impacts.  A  LARF  has  been  prepared  to  guide  the  EAs  to  conduct  screening,  assessment, 
institutional  arrangements,  and  processes  to  be  followed  for  subsequent  subprojects  to  be 
selected during project implementation. For all civil works sites, MES through the PIU will ensure 
that all requirements prescribed in the LARF will be complied with during subproject selection and 
preparation of relevant safeguard documents and implementation. Selection criteria and screening 
checklist  in  LARF  will  be  used  by  MES  to  rule  out  subprojects  with  significant  involuntary 
resettlement impacts (Category A). Subprojects will avoid or minimize permanent land acquisition 
and resettlement as assessed at the time of subproject selection. In some instances, subprojects 
may  feature  loss  of  land  (changes  in  land  size)  due  to  deep  trenches,  re-shaping,  etc.  to  be 
assessed  during  subproject  design and  implementation.  The LARP  has been  prepared for  the 
representative subproject in Ayusai Village to ensure that resettlement activities will be carried 
out in accordance with Kyrgyz applicable laws and regulations and ADB’s SPS (2009). 
69. 
Surveys carried out during the project preparation for the representative subproject. They 
identified 25 affected households (AHs), of which 11 AHs requiring temporary resettlement and 
compensation  for  restriction  in  usage  of  affected  agricultural  land  during  construction.  The 
compensation for relocation and affected assets were calculated and budgeted as part of draft 
LARP. The draft LARP for the representative subproject will be updated upon completion of the 
detailed design. The civil works can only be commenced after full compensation payment to the 
affected households. The executing agency through PIU and the PIC will ensure that meaningful 
consultations are carried out with the project affected persons throughout the project cycle with 
attention to the needs of the vulnerable and the disadvantaged groups. 
70. 
For implementing the LARPs, the PIU will ensure that:  
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
(v) 
The safeguards specialist recruited as part of the PIU and PIC team will conduct 
LARP implementation and monitoring, including facilitation of resolution of affected 
households’ concerns and grievances; 
Continuous meaningful consultations with affected households, and no change is 
made on the entitlement matrix of the draft LARP and LARF that provides a clear 
guidance on entitlements for compensation; 
The final LARP is submitted to ADB for concurrence prior to implementation, as 
early as detailed design is available; 
The final LARP is disclosed through the project’s and ADB’s website;  
LARP implementation compliance report is submitted to ADB’s no objection prior 
the start of civil works; and 
36 
(vi) 
Reports  on  monitoring  of  the  social  safeguards  and  LARP  implementation 
including grievances is submitted to ADB on a semi-annual basis. 
71. 
In case any changes, additional land acquisition and involuntary resettlement, or related 
unanticipated impacts will be subsequently identified, then addendum LARP (or Corrective Action 
Plan/CAP) will be prepared and implemented in accordance with approved LARF. The PIC will 
assist  PIU  in  compiling  and  submitting  semi-annual  social  monitoring  reports  (SSMR) 
commencing  6  months  after  grant  and/or  loan  effectiveness.  SSMR  will  be  submitted  to  ADB 
within one month after each reporting period.  The PIU Social Safeguards/resettlement Specialist 
will  also  provide  updates  on  safeguards  implementation  in  the  quarterly  progress  report.  The 
submission of the monitoring reports is carried out on an ongoing basis until executing agency’s 
project completion report is issued. SSMRs will be disclosed on ADB and project websites, and 
at project sites. 
72. 
Land acquisition and resettlement costs will be covered under the ADB financing and in-
kind contribution from the government. An initial budget estimate of $2.0 million has been set for 
all  subprojects  (see  Table  11).  ADB  funds  may  be  used  to  (i)  provide  payments  to  affected 
persons in line with the associated approved updated LARP and (ii) cover incremental expenses 
directly associated with implementation of the  LARP and GRM (including by affected persons) 
excluding  those  already  covered  under  the  TOR  of  the  PIC.  Land  acquisition  costs  are  not 
anticipated to be financed by ADB, but as needed, specific due diligence will be conducted as per 
para.  6  of  the  ADB  Operations  Manual  H3.27  Payments  will  be  disbursed  from  the  advance 
account and liquidated through the SOE procedure with submission of (i) signed contract between 
PIU and affected persons based on results of the valuation survey; (ii) confirmation from bank 
that payment is transferred to affected persons’ account; and (iii) written acknowledgment from 
affected persons of receipt of payment. ADB will also finance other resettlement costs as required 
including:  (i)  compensation  to  affected  persons  for  income,  social,  and  relevant  land  taxes 
associated with resettlement payments received under the project as applicable; (ii) the purchase 
or  renovation  of  temporary  housing  units;  and  (iii)  civil  works  and  goods  for  site  preparation, 
transport, installation, and connection to utilities (including furnaces) of temporary housing. The 
government will provide in-kind contribution of temporary houses, initially estimated at 50 units. 
Temporary  houses  required  in  excess  of  the  government’s  contribution  may  be  purchased  or 
renovated using ADB finance. 
The PIU will establish a GRM in accordance with the EARF, relevant IEE/EMP, LARF and 
73. 
LARP to receive and facilitate the resolution of the affected persons’ concerns and grievances.

VIII.  GENDER AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS 
76. 
The  project  is  categorized  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming  (EGM).  It  will  address 
gender  issues    such  as  women’s  limited  representation  and  participation  in  disaster  risk 
27 https://www.adb.org/documents/operations-manual 
37 
management because of conservative norms,  limited availability of sex-disaggregated data on 
disasters and their impact on women and men, gender-specific exposure and vulnerabilities to 
landslides  and  other  natural  hazards,  weak  gender  integration  in  disaster  risk  management 
policies  and  programs,  and  low  capacity  of  MES  staff  and  stakeholders  to  implement  gender-
sensitive standard procedures, landslide risk assessment, planning, mitigation, and resettlement. 
The project will protect approximately 4,700 people or about 950 households from landslides, with 
approximately 11% of these being households headed by women. MES will develop and adopt a 
landslide risk management roadmap that will include (i) activities and targets to improve women’s 
representation  in  landslide  risk  management  decision-making  structures  and  mechanisms,  as 
well as promote the role of women as technical specialists, and (ii) capacity building on gender-
sensitive  landslide  risks  and  vulnerability  assessment  and  planning.  Sustainable  asset 
management  and  O&M  plans  will  be  developed  and  implemented  identifying  roles  and 
responsibilities of community representatives, at least a third of whom are women. The project 
will conduct gender-informed vulnerability mapping, collect sex-disaggregated data, and develop 
a web-based landslide risk database and maps. The project will also capacitate communities on 
gender-sensitive standard procedures and landslide risk mitigation.  Women in the communities 
will participate in training on landslide risk mitigation, community risk assessment and planning, 
and on-site landslide monitoring. 
77. 
The executing agency through the PIU will ensure that the project’s gender targets are 
met during implementation, with resources allocated in the project implementation consultant for 
gender activity monitoring. The PIU Director is responsible for achievement of GAP targets and 
is supported by safeguards specialist in the PIU and gender and social development specialist in 
PIC.

Monitoring  
78. 
Project  performance  monitoring.  The  executing  agency  will  ensure  that  PIU,  with 
support of the project implementation consultant, undertake monitoring project performance using 
the targets, indicators, milestones/activities, assumptions, and risks in the DMF and GAP, and 
establish  an  adequate  project  performance  monitoring  system  within  3  months  of  project 
effectiveness.  The  project  performance  monitoring  system  will  assess  the  following  outputs  and 
indicators (i) progress of planned activities according to the milestones, (ii) progress in achieving each 
project output and project outcome according to the performance targets and indicators indicated in 
the DMF and GAP, (iii) safeguards compliance, and (iv) social and economic benefits with focus on 
the  poor  and  women.  Gender-disaggregated  baseline  data  for  output  and  outcome  indicators 
gathered during project processing will be updated and reported quarterly through the executing 
agency's quarterly progress reports and after each ADB review mission. These quarterly reports 
will  provide  information necessary to  update  ADB's project  performance reporting  system. The 
project  performance  monitoring  will  involve  a  participatory  approach,  including  inputs  from  local 
government  and  stakeholders  facilitated  by  the  project  implementation  consultant  and  community 
development teams to ensure timely collection of quality data.

Compliance monitoring. All project assurances including policy, legal, financial, economic, 
physical, environmental, gender, and other safeguard measures will be monitored through quarterly 
progress  reports,  and  twice  a  year,  during  ADB  loan  review  missions.  ADB  will  also  monitor  the 
progress of achievement of each output and outcome based on performance indicators with targets, 
and  each  activity  based  on  milestones  indicated  in  the  DMF  through  a  project  management 
information system (i.e., e-Ops).

ANTICORRUPTION POLICY 
88. 
ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any violations of the 
46 
Anticorruption  Policy  relating  to  the  project.29  All  contracts  financed  by  ADB  shall  include 
provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the 
executing agency and all project contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers. 
Individuals and/or entities on ADB’s anticorruption debarment list are ineligible to participate in 
ADB-financed  activity  and  may  not  be  awarded  any  contracts  under  the  project.30  To  support 
these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  are  included  in  the  loan  and  grant  agreements  and  shall  be

XI. 
ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISM 
89. 
People  who  are,  or may  in the  future  be,  adversely  affected  by the  project  may  submit 
complaints  to  ADB’s  Accountability  Mechanism.  The  Accountability  Mechanism  provides  an 
independent forum and process whereby people adversely affected by ADB-assisted projects can 
voice,  and  seek  a  resolution  of  their  problems,  as  well  as  report  alleged  violations  of  ADB’s 
operational  policies  and  procedures.  Before  submitting  a  complaint  to  the  Accountability 
Mechanism, affected people should make an effort in good faith to solve their problems by working 
with  the  concerned  ADB  operations  department.    Only  after  doing  that,  and  if  they  are  still 
dissatisfied, should they approach the Accountability Mechanism.31

APPENDIX 1: DRAFT TERMS OF REFERENCE OF PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION 
CONSULTANTS 
I. 
INTRODUCTION 
1. 
These terms of reference (TOR) provide specific details of the project which are relevant 
to the assignment, implementation arrangements, and objectives of the consultancy. The TOR 
also  provide  specific  details  on  the  scope  of  the  consultancy  and  the  composition,  roles,  and 
responsibilities of the consulting team. 
A. 
BACKGROUND 
The Kyrgyz Republic is in a seismically active area with highly variable weather patterns 
2. 
and  is  at  a  high  risk  of  the  impacts  of  geophysical  disasters  and  climate  change.  Disasters 
triggered by natural hazards such as landslides and earthquakes are frequent and estimated to 
cost the country approximately 1%–1.5% of the gross domestic product annually.32 Landslides 
triggered by snowmelt, precipitation, and seismic activity are a frequent occurrence particularly in 
the Fergana Valley in the south west of the country. They cause injury and loss of life, destroy 
productive land, damage infrastructure and settlements, and disrupt basic services, transport, and 
logistics. 
3. 
The proposed project will reduce the risks of landslide events in the Kyrgyz Republic. The 
project  will  take  a  comprehensive  approach  combining  structural  (including  civil  works  and 
equipment)  and  non-structural  (including  monitoring,  technology,  training,  and  strategy) 
interventions. The project will integrate the use of advanced ground-based and remote-sensing 
technologies and techniques for risk identification, monitoring, and early warning of landslides. 
The project will create opportunities for community participation (particularly of women)  for the 
planning and maintenance of landslide risk reduction measures. 
4. 
The project executing agency (EA) is the Ministry of Emergency Situations (MES). A single 
project  implementation  unit  (PIU)  will  be  established  within  MES,  delegated  to  implement  the 
entire project on behalf of MES. 
B. 
OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE OF THE PROJECT 
5. 
The project will reduce the vulnerability and exposure of communities and infrastructure 
to  landslide  events  by:  (i)  reducing  direct  landslide  risks;  (ii)  improving  landslide  monitoring 
systems; and (iii) strengthening capacity for landslide risk management. The impacts the project 
is  aligned  with  is  (i)  reduced  human  and  material  loss  from  climate-  and  geophysical-related 
disasters; and (ii) increased level of protection of the population and territories from emergency 
situations to create conditions for the sustainable development of the country.33  
Further details of project scope and implementation procedures are provided in the project

SCOPE OF SERVICES 
7. 
The  project  implementation  consultant  (PIC)  will  support  MES  and  the  PIU  to  manage 
project  implementation.  The  scope  of  services  and  detailed  tasks  of  the  PIC  are  given  in  the 
following paragraphs. 
8. 
The PIC will support the PIU in the efficient and timely implementation of the key project 
components for landslide risk mitigation civil works; development, installation, and integration of 
on-site  monitoring  and  a  pilot  national-level  interferometric  synthetic  aperture  radar  (InSAR) 
landslide  monitoring  system  with  associated  capacity  building;  and  review,  development,  and 
mobilization  of  roadmap,  procedures,  and  training  program  on  landslide  risk  management  for 
stakeholders  agencies,  organizations  and  communities  in  line  with  the  project  design  and 
monitoring  framework  (DMF)  and  gender  action  plan  (GAP).  The  services  will  cover:  overall 
project management, oversight, and coordination; preparation of feasibility study, due diligence, 
and design for civil works subprojects; financial management and procurement support; project 
monitoring  and  evaluation  (including  safeguards  compliance);  construction  supervision;  and 
capacity building. For indicative purposes only, this package of consulting services is estimated 
at 50 person-months of international consultants and 193 person-months of national consultants. 
III. 
KEY EXPERTISE REQUIRED 
9. 
The  consultant  team  will  be  led  by  an  international  firm  with  preferably  15 years’ 
experience  in  designing  and  preparing  similar  externally  financed  projects  in  disaster  risk 
management  and  related  sectors,  preferably  with  ADB  and  in  the  Central  Asia  region.  It  is 
expected that the lead firm would partner with a local firm or entity with long-standing experience 
in landslide risk assessment and management. 
10. 
The  TORs  are  prepared  on  a  performance  (output)  basis  and  detailed  tasks  and 
deliverables  for  the  assignment  are  presented  below.  Firms  will  in  their  proposal  identify  their 
approach, methodology, and the number and the nature of experts they will require to achieve 
them. However, MES requires a minimum number of key experts, including a Team Leader, as 
tabulated in Table 1 below. The responsibilities and qualification requirements of the key experts 
are presented below in Section V. A time-based contract will be awarded to the winning firm with 
provisional sums for (i) workshops and training; and (ii) studies, surveys, and design. 
11. 
In addition to the required key experts, the proposing entities should also include in their 
technical proposal, in the personnel work plan, and in their financial proposal all other “non-key 
experts” required in accordance with their proposed approach and methodology. The proposing 
entity must also determine and indicate the number of person-months for which each key or non-
key  expert  will  be  required.  The  non-key  experts  might  include:  remote  sensing  and  GIS 
specialists,  land  reclamation  specialist,  financial  management  specialist  and  procurement 
specialist. Administrative and support roles (e.g., firm’s own financial and contract management) 
should not be included as non-key experts. Such costs should instead be factored into the overall 
bid price.

The PIC will administer the civil works and equipment installation contracts and ensure 
that the project is constructed in accordance with the provision and intention of these contracts 
and the site is handed back to local communities in safe and sustainable condition. Subject to the 
value and complexity, works may be executed under the International Federation of Consulting 
Engineers  (FIDIC)  Conditions  of  Contract  for  Works  of  Civil  Engineering  Construction. 
Accordingly, MES will be the Employer and the PIC will function as the Engineer. The PIC will 
nominate  supervision  representative(s)  for  each  construction  site.34  nominate  supervision 
34 If the primary representative is a local engineer, it is anticipated they would be closely assisted by the 
international expert(s). An international expert would be expected to visit each site monthly, possibly more 
frequently depending on construction progress or issues with site. This task will be strongly influenced by 
the “capacity” of the contractor to conduct the works with an acceptable degree of “autonomy”.

APPENDIX 2: SUMMARY DESCRIPTION OF LANDSLIDE MONITORING AND 
LANDSLIDE RISK DATABASE 
1. 
The project will establish an integrated multi-level landslide monitoring system, comprised 
of on-site, Oblast and national-level landslide monitoring components. The monitoring system will 
be  integrated  with  the  already  established  national  early  warning  system  ‘OKSION’  and  the 
network  of  crisis  management  centers  and  the  national  call  center.  Government  standards  or 
procedures,  guidelines  and  associated  training  materials  on  landslide  monitoring  will  also  be 
developed to ensure institutionalization. 
On-site monitoring 
An on-site landslide monitoring system will be installed in approximately 20 subprojects 
2. 
not covered under output 1. Components of the monitoring systems are expected to consist of: 
i.  Devices and sensors to measure the landslide slope stability, including ground-based and 
ii. 
underground extensometers, TDRs, inclinometers/tiltmeter and geotesters; 
Instruments  to  monitor  changes  in  groundwater  levels  such  as  piezometers  and 
groundwater level sensors; 
iii.  Instruments  to  monitor  landslide  triggering  variables  such  as  precipitation  and  seismic 
activity, for example rain gauges, automated weather stations or seismic intensity meters; 
iv.  Data  registration  and  transmission  systems,  such  as  supervisory  control  and  data 
acquisition  (SCADA),  GPS  receivers,  data  recorders/data  loggers,  radio  transmitters, 
antennas and repeaters. 
3. 
A list of tentative sites and list of instruments are provided below respectively. Geophysical 
surveying will be carried out to select the appropriateness of each site and customize the system 
for each site. All sites must undergo due diligence to confirm compliance with eligibility criteria 
detailed in Section III (D) prior to implementation. 
4. 
A sample site-level landslide monitoring system is shown in the Figure A below. 
62 
Appendix 2 
Figure A: Proposed on-site monitoring system 
National-level monitoring and risk assessment 
5. 
The  project  will  build  national  capacity  on  the  application  of  multi-image  (InSAR)  for 
national-level monitoring of surface displacements and analysis of historical slope instability, as 
a compliment to on-site monitoring and more conventional site-based studies. InSAR data and 
analysis  will  also  be  used  for  updating  the  Ministry  of  Emergency  Situations  (MES)  landslide 
inventory and a series of multi-scale landslide risk assessments (Figure B).   
Figure B: Application of InSAR for landslide risk assessment and monitoring 
Appendix 2 
63 
6. 
The application of InSAR for landslide monitoring requires the following ICT equipment: 
i.  A dedicated geospatial database linked to an online GIS-based portal to deliver, visualize 
and manage InSAR results; 
ii.  SAR processor and interferometry software packages; 
iii.  Computer workstations; and 
iv.  Computer server with sufficient storage capacity 
Integrated landslide monitoring and risk assessment 
7. 
The project will establish a system at site, regional and national level, and manage the 
network of on-site monitoring systems, data transfer and storage systems, improved databases, 
software systems and the online portal, and the integration of landslide early warnings with the 
existing OKSION system. MES will closely collaborate with local and government stakeholders 
on  the  data  processing  and  analysis,  including  InSAR  processing,  landslide  slope  stability 
analyses  and  landslide  risk  assessment  studies.  The  integrated  landslide  monitoring  and  risk 
assessment system to be implemented by the investment project is envisaged as shown in Figure

Landslide Risk Database (Output 3) 
11. 
Extensive  work  on  mapping  and  assessing  landslide  hazard  and  risk  in  the  Kyrgyz 
Republic  has  been  done  through  collaboration  between  national  and  international  academic 
institutions,  with  the  most  notable  work  undertaken  by  research  institutes  such  as  the  Kyrgz 
Integrated Hydrogeological Expedition, the Institute of Seismology (under National Academy of 
Science),  SEC  GEOPRIBOR,  Central-Asian  Institute  for  Applied  Geosciences  (CAIAG),  GFZ 
Potsdam and the University of Liège (Belgium). In addition to national- and regional-scale hazard 
and risk assessments, detailed site-specific studies have also been undertaken. 
12. 
Building on the work carried out by the Agency of Geology during the Soviet times, MES 
maintains an annually updated register of natural hazards throughout the country, which includes 
a landslide  inventory.  The  inventory  includes  survey results,  geological, geomorphological  and 
topographical  maps  and  site-specific  recommendations  for  risk  reduction  and  monitoring.  The 
extensive database is only available in Russian.  
In  addition  to  this  database,  since  2011,  the  World  Bank  Global  Facility  for  Disaster 
13. 
Reduction  and  Recovery,  through  its  Open  Data  for  Resilience  Initiative,  has  supported  the 
establishment  and  operation  of  an  open-source  national  disaster  risk  data  sharing  platform: 
http://geonode.mes.kg/. This platform is the main MES platform for storage, retrieval, distribution 
and  display  of  geospatial  hazard  data  and  maps.  Currently,  the  database  has  over  157  data 
layers, mostly on geo-hazards (e.g. landslide, mudflow, flood, seismic hazard assessment), and 
spatial  administrative,  social,  economic,  environmental  and  demographic  information  (e.g. 
settlements, population, roads). This platform is mainly storing data, rather than integrating the 
data through interactive functionalities. 
14. 
Nonetheless, there are several challenges when it comes to hazard and risk assessment 
in the Kyrgyz Republic. There is limited standardization and consolidation of the risk assessment 
methodologies,  data,  maps  and  results,  with  limited  application  by  government  for  strategy, 
investment and planning. There is a strong focus on assessing and quantifying landslide risk from 
a geophysical point of view, with limited assessment of exposure, vulnerability, capacity and the 
integration  of  hazard  information  with  gender-disaggregated  socio-economic  data  and  data  on 
critical infrastructure. There is a clear need to systematize landslide risk assessment processes 
and outputs and build the respective government capacity. 
15. 
Output 3 will include the establishment of one improved online GIS platform and database, 
integrating information on landslide hazard, exposure and vulnerability, results from updated risk 
assessments, risk maps and real-time landslide monitoring data. The platform will expand and 
improve the existing MES open-source national disaster risk data sharing platform, as supported 
under the World Bank Open Data for Resilience Initiative. Using the database and platform, the 
investment  project  will  conduct  a  number  of  national-,  oblast-  and  site-specific  landslide  risk 
assessments (integrating climate change, mudflows and seismic risk), prioritizing assessments 
at national level, for Osh and Jalal-Abad Oblasts and from the long list of landslide sites to be 
covered under output 1. The assessment results, including risk maps, will be integrated into the 
GIS platform. In addition, the investment project will develop national standards or guidelines and 
training materials on multi-hazard and multi-scale risk assessments.

APPENDIX 4: APPROACH AND GUIDELINES FOR TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY STUDY 
Overview 
Output  1  will  reduce  the  landslide  risks  of  infrastructure  through  the  implementation  of 
1. 
landslide risk mitigation engineering measures such as unloading, reshaping of bulging areas and 
opening cracks and drainage of underground and surface water. Nature-based solutions such as 
introducing  vegetation,  soil  bioengineering  and  agroforestry  for  slope  stabilization,  reduced 
filtration and regreening – for the stabilized slope as well as the soil disposal site - will be applied 
where  appropriate  and  based  on  extensive  technical  investigations.  These  risk  mitigation 
measures are site specific and therefore require in-depth investigation, design, and monitoring. 
Involvement of the State Agency on Environmental Protection and Forestry is recommended for 
the revegetation/regreening aspects of the civil works. 
2. 
Through a combination of quantitative and qualitative assessment and prioritization, the 
MES has assembled a list of 46 landslide prone sites in Jalal-Abad and Osh Oblasts to be targeted 
as potential sites for the implementation of slope stabilization measures. Each of these sites has 
a datasheet containing information on geography, geology, landslide volume and area, landslide 
history  and  stages  of  landslide  development,  landslide  susceptibility  and  exposed  assets. 
Preliminary runout analysis is also available for each of the sites.37 
3. 
The following process is expected to be implemented for each site or group of sites: 
(i)  Geophysical,  geological,  topographical,  and  geotechnical  surveys  and  investigations, 
including of the groundwater table. 
(ii) 
Laboratory  testing  of  soil  and  rock  samples,  with  international  lab  testing  for 
complex sites where required. 
Installation  of  monitoring  systems  (e.g.  piezometers)  for  monitoring  of  landslide 
site before, during, and/or after the works. 
Preliminary/concept  design  and  detailed  technical  design  considering  future 
climate risks. 
Environment and social safeguards due diligence. 
Preliminary preparatory works. 
Slope stabilization works with good and continuous site supervision by qualified 
experts.38 
(iii) 
(iv) 
(v) 
(vi) 
(vii) 
(viii)  Preparation and construction of soil disposal site, in the case of unloading. 
(ix) 
(x) 
Regreening/revegetation of works site. 
Monitoring and maintenance. 
4. 
Output 1 will be implemented in a cascading approach, starting with the implementation 
of  the  works  in the  selected  representative  subproject  and  gradually  increasing  the  number  of 
sites.  Landslide  sites  can  be  combined  based  on  geographical  proximity,  similar 
geomorphological conditions or priority based on stage of landslide development. This gradual 
implementation process will ensure learning, capacity building and adaptive management.  
5. 
Prior to the completion of each landslide risk mitigation site, the PIU with support of the 
PIC  will  prepare  an  updated  site-specific  sustainable  asset  management  and  O&M  plan  and 
37 Landslide  Risk  Assessment  Report  is  available  online  as  a  supplementary  document  to  the  report  and 
recommendation of the President: https://www.adb.org/projects/53022-001/main#project-documents 
38 We cannot expect that a contractor will complete the works simply by “reading” the design. This will likely require the 
presence of an international expert, depending on level of expertise of local engineers.

budget, to be adopted and implemented by MES. The plan will include, but not be limited to: (i) 
required near-term monitoring, physical remediation, and regreening activities; (ii) long-term O&M 
activities; (iii) acceptable timelines for subsequent third-party construction or land use within the 
previously at-risk areas; (iv) budget and cost-sharing; and (v) mapping of responsible agencies. 
Approach for Ayusai Representative Subproject 
Concepts and Principles 
A number of fundamental concepts and principles are taken as the basis for selecting and 
6. 
specifying the slope stabilization works: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
(v) 
(vi) 
(vii) 
The slope geology is such that relevant movements are taking place, particularly 
after  heavy  rains,  snowmelting  season,  and  major  earthquakes  or  even  a 
prolonged sequence of smaller tremors. 
Like in any other case where relevant movements are expected, the use of rigid 
structures  (like  reinforced  concrete  walls  for  example)  should  be  avoided  in 
principle (oftentimes they are also not environmentally friendly). 
Flexible structures capable of withstanding relevant movements (even up to 20 cm 
to 40 cm) should be adopted: this will guarantee a longer durability and efficiency 
of the measures undertaken. 
The  same  concepts  will  apply  to  the  drainage  system,  particularly  for  any 
underground work aimed at keeping the slope dry. 
Unfortunately, there  is  no  way  to  avoid water  infiltration  and seepage  within the 
landslide mass: a surface water intercepting network of ditches on its own would 
have  a  limited  effect  on  the  final  mass  stability:  this  is  confirmed  by  the  lack  of 
natural runoff erosion channel on the slope. 
Underground drainage with trenches is instead necessary and will be part of the 
mitigation project. 
Flexible  works  are,  generally,  easier  to  build  and  do  not  require  sophisticated 
technologies or equipment: they can often be executed with standard equipment 
which  can  be  used  by  local  people,  helping  in  this  way  the  local  economies  by 
hiring local labor. 
(viii)  Nature  based  measures  can  be  used  in  these  difficult  geological  conditions  for 
limited small stabilization works but likely not for the full complete stabilization of 
the landslide. 
In  a  case  like  this  one,  it  is  worth  mentioning  the  fact  that  relocation  would  a 
feasible  alternative  to  protect  the  people  who  are  living  at  the  slope  toe  in  the 
landslide potential runout area. 
(ix) 
Nature Based Solutions 
7. 
Nature  based  solutions  are  becoming  more  and  more  popular  for  landslide  slope 
stabilization and in some Western countries they have, under certain geological and geometrical 
conditions, fully obliterated other more traditional solutions. Nature based solutions present the 
following advantages: 
(i) 
(ii) 
They are environmentally friendly. 
They are built with natural “materials”, like wood, stones, boulders, live vegetation, 
etc., which “partially regenerate” themselves without creating further pollution. 
70 
Appendix 4 
(iii) 
(iv) 
(v) 
By avoiding the use of steel and concrete a relevant positive environmental impact 
is  created:  steel  and  concrete  production  is  generating  a  huge  quantity  of  CO2 
emissions in the atmosphere. They also generally come from very far away with 
expensive and polluting transportation. 
Nature  based  solutions  are  coming  from  the  traditional  works  of  country  areas: 
they can generally be built by local people, creating a significant boost in the local 
economies of remote villages. 
Under certain conditions they have been used to stabilize very big landslides in 
environmentally sensitive areas. 
Further Study for Detailed Design 
The  further  stages  towards  a  completed  detailed  design  will  require the  execution  of  a 
8. 
number of studies to improve the degree of knowledge of the slope: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
Further specifically dedicated geophysical investigations aimed at the detection of 
ground water levels and wet areas within the slope. 
A proper geological study to identify all the geomorphological features on the slope 
aimed at detailing the design and the mitigative works on the slope itself. Given 
the agricultural conditions in the area, with very tall grass, the geomorphological 
study  should  be  executed  in  very  early  spring  or  very  late  summer  when  the 
vegetation will be in a resting period. 
Trial pits with excavators, to a depth of 4 m to 5 m, are always a very good way of 
investigating wide areas with difficult or limited access. They are quick and cheap 
but,  on  the  other  side,  can  only  allow  for  visual  inspection  (even  if  disturbed 
samples can be collected for speditive laboratory testing) and can reach a limited 
depth.  They  are  in  any  case  always  recommended  thanks  to  their  speed  of 
execution  and  the  trial  pit  investigation  campaign  can  be  conducted  by  the 
Contractor itself during the very first stages of the work under the guidance of the 
Engineer. 
A detailed slope survey walk to help identify areas of potential water accumulation. 
It is recommended to detect areas with changes in vegetation since ground water 
accumulation is often recognizable by these sorts of signs. 
Design Concepts 
Given  the  particular  characteristics  of  the  slopes,  the  design  approach  will  have  to  be 
9. 
based on the following general principles: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
Avoid  rigid  structures  which  are  attracting  heavier  than  normal  stress  states  in 
highly deformable soils. 
Collect  and  intercept  as  much  water  as  possible  on  the  slope,  particularly  at 
underground level at the base contact between the loess and the rock below. The 
slope does not have erosion gullies on surface, so it is understood that most of the 
water quickly infiltrates underground. 
Reprofile the original slope profile by unloading the material in those areas where 
the  geomorphology\geometry  is  unfavorable,  the  gradients  are  too  steep  or  the 
maximum drainage trench depths are too big to be reached by normal excavators 
from the original ground surface.  
The 3-4 critical spots in terms of surface water (springs) must be treated separately 
and independently by collecting and draining their flows. 
Appendix 4 
71 
(v) 
(vi) 
Considering the climatic conditions in the area and the fact that the project does 
not include any hydrological calculations (only for the soil disposal sites in the river 
bed with their hydraulic protections) the expected climate changes previously are 
not directly affecting the design process for the mitigation works of this landslide. 
The area must be returned to the local people in the same conditions as it was 
before  the  works:  environmental  rehabilitation  will  be  a  design  “must”,  with  the 
proposed replanting of the same grass species and\or crops that we can find today 
in the area. 
Preliminary Preparatory Works 
10. 
The preliminary preparatory works will consist of the following activities: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
(v) 
Construction of an office area near the slopes. The number of workers involved in 
the project will probably not be significantly high (depending on the schedule, but 
expected to be not higher than around 20 units) so that there is not a strict need 
for  a  dedicated  accommodation  area  for  them.  It  would  be,  if  conditions  allow, 
preferable to host the workers in local guesthouses or similar (if any), to allow the 
local economy some source of extra income thanks to the construction operations. 
The office area will have a clean draining surface (compacted 30cm layer of sand 
and gravel) to avoid muddy conditions during rain and will be big enough for office 
facilities,  equipment  parking  at  night  or  during  holidays  and  supplied  material 
storage. 
Preparation of the temporary access roads. As shown in the Technical Feasibility 
Study Report, existing roads will be mostly used for this scope, but they will still 
need some preliminary stabilizing works considering the very heavy traffic involved 
by the unloading operations (tens of 30-40 t trucks every day). 
If  existing  roads  are  used,  they  will  have  to  be  adequately  prepared  and 
strengthened with the formation of a 30 cm thick layer of well compacted gravel 
and material to sustain the heavy trucks. 
Dedicated  water  drainage  works  will  be  built  to  avoid  damages  from  the  runoff 
water, which is naturally collected and concentrated by a road on a slope. This will 
be achieved by constructing water ditches on the upward site of the road with water 
transversal cutoff at regular spacings, depending on the steepness and length of 
the road between curves (approximately 30-50m). 
Stabilization Works 
The landslide(s) will be mitigated with the following works (the Technical Feasibility Study 
11. 
Report shows a series of graphs and sketches which illustrate them): 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
Unloading of the areas where the loess layer is thicker, by excavating the material 
in excess and transferring it to soil disposal site area(s). 
Reshaping  of  other  areas  where  the  local  morphology  and  the  geometrical  and 
geological conditions (bulging, opening cracks, etc.) are suggesting that a potential 
future issue could arise. 
Drainage of the underground water and lowering of the ground water pressure by 
excavating  trenches  which  will  have  to  reach,  as  much  as  possible,  the  base 
contact between the unstable loess and the rock underneath. A minimum of 3-4 
lines of drainage, parallel to the contour lines, will be realized on the slope in places 
where the loess is thinner, to minimize the excavated volume. All the drainages 
72 
Appendix 4 
will be collected to a network of underground pipes which will bring the water to 
the Ayusai stream in the valley bottom (in addition some of the drained water could 
be collected in small tanks on the slope and used for irrigation at higher elevation). 
Spring  catchment  and  collection  in  those  limited  areas  where  there  are  water 
springs or simply where the ground appears to be wet. 
Revegetation  of  the  entire  excavated  area  by  sowing  (or,  better,  hydroseeding) 
local grasses\crops to restore the original landscape aspect and allow cultivation, 
grazing  and  hay\wheat  growth  for  the  local  people.  Some  trees  could  well  be 
planted on the slope to add some added value in terms of visual landscaping, but 
it is reminded that too many grown trees represent a negative driving force for a 
slope  like this  one (and at  the  same time their  roots  are not  deep  enough  for  a 
complete  and  full  stabilization  contribution)  because  of  their  weight.  We 
recommend, if trees are planted, to avoid concentrations and rather adopt a more 
widespread spacing geometry. 
Preparation of the soil disposal site areas. 
(iv) 
(v) 
(vi) 
12.  We  note  that  other  flexible  methods  for  landslide  stabilization  –  namely  gabions  and 
reinforced  earth  with  geogrids  and  geotextiles  -  could  be  used  in  these  slope  conditions, 
depending on their availability in the country. Reinforced earth embankments could be particularly 
useful  because  they  could  be  built  by  using  some  of  the  excavated  material,  then  limiting  the 
amount to be stockpiled in the dumpsite area. They are very environmentally friendly, since they 
can be fully regreened with a minimum visual impact on the area. However, it must be noted that 
geogrids and geotextile materials are highly sophisticated products (often also expensive) which 
should probably come from far away (we are not aware of any national Kyrgyz manufacturer of 
these  products)  and,  as  such,  would  probably  be  much  costlier  than  the  unloading  process 
suggested in this document. Given the dimension of the two landslides to treat in this project, the 
overall quantity of reinforced earth would be very relevant. These are options to be considered 
for other sites in the investment project.
