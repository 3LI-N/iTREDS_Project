PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
1. 
Qinghai Province, situated mostly on the Qinghai–Tibetan plateau in northwestern PRC, 
has long been home to a number of ethnic groups due to its location along the old Silk Road.1 
Ethnically diverse and featuring a beautiful and rugged landscape with mountains and pastures, 
Qinghai  is  the  source  of  the  Mekong,  Yangtze,  and  Yellow  rivers,  making  it  a  socially  and 
environmentally significant province for the PRC.2 Given the fragile terrain, Qinghai is promoting 
urbanization  within  a  northeastern  corridor  linking  its  capital,  Xining,  to  Lanzhou,  in  Gansu 
Province. While protecting its natural resources, Qinghai also aims to protect urban areas from 
natural hazards such as flash flooding, which has increased in cities across the PRC as a result 
of  impermeable  paved  surfaces,  deforestation,  poor  waterway  management,  and  an  overall 
decrease in natural water collection areas. 
2. 
Haidong,  the  second-largest  city  in  Qinghai,  is  located  within  this  corridor,  immediately 
east of Xining. A city of 1.7 million residents (30.0% of Qinghai’s total population of 5.7 million), 
Haidong  upgraded  to  a  prefecture-level  city  in  2013,  denoting  its  importance  in  regional 
development.  Haidong  has  two  districts—Ping’an  and  Ledu—and  four  counties.3 Both  districts 
straddle  the  Huangshui  River,  an  important  tributary  of  the  Yellow  River.  Strengthening  the 
ecological function of the Huangshui River to protect these critical watersheds is an urgent priority. 
This involves managing flood risks, reducing soil erosion, improving water quality and availability, 
increasing climate change resilience, and limiting urban expansion.  
3. 
According to the Haidong master plan, the two districts are expected to add more than 
half a million residents by 2030.4 This will put pressure on an already fragile landscape; Haidong’s 
location  in the river  valley,  surrounded  by  steep and barren mountains, makes  it  vulnerable to 
flash  flooding.  According  to  Haidong’s  historical  records,  flood  events  of  different  levels  have 
occurred  every  year  since  1949,  with  large-scale  floods  every  6–7  years.  While  some  flood 
infrastructure is in place, it is poorly maintained and unevenly distributed across urban and rural 
areas. Mountainside soil erosion exacerbates flooding risks, increasing the sediment loads and 
threatening agricultural land downstream.  
4. 
As  Haidong  continues  to  grow,  public  services  in  urban  and  rural  areas  remain 
inadequate;  without  upgrades,  they  will  further  fail  to  meet  local  water  supply  and  solid  waste 
disposal  needs.  The  steep  terrain  surrounding  Haidong  has  led  to  the  development  of  small 
villages in the mountains, including minority villages, which will suffer socially and economically if 
public service investments remain unbalanced between rural and urban areas. 
5. 
Strategic fit.  The  proposed  project  is  closely  aligned  with  both the  PRC  government’s 
priorities and the  country  strategy  and  operations  of the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB). The 
PRC’s Thirteenth Five-Year Plan, 2016–2020, the National New-type Urbanization Plan (2014), 
and ADB’s PRC country partnership strategy, 2016–2020, support strategic priorities, in the areas 
of urban and environmental management.5 Key thematic areas that coincide with the proposed 
1  Qinghai  is  home  to  54  of  the 56  ethnic  groups  in  the  PRC.  It  is  also  one  of  the  less-developed  western  regions 
targeted for accelerated socioeconomic development and poverty reduction by the preferential policies under the 
National Strategy for Development of the West. 
2  Haidong—located along the Silk Road near a number of significant Buddhist temples, Qinghai Lake, and the train 
link to Lhasa—attracts many tourists in summer, which generates significant revenue and local employment.  
3  The current population of Ping’an District is 68,100 while the current population of Ledu District is 109,800.

project  include  (i)  strengthening  climate  resilience;  (ii) promoting  sustainable  use  of  land  and 
natural resources; (iii) strengthening water security; and (iv) promoting integrated water resource 
management, wetland protection, and afforestation. 
Lessons and special features. The project design incorporates lessons from previous 
6. 
ADB-financed projects and studies.6 These cover the need for (i) an integrated approach to river 
rehabilitation,  including  structural  and  nature-based  measures;  (ii)  strong  leadership  and 
governance  in  urban  and  environmental  management;  and  (iii) better  coordinated  decision-
making  on  integrated  water  resource  management.  These  lessons  are  reflected  in  several 
innovative  and  special  features:  (i)  preparatory  in-depth  provincial,  local,  and  project-specific 
climate risk and vulnerability assessments (CRVAs) to pinpoint and raise awareness of climate-
related  risks,  and  build  ecosystem-friendly  adaptation  measures  into  the  design  of  various 
infrastructure  components;  (ii)  reuse  of  treated  urban  wastewater  for  mountainside  forest 
irrigation, which will showcase an integrated approach to managing both water scarcity and soil 
erosion;  (iii) use  of  nature-based  measures  for  the  temporary  storage  of  floodwaters;  and 
(iv) institutional  strengthening  to  support  better  coordination  and  project  implementation  with 
regard to integrated water resource management.7 
A. 
Impacts and Outcome 
The  expected 
impacts  will  be  enhanced  environmental  protection,  ecological 
7. 
rehabilitation, and climate change adaptation; and improved flood control standards and urban 
aesthetics  along  the  Huangshui  River  (footnotes  5–6).    The  intended  outcome  will  be  an 
improvement in ecological and environmental services in Haidong.  
B. 
Outputs 
8. 
The project will have four outputs: (i) integrated flood plain management infrastructure is 
provided for Huangshui River; (ii) measures to control soil erosion in Haidong’s urban catchment 
are implemented; (iii) rural–urban water supply and solid waste infrastructure is constructed; and 
(iv) project management capacity is strengthened. 
Output  1  will  support  the  stabilization  of  riverbanks  and  improve  integrated  flood  risk 
9. 
management,  rehabilitate  riverine  wetlands,  increase  forest  coverage  within  riparian  areas, 
provide  environmental  education,  and  improve  recreational  opportunities  for  residents  through 
three components. First, the rehabilitation of existing and the addition of new embankments along 
the  main  Huangshui  River  channel  will  stabilize  the  riverbanks,  securing  both  agricultural  and 
urban land. Based on the CRVA, climate-proofing measures were incorporated into the project 
design; the embankment heights were increased to accommodate the projected average increase 
in flood flows (8%). Second, the establishment of a riverside greenbelt, including new vegetation 
and pedestrian paths, will allow for public space and seasonal flood water storage, improving local 
water absorption and decreasing downstream flood risks. Third, the development of an ecological 
wetland park will rehabilitate existing wetlands and allow seasonal flooding while educating the 
public on environmental issues.

Output 2 will focus on controlling soil erosion to reduce siltation in Huangshui River, pursue 
dust suppression, and set an urban growth boundary to protect the fragile mountainous landscape 
adjacent  to  Ping’an  District’s  urban  area.  Recognizing  the  increasing  local  water  scarcity 
(identified in the CRVA), treated urban wastewater from the existing Ping’an wastewater treatment 
plant will provide irrigation for the establishment of a mountainside forest. Output 2 will have two 
components: (i) planting new vegetation to establish a mountainside greenbelt; and (ii) expanding 
the irrigation network to include approximately 663 hectares of existing mountainside greenbelt 
using treated wastewater. The irrigation of these afforested areas with reused water has minimal 
impact on existing water resources while decreasing soil erosion.  
11. 
Output  3  will  focus  on  providing  critical  urban  and  rural  services;  it  will  contribute  to 
reducing water insecurity for rural and urban areas in Ping’an District, as well as improving solid 
waste treatment capacity for Ledu District. Output 3 will have two components: (i) building three 
water  treatment  plants  and  new  conveyance pipe  networks for raw  and potable  water;  and  (ii) 
adding 850,000 cubic meters of capacity to the Ledu landfill and building a leachate treatment 
facility. Based on the CRVA, climate-proofing measures include providing an alternative supply 
of  drinking  water  to  the  Ping’an  urban  area  to  reduce  the  water  scarcity  risk,  and  increasing 
drainage and leachate collection capacity at the landfill site. The provision of basic services to 
urban and rural areas aims to reduce the rural-urban infrastructure gap. 
12. 
Output 4 will support consulting services, training, and equipment to boost the capacity of 
the  executing  and  implementing  agencies  for  (i)  project  implementation  and  operational 
management, (ii) financial management, (iii) landfill operation and maintenance, (iv) wetland and 
forest  operation  and  maintenance,  (v)  flood  risk  management,  and  (vi) nonrevenue  water 
management. The output will also contribute to institutional strengthening, promote cooperation 
and decision-making at the river basin level, and develop a water safety plan to mitigate water 
insecurities in Haidong. A capacity development submodule was also included for climate-resilient 
urban development planning and regional water resource management. 
Innovation and special features. The project incorporates several innovative and special 
13. 
features, as summarized below: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
Climate  risk  and  vulnerability  assessment  to  raise  awareness  and  identify  risks 
related to climate change in Haidong.  
Incorporation  of  climate  risk  and  vulnerability  assessment  in the  design  of  flood 
protection infrastructure.  
Preparation of flood risk maps from 5-year to 100-year return period flood events. 
The project recommends that during implementation phase, land use policies in 
the Ping’an and Ledu districts should be updated to reflect the findings of the flood 
risk maps and restrict development in flood-prone areas. 
(iv)  Water  balance  study  and  nonrevenue  water  (NRW)  assessment  to  address 
(v) 
(vi) 
potable water security concerns in Ping’an District.  
Use  of  reclaimed  water  for  mountainside  irrigation  will  showcase  an  integrated 
approach to address water supply and soil erosion challenges.

COSTS AND FINANCING 
15. 
The PRC government has requested a loan of $150 million from ADB’s ordinary capital 
resources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 26-year term, including a grace period 
of  5  years,  a straight-line  repayment  option,  an annual  interest  rate determined  in  accordance 
with  ADB’s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  and  a  commitment 
charge of 0.15% per year. The interest during construction to be capitalized in the loan, and such 
other terms and conditions to be set forth in the loan and project agreements. The average loan 
maturity is 15.75 years and the maturity premium payable to ADB is 0.10% per annum. ADB’s 
Controller’s Department will provide the final confirmation and issue the loan repayment schedule 
at loan negotiations. Financial charges during implementation will be capitalized. 
The  ADB  loan  will  finance  64.0%  of  the  project  cost,  including  civil  works,  equipment, 
16. 
engineering  installation,  and  capacity  strengthening.  The  borrower  of  the  loan  is  the  PRC 
government and will make the loan available, through the Qinghai Provincial Government (QPG), 
to Haidong Municipal Government (HMG) on the same terms and conditions as those of the ADB 
loan. HMG will assume the foreign exchange and interest variation risks of the ADB loan. The 
PRC government, QPG, and HMG have assured ADB that counterpart funding will be provided 
in a timely manner, and any additional counterpart funding required for any shortfall of funds or 
cost overruns will be provided. The Qinghai Provincial Finance Department (QPFD) will open an 
imprest account, and Haidong Municipal Finance Bureau will open its own dedicated account and 
project account in the commercial bank respectively to manage it in line with the requirements in 
the Loan Agreement.

process, (ii) the amount of taxes and duties financed by the ADB loan does not represent an excessive share of 
the project, (iii) the taxes and duties apply only to ADB-financed expenditures, and (iv) the financing of taxes and 
duties is material and relevant to the success of the project.

FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT 
A. 
Financial Management Assessment 
20. 
The  financial  management  assessment  was  conducted  in  accordance  with  ADB’s 
Guidelines  for  the  Financial  Management  and  Analysis  of  Projects  (2005),  Financial  Due 
Diligence:  a  Methodology  Note,  and  Technical  Guidance  Note:  Financial  Management 
Assessment.9 According  to  the  implementation  arrangement,  Haidong  Municipal  Government 
(HMG) is the executing agency with the overall responsibility of planning and implementation of 
the project and its project management office (PMO) is set in the Haidong Water Affairs Bureau. 
There  are  five  implementing  agencies,  including  (i)  Ping’an  Water  Affairs  Bureau;  (ii)  Ping’an 
Forestry  Resource  Bureau;  (iii)  Ping’an  Housing,  Planning,  and  Construction  Bureau;  Ledu 
Housing,  Planning,  Construction  Bureau;  and (iv)  Ledu Water  Affairs  Bureau  to  implement the

four project components. The assessment covered funds-flow arrangements, staffing, accounting 
and  financial  reporting  systems,  internal  and  external  auditing  arrangements,  and  financial 
information  systems.  The  instrument  used  for  the  assessment  is  ADB’s  standard  financial 
management assessment questionnaire with considering country partnership strategy. 
21. 
The  assessment  identified  the  main  financial  management  risks  as:  (i)  implementation 
risk—lack of familiarity with ADB disbursement procedures and requirements which could delay 
project implementation; (ii) compliance risk—lack of familiarity with ADB financial management 
requirements,  particularly  on  accounting,  reporting,  and  auditing,  which  may  delay  project 
reporting and derail identification of issues on the use of loan proceeds; and (iii) financing risk—
delays 
funding,  which  could  delay  project 
implementation. The  overall financial management  risk  rating of the  project  before  considering 
mitigating measures is Moderate to substantial. The identified financial management risks will be 
closely  monitored  during  project  implementation.  The  financial  management  action  plan  is  as 
follows:

B. 
Disbursement 
The  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  Loan  Disbursement 
22. 
Handbook  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time),  and  detailed  arrangements  agreed  upon 
between the government and ADB. Online training for project staff on disbursement policies and 
procedures 
is 
is  available  at:  http://wpqr4.adb.org/disbursement_elearning.  Project  staff 
encouraged to avail of this training to help ensure efficient disbursement and fiduciary control. 
Imprest fund procedure. To facilitate project implementation through timely release of 
23. 
loan  proceeds,  QPFD  will  establish  an  imprest  account  promptly  after  loan  effectiveness  at  a 
commercial bank acceptable to ADB. The imprest account is to be used exclusively for the ADB’s 
share of eligible expenditures. The currency of the imprest account will be US dollar. QPFD, who 
established the  imprest  account  in  its  name,  is  accountable  and  responsible for  proper  use  of 
advances to the imprest account. The total outstanding advance to the imprest account should 
not exceed the estimate of ADB’s share of expenditures to be paid through the imprest account 
25 
for the forthcoming 6 months. QPFD may request for initial and additional advances to the imprest 
account based on an Estimate of Expenditure Sheet setting out the estimated expenditures to be 
financed  through  the  account  for  the  forthcoming  6  months.  Supporting  documents  should  be 
submitted  to  ADB  or  retained  by  QPFD  in  accordance  with  the  handbook  when  liquidating  or 
replenishing the imprest account. 
24. 
Statement of expenditure procedure. The statement of expenditure (SOE) procedure 
may be used for reimbursement of eligible expenditures or liquidation of advances to the imprest 
account.10 The  ceiling  of  the  SOE  procedure  is  the  equivalent  of  US$100,000  per  individual 
payment. Supporting documents and records for the expenditures claimed under the should be 
maintained and made readily available for review by ADB's disbursement and review missions, 
upon  ADB's  request  for  submission  of  supporting  documents  on  a  sampling  basis,  and  for 
independent audit. Reimbursement and liquidation of individual payments in excess of the SOE 
ceiling should be supported by full documentation when submitting the withdrawal application to 
ADB. 
The minimum value per withdrawal application is set in accordance with the handbook. 
25. 
Individual payments below this amount should be paid by the HMG and/or district governments 
and subsequently claimed from ADB (i) through reimbursement; or (ii) from the imprest account, 
unless otherwise accepted by ADB.  
C. 
Accounting 
26. 
The HMG will maintain, or cause to be maintained, separate books and records by funding 
source  for  all  expenditures  incurred  on  the  project  using  the  Accounting  Methods  for  Projects 
Financed  by  the  World  Bank  (reference  No.  2000  [13]).11 The  HMG  will  prepare  consolidated 
project  financial  statements  in  accordance  with  the  government's  accounting  laws  and 
regulations, which are consistent with international accounting principles and practices. 
D. 
Auditing 
27. 
HMG  will  cause  the  detailed  consolidated  project  financial  statements  to  be  audited  in 
accordance with national auditing standards by an independent auditor acceptable to ADB. The 
audited  project financial statements together  with  the  auditors’  opinion will  be  submitted  in  the 
English language to ADB within 6 months of the end of the fiscal year by the HMG. 
The annual audit report for the project accounts will include an audit management letter 
28. 
and audit opinions which cover (i) whether the project financial statements present a true and fair 
view or are presented fairly, in all material respects, in accordance with the applicable financial 
reporting framework; (ii) whether loan and grant proceeds were used only for the purposes of the 
project  or  not;  (iii)  the  level  of  compliance  for  financial  covenants  contained  in  the  legal 
agreements for the project; (iv) use of the imprest fund procedure; and (v) the use of the SOE 
procedure certifying to the eligibility of those expenditures claimed under SOE procedures, and 
proper use of the SOE and imprest procedures in accordance with the handbook and the project 
documents. 
10 SOE forms are available in Appendix 9B and 9C of ADB’s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from 
time to time). 
11 Accounting regulations issued by the Ministry of Finance for all foreign aid-funded projects.

Compliance with financial reporting and auditing requirements will be monitored by review

missions and during normal program supervision, and followed up regularly with all concerned, 
including the external auditor.  
The HMG and the implementing agencies have been made aware of ADB’s approach to 
30. 
delayed submission, and the requirements for satisfactory and acceptable quality of the audited 
project financial statements. ADB reserves the right to require a change in the auditor (in a manner 
consistent with the constitution of the borrower), or for additional support to be provided to the 
auditor, if the audits required are not conducted in a manner satisfactory to ADB, or if the audits 
are  substantially  delayed.  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  verify  the  project's  financial  accounts  to 
confirm  that  the  share  of  ADB’s  financing  is  used  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  policies  and 
procedures.  
31. 
Public  disclosure  of  the  project  financial  statements,  including  the  audit  report  on  the 
project financial statements, will be guided by ADB’s Public Communications Policy 2011. After 
review, ADB will disclose the project financial statements for the project and the opinion of the 
auditors on the financial statements within 14 days upon ADB’s acceptance by posting them on 
ADB’s website. The Audit Management Letter will not be disclosed. 
VI. 
PROCUREMENT AND CONSULTING SERVICES 
32. 
A project procurement risk assessment was conducted for the project, in accordance with 
the Guide on Assessing Procurement Risks and Determining Project Procurement Classification 
(ADB 2014). Overall project procurement risk is moderate. 
33. 
The  main  weaknesses  identified  are  that  the  PMO  are  understaffed  with  insufficient 
experienced personnel to conduct all procurements and consultant recruitments for the project; 
and there are some inconsistencies between ADB and HMG’s procurement practices. 
34. 
These risks are being and will be mitigated as (i) the PMO has committed to fulfill ADB’s 
requirements  for  all  procurements  and  consultant  recruitments  for  the  project,  (ii)  capacity 
development was/is being/will be conducted by ADB, procurement consultants and a procurement 
agency,  and  (iii)  supports  for  procurements  and  consultant  recruitments  will  be  provided  by 
procurement consultants, and a procurement agency. 
A. 
Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing 
35. 
All advance contracting and retroactive financing should be undertaken in conformity to 
ADB’s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time),12 and ADB’s Guidelines 
on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time).13 The issuance of invitations to 
bid under advance contracting and retroactive financing will be subject to ADB’s approval. The 
borrower,  HMG,  and  the  implementing  agencies  have  been  advised  that  approval  of  advance 
contracting and retroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance the project.  
Advance  contracting  applies  to  the  consulting  services  contract  for  the  initial  project 
36. 
implementation support, external resettlement and social monitor, and project implementation and 
institutional strengthening support. 
12 Procurement Guidelines:http://www.adb.org/Documents/Guidelines/Procurement/Guidelines-Procurement.pdf 
13 Consulting Guidelines: http://www.adb.org/Documents/Guidelines/Consulting/Guidelines-Consultants.pdf 
27 
Retroactive financing. HMG was advised that retroactive financing may only apply up to 
37. 
the  equivalent  of  20%  of  the  total  ADB  loan,  to  cover  eligible  expenditures  incurred for  works, 
goods, and consulting services procured through advance contracting before loan effectiveness, 
but  not  more  than  12  months  before  the  signing  of  the  loan  agreement.  Retroactive  financing 
applies to the consulting services contracts for the initial project implementation support. 
B. 
Procurement of Goods, Works, and Consulting Services 
All  procurement  of  goods  and  works  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB’s 
38. 
Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time) and the Procurement Reform–10 
Point Action Plan and associated reforms. The relevant sections of ADB’s Anticorruption Policy 
(1998, as amended to date) will be included in procurement documents and contracts. 
1.  
National Competitive Bidding Procedures 
39. 
Before  the  start  of  any  procurement,  ADB  and  the  government  will  review  the  public 
procurement laws of the central and provincial governments to ensure consistency with ADB’s 
Procurement  Guidelines  (2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  National  competitive  bidding 
(NCB) will be used for civil works contracts estimated to cost from $100,000 to below $40 million 
and for goods contracts from $100,000 to below $3 million. CNY may be used for the purpose of 
bidding and payment. NCB contracts with estimated cost of $500,000 or more for goods and $1 
million or more for works will also be advertised in Business Opportunities of ADB’s website.  
40. 
The first draft English language of the procurement documents (bidding documents, and 
draft contract) should be submitted for ADB approval regardless of the estimated contract amount. 
The first NCB contracts and those higher than $10 million are subject to prior review. 
41. 
Procurement for goods and works contracts with value less than $10 million are subject 
to post review. Documents must be recorded and submitted for post review no later than 1 month 
after they are completed or issued. 
2. 
Shopping 
The shopping procurement method will be allowed for contracts valued below $100,000 
42. 
equivalent for civil works and goods, respectively. The relevant sections of ADB’s Anticorruption 
Policy (1998, as amended to date) will be included in procurement documents and contracts. 
3.  
Consulting Services 
43. 
Project  management  consulting  services  and  capacity  development  services  will  be 
recruited according to ADB’s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time 
to  time). 14  The  PMO  will  be  responsible  for  engaging  consultants  for  relevant  services.  An 
estimated  217  person-months  (32  international  and  185  national)  of  consulting  services  are 
required  for  (i)  project  implementation  and  institutional  strengthening  support;  (ii)  external 
resettlement and social monitoring; (iii) initial project implementation support; (iv) climate-resilient 
water  resources  management  planning  support;  (v)  landfill  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M) 
and solid waste management support; and (vi) wetland O&M and forest management support. 
The consulting firm will be engaged using the quality- and cost-based selection (QCBS) method 
with a standard quality: cost ratio of 80:20 using full technical proposal procedure, consultant’s

Procurement Plan 
44. 
 A  procurement  plan  indicating  procurement  or  selection  methods,  estimated  costs  of 
contracts,  thresholds  and  review  procedures for goods,  works,  and  consulting  service contract 
packages  is  prepared  and  summarized  below.  The  procurement  plan  shall  be  executed  in the 
manner in which it has been approved by ADB. The procurement plan shall be updated annually 
or as needed throughout the duration of the project. The contract packages are categorized into 
three  categories  including  Goods,  Works,  and  Consulting  Services.  The  Works  contracts  are 
mainly in the areas of water supply, water reclamation, landfill, river rehabilitation, wetland and 
afforestation, which are common in China and in Qinghai Province. Some of the equipment and 
materials  are  included  in  the  works  contracts  to  reduce  contract  interfaces  and  minimize  the 
contract  management  risks,  based  on  the  nature  of  the  equipment  and  materials  and  their 
interaction with relevant works. Others equipment and materials that are independent of the civil 
works are listed as Goods contracts. The technical assistance and studies designed to strengthen 
the  capacity  of  the  PMO  and  implementing  agencies  during  implementation  and  O&M  of  the 
project are packaged into consulting service contracts.

Environment 
VII.SAFEGUARDS 
Environmental safeguards categorization due diligence. The project is classified as 
74. 
category B for environment. An initial environmental examination (IEE) including environmental 
management plan (EMP) was prepared in compliance with ADB’s Safeguard Policy Statement 
(SPS, 2009) and disclosed on the ADB website. The IEE incorporates findings of the domestic 
feasibility  studies,  domestic  environmental  impact  assessments  (EIAs),  and  soil  erosion 
protection plans prepared by licensed domestic institutes,19 and topical studies conducted in the 
framework  of  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (including  biodiversity  and  habitat 
survey  along  the  Huangshui  river,  a  comprehensive climate  risk  and vulnerability  assessment, 
water resources assessment, and others). The domestic safeguards documents were prepared 
in  compliance  with  the  PRC  Law  on  Environmental  Impact  Assessment  (2003),  the  Technical 
Guidelines for Environmental Impact Assessment (HJ/T2-93) and other relevant PRC regulations 
and guidelines. All domestic EIAs and soil erosion protection plans have been approved by the 
Haidong environment protection and water resources management authorities. The project IEE 
and EMP (not the domestic EIAs) form the basis of the official loan agreement between ADB and 
the  executing  agency.  The  executing  agency,  through  the  PMO,  holds  final  responsibility  for 
implementation and compliance with the IEE and EMP. 
75. 
Anticipated impacts and mitigation measures during construction. Potential impacts 
during construction have been identified in the consolidated project IEE. Impact assessment for 
all  project  activities covered the following  issues:   (i)  earthworks,  (ii)  soil erosion, (iii)  dust  and 
gaseous air pollution, (iv) noise, (v) construction wastewater, (vi) loss of terrestrial and aquatic 
habitat,  (vii)  risk  of  introducing  invasive  species,  (viii)  impacts  from  pipe-laying,  (ix)  temporary 
traffic management, (x) hazardous and polluting materials, and (xi) worker and community health 
and safety. For each, the severity of potential impact has been assessed in relation to the baseline 
environment and sensitive receptors, which might be adversely affected. The main findings of the 
IEE are that construction will cause no loss of valuable ecology or physical cultural resources, 
and that construction dust, noise, erosion, and local disruption to traffic and communities will be 
temporary  and  can  be  successfully  managed.  Avoidance  of  impact  through  design  and  site 
management  and  mitigation measures through  construction management  have been  identified 
for each impact and these are listed in the project EMP for the attention of contractors and PMO. 
In all cases, where the EMP requirements are strictly followed, construction impacts will be kept 
at acceptable levels. 
76. 
Anticipated  impacts  and  mitigation  measures  during  operation.  Potential  impacts 
during  operation  have  been  identified  in  the  consolidated  project  IEE.  The  operation  of  flood 
protection  embankments  along  the  Huangshui  River  will  make  use  of  design  alternatives  to 
promote the reestablishment of riverside habitats. Downstream afflux effects of flood protection 
works have been modelled and are not significant. The existing flood warning and early warning 
system operated at Huangshui watershed (for major floods along the Huangshui River) and at 
municipal level (for flash floods along small tributaries) will complete the flood protection system. 
Potential  operational  impacts  arise  from  the  risks  of  unsustainable  water  use  for  the  range  of 
irrigation applications (riverside greenbelts and mountain shelter belts) and for the water supply 
components in the Qijiachuan Valley. Strict water allocations in the reservoir regulation plans will 
ensure  water  supply  for  all  target  rural  communities.  A  water  safety  plan  will  reinforce  these 
outcomes. Additional operational safeguards at the water supply water treatment plants focus on 
19 All domestic EIAs were approved by the Haidong Environment Protection Bureau (HEPB) in April 2016. 
46 
the  safe  handling  of  the  necessary  corrosive  chemicals  and  assurances  that  the  legislative 
protections given to water sources in PRC are in place and are being enforced. Landfill design, 
separation buffer, and operational control will minimize impacts to environment and communities. 
The  critical  safeguard  for  the  landfill  site  is  the  functioning  of  the  leachate  treatment  system, 
methane control, and proper site management of the tip face. The leachate treatment plant will 
be  designed  to  contain  leachate  for  periods  of  plant  malfunction  or  maintenance.  A  methane 
collection system and monitoring system will be part of the detailed design. Control of noise, dust, 
odor, erosion, and local transportation impacts are also parts of the management. The monitoring 
of water quality of treated wastewater from Ping’an wastewater treatment plants is also required 
to ensure continued reuse as irrigation water. 
77. 
The  project  is  classified  as  medium  climate  risk.  A  climate  risk  and  vulnerability 
assessment (CRVA) was conducted at two levels: (i) at regional level to assess the vulnerability 
of the IWMPHRB; and (ii) at Haidong level to assess the vulnerability of the designs of proposed 
project components, and the water resource management elements of the Haidong City Master 
Plan.  The  CRVA  found  that  (i)  total  water  resources  in  Qinghai  Province  will  not  change 
significantly in future, but seasonal and annual variability are likely to increase; (ii) climate risks 
along Huangshui River are likely to increase due to increased seasonal and annual variability in 
precipitation and hence river flow volumes. Key recommendations of the CRVA were incorporated 
in the component design, including (i) increased embankment heights to accommodate projected 
average increase in flood flows resulting from climate change (8%); (ii) provision of alternative 
water supply source for the Ping’an urban district to reduce increasing water security risk; and (iii) 
increased  capacity  of  drainage  and  leachate  collection  system  at  landfill  site.  A  capacity 
development  submodule  for  climate-resilient  urban  development  planning  and  regional  water 
resources management has been included to component 4 of the project. The submodule will be 
coordinated and provided by climate change and water resources management specialists. They 
will,  among  others,  help the  HMG  review  and  climate-proof the  Haidong City  Master  Plan  and 
assess the feasibility to establish a provincial-level Huangshui River coordination body to address 
Huangshui water resources management issues at watershed level. 
Environmental  management  plan  (EMP) 
78. 
implementation  arrangements.  The 
responsibilities  for  environmental  management  and  supervision  during  the  various  stages  of 
implementation  of  the  project  are  defined  in  the  EMP.20 The  EMP  will  be  implemented  in  all 
phases of the project—design, pre-construction, construction, and operation. The EMP complies 
with the PRC’s environmental laws and ADB’s SPS (2009). The EMP contains (i) objectives; (ii) 
roles  and  responsibilities;  (iii)  mitigation  measures;  (iv)  inspection,  monitoring,  and  reporting 
arrangements;  (v)  training  and  institutional  strengthening;  (vi)  grievance  redress  mechanism 
(GRM); and (vii) future public consultation. The EMP is included in this PAM as Appendix 1 and 
will be updated at the end of the detailed design. The EMP will also be included as a separate 
annex in all bidding and contract documents. The contractors will be made aware (through the 
PMO and the tendering agency) of their obligations to implement the EMP and to budget EMP 
implementation  costs  in  their  proposals.  HMG  (through  the  PMO)  and  the  five  implementing 
agencies  will  assume  overall  responsibility  for  implementing,  supervising,  monitoring,  and 
reporting  on  the  EMP.  Their  capacity  to  implement  the  EMP,  as  well  as  the  capacity  of  the 
operation and maintenance unit to manage project facilities, will be strengthened through capacity 
building and training activities defined under project component 4 (capacity building). The PMO 
and  the  implementing  agencies  will  assign  qualified  staff  to  coordinate  and  monitor  EMP 
implementation.  These  will  be  supported  by  environment  management  and  sector  specialists 
contracted by the PMO.  
20 Any revisions of the EMP will be disclosed in compliance with ADB’s Public Communications Policy (2011). 
47 
79. 
Project  management  office,  environment  specialist.  The  PMO  will  have  main  EMP 
coordination  responsibility.  A  full  time  environmental  specialist  will  be  assigned  in  the  PMO  to 
coordinate  implementation  of  the  EMP.  The  officer  will,  among  others,  (i)  ensure  that 
environmental management, monitoring, and mitigation measures are incorporated into bidding 
documents,  construction  contracts,  and  operation  management  plans;  (ii)  establish  and 
coordinate the  project  level  GRM;  (iii)  on  behalf of  PMO,  prepare annual  EMP  monitoring  and 
progress  reports,  for  submission  to  ADB;  (iv)  coordinate  the  training  and  consultation  plans 
defined in the EMP; (v) respond to any unforeseen adverse impacts beyond those mentioned in 
this EMP; and (vi) coordinate work with the implementing agency environment specialists.21 
80. 
Implementing agency environment specialists. Each implementing agency will assign 
one environment specialist to coordinate EMP at local level i.e. total of five officers. These officers 
will (i) implement the EMP at a day-to-day site level; (ii) coordinate the recruitment of construction 
supervision  companies  (CSCs);  (iii)  act  as  local  entry  points  to  the  GRM;  (iv)  report  to  the 
implementing agencies and PMO on EMP implementation progress; and (v) work closely with the 
PMO environment specialist to coordinate EMP work, including reporting, across the project area. 
22 
81. 
Environmental  monitoring  station.  In  Haidong,  the  EMS  of  the  city  environment 
protection  bureau  (EPB)  will  be  contracted  by  the  implementing  agencies  to  implement  the 
external environmental monitoring program described in this EMP (Section E). The implementing 
agency  environment specialists  will  supervise this monitoring. The  EMS  will  report  to  the  local 
EPB and the PMO.  
82. 
Loan  implementation  environment  consultants.  Loan  implementation  environment 
consultants (LIEC) will be hired under the loan implementation consultant services. The LIEC will 
advise the contractors, CSCs, implementing agencies, and PMO on all aspects of environmental 
management  and  monitoring  for  the  project.  The  LIEC  will  (i)  assist  in  updating  the  EMP  and 
environmental monitoring program, as needed; (ii) supervise the implementation of the mitigation 
measures specified in the EMP; (iii) train the PMO and implementing agencies on how to prepare 
the annual EMP monitoring and progress reports to ADB during the early stages of training, and 
lead the preparation of these documents; (iv) provide training to the CSC implementing agencies, 
and  PMO,  on  PRC’s  environmental  laws,  regulations,  and  policies,  ADB’s  SPS  (2009),  EMP 
implementation,  and  GRM  in  accordance  with  the  training  plan;  (v)  identify  any  environment 
related implementation issues, and propose necessary corrective actions; and (vi) undertake site 
visits for EMP inspection as required.23 
83. 
The  loan  implementation  consultancy  services  will  also  include  water  and  wastewater 
specialists,  a  wetland  specialist  and  river  ecology  and/or  hydrology  specialists,  and  ecology 
experts.  In  addition,  separate  contracts  will  be  awarded  to  consulting  firms  specialized  in 
municipal  waste  management,  including  landfill  O&M);  wetland  O&M;  forest  management, 
including irrigation; water resources management; and climate adaptation.

contractors  will  be  responsible  for  implementing  the  mitigation  measures  during  construction 
under  supervision  of  the  implementing  agency-environmental  specialist  and  the  PMO-
environmental specialist. In their bids, contractors will be required to respond to the environmental 
management requirements defined in the EMP. Each contractor will be required to develop site-
specific  EMPs  and will  assign  a person  responsible for  environment,  health and  safety  (onsite 
environment engineer). After project completion, environmental management responsibilities will 
be  handed  over  to  project  facility  operators.  During  the  operational  phase,  the  implementing 
agencies  and 
the  environmental  management  and 
implementation of mitigation measures by the subproject project facility operators.  
the  Haidong  EPB  will  supervise 
85. 
Contractor environmental specifications will be included in all civil works contracts. The 
contractor  environmental  specifications  (see  Appendix  2  to  EMP)  are  standard  environmental 
clauses and subclauses that are applicable to all general infrastructure construction. The objective 
of  these  clauses  is  to  reduce  and  manage  all  potential  environmental  impacts  caused  by  the 
construction  activities.  These  specifications  should  be  included  into  the  standard  contractor 
specifications included in the contract between the implementing agency and the contractor. 
86. 
Grievance redress mechanism. A project-specific GRM has been established to receive 
and manage any public environmental and/or social issues which may arise due to the project. 
The  environment  specialists  and  social  officers  in  the  PMO  and  implementing  agency  will 
coordinate the GRM. All project agencies and staff will be trained in the GRM and will take an 
active role in supporting the GRM when necessary. 
Pursuant to ADB's SPS, ADB funds may not be applied to the activities described on the 
87. 
ADB Prohibited Investment Activities List set forth at Appendix 5 of the SPS. 
B. 
Land Acquisition and Resettlement 
Introduction. The project is classified as Category A for ADB’s involuntary resettlement 
88. 
standard and thus the resettlement plan and subsequent updates or new resettlement plan will 
need  to  be  reviewed  and  cleared  by  ADB’s  Environment  and  Social  Safeguards  Division,  in 
accordance with ADB’s SPS. 
89. 
 Since  the  detailed  measurement  surveys  have  not  been  conducted,  the  current 
resettlement plan is considered a draft and will have to be updated and resubmitted to ADB for 
approval. The update will be based on the final designs, census of affected persons, and inventory 
of  loses  (land  and  fixed  assets).The  project  implementing  agencies  will  re-endorse  the  final 
resettlement  plan  and  re-disclosed  to  affected  villages.  The  construction  contract  for  any  civil 
works involving resettlement impacts will not be awarded until the relevant updated resettlement 
plan is approved by ADB. 
90. 
Scope  of  resettlement  impacts.  In  order  to  avoid  or  minimize  the  impacts  of  land 
acquisition  and  resettlement  (LAR),  consultations  were  conducted  with  the  local  government 
departments, village committees, and affected persons during the preparation of the resettlement 
plan. Based on the latest feasibility study report, the project will affect 49 villages in eight towns, 
townships and subdistricts belonging to two districts (Ledu and Ping’an) in the project area. 
The project will require a total area of 5,323.96 mu of land to be permanently occupied, 
91. 
including acquisition of 1,460.97 mu collective owned land (including 540.87 mu of irrigated land, 
207.35 mu of river flat, 470.8 mu of woodland, 121.95 mu of grassland and 120 mu of wasteland), 
leasing of 744 mu of collective owned land, occupation of 1,570.5 mu collective owned barren 
hills, and occupation of 1,416.49 mu state-owned non-farmland.24 In addition, the project will also 
temporarily occupy 106.82 mu collective owned land. The project will affect 842 households with 
3,112  persons  permanently  and  145  households  with  423  persons  temporarily,  totaling  987 
households with 3,535 persons (Table 21).

92. 
 Resettlement  policy  framework  and  compensation  rates.  The  objective  of 
resettlement is to develop an action plan for restoration for those affected by the project so that 
they benefit from the project, and their living standard is improved or at least restored. HMG will 
make unified planning for livelihood restoration, and has issued the Letter of Committee of the 
HMG on land acquisition and livelihood restoration costs of the project based on consultations 
with the affected persons, HMG, implementing agencies, local government departments, PMO, 
and project implementation units (PIUs), as well as the practical experiences in the project area. 
The following principles of resettlement are agreed for the project: 
avoid or minimize resettlement, wherever feasible; 
compensation and entitlements provided to the affected persons will be adequate 
to at least maintain their “without project” standard of living, and have prospects of 
improvement; 
all affected persons will be provided with resettlement assistance and granted fair 
compensation based on their title status;  
where  post-requisition  cultivated  land  per  capita  is  not  sufficient  to  maintain 
livelihood,  compensation  in  cash  for  other  income-generating  activities  will  be 
provided for the affected persons;  
all  the  affected  persons will  be  adequately  informed  on  eligibility,  compensation 
rates and standards, livelihood and income restoration plans, project timing, and 
will be involved in the resettlement plan implementation process;  
no  land  requisition  will  take  place  unless  replacement  land  or  sufficient 
compensation for resettlement is given to the affected persons;

compensation and resettlement operations; 
vulnerable groups will receive special assistance to ensure they are better off, so 
that the affected persons listed in the resettlement plan will have the opportunity 
to benefit from the project;  
resettlement plan will be integrated with the overall city/district planning; and 
the resettlement budget will adequately cover the full aspects of all compensation 
required. 
The LAR compensation policies and standards will follow the Land Administration Law of 
93. 
the PRC (2004), Decision of the State Council on Deepening the Reform and Rigidly Enforcing 
Land Administration (SC [2004] No.28) (1 October 2004), and other applicable guidelines. They 
will also be based on local policies and standards regarding LAR in Qinghai, and ADB’s SPS. 
94. 
According to the Notice of the Qinghai Provincial Government on the Promulgation and 
Implementation of Uniform Annual Output Values and Location-based Compensation Rates for 
Land  Acquisition  (QPG  [2015]  No.  61),  in  areas  where  uniform  average  annual  output  value 
(AAOV) rate for land acquisition apply, compensation rates for collective land shall be as follows:  
The  compensation  rate  for  irrigated  land  is  20  times  the  corresponding  uniform 
AAOV; if the per capita cultivated area of any affected village is less than 0.3 mu 
after land acquisition, the compensation rate is 30 times.  
(i) 
24 A mu is a Chinese unit of measurement (1 mu = 666.67 m2). 
50 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
(v) 
(vi) 
The  compensation  rate  for  pasture  land  is  11  times  the  corresponding  uniform 
AAOV; vegetable and garden land will be compensated for as cultivated land.  
The compensation rate for woodland is 6 times the corresponding uniform AAOV; 
the  compensation  rate  for  unused  land  is  equal  to  the  uniform  AAOV  of  the 
surrounding land.  
Construction land is compensated for at the rate of the surrounding land. 
Compensation  rates  for  acquired  state-owned  farmland  shall  be  determined  by 
reference to the above rates; if the right to use state-owned construction land is 
withdrawn, reasonable financial compensation shall be paid to the holder of such 
right as otherwise stipulated by the provincial government. 
The  land  for  riverside  shelter  forest  construction  will  be  obtained  by  land 
circulation,  and  the  affected  households  or  collectives  will  be  subject  to  cash 
compensation  at  a  rate  of  CNY1,040  per  mu.  The  remaining  land  contracting 
period is 12 years (Table 22). 
95. 
All affected people are eligible to receive compensation and assistance. The cut-off date 
for certification of such entitlement will be disclosed to all the affected persons immediately after 
it is determined (usually on the date when the land acquisition announcement is published by the 
government according to the Land Administration Law). Inclusion in the project area will have a 
cut-off-date on 30 June 2016. 
96. 
Resettlement and rehabilitation measures. An evaluation was conducted for the land 
losses  of  affected  villager  groups  and  households.  The  results  show  that  most  affected 
households are not significantly affected (i.e., lose more than 10% of their income source). For 
most,  cash  compensation  will  be  adequate,  but  for  some  the  income  restoration  plan  will  be 
subject  to  further  negotiation  and  discussion  with  the  affected  persons,  with  the  findings  and 
results included in the final resettlement plan. 
97. 
In general, the income restoration options include:  
(i) 
Employment. Affected persons are mostly employed in nearby towns. The local 
governments will offer public welfare jobs (i.e. municipal construction, landscaping, 
cleaning, and security) first to the affected persons. It is estimated that the project 
will generate temporary and permanent jobs at the construction stage—including 
skilled and unskilled jobs—first to the affected persons. 
Skills  training.  For  affected  persons  who  get  employed  or  startup  businesses 
independently, a skills training program has been developed, including agriculture, 
cultivation, computer, cooking, construction, maternity matron, old-age care, etc. 
Qualified trainees will receive vocational qualification certificates. 
Social security. Endowment insurance will be provided to eligible farmers affected 
by  land  acquisition;  older  farmers  can  be  provided  rural-urban  social  welfare 
insurance. Each insured person will receive a basic pension subsidy of CNY120 
per month from the local government. 
(ii) 
(iii) 
98. 
 Resettlement  budget  and  financing  plan.  The  resettlement  budget  of  the  project  is 
CNY112  million,  including  CNY101  million  for  permanent  land  acquisition  and  temporary  land 
occupation, and CNY9.29 million for land leasing for the first 12 years. The detailed budget of the 
resettlement fund will  be  updated  upon finalization of  the  compensation  standards  and project 
design, and included in the final resettlement plan. The resettlement fund will be financed and 
paid  by  HMG  as  a  part  of  the  total  project  investment.  A  compensation  agreement  will  be 
negotiated  and  entered  into  with  the  village  and/or  community  committees  and  the  affected 
51 
households during the LAR implementation. On this basis, the final cost will be further updated. 
The implementing agencies will be responsible to finance any shortfall in such costs (Table 23). 
99. 
Institutional  arrangements. The  HMG  is  the  executing  agency  of the  project  and has 
established  the  project  leading  group  for  ADB-loan  Qinghai  Haidong  Urban-Rural  Eco 
Development  Project  to  be  wholly  responsible  for  the  organizational  leadership  of  the  project, 
coordinating  and  solving  major  issues,  directing  and  coordinating  project  implementation,  and 
supervising the progress of project implementation.  
100.  The  HMG  and  related  local  governments  have designated  ADB-loan PMOs  in  different 
levels to be responsible for project preparation and management. PMOs will be responsible for 
managing and coordinating the resettlement activities, including payment of compensation. To be 
specific, the Resettlement and Social Affairs Departments or full time staff under PMOs will be 
specifically responsible for preparing and managing the implementation of resettlement, financial 
payment, and internal monitoring. Delegated by PMOs, land management bureaus in the related 
district and counties will be responsible for the specific implementation of LAR, while the towns, 
townships,  and  villages  in  the  project  area  will  provide  assistance  in  the  updating  and 
implementation of the resettlement plan. 
101. 
 To ensure smooth implementation, the staff in charge of LAR will undertake training on 
resettlement implementation organized by the Haidong PMO. A resettlement start-up consultant 
will  provide  training  in ADB’s  policy  requirements  and  will  assist the  implementing  agencies to 
update and finalize their resettlement plan. The resettlement plan will be (i) updated based on the 
final  design,  detailed  measurement  survey,  and  census  of  affected  persons;  (ii)  disclosed  to 
affected persons; and (iii) submitted to ADB for review and approval prior to the award of civil 
works contract and commencement of land acquisition or house demolition. 
102. 
 The  resettlement  implementation  schedule  has  been  prepared  based  on  the  project 
preparation  and  construction  timetable.  The  schedule  is  quite  ambitious  with  LAR  preparatory 
starting as early as November 2016 (Table 24). This means:  
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
the resettlement start-up consultant will need to be engaged by the end of February 
2017;  
the external resettlement monitor will need to be engaged by March 2017; and 
considerable preparatory and implementation work will need to be carried out to 
ensure there is no delay to the planned construction schedules.    
103.  Grievance redress mechanism. A GRM has been developed in compliance with ADB’s 
SPS (2009) requirement to address environmental, health, safety, and social concerns associated 
with project construction, operation, land acquisition, and leasing arrangements. The details of 
the GRM, including a time-bound flow chart of procedures, are included in the project EMP and 
resettlement plan; the complaint channels are slightly different for environmental and resettlement 
issues, but the PMO will maintain and integrate system to document, follow up, and reports on all 
cases. 
104.  Persons  affected  by  LAR,  including  land  transfer,  may  file  an  appeal  on  any  aspect  of 
resettlement, such as compensation rates, etc. The means of appeal, and the names, locations, 
persons  responsible  and  telephone  numbers  of  the  appeal  accepting  agencies  will  be 
communicated  to  the  affected  persons  at  a  meeting,  through  an  announcement  or  the 
resettlement information booklet, so that the displaced persons know their right of appeal. Mass 
media  will  be  used  to  strengthen  publicity  and  reporting,  and  comments  and  suggestions  on 
resettlement  from  all  parties  concerned  will  be  shared  by  the  resettlement  organization.  All 
52 
agencies  will  accept  grievances  and  appeals  from  the  affected  people  for  free,  and  costs  so 
reasonably incurred will be disbursed from the contingency costs. 
105.  During the design and implementation periods of the project, these appeal procedures will 
remain  effective  to  ensure  that  the  affected  people  can  use  them  to  address  relevant  issues. 
Affected persons can also submit complaints to ADB, which will first be handled by the project 
team. If an affected person is still not satisfied and believes he and/or she has been harmed due 
to noncompliance with ADB policy, he and/or she may submit a complaint to ADB’s Accountability 
Mechanism.25 
106.  Monitoring and evaluation. A detailed plan for both the internal and external monitoring 
is included in the resettlement plan. Haidong PMO will include a summary of internal monitoring 
in the semiannual project progress reports submitted to ADB. Furthermore, the PMO will employ 
an external resettlement monitoring institute or firm to monitor and evaluate resettlement progress 
and  results.  A  baseline  survey  for  a  sample  of  affected  persons  will  be  completed  for  each 
resettlement component before the LAR begins. Semiannual external monitoring reports will be 
prepared to PMO and ADB directly during the project implementation period.

Ethnic Minority Development Plan 
107. 
 The project is classified category B for ADB’s indigenous peoples safeguard. The project 
components  are  focused  on  urban  and  rural  areas  of  Haidong,  with  ethnic  minorities  forming 
about 10% of population. There are 10,054 Hui people or 4.6% and 4,192 Tibetans or 1.9% of 
total population, together with Menggu and Tu, living in the direct project area who will benefit 
from better access to public services and enjoy the improved living and business environment. 
Only the Urban-Rural Water Supply component involves impacts on minority villages. These are 
three Tibetan villages in Shihuiyao Xiang (Shiguasi, Shihuiyao, and Yima) with a total minority 
population of 370 accounting for 85.4%, 34.4%, and 40.7% of the total population in these villages 
respectively. The remaining minority population involved in the project area lives in a scattered 
manner in Gaodian, Gaomiao, Hongshui, Nianbo, and Yurun towns in Ledu District, and Ping’an, 
Sanhe, and Xiaoxia towns in Ping’an District. Generally, they will not be adversely impacted but 
will be direct or indirect project beneficiaries. 
108. 
An ethnic minority development plan (EMDP) has been prepared to facilitate the inclusion 
of ethnic minority people in all project activities.26 The EMDP also includes measures to ensure 
that their  customs  and  beliefs  will  be  respected  throughout  project  construction and  operation. 
Key issues addressed in the EMDP ensure (i) that affected ethnic minority people are effectively 
involved  in  planning,  implementation,  and  monitoring  of  the  project;  (ii)  that  impacts  and  risks 
potentially affecting ethnic minority people are mitigated; and (iii) that ethnic minority people will 
benefit  in  an  inclusive  and  culturally  appropriate  manner.  The  EMDP  includes  measures  to 
mitigate  potential  social  risks  and  to  enhance  project  benefits,  particularly  for  women  and  the 
poor. The project will support (i) the targets set for the contractors with respect to the employment 
of ethnic minorities (15%), including  the poor; (ii) measures to facilitate the effective inclusion of 
ethnic  minorities (50%)  in  project  activities  through the  public  participation  and  awareness,  by 
removing potential cultural barriers to such participation; and (iii) measures to reduce the risk of 
unintentional offence being caused to ethnic minority communities during project construction and 
operation. Implementation and monitoring of the EMDP is included in the loan assurances and 
design and monitoring framework. The plan also includes enhancement measures, which will be 
integrated into HMG ethnic minority development program, and financed by HMG for the ethnic 
minorities to increase their environmental awareness and skills. 
109. 
The actions to be implemented under the EMDP are for the most part to be included as 
part  of  the  project’s  administrative  budget.  Where  local  government  agencies  collaborate  with 
actions in the EMDP, the local government administrative budgets will cover the costs of local 
government  staffing  and  other  related  costs.  Each  PIU  will  nominate  at  least  one  person 
responsible for overseeing the implementation of the EMDP, the social and gender action plan, 
and  to  coordinate  the  social  monitoring.  The  ethnic  and  religious  affairs,  as  well  civil  affairs 
bureaus  in  each  district  will  provide  support  as  necessary,  as  will  the  community  offices,  the 
district  centers  for  disease  control,  and  the  labor  bureaus.  An  external  monitoring  agency  to 
provide  independent  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  the  EMDP  has  been  included  in  the  overall 
project budget. 
110.  Prior to the commencement  of any component, the HPMO will ensure that briefings on 
ADB’s policies with respect to ethnic minorities, and on the EMDP, are provided both for their own 
members  and  the  PIUs.  The  ethnic  and  religious  affairs  bureaus  will  assist  in  these  briefings. 
Contractors,  their  supervisors,  and  workers  will  also  be  required  to  undergo  briefings  on  local 
ethnic minority customs and beliefs, and to ensure that no  offense to ethnic minority beliefs or 
26 Ethnic Minority Development Plan is accessible from the list of linked documents in the RRP, Appendix 2. 
62 
customs  occurs  during  construction.  The  national  social  development  specialist  in  the  project 
implementation  consulting  services  will  support  EMDP  implementation  and  monitoring.  The 
EMDP endorsed by the government has been disclosed on to ethnic minority people targeted by 
the project and uploaded on the ADB website. Detailed monitoring and reporting arrangements 
are included in the Section IX.B and the project agreement. 
VIII. 
GENDER AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS 
 A poverty and social assessment (PSA) was undertaken during the project preparation 
111. 
phase in accordance with ADB guidelines on gender and social dimensions. The PSA included a 
review  of  secondary  data,  a  household  survey,  focus  group  discussions  and  key  informant 
interviews.  The  PSA  assisted  in  the  design  of  the  various  subcomponents  to  ensure  they  are 
social inclusive and implemented with a high degree of community participation, especially for the 
barren hills greening, the wetland rehabilitation and the solid waste management.  
112. 
The  project  will  promote  the  sustainable  social  and  environmental  urban  and  rural 
development  of  Haidong.  The  project  will  also  have  public  awareness  campaigns  to  promote 
environmental  protection  and  generate  part-time  and full-time  employment  during  construction 
and operation, particularly for women and the poor. Based on the PSA, a social and gender action 
pan (SGAP) has been formulated and agreed by the Haidong PMO and implementing agencies. 
These actions will be implemented, progress will be monitored, and achievement of results will 
be  measured  and  reported.  The  following  sections  provide  some  further  guidance  for  the 
implementing agencies. 
A. 
Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy 
113. 
Haidong  is  a  prefecture-level  city  in  Qinghai,  which  governs  two  districts  and  four 
autonomous counties, with a land area of 13,200 square kilometers (km2), and a total population 
of  1.7  million.  In  2015,  Haidong  had  a  poor  population  of  175,800,  accounting  for  33.8%  of 
provincial  poor  population.  The  project  area  covers  Ping’an  and  Ledu  districts—nine  towns  or 
townships—over 180 urban communities and villages. Ping’an and Ledu districts are both state-
level key counties for development-oriented poverty reduction. In 2015, these districts had 44 and 
141 poor villages; and a poor population of 7,500 and 30,000, respectively. The project design 
includes a number of non-structural measures to support and ensure the sustainability of the new 
infrastructure  for  environmental  protection,  flood  management,  wastewater  management  and 
solid waste management, including (i) improvements to the MSW collection and transport system; 
(ii) creation of job opportunities for the poor, women, and ethnic minorities; (iii) strengthened public 
participation  and  information  disclosure  about  project,  resettlement  policies  and  plans, 
environment assessment and EMP, other social impacts and plans (i.e., EMDP and SGAP), and 
project implementation plan; (iv) public awareness education programs related to water saving, 
environment and forest protection, and flood risk management; (v) establishment of project-level 
grievance redress mechanisms; and (vi) establishing six pilot community environment supervision 
education teams (CEST) to conduct consultation, education, and management. 
The project will directly benefit 217,000 people in 180 villages of nine townships within 
114. 
the  two  districts,  including  an  urban  population  of  152,000,  or  70%,  and  a  rural  population  of 
65,000 or 30%. The project will create 135 skilled and 404 unskilled employment opportunities 
during the project construction phase, including a target for about 30% employment for women 
and  15% for the  poor  and  ethnic minorities. It  will  generate  162  skilled  and  331  unskilled  jobs 
(cleaners,  landscaping,  maintenance  workers,  etc.)  during  the  project  operation  phase.  The 
63 
HPMO  and  PIUs  have  assured  that  employment  priorities  will  be  given  to  vulnerable  groups, 
including women, the poor, and ethnic minorities.  
115. 
Design features. The project design directly responds to issues raised by the poverty 
and social analysis, related to basic urban infrastructure. Key design features include (i) setting 
employment targets for women, ethnic minorities, and the poor in construction and operations; (ii) 
strengthening public participation and consultation in decision-making related to public hearings 
for water supply and solid waste  management; (iii) targeting beneficiary ethnic minority people 
through public awareness and education campaign and skills enhancement programs funded by 
the local government; and (iv) more focus on providing public education and pilot programs on 
water saving, solid waste recycle,27 and forest management with up to 50% female participation. 
In  addition,  it  ensures  (i)  protection  of  labor  that  will  be  employed  on  project  works,  and  (ii) 
mitigation of communicable diseases including HIV and prevention of drug and human trafficking. 
The  EMDP  and  SGAP  outlined  actions  to  ensure  mitigation  of  adverse  impacts  and  increase 
positive impacts of the project. Implementation and monitoring of SGAP is included in the loan 
assurances. 
B. 
Social and Gender Development Action Plan 
The SGAP has been prepared for the project.28 It sets out activities (i) for the mitigation 
116. 
of  adverse  impacts  and risks  identified  in  the  course  of  the  poverty  and  social  analysis  of  the 
project, and (ii) to help maximize the benefits to be derived from the project.  Actions include (i) 
targets for employment of local labor, women, the poor and ethnic minorities during construction 
and operation; (ii) public awareness program on construction safety and labor law; (iii) measures 
to  reduce  potential  risks,  such  as,  communicable  diseases  including  HIV,  sexual  harassment, 
drugs  and  human  trafficking,  and  waterborne  health  problems;  (iv)  public  participation  and 
education in water saving, solid waste recycle, and forest management; and (v) public hearing for 
water supply and solid waste management. SGAP implementation will be monitored through the 
project  performance  management  system,  project  progress  reports,  and  ADB  supervision 
missions. 
117. 
The project is categorized by ADB as effective gender mainstreaming (EGM). The project 
will have significant benefits for women to reduce the energy, time, and effort spent by women on 
these  activities,  allowing  them  greater  participation  in  income-generating  activities,  family 
entertainment,  or  leisure.  Women  strongly  support  the  project  across  all  subcomponents,  and 
they perceive that the project will improve their quality of life and create employment and income 
opportunities for them. The SGAP will help to ensure (i) increased women’s participation in the 
project, including a target for at least 30% employment for women; (ii) participation and gender 
sensitive trainings on water saving, solid waste recycle, and forest management with up to 50% 
female participation; (iii) participation in capacity building activities; and (iv) appropriate gender 
targets, indicators and sex-disaggregated data for project monitoring and evaluation. The social, 
gender,  and  community  participation  consultants  (international,  2  person-months;  national,  12 
person-months)  will  be  provided  under  the  capacity  development  component  to  ensure  the 
effective  implementation  of  the  SGAP.  A  loan  assurance  for  implementation  of  the  SGAP  has 
been included. 
27 Women’s  active  participation  in  water  and  sanitation  is  essential  because  of  their  key  roles  in  the  provision  and 
maintenance  of  water,  sanitation  and  hygiene  at  the  household  level.  Thus,  during  the  public  awareness  and 
education program’s implementation gender and the particular needs and interests of women will be integrated into 
the training materials. 
28 A combined SGAP has been prepared for this project and is presented in the PAM and assurances. 
64 
118.  To address the risk of spread of HIV/AIDS, the project requires (i) inclusion of clauses on 
HIV  and  other  communicable  disease  into  contract  bidding  documents;  (ii)  conduct  of  public 
health and HIV prevention education to the civil works contractors; (iii) establishment of health 
measures  for  construction  workers  (e.g.,  setting  up  a  temporary  infirmary,  using  local  medical 
resources); and (iv) conduct of diverse publicity activities on HIV/AIDS (e.g., brochures, posters 
and picture albums). 
C. 
Other Social Aspects 
119.  As per the loan assurances, construction workers hired from the local communities will be 
trained on sanitation knowledge campaigns and training, and capacity building will be undertaken 
to protect their legal labor rights during construction or operations. 
120.  Labor issues. Core labor standards will be complied with based on national laws. Civil 
works  contracts  will  stipulate  priorities  to  (i)  employ  local  people  for  works,  (ii)  ensure  equal 
opportunities for women and men, (iii) pay equal wages for work of equal value, (iv) pay women’s 
wages directly to them, (v) not employ children or forced labor, and (vi) ensure that all contracted 
labor have written contracts. Specific targets for employment have been included in the SGAP. 
HPMO  is  responsible  for  the  implementation  of  the  SGAP.  HPMO  will  monitor  contractors’ 
compliance with these project assurances in conjunction with the Human Resources and Social 
Security Bureau, and Civil Affairs Bureau. 
121.  Under  the  project  management  consulting  services,  a  social,  gender,  and  community 
participation specialists will be engaged to support HPMO to implement the EMDP, SGAP, and 
other social aspects. They will be monitored internally and reported to ADB via quarterly progress 
reports.

progress of subproject implementation, (ii) financial progress, (iii) improvement the of ecological 
condition and flood control facility along the Huangshui River, (iv) improvement in urban and rural 
environmental service infrastructure in Ledu and Ping’an districts, (v) improvement of catchment 
soil  erosion,  (vi)  results  of  capacity  development  program  (vii)  progress  on  safeguard 
implementation, and (viii) social and poverty development. The PMO will assign staff, or contract 
consultants, to collect baseline and progress data at the requisite time intervals to be used in the 
PPMS. The PMO will be responsible for analyzing and consolidating reported data, and reporting 
outcomes to ADB through semiannual progress reports. 
2. 
Compliance Monitoring 
124.  During project implementation, ADB and the PMO will closely monitor the compliance of 
all  the  covenants  under  the  project  and  will  take  necessary  remedial  actions  for  any 
noncompliance. The compliance  status  will  be  reported  in the quarterly progress report  by the 
PMO and will be reviewed during project review missions. 
3. 
Legal Covenants 
125.  HMG shall ensure that in the event of (i) any change in ownership or control of the project 
facilities;  or  (ii)  any  sale,  transfer,  or  assignment  of  the  shares  of  project  implementation  units 
(PIUs) is anticipated, HMG will consult with ADB at least 6 months prior to the implementation of 
such  change.  HMG  shall  cause PIUs  to further ensure  that  such  changes  are  carried  out  in a 
lawful and transparent manner. 
4. 
Financial Covenants 
126.  Counterpart  funding.  HMG  shall  provide  the  details  of  the  sources  of  the  counterpart 
funding as well as provide corresponding commitment letters. The total cost includes physical and

contractors; (iii) external environment monitoring, to be conducted by the Haidong environmental 
monitoring  station  (EMS,  contracted  by  the  implementing  agencies);  (iv)  EMP  compliance 
monitoring during project implementation and the first year of project operation (or up to the date 
as further to be agreed with the ADB mission), to be conducted by the PMO environment specialist 
and LIEC; and (v) regular monitoring by operation and maintenance units during operation of the 
project facilities under their responsibility. Monitoring and reporting arrangements defined for this 
project are described below. 
130.  Assessment of project readiness. Before construction, the LIEC and PMO environment 
specialist will assess project readiness in terms of environmental management based on a set of 
indicators defined in the EMP and report it to the ADB and PMO. This assessment resettlement 
plan  demonstrate  that  environmental  commitments  are  being  carried  out  and  environmental 
management  systems  are  in  place  before  construction  starts,  or  suggest  corrective  actions  to 
ensure that all requirements are met. 
131. 
Internal  monitoring  and  supervision  and  reporting  by  construction  supervision 
companies.  During  construction, the  CSCs  and  contractors  will  be  responsible for  conducting 
internal environmental monitoring in accordance with the monitoring plan. Supervision results will 
be reported through the CSC reports to the implementing agencies. 
132.  Environmental  management  plan  implementation  compliance  monitoring  and 
progress reporting. The LIEC and PMO environment specialist will review project progress and 
compliance with the EMP based on field visits and the review of the environmental monitoring

133.  External  monitoring  by  Haidong  environmental  monitoring  station.  The 
implementing  agencies will  contract  the  Haidong  EMS  to  conduct  environmental  monitoring  in 
accordance with the monitoring program. A detailed cost estimate will be provided by the EMS 
prior to implementation. Monitoring will be conducted during construction and operation period, 
until a project completion report (PCR) is issued. Semiannual monitoring reports will be prepared 
by the EMS and submitted to PMO and the implementing agencies. 
134.  Project completion environmental audits. Upon completion, environmental acceptance 
monitoring and audit reports shall be (i) prepared by a licensed environmental monitoring institute 
in accordance with the PRC’s Guidelines on Project Completion Environmental Audit (2001) for 
all  components  that  required  an  environmental  impact  assessments  (EIA)  or  tabular  EIA,  (ii) 
reviewed for approval by the environmental authorities, and (iii) reported to Asian Development

finalized within 3 months after each subproject completion, or no later than 1 year with permission 
of the local environment protection bureaus. 
73 
b)  
Land Acquisition and Resettlement 
135. 
Internal and external monitoring of resettlement plan implementation will be conducted. 
The  Haidong  project  management  office  (HPMO)  will  submit  an  internal  monitoring  report 
quarterly to ADB. Furthermore, monitoring methodologies are specified in the resettlement plan. 
A  detailed  plan  for  both  internal  and  external  monitoring  and  evaluation  is  included  in  the 
resettlement  plan.  The  PPMS  will  include  indicators  on  resettlement  plan  monitoring  and  the 
required  frequencies.  The  HPMO  will  prepare  and  submit  a  resettlement  completion  report  to 
ADB. 
136.  HPMO will employ an external resettlement monitoring institute or firm acceptable to ADB 
to conduct independent external monitoring and reporting. The external monitoring agency will 
prepare a baseline study prior to commencement of land acquisition, and then conduct external 
monitoring and evaluation of resettlement plan implementation. Semiannual external monitoring 
reports  will  be  prepared  and  submitted  to  ADB  during  resettlement  plan  implementation,  and 
annual evaluation reports will be forwarded directly to both the PMO and ADB for 2 years after 
conclusion of resettlement plan implementation. 
c) 
Ethnic Minority Development Plan 
Internal and external monitoring of the ethnic minority development plan (EMDP) will be 
137. 
conducted.  Monitoring  and  reporting  methodologies  are  specified  in  the  EMDP.  Each 
implementing agency will carry out internal supervision and monitoring to ensure compliance with 
the provisions of the EMDP. HPMO will employ an external resettlement monitoring institute or 
firm  to  conduct  the  EMDP  external  monitoring.  Semiannual  external  monitoring  reports  will  be 
forwarded directly to the PMO and ADB until the project completion. The HPMO will prepare and 
submit an EMDP completion report to ADB. 
7. 
Social and Gender Action Plan  Monitoring 
138.  The PPMS will have the monitoring of the social and gender action plan (SGAP). Clear 
targets and indicators have been established and some indicators, such as those on employment, 
are also captured in the design and monitoring framework. The international social development 
consultant  will  assist  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies  set  up  effective  monitoring 
systems, and work with the focal points in the executing and implementing agencies to ensure 
implementation  of  the  SGAP.  The  SGAP  will  be  monitored  semiannually  and  reported  via  the 
quarterly project progress reports and during ADB review missions.30 
C. 
Evaluation 
In addition to regular monitoring, ADB and HMG will jointly review project performance at 
139. 
least once a year. The review will assess implementation performance and achievement of project 
outcomes  and  outputs,  assess  financial  progress,  identify  issues  and  constraints  affecting 
implementation,  and  work  out  a  time-bound  action  plan  for  resolution.  ADB  and  HMG  will 
undertake a midterm review to assess implementation status and take appropriate measures—
including  modification  of  scope  and  implementation  arrangements,  and  reallocation  of  loan 
proceeds, as appropriate—to achieve the project impact and outcome.  
30 The social and resettlement consultant engaged will focus on the progress of the social and gender action plan with 
the project’s progress report.  
74 
D. 
Reporting 
140.  Environmental  safeguards  reporting.  Environmental  monitoring  and 
inspection 
activities  and  findings  shall  be  documented  for  purposes  of  reporting,  recording,  verifying, 
referring  on,  and  evaluating the  environmental  performance  of the  project. The  documentation 
shall  also  be  used  as  basis  in  correcting  and  enhancing  further  environmental  mitigation  and

E. 
Stakeholder Communication Strategy 
143.  Relevant project information, including implementation progress, will be disclosed in the 
ADB  website  and  at  the  PMO.  This  will  include  the  design  and  monitoring  framework, 
environmental assessment, and the EMP. Stakeholder workshops will be held throughout project 
implementation  to  encourage  key  stakeholders,  particularly  residents  in  project  areas,  to 
participate in achieving the project benefits and to make sure all stakeholders, including women, 
poor, and other vulnerable groups benefit from the project. 
144. 
A  stakeholder  communication  strategy  has  been  prepared  to  ensure  inclusiveness, 
transparency, and meaningful participation of concerned stakeholders for the project. It provides 
an  agreed  communication  platform  for  key  stakeholders,  particularly  between  the  project’s 
affected groups and the executing and implementing agencies; and ensures that the stakeholders’ 
views and interests are fully integrated into the project design, implementation, and operation.31 
Specifically,  the  stakeholder  communication  strategy  could  help  in  ensuring  a  regular  flow  of 
reliable project information and inclusion of vulnerable groups in the distribution of project benefits 
during project implementation and operation. The communication strategy matrix outlines and/or 
identifies  key  messages,  means  of  communication,  and  timeline  of  delivery  for  various 
stakeholders during the project cycle.  
145.  A consultation and participation plan (social and gender action plan, pages  61–62) has 
been prepared for the concerned stakeholders within the project areas to ensure social inclusion 
(SPS).  The  purpose  of  this  plan  is  to  engage  the  stakeholders  in  meaningful  consultation  and 
decision-making  process;  inform  them  about  the  project  and  consult  them  on  various  issues 
relevant to the project/subcomponents and activities during project design and implementation. 
Consultation and participation serve venue for the key stakeholders (i.e., government agencies, 
project  beneficiaries,  women,  etc.)  to  (i)  be  informed  about  the  project;  (ii)  clarify  and  express 
feedback, issues, concerns, and suggestion; (iii) learn how they will be benefited by the projects; 
and  (iv)  participate  in  decision-making  and  take  action  and/or  be  involved  during  the  design, 
project implementation, and operation and/or maintenance stages. 
146.  Environment. Meaningful consultation to safeguard the environment and local residents 
will  continue  throughout  construction  and  operation  phases.  The  PMO  and  the  implementing 
agencies will be responsible for organizing the public consultations with the support of the loan 
implementation  environmental  consultant  (LIEC).  Civil  works  contractors  will  be  required  to 
frequently  communicate  and  consult  with  the  communities  in  the  project  area  of  influence, 
especially those near the project areas. Consultation will focus on public complaints about public 
nuisances from construction and operation activities, such as water quality, noise, asphalt fume 
nuisance, dust, odor, and traffic disturbance.

 Ethnic minority, and social and gender action plan. Consultations with communities 
have  taken  place  and  will  continue  at  different  points  in  the  implementation  of  the  EMDP  and 
SGAP to inform people about the component or specific activities, but also to enable people in 
the  community to  ask questions, make  suggestions,  state  preferences, and express  concerns. 
Special  attention  will  be  paid  to  the  participation  of  women,  ethnic  minorities,  and  any  other 
vulnerable groups, such as the poor. The HPMO and implementing agencies has disclosed the 
EMDP in the offices as well as the community offices and to ethnic minority beneficiaries in the 
Chinese language. 
148.  Public awareness and education program on water saving, solid waste recycle, and forest 
management will be conducted as part of the project components, and actions to enhance the 
involvement  of  women  is  included  in the  SGAP.  Public  hearings  will  be held for  any  proposed 
adjustments in water supply and solid waste tariff attended with adequate representation of poor, 
women, and ethnic minorities. 
149.  Public disclosure. Public disclosure of all project documents will be undertaken through 
HPMO  and  on  the  ADB  website,  including  the  project  data  sheet,  design  and  monitoring 
framework,  initial  environmental  examination, resettlement  plan,  EMDP,  SGAP,  and the  report 
and  recommendations  of  the  President.  Disclosure  of  external  resettlement,  social,  and 
environmental monitoring reports will be undertaken during project implementation. 
X. ANTICORRUPTION POLICY 
150.  ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any violations of the 
Anticorruption  Policy  relating  to  the  project. 32  All  contracts  financed  by  ADB  shall  include 
provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the 
executing agency and all project contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers. 
Individuals and/or entities on ADB’s anticorruption debarment list are ineligible to participate in 
ADB-financed activity and may not be awarded any contracts under the project.33

151.  To support these efforts, relevant provisions are included in the loan agreement and the 
bidding documents for the project. 
XI.ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISM 
152.  People  who  are,  or may  in the future  be,  adversely  affected  by the  project  may  submit 
complaints  to  ADB’s  Accountability  Mechanism.  The  Accountability  Mechanism  provides  an 
independent forum and process whereby people adversely affected by ADB-assisted projects can 
voice,  and  seek  a  resolution  of  their  problems,  as  well  as  report  alleged  violations  of  ADB’s 
operational  policies  and  procedures.  Before  submitting  a  complaint  to  the  Accountability 
Mechanism, affected persons should make a good faith effort to solve their problems by working 
with  the  concerned  ADB  operations  department.  Only  after  doing  that,  and  if  they  are  still 
dissatisfied, should they approach the Accountability Mechanism.34
