Project Administration Manual’s Purpose and Process 
1.  The  project  administration  manual  (PAM)  describes  the  essential  administrative  and  management 
requirements to implement the project on time, within budget, and in accordance with Government of 
Indonesia  (Government)  and  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  policies  and  procedures.  The  PAM 
should include references to all available templates and instructions either through linkages to relevant 
URLs or directly incorporated in the PAM. 
The Office of the Secretary General (SG) of the Ministry of Public Works and Housing (MPWH) as the 
executing agency; the Directorate General of Water Resources (DGWR), the Directorate General of 
Human Settlements (DGHS), the Directorate General of Highways (DGH), and the Directorate General 
of  Infrastructure  Financing  (DGIF)  as  implementing  agencies,  are  wholly  responsible  for  the 
implementation of this ADB-financed project, as agreed jointly between the Government and ADB, and 
in  accordance  with  Government  and  ADB’s  policies  and  procedures.  ADB  staff  is  responsible  to 
support  implementation  including  compliance  by  SG,  DGWR,  DGHS,  DGH,  and  DGIF  with  their 
obligations  and  responsibilities  for  project  implementation  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  policies  and 
procedures. 
2.  At loan negotiations, the borrower and ADB shall agree to the PAM and ensure consistency with the 
loan agreement. Such agreement shall be reflected in the minutes of the loan negotiations. In the event 
of any discrepancy or contradiction between the PAM and the loan agreement, the provisions of the 
loan agreement shall prevail. 
3.  After  ADB  Board  approval  of  the  project's  report  and  recommendations  of  the  President  (RRP), 
changes in implementation arrangements are subject to agreement and approval pursuant to relevant 
Government and ADB’s administrative procedures (including the Project Administration Instructions of 
ADB) and upon such approval they will be subsequently incorporated in the PAM.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
Improving infrastructure is critical to stimulating inclusive growth in Indonesia. Inadequate 
1. 
infrastructure  has  hampered  growth  and  poverty  reduction  and  poses  significant  obstacles  to 
doing business in Indonesia. Poor road infrastructure contributes to logistics cost in Indonesia of 
24% of GDP. Food security is affected by poor irrigation infrastructure: since 2005, irrigated land 
with good infrastructure has declined from 78% to less than 50% today. Access to basic urban 
water and sanitation services lags far behind other middle-income countries. In 2014, just 80,7% 
of  the  urban  population  had  access  to  improved  water  sources,  while  61,06%  had  access  to 
improved sanitation facilities. Such gaps in basic infrastructure provision are the result of both low 
government infrastructure investment and under-utilization of the capital budget. 
The reform of fuel subsidies in January 2015 has enabled the government’s infrastructure 
2. 
budget to increase from Rp144.4 trillion in 2014 to Rp280.3 trillion in 2015 and to Rp302.6 trillion 
in 2016. The line-ministries are responsible for delivery of more than 50% of the government’s 
infrastructure  budget.1  The  increase  in  infrastructure  spending  has  been  accompanied  by 
institutional  reforms  to  enable  the  ministries  to  deliver  their  public  investment  programs  in  an 
accelerated  manner. In 2014–2015, the government  (i)  established a dedicated  office for  land 
acquisition  at  the  Ministry  of  Agrarian  and  Spatial  Planning/National  Land  Agency  (NLA),2  (ii) 
improved legal and technical frameworks on land acquisition, (iii) strengthened the procurement 
units of government agencies and rolled out a national e-procurement system (LKPP SPSE), (iv) 
increased the use of advance procurement and multi-year contracts for infrastructure projects, 
and (iv) set up a budget realization evaluation and monitoring team to address implementation 
constraints  at  the  central  and  subnational  levels.3  Starting  with  the  2015  budget,  the  budget 
allocations are approved at organization, function, and program levels and, once approved, can 
be immediately disbursed. 
The Ministry of Public Works and Housing (MPWH) leads the government’s effort to meet 
3. 
RPJMN,  2015–20194  basic  infrastructure  targets  to  build  3,650  kilometers  of  new  highways, 
improve the irrigation network covering 1 million hectares, build 49 dams, attain 100% access to 
drinking water, reduce slum areas to 0%, and achieve 100% access to improved sanitation, all by 
2019.5 During 2015–2019, the MPWH’s infrastructure program is estimated at Rp660 trillion or 
47% of the government’s infrastructure program. In 2015–2016, about 37% of the government’s 
infrastructure budget was allocated to the MPWH. 
Delivery of the MPWH’s infrastructure programs has been constrained by complex land 
4. 
acquisition processes, procurement delays, and inadequate preparation of infrastructure projects. 
With  the  implementation of  the new  land acquisition  law  and continuous  efforts  to strengthen 
public procurement systems6, it is now the latter that critically constraints the ministry’s ability to 
deliver infrastructure in a timely and good quality manner. Weak project preparation is largely due 
to  lack  of  resources  to  complete  the  required  assessments,  surveys,  master  plan,  feasibility 
1  The  line ministries  include  the ministries  of public  works  and  housing, transportation,  agriculture,  and  energy  and mineral 
resources. 
2 This office was one of institutional reforms initiated to implement the new land acquisition law (Law No. 2 of 2012). This law 
sets clear steps and timelines for land acquisition, including dispute resolution through courts, after which land can be acquired 
for public purposes.

studies, designs, and environmental and land acquisition clearances to make projects ready for 
implementation.  Addressing  the  project  preparation  issue  will  be,  therefore,  important  for  the 
MPWH to meet its ambitious infrastructure development targets. 
By incorporating these lessons learned, the proposed Accelerating Infrastructure Delivery 
5. 
through  Better  Engineering  Services  Project  (ESP)  has  been  designed  to  target  the  MPWH’s 
critical  constraints  by  (i)  enabling  financing  of  the  preparation  of  infrastructure  projects  as  a 
separate project; and (ii) strengthening MPWH systems to improve the quality and timeliness of 
the  preparation  of  master  plans,  feasibility  studies,  detailed  engineering  designs  (DEDs),  land 
acquisition and resettlement plans, environmental impact assessments, bidding documents, and 
construction  supervision.  The project  will  be  coordinated  with development  partners  to ensure 
complementarity. 
B. 
Impact and Outcome 
6. 
The ESP will help meet the infrastructure development objectives of MPWH’s Strategic 
Plan,  2015–2019  by  improving  the  quality  and  timeliness  of  the  delivery  of  the  SDP’s  public 
investment  program.  The  impact  will  be  the  attainment  of  the  infrastructure  objectives  of  the 
MPWH’s Strategic Plan, 2015–20197 and carried forward to MPWH’s Strategic Plan 2020-20248. 
The  outcome  will  be  strengthened  capacity  of  MPWH’s  DGH,  DGHS,  DGWR,  and  DGIF to 
efficiently design and implement MPWH’s public investment program. The expected outcome of 
the ESP will be achieved through implementation of two outputs described below. 
C. 
Outputs 
7. 
Output 1: Quality and timely start-up of infrastructure projects improved. This output 
will  support  the  preparation–based  on  new  technology  and  improved  design  standards9–of  (i) 
irrigation, flood management, bulk water, and dam projects of the MPWH’s Directorate General 
of Water Resources (DGWR), (ii) water supply and sanitation projects of the Directorate General 
of  Human  Settlements  (DGHS),  and  (iii)  national  road  projects  of  the  Directorate  General  of 
Highways  (DGH),  and  (iv)  public-private  partnership  projects  for  toll  roads  and  bridges  of 
Directorate  General  of  Infrastructure  Financing  (DGIF).  All infrastructure projects are from the 
MPWH’s Strategic Plan, 2015–20197 and carried forward to MPWH’s Strategic Plan, 2020-20248, and 
are to be mainly financed from the government budget.10 This output will support preparation of (i) 
master  plans  and  feasibility  studies;  (ii)  detailed  engineering  designs,  including  geotechnical, 
topographical and  other  surveys;  (iii)  final  business  cases  for  PPP  projects,  (iv) environmental 
impact assessments and land acquisition documents

9  In the road sector, these are improved design standards on pavement, drainage, geometric, grade-separated junction, 
and at-grade junction aspects. In the irrigation sector, the new technologies are related to the web-based integrated asset 
management information system with geospatial interface, high resolution aerial surveys for survey  of  irrigation  assets, 
satellite-based water accounting. The detailed engineering design guidelines of the irrigation sector will be also updated 
to incorporate climate change and water efficiency, among other issues. In the wastewater sector, in 2016 the MPWH is 
expected  to adopt  new  technical  guidance on  feasibility studies  and  new  design  standards for  waste  water  treatment 
system. 
10 The indicative list of projects to be prepared under the ESP is in Appendix 1 of the PAM. List of projects may change 
subject to agreement between the MPWH and ADB. Based on the request of the Government and in accordance with 
the  provisions  of  the  2016–2019  Country  Partnership  Strategy,  ADB  may  consider  financing  selected  ESP-prepared 
projects either through a results-based lending or a project loan modality. 
10 
as per government requirements; and (v) advance contracting for civil works. This output will also 
support technical assessment for selected DGH projects, and contract review for Toll Roads. 
8. 
Output 2: Capacity in public investment management strengthened. This output will 
support the DGWR, DGHS, and DGH of the MPWH in: (i) improving master planning and public 
investment management systems; (ii) on-the-job capacity development of project staff, especially 
at local level, in such areas as but not limited to design-and-build contracts, design standards, 
construction  supervision,  enforcement  of  civil  works  contractor  performance  via  technical  and 
financial  assessment  during  construction,  multi-year  contracting,  etc.;  (iii)  strengthening  of  the 
ministry’s  safeguards11 and procurement systems12, (iv) strengthening value engineering during 
preparation  of  infrastructure projects,  and  (v)  implementing the ESP,  including  monitoring  and 
evaluation of project preparation activities. 
9. 
Implementation  period.  The  project  is  expected  to be  implemented  from  1  December 
2016 to 29 April 202213. Most activities related to project preparations are planned to be completed 
by end of 2021.  
10. 
The  DGWR,  DGH,  DGHS,  and  DGIF  of  the  MPWH  (implementing  agencies  under  the 
ESP) will undertake (i) project preparation work for their infrastructure projects, and (ii) institutional 
and  capacity  strengthening  in  public  investment  management.  This  is  highlighted  in  Table  1 
below. The indicative list of projects along with their corresponding estimated project preparation 
cost  is  provided  in  Appendix  1.  The  list  of  ESP-supported  projects  may  change  based  the 
government priorities and agreement with the ADB.

Project Organization Structure 
12. 
Implementation arrangements are described below:19 
28 
19 Directorates may involve local Balais or Satkers (owners of infrastructure project budgets) during selection of project preparation consultants. If 
the infrastructure project is implemented at the local level, the relevant Balai or Staker will be the technical consultants’ counterpart during project 
preparation activities and review of outputs of technical consultants, in consultation with the relevant directorate of MPWH central office and as part 
of the joint PIU-Balai/Satker Project Team. 
29 
D. 
Implementation Procedures 
13. 
The MPWH’ Office of the Secretary General will be the executing agency. The DGWR, 
DGH, DGHS, and DGIF will be the implementing agencies. The MPWH will establish a steering 
committee to monitor the ESP’s overall implementation and ensure ESP supported projects are 
prioritized for implementation. A project coordination office (PCO) will be established at the Office 
of MPWH’s Secretary General to support the steering committee.20 The DGWR, DGH, DGHS, and 
DGIF will each establish (i) a project management office (PMO) headed by a project director and 
supported  by  administrative  staff,  and  (ii)  project  implementation  units  (PIUs)  within  their 
respective  sector  directorates  to  lead  selection  and  management  of  consultants  for  the 
preparation of infrastructure projects. The PIUs will submit regular reports to the respective PMO 
on the status of consultant selection and performance. The PMOs will consolidate the reports for 
their respective DGs and submit reports to the PCO for monitoring and consolidated reporting on 
the ESP as a whole. 
14. 
The PMOs will lead (i) the establishment of panels of consultants, in consultation with the 
PIUs  at  their  directorate  general,  and  (ii)  the  selection  of  project  management  consultants  to 
support the PMOs and PIUs with implementation of the ESP. The PIUs will lead selection (with 
relevant  Balai  or  Satker,  as  required)  of  the  consultants  from  the  panels  for  preparation  of 
infrastructure projects. The DGWR, DGH, DGHS, and DGIF will set up procurement committees 
for the purposes of selection of consultants recruited under the ESP. All consultant selection will be 
done electronically using the MPWH’s LPSE, with proper adjustments for the panel arrangement. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, panel arrangement will not apply for consultants to be recruited by 
DGIF. 
15. 
If  infrastructure  projects  prepared  under  the  ESP  are  going  to  be  implemented  at  the 
local/district level of DGWR, DGH, DGHS, and DGIF, then the concerned PIU will involve local 
Balai (for DGWR, DGH, DGHS) or Satker (for DGIF) to direct project preparation activities and 
review the outputs of the project preparation consultant firms. The concerned PIU and local Balai 
or  Satker  will  establish  a  Project  Team  (Tim  Direksi),  which  will  review  project  preparation 
consultant firms’ outputs and submit such outputs to PIU for approval and payment to the project 
preparation consultant firms. 
16. 
Indicative list of projects of DGWR, DGH, DGHS, and DGIF to be supported under the ESP 
is in Appendix 1. During the implementation of the ESP, the list of projects may be updated any 
time,  as  mutually  agreed  between  ADB  and  the  Government.21  The  updating  process  will  be 
guided by the ESP loan financing available for project preparation in each sub-sector of DGWR, 
DGH, DGHS, and DGIF indicated in Appendix 1A-1D. 
17. 
The  feasibility  studies  developed  under  the  ESP  will  normally  cover  such  aspects  as 
technical analysis and description, subproject rationale, scope and components, cost estimates 
and financing plan, implementation arrangements, risk and situation assessment, financial and 
economic analysis, and environmental, social and poverty impact assessment. 
Among criteria to define feasibility of the project and enable to proceed with further due 
18. 
diligence and then with government financing are: 
20 The PMO will be supported through cluster technical assistance on sustainable infrastructure assistance program 
(C-TA0013-INO). 
21 If DGWR, DGHS and DGH decide to source financing for implementation of a project from ADB, then environmental, 
social  safeguard  assessment  reports  and  environment  management  plan  (EMP),  and  land  acquisition  and 
resettlement plan (LARP) for such projects will need to reflect ADB safeguards requirements, as appropriate.

19. 
For projects on development of city-wide wastewater system, the following criteria are also 
used: 
•  Cities with sanitation services more than 75% 
•  Cities of high idle capacities of existing wastewater treatment plants and require 
assistance to optimize existing systems and to add sewerage networks 
•  Cities that need rehabilitation of existing wastewater treatment plants and expansion 
of services (new WWTP services), including offsite (centralized) as well as on site 
systems 
•  Cities which indicate strong commitments to participate 
•  Cities that need technical assistance to meet the readiness criteria 
31 
After the feasibility study that would cover the features highlighted above, the following 
20. 
steps will be normally undertaken: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
(v) 
(vi) 
(vii) 
Preparation  of  DED  that  will  take  into  account  climate  change,  future  land  use 
changes, eco-hydrology dimensions, and  other  relevant aspects  (such  as value 
analysis applicable at DED stage to minimize the cost while ensuring full function 
of the project);

(consultation,  valuation  of  compensation  objects,  compensation  payment),  and 
hand over of acquired land for civil works commencement/construction; 
(ix) 
(viii)  Complete  implementation  of  LARPs  and  provision  of  required  compensation  to 
project affected people before issuing instruction to proceed to contractors; 
Review and revision of the DED after the selection of the civil works contractor and 
completion by the latter of the field survey; and 
Construction,  including  technical  and  safeguard  supervision  and  monitoring; 
construction  will  need  to  comply  with  the  recently  issued  MPWH  regulation  on 
sustainable construction of infrastructure.22
(x) 
21. 
Prior to the consultants’ commencement of work on project preparation (e.g., feasibility 
study, and  DED),  the  relevant  PIU  of  MPWH  will  inform  the  consultants about any  issues  that 
need  to  be  taken  into  account  during  project  preparation  based  on  the  safeguards,  technical, 
fiduciary  and  other  requirements  related  to  the  funding  source  envisaged  for  the  eventual 
infrastructure project. 
22. 
Directorate  General  of  Infrastructure  Financing  has  been  added  as  an  Implementing 
Agencies  under  ESP.  Following  its  mandate,  DGIF  will  support  MPWH  in  accelerating 
infrastructure  delivery,  drive  innovation  through  use  of  PPP  modality  and  advance  the 
government’s agenda of expanding use of blended financing. DGIF will recruit the PPC for Road 
sector  in preparing Final Business Case for Toll Roads and Bridges projects. In implementing the 
project as an IA, DGIF will be supported by Project Management Consultant, including support to 
carry out the relevant capacity building programs.  
23. 
Based on the advice of the concerned PMO, the DGs will ensure timely budgeting for the 
infrastructure projects prepared under the ESP, either through synchronization with the budgeting 
process of APBN or with the Blue Book process in case Official Development Assistance (ODA) 
is to be sourced for implementation of the project. For example, the DGs will take proper action 
to ascertain availability of funding from APBN or ODA at the time of completion of the DED for the 
project. Upon consultation with PMOs, the PCO will submit regular reports to the ESP steering 
committee  on  the  status  of  budgeting  and  implementation  of  the  ESP-prepared  infrastructure 
projects. 
22 MPWH regulation no. 05/PRT/M/2015 on sustainable construction of infrastructure. Sustainable construction is an 
approach  to  implement  a  series  of  activities  to  construct  facilities  to  meet  the  economic,  social,  environment 
purposes for now and future. It required optimal utilization of resources at every stage of infrastructure construction, 
i.e.  reduce  the  use  of  resources,  reduce  pollution,  the  use  of  recycle  materials,  environmental  protection,  risk 
mitigation, safety and health, life cycle, quality oriented, techno-innovation, and institutional support. Sustainable 
construction  will  be  initiated  by  the  responsible  technical  unit  at  an  early  stage  of  construction.  To  support  the 
implementation  of  sustainable  construction,  the  Minister  established  a  committee  for  implementation  of  the 
sustainable construction regulation. This committee consists of organization units at echelon 1 level.

FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT 
A. 
Financial Management Assessment 
The financial management assessment was conducted to determine the robustness of the 
30. 
accounting, financial controls and internal audit arrangements, and the capability of the DGs to 
meet all the fiduciary requirements which are set out in the loan agreement, and other project 
documents.  The  assessment  also  reviewed  the  project  financial  arrangements  and  financial 
responsibilities,  as  well  as  the  perceived  financial  risks  and  risk  management  measures.  The 
assessment concludes that the overall project financial management risk is moderate. The key 
risks,  activities  to  mitigate  risks,  responsibilities  to  address  these  risks  and  a  timeline  are 
summarized in the table below:

A financial management assessment (FMA) was undertaken for DGIF as an additional IA. 
Based  on  the  FMA  that  was  conducted  in  accordance  with  the  ADB’s  Financial  Management 
Technical Guidance Note (May 2015), the overall financial management risk is assessed as low. 
To mitigate the anticipated risks due to lack of experience in managing an ADB financed project, 
ADB  will  provide  customized  training  to  nominated  DGIF  staff  on  financial  management  and 
disbursement procedures. Such nominated staff will assume overall financial accountability on 
the use of project funds. A financial management specialist to be hired through PMC will assist 
PIUs  in  managing  day-to-day  project  implementation,  including  in  handling  of  financial 
management  issues.  Moreover,  the  financial  management  consultant  embedded  in  the  PCO 
through TA 9778-INO: Innovative Infrastructure Financing, Infrastructure Planning, and Program 
Management Support will support DGIF as well three existing IAs on financial management issues 
as needed. 
32. 
Conclusion.  The  assessment  indicates  that,  as  a  whole,  the  government’s  prevailing 
39 
financial,  accounting,  auditing  rules  and  systems  meet  the  generally  acceptable  international 
accounting and auditing standards. The Government has adequate internal control systems and 
financial reporting arrangements. The EA has worked in the past with ADB and is implementing 
well,  the  on-going  ADB-funded  projects.  The  overall  performance  of  the  EA  in  implementing 
financial management of the on-going project is acceptable. The MPWH’s Directorates General 
of Water Resources, Highways, Human Settlements, and Infrastructure Financing have been in 
charge of implementing a number of World Bank and ADB funded projects. They have substantial 
and relevant experience in implementing externally financed subprojects and in managing ADB 
loan disbursements. 
33. 
The  TA  loan  and  nature  of  the  project  expenditures  (i.e.  no  civil  works  and  no  major 
procurement of goods), the provision of PMC support to all DGs involved in the ESP, and the 
relative strength of the country’s public financial management systems, suggest that overall the 
MPWH can be considered as capable of implementing the ESP, with the overall project financial 
management risk being assessed as moderate. 
B. 
Fund Flow/Disbursement Arrangements 
34. 
The  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  Loan  Disbursement 
Handbook  (2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time),25  and  detailed  arrangements  agreed  upon 
between  the  Government  and  ADB  in  the  ESP’s  project  administration  manual.  The  DGWR, 
DGHS,  DGH,  and  DGIF  involved  in  the  implementation  will  maintain  separate  accounts  and 
records  for  the  ESP.  Project  staff  will  avail  of the  ADB’s disbursement  training  to  help ensure 
efficient disbursement and fiduciary control.26 
35. 
The  ESP  will  have  four  (4)  budget  users:  the  DGWR,  DGH,  DGHS,  and  DGIF.  Each 
budget  holder  will  establish  a  project  management  office  (PMO),  which  will  be  headed  by  a 
commitment  officer  (PPK).27  The  PPK  at  PMOs  at  DGWR,  DGH,  DGHS,  and  DGIF  will  be 
responsible for procurement (i.e., selection of the project management consultants, selection of 
the panel of consultants, and procurement of goods when applicable) and managing the payment 
for all goods and consultant services procured under the ESP. The PPK at PIUs at directorates of 
DGWR,  DGH,  and  DGHS,  will  be  responsible  for  selection  of  consultants  from  the  panels,  in 
consultation with the relevant Satkers. Cost estimates by budget user, as per the Green Book of 
the government, are in Table 9 below:

Direct  payment  procedure.  The  ESP,  due  to  its  TA  loan  nature,  will  use  the  direct 
36. 
payment procedure of ADB. The payments to the consultants will be made directly by ADB, based 
on  the  payment  requests  of  the  DGWR,  DGH,  DGHS,  and  DGIF  (in  the  form  of  withdrawal 
applications along with the necessary supporting documents), submitted through the MOF. The 
Government will cover the tax share of the consultant contracts through payment to the consultants 
or through other allowed means in line with Indonesia’s taxation framework. 
37. 
Before the submission of the first withdrawal application request, the borrower will submit 
to ADB sufficient evidence of the authority of the persons who will sign the withdrawal applications 
on behalf of the borrower, together with the authenticated specimen signatures of each authorized 
person.  The  minimum  value  per  withdrawal  application  is  set  in  accordance  with  the  “Loan 
Disbursement  Handbook".  Individual  payments  below  this  amount  will  be  paid  by  the  IAs  and 
subsequently claimed to ADB through reimbursement. 
38. 
The PMOs, with assistance from the PIUs, will be responsible for preparing the annual 
contract  awards  and  disbursement  projections;  and  requesting  budgetary  allocations  for 
counterpart funds. The PMOs shall be responsible for preparing and submitting the withdrawal 
applications  to  ADB  through  MOF  for  payments  to  the  PMC  firms  and  to  other  consultants, 
including individual consultants, if any, engaged directly by them. The PIUs shall be responsible 
for preparing and submitting the withdrawal applications to ADB through MOF for payments to the 
PPC firms, TAC consultants and to other consultants, including  individual consultants, engaged 
directly  by  them.  The  PMOs  and  the  PIUs  shall  be  responsible  in  collecting  and  maintaining 
supporting documents for the project expenditures they have incurred. The PIUs shall provide all 
financial information and reports, but not limited to disbursements, financial accounting and all 
procurement  related  information  to  the  PMOs  (i.e.,  information  on  withdrawal  applications, 
financial reports, audits, bank account statements, etc., by the PMO). The PMOs shall consolidate 
the  financial  and  other project  related  information  at  DG  level.  The  PMOs  shall submit  regular 
financial  reports  to the PCO at  the Office of  the Secretary,  per  the  format and frequency to be 
agreed between the PCO and each PMOs. The PMC firms shall assist  the  PIUs  and  PMOs  in 
discharging all these duties and functions. 
Sample forms for withdrawal applications of loan proceeds can be downloaded from the 
39. 
ADB website.29 
C. 
Accounting Policies and Procedures 
40. 
In accordance with Minister of  Finance Decree No. 215/PMK/2016 (on the Government 
accounting system and financial reporting)30, the EA has an accounting system that allows for the 
proper recording of financial transactions, including the allocation of expenditures in accordance 
with the respective components, disbursement categories, and sources of funds. 
41. 
The PMOs at DGWR, DGH, DGHS, and DGIF will maintain, or cause to be maintained, 
separate books and records by funding source for all expenditures incurred on the project. The 
PMOs at DGWR, DGH, DGHS, and DGIF will prepare consolidated project financial statements 
in accordance with the government's accounting laws and regulations which are consistent with 
international accounting principles and practices.

incurred on the ESP. The PCO at SG will prepare consolidated project financial statements in 
accordance  with  the  government's  accounting  laws  and  regulations  which  are  consistent  with 
international accounting principles and practices. 
The PCO will cause the detailed consolidated project financial statements to be audited 
43. 
annually  by  an  independent  auditor  acceptable  to  the  ADB  based  on  standardized  TORs  on 
external audit of ADB-funded projects agreed upon between ADB and Audit Board of Indonesia 
(BPK) in 2014 (Appendix 8 of the PAM).31 The independent auditor will also review ESP records 
and financial reports at PMOs of DGWR, DGH, DGHS, and DGIF, as part of the annual audit of the 
ESP. The MPWH will allocate adequate budget to properly audit the ESP. The PCO will submit 
the audited project financial statements in English to ADB within six months of the end of the fiscal 
year. 
44. 
Per  the  TOR,  the  auditor  will  prepare  the  annual  audit  report  for  the  project  accounts, 
which  will  include  an  audit  management  letter  and  audit  opinions  which  cover  (i)  whether  the 
project  financial  statements  present a  true and  fair  view  or are presented  fairly,  in  all  material 
respects,  in  accordance  with  the  applicable  financial  reporting  framework;  (ii)  whether  loan 
proceeds were used only for the purposes of the project or not; and (iii) the level of compliance 
for each financial covenant contained in the legal agreements for the project. 
Compliance with financial reporting and auditing requirements will be monitored by review 
45. 
missions  and  during  normal  project  supervision,  and  followed  up  regularly  with  all  concerned, 
including the external auditor. 
The Government and the MPWH’s SG and DGs have been made aware of ADB’s policy on 
46. 
delayed submission, and the requirements for satisfactory and acceptable quality of the audited 
project  financial  statements.32ADB  reserves  the  right  to  require  a  change  in  the  auditor  (in a 
manner consistent with the constitution of the borrower), or for additional support to be provided 
to the auditor, if the audits required are not conducted in a manner satisfactory to ADB, or if the 
audits are substantially delayed. ADB reserves the right to verify the project's financial accounts 
to  confirm  that  the  share  of  ADB’s  financing  is  used  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  policies  and 
procedures. 
Public  disclosure  of  the  project  financial  statements,  including  the  audit  report  on  the 
47. 
project financial statements, will be guided by ADB’s Public Communications Policy (2011).33
 After 
review, ADB will disclose the project financial statements for the project and the opinion of the 
auditors on the financial statements within 30 days of the date of their receipt by posting them on 
ADB’s website. The audit management letter will not be disclosed. 
31  The  audit  will  follow  the  standardized  TORs  agreed  with  the  BPK  as  reflected  in  BPK’s  letter  to  ADB  dated  19  June  2014  (No. 
294/S/X/06/2014). The MOF’s no objection on the standardized TORs was communicated through their letter to ADB dated 18 July 
2014 (No. S–561/PU.2/2014). 
32 ADB Policy on delayed submission of audited project financial statements: When audited project financial statements are not received 
by the due date, ADB will write to the executing agency advising that (i) the audit documents are overdue; and (ii) if they are not received 
within the  next  six months,  requests  for  new contract awards  and disbursement such as new replenishment of  imprest accounts, 
processing of new reimbursement, and issuance of new commitment letters will not be processed. 
a.  When  audited  project  financial  statements  have  not  been  received  within  6  months  after  the  due  date,  ADB  will  withhold 
processing of requests for new contract awards and disbursement such as new replenishment of imprest accounts, processing 
of new reimbursement, and issuance of new commitment letters. ADB will (i) inform the executing agency of ADB’s actions; and 
(ii) advise that the loan may be suspended if the audit documents are not received within the next six months. 
b.  When audited project financial statements have not been received within 12 months after the due date, ADB may suspend 
the loan.

VI. 
PROCUREMENT AND CONSULTING SERVICES 
A. 
Advance Procurement 
All advance contracting will be undertaken in conformity with ADB’s Guidelines on the Use 
48. 
of Consultants (March 2013, as amended from time to time)34and ADB’s Procurement Guidelines 
(April 2015, as amended from time to time).35 The issuance of invitations to bid under advance 
contracting will be subject to ADB approval. The borrower and DGWR, DGH, and DGHS have 
been advised that approval of advance contracting does not commit ADB to finance the Project. 
ADB financing is subject to the government’s compliance of the relevant provisions of the loan 
agreement and ADB guidelines. The Government was also advised that ADB would not finance 
expenditures incurred by the government prior to loan effectiveness, even if advance contracting 
is approved by ADB. 
49. 
The following steps for the recruitment of consultants can be concluded in advance: (i) 
submission  to  ADB  for  review  and  approval  of  the  terms  of  reference,  cost  estimates  and 
shortlisting evaluation criteria, (ii) advertisement, (iii) shortlisting of consulting firms, (iv) issuance 
of the request for proposals, (v) evaluation of technical proposals, and (vi) evaluation of financial 
proposals  and  final  ranking.  The  DGWR,  DGH,  DGHS,  and  DGIF  will  advertise  all  consulting 
opportunities  in  Consulting  Services  Recruitment  (Notice  at  www.adb.org  and  on  the 
Government’s electronic procurement system (SPSE). 
50. 
To facilitate rapid start-up, the Government and ADB agreed that advance action would 
be undertaken for the (i) selection of panels of consultant firms for DGWR, DGH and DGHS (ii) 
selection  of  project  management  consultant  firms  to  support  DGWR,  DGH,  and  DGHS  with 
implementation of the ESP, and (iii) selection of consultant firm for the preparation of the Jragung 
multi-purpose dam project and technical assessment consultants. This is necessary to ensure (i) 
timely availability of the panels for selecting consultant firms for infrastructure project preparation 
for  DGWR,  DGH  and  DGHS,  and  technical  assessment  consultants  (ii)  project  management 
consultants are  mobilized  as  soon  as  the  loan  becomes  effective.  The  advance action  will  be 
subject to ADB Management approval after signing of the MOU/confirmation of Aide Memoire by 
MPWH. Prior to the initiation of advance procurement, the DGWR, DGH, and DGHS will establish 
the  PMOs  and  tender  committees  for  selection  of  panels  and  PMC  firms.  Also  DGWR  will 
establish a tender committee for the advance procurement of the preparation consultant of the 
Jragung multipurpose dam project. 
B. 
Procurement of Goods, Works and Consulting Services 
51. 
All procurement of goods (office equipment and furniture) will be undertaken in accordance 
with  ADB’s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  through  project 
management consultants.36For packages of $100,000 equivalent or less, shopping method may 
be used. 
52. 
All consultants will be recruited according to ADB’s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants 
(March 2013, as amended from time to time).37 The principles of the quality based selection (QBS) 
method will be followed for selection of panel of consultants on the basis of the ADB’s Expression 
34 Available at: http://www.adb.org/Documents/Guidelines/Consulting/Guidelines-Consultants.pdf 
35 Available at: http://www.adb.org/Documents/Guidelines/Procurement/Guidelines-Procurement.pdf 
36 The amount of $200,000 is allocated for equipment for each DG.

43 
of  Interest  form  specifically  adjusted  for  the  purposes  of  selection  of  firms  for  a  panel.  
Notwithstanding the foregoing, panel arrangement will not apply for consultants to be recruited by DGIF. The 
default method for selection of consultants, based on full technical proposal (FTP), shall be: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
(v) 
for selection of consultants from the panels for call-down assignments, either 90 (quality) 
and 10 (cost) based selection (QCBS), or the 100 (quality) and 0 (cost) based selection 
(FBS) as appropriate shall be used; 
for the selection of consultants for Jragung multi-purpose dam project, quality (90%) and 
cost (10%) based selection (QCBS) shall be used; 
for selection of technical assessment consultants (TAC), either quality (90%) and cost 
(10%) based selection (QCBS) or consultants’ qualifications selection (CQS) shall be 
used; 
for the selection of Final Business Case preparation consultants, quality (90%) and cost 
(10%) based selection (QCBS). 
for the selection of the project management consultant (PMC) firms and other approved 
selection packages as indicated in the procurement plan, quality (80%) and cost (20%) 
based selection (QCBS) shall be used; and 
(vi)  For  the  selection  of  contract  review  consultant,  quality  (90%)  and  cost  (10%)  based 
selection (QCBS). 
During the implementation of ESP, it may also become necessary for the PMOs and the 
53. 
PIUs to engage consultants, at short notice, to supplement the tasks of various consultants or to 
assist in monitoring various tasks and implementation of various components of ESP or to provide 
independent services/opinions or for peer review of various documents or as resource persons. 
Under  these  situations,  it  would  be  advisable  to  engage  individual  consultants  who  can  be 
selected and mobilized for the required services at a much shorter time. The PMOs and PIUs may 
prepare  the  position-based  TORs  and  select  the  individual  consultants  based  on  individual 
consultant selection procedure. ADB’s standard template for individual consultants shall be used 
to sign contracts with the above individual consultants. 
54. 
The firms (associations of firms) selected for the panel will sign indefinite delivery contracts 
with the PMO of the relevant DG, based on template agreed by ADB. The firms selected from the 
panels for  call-down assignments,  Final  Business  Case  preparations  under  DGIF,  Design  and 
Development of JAKI 2.0 under DGH and for Jragung multi-purpose dam project under DGWR 
will  normally  be  engaged  on  lump-sum  contracts38  based  on  ADB’s  template  for  lump-sum 
contracts or other type of contracts such as partial lump sum contract (similar to the contract already 
developed and used under ESP) or performance-based contracts pursuant to fit for the purpose 
basis. The project management consultant firms, Toll Roads Contract Review and Technical Audit 
Consultant and the TAC will be engaged on time- based contracts based on ADB’s template for 
time-based contracts. All the consultants engaged by MPWH will need to comply with the MPWH’s 
regulation on gratification39. 
55. 
The  process  of  recruitment  of  project  preparation  consulting  (PPC)  firms  under  panel 
arrangement  will  involve  two  stages:  Stage-1:  empanelment  of  PPC  firms  by  the  PMOs 
[empanelment stage], and Stage-2: selection of firms by the PIUs from the panel for preparation 
of specific public investment projects [call-down stage]. At the empanelment stage, indefinite 
38  When  deliverables,  timelines,  and  a  payment  schedule  of  the  call-down  assignment  can  be  clearly  defined,  the 
consultants will be engaged under lump sum contracts. Use of lump sum contracts will allow a more flexible use of 
strong national experts, who can be members of several firms’ teams at the same time. At the same time, lump sum 
contracts will ensure that the firm is fully accountable for its deliverables. Lump sum contracts will be considered for 
project  preparation  only.  Consultants for  construction  supervision  and  technical audit  during  construction  will  be 
engaged through time-based contracts.

delivery contracts (IDC)40 will be signed by the PMOs of the respective directorate generals with 
every empaneled firm (single firm or association of firms). Such PMOs shall be the ‘Client’ under 
the  IDCs  and  shall  monitor  the  panel  arrangements.  At  the  call-down  stage,  Assignment 
Contracts shall be signed between the PIUs of the respective directorate generals and the PPC 
firm selected from the panel for individual projects for project preparation activities. Such PIUs 
shall  be  the  ‘Client’ under the  Assignment  Contracts and  shall  monitor  the  project preparation 
activities,  with  the  assistance  from  the  Balai/Satkars.  The  PMOs  shall  play  an  oversight  role 
throughout the infrastructure project development stage. 
56. 
REOIs for selection of consultants under the ESP, including on the selection of the panels 
and for selection of the project management consultant firms, will be posted on ADB’s consulting 
services  recruitment  notice  (CSRN)  and  the  web-sites  of  LKPP’s  SPSE  and  INAPROC.  All 
expressions of interest and consultants’ technical and financial proposals will be received only at 
LKPP SPSE platform, with ADB having been granted the audit function to be able to review the 
submitted EOIs, RFPs, and their processing status. Each DG will get registered and will obtain 
authorized access to ADB’s CMS to post REOIs. The terms of reference for selection of project 
management consulting firm and for the panel of consultants41 for provision of consulting services, 
for each of the DG is enclosed in Appendix 2. 
57. 
At  the  call-down  stage,  the PIUs,  at their  discretion,  will  send  the  RFPs  to  either  all or 
selected number of panel members. Where the RFPs are proposed to be issued only to selected 
number of firms in the Panel, the following principles must be adhered to: (i) RFPs are sent to at 
least  1/3  of  panel  members,  (ii)  adequate  geographic  spread42 among  the  panel  members,  to 
which  the  RFPs  are  sent,  to  ensure  no  preference  is  given  to  any  particular  country,  (iii) 
performance of the panel members (responsiveness to RFPs, submission of quality RFPs, and 
satisfactory  performance  under  signed  contracts,  if  any),  (iv)  number  of  on-going  ESP 
assignments of the panel members not to affect the consultants’ work under on-going contracts 
and  (v)  any  other  matter,  that  in  the  opinion  of  the  project  management  office(PMO)/project 
implementation unit (PIU) issuing the RFP, raises concerns on the ability of a panel member to 
undertake work outlined in the RFP. Draft procedures in this regard are in Appendix 2.14.43 Prior 
to issuing to the panel members, the draft RFP and list of the to-be-invited panel members will be 
reviewed by ADB, as agreed with the Government. 
40  Indefinite  delivery  contracts  are  used  when  the  client  needs  to  have  quick  and  continuing  access  to  “on  call” 
specialized advisory services for a particular activity, the extent and timing of which cannot be defined in advance. 
In accordance with ADB’s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013), the consulting firms shall be pre-qualified 
and retained under indefinite delivery contracts for 3 years without any commitment. As and when the services of 
the consultants are required for infrastructure project preparation support, a consultant will be selected from the 
empanelled firms and a call-down assignment contract shall be signed with such firm. 
41  For the  selection  of  Panel,  the  evaluation criteria originally  included  in the  draft  REOI (please  refer to the  PAM 
finalized  during  loan  negotiations)  were  subsequently  modified.  Specific  changes  made  include:  (a)  changes  in 
assessment criteria for firm’s similar experience (col.4) to reduce the requirement of no. of assignments; (b) change 
in sub-marks for evaluation criteria no.2 to give more weightage for experience outside Indonesia for highways sector 
(applicable for DGH Panel); (c) changes in assessment criteria (col. 4) for assessment of key personnel (evaluation 
criteria no.3) and (iv) reducing qualifying marks from 70 to 50. These changes were made, as advised by ADB, to 
ensure that sufficient number of experienced firms are included in the Panel. These updated REOIs as issued via 
ADB CMS and SPSE are available with the PMOs. Subsequently, during the ADB’s inception mission, it was also 
agreed  between  ADB  and  MPWH  that  except  evaluation  criteria  under  col.2  and  maximum  marks  in  col.6, 
appropriate changes in other criteria (such as in col.3 to col.5) may be carried out by the PMO at the time of updating 
of Panel, depending upon the requirements, subject to prior approval of ADB. 
42  Geographic spread among panel members means that the panel shall have a balanced representation from regions 
consisting of Oceania (Australia-New Zealand), North America, Europe and the Asia Pacific region, in addition to 
the borrower country. 
43  These procedures were finalized by the PMOs, notified through SPSE for the information of the consultants and 
included as part of the REOIs and IDCs. These procedures were further updated during the ADB’s inception mission 
and the updated Attachment 2.14 is attached to the revised PAM (8 January 2018). 
45 
Under the contracts at the call-down stage, the project preparation consultant (PPC) firms 
58. 
will be normally paid on a lump sum basis, or other type of contract such as partial lump sum or 
performance-based  contract  pursuant  to  fit  for  the  purpose  basis.  The  total  fees  shall  be paid 
based on various defined milestones achieved. The detailed structure of the payment milestones, 
including the maximum timeframe for such release by the client, shall be prescribed in the RFP 
at  call-down  stage.  Payments  to  consultants  shall  be  made  in  accordance  with  ADB  Loan 
Disbursement Handbook (2012, as amended from time to time). The payment shall be released 
based  on  the  approval  of  the  Project  Team  and  the  concerned  PIU  (and  also  based  on  the 
confirmation of the relevant local office or Balai/Satker) about the deliverables/outputs submitted 
by the PPC firms. PIU shall accord this approval after ensuring that the outputs delivered by the 
consultants  / all other deliverables  conform  to  the  requirements of the  contract.  In  the  case of 
time-based contracts, the payments shall be made based on approval of time sheets and linked 
deliverables, if any, as per the procedure described above. The payment shall be certified and 
made within the lapsing time periods per milestone defined in the RFPs/Assignment Contracts for 
a  specific  assignment.  Payments  to  the  consultants  will  be  made  by  ADB,  upon  receipt  of  an 
endorsed direct payment request from the respective PIUs, through the MOF’s Treasury Office 
(KPPN). 
59. 
The project preparation firms will be paid upon approval of the deliverable (or time-sheet, 
as the case may be) by the concerned PIU or by end of a certain time period after submission of 
the complete deliverable to the concerned PIU, whichever is earlier. The lapsing time periods per 
milestone  will  be  defined  in  the  RFPs  of  the  project  specific  assignments.  This  is  to  increase 
certainty and attract a larger set of consultant firms to participate in the ESP. The consultants will 
be  paid  by  ADB,  upon  receipt  of  an  endorsed  direct  payment  request  from  the  PIU  of  the 
concerned DG, through the MOF’s Treasury Office (KPPN). 
In case of a significant delayed payment, the PPC firms will be able to communicate with 
60. 
the concerned PIU, with copy to PMO, SG and ADB. 
61.  While lump-sum contracts will be default type of contracts at call-down stage, the relevant 
PIU may decide for time-based or other types of contracts in accordance with ADB’s Guidelines 
on  the  Use  of  Consultants,  based  on  specifics  of  the  project  and/or  the  envisaged  consultant 
assignment. In all such cases, the PIUs will seek views of ADB prior to taking the decision on the 
type of contract. If time-based contracts are used, payments to the PPC shall be first endorsed 
by the concerned Project Team, and then approved by the relevant PIU, who shall then prepare 
withdrawal applications and submit to ADB through MOF for direct payments to the consultants. 
The submitted time-sheet shall be deemed approved by the Project Team and the PIU if the PPC 
firm does not receive an objection within 30 calendar days after submission of such time-sheet. 
62. 
The scope of project preparation assignments will be decided by the concerned PIU and 
may comprise a combination of areas. In the latter case the PIUs will ensure that the PPC firms 
are aware of the provisions of the ADB’s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants related to (i) conflict 
of interest [paras 1.10 and 1.11 of the guidelines], and (ii) unfair competitive advantage [para 1.12 
of the guidelines]. 
63. 
The Project Team will review–with support of the project management consultant firms– 
the submitted milestone deliverables of the project preparation consultants, such as master plans, 
pre-feasibility  and  feasibility  studies,  AMDAL,  LARAP,  DED,  final business case,  and bidding 
documents.44 Specifically, 
44 Inclusion of AMDAL, along with other deliverables highlighted in this paragraph, in the scope of work of the project 
preparation consultant firm does not represent a conflict of interest per section (b) of para 1.11 of ADB’s Guidelines 
on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). Specifically, it does not represent a conflict among 
consulting assignments as AMDAL and other deliverables would be in the scope of work of the same consulting 
contract, and AMDAL–carried out by government agencies as part of preparation of their infrastructure projects–is 
not an independent environmental assessment. 
46 
the Project Team will review and endorse (pre) feasibility study (before the project preparation 
consultants  proceed  with  DED)  and  the  environmental  and  social  safeguards  assessments 
prepared  by  the  project  preparation  consultants.  If  such  reviews  conclude  that  a  project  has 
insufficient  feasibility  or  highly  adverse  environmental  and  social  impact,  then  the  project 
preparation consultants will not proceed to the next relevant milestone and their contracts will be 
adjusted accordingly. 
64. 
A procurement risk assessment for the executing and implementing agencies has been 
completed  by  ADB.45  The  assessment  suggested  that  the  overall  risks  associated  with  the 
procurement  capacity  of  MPWH  are  manageable,  with  most  risk  criteria  rated  as  “low”  or 
“medium”. The legal and regulatory framework for public procurement is sound and the MPWH’s 
Directorates General are reasonably experienced in procurement of goods, works and consultant 
services  under  self-financed  and  foreign-assisted  projects.  In  fiduciary  issues.  DGH,  DGHS, 
DGWR, and DGIF will be comprehensively supported by the project management consulting firms 
engaged  (Output  2)  for  the  duration  of  the  ESP.  In  addition,  to  support  efficient  and  effective 
oversight and institutional coordination, the SG will be supported by the PCO Consultants. 
65. 
The  ESP’s  overall  procurement  classification  is  assessed  as  medium  risk.  The  ESP’s 
integrated benefits  and  impacts  are  expected  to outweigh  its  costs.  Major  risks and  mitigating 
measures  agreed  to  ensure  good  quality  and  timeliness  of  procurement  under  the  ESP  are

A procurement capacity assessment was undertaken for DGIF as an additional IA for this 
project. Based on the procurement risk assessment (PRA) which was conducted in accordance 
with  the  Guides  on  Assessing  Procurement  Risks  and  Determining  Project  Procurement 
Classification, the overall procurement classification was assessed as moderate. Given its recent 
establishment,  DGIF  staff  have  limited  capacity  and  lack  exposure  to  ADB  procedures  for 
consultant  selection.  To  help  DGIF  accelerate  consultant  selection  process,  ADB  will  provide 
customized training on consulting services procedures supplemented by procurement clinics as 
needed. A procurement specialist to be hired through PMC will assist PMO and PIUs in managing 
day-to-day procurement and contract administration activities. 
67. 
The LKPP’s  SPSE  has been  assessed by ADB  for  use under the  ESP  (Appendix 4.1). 
Overall, the assessment concludes that the LKPP’s SPSE can be used for the panel arrangement 
for recruitment of project preparation consultants. The SPSE has been also assessed for standard 
(non-panel) selection of consultant firms, such as PMC firms and the firm for the preparation of 
the Jragung multi-purpose dam project. LKPP, in coordination with ADB and MPWH/PUSDATIN, has 
made the required adjustments in the SPSE to cater to the consultant selection, in accordance with 
ADB’s guidelines. The system was jointly review by LKPP, ADB, and MPWH/PUSDATIN. ADB also 
conducted review of the adjustments to the national e-procurement system (SPSE) for conformity 
with the consultant selection requirements under the proposed ESP and issued no objection through 
letter dated 24 August 2016 for using the adjusted SPSE for the selection of consulting firms under 
the ESP. After the respective tender committees have been constituted, the SPSE platform shall 
be used for issuance of REOIs for selection of consultants for panel and PMC assignments. 
68. 
The SPSE system does not define the requirements for specific packages, only displays the 
information made available by the tender committee and allows registered bidders to download the 
bidding  document  and  upload  their  response  (one  or  two  envelop  as  specified  by  the  tender 
committee) and controls when a tender committee may open the responses. The SPSE will also 
manage  the  bidding  process  in  accordance  to  the  schedule  of  activities  defined  by  the  tender 
committee. The bidding requirements, any qualification requirements, validation and evaluation of 
the content of consultants’ responses will be defined by the tender committees that shall be guided 
by  ADB’s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.  Overall,  LKPP  SPSE  will  only  support  the 
consultant  selection  process  as  e-procurement  platform,  and  the  consultant  selection  will  follow 
ADB’s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. 
49 
The “SPSE User Guide” on the use of the LKPP’s SPSE for the selection of consultants 
69. 
under the ESP, including for the selection of firms for the panels, is in Appendix 4.2. The  REOIs 
and RFPs will be submitted electronically (through LKPP SPSE) per the requirements described 
in the REOIs and RFPs. 
70. 
The SPSE and the provisions in the EOIs and RFPs will have no restrictions on registration 
and  submission of  EOIs and  RFPs by  the  consultant firms. The  restrictions pertain, but  are  not 
limited to, to the need to (i) have a representative office in Indonesia, (ii) have a local partner, and 
(iii)  be  physically  present  at  the  government  agency  to  obtain  the  relevant  identification  and 
registration numbers necessary for submission of EOIs. Relevant registration and business permit 
requirements may be relevant at the stage of signing contract for a particular assignment. ADB and 
the MPWH will review such requirements and agree on their applicability under the ESP.46

Construction Services Representative from Indonesia Investment Coordinating Board (Izin Usaha Perwakilan Badan 
Usaha Jasa Kostruksi Asing; IPBUJKA). However, at the call-down stage, the panel members, to whom the RFP has 
been issued, will need to submit to the tender committee–along with their technical and financial proposals–either 
the IPBUJKA or an evidence that the panel member has initiated the process to obtain the IPUJKA. In any instance, 
the IPBUJKA must be obtained prior to signing of the contract at call-down stage.

basis.48
After the first year of implementation of the ESP ADB and the 
MPWH will jointly assess the status and performance of the

proceeding  with  contract  negotiations, the  DGs will  need  to 
submit  to  ADB  the  submission  3  form  on  results  of  the 
evaluation of financial proposals. Finally, before signing the 
contract,  the  DGs  will  need  to  submit  submission  4  form  to

ESP  are  presented  in  the  flowcharts  below.  The  ADB  and  MPWH  will  ensure  best  effort  to 
adhere to these timelines.  
73.  At  the  empanelment  and  call-down  stages,  as  well  as  during  conduct  of  conventional 
selection of consultant firms, the responses to the consultants’ queries will be provided, through 
SPSE, to all consultants participating in the selection within 3 calendar days upon receipt of the 
query.  The  PCO  consultants  and/or  the  PMC  firms  shall  support  the  PMOs  and  PIUs  in 
preparation of the responses. Wherever required, the PIUs and PMOs may seek ADB’s views on 
draft  responses  before  communicating  with  the  consultants. In  such  cases, ADB  will  provide 
views  on  the  draft  responses  within  1  business  day  upon  receipt  of  the  request  from  the 
concerned PIU and/or PMO. 
74. 
ADB loan will not finance expenditures for consulting services if the consultants have not 
been selected in accordance with the provisions of the PAM and ADB Guidelines on the Use of 
Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). If recruitment is not carried out as agreed, 
ADB will declare misprocurement. This will normally result in cancelation of the portion of the 
financing allocated to the services that have been misprocured. In appropriate cases, ADB may 
agree to re-issue the RFP after declaring misprocurement. ADB may, in addition, exercise other 
remedies provided for in the ESP's Loan Agreement. Even if a contract is awarded after obtaining 
a “no objection” from ADB, ADB reserves the right to declare misprocurement if it concludes that 
the “no objection” was issued on the basis of incomplete, inaccurate or misleading information, 
or that the terms and conditions of the contract had been substantially modified without ADB’s 
approval.

Consultant's Terms of Reference 
76.  Foreign  consultant  firms  will  be  encouraged  to  associate  with  qualified  national  firms  to 
complement their respective areas of expertise, strengthen the technical responsiveness of their 
proposals,  and  make  available  bigger  pools  of  experts,  and  provide  better  approaches  and 
methodologies. Such an association may be in the form of a joint venture53 or a sub-consultancy 
agreement  for  the  period  of  the  panel.  If  the  association  in  the  form  of  a  joint  venture,  the 
association  will  appoint  one of  the  firms  to  represent  the association;  all  members of the  joint 
venture shall sign the contract and shall be jointly and severally liable for the entire assignment. 
77.  Depending upon the project and the scope of services required, the requirement of various 
national and international consultants54 for various expertise will be prescribed in the RFP at the 
call-down stage. All the following specialists shall have experience of working in similar projects in 
Asia and the Pacific, preferably experience of working in similar projects in Indonesia, including 
possessing  country-specific  knowledge.  The  international  and  national  experts  having  country-
specific experience and knowledge of the sector and regulatory issues involved in Indonesia and 
the initiatives taken by the Government of Indonesia will be given higher preference 
78.  Due to their size, the detailed TORs of all consultants to be engaged under the ESP are 
presented in Appendix 2. 
53 The nationality of the joint venture (JV) for the purpose of shortlisting will be defined by the nationality of the firm representing the JV. 
54 Per ADB’s Guidelines on The Use of Consultants (2013), “‘International Consultant’ means any consulting firm established or incorporated 
in  any  ADB member  country,  including  the  borrower’s  country,  or  a  person  who  is  a  citizen of any  ADB member  country,  including the 
borrower’s country”; and “‘National Consultant’ means any consulting firm or individual from the borrower’s country that is established or 
incorporated and has a registered office in the borrower’s country, or a person who is a citizen of such country” (footnotes 5 and 6 on page 
2 of the guidelines. 
94 
A. 
Environmental Safeguards 
VII. 
SAFEGUARDS 
79.  The environmental safeguards classification for the ESP is confirmed as category C as there 
will  be  no  direct  financing  for  infrastructure  project  or  any  type  of  civil  works  that  may  pose 
environment  threat.  Therefore,  there  will  be  no  impact  on  environment  arising  from 
implementation of this TA loan funded project. 
B. 
Involuntary Resettlement Safeguards 
80.  The involuntary resettlement safeguards classification for the ESP is confirmed as category 
C as there will be no direct financing for infrastructure projects or any type of civil works. Therefore, 
there will be no resettlement impact arising from implementation of this TA loan funded project. 
C. 
Indigenous Peoples 
81.  The indigenous people classification for the ESP is confirmed as category C as there will 
be no impacts on indigenous people arising from implementation of this TA loan funded project. 
Indigenous people are not specifically targeted and the project neither affects the dignity, human 
rights, livelihood system or culture of indigenous peoples nor affects the territories or natural or 
cultural resources that indigenous peoples own, use, occupy, or claim as an ancestral domain or 
assets. 
D. 
Safeguards support through PMC firms 
82.  Social and environment safeguards consultants will be part of the PMC firms engaged by 
each PMO under the ESP. These safeguards consultants shall support the PIUs of the relevant 
DGs  to  prepare  the  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plans  (LARPs)  as  per  provisions  of  the 
Indonesian  land  acquisition  law  and  regulations,  in  consultation  with  relevant  provincial  and 
district land agencies, and project affected people.55 The LARP shall refer to the regional spatial 
planning and the development priority as stated in the Midterm Development Plan (RPJMN), the 
Strategic Plan, and the Working Plan of the MPWH. The LARP shall be prepared based on the 
feasibility study that may include (i) social economic survey; (ii) location feasibility; (iii) analysis of 
cost  and  development  benefit  to  the  area  and  community;  (iv)  estimated  land  value;  (v) 
environmental impacts and social impacts that may arise out of the land acquisition of land and 
construction;  (vi)  other  study  as  necessary.  Moreover,  the  LARP  preparation  will  ensure  that 
appropriate  measures  are  taken  to  mitigate  any  negative  social  impacts  including  special 
measures for land acquisition, compensation, and to ensure full implementation to improve the 
participation  of  women  and  other  disadvantaged  groups  as  beneficiaries  as  required  in  the 
government’s law and regulations or other applicable procedures. 
83.  The safeguards specialists of the PMC firms will also help DGs ensure gender consideration 
in planning and implementation of the land acquisition and resettlement is adequately addressed. 
The safeguard specialists of the PMC firms will help the PIUs to provide facilitation of obtaining 
relevant  permits  including  project  location  determination  issued  by  the  Governor  for  selected 
projects, environmental permit, and forestry permit. An Analisa Mengenai Dampak Lingkungan 
(AMDAL -Environmental Impact Assessment) or UKL/UPL study will be prepared for each project 
in accordance with government law and regulations. AMDAL/UKL-UPL will be the basis for the 
issuance of environment permits, forestry permits for projects located in the forestry areas, and 
other  required  permits.56  (Presidential  Regulation  No.  71/2012  or  any  changes  that  can  be 
amended from time to time) 
55 See Appendix 5 on the overview of Indonesia’s land acquisition framework 
56 See Appendix 5 on the overview of Indonesia’s land acquisition framework. 
95 
84.  The  safeguard  specialists  of  the  PMC  firms  will  support  the  DGs  to  implement  capacity 
building in safeguards. The capacity building is to ensure the environmental and social safeguards 
are  properly  prepared  and  implemented  as  per  applicable  laws,  regulations,  and  procedures. 
Capacity building will be provided in the forms of capacity building training on safeguards and 
transfer  of  assets,  improvement  of  regulation  or  procedure  for  environmental  and  social 
safeguards,  and  strengthening  safeguard  units,  task  force,  safeguards  focal  points  for 
coordination and monitoring. See Appendix 7 on the assessment of safeguards systems of DGH, 
DGHS, and DGWR and capacity building measures to be supported under the ESP. 
E. 
Prohibited Investment 
85.  Pursuant  to  ADB's  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  (SPS),58ADB  funds  may  not  be 
applied to the activities described on the ADB Prohibited Investment Activities List set forth at 
Appendix 5 of the SPS.

96 
VIII.  GENDER AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS 
86.  The ESP supports institutional strengthening and preparation of public investment projects. 
Hence, there is no direct adverse impact on gender inequality or a negative impact on women. 
Nevertheless,  the  ESP  will  ensure  gender  inequality  and  impact  on  women  will  be  suitably 
mainstreamed  in  the  scope  of  work  of  consultants  that  will  be  engaged  under  the  ESP  for 
preparation of MPWH’s infrastructure projects. 
87.  The direct beneficiaries of the ESP will be MPWH staff at central and local levels (in terms of 
capacity building, institutional strengthening, and know-how transfer) and the consultants that will 
be  engaged  under  the  ESP  for  project  preparation  (in  terms  of  income  generated  from  the 
contracts financed from the ESP). Indirect beneficiaries of the ESP will be contractors and private 
enterprises  that  will  benefit  from  construction  and  supply  contracts  arising  from  the  project 
preparation work done under the ESP. 
88.  The ESP will ultimately positively affect the consumers, employees, and the poor in general, 
as they suffer the most from lack of economic infrastructure. Enterprises will benefit from better 
competitiveness due to better infrastructure and reduced logistics costs. Consumers will gain from 
greater domestic competition because it will lower prices and improve services (e.g., in the tourism 
sector due to better connectivity). Employees will gain from easier access to work and increased 
income opportunities, including the construction and operation of infrastructure facilities  and  in 
better-paid jobs such as in manufacturing. The poor, especially in low-income regions, will benefit 
because improved connectivity allows them to participate in wealthier urban markets. 
89.  Overall, the ESP is pro-poor as it will directly support the government to achieve the RPJMN 
infrastructure  development goals  reflected  through  pro-poor  preparation as  well as  timely  and 
adequate delivery of  public  infrastructure  to  the beneficiaries.  Improved  infrastructure  will  help 
reduce the vulnerability of the poor or the likelihood that the near-poor will fall into poverty as a 
result of shocks, which remains an issue in Indonesia. 
90.  The labor and consumer good markets will be among the most important channels: (i) higher 
basic infrastructure investments will directly and indirectly create more decent and productive jobs 
in  tourism,  agriculture,  and  manufacturing;  and  (ii)  reduced  logistics  costs  will  lead  to  lower 
consumer  prices  and a better  variety of  products.  The growth of  sectors  such  as  tourism  and 
agriculture—which are labor intensive, linked to other economic sectors, and are geographically 
spread  across  Indonesia—will  reduce  poverty  and  improve  food  security  through  better  water 
delivery. 
91.  Under output 1 of the ESP, the adequate analysis of the gender, labor, HIV/AIDs, and other 
social risks will be mainstreamed in the TORs of the project preparation consultants that will  be 
financed under the ESP.59 The PIUs, in coordination with the PMOs, will be responsible to ensure 
that  relevant  sections  of  the  TORs  and  consultant  budgets  adequately  reflect  the  social  and 
gender aspects to be assesses and considered in project preparation. The PIUs will also ensure 
that project preparation consultants properly analyze and incorporate core labor standards  and 
health and environmental conditions at worker camps in relevant project documents. Under output 
2, social experts will be part of the project management consultant teams and will ensure on-the-
job capacity building to the staffs of the PIUs and Satkers on social and gender

issues. Qualified social and environmental safeguards experts of the PMC firms will support the 
PIUs and Satkers in supervision of the preparation and implementation of the LARPs. The PIUs 
will monitor and report to there event PMOs on all social and environmental safeguards activities. 
97 
92.  The  project  will—indirectly  and  with  some  lag—contribute  to  improving  gender  equity  in 
Indonesia 
the  preparation  and 
implementation  of  public  investment  projects  in  accordance  with  the  country’s  legislation  and 
international best practice, including ADB gender guidelines.60
through  mainstreaming  of  gender  responsiveness 
in 
93.  Consultation and participation will be also mainstreamed in the TORs and budgets of the 
project preparation consultants that will be financed under the ESP. When and where applicable, 
the  consultation  and  participation  during  project  preparation  will  draw  on  ADB’s  principles  on 
consultation and participation.61 The PIUs, in coordination with the PMOs, will be responsible to 
ensure that relevant sections of the TORs and consultant budgets adequately reflect consultation 
and participation activities during project preparation. 
94.  The PMOs will be primarily responsible for monitoring of incorporation of gender, social and 
consultation and  participation  dimensions  during implementation during  project  preparation  by 
the ESP-engaged consultants. 
60  For example, the Philippine experience of mainstreaming gender responsiveness in ODA-funded projects will be 
considered for appropriate adoption under the project.

Monitoring 
95.  Project performance monitoring will be done via quarterly and annual progress reports 
prepared  by  the  PIUs  of  each  DG.  The  PIUs  will  then  submit  the  reports  to  PMOs  who  will 
consolidate PIU’s reports with their own reports of monitoring and evaluation. The PMC firms shall 
assist the PIUs and PMOs in preparing all these reports. These reports by PMOs will be submitted 
to  PCO  to  be  consolidated  with  PCO’s  report  of  overall  ESP  monitoring  and  evaluation.  The 
template for the quarterly progress report is in Appendix 3 of the PAM. The PCO will submit the 
consolidated  ESP-whole  progress  reports  to  ADB  within 10  working days after  the  end of  the 
quarter, for which the progress report is issued. The progress report will be structured following 
the ESP’s Design and Monitoring Frameworks (DMF) and will also provide actual versus planned 
status of activities in the project implementation plan and the procurement plan. Project progress 
reports  will  indicate  the  status  of  preparation  and  implementation  of  LARPs  and  AMDALs 
supported under the ESP, highlighting projects that (may) face significant social or environmental 
issues during implementation. The reports shall have a special section on issues and proposed 
solutions. 
96.  Compliance monitoring. The ESP will be reviewed jointly by the SG, DGs and ADB twice 
a  year  during  ADB’s  administration  missions  that  will  assess  implementation  progress  and 
compliance  with  loan  agreement’s  covenants.  Compliance  will  be  also  monitored  through 
quarterly progress reports submitted by DGs and ESP-whole reports submitted by SG, as well as 
through review of project accounts and procurement procedures. 
97.  The DGs, in coordination with the PCO at SG, will ensure that (i) ESP funding is utilized based 
on procurement and financial management procedures agreed by the Government and ADB, (ii) 
all viable ESP-prepared projects are prioritized for inclusion in the MPWH’s capital budget for the 
year, in which the commencement of the civil works is expected to start, and (iii) all ESP-prepared 
projects that have been or are close to completion of civil works receive adequate O&M budget 
financing. 
98. 
In end 2018, a midterm review will be carried out by the MPWH and ADB to (i) evaluate the 
scope, design, and implementation arrangements of the project; (ii) evaluate the progress of the 
institutional development and capacity of the implementing agencies; (iii) identify changes needed 
in any of the areas mentioned above; (iv) assess the implementation performance against agreed 
project indicators and targets; (v) review and establish compliance with the loan covenants; and 
(vi)  identify  critical  issues,  problems,  constraints,  and  need  for  additional  finance,  63  and,  if 
necessary, recommend adjustments in ESP’s design or implementation arrangements. 
63 For example, per the Blue Book issued by Bappenas in October 2015 the financing amounts of engineering services 
projects  under  the  various  programs  of  DGWR  are  significantly  larger  than  DGWR’s  financing  under  the  ESP. 
Hence,  there  is  a space for  topping  up the  ESP,  subject to satisfactory  performance  of  the  ESP, Government’s 
request and concurrence by ADB.

C. 
Evaluation 
99.  Within 6 months of physical completion of the ESP, the DGWR, DGH, DGHS, and DGIF will 
submit project completion reports to the PCO for consolidation and further submission to ADB.64
The PMC  firms  will  support  the  DGs  will  collecting  the  relevant  data  and drafting  their  project 
completion reports. 
D. 
Reporting 
100.  The  DGWR,  DGH,  DGHS  and  DGIF–through  the  PCO  at  SG–will  provide  ADB  with  (i) 
quarterly  progress  reports  in  a  format  consistent  with  ADB's  project  performance  reporting 
system; (ii) consolidated annual reports including (a) progress achieved by output as measured 
through  the  indicator's  performance  targets,  (b)  key  implementation  issues  and  solutions;  (c) 
updated procurement plan and (d) updated implementation plan for next 12 months; and (iii) a 
completion report within 6 months of completion of project preparation work fora project. Project 
accounts and the executing agency AFS, together with the associated auditor's report, should be 
adequately reviewed. The template for the quarterly progress report is in Appendix 3. 
E. 
Stakeholder Communication Strategy 
101.  Key  immediate  stakeholders  include  MPWH  (its  directorates  general  and  local  offices), 
government agencies at local level (local land agency, local planning office, provincial, district or 
city  government)  and  the  project  preparation  consultants.  On  a  wider  basis,  beneficiaries  will 
include  the  development  partners,  consultants,  contractors  and  suppliers  under  the  public 
investment projects, and infrastructure related CSOs. Participation of stakeholders during project 
implementation  will  be  facilitated  through  interaction  during  administration  missions  and  ESP- 
associated events. Given the ESP’s institutional and project preparation support focus, no direct 
participation by the infrastructure project stakeholders is envisaged. 
102.  The  PMOs  of  DGWR,  DGH,  DGHS  and  DGIF  will  be  responsible  for  implementing  and 
monitoring information dissemination and disclosure with regards to its respective DG, and will 
identify a focal point that will be designated for regular contact with interested stakeholders. 
103.  Delivering  information.  Information  about  the  ESP  will  be  delivered  through  ESP 
dashboard  website60  that  describes  the  project’s  objectives,  components,  and  activities.  The 
PMCs will provide the required inputs to the dashboard, whose preparation and disclosure will be 
led by  the  PCO  at  SG.  Written  in  Bahasa  and  English,  the  dashboard,  which  will  be  updated 
annually, will make the project comprehensible to a wide range of stakeholder groups. In addition 
to the dashboard,  the  MPWH  will also consider options  to  allocate–within  6  months  after  loan 
effectiveness–a web page for the ESP that will disclose status of ESP implementation. Pursuant 
to  ADB’s  Public  Communications  Policy,  all  requisite  project documents  will  be  posted on the 
ADB website. 
104.  Obtaining Feedback. The PIB will indicate where stakeholders can get in touch with ESP 
implementers.  Stakeholder  meetings  will  ensure  that  accurate  and  sufficient  feedback  will  be 
received from stakeholder groups.

ANTICORRUPTION POLICY 
105.  ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any violations 
of  the  Anticorruption  Policy  relating to the  ESP.65 All  contracts financed by ADB shall 
include provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and 
accounts of the executing agency and all Project contractors, suppliers, consultants and 
other service providers. Individuals/entities on ADB’s anticorruption debarment list are 
ineligible to participate in ADB- financed activity and may not be awarded any contracts 
under the ESP.66To support these efforts,  relevant  provisions are  included  in  the  loan 
agreement/regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. 
106.  The ADB's Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to 
and discussed with the MOF, Bappenas, SetJen, DGWR, DGH, DGIF and DGHS. ADB 
will require the Borrower to institute, maintain, and comply with internal procedures and 
controls  following  international  best  practice  standards  for  the  purpose  of  preventing 
corruption or money laundering activities or the financing of terrorism and covenant with 
ADB to refrain from engaging in such activities. Consistent with its commitment to good 
governance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate, 
directly  or  through  its  agents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive 
practices relating to the Project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection 
with the ESP shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine 
the  records  and  accounts  of  the  DGWR,  DGH,  DGIF  and  DGHS  and  all  contractors, 
suppliers,  consultants,  and  other  service  providers  as  they  relate  to  the  ESP.  Any 
allegations of corruption can be reported to the PMOs and PCO, who will report these to 
the Secretary General and the ESP Steering Committee. 
107.  The MPWH will ensure that all its staff involved in the ESP are fully aware of and 
comply  with  the  Government’s  and  ADB’s  procedures,  including  procedures  for 
implementation, procurement, use of consultants, disbursement, reporting, monitoring, 
and prevention of fraud and corruption. 
108.  The  MPWH  will  consider  options  to  establish–within  6  months  after  loan 
effectiveness–a web-page for the ESP that will disclose the ESP implementation status 
and will also provide a link to LKPP’s SPSE. This web-page may cover such areas as (i) 
the panels consultant firms (associations of firms) for preparation of projects of DGWR, 
DGH,  and  DGHS,  (ii)  indicative  list  of  contract  packages  under  each  panel  per  the 
procurement plan agreed with the ADB, (iii) list of participating bidders for each project 
preparation assignment under each panel, (iv) the name of the winning consultant for 
the  project  preparation  assignment,  (v)  the  amount  of  the  contract  awarded,  and  (vi) 
contract mile-stones and the expected completion of the contract. 
XI. 
ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISM 
109.  People who are, or may in the future be, adversely affected by the project may 
submit complaints to ADB’s Accountability Mechanism. The Accountability Mechanism 
provides an independent forum and process whereby people adversely affected by ADB-
assisted projects can voice, and seek a resolution of their problems, as well as report 
alleged  violations  of  ADB’s  operational  policies  and  procedures.  Before  submitting  a 
complaint to the Accountability Mechanism, affected people should make a good faith 
effort to solve their problems by working with the concerned ADB operations department. 
Only  after  doing  that,  and  if  they  are  still  dissatisfied,  should  they  approach  the 
Accountability Mechanism.67
