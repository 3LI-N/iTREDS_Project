Project Administration Manual Purpose and Process 
The  project  administration  manual  (PAM)  describes  the  essential  administrative  and 
management requirements to implement the project on time, within budget, and in accordance 
with the policies and procedures of the government and Asian Development Bank (ADB). The 
PAM should include references to all available templates and instructions either through linkages 
to relevant URLs or directly incorporated in the PAM. 
The  executing  and  implementing  agencies  are  wholly  responsible  for  the  implementation  of 
ADB-financed  projects, as  agreed jointly  between  the  borrower  and  ADB,  and  in  accordance 
with  the  policies  and  procedures  of  the  government  and  ADB.  ADB  staff  is  responsible  for 
supporting  implementation  including  compliance  by  executing  and  implementing  agencies  of 
their  obligations  and  responsibilities  for  project  implementation  in  accordance  with  ADB’s 
policies and procedures. 
At loan negotiations, the borrower and ADB shall agree to the PAM and ensure consistency with 
the loan agreement. Such agreement shall be reflected in the minutes of the loan negotiations. 
In  the  event  of  any  discrepancy  or  contradiction  between  the  PAM  and  loan  agreement,  the 
provisions of the loan agreement shall prevail. 
After ADB Board approval of the project's report and recommendations of the President (RRP), 
changes in implementation arrangements are subject to agreement and approval pursuant to 
relevant government and ADB administrative procedures (including the Project Administration 
Instructions) and upon such approval, they will be subsequently incorporated in the PAM. 
I.

Subprojects that fall in part or in whole within an area supporting high biodiversity 
value. 5  
Subprojects  should  be  screened  and  assessed  based  on  procedures  defined  in  the 
14. 
Project’s environmental assessment and review framework (EARF).  
ii. 
Social  Safeguards,  Involuntary  Resettlement  and  Indigenous 
People or Customary Communities 
Involuntary resettlement is considered when the affected persons have no right to refuse 
15. 
the land acquisition by the government that result in their displacement. This occurs when land is 
acquired through (i) expropriation by invoking the eminent domain power of the state or (ii) land 
is  acquired  through  negotiated  settlement  when  the  pricing  is  negotiated  in  a  process  where 
expropriation will be the consequence of a failure in the negotiation. 
Subprojects with significant impacts classified as Category A for involuntary resettlement 
16. 
will not be financed under the Project, with significant impact being defined as:   
(i) 
(ii) 
200 or more persons being physically displaced from housing, and/or  
200 or more persons losing 10% or more of their productive (income generating) 
assets. 
17. 
Subprojects  classified  as  Category  A  for  indigenous  people  or  customary  communities 
(CC) as per ADB’s SPS 2009 will not be eligible under the emergency assistance project. The 
subproject likely to have significant (category A) CC impacts when a subproject, among others: 
(i) 
Acquires a huge land area or forest that makes villagers unable to continue their 
existing traditional livelihood system;  
(ii)  Changes  the  status  of  CC  from  self-subsistence  farmers  and  forest  products 
gatherers to factory workers;  
(iii)  Results  in  physically  displacing  a  sub-community  far  away  from  its  wider 
community of origin;  
(iv)  Causes  contamination  of  the  major  communal  water  sources  resulting  in  water 
borne diseases of the CC;  
(v)  Restricts  forest-dependent  CC  from  accessing  the  forest  area  where  for 
generations they used to hunt boars and collect rattan, wild fruits and other forest 
products; and 
(vi)  Undermines 
the  existing 
traditional 
irrigating  system  and  the  associated 
institutional arrangement for water distribution. 
18. 
Subprojects  should  be  screened  and  assessed  based  on  procedures  defined  in  the 
EARR’s  Resettlement  and  Customary  Communities  Development  Framework  (RCCDF)  which 
combines  the  involuntary  resettlement  framework  with  the  indigenous  people’s  development 
framework.

Criteria 4: Economic Viability and Financial Sustainability  
19. 
The design of the subproject will ensure the adoption of the least-cost approach, both in 
respect  of  capital,  as  well  as  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  costs,  keeping  in  view 
achievement of the EARR’s objective(s) and without compromising quality and disaster resilience.  
Financial  analysis  to  ensure  subprojects  viability  and/or  sustainability  will  be  conducted.  The 
subproject will need to demonstrate full recovery of recurring costs as a minimum qualification 
requirement. 
20. 
For subprojects that are estimated to cost more than $1 million, an Economic Internal Rate 
of Return (EIRR) should be calculated. The subproject will need to register an EIRR in excess of 
9% with economic benefits quantified based on reliable data.  
2. 
Prior Review and Approval by ADB  
21. 
The first subproject to be carried out by each implementing agency will be subject to prior 
review and approval by ADB. Subsequent subprojects exceeding $500,000 equivalent shall be 
sent to ADB for information only, while all subprojects exceeding $5 million equivalent will require 
prior review and approval by ADB. 6  
Subproject  safeguards  categorizations  will  be  sent  to  ADB.  Subproject  safeguard 
22. 
documents  will  need  prior  approval  by  ADB,  including  resettlement  plans,  resettlement  and 
customary  community  development  plan  (RCCDP),  due  diligence  report  completed  with 
corrective  action  plan  (DDR  –  CAP),  and  initial  environmental  examinations  (IEE)  with 
environmental  management  plans  (EMP),  as  needed.  Safeguards  documents  will  need  to  be 
consistent  with  the  EARR’s  EARF  and  RCCDF,  ADB’s  SPS  2009,  and  government  laws  and 
regulations.  
3. 
Procedures  
Each  subproject  will  be  prepared  and  processed  in  accordance  with  the  following 
23. 
procedures:  
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
Technical  study,  for  all  subprojects,  will  be  conducted  by  the  implementing 
agencies including its cost estimate. The implementing agencies will also prepare 
and  categorize  for  (a)  involuntary  resettlement;  (b)  indigenous  peoples;  and  (c) 
environment and send all categorization results to ADB.  
The implementing agencies will translate resettlement plans in the local language 
and  disclose  it  to  affected  people,  incorporating  results  of  consultations.  The 
implementing agencies will prepare the appraisal reports for all subprojects to be 
considered following the selection criteria, together with the required attachments, 
i.e.,  safeguards  documents  and  submit  these  to  ADB  for  approval.  Safeguards 
documents will be disclosed on ADB’s website and the website of the executing 
agencies.  
ADB  will  review  the  summary  appraisal  report  together  with  the  required 
attachments. If ADB finds that a proposed subproject does not satisfy the selection 
criteria and/or agreed procedures, ADB will advise the implementing agency either 
6 ADB approval of a subproject does not guarantee automatic approval of the withdrawal application for this 
subproject to be submitted by the Borrower. 
12 
(iv) 
(a)  to  modify  the  subproject  proposal  in  a  manner  that  will  make  it  eligible  for 
approval; or (b) that the subproject be rejected.  
The above procedure described in item (iii) will be applied only to those subprojects 
whose  estimated  cost  exceeds  $5  million.  Subprojects  equal  to  or  less  than  $5 
million will be reviewed by the implementing agencies and ADB will conduct post-
facto review of such subprojects on a sample basis. 
IV. 
COSTS AND FINANCING 
24. 
Component 1 of the EARR is estimated to cost $235.45 million, including contingencies. 
ADB will finance $188 million and the Government will fund $47.45 million. Cost estimates are 
presented in the table below.

V. 
FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT 
A. 
Financial Management Assessment 
The Financial Management Assessment (FMA) was conducted in accordance with ADB’s 
28. 
guidelines  on  Financial Management Technical Guidance  Note  (2015) 8  and  the  Financial  Due 
Diligence:  A  Methodology  Note  (2009). 9  The  FMA  considered  the  capacity  of  the  executing 
agency and the implementing agencies, including funds-flow arrangements, staffing, accounting 
and financial reporting systems, financial information systems, and internal and external auditing 
arrangements.  
29. 
The Public Financial Management assessment indicates that the government’s prevailing 
financial,  accounting,  auditing  rules,  and  systems  meet  generally  accepted  international 
accounting  and  auditing  standards.  The  2017  Public  Expenditure  and  Financial  Accountability 
Assessment  for  Indonesia  showed  that  17  of  the  31  indicators  scored  A  or  B,  which  are  both 
considered above the basic alignment with international good practice. Indicators with particularly 
good assessment results included transparency of public finance, and accounting and reporting—
all key for the successful implementation of the Project. 10 The assessment also identified some 
areas for improvement, including the strategic allocation of resources and the efficiency of public 
spending  by  linking  performance  information  more  effectively  to  planning  and  budgeting.  The 
established legal and regulatory framework for public financial management was strengthened in 
2017 through the government regulations mandating coordination between the National Planning 
Agency and the Ministry of Finance (MOF) to improve the policy orientation of budgeting. 
The  FMA  is  updated  for  MPWH  and  respective  implementing  agencies  part  of  MPWH, 
30. 
based on previous ADB-financed projects. 11 MPWH’s financial management is governed by the 
government’s prevailing financial, accounting, auditing rules and systems, which are assessed as 
meeting generally accepted international accounting and auditing standards. The overall financial 
systems  and  policies  of  the  executing  agency  is  acceptable.  The  executing  agency  and 
implementing  agencies  have  the  capacity  to  implement  the  project,  since  they  have  extensive 
experience  in  implementing  ADB-funded  projects.  Furthermore,  as  most  ADB  project  loans  in 
Indonesia  have  used  advance  account  procedures,  MOF  as  the  borrower  has  extensive 
experience and capacity to establish and administer advance account.   
31. 
The pre-mitigated financial management risk level for the project is moderate. Focus on 
quick implementation and limited capacity at subnational level contribute to the risk rating. Overall, 
emergency  projects  require  FM  Specialist  support  and  oversight  during  implementation  to 
address risks and mitigation activities identified in this FMA. 
32.  Major fiduciary risks identified are considered manageable due to the following mitigation 
measures: (i) providing financial management training to project financial management staff and

Disbursement Arrangements for ADB Funds 
The  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  Loan  Disbursement 
34. 
Handbook  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time), 12  and  detailed  arrangements  agreed  upon 
between the government and ADB. Online training for project staff on disbursement policies and 
procedures  is  available. 13  Project  staff  are  encouraged  to  avail  of  this  training  to  help  ensure 
efficient disbursement and fiduciary control. 
35. 
Advance account procedure. The government (MOF) will establish an advance account 
for MPWH at the central bank (Bank Indonesia) to facilitate the timely release of loan funds. The

21 
currency of the advance account will be US Dollar. The advance account will be administered by 
the  MOF.  The  advance  accounts  will  be  established,  managed,  replenished,  and  liquidated  in 
accordance  with  ADB’s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). 
The advance account is to be used exclusively for ADB’s share of eligible expenditures. The MOF, 
who administers the advance account, is accountable and responsible for proper use of advances 
to the advance account.  
36. 
The total outstanding advance to the advance account should not exceed the estimate of 
ADB’s  share  of  expenditures  to  be  paid  through  the  advance  account  for  the  forthcoming  6 
months. MOF will request for initial and additional advances to the advance account based on an 
Estimate of Expenditure Sheet 14 setting out the estimated expenditures to be financed through 
the accounts for the forthcoming 6 months. Supporting documents should be submitted to ADB 
or  retained  by  the  Borrower  (MOF,  the  executing  agency,  and  the  implementing  agencies)  in 
accordance  with  ADB’s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time) 
when liquidating or replenishing the advance account. 
Statement of expenditure procedure. 15 The statement of expenditure (SOE) procedure 
37. 
may be used for reimbursement and liquidation of the advance account. Supporting documents 
and records for the the expenditures claimed under the SOE rds should be maintained and made 
readily available for review by ADB’s disbursement and review mission or upon ADB’s request for 
submission of supporting documents on a sampling basis, and for independent audit.  
38. 
Before the submission of the first withdrawal application (WA), the borrower should submit 
to ADB, sufficient evidence of the authority of the persons who will sign the WAs on behalf of the 
government, together with the authenticated specimen signatures of each authorized person. The 
minimum  value  per WA is  stipulated  in the  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2017,  as  amended 
from time to time). Individual payments below such amount should be paid (i) by the executing 
agency/implementing agencies and subsequently claimed to ADB through reimbursement, or (ii) 
through the advance fund procedure, unless otherwise accepted by ADB. The borrower should 
ensure sufficient category and contract balances before requesting disbursements. Use of ADB’s 
Client Portal Disbursement (CPD). 16 System is mandatory for submission of WAs to ADB. Sample 
forms for withdrawal applications of loan proceeds can be downloaded from the ADB website. 
39. 
Sufficient supporting documentation, as defined in ADB’s Loan Disbursement Handbook 
(2017, as amended from time to time) will be kept at each level of the EARR implementation to 
substantiate all expenditures incurred from the loan proceeds. Relevant project staff will be trained 
in ADB’s disbursement procedures.  
2. 
Disbursement Arrangements for Counterpart Fund 
The  implementing  agencies  are  responsible  for  preparing  and  requesting  budgetary 
40. 
allocations  for  counterpart  funds  to  be  included  in  the  DIPA.  Disbursement  procedures  for  the 
counterpart funds will follow the government regulations. Local taxes and duties under the EARR 
will be financed by the government and budgeted in the counterpart funds. 
14  Estimate  of  Expenditure  sheet  is  available  in  Appendix  8A  of  ADB’s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2017,  as 
amended from time to time),  
15  SOE forms are available in Appendix 7B and 7D of ADB’s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from 
time to time). 
16 The CPD facilitates online submission of WA to ADB, resulting in faster disbursement. The forms to be completed 
by the Borrower are available online at https://www.adb.org/documents/client-portal-disbursements-guide. 
22 
C. 
Accounting 
41. 
Each implementing agency will maintain, or cause to be maintained, separate books and 
records by funding source for all expenditures incurred by the EARR. The executing agency will 
prepare  consolidated  project  financial  statements  in  accordance  with  the  government's 
accounting laws and regulations which are consistent with international accounting principles and 
practices.  
D. 
Auditing and Public Disclosure 
42. 
The executing agency will cause the detailed consolidated project financial statements to 
be  audited  in  accordance  with  International  Standards  on  Auditing  and  with  the  Government's 
audit regulations, by an independent auditor acceptable to ADB. In addition, the MOF will cause 
the  EARR  advance  account  opened  in  Bank  Indonesia  to  be  audited  in  accordance  with 
International  Standards  on  Auditing  and  with  the  Government's  audit  regulations,  by  an 
independent auditor acceptable to ADB.  
43. 
Such  audited  consolidated  project  financial  statements  and  audited  EARR  advance 
account will be submitted in the English language to ADB within six months of the end of the fiscal 
year by executing agency. 
44. 
The audit report for the EARR financial statements and special bank account will include 
auditor’s opinions, which cover (i) whether the EARR financial statements present an accurate 
and fair view or are presented fairly, in all material respects, in accordance with the applicable 
financial  reporting  standards;  (ii)  whether  the  proceeds  of  the  EARR  were  used  only  for  the 
purpose(s) of the EARR; and (iii) whether the borrower or the executing agency was in compliance 
with the financial covenants contained in the legal agreements (where applicable). In addition, the 
audit report for the EARR financial statements will include a management letter.  
45. 
Compliance with financial reporting and auditing requirements will be monitored by review 
missions and during normal program supervision, and followed up regularly with all concerned, 
including the external auditor.  
46. 
The government, the executing agency and the implementing agencies have been made 
aware  of  ADB’s  approach  to  delayed  submission,  and  the  requirements  for  satisfactory  and 
acceptable quality of the audited project financial statements. 17 ADB reserves the right to require 
a  change  in  the  auditor  (in  a  manner  consistent  with  the  constitution  of  the  borrower),  or  for 
additional  support  to  be  provided  to  the  auditor,  if  the  audits  required  are  not  conducted  in  a 
manner satisfactory to ADB, or if the audits are substantially delayed. ADB reserves the right to 
17 ADB’s approach and procedures regarding delayed submission of audited project financial statements:  
(i)  When audited EARR financial statements are not received by the due date, ADB will write to the EA advising 
that (a) the audit documents are overdue; and (b) if they are not received within the next 6 months, requests 
for new contract awards and disbursement such as new replenishment of advance accounts, processing of 
new reimbursement, and issuance of new commitment letters will not be processed. 
(ii)  When  audited  EARR  financial  statements  are  not  received  within  6  months  after  the  due  date,  ADB  will 
withhold processing of requests for new contract awards and disbursement such as new replenishment of 
advance accounts, processing of new reimbursement, and issuance of new commitment letters. ADB will (a) 
inform the EA of ADB’s actions; and (b) advise that the project may be suspended if the audit documents are 
not received within the next 6 months. 
(iii)  When audited EARR financial statements are not received within 12 months after the due date, ADB may 
suspend the EARR. 
23 
verify  the  project's  financial  accounts  to  confirm  that  the  share  of  ADB’s  financing  is  used  in 
accordance with ADB’s policies and procedures.  
47. 
Public disclosure of the audited financial reports, including the auditor’s opinion, will be 
guided by ADB’s Public Communications Policy 2011. 18 After the review, ADB will disclose the 
audited  EARR  financial  statements  and  the  opinion  of  the  auditors  on  the  EARR  financial 
statements no later than 14 days of ADB’s confirmation of their acceptability by posting them on 
ADB’s website. The management letter, additional auditor’s opinions, and audited entity financial 
statements will not be disclosed. 19 
VI. 
PROCUREMENT AND CONSULTING SERVICES 
A. 
Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing 
48. 
All  advance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  will  be  undertaken  in  conformity  with 
ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and the Procurement Regulations 
for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time). The issuance of invitations to bid under 
advance contracting and retroactive financing will be subject to ADB approval. The borrower, the 
executing agency, and the implementing agencies have been advised that approval of advance 
contracting and retroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance the EARR. 
49. 
Advance  Contracting.  Advance  contracting  under  the  EARR  will  be  applicable  for 
recruitment of Engineering and Project Management Consultants and procurement of civil works 
including  advertisement,  receiving  bids,  and  evaluation  of  bids,  prior  to  loan  effectiveness. 
Detailed engineering designs and bidding documents for selected subprojects may be prepared 
under  the  ongoing  Loan  3455  Accelerating  Infrastructure  Delivery  through  Better  Engineering 
Services Project and Loan 3440 Flood Management in Selected River Basin Project. Individual 
consultant  selections  to  support  the  project  at  various  levels  may  follow  advance  contracting 
actions. 
50. 
Retroactive  financing. Retroactive  financing  will  be  allowed  for  up to  30%  of  the  loan 
amount for eligible expenditures incurred under the EARR, provided that such expenditures have 
been incurred not earlier than 28 September 2018. 20 
B. 
Procurement of Goods, Works, and Consulting Services 
51. 
All  procurement  of  goods  and  works  and  consulting  services  will  be  undertaken  in 
accordance  with  ADB  Procurement  Policy  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  the 
Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time).  
52.  Most civil works and goods contracts will be procured through open competitive bidding 
(OCB)  and  the  national  advertisement  method.  To  ensure  efficiency,  special  procedures  for 
18 Public Communications Policy:  http://www.adb.org/documents/pcp-2011?ref=site/disclosure/publications 
19 This type of information would generally fall under public communications policy exceptions to disclosure. ADB. 2011. 
Public Communications Policy. Paragraph 97(iv) and/or 97(v). 
20  If  the  borrower  proceeds  with  the  initial  steps  of  procurement  before  signing  the  financing  agreement,  the 
procurement procedures shall be acceptable to ADB and in accordance with the Procurement Plan for any contracts 
subsequently awarded to be eligible for ADB financing. Furthermore, if the contract is signed, reimbursement by ADB 
of any expenses incurred by the borrower under the contract prior to effectiveness of the financing agreement is 
referred to as retroactive financing. 
24 
emergency  lending  will  be  used  as guided  by the  Guidance  Note  on  Fragile,  Conflict-affected, 
and Emergency Situations (2018, as amended from time to time), including (i) wider use of post 
qualification, (ii) reducing the bidding period to 15 working days for international competition and 
7 working days for national competition when appropriate, (iii) using single-stage one-envelope 
bidding  procedures,  (iv)  developing  a  time-bound  action  plan  to  award  contracts,  including  a 
contract management plan.  The national electronic public procurement system (SPSE) may be 
used for OCB national advertisement provided the system accommodates the agreed Standard 
Bidding Document (SBD) and uses the central SPSE’s MPWH that has been enhanced to comply 
with the ADB requirements.  
53. 
Procurement  risk  assessments  of  the  ongoing  projects  financed  by  ADB, 21  found  the 
overall  procurement  risk  of  implementing  agencies  of  MPWH  as  medium.  Based  on  the 
assessment, ADB’s review type have been established. In case of works and goods contract, the 
first contract of similar nature for each implementing agency shall be prior reviewed by ADB and 
the remaining may be post reviewed by ADB. A sampling approach will be applied for the contract 
packages less than $20 million while full post review will be used for the package between $20 
million and $40 million. All contract packages above $40 million will be prior reviewed.  
54. 
Some  civil  works  and goods  contracts,  and  consulting  services may  be  procured  using 
direct contracting, where appropriate, following procedures acceptable to ADB. Small and simple 
works and goods up to $100,000 may be procured using international and/or national request for 
quotations.  ADB  encourages  community  participation  in  the  procurement  of  small  works  of  a 
simple nature.  
To support the EARR implementation, Engineering and Project Management Consultant 
55.  
firms  will  be  recruited  through  OCB  procedures  using  a  quality-  and  cost-  based  selection. 
Individual  consultants  will  be  recruited  using  the  individual  selection  method  with  international 
and/or national advertisements, based on the EARR’s requirements. Consultants who are already 
engaged in ADB-financed projects and provide similar services as those required for the Project 
may be recruited directly under the project, subject to satisfactory performance.22 The Consultants 
will  support  the  implementing  agencies  in  undertaking  procurement  in  line  with  procurement 
arrangements agreed for the EARR. 
56.   Before  the  start  of  any  procurement,  ADB  and  the  government  will  review  the  public 
procurement laws of the government to ensure consistency with ADB’s Procurement Policy and 
Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, both as amended from time to time).  
C. 
Procurement Plan 
57. 
The initial procurement plan is in Appendix 4. The information in the procurement plan is 
indicative  and  will  be  further  detailed  during  the  EARR  start  up  period  through  a  discussion 
between ADB and MPWH.

VII. 
SAFEGUARDS 
59. 
Environment. The  EARR  is  classified  as  category  B for  environmental safeguards  per 
ADB’s Safeguards Policy Statement (SPS), 2009. Subprojects classifying as category A, 23 and 
subprojects  with  activities  described  in  ADB’s  Prohibited  Investment  Activities  List  shall  not  be 
eligible  for  financing  under  the  EARR.  Subprojects  will  not  be  undertaken  in  protected  areas 
including those either legally protected or officially proposed for protection. 24 
60. 
The  exclusion  of  subprojects  classifying  as  category  A  from  the  EARR  scope  will  be 
ensured  through  screening  of  all  subprojects  in  accordance  with  the  EARR’s  environmental 
assessment and review framework (EARF) 25 that was prepared for the EARR and endorsed by 
the  executing  agency.  Each  subproject  will  be  classified  individually  using  the  screening 
procedure  and  the  rapid  environmental  assessment  (REA)  screening  checklists  defined  in  the 
EARF. Only subprojects classifying as category B or C are eligible. 
For  subprojects  classifying  as  category  B  for  environment,  initial  environmental 
61. 
examinations (IEE) and environmental management plans (EMP) will be prepared consistent with 
the  EARF.  These  will  be  submitted  to  and  cleared  by  ADB  and  disclosed  on  the  executing 
agency’s  website  and  to  potentially  affected  communities.  The  IEEs  and  EMPs  will  be 
incorporated into bidding documents and contract documents to be implemented by contractors.  
62. 
Indonesia  environmental  assessment  procedure  will  also  be  followed,  and  consultation 
with  district/provincial  DLH  will  be  undertaken  prior  to  commencing  the  activity.  All  subproject 
proposals  will  undergo  screening  according  to  relevant  government  laws  and  regulations  to 
classify whether a project proposal would need AMDAL, or UKL/UPL (equal to category B), or 
SPPL (equal to category C). All subprojects will undertake environmental assessment and shall 
obtain environmental clearance before proceeding to implementation. In addition, all applicable 
government environmental permits/ approvals/ concurrences and ADB approval must be obtained 
prior to any contract award for civil works. 
63. 
A grievance redress mechanism (GRM) should be established during construction of the 
project  to  address  unforeseen  problems  and  issues  that  may  arise  due  to  construction  and 
operational impacts. The executing agencies will establish a mechanism to receive and facilitate 
resolution  of  affected  peoples’  concerns,  complaints,  and  grievances  about  the  EARR’s 
environmental safeguard performance.  
64. 
Involuntary  Resettlement.    The  project  is  classified  as  category  B  for  involuntary 
resettlement (IR) in accordance with ADB’s SPS 2009 because the EARR is likely to have minor 
impact on IR. Subproject triggering category A for IR will be excluded. implementing agencies will 
screen  potential  subprojects  early  to  identify  past,  present,  and  future  land  acquisition  and 
resettlement  impacts  and  will  adopt  measures  to  avoid  or  minimize  these  impacts.  Subproject 
with category B and C will be eligible.    
23 Subprojects likely to have significant impacts that are irreversible, diverse, or unprecedented as per ADB’s Safeguard 
Policy Statement (2009) 
24 Including (i) Protected Areas as defined in Annex III of Minister of Environment Regulation No. 5/2012 on Types of 
Business Plans and/or Activities Requiring AMDAL; and (ii) Key Biodiversity Areas as defined in the World Database 
of Key Biodiversity Areas managed by BirdLife International on behalf of the KBA Partnership. World Database of. 
Key Biodiversity Areas.

26 
65.  Meaningful consultations will be conducted with affected persons and concerned parties 
to ensure their participation from planning, implementation, and monitoring.  Special attention will 
be  provided  to  the  needs  of  vulnerable  groups  (especially  those  below  the  poverty  line,  the 
landless,  the  elderly,  women  and  children,  those  without  legal  title  to  land,  and  indigenous 
peoples).    Establish  a  grievance  redress  mechanism  to  receive  and  facilitate  resolution  of  the 
affected persons’ concerns. 
66. 
Negotiated land acquisition and voluntary donation will follow procedure in a transparent, 
consistent,  and  equitable  manner  and  be  confirmed  through  written  record  and  verified  by  an 
independent  third  party.  Ensuring  that  voluntary  donations  do  not  severely  affect  the  living 
standards of the affected persons.  
Indigenous  Peoples.  The  EARR  is  classified  as  category  B  for  Indigenous  People   
67. 
because the project is likely to have limited impact (positive and negative) on Indigenous People 
or  Customary  Communities  (IP/CC).  The  implementing  agencies  shall  screen  each  subproject 
and  ensure  that  subprojects  triggering  A  for  IP  as  per  ADB  SPS  2009  will  be  excluded.  The 
magnitude of impact is assessed through the following aspects; (i) customary rights of use and 
access  to  land  and  natural  resources;  (ii)  socioeconomic  status;  (iii)  cultural  and  communal 
integrity;  (iv)  health,  education,  livelihood,  and  social  security  status;  and  (v)  recognition  of 
indigenous people. 
68.  Meaningful  consultations  with  customary  communities  (including  women  and  youth)  at 
each  stage  of  the  project  will  be  conducted  to  identify  customary  communities’  perspectives, 
issues and concerns. Culturally appropriate and gender inclusive grievance mechanism to receive 
and facilitate resolution of the Indigenous Peoples’ concerns will be set up. 
69. 
Social  Safeguards  Plans.  As  most  of  project  activities  cover  infrastructure  in  various 
sectors with almost similar impacts, an RCCDF has been prepared for the project in line with (a) 
applicable  Indonesian  laws  and  regulations  related  to  land  acquisition  and  customary 
communities; (b) ADB Safeguards Policy of 2009 specifically on IR and IP Safeguards. Impact 
assessments and safeguard plans are prepared during subproject preparation in conformity with 
the RCCDF. 
The  RCCDF  is  to  guide  subproject  selection,  screening  and  categorization,  social 
70. 
assessment,  and  implementation  of  social  safeguard  plan  during  project  implementation.   
Screening guidance is provided to establish the type of social safeguards document required for 
future  sub  projects.  There  are  three  possible  documents  that  may  be  required  during  project 
implementation: resettlement plan, RCCDP, and Due Diligence Report – Corrective Action Plan 
(DDR-CAP), if any. The implementing agencies shall prepare a safeguard planning document for 
the subproject if land acquisition and involuntary resettlement and/or indigenous people safeguard 
is triggered. These documents will be disclosed to the affected persons and posted on ADB and 
project websites.  
Institutional arrangements for safeguards. The executing agency will be responsible 
71. 
for  overall  project  implementation  including  safeguards.  The  executing  agency  will  establish  a 
CPMU which will be supported by the Project Management Consultant (PMC). The PMC will have 
environment  and  social  safeguards  specialists  to  support  the  PMU  to  prepare  consolidated 
environmental and social safeguards monitoring reports to be submitted to ADB for review and 
disclosure  on  its  website,  provide  guidance  to  safeguards  specialist  consultants  at  PIU,  and 
capacity building on safeguards at regions.  
27 
The implementing agencies will form PIUs which will have Safeguards Focal Persons to 
72. 
supervise and coordinate environmental and social safeguards planning and implementation. The 
PIUs will be assisted by engineering and management consultants (EMC) for DGHS and DGWR. 
The EMC will include environment specialists and social safeguards specialists engaged during 
Project  implementation  to  assist  the  PIUs  in  preparing,  implementing,  and  monitoring  the 
safeguards.  The  PIUs  will  ensure  that  the  EARF  and  RCCDF  are  followed  during  subproject 
preparation and implementation. PIUs   will undertake screening and classification of subprojects 
consistent with the EARF and RCCDF for submission to the executing agency and implementing 
agencies, relevant local agencies, 26 and ADB. The PIUs will prepare the respective safeguards 
documents (IEE, resettlement plan, RCCDP, DDR-CAP) for proposed subprojects. Safeguards 
documents  will  be  reviewed  and  approved  by  implementing  agencies    and  ADB.  PIUs  will  be 
tasked  with  the  day-to-day  implementation  and  monitoring  of  safeguards  plans.  PIUs  will  also 
obtain  all  clearances  and  fulfill  government  requirements  and  safeguard  permits.  PIUs  will  be 
responsible  for  data  required  for  safeguards  plan  preparation  and  monitoring  and  progress 
reports,  and  coordination  with  relevant  agencies  including  provincial  or  district  environmental 
agency (Dinas Lingkungan Hidup, DLH), land office, regional development acceleration team to 
consult  and/or  obtain  endorsement  if  necessary.  Institutional  roles  and  responsibilities  are 
detailed in the EARF and RCCDF.  
VIII.  GENDER AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS 
73. 
Gender  category  at  entry.  The  EARR's  gender  classification  is  "Effective  Gender 
Mainstreaming" (EGM) which means that at least 50% of the outputs integrate gender targets and 
design features. It is expected that women, children, people living with disabilities and the elderly 
can participate and fully benefit from the disaster rehabilitation and reconstruction interventions 
supported by the EARR. 
Key actions. The EARR’s gender action plan (GAP) includes the following actions and 
74. 
targets:  (i)  reconstruction/rehabilitation  of  infrastructure  (education  institutions,  irrigation,  water 
supply)  integrate  gender  responsive  and  inclusive  design  features  and/or  safety  measures  for 
women, children, the elderly and people with disability; (ii) safety standards for disaster resilient 
infrastructure and/or disaster preparedness and response plans developed in consultation with 
local stakeholders including women (45% women’s participation); and (iii) labor opportunities, and 
ensuring equal pay for work of equal value.  
GAP  implementation  arrangements.  MPWH  will  be  responsible  for  ensuring  the 
75. 
implementation  of  the  GAP,  more  particularly  the  gender  actions  and  targets  related  to  the 
relevant  components  of  their  respective  sectors/sub-sectors.  The  measures  included  in  the 
Project’s GAP are in line with Head of National Disaster Agency Regulation No. 13 Year 2014 on 
Gender Mainstreaming in Disaster Management that mandates gender responsive planning and 
budgeting during rehabilitation and reconstruction phase. 
(i) 
two  national  Gender  Consultants  will  be  hired  on  an  intermittent  basis  in  the  executing 
agency  and  will  be  responsible  to  support  the  executing  agency  and  implementing 
agencies  in  implementing,  monitoring  and  reporting  on  the  GAP  for  the  concerned 
sectors/sub-sectors  and  ensuring  that  GAP  implementation  is  on-track.  The  Gender 
Consultant will also be responsible for delivering gender awareness training.  
26 Environment categorization of subprojects per Minister of Environment Regulation No. 5/2012 shall be confirmed by 
the relevant provincial or district environmental agency (Dinas Lingkungan Hidup, DLH). 
28 
(ii) 
(iii) 
the GAP will be implemented by the implementing agencies with assistance of consultant 
teams  and  gender  focal  points.  Gender  focal  points  (from  existing  government  Gender 
and  Development  Focal  Point  System)  will  be  appointed/designated  for  the  Project  to 
manage  day-to-day  GAP  activities  and  monitoring  in  coordination  with  the  executing

Monitoring  
77. 
Project  performance  monitoring.  The  CPMU  in  coordination  with  PMUs  will  be 
responsible  for  all  aspects  of  monitoring  and  evaluation,  including:  (i)  performance  evaluation 
against  project  milestones;  (ii)  safeguards  monitoring;  (iii)  financial  commitments  and  (iv) 
implementation of risk mitigating actions plan. Reports on project achievements will be provided 
quarterly  and  summarized  annually.  Quarterly  reports  will  contain  update  contract  awards  and 
disbursements  projections  based  on  Project  Performance  Review  requirement  presented  in 
Appendix  3.  In  addition,  the  consultants  will  develop,  and  the  PMU  will  approve,  a  project 
performance monitoring system (PPMS) based on existing PPMS in use for other ADB projects 
and  will  include  spatial  visualization  interface  (GIS  based).  28  The  PIUs  will  conduct  regular 
monitoring, using the same indicators and submit reports to PMU and ADB.   
78. 
Compliance monitoring. The status of compliance with loan covenants will be reviewed 
at  each  ADB  review  mission.  Any  non-compliance  issues  will  be  specified  in  the  quarterly 
progress reports together with remedial actions. 
79. 
Safeguards  monitoring.  The  executing  and  implementing  agencies  will  brief  the  PIU 
Safeguards  Focal  Persons  on  monitoring  requirements  for  IEE/EMP,  RP,  RCCDP,  and  CAP 
implementation and RCCDP implementation. Monitoring data will be generated by the PIUs. The 
PIUs will submit semi-annual safeguards monitoring reports to the CPMU. The CPMU supported 
by the consultants will prepare consolidated semi-annual monitoring reports (one for environment 
and  one  for  involuntary  resettlement)  that  describe  progress  of  safeguards  implementation, 
compliance issues, and corrective actions. Reports will be posted on the project website, and the 
implementing  agencies  (through  the  PIUs)  will  make  hard  copies  accessible  to  the  public. 
Safeguards  monitoring  requirements  including  suggested  monitoring  report  formats  are  in  the 
EARF and RCCDF. 
Gender  and  social  dimensions  monitoring  Regular  monitoring  of  gender  related

indicators/targets included in the DMF and the GAP will be done during project implementation. 
The  PPMS  will  ensure that  data  disaggregated by  sex  is  collected,  analyzed,  and reported  on 
wherever relevant and will allow to monitor women’s participation in all construction and capacity-
building activities supported by the project. Progress reports on the implementation of the GAP 
will  be  submitted  to  ADB  at  least  on  a  semi-annual  basis  using  the  GAP  progress  monitoring 
template as part of the quarterly progress report. Participatory monitoring of project impacts will 
be implemented at the mid-term of the project and this will include focus group discussions and 
interviews with women and adolescent girls who are direct beneficiaries of activities supported by 
the project to obtain both quantitative and qualitative data.   
C. 
Evaluation 
81. 
An  inception  mission  will  be  scheduled  shortly  after  loan  effectiveness.  Implementation 
review missions will be held every three to six months. A midterm review is tentatively scheduled 
for end of 2020. Within 6 months of physical completion of the Project, the executing agency will 
submit a project completion report to ADB. 
28   ADB's project performance reporting system is available at  
  http://www.adb.org/Documents/Slideshows/PPMS/default.asp?p=evaltool 
34 
D. 
Reporting 
82. 
The  executing  agency  will  provide  ADB  with  (i)  quarterly  progress  reports  in  a  format 
consistent  with  ADB's  project  performance  reporting  system;  (ii)  consolidated  annual  reports 
including  (a)  progress  achieved  by  output  as  measured  through  the  indicator's  performance 
targets,  (b)  key  implementation  issues  and  solutions,  (c)  updated  procurement  plan,  and  (d) 
updated  implementation  plan  for  the  next  12  months;  (iii)  semi-annual  safeguards  monitoring 
reports (one for environment and one for involuntary resettlement); and (iv) a project completion 
report  within  6  months  of  physical  completion  of  the  project.  To  ensure  that  the  Project  will 
continue  to  be  both  viable  and  sustainable,  Project  accounts  and  the  EA’s  audited  financial 
statement  together  with  the  associated  auditor's  report,  should  be  adequately  reviewed.  An 
outline of quarterly report progress format is in Appendix 2. 
E. 
Stakeholder Communication Strategy  
83. 
The project will comply with the policy of transparency and accountability of the ADB Public 
Communications Policy (PCP) 2011 and –beginning 1 January 2019– the Access to Information 
Policy (AIP). To do so, it will establish a communications strategy that will ensure an efficient and 
continuous  two-way  communication  about  ADB  projects  with  stakeholders  with  a  focus  on 
managing stakeholders’ expectation during all phases of the project implementation. The strategy 
will follow the following approaches: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
Stakeholders. Critical stakeholders for the project include people affected by the 
disasters, project-affected persons in general, and women and vulnerable groups. 
Other key stakeholders include but are not limited to executing and implementing 
agencies,  government  officials  at  national  and  sub-national  levels,  interested 
community-based organizations, interested civil society organizations, interested 
private  sector  entities,  and  interested  development  partners  especially  those 
working on the rehabilitation and reconstruction of the area;  
Disclosure.  PMUs  and  PIU  will  disclose  on  their  respective  websites  all  key 
project-related information, including the scope, cost, and financial and institutional 
arrangements of the project, project safeguard reports, project progress such as 
procurement  and  contract  award,  and  the  audited  financial  project  financial 
statements.  The  project  will  also  provide  contact  details  on  the  PMU  and  PIUs 
counterpart staff; 
Communication  focal  point.  PMUs  and  PIUs  will  be  responsible 
for 
implementation and monitoring of information dissemination and disclosure of the 
project’s components. PMUs and PIUs shall also designate a focal point to identify, 
strategize, and coordinate such implementation and monitoring as well as being 
the custodian of all project’s information; 
Awareness-raising  materials.  The  project  will  at  the  minimum  prepare:  (a)  a 
Project Fact Sheet or Project Information Booklet which contains details such as 
project’s  objectives,  components,  activities,  timeline,  the focal  point’s  name  and 
contact  details,  and  grievance  redress  mechanism;  (b)  a  Project  Brief  which 
summarizes all the project’s details in a simple language and utilizing stories and 
infographics targeting a wider group of audience, including the poor and women. 
Both  documents  will  be  made  in  Indonesian  and  English  languages  and  will  be 
available  for  public  in  print  at  the  project  information  desk,  distributed  during  all 
35 
(v) 
stakeholders’  consultations  and  outreach  activities,  and  posted  online  on  ADB 
website.  Other  information  materials  may  be  developed  for  distinct  stakeholder 
groups; 
Channels.  For  an  effective  dissemination  and  efficient  use  of  resources, 
collaboration  with  other  readily  available  channels  should  be  highly  prioritized, 
including but not limited to government websites both at national and subnational 
levels; government social media accounts; and ADB website and its other online 
platforms. All online platforms will be optimally utilized to ensure unrestricted public 
access  to  information  and  documents  repository.  Meanwhile,  conventional 
methods  will  remain  be  used  as  appropriate  to  ensure  that  all  interested 
stakeholders have access to information, including but not limited to: setting up a 
project  information  desk  at  a  designated  spot  in  the  project  area;  face-to-face 
communications  during  stakeholders’  consultations  and  outreach;  setting  up 
project signage at the areas of civil works; displaying posters and banners at the 
relevant government offices; making project fact sheets and brief available at these 
offices;  and  re-using  project  information  as  interview  materials,  articles,  and 
advertorials in media. The project will explore partnership with national and local 
print,  electronic  and  digital  media  organizations 
to  disseminate  project’s 
information.  The  project  will  also  proactively  seek  opportunities  to  participate  in 
local community activities and provide information about the projects; 
(vi) 
Coordination.  The  project  through  the  focal  point  will  coordinate  with  relevant 
government agencies and development partners particularly those working on the 
rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  of  the  area  to  ensure  effective  communication 
effort by avoiding overlaps and identity potential collaboration if possible.  
84. 
This strategy will be presented in detail as a project’s communications strategy matrix of 
the government and ADB. The matrix will outline project’s communications context and outcomes, 
objectives, key messages, specific channels and activities, timeline of delivery, work responsibility 
and resource allocation.

Ministry  of  Public  Works  and  Housing  will  recruit  engineers  to  redesign  the 
Gumbasa irrigation system through a staged approach: (i) master planning to 
integrated  infrastructure,  institutional  and  agriculture  development,  (ii)  LIDAR 
surveys,  and  field  investigation;  (ii)  Feasibility  study;  (iii)  Detail  Engineering 
Design. The planning  will incorporate agriculture development to complement 
infrastructure  works.  The  consultant  will  also  prepare  social  and  environment 
safeguards document, and bidding documents as per ADB’s requirements.  
Preparation 
The JICA specialists will work closely with the DILL team to ensure that disaster 
countermeasures are embedded into the detailed design especially liquefaction 
and seismic countermeasures. 
To  complement  the  engineering  works  to  be  financed  under  L3455,  and  to 
ensure  that  aquifer  interaction  with  the  Gumbasa  system  will  not  lead  to 
liquefaction, it is proposed to mobilize Swiss researchers to conduct a detailed 
study on the aquifer and its dynamic. The National Research Center for Water 
Resources 
(PUSAIR)  conducted  surveys  and  prepare  a  preliminary 
hydrodynamic  model  for  the  aquifer.  Further  analysis  is  needed  to  better 
understand the aquifer dynamic due to ground movement around the canal and

EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE FOR 
REHABILITATION AND RECONSTRUCTION (EARR)  
COMPONENT 1: PUBLIC WORKS INFRASTRUCTURE 
A. 
BACKGROUND 
The Government of Indonesia with the support from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) 
1. 
is implementing the Emergency Assistance for Rehabilitation and Reconstruction (EARR). which 
supports the government in rebuilding infrastructure damaged by devastating disaster events in 
Central Sulawesi in September 2018. It will support rehabilitation and reconstruction of education 
facilities, water supply treatment and distribution facilities, water resources infrastructure, ports, 
and airport. All infrastructure will be built to higher standards of disaster resilience.   
2. 
The EARR has two components, the first component is under the Ministry of Public Works 
and  Housing  and  the second  component  is  under  the  Ministry  of Transportation.   This  Project 
Management Consultancy is intended to support the first component. 
3. 
Ministry of Public Work and Housing (MPWH) through the Directorate General of Water 
Resources (DGWR)  is the  Executing  Agency  of  the  EARR  and  Directorate General  of  Human 
Settlement (DGHS) and Directorate General of Water Resources (DGHS) are the Implementing 
Agencies.  The Project Implementation Units (PIUs) are River Basin Organization (Balai Wilayah 
Sungai)  Sulawesi  III  (BWSS  III)  and  Central  Sulawesi  Settlement  Infrastructure  Agency.    The 
MPWH  will  establish  a  steering  committee  to  guide  and  monitor  the  EARR’s  overall 
implementation and ensure that the Project can be completed on time and within the available 
budget.  The DGWR has established a Central Project Management Unit (CPMU), headed by the 
Director of Water Resources Development, which will have a Project Manager to be responsible 
for managing the CPMU activities, project planning and implementation management, preparation 
of  progress  reports,  and  ensuring  that  ADB  guidelines  are  complied.  The  CPMU  will  have  full 
coordination with the PIUs in Central Sulawesi. 
To support the CPMU, a qualified Project Management Consultant (PMC) team is sought 
4. 
to: (i)  provide day to day management support to the CPMU in leading and coordinate EARR 
activities,  (ii)  closely  monitor  project  implementation  activities  and  provide  technical  and 
management advice to the PIUs, (iii) assist the CPMU to determine annual works program, (iv) 
ensure  compliance  with  loan  covenants,  ADB’s  policies,  social  and  environmental  safeguards 
requirements,  procurement  procedures,  performance  indicators,  physical  achievements  and 
expenditures and preparation, and (v) maintain EARR account, prepare withdrawal applications 
(WA) including retention of supporting documents and submit the WAs (through MOF) to ADB (vi) 
consolidate  quarterly  and  annual  reports,  including  safeguards  and  audited  annual  project 
financial statements and ensure timely submission of various reports to all stakeholders including 
ADB.
