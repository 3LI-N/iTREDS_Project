Incorporating lessons from Project 1, Project 2 for $60.16 million will fund a combination of structural and nonstructural measures in
the three subproject areas (Palasbari-Gumi, Kaziranga, and Dibrugarh) along the Brahmaputra River in Assam. The structural
measures will include: (i) 20 kilometers (km) of riverbank protection works with innovative technologies, combined with 5 km of
pro-siltation measures; (ii) upgrade of 13 km of flood embankments; and (iii) construction of four sluice gates and one pumping
station to improve drainage. Monitoring and adaptive maintenance of the infrastructure will also be included to cope with the highly
dynamic morphological processes of the river. The nonstructural measures will continue the methodologies used under Project 1
and cover community involvement and community-based flood risk management activities.
Impact: Economic vulnerability and social disruption caused by flood and riverbank erosion risks in Assam reduced.
Outcome: Resilience to flood and riverbank erosion risks in selected flood-prone areas along the Brahmaputra River increased.
Outputs: (i) Institutional and knowledge-based flood and riverbank erosion risk management (FRERM) planning strengthened, (ii)
Comprehensive FRERM structural and nonstructural measures developed, implemented and maintained in three subproject areas,
and (iii) Multidisciplinary investment program management strengthened.
Implementation Arrangements: Flood and River Erosion Management Agency of Assam will be the executing agency.
Project Readiness: Project readiness is high. All designs and bid documents for the civil works and goods packages were
completed and all contracts awarded between May and October 2018. Environmental and social safeguards were assessed in
accordance with ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) and government requirements: (i) initial environment examination of
each of the three subprojects were updated; (ii) environment-related statutory clearances for the three subprojects are in place; and
(iii) implementation of the resettlement plans was initiated and affected persons will be fully compensated before any physical or
economic displacement.

11. Significant Developments in the MFF and Previous Tranches
There was no change in the policy framework affecting the viability or sustainability of the investment program and no changes in
the types of investments. The availability period of the MFF was extended to 18 October 2020 to achieve the outcome of the MFF.
The MFF performance rating is "on track."
Project 1 (Loan 2684) financed (i) community-based flood risk management activities in 32 vulnerable villages; (ii) development of a
flood forecasting model, and a flood and erosion management draft plan; (iii) 8 km of riverbank erosion protection works; and (iv) 15
km of construction or renovation of embankments. The newly built infrastructure performed well during the heavy floods of the 2017
flood season making the upgraded embankment at Dibrugarh the new standard for the entire state.
Project 1 significantly helped to strengthen FRERM in Assam and followed an adaptive approach of stabilizing naturally developed
riverbank lines to minimize the impacts of the highly dynamic morphological processes of the river. The structural measures built
included innovative cost-effective riverbank protection technologies using sand-filled geotextile bags and flow-retarding screens,
and progressive knowledge development. Project 2 will use the same design principles and construction methods except for minor
changes and improvements in design and materials to factor in the lessons from Project 1.
Project 1 was completed on 31 July 2017 and closed on 27 February 2018. Contract awards totaled $46.2 million and
disbursements totaled $42.0 million. The safeguard requirements were satisfactorily met and all covenants and undertaking were
complied. Despite its slow initial progress, the overall performance was satisfactory and rated "on track."
