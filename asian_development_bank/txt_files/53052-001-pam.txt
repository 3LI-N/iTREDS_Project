Project Administration Manual Purpose and Process 
1.  The  project  administration  manual  (PAM)  describes  the  essential  administrative  and 
management requirements to implement the project on time, within budget, and in accordance 
with the policies and procedures of the government and Asian Development Bank (ADB). The 
PAM should include references to all available templates and instructions either through linkages 
to relevant URLs or directly incorporated in the PAM. 
2.  The  Pingjiang  County  Government,  the  project  executing  agency;  and  Pingjiang  Project 
Management Office, the implementing agency, are wholly responsible for the implementation of 
ADB-financed projects, as agreed jointly between  the  borrower  and  ADB,  and  in accordance 
with  the  policies  and  procedures  of  the  government  and  ADB.  ADB  staff  is  responsible  for 
supporting  implementation  including  compliance  by  the  executing  agency  and  implementing 
agencies of their obligations and responsibilities for project implementation in accordance with 
ADB’s policies and procedures. 
3.  At loan negotiations, the borrower and ADB shall agree to the PAM and ensure consistency with 
the loan agreement. Such agreement shall be reflected in the minutes of the loan negotiations. 
In the event of any discrepancy or contradiction between the PAM and the loan agreement, the 
provisions of the loan agreement shall prevail. 
4.  After ADB Board approval of the project's report and recommendations of the President (RRP), 
changes in implementation arrangements are subject to agreement and approval pursuant to 
relevant government and ADB administrative procedures (including the Project Administration 
Instructions) and upon such approval, they will be subsequently incorporated in the PAM. 
I.  PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
1. 
The  proposed  project  will  promote  rural  vitalization  and  ecological  protection  by  (i) 
instituting  and  applying  international  best  practices  for  flood  and  integrated  disaster  risk 
management; (ii) improving access to safe drinking water and sanitation services for urban and 
rural  residents; (iii)  promoting  circular  agricultural  development  by  linking  sustainable  livestock 
waste  management  and  eco-farming; 
(iv)  piloting  green  procurement  practices  and 
mainstreaming environmental education; and (v) enhancing institutional coordination capacity to 
maximize the project impact. The project is envisaged to serve as a model for counties facing 
climate change and ecological pressures in the Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB), other parts 
of the People’s Republic of China (PRC), and other developing member countries. The project 
leverages  cofinancing  from  German  development  cooperation  through  KfW  and  counterpart 
financing from the Pingjiang County Government (PCG). 
2. 
Impact and outcome. The project is aligned with the following impact: rural vitalization 
and ecological protection in the YREB realized.1 The project will have the following outcome: rural 
living environment in Pingjiang County improved. 
3. 
Outputs. The project will deliver four major outputs to address the key constraints. 
Output  1:  Water-related  disaster  risk  management  strengthened.  This  output  will 
4. 
mitigate  the  potential  impact  of  flooding  on  people’s  livelihoods  and  property,  and  the  socio-
economic consequences resulting from flood events. This output includes (i) construction of 38.9 
kilometers (km) of ecological embankment and/or riverbank reinforcement in 12 towns along Miluo 
River in Pingjiang County to control flooding events; (ii) establishment of riparian buffers from the 
edge of riverbank by using nature-based solutions to control water and soil losses; (iii) restoration 
and  protection  of  Huangjin  River  National  Wetland  Park  to  enhance  biodiversity  conservation, 
increase flood storage and water quality purification capacity as well as to promote environmental 
education;  and  (iv)  establishment  of  an  integrated  smart  disaster  risk  management  system  for 
early warning to inform disaster-related decision-making and improved institutional coordination. 
5. 
Output  2:  Access  to  safe  drinking  water  and  sanitation  services  enhanced.  This 
output will improve the quality of life for both urban and rural communities in Pingjiang County. 
This output includes (i) construction of a drinking water supply plant and supply of safe drinking 
water  to  107  villages  in  14  towns;  (ii)  separation  of  rainwater  from  sewers  in  urban  and  rural 
Pingjiang County to prevent the overflow of sewer systems during rainy periods; (iii) establishment 
of  concentrated  rural  wastewater  treatment  services  for  rural  households  in  21  villages  of  12 
towns and public facilities (in 136 schools and 26 health clinics); and (iv) upgrading of rural toilets 
for 59,732 households and connecting these to wastewater collection systems in 464 villages of 
24 towns. Items (i)–(iii) will be undertaken by KfW through parallel co-financing. In conjunction, 
the  government  shall  provide  assistance  to  poor  and  low-income  households,  such  as  partial 
exemption from water pipe connection fee and water tariff and sewage treatment tariff increase. 
6. 
Output 3: Circular agriculture for sustainable livestock waste management and eco-
farming  demonstrated.  This  output  will  demonstrate  circular  agricultural  practices  in  the 
management  of  livestock  waste  and  produce  organic  fertilizer  for  eco-farming  demonstration 
farms,  to  reduce  greenhouse  gas  emissions,  enhance  soil  fertility,  increase  crop  yield  and 
sustainability.  This  output  includes  (i)  carrying  out  livestock  waste  treatment  in  livestock  farms 
prior to soil application, to significantly reduce non-point source pollution into waterbody; and (ii)

IV.  COSTS AND FINANCING 
A. 
Cost Estimates Preparation and Revisions  
Preparation.  The  transaction  technical  assistance  (TRTA)  consultants  worked  closely 
10. 
with  the  design  institutes  for  preparing  the  cost  estimates  following  the  national  government’s 
guidelines on preparing the cost estimates and ADB’s guide note on Preparing and Presenting 
Cost Estimates for Projects Financed by the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The electronic file 
in Microsoft excel format was retained at the project management office (PMO) under PCG and 
by the ADB Project Officer. 
11. 
Revisions.  The  PMO,  with  the  assistance  of  the  design  institutes,  will  revise  the  cost 
estimates  under  the  guidance  of  the  ADB  Project  Officer  during  implementation  based  on  the 
request for project cost reallocation and ADB’s subsequent approval. During the midterm review, 
the project cost will be re-estimated and compared with the project cost at appraisal.

computed at 7.7% of base cost. Price contingencies computed at -0.5% for 2020, 1.6% for 2021, 1.7% for 2022 and 
2023, and 1.8% for 2024 and thereafter on foreign exchange costs, and 3.6% for 2020, 1.9% for 2021, and 2.2% for 
2022 and thereafter on local currency. Contingencies include provision for potential exchange rate fluctuation under 
the assumption of the purchasing power parity exchange rate. 
d   Includes interests for ADB loan and KfW loan. For ADB loan, interest during construction for the ordinary capital 
resources was computed at the 7-year fixed swap rate for Euro plus an effective contractual spread of 0.5% and 
maturity premium of 0.2%. For KfW loan, interest during construction for promotional loan was computed at 5-year 
fixed swap rate for euro plus a margin of 0.7%.

The Government of the PRC has requested a loan of €126,882,000 (equivalent to $150 
14. 
million) from ADB’s ordinary capital resources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 30-
year term, including a grace period of 7 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance 
with ADB’s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge 
of  0.15%  per year;  and such  other terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in the draft  loan and  project 
agreements.  Based  on  the  straight-line  method,  the  average  maturity  is  18.75  years,  and  the 
maturity premium payable to ADB is 0.2% per year. The government will relend the loan proceeds 
through  Hunan  Provincial  Government  (HPG)  to  PCG  upon  the  same  terms  and  conditions 
applicable to the loan. PCG will bear the foreign exchange and interest rate variation risks of the 
loan proceeds. KfW will provide parallel co-financing (covering Output 2) through a promotional 
loan  with  tenure  of  up  to  15  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years,  with  other  conditions 
outlined in a project-specific memorandum of understanding to be signed between ADB and KfW 
by  November  2020  and  loan  agreement  between  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  KfW  which  is 
expected to be approved by March 2021.

V.  FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT 
D. 
Financial Management Assessment 
The financial management assessment (FMA) was conducted from January to July 2020 
17. 
in  accordance  with  ADB’s  Guidelines.3 The  FMA  considered  the  capacity  of  the  implementing 
agency  (PMO),  including  funds-flow  arrangements,  staffing,  accounting  and  financial  reporting 
systems, financial information systems, and internal and external auditing arrangements. Based 
on the assessment, the key financial management risks identified are: (i) implementation risk – 
PMO  lacks familiarity  with ADB  disbursement  procedures  and  requirements  which could  delay 
project  implementation,  (ii)  compliance  risk  –  PMO  lacks  familiarity  with  ADB  financial 
management requirements, particularly on accounting, reporting and auditing, which may delay 
project reporting and identification of issues on the use of loan proceeds; (iii) foreign exchange 
risk  –  PMO  lacks  experience  in  managing  foreign  exchange  that  might  increase  the  financial 
burden  to  the  potential  depreciation  of  Chinese  Yuan.  The  overall  pre-mitigation  financial 
management  risk  of  implementing  agency  is  substantial.  PCG  and  PMO  have  agreed  to 
implement an action plan as key measures to address the deficiencies.  
The  identified  financial  management  risks  will  be  closely  monitored  during  project 
18. 
implementation. The financial management action plan is provided in Table 15.

PCG  and  PMO  will  enhance  their  coordination  and  capabilities  by  (i)  setting  clear 
19. 
institutional  arrangements,  (ii)  recruiting  a  financial  management  consultant;  (iii)  undertaking 
training on ADB’s disbursement and financial management requirements for all staff, particularly 
financial  staff;  (iv)  developing  financial  management  manual  for  the  budgeting,  accounting, 
internal  controls,  reporting  and  auditing  arrangements  in  line  with  project  activities;  and                         
(v)  streamlining  of  approval  processes  for  the  use  of  the  loan  proceeds,  including  setting  up 
revolving fund to pre-financed the expenditure portion to be financed by ADB and KfW loans. In 
addition, frequent monitoring by PCG’s agencies can help mitigate the risk of lack of internal audit 
function.  With  these  appropriate  mitigation  measures,  the  project  financial  management 
arrangements are considered satisfactory. 
E.  Disbursement 
1. 
Disbursement Arrangements for ADB Funds 
The  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  Loan  Disbursement 
20. 
Handbook  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time), 4 and  detailed  arrangements  agreed  upon 
between the government and ADB. Online training for project staff on disbursement policies and 
procedures  is  available.5 Project  staff  are  encouraged  to  avail  of  this  training  to  help  ensure 
efficient disbursement and fiduciary control. 
21. 
PMO  will  (i)  prepare  withdrawal  applications  (WAs)  and  submit  them  to  ADB  through 
Hunan  Provincial  Department  of  Finance  (PDOF);  and  (ii)  collect  and  retain  all  supporting 
documents. At the end of each year, PMO will prepare realistic projections of contract awards and

handbook

disbursements for the following year and submit them to ADB. 
22. 
Advance fund procedure. On behalf of HPG, an advance account in loan currency will 
be  set  up  for  the  project  by  PDOF  in  a  commercial  bank.  PDOF  will  be  responsible  for  the 
management, monitoring, and reconciliation of the advance account. The PDOF, who administers 
the advance account is accountable and responsible for proper use of advances to the advance 
account.  
The total outstanding advance to the advance account should not exceed the estimate of 
23. 
ADB’s  share  of  expenditures  to  be  paid  through  the  advance  account  for  the  forthcoming  6 
months. The executing agency, through PDOF, may request for initial and additional advances to 
the  advance  account  based  on  an  Estimate  of  Expenditure  Sheet6 setting  out  the  estimated 
expenditures  to  be  financed  through  the  account  for  the  forthcoming  6  months.  Supporting 
documents should be submitted to ADB or retained by the PDOF and/or PCG (through PMO) in 
accordance  with  ADB’s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time) 
when liquidating or replenishing the advance account. 
Statement  of  expenditure  procedure. 7  The  SOE  procedure  may  be  used  for 
24. 
reimbursement  of  eligible  expenditures  or  liquidation  of  advances  to  the  advance  account. 
Supporting  documents  and  records  for  the  expenditures  claimed  under  the  SOE  should  be 
maintained and made readily available for review by ADB's disbursement and review missions, 
upon  ADB's  request  for  submission  of  supporting  documents  on  a  sampling  basis,  and  for 
independent audit. 
Before  the  submission  of  the  first  WA,  the  borrower  should  submit  to  ADB  sufficient 
25. 
evidence of the authority of the person(s) who will sign the  WAs on behalf of the government, 
together with the authenticated specimen signatures of each authorized person. The minimum 
value per WA is stipulated in the Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to 
time). Individual payments below such amount should be paid (i) by the executing agency and 
subsequently claimed to ADB through reimbursement, or (ii) through the advance fund procedure, 
unless otherwise accepted  by ADB. The borrower should ensure sufficient category and contract 
balances before requesting disbursements. Use of ADB’s Client Portal for Disbursements (CPD)8 
system is encouraged for submission of WAs to ADB. 
2. 
Disbursement Arrangements for Counterpart Fund 
The PMO will prepare disbursement projections and request budget allocations from PCG 
26. 
for counterpart funds. PCG will allocate the counterpart from its budget resources in line with its 
budget regulations and procedures. PCG may also obtain financial support from the provincial 
and  national  governments  through  various  comprehensive  agricultural  development,  flood 
control, environmental and water resources improvements. 
F.  Accounting 
27. 
The PCG and PMO will maintain, or cause to be maintained, separate books and records 
6  Estimate  of  Expenditure  sheet  is  available  in  Appendix  8A  of  ADB’s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2017,  as 
amended from time to time).  
7  SOE forms are available in Appendix 7B and 7D of ADB’s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from 
time to time). 
8 The CPD facilitates online submission of WA to ADB, resulting in faster disbursement. The forms to be completed by 
the Borrower are available online at https://www.adb.org/documents/client-portal-disbursements-guide.     
25 
by funding  source  for  all  expenditures  incurred  on  the  project  following  the  equivalent  national 
accounting standards; and (ii) prepare annual financial statements for the project in accordance 
with  the  government's  accounting  laws  and  regulations  which  are  consistent  with  international 
accounting principles and practices. 
G.  Auditing and Public Disclosure 
28. 
The PCG will cause the detailed consolidated project financial statements to be audited in 
accordance with International Standards on Auditing and the national auditing standards by an 
independent auditor acceptable to ADB. The audited project financial statements together with 
the auditor’s opinion will be presented in the English language to ADB within 6 months from the 
end of the fiscal year by the executing agency. 
29. 
The audit report for the project financial statements will include a management letter and 
auditor’s opinions, which cover (i) whether the project financial statements present an accurate 
and fair view or are presented fairly, in all material respects, in accordance with the applicable 
financial  reporting  standards;  (ii)  whether  the  proceeds  of  the  loan  were  used  only  for  the 
purpose(s) of the project; and (iii) whether the borrower or executing agency was in compliance 
with the financial covenants contained in the legal agreements (where applicable). 
Compliance with financial reporting and auditing requirements will be monitored by review 
30. 
missions and during normal program supervision, and followed up regularly with all concerned, 
including the external auditor.  
The government, PCG and PMO have been made aware of ADB’s approach to delayed

submission, and the requirements for satisfactory and acceptable quality of the audited project 
financial  statements.9 ADB  reserves  the  right  to  require  a  change  in  the  auditor  (in  a  manner 
consistent with the constitution of the borrower), or for additional support to be provided to the 
auditor, if the audits required are not conducted in a manner satisfactory to ADB, or if the audits 
are  substantially  delayed.  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  verify  the  project's  financial  accounts  to 
confirm  that  the  share  of  ADB’s  financing  is  used  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  policies  and 
procedures.  
32. 
Public disclosure of the audited project financial statements, including the auditor’s opinion 
on the project financial statements, will be guided by ADB’s Access to Information Policy 2018.10 
After the review, ADB will disclose the audited project financial statements and the opinion of the 
auditors on the project financial statements no later than 14 days of ADB’s confirmation of their 
acceptability by posting them on ADB’s website. The management letter and additional auditor’s 
opinions will not be disclosed.
9 ADB’s approach and procedures regarding delayed submission of audited project financial statements:  
(i)  When audited project financial statements are not received by the due date, ADB will write to the executing 
agency advising that (a) the audit documents are overdue; and (b) if they are not received within the next 6 
months, requests for new contract awards and disbursement such as new replenishment of advance accounts, 
processing of new reimbursement, and issuance of new commitment letters will not be processed. 
(ii)  When  audited  project  financial  statements  are  not  received  within  6  months  after  the  due  date,  ADB  will 
withhold processing of requests for new contract awards and disbursement such as new replenishment of 
advance accounts, processing of new reimbursement, and issuance of new commitment letters. ADB will (a) 
inform the executing agency of ADB’s actions; and (b) advise that the loan may be suspended if the audit 
documents are not received within the next 6 months. 
(iii)  When audited project financial statements  are not received within 12 months after the due date, ADB may 
suspend the loan.

VI.  PROCUREMENT AND CONSULTING SERVICES 
A.  Project Procurement Risk Assessment 
A project procurement risk assessment was conducted in accordance with the Guidance 
33. 
Note on Procurement Risk Framework (2018, as amended from time to time)11 and the Guidance 
Note on Strategic Procurement Planning (2018, as amended from time to time).12 Overall project 
procurement risk is moderate before mitigation measures to be taken. 
34. 
According to the assessment, the main strengths identified include: (i) PMO has existing 
Procurement  Division  consisting  of  5  full-time  staff  with  adequate  background  and  practical 
experiences; (ii) PMO has procurement regulations and procedures based on the Tendering and 
Bidding  Law  (TBL);  (iii)  PMO  has  9  staff,  which  were  assigned  by  PIUs,  with  professional 
background to support the technical designs, as well as the technical related in the preparation of 
bidding  documents;  and  (iv)  The  PMO  will  recruit  experienced  procurement  agent  and  project 
management consulting firm  to  support  the  procurement  and  contract management  during  the 
project implementation. The main weaknesses identified include: (i) PMO has no internationally 
financed project experience, (ii) PMO does not have staff with professional background in green 
procurement,  and (iii)  There  is  no  specialized  structured  procurement  training  program  for  the 
staff involved in undertaking procurement.  
35. 
Proposed mitigation measures include training to be provided to relevant staff of the PMO 
and other stakeholder agencies. Some procurement training was delivered by ADB Procurement 
Specialist  and  TRTA  consultants  during  the  project  preparation  to  the  PMO  on  topics  in  ADB 
procedures  for  procurement  of  goods,  works  and  consulting  services  to  ensure  that  the  non-
familiarity with ADB procurement framework has been addressed. The procurement training will 
be delivered on a well-defined interval by the PICs during the project implementation to ensure 
that procurement activities are undertaken in full conformity with ADB Procurement Policy and 
Procurement Regulations (2017, as amended from time to time). To achieve value for money, at 
the  strategic  procurement  planning  (SPP)  stage,  market  conditions,  operational  context,  client 
capability, contract duration and timing, previous  experience, risks present, and all appropriate 
procurement modalities and bidding arrangements have been considered. Furthermore, chances 
for conducting advertisement through Yueyang Municipal e-procurement Public Resources Trade 
Center (PRTC) will be reviewed before the first advertisement. 
36. 
Strategic procurement planning (SPP, Appendix 4) was carried out to identify procurement 
risks,  develop  mitigating  measures,  review  procurement  options,  and  agree  on  fit-for-purpose 
procurement  arrangements.  Value  for money  will  be  achieved through  assigning  dedicated  in-
house PMO staff as green procurement focal, applying community participation approach for eco-
farming,  assigning  early  start-up  consulting  as  non-banked  financed  packages  to  ensure 
mobilization  efficiency,  advance  contracting  for  the  ADB-financed  project  management  and 
capacity building consulting services to ensure proper capacity building and technical guidance 
since early implementation stage, the use of request for quotations modalities for standard readily 
available  goods  with  low  quality  risk,  the  use  of  point  scoring  system  for  design,  build  and 
equipment supply of the exhibition center packages as well as clean delineation of ADB and KfW 
funded packages to avoid dual agencies procurement review on the same package.

B.  Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing 
37. 
All  advance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  will  be  undertaken  in  conformity  with 
ADB  Procurement  Policy:  Goods,  works,  Nonconsulting  and  Consulting  Services  (2017,  as 
amended from time to time)13 and Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers: Goods, works, 
Nonconsulting and Consulting Services (2017, as amended from time to time).14 The issuance of 
invitations  to  bid  under  advance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  will  be  subject  to  ADB 
approval.  Advanced  contracting  for  the  project  management  and  capacity  building  consulting 
services (Contract package No.: CS-TA-01) has been proposed under the project. The borrower, 
executing and implementing agencies have been advised that approval of advance contracting 
and retroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance the project. 
Retroactive  financing  will  apply  to  the  urgent  procurement  of  civil  works,  goods  and 
38. 
consulting services. Retroactive financing will be subject to a maximum amount equivalent to 20% 
of the loan amount for eligible expenditures incurred prior to loan effectiveness, but not earlier 
than 12 months before the loan agreement is signed. 
C.  Procurement of Goods, Works, and Consulting Services 
39. 
All procurement of ADB financed works and goods will be undertaken in accordance with 
ADB  Procurement  Policy:  Goods,  works,  Nonconsulting  and  Consulting  Services  (2017,  as 
amended  from  time  to  time)  and  Procurement  Regulations for  ADB  Borrowers:  Goods,  works, 
Nonconsulting and Consulting Services (2017, as amended from time to time).  
Before  the  start  of  any  procurement,  ADB  and  the  government  will  review  the  public 
40. 
procurement  laws  of  the  central  and  state  governments  to  ensure  consistency  with  ADB’s 
Procurement Policy and Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers. 
An  18-month  procurement  plan  indicating  procurement  method,  cost  estimation,  and 
41. 
review procedures for goods, works, nonconsulting and consulting service contract packages and 
guidelines on open competitive bidding (OCB) with national advertising is in Section C. 
1.  Open Competitive Bidding for Goods and Works 
42. 
OCB will be used for most of the ADB financed contract packages for works and goods. If 
a bidding attracts foreign companies, the bidding document will be written in English using the 
latest ADB standard bidding document for OCB advertised internationally packages, which can 
be downloaded from ADB website. If a bidding does not attract foreign companies, the following 
provisions  will  be  applied:  (i) the  advertisement will  be  limited  to the  national  press,  an  official 
gazette,  or  an  open  access  website;  (ii)  standard  bidding  documents  for  OCB  advertised 
nationally packages issued by the Ministry of Finance will be used; and (iii) bidding documents 
will only be in Chinese (except for contracts which require ADB’s prior review and approval), and 
the currency for bidding and payment will be in Chinese Yuan (CNY). If a bidding document is 
internationally advertised, the invitations for bids need to be submitted to ADB at latest 1 week 
before the advertisement for parallel advertisement in Business Opportunities of ADB’s website. 
Unless  otherwise  agreed  between  PCG  and  ADB  and  set  forth  in  the  procurement  plan, 
procurements under OCB will use the single-stage one-envelope procedure except the contract 
package for exhibition center contract package (EE-CW03). The point scoring system for design, 
13 Available at: https://www.adb.org/documents/adb-procurement-policy 
14 Available at: https://www.adb.org/documents/procurement-regulations-adb-borrowers 
28 
build and equipment supply of the exhibition center contract package (EE-CW03) will be applied 
to  incorporate  concept  design  submission  as  part  of  technical  proposal  evaluation  given  the 
quality of design is important to the public awareness objective and legacy of the project. Single-
stage two-envelope procedure for this contract package will be applied. 
2. 
Consulting Services 
43. 
All ADB financed individual consultants, consulting firms, and monitoring agencies will be 
recruited  according  to  ADB’s  Procurement  Policy  and  Procurement  Regulations  for  ADB 
Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time). The indicative terms of reference are included 
in Appendices 1-3. 
An estimated 27 person-months for project start-up individual consultants (ICs) and 150 
44. 
person-months  of  consulting  services  (advance  contracting  will  be  applied)  are  required  to  (i) 
facilitate  project  management  and  implementation,  and  (ii)  strengthen  the  institutional  and 
operational capacity of the executing and implementing agencies. An external resettlement and 
social  monitoring  and  evaluation  agency  will  be  recruited  to  conduct  regular  monitoring  of  the 
implementation of the Resettlement Plan (RP) and Land Use Right Transfer (LURT) Framework. 
ICs will be recruited prior to loan effectiveness through the domestic counterpart funds. Consulting 
firms will be engaged using the quality- and cost-based selection (QCBS) method with a quality–
cost ratio of 90:10 or Consultants’ Qualifications Selection (CQS) method. 
3. 
Community Participation in Procurement 
To  ensure  sustainability  and  to  achieve  the  social  objectives  of  the  project,  community 
45. 
participation approach will be used. Civil works for Eco-Farming Demonstration Subproject and 
Environmental Education Subproject will be contracted out to the communities (farmers, village 
committees,  farmer  cooperatives,  agricultural  enterprises  and/or  forestry  enterprises,  and 
schools)  based  on  community  participation  implementation  agreements (CPIA)  between  PMO, 
PIUs  (Bureau  of  Forestry  or  Bureau  of  Agriculture  and  Rural  Affairs)  and  communities,  and  in 
compliance with the requirements for community participation in procurement in accordance with 
ADB Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers: Goods, works, Nonconsulting and Consulting 
Services  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Specific  procedures  for  contracting  local 
communities under community participation, and a draft CPIA are included as Appendix 5, the 
detailed design of facilities to be constructed, clear duties and responsibilities of each party for 
the  project  activities,  quality  control,  project  acceptance  standards  and  funds  payment  are 
included. The first CPIA will be submitted to ADB for prior review before its implementation. 
4. 
ADB’s Prior Review and Post Review (Sampling) 
Following the ADB Procurement Review: Guidance Note on Procurement (June 2018, as 
46. 
amended from time to time),15 for (i) all ADB-financed contracts with advance contracting, and (ii) 
the first ADB-financed contract of each type (OCB advertised internationally or nationally) for civil 
works and goods, ADB’s prior review and approval of the following documents (if applicable) will 
be required: invitation for bids, bidding document and relevant clarification and addendum (if any), 
bid evaluation report, draft negotiated contract, signed contract, and contract variations.  
47. 
To avoid procurement risks, ADB’s prior review is applicable to the first package of each 
type  of  procurement  category for  each  subproject,  along with  integrated  disaster management 
15 Available at: https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/procurement-review.pdf.  
29 
system and the design, build and equipment supply of exhibition center will be subject to prior 
review of ADB, and all ADB-financed consulting service contracts should be applicable with prior 
review, based on the procurement risk assessment and strategic procurement planning. 
For OCB packages under post review (sampling), (i) ADB’s prior approval of the invitation 
48. 
for bids, bidding document, bid evaluation report, and draft negotiated contract (if applicable) will 
not be necessary, as long as the first type of OCB bidding document approved by ADB is used 
as the master bidding document without substantial modification; (ii) procurement process can be 
conducted without ADB’s prior approval (if a bidding document is internationally advertised, the 
invitations for bids need to be submitted to ADB at latest one week before the advertisement for 
parallel  advertisement  in  Business  Opportunities  of  ADB’s  website);  (iii)  after  the  contract  is 
signed,  the  issued  invitation  for  bids,  issued  bidding  document  and  relevant  clarification  and 
addendum  (if  any),  bid  evaluation  report,  screenshot  of  bid  evaluation  result  publication, 
notification of contract award, and signed contract (if applicable) needs to be submitted to ADB 
for review and approval; and (iv) noncompliance in procurement may be determined by ADB for 
procurement 
incompliant  with  ADB  Procurement  Policy  and  Procurement 
Regulations  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Remedial  actions  must  be  taken  by  the 
borrower and sub-borrowers. 
transactions

VII.  SAFEGUARDS 
72. 
Prohibited  investment  activities.  Pursuant  to  ADB’s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement 
(2009),  ADB  funds  may  not  be  applied  to  the  activities  described  on  the  ADB  Prohibited 
Investment Activities List set forth at Appendix 5 of the Safeguard Policy Statement (2009).  
A. 
Environment 
Institutional  arrangements.  The  project  is  classified  by  ADB  as  Category  B  for 
73. 
environment.  The  project  environmental  safeguard  assessments  and  documents  comprise  an 
initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  including  an  environmental  management  plan  (EMP; 
Attachment 1 of the IEE). The EMP covers all project components. The IEE and EMP have been 
prepared in compliance with ADB’s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). For all project matters 
relating  to  environmental  safeguards,  the  EMP  forms  the  basis  of  the  official  loan  agreement 
between ADB and the executing agency.  
Content  of  the  EMP.  The  EMP  describes  (i)  the  project  environmental  safeguard 
74. 
objectives,  (ii)  roles  and  responsibilities  for  EMP  implementation,  (iii)  mitigation  measures,  (iv) 
inspection, monitoring, and reporting arrangements, (v) training and institutional strengthening, 
(vi)  a  project-specific  grievance  redress  mechanism,  (vii)  public  consultation  during  project 
implementation,  and (viii)  a  feedback  and  adjustment  mechanism.  The  EMP  identifies  specific 
roles and responsibilities for all agencies that will be involved in EMP implementation, including 
the  PCG,  implementing  agencies,  contractors,  construction  supervision  companies,  and 
operators  of  project  facilities.  The  mitigation  measures  are  tailored  to  the  project-specific 
conditions and risks identified in the IEE. The scope and content of the EMP comply with ADB’s 
Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) for environmental safeguards and the PRC’s environmental 
laws and regulations. All project agencies are required to comply with the EMP. 
EMP implementation. The EMP will be implemented in all phases of the project: design, 
75. 
pre-construction, construction, and operation. The PCG will be responsible for ensuring that the 
project will be designed, constructed, decommissioned, and operated in accordance with (i) the 
national and local government environmental, health, and safety laws, regulations, procedures, 
and guidelines; (ii) the ADB’s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), and (iii) the IEE including the 
EMP.  The  executing  agency,  through  the  PMO,  holds  final responsibility  for  implementation  of 
and compliance with the EMP. 
For  finalization  of  the  preliminary  engineering  designs,  and  preparation  of  the  detailed 
76. 
engineering  designs  for  the  project,  the  PMO  will  forward  the  EMP  to  the  engineering  and 
environmental  design  institutes  responsible  for  each  subproject.  The  PMO  and  implementing 
agency  environment  officers  will  work  with  the  design  institutes  to  ensure  that  safeguard  risks 
identified in the EMP are considered in the detailed designs and avoided, minimized, or mitigated. 
The EMP will be updated at the end of the detailed design, as needed. To ensure that bidders will 
respond to the EMPs provisions, the PMO and implementing agencies will prepare and provide 
the  following  specification  clauses  for  incorporation  into  the  bidding  documents:  (i)  a  list  of 
environmental management requirements to be budgeted by the bidders in their proposals; (ii) 
environmental clauses for contractual terms and conditions; and (iii) the domestic environmental 
assessments, and the project IEE including the updated EMP for compliance. All tenders involving 
civil  works  will  be  required  to  include  and  fully  address  the  EMP  requirements,  especially  the 
mitigation and monitoring measures. 
77. 
Personnel. The EMP will be coordinated by the following personnel: (i) at least one full-
42 
time and qualified PMO environment officer, who will be appointed by the PCG. The officer will 
be  responsible  for  overall  coordination  of  the  EMP;  (ii)  at  least  12  full-time  social-and-
environmental  safeguard  officers  within  the  project  implementation  units  (PIUs),  who  will  be 
appointed  by  the  county  and  district  implementing  agencies.  These  officers  will  lead  the  daily 
coordination of the EMP at the site level and will coordinate closely with the PMO environment 
officer. The 12 positions will be assigned as follows: (i) for five PIUs, a minimum of two social-
and-environmental safeguard officers per PIU, reflecting the wide geographic spread and/or large 
number  of  work  sites  under  subprojects:  the  Housing  and  Urban-Rural  Development  Bureau 
(PIU–Subproject 5), Ecology and Environment Bureau (PIU–Subproject 6), Livestock, Fisheries 
and  Agricultural  Machinery  Affairs  Center  (PIU–Subproject  7),  and,  Forestry  Bureau  (PIU–
Subproject 2; part of Subproject 8–eco-farming – oil tea component); (ii) for two PIUs, a minimum 
of one social-and-environmental safeguard officer per PIU will be assigned, reflecting the lower 
scope of civil works: the Agriculture and Rural Affairs Bureau (PIU–Subproject 8) and Pingjiang 
County  Water  Supply  Co.,  Ltd  (PIU–Subproject  4).  For  three  PIUs  (Education  Bureau,  PIU–
Subproject  9;  Emergency  Management  Bureau,  PIU–Subproject  3;  and  Natural  Resources 
Bureau, PIU–Subproject 3) no social-and-environmental safeguard officers are required, due to 
a lack of civil works under these PIUs. 
78. 
The PMO environment officer and PIU social-and-environmental safeguard officers will be 
supported  in  their  roles  by:  (i)  a  loan  implementation  start-up  consultant  (environment).  The 
consultant will assist the PMO to establish the EMP in the early phases of implementation, before 
a full suite of loan implementation consulting services are engaged (see next point); (ii) a loan 
implementation  environment  consultant  (LIEC),  as  part  of  the  loan  consulting  services.  The 
consultant will support the PMO and implementing agency staff to establish and implement the 
EMP, including to: assess whether the detailed engineering designs are consistent with the scope 
of  the  preliminary  designs  and  EMP  or  whether  new  safeguard  assessments  are  required; 
integrate the EMP within the project bidding documents; visit work sites and liaise with contractors 
and  construction  supervision  companies;  and,  support  the  preparation  of  safeguard  progress 
reports; and (iii) a fish ecologist, to conduct a rapid assessment of fish conservation values in the 
river  sections  of  the  National  Pingjiang  Section  of  the  Miluo  River  Germplasm  Resources 
Protection Zone to be dredged. The consultant’s inputs will help inform the detailed engineering 
designs  for  the  dredging,  to  avoid,  minimize  and/or  mitigate  impacts  to  fish  resources.  All 
consulting positions are national positions. Terms of reference for the positions are provided in 
Appendix 1 for start-up consultants and Appendix 2 for technical support and project management 
in the PAM and Appendix 2 of the EMP. 
Capacity building. The PMO and implementing agencies have no previous experience 
79. 
with ADB-funded projects or safeguard requirements. To ensure effective implementation of the 
EMP, a capacity building program is included in the EMP for training of project agencies in EMP 
implementation,  mitigation  measures,  supervision,  monitoring,  reporting,  and  the  grievance 
redress mechanism. Training will be provided by the loan consultants for safeguards and other 
specialists in the loan consulting teams. Trainees will include the staff of the PMO, implementing 
agencies, contractors, and construction supervision companies. 
Procedures for feedback and adjustment of the EMP, including in the event of non-
80. 
compliance.  Based  on  site  inspections  and  monitoring  reports,  the  PMO  shall  decide,  in 
consultation  with  the  LIEC,  whether  (i)  further  mitigation  measures  are  required  as  corrective 
actions,  or  (ii)  improvements  are  required  for  environmental  management  practices.  The 
effectiveness  of  mitigation  measures  and  monitoring  plans  will  be  evaluated  by  a  feedback 
reporting  system.  Adjustment  to  the  EMP  will  be  made,  if  necessary.  The  PMO  environment 
officer,  PIU  social-and-environmental  safeguard officers,  and  LIEC  will  play  critical roles  in  the 
43 
feedback and adjustment mechanism. If during inspection and monitoring, substantial deviation 
from the EMP is observed, or any changes are made to the project that may cause substantial 
adverse  environmental  impacts  or  increase  the  number  of  affected  people,  then  the  PMO  will 
immediately consult with ADB and form an environmental assessment team to conduct additional 
environmental assessment. If necessary, further public consultation will be undertaken. A new or 
updated  domestic  environmental  assessment(s), and IEE  (including  an  EMP)  will  be  prepared 
and  submitted  to  ADB  for  review,  appraisal,  and  public  disclosure.  The  revised  EMP  will  be 
passed  to  the  contractors,  construction  supervision  consultants  (CSC)  and  operators  of  the 
project facilities, for implementation. 
81.  Monitoring and reporting for environmental safeguard. See Section IX of this PAM. 
Environmental  assurances.  Project-specific  environmental  safeguard  conditions  are 
82. 
included  in  the  loan  and  project  agreements  and  include  the  need  for  all  project  agencies  to 
comply with the EMP. 
B. 
Involuntary Resettlement 
83. 
Category  and  impacts.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  “B”  for  involuntary 
resettlement. The project does not involve significant land acquisition and resettlement impacts. 
The  project  will  involve  a  total  land  use  of  698.09  mu,  including  state-owned  land  occupation 
(SLO) of 527.85 mu, permanent land acquisition (PLA) of 170.24 mu. In addition, 1,219.4 mu land 
will  be  used  temporarily  during  construction.  A  total  of  3  houses  with  628.53  m2  area  will  be 
demolished, involving 3 households with 16 persons. A total of 64 households with 269 persons 
will be affected by the project’s permanent land acquisition; and among them 20 households with 
83 persons will be significantly affected. 
84. 
Resettlement  plan  (RP).  A  draft  RP  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  Safeguard  Policy 
Statement (2009) and relevant laws and regulations of the PRC has been prepared. The RP is 
based  on  feasibility  study  report,  social  surveys  and  consultations  with  affected  people;  and  it 
includes  (i)  adequate  measures  for  compensation,  resettlement,  and  rehabilitation  of  affected 
people; (ii) consultations with the affected people during the updating and implementation of the 
plan;  (iii)  a  grievance  redress  mechanism;  (iv)  implementation  arrangements,  funding  and 
capacity building; and (v) monitoring and reporting requirements. 
85. 
Updating RP. The RP will be (i) updated based on the final design, detailed measurement 
survey, and census of affected persons, (ii) disclosed to affected persons, and (iii) submitted to 
ADB for review and approval prior to the award of civil works contract and commencement of land 
acquisition and resettlement.  
Capacity building for implementation and monitoring of the resettlement plan. The 
86. 
PCG and PMO have the capacity to implement domestically funded projects. Their capacity will 
be  strengthened  to  implement  the  RP  in  compliance with ADB’s  requirements  through  several 
measures, including (i) PCG and implementing agencies will each appoint a social officer or focal 
staff;  (ii)  the  project  management  consultant  team  will  include  a  resettlement  specialist;  (iii) 
relevant  staff  of  PCG  and  implementing  agencies  will  be  trained  on  implementation  and 
monitoring of RP; (iv) the initial project management support consultant will provide training on 
ADB’s resettlement policy requirements, and will assist the PCG and implementing agencies to 
update the RP; and (iv) an external resettlement and social monitoring and evaluation agency will 
be recruited. 
44 
C. 
Ethnic Minorities 
87. 
There  are  no  concentrated  ethnic  minority  communities  or  villages  in  the  project  area. 
There are only 85 scattered ethnic minority population who moved to the project area because of 
marriage or work, and they will benefit from the project as residents. The project does not trigger 
indigenous peoples safeguards requirements set out in the ADB’s Safeguard Policy Statement 
(2009);  and  there  is  no  need  to  prepare  an  ethnic  minority  development  plan.  PCG  and 
implementing  agencies  will  ensure  that  the  project  does  not  impact  any  ethnic  minority 
communities  that  would  trigger  ADB’s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  requirements  on 
indigenous peoples. 
D. 
Grievance Redress Mechanism 
88. 
Two  project-specific  grievance  redress  mechanisms  (GRM),  one  for  environmental 
safeguards  and  one  for  social  safeguards,  have  been  developed  in  compliance  with  ADB’s 
Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  to  address  concerns  on  environment,  health,  safety,  and 
social  matters  associated  with  ADB-funded  projects.  The  GRMs  complement  and  build  upon 
existing  PRC  mechanisms  for  environmental  and  social  complaints,  respectively,  including 
existing national environmental complaint hotlines for environmental safeguards. The GRMs have 
been  designed  to  achieve  the  following  objectives:  (i)  provide  channels  of  communication  for 
communities to raise concerns about environmental and social grievances which might result from 
the  project;  (ii)  help  prevent  and  mitigate  adverse  environmental  and  social  impacts  to 
communities that might be caused by construction works and/or operation of the project; and (iii) 
build trust and respect and promote productive relationships between the PCG, PMO, PIUs and 
communities.  The  GRMs  are  accessible  to  all  residents  of  the  project  communities,  including 
women, youth, minorities, and poor households. Multiple points of entry are available, including 
face-to-face  meetings,  written  complaints,  telephone  conversations,  e-mail,  and  social  media. 
Details of the GRMs, including time-bound flow charts of procedures, are described in the EMP 
for the environment safeguards GRM, and resettlement plan for the social safeguards GRM. The 
complaint  channels  and  redress  procedures  are  slightly  different  for  environmental  and  social 
issues,  but  the  PMO  will  maintain  an  integrated  reporting  system  to  document,  follow-up,  and 
report all cases. With the support from PICs, all PMO and PIUs will train their staff in the GRMs 
and will take an active role in supporting the staff when necessary. 
45 
VIII.  Poverty, Social and Gender  
89. 
Social  and  poverty  dimensions.  The  project  is  classified  as  general  intervention  for 
poverty  reduction.  The  poverty  and  social  analysis  was  undertaken  based  on  extensive 
stakeholder consultations and social surveys during the project preparation. A total of 523,333 
residents in 239 villages of 25 project towns and subdistricts in the Pingjiang County are identified 
as the project’s direct beneficiaries, including 254,864 women (48.7%), and 21.5% low income 
people. The project will contribute to poverty reduction and social development in the project area 
by: (i) mitigating the potential impact of flooding and reducing flood disasters related losses; (ii) 
improving access to safe drinking water and sanitation services; (iii) increasing crop yields and 
agricultural  incomes  of  farmers;  (iv)  enhancing  residents’  skills;  and  (v)  increasing  jobs  and 
income-generating  opportunities;  and  (vi)  lowering  health  risks  through  better  sanitation  and 
environment. It is estimated that the project will provide a total of  2,884 skilled and 3,712 non-
skilled  jobs  to  residents.  A  social  development  action  plan  (SDAP)  has  been  prepared,  which 
include specific actions and targets for low income or poor people. The project will strengthen the 
capacity of the PCG, PMO and PIUs to implement and monitor the SDAP (Table 16). 
Gender  dimension.  The  project  is  classified  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming. 18 A 
90. 
gender analysis showed that women in the project area (i) had low participation in community-
level decision making;  (ii) engaged more on household care works and wastewater and waste 
management;  (ii)  were  adversely  affected  by  floods  and  the  poor  water  supply,  sanitation  and 
environmental conditions; and (iv)  had low level of skills and income generation opportunities. 
The project provides opportunities for women to participate and benefit equitably from the project 
skills training, job opportunities, better access to water supply and sanitation services, livelihood 
and  income  generation  opportunities,  and  improved  living  environment.  A  gender  action  plan 
(GAP)  (Table  17)  has  been  prepared  with  specific  actions  for  women,  including  (i)  increased 
participation  in the  village River  Chief team;  (ii)  leadership training  to  promote more  women  in 
public  life;  (iii)  quotas  for  women  managers  in  eco-farming  demonstration  farms  and  farmer 
cooperatives (FCs); (iv) establishment women WeChat groups and women leadership groups in 
pilot  villages  to  raise  awareness  raising  and  sharing  experiences;  (vii)  quotas  for  women  jobs 
during project construction and operation, and (vii) training and capacity building for project staff 
to implement gender measures. Key gender targets have also been included in the design and 
monitoring framework (DMF).

B. 
Monitoring 
1. 
Project performance monitoring 
To monitor the progress of the project in achieving the planned outcome and outputs, the 
91. 
PMO  will  establish  a  project  performance  monitoring  system  (PPMS)  before  the  project 
implementation starts (before the loan effectiveness) and will maintain accordingly. The basis for 
project  performance  monitoring  and  reporting  will  be  the  DMF,  which  identifies  performance 
targets for the outcomes and outputs of the project. It will be designed to permit adequate flexibility 
to  adopt  remedial  action  regarding  project  design,  schedules,  activities,  and  development 
impacts.  The  PPMS  will  cover  the  following  aspects  of  the  project  implementation:  (i)  project 
physical  and  financial  progress;  (ii)  progress  and  results  of  capacity  development;  (iii)  farmer 
institutions establishment; (iv) implementation of EMP; (v) implementation of GAP, SDAP and RP; 
and  (vi)  compliance  with  loan  covenants  (policy,  financial,  economic,  sector,  and  others).  The 
PMO  agreed  and  confirmed  that  they  will  (i)  recruit  the  individual  consultants  before  the  loan 
effectiveness  to  facilitate  the  project  start-up  and  provide  consulting  service  as  described  in 
Appendix  1;  (ii)  recruit  the  PICs  to provide  consulting  service  as  described  in  Appendix  2;  (iii) 
establish the PPMS before the first reporting period, in a format acceptable to ADB and confirm 
that targets are achievable; and (v) develop recording, monitoring and reporting arrangements. 
2. 
Compliance monitoring 
92. 
During project implementation, ADB and the PMO will closely monitor the compliance of 
all  the  covenants  under  the  project  and  will  take  necessary  remedy  actions  for  any 
noncompliance. The compliance status will be reported in the quarterly progress reports by the 
PMO  and  will  be  reviewed  during  project  review  missions.  Compliance  monitoring  will  also  be 
undertaken by (i) the environment officer, supported by the PMO to ensure overall compliance of 
all relevant agencies with the EMP, and (ii) the PMO’s social officer to ensure overall compliance 
with the relevant social, gender, and resettlement plans. Semiannual environmental monitoring 
reports and social monitoring reports will be prepared by the PMO, supported by the LICs, and 
will be submitted by the PMO to ADB. 
3. 
Environmental monitoring 
93. 
Environment. The project monitoring program focuses on the environment in the project 
areas  of  influence.  The  environmental  monitoring  program  is  included  in  the  project  EMP, 
including  parameters,  time  and  frequency,  implementing  and  supervising  agencies,  and 
estimated  costs.  Three  types  of  monitoring  will  be  conducted  in  accordance  with  the  EMP:  (i) 
internal monitoring, to be conducted by the implementing agencies and construction supervision 
consultants  (CSCs);  (ii)  external  monitoring  of  air,  water,  noise  and  soil  standards,  to  be 
conducted  by  a  certified  monitoring  agency  contracted  by  the  PMO;  and  (iii)  compliance 
monitoring, to be conducted by the LIEC, to ensure the EMP is being implemented. Monitoring 
shall  comply  with  the  PRC  standards  for  environmental  monitoring.  ADB  will  review  project 
compliance with the EMP on the basis of semiannual environmental monitoring reports provided 
by the PMO and review missions. 
94. 
Internal environmental monitoring. During construction, the PMO environment officer, 
PIU  social-and-environment  officers,  and  CSCs  will  be  responsible  for  conducting  internal 
environmental  monitoring  in  accordance  with  the  monitoring  plan.  Results  will  be  reported 
through: (i) internal progress reports of the PMO and PIUs, based on their direct observations at 
work sites;  and (ii)  monthly  reports  by  the  CSCs,  submitted to  the  implementing  agencies  and 
54 
PMO. 
95. 
External  monitoring.  The  PMO  will  contract  at  least  one  environmental  monitoring 
agency (EMA) to conduct the  external  environmental monitoring  described in Section  D  of the 
EMP. The EMA will have the relevant national certifications and capacity to undertake the external 
monitoring  specified  in  the  EMP.  The  external  monitoring  will  be  conducted  during  the  entire 
construction phase and first full year of operation of the project facilities. The EMA will prepare 
semi-annual  monitoring  reports  of  the  methods  and  results.  The  EMA  will  submit  these  to  the 
PMO, local PMOs, and ADB at the same time, to ensure independence. 
96. 
EMP compliance monitoring. The LIEC will review the project progress and compliance 
with the EMP based on field visits, discussions with project agencies, and review of the progress 
reports  provided  by  the  CSCs  and  external  environmental  monitoring firm.  The findings  of  the 
LIEC will be reported to ADB through the semiannual EMP monitoring reports. 
97. 
Environment  safeguard  reporting  and  disclosure.  The  PMO  will  submit  semiannual 
environmental  monitoring  reports  to  ADB.  The  reports  will  include:  (i)  progress made  for  EMP 
implementation,  (ii)  overall  effectiveness  of  the  EMP  implementation  (including  public  and 
occupational health and safety), (iii) environmental monitoring and compliance, (iv) institutional 
strengthening  and  training,  (v)  public  consultation  (including  GRM),  and  (vi)  any  problems 
encountered during construction and operation, and the relevant corrective actions undertaken. 
The LIEC will assist the PMO prepare the reports and submit them to ADB. ADB will review and 
disclose the reports on the ADB website.  
Environmental  acceptance  reporting.  Following  the  PRC  Regulation  on  Project 
98. 
Completion  Environmental  Audit  (Ministry  of  Environmental  Protection,  2001),  within  three 
months after the completion of major subprojects, an environmental acceptance report for each 
subproject  shall  be  (i)  prepared  by  the  implementing  agencies  or  capable  environmental 
monitoring institute in accordance with the PRC Guideline on Project Completion Environmental 
Audit  (2017);  and  (ii)  finally  reported  to  ADB  through  the  semiannual  EMP  monitoring  and 
progress reporting process. The environmental acceptance reports of the subproject completions 
will indicate the timing, extent, effectiveness of completed mitigation and of maintenance, and the 
needs for additional mitigation measures and monitoring during operations. 
4. 
Resettlement monitoring 
Internal and external monitoring of the RP implementation will be conducted. The PMO 
99. 
will carry out internal supervision and monitoring to ensure compliance with the provisions of the 
RP (the RP also includes framework on LURT, etc), and submit internal resettlement monitoring 
reports  semiannually  during  project  implementation,  to  be  submitted  together  with  the  semi-
annual social monitoring reports. The PMO will also employ an external monitoring organization 
to conduct external monitoring. The external monitoring agency will prepare a baseline study, and 
implement  external  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  the  RP  implementation.  Semiannual  external 
monitoring reports will be prepared and submitted to ADB during the project implementation. 
5.  Gender and social dimensions monitoring 
100.  Project activities will be monitored for impacts on gender and social dimensions with the 
assistance of PICs. In particular, the activities laid out in the GAP and SDAP will be monitored, 
and  sex-disaggregated data  on  project  activities  collected.  Relevant  social  and gender  targets 
and indicators are in the SDAP and GAP; and some indicators are also included in the DMF. GAP 
55 
and SDAP monitoring information will be included in the semi-annual social monitoring reports, 
which  will  describe  the  progress  on  GAP  and  SDAP  implementation  against  the  targets.  The 
project will report on GAP implementation during mid-term review and in the project completion 
report. The format of social monitoring report will be finalized and agreed between ADB and the 
PMO during the project inception.

jointly by ADB and PCG. The review will assess implementation performance and achievement 
of  project  outcomes  and  outputs,  assess  financial  progress,  identify  issues  and  constraints 
affecting  implementation,  and  work  out  a  time-bound  action  plan  for  their  solution.  ADB  will 
undertake  annual  project  reviews  during  the  project  period.  Additionally,  ADB  and  HPG  will 
undertake  a  midterm  review  of  the  project  in  2024,  covering  all  institutional,  administrative, 
organizational, 
financial, 
procurement,  and  other  relevant  aspects  that  may  have  an  impact  on  the  performance  of  the 
project and its continuing viability. The review will (i) examine the progress in implementing project 
outputs;  (ii)  evaluate  environment,  social,  and  poverty  impact;  (iii)  ensure  compliance  with 
assurances  in  the  loan  agreement;  and  (iv)  evaluate  effectiveness  of  the  procurement 
implementation  activities  of  the  executing  agency  and  tendering  company  using  procurement 
review for effective implementation evaluation. The review shall also undertake a comprehensive 
review  of  potential  loan  savings,  identify  areas  for  reallocation  of  loan  proceeds,  and  change 
disbursement percentages, as appropriate. Within 6 months of physical completion of the project, 
the PCG will submit a project completion report to ADB.19 
D.

106.  Environment.  Meaningful  consultation,  participation  and  information  disclosure  was 
conducted  during  project  preparation.  Information  disclosure  and  public  consultation  included 
newspaper disclosure; informal communication with key stakeholders, including residents, local 
authorities  and  sector  specific  institutions  and  authorities;  questionnaire  surveys;  and  wider 
stakeholder  meetings  attended  by  affected  people  and  other  concerned  stakeholders.  A  GRM 
has  been  defined  to  address  community  concerns,  reduce  risks,  and  assist  the  project  in 
maximizing environmental and social benefits. Meaningful consultation will continue throughout 
project implementation, especially prior to and during civil works. Planning for public consultations 
will ensure that environmental and social safeguard requirements are discussed. 
58 
X.  ANTICORRUPTION POLICY 
107.  ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any violations of the 
Anticorruption  Policy  relating  to  the  project. 20  All  contracts  financed  by  ADB  shall  include 
provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the 
executing agency and all project contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers. 
Individuals and/or entities on ADB’s anticorruption debarment list are ineligible to participate in 
ADB-financed activity and may not be awarded any contracts under the project.21  
108.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  are  included  in  the  loan  and  project 
agreement  and  the  bidding  documents  for  the  project.  The  project  design  and  implementation 
arrangements provide for mitigating corruption risks. Risks associated with project management 
will  be  mitigated  by  (i)  training  of  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies’  staff  in  the 
procurement of civil works, goods, and services under the project; and (ii) periodic inspection of 
contractors’ activities related to fund withdrawals and settlements by the executing agency’s staff. 
XI.  ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISM 
109.  People who  are,  or may  in the  future  be,  adversely  affected  by the  project  may  submit 
complaints  to  ADB’s  Accountability  Mechanism.  The  Accountability  Mechanism  provides  an 
independent forum and process whereby people adversely affected by ADB-assisted projects can 
voice,  and  seek  a  resolution  of  their  problems,  as  well  as  report  alleged  violations  of  ADB’s 
operational  policies  and  procedures.  Before  submitting  a  complaint  to  the  Accountability 
Mechanism, affected people should make an effort in good faith to solve their problems by working 
with  the  concerned  ADB  operations  department.  Only  after  doing  that,  and  if  they  are  still 
dissatisfied, should they approach the Accountability Mechanism.22 
XII.  RECORD OF CHANGES TO THE PROJECT ADMINISTRATION MANUAL 
110.  All revisions and/or updates during the course of implementation should be retained in this 
section to provide a chronological history of changes to implemented arrangements recorded in 
the PAM, including revision to contract awards and disbursement s-curves.

C. 
Institutional Arrangement 
7. 
The  Pingjiang  County  Government  will  serve  as  the  executing  agency,  and  a  project 
leading  group  (PLG)  has  been  established  to  oversee  and  coordinate  the  project  planning, 
management, and implementation. Under the PLG, a project management office (PMO) has been 
established  to  manage  all  implementation  works  during  preparation  and  implementation.  The 
detailed roles and responsibilities are defined in Table 5 of the PAM. 
8. 
According to the capacity assessment of the PMO, project start-up support and project 
implementation  support  have  been  proposed  to  conduct  project  management  and  capacity 
building for the PMO and other stakeholders. 
D. 
Tentative Consultants’ Inputs

Support Requirements  
Procurement capability 
and capacity 
Low. PMO has 5 full-time staff in its Procurement Division, they 
have  abundant  experience  of  procurement  and  construction 
management under government financed projects, but not under 
ADB procedures or in English. 
 87 
PMO  needs  to  recruit  experienced  procurement  agency  to 
support the project procurement.  
PIUs have already assigned technical staff to PMO to support the 
technical  designs,  however, 
their  experiences  are  more 
restricted to local-based knowledge. PMO will recruit consultants 
for project start-up, project management and capacity building to 
further  strengthen  their  capacity  for  learning  procurement 
regulations  for  an  ADB-financed  project,  and  other  goods 
practices for sustainable project implementation and operation. 
PMO does not have staff with professional background in green 
procurement, therefore, to achieve the project objectives, a green 
procurement specialist is needed to support the implementation 
of  green  procurement  related  activities.  Meanwhile,  PMO  will 
appoint green procurement focal to be responsible for executing 
the  green  procurement  outputs  with  the  support  of  external 
consultants,  to  maximize  institutional  capacity  building  and 
ensure sustainability of the initiatives. 
During the preparation, some procurement training was delivered 
technical 
by  ADB  procurement  specialist  and  transaction 
assistant (TRTA) consultants. More procurement trainings need 
to be provided to the PMO staff during the project implementation 
to enhance capacity to procure and implement project using ADB 
procurement policies and regulations, as they are inexperienced 
regarding ADB procurement processes. 
PMO  staff  have  good  knowledge  and  experiences  in  similar 
projects.  However,  those  were  domestic  government  financed 
and  only  domestic  contractors  used.  Staff,  to  date,  have  been 
selected  from  PIUs  to  support  the  project  preparation  and 
implementation. 
Technical  specialists  will  be  recruited  to  conduct  capacity 
building for PMO and PIUs staff to maximize institutional capacity 
building and ensure sustainability of the project. 
Two  PMO  staff  will  be  engaged  to  responsible  for  contract 
management,  both  of  them  have  good  experience  in  contract 
management, but only limited to government financed projects, 
and  using  domestic  contractors.  FIDIC  based  contract  will  be 
applied.  
Therefore, external expertise will be required for FIDIC contract 
administration,  safety  and  risk  management,  procurement

C.  
Key Procurement Conclusions 
The PMO is authorized by the PCG to coordinate and handle project procurement and contract 
management matters on behalf of the PCG to ensure that all ADB procurement policies and 
regulations are fully complied with. The relevant PCG procurement supervision agencies, such 
as the Finance Bureau and the local PRTC, will support and assist the PMO in coordinating 
the  procurement  activities.  The  PMO  will  recruit  a  procurement  agency  with  sufficient  ADB 
procurement experience to support the entire procurement process. All PIUs are familiar with 
the technical practices of their respective sectors. However, PMO and PIUs were only involved 
in domestic government financed project and only domestic contractors used. None of them 
had  ADB  project  procurement  experience.  Therefore,  the  PMO  will  arrange  extra  technical 
professionals  from  PIUs  to  support  the  preparation  of  bidding  documents,  and  review 
construction  drawings,  bill  of  quantities  and  technical  specifications,  TOR  of  consulting 
services,  etc.  Furthermore,  consultancy  services  will  be  recruited  to  support  the  project 
implementation and capacity building, to maximize institutional capacity building and ensure 
sustainability of the project initiatives and operations. Specifically, support will be required for: 
➢  preparation of bidding documents; 
➢  compliance with ADB procurement regulations and procedures; 
➢  bid evaluations including responses to clarifications; 
➢  support in the preparation and negotiation of contracts; 
➢  project and contract management; and 
➢  reporting. 
To strength the PMO’s project and contract management capabilities, external expertise will be 
required  for  FIDIC  contract  administration,  safety  and  risk  management,  procurement 
 89 
management,  quality  management  and  contract  management  as  well  as  support  in  certain 
technical areas. 
Training  on  the  latest  ADB  procurement  policies  and  regulations  was  provided  and  well-
received  by  PMO,  and  procurement  training  will  be  provided  continuously  during  the 
implementation period. Budget for trainings has been allocated in the total project cost. 
D.  
External Influences Analysis 
Governance 
Economic 
The PCG fully supports the project. A project leading group (PLG) has been 
established  under  the  PCG,  and  chaired  by  Pingjiang  County  Mayor  and 
consists of representatives from County Government General Office, County 
Development  and  Reform  Commission  (CDRC),  Bureau  of  Agriculture  and 
Rural  Affairs  (BARA),  Housing  and  Urban-Rural  Development  Bureau 
(HURDB), County Bureau of Finance (CBOF), Bureau of Natural Resources 
(BNR),  Bureau  of  Forestry  and  Grassland  (BFG),  Bureau  of  Ecology  and 
Environment (BEE), Urban Construction and Investment Co., Ltd, Bureau of 
Water  Resources  (BWR),  Water  Supply  Co.,  Ltd  and  leaders  from  project 
town/townships.  
Currently,  two  laws  govern  public  procurement:  The  Law  of  Tendering  and 
Bidding  (2000)  and  the  Government  Procurement  Law  (2012).  National 
government policies are stable for fair competition and transparency in public 
procurement. ADB procurement policies have been well implemented in China 
for ADB financed projects for more than 30 years. 
Issues:  Consulting  services  are  not  clearly  addressed  in  the  two  national 
procurement laws. The PCG promises to follow the policies and regulations 
stipulated by ADB in the ADB-financed procurement activities.  
It is expected that during the construction of the project, the local economic 
development will be vigorous and stable, while the GDP of Pingjiang County 
continue to develop at a high speed, with an average annual growth rate of 
more  than  6%.  The  impact  of  COVID-19  pandemic  is  widespread,  without 
exception  in  Pingjiang  County.  The  current  proposed  project  is  therefore 
considered  as  a  priority  for  the  local  government  as  part  of  post  pandemic 
infrastructure investment. 
➢  In  terms  of  prices,  the  staple  building  materials  continue  to  be  stable, 
energy prices are relatively cheap. Energy sources are also continuously 
transforming  to  cleaner  ones.  The  growth  rate  of  Hunan's  price  index  in 
2019 is 2.9%, which is expected to remain stable in the next few years; 
➢  Regarding the employment, PRC has about 7 million university graduates 
every year. The employment pressure is high, however, the skilled labour 
with practical experience and skills is still lacking. For example, designers 
who  can  prepare  bidding  documents  according 
to  ADB  contract 
requirements,  and  supervision  engineer  who  can  preside  over  ADB 
contract change technical coordination, or analyse changing cost are still 
of lack.  
➢  For labour supply, the price and cost of unskilled labour have increased 
rapidly.  Thus,  contractors  have  generally  increased  the  promotion  of 
mechanized construction technology. 
90 
Sustainability  ➢  Impact  of  climate  change:  climate  change  mitigation  and  adaptation 
measures have been incorporated in the design. An increase of 6% rainfall 
intensity is adopted to account for the projected adverse effect of climate

Equipment  (product)  are  strictly  prohibited.  Goods  and  equipment 
purchasing under Subproject 9 will follow the energy-saving catalogue, low 
carbon  catalogue,  and  other  relevant  catalogues  issued  by  Hunan 
Provincial Government for promoting the green procurement practices, and 
PMO  will  make  the  best  effort  to  adopt  these  guidelines  within  other 
subprojects,  with  consideration  of  cost-effectiveness.  The  Green 
Procurement Specialist, which will be recruited since the project start-up, 
will  guide  the  application  of  green  procurement  practices,  i.e.,  review 
technical specifications in bidding documents; 
➢  Flood control works: On the basis of ecological priority and people-oriented 
design  principles,  the  embankment  design  and  construction  emphasis 
nature  based  approach:  “soil  and  water  conservation  +  buffer  zone  + 
ecological revetment + river training”; 
➢  Rural water supply: A water-saving water treatment process is adopted in 
the water treatment process of the water plant to reduce the self-use water 
rate of the water plant. The auxiliary production facilities of the water plant 
adopt water-saving appliances to reduce water consumption; 
➢  Separating  rainwater  from  sewers:  Flooding  problems  at  some  locations 
and in some district areas in Pingjiang County because of e.g. too small 
sewer  diameter,  aged  and  damaged  sewer  pipes  will  be  improved  and 
solved through the dedicated project measures 
➢  Livestock waste treatment: (i) Dry manure collection systems promoted in 
livestock  farms;  (ii)  Anaerobic  digestion  for  liquid  manure;  and  (iii) 
application  of  digestate  to  eco-farming.  These  approaches  will  protect 
water bodies from contamination and eutrophication; 
➢  Eco-farming: (i) Integrated pest control; (ii) Soil testing and fertilizing 
recommendations; (iii) Fertigation, link with irrigation system; (iv) Use of 
organic fertilizer and soil improvement; and 
➢  Environmental education: Mainstreaming environmental education in the 
Pingjiang County local educational system and Integration of subproject 
components into environmental education - Special attention will be paid 
to youth engagement. 
 91 
Technology 
For  the  infrastructure  construction  involved  in  this  project,  water  supply, 
sewage  collection  and  treatment,  river  embankment  improvement,  eco-
farming, etc., the general design should give priority to mature technologies; 
The  technology  pace  of  change  and  innovation  is  slow  for  the  construction 
packages  – the technology involved  is  proven  with minimal  opportunities to 
gain advantage by installing innovative solutions; 
The technology pace of change and innovation is quick for goods packages 
and  the  integrated  smart  disaster  risk  management  system  packages  with 
potential  to  gain  advantage  by  sourcing  and  utilising  credible  recent 
innovations. 
E.  
Key Procurement Conclusions 
➢  National and provincial governments have enforced procurement laws and regulations; 
➢  ADB procurement regulations have been implemented effectively for over 30 years in 
PRC; 
➢  PRC has kept appropriate economic growth and stability. PRC economy is getting back to 
normal gradually since the full control of the COVID-19 outbreak; and 
➢  Both environmental and ecological conditions have provided sustainable conditions for the 
project. 
The possibility of using the Yueyang Municipal Government e-procurement PRTC for this ADB 
project is explored. However, bids using PRTC will need to follow domestic procedures and 
requirements for documentation and approvals. Before the first advertisement, the project team 
will study together with the PMO to explore all the steps that offered by the PRTC and to access 
if they are in line with ADB’s requirements.

Key Procurement Conclusions 
Communication is an essential part of the procurement process during the implementation of 
procurement  plan.  PMO  will  make  a  mechanism  to  communicate  with  all  stakeholders,  and 
prepare a procurement manual to coordinate all the stakeholders. 
The communication of relevant parties in the procurement process mainly focuses on: 
➢  Procurement  schedule,  coordinate  the  requirements  of  regulatory  agencies  and 
stakeholders, so as to make preparations as early as possible; 
➢  The quality of technical documents of the bid invitation, the construction drawings, bill 
of quantities and technical specifications required by the ADB; 
➢  The differences between ADB's bid evaluation criteria and domestic practices; and 
➢  Handling of reports and complaints in the procurement process; 
➢  Provide public awareness training to the youth generation in schools and communities. 
A  green  procurement  guideline  will  be  prepared  to  promote  green  procurement 
practices in Pingjiang County. 
PMO  plays  a  key  role  in  the  communication  of  entire  procurement  process  and  project 
implementation. Effective communications will also be based on the quality of communication 
materials, timing, and approach to conduct communication. Both regular and progress-based 
updates  should  be  scheduled  in  the  procurement  plan  and  project  administration  manual 
(PAM). 
Section 3: Market Analysis 
A.  
Porter’s Five Forces 
This Section is developed based on (1) recent similar projects carried out in Pingjiang; (2) case 
studies  and  findings  under  ADB  /  World  Bank  financing.  Please  refer  to  Appendices  1-15  for 
relevant project experiences and market research data. 
Market  analysis  has  been  conducted  intensively,  assessments  and  results  are  presented  in 
following tables by Works, Goods and Consulting Services. Experiences drawn from the market 
analysis can be summarized as follows: 
•  Civil works under the project are conventional natural-based, domestic competitive bidding 
is sufficient to attract qualified bidders, based on the understanding of domestic market, 
and other similar project studies; 
•  Contract  packaging  should  consider  the  actual  location,  logistic,  land  acquisition 
implementation plan, detailed design etc, to make the package sufficient enough to attract 
qualified bidders; 
•  From  the  contract  management  perspective,  the  contract  value  should  be  sufficient  to 
generate interest from the market. Works with similar nature and in similar location should 
be packaged to reduce the No. of contracts, and to be more attractive to qualified bidders; 
 95 
•  For  standard  readily  available  goods  with  low  quality  risk  to  support  efficiency  in 
procurement especially for low value low risks package, contract can be packaged by each 
category of products by using Request for Quotations due to the transparent prices in the 
market (most of the prices can be checked online through e-platform); 
It is better to group the design, build and equipment provisions for customized IT system 
in  one  contract  to  attract  higher  qualified  bidders  and  ensure  the  compatibility  of  the 
system; meanwhile,  obligations for  supplier  to  guarantee  a  certain  operation period  will 
allow  the  staff  of  system  owner  to  get  sufficient  knowledge,  which  will  ensure  the 
sustainable system operation; 
• 
•  Based  on  local  experiences  and  common  practices,  for  the  eco-farming  demonstration 
subproject, it subjects to labor intensive of such civil work activities in large areas (1,930 
ha  eco-farming  demonstration  bases)  in  a  seasonal  based  manner.  There  are  external 
contractors  available  in  the  market  for  carrying  out  those  works.  However,  due  to  the 
significant amount of stakeholders, whom own the land use right of such demonstration 
bases  (farmer  households,  enterprises,  village  committees  and  farmer  cooperatives),  it 
will be difficult for PMO and PIUs to coordinate for actual contract implementation if an 
external  contractor  is  involved.  Therefore,  community  participation  approach  is  an 
appropriate  modality  to  deliver  the  eco-farming  output  whilst  engaging  the  local 
stakeholders.

jointly  by  PMO  and  PIU  (Education  Bureau),  supported  by  the 
Green Promotion and Environmental Education Specialist. More 
details  will  be  determined  during  the  project  implementation 
period. 
China  has  a  large  number  of  civil  engineering  contractors  with 
comprehensive  specialties  and  strong  competitiveness2.  Based 
on the previous local experiences, there will be sufficient bidders 
(around 5-50 bidders) to be attracted, and no pre-qualification is 
needed. 
Due to over supplied market in civil works, the bargaining power 
of  buyer  (PMO)  is  high.  In  the  bidding  stage,  PMO  has  the 
initiative  in  contract  estimation  and  technical  standards.  The 
Contract  Management  and  Procurement  Specialist,  Green 
Procurement,  other  technical  specialists  and  PIUs’  staff  will 
ensure the preparation of good quality specifications. 
Because of the fierce competition in the market3, suppliers in the 
bidding  stage  often  do  not  have  much  bargaining  power  in 
bidding. 
Although  new  entrants  have  the  opportunity  to  join  the  market 
competition,  contractors  who  lack  regional  and  ADB-funded 
project  experience  are  unlikely  to  meet  the  requirements  of 
substantive bidding response. Therefore, the risk of new entrants 
to this project is limited.

PRC procurement procedures will be applied for this purely PCG 
financed subproject.  
Although  there  are  available  contractors  in  the  local  market  to 
carry  out  such  works  (including  installation  of  equipment), 
community  participation  is  encouraged  to  engage  these  94 
livestock farms to achieve the social objectives of the project. 
Price  is  more  or  less  fixed  by  PCG  based  on  previous  similar

The objective of eco-farming subproject is to demonstrate the

Livestock waste management subproject is under PCG

Civil works and equipment under Subprojects 4, 5 and 6 (except 
toilet reconstruction in rural Pingjiang) will be financed by KfW 
(Co-financier under the project), KfW procurement guideline will 
prevail 6 .  Works  and  equipment  for  new  water  supply  in 
Subproject  4  should  be  delivered  as  a  whole  to  ensure  the 
effective operation of such facilities, and likely be more attractive 
to high qualified contractors nationally and internationally. Works 
under  Subproject  5  should  be  packaged  based  on  local 
conditions, urban part can be grouped as one contract, to make 
sure  the  coordination  of  works,  make  sure  the  rainwater  and 
sewer system are separated as an complete loop. 
KfW requires all its financed contract packages should conduct 
international  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  to  attract  high  qualified 
contractors and suppliers. 
A few KfW financed water sector projects in recent years in the 
PRC include: 
•  Nanning Langdong Wastewater Treatment Plant Phase IV;7 
•  Reclaimed  Water  Project  for  Changchun  Water  Group  Urban 
Drainage Co., Ltd;8 
•  Yantai Urban Sewage Treatment Plant Upgrading Project;9 and 
•  Comprehensive Environmental Improvement Project in Kunming 
Economic and Technological Development Zone10 
Due to over supplied market in civil works, the bargaining power 
of  buyer  (PMO)  is  high.  In  the  bidding  stage,  PMO  has  the 
initiative in contract estimation and technical standards, with the 
support from KfW-financed consultants. 
Because of the fierce competition in the market, suppliers in the 
bidding  stage  often  do  not  have  much  bargaining  power  in

Most technology using in these subprojects is mature. However, 
since  the  project  is  targeting  green  procurement,  chances  for 
suppliers who are manufacturing energy-saving and low carbon 
products will likely have a chance.

B.  
Key Procurement Conclusions 
PRC's  engineering  construction  market  is  a  buyer's  market  and  there  is  fierce  competition 
among contractors. PMO, as the buyer, have the advantage of negotiating with the bidders. 
Special  attention  should  be  paid  to  specialized  contracts  for  integrated  smart  disaster 
management system, wetland monitoring system, water treatment plant, etc. 
The main risk for the PMO is the preparation of bidding documents, especially for the technical 
specifications. PMO often falls into a passive situation because of rushing work and neglecting 
the  quality  of  design  documents,  resulting  in  huge  design  changes  in  subsequent  contract 
implementation. Due to the wide distribution of this kind of pipeline and complexity of the terrain 
conditions, the design of the construction drawings may be inconsistent with the actual situation 
on the site. As a result, large-scale changes in construction are caused, which will slow down 
the progress and costs out of control. Therefore, PMO and PIUs should attach great importance 
to the quality of preparation of bidding documents, especially the technical section, to control 
risks during the implementation stage. Project start-up and implementation consultants will be 
recruited  to  support  the  PMO  during  the  project  implementation  period,  in  addition  to  the 
procurement agency, to make sure ADB’s procurement policies and regulations are fulfilled, 
and project objectives are fully incorporated in to designs, especially the green procurement 
practices.

IT systems (disaster risk management system, wetland monitoring and data collection system) 
are more about professional knowledge and equipment supply with technical complex, and the 
importance to achieve the entire project objectives, therefore, they are considered as strategy 
security. 
River embankment construction and riverbank enforcement; water supply plant, rainstorm and 
sewer separation, rural wastewater collection and treatment, wetland rehabilitation, rural toilet 
renovation are the most strategic critical which shall be designed and constructed on village 
basis which local conditions vary very much. Therefore, bidding documents including design 
verification clause are highly preferred while the engineering designs shall also be conducted 
before tendering. This will reduce the risks for contract variations/over budgets to the PMO. 
Consulting  services  related  to  project  start-up,  project  management  and  capacity  building, 
green procurement and environmental education, wetland monitoring are critical to the project 
102 
success, to support PMO for the entire project implementation, therefore, those are categorized 
as critical category. 
Civil works under Eco-farming are largely distributed (1,930 ha) in Pingjiang (43 villages in 18 
towns and townships for ecological rice, vegetable, orchards and tea garden; 51 villages in 8 
towns and townships) and labour intensive based, therefore, these are categorized as tactical 
advantage.  
Other contract packages have relatively low contract value or less complex in technical design 
and low procurement risk, categorized as tactical acquisition.

Key Procurement Conclusions 
Core  contracts  are  the  key  for  reaching  project  objectives  for  improving  flood  management 
infrastructure and rural livelihood services. 
Harvest contracts should require high thresholds for bidders qualifications and experiences to 
attract competent potential bidders. 
Capacity building contracts will be more attractive for NGO and high profile research institutes 
and universities, to increase contract attractiveness, the development contracts should clearly 
define tasks in the terms of reference (TOR). The harvest contract allows innovative designs 
and ideas, the use of point scoring system for design, build and equipment provisions of the 
exhibition center, and incorporating concept design submission as part of technical proposal 
evaluation  given  the  quality  of  design  of  this  experienced  based  spaced  is  important  to  the 
public awareness objective and legacy of the project.

(1)  Open competitive bidding (OCB) to be used for most of the ADB financed contract

packages for works and goods. 
Option 1: OCB advertised internationally 
Obstacles:  English  bidding  documents  need  to  be 
prepared,  more  working  load  for  PMO.  Market 
research showed that domestic market is mature in 
providing the works and goods that is needed under 
the project. 
Option 2: OCB advertised nationally (OCB-AN)  
These  civil  works  will  be  based  on  detailed  design 
and  conformance  specifications  prepared  by  the 
PMO. 
(2)  Prequalification 
Option 1: Prequalification 
Option 2: No prequalification  
Since  there  are  no  complex  engineering  contracts, 
prequalification  of  contractors  or  suppliers  is  not 
required. 
(3)  Contract packaging for IT systems 
Option  1:  purchasing  equipment  separate  from  IT 
services 
Option 2: purchasing as an integral contract.

management system should be integrated into one 
contract  to  attract  reputable  suppliers,  integrated 
database, compatible design, and consistent culture 
of the system as well as competitive prices, same for 
wetland  monitoring  and  data  collection  system. 
Option 2 is more appropriate. 
(4)  Procurement of standard readily available goods with low quality risks 
disaster 
108 
Strategic Options Description 
Option 1: OCB-AN 
According  to  the  demands,  uses  and  technical 
specification of various types of equipment, different 
equipment will be separately purchased according to 
the  types,  uses  and  installation  site  to  attract 
reputable suppliers, as well as competitive prices. 
One option considered is to purchase equipment by 
using OCB-AN. 
Option 2: RFQ 
By  analyzing 
these  equipment  and  market 
availability, the price of such goods and equipment 
is transparent.  
Therefore, option 2 - RFQ modality would be more 
appropriate rather than OCB-AN for standard readily 
available  goods  with  low  quality  risk  to  support 
efficiency in procurement especially for low value low 
risks  packages  (multiple  packages),  based  on 
conformance  specifications  prepared  by  the  PMO. 
This will save a lot time and ease procures due to a 
transparent  domestic  market.  Price  is  available  at 
different e-commerce companies. 
(5)  Eco-farming subproject 
Option 1: using external contractors through OCB-
AN  was  considered  as  they  are  available  in  the 
market. 
Option 2: Community participation approach 
Community  participation  approach  was  considered 
due to labor intensive of such civil work activities in 
large  areas  (1,930  ha  eco-farming  demonstration 
bases) in a seasonal based manner, and difficult to 
coordinate  for  actual  contract  implementation  and 
coordination  with  the  stakeholders  if  an  external 
contractor is involved.

Therefore,  Option  2  -  Community  participation 
approach is considered as an  appropriate  modality 
to deliver the eco-farming output whilst engaging the 
local stakeholders. 
(6)  Consulting services – project implementation consultants 
Option 1: QCBS (80:20).  
For  the  project  implementation  consultants,  the 
short-listing for consultancy  services will be carried 
as per ADB procedures.  
QCBS method will be adopted for selection of project 
implementation  consultants.  Also  the  performance

should be adopted. 
Option 2: QCBS (90:10).  
The  quality  of  the  consulting  services  is  very 
important to ensure the proper service delivery with 
qualified  consultants.  Therefore,  quality  is  more 
important than cost. Option 2 is considered as more 
appropriate method.

Section 6: Procurement Strategy Summary 
Procurement Packaging and Scheduling 
Contract packaging for the main civil works, including the river embankment construction 
1. 
and riverbank enforcement; water supply plant, rainstorm and sewer separation, rural wastewater 
collection and treatment, wetland rehabilitation, rural toilet renovation, were done to reflect the 
most appropriate contract sizes, procurement method and bidding procedure, which are in line 
with  strategic  priorities  of  the  PMO  to  meet  the  different  demands,  locations,  and  construction 
time schedule. 
2. 
The market assessment confirms that these works are common in the PRC and the market 
is  highly  competitive  with  sufficient  number  of  contractors  with  general  contractor  licenses.  All 
contracts packages are subject to post review (sampling) except that the first package of each 
type  of  procurement  category for  each  subproject,  along with  integrated  disaster management 
system and the design, build and equipment supply of exhibition center will be subject to prior 
review of ADB, to ensure correct procurement procedures. 
3. 
The packaging for goods, including all kinds goods - road lamps, water heaters, garbage 
collection bins for schools, wetland subproject related equipment were also done, which are in 
line with their associated civil works packages if any. Based on market assessment, these goods 
to be procured are also common in PRC and the market is competitive with sufficient number of 
suppliers.  Therefore,  OCB-AN  will  be  applied  for  large  value  contract  packages,  and  RFQ  for 
standard  readily  available  goods  with  low  quality  risk  to  support  efficiency  in  procurement 
especially for low value low risks packages. 
4. 
To  ensure  sustainability  and  to  achieve  the  social  objectives  of  the  project,  community 
participation/force  account  approach  will  be  used.  Civil  works  for  Eco-Farming  Demonstration 
Subproject  and  Environmental  Education  Subproject  will  be  contracted out  to the  communities 
(farmers,  village  committees,  farmer  cooperatives,  agricultural  enterprises  and/or  forestry 
enterprises, and schools) based on CPIA between PMO, PIUs (Bureau of Forestry or Bureau of 
Agriculture  and  Rural  Affairs)  and  communities,  and  in  compliance  with  the  requirements  for 
community  participation  in  procurement  in  accordance  with  ADB  Procurement  Regulations  for 
ADB Borrowers: Goods, works, Nonconsulting and Consulting Services (2017, as amended from 
time to time). Specific procedures for contracting local communities under community participation, 
and a draft CPIA are included in the PAM, the detailed design of facilities to be constructed, clear 
duties  and  responsibilities  of  each  party  for  the  project  activities,  quality  control,  project 
acceptance standards and funds payment are included. The first CPIA will be submitted for prior 
review before its implementation.  
Advanced  procurement  for  the  project  management  and  capacity  building  consulting 
5. 
services  (CS-TA-01)  has  been  proposed  under  the  project.  Project  start-up  consultants  will  be 
recruited  by  using  PCG  counterpart  funds,  prior  to  loan  effectiveness,  to  maximize  the  project 
readiness. 
6. 
The indicative Procurement Plan has been prepared with the following assumptions: 
•  Consultancy service contracts will be prioritized to be procured as soon as possible; 
•  The  packages  distribution  provided  is  tentative  and  may  vary  as  per  the  requirement  of 
carrying out the project; 
•  The  Estimated  Value  indicated  for  each  contract  package  in  the  Procurement  plan  are 
 111 
tentative and may vary; 
•  The  Estimated  Value  indicated  for  each  contract  package  in  the  Procurement  plan  are 
confidential and are for internal consumption only as values to be put in the tenders is not 
yet finalized and hence the same should not be uploaded on the website for any reference 
by the prospective bidders; 
•  The  Estimated  Value  indicated  for  each  contract  package  will  also  be  impacted  with  the 
variation in the Exchange Rate. For the subject estimation, an exchange rate of $ 1.00 = 
CNY 6.9909 (as of 13 July 2020) is applied; 
•  The Advertisement Date mentioned for each contract package is also tentative and may be 
preponed or postponed as per the requirement of carrying out the project; and 
•  Non-ADB financed contracts will be listed in the procurement plan under a separate list 
from the ADB financed contracts.

 119 
Standstill Period 
18. 
In China's domestic bidding practice, as the provision of TBL, the publicity period should

option (e.g. national provision, ADB recommended provision or none). Suitable provision shall be 
indicated in the Bid Data Sheet if such a provision is applicable. 
Standard Bidding Documents and Contract Forms 
20. 
Since this project is a loan project of ADB, according to the common practice in China, all 
goods and works contracts for payment of ADB loans (see the procurement plan) are prepared in 
accordance with the PRC specific SBD (updated 2020) stipulated by ADB and China Ministry of 
Finance (MOF). In terms of decentralized rural sewage treatment facilities and domestic garbage 
disposal facilities of this project, which are not construct-only contracts, which have been included 
some auxiliary equipment and materials, such as pumps, valves, pipes and communication cables 
etc. are combined with the civil engineering to generate an integrated contract for bidding. In this 
case, the item listed in the BOQ shall be taken as the unit of measurement and payment, and 
equipment  supplied  by  the  bidder  shall  be  evaluated  according  to  the  requirements  of  the 
technical specifications. In addition, the bidding documents for consulting contracts are compiled 
according  to  ADB  standard  templates.  All  above-mentioned  standard  bidding  document  or 
templates can be used are as follows: 
•  PRC specific SBD for Works (updated in 2020); 
•  PRC specific SBD for Goods (updated in 2020); 
•  ADB Template for IT services SBD; 
•  Community  Participation  Implementation  Agreement 39  (to  be  developed  by  PMO  and 
approved by ADB PPFD/OGC); 
•  ADB Template for RFQ Works; 
•  ADB Template for RFQ Goods;  
•  RFP Template for Time-based Consulting Services (QCBS 90:10 weights); and 
•  RFP Template for Lump Sum Consulting Services (CQS). 
Pricing and Costing Methods 
21.  Mainly unit price/measurement costing are expected for BOQ based contacts. Generally, 
the unit price contract based on bill of quantities is adopted in civil engineering. If the bill includes 
equipment,  all  the  items  in  the  bill  of  equipment  are  merged  into  the  bill  of  quantities  of  civil 
engineering and paid by measurement. For some sub-items that are supplied as complete sets, 
such as coagulant dosing equipment, automatic control equipment, etc., when overall payment is 
required, they are also often paid by the unit of measurement. 
39 The draft CPIA is attached in PAM. It will be further reviewed and revised once the detailed designs are available for 
more details. The first CPIA should be prior reviewed by ADB before the actual signing. 
120 
Regarding  the  various  types  of  equipment  in the  bill  of  quantities,  when the  contract  is 
22. 
executed, after the equipment is supplied and installed in place, the supervisory engineer shall 
measure and pay according to the contractor's quotation. 
23. 
Time-based contract is generally applied for consulting services. 
Key Performance Indicators 
As  part  of  the  contract  management  strategy,  the  PMO  will  identify  key  performance 
24. 
indicators  (KPIs)  for  each  contract  to  monitor  the  contractor’s  performance  during  contract 
implementation.  Some  of  the  KPIs  for  the  projects  rather  simple  civil  works  contracts  are 
suggested below: 
Submission of work program within 28 days from issue of notice to commence: 
Mobilize required equipment and personnel: 
Takeover of site and prepare building layout: 
Submit contract management plan: 
Establish facilities like testing laboratory, safety and health measures: 
Comply with legal regulations including necessary insurance policies: 
Green procurement practices application 
Construction achievement in phases: 
5% 
10% 
5% 
2%

72% 
25.  Where contract packages are identified to have possible significant sustainability impacts, 
sustainability related KPIs may be introduced. 
Evaluation Method 
26. 
The bid evaluation method will be the lowest evaluated price with responsive bids for most 
ADB  financed  OCB  and  RFQ  goods  and  works  packages  as  it  well  reflects  the  fairness  and 
meeting the minimum criteria for the competence. For exhibition center design and build contract, 
a point scoring system will be adopted to introduce conceptual design quality evaluation criteria.  
27. 
For  ADB  financed  consulting  services  for  project  management  and  capacity  building, 
weight of 90:10 for technical and financial proposals is adopted for QCBS method for consultancy 
services to reflect the importance of the technical competence, qualifications and experiences in 
delivering the services. 
Civil works and goods bids evaluation are to organize professional evaluation teams to 
28. 
assess all bids fairly and professionally, to choose and confirm the bidding documents that fulfill 
the  requirements,  and  to  complete  all  the  works  required  by  the  contract  in  a  timely  and  high 
quality  manner,  more  importantly,  the  green  procurement  requirements  should  be  considered 
during the bids evaluation.  
Contract Management Approach 
A detailed contract management plan (CMP) for civil work contracts shall be in place prior 
29. 
implementation, which may include graphs or flowcharts (with the time frame) that will illustrate 
these procedures in a visual form (certain standard forms of contract provide such graphs). The 
project EMP includes a COVID-19 health and safety plan to address COVID-19 health risks, this 
should also be included in the CMP. The plan will be prepared in line with government regulations 
and  guidelines  on  COVID-19  prevention  and  control,  and  in  consultation  with  public  health 
agencies in the area. The plan will include (i) measures to record the locations that workers have 
 121 
visited/lived immediately before and during project work; (ii) schedules for disinfecting/cleaning 
offices, yards, stores and labor camps; (iii) measures to implement temperature checks and other 
health  checks  on-site;  (iii)  physical  distancing  measures,  particularly  in  worker  camps;  (iv) 
requirements  for  mandatory  use  of  personal  protective  equipment  such  as  facemasks,  and 
provision of handwashing stations, hand sanitizers, and other appropriate protective measures; 
(v) how workers and residents living near project sites will be provided with information to protect 
themselves from COVID-19; (vi) procedures to be adopted in the event a worker is suspected of 
having  contracted  COVID-19;  and  (vii)  other  COVID-19  prevention  and  control  measures 
appropriate for the local context. 
Value for Money 
Strategic  procurement  planning  was  carried  out  to  identify  procurement  risks,  develop 
30. 
mitigating  measures,  review  procurement  options  and  agree  on  fit-for-purpose  procurement 
arrangements.  Value  for  Money  (VfM)  will  be  achieved  through  assigning  dedicated  in-house 
PMO  staff  as  green  procurement  focal,  applying  community  participation  approach  for  eco-
farming,  assigning  early  start-up  consulting  as  non-banked  financed  packages  to  ensure 
mobilization efficiency, the use of RFQ modalities for standard readily available goods with low 
quality  risk,  the  use  of  point  scoring  system  for  design,  build  and  equipment  supply  of  the 
exhibition  center  packages  as  well  as  clean  delineation  of  ADB  and  KfW  funded  packages  to 
avoid dual agencies procurement review on the same package. 
31. 
Contract  packaging  for  the  main  component  with  civil  works,  including  the  river 
embankment construction and riverbank enforcement; water supply plant, rainstorm and sewer 
separation,  rural  wastewater  collection  and  treatment,  wetland  rehabilitation,  rural  toilet 
renovation,  eco-farming  demonstration  etc.  was  done  to  reflect  the  most  appropriate  contract 
sizes, procurement method and bidding procedure (29 packages with a total cost estimate of USD 
116.3 million, OCB-Nationally advertised, 1S1E; 1 package with a total cost estimate of USD 0.63 
million, OCB-Nationally advertised, 1S2E; 142 packages with a total cost estimate of USD 19.56 
million, community participation in procurement; and one package with a total cost estimate of 
USD 0.11 million, RFQ), which are in line with strategic priorities of the PCG and PMO to meet 
the different demands, locations, and construction time schedule.  
32. 
The market assessment confirms that these works are common in the PRC and the market 
is  highly  competitive  with  sufficient  number  of  contractors  with  general  contractor  licenses.  All 
contracts packages are subject to prior review except that post review will be applied for some 
low value packages to increase procurement efficiency.  
33. 
To  ensure  sustainability  and  to  achieve  the  social  objectives  of  the  project,  community 
participation approach will be used. Civil works for Eco-Farming Demonstration Subproject and 
Environmental Education Subproject will be contracted out to the communities (farmers, village 
committees, farmer cooperatives, agricultural enterprises and/or forestry enterprises, and schools) 
based on CPIA between PMO, PIUs (Bureau of Forestry or Bureau of Agriculture and Rural Affairs) 
and  communities,  and  in  compliance  with  the  requirements  for  community  participation  in 
procurement  in  accordance  with  ADB  Procurement  Regulations  for  ADB  Borrowers:  Goods, 
works, Nonconsulting and Consulting Services (2017, as amended from time to time). Specific 
procedures for contracting local communities under community participation, the detailed design 
of  facilities  to  be  constructed,  clear  duties  and  responsibilities  of  each  party  for  the  project 
activities, quality control, project acceptance standards and funds payment should be included in 
the CPIA. The first CPIA will be submitted for prior review before its implementation. 
122 
The packaging for goods, including IT systems, and office supplies and furniture, wetland 
34. 
related equipment, water heaters and road lamps, garbage sorting bins etc, were also done (6 
packages with a total cost estimate of USD 10.99 million, OCB-Nationally advertised, 1S1E; 6 
packages  with  a  total  cost  estimate  of  USD  0.49  million,  RFQ).  Based  on market  assessment 
these goods to be procured are also common in PRC and the market is competitive with sufficient 
number of suppliers.  
35. 
As a good practice to be promoted in the project, green procurement will be taken into 
consideration during the entire procurement process, i.e., the preparation of bidding documents, 
bid evaluation and contract awards. This can potentially be used to reduce environmental pollution, 
improve environmental product and service range, and promote more targeted market launches 
of  innovative  eco-friendly  products.  During  the  project  implementation,  a  green  procurement 
guideline  will  be  prepared  to  guide  such  practices  in  Eco-farming  Demonstration  Subproject 
(Subproject  8)  and  Environmental  Education  Subproject  (Subproject  9),  and  will  be  further 
submitted to PCG for its consideration for the entire Pingjiang County.

Project objectives 
The  main  agricultural  crops  in  the  project  area  are  mainly  rice,  vegetables,  tea,  tea  camellia, 
orchards  (i.e.,  grapes,  and  pears).  However,  agricultural  development  is  still  based  on 
conventional  practices,  such  as,  low  yield  and  productivity,  insufficient  capital  investment,  and 
insufficient application of advanced technologies. There are also some other issues in the project 
area for  agricultural  development,  i.e.,  lack  of  sufficient  agricultural  infrastructure,  low  resource 
utilization rate, low industrialization level, and urgent optimization of the planting industry structure. 
Therefore, the development of ecological agriculture in the project area is relatively lagging, and 
there are problems such as low product yield, low quality, high levels of pesticides and fertilizer 
utilization, small planting scale, and low demonstration benefits.  
To  solve  above  mentioned  constraints,  Pingjiang  County  Government  applied  loans  from  the 
Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for  the  construction  of  eco-farming  demonstration  sites,  and 
promoting the eco-farming practices in Pingjiang, by improving the basic conditions of agricultural 
production  in  the  project  area,  water-saving  irrigation,  ecological  interplantation,  green  pest 
prevention and control, and reduction of pesticides and fertilizers. These practices will contribute 
to improve water resource utilization efficiency and farmland water storage capacity, reduce the 
resilience of agricultural floods and droughts; improve water and soil conservation capacity in the 
project area, reduce pesticide and fertilizer application, reduce soil erosion and agricultural non-
point  source  pollution;  strengthen 
the 
transformation  of  agricultural  production,  increase  agricultural  efficiency  and  increase  farmers' 
income, and help rural revitalization. 
the  ecological  agricultural  production,  promote
