PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
A. 
Rationale  
Agricultural production and rural livelihoods have lagged behind industrial production and 
1. 
urban  livelihoods  in  the  People’s  Republic  of  China  (PRC).  As  a  result,  income  inequality  and 
poverty persist in rural areas of lesser-developed regions of the PRC. Increasing productivity and 
value addition through modernization and enhanced market linkages has considerable poverty 
reduction potential in the PRC, where agriculture labor still accounts for more than 25% of total 
employment. Against this backdrop, the Government of the PRC formulated the rural vitalization 
strategy for 2018–2022 to promote poverty reduction, rural development, and green and inclusive 
growth.1 The rural vitalization strategy focuses on modernizing agriculture with the application of 
information  and  communication  technology  (ICT),  which  is  intended  to  increase  agricultural 
productivity, reduce food safety risks, and cut pollution from fertilizers and pesticides. The Asian 
Development Bank (ADB) and the government have agreed to adopt a framework approach to 
strategically program ADB’s lending support for rural vitalization development initiatives. 
2. 
Internet-plus  agriculture  refers  to  the  application  of  network-connected  information 
technology  along  the  entire  value  chain  from  production  to  marketing.  This  enhances  market 
access  through  a  two-way  automated  information  exchange  system  between  producers  and 
consumers. It provides consumers with product information while producers get access to market 
information and production support services. Internet-plus has shown great potential to increase 
income in rural areas through (i) stabilized demand via access to e-commerce, and (ii) reduced 
production costs from avoided food losses along the value chain as a result of expanded smart 
storage  and  processing  capacity.  This  project  will  demonstrate  the  application  of  network-
connected sensors and tracing technologies to provide product quality and safety information to 
consumers and to enhance market access and technical support for farmers. 
Gansu province, in the northwest of the PRC, is the seventh-largest province in the PRC 
3. 
with  a  population  of  26.20  million,  of  which  14.44  million  (55.1%)  live  in  rural  areas.2 In  2016, 
Gansu’s  total  gross  domestic  product  was  CNY720  billion,  of  which  agriculture  accounted  for 
13.7%. In 2017, Gansu’s gross domestic product per capita of CNY29,326 (equivalent to about 
$4,417)3 was the lowest of all provinces in the PRC, and 50% of the province’s 87 counties are 
designated as national poverty counties. In the proposed project prefectures, 6.5%–10.5% of the 
rural population live below the national annual income poverty line of CNY2,300 per capita.4  
Information  asymmetry  about  product  quality  and  safety  characteristics  (e.g.,  origin  of 
4. 
inputs, farming system, food safety, nutrition values) has led to selection of low-value products, 
which compromises traceability, food safety, and competitiveness in developing high-value online 
and  offline  markets  in  Gansu  and  other  provinces.  The  project  design  contains  innovative 
agriculture internet-plus features, which aims to achieve global public goods, such as enhanced 
food  safety  and  reduced  environmental  pollution.  ICT-supported  value  chain  services  for 
traceability  and  food  safety  will  provide  an  opportunity  for  farmers  to  access  high-value  e-

commerce  markets  through  the  network  of  relevant  business  entities  (e.g.,  traders,  logistics 
services, wholesalers, and retailers). 
5. 
Uncoordinated  business  relationships  between  the  primary  and  processing  segments 
dominate the agriculture sector. Farmers’ decisions on the quality and quantity of applied water, 
fertilizers, and pesticides for crop growth are not documented or optimized through the application 
of  modern  precision  technology.  Real-time  information  services  on  specific  agro-ecological 
conditions, such as soil fertility, moisture, and temperature, are missing. Excessive application of 
water, fertilizers, and pesticides are common inefficient input uses in crop production, resulting in 
high production costs, nonpoint source pollution, food safety risks, and inefficient water usage. 
Business upscaling of processing operations through contract farming arrangements to realize 
economies of scale is constrained by high sourcing costs for inputs because of high transaction 
costs with small-scale entities. Many processing operations lack adequate coordination of storage 
facilities, transportation, and marketing capacity which would enable them to produce the volume 
and quality needed to access premium e-commerce and offline markets. 
Limited ICT capacity of farmers, processors, and other service providers is constraining the 
6. 
adoption  of  integrated  and  automated  information  exchange  systems,  which  could  facilitate  the 
coordination and cooperation between business entities in the production and marketing segments. 
Limited technology application capacity of farmer cooperatives hampers access to high-value e-
commerce markets and adoption of modern production methods. The primary production segment 
is characterized by scattered unorganized  production of small-scale farmers with  low bargaining 
power  and  low-value  crop  production.  Although  the  Gansu  Supply  and  Marketing  Cooperatives 
Union  (GSSMCU)  is  providing agro-technology  advice  to farmers, the  high  demand for  product-
specific support services to enable access to ICT-supported e-commerce markets is largely unmet. 
7. 
Government  policy.  Improving  rural  livelihoods,  and  particularly  eradicating  extreme 
poverty  by  2020,  is  a  key  priority  under  the  PRC’s  Thirteenth  Five-Year  Plan  on  National 
Economic and Social Development, 2016–2020.5 The PRC has initiated internet-plus policies with 
the objective of integrating the agriculture sector into the wider economy through the use of ICT 
solutions to link rural economic development approaches to service delivery in rural areas. The 
government is committed to eradicating poverty and closing the income gap that exists between 
urban and rural populations. E-commerce and internet-based support services are accelerating 
growth in rural areas, which is contributing to structural reforms towards increased quality and 
market orientation of the agricultural supply chain.  
Strategic  fit.  The  project  will  support  ADB’s  Strategy  2030  by  creating  knowledge  and 
8. 
promoting  rural  development  and  food  security.6 Supporting  inclusive  economic  growth  is  a  key 
strategic  priority  for  ADB  in  its  country  partnership  strategy  for  the  PRC.7 The  Gansu  Provincial 
Government (GPG) requested ADB assistance in implementing the PRC’s focus on an internet-
plus approach to promoting agriculture-based industry for local specialty agricultural products. This 
project supports the improvement of market connectivity and value-chain linkages, which is one of 
the four priority areas of ADB’s Operational Plan for Agriculture and Natural Resources.8 Support

financed  by  ADB  and  others  in  the  PRC. 9  The  lessons  include  (i)  enabling  farmers  and 
agribusiness  companies  to  finance  longer-term  investment  to  increase  production,  improve 
productivity,  enhance  value  addition,  and  access  new  markets;  (ii)  engaging  agribusiness 
companies  to  create  income-generating  opportunities;  (iii)  helping  farmers  improve  access  to 
markets and improve product quality control through cooperation with agribusiness companies; 
and  (iv)  engaging  agribusiness  companies  to  involve  farmers  and  cooperatives  for  improved 
production enterprises and equitable benefit sharing.

Impact and Outcome 
10. 
The project is aligned with the following impacts: (i) inclusive economic opportunities in 
the rural  areas  of Gansu  province  increased,  and (ii)  poverty  in  rural  areas of Gansu  province 
reduced.10 The  project  will  have  the  following  outcome:  income-generating  opportunities  from 
agricultural production and marketing increased.11   
C. 
Outputs 
11. 
Output 1: Comprehensive information service and management platform developed. 
This  output  will  develop  data  centers  with  information  platforms  to  process  data generated from 
project facilities established under output 2 for increased production and processing efficiency and 
for e-commerce marketing purposes. This will include (i) constructing data and training centers, (ii) 
procuring ICT equipment and technical advisory services, and (iii) training farmers and enterprise 
staff to build capacity in ICT application in the agriculture production and processing segment. The 
platform  will  provide  product  origin,  quality,  safety  monitoring,  and  tracing  services  as  well  as 
management  advice  for the  coordination  and  optimization  of  agricultural  production,  processing, 
and marketing activities. The integrated network will also reduce transaction costs between service 
providers  and  establish  access  to  high-value  markets  via  links  to  e-commerce  platforms.  The 
platform is intended to be scalable and inclusive to provide project-generated market information, 
and  agricultural  support  services  to  a  wide  range  of  beneficiaries,  especially  farmers  who  lack 
access to markets and high-quality technical support services. 
12. 
Output 2: Agricultural production, processing, storage, and marketing modernized. 
This output will (i) establish demonstration agricultural production enterprises for high-value crop 
production including summer vegetables, potatoes, fruits, and licorice; and forage crop production, 
in  particular  mulberry  plants; 12 (ii)  equip  the  demonstration  enterprises  with  internet-of-things 
(IOT)13 applications for product quality and safety monitoring and increased production efficiency, 
and coordination with other segments of the agriculture sector; (iii) construct warehouses, cold

storage  facilities,  and  market  facilities  to  increase  value  addition;  and  (iv)  finance  ICT  and 
transport equipment to promote an integrated and automated information exchange network for 
enhanced coordination and quality assurance at distribution, storage, processing, and marketing 
facilities. Global positioning systems together with network-connected sensors for soil moisture, 
temperature, and optical spectrum will be utilized to monitor and optimize the quantity and timing 
of irrigation, fertilizer application, and harvesting depending on the intrafield variability of crops 
and soil conditions. Project-financed improvements to processing and storage services facilities 
will  benefit  small  farmers  including  women  and  vulnerable  groups  through  enhanced  market 
access.  The  production  enterprises  will  be  used  for  demonstration  and  training  purposes  to 
increase access and quality of agriculture technology and management support services for small 
farmers, including women and vulnerable groups in rural areas, who will benefit as suppliers or 
members of the cooperatives. 
13. 
Output 3: Capacity of Gansu Supply and Marketing Cooperatives Union improved. 
This  output  will  (i)  provide  project-related  training,  including  on  IOT,  to  GSSMCU,  project 
implementation unit (PIU), and other related government agency staff in implementing the project; 
(ii) support study tours, in particular with respect to precision agriculture, modern internet-based 
marketing, quality control, and traceability; and (iii) promote participation in capacity building and 
knowledge sharing events. The output will improve the capacity of GSSMCU staff to implement 
projects and to work within an internet-based working environment. 
14. 
Innovations. IOT tracing sensors will be installed along production and processing lines so 
as to allow the identification of product batches. This will provide credible product origin and food 
safety certification data on branded fresh and processed agricultural products. Greenhouses and 
agriculture production bases for high-value crops will be equipped with temperature, soil fertility and 
moisture sensors to optimize fertilizer and water application. Depending on the intrafield soil and 
crop variability, both production costs and environmental pollution will be cut. Project platforms will 
provide  tailored  agriculture  precision  farming  and  value  chain  services  though  IOT  applications. 
Production batch identification technology will also be installed in warehouses and logistics fleets to 
achieve  higher  cost-effectiveness  of  the  distribution  system  and  online  delivery  linkages  to  e-
commerce platforms. The project investment in value chain services will enable farmers to access 
e-commerce and is envisaged to act as a catalyst to attract large-scale private sector activities for 
value chain services related to e-commerce in this poor province. 
15. 
Knowledge  sharing.  ADB  has  published  the  project  preparation  lessons  in  a  technical 
report. 14  The  project’s  innovative  organization  of  the  internet-plus  agriculture  concept  and  the 
business models regarding integrating e-commerce solutions offer a unique opportunity to showcase 
value-added  modern  agriculture  practices  to  other  developing  member  countries  and  with  other 
provinces  of  the  PRC.  In  this  context,  the  project  team  will  liaise  with  the  Central  Asia  Regional 
Economic Cooperation (CAREC), CAREC Institute, and the Greater Mekong Subregion platforms to 
disseminate the best practices by participating in regional events and organizing CAREC-led study 
tours  to  the  project  area.  Further,  in  close  coordination  with  the  ADB-PRC  Regional  Knowledge 
Sharing Initiative, regional dissemination of the innovative solutions will be undertaken.

IV.  
COSTS AND FINANCING 
17. 
The  project  is  estimated  to  cost  €163.48  million.  The  project  investment  costs  include 
goods, works, and consulting services to support the development of comprehensive information 
services  and  management  platforms;  modernization  of  agricultural  processing,  storage,  and 
marketing facilities; and modernization of agricultural production; as well as project management.  
18. 
The Government of the PRC has requested a regular loan of €118.00 million from ADB’s 
ordinary capital resources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 15-year term, including 
a grace period of 5 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB’s London 
interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year; 
and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. Based on 
the above loan terms and the borrower‘s choice of straight-line method, the average loan maturity 
is 10.25 years, with no maturity premium payable to ADB. The government will make the loan 
proceeds available to the city governments, which in turn will make the loan proceeds available 
to the subproject enterprises on terms and conditions acceptable to ADB. 
19. 
The ADB loan will finance 72.18% of the total project costs, including expenditures relating 
to civil works, goods, consulting services, and taxes and duties of €8.4 million for eligible ADB-
financed expenditures. Participating enterprises will contribute 27.80% of the total project costs, 
including the balance of expenditures relating to civil works and goods, capacity building at the 
subproject  level,  subproject  management  and  taxes  and  duties  of  €3.3  million.  The  provincial 
government  will  contribute  0.02%,  comprising  the  interest  and  commitment  for  the  capacity 
building of GSSMCU (Output 3).  
A. 
Cost Estimates Preparation and Revisions  
20. 
Preparation. The cost estimates were prepared jointly by the design institute, the project 
management office (PMO), the project implementation offices, and ADB with assistance from the 
transaction technical assistance (TA) consultants. The sources and basis of cost estimates were 
reviewed during project preparation and confirmed by related parties. The process was facilitated 
by a model in excel software which enabled easy updating or revision, if necessary. The model is 
maintained by both the PMO and ADB. 
21. 
Revision. Revision of cost estimates will be conducted when deemed necessary during 
implementation. The PMO will be responsible in proposing and drafting the revision which will be 
subject to ADB’s approval. 
B.

FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT 
A. 
Financial Management Assessment 
The financial management assessment is conducted in accordance with ADB’s Guidelines 
23. 
on  the  Financial  Management  and  Analysis  of  Projects  (2005),  Financial  Due  Diligence:  A 
Methodology  Note,  and Technical Guidance  Note:  Financial  Management  Assessment  (2015). 
The  financial  management  assessment  assesses  the  financial  management  capacity  of  GPG 
(involving  the  PFD),  GSSMCU,  the  implementing  agency  of  the  project  and  seven  project 
participating agencies that act as PIUs to respectively implement each of the seven subprojects 
under  the  project.  The  assessment  covers  funds-flow  arrangements,  staffing,  accounting  and 
financial reporting systems, internal and external auditing arrangements, and financial information 
systems. 
24. 
The assessment confirms that the executing agency, the implementing agency, and the 
seven  PIUs  have  satisfactory  financial  management  capacity  and  capability  to  effectively  and 
efficiently implement the project, including administering statement of expenditure procedure. The 
PFD  has  managed  the  advance  accounts  of  several  ADB-financed  projects  in  Gansu  which 
established its financial management capacity as satisfactory. 
The  identified  main  financial  management  risks  are:  (i)  less  familiar  with  ADB 
25. 
disbursement  procedures  and requirements  which  could delay  project  implementation, (ii)  less 
familiar with ADB requirements on accounting, reporting, and auditing, which may delay project 
reporting  and  detail  identification  of  issues  on  the  use  of  loan  proceeds,  and  (iii)  delay  in  the 
provision  of  counterpart  funds  which  could  delay  project  implementation  The  overall  financial 
management risk-rating of the project before considering mitigating measures is moderate. 
The identified financial management risks will be mitigated by the proposed action plan as 
26. 
shown in Table  and will be closely monitored during project implementation.

Disbursement 
1. 
Disbursement Arrangements for ADB Funds 
The  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  Loan  Disbursement 
27. 
Handbook  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time),15 and  detailed  arrangements  agreed  upon 
between the government and ADB. Online training for project staff on disbursement policies and 
procedures  is  available.16 Project  staff  are  encouraged  to  avail  of  this  training  to  help  ensure 
efficient disbursement and fiduciary control. 
28. 
No withdrawals may be made from the Loan Account for onlending to a PIU until GPG, 
through the  PMO,  has  delivered  to  ADB  an  Onlending  Agreement,  using  the  template  agreed 
upon between GPG and ADB, between the PIU and an appropriate government finance bureau 
and  a  Project  Implementation  Agreement,  using the  template  agreed upon between GPG  and 
ADB, between the PIU, project implementing agency, and related local government. 
The  county  finance  bureaus,  in  collaboration  with  the  PIUs,  will  prepare  withdrawal 
29. 
applications and submit them to ADB through GSSMCU. At the end of each year, GSSMCU will 
prepare  realistic  projections  of  contract  awards  and  disbursements  for  the  following  year  and 
submit them to GFD for approval prior to submitting to ADB.  
30. 
GSSMCU  will  be  responsible  for  (i)  preparing  disbursement  projections,  (ii)  requesting 
budgetary  allocations  for  counterpart  funds  for  government-financed  activities,  (iii)  collecting 
supporting documents, and (iv) preparing withdrawal applications. GSSMCU will consolidate and 
send  the  withdrawal  applications  to  ADB.  Subproject  PIUs  will  be  responsible  for  providing 
counterpart funds for subproject implementation. 
31. 
Advance  fund  procedure.  The  Provincial  Finance  Department  (PFD)  will  establish  a 
separate advance account promptly after loan effectiveness at a commercial bank. The currency 
of the advance account is the Euro. The advance account is to be used exclusively for ADB’s 
share of eligible expenditures. PFD, which administers the advance account, is accountable and 
responsible for proper use of advances to the advance account. 
32. 
The loan proceeds will be released from PFD advance account based on the claims made 
by the subproject state-owned enterprises (SOE)/private participating enterprises (PPE) through 
the county finance bureaus.  
33. 
The total outstanding advance to the advance account should not exceed the estimate of 
ADB’s  share  of  expenditures  to  be  paid  through  the  advance  account  for  the  forthcoming  6 
months. PFD may request for initial and additional advances to the advance account based on 
an Estimate of Expenditure Sheet setting out the estimated expenditures to be financed through 
the account for the forthcoming 6 months.17 Supporting documents should be submitted to ADB 
or retained by PFD, GSSMCU, or the SOEs/PPEs in accordance with ADB’s Loan Disbursement 
Handbook  (2017,  as  amended from time  to  time),  and  other  detailed  arrangements  agreed  by 
ADB and the government. The Loan Disbursement Handbook 2017, as amended from time to

time), describes which supporting documents should be submitted to ADB and which should be 
retained by the government for liquidation and replenishment of the advance account. 
Statement  of  expenditure  procedure.18 The  statement  of  expenditure  procedure may 
34. 
be  used  for  reimbursement  of  eligible  expenditures  or  liquidation  of  advances  to  the  advance 
account. Supporting documents and records for the expenditures claimed under the statement of 
expenditure should be maintained and made readily available for review by ADB’s disbursement 
and review missions, upon ADB’s request for submission of supporting documents on a sampling 
basis,  and  for  independent  audit.  Reimbursement  and  liquidation  of  individual  payments 
exceeding the statement of expenditure ceiling should be supported by full documentation when 
submitting the withdrawal application to ADB. 
Before the submission of the first withdrawal application, the government should submit 
35. 
to  ADB  sufficient  evidence  of  the  authority  of  the  person(s)  who  will  sign  the  withdrawal 
applications on behalf of the government, together with the authenticated specimen signatures of 
each  authorized  person.  The  minimum  value  per  withdrawal  application  is  stipulated  in  ADB’s 
Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time). Individual payments below 
such amount should be paid (i) by the SOEs/PPEs, and subsequently claimed to ADB through 
reimbursement; or (ii) through the advance fund procedure, unless otherwise accepted by ADB. 
PFD should ensure sufficient category and contract balances before requesting disbursements. 
Use of ADB’s Client Portal for Disbursements system is encouraged for submission of withdrawal 
applications to ADB.19  
2. 
Disbursement Arrangements for Counterpart Funds 
36. 
Counterpart funds will come from PIUs which will contribute €45.44 million, or 27.80% of 
the total project cost, to finance part of civil works; equipment; environmental management and 
monitoring; social safeguards monitoring; surveys, design, and supervision; taxes and duties for 
civil works and equipment; and contingencies.  
C. 
Accounting 
GSSMCU  and  each  PIU  will  maintain,  or  cause to  be  maintained,  separate  books  and 
37. 
records  by  funding  source  for  all  expenditures  incurred  on  the  project  following  Accounting 
Methods  for  Projects  Financed  by  the  World  Bank  (reference  No.  2000  [13]).20 Each  PIU  will 
prepare annual statement of utilization of project funds for submission to GSSMCU. GSSMCU 
will  consolidate  the  annual  statement  of  utilization  of  project  funds  and  prepare  financial 
statements for the project in accordance with the government’s accounting laws and regulations 
which are consistent with international accounting principles and practices. 
D. 
Auditing and Public Disclosure 
38. 
GSSMCU will cause the detailed consolidated project financial statements to be audited 
in accordance with the International Standards on Auditing and the PRC’s auditing standards by 
an auditor acceptable to ADB. The audited project financial statements together with the auditor’s 
18 The statement of expenditure forms are available in Appendixes 7B and 7D of ADB’s Loan Disbursement Handbook 
(2017, as amended from time to time). 
19 The Client Portal for Disbursement system facilitates online submission of withdrawal applications to ADB, resulting 
in  faster  disbursement.  The  forms  to  be  completed  by  the  borrower  are  available  online  at  https://www.adb.org/ 
documents/client-portal-disbursements-guide.     
20 Accounting regulations issued by the Ministry of Finance for all foreign aid-funded projects. 
31 
opinion  will be presented in the English language to ADB within  6 months from the end of the 
fiscal year by GSSMCU. 
39. 
The audited entity financial statements of PIUs, together with the auditor’s report, will be 
submitted in English language to ADB within 1 month after their approval by the relevant authority. 
40. 
The audit report for the project financial statements will include a management letter and 
auditor’s opinions, which cover whether the (i) project financial statements present an accurate 
and fair view or are presented fairly, in all material respects, in accordance with the applicable 
financial  reporting  standards;  (ii)  proceeds  of  the  loan  were  used  only  for  the  purposes  of  the 
project;  and (iii)  borrower  or  executing  agency  was in compliance  with  the financial  covenants 
contained in the legal agreements. 
41. 
Compliance with financial reporting and auditing requirements will be monitored by review 
missions and during normal program supervision; and followed up regularly with all concerned, 
including the external auditor.  
42. 
GPG,  GSSMCU,  and  the  subproject  enterprises  have  been  made  aware  of  ADB’s 
approach to delayed submission; and the requirements for satisfactory and acceptable quality of 
the  audited  project  financial  statements.21 ADB  reserves  the  right  to  require  a  change  in  the 
auditor (in a manner consistent with the constitution of the borrower); or for additional support to 
be provided to the auditor, if the audits required are not conducted in a manner satisfactory to 
ADB;  or  if  the  audits  are  substantially  delayed.  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  verify  the  project's 
financial account to confirm that the share of ADB’s financing is used in accordance with ADB’s 
policies and procedures.  
43. 
Public disclosure of the audited project financial statements, including the auditor’s opinion 
on the project financial statements, will be guided by ADB’s Access to Information Policy22 and 
Section 2.09 of the Project Agreement.23 After the review, ADB will disclose the audited project 
financial statements and the opinion of the auditors on the project financial statements not later 
than 14 days of ADB’s confirmation of their acceptability by posting them on ADB’s website. The 
management letter and additional auditor’s opinions will not be disclosed.  
21 ADB’s approach and procedures regarding delayed submission of audited project financial statements:  
(i)  When audited project financial statements are not received by the due date, ADB will write to the executing 
agency advising that (a) the audit documents are overdue; and (b) if they are not received within the next 6 
months, requests for new contract awards and disbursement such as new replenishment of advance accounts, 
processing of new reimbursement, and issuance of new commitment letters will not be processed. 
(ii)  When  audited  project  financial  statements  are  not  received  within  6  months  after  the  due  date,  ADB  will 
withhold processing of requests for new contract awards and disbursement such as new replenishment of 
advance accounts, processing of new reimbursement, and issuance of new commitment letters. ADB will (a) 
inform the executing agency of ADB’s actions; and (b) advise that the loan may be suspended if the audit 
documents are not received within the next 6 months. 
(iii)  When audited project financial statements  are not received within 12 months after the due date, ADB may 
suspend the loan.

VI.  
PROCUREMENT AND CONSULTING SERVICES  
44. 
A project procurement risk assessment was conducted for the project, in accordance with 
the Guide on Assessing Procurement Risks and Determining Project Procurement Classification 
(ADB, 2015). Overall project procurement risk is moderate. 
45. 
The  main  weaknesses  identified  include:  (i)  lack  of  experience  of  the  implementing 
agencies in internationally financed projects; (ii) some discrepancies between domestic and ADB 
practices;  and  (iii)  lack  of  procedures  in  place  for  procurement  management  and  project 
implementation. 
46. 
Proposed mitigation measures include training to be provided to relevant staff of PMO and 
PIUs,  and  other  stakeholder  agencies.  The  procurement  trainings  were  delivered  by  the  ADB 
officials and transaction TA consultants during the project preparation to the PMO and PIUs on 
topics in ADB procedures for procurement of goods, works and consulting services to ensure that 
the  non-familiarity  with  ADB  procurement  framework  has  been  addressed.  The  procurement 
trainings  will  be  delivered  on  a  well-defined  interval  by  national  project  procurement  and 
management  consultant  for  initial  project  management  support  and  the  loan  implementation 
consultants  during  the  project  implementation  to  ensure  that  procurement  activities  are 
undertaken in full conformity with ADB procurement policy and regulations. 
47. 
A  procurement  market  assessment  was  undertaken  to  understand  and  assess  the 
availability of potential qualified bidders to supply works, goods and services for each sector.  It 
was concluded that no works contracts would require international advertising to attract enough 
qualified  bidders  but  two  goods  supply  contract  requires  international  advertising  due  to  the 
following reasons: (i) the civil works for project components are all normal infrastructures requiring 
only mature technology which are widely available nationally; (ii) contract values of civil works are 
relatively  small  for  attracting  international  contractors;  (iii)  there  are  good  number  of  national 
bidders  who  have  adequate  capacities  and  resources to  meet  the  requirements;  (iv)  practices 
evidenced that all bidders were national though the contracts were advertised internationally; and 
(v)  some  goods  are  high  level  technology  and need  to  be  imported  so  that  the  contract  using 
internationally  advertising  are  worthwhile.  All  works  contracts  can  therefore  be  advertised 
nationally following open competitive bidding (OCB) procedures. 
A. 
Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing 
Advance contracting will apply to the urgent procurement of civil works and goods, and 
48. 
recruitment  of  consulting  services.  All  advance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  will  be 
undertaken in conformity with ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and 
Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time).24  
49. 
Retroactive financing. Retroactive financing will apply to the urgent procurement of civil 
works and goods. Retroactive financing will be subject to a maximum amount equivalent to 20% 
of the loan amount for eligible expenditures incurred prior to loan effectiveness, but not earlier 
than 12 months before the loan agreement is signed.

33 
B. 
Procurement of Goods, Works, and Consulting Services 
50. 
All  procurement  of  the  ADB-financed  works,  goods  and  non-consulting  services,  and 
consulting services will be undertaken in accordance with Procurement Policy (2017, as amended 
from time to time) and Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time 
to time). 
51. 
Before  the  start  of  any  procurement,  ADB  and  the  government  will  review  the  public 
procurement laws and regulations of the national and provincial governments to ensure that all 
procurement transactions  undertaken  are  consistent  with  ADB’s  Procurement  Policy  (2017,  as 
amended from time to time) and Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended 
from time to time).   
52. 
A  procurement  plan  for  the  initial  18  months  period  indicating  methods  and  review 
procedures;  works,  goods  and  non-consulting  services,  and  consulting  service  contract 
packages; and guidelines for open competitive bidding national advertising are in Section C. 
1.  
Open Competitive Bidding  
53. 
OCB will be used for contracts estimated to cost over $200,000 equivalent for civil works, 
and over $100,000 equivalent for goods. OCB using national advertising will be used for all civil 
works  contracts.  One  goods  contract  has  been  assessed  to  require  international  advertising 
based on the market assessment. The remainder will be contracted using national advertisement.  
For procurement under OCB to be advertised nationally, the following provisions will be 
54. 
applied: (i) the advertisement will be limited to the national press, an official gazette, or an open 
access website; (ii) standard bidding documents issued in 2016 by the Ministry of Finance (the 
new OCB standard bidding document locally advertised which is under preparation may be used 
after its available) will be used, while the standard bidding document for ICT procurement issued 
by the ADB can be adopted for some supply contracts related to the ICT equipment supply with 
software development ; and (iii) bidding documents will only be in Chinese language (except for 
contracts  which  require  ADB’s  prior  review  and  approval),  and  the  currency  for  bidding  and 
payment will be Chinese Yuan, unless otherwise agreed between GPG/GSSMCU and ADB; and 
set  forth  in  the  procurement  plan.  Procurement  under  OCB  will  use  the  single-stage,  one-
envelope  procedure.  The  relevant  sections  of  ADB’s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended 
from time to time) will be included in all procurement documents and contracts.25 The biddings 
could  be  conducted  using  electronic  system  tools  within  the  Public  Resources  Trading  Center 
designated by the Gansu Province Authority26 if the nondiscriminatory, fair, and transparency of 
the bidding process from advertising, bids opening to bids evaluating and contract awarding can 
be firmly ensured to satisfy with the ADB’s procurement policy and regulations. If the rules of the 
biddings set by the Public Procurement Center are inconsistent with the ADB’s procurement policy 
and regulations, the ADB’s procurement policy and regulations shall prevail. 
25  Available at: http://www.adb.org/Documents/Policies/Anticorruption-Integrity/default.asp 
26  All the public procurements funded by the government sources are mandatory conducted within the trading center 
designated  by  the  government  authority,  while  the  procurement  funded  by  the  sources  from  multilateral  financial 
institutions is optional conducted within the center. The designated trading center for ABD financed contract is Gansu 
Hailin Public Resources Trading Center. 
34 
2.  
Request for Quotation 
55. 
Request for quotation will be used for ADB-financed simple civil works of small value and 
readily available goods and or standard-specification commodities of small-value goods. Request 
for quotation shall indicate the description and quantity of the goods, a description of the services 
or specifications of works, as well as desired delivery (or completion) time and place. 
3. 
Consulting Services 
56. 
All consultants will be recruited according to ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended 
from time to time) and Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time 
to  time).  Appendix  1  contains  the  indicative  terms  of  references  for  the  individual  start-up 
consultant,  and  project  implementation  support  consulting  services. The consulting firm  will  be 
engaged using the quality- and cost-based selection with a standard quality: cost ratio of 90:10 
using  simple  technical  proposal  procedure.  The  individual  consultant  will  be  engaged  through 
individual consultant selection procedure. 
4. 
Thresholds for the ADB Review 
57. 
For  (i)  the  first  ADB-financed  OCB  contracts  for  civil  works  and  goods;  (ii)  the  ADB-
financed OCB contracts to be advertised internationally,  (iii) all the ADB-financed contracts for 
consulting  services,  and  (iv)  ADB-financed  contracts  under  advance  contracting  arrangement, 
ADB’s  prior  review  and  approval  of  the  following  documents  (if  applicable)  will  be  required: 
invitation  for  bids,  bidding  documents,  bid  evaluation  report,  signed  contract,  and  contract 
variations. 
58. 
ADB-financed  contracts  not  mentioned  in  para.  55  will  be  subjected  to  post  review 
(sampling) and post procurement audits. The following procedure should be followed: (i) ADB’s 
approval  is  not  required for  invitation for  bids  and bidding  document;  however  the first  bidding 
document  approved  by  ADB,  if  relevant,  should  be  used  as  a  model  without  substantial 
modification;  (ii)  procurement  process  will  be  conducted  without  ADB’s prior  approval;  and (iii) 
only a copy of the signed contract needs to be submitted to ADB for records. PMO and PIUs will 
maintain all documents related to the procurement of these contracts (procurement file) for ADB 
post reviews and other supervision process including compliant handling, including but not limited 
to invitation for bids, bidding documents and amendments (if any), bid evaluation reports, bids 
submitted by the bidders, minutes/records, contract award letters, and signed contracts etc. Post 
review will be conducted on a sampling bases by ADB annual review mission and/or by third party 
authorized by the ADB as a procurement audit.  
For  all  consultant  recruitments,  ADB’s  prior  review  and  approval  of  each  step  will  be 
59. 
required.

Procurement of Goods and Works 
Comments 
The  procurement  assessment  examined  potential 
for 
attracting enough qualified bidders to ensure contract would 
be delivered on time, to requisite quality and exhibit value 
for money. It was concluded that relevant national markets 
are  matured  enough  with  sufficient  number  of  qualified 
national  bidders  and  unlikely  to  attract  qualified  foreign 
bidders.  All  works  contracts  can  therefore  be  advertised 
nationally following OCB procedures. Two goods contracts 
assessed  where  either  it  was  of  too  high  a  value  or 
technologically  advanced  and  therefore  would  require 
advertising 
to  attract  enough  qualified 
bidders.  All  other  remaining  goods  contracts  can  be 
advertised nationally following OCB procedures.

A. 
Environment  
VII.   SAFEGUARDS 
Environment  due  diligence.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  B  for  environment 
67. 
according  to ADB’s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  The  initial  environmental  examination 
(IEE),  including  an  environmental  management plan,  was prepared  and disclosed on  the  ADB 
website. The IEE concluded that full and effective implementation of the project environmental 
management  plan  (EMP),  together  with  the  training  and  project  assurances,  will  minimize  the 
environmental  risks  of  the  project  and  achieve  compliance  with  the  policy  and  regulatory 
standards applied in this project environmental impact assessment. 
Environmental management plan. The project EMP (Appendix 4) is to be implemented in 
68. 
all phases of the project: design, pre-construction, construction, and operation. The EMP is to ensure 
project compliance with PRC’s environmental laws and ADB’s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). 
The  EMP  describes:  the  roles  and  responsibilities  of  project  agencies  to  implement  the  EMP; 
anticipated impacts and mitigation measures; inspection, monitoring, and reporting arrangements; 
training and institutional strengthening; grievance redress mechanism; and future public consultation. 
In the engineering design stage, GPG, through the PMO and PIUs, will pass the EMP to the firms 
contracted  to  prepare  the  detailed  engineering  designs  for  the  project  facilities.  The  EMP  will  be 
updated at the end of the detailed design, as needed. To ensure that bidders will respond to the 
EMP’s  provisions,  GPG,  through  the  PMO  and  PIUs,  will  prepare  and  provide  the  specification 
clauses  for  incorporation  into  the  bidding  documents:  (i)  a  list  of  environmental  management 
requirements to be budgeted by the bidders in their bids; (ii) environmental clauses for contractual 
terms and conditions; and (iii) the project IEE and updated EMP. 
69. 
Environmental  management  plan  implementation.  The  PIUs  will  be  responsible  for 
ensuring  that  the  project  will  be  designed,  constructed,  commissioned,  and  operated  in 
accordance with (i) the domestic environmental, health, and safety laws, regulations, procedures, 
and guidelines; (ii) ADB’s Safeguards Policy Statement, and (iii) the project IEE and EMP. The 
PMO  holds  the  final  responsibility  for  the  implementation  and  compliance  with  the  EMP.  The 
following positions will coordinate and/or implement the EMP: the PMO environment officer; the 
PIU social and environmental focal staff; and loan implementation consultants. The roles of these 
positions are as follows: 
(i)  PMO environment officer. Lead overall coordination and implementation of the EMP, 
including coordination of PIU safeguard focal staff, monitoring, and reporting; 
(ii)  PIU  social  and  environmental  focal  staff  (one  per  PIU).  Responsible  for  daily 
coordination and implementation of the EMP at the site level; 
(iii)  Loan implementation environment consultant. A national specialist will be recruited 
by PMO to provide technical support for EMP implementation; and 
(iv)  Draft  terms  of  reference  for  these  positions  are  in  Appendix  1  (for  the  loan 
implementation environment consultant) and Appendix 2 of the IEE (for all positions). 
Capacity  building.  The  PIUs  have  limited  experience  with  ADB-funded  projects  or 
70. 
safeguard  requirements.  During  the  project  design  phase,  on-the-job  training  on  EMP 
implementation  was  conducted,  including  roles  and  responsibilities  of  contractors  and 
construction supervision companies for EMP implementation, the project impacts and mitigation 
measures.  During  implementation,  a  capacity  building  program  will  be  implemented  on:  (i)  the 
EMP, including the mitigation measures, monitoring, and reporting; (ii) incorporation of the EMP 
into bidding documents; (iii) integrated pest management; (iv) occupational health and safety, and 
44 
(v)  other  topics.  Training  will  be  provided  by  the  PMO  environment  and  social  officers,  loan 
implementation  consultants,  and  construction supervision  companies. Trainees will  include the 
PIU  staff  of  existing  PIU  operations  as  well  as  new  staff  engaged  for  the  ADB-funded  project 
facilities and activities, contractors, and farmers that work with the PIUs. The PMO will arrange 
the training programs, supported by the loan implementation consultants. The capacity building 
program is described in the EMP. 
71. 
Costs of EMP implementation are provided in the EMP. The PMO will bear the salary costs 
for the PMO environment officer and costs for establishment of the grievance redress mechanism. 
The PIUs will each bear the cost of assigning a social and environmental focal staff, and, engaging 
an environmental monitoring agency to undertake the external monitoring specified in the EMP. 
The costs for mitigation measures to be undertaken by the contractors during construction will be 
included in the contract documents. The estimated costs for EMP implementation are described 
in the EMP. During project implementation, cost estimates will be updated as needed.  
72. 
Climate change. Climate mitigation is estimated at €17.0 million and climate adaptation 
is estimated at €63.8 million. ADB will finance 84.4% of mitigation and adaptation costs for civil 
works and 99.5% for equipment and materials.27 
B. 
Involuntary Resettlement 
73. 
The project was classified by ADB as category C on involuntary resettlement according to 
ADB’s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  The  project  does  not  involve  involuntary  land 
acquisition  and  resettlement  impacts. The  PIUs  will  use  5,114.5 mu state-owned lands for  the 
construction of agriculture processing or logistic facilities. 
Land  leasing.  For  agriculture  production  purposes,  the  PIUs  will  use  collective  owned 
74. 
lands (COL) leased through the voluntary land use right transfer (LURT) process. The LURT is a 
land leasing arrangement and will not change the ownership of COL. It is estimated that PIUs will 
use a total of 66,240.4 mu COL (41,380.4 mu leased already; and 24,860.0 mu to be leased). 
The land use arrangements for existing or already leased lands were reviewed for due diligence 
during the transaction TA; and it was concluded that the LURT agreements were conducted in 
voluntary, transparent and fair manner and they had followed relevant principles of voluntary land 
leases.28 For the LURT agreements that will be finalized after the project approval, a LURT has 
been prepared providing necessary guidance on principles and procedures to be followed during 
the project implementation (Appendix 5). With the help of loan implementation consultants, the 
executing agency/implementing agency will internally monitor implementation of LURT framework 
and  land  leases,  resolve  any  issues  related  to  LURT,  and  report  findings  through  periodic 
progress reports during project implementation. An external social monitoring expert, who will be 
financed under ADB loan, will externally monitor land leases and submit annual monitoring reports 
during the project implementation. 
C. 
Indigenous Peoples 
The  project  was  classified  as  category  C  on  indigenous  peoples  according  to  ADB’s 
75. 
Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). The project will not impact any distinct and vulnerable ethnic 
minority  communities  that  would  trigger  requirements  on  indigenous  peoples  under  ADB’s 
27  Details are in the Climate Change Assessment linked document and its attachments. 
28 The LURT principles include: agreements follow legal procedures; contracting parties are informed and consulted; 
agreements  are  voluntary;  farmers  or  lessors  will  benefit  from  lease  payment  and  other  benefits,  such  as 
employment; and the lessors will not be adversely impacted. The same principles will apply to house renting as well. 
45 
Safeguards  Policy  Statement  (2009). The  executing  and  implementing  agency  will  ensure that 
the project remains category C on indigenous peoples’ impact and any activities that would trigger 
ADB safeguard requirements would not be included in the project scope in the future. 
D. 
Grievance Redress Mechanism  
76. 
A project grievance redress mechanism (GRM) has been developed in compliance with 
ADB’s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) requirement to address environmental, health, safety, 
and  social  concerns  associated  with  project.  The  GRM  is  designed  to  achieve  the  following 
objectives: (i) provide channels of communication for local communities to raise concerns about 
environmental and social-related grievances which might result from the project; (ii) prevent and 
mitigate adverse environmental and social impacts to communities caused by project construction 
and operation; and (iii) contribute to cooperation between the project agencies and communities. 
Public grievances related to the project components to be addressed by the GRM may include 
damage  to  public  roads,  interruption  of  public  services,  dust  emissions,  noise,  soil  erosion, 
inappropriate  disposal  of  waste  materials,  and  safety  for  the  general  public  and  construction 
workers. The GRM is accessible to all members of the communities, including women, elderly, 
disabled youth, minorities, and poverty-stricken residents. Multiple points of entry are available, 
including face-to-face meetings, written complaints, telephone conversations, e-mail, and social 
media. The details of the GRM, including a time-bound flow chart of procedures, are included in 
the project EMP and the LURT framework.  
E. 
Capacity for Implementation and Monitoring of Social and Gender Measures  
The GPG has experience in implementation of ADB projects, including an ADB-financed 
77. 
agriculture project. However, the GSSMCU and PIUs do not have experience of implementing 
ADB projects. To implement social and gender measures properly, (i) the GSSMCU and PIUs will 
each appoint a social and gender focal staff; (ii) the loan implementation consultant will include a 
social  and  gender  consultant  to  provide  training  and  capacity  building  to  the  focal  staff  for 
implementation, monitoring, and reporting of social and gender measures; and (iii) an external 
social  monitoring  expert  to  monitor  the  implementation  of  social  measures,  including  gender 
action plan (GAP), social development action plan (SDAP), and LURT framework. 
46 
VIII.   POVERTY, SOCIAL AND GENDER DIMENSIONS  
78. 
Poverty and social. The poverty and social analysis was undertaken based on intensive 
stakeholder  consultations  and  socioeconomic  surveys.  It  indicated  that  the  project  will  provide 
opportunities  for  inclusive  social  development  and  poverty  reduction  in  the  project  area.  The 
project will (i) support a cumulative of 2,397 full-time and 13,992 part-time local jobs; (ii) involve 
12,866 farmer households for contract farming; and (iii) benefit 110,000 rural households in the 
project  counties 29  as  internet-based  service  system/platform  users.  Among  the  beneficiary 
households, 30% are poor and low-income households that will benefit from local employment 
and other socio-economic opportunities. The farmers will benefit from working or cooperating with 
agriculture enterprises or PIUs as their employees, contractual farmers, land lessors, and users 
of services supported during implementation and operation of the project. In addition, the project 
services  will  also  benefit  8,500  entities  that  include  enterprises,  cooperatives,  county-and 
township-level supply and marketing cooperatives, and other relevant entities. An SDAP has been 
prepared  based  on  the poverty  and  social  analysis,  with  specific targets for the  poor  and low-
income people. Consultations were undertaken with farmers and stakeholders during the project 
preparation. The consultation and participation plan for the project implementation stage has been 
included as Appendix 8. 
79. 
Gender.  The  project  is  classified  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming,  following  ADB’s 
Guidelines for Gender Mainstreaming Categories of ADB Projects (2012). Women are involved 
in agricultural and household works. Most of them are primarily engaged in labor-intensive farming 
with low income. Women have lower knowledge of agricultural technology, low job opportunities, 
and  much  lower  representation  in  decision-making.  The  project  is  expected  to  benefit  women 
significantly, as majority of the employment and training opportunities will be provided to women. 
A  gender  action  plan  has  been  prepared  (Table  11:  Gender  Action  Plan)  based  on  gender 
analyses to ensure that the project contributes to improved gender equality. The GAP includes 
the following key measures and targets for women: (i) 10,000 women trained to access the project 
information, agricultural inputs and other online services; (ii) including 30 female specialists in the 
technical  teams;  (iii)  a  cumulative  of  10,456  women  employment  opportunities  by  the  project 
enterprises; (iv) capacity building and training for 10,456 women on employment and labor skills; 
(v)  consultation  with  women  in  contract  farming  and  land  leasing  (50%  women);  (vi)  involving 
women  in  consultation  and  participation  for  implementation  of  project’s  social  aspects  (50% 
women); and (vii) collection of sex-disaggregated data for monitoring of GAP and other relevant 
measures. Key gender targets have also been included in the design and monitoring framework. 
For implementation of the SDAP and GAP, the GSSMCU and PIUs will each appoint a 
80. 
social  and gender focal staff;  and the  loan implementation  consultant  will  include a social  and 
gender  consultant  to  provide  training  and  support  to  the  social  and  gender  focal  staff  for 
implementation  of  social  and  gender  measures.  An  external  social  monitoring  expert  will  be 
recruited to monitor the implementation of social measures. 
29  The project area consists of seven counties, of which three and one are nationally and provincially designated poverty 
counties, respectively.

B. 
Monitoring  
81. 
Project performance monitoring. To monitor the progress of the project in achieving the 
planned outcome and outputs, the PMO will coordinate with the PIUs for the establishment and 
maintenance  of  the  project  performance  management  system  (PPMS)—equivalent  to  the 
management information system—which will permit adequate flexibility to adopt remedial action 
57 
regarding  project  design,  schedules,  activities,  and  development  impacts. 30  In  addition,  risk 
management  for  the  project  shall  be  incorporated  in  the  PPMS.  The  monitoring  will  cover  all 
indicators listed in the design and monitoring framework as well as the indicators reflecting the 
development results contributed by the project. The PPMS will cover the following aspects of the 
project  implementation:  (i)  project  physical  and  financial  progress;  (ii)  progress  and  results  of 
capacity  development;  (iii)  implementation  of  the  EMP;  (iv)  implementation  of  the  GAP,  LURT 
framework,  and  SDAP;  and  (v)  compliance  with  loan  covenants  (policy,  financial,  economic, 
sector, and others).  
82. 
The PMO agrees that they will (i) establish the PPMS; (ii) recruit the loan implementation 
consultants to provide consulting service as described in Appendix 1; (iii) confirm that targets are 
achievable; and (iv) develop recording, monitoring, and reporting arrangements. 
83. 
At the beginning of project implementation, PMO will finalize the comprehensive PPMS 
procedures  to  systematically  generate  data  in  the  above  areas  in  consultation  with  the 
implementing agencies. PMO will refine the PPMS framework, confirm achievable targets and the 
monitoring and recording arrangements, and establish relevant systems and procedures not later 
than 6 months after project implementation begins. The PMO, and the PIUs will assign staff or 
consultants to collect baseline and progress data at the requisite time intervals, including progress 
report on the implementation of the EMP, GAP, LURT framework, and SDAP. The PMO will be 
responsible for analyzing and consolidating reported data through its  management information 
system, and reporting outcomes to ADB through semiannual progress reports.  
84. 
A project progress report, monitoring the project inputs and activities, should be submitted 
to ADB  semiannually  starting  from  project  inception.  These  semiannual  progress  reports  and 
project  monitoring  and  evaluation  reports  will  provide  information  necessary  to  update ADB‘s 
PPMS. 
Promptly after physical completion of the project, but in any event not later than 6 months 
85. 
thereafter or such later date as ADB may agree for this purpose, GSSMCU will prepare and submit 
to ADB  a  project  completion  report,  in  such  form  and  in  such  detail  as ADB  shall  reasonably 
request,  on  the  implementation  and  evaluation  of  the  project,  including  project  description, 
evaluation of design and implementation, evaluation of performance, and overall assessment and 
recommendations. 
86. 
Compliance monitoring. During project implementation, ADB and GSSMCU will closely 
monitor the compliance of all the covenants under the project; and will take necessary remedy 
actions for any noncompliance. The compliance status will be reported in the semiannual progress 
report by GSSMCU and will be reviewed during project review missions. 
Environmental safeguard monitoring. The PMO environment officer and PIU social and 
87. 
environmental  focal  staff  will  monitor  the  implementation  of  the  EMP,  including  the  GRM,  and 
include progress as part of the overall reporting to the PIU. Progress reporting will be: (i) semi-
annual, during construction and implementation of the EMP; and (ii) annual, during operation of 
the  project  facilities  until  issuance  of  the  project  completion  report.  In  the  event  of  any 
environmental incidents, accidents, or complaints, the PIUs will immediately report these to the 
PMO,  who  will  inform  ADB.  If  required,  corrective  actions  will  be  developed  and  agreed  upon 
between the executing and implementing agencies, PIU, ADB and other relevant agencies. To

58 
assist  the  PMO  in  the  preparation  of  progress  reports  to  ADB,  a  report  template  has  been 
provided. 
88. 
Involuntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples.  The  project  will  not  involve  any 
involuntary  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  impacts  or  any  impacts  on  communities  of 
indigenous peoples as defined under ADB SPS. 
89. 
Social and gender monitoring. Internal monitoring of the GAP, LURT framework, and 
SDAP implementation will be conducted and the targets are specified in the relevant action plans, 
and  some  indicators  are  also  included  in the  design  and  monitoring  framework.  Each  PIU  will 
appoint  a  social  and  gender  focal  point  for  implementation  and  internal  social  monitoring.  A 
national social and gender specialist will be engaged under the project implementation consultant. 
The  specialist  will  assist  PMO  and  PIUs  in  setting  up  effective  internal  social  and  gender 
monitoring  system.  Results  of  internal  monitoring  will  be  reported  through  regular  progress 
reports. The PMO will engage an external social monitoring specialist to monitor LURT and other 
social measures, who will prepare and submit annual social monitoring reports to ADB and PMO. 
C. 
Evaluation  
90. 
In addition to regular monitoring, project progress and performance will be monitored at 
least once a year jointly by ADB and GSSMCU during the ADB review missions. The review will 
assess implementation performance and achievement of project outcome and outputs, assess 
financial progress, identify issues and constraints affecting implementation, and work out a time-
bound action plan for their resolution. ADB and GSSMCU will undertake a midterm review in the 
mid-year of the project implementation period to (i) conduct a detailed evaluation of the project 
scope, implementation arrangements, progress of the overall project and each component, and 
status of achieving the performance targets; and (ii) recommend appropriate measures, including 
changes in the project scope and/or implementation arrangements, reallocation of loan proceeds, 
changes  in  the  ADB  financing  ratios,  and  extension  of  the  loan  closing  date.  Promptly  after 
physical completion of the project, but in any event not later than 6 months thereafter or such later 
date  as ADB  may  agree  for  this  purpose,  GSSMCU  will  prepare  and  submit  to ADB  a  project 
completion  report,  in  such  form  and  in  such  detail  as ADB  shall  reasonably  request,  on  the 
implementation and evaluation of the project.31 
D. 
Reporting  
 GSSMCU  will  provide  ADB  with  (i)  semiannual  progress  reports  in  a  format  that 
91. 
acceptable to ADB (format of the progress report included in appendix 7), including (a) progress 
achieved  by  output  as  measured  through  the  indicator's  performance  targets,  (b)  key 
implementation issues and solutions, (c) updated procurement plan, (d) compliance status with 
loan covenants, and (e) updated implementation plan for the next reporting period; (ii) audited 
annual report; (iii) consolidated financial statements; and (iv) a project completion report within 6 
months of physical completion of the project. To ensure that projects will continue to be both viable 
and sustainable, project accounts and consolidated audited project financial statements, and the 
PIU’s  audited  financial  statement,  together  with  the  associated  auditor's  report,  should  be 
adequately reviewed.

E. 
Stakeholder Communication Strategy  
93. 
Project  information  will  be  disclosed  through ADB’s  and  government’s  websites,  CPP, 
meetings,  interviews,  focus  group  discussions,  and  community  consultation  meetings,  in 
accordance with requirements of ADB’s information disclosure policy. Main stakeholders are the 
different  agencies  of  GPG,  GSSMCU,  the  participating  counties/cities,  the  participating 
enterprises,  beneficiary  farm  households,  and  participants  in  the  project  implementation. 
Stakeholder communication is also part of the GAP, LURT, and SDAP.  
Environment.  Meaningful  consultation,  participation,  and  information  disclosure  were 
94. 
conducted during preparation of the IEE and EMP. Public consultations will be maintained with 
communities in the project areas during project implementation. Consultations will be arranged 
and  facilitated  by  the  PMO  environment  and  social  officers  and  PIU  social  and  environmental 
focal staff. Methods of consultation and information disclosure may include household visits and 
village  meetings.  In  particular,  consultations  will  be  made  with  residents  living  close  to  the 
subproject  sites  and  who  may  be  affected  by  construction  or  operational  noise,  dust,  or  other 
issues. Such communities are identified in the IEE and EMP. 
95. 
Social and gender. Consultations with communities were conducted during preparation; 
and will be continued during the implementation of the GAP, LURT, and SDAP—not only to inform 
people about project components or activities; but also, to enable people to ask questions, make 
suggestions,  state  preferences,  and/or  express  concerns.  Special  attention  will  be  paid  to  the 
participation of women, the poor, and other vulnerable groups. Social monitoring reports will be 
disclosed publicly. 
Public disclosure. ADB, GPG, GSSMCU, and the city GSSMCU  will disclose relevant 
96. 
project information to the public and interested parties. This includes particularly the information 
60 
regarding the overall project and environment and social safeguards. The information disclosure 
measures for different stakeholders are described in Table 12.

X.  
ANTICORRUPTION POLICY 
98. 
ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any violations of the 
Anticorruption  Policy  relating  to  the  project. 32  All  contracts  financed  by  ADB  shall  include 
provisions  specifying  the  right  of ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the 
executing agency and all project contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers. 
Individuals and/or entities on ADB’s anticorruption debarment list are ineligible to participate in 
the ADB-financed activity and may not be awarded any contracts under the project.33  
To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  are  included  in  the  loan  and  project 
99. 
agreements and the bidding documents for the project.  
XI.  
ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISM 
100.  People  who  are,  or may  in the future  be,  adversely  affected  by  the  project may  submit 
complaints  to  ADB’s  Accountability  Mechanism.  The  Accountability  Mechanism  provides  an 
independent forum and process whereby people adversely affected by the ADB-assisted projects 
can voice and seek a resolution of their problems, as well as report alleged violations of ADB’s 
operational  policies  and  procedures.  Before  submitting  a  complaint  to  the  Accountability 
Mechanism, affected people should make an effort in good faith to solve their problems by working 
with  the  concerned  ADB  operations  department.  Only  after  doing  that,  and  if  they  are  still 
dissatisfied, should they approach the Accountability Mechanism.34 
XII.   RECORD OF CHANGES TO THE PROJECT ADMINISTRATION MANUAL 
101.  All revisions and/or updates during the course of implementation should be retained in this 
section to provide a chronological history of changes to implemented arrangements recorded in 
the  project  administration  manual,  including  revision  to  contract  awards  and  disbursement  s-
curves.

APPENDIX 2: SUBPROJECT SELECTION CRITERIA AND GUIDING PRINCIPLES 
A. 
Introduction 
The  Project  Management  Office’s  (PMO)  main  focus  on  selection  criteria  relates  to:  (i) 
1. 
meeting essential  requirements for government supporting policies in the west  of the  People’s 
Republic of China (PRC); (ii) focusing on promotion of local specialty crops with the potential to 
increase  the  incomes  of  rural  poor  farmers;  and  (iii)  promoting  the  application  of  internet-plus 
agriculture as emphasized in the PRC’s ‘No. 1 Central Document’ in February 2017. Internet-plus 
technologies  include  but  not  limited  to,  internet-of-things,  bigdata  systems  with  or  without 
technology  concepts  such  as  blockchains  and  artificial  intelligence,  cloud  computing,  and  e-
commerce and traceability systems. 
2. 
Discussion of project area and subproject selection process and criteria started between 
the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  the  PMO  in  early  2017.  Following  the  transaction 
technical  assistance  (TA)  commencement  in  July  2017,  selection  criteria  have  been  further 
discussed between the technical  assistance team,  PMO  and the  ADB team.  A key  conclusion 
was that selection criteria should be separated into selection criteria for the overall project area, 
and selection criteria for subprojects. 
Project Area Selection 
B. 
3. 
The selection of the project area was based on three guiding principles: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
The principle of industrial advantage. The selected project area must have a 
number of industries of featured agricultural products with characteristics of Gansu 
or  resource  advantages such  as for  plateau  summer  vegetables  and fruits. The 
industries must have capacity for promoting the products and the rural households 
potentially involved must be representative. 
Relative  concentration  of  the  project  area.  The  project  area  should  be 
concentrated in a few administrative divisions to reduce management costs and 
maximize  focus  and  benefits.  Secondly,  there should  be  relatively  concentrated 
featured  industries  in  the  project  area  to  develop  industrial  clusters  and  belts, 
which  will  promote  competitiveness  for  the  featured  agricultural  products  in  the 
market. 
The  principle  of  inclusion.  The  project  area  should  promote  inclusive 
development:  that  is,  it  should  focus  on  harmonious  development  of  the  whole 
society. In particular, it should focus on including relatively poor rural households 
in  the  project  scope  in  order  to  make  them  to  benefit  directly  from  the  project. 
Moreover, it should pay attention to gender mainstreaming to help poor women in 
the project area and allow them to share the social resources equally and equitably 
and increase their incomes, which will make gender equality a reality. 
4. 
Based  on  these  principles,  eight  districts/counties  in  seven  prefectures  were  initially 
selected: (i) Jinta County in Jiuquan; (ii) Kongtong District in Pingliang; (iii) Lintao County in Dingxi; 
(iv) Ganzhou District and Linze County in Zhangye; (v) Jingtai County in Baiyin; (vi) Chengguan 
District in Lanzhou; and (vii) Maiji District in Tianshui.  
5. 
Within  this  project  area,  six  standardized  demonstration  bases  that  cover  the  whole 
industrial chain with respect to Gansu’s feature agriculture products were initially selected. These 
were  (i)  Zhangye  summer  vegetables;  (ii)  Pingliang  apples;  (iii)  Tianshui  paper  mulberry;  (iv) 
Zhangye Jinhua Village millet; (v) Baiyi licorice; and (vi) and Lintao potato. 
77 
C. 
Subproject Selection 
1. 
Overall Process 
A total of seven subprojects passed a 4-stage selection process. Among them, two are 
6. 
state-owned enterprises (SOE) and five are participating private enterprises (PPE). The selection 
process is presented in Figure A23.1 
Stage  1:  Call  for  proposals.  In  June  2017,  the  Gansu  Supply  and  Marketing 
7. 
Cooperatives Union (GSSMCU) issued a document—"A Notice on Collecting Sub-Projects of the 
Gansu Internet + Socialized Agricultural Services Development Project across Gansu Province.” 
(Gan  Gongxiao  [2017]  No.85)—to  every  city-  and  county-level  supply  and  marketing 
cooperatives, asking them to collect sub-projects of enterprises or special cooperatives which are 
willing  to  apply  for  this  project.  Proposed  subprojects  were  required  to  (i)  assist  farmers  to 
increase their incomes through increased agricultural production, (ii) support the local economy 
for sustainable development, (iii) have the capacity to use loan funds and repay the loans from 
generated income, and (iv) submit detailed justification and plans for the subproject. By the end 
of  August  2017,  43  proposed  subprojects  had  been  submitted:  11  from  Jiuquan,  eight  from 
Zhangye, eight from Dingxi, two from Tianshui, seven from Qingyang, one from Pingliang, one 
from Baiyin, and four from subordinate enterprises of GSSMCU. 
8. 
Stage  2:  Subproject  appraisal  and  shortlisting.  In  August  2017,  after  receiving  the 
initial  proposals,  GSSMCU  together  with  the  Provincial  Finance  Department  conducted  a 
comprehensive  appraisal  of  the  43  proposed  subprojects  by  analyzing  and  investigating  the 
relevant  material  covering  project  contents,  financing  plans,  financial  indexes,  and  quality  and 
capability  of  the  subproject  proponents.  Seventeen  subprojects  were  short-listed  for  further 
investigation. 
Stage 3: Draft final selection. In September 2017, the PMO of GSSMCU organized a 
9. 
team with relevant experience to further appraise the shortlisted 17 subprojects together with an 
additional one that had been submitted. After further analyzing their business, financial, quality 
and ability to pay debts, and conducting field research, they selected 16 sub-projects for further 
discussion and review, including seven service systems, three demonstration bases for internet-
of-things  applied  agriculture,  one  platform  (big  data  center)  for  socialized  agricultural 
comprehensive services, and five county-level centers for socialized agricultural comprehensive 
services. Following field research and quantification on the basis of 40 indexes in six categories, 
12 subprojects were selected for inclusion in the project. 
10. 
Stage 4: Final selection. From May to August 2018, the Provincial Finance Department 
contracted  a  detailed  financial  assessment  of  the  selected  subprojects,  plus  two  new  ones,  to 
ensure that all have sufficient financial capacity to participate in the project. Based on this analysis 
only six of the previously 13 selected subprojects, plus the new ones were confirmed for inclusion 
in the project. Of these subprojects, two are internet-based and five are crop-based.

2. 
Modernizing Agricultural Processing, Storage, and Marketing 
Technical guiding principles related to modernizing agricultural processing, storage, and 
15. 
marketing include: 
(i) 
All  project  interventions  along  the  agricultural  value  chain  from  processing  to 
storage and marketing should include information and communication technology 
applications to trace and monitor the origin and safety of inputs;  
PPEs  and  SOEs  must  be  committed  to  sharing  data  on  the  origin  of  inputs  for 
modernizing  the  agricultural  processing,  storage  and  marketing  facilities  for  the 
purpose  of  quality  and  food  safety  inspection  by  responsible  government 
authorities; and  
The processing, storage and marketing facilities will include internet-plus solution 
components, institutional capacity, and business models that aides in establishing

3. 
Modernizing Agricultural Production 
16. 
Technical guiding principles related to modernizing agricultural production include: 
(i) 
All activities for the modification of land use, including preparation land for either 
annual or perennial crop production, should comply with strict regulations to ensure 
that  exposure  to  erosive  forces  is  kept  to  a  minimum.  Land  clearing  must  be 
conducted according to technical specifications of soil and water conservation; 
In the choice/promotion of new crops or new farming systems, the protection of the 
soil  must  be  ensured.  For  any  new  system  or  crop,  the  time  and  degree  of 
exposure  to  erosive  forces  must  be  taken  into  consideration.  This  is  critical  for 
crops that develop slowly or develop little canopy, or farming/cultivation systems 
where soil has to be tilled intensively for seedbed preparation; 
Recommendations  for  fertilizer  application  rates  based  on  local  soil  and  crop 
conditions must be followed to avoid non-point source pollution; 
Subprojects involving transfer of contracted land must not include either land-lease 
arrangements against current laws and regulations concerning land or land-lease 
arrangements signed by village officials without knowledge and consent of village 
members.  For  transfer  of  un-contracted  land,  village  representatives  meeting 
records and signatures are required; 
PPEs  and  SOEs  must  be  committed  to  adopting  international  best-practices for 
soil and water management and conservation within their project designs; and 
internet-plus  sustainable

APPENDIX 4: ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PLAN 
A. 
Objectives 
This  Environmental  Management  Plan  (EMP)  is  for  the  Gansu  Internet-Plus  Agriculture 
1. 
Development Project (the Project). The EMP is to be implemented in all phases of the project – 
design, pre-construction, construction, and operation. The EMP is to ensure project compliance 
with  PRC  environmental  laws  and  ADB’s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (SPS  2009).  The  EMP 
describes: the roles and responsibilities of all project agencies to implement this EMP; anticipated 
impacts  and  mitigation measures;  inspection, monitoring,  and reporting arrangements; training 
and  institutional  strengthening;  grievance  redress  mechanism  (GRM);  and  future  public 
consultation. 
2. 
In the engineering design stage, the Project Management Office (PMO) will pass this EMP 
to the design institutes for incorporating mitigation measures into the detailed engineering designs. 
The EMP will be updated at the end of the detailed design, as needed. To ensure that bidders will 
respond  to  the  EMP’s  provisions,  the  PMO  and  the  project  implementation  units  (PIU)  of  the 
project counties and districts will prepare and provide the specification clauses for incorporation 
into the bidding documents: (i) a list of environmental management requirements to be budgeted 
by the bidders in their bids; (ii) environmental clauses for contractual terms and conditions; and 
(iii) the project EIA and updated EMP. 
B. 
Implementation Arrangements  
3.  Gansu  Supply  and  Marketing  Cooperatives  Union  (GSSMCU)  will  be  the  project 
implementing  agency  and  responsible  for  overall  guidance  during  project  preparation  and 
implementation. The GSSMCU will establish the PMO, which will be responsible for the day-to-
day management of the project. Five project city governments (Baiyin, Lanzhou Tianshui, Weiwu 
and Zhangye) which are represented by their Supply and Marketing Cooperatives (SMC) will be 
Implementing Agencies and seven benefiting state-owned enterprises and participating private 
enterprise (PPE) will be the PIUs. The PIUs will be responsible for implementing the project and 
administering and monitoring contractors and suppliers. 
4. 
The  PMO  will  designate  a  qualified  environment  and  safety  officer,  who  will  take  overall 
responsibility  for  supervising  the  implementation  of  the  EMP,  including  mitigation  measures, 
coordinating the project level GRM and preparing monitoring reports for submission by the PMO 
to ADB. The PMO will engage a loan implementation environmental consultant (LIEC) prior to the 
engagement of construction contractors, who will support the PMO in mitigation implementation, 
environmental monitoring, reporting,  and  addressing  any  environment-related  issues that  arise 
including  grievances.  The  LIEC  will  also  support  contractors  in  developing  construction  site-
specific environmental management plans (CEMP) prior to construction and operation. 
5. 
The  PIUs  will  implement  project  components,  administer  and  monitor  contractors  and 
suppliers,  and  be  responsible  for  construction  supervision  and  quality  control.  The  PIUs  will 
ensure  that  the  EMP  is  implemented  proactively  and  responds  to  any  adverse  impact  beyond 
those foreseen in the IEE. The PIUs will also attend to requests from relevant agencies and ADB 
regarding the mitigation measures and monitoring program. Each PIU will include one qualified 
social and environmental focal staff, to (i) supervise contractors and ensure compliance with the 
EMP;  (ii)  conduct  regular  site  inspections;  (iii)  coordinate  periodic  environmental  quality 
monitoring in compliance with the approved monitoring plan; (iv) act as local entry point for the 
project GRM; and (v) submit semi-annual monitoring results to the PMO and ADB. The PIUs will 
86 
also engage an environmental monitoring agency (EMA) to undertake construction and operation 
phase  ambient  environmental  monitoring,  as  per  the  requirements  of  the  environmental 
monitoring plan presented in this EMP. 
The  PMO  and  PIU  environment  officers  with  support  of  the  LIEC  will  (i)  provide  overall 
6. 
coordination and support on environmental aspects; (ii) supervise contractors and construction 
supervision  companies  (CSC)  and  their  compliance  with  the  EMP;  (iii)  conduct  regular  site 
compliance inspections; (iv) act as PMO entry point for the project GRM; (v) collect and submit 
environmental monitoring data provided by (a) contractors and/or CSCs to the PMO, and (b) the 
EMA to the PMO; and (vi) support PMO with preparation of EMP progress section as a part of 
semiannual  project  progress  reports  and semiannual  environmental  monitoring  reports  (EMR). 
The PIUs will be responsible for EMP implementation during operation. 
The PMO environmental officer and PIU social and environmental focal staff will be in place 
7. 
prior to starting of any construction works in the project.  
Construction  contractors  will  be  responsible  for  implementing  the  mitigation  measures 
8. 
during construction under the supervision of the PIUs and the PMO. In their bids, the contractors 
will prepare CEMPs which detail how the contractors will comply with the EMP. Each contractor 
will engage Environment, Health and Safety Officer, who will oversee CEMP implementation, take 
all  reasonable  measures  to  minimize  the  impact  of  construction  activities  on  the  environment, 
develop and prepare monthly reports for submission to the IA. Contractors are also required to 
report  any  spills,  accidents,  and  grievances  received,  and  take  appropriate  action.  The 
Environment, Health and Safety Officer will also be responsible for developing CEMPs and an 
Occupational Health and Safety Plan. 
9. 
CSCs  will  be  responsible for supervising  and guiding  construction contractors  during  the 
project  construction  phase.  CSCs  will  have  a qualified  Environment,  Health and  Safety Officer 
who  will  be  responsible  for  supervising  construction  contractors  to  ensure  proper  the 
implementation of EMP and CEMPs; and preparing and submitting consolidated monthly EMRs 
to the PMO based on the CEMPs implementation. 
10.  ADB will conduct due diligence of environment issues during project review missions. ADB 
will also review the semiannual EMRs submitted by the PMO and will disclose the reports on its 
website. If the PMO fails to meet safeguards requirements described in the EMP, ADB will seek 
corrective measures and advise the PMO on items in need of follow-up actions.  
11.  Roles and responsibilities for the EMP implementation are presented in Table 1.

C. 
Potential Impacts and Mitigation Measures 
12.  Table  2  lists  the  potential  impacts  of  the  project  components  during  project  preparation, 
design, construction and operation, and, proposed mitigation measures. The mitigation measures 
will  be  incorporated  into  detailed  design,  bidding  documents,  construction  contracts  and 
operational  management  manuals,  by  the  design  institutes  (during  detailed  design)  and 
contractors  (during  construction),  under  the  supervision  of  the  PMO,  PIUs,  and  CSCs,  with 
technical support from the LIEC. The effectiveness of these measures will be evaluated based on 
environmental  inspections  and  monitoring  to  determine  whether  they  should  be  continued, 
improved or adjusted. 
D. 
Environment Monitoring Plan 
13. 
Three types of project monitoring will be conducted under the EMP: (i) internal monitoring 
– to be conducted by the PIUs and CSCs; (ii) external monitoring – of air, water, noise and soil 
standards  –  to  be  conducted  by  a  certified  EMA(s);  and  (iii)  compliance  monitoring  –  to  be 
conducted by both the EMA and LIEC, to ensure the EMP is being implemented. 
14. 
The  project  monitoring  program  (Table  3)  covers  the  scope  of  monitoring,  monitoring 
parameters, time and frequency,  and implementing and supervising agencies. Monitoring shall 
comply  with  the  methodologies  provided  in  the  relevant  national  environmental  monitoring 
standards.  Other  associated  standards  to  be  followed  are  the  national  environmental  quality 
standards  of  ambient  air,  surface  water,  sediment  and  noise,  and  the  pollutant  discharge 
standards. 
15. 
Internal  monitoring.  During  construction,  the  PIUs  and  CSCs  will  be  responsible  for 
conducting internal environmental monitoring in accordance with the monitoring plan. Results will 
be reported through the CSC monthly reports to the PIUs and PMO.  
16. 
External monitoring. The PIUs will contract at least one EMA to conduct environmental 
monitoring in accordance with the monitoring program. A detailed cost breakdown will be provided 
by  the  EMA  when  the  environmental  monitoring  program  is  updated  at  the  start  of  each 
component  implementation.  Monitoring  will  be  conducted  during  construction  and  operation 
periods,  until  a  project  completion  report  (PCR)  is  issued.  Quarterly  monitoring  reports  will  be 
prepared by the EMAs and submitted to the PIUs and PMO. 
Compliance monitoring for EMP and progress reporting. The LIEC will review project 
17. 
progress and compliance with the EMP based on field visits, and the review of the environmental 
monitoring reports provided by the EMAs. The findings of the LIEC will be reported to ADB through 
     89 
the semi-annual EMP monitoring and progress reports. The reports will include (i) progress made 
in EMP implementation, (ii) overall effectiveness of the EMP implementation (including public and 
occupational health and safety), (iii) environmental monitoring and compliance, (iv) institutional 
strengthening  and  training,  (v)  public  consultation  (including  GRM),  and  (vi)  any  problems 
encountered during construction and operation, and the relevant corrective actions undertaken. 
The  LIECs  will  help  the  PMO  prepare  the  reports  and  submit  the  English  report  to  ADB  for 
disclosure. 
Project  completion  environmental  audits. Within three months  after  each  subproject 
18. 
completion,  or  no  later  than  a  half  year  with  permission  of  the  local  EEBs,  environmental 
acceptance monitoring and audit reports of each subproject completion shall be (i) prepared by a 
licensed  environmental  monitoring  institute  (usually  the  county  EMA  under  the  EEB)  in 
accordance  with  the  PRC  Guideline  on  Project  Completion  Environmental  Audit  (2001),  (ii) 
reviewed  for  approval  of  the  official  commencement  of  individual  subproject  operation  by 
environmental  authorities,  and  (iii)  finally  reported  to  ADB  through  the  semiannual  EMP 
monitoring and progress reporting process.  
Quality assurance (QA) /quality control (QC) for compliance monitoring. To ensure 
19. 
accuracy of the monitoring, QA/QC procedures will be conducted in accordance with the following 
regulations:  
i) 
ii) 
iii) 
Regulations  of  QA/AC Management for  Environmental  Monitoring  issued by  the 
State Environmental Protection Administration in July 2006;  
QA/QC  Manual  for  Environmental Water  Monitoring (Second  edition),  published 
by the State Environmental Monitoring Centre in 2001; and  
QA/QC  Manual  for  Environmental  Air  Monitoring  published  by  the  State 
Environmental Monitoring Centre in 2001. 
E. 
Institutional Strengthening and Capacity Building  
20. 
The  PIUs  have  limited  previous  experience  with  ADB-funded  projects  or  safeguard 
requirements. The experience and qualifications of staff within the district and county EEBs for 
environmental  management  varies.  Domestic  EIAs  and  project  approvals  generally  include 
limited mitigation measures, but there is not yet a regulatory requirement in the PRC for EMPs of 
the scope required by ADB. Implementation of the current EMP represents a significant new task 
for the local agencies. During the project design phase, trainings on EMP implementation were 
conducted, including roles and responsibilities of contractors and CSCs for EMP implementation, 
the project impacts and mitigation measures.  
21. 
During implementation, a capacity building program (Table 4) will be implemented on: (i) 
the  EMP,  including  the  mitigation  measures,  monitoring,  and  reporting;  and  (ii)  PRC 
environmental  laws  and  regulations.  Training  will  be  provided  by  the  Gansu  Provincial  EED, 
county  and  district  EEBs,  and  LIEC.  Trainees  will  be  the  PMO,  implementing  agencies,  PIUs, 
contractors, CSCs, and local water resources bureaus, agriculture bureaus, and forestry bureaus. 
The PMO environmental officer will arrange the training programs, supported by the LIEC.

These  include  installation  of  electrostatic  precipitators for  the  dust  control, 
exhaust chimneys, exhaust fans, and oil flume purifiers. Sedimentation tanks 
and  septic  tanks  will  be  built  for  collection  and  treatment  of  wastewater 
discharges from the subprojects.  
•  For subprojects requiring the use of industrial coolants (for the operation of 
cold-storage warehouses), the cooling systems will be designed for the use 
of “R32”, “R290” or other coolants with low-impacts to greenhouse gases. 
The designs will not use the coolant “R134a”.

For Subproject 3, the site does not support unique natural desert landforms 
and is already modified by use. However, to adopt a precautionary approach, 
the following good practice will be followed: 
•  The layout of construction sites shall minimize the areal extent of construction 
activities  being  undertaken  at  any  time.  Construction  machinery  and 
construction  workers  shall  be  strictly  assigned  to  work  areas  and  access 
corridors  as  part  of  site  planning  and  without  occupying  land  randomly. 
Construction  machinery  and  construction  materials  will  not  be  placed  in 
naturally vegetated areas.  
•  Imported construction materials such as brick, stone, sand and cement, shall 
be transported to the construction site in  batches to  meet demand so that 
stockpiles  do  not  overflow  onto  naturally  vegetated  areas.  After  the 
completion of the project, cleaning and greening work shall be carried out to 
restore any damage

Grievance Redress Mechanism 
22. 
The  environmental  and  social  officers  of  the  PMO  and  seven  PIUs  will  be  the  lead 
coordinators for GRM implementation. However, all project agencies and staff will be trained in 
the GRM and will take an active role in supporting these staff as and when necessary.  
23. 
At the PMO level, the PMO environmental officer and social officer will establish a GRM 
tracking  and  documentation  system,  conduct  daily  coordination  with  the  PIU  officers,  arrange 
meetings and conduct site visits as necessary, maintain the overall project GRM database, and 
prepare  the  reporting  inputs  for  progress  reports  to  ADB.  At  the  PIU  level,  the  PIU  social  and 
environmental  focal  staff  will  instruct  contractors  and  CSCs  on  the  GRM  procedures,  and 
coordinate with the local EEBs and other government divisions as necessary. PMO and PIU staff 
will be trained and supported by the LIEC and Loan Implementation Social Consultant (LISC). 
24. 
The  contact  persons  for  different  GRM  entry  points,  such  as  the  PMO  and  PIU 
environmental  and  social  officers,  contractors,  operators  of  project  facilities  (OPF),  and  local 
EEBs,  will  be  identified  prior  to  construction.  The  contact  details  for  the  entry  points  (phone 
numbers,  addresses,  e-mail  addresses)  will  be  publicly  disclosed  on  information  boards  at 
construction sites and on the websites of the local EEBs.  
Once a complaint is received and filed, the PMO and PIU officers will identify if complaints 
25. 
are eligible. Eligible complaints include those where (i) the complaint pertains to the project; and 
(ii) the issues arising in the complaint fall within the scope of environmental issues that the GRM 
is authorized to address. Ineligible complaints include those where: (i) the complaint is clearly not 
project-related; (ii) the nature of the issue is outside the mandate of the environmental GRM (such 
as issues related to resettlement, allegations of fraud or corruption); and (iii) other procedures are 
more appropriate to address the issue. Ineligible complaints will be recorded and passed to the 
relevant authorities, and the complainant will be informed of the decision and reasons for rejection. 
The procedure and timeframe for the GRM is as follows and also summarized in Figure EMP-1.  
•  Stage 1:  If  a  concern arises during  construction,  the  affected  person may  submit  a 
written  or  oral  complaint  to  the  contractor.  Whenever  possible,  the  contractor  will 
resolve the issue directly with the affected person. The contractor shall give a clear 
reply  within  five  (5)  working  days.  The  contractor  will  keep  the  PIU  and  PMO  fully 
informed at all stages. 
•  Stage 2: If the issue cannot be resolved in Stage 1, after five calendar days, the PMO 
and/or  PIU  will  take  over responsibility.  Eligibility  of the  complaint  will  be  assessed, 
and a recommended solution given to the complainant and contractors within five (5) 
working  days.  If  the  solution  is  agreed  by  the  complainant,  the  contractors  and/or 
facility operators (in operation) will implement the solution within seven (7) calendar 
days. Written records will be made of all stages and outcomes. At Stage 2, PMO will 
also inform the ADB project team of the issue, steps taken in Stage 1, and, planned 
steps for Stage 3. 
•  Stage  3:  If  no  solution  can  be  identified  by  the  PMO  and/or  PIU,  and/or  the 
complainant is not satisfied with the proposed solution, the PMO will organize, within 
ten (10) calendar days, a stakeholder meeting (including the complainant, contractor 
and/or operator of the facility, local EEB, PIU, PMO). A solution acceptable to all shall 
be  identified  including  clear  steps. The  contractors  (during  construction) and facility 
114 
operators (during operation) will immediately implement the agreed solution. Written 
records will be made of all stages and outcomes. 
26. 
The GRM does not affect the right of an affected person to submit their complaints to any 
agency they wish to, for example the local village committee, community leaders, courts, PMO, 
PIUs, Gansu Provincial Government, district/county government, and/or ADB. 
27. 
The  PMO  and  PIUs  shall  bear  any  and  all  costs  of  implementing  the  GRM,  including 
meeting, travel, and/or accommodation costs of the project staff or affected person. The GRM will 
be implemented throughout project construction and at least the first year of operation for each 
project facility.

G. 
Reporting Requirements 
28. 
Environmental  reporting.  The  CSCs  will  submit  monthly  reports  to  the  PIUs  on 
implementation  and  compliance  with  the  EMP  and  CEMPs,  including  information  on  all  spills, 
accidents, grievances received, and actions taken. 
29. 
Based on the CSCs’ monthly EMP progress reports and the compliance inspection and 
ambient monitoring results, the PIU social and environmental focal staff will prepare semi-annual 
environmental  monitoring reports (EMR)  including  EMP  implementation and monitoring results 
for submission to the PMO. The PMO environment officer, with  the support from the LIEC, will 
compile the findings and prepare semi-annual EMRs for submission to ADB, on behalf of the PMO. 
The reports will assess the project compliance with the EMP and PRC environmental standards; 
identify  any  environment-related  implementation  issues  and  necessary  corrective  actions;  and 
reflect  these  in  a  corrective  action  plan.  The  performance  of  the  contractors  in  respect  of 
environmental  compliance  will  also  be  reported,  as  will  the  operation  and  performance  of  the 
project  GRM,  environmental,  institutional  strengthening  and  training,  and  compliance  with 
safeguard covenants. 
30. 
ADB will review the semi-annual EMRs, provide feedback, and then disclose the EMRs 
on the ADB public website. ADB missions will inspect the project progress and implementation 
once to twice a year.  For  environmental  issues,  inspections  will  focus mainly  on  (i) monitoring 
data;  (ii)  the  implementation  status  of  project  performance  indicators  specified  in  the  loan 
covenants  on  the  environment,  environmental  compliance,  implementation  of  the  EMP,  and 
environmental  institutional  strengthening  and  training;  (iii)  the  environmental  performance  of 
contractors, CSCs and the PMO; and (iv) operation and performance of the project GRM. 
31.  Within 3 months after completion, or no later than 1 year with permission of the Gansu 
Environment Protection Department, an environmental acceptance report shall be prepared by a

The borrower will take necessary measures under the Project to avoid involuntary land 
4. 
acquisition  and  resettlement  impacts  as  defined  under  the  ADB  Safeguard  Policy  Statement 
(SPS); and will obtain necessary land use rights through voluntary land leasing process. In order 
to ensure legal and effective land use right transfer (LURT), this LURT framework (LURTF) has 
been developed to guide the subprojects to carry out LURT works during project implementation. 
The  LURTF  is  based  the  PRC  laws  and  local  policies  and  regulations  regarding  LURT.  The 
LURTF also consistent with ADB good practice on voluntary land use agreements, but it is outside 
the scope of ADB SPS requirements on involuntary resettlement. 
5. 
The guiding principles for LURT are: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
Equality, voluntary, legal procedure and fair compensation. Equality refers to 
both  parties  have  equal  legal  status.  Voluntary  refers  to  that  LURT  must  be 
completely voluntary for both parties, and one party shall not force another party 
to transfer or accept transfer of land use right. Legal procedure refers to that LURT 
must be concluded per legal procedure with legal agreement. Fair compensation 
refers to the transferred land shall be compensated at negotiated market prices. 
Unchanged ownership and agricultural use of transferred land. LURT means 
transferring use right, not ownership, therefore ownership of transferred land shall 
remain  unchanged.  Yet  future  users  of  transferred  land  shall  not  change  the 
agricultural  land  use  nature,  i.e.,  shall  not  convert  transferred  land  for  non-
agricultural uses. 
Government’s direction and administration. The agricultural station of relevant 
county  governments  shall  direct  and  administrate  legal  transfer  of  LURT  for 
farmland. 
Conflict resolution through grievance redress mechanism (GRM). The GRM 
of  this  framework  (compatible  with  subproject  counties’  GRM)  shall  be  used  to 
resolute complaints and conflicts, if any. 
The  guiding  principles  of  LURT– 
6. 
transparency,  consultation,  voluntariness, 
fairness/equity, no adverse impacts, written documentation, third-party verification, and legal and 
policy compliance – will apply to house renting as well.  
C. 
Policy and Legal Framework 
7. 
The purpose of the policy and legal framework is to ensure that the LURT is in line with 
the  Rural  Land  Contract  Law  and  the  Rural  Land  Management  Right  Transfer  Management 
Method of the PRC, and other relevant policies of Gansu Province and local governments, as well 
as  ADB  requirements  on  voluntary  agreements  (i.e.  without  triggering  IR  under  the  Safeguard 
Policy Statement). These laws, regulations and policy documents, are the basis and foundation 
of legal and policy framework, which will support the LURT under the project.  
The main provisions of relevant laws and policy documents are given as Attachment 1. 
8. 
Key applications of the laws and policies are as follows: 
     129 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
Law of the People's Republic of China on Land Contract in Rural Areas: 
−  No change of collective ownership 
−  No  change  of  agricultural  land  use  (not  allowed  to  convert  farmland  into 
construction land for establishment of permanent structures) 
Administration Methods on Rural Land Use Rights Transfer, Ministry of Agriculture 
of PRC, relevant regulations of Gansu provincial and project county governments: 
−  Negotiated settlements between transferor and transferee 
−  Land use right transfer per legal procedures 
−  Standard  contract  (with  endorsement  by  a  third  party  if  transferor  and 
transferee feel necessary) 
−  Official registration and documentation for land transfer 
PRC Law on the Mediation and Arbitration of Rural Land Contract Disputes, and 
relevant  implementation  methods  of  Gansu  provincial  and  project  county 
governments: 
−  Mediation  and  arbitration  of  disputes  per  a  bottom-up  grievance  and 
redresses mechanism (GRM) 
ADB requirements on voluntary agreements: 
−  Meaningful consultations 
−  Negotiated/voluntary agreements 
−  Establishment and functioning of a GRM 
−  Record-keeping 
−  External monitoring 
In addition, the best practices in the project area also have good applications for the land

transfer under the project, such practices include: 
(i) 
(ii) 
Signing LURT contracts by both husband and wife (a way of empowering women). 
Land transfer rate calculated in equivalent output value of grain (wheat or maize); 
this protects transferees from price fluctuations.

Signing of contract by both husband and wife in case of involving individual HHs 
Contract endorsement by village committee and validation by the township station, 
free of charge. 
The  LURT  lease  payment  rate  will  be  ensured  according  to  land  type,  fertility, 
grade, and output of referential crops, or even the price of LURT in nearby villages. 
Taking farmer’s interest into consideration, both transferor and transferee should 
set  a  time  to  renegotiate  land  price  in  case  of  LURT  for  over  5  years.  It  is 
recommended to adjust the rate after 5 years. 
G. 
Grievance Redress Mechanism 
LURT will be based on consultations, negotiations and mutual agreement. Complicated 
13. 
disputes, therefore, may not occur. However, there might be some unpredictable issues during 
and  after  LURT.  According  to  Law  of  the  PRC  on the  Mediation  and  Arbitration of  Rural  Land 
Contract Disputes, a transparency and efficiency grievance redress procedure is set to settle such 
disputes and defaults after land use right transfer: 
1   For example, an existing agreement between PIU of Subproject 3 and Huayin Village stated that government’s grains 
production subsides belong to framers. 
132 
Step 3:  
Step 2:  
Step 1:  When  disputes  or  default  happens,  both  PIU  and  involved  household  (both 
parties are referred as grievant below) shall negotiate with each other to settle 
the problem. 
If an agreement cannot be reached at step 1, the grievant shall report to village 
committee orally or in writing. In case of an oral appeal, the village committee 
shall make a written record. The village committee shall make decision to solve 
the problem within 1 week.  
If  the  grievant  is  dissatisfied  with  the  resolution  of  the  village  committee,  the 
grievant shall file an appeal to township LURT center (i.e., agricultural station) 
after receiving such decision. The township LURT center shall make a decision 
to solve the problem within 2 weeks. 
If  the  grievant  is  dissatisfied  with  the  decision  of  township  LURT  center,  the 
grievant  shall  file  an  appeal  to  the  county  LURT  center  after  receiving  such 
decision. The county LURT center shall make a resolution within 2 weeks. 
If the grievant still dissatisfied with the decision of county LURT center, he/she 
may file arbitration to the rural land transfer disputes tribunal for final resolution. 
The Tribunal will make a final resolution in 30 days. 
Step 4:  
Step 5:  
Based on Law of the People's Republic of China on the Mediation and Arbitration of Rural 
14. 
Land Contract Disputes, charges for disputes arbitration of rural land contract are not allowed, 
and reasonable expenses will be paid by local fiscal budget. The complaints procedure maintains 
its validity throughout the implementation of whole project.

APPENDIX 8: CONSULTATION AND PARTICIPATION PLAN 
1. 
Objectives. While comprehensive  consultation  and  participation (C&P)  of  stakeholders 
have  been  undertaken  during  the  project  preparation,  this  Consultation  and  Participation  Plan 
(CPP)  has  been  prepared  for  project  implementation.  The  CPP  provides  both  consultation 
activities as well as methods by which stakeholders could participate in project implementation. 
The purpose of the CPP is to further consolidate and continue consultation and participation of 
stakeholders  throughout  the  project  implementation  phase.  The  objectives  of  CPP  are  to:  (i) 
provide  a  systematic  basis  for  consultation  of  stakeholder  groups  and  to  create  a  platform  for 
them  to  participate  during  project  implementation;  (ii)  present  time-bound  activities;  and  (iii) 
identify institutions and people responsible for implementation of C&P activities. 
Stakeholders.  The  stakeholders  identified  and  consulted  during  project  preparation 
2. 
include: (i) Gansu Provincial Government (GPG) represented by its department of finance (DOF), 
development and reform committee (DRC) and GSSMCU/PMO; (ii) project county governments 
and their line agencies; (iii) subproject enterprises; (iv) user entities37 of platforms to be developed 
by the project; (v) farmers who are or will be associated with the subproject enterprises through 
employments,  land  lease,  contract  farming,  internet-plus  based  and  socialized  services;  (vi) 
townships and villages where the project’s  production bases are located; etc. 
C&P  methods.  The  C&P  methods  in  the  CPP,  also  used  during  project  preparation, 
3. 
include  consultation  meeting,  focus  group  discussion  (FGD),  key  informant  interview  and 
structured questionnaire survey. In addition, independent online C&P platform and/or C&P path 
on the project developed platform will be established and/or opened to further accomplish C&P.  
4. 
CPP. The stakeholder consultation and participation are continuous processes that will be 
actively pursued during Project implementation. The consultation and participation activities will 
be focused on Project outputs, and the content, purpose and type of stakeholders to consult with 
will be output specific.  The details  of proposed C&P activities are presented in Table 1; while 
Annex 1 gives key elements, process and document points for C&P events. 
5. 
Implementation  Arrangement.  The  Project  management  office  (PMO),  on  behalf  of 
GSSMCU,  will  take  the  overall  responsibility  for  implementation  of  this  CPP;  while  subproject 
PIUs and county supply and marketing cooperatives (CSMCs) will lead the C&P activities in the 
respective  counties.  To  effectively  implement  C&P  activities,  PMO  already  assigned  a  social 
officer and this officer will lead the project level implementation and documentation of CPP, as 
well as the implementation and reporting of SDAP, GAP and LURT framework. Each subproject 
PIU  will  assign  a  social  (and  environmental)  focal  staff  before  commencement  of  project 
implementation. These focal staffs will assist the social officer to implement and document CPP. 
Each focal staff will lead and document the C&P activities for his/her subproject.  
6. 
Capacity building. The project will engage a national social specialist under the project 
implementation consultant. This specialist, once engaged, will provide necessary advice to and 
training of the social officer and focal staffs on implementation and documentation of CPP. 
7. 
Coordination with GRM. The project and PIUs will establish and maintain a grievance 
redress mechanism (GRM) as an integral part of the EMP and LURTF. Any grievance issues that 
37 These include commercial and service provision enterprises, government agencies, SMCs at county and township 
levels, village service stations associated with township SMSs.  
are raised during C&P will be coordinated through the GRM process. The aggrieved persons will 
be informed of decisions through the GRM mechanism. 
8. 
Documentation.  Results  of  all  C&P  activities  will  be  documented  by  PMO  and  PIUs. 
Annex 1 has given guidance for documentation of C&P events. Extracts from the documentations 
will provide inputs to the project progress reports or internal monitoring reports.
