Project Administration Manual Purpose and Process 
1. 
The  project  administration  manual  (PAM)  describes  the  essential  administrative  and 
management requirements to implement the project on time, within budget, and in accordance with 
the  policies  and  procedures  of  the  government  and  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  The  PAM 
should  include  references  to  all  available  templates  and  instructions  either  through  linkages  to 
relevant URLs or directly incorporated in the PAM. 
2. 
The executing and implementing agencies are wholly responsible for the implementation of 
ADB-financed projects, as agreed jointly between the borrower and ADB, and in accordance with 
the  policies  and  procedures  of  the  government  and  ADB.  ADB  staff  is  responsible  for  supporting 
implementation including compliance by executing  and implementing agencies of their obligations 
and responsibilities for project implementation in accordance with ADB’s policies and procedures. 
3. 
At loan negotiations, the borrower and ADB shall agree to the PAM and ensure consistency 
with the loan agreement. Such agreement shall be reflected in the minutes of the loan negotiations. 
In  the  event  of  any  discrepancy  or  contradiction  between  the  PAM  and  the  loan  agreement,  the 
provisions of the loan agreement shall prevail. 
4. 
After  ADB  Board  approval  of  the  project's  report  and  recommendations  of  the  President 
(RRP), changes in implementation arrangements are subject to agreement and approval pursuant 
to  relevant  government  and  ADB  administrative  procedures  (including  the  Project  Administration 
Instructions) and upon such approval, they will be subsequently incorporated in the PAM. 
I. 
PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
1. 
The  project  will  support  the  rehabilitation  of  irrigation  networks  serving  about  171,100 
hectares (ha) land in the East Kazakhstan, Karaghandy, Kyzylorda, and Zhambyl provinces of 
the Republic of Kazakhstan. The project will promote diversification from traditional low-yielding 
and low-value grain crops into high value cash crops and horticulture crops. It will also build the 
capacity of farmers in water management and the Republic State Enterprise Kazvodkhoz (KVK)’s 
capacity in managing irrigation system and delivery. 
2. 
Agriculture  is  an  important,  but  neglect  sector  in  Kazakhstan’s  national  economy, 
employing 18.0% of the total labor force and contributing 4.4% of gross domestic product in 2017; 
Despite  its  economic  potential,  the  sector  contribution  has  been  decreasing.  Moreover,  about 
42% of the country’s population is located in rural areas with living standards depending heavily 
on  income  generated  from  agricultural  production.  Kazakhstan  has  enormous  underutilized 
agricultural potential that can help make the economic growth more diverse and inclusive. By the 
end of 2018, its agricultural area totaled 221.4 million ha, of which 25.8 million ha or 12% was 
classified as arable land and 186.2 million ha or 84% as  pastureland. Kazakhstan’s per capita 
arable land of about 1.65 ha is the second highest after Australia.  
Before  the  breakup  of  the  Soviet  Union,  Kazakhstan  witnessed  the  construction  of 
3. 
extensive,  centrally  planned  irrigation  systems  that  were  managed  and  operated  by  region 
administration.  After  the  breakup,  between  1991  and  1999,  20.6  million  ha  of  cropland  were 
abandoned, according to an Asian Development Bank (ADB) diagnostic study.  The irrigated area 
was estimated to be 2.3 million ha in 1991; however, by 2018 it had dwindled to about 1.4 million 
ha.  ADB’s diagnostic study identified the key challenges for the sector: (i) restructuring massive 
Soviet  state  farms  into  smaller,  more  efficient  farms;  (ii)  enabling  crop  intensification  to  better 
match highly variable growing conditions; (iii) pricing water appropriately to manage its scarcity 
more effectively; (iv) improving public infrastructure for agriculture development; and (v) reducing 
value-chain fragmentation. 
4. 
The further development of the irrigation subsector is a key element of government efforts 
to diversify Kazakhstan’s economy, promote food security, and reduce poverty. The rehabilitation 
of irrigation schemes and renewed cultivation of abandoned land could help increase agricultural 
productivity and rural incomes. Maximizing the opportunity will depend on agricultural enterprises 
and small farmers responding to market incentives to diversify from traditional low-value and low-
productivity  cereal  crops  to  higher-value  crops  such  as  oilseeds,  vegetables,  and  fruit.  The 
government’s recent irrigated agriculture development plan has set ambitious targets to meet the 
economic development agenda, including the rehabilitation of 600,000 ha of irrigation systems by 
2028.1 To achieve this, the Ministry of Agriculture initiated large irrigation investment projects for 
support from international financial institutions such as ADB, with the primary aim to rehabilitate 
those irrigation schemes that had been poorly maintained and were subsequently abandoned.  
5. 
KVK, established in 2011 by merging various state water enterprises, aims to improve the 
country’s irrigation network performance, asset ownership, and operational responsibility. KVK is 
100% owned by the Committee for Water Resources of the Ministry of Agriculture.2 This structure 
is common among public sectors in Kazakhstan—semiautonomous entities with a more corporate

2 
structure  than  their  parent  committees  and  ministries,  aiming  to  increase  accountability  and 
transparency in public financial management and reporting, and to operate infrastructure more 
sustainably. KVK is improving its governance and capacity by implementing projects financed by 
the  European  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development  and  the  Islamic  Development  Bank. 
KVK needs to further improve its internal governance in financial management, procurement, and 
information  disclosure;  extend  its  advisory  services  to  farmers  for  better  on-farm  water 
management; and support the development of agricultural cooperatives. 
The  project  is  aligned  with  the  government  of  Kazakhstan’s  long-term  development 
6. 
strategy which focuses on improving the quality of life of its population and becoming one of the 
world’s 30 most developed countries by 2050. The project is in line with ADB’s Strategy 2030 for 
supporting  priorities  to  promote  rural  development  and  food  security,  and  address  remaining 
poverty and reduce inequalities.3 The project is consistent with ADB’s county partnership strategy, 
2017–2021  for  Kazakhstan,  which  supports  Kazakhstan  in  achieving  its  medium-term 
development targets and climate change adaptation priorities identified in its national plans and 
commitments under the Paris Agreement on climate change.4 Specifically, ADB is committed to 
support  the  government  in  building  a  more  economically  diversified,  socially  inclusive,  and 
environmentally sustainable Kazakhstan that enjoys high growth rates and stable macroeconomic 
conditions, including provisions of loans to rehabilitate aging irrigation systems and improve water 
use efficiency in farms.  
A. 
Impact and Outcome 
7. 
The  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  the  share  of  agriculture  production 
contribution to gross domestic production increased, as outlined in Strategy Kazakhstan 2050.5 
The project will have the following outcome: farm productivity increased in the East Kazakhstan, 
Karaghandy, Kyzylorda, and Zhambyl province of Kazakhstan provinces.6 
B. 
Outputs 
8. 
Output  1:  Irrigation  infrastructure  rehabilitated  and/or  improved.  The  output  will 
support  the  rehabilitation  and/or  improvement  of  about  245  irrigation  schemes  in  the  four 
provinces. For canals, the works would involve desilting and removal of vegetation in the lined 
and unlined canals, re-sectioning of the unlined canals, and repair of damaged sections of the 
lined  canals.  The  total  length  of  new  concrete  lined  canals  will  be  about  1,064  km  while  the 
improved earth canals will be about 1,976 km. A total of about 4,185 hydraulic structures including 
water measuring devices will be constructed or rehabilitated. About 358 km drainage collectors 
will be rehabilitated and/or improved. A drip irrigation system to cover 9,300 ha will be established 
in Zhambyl province. In addition, about 24 sets of the  supervisory control and data acquisition 
(SCADA) system will be installed in the main canals of the four provinces.

COSTS AND FINANCING 
14. 
The  project  is  estimated  to  cost  T121.29  billion  ($320.88  million  equivalent).  ADB  will 
finance  the  expenditures  in  relation  to  civil  works,  goods,  consulting  services,  project 
management  costs,  including  recurrent  project  management  costs,  and  75%  of  contingency 
costs.  KVK  will  contribute  Z26.87  billion  ($71.08  million  equivalent)  to  cover  financial  charges 
during implementation and 25% of contingency costs. 
A. 
Cost Estimates Preparation and Revisions  
15. 
The technical assistance (TA) consultants including a national design entity prepared the 
cost estimates in consultation with KVK, Committee for Water Resources, and ADB. Costing was 
completed using government costing standards, and costing information from site investigations, 
the TA consultants’ project files, and queries with suppliers. During project implementation, KVK 
and PMO, together with the PIUs, will revise the cost estimates with the assistance of the project 
design, construction supervision, and implementation support consultants.

a  Includes  taxes  and  duties  of  T8.29  billion  ($21.92  million)  to  be  financed  from  Asian  Development  Bank  loan 
resources. Such amount does not represent an excessive share of the project cost.  
b  In first quarter of 2019 prices as of 20 May 2019. 
c  Physical contingencies computed at 10.0% for civil works, goods, and services. Price contingencies computed at an 
average of 4.4% on local currency costs.  
d  Includes  interest charges and  commitment  charges. Interest  during  construction  for the  tenge  loan  from  ordinary 
capital resources has been computed at 9.5% per year (based on prevailing yield of comparable government-issued 
fixed-rate securities, plus an effective contractual spread of 0.5%). Commitment charge for the tenge loan is 0.15% 
per year to be charged on the undisbursed loan amount.

18. 
KVK  has  requested  a  regular  loan  of  up  to  T94.42  billion  from  ADB’s  ordinary  capital 
resources to help finance the project. The loan, to be guaranteed by the Republic of Kazakhstan, 
in tenge will have a term of 20.5 years, including a grace period of 5 years; an interest rate equal 
to the sum of ADB’s cost of funding, plus an effective contractual spread for sovereign-guaranteed 
11 
loans of 0.50% per year; and a commitment charge of 0.15% per year on the undisbursed loan 
amount. The loan is expected to be disbursed in 8–10 tranches, each for $20 million minimum in 
tenge equivalent. Subject to market conditions, ADB will provide tenge financing to fund the loan 
by amortized bonds with maturities of up to 10 years. ADB will also be able to provide financing 
in  currencies  where  it  can  effectively  intermediate,  such  as  United  States  dollar.  Based  on 
straight-line repayment method, the average loan maturity is 13 years, and there is no maturity 
premium  payable  to  ADB.  ADB  will  finance  the  expenditures  in  relation  to  civil  works,  goods, 
consulting services, and project management, including recurrent project management costs and 
75% of contingency costs, inclusive of taxes and duties. KVK will contribute the balance to cover 
financial charges and 25% of contingencies costs.

FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT 
A. 
Financial Management Assessment (FMA) 
20. 
The  FMA  was  conducted  from  March  2018  to  March  2019  in  accordance  with  ADB’s 
Guidelines  for  the  Financial  Management  and  Analysis  of  Projects  and  the  Financial  Due 
Diligence: A Methodology Note.  The FMA considered the capacity of KVK, including funds-flow 
arrangements,  advance  account  management,  staffing,  accounting  and  financial  reporting 
systems, financial information systems, and internal and external auditing arrangements. Based 
on the assessment, the key financial management risk is that staff lacks the necessary experience 
with ADB projects, procedures, and requirements on financial management. It was concluded that 
the overall pre-mitigation financial management risk of KVK is  Substantial. KVK has agreed to 
implement an action plan as key measures to address the deficiencies. With the implementation

Disbursement 
1. 
Disbursement Arrangements for ADB and ADB-administered Funds 
The  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  Loan  Disbursement 
21. 
Handbook  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time),7  and  detailed  arrangements  agreed  upon 
between the government and ADB. Online training for project staff on disbursement policies and 
procedures  is  available.8  Project  staff  are  encouraged  to  avail  of  this  training  to  help  ensure 
efficient disbursement and fiduciary control. 
22. 
KVK will use direct payment and advance account loan disbursement procedures. KVK 
will  submit  the  annual  disbursement  projections,  including  contract  awards  projections  to  ADB 
and will be responsible for requesting budgetary allocations for counterpart funds. 
23. 
Advance fund procedure. KVK will establish an advance account in KTZ at a commercial 
bank for  receipt  of funds from  ADB. The  advance account  is to be  used exclusively  for  ADB’s 
share  of  eligible  expenditures.  KVK  who  administers  the  advance  account  is  accountable  and 
responsible for proper use of advances to the advance account and for monthly liquidations.  
24. 
The total outstanding advance to the advance accounts should not exceed the estimate 
of ADB’s share of expenditures to be paid through the advance accounts for the forthcoming six 
months or $20 million equivalent in tenge, whichever is higher. Since it is a local currency loan, a 
special arrangement of advance fund procedure with a minimum of $20 million equivalent in tenge 
for  each  withdrawal  will  be  used  for  the  project  because  each  disbursement  will  require  the 
issuance of a new bond, which takes time and resources to complete. KVK may request for initial 
and  additional  advances  to  the  advance  account  based  on  an  Estimate  of  Expenditure  Sheet 
setting out the estimated expenditures to be financed through the account for the forthcoming six 
months. Supporting documents should be submitted to ADB or retained by KVK in accordance 
with ADB’s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time) when liquidating 
or replenishing the advance accounts. 
25. 
Statement  of  expenditure  procedure  (SOE).  The  SOE  procedure  may  be  used  for 
reimbursement of eligible expenditures or liquidation of advances to the advance account. The 
ceiling  of  the  SOE  is  the  equivalent  of  $100,000  or  below  per  individual  payment.  Supporting 
documents and records for the expenditures claimed under the SOE should be maintained and 
made readily available for review by ADB’s disbursement and review missions. Reimbursement 
and liquidation of individual payments in excess of the SOE ceiling should be supported by full 
documentation when submitting the withdrawal application. 
26.  Withdrawal applications (WA). Before the submission of the first withdrawal application, 
KVK should submit to ADB sufficient evidence of the authority of the person(s) who will sign the 
withdrawal applications on behalf of the government, together with the authenticated specimen 
signatures  of  each  authorized  person.  Withdrawal  applications  require  32  Banking  Days 
processing from the date of the receipt of the complete withdrawal applications and documents 
by ADB. The minimum value per WA is stipulated in the Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as 
amended from time to time). Individual payments below such amount should be paid (i) by KVK 
7  The handbook is available electronically from the ADB website (http://www.adb.org/documents/ loan-disbursement-
handbook 
8  Disbursement eLearning. http://wpqr4.adb.org/disbursement_elearning  
20 
and  subsequently  claimed  to  ADB  through  reimbursement,  or  (ii)  through  the  advance  fund 
procedure, unless otherwise accepted by ADB. The borrower should ensure sufficient category 
and  contract  balances  before  requesting  disbursements.  Use  of  ADB’s  Client  Portal  for 
Disbursements (CPD)9 system is encouraged for submission of withdrawal applications to ADB.  
2. 
Disbursement Arrangements for Counterpart Fund 
For the counterpart share, the government will allocate the budget in the Province’s Public

source for all expenditures incurred on the project. KVK will prepare consolidated project financial 
statements in accordance with cash basis International Public Sector Accounting Standards. 
D. 
Auditing and Public Disclosure 
29. 
KVK will cause the detailed project financial statements to be audited in accordance with 
International Standards on Auditing and the government’s audit requirements, by an independent 
auditor  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  audited  project  financial  statements  (APFS)  together  with  the 
auditor’s opinion will be presented in English language to ADB within six (6) months from the end 
of the fiscal year by KVK.  
The audit report for the project financial statements will include a management letter and 
30. 
auditor’s opinions, which cover (i) whether the project financial statements present an accurate 
and fair view or are presented fairly, in all material respects, in accordance with the applicable 
financial reporting standards; (ii) whether the proceeds of the loan were used only for the purposes 
of  the  project;  and  (iii)  whether  the  borrower  or  executing  agency  was  in  compliance  with  the 
financial covenants contained in the legal agreements (where applicable). 
31. 
KVK will also cause the entity-level financial statements to be audited in accordance with 
International Standards on Auditing, by an independent auditor acceptable to ADB. The audited 
entity-level financial statements together with the auditors’ report will be submitted in the English 
language to ADB within one month after their approval by the relevant authority. 
Compliance with financial reporting and auditing requirements will be monitored by review 
32. 
missions and during normal program supervision, and followed up regularly with all concerned, 
including the external auditor.  
The  government  and  KVK  have  been  made  aware  of  ADB’s  approach  to  delayed 
33. 
submission,  and  the  requirements  for  satisfactory  and  acceptable  quality  of  the  APFS.10  ADB 
9  The CPD facilitates online submission of WA to ADB, resulting in faster disbursement. The forms to be completed by 
the Borrower are available online at https://www.adb.org/documents/client-portal-disbursements-guide. 
10 ADB’s approach and procedures regarding delayed submission of APFS:  
(i)  When APFS are not received by the due date, ADB will write to the executing agency advising that (a) the 
audit  documents  are  overdue;  and  (b)  if they  are not  received  within  the  next  6  months, requests for  new 
contract  awards  and  disbursement  such  as  new  replenishment  of  advance  accounts,  processing  of  new 
reimbursement, and issuance of new commitment letters will not be processed. 
21 
reserves the right to require a change in the auditor (in a manner consistent with the constitution 
of the borrower), or for additional support to be provided to the auditor, if the audits required are 
not conducted in a manner satisfactory to ADB, or if the audits are substantially delayed. ADB 
reserves  the  right  to  verify  the  project's  financial  accounts  to  confirm  that  the  share  of  ADB’s 
financing is used in accordance with ADB’s policies and procedures.  
34. 
Public  disclosure  of  the  APFS,  including  the  auditor’s  opinion  on  the  project  financial 
statements, will be guided by ADB’s Access to Information Policy 2018.11 After the review, ADB 
will disclose the APFS and the opinion of the auditors on the project financial statements no later 
than 14 days of ADB’s confirmation of their acceptability by posting them on ADB’s website. The 
management letter, additional auditor’s opinions, and audited entity financial statements will not 
be disclosed.12

The indicative procurement packages for goods, works and consulting services and their 
38. 
procurement  and/or  selection  methods  are  indicated  in  the  draft  procurement  plan.  The 
procurement  methods  have  been  identified  based  on  the findings  of  project  procurement  risks 
assessment and strategic procurement planning study. Open competitive bidding (OCB) is the 
default procurement method.  
39. 
The  recruitment  of  international  consulting  firm  is  a  strategic  security  to  help  KVK  with 
design,  procurement,  and  supervisions  of  strategically  critical  large  civil  works  packages  on 
rehabilitation  of  irrigation  facilities.  These  packages  will  be  procured  through  OCB  with 
international advertising. 
40. 
The procurement of office and workshop equipment, vehicles, training, audit and socio-
economic  survey  will  be  tactical  acquisition  to  satisfy  routine  requirements  for  project 
implementation, accountability, and monitoring. These packages are locally available and shall 
be procured through request for quotations for goods, and Consultant Qualification Selection for 
consulting services. 
41. 
The procurement of O&M equipment, as well as small works for construction of KVK office 
and rehabilitation of irrigation system will be tactical advantage as they are readily available from 
alternative sources and offer an opportunity to reduce overall project costs. These packages will 
be procured through OCB with international advertising for equipment and national advertising for 
works. 
42. 
All OCBs with international advertising for works, goods, and services shall be subject for 
ADB’s prior review procedure. First OCBs and request for quotations with national advertising for 
works, goods, and services shall be subject for ADB’s prior review while subsequent contracts 
can follow post review procedures upon ADB’s consent at project implementation stage.

National  Environmental  Assessments  (OVOSes)  for  detailed  design  will  be 
prepared based on the IEEs;  
OVOSes  are  submitted  to  the  State  Ecological  Expertise  and  environmental 
clearance  of  the  State  Environmental  Review  (Ekologicheskaya  Expertiza)  is 
sought thereof before starting civil works; 
the EMPs are included in the bidding documents for all contracts; 
all contractors prepare and submit site-specific EMPs based on the generic EMPs 
work out during project preparation to the PMO/PIUs for approval at least 10 days 
before taking possession of any work site;  
no access to the site will be allowed to the contractors until the site specific EMPs 
are approved by the PMO/PMUs; 
implementation of the site-specific EMPs is regularly supervised and monitored by 
the construction supervision consultants (CSCs), and ensured by PMUs;  
a non-compliance notice will be issued if the contractors are not in compliance with 
the requirements of IEEs, EMPs, and/or environmental provisions of contractual 
documents. In case of non-compliance the contractors are required to prepare a 
corrective action plan, which is to be implemented by a date agreed with the PMUs; 
preparation  of  a  consolidated  semi-annual  Environmental  Monitoring  Report 
(EMR)  summarizing  environmental  performance  on  all  subprojects  under 
implementation and its submission to ADB for review and disclosure within 1 month 
after the reporting period; and 
in  case  of  unpredicted  environmental 
impacts  occurring  during  project

 Involuntary resettlement (category C). Due diligence identified no land acquisition and 
resettlement  impacts.  Due  diligence  looked  into the (i)  rehabilitation  of  existing  549  canals,  23 
pipelines, and 43 drain ditches in 245 irrigation schemes to be supported by the project; and (ii) 
construction  of  the  KVK  headquarters  building  in  Nur-Sultan,  the  capital  city.  It  found  that  the 
canals and ditches are state-owned and the land for the construction of the KVK building is owned 
by  the  municipality.  Project  works  include  rehabilitation  of  the  irrigation  canals  to  their  original 
designs (with and without lining) without widening or changing their rights-of-way, routes, layouts, 
and capacities. Following the main principle and objective of the Safeguard Policy Statement, the 
project design incorporated appropriate civil works technologies to avoid any adverse impact. The 
details were discussed in the due diligence report and their implementation will be monitored and 
reported by KVK through semiannual and annual social safeguard reports.17 A grievance redress 
mechanism  has  been  established,  including  appointment  of  the  staff  of  district  and  provincial 
authorities as well as provincial and central KVK staff. Disclosure and public consultations were 
carried out by the TA consultants and project team in all project areas in line with Safeguard Policy 
Statement requirements, and will continue to take place during the project implementation. Since 
KVK is new to ADB-financed projects, ADB will arrange capacity building workshops and on-the-
job-training for KVK staff on social safeguards.  
Indigenous  Peoples  (category  C).  No  ethnic  minority  communities  are  present  in the 
56. 
project area, and the project does not trigger ADB’s policy requirements on indigenous peoples 
under the Safeguard Policy Statement.

VII.  GENDER AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS 
57. 
A poverty, social, and gender assessment was conducted by the TA consultants and the 
project team during project preparation, and the project has several measures built in to ensure 
social inclusion. The project is expected to reduce poverty among the local populations by making 
the supply of irrigation water more reliable and introducing advanced farming technologies. The 
project  will  directly  benefit  the  well-being  of  the  local  populations  who  rely  on  farming  as  an 
important  source  of  income.  Both  men  and  women  are  involved  in  farming,  mainly  through 
peasant farms. Households in the project-covered areas are mostly large rural families that are 
more at risk of poverty, so addressing the problem of low agricultural yields and low farm income 
is particularly important.  
Six project disclosure and public consultations were conducted by the TA consultants and 
58. 
project team for all subprojects in the four project provinces. Farmers and residents from all the 
project’s districts participated in the public consultations, which were chaired by the heads and 
deputy  heads  of  the  districts,  KVK  provincial  branches,  and  local  governments.  Farmers  and 
residents expressed their need for the project and raised questions or made suggestions on its 
design and implementation. ADB and KVK will hold further consultations on the detailed design 
and during implementation to ensure that local people participate in and benefit from the project 
activities. 
The project is classified effective gender mainstreaming, and a gender action plan was 
59. 
prepared by KVK with TA consultants’ assistance. Based on the social and gender assessment 
conducted  during  project  preparation,  gender  entry  points  for  the  project  outputs  include  (i) 
women’s participation (30%) in public consultations in all project phases; (ii) women-owned and/or 
-led farms (20%) directly benefiting from rehabilitated irrigation infrastructure; (iii) women farmers’ 
participation in training relevant to water management, agricultural practices, and operation and 
use of water metering devices and other digital technologies; (iv) a gender diagnostic study of 
KVK; and (v) institutionalized reporting of the project’s gender mainstreaming performance. The 
gender action plan is presented below.

B. 
Monitoring 
61. 
Project performance monitoring. KVK will ensure that PMO and PIUs, with support of 
the  project  implementation  consultants,  will  monitor  project  performance  using  the  targets, 
indicators,  milestones  and/or  activities,  assumptions,  and  risks  in  the  DMF  and  GAP,  and 
establish  an  adequate  project  performance  monitoring  system  within  3  months  of  project 
effectiveness.  The  project  monitoring  and  evaluation  will  assess  the  following  outputs  and 
indicators (i) progress of planned activities according to the milestones; (ii) progress in achieving 
each  project  output  and  project  outcome  according  to  the  performance  targets  and  indicators 
indicated in the DMF and GAP; and (iii) social and economic benefits with focus on the poor and 
women. Disaggregated baseline data for output and outcome indicators gathered during project 
processing will be updated and reported quarterly through the quarterly progress reports and after 
each ADB review mission. These quarterly progress reports will provide information necessary to 
update ADB's project performance reporting system.18 Project performance monitoring will involve 
a participatory approach, including inputs from agriculture cooperatives and KVK branch offices 
facilitated  by  the  project  implementation  consultants  and  community  development  teams  to 
ensure timely collection of quality data.

35 
62. 
Compliance  monitoring.  All  project  assurances  including  policy,  legal,  financial, 
economic,  physical,  environmental,  gender,  and  other  safeguard  measures  will  be  monitored 
through quarterly progress reports, and twice a year, during ADB loan review missions. ADB will 
also  monitor  the  progress  of  achievement  of each output  and outcome  based  on  performance 
indicators  with  targets,  and  each  activity  based  on  milestones  indicated  in  the  DMF  through  a 
project management information system. 
Safeguards  monitoring.  The  PMO,  together  with  the  PIUs,  will  submit  to  ADB  semi-
63. 
annual safeguards monitoring reports during the construction phase until the project completion 
report  will  be  issued,  and  disclose  relevant  information  from  such  reports  to  affected  persons 
promptly  upon  submission  (local  disclosure  and  on  ADB’s  website).  If  any  unanticipated 
environmental  and/or  social  risks  and  impacts  arise  during  construction,  implementation  or 
operation  of  the  project  or  any  subproject  that  were  not  considered  in  the  respective  IEE  and 
EMP, the PMO and PIUs will promptly inform ADB of the occurrence of such risks or impacts, 
with detailed description of the event and proposed corrective action plan. The PMO, together 
with  the  PIUs,  will  report  any  actual  or  potential  breach  of  compliance  with  the  measures  and 
requirements set forth in the EMP promptly after becoming aware of the breach. PMO and PIUs 
will conduct social safeguards monitoring of the project during project implementation stage and 
semi-annual and annual social safeguards monitoring reports will be prepared and disclosed. 
64.  Gender  and  social  dimensions  monitoring.  The  PMO  and  PIUs,  with  support  of  the 
project  implementation  consultant,  will  be responsible for monitoring the  implementation  of the 
GAP and the preparation of the monitoring reports that will be submitted to ADB.19 
C. 
Evaluation 
65. 
Inception Mission. ADB will conduct an inception mission within 3 months of loan signing 
to assess  project readiness  and  implementation arrangements  including establishment  of  PIU, 
opening  of  advance  accounts,  progress  of  recruitment  of  consulting  services,  status  of  the 
development  of  the  project  performance  monitoring  system,  and  progress  of  advance 
procurement actions. 
66. 
Review Missions. ADB will field review missions at least twice a year to (i) assess the 
progress of project activities and outputs and effectiveness of implementation arrangements, (ii) 
monitor the implementation of GAP and safeguard compliance with SPS, (iii) review compliance 
with loan agreement and related matters, (iv) follow up on decisions and actions agreed during 
previous review missions, and (v) resolve any project implementation issues that may arise. ADB 
will conduct a midterm review in the third year of project implementation. The midterm review will 
(i) assess the project performance and achievement against targets and milestones in the DMF; 
(ii) review the initial outcomes, benefits, and impact of the project; and (iii) identify gaps, if any, 
and  recommend  necessary  changes  to  strengthen  implementation  arrangements  or  modify 
project design. 
67.  Midterm Review. The Borrower and ADB shall conduct a comprehensive midterm review 
of the project after the third year of project implementation. The mission will review (i) institutional,

68. 
Project Completion Review. Promptly after physical completion of the project, but in any 
event not later than six (6) months of physical completion of the project, the  executing agency 
shall prepare and submit a project completion report to ADB. ADB will field a project completion 
review mission upon physical completion of the project to commence preparation of ADB’s project 
completion report. The mission will (i) provide a concise description of the project and its rationale; 
(ii) assess the adequacy of preparation, design, implementation arrangements, and due diligence, 
including  how  problems  were  identified  and  handled,  whether  they  were  foreseen  as  potential 
risks at appraisal, and the adequacy of the solutions adopted during implementation; (iii) evaluate 
the  relevance  of  project  design  at  appraisal  and  at  completion,  effectiveness  in  achieving 
outcomes and attribution to the project by assessing achievements of output targets, efficiency in 
delivering outputs, and sustainability of achieving output and outcome targets; (iv) evaluate the 
performance of the borrower, executing agency, cofinanciers (as applicable) and ADB; (v) identify 
remaining issues and lessons learned from the project; (vi) suggest follow-up actions if required; 
and  (vii)  make  recommendations—based  on  the  evaluation  and  lessons  learned—for  future 
project design and implementation as well as improvements in related ADB procedures. 
69. 
Promptly after physical completion of the  project, but in any event not later than six (6) 
months thereafter or such later date as may be agreed for this purpose between the Borrower 
and ADB, the Borrower shall prepare and furnish to ADB a report, in such form and in such detail 
as ADB shall reasonably request, on the execution and initial operation of the project, including 
its cost, the performance by the Borrower of its obligations under the Loan Agreement and the 
accomplishment of the purposes of the Loan. 
D. 
Reporting 
KVK will provide ADB with (i) quarterly progress reports in a format consistent with ADB's 
70. 
project  performance  reporting  system;  (ii)  consolidated  annual  reports  including  (a)  progress 
achieved  by  output  as  measured  through  the  indicator's  performance  targets,  (b)  key 
implementation  issues  and  solutions,  (c)  updated  procurement  plan,  and  (d)  updated 
implementation  plan  for  the  next  12  months;  and  (iii)  a  project  completion  report  within  six  (6) 
months  of  physical  completion  of  the  project.  To  ensure  that  projects  will  continue  to  be  both 
viable and sustainable, project accounts and the KVK audited financial statement together with 
the associated auditor's report should be adequately reviewed. 
E. 
Stakeholder Communication Strategy  
71. 
Project information will be strategically disseminated through media at main  milestones 
including loan signing, contract awards and project completion. A grievance redress mechanism 
will  be  established  at  the  PMO  and  PIUs,  with  detailed  contact  information  including  phone 
number and email address.

ANTICORRUPTION POLICY 
72. 
ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any violations of the 
Anticorruption  Policy  relating  to  the  project.20  All  contracts  financed  by  ADB  shall  include 
provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the 
executing agency and all project contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers. 
Individuals and/or entities on ADB’s anticorruption debarment list are ineligible to participate in 
ADB-financed activity and may not be awarded any contracts under the project.21 
To support these efforts, relevant provisions are included in the loan agreement and the 
73. 
bidding documents for the project. 
XI. 
ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISM 
74. 
People who  are,  or may  in the future  be,  adversely  affected  by  the  project may  submit 
complaints  to  ADB’s  Accountability  Mechanism.  The  Accountability  Mechanism  provides  an 
independent forum and process whereby people adversely affected by ADB-assisted projects can 
voice,  and  seek  a  resolution  of  their  problems,  as  well  as  report  alleged  violations  of  ADB’s 
operational  policies  and  procedures.  Before  submitting  a  complaint  to  the  Accountability 
Mechanism, affected people should make an effort in good faith to solve their problems by working 
with  the  concerned  ADB  operations  department.  Only  after  doing  that,  and  if  they  are  still 
dissatisfied, should they approach the Accountability Mechanism.22

(iv) 
(v) 
design reports, and cost estimates of all the subprojects reservoir, weirs, irrigation 
systems, on-farm water management components, water shed management, and 
allied works. The consultants will prepare construction schedule using critical path 
method analysis and schedules for annual construction expenditures, both for local 
and foreign currency components, throughout the construction period. The reference 
to  design  codes,  parameters,  standards,  criteria,  and  calculation  used  will  be 
referenced in the feasibility reports. Soft copy of the design calculations in excel file 
or any other software used will be submitted with the design reports. The consultant 
shall first submit the draft Detailed Design Report for review by the PMO and the

utmost confidentiality. For the purpose of cost estimating: 
a) 
all  unit  prices for major quantities  of  work  shall be  established by  the  latest 
methods. These methods will simulate each construction activity in such a way 
as to fit it into the available time span in the proposed construction schedule. 
Construction  equipment,  crews,  materials,  and  other  resources  would  be 
adjusted  to  accomplish  the  work  within  the  required  time  span.  The 
computations  of  unit  prices  shall  be  supported  by  detailed  sets  of  financial 
prices with source; 
indirect  cost  of  construction  for  all  major  items,  into  which  the  construction 
work  is  subdivided  for  cost  estimating  purpose,  should  be  established 
separately.  Total  cost  of  each  construction  item  shall  then  be  obtained  by 
multiplying  the  direct  cost  of  construction  by  a  bid  factor  representing  the 
influence of indirect cost; 
preparation of cost estimates broken into local and foreign components. These 
shall include: 
• 
reasonable  breakdown  by  major  items  of  electro-mechanical  and  civil 
works,  irrigation  system,  on-farm  water  management,  and  water  shed
