The project administration manual (PAM) describes essential requirements for the Ministry of 
Finance, Agency for Implementation of Projects in the field of Agroindustry and Food Security 
(AIFSA)1  –  the  executing  agency,  and  the  participating  financial  institutions  (PFIs)  – 
implementing  agencies  to  carry  out  the  project  in  accordance  with  the  loan  and  project 
agreements of the government of Uzbekistan and the participating financial institutions (PFIs) 
and Asian Development Bank (ADB). The PAM provides relevant reporting requirements and 
instructions either through linkages to relevant URLs or direct reference. 
  The MOF, AIFSA and PFIs are wholly responsible for the implementation of the ADB-financed 
project, in accordance with the loan and project agreements entered into by the government and 
ADB and each PFI. ADB staff is responsible for supporting implementation including monitoring 
compliance by MOF, AIFSA, and each PFI. 
  At loan negotiations, the Government of Uzbekistan and ADB shall agree to the PAM and ensure 
consistency  with  the  loan  and  project  agreement.  Such  agreement  shall  be  reflected  in  the 
minutes of the loan negotiations. In the event of any discrepancy or contradiction between the 
PAM and the loan and project agreements, the provisions of the loan and project agreements 
shall prevail. 
  After ADB Board approval of the project, changes in implementation arrangements are subject 
to agreement and approval by the Government of Uzbekistan, the PFIs and ADB and upon such 
approval, such changes will be incorporated in the updated PAM. 
1  AIFSA  was  established  through  the  merger  of  the  Rural  Restructuring  Agency  (RRA)  and the  Center  for  Implementation  of the 
Projects in Agricultural and Water Sector (CIPAWS) in accordance with Presidential Decree No. UP-5418 dated 17 April 2018. The

Project Organization Structure  
2. 
The Agency for Implementation of Projects in the Field of Agro-industry and Food Security 
(AIFSA) will be the executing agency. A project management office (PMO) is set up under the 
existing organization of AIFSA. The PMO will be provided with staff and operational costs and be 
responsible for monitoring the project implementation, including training, capacity development, 
and providing technical support to PFIs. To enhance capacity of the AIFSA, PMO staff will include 
in-house  AIFSA  staff  and  contracted  experts  to  save  the  cost  of  engaging  a  large  team  of 
consultants for project management and to ensure efficient utilization of the loan fund allocated 
to project management (estimated at $3.0 million). A list of PMO staff is in Table 3. Each PFI will 
establish  a  project  implementation  unit  (PIU)  under  its  existing  structure  to  oversee  the 
implementation of the credit line activities at the respective PFI. The project organization chart is 
in Figure 1.

19. 
Based on detailed Eligibility Criteria for Participating Financial Institutions (PFI) in Section 
D.1 (above), eight (8) financial institutions are qualified and included as implementing agencies 
for the proposed project. They are: Asaka Bank, Davr Bank, Hamkorbank, Ipak Yuli Bank, Ipoteka 
Bank, National Bank of Uzbekistan (NBU), Turon Bank, and Uzpromstroybank. 
Four financial institutions namely Agrobank, Microkreditbank, QQB, and Xalq Bank did not 
20. 
qualify,  but  have  all  indicated  continued  interest  in  participating  in the  proposed  project.  Aloqa 
Bank and Orient Finance Bank expressed its interest in participation on 30 August 2016 and on 
29  September  2016  respectively  through  AIFSA.  It  is  proposed  that  all  these  six  financial 
institutions  be  included  in  the  project  as  potential  partners  for  another  round  of  accreditation 
during the project implementation, subject to loan fund utilization and availability at that point in 
time.

COSTS AND FINANCING

A. 
Allocation and Withdrawal of Loan Proceeds 
21. 
The government has requested a loan in various currencies equivalent to $154.0 million 
from  ADB’s  Special  Funds resources to  help finance the  project.  The  loan  will  have  a  25-year 
term,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years,  an  interest  rate  of  2.0%  per  annum  (interest  to  be 
capitalized during project implementation), and such other terms and conditions set forth in the 
draft  loan  and  project  agreements.  Subborrowers  will  contribute  $40.0  million  as  their  equity 
contribution for subprojects financed by the loan and the Government will contribute $21.0 million, 
including $19 million through exemptions of taxes and duties for imported goods and $2 million 
for interest charge during implementation.1 The government will relend the proceeds of the loan 
in US dollars through subsidiary loan agreements to PFIs that satisfy ADB’s eligibility criteria set 
out in the PAM and the loan and project agreements.2 The government is expected to relend the 
proceeds of the loan to the PFIs at the same tenor and grace period at which it received the funds 
from ADB. The government’s relending rate will be the interest rate charged by ADB for the loan 
plus an appropriate margin to cover administrative and risk costs on the PFIs.3 PFIs’ subloans 
may be issued in US dollars and/or local currency, and priced by PFIs at market rates that cover 
risks related to foreign exchange, credit, maturity, and interest rates. Repayment of subloans may 
be in US dollars and/or local currency subject to the subborrowers’ demand and revenue stream 
of  the  subprojects  as  well  as  specific  agreements  between  PFIs  and  subborrowers.  Subloans 
extended by PFIs will have a tenor up to 10 years. PFIs will determine the creditworthiness of 
subborrowers  and  assume  the  full  credit  risk.  The  maximum  subloan  size  will  be  $5.0  million 
based on previous and prospective demand of PFIs’ clientele. Allocation of loan proceeds as of 
30 June 2019 is in Table 4.

policy of each PFI would range from 20% to 30% of the subproject cost.  
2   Based on each PFI absorptive capacity, tentative loan allocation is set as follows: Hamkorbank ($25 million), Ipak 
Yuli Bank ($10 million), Davr Bank ($6 million), Ipoteka Bank ($11 million), Turon Bank ($5 million), Asaka Bank ($10 
million), Uzpromstroybank ($15 million), and National Bank of Uzbekistan ($50 million). An amount of $17 million is 
reserved for competitive withdrawal and/or new PFI accreditation.    
3  The government will charge the interest on the ADB loan plus 0.2% per annum to the PFIs. The PFIs’ interest rates 
carry the cost for (i) loan origination, (ii) the provision of foreign exchange to service the ADB loan, and (iii) credit risk 
and related capital charges.

Table 4 also presents preliminary credit line allocations to each qualified PFI based on the 
ability to absorb the ADB’s loan fund and the capacity to disburse subloans among others. An 
unallocated fund of $19 million was reallocated for competitive utilization based on demand and 
for the second round of accreditation of PFIs during the project implementation period. The Loan 
Agreement provides that the Government shall reallocate the funds among the PFIs in a manner 
acceptable to ADB should there be a change in the composition of the PFIs or a need to reallocate 
the proceeds of the ADB loan.

FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT 
A. 
Financial Management Assessment 
A  financial  management  assessment  (FMA)  of  the  proposed  project  was  conducted 
24. 
between  June  and  August  2016  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  Guidelines  for  the  Financial 
18 
Management  and  Analysis  of  Projects,4  ADB’s  Financial  Due  Diligence: A  Methodology  Note,5 
and ADB’s Technical Guidance Note on Financial Management Assessment.6 The FMA covered 
the  role  of  the  Agency  for  Implementation  of  Projects  in  the  Field  of  Agro-industry  and  Food 
Security  (AIFSA)  as  the  executing  agency  for  the  project  and  eight  participating  financial 
institutions  (PFIs)  as  implementing  agencies  for  the  project  (National  Bank  of  Uzbekistan, 
Uzpromstroybank,  Asaka  Bank,  Ipoteka  Bank,  Hamkorbank,  Ipak  Yuli  Bank,  Turon  Bank,  and 
Davr Bank). 
Agency  for  Implementation  of  Projects  in  the  Field  of  Agro-industry  and  Food 
25. 
Security  (AIFSA).  Based  on  the  assessment  of  AIFSA,  there  are  no  significant  financial 
management risks in respect of AIFSA’s proposed role in project management under HVCDP. 
AIFSA has significant experience in the implementation of projects financed by ADB, the World 
Bank  and  other  international  financial  institutions.  The  financial  management  arrangements  in 
place for those projects are appropriate for HVCDP. AIFSA is institutionally capable and familiar 
with projects of a similar nature. Based on lessons learnt from previous ADB-financed projects 
with  AIFSA  as  the  executing  agency,  the  following  features  have  been  included  in  the  project 
design  to  preempt  potential  procurement  issues:  (i)  over  95%  of  the  loan  proceeds  will  be 
channeled directly to PFIs through imprest accounts established at commercial banks acceptable 
to  ADB,  and  not  through  AIFSA;  (ii)  AIFSA  is  only  tasked  with  project  management  and 
implementation  activities  to  monitor  sublending,  compliances  for  safeguards,  gender,  and 
financial covenants, financial auditing, and capacity building and technical support to PFIs and 
subborrowers;  (iii)  total  project  loan  allocation  to  AIFSA  is  only  $3.0  million,  which  entails  the 
purchase  of  some  minor  items  such  as  vehicles,  office  equipment  and  supplies,  and  service 
contracts of some technical experts and there is no works contract procurement involving AIFSA; 
and (iv) the Borrower covenants are included in the loan agreement to ensure that AIFSA has 
sufficient funds to satisfy its liabilities arising from any goods and/or consulting services contracts. 
26. 
Participating Financial Institutions. No key financial management risks exist in relation 
to the proposed PFIs that would undermine implementation of the project. Several of the PFIs 
have limitations in staffing in respect of accounting, internal audit and risk management. Some 
PFIs also have other minor financial management limitations. However, these limitations have not 
adversely affected the implementation of other projects or the delivery of credit funds financed by 
government  or  international  financial  institutions. No  specific  actions to  address  PFIs’ financial 
management limitations prior to the withdrawal of funds by PFIs are recommended. Actions to 
address each PFI’s and AIFSA’s financial management limitations during project implementation 
are provided in Table 7.

PFI  prepares  the  first  six-month’s  disbursement  projections  (based  on  estimates  of 
market demand for potential horticulture-related subloans) for the initial 6 months after 
project start-up for ADB’s project division (CWER) endorsement. 
PFI  submits  a  withdrawal  application  for  initial  advance  after  confirming  that  all  the 
disbursement  conditions  have  been  met,  and  the  first  six-month’s  disbursement 
projections to AIFSA for checking and transmission to ADB. 
ADB reviews the withdrawal application and makes necessary advance to PFI’s imprest 
account opened at a commercial bank acceptable to ADB.8 
PFI submits the first three subloan applications to AIFSA for checking and forwarding 
for ADB’s review and approval. 
PFI disburses subloans. 
PFI submits withdrawal application to AIFSA for checking and transmission to ADB. 
ADB reviews withdrawal and replenishes PFI’s imprest account as necessary. 
For  subsequent  six-month  periods,  (a)  PFI  disburses subloans  using the  fund  in  the 
imprest account; (b) PFI then submit documents (including list of disbursed subloans 
and  withdrawal  application)  to  AIFSA  for  checking  of  eligibility  (if  any  issues,  AIFSA 
clarifies with PFI); and (c) ADB reviews withdrawal and replenishes imprest account as 
necessary. 
31. 
The  ADB’s  ADF  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  Loan 
7 CBU prudential regulations are presented in Supplementary Document 19 (Annex). 
8 All eight selected PFIs are capable of (i) executing foreign exchange and local currency transactions; (ii) handling a 
large volume of transactions; and (iii) issuing detailed monthly bank statements promptly. Therefore, these PFIs can 
open separate accounts and/or sub-ledgers for ADB funds in their own accounting systems for the project purpose. 
21 
Disbursement  Handbook  (2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time),  and  detailed  arrangements 
agreed  upon  between  the  government  and  ADB.  The  PFIs  will  be  responsible  for  preparing 
disbursement  projections;  collecting  and  retaining  supporting  documents;  and  preparing  and 
sending  the  list  of  approved  subloans  and  withdrawal  applications  to  AIFSA.  AIFSA  will  be 
responsible for checking and submitting the PFIs’ disbursement projections and PFIs’ withdrawal 
applications to ADB. In addition, AIFSA will be responsible for preparing disbursement projections 
related  to  project  management  expenses;  collecting  and  retaining  supporting  documents;  and 
preparing and sending withdrawal applications related to project management expenses to ADB. 
32. 
PFIs will disburse subloans based on the six-month disbursement projections approved 
by ADB. PFIs are required to submit the first three subloan applications to AIFSA for checking 
and forwarding for ADB’s review and approval. Before submitting a PFI’s withdrawal application 
to  ADB,  AIFSA  may  request  the  respective  PFI  to  provide  full  set  of  documents  for  subloans 
already  approved  by  the  respective  PFI.  Within  7  working  days  from  receipt  of  subloan 
documents, AIFSA will check to ensure that such approved subloans meet all eligibility criteria 
set forth in the PAM. In case a subloan does not meet all eligibility criteria, AIFSA will request the 
respective PFI to (i) remove such an ineligible subloan from its list of subloans, (ii) make refund 
to  the  imprest  account,  if  disbursement  is  made  from  the  imprest  account;  and  (iii)  adjust  the 
withdrawal application accordingly before AIFSA’s onward submission of the list of subloans and 
withdrawal application to ADB. AIFSA reserves the right to conduct the checking activities either 
for all approved subloans or a specific number of approved subloans on a sample basis. 
33. 
Imprest  fund  procedure.  ADB’s  imprest  fund  and  SOE  procedures  will  be  used  for 
disbursement under the ADB’s ADF loan.9 AIFSA and each PFI will open one US dollar imprest 
account at a commercial bank(s) acceptable to ADB to facilitate disbursements. AIFSA and each 
PFI will establish an imprest account in its name and shall be accountable and responsible for 
proper use of advances to the imprest account. The outstanding advance to the imprest account 
under  AIFSA’s  name  will  not  exceed  AIFSA’s  estimated  six-month  budget  required  for  project 
management expenses. The outstanding advance to the respective imprest account under each 
PFI’s name will not exceed each PFI’s estimated six-month budget required for payments to be 
made  to  eligible  subborrowers.  The  request  for  initial  and  additional  advances  to  the  imprest 
account should be accompanied by an Estimate of Expenditure Sheet detailing (i) the estimated 
expenditure for project management for the forthcoming six (6) months in the case of AIFSA, and 
(ii) the estimated subloans for the forthcoming six (6) months in the case of PFI. The ADB’s project 
division (CWER) responsible for project administration will review the reasonableness of the 6-
month estimates provided by AIFSA and each PFI. 
Statement  of  expenditure  procedure.10  The  SOE  procedure  will  be  used  for 
34. 
reimbursement  of  eligible  expenditures  or  liquidation  of  advances  to  the  imprest  account(s). 
AIFSA  and  PFIs  are  required  to  ensure  that  supporting  documents  and  records  for  the  ADB’s 
ADF  loan  amounts  claimed  under  the  SOE  procedure  are  maintained  and  made  available  for 
review  by  ADB's  disbursement  and  review  missions,  upon  ADB's  requests  for  submission  of 
supporting documents on a sampling basis, and for independent audit.

Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time).  
48. 
Procurement of subloan-financed goods and works will be undertaken by subborrowers 
based on commercial practices. PFIs will monitor the subloan utilization based on their existing 
regulations. Due diligence of PFIs indicated that PFIs’ loan monitoring procedures are adequate 
in ensuring that utilization of loan funds are for the purpose(s) agreed with PFIs.  
49. 
It  is  noted  that  potential  subborrowers  are  likely  to  utilize  subloan  proceeds  for 
procurement  of  materials,  processing  equipment,  machinery  and  other  goods,  works,  and 
consulting services from both ADB and non-ADB member countries, based on market nature of 
the  project  investments,  subborrowers’  demand,  and  procurement  history  in  projects  and 
programs  of  similar  nature.  ADB’s  Board  approval  pursuant  to  Article  14(ix)  of  the  Agreement

Monitoring and Reporting 
66. 
Project  performance  monitoring.  Each  PFI  will  be  required  to  include  in  its  quarterly 
progress reports information on its small businesses subloan portfolio: (i) name or type of loan 
product, (ii) borrower characteristics (male and female owned), (iii) loan tenor, (iv) interest rate, 
(v) repeat loan, new loan (vi) classification by size, (vii) sector of activity, (viii) region, (ix) number 
of employees (male and female), and (x) loans approved and disbursed. The reporting template 
will be provided to the AIFSA and PFIs prior to the inception mission. These reports will be ADB‘s 
basis for monitoring and updating project performance and measuring the development impact of 
the project.  
67. 
Compliance monitoring. Compliance of the PFIs to project agreement covenants will be 
monitored through periodic ADB review missions, quarterly progress reports by the PFIs, random 
spot  checks  of  subloan  documents,  and  review  of  the  PFIs'  audited  financial  statements.  An 
environmental  specialist  will  be  recruited  by  the  PMO  (based  in  AIFSA)  to  help  monitor  PFIs’ 
training,  provide  assistance  to  PFIs  for  ESMS  establishment  and  operations  including  the 
preparation of Annual Environmental and Social (ES) performance reports of the PFIs. 
68. 
Safeguards monitoring. Monitoring and reporting of the implementation of safeguards 
requirements and procedures within the established ESMS will be prepared by PFIs. The PFIs’ 
quarterly progress reports will include status of compliance with safeguards covenants. The PFIs 
will submit to AIFSA (the EA) annual ES performance reports (Appendix 8 of the ESMS in RRP’s 
linked document 12) by the end of January every year. Based on the PFIs’ annual reports, AIFSA 
will  submit  to  ADB  annual  Safeguard  Monitoring  reports  (Appendix  9  of  the  ESMS)  by  mid-

70. 
ADB will conduct semiannual and mid-term review missions to assess the progress of the 
project and review compliance with the loan agreement and project agreement covenants. The 
mid-term  review  mission  will  undertake  a  comprehensive  review  of  the  project  design  and  the 
performance  of  the  project.  It  may  require  a  change  in  the  design  and  implementation 
arrangements. Within 6 months after the loan closing date, MOF will submit a project completion 
report to ADB in a form acceptable to ADB.16

X. 
ANTICORRUPTION POLICY 
71. 
ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any violations of the 
Anticorruption  Policy  relating  to  the  project.17  All  contracts  financed  by  ADB  shall  include 
provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the 
executing agency and all project contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers. 
Individuals and/or entities on ADB’s anticorruption debarment list are ineligible to participate in 
ADB-financed  activity  and  may  not  be  awarded  any  contracts  under  the  project.18  To  support 
these efforts, relevant provisions will be included in the legal agreements.  
XI. 
ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISM 
People  who  are,  or may  in the  future  be,  adversely  affected  by the  project  may  submit 
72. 
complaints  to  ADB’s  Accountability  Mechanism.  The  Accountability  Mechanism  provides  an 
independent forum and process whereby people adversely affected by ADB-assisted projects can 
voice,  and  seek  a  resolution  of  their  problems,  as  well  as  report  alleged  violations  of  ADB’s 
operational  policies  and  procedures.  Before  submitting  a  complaint  to  the  Accountability 
Mechanism, affected people should make an effort in good faith to solve their problems by working 
with  the  concerned  ADB  operations  department.  Only  after  doing  that,  and  if  they  are  still 
dissatisfied, should they approach the Accountability Mechanism.19
