Project Administration Manual Purpose and Process 
The  project  administration  manual  (PAM)  describes  the  essential  administrative  and 
management requirements to implement the project on time, within budget, and in accordance 
with the policies and procedures of the government and the Asian Development Bank (ADB). 
The  PAM  should include  references to  all  available templates  and  instructions  either through 
linkages to relevant URLs or directly incorporated in the PAM. 
The National Project Management Office, located in the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs 
(formerly  the  State  Office  for  Comprehensive  Agricultural  Development)  as  project  executing 
agency;  the  Provincial  Project  Management  Offices  of  Chongqing,  Guizhou,  Hubei,  Hunan, 
Sichuan,  and  Yunnan  under  the  former  Provincial  Offices  for  Comprehensive  Agricultural 
Development  (POCAD),  as  the  implementing  agencies,  are  wholly  responsible  for  the 
implementation of the ADB-financed projects, as agreed jointly between the borrower and ADB, 
and in accordance with the policies and procedures of the government and ADB. The ADB staff 
is  responsible  for  supporting  implementation,  including  compliance  by  the  Central  Project 
Management Office and the six implementing agencies of their obligations and responsibilities 
for project implementation in accordance with ADB policies and procedures. 
At loan negotiations, the borrower and ADB shall agree to the PAM; and ensure consistency 
with the loan and project agreements. Such agreements shall be reflected in the minutes of the 
loan negotiations. In the event of any discrepancy or contradiction between the PAM and the 
loan and project agreements, the provisions of the loan and project agreements shall prevail. 
After  ADB  Board  approval  of  the  project’s  report  and  recommendations  of  the  President, 
changes in implementation arrangements are subject to agreement and approval pursuant to 
relevant government and ADB administrative procedures (including the Project Administration 
Instructions) and upon such approval, they will be subsequently incorporated in the PAM.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
A. 
Rationale  
The Yangtze River Green Ecological Corridor  Comprehensive Agriculture Development 
1. 
Project0F  will  be  implemented  in  five  provinces  and  one  municipality  in  the  upper  and  middle 
reaches of the Yangtze River Basin, notably the provinces of Guizhou, Hubei, Hunan, Sichuan,

modern farming  systems  to  enhance  productivity,  reduce  nonpoint  source  (NPS)  pollution and 
environmental  degradation,  and  strengthen  institutional  capacity  for  coordinated  natural 
resources management.  
The  Yangtze  River  Economic  Belt  (YREB)  covers  nine  provinces  and  two  specially 
2. 
administered cities within the Yangtze River Basin. It accounts for more than 40% of the entire 
PRC population, has 40% of the freshwater resources, serves as the drinking water resource for 
400 million people, provides 60% of total fisheries production, has 20% of the total wetland area, 
and already contributes about 45% of the PRC’s economic output. Based on its demographic and 
geographic assets, the PRC government has earmarked YREB as one of the three key growth 
engines  to  ensure  the  PRC’s  future  economic  development. 2  However,  development  and 
economic growth in the middle and upper reaches of the YREB are still undermined by (i) slow 
transformation  into  green  development  and  economic  diversification;  (ii)  limited  integration  of 
waterways,  ports,  and  intermodal  logistics;  (iii)  increasing  pollution  and  pressure  on  natural 
resources; and (iv) weak institutional coordination for strategic planning. 3F
3  
To  address  these  challenges,  the  Government  of  the  PRC  formulated  the  YREB 
3. 
4 which  stipulated  the  prioritization  of  ecological  protection  and 
development  plan  2016–2030,4F
5 In  this 
promotion  of  green  development  as  the  guiding  principle  for  the  YREB  development. 5F
connection,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  the  government  have  agreed  to  adopt  a 
framework approach, providing about $2.0 billion of funding in the YREB  during 2018–2020 to 
strategically program ADB’s lending support for development initiatives in the YREB with priority 
given to the following four areas: (i) ecosystem restoration, environmental protection, and water 
resources management; (ii) green and inclusive industrial transformation; (iii) construction of an 
integrated multimodal transport corridor; and (iv) institutional strengthening and policy reform.  
4. 
In  the  middle  and  upper  reaches  of  the  YREB,  the  traditional  modes  of  economic 
development  strongly  rely  on  the  rural  economy  and  primary  sector.  However,  unsustainable 
production practices continue to cause environmental degradation and limit the opportunities for 
improving rural livelihoods. This has severely impacted the water resources that the quality of the 
river  water  suffers  from  increasing  NPS  pollution  because  of  excessive  levels  of  nitrogen, 
6 
phosphorus,  and  pesticide  entering  water  bodies  through  agricultural  chemical  runoff. 6F
1  Selection criteria included: low and medium agricultural productivity; high risk and occurrence of soil erosion; high 
levels of agricultural nonpoint source pollution; lack of or outdated infrastructure; and the opportunity to implement 
integrated watershed management in counties with poverty alleviation priority. The selection criteria and process are 
summarized in Appendix 2.  
2  The other flagship projects are the Belt and Road Initiative and the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei Integration.

Agricultural  intensification  has  degraded  the  land  resources,  driven  by  changes  to  land  use, 
deforestation, diminished water availability and quality, soil erosion, and reduced soil quality from 
overuse of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. The loss of agricultural productivity as a result of

land  degradation  in  the  PRC  amounts  to  an  estimated  $37.09  billion  per  year. 7F
agriculture  is  highly  vulnerable  to  climate  change.  Coping  with  significant  variability  in  future 
climatic impacts requires efficient water resource management, increased capacity of agricultural 
support institutions and stakeholders, improvement of the support services to farmers, and more 
resilient production and ecosystems.

and  high  mountains  to  valley  bottoms  near  rivers—they  can  all  be  characterized  by  outdated 
agricultural production systems and practices, with inefficient use of land and water resources, 
high  rate  of  land  conversions,  prevalent  soil  erosion,  excessive  fertilizer  and  pesticide  use, 
outdated  or 
improper  waste 
management  and  disposal  practices,  and  lack  of  adequate  extension  services.  The  difficult 
terrain, poor land management practices, and limited opportunities to adopt modern and better 
practices have caused widespread environmental degradation, which is further exacerbated by a 
changing  climate  and  extreme  weather  conditions,  posing  significant  challenges  for  achieving 
sustainable agriculture and enhancing agricultural productivity and rural livelihoods.

resources,  such  as  construction  of  high-standard  farmland,  protection  and  improvement  of 
cultivated farmland,  provision  of  efficient,  water-saving  irrigation,  and  monitoring of  agricultural 
resources;  (ii)  agricultural  and  rural  environmental  control,  specifically  waste  management,

Currently,  provincial  agencies  have  limited  opportunity  to  cooperate  on  agricultural 
development and natural resource management, and to coordinate rural economic development 
across  the  YREB  because  of  (i)  fragmented  responsibilities  for  natural  resource  management 
across the various agencies, (ii) competing priorities and policies within and across sectors, and 
(iii) limited options and mechanisms for upstream–downstream coordination. A new approach is 
needed  to  achieve  integrated  management  and  green  development  that  can  balance  natural

20. 
The  Government  of  the  PRC  has  requested  a  regular  loan  of  $300  million  from  ADB’s 
ordinary capital resources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 25-year term, including 
a grace period of 5 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB’s London 
interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year; 
and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. Based on 
17 
the above loan terms and the borrower‘s choice of straight-line repayment method, the average 
loan maturity is 15.25 years, the loan maturity premium payable to ADB will be 0.1% per year. 
The government will make the loan proceeds available to the provincial governments, which in 
turn  will  make  the  loan  proceeds  available  to  the  county  governments  through  the  prefecture 
governments on a grant basis and with proper arrangements acceptable to ADB. 
21. 
The ADB loan will finance 59.2% of the total project costs, including expenditures relating 
to civil works, goods, consulting services, capacity development activities, and taxes and duties 
of $11.6 million for eligible ADB-financed expenditures. The national government will finance 3.7% 
of the total project costs, covering the financing charges during implementation. The provincial 
and local governments will  contribute 30.6% of the total project costs, including the balance in 
civil  works,  and  training  and  capacity  development;  research  and  monitoring;  environmental 
management  and  monitoring;  surveys,  design,  and  supervision;  taxes  and  duties;  and  the 
contingencies.  The  beneficiaries  will  contribute  6.5%  through  in-kind  contributions  to  tend 
ecological trees (labor and input costs for fertilizer, pesticides, and required equipment) over the 
3-year  establishment  phase  and  provide  labor  for  small  canal  dredging  works.  The  in-kind 
contribution  will  be  recorded  at  village  level  and  monitored  by  the  CPMOs.  The  interest  and 
commitment charges to be incurred during implementation will not be capitalized in the loan. 
A. 
Cost Estimates Preparation and Revisions  
22. 
Preparation.  The  cost  estimates  were  prepared  jointly  by  the  design  institutes,  the 
Provincial  Offices  for  Comprehensive  Agricultural  Development  (POCADs),  the  City  and/or 
County  Offices  for  Comprehensive  Agricultural  Development  (COCADs),  and  ADB  with 
assistance  from  the  technical  assistance  (TA)  consultants.  The  sources  and  basis  for  cost 
estimates were reviewed during project preparation and had been confirmed by related parties. 
The process was facilitated by a model in excel software which enabled easy updating or revision, 
if necessary. The model is maintained by both the PPMOs and ADB. 
23. 
Revisions. Revision of cost estimates will be conducted when deemed necessary during 
implementation. The PPMOs will be responsible in proposing and drafting the revision which will 
be subject to ADB’s approval.

FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT 
A. 
Financial Management Assessment 
The  financial  management  assessment  (FMA)  was  conducted  in  September  2017  in 
25. 
accordance with ADB’s Guidelines for the Financial Management and Analysis of  Projects and 
the  Financial  Due  Diligence:  A  Methodology  Note.26 The  FMA  considered  the  capacity  of  the 
NPMO,  formerly  known  as  SOCAD,  the  PPMOs  (then  POCADs),  and  the  CPMOs  (then 
COCADs), including fund flow arrangements, staffing, accounting and financial reporting systems, 
financial information systems, and internal and external auditing arrangements.  
26. 
Based on the assessment, before considering mitigation measures, the overall financial 
management risk of NPMO, the six POCADs, and the COCADs is moderate. The FMA identified 
the main financial management risks as (i) moderate inherent risk (moderate country-specific risks 
and entity-specific risks); (ii) low control risk (moderate risks for implementing agencies, and low 
risks for fund flow, staffing, accounting and reporting, internal audit, external audit, reporting and 
monitoring, and information systems); and (iii) comparatively high level of financial management 
capacities (high capacities for financial accounting, entry treasury, statutory reporting, budgeting, 
and  project  budgeting  and  costing;  and  medium  capacities  for  management  accounting  and 
reporting, financial modeling and project evaluation techniques, and internal control and audit). 
The  NPMO,  the  PPMOs,  and  the  CPMOs  have  agreed  to  implement  an  action  plan  as  key 
measures to address the deficiencies. The financial management action plan is provided in Table

28. 
The  PPMOs  will  prepare  withdrawal  applications  and  submit  them  to  NPMO  for 
verification,  and  thereafter  the  PPMOs  will  submit  them  to  ADB  for  approval.  The  NPMO  will 
prepare withdrawal applications and submit them to ADB for approval. At the end of each year, 
the NPMO will prepare realistic projections of contract awards and disbursements for the following 
year and submit them to ADB.  
29. 
The  NPMO,  the  PPMOs,  and  the  CPMOs  will  be  responsible  for  (i)  preparing 
disbursement  projections,  (ii)  requesting  budgetary  allocations  for  counterpart  funds,  (iii) 
collecting  supporting  documents,  and  (iv)  preparing  withdrawal  applications.  The  NPMO  will 
consolidate and send the withdrawal applications to ADB. 
30. 
Advance  fund  procedure.  The  NPMO  and  PPMOs  will  establish  each  an  advance 
account (seven advance accounts in total) promptly after loan effectiveness at a commercial bank 
satisfactory  to  ADB.  The  currency  of  the  advance  accounts  is  the  United  States  dollar.  The 
advance accounts are to be used exclusively for ADB’s share of eligible expenditures. The NPMO 
and PPMOs, who administer the advance accounts are accountable and responsible for proper 
use of advances to the advance accounts. 
The  loan  proceeds  will  be  released  from  the  PPMOs’  advance  accounts  based  on  the 
31. 
claims made by the CPMOs.  
The total outstanding advance to each advance account should not exceed the estimate 
32. 
of  ADB’s  share of  expenditures to  be  paid through  the  advance  account for  the forthcoming  6 
months. The NPMO and PPMOs may request for initial and additional advances to its advance 
accounts based on an Estimate of Expenditure Sheet setting out the estimated expenditures to

be financed through the account for the forthcoming 6 months. 27F
be submitted to ADB or retained by the NPMO, the PPMOs, or the CPMOs in accordance with 
ADB’s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time), and other detailed 
arrangements  agreed  by  ADB  and  the  government  (footnote  27).28  The  Loan  Disbursement 
Handbook describes which supporting documents should be submitted to ADB and which should 
be retained by the government for liquidation and replenishment of the advance accounts. 
Statement of expenditure procedure.29F
30 The statement of expenditure (SOE) procedure 
33. 
may be used for reimbursement of eligible expenditures or liquidation of advances to the advance 
accounts. Supporting documents and records for the expenditures claimed under the SOE should 
be maintained and made readily available for review by ADB’s disbursement and review missions, 
upon  ADB’s  request  for  submission  of  supporting  documents  on  a  sampling  basis,  and  for 
independent audit.  The borrower is required to retain all records (e.g., contracts, purchase orders, 
invoices, bills, receipts, subloan agreements) evidencing eligible expenditures to enable ADB’s 
representative  to  examine  such  records.  Such  records  should  be  retained  for  at  least  1  year 
following receipt by ADB of the final APFS or 2 years after the loan closing date, whichever is 
later.  
28 Disbursement eLearning. http://wpqr4.adb.org/disbursement_elearning  
29 The estimate of expenditure sheet is available in Appendix 8A of ADB’s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as 
amended from time to time),  
30 The SOE forms are available in Appendixes 7B and 7D of ADB’s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended 
from time to time). 
27 
Reimbursement. The reimbursement procedure is a disbursement procedure where ADB 
34. 
pays from the loan account to the borrower’s account for the eligible expenditure which have been 
incurred and paid for by the borrower out of its budget allocation or its own resources. Use of the 
procedure is encouraged for all eligible expenditures when the borrower has sufficient resources. 
Under this procedure, ADB’s payment are made only to the borrower.  
35. 
Before  the  submission  of  the  first  withdrawal  application,  the  central  government  and 
provincial governments should submit to ADB sufficient evidence of the authority of the person(s) 
who  will  sign  the  withdrawal  applications  on  behalf  of  the  government,  together  with  the 
authenticated specimen signatures of each authorized person. The minimum value per withdrawal 
application is stipulated in ADB’s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to 
time). Individual payments below such amount should be paid (i) by the PPMOs or the CPMOs, 
and  subsequently  claimed  to  ADB  through  reimbursement;  or  (ii)  through  the  advance  fund 
procedure, unless otherwise accepted by ADB. The NPMO and PPMOs should ensure sufficient 
category and contract balances before requesting disbursements. Use of ADB’s Client Portal for 
Disbursements system is encouraged for submission of withdrawal applications to ADB." 30F

2. 
Disbursement Arrangements for Counterpart Fund 
36. 
Counterpart funds will come from national, provincial, and local governments. The national 
government  will  provide  $18.6  million,  or  3.7%  of  the  total  project  cost,  to  cover  the  financing 
charges during implementation. Provincial and local governments will contribute $155.0 million, 
or 30.6% of the total project cost, to finance civil works; materials such as organic fertilizer and 
bio pesticide; environmental management and monitoring; social safeguards monitoring; surveys, 
design, and supervision; taxes and duties for civil works and research; and part of contingencies. 
The beneficiaries will provide in-kind contributions amounting to $33.1 million equivalent, or 6.5% 
of  the  total  project  cost,  for  soil  improvement  and  small  canal  dredging,  and  contingencies. 
Counterpart funds will be disbursed and liquidated following the current NPMO (formerly SOCAD) 
financial management manual for domestically financed comprehensive agricultural development 
projects.  
C. 
Accounting 
37. 
The  NPMO,  each  PPMO,  and  each  CPMO  will  maintain,  or  cause  to  be  maintained, 
separate  books  and  records  by  funding  source  for  all  expenditures  incurred  on  the  project 
following  Accounting  Methods  for  Projects  Financed  by  the  World  Bank  (reference  No.  2000 
32 Each CPMO will prepare annual financial statements for submission to the NPMO through 
[13]).31F
each PPMO after its consolidation. The NPMO will consolidate all annual project accounts and 
financial  statements  for  the  project  in  accordance  with  the  government’s  accounting  laws  and 
regulations which are consistent with international accounting principles and practices. 
D. 
Auditing and Public Disclosure 
38. 
The NPMO and each PPMO will cause the detailed central and provincial project financial 
statements  to  be  audited  in  accordance  with  the  International  Standards  on  Auditing  and  the 
PRC’s auditing standards by an auditor acceptable to ADB. The audited central and provincial 
31 The Client Portal for Disbursement system facilitates online submission of withdrawal applications to ADB, resulting 
in  faster  disbursement.  The  forms  to  be  completed  by  the  borrower  are  available  online  at  https://www.adb.org/ 
documents/client-portal-disbursements-guide.     
32 Accounting regulations issued by the Ministry of Finance for all foreign aid-funded projects. 
28 
project financial statements together with the auditor’s opinion will be presented in the English 
language to ADB within 6 months from the end of the fiscal year by the NPMO. 
39. 
The audit report for the project financial statements will include a management letter and 
auditor’s opinions, which cover whether the (i) project financial statements present an accurate 
and fair view or are presented fairly, in all material respects, in accordance with the applicable 
financial  reporting  standards;  (ii)  proceeds  of  the  loan  were  used  only  for  the  purposes  of  the 
project;  and (iii)  borrower  or  executing  agency  was in compliance  with  the financial  covenants 
contained in the legal agreements. 
40. 
Compliance with financial reporting and auditing requirements will be monitored by review 
missions and during normal program supervision; and followed up regularly with all concerned, 
including the external auditor.  
41. 
The  government,  the  NPMO,  the  PPMOs,  and  the  CPMOs  have  been  made  aware  of 
ADB’s  approach  to  delayed  submission;  and  the  requirements  for  satisfactory  and  acceptable

VI.  
PROCUREMENT AND CONSULTING SERVICES  
A. 
Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing 
43. 
Advance  contracting  will  apply  to  the  urgent  procurement  of  civil  works  and  goods.  All 
advance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  will  be  undertaken  in  conformity  with  ADB’s 
33 ADB’s approach and procedures regarding delayed submission of audited project financial statements:  
(i)  When audited project financial statements are not received by the due date, ADB will write to the executing 
agency advising that (a) the audit documents are overdue; and (b) if they are not received within the next 6 
months, requests for new contract awards and disbursement such as new replenishment of advance accounts, 
processing of new reimbursement, and issuance of new commitment letters will not be processed. 
(ii)  When  audited  project  financial  statements  are  not  received  within  6  months  after  the  due  date,  ADB  will 
withhold processing of requests for new contract awards and disbursement such as new replenishment of 
advance accounts, processing of new reimbursement, and issuance of new commitment letters. ADB will (a) 
inform the executing agency of ADB’s actions; and (b) advise that the loan may be suspended if the audit 
documents are not received within the next 6 months. 
(iii)  When audited project financial statements  are not received within 12 months after the due date, ADB may 
suspend the loan.

Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time) and will require ADB’s prior review 
and approval of each step.35F
36  
44. 
Retroactive financing. Retroactive financing will apply to the urgent procurement of civil 
works and goods. Retroactive financing will be subject to a maximum amount equivalent to 20% 
of the loan amount for eligible expenditures incurred prior to loan effectiveness, but not earlier 
than 12 months before the loan agreement is signed. 
B. 
Procurement of Goods, Works, and Consulting Services 
All procurement of the ADB-financed works and goods will be undertaken in accordance 
45. 
with ADB’s Procurement Guidelines. 
46. 
Before  the  start  of  any  procurement,  ADB  and  the  government  will  review  the  public 
procurement  laws  of  the  central  and  state  governments  to  ensure  consistency  with  ADB’s 
Procurement Guidelines.  
47. 
A  procurement  plan  indicating  threshold  and  review  procedures;  works,  goods,  and 
consulting service contract packages; and national competitive bidding guidelines are in Section 
C. 
1.  
International and National Competitive Biddings  
48. 
The  international  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  will  be  used  for  contracts  estimated  to  cost 
$40 million equivalent or above for civil works, and $3 million equivalent or above for goods. The 
latest ADB-standard ICB document which can be downloaded from the ADB website will be used 
for the ICB. The national competitive bidding (NCB) will be used for contracts estimated to cost 
over $100,000 equivalent and less than $40 million equivalent for civil works, and over $100,000 
equivalent and less than $3 million equivalent for goods. For procurement under  the NCB, the 
following provisions will be applied: (i) the advertisement will be limited to the national press, an 
official gazette, or an open access website; (ii) standard bidding documents issued by the Ministry 
of  Finance  will  be  used;  and  (iii)  bidding  documents  will  only  be  in  the  Chinese  (except  for 
contracts  which  require  ADB’s  prior  review  and  approval),  and  the  currency  for  bidding  and 
payment will be in Chinese yuan. Unless otherwise agreed between the NPMO, the PPMOs, and 
ADB; and set forth in the procurement plan. Procurements under the ICB and the NCB will use 
the single-stage, one-envelope procedure.  
2.  
Shopping 
Shopping  will  be  used  for  the  ADB-financed  contracts  estimated  to  cost  $100,000 
49. 
equivalent or below.  
3. 
Community Participation 
50.  Where,  in  the  interest  of  project  sustainability  or  to  achieve  certain  specific  social 
objectives  of  the  project,  it  is  desirable  under  selected  project  components  to  call  for  the 
participation of local communities and/or nongovernment organizations in the delivery of services, 
community participation may be used as a method of procurement for small civil works packages. 
Currently,  there  are  no  packages  to  be  procured  through  community  participation  in  the 
36 Available at: https://www.adb.org/documents/adb-procurement-policy 
30 
procurement plan, but this method is included to provide flexibility in the event that the need for 
community participation arises.     
4. 
Consulting Services 
51. 
All ADB-financed individual consultants, consulting firms, and monitoring agencies will be 
recruited according to ADB’s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants by  the Asian Development 
37 The indicative terms of reference 
Bank and Its Borrowers (2013, as amended from time to time). 36F
for the loan implementation consultants are in Appendix 1. 
5. 
Thresholds for the ADB Review 
For (i) all ADB-financed ICB and NCB contracts for advance contracting, (ii) the first ADB-
52. 
financed ICB and NCB contracts for civil works and goods for each of the Chongqing Municipality; 
and the provinces of  Guizhou, Hubei, Hunan, Sichuan, and Yunnan; and (iii) all the other ADB-
financed contracts for works and goods estimated to cost $10 million equivalent or above, ADB’s 
prior review and approval of the following documents (if applicable) will be required: invitation for 
bids,  bidding  documents,  bid  evaluation  report,  draft  negotiated  contract,  signed  contract,  and 
contract variations.  
The other ADB-financed contracts for civil works and goods will be subject to post review; 
53. 
and  for  each  contract,  (i)  ADB’s  approval  of  the  invitation  for  bids  and  bidding  document  (if 
applicable) will not be necessary as long as the relevant first bidding document approved by ADB 
is used as a model without substantial modification; (ii) procurement process can be conducted 
without  ADB’s  prior  approval;  and  (iii)  after  the  contract  is  signed,  the  bid  evaluation  report  (if 
applicable) and signed contract needs to be submitted to ADB for post-facto review and approval.  
For all consultant recruitments (including the recruitments of monitoring agencies), ADB’s 
54. 
prior review and approval of each step will be required.

VII.   SAFEGUARDS 
76. 
Prohibited investment activities. Pursuant to ADB’s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), 
the ADB funds may not be applied to the activities described on the ADB Prohibited Investment 
Activities List set forth at Appendix 5 of the Safeguard Policy Statement (2009).  
A. 
Environment  
The project was classified by ADB as category B, and an initial environmental examination 
77. 
(IEE)  report  and  an  environmental  management  plan  (EMP)  are  requirements  under  ADB’s 
38  During  the  mission,  working  meetings  were  held  with 
Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009). 37F
SOCAD,  the  POCADs,  the  TA  consultants,  and  the  design  institutes  to  discuss  and  address 
remaining safeguard issues for preparation of the project IEE and EMP. 
78. 
Project benefits. The environmental assessment confirmed that the project will generate 
multiple  environmental  benefits.  The  project  is  expected  to  generate  multiple  significant 
environmental benefits. The major anticipated environmental benefits include (i) decreasing the 
chemical fertilizer and pesticide application rate and total quantity, and contribution to the control 
of  NPS  pollution  in  the  project  region;  (ii)  reduced  soil  erosion  and  improved  soil  quality;  (iii) 
recycling  of  agricultural  waste  and  its  reuse  as  fertilizer  resources,  and  promotion  of  green 
agricultural  development;  (iv)  improving  of  water  use  efficiency;  and  (v)  increased  climate 
resilience. They will contribute to the improvement of the Yangtze River ecological environmental 
quality, the development of sustainable agriculture, and income generation for farmers. 
No  significant  adverse  impacts  were  identified.  The  potential  risks  that  have  been 
79. 
assessed  in  detail  include  (i)  use  of  additional  water  resources;  (ii)  erosion  from  construction 
activities; (iii) irrigation water quality; (iv) impact of irrigation tail water on ambient water quality; 
(v) lake eutrophication; (vi) water impoundments; (vii) pollution prevention and public health; (viii) 
protected areas and protected species; and (ix) physical and cultural resources. Construction and 
rehabilitation works are small and relatively simple. Some counties may increase overall water 
usage, which are all located in areas where water resources are more abundant. Potential erosion 
risks can be mitigated adequately. The impacts on water quality or eutrophication are considered 
negligible, as the usage of agrochemicals per hectare will be reduced. No project activities will be 
carried out in environmentally sensitive areas. No physical, historical, and cultural relic sites or 
natural reserves have been discovered in the project area. 
Environmental  management  plan.  The  EMP  include  a  detailed  description  of  the 
80. 
potential  environmental  impacts  and  mitigation  measures,  environmental  monitoring  program, 
public  consultation  program,  reporting  and  supervision,  feedback  and  adjustment  mechanism, 
and institutional responsibilities. The project will not generate significant adverse environmental 
impacts,  provided  the  mitigation  measures  and  monitoring  arrangements  in  the  EMP  are 
appropriately implemented. 
81. 
Environmental  management  plan  implementation  responsibilities.  The  NPMO  will 
have the overall accountability for the overall project for ensuring compliance with the PRC’s laws 
and  regulations  as  well  as  the  provisions  of  ADB’s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  Six 
PPMOs will be responsible for ensuring the implementation of the specific mitigation measures in 
cooperation with the CPMOs as prescribed in the EMP. Internal monitoring and inspection will be 
38 ADB’s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) is available both in English and Chinese language. http://www.adb.org/ 
Documents/Policies/Safeguards/Safeguard-Policy-Statement-June2009.pdf  and  http://www.adb.org/Documents/ 
Translations/Chinese/Safeguard-Policy-Statement-cn.pdf )  
68 
conducted by the environmental monitoring agencies to be contracted by each PPMO. They will 
be  responsible  to  undertake  regular  environmental  monitoring  and  inspection  activities  before, 
during, and after construction as well as in the event of emergencies as indicated in the EMP. 
Training.  Environmental  officers  in  the  PPMOs  and  the  CPMOs  will  receive  training  in 
82. 
environmental  management,  environmental  monitoring  and  supervision,  mitigation  planning, 
emergency  response,  environmental  policy-making,  and  other  environmental  management 
techniques. The PPMOs will ensure that the training plan defined in the EMP is implemented. The 
loan implementation environmental specialist will facilitate the training. The scope of training will 
also include the efficient and effective environmental monitoring during project operation. 
83. 
Environmental  management  plan  costs.  Cost  estimates  for  mitigation  measures, 
environmental  monitoring,  and  training  in  the  EMP  procedures  are  estimated  in  the  EMP. The 
PPMOs will bear the internal monitoring costs as part of their implementation functions, and the 
cost of environmental monitoring by the environmental monitoring agency which will be recruited 
by  each  PPMO.  During  project  implementation,  the  budgets  will  be  adjusted  based  on  actual 
requirements. The costs for all mitigation measures to be undertaken by the contractors during 
construction will be included in the contract documents.  
B. 
Involuntary Resettlement 
84. 
The project was classified by ADB as category C on involuntary resettlement according to 
ADB’s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). The project will not involve involuntary land acquisition 
and resettlement impacts. Of an estimated total of 1,400,622 mu of land area under the project, 
1,348,905  mu  belongs  to  beneficiary  farmers’  own  land  where  agricultural  activities  will  be 
undertaken;  and  it  does  not  require  any  land  use  rights  transfer  (LURT).  The  construction  of 
farming facilities, such as irrigation network or farm access roads, will be located on existing rights 
of  way;  or  on  the  beneficiary  villages’  unutilized  land  areas.  The  beneficiary  villages  have 
confirmed  to  provide  5,379  mu  of  land  for  such  facilities.  The  plantation  activities  will  be 
undertaken in the leased land, obtaining land use rights; and 45,938 mu of mostly unutilized slope 
land has been leased by cooperatives. In addition, 400 mu of existing state-owned land will be 
used for bridge and embankment upgrading. 
85. 
The  due  diligence  review  has  been  conducted  for  the  LURT  contracts  or  agreements 
ensure that these are voluntary, transparent, fair, and beneficial to farmers. In addition, a LURT 
framework has been prepared providing guidance for future contracts that may be needed during 
project  implementation.  Consultations  have  been  undertaken  with  local  people,  village 
committees, and farmer cooperatives during project preparation; and they will be further consulted 
during  project  implementation.  The  project-specific  grievance  redress  mechanism  (GRM)  has 
been established and incorporated into the LURT framework. The project will engage an external 
social monitoring agency to verify and monitor the LURT agreements and submit the semiannual 
social monitoring reports to ADB during project implementation. 
C. 
Indigenous Peoples 
86. 
The  project  was  classified  by ADB  as  category  B  on  indigenous  peoples  according  to 
ADB’s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  The  Guizhou  Province’s  project  area  has  44.19% 
ethnic minority beneficiaries and 27 ethnic minority villages; and the Yunnan Province’s project 
69 
area has 4.60% ethnic minority beneficiaries and 4 ethnic minority villages.39 The ethnic minority 
communities  are  expected  to  benefit  from  the  project  without  significant  adverse  impacts. An 
ethnic minority development plan (EMDP) has been prepared for the project in consultation with 
local  stakeholders,  including  the  ethnic  minorities  in  accordance  with ADB’s  Safeguard  Policy 
Statement (2009). The EMDP includes adequate measures to ensure that ethnic minorities can 
participate  and  benefit  from  project  activities,  and  adverse  impacts  to  them  are  avoided  or 
mitigated. The EMDP has been disclosed publicly and posted on the ADB website.40  
D. 
Grievance Redress Mechanism  
87. 
A  GRM  has  been  developed  in  compliance  with  the  requirements  in ADB’s  Safeguard 
Policy Statement (2009) to address environmental, health, safety, and social concerns associated 
with construction, operation, and land transfer arrangements under the project. The details of the 
GRM, including a time-bound flow chart of procedures, are included in the EMP and the LURT 
framework. The complaint channels are slightly different for environmental and social issues, but 
the each PPMO will maintain an integrated system to document, follow-up, and report on all cases 
to the NPMO and ADB. 
E. 
Capacity for Implementation and Monitoring of Social and Safeguard Measures  
The NPMO will coordinate the implementation and monitoring of the overall project. The 
88. 
PPMOs  and  the  CPMOs  will  be  responsible  for  day-to-day  implementation  and  periodic 
monitoring of the project’s social and safeguard measures in relevant provinces and counties. In 
coordination  with  the  PPMOs  and  the  CPMOs,  the  NPMO  has  endorsed  and  committed  to 
implement the project’s social and safeguard plans (EMDP, LURT framework, etc.). The NPMO 
has experience in the implementation of the ADB project, but most PPMOs and the CPMOs do 
not have such experience. To implement social and safeguard measures properly, (i) the NPMO, 
the  PPMOs,  and  the  CPMOs  will  each  appoint  focal  staff;  (ii)  focal  staff  will  be  provided  with 
training in relevant measures; (iii) loan consultants will be recruited to assist in the implementation 
and internal monitoring of social and safeguards measures; and (iii) an independent monitoring 
agency (or experts) will be recruited for external monitoring. 
39 Project areas in other project provinces may either not have or have only a very small percentage of scattered ethnic 
minority population as follows: Sichuan (0.250%), Hubei (0.301%), Hunan (0.017%) and Chongqing (0.000%). 
40 The EMDP  was posted on ADB website before ADB’s Management Review  Meeting. While some changes were 
made in the name of the central project management office after the web posting of the EMDP, this is not expected 
to involve any changes to the project impact and to the implementation of the EMDP. The relevant implementing 
agencies will implement the EMDP as approved by ADB.

VIII.   GENDER AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS  
89. 
Gender.  The  project  has  been  classified  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming  category, 
following ADB’s  Guidelines  for  Gender  Mainstreaming  Categories  of  the ADB  Projects  (2012). 
Women are key stakeholders and their participation will be crucial to the success of the project. 
Women are burdened with both agricultural and household work, and most of them are engaged 
in  labor-intensive  farming  with  low  income.  They  have  lower  education  and  knowledge  of 
agricultural technology, low employment opportunities, and much lower representation in decision 
making on political and external affairs. 
90. 
The project is intended to be particularly beneficial to women, who will also have important 
roles in sustainable farming activities because of higher out-migration of males to urban areas. 
Women will significantly benefit from the project. Improved high quality farmland and sustainable 
and  modern  farming  practices  will  provide  opportunities  for  women  to  participate  in  profitable 
economic activities. It will result in increased incomes and capacity strengthened. Environmental 
management and trainings will increase their awareness and improve their living environment and 
quality of life. During the survey, women groups expressed their strong support to the project; and 
expect that it will create local employment and income opportunities. 
91. 
A  gender  action  plan  (GAP)  has  been  developed  to  ensure  women’s  engagement  and 
development. It includes the following key measures: (i) 30% of jobs in project construction and 
operation intended for women; and 40% of jobs in farmer cooperatives’ related works intended 
for  women;  (ii)  40%  participation  by  women  in  consultation,  decision  making,  and  awareness 
education; (iii) 40% participation by women in training and capacity-building activities for farmers; 
and (iv) 30% representation by women in training to the CPMOs and/or the PPMOs. The design 
and monitoring framework (DMF) includes key gender targets and indicators. 
92. 
Poverty and social. The project is in counties designated as either national or provincial 
poverty counties or less-developed counties eligible for the central government’s support for the 
middle and western provinces in the PRC. They have low levels of industrialization and economic 
growth, which is largely reliant on agricultural and traditional services. Of the 47 project counties, 
31 are national and/or provincial poverty counties. The poverty ratio in the direct project areas is 
much higher in Yunnan (21%) and Guizhou (15%), followed by Sichuan (6%), Hunan (5%), Hubei 
(3%), and Chongqing (4%). The major causes of poverty are (i) lack of high-quality farmland; (ii) 
poor agricultural facilitates and limited farm products; (iii) lack of income-generating opportunities; 
and (iv) lack of human and social capital.  
93. 
The  project’s  poverty  reduction  impacts  and  socioeconomic  benefits  will  be  significant. 
Many  farmers  will  engage  in  developing  high-quality  farmland,  implementing  sustainable  and 
modern  farming  practices,  waste  and  environmental  management,  voluntary  land  leasing, 
employment opportunities, and human capacity building. The poor and rural farmers will directly 
benefit from the project, particularly on employment opportunities. It is estimated that a total of 
1.787  million  residents  in  the  project  areas  will  benefit  from  the  project,  including  284,881  in 
Yunnan, 178,895 in Sichuan, 145,541 in Guizhou, 155,028 in Hubei, and 856,785 in Hunan, and 
165,882  in  Chongqing.  Significant  portions  of  the  beneficiaries  include  the  poor  (7.96%)  and 
ethnic minorities (4.39%). In addition, the project will  provide 25,078 full-time and 45,883 part-
time  employment  opportunities  for  local  residents,  including  the  poor,  ethnic  minorities,  and 
women. 
94. 
Developing  sustainable  modern  farming  system  and  rural  waste  and  environmental 
management  will  result  in  increased  income  and  improved  living  standards  among  the  project 
71 
beneficiaries,  including  the  poor,  women,  and  ethnic  minorities.  The  project  will  invest  on 
agriculture  facilities  and  equipment  to  create  opportunities  for  new  modern  farming  practices. 
Farmers will be able to grow high-value crops (vegetables, fruits, oil teas, herb medicines) after 
project construction and skill training. Local residents will also earn income from employment and 
other income-generating opportunities during project construction. 
95. 
Through  the  improved  long-term  agricultural  productivity  as  well  as  environmental 
protection and rehabilitation, the 47 counties can attract more investment and businesses, and 
generate  additional  employment  and  income-generating  opportunities  for  the  poor  and  local 
residents. 
A social development action plan (SDAP) has been developed to ensure farmer’s rights, 
96. 
interests, and participation while maximizing project benefits to them.

B. 
Monitoring  
97. 
Project performance monitoring. To monitor the progress of the project in achieving the 
planned outcome and outputs, the NPMO will coordinate with the PPMOs and the CPMOs for the 
establishment  and  maintenance  of  the  project  performance  management  system  (PPMS)—
equivalent to the management information system (MIS)—which will permit adequate flexibility to 
41 
adopt remedial action regarding project design, schedules, activities, and development impacts. 39F
In addition, risk management for the project shall be incorporated in the PPMS. The monitoring 
will  cover  all  indicators  listed  in  the  DMF  as  well  as  the  indicators  reflecting  the  development 
results  contributed  by  the  project.  The  PPMS  will  cover  the  following  aspects  of  the  project 
implementation: (i) project physical and financial progress; (ii) progress and results of capacity 
development;  (iii)  implementation  of  the  EMP;  (iv)  implementation  of  the  EMDP,  GAP,  LURT 
framework,  and  SDAP;  and  (v)  compliance  with  loan  covenants  (policy,  financial,  economic, 
sector, and others).  
98. 
The NPMO (formerly SOCAD) agreed and confirmed that they will (i) establish the PPMS 
before the loan effectiveness; (ii) recruit the  loan implementation consultants (LICs) before the 
loan effectiveness, including but not only limited to, one Social Specialist for 10 person-months, 
one  LURT  Specialist  for  10  person-months,  and  one  Environment  Specialist  for  10  person-
months, to facilitate the project start-up and provide consulting service as described in Appendix 
1; (iii) confirm that targets are achievable; and (iv) develop recording, monitoring, and reporting 
arrangements. 
99. 
At  the  beginning  of  project  implementation,  the  NPMO  will  finalize  the  comprehensive 
PPMS  procedures  to  systematically  generate  data  in  the  above  areas  in  consultation  with  the 
implementing agencies. The NPMO will refine the PPMS framework, confirm achievable targets 
and the monitoring and recording arrangements, and establish relevant systems and procedures 
not  later than 6  months after  project  implementation  begins. The  NPMO,  the  PPMOs,  and the 
CPMOs will assign staff or consultants to collect baseline and progress data at the requisite time 
intervals, including semiannual progress report on the implementation of the EMDP, EMP, GAP, 
LURT  framework,  and  SDAP.  The  NPMO  will  be  responsible  for  analyzing  and  consolidating 
reported  data  through  its  MIS,  and  reporting  outcomes  to ADB  through  semiannual  progress 
reports.  
100.  A project progress report, monitoring the project inputs and activities, should be submitted 
to ADB  semiannually  starting  from  project  inception.  These  semiannual  progress  reports  and 
project  monitoring  and  evaluation  reports  will  provide  information  necessary  to  update ADB‘s 
PPMS. 
101.  Promptly after physical completion of the project, but in any event not later than 6 months 
thereafter  or  such  later  date  as ADB  may  agree  for  this  purpose,  the  NPMO  will  prepare  and 
submit to ADB a project completion report, in such form and in such detail as ADB shall reasonably 
request,  on  the  implementation  and  evaluation  of  the  project,  including  project  description, 
evaluation of design and implementation, evaluation of performance, and overall assessment and 
recommendations. 
102.  Compliance monitoring. During project implementation, ADB and the NPMO will closely 
monitor the compliance of all the covenants under the project; and will take necessary remedy 
41 ADB‘s project performance reporting system is available at:  
  http://www.adb.org/Documents/Slideshows/ PPMS/default.asp?p=evaltool 
84 
actions for any noncompliance. The compliance status will be reported in the semiannual progress 
report by the NPMO and will be reviewed during project review missions. 
103.  Environmental safeguard monitoring. An environmental monitoring program has been 
prepared describing the scope of monitoring, environmental media, monitoring parameters, the 
time  and  frequency  of  monitoring,  and  implementing  and  supervising  agencies.  During 
construction,  the  PPMOs  and  the  CPMOs  will  conduct  internal  environmental  monitoring  and 
inspections  to  ensure  that  environmental  mitigation  measures  are  properly  implemented. 
Inspections  will  mainly  cover  construction  activities,  but  these  will  also  review  the  affected 
environment.  During  operation,  the  implementing  agencies  will  be  responsible  for  internal 
monitoring  and  reporting  to  the  NPMO.  Environmental  monitoring  and  inspection  will  be 
conducted  by  local  environmental  monitoring  stations  under  the  local  environmental  protection 
bureaus. They will be responsible to undertake regular and random environmental monitoring and 
inspection activities before, during, and after construction as well as in the event of emergencies.  
104.  Environmental  monitoring  results,  including  environmental  benefits  monitoring,  will  be 
used to evaluate (i) the extent and severity of environmental impacts compared with the predicted 
impacts, (ii) performance of the environmental protection measures or compliance with related 
rules  and  regulations,  (iii)  impact  trends,  and  (iv)  the  overall  effectiveness  of  the  EMP.  The 
effectiveness  of  the  mitigation  measures  and  monitoring  plans  will  be  evaluated  through  a 
feedback reporting system. 
105.  Resettlement.  The  project  will  not  involve  any  involuntary  land  acquisition  and 
resettlement impacts. 
106. 
Internal  and  external  monitoring  of  the  EMDP,  GAP,  LURT  framework,  and  SDAP 
implementation will be conducted; and the methodologies or targets are specified in the relevant 
action plan, and some indicators are also included in the DMF. The NPMO, the PPMOs, and the 
CPMOs  will  appoint  staff for  implementation  and internal monitoring  of  the EMDP,  GAP,  LURT 
framework, and SDAP. A national Social Specialist with 10 person-months input and a national 
LURT  Specialist  with  10  person-months  input  are  included  under  the  project  implementation 
consultants.  The  consultants  will  assist  the  PPMOs  and  the  CPMOs  in  setting  up  effective 
monitoring systems  by working  with the  social officers to ensure  implementation  of the  EMDP, 
GAP,  LURT  framework,  and  SDAP.  In  addition,  an  external  social  monitoring  agency  will  be 
engaged  by  each  PPMO  for  the  EMDP,  GAP,  LURT  framework,  and  SDAP  monitoring  and 
evaluation;  and  the  monitoring  results  will  be  submitted  to  the  NPMO  semiannually  for 
consolidation, and then submit the consolidated semiannual monitoring report to ADB.  
C. 
Evaluation  
In addition to regular monitoring, project progress and performance will be monitored at 
107. 
least once a year jointly by ADB and the NPMO during the ADB review missions. The review will 
assess implementation performance and achievement of project outcome and outputs, assess 
financial progress, identify issues and constraints affecting implementation, and work out a time-
bound action plan for their resolution. ADB and the NPMO will undertake a midterm review in the 
mid-year of the project implementation period to (i) conduct a detailed evaluation of the project 
scope, implementation arrangements, progress of the overall project and each component, and 
status of achieving the performance targets; and (ii) recommend appropriate measures, including 
changes in the project scope and/or implementation arrangements, reallocation of loan proceeds, 
changes  in  the  ADB  financing  ratios,  and  extension  of  the  loan  closing  date.  Promptly  after 
physical completion of the project, but in any event not later than 6 months thereafter or such later 
85 
date as ADB may agree for this purpose, the NPMO will prepare and submit to ADB a project 
completion  report,  in  such  form  and  in  such  detail  as ADB  shall  reasonably  request,  on  the 
implementation and evaluation of the project. 40F
42 
D. 
Reporting  
108.  The  NPMO  will  provide  ADB  with  (i)  semiannual  progress  reports  in  a  format  that 
acceptable to ADB, including (a) progress achieved by output as measured through the indicator's 
performance targets; (b) key implementation issues and solutions; (c) updated procurement plan; 
and (d) updated implementation plan for the next reporting period; (ii) audited annual report; (iii) 
consolidated financial statements; and (iv) a project completion report within 6 months of physical 
completion of the project. To ensure that projects will continue to be both viable and sustainable, 
project  accounts  and  the  executing  agency’s  audited  financial  statement,  together  with  the 
associated auditor's report, should be adequately reviewed. 
109.  The NPMO has agreed on the following reporting commitments:

Stakeholder Communication Strategy  
110.  Project information will be disclosed through ADB’s and government’s websites, meetings, 
interviews, focus group discussions, and community consultation meetings, in accordance with 
requirements of ADB’s information disclosure policy. Main stakeholders are the different agencies 
of  the  NPMO,  the  PPMOs,  the  CPMOs,  beneficiaries,  and  participants  in  the  project 
42   Project  completion  report  format  is  available  at:  http://www.adb.org/Consulting/consultants-toolkits/PCR-Public-

86 
implementation.  Stakeholder  communication  is  also part  of the  EMDP,  GAP,  LURT framework, 
and SDAP; and will be monitored accordingly.  
111.  Environment.  Meaningful  consultation,  participation,  and  information  disclosure  were 
conducted for environmental impact assessment during project preparation, including information 
disclosure, questionnaire surveys, informal visits to villages and households in the project areas, 
and stakeholder meetings attended by representatives of the affected public and other concerned 
stakeholders.  Dialogue  will  be  maintained  with  communities  in  the  project  areas  throughout 
project implementation. Future consultations will be undertaken by the PPMOs and the CPMOs, 
particularly  environment  officers  of  the  PPMOs  and  the  CPMOs,  via  questionnaire  surveys, 
household visits, workshops, and public hearings during construction. 
112.  Consultations with communities were conducted during preparation; and will be continued 
during the implementation of the EMDP, GAP, LURT framework, and SDAP—not only to inform 
people about project components or activities; but also to enable people to ask questions, make 
suggestions,  state  preferences,  and/or  express  concerns.  Special  attention  will  be  paid  to  the 
participation  of  women,  ethnic  minorities,  and  other  vulnerable  groups,  such  as  the  poor. The 
EMDP for the project has been disclosed on the ADB website. Social monitoring reports will be 
disclosed publicly. 
113.  Public disclosure. ADB, the NPMO, the PPMOs, and the CPMOs will disclose relevant 
project information to the public and interested parties. This includes particularly the information 
regarding the overall project and environment and social safeguards. The information disclosure 
measures for different stakeholders are described in Table 15.

ANTICORRUPTION POLICY 
115.  ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any violations of the 
43  All  contracts  financed  by  ADB  shall  include 
Anticorruption  Policy  relating  to  the  project.41F
provisions  specifying  the  right  of ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the 
executing agency and all project contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers. 
Individuals and/or entities on ADB’s anticorruption debarment list are ineligible to participate in 
the ADB-financed activity and may not be awarded any contracts under the project. 42F
44  
116.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  are  included  in  the  loan  and  project 
agreements and the bidding documents for the project.  
XI.  
ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISM 
117.  People  who  are,  or may  in the future  be,  adversely  affected  by  the  project may  submit 
complaints  to  ADB’s  Accountability  Mechanism.  The  Accountability  Mechanism  provides  an 
independent forum and process whereby people adversely affected by the ADB-assisted projects 
can voice and seek a resolution of their problems, as well as report alleged violations of ADB’s 
operational  policies  and  procedures.  Before  submitting  a  complaint  to  the  Accountability 
Mechanism, affected people should make an effort in good faith to solve their problems by working 
with  the  concerned  ADB  operations  department.  Only  after  doing  that,  and  if  they  are  still 
dissatisfied, should they approach the Accountability Mechanism.43F
45 
XII.   RECORD OF CHANGES TO THE PROJECT ADMINISTRATION MANUAL 
118.  All revisions and/or updates during the course of implementation should be retained in this 
section to provide a chronological history of changes to implemented arrangements recorded in 
the  project  administration  manual,  including  revision  to  contract  awards  and  disbursement  s-
curves.

APPENDIX 2: SUBPROJECT SELECTION CRITERIA AND GUIDING PRINCIPLES 
A. 
Introduction 
The  selection  criteria  explain  the  rationale  for  project  province,  county  and  activity 
1. 
selection for the project. The guiding principles provide guidance as to the type of activities that 
the  project  will  promote  under  the  project.  The  main  focus  on  selection  criteria  relates  to:  (i) 
meeting  essential  requirements  for  government  supporting  policies  in  the  Yangtze  River 
Economic Belt region of the People’s Republic of China (PRC); (ii) continuing to focus on, and 
involve, key agriculture related nonpoint source pollution, soil erosion-prone counties, and poverty 
alleviation  counties;  and  (iii)  including  integrated  demonstration  of  sustainable  farmland 
development, modern  agriculture  development, environmental  benefits, and poverty  alleviation 
and social development. 
2. 
The  key  technical  issue  to  be  addressed  by  the  project  is  agriculture  non-point  source 
pollution. Agriculture non-point source pollution can be from (a) excess fertilizers, herbicides and 
insecticides  from  agricultural  lands;  (b)  sediment  from  improperly  managed  construction  sites, 
crop and forest lands and eroding stream banks; (c) salt from irrigation practices; (d) bacteria and 
nutrients from livestock and aquaculture production systems; (e) improper waste management for 
crop/straw  residue.  Agriculture  non-point  source  pollution  is  a  leading  cause  of  water  quality 
problems  which  has  a  negative  impact  on  drinking  water  supplies,  recreation,  fisheries  and 
wildlife. 
3. 
The  selection  criteria  have  been  separated  into  two  components,  firstly  the  selection 
criteria  which  would  be  used  to  select  participating  counties  and  subprojects,  and  second  the 
guiding  principles,  which  would  need  to  be  followed  to  ensure  sound  subproject  design  and 
implementation. Selection criteria and guiding principles are outlined below. 
B. 
Selection Criteria 
1. 
Project County Selection Criteria 
4. 
Project counties should meet the following poverty and technical criteria: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
Poverty  criteria:  priority  should  be  given  to  key  national,  provincial-level  poverty 
alleviation  counties  and/or  less  developed  counties  eligible  for  the  central 
government's support; 
Priority should be given to key agriculture related non-point source pollution prone 
counties with demonstrable problems; and/or  
Priority  should  be  given  to  key  soil  erosion-prone  counties  with  demonstrable 
erosion problems; and/or  
Counties in modern agriculture demonstration zones complying with ADB’s project 
design which follows the principles of (a) sustainable development of agricultural 
land for economic purposes; (b) emphasis on environment, soil and water resource 
protection; and (c) ensuring there is opportunity for farmer households including 
the poor and vulnerable groups to participate in equitable benefit sharing from the 
project  which  promotes  cooperation  between  farmer  households,  cooperatives 
and project enterprises. 
2. 
Subproject Selection Criteria 
Subproject  selection  criteria  comprise  those  related  to  site,  activities,  community’s 
5. 
acceptance, and enterprises’ requirements, particularly the following: 
97 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
(v) 
(vi) 
Subprojects  should avoid  involuntary  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  impacts. 
Subproject  activities  (civil  works)  should  occur  within  available  lands  of  existing 
infrastructure  or  on  lands  of  beneficiary  farmers  or  villages.  Use  of  collective  or 
farmers’ lands should be based on collective’s or farmers’ consent and it should 
not cause adverse impacts to any third party (e.g. benefiting some farmers/villages 
while harming others). Land needed for temporary use during construction (e.g. 
contractors’  camp,  quarries,  etc.)  should  be  made  available  through  leases  or 
voluntary agreements.    
Subprojects should avoid adverse impacts to ethnic minority and other vulnerable 
groups and should ensure their participation and equitable benefits to them.  
Subprojects should avoid all ecologically sensitive areas, including protected areas 
(all types of national and provincial reserves, reservoirs, etc.), wetlands protected 
areas, water resources protection areas, documented sites for rare or threatened 
flora and fauna (including nationally protected species), and rare, threatened, or 
restricted-range habitats. It is assumed that these areas are identified and clearly 
described by the local (county) government. In the event that such sites are only 
detected in the TRTA stage, the NPMO and ADB would also review the need to 
remove the proposed site from the project. 
Land  with  a  slope  of  >25º  should  not  be  chosen  for  crop  production.  For  these 
slopes,  although  the  soil  and  water  conservation  law  indicated  that  planting 
perennials in combination with adequate erosion control measures is allowed, only 
sites that have been used before should be considered for rehabilitation. Design 
of these sloping sites should be such that risk of failure (e.g. collapse of terrace 
walls)  is  minimal.  Otherwise,  the  area  will  be kept  as  is,  or  improved  as  natural 
forest area with minimum disturbance.  
Activities proposed for support by the project should focus on farmland preparation 
and  its  related  infrastructure,  and  related  green  and  sustainable  production 
activities.  
Activities may include support to related facilities (a) processing facilities if these 
are  relevant  to  project  supported  value  chains,  and  (b)  provide  equipment  and 
training  materials  for  training  and/or  testing  centers.  Activities  that  will  not  be 
supported  by  the  project  include  investment  for  civil  works  for  training  and/or 
testing centers. 
(vii)  Road  construction  activities  should  be  classified  by  use,  size  and  road  surface. 
Selection  of  road  construction  activities  to  be  supported  by  the  project  will  be 
assessed on the need for, fit with the project objectives as well as economic and 
financial viability.   
(viii)  Subprojects must  be  selected  and  planned for  implementation  in  a  participatory 
manner  with  local  villages  and  stakeholders;  and  they  must  be  favorable  to 
villagers  in  sharing  potential  benefits:  particularly,  they  must  support  close 
cooperation  among  enterprises  and/or  cooperatives  and  villagers,  with  an 
emphasis  on  land  areas  under  various  cooperative  management  arrangements 
land  use 
between  enterprises  and  village  cooperatives.  Agreements  on 
agreements (land use rights transfer [LURT] or cooperative arrangements) should 
meet PRC regulations as well as ADB requirements on voluntary agreements (i.e. 
voluntariness,  fairness,  equity,  legality,  no  adverse  impacts  to  farmers/people, 
third-party validation, etc.).  
For any sub-projects with "associated facilities" (as defined by ADB's SPS), those 
facilities  will  already  have  all  relevant  domestic  environmental  and/or  social 
(ix) 
98 
approvals.  Associated  facilities  are  facilities  that  are  not  funded  as  part  of  the 
project  (funding  may  be  provided  separately  by  the  borrower/client  or  by  third 
parties), and whose viability and existence depend exclusively on the project and 
whose goods or services are essential for successful operation of the project, e.g. 
processing facilities. 
All  subprojects  should  meet  the  financial  and  economic  viability  assessment 
requirements (i.e., positive net present value or internal rate of return higher than 
the cost of capital). 
(x) 
C. 
Technical Guiding Principles—Subprojects 
6. 
Technical guiding principles relate to those practices that are required to ensure that the 
subprojects meet the requirements for reduced non-point source pollution, reduced soil erosion 
and promoting sustainable farming systems, particularly: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
(v) 
All  activities  for  the  modification  of  land  use,  including  preparation  for  either 
cropland  or  forest  plantation,  should  comply  with  strict  regulations  in  order  that 
exposure to erosive forces is kept to a minimum. Land clearing must be conducted 
according to technical specifications of soil and water conservation for slope land. 
Building terraces and soil tillage have to be carried out along contours and keeping 
vegetation between contour terraces to prevent soil erosion.  
In the choice of new crops or new farming systems, the protection of the soil must 
be  ensured.  For  any  new  system  or  crop,  the  time  and  degree  of  exposure  to 
erosive  forces  must  be  taken  into  consideration.  This  is  critical  for  crops  that 
develop slowly or form little canopy (such as onions) or farming/cultivation systems 
where soil has to be tilled intensively for seedbed preparation.  
Recommendations  of  fertilizer  application  (rates)  based  on  local  soil  and  crop 
conditions MUST be followed to avoid non-point source pollution. 
Subprojects involving transfer of contracted land must not include either land-lease 
arrangements against current laws and regulations concerning land or land-lease 
arrangements signed by village officials without knowledge and consent of village 
members.  For  transfer  of  un-contracted  land,  village  representatives  meeting 
records and signatures are required. 
Participating enterprises and farmer cooperatives must be committed to adopting 
international  best-practices  for  soil  and  water  management  and  conservation 
within their project designs.
