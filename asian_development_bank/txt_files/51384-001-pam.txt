Project Administration Manual Purpose and Process 
  The  project  administration  manual  (PAM)  describes  the  essential  administrative  and 
management requirements to implement the project on time, within budget, and in accordance 
with the policies and procedures of the government and Asian Development Bank (ADB). The 
PAM should include references to all available templates and instructions either through linkages 
to relevant URLs or directly incorporated in the PAM. 
  The  Hezhou  Municipal  Government  as  project  executing  agency,  and  Pinggui  District 
Government  and  Guangxi  Hezhou  Mining  Investment  Group  Company  Limited  as  project 
implementing agencies are wholly responsible for the implementation of ADB financed projects, 
as  agreed  jointly  between  the  borrower  and  ADB,  and  in  accordance  with  the  policies  and 
procedures of the government and ADB. ADB staff is responsible for supporting implementation 
including  compliance  by  executing  and  implementing  agencies  of  their  obligations  and 
responsibilities for project implementation in accordance with ADB’s policies and procedures. 
  At loan negotiations, the borrower and ADB shall agree to the PAM and ensure consistency with 
the loan agreement. Such agreement shall be reflected in the minutes of the loan negotiations. 
In the event of any discrepancy or contradiction between the PAM and the loan agreement, the 
provisions of the loan agreement shall prevail. 
  After ADB Board approval of the project's report and recommendations of the President (RRP), 
changes in implementation arrangements are subject to agreement and approval pursuant to 
relevant government and ADB administrative procedures (including the Project Administration 
Instructions) and upon such approval, they will be subsequently incorporated in the PAM.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
1. 
The project will help Hezhou (i) reduce pollution in and improve the environment of the 
former mineral mining area; (ii) provide essential and inclusive social services, including health 
and elderly care, and skills development; and (iii) strengthen institutions to make former mineral 
mining  workers’  living  areas  in  Hezhou  green,  inclusive,  healthy,  and  sustainable.  People  in 
Hezhou  will  benefit  from  strengthened  environmental  sustainability  and  improved  services  in 
urban and rural areas. 
A. 
Rationale 
2. 
The  People’s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  witnessed  average  annual  economic  growth  of 
about 10% in 1980–2009 and about 7% in 2010–2020. Behind this remarkable economic growth 
were  industrial  and  mining  activities  that  polluted  and  severely  damaged  the  environment, 
threatening health because of weak environmental regulations and inadequate monitoring and 
enforcement. Many industrial and mining areas were left heavily polluted and without adequate 
environmental protection, and about 80% of abandoned mining areas are not properly treated.1 
The PRC has more than 110,000 mines, 244 cities with mineral resource development as the 
main industry, and 62 resource-depleted cities. The country has more than (i) 2.2 million hectares 
of mining-damaged land, (ii) 11 billion cubic meters of annual output of mine wastewater, and (iii) 
48 billion tons of mine solid waste accumulation.2 
3. 
As the economy grows, so does demand for a high-quality health-care system. The PRC 
initiated national health-care reform in 2009 to provide affordable, equitable, and effective health 
care  for  all.3 The  reform  focused  on  multidimensional  aspects  of  the  health  system,  including 
social health security, primary health care, public hospitals, essential medicines, and basic public 
health services. The reform made good progress: 95% of the population was covered by social 
health  insurance  by  the  end  of  2017,  the  rural  and  urban  basic  health  insurance  systems  are 
being integrated, a tiered health-care system was started in most municipalities, the government 
invested  significantly  in  the  primary  health-care  system,  and  overall  hospital  delivery  capacity 
shows  an  upward  trend  as  seen  in  the  increasing  number  of  beds  and  doctors. 4 However, 
challenges remain. The PRC has a three-tiered system for health-care delivery: the rural system 
consists  of county-level  hospitals,  township  health  centers,  and  village  clinics,  while  the  urban 
system  consists  of  municipal,  district,  and  community-level  health  services.5 Township  health 
centers manage the village clinics. The quality of primary health care is inadequate, and education 
and qualification levels among primary health-care professionals are low.6 Primary  health-care 
institutions are expected to work closely with communities. Because of the low quality of primary 
health  care  and  the  absence  of  a  referral  system,  however,  a  growing  proportion  of  medical 
resources  and  patients  are  in  secondary  or  tertiary  hospitals.  Most  patients  return  home  after 
discharge  from  hospitals,  which  have  no  referral  service.  The  competitive  relationship  among 
hospitals’  payment  systems  hinders  efficiency. Medical  insurance  funds  are  limited,  and  many

rehabilitation  hospitals  provide  services  item  by  item,  lacking  evaluation  and  performance 
payment management. Insufficient coordination and fragmented systems are another challenge. 
Intersector  coordination  among  different  health  institutions  or  referral  systems  is  essential  to 
deliver people-centered, integrated, cost-effective care, and to ensure its continuity. 
4. 
The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region (GZAR) has 9,538 mines; 5,455 are closed or 
abandoned, of which about 30% need treatment for environmental damage.7 Hezhou Municipality 
is in northeast GZAR and has a population of 2.9 million.8 Hezhou is among the least-developed 
cities in GZAR.9 The area, including Hezhou’s Pinggui District and the Kedashan mountain area, 
was once called the “1,000-year tin capital,” historically known as a source of tin, iron, and other 
minerals;  intensive  tin  mining,  led  by  the  state-owned  entity,  Pinggui  Mining  Bureau  (PMB), 
started  in  the  1900s.  Tin  resources  were  exhausted  by  the  1990s,  and  private  companies 
continued mining iron and other minerals. The PMB stopped operation in 2003 after becoming 
bankrupt. The Hezhou Municipal Government (HMG) shut down all illegal and uncertified mining 
operations  in  Kedashan  after  a  major  environmental  pollution  incident  in  2013.  It  caused  the 
shutdown of water supply intakes for 15 days along the He River and the downstream Pearl River, 
affecting about 57 million people. Although the cause of the incident was not the Kedashan mines, 
the event triggered the HMG to review environmental pollution in Kedashan; the HMG had not 
been controlling or mitigating environmental deterioration in the mining areas. By 2017, the last 
legally operating mineral mining operation in Kedashan was closed. 
5. 
The HMG started restoring the environment and improving mining sites in 2018 because 
many were abandoned or not properly closed or restored when the companies stopped operating. 
The lack of government’s and mining companies’ active management to contain deterioration of 
the  soil  and  water  pollution  in  the  abandoned  mining  sites,  including  in  Kedashan,  and  the 
absence of any meaningful remediation program have exacerbated environmental conditions.10 
The HMG urgently needs to improve Kedashan’s environment to avoid potential pollution. 
The  downturn  of  the  mineral  mining  industry  resulted  in  dramatic  adverse  effects  on 
6. 
provision of social services and employment in Hezhou, especially in Pinggui, where many mining 
workers resided.11 Since many have lost their jobs, they have struggled to find new sources of 
income. In the PRC, state-owned entities supported local communities by providing facilities such 
as housing, schools, and hospitals for workers and their families. 
7. 
With  the  PMB  bankrupt,  the  health  services  it  provided  ceased  or  were  acquired  by  a 
private medical service provider, and many experienced medical professionals were dismissed 
and relocated. The distribution of medical resources in Hezhou is unbalanced, with high-quality

11 Pinggui has a population of 467,500, 85% rural, and consists of 9 townships with 120 villages. Pinggui is a county 
district.  The  PRC  has  provinces,  autonomous  regions,  and  provincial  centrally  administered  cities.  Under  the 
provinces and autonomous regions are prefectures and prefectural cities. Under the prefectures are counties and 
county cities and districts. Under the counties are towns, townships, and urban streets. L. Zhang, R. LeGates, and

medical services concentrated in Babu District, which undertakes acute medical treatment, and 
primary health-care service at local hospitals is inadequate. The only public county-level hospital 
in Pinggui was designated as a Hezhou municipal-level infectious diseases hospital in 2020 and 
does not offer general medical services.12 Townships and villages have hospitals, but their service 
quality and capacity are limited. In addition to providing the required facilities, Pinggui urgently 
needs to improve health services and design strong health institutions and systems to meet local 
health-care needs, especially to manage allocation of medical service resources in the district, 
local  occupational  diseases  that  affect  mining  communities,  provision  of  women’s  health  care, 
integration of community health care and well-being, and building of healthy communities. Pinggui 
does not have a rural three-tiered health-care system that is led by a county-level hospital and 
coordination and referral system between different levels of health care in the district and other 
city health institutions. Efforts to strengthen coordination among health service providers in the 
rural three-tiered health-care system can be supported by the growing availability of digital health-
care solutions such as internet-based diagnoses in remote areas, online appointments, medical 
reports,  and  billings,  and  smart  information  technology-based  hospital  operation  and  facility 
management. 
8. 
The  elderly,  aged  over  65  years  old,  account  for  9.5%  of  Pinggui’s  population.  Many 
elderly,  including  their  families,  prefer  home-based  care.  But  after  being  discharged  from  a 
hospital  to  receive  care  and  rehabilitation,  they  need  affordable  services  and  facilities  for  the 
disabled, semi-disabled, or those affected by dementia. The Pinggui Integrated Health and Elderly 
Care Center (PIHECC), working with the Xiwan Community Medical Center, can meet the needs 
of  the  growing  number  of  elderly.  However,  the  Xiwan  Community  Medical  Center  lacks  the 
management capacity to set up coordination systems between medical and elderly-care facilities, 
administration standards, and evaluation systems. 
9. 
Although mineral mining has stopped, Hezhou is still a leading producer of high-quality 
marble,  general  stonework  products,  and  calcium  carbonate.  Hezhou  has  been  shifting  the 
economy to calcium carbonate-based industries and creating a green and circular economy.13 
Industries in Pinggui are upgrading their technologies, and demand for workers who have green 
and  modern  production  knowledge  and  skills  is  increasing.  As  local  jobs  increase,  many  out-
migration workers working in other provinces are willing to return to Pinggui. Left-behind women 
will  have  job  options  if  family  members  can  live  together  and  share  household  tasks.  Pinggui 
residents have high demand for skills training, including in health and patient care, to care for 
family members. Pinggui does not have any skills training public institutions. Hezhou has several 
degree-granting colleges and institutions offering technical and vocational education and training, 
and private educational and training institutions. However, the institutions cannot accommodate 
or provide residents with adequate nondegree training in market-demanded practical skills and 
knowledge. Pinggui is establishing a public Knowledge and Skills Sharing Center (KSSC) to offer 
short- and medium-term nondegree practical training. Still, Pinggui lacks the capacity to plan and 
operate the needed skills training. 
10. 
COVID-19  pandemic.  The  coronavirus  disease  (COVID-19)  pandemic  amplified health 
risks, particularly for Hezhou and Pinggui, because of their inadequate health-care services. The 
only  public  county-level  hospital  in  Pinggui  was  designated  for  infectious  diseases  (including 
COVID-19) for Hezhou City in 2020; Pinggui does not have county-level public general medical 
services. Measures to prevent infectious diseases are needed. Environmental improvement and 
12 Pinggui has only one county-level private medical institution and it does not meet Pinggui’s demand.

provision of health services are critical to the PRC’s recovery from COVID-19, and the project is 
committed to helping achieve that goal. 
11. 
Strategic alignment. The project will support the Outline of the Plan for Healthy China 
2030 and the Healthy Hezhou 2030 Plan by improving the quality and services of the health-care 
system;  and  the  PRC’s  Fourteenth Five-Year  Plan,  2021–2025  by  improving  the  environment, 
controlling pollution, and strengthening the health system.14 A PRC circular identified the county-
level  cities,  districts,  and  counties  as  critical  to  carrying  out  urbanization.15 County-level  areas 
lack  the  capacity,  services,  and  infrastructure  to  ensure  quality  public  services  and  a  livable 
environment,  and  job  skills  support,  including  for  rural–urban  migrants.  The  circular  listed 
environmental  and  health  capacity  and  facilities  as  critical  areas  for  improvement.  The  project 
aligns with GZAR’s strategy to promote systems that can improve referrals for graded diagnosis 
and treatment, and Hezhou’s plan to pilot comprehensive reform of urban public hospitals and 
develop an integrated health- and elderly-care system. The COVID-19 outbreak in 2020 exposed 
the county-level areas’ vulnerability to the epidemic because of lack of capacity and environmental 
and sanitation facilities, which the project can remedy. 
12. 
The project is aligned with six operational priorities of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) 
Strategy  2030  by  boosting  human  capital  and  social  protection;  gender  equality  in  human 
development; environmental sustainability; access, quality, and reliability of urban services; rural 
development; and governance and institutional capacity for service delivery.16 The project is in 
line with ADB’s Operational Plan for Health, 2015–2020, by strengthening health systems and 
elderly  care,  and  with  the  country  partnership  strategy  for  the  PRC,  2021–2025,  by  reducing 
pollution, responding to the needs of an aging society, and strengthening institutions for health- 
and  elderly-care  systems. 17  The  project  supports  the  achievement  of  the  United  Nations’ 
Sustainable Development Goals 3, 4, 5, 6, 12, 13, and 15.18

5 
output includes removal of abandoned polluting mining facilities, wastes, and tailings; restoration 
of damaged or exposed ground surface, including planting of trees and vegetation; construction 
of onsite treatment and stabilization of a plant and landfill to treat the removed mining wastes and 
tailings, and closure of the plant and landfill after treatment; nature-based treatment of polluted 
surface  water;  development  of  a  long-term  environment-  and  pollution-monitoring  system  in 
Kedashan, and commencement of monitoring; and formulation of practical guidance for nature-
based improvement of Hezhou’s mountain areas’ environment. 
15. 
Output  2:  Institutional  mechanisms,  skills  capacities,  and  facilities  in  health  and 
elderly care strengthened. The output, part of the Pinggui subproject, will strengthen Hezhou’s 
county-level institutions, working mechanisms, and stakeholders’ capacities to deliver high-quality 
health  and  elderly  care.  For  health  care,  the  output  will  support  the  design  of  a  practical 
institutional  working  mechanism  and  system  to  build  a  medical  community,  through  which  the 
Pinggui Workers’ Hospital (PWH) will coordinate support to strengthen the quality and capacity of 
township and village-level primary health care; establishment of a medical community information 
platform at PWH, connected with Pinggui’s township and village-level public medical institutions; 
construction of PWH, a county-level IIA general public hospital;21 development of administration 
capacity of managers and technical capacity of doctors, nurses, health-care workers, and staff of 
PWH to deliver high-quality services; upgrade of equipment of nine township-level hospitals to 
improve primary care service delivery and quality; and provision of training to build the technical 
capacity of township and village-level rural hospital staff to improve primary care service quality. 
For elderly care, the output will support the construction of PIHECC; establishment of working 
mechanisms and integration of medical and elderly care at PIHECC, including administration and 
operation  capacity  training  for  the  center’s  administrators  and  managers;  and  development  of 
technical capacity of PIHECC health-care staff (doctors, nurses, caregivers) to deliver high-quality 
services.  The  constructed  project  facilities  will  be  green  (certified  as  Chinese  Green  Building 
Standard [CGBS] Star-2 after operation) and inclusive (considering the needs of women, persons 
with  disabilities  [PWDs],  the  elderly,  and  ethnic  minorities). 22 The  facilities  will  adopt  building 
information  modeling  for  lean  building  construction  and  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M), 
including green procurement. 
16. 
Output 3: Green and health care-related skills development institutions established. 
As  part  of  the  Pinggui  subproject,  the  output  will  help  Hezhou  provide  Pinggui  residents  with 
nondegree vocational skills development opportunities to match the latest market needs, including 
green and health care-related skills. To offer the required nondegree training, the government will 
construct the KSSC, which will be green (certified as CGBS Star-2 after operation) and inclusive 
(considering  the  needs  of  women,  PWDs,  the  elderly,  and  ethnic  minorities).  The  output  will 
support an operational study to optimize training quality at the KSSC based on demand, including 
skills  certification  mechanisms,  a  human  resource  development  plan,  and  course  setting  in 
potential  collaboration  with  local  private  companies;  preparation  of  a  training  plan  for  KSSC 
managers and teachers; and provision of equipment required for course and training delivery.

Project management activities. The project will support the executing and implementing 
agencies and project implementation units (PIUs) in (i) management, monitoring, and reporting of 
the complex multisector project; (ii) external monitoring of the implementation of safeguards and 
social and gender action plans; (iii) construction supervision to ensure high-quality construction; 
21 General hospitals are classified into grades I, II, and III, based on size, facilities, and staffing. Secondary hospitals 
(grade II A or B) are regional hospitals that provide comprehensive medical and health services to communities and 
have 101–500 beds.

Summary of Project’s Activities 
The Kedashan subproject will produce output 1, and the Pinggui subproject will produce 
18. 
outputs 2 and 3. Appendix 1 summarizes all the planned project activities. 
D. 
Kedashan’s Monitoring Program 
19. 
The  specified  monitoring  program,  Kedashan  Monitoring  Program,  for  the  Kedashan 
subproject is in Appendix 2. This is a monitoring scheme dedicated to monitor the environmental 
restoration in Kedashan and separate from project-wide monitoring required in the environmental 
management plan (EMP) (attachment to the environmental impact assessment). The Kedashan 
Monitoring Program also contributes to monitoring indicators listed in the design and monitoring 
framework (DMF). 
20. 
The  main  objective  of  the  Kedashan  Monitoring  Program  is  to  ensure  the  continuous 
monitoring of landfill site and water quality even after the loan closure because the mining waste 
landfill in the Kedashan area is a sensitive issue concerned by ADB and local governments. The 
Kedashan Monitoring Program is supported by counterpart financing (procurement package: CS-
KDS-01).  The  Kedashan  Monitoring  Program  is  independent  and  distinct  from  environmental 
monitoring activities under the EMP. For example, (i) Kedashan Monitoring Program only focuses 
on  Kedashan  subproject,  while  the  EMP  covers  both  Pinggui  and  Kedashan  subprojects; 
(ii) Kedashan Monitoring Program monitors soil, groundwater, and surface water, while the EMP 
will also monitor the noise, air, and safety during construction, etc.; (iii) the Kedashan Monitoring 
Program will collect more samples and higher monitoring frequency; (iv) the Kedashan Monitoring 
Program  should  continue  until  the  landfill  does  not  bring  negative  impact.  The  EMP  will  cover 
stages of design, construction, and early years of operation. The location and details of monitoring 
wells  should  be  defined  during  preliminary  design  and  integrated  into  the  W-KDS-02  works 
package  of  the  Kedashan  subproject.  The  monitoring  activities  under  EMP  also  cover  the 
monitoring of wells/sites in the Kedashan Monitoring Program for further verification. 
E. 
Quality Control Mechanism for Institutional Strengthening Activities 
21. 
For the institutional strengthening/technical support/studies components, consultants will 
be recruited, contracted, and managed by two PIUs: Guangxi Hezhou Mining Investment Group 
Company  Limited  (HMIGC)  and  Hezhou  Pinggui  Urban  Construction  Investment  Company 
Limited (PUCIC) (see section III for project management arrangements). Meanwhile, a working 
group will be established with relevant municipal level and county-level bureaus and stakeholders 
and  will  be  responsible  for  the  overall  quality  control  of  the  study,  outcomes  review,  and 
application  of  the  results  or  recommendations.  Table  1  shows  an  indicative  working  group  for 
each technical study.

Quality Control Mechanism for Design and Construction Activities 
The  project  facilities  will  be  green  (certified  as  CGBS  Star-2  after  the  operation)  and 
22. 
inclusive by considering the needs of women, PWDs, elderly, and ethnic minorities. The facilities 
will also adopt building information modeling for lean building construction and O&M, including 
green procurement. To ensure the quality of the preliminary design, construction drawing, and 
construction, several quality control mechanisms are proposed (Table 2). 
Table 2: Indicative Quality Control Mechanism for Design and Construction Activities

The terms of reference will include the requirements for green, inclusive design, BIM, 
green procurement, etc.  
The draft preliminary design will be reviewed by architecture expert. 
Design institute will hand over the BIM dataset to PIUs so that PIUs will hand over to the 
contractors to use it during the construction stage. 
Bidding documents should include all ADB requirements on technical and safeguards. 
Section VI technical specifications will be reviewed for prior review packages. 
Terms of reference for construction supervision will be detailed and refined during the 
start-up stage.

Capacity Building Activities 
Annual updating of the capacity development plans. Capacity building activities, such 
23. 
as  cost  for  training,  study  tours,  and  workshop,  do  not  appear  as  procurement  or  consulting 
packages.  Therefore,  the  capacity  development  plan  needs  to  be  formulated  in  advance  and 
submitted to ADB for approval before  the activity takes place. The draft capacity development 
plan is in Appendix 3. ADB requests that Hezhou project management office (HPMO), HMIGC, 
and  Pinggui  District  Government  (PDG)  with  PUCIC  prepare  an  annual  capacity  development 
plan;  and  that  HPMO  (with  support  from  project  management  and  implementation  support 
consultant [PMISC]) to review, approve, and consolidate all the parties’ annual plan and submit it 
to ADB by 5 January each year. If there are any changes and updates in the annual capacity 
development plan, HPMO, HMIGC, and PDG with PUCIC, will inform ADB through HPMO. The 
suggested timing of the capacity development plan preparation and submission is in Table 3.

Detailed capacity development activities plan (before the activities). Because the activities 
described in the annual capacity development plan will still be generic, ADB requests (i) HPMO, 
(ii) HMIGC, and (iii) PDG with PUCIC to develop a detailed activity plan for each activity. HPMO 
(with  the  support  of  PMISC)  will  review,  ensure  the  quality,  and  send  the  detailed  capacity 
development activities plan to ADB to obtain the ADB’s prior approval 3 weeks before the start of 
the  activity.  Upon  ADB’s  approval,  implementing  agencies  may  proceed  to  organize  and 
implement  the  activity  and  claim  the  approved  costs  against  the  ADB  loan.  HPMO,  with  the 
support of PMISC, will develop a template, and the items to be included in each detailed capacity 
building activities plan are: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv)

budget details (cost breakdown), 
agenda or program of the activities or training, and 
planned list of participants. 
25. 
During and after the capacity development activities. During the activities, HPMO, HMIGC, 
and PDG with PUCIC will ensure that good records of the activities are kept for later reporting of 
the following: 
(i) 
list  of  actual  participants  with  gender  segregation  (how  many  female  and  male 
participants, etc.); 
(ii) 
(iii) 
detailed reports of the training; and 
evaluation of the training from the participants.

The  government  has  requested  a  regular  loan  of  €84.246  million  ($100.00  million 
equivalent) from ADB’s ordinary capital resources to help finance the project.24 The loan will have 
a  25-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  6  years;  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in 
accordance  with  ADB’s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility;  a 
commitment charge of 0.15% per year (the interest and other charges during construction will not 
be capitalized in the loan); and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and 
project agreements. Based on the annuity method, the average maturity is 18.53 years, and the 
maturity premium payable to ADB is 0.50% per year. 
The summary financing plan is in Table 15. ADB will finance the expenditures in relation 
41. 
to institutional strengthening, capacity building, technical support, consulting services, goods, and 
works.  ADB  will  finance  42.4%,  and  the  government  will  finance  57.6%  of  the  cost.  The 
counterpart financing will come from self-raised funds of the end-borrowers.

Climate mitigation is estimated to cost $11.75 million and climate adaptation is estimated 
42. 
to cost $14.67 million. ADB will finance 41.92% of mitigation costs ($4.93 million) and 56.32% of 
adaptation  costs  ($8.26  million).  The  total  annual  carbon  dioxide  emission  reduction  is  about 
1,830  tons,  mainly  from  project  facilities’  integration  of  heat  insulation  layer  in  the  building 
structure and achievement of CGBS Star-2. 
43. 
The PRC Government is the borrower of the loan and will make the loan available through 
GZAR  Government  to  HMG  under  its  relending  arrangements  upon  terms  and  conditions 
satisfactory to ADB. HMG will onlend the loan proceeds to (i) HMIGC, and (ii) PUCIC through 
PDG. The terms and conditions for relending and onlending of the loan proceeds will be the same 
as  those  of  the  ADB  loan.  HMG  will  assume  the  interest  and  foreign  exchange  variation  risks 
relating to their respective portions of the loan proceeds.

FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT 
A. 
Financial Management Assessment 
The financial management assessment (FMA) was conducted in accordance with ADB’s 
48. 
guidelines. 26  The  FMA  considered  the  capacity  of  the  executing  agency  and  the  two  end-
borrowers,  including  funds-flow  arrangements,  staffing,  accounting,  and  financial  reporting 
systems, financial information systems, and internal and external auditing arrangements. 
49. 
The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region (GZAR) has implemented many foreign-funded 
projects,  including  ADB’s,  and  GZAR  Finance  Department  (GZARFD)  has  been  assessed  as 
capable  of  undertaking  the  required  financial  supervision.  Hezhou  Finance  Bureau  (HFB),  on 
behalf of the executing agency (HMG), is responsible for the high-level financial supervision of 
the project and to onlend the ADB loan to implementing agencies. HFB will review and approve 
the ADB loan withdrawal applications prepared by the implementing agencies before submitting 
them to GZARFD. HFB will not provide counterpart funding for the project from its fiscal budget. 
HPMO,  established  within  the  Foreign  Loan  Office  of  Hezhou  Development  and  Reform 
Commission  (HDRC),  is  responsible  for  daily  coordination  and  management  of  project 
implementation, including communication with implementing agencies—Guangxi Hezhou Mining 
Investment Group Company Limited (HMIGC) and Pinggui District Government (PDG). HMIGC 
is also a project implementation unit (PIU) for the Kedashan subproject and an end borrower of 
the ADB loan. Another end borrower is Hezhou Pinggui Urban Construction Investment Company 
Limited  (PUCIC),  which  is  owned  by  and  under  the  administration  of  PDG  and  a  PIU  for  the 
Pinggui subproject. 
50. 
Based  on  the  assessment,  the  key  financial  management  risks  identified  are  poor 
coordination  among  different  agencies,  inadequate  organizational  structure  to  support  and 
supervise project implementation, and lack of familiarity with ADB’s requirements and procedures 
for  financial  management.  It  is concluded  that the  overall  pre-mitigation  financial management 
risk  of  HMG  and  two  end-borrowers  is  substantial.  The  FMA  confirmed  that  with  the 
implementation of financial management action plan, the HMG, implementing agencies, and PIUs 
can properly conduct financial management, including fund flow management, use of statement 
of expenditures (SOE) procedure, accounting and financial reporting, and auditing. 
51. 
The HMG, implementing agencies, and PIUs have agreed to implement the action plan 
as key measures to address the deficiencies. The identified financial management risks and the 
implementation of agreed mitigation measures will need to be closely monitored during project 
implementation. The financial management action plan is provided in Table 24.

Disbursement Arrangements for ADB Funds 
52. 
The  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  Loan  Disbursement 
Handbook  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time), 27 and  detailed  arrangements  agreed  upon 
between the government and ADB. Online training for project staff on disbursement policies and 
procedures  is  available.28 Project  staff  are  encouraged  to  avail  of  this  training  to  help  ensure

efficient disbursement and fiduciary control. 
53. 
The  fund  flow  is  shown  in  Figure  6.  The  responsibility  for  collecting  and  retaining 
supporting  documents  at  the  subproject  level  rests  with  the  PIUs  (HMIGC  and  PUCIC).  The 
withdrawal  applications  are  prepared  by  the  PIUs  and  reviewed  and  signed  by  an  authorized 
senior administrator of each PIU. Then, for PUCIC, the withdrawal applications will be submitted 
to  Pinggui  District  Finance  Bureau.  HMIGC  and  Pinggui  District  Finance  Bureau,  with  support 
from  project  management  and  implementation  support  consultant  (PMISC)  engaged  under 
HPMO,  will  submit  the  withdrawal  applications  to  HPMO  and  then  to  HFB,  who  approves  and 
endorses  submission  to  GZARFD.  GZARFD  will  then  review  and  submit  the  withdrawal 
applications to ADB. 
The  project  will  use  a  combination  of  direct  payment  by  ADB,  reimbursement,  and 
54. 
advance  fund  procedures  for  disbursements  of  the  loan.  Responsibilities  for  different 
disbursement  activities  are  summarized  as  follows:  (i)  HPMO  will  prepare  project  level 
disbursement  projections  based  on  individual  projections  prepared  by  HMIGC  and  PDG; 
(ii) HMIGC  and  PUCIC  will  be  responsible  for  arranging  counterpart  financing  or  requesting 
budgetary allocations for counterpart funding; (iii) HMG will ensure counterpart contributions are 
provided for project implementation on time; (iv) HMIGC and PDG will prepare reimbursement 
claims  and  supporting  documents  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook 
(2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time),  which  will  then  be  forwarded  to  HPMO  for  review  and 
endorsement  before  onward  transmission  to  HFB;  and  (v)  GZARFD  is  responsible  for  making 
payments  from  the  advance  account  and  is  also  responsible  for  sending  loan  withdrawal 
applications to ADB to initiate either advance account replenishment or request direct payments 
where  appropriate.  For  consulting  services  engaged  at  HPMO,  GZARFD  will  generally  pay 
directly to the consultants from the advance account. For other capacity building activities other 
than consulting services engaged at the municipal level, GZARFD will also generally pay directly 
to the contractors from the advance account. 
55. 
Advance  fund  procedure.  GZARFD  will  establish  and  maintain  a  separate  advance 
account  dedicated  for  this  project  promptly  after  loan  effectiveness  at  a  commercial  bank  to 
facilitate the project implementation through the timely release of loan proceeds. The currency of 
the advance account is the Euro. The advance account is to be used exclusively for ADB’s share 
of  eligible  expenditures.  GZARFD,  who  administers  the  advance  account,  is  accountable  and 
responsible for the proper use of advances to the advance account. 
The total outstanding advance to the advance account should not exceed the estimate of 
56. 
ADB’s  share  of  expenditures  to  be  paid  through  the  advance  account  for  the  forthcoming 
6 months.  The  HMG,  through  HPMO,  may  request  for  initial  and  additional  advances  to  the 
advance  account  based  on  an  Estimate  of  Expenditure  Sheet 29  setting  out  the  estimated 
expenditures  to  be  financed  through  the  account  for  the  forthcoming  6  months.  Supporting 
documents should be submitted to ADB or retained by HPMO, on behalf of the  executing and 
implementing  agencies,  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2017,  as 
amended from time to time) when liquidating or replenishing the advance account. 
57. 
Statement  of  expenditure  procedure. 30  The  SOE  procedure  may  be  used  for 
29 Estimate  of  Expenditure  sheet  is  available  in  Appendix  8A  of  ADB’s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2017,  as 
amended from time to time),

time to time). 
43 
reimbursement  of  eligible  expenditures  or  liquidation  of  advances  to  the  advance  account. 
Supporting  documents  and  records  for  the  expenditures  claimed  under  the  SOE  should  be 
maintained and made readily available for review by ADB's disbursement and review missions, 
upon  ADB's  request  for  submission  of  supporting  documents  on  a  sampling  basis,  and  for 
independent audit. 
58. 
Before the submission of the first withdrawal application, the borrower should submit to 
ADB sufficient evidence of the authority of the person(s) who will sign the withdrawal applications 
on  behalf  of  the  government,  together  with  the  authenticated  specimen  signatures  of  each 
authorized  person.  The  minimum  value  per  withdrawal  application  is  stipulated  in  the  Loan 
Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time). Individual payments below such 
amount  should  be  paid  (i)  by  the  executing  agency  and/or  implementing  agencies  and 
subsequently claimed to ADB through reimbursement, or (ii) through the advance fund procedure, 
unless otherwise accepted by ADB.  The borrower should ensure sufficient category and contract 
balances before requesting disbursements. Use of ADB’s Client Portal for Disbursements system 
is encouraged for submission of withdrawal applications to ADB.31 
59. 
Conditions for withdrawals from loan account. No withdrawals shall be made from the 
loan account until the borrower shall cause HMG to certify that each of the onlending agreements 
shall have been duly executed and delivered, and all conditions precedent to their effectiveness 
(other than a condition requiring the effectiveness of loan agreement) shall have been fulfilled. 
2. 
Disbursement Arrangements for Counterpart Fund 
For  the  counterpart  funds,  HMIGC  and  PUCIC  will  be  responsible  for  arranging 
60. 
counterpart financing or requesting budgetary allocations for counterpart funding, and HMG will 
ensure  counterpart  contributions  are  provided  for  project  implementation  on  time.  The 
implementing  agencies  will  be  responsible  for  their  own  counterpart  fund  and  will  pay  their 
contractors,  suppliers,  and  consultants  using  their  normal  payment  procedures.  Counterpart 
funds  will  be  fully  segregated  from  ADB  funds.  Each  implementing  agency  will  prepare 
disbursement projections. 
C. 
Accounting 
61. 
The  HMG,  implementing  agencies,  and  PIUs  will  maintain,  or  cause  to  be  maintained, 
separate  books  and  records  by  funding  source  for  all  expenditures  incurred  on  the  project 
following accrual-based accounting system and in accordance with the accounting policies and 
procedures issued by the PRC Ministry of Finance. The HMG, through the HPMO, will prepare 
consolidated project financial statements in accordance with the government’s accounting laws 
and regulations, which are consistent with international accounting principles and practices. 
D. 
Auditing and Public Disclosure 
62. 
The HMG will cause the detailed consolidated project financial statements to be audited 
in  accordance  with  the  National  Auditing  Standards,  by  an  independent  auditor  acceptable  to 
ADB. The audited project financial statements together with the auditor’s opinion will be presented 
in the English language to ADB within 6 months from the end of the fiscal year by the HMG.

The  audited  entity  financial  statements  for  two  state-owned  enterprises  (HMIGC  and 
63. 
PUCIC), together with the auditor’s report and management letter, will be submitted in the English 
language to ADB within 1 month after their approval by the relevant authority. 
The  audit  report  for  the  consolidated  project  financial  statements  will  include  a 
64. 
management letter and auditor’s opinions, which cover (i) whether the project financial statements 
present an accurate and fair view or are presented fairly, in all material respects, in accordance 
with the applicable financial reporting standards; (ii) whether the proceeds of the loan were used 
only for the purposes of the project; and (iii) whether the borrower or executing agency was in 
compliance with the financial covenants contained in the legal agreements. 
65. 
Compliance with financial reporting and auditing requirements will be monitored by review 
missions and during normal program supervision, and followed up regularly with all concerned, 
including the external auditor. 
66. 
The government, HMG, and the implementing agencies have been made aware of ADB’s 
approach to delayed submission, and the requirements for satisfactory and acceptable quality of 
the  audited  project  financial  statements. 32 ADB  reserves  the  right  to  require  a  change  in  the 
auditor (in a manner consistent with the constitution of the borrower), or for additional support to 
be provided to the auditor, if the audits required are not conducted in a manner satisfactory to 
ADB,  or  if  the  audits  are  substantially  delayed.  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  verify  the  project's 
financial accounts to confirm that the share of ADB’s financing is used in accordance with ADB’s 
policies and procedures. 
Public disclosure of the audited project financial statements, including the auditor’s opinion 
67. 
on the project financial statements, will be guided by ADB’s Access to Information Policy.33 After 
the  review,  ADB  will  disclose  the  audited  project  financial  statements  and  the  opinion  of  the 
auditors on the project financial statements no later than 14 days of ADB’s confirmation of their 
acceptability  by  posting  them  on  ADB’s  website.  The  management  letter,  additional  auditor’s 
opinions, and audited entity financial statements will not be disclosed.34 
32 ADB’s approach and procedures regarding delayed submission of audited project financial statements:  
(i)  When audited project financial statements are not received by the due date, ADB will write to the executing 
agency advising that (a) the audit documents are overdue; and (b) if they are not received within the next 6 
months, requests for new contract awards and disbursement such as new replenishment of advance accounts, 
processing of new reimbursement, and issuance of new commitment letters will not be processed. 
(ii)  When  audited  project  financial  statements  are  not  received  within  6  months  after  the  due  date,  ADB  will 
withhold  processing  of  requests  for  new  contract  awards  and  disbursement  such  as  new  replenishment  of 
advance accounts, processing of new reimbursement, and issuance of new commitment letters. ADB will (a) 
inform the executing agency of ADB’s actions; and (b) advise that the loan may be suspended if the audit 
documents are not received within the next 6 months. 
(iii)  When audited project financial statements are not received within 12 months after the due date, ADB may 
suspend the loan.

method and bidding procedure, as well as proposed advance procurement arrangements which 
were  based  on  a  strategic  procurement  planning  exercise  that  considered  strategic  project 
priorities, risks, and opportunities; operating conditions of the borrowers; as well as the market 
conditions (Appendix 8). Contract packaging of works, including hospital construction, reflects the 
most appropriate contract sizes, procurement method, and bidding procedure (4 packages with 
estimated  value  of  about  $93.84  million,  through  open  competitive  bidding  ([OCB]  nationally 
advertised), which are in line with strategic priorities of the executing agency to meet the different 
demands,  locations,  and  construction  timing/schedule  of  various  implementing  agencies.  The 
market assessment confirms that these works are common in the PRC and the market is highly 
competitive  with  sufficient  number  of  contractors  with  general  contractor  licenses.  Goods 
contracts  include  medical  equipment  for  the  hospital.  The  market  for  the  equipment  is  very 
competitive with sufficient suppliers. One package (OCB internationally advertised, with four lots) 
with estimated value of about $32.68 million and 4 packages (OCB nationally advertised) with 
estimated  value  of  about  $19.88  million  are  designed  considering  the  types  of  equipment  and 
delivery  timing/schedule.  ADB  standard  bidding  documents  will  be  used  for  goods  and  works. 
Consulting services include support for institutional and system strengthening, capacity building, 
and  various  project  management  activities  (14  packages,  with  estimated  value  of  about 
$7.20 million, using quality- and cost-based selection for 2 packages, consultants’ qualifications 
selection  for  8  packages,  and  individual  consultant  selection  for  4  packages).  The  market 
assessment confirms that there are enough international and national consulting firms available 
in the PRC. Thus, OCB (internationally advertised) will be used for 1 consulting package and OCB 
(nationally  advertised)  will  be  used  for  the  remaining  11  packages.  ADB  standard  request  for 
proposal will be used for consulting services. 
B. 
Project Procurement Risk Assessment 
69. 
A project procurement risk assessment was conducted in accordance with the Guide on 
Assessing Procurement Risks and Determining Project Procurement Classification and Guidance 
Note on Procurement Risk Framework.35 Overall, the project procurement risk is medium. 
C. 
Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing 
70. 
All advance contracting and retroactive financing will be undertaken in conformity the ADB 
Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and Procurement Regulations for ADB 
Borrowers  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). 36  The  borrower,  HMG,  HPMO,  and 
implementing agencies have been advised that approval of advance contracting and retroactive 
financing does not commit ADB to finance the project. 
Advance  contracting.  Advance  contracting  will  include  recruitment  of  start-up  support

46 
request for proposals, and the whole recruitment process under advance procurement action will 
be subject to ADB prior approval. For the works procurement, the issuance of invitations to bid 
under advance procurement action will be subject to ADB approval. 
Retroactive  financing.  Under  retroactive  financing,  the  implementing  agencies  would 
72. 
implement  project  activities  using  their  own  funds.  The  government  was  informed  that  as  a 
general rule, retroactive financing is permitted only if (i) it is specifically agreed by ADB and the 
borrower; (ii) the goods, works, and consulting services for which it is requested are procured in 
accordance  with  ADB’s  Procurement  Policy  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and 
Procurement  Regulations  for  ADB  Borrowers  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time);  (iii)  the 
amount  to  be  retroactively  financed  does  not  exceed  20%  of  the  loan  amount;  (iv)  the 
expenditures must have been incurred before the effectiveness of the relevant loan but, generally, 
not earlier than 12 months before signing of the loan agreement; and (v) due diligence on the 
proposed  contracts 
financing  on  engineering, 
environmental, financial, social, and other safeguard requirements has been completed to satisfy 
project  preparation  requirements.  In  either  instance,  detailed  assessments  (due  diligence)  on 
each  retroactive  financing  proposal  must  demonstrate  that  (i)  the  expenditures  incurred  are 
genuine, reasonable, and material to get the project off the ground; and (ii) they were incurred for 
proper reasons, in a transparent manner over a reasonable period of time. 
for  advance  contracting  and  retroactive 
D. 
Procurement of Goods, Works, and Consulting Services 
73. 
All  procurement  of  goods  and  works  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB 
Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and Procurement Regulations for ADB 
Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time). Before the start of any procurement, ADB and 
the  executing  agency  will  review  the  public  procurement  laws  of  the  central  and  municipal 
governments to ensure consistency with the ADB’s procurement policy and regulations. 
Open competitive bidding (OCB) is the preferred method for procurement in this project. 
74. 
To  achieve  value  for  money,  it  is  important  to  seek  bids  from  qualified  bidders.  Based  on  the 
nature and value of contracts, bidders can be sought from the national market or international 
market. For works contracts, OCB (advertised nationally) method will be used unless the contract 
value  is  $40  million  and  above,  in  which  case OCB  (advertised  internationally)  method  will  be 
used. For goods contracts, OCB (advertised internationally) method will be used for contracts with 
$5 million and above, contracts involving highly specialized equipment, or contracts identified with 
limited competition. Otherwise, OCB (advertised nationally) method will be used. For consulting 
service contracts, both OCB (advertised internationally) and (advertised nationally) methods will 
be used, depending on the expertise’s availability within the PRC. 
75. 
If  a  bidding  attracts  foreign  companies,  the  bidding  document  will  be  written  in  English 
using the latest ADB standard bidding document for OCB (advertised internationally) packages, 
which can be downloaded from ADB website. If a bidding does not attract foreign companies, the 
following provisions will be applied: (i) an advertisement will be published on a national press, 
official gazette, or free, and publicly accessible website, as well as on the national e-procurement 
information and monitoring portal at the ADB special section of the China Tendering & Bidding 
Public Service Platform (http://www.cebpubservice.com); (ii) the PRC specific standard bidding 
documents (accepted by ADB, as updated in 2020) will be used unless otherwise agreed between 
the HMG and ADB; and (iii) documents for bidding and contract will only be in Chinese language 
(except for documents which require ADB’s review and approval), and the currencies for bidding 
and payment will be in Chinese yuan (CNY) unless otherwise agreed between the HMG and ADB. 
If  a  bidding  document  is  internationally  advertised,  regardless  of  ADB  prior  or  post  review 
47 
(sampling)  arrangements,  the  invitations  for  bids  need  to  be  submitted  to  ADB  latest  1  week 
before the advertisement for parallel advertisement in Business Opportunities of ADB’s website. 
Unless  otherwise  agreed  between  HMG  and  ADB  and  set  forth  in  the  procurement  plan, 
procurement under OCB will use the single-stage one-envelope procedure. 
76. 
ADB prior review applies to (i) the first OCB contract for works and the first OCB contract 
for goods for each PIU and HPMO; (ii) all packages with an estimated cost of $10 million or above; 
(iii) all contracts for advance contracting; and (iv) all consulting services contracts irrespective of 
the estimated value. All other contracts are subject to ADB’s post review (sampling) after contract 
signing.  The relevant sections of ADB’s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended  from time to 
time) will be included in all procurement documents and contracts. 
E. 
Procurement Plan 
77. 
An  18-month  procurement  plan  indicating  procurement  or  selection  methods,  estimated 
costs  of  contracts,  thresholds,  and  review  procedures  for  goods,  works,  and  consulting  service 
contract packages, has been prepared and presented in Appendix 4. The procurement plan shall 
be executed in the manner in which ADB has approved it. The procurement plan shall be updated 
annually or as needed throughout the duration of the project.

Environment 
VII. 
SAFEGUARDS 
The project is category A for environment. An environmental impact assessment (EIA), 
79. 
including  an  environmental  management  plan  (EMP),  was  prepared.  The  EIA  incorporated 
findings  of  the  domestic  feasibility  study  and  domestic  EIAs,  climate  risk  and  vulnerability 
assessment, biodiversity assessment, site visits, and consultations with stakeholders. The EIA 
identified potential direct, indirect, cumulative, and induced environmental impacts and risks for 
the  pre-construction,  construction,  and  operation  phases  of  the  project.  Avoidance  of  adverse 
effects  through  design  and  site  management  and  mitigation  measures  through  construction 
management are identified in the EMP. An assessment to determine the significance of project 
impacts  and  risks  due  to  land  degradation  and  soil  erosion,  surface  and  groundwater 
contamination from mine tailing and heavy metals, impacts on biodiversity and natural resources, 
and  impacts  due  to  inadequate  medical  infrastructure  has  been  conducted;  and  adequate 
measures to avoid, minimize, or mitigate potential impacts and risks have been included in the 
EMP. Mitigation measures identified in the EMP require environmental compliance for air, water, 
and noise pollution and management of hazardous wastes, including mine tailing wastes and bio-
medical  wastes.  Implementation  of  the  proposed  project  components  is  expected  to  generate 
positive environmental impacts for the Kedashan abandoned mining area. The climate change 
assessment identified extreme intense precipitation, flooding, and extremely high temperatures 
as  the  most  important  risks  affecting  the  project,  and  key  recommendations  have  been 
incorporated in the EMP. 
EMP includes a monitoring plan for internal monitoring by contractors during construction 
80. 
and  O&M  during  operation.  HPMO,  with  the  support  of  project  management  consultants,  will 
monitor the implementation of EMP and report to ADB semiannually. HPMO will also recruit an 
external  monitoring  entity  to  perform  evaluation  and  assessment  of  the  implementation  and 
compliance with the project EMP and report to ADB semiannually. Environmental management, 
capacity  development,  and  institutional  strengthening  activities  are  included  in  the  project  to 
mitigate  risks.  Two  rounds  of  meaningful  consultations  have  been  conducted  with  all  relevant 
stakeholders during project preparation, and the findings have been incorporated into the project 
design. Any potential environmental complaints or disputes will be handled in accordance with 
the grievance redress mechanism (GRM) established for the project. The EIA concluded that the 
anticipated environmental impacts and risks can be mitigated to acceptable levels by adherence 
to prescribed training and capacity building measures and effective implementation of the EMP. 
The  draft  EIA  and  EMP  comply  with  the  PRC’s  environmental  laws  and  World  Bank’s 
environmental  health  and  safety  guidelines  and  are  in  accordance  with  the  ADB’s  Safeguard 
Policy Statement (2009) (SPS). The draft EIA and EMP were disclosed on the ADB website on 
15 July 2021. 
81. 
The  project  is  classified  as  medium  climate  risk,  and  the  climate  risk  and  vulnerability 
assessment  conducted  found  extremely  intense  precipitation,  flood,  and  extremely  high 
temperature  affecting  project  design,  construction,  maintenance,  and  performance.  Extremely 
intense  precipitation  and  flood  can  damage  operational  functional  buildings  or  jeopardize  the 
operation of the tailing landfill. These events can disturb regular O&M in case the project sites 
have access difficulties. Citizens accommodated in PIHECC and PWH are highly vulnerable to 
extreme climate events. Suitable measures will be incorporated in project design (all structures 
will  be  constructed  to  a  flood  protection  standard  of  once  in  50  years,  and  the  landfills  will  be 
covered  and  sealed  off  with  high  strength  rainproof  materials)  to  mitigate  impacts  of  climate 
change. Emergency reaction plans will be developed and made available in these project activity 
49 
areas during project implementation. 
82. 
The  EIA  will  be  updated  as  required  during  the  detailed  design  stage  to  include 
(i) additional  baseline  data  collected  by  investigation  of  surface  water  and  groundwater  table, 
(ii) additional data gathered by sampling in different seasons and locations at suitable distance 
with  the  project  site,  (iii)  any  other  potential  chemical/hazard  which  may  pose  public  health 
concern, (iv) occupational health and safety risks including risks associated with the management 
of bio-medical waste and control of COVID-19 pandemic during construction and operation, and 
(v) assessment of land use plan for the site and landfill area after closure. 
83. 
In the design stage, the HPMO will coordinate between the design institute and the EIA 
institute to incorporate the EMP mitigation measures into the detailed engineering designs with 
allocated environmental mitigation budgets. The EMP includes a comprehensive monitoring plan 
which  covers  both  internal  monitoring  (by  contractors  during  construction  and  operation)  and 
external monitoring. An External Environment Monitoring Consultant will be engaged by HPMO. 
The EMP will be part of the bidding documents when procuring all works packages. To ensure 
that  bidders  respond  to  the  EMP  provisions,  the  HPMO  and  the  implementing  agencies  will 
prepare  and  provide  the  following  specification  clauses  for  incorporation  into  the  bidding 
documents:  (i)  budget  for  EMP  implementation  in  the  bidders’  proposals;  (ii)  environmental 
clauses  for  contractual  terms  and  conditions;  and  (iii)  updated  project  EIA  and  EMP,  and  the 
domestic EIA reports. 
84. 
HMG and the implementing agencies will be responsible for ensuring that the project will 
be  designed,  constructed,  and  operated  in  accordance  with  (i)  the  domestic  environmental, 
health,  and  safety  laws,  regulations,  procedures,  and  guidelines;  (ii)  ADB’s  SPS;  and  (iii)  the 
project EIA and EMP. HMG has the final responsibility for the implementation and compliance 
with the EMP and, through HPMO, will submit semiannual environmental monitoring reports to 
ADB for review and disclosure on the ADB website. 
85. 
The  implementing  agencies  will  supervise  and  provide  guidance  to  the  contractors  to 
ensure that the EMP is effectively implemented. They will consolidate the contractor’s monthly 
environmental  monitoring  reports;  ensure  timely  disclosure  of  the  project  EIA  and/or  EMPs  in 
locations  and  forms  accessible  to  the  public;  and  take  corrective  actions  when  necessary,  to 
ensure there are no environmental impacts. Their capacity to implement the EMP, as well as the 
capacity  of  the  O&M  unit  to  manage  project  facilities,  will  be  strengthened  through  capacity 
building and training activities. 
ADB will review and disclose semiannual EMP monitoring reports on the ADB website in 
86. 
line with ADB’s Access to Information Policy (2018). 
Site-specific EMP (contractor's environmental management plan) based on the EMP will

be prepared prior to the commencement of works construction activities. The contract will specify 
the  contractor  to  report  monthly  on  the  implementation  of  the  contractor's  environmental 
management plan. 
88. 
The HMG shall make available, and cause the implementing agencies to make available, 
the  necessary  budgetary  and  human  resources  to  fully  implement  the  EMP.  If  there  are  any 
changes in project scope or unanticipated environmental and/or social risks and impacts that arise 
during construction, implementation or operation of the project that were not considered in the 
EIA  and  the  EMP,  the  HPMO  shall  promptly  inform  ADB.  The  HPMO  shall  (i)  assess  the 
50 
significance of any unanticipated impacts, (ii) evaluate the options available to address them, and 
(iii) prepare or update the EIA and EMP to incorporate these impacts. 
89. 
Grievance redress mechanism. HPMO will establish a project-specific GRM prior to the 
commencement  of  civil  works  to  receive  and  manage  any  public  environmental  and/or  social 
issues that may arise due to the project. The environment and social officers in HPMO and PIUs 
will coordinate the GRM. Loan implementation support consultants will train all project agencies 
and staff on the GRM for taking an active role in supporting the GRM when necessary. GRM is 
described in detail in the EMP section of the EIA. 
90. 
Project Assurances. All ADB financed projects are required to comply with a standard 
set of loan assurances for environmental safeguards, which focus on compliance with national 
laws and the project EMP. In addition, the following project-specific assurances or action points 
and implementation mechanism are agreed between ADB and HMG. 
to  coordinate 
full-time  HPMO  staff 
(i)  HMG will ensure that HPMO and the implementing agencies (a) appoint at least one 
the 
qualified  environment  officer  as 
implementation of the EMP; (b) in each of the two PIUs, appoint at least one qualified 
environment officer as full-time PIU staff to coordinate the daily implementation of 
the  EMP  at  the  county  and  district  level;  (c)  recruit  a  loan  implementation 
environmental  consultant  (LIEC)  to  support  HPMO  and  PIUs  in  the  EMP 
implementation; (d) ensure that either HPMO or PIUs have entered into contracts 
with  at  least  one  independent  and  appropriately  qualified  environment  monitoring 
agency  (EMA).  This  agency  will  implement  the  external  environment  monitoring 
described  in  the  EMP;  and  (e)  ensure  that  HPMO  or  PIU  contract  with  the  EMA 
requires  the  agency  to  report  their  monitoring  results  to  HPMO,  PIUs,  the  local 
ecology and environment bureaus, and ADB at the same time. 
(ii)   Before and during the implementation of project and project components, HMG shall 
cause  HPMO  and  PIUs  to  organize  and  conduct  training  on  implementation  and 
supervision  of  the  EMP  for  HPMO,  implementing  agencies  and  their  PIUs, 
construction  supervision  companies,  and  contractors,  and  shall  ensure  that  the 
appropriate staff and officers receive such training. 
(iii)  HMG will ensure that (i) sustainable financial support for operation and maintenance 
of  all  project  facilities  will  be  provided  after  construction,  including  the  leachate 
transportation and treatment of the contaminated soil and landfill, operation of the 
constructed wetland, and monitoring after the construction completion; (ii) qualified 
operation and maintenance personnel will be assigned to manage all facilities during 
the  project  implementation  and  thereafter;  and  (iii)  periodical  inspection  on  the 
performance  the  facilities  will  be  conducted  to  identify  and  promptly  resolve  any 
operational issues. 
(iv)  For the associated facilities, the project will be involved with, i.e., Hezhou Medical 
Wastes  Disposal  Center,  Hezhou  Solid  Wastes  Incineration  Power  Plant,  Pinggui 
District  Wastewater  Treatment  Plant  (WWTP),  the  industrial  WWTP  in  Wanggao 
Industrial  Park,  the  Medical  Wastewater  Treatment  Station  of  Xiwan  Community 
Clinic,  as  well  as  the  two  reservoirs  of  Shalongchong  and  Hongshuiping  at 
downstream of Kedashan site. HMG shall ensure that such facilities shall continue 
to  be  maintained  in  accordance  with  domestic  requirements  for  environmental 
management,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  environmental  safety  measures, 
51 
environmentally  friendly  treatment  of  domestic  and  medical  wastes,  treated 
wastewater  discharge  approvals,  and  worker  and  community  health  and  safety. 
HMG shall immediately advise ADB if any changes are made to such facilities that 
adversely impact their capacity or function and affect the viability of the project. In 
such an event, HMG and ADB shall agree on any necessary corrective actions. 
(v)      In  the  preliminary  design  stage,  HMG  and  HMIGC  must  monitor  the  quality  of 
“stabilized  contaminated  slag/soil  after  treatment”  and  confirm  that  it  meets  the 
"Pollutant Control Standard for the Storage and Disposal of General Industrial Solid 
Waste (GB18599-2001)” before the design and construction of the specific landfill 
and its facilities of Kedashan subproject. If it fails to meet the standards of GB18599-
2001, it will be disposed of as hazardous solid waste according to the PRC's related 
standards and regulations. 
(vi)  During operation of the contaminated soil/slag landfill and the constructed wetlands 
of Kedashan subproject, HMG shall ensure that (a) new staff are not permitted to 
begin work until they have completed training of environmentally friendly and safe 
operation  skills  of  the  landfill,  leachate  disposal  and  other  built  facilities; 
(b) emergency  response  procedures  to  handling  water  pollution  accidents  are 
reviewed at least annually and updated as needed, (c) in the event that nearby and 
downstream  surface  water  and  groundwater  pollution  are  detected,  HMG  will 
immediately  require  the  ecology  and  environment  bureaus  and  other  government 
agencies to take effective measures to deal with the pollution accident. 
(vii)  During the operation, HMG and HMIGC will ensure that leachate from the landfills of 
Kedashan subproject shall be regularly transported (once every three days at most) 
to  the  industrial  WWTP  of  Wanggao  Industrial  Park  to  prevent  the  leachate  from 
contaminating the soil and downstream surface water and groundwater. 
(viii)  Prior  to  the commencement  of  the  Works,  HMG  will  and will  cause  HPMO  or  the 
implementing  agencies  to  select  and  contract  qualified  and  competent  external 
environmental monitoring agency to monitor the surface water and groundwater near 
and  downstream  of  the  landfill  site  based  on  the  sampling  locations  monitoring 
parameters and frequency specified in the EMP, the monitoring parameters include, 
but not limited to heavy metals and arsenic. 
(ix)  HMG will and will cause the implementing agencies and PIUs to ensure that (i) any 
existing public services, including drinking water supply, wastewater treatment, solid 
waste  collection,  and  power  supply,  will  continue  to  be  provided  to  communities 
during the civil works for the Pinggui subproject; (ii) any interruptions to such services 
are as limited as possible; and (iii) prior to any such interruptions, consultations are 
held with all affected communities and public. 
B. 
Involuntary Resettlement 
91. 
The project is category B for involuntary resettlement safeguards. Kedashan subproject 
will cover an area of 487.53 mu collectively owned by Baisha Community and Chaqing Village 
not contracted by individual households.37 These lands will be available through a land use rights 
transfer  (LURT)  agreement  between  the  Baisha  Community  and  HMIGC  during  the  project 
37 A mu is a Chinese unit of measurement (1 mu = 666.67 square meters). 
52 
implementation period of 6 years. HMIGC prepared a LURT framework to guide the preparation 
of LURT plans and finalization of agreements during project implementation. Pinggui subproject 
will  occupy  128.84  mu  of  land  with  93  affected  households  and  trigger  the  demolition  of 
11,532.7 square meters of houses or structures with 28 affected households. PDG initiated the 
land acquisition activities for the identified sites in accordance with the 2011 urban development 
plan  of  Pinggui  District  (formulated  in  2011  by  Hezhou  Construction  Bureau),  and  not  in 
anticipation  of  ADB  funding  of  Pinggui  subproject.  ADB  involuntary  resettlement  safeguard 
requirements are triggered due to the ongoing land acquisition and house demolition activities. 
As of March 2021, 94.6 mu of land has been acquired, with 69 households compensated, and 
7,425.8  square  meters  of  houses  or  structures  have  been  demolished,  with  17  households 
relocated. The land acquisition and resettlement of the remaining 27 mu land with 36 households 
including  17  households  with  house  demolition  impacts  is  expected  to  be  completed  by 
31 December 2021. Involuntary resettlement impacts have been assessed significant for a total 
of  98  affected  persons  in  the  17  households  with  house  demolition  impacts.  PDG  prepared  a 
resettlement due diligence report (DDR) for prior and ongoing land acquisition and resettlement, 
including  policy  gap  analysis  between  SPS  2009  and  PRC  regulations.  The  resettlement  due 
diligence  report  confirms  that  the  land  acquisition  process  and  resettlement  activities  are 
consistent with ADB’s SPS and PRC requirements; includes the key elements of a resettlement 
plan;  and  implementation  of  the  resettlement  activities  for  the  remaining  households  will  be 
monitored as part of internal and external monitoring. 
92. 
A GRM for Pinggui subproject has been functional since 2019 and will continue during the 
implementation  of  the  remaining  land  acquisition.  A  GRM  for  Kedashan  subproject  has  been 
established by HPMO to address grievances related to implementation of the LURT plan. 
93.  While the HMIGC, PDG, and the implementing agencies have the capacity to implement 
involuntary  resettlement  requirements  consistent  with  ADB  safeguard  requirements,  their 
capacity  will  be  strengthened  to  implement  the  resettlement  safeguards  and  conduct  internal 
monitoring. During program implementation, HPMO will (i) prepare the LURT plan based on the 
detailed measurement survey and submit for ADB endorsement prior to contract award of civil 
works;  (ii) make  available  the  budget  for  resettlement  implementation  on  a  timely  basis, 
(iii) conduct internal resettlement monitoring and reporting; and (iv) engage an external monitor 
to  monitor  and  evaluate  the  implementation  of  the  LURT  plan,  actions  identified  in  the 
resettlement  DDR  and  submit  semiannual  reports  to  ADB  for  uploading  on  ADB  website.  The 
HPMO shall ensure that (i) all affected persons are given adequate opportunity to participate in 
resettlement planning, updating, and implementation; (ii) counterpart funds for LAR activities are 
provided according to the budget and project schedule; (iii) any additional costs in excess of the 
resettlement planning budget estimates are met within the project schedule; (iv) land acquisition 
activities are implemented in accordance with applicable government laws and regulations and 
ADB’s SPS; in case of any inconsistency between government laws and ADB’s policy, the latter 
shall  prevail;  (v)  HPMO  and  the  implementing  agencies  shall  designate  adequate  staff  and 
resources to supervise and monitor implementation of the resettlement DDR and LURT plan and 
submit semiannual internal monitoring reports to ADB; and (vi) an external monitor acceptable to 
ADB  is  engaged  to  monitor  progress  and  evaluate  results  of  resettlement  implementation  and 
submits semiannual external monitoring reports simultaneously to HPMO and ADB. The HPMO 
shall  not  award  any  works  contract  which  involves  involuntary  resettlement  impacts  until  a 
resettlement  monitoring  report  by  the  external  monitor  is  submitted  to  ADB  confirming  that  all 
affected households are compensated for land acquisition and house demolition impacts and a 
livelihood restoration plan is agreed with the affected households for the Pinggui subproject and 
a  LURT  plan  is  prepared  for  the  Kedashan  subproject  based  on  the  detailed  measurement 
surveys and obtained ADB’s clearance of such plans. 
53 
The implementing agencies shall not hand over a specific section of land to the civil works 
94. 
contractor until (i) affected people who were compensated for that specific section have vacated 
the site, and (ii) the specific section of the subproject is free from any encumbrances. 
C. 
Indigenous Peoples 
95. 
The project is category B for the project impacts on indigenous peoples (ethnic minorities). 
Yao and Zhuang are the two main ethnic minority groups in the project areas. The project will 
directly  benefit  about  63,333  ethnic  minority  persons  directly  by  (i)  improved  environment, 
(ii) increased  employment  opportunities,  (iii)  improved  health-  and  elderly-care  facilities  and 
services, and (iv) enhanced employment competitiveness through improved technical and skills 
training.38 HMG prepared an ethnic minority development plan (EMDP) to ensure that (i) at least 
20%  of  ethnic  minority  persons  will  participate  through  consultations  in  project  design  and 
implementation activities, (ii) at least 20% of jobs in the project construction and operation phases 
are allocated to ethnic minorities, (iii) at least 80% of ethnic minority persons in the project area 
will receive environment awareness and knowledge, and (iv) campaigns on health and elderly 
care will reach all ethnic minority households. The EMDP has been disclosed to ethnic minorities 
in the project areas in local languages and on the ADB website on 29 July 2021. A GRM will be 
established.  HPMO  and  PIUs  have  assigned  staff  in  charge  of  EMDP  implementation  and 
monitoring, and project management support consultants will assist them. 
96. 
Prohibited  investment  activities.  Pursuant  to  ADB’s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement 
(2009),  ADB  funds  may  not  be  applied  to  the  activities  described  on  the  ADB  Prohibited 
Investment Activities List set forth at Appendix 5 of the Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). 
38 The data for ethnic minorities are for 2020, provided by each township government. 
54 
VIII.   GENDER AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS 
Gender. The project is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming.39 Women in the 
97. 
project area have limited educational, employment, and income-earning opportunities compared 
with men because women are engaged in a variety of household responsibilities. They look after 
the children and elderly and engage in household chores. In addition to such household activities, 
they work at local farms as temporary hands, and few of them engage in local non-farm work to 
earn wages. About 67,000 men and 39,000 women go out of Pinggui as migrants leaving behind 
about 25,000 women and 4,000 men in Pinggui. The proportion of women to men who are left-
behind is 6:1. In the project areas, women urgently require skills training in fields such as medical, 
elderly  care,  and  e-commerce  where  they  could  find  employment.  Women,  in  general,  need 
knowledge on ways to prevent chronic and common gynecological diseases and improve their 
health. The project will open opportunities for women to participate in the labor market and earn 
decent wages, and to improve their well-being through informational programs that would improve 
their knowledge and networks. 
Poverty and social. The project is classified as general intervention for poverty reduction. 
98. 
A poverty and social analysis was undertaken based on the results of the online and field surveys, 
consultations with project stakeholders, including project-affected persons and representatives of 
government agencies at the city, district, township, and village levels, Persons with Disabilities 
Association, and the Women’s Federation. A total of 482,000 persons resides in the project area. 
They  include  low-income  persons  (20%),  women  (47.6%),  PWDs  (6.6%),  elders  (9.5%),  and 
ethnic minorities (13.3%). They will directly benefit from the project through (i) integrated medical 
resources at district, township, and village levels with improved service quality under strengthened 
institutional  mechanism;  (ii)  significant  increase  in  the  access  to  hospitalized  treatment  from 
current  32%  to  70%  in  Pinggui,  reducing  in-patients’  medical  expenses  by  about  50%; 
(iii) rescuing 15,000 persons from impoverishment by liberating laborers from out-migration and 
unemployed and under-employed by providing targeted skills training programs, specifically for 
women. It is estimated that about 1,095 jobs will be created during the construction and operation 
phases of the project. In addition, 350,000 persons who depend on the He River for their drinking 
water  and  irrigation  water  requirements,  and  patients  from  neighboring  counties  will  indirectly 
benefit from the project. 
99. 
Social  and  gender  action  plan.  A  social  and  gender  action  plan  (SGAP)  has  been 
prepared with specific targets for women, low-income people, and PWDs, and requirements for 
inclusive  design  and  O&M  of  the  project  facilities  (Table  25).  On  gender  aspects,  the  SGAP 
includes (i) consultations on project facilities’ design and O&M to reflect the facilities’ usability and 
comfort for female staff and visitors; (ii) promotion of green and health care-related skills training 
for  women  by  setting  quotas;  (iii)  annual  skills  training  needs  assessment  by  gender;  and 
(iv) quotas  for  job  opportunities  created  by  the  project.  Key  gender  targets  have  also  been 
included in the DMF (Table 26). HPMO will engage a social and gender development specialist 
to  assist  the  implementation  of  the  SGAP.  HPMO  will  report  semiannually  on  the  SGAP 
implementation progress to ADB, and an independent external monitor will verify the monitoring 
reports. A consultation and participation plan for project implementation is included in Section IX.

B. 
Monitoring 
101.  Project performance monitoring. To monitor the progress of the project in achieving the 
planned outcome and outputs, HPMO will establish a project performance management system 
(PPMS) before the project’s physical activities start (soon after the PMISC is mobilized, by Q3 
2022)  and  will  maintain  it  accordingly.  PPMS  design  should  reflect  the  requirements  of  ADB’s 
project  performance  reporting  system  and  gender  monitoring  system. 40 The  basis  for  project 
performance monitoring and reporting will be the DMF, which identifies performance targets for 
the outcomes and outputs of the project. It will be designed to permit adequate flexibility to adopt 
remedial  action  regarding  project  design,  schedules,  activities,  and  development  impacts.  The 
PPMS  will  cover  the  following  aspects  of  the  project  implementation:  (i)  physical  and  financial 
progress;  (ii)  progress  and  results  of  institutional  strengthening  and  capacity  development; 
(iii) updating and implementation of the resettlement DDR and LURT plan; (iv) implementation of 
the EMP; (v) implementation of EMDP; (vi) implementation of SGAP; and (vii) ensuring project 
compliance with loan covenants (policy, financial, economic, sector, and others). 
102.  HPMO  agreed  and  confirmed  that  the  targets  are  achievable,  and  they will  (i)  recruit  a 
start-up project management consultant using advance action to help establish the PPMS before 
loan  effectiveness;  and  (ii)  develop  recording,  monitoring,  and  reporting  arrangements.  With 
inputs  from  PIUs  and  other  stakeholders,  HPMO,  with  support  from  the  PMISC,  will  prepare 
quarterly  project  progress  reports.  Disaggregated  baseline  data  for  outputs  and  outcome 
indicators  gathered  during  project  preparation  will  be  updated  and  reported  in  the  quarterly 
progress  reports  and  after  each  ADB  review  mission.  At  the  start  of  project  implementation, 
HPMO, PIUs, and ADB will develop and agree with integrated PPMS procedures to generate data 
systematically  on  the  inputs  and  outputs,  as  well  as  the  indicators  to  be  used  to  measure  the 
project’s impact and outcome considering the project scope. 
103.  Compliance  monitoring.  During  project  implementation,  ADB  and  HPMO  will  closely 
monitor the compliance of all the covenants under the project and will take necessary remedial 
actions for any noncompliance. The compliance status will be reported in the HPMO’s quarterly 
progress reports and will be reviewed during project review missions, including the following: 
(i)  Legal covenants. HMG shall ensure that in the event of (i) any change in ownership 
or control of the project facilities; or (ii) any sale, transfer, or assignment of the shares 
of  PIUs  is  anticipated,  HMG  will  consult  with  ADB  at  least  6  months  prior  to  the 
implementation of such change. HMG shall cause PIUs to further ensure that such 
changes are carried out in a lawful and transparent manner. 
(ii)  Counterpart funding. HMG shall provide the details of the sources of the counterpart 
funding as well as provide corresponding commitment letters. The total cost includes 
physical and price contingencies and interest during construction. 
40   ADB's project performance reporting system is available at  
  http://www.adb.org/Documents/Slideshows/PPMS/default.asp?p=evaltool 
65 
(iii)  Financial  management.  HMG  shall  establish  and  maintain  sound  financial 
management  systems  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  guidelines  on  the  financial 
management and analysis of projects, including the establishment of separate project 
accounts and the maintenance of minimum balances to ensure smooth cash flow and 
the timely settlement of project construction liabilities and future debt servicing.41 
(iv)  Governance and anticorruption. ADB explained ADB’s Anticorruption Policy (1998, 
as amended to date) and discussed with the HMG, HPMO, implementing agencies, 
and PIUs.42 Specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described 
in Section X. 
(v)  Technical  aspects.  After  the  completion  of  the  construction  and  operation  of  the 
building  information  management  system  installation,  implementing  agencies  will 
request  the  smart  building  system  contractors  to  provide  5  years  maintenance 
warranty for their system. Implementing agencies (project owners), HPMO, and ADB 
can access the smart building system's real-time data. The summary of information 
on  building environmental  performance  will  be reported  in  the  quarterly  monitoring 
report. 
104.  Safeguards  monitoring  (environment).  HPMO  will  prepare  and  submit  semiannual 
HPMO’s  internal  environmental  monitoring  reports  (IEMRs)  (template  attached  in  the  EMP)  to 
ADB within 15 days of the end of each period covered. The first IEMR will cover the first 6 months 
from the date of loan effectiveness. In case of advance actions and works commencement prior 
to loan effectiveness, HPMO will include safeguards management and compliance report for that 
period  in  the  first  IEMR  (IEMR-01).  The  IEMR  will  include  a  review  of  progress  made  on  the 
implementation of the EMP, any grievances or problems encountered, and remedial measures 
taken. Quarterly project progress reports will include a section on environmental aspects of the 
project. Subproject completion reports shall be finalized within 3 months after completion of each 
subproject. HPMO will engage an environment consultant as part of PMISC to support HPMO 
and PIUs on the internal monitoring and preparation of the reports. 
105.  HPMO  shall  employ  a  qualified  and  experienced  external  environment  monitoring 
consultant (EEMC) for environmental monitoring using loan proceeds. The external environment 
monitor shall monitor project on a semiannual basis until a project completion report is issued. 
The EEMC will review and evaluate the IEMR, including review and analysis of project-related 
significant environmental impacts, progress of implementation of mitigation measures as outlined 
in the project EIA and EMP, participation in ongoing stakeholder consultations and evaluation and 
reporting on how environmental grievances, if any, are handled. The EEMC will submit to ADB 
an  external  environmental  monitoring  report  (EEMR)  semiannually  within  2  months  from  the 
respective IEMR submission for review and disclosure on the ADB website. 
106.  Safeguards monitoring (involuntary resettlement). HPMO, together with the PIUs, will 
monitor implementation of the actions identified in the resettlement DDR for Pinggui subproject 
and the LURT plan for Kedashan subproject and submit semiannual internal land acquisition and 
resettlement monitoring reports to ADB. HPMO will regularly report the implementation progress 
by summarizing the land acquisition and resettlement progress in the quarterly project progress 
reports. HPMO will engage a resettlement consultant as part of PMISC to support HPMO and 
PIUs on the internal monitoring and preparation of the reports.

compliance monitoring of the implementation of the DDR actions and the LURT plan. The external 
resettlement  monitor  will  submit  semiannual  monitoring  reports  to  HPMO  and  ADB  during  the 
period  of  resettlement  safeguards  implementation.  After  1  year  of  the  completion  of 
implementation  of  the  DDR  actions  and  the  LURT  plan,  the  external  resettlement  monitor  will 
evaluate  the  implementation  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  provisions  in  the  project  and 
submit a resettlement completion report to HPMO and ADB. 
108.  Safeguards  monitoring  (indigenous  peoples).  HPMO  together  with  the  concerned 
PIUs will monitor the implementation of the EMDP and submit semiannual EMDP implementation 
monitoring reports to ADB. The PIUs will regularly report on the implementation  the EMDP  by 
summarizing  key  actions,  achievements,  and  delays  in  the  HPMO’s  quarterly  project  progress 
reports. HPMO  will engage a social  consultant as  a member of PMISC to support  HPMO and 
PIUs in internal monitoring and preparing of the monitoring reports. A monitoring methodology 
and the framework for developing a detailed plan for monitoring and evaluation is included in the 
EMDP.  The  PPMS  will  include  EMDP  monitoring  indicators  and  required  frequencies  of 
monitoring. 
109.  The HPMO will engage an external monitor to verify the results of monitoring of EMDP 
and SGAP implementation. The external monitor will submit semiannual monitoring reports to the 
HPMO and ADB during the project implementation period. 
110.  Gender  and  social  dimensions  monitoring.  The  DMF  and  SGAP  include  relevant 
targets  and  monitoring  indicators.  HPMO  and  social  consultants  of  PMISC  will  establish  a 
comprehensive  project  management  system  for  all  social  and  gender  aspects  of  the  project. 
During the project implementation phase, the results of monitoring of the SGAP’s implementation 
will  be  incorporated  in  the  PPMS  reports.  Data  and  information  sources  include  project 
management information system, social surveys, and research. The actions outlined in the SGAP 
will  be  monitored,  and  sex-disaggregated  data  on  project  activities  will  be  collected.  HPMO’s 
quarterly project progress report and the semiannual SGAP monitoring report will describe the 
progress of the implementation of the SGAP against the approved targets. The indicative format 
of HPMO’s SGAP monitoring report is in Appendix 6. It will be finalized and agreed upon between 
ADB  and  HPMO  at  the  project's  inception  mission.  Although  it  is  not  mandatory,  as  a  good 
practice, HPMO agreed to request the external EMDP monitor to verify the results of the SGAP 
implementation. 
C. 
Evaluation 
111. 
In addition to regular monitoring, ADB and HMG will jointly review project performance at 
least  twice  a  year.  The  review  will  assess  implementation  performance  and  achievement  of 
project outcomes and outputs, assess financial progress, identify issues and constraints affecting 
implementation, and work out a time-bound action plan for their resolution. ADB and HMG will 
undertake a midterm review to assess the implementation status and take appropriate measures 
if necessary—including a minor adjustment of the scope and implementation arrangements and 
reallocation of loan proceeds, as appropriate—to achieve the project impact and outcome. 
D. 
Reporting 
112.  HMG will provide ADB with (i) quarterly progress reports in a format consistent with ADB's 
report  on 
project  performance 
(a) environmental  safeguard  implementation,  (b)  resettlement  safeguards  implementation, 
(c) EMDP  implementation,  and  (d)  SGAP  implementation;  (iii)  consolidated  annual  reports 
internal  monitoring 
reporting  system; 
(ii)  semiannual 
67 
including  (a) progress  achieved  by  output  as  measured  through  the  indicator's  performance 
targets,  (b)  key  implementation  issues  and  solutions,  (c)  updated  procurement  plan,  and 
(d) updated implementation plan for the next 12 months; and (iv) a project completion report within 
6 months of physical completion of the project. To ensure that projects will continue to be both 
viable  and  sustainable, project  accounts,  audited  project  financial statements,  and  the  audited 
entity  financial  statements  together  with  the  associated  auditor's  report  should  be  adequately 
reviewed. A technical report will be prepared before review missions and midterm review mission 
should  any  change  in  scope  or  project  adjustment  need  to  be  discussed.  The  key  reporting 
requirement is listed in Table 27. The reporting timing is for HMG/HPMO to submit to ADB. If the 
reporting is supported by consultants, HMG/HPMO should require consultants to provide drafts 
in advance. HPMO will review and request improvement/updates to consultants if necessary, and 
submit the HPMO’s reviewed version to ADB on time. ADB will not accept the raw drafts from 
consultants  simply  forwarded  to  ADB,  which  are  not  reviewed  and  verified  by  the  HPMO. 
Therefore, the timing for consultants to submit the drafts to HPMO is set earlier than the HPMO’s 
submission date to ADB.

Stakeholder Communication Strategy 
113.  Project  information  will  be  communicated  through  public  consultation,  information 
disclosure mechanism in ADB’s and government’s websites, meetings, interviews, focus group 
discussions, and community consultation meetings, in accordance with ADB’s requirements of 
access  to  information. 43  The  main  stakeholders  are  the  different  agencies  of  the  PIUs, 
beneficiaries,  and  participants  in  the  project  implementation.  Stakeholder  communication, 
including  consultation,  participation,  and  information  disclosure,  is  part  of  the  EMDP,  EMP, 
resettlement DDR, LURT plan, and SGAP and will be monitored accordingly. 
114.  Consultation  and  participation  plan.  The  consultation  and  participation  plan  (CPP) 
provides both consultation activities as well as methods by which stakeholders could participate 
in  project  implementation.  The  purpose  of  the  CPP  is  to  further  consolidate  and  continue 
consultation and participation of stakeholders throughout the project implementation phase. The 
objectives of the CPP are to (i) provide a systematic basis for consultation of stakeholder groups 
and to create a platform for them to participate during project implementation, (ii) present time-
bound  activities,  and  (iii)  identify  institutions  and  people  responsible  for  the  implementation  of 
consultation and participation activities. The consultation and participation methods in the CPP, 
which were also used for the poverty and social analysis, include consultation meetings, focus 
group  discussions,  and  key  informant  interviews.  Independent  online  consultation  and 
43 Access to Information Policy: https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/institutional-document/450636/access-
information-policy.pdf. 
69 
participation platforms will be established to further accomplish consultation and participation. The 
consultation  and  participation  activities  will  be  focused  on  project  outputs,  and  the  content, 
purpose,  and  type  of  stakeholders  to  consult  with  will  be  output-specific.  The  details  of  the 
proposed consultation and participation activities are presented in Table 28. 
115.  HPMO, on behalf of HMG, will take the overall responsibility for the implementation of the 
CPP, while respective implementing agencies will lead the consultation and participation activities 
for  Kedashan  and  Pinggui  subprojects.  To  effectively  implement  consultation  and  participation 
activities,  HPMO  will  assign  a  social  officer  who  will lead  the  project  level  implementation  and 
documentation of CPP, as well as the implementation and reporting of EMDP and SGAP. Each 
PIU  will  assign  a  social  (and  environmental)  focal  staff  before  the  commencement  of  project 
implementation. These focal staff will assist the social officer in implementing the CPP and will 
lead and document the consultation and participation activities for his/her subproject. 
116.  The project will engage social, gender, indigenous people specialists under the PMISC. 
These specialists will provide necessary advice to and training of the social officer and focal staff 
on  implementation  and  documentation  of  CPP.  The  project  and  subprojects  will  establish  and 
maintain a GRM as an integral part of the EMP, EMDP, LURT plan, and resettlement DDR. Any 
grievances or complaints that are raised during consultation and participation will be coordinated 
through the GRM process. The aggrieved persons will be informed of decisions through the GRM 
mechanism.  HPMO  and  PIUs  will  document  the  results  of  all  consultation  and  participation 
activities. Extracts from the documentations will provide inputs to the project progress reports or 
internal monitoring reports.

117.  Environment. In accordance with ADB’s SPS, public consultations were held as part of 
the EIA preparation. Consultations were undertaken with project beneficiaries, local and municipal 
government officials, community leaders, civil societies, stakeholders in the project areas, and 
people likely to be affected due to project implementation. Specific attention was given to women 
and disadvantaged groups, including vulnerable communities, during the consultations. Topics of 
discussion included various issues affecting these stakeholders and appropriate responses that 
would  result  in  the  incorporation  of  beneficial  environmental  and  social  measures.  Information 
disclosure and public consultation relating to environmental safeguards will continue throughout 
project implementation through questionnaire surveys and interviews by the safeguards unit of 
the  HPMO  and  the  external  environmental  monitoring  consultant.  The  project’s  environmental 
information will be disclosed by the local Environmental Protection Bureau and ADB as follows: 
(i) 
The  project  EIA  has  been  disclosed  on  the  project  website  at  www.adb.org  on 
15 July 2021. 
71 
(ii)  The EIAs in Chinese were disclosed on the website of the relevant environmental 
protection bureaus; all external environmental monitoring reports during the project 
implementation will be available at www.adb.org. 
(iii)  The domestic environmental impact registration form will be available on the HMG’s 
registration portal. 
(iv)  The project information and GRM entry points will be disclosed on the information 
board of each construction site.

people,  communities,  and  other  relevant  stakeholders  during  the  project  preparation  and  will 
continue during the implementation of the actions identified in the resettlement DDR for Pinggui 
subproject  and  LURT  plan  for  Kedashan  subproject.  Resettlement  information  booklets  have 
been  prepared  and  distributed  to  the  affected  households  during  project  preparation,  and  the 
resettlement DDR and LURT framework have been uploaded to ADB's website on 29 July 2021. 
Disclosure will continue to be carried out during the resettlement implementation. 
Indigenous  Peoples.  Series  of  consultations  with  ethnic  minorities  were  carried  out 
119. 
through public meetings, focus group discussions, online surveys and will continue throughout 
project  implementation.  Key  activities  include  but  not  limited  to  timely  disclosure  of  project 
information,  consultation  meetings,  and  conduct  of  awareness  training  will  be  carried  out  in  a 
locally acceptable manner, eliciting feedback from ethnic minority communities so they continue 
to participate during final design, implementation, and monitoring; culture, customs and traditions 
of ethnic minorities are taken into consideration during planning and implementation of trainings 
and provision of access to job opportunities. 
including 
teachers,  students,  migrant  workers, 
120.  Social and gender. During the project preparation, participation and consultations with 
stakeholders 
technicians,  entrepreneurs, 
implementing agencies, and relevant government officials will be conducted mainly through focus 
group discussions and key informant interviews. Project documents incorporate comments and 
suggestions received during social surveys and consultations. Further consultation activities will 
be conducted during project implementation. SGAP includes measures for participation of women 
in such activities and the presentation of sex-disaggregated data in monitoring reports. 
121.  Public disclosure. ADB and HMG will disclose relevant project information to the public 
and  interested  parties.  The  information  disclosure  measures  for  different  stakeholders  are

X. 
ANTICORRUPTION POLICY 
122.  Although  strict  laws  against  corruption  are  in  place  in  the  PRC,  there  are  still  some 
challenges  in  implementation.  Corruption  is  being  handled  mostly  by  the  Communist  Party  of 
China  disciplinary  organs  with  only  a  few  cases  submitted  to  the  stage  judicial  organs  for 
prosecution. The HMG and the implementing agencies have committed to being active to detect 
acts of corruption or corruption-related activities such as money laundering. This will be aided by 
the  enhancement  of  government  interagency  cooperation  between  stakeholder  agencies, 
including financial, procurement, and audit. Integrity due diligence was conducted on HMIGC and 
PUCIC, the members of their Board of Directors and management, as applicable.44 Based on the 
information available as of July 2021, they do not appear to constitute a significant or potentially 
significant integrity risk since no unresolved or other relevant information related to them exits. 
ADB has obtained reasonable assurance that HMIGC and PUCIC were not established and is 
not  being  used  for  money  laundering  or  terrorism  financing  in  the  project  jurisdiction.  ADB’s 
Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the PRC 
and GZAR governments, HMG, and implementing agencies. 
123.  ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any violations of the 
Anticorruption  Policy  relating  to  the  project. 45  All  contracts  financed  by  ADB  shall  include 
provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the 
executing agency and all project contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers. 
Individuals and/or entities on ADB’s anticorruption debarment list are ineligible to participate in 
ADB financed activity and may not be awarded any contracts under the project.46 
124.  To support these efforts, relevant provisions are included in the loan agreement and the 
bidding documents for the project. The project design and implementation arrangements provide 
for  mitigating  corruption  risks.  Risks  associated  with  project  management  will  be  mitigated  by 
(i) training of staff of the executing and implementing agencies’ and project implementation units 
on procurement of works, goods, and services under the project; and (ii) periodic inspection of 
contractors’ activities related to fund withdrawals and settlements by the executing agency’s staff.

ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISM 
125.  People who are, or may in the future be, adversely affected by the project may submit 
complaints  to  ADB’s  Accountability  Mechanism.  The  Accountability  Mechanism  provides  an 
independent forum and process whereby people adversely affected by ADB-assisted projects can 
voice,  and  seek  a  resolution  of  their  problems,  as  well  as  report  alleged  violations  of  ADB’s 
operational  policies  and  procedures.  Before  submitting  a  complaint  to  the  Accountability 
Mechanism, affected people should make an effort in good faith to solve their problems by working 
with  the  concerned  ADB  operations  department.  Only  after  doing  that,  and  if  they  are  still 
dissatisfied, should they approach the Accountability Mechanism.47

A.    Capacity and Capability Assessment of the Borrower 
Figure 1: Project Organization Structure 
1. 
Hezhou  Municipal  Government  (HMG)  is  the  executing  agency  (EA)  for  the  Project.  A 
municipal  level  Project  Leading  Group  (PLG)  has  been  established  to  provide  oversight  and 
coordination  among  government  agencies  and  guidance  to  the  project  preparation  and 
implementation.  Under  the  Project  Leading  Group,  the  Hezhou  project  management  office 
(HPMO)  has  been  established  to  carry  out  the  daily  operation  of  the  project  during  the  entire 
period  of  the  project  preparation  and  implementation.  The  HPMO  is  located  under  Hezhou 
Development and Reformation Committee (HDRC). 
2. 
There  are  two  project  implementing  agencies,  the  Guangxi  Hezhou  Mining  Investment 
Group  Corporation  Limited  (HMIGC)  and  Pinggui  District  Government  (PDG).  HMIGC  is  the 
Appendix 8  
141 
implementing agency and also the project implementation unit (PIU), and it will be responsible for 
the  preparation  and  implementation  of  the  Kedashan  subproject  (output  1).  The  relevant 
departments  in  HMIGC  are  responsible  for  the  engineering,  procurement  and  contract 
management, safeguards for environmental, social, land acquisition and resettlement, financial 
and accounting for the project preparation and implementation in accordance with government 
and ADB policies and procedures requirements. 
3. 
PDG is responsible for preparing and implementing the Pinggui subproject (outputs 2 and 
3). A Pinggui PMO has been established to carry out the daily operation of the Pinggui subproject. 
The Pinggui PMO is located under Pinggui Development and Reformation Bureau (PDRB). The 
Hezhou Pinggui Urban Construction Investment Company Limited (PUCIC) will be the PIU for the 
PDG.  The  relevant  units  in  PUCIC  are  working  as  PIU  to  be  responsible  for  the  engineering, 
procurement  and  contract  management,  safeguards  for  environmental,  social,  land  acquisition 
and resettlement, financial and accounting according to the policies and procedures from both 
domestic government authorities and ADB. 
From the procurement aspect, HPMO will only be responsible for the procurement and 
4. 
management  of  project  management  and  implementation  support  consultant  (PMISC), 
construction  supervision  company,  external  monitoring  agencies  for  safeguards,  etc.  under 
project management activities. Two PIUs are responsible for the procurement and management 
of all works, goods, and consulting contracts under its subprojects. 
5. 
There will be some consulting contracts under both Kedashan and Pinggui subprojects. 
Those  consultants  will  be  procured  and  managed  by  HMIGC  and  PUCIC,  respectively. 
Meanwhile,  at  Hezhou  Municipal  level,  a  working  group  will  be  established  with  all  related 
departments such as Hezhou Natural Resource Bureau, Hezhou Healthcare Commission, etc., 
to be responsible for the overall quality control, outcomes review, and application of consulting 
results and recommendations into policy or practical guidance. The working group established at 
Hezhou Municipal level can provide an effective guarantee to the successful implementation and 
promotion of researches. 
A SWOT analysis has been carried out to assess the current capacity of the EA, HPMO, 
6. 
and IAs. 
Table 1: SWOT Analysis 
Strengths 
Weaknesses 
•  Both the Tendering and Bidding Law (TBL) and 
the Government Procurement Law (GPL) are 
available. 
•  Standard national competitive bidding 
documents for works and goods issued by the 
Ministry of Finance in 2015 are in place and 
can be applied for the procurement activities of 
the project. 
•  The EA and PMO has conducted several IFI 
financed projects including several ADB 
financed projects. PMO staffs have received 
trainings on IFI’s procurement policies already. 
•  PMO is the only designated department to be 
•  There is no comprehensive training program 
available by executing and implementing 
agencies of projects for procurement 
accreditation or professionalization in the PRC. 
•  Although training has been received, the EA 
and HPMO have weak procurement capacity in 
implementing ADB project. 
•  There is a shortage of staff in PMO and sub-
PMO. 
•  Based on the ongoing WB financed project, it 
takes more than a year for PMO to recruit 
individual project specialists on procurement 
and project management.

responsible for IFI loan projects, thus they have 
risk experience on project management and 
how to working with IFI staffs. 
•  PMO’s capacity to administer procurement to 
multiple IFI financed project at the same time in 
a timely manner remains limited. 
•  PMO are located under the HDRC, it is easier 
•  Two IAs (PIUs) has no experience on IFI 
financed project. 
•  Local PMO staffs and PIU staffs have limited 
skills or proficiency in the English language. 
•  PMO does not have staff with professional 
background in green procurement. 
•  Lack of technical skills at hospital to prepare 
technical specifications, resulting in delays, 
inefficiency, and ineffectiveness of 
procurement activities. 
•  Lack of staff can fully understand health and 
medical related concepts at this moment. 
for them to work and cooperate other 
departments. 
•  IAs (PIUs) has multiple experience on project 
management and implementations, especially 
for mineral treatment and infrastructure 
construction projects. 
•  The IAs (PIUs) has rich experience in 
procurement in accordance with the domestic 
procurement law and procedure. 
•  Low risk on corruptions because of the mature 
anticorruption system in the PRC. 
•  Experienced procurement agency has been 
recruited for other IFI financed project, which 
can transfer some knowledge to PMO staffs. 
•  Based on the experience of ongoing WB 
financed project, the PMO has access to many 
consultants and construction companies. 
•  Complaint management mechanism is in place, 
which addresses grievances related to 
procurements and contract administration; 
•  PPMOs have appointed in staffs with different 
professional experience from different sectors 
related to subprojects under the project. 
Opportunities 
Threats 
•  ADB will provide relevant procurement staff 
with guidance and instructions on ADB’s 
procurement and consultant recruitment 
procedures. 
•  The HPMO have four IFI financed projects 
undergoing, thus there were no enough 
qualification staff on ADB project management 
and procurement. 
•  PMO and sub-PMO will recruit new staff from 
different sectors to be responsible for different 
subprojects. 
•  Through the design-ready and procurement-
ready concept, we can reduce the delays on 
procurement. 
•  The procurement specialist provided relevant 
staff of the PMO and the local PMOs with on-
the-job training on ADB’s procurement and 
consultant recruitment procedures during 
project preparation. 
•  Construction supervision companies will be 
recruited to conduct site supervision during the 
implementation of all work contracts. 
•  Potential delays in bidding documents 
preparation. 
•  It is still focusing on the lowest price instead of 
the lowest project life cycle cost. 
•  Since Hezhou is a relatively undeveloped 
region in the PRC, the interest from innovative 
suppliers is limited. 
•  Lack of technical skills at hospital and 
knowledge sharing center design, construction, 
and operation. 
•  The COVID-19 globally remains a challenge on 
the implementation of the project. 
B.   
Support Requirement 
7. 
The following factors are considered for the successfully implementation of the project. 
Appendix 8  
143 
Procurement Capability 
and Capacity 
Experience in 
Implementing Similar 
Projects 
The EA and PMO both have rich experience on international financial 
institution (IFI) financed projects, including WB, ADB and AFD financed 
project. The IFI financed projects covered different sectors, including water 
treatment, environmental improvement, elderly care and TVET. Through the 
experience, the EA and PMO have gained certain experience on WB and 
ADB procurement policies. 
PMO has 2 staff in its Procurement Division, they have some experience of 
procurement and contract management for domestic projects, but not under 
ADB procedures or in English. One staff will work full-time on this ADB 
financed project during project implementation. 
For the WB financed Hezhou Urban Water Infrastructure and Environment 
Improvement Project, there is no institutionalized project management 
consultancy firm and individual procurement specialist recruited yet. Thus, 
PMO staffs can only receive procurement knowledge through limited WB 
training seminars. Thus, the procurement and contract management 
capacity for PMO staff on IFI projects is limited. 
The IAs (PIUs) have full-time staffs to be responsible for procurement. 
The IAs (PIUs) have rich experience on domestic financed project, but they 
have no experience on IFI financed project. 
PMO needs to recruit experienced procurement agency to support the 
project procurement and provide guidance to PIUs. 
IAs (PIUs) have adequate technical staff on design review and management 
for civil engineering project. However, their experiences are more restricted 
to local-based knowledge. 
PMO does not have staff with professional background in green 
procurement or sustainable procurement50, therefore, to achieve the project 
objectives, an international green procurement specialist will be recruited to 
support the implementation of green procurement related activities.. 
Meanwhile, PMO will appoint green procurement focal to be responsible for 
executing the green procurement outputs with the support of external 
consultants, to maximize institutional capacity building and ensure 
sustainability of the initiatives. 
The EA and PMO have been involved in multiple IFI financed project, 
including WB, ADB and AFD financed project. 
WB Financed Hezhou Urban Water Infrastructure and Environment 
Improvement Project 
The project objectives are to improve flood risk management and reduce 
discharge of water pollutants in Hezhou Municipality. The total investment is 
around $359.4 million, in which WB financed $150 million. 
50 Green  procurement  represents  selectively  choosing  products  with  less  environmental  impact  during  procurement 
activity. Currently, this is no national green procurement regulations available, thus a green procurement specialist 
shall be recruited to develop specifications during the procurement.  
144 
Appendix 8 
This project has three components: (i) the first component, Improving Flood 
Risk Resilience of the He River, aims to reduce flood risks along the 
mainstream He River by connecting mainstream to tributaries, improving 
flood drainage capacity, removing obstructions, and upgrade river 
infrastructure in the mainstream channel. (ii) the second component, 
Improving Urban Drainage and Wastewater Management, aims to reduce 
urban waterlogging by diverting flood waters, enhancing tributary drainage 
capacities, and storing/absorbing flood waters in lakes, improved canals, 
and elements of green infrastructure; and at the same time, reduce water 
pollution by separating storm and sewage systems, and providing full 
collection and treatment of wastewater. (iii) the third component, Institutional 
Strengthening, Capacity Building and Project Management, aims to 
strengthen the capacity and coordination of local institutions by using the 
development of an integrated flood risk and urban drainage masterplan as a 
Coordination platform for coordinated water planning and management (led 
by Hezhou Municipality), support the development of smart water and flood 
monitoring systems, and support effective project management. 
The approval date for this project 13 June 2018. This project is ongoing. 
ADB Financed Demonstration of Guangxi Elderly Care and Health Care 
Integration and Public–Private Partnership Project 
This project aims to support Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region (GZAR) 
to promote, coordinate, and deliver integrated elderly-care and health-care 
services to provide continued care for those in need. It will serve as a 
demonstration for the People's Republic of China (PRC) of an integrated 
elderly-care and health-care system and will be the first project in GZAR to 
introduce internationally accepted public–private partnership (PPP) 
principles and standards in the elderly-care sector. 
It will build an elderly-care facility in Hezhou municipality through a PPP 
modality, which will include arrangements to build, operate, and maintain the 
facility. It will also improve coordinated care services and facilities in the 
municipalities of Nanning and Hezhou by building four elderly-care facilities 
and a medical institution with age-friendly designs. 
This project is approved in 24 Sep 2019, and be effective on 04 March 2020. 
The total investment is around $193 million, in which ADB financed $100 
million. 
ADB Financed Guangxi Modern Technical and Vocational Education 
and Training Development Program 
This is a RBL project. 
The program will provide, in 2017–2022, timely and essential support for the 
establishment of a technical and vocational education and training (TVET) 
system that provides graduates with better employment opportunities in 
industries in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region (GZAR) by enhancing the 
industry relevance of TVET, improving the quality of TVET, increasing the 
inclusiveness of TVET, and expanding the role of TVET in regional 
economic development. The proposed results-based lending (RBL) program 
is critical for GZAR to implement a comprehensive TVET system reform 
package with a focus on results and system improvements, in accordance 
with the GZAR's Thirteenth Five-Year Plan, 2016–2020, which is in the 
second year of implementation. It is expected to create strong synergetic 
effects, together with the Guangxi Regional Cooperation and Integration 
Appendix 8  
145 
Promotion Investment Program, on cross-border cooperation and training, 
particularly benefiting bordering Viet Nam. 
The Hezhou Collage is involved into this project as one of the demonstration 
collages. 
This project is undergoing at present. 
AFD Financed Hezhou Ecological Environment and Biodiversity 
Protection Project 
This project includes ecological environment and biodiversity conservation 
projects with Gupo mountain and forest biodiversity protection of ecological 
restoration, the development of jade stone forest eco-tourism area, and Yao 
river ecological restoration and Huangyao ancient town of ancient building 
repair and construction of public space governance 
Through the introduction of advanced ideas in the field of biodiversity and 
cultural heritage protection and technical means, it will strengthen the Gupo 
mountain national forest park of biodiversity conservation and construction, 
promote the stability and development of geological heritage jade stone 
forest, the famous historical and cultural towns raise Huangyao ancient town 
protection and surrounding environment governance, congratulation state 
environmental protection and economic development to realize the 
sustainable development. 
This project is undergoing at present. 
Both IAs (PIUs) staffs have good knowledge and experiences in similar 
projects, including school construction, environmental restoration, etc. 
However, those were all domestic government financed and only domestic 
contractors used.  
As of April 2021, the PMO is responsible for around 4 different IFI financed 
projects, but there were no external consultants recruited yet. 
As mentioned above, there are two staffs under the procurement division, 
however, only one staff has been assigned to work on this ADB project full-
timely. Meanwhile, this one full-time staff will be responsible for both 
procurement and contract management. Thus, due to the inadequate staff 
on contract management, the contract management capability of the PMO is 
limited. 
For the current IFI financed projects, the day-to-day contact management 
and construction supervision is delegated to PIUs. There were enough 
engineering and technical staffs for PIUs to supervise the progress and 
quality of works contracts. But the management capability and experience 
on IFI financed project is limited, since they only have experience on 
government financed projects, and using domestic contractors. FIDIC based 
contract will be applied. 
Thus, trainings on contract management, particularly in understanding of 
contract risks and mitigation, will be beneficial for EA, PMO, IAs and PIUs. 
PMO will recruit Procurement and Contract Management Specialist to guide 
and support the contract management and capacity building. This 
procurement and contract management specialist have been included into 
the TOR of Project Management Consulting firm. 
Additional PMO staff shall be assigned during the project implementation 
period based on the working load, as needed.

Appendix 8 
Level of Reliance on 
External Consultants 
The PMO and PIU rely quite extensively on external consultants. Right now, 
there were no external procurement and contract management specialist 
working under the current WB financed water treatment project. 
Existence and 
Description of 
Complaints 
Management System 
The procurement and contract management staff in PMO is inadequate. It is 
important for the PMO staff to continue build its understanding and capacity 
in procurement and contract management. 
None of existing staff have experience and capacity on conducting green 
procurement. 
The capacity of PIU staffs remains a constrain, they have rich experience on 
domestic procurement, but no experience on IFI financed project, 
Overall, there will be a high reliance on external consultants for PMO, and 
PIUs. 
Draft TORs for Procurement and Contract Management Specialists during 
the start-up phase and implementation phase (as a part of TOR for Project 
Management Consulting Firm) will be listed in the project administration 
manual (PAM). 
A formal complaint management mechanism, which addresses grievances 
related to procurement and contract administration is in place. 
According to Article No. 13 of GPL, finance departments at all levels are 
responsible for supervision and management of government procurement. 
At central level, MOF administers the GPL and supervises day-to-day 
procurement through its provincial, municipal, and county bureaus. 
According to Article No. 4 of Regulations on Implementation of Tendering 
and Bidding Law of PRC (No. 613 Order of the State Council), NDRC guides 
and coordinates tendering and bidding in the PRC and the Key Projects 
Inspectorate Office (KPIO) under the NDRC monitors and inspects 
procurement for key projects and “makes recommendations when there is a 
breach of national regulations.” 
Audit departments at all levels carry out audit supervision on fund security 
and efficiency of funds utilization for construction projects financed by state-
owned fund; 
Public resource trading centers at all levels will witness public resource 
trading activities, rectify illegal behaviors or violations, assist administrative 
supervision departments, supervision departments to investigate and handle 
complaints; 
PMO will coordinate with the Public resource trading center and all finance 
departments on handling complaints; 
Based on the existing complaint system, PMO will establish its own 
complaint mechanism in accordance with the complaint handling 
requirements of ADB, and PMO will be the center of complaint handling 
Each IAs (PIU) will assign a focal point to handle complaints. 
The procurement agency also has arrangements to accept complaints and 
participate in complaint handling coordination. 
Consultants and contractors will be informed of ADB Procurement Tracking 
System available from ADB website. 
No additional support is required 
Appendix 8

C.    Key Procurement Conclusions 
Although the EA and PMO have rich experience to administer and supervise procurement activities 
under the project, it lacks capacity and has a shortage of staff to be able to carry out procurement 
activities on its one. Both IAs (PIUs) has no experience on IFI financed projects. Thus, an external 
consulting firm will be required for the incoming project. 
Training on EA, PMO, IAs and PIUs’ staff on ADB’s procurement framework, contract management, 
contract variation is necessary. Budget for trainings has been allocated in the total project cost. 
A formal complaint management mechanism, which addresses grievances related to procurement and 
contract administration is in place. However, it is still critical to establish a specific complaint 
management system and designated staffs for this project to make sure it is more visible and 
accessible. 
ADB’s Anticorruption Policy shall be explained to all stockholders. 
The PMO is authorized by the EA to coordinate and handle project procurement and contract 
management matters on behalf of the to ensure that all ADB procurement policies and regulations are 
fully complied with. The relevant procurement supervision agencies, such as the Finance Bureau and 
the local trading center, will support and assist the PMO in coordinating the procurement activities. 
The PMO will recruit a procurement agency with sufficient ADB procurement experience to support the 
entire procurement process. 
All PIUs are familiar with the technical practices of their respective sectors. But none of them had ADB 
project procurement experience. Therefore, PMO and PCM will aid PIUs on the preparation of bidding 
documents, and review construction drawings, bill of quantities and technical specifications, TOR of 
consulting services, etc. 
To strength the PMO’s project and contract management capabilities, external expertise will be 
required for FIDIC contract administration, safety and risk management, procurement management, 
quality management, green procurement, and contract management as well as support in certain 
technical areas. 
D.   
External Influences Analysis 
The  objective  of  the  external  influences  analysis  is  to  consider  any  external  drivers  of 
8. 
change specific to the project. the external influences analysis includes: 
Governance 
PRC level’s law and regulation on procurement 
In the PRC, public procurement is conducted in accordance with the Law 
on Tendering and Bidding of the PRC (1999) and the Government 
Procurement Law (2003). 
The Law of Tendering and Bidding of the PRC (1999) (TBL) which became 
effective on 1 January 2000 applies to all tendering and bidding activities in 
PRC and includes extensive articles on tendering, bidding, bid opening, 
evaluation and winning, legal liabilities, etc. The key contents of TBL 
include: 
It is specified in the Article No. 67 that procurement for projects financed by 
international organizations or foreign governments can follow their 
requirements and procedures if not against the social and public interest of 
148 
Appendix 8 
PRC. By following this article, ADB's Procurement Guidelines are currently 
applied for ADB financed projects in PRC. 
Another law, Government Procurement Law of PRC (2002) (GPL), plays a 
fundamental role for governmental entities, institutions or organizations at 
all levels that procure works, goods and services using fiscal funds. The 
Regulations on Implementation of Government Procurement Law of PRC 
became effective on 1 March 2015. 
Meanwhile, ADB’s procurement policies have been well implemented in the 
PRC for ADB financed projects for more than 30 years. 
ADB carried out country procurement review for PRC in 2016 and is 
finalizing the findings. The issues preliminarily identified include: (i) The 
system needs further (countrywide) harmonization and integration; (ii) the 
separation of regulatory and service delivery functions needs to continue; 
(iii) Local protectionism may undermine competition; (iv) Cost estimates 
often err on the high side, (v) Bid evaluation committees tend to apply rules 
to rigidly and make too many mistakes; (vi) the comprehensive bid 
evaluation system provides room for manipulations; (vii) insufficient 
attention to procurement during project preparation/procurement agents 
involved too late; (viii) risk of collusion through networks of affiliated 
companies. 
The HMG fully supports the project. A project leading group (PLG) has 
been established under the HMG, and chaired by the Mayor and Party 
Secretary with representative from all major departments in Hezhou. 
Economic 
The PRC’s Economy 
The Chinese economy experienced astonishing growth in the last few 
decades that catapulted the country to become the world's second largest 
economy. In 1978—when the PRC started the program of economic 
reforms—the country ranked ninth in nominal gross domestic product 
(GDP) with USD 214 billion; 35 years later it jumped up to second place 
with a nominal GDP of $9.2 trillion. 
The PRC weathered the global economic crisis better than most other 
countries. In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the economy grew by 
2.3% for the whole year, and is expected to be the only major economy in 
the world to achieve positive economic growth. It is expected that the PRC's 
real GDP to expand by 8.7% in 2021 underpinned by fiscal support for 
infrastructure, health care, and consumption. 
After loosening in 2020, monetary policy will shift to a neutral stance in 
2021, amid concerns of deepening structural imbalances. Weak global 
demand and strained foreign relations will intensify calls for economic self-
sufficiency via a new "dual circulation" model, which will also emphasize the 
importance of the domestic market. 
Hezhou’s Economic 
Hezhou is located in the northeast of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. 
The city's land area of 11,800 square kilometers, the population of more 
than 2.1 million. The GDP of Hezhou increased from CNY46.811 billion in 
2015 to CNY70.011 billion in 2019, the per capita GDP of permanent 
residents increased from CNY23,178 in 2015 to CNY33,676 in 2019, and 
the urbanization rate increased from 39% in 2012 to 46.8% in 2019.overall 
Appendix 8  
149 
speaking, the social, economy and financial revenue of the Hezhou showed 
a trend of steady development. 
Pinggui’s Economic 
The GDP and population of Pinggui grows steadily. In 2019, the gross 
domestic product of Pinggui District was CNY16.01 billion, an increase of 
13.8% over the previous year at comparable prices. In 2020, while strictly 
carrying out epidemic prevention and control, the Pinggui District 
Government strengthened the resumption of work and production, and 
achieved excellent results in economic development. 
In 2020, the GDP of Pinggui District was CNY18.34 billion, an increase of 
13.7%, exceeding the average level of Hezhou by 6.7 percentage points 
and exceeding the average level of Guangxi by 10 percentage points. 
Similar like Hezhou, the economics of Pinggui District has improved 
steadily, the pillar industries have continued to grow, and the three major 
industries have developed rapidly in coordination. 
It is expected that during the construction of the project, the local economic 
development will be developed at a relatively high speed. However, the 
impact of COVID-19 pandemic is widespread, there were potential risk on 
the economic development. 
• 
In terms of prices, the annual consumer consumption and retail price 
index is 3% in 2019. But the building materials is quite stable, energy 
prices are relatively cheap. 
•  Regarding the employment, the PRC has about 7 million university 
graduates every year. The employment pressure is high, however, the 
skilled labor with practical experience and skills is still lacking. 
• 
For labor supply, the price and cost of labor have increased rapidly. 
Thus, contractors have generally increased the promotion of 
mechanized construction technology. 
The project will bring significant benefits to residents in the project county 
and districts by significantly contributing to improved soil quality, improved 
water quality of the He River and its tributaries. These benefits will also 
reduce the pollution entering the Zhu River. Meanwhile, the project will 
improve the health-care and medical capacities by providing technical 
trainings and necessary equipment to hospitals at community level, and 
encourage the green transformation of Hezhou. 
The project will be carried out in accordance with ADB’s Safeguard Policy 
Statement and the government’s legislation relating to environmental 
protection. 
Impact of climate change: climate change mitigation and adaptation 
measures have been incorporated in the design. All buildings in this project 
will be design as level II Green Building. 
Following the ecological priority and people-oriented design principles, the 
Kedashan design and construction emphasis nature-based approach. 
The sponge city design has been cooperated into all buildings, and energy 
saving design has been incorporated into all buildings. 
Green procurement: energy saving design and green procurement 
principles will be followed. Under the project, any products listed in the 
“Elimination Catalog for High Energy Consumption Backward Mechanical 
Sustainability 
150 
Appendix 8 
and Electrical Equipment (product) are strictly prohibited. PMO will make 
the best effort to adopt green procurement practices during the 
procurement. 
The Green Procurement Specialist, which will be recruited during 
implementation, will guide the application of green procurement practices, 
i.e., review technical specifications in bidding documents. 
Environmental and green education: courses on green industry and green 
concepts will be introduced in the knowledge and skill sharing center. 
The e-procurement platform in Hezhou and Guangxi is available. The local 
and national e-procurement platforms will be used partially for e-publication 
only for all packages under the project. 
Technology 
The project will rely on the use of standard technologies. 
For the mine restoration project, a natural based approach will be adapted, 
which means a minimize technology work will be applied. 
Some new green and low carbon engineering technology will be applied, 
which have been tested and used in other project. 
There are certain challenges for the design and construction of hospital, a 
qualified design institute shall be hired. Meanwhile, ADB will provide 
guidance in the while process. 
The technology pace of change and innovation is quick for goods 
packages, especially for the medical equipment and smart IT systems, 
which has potential to gain advantage by sourcing and utilizing credible 
recent innovations. 
Overall, the technologies are available and proven in similar projects. 
As a multidimensional technology, BIM can realize data and information 
sharing in the whole process of building design, construction, and 
operation, and provide effective tools for building performance optimization 
and scientific management. However, the BIM technology used under 
contraction is not well developed and systemized. Since there is no 
standardized platform for the whole life cycle of the building, the BIM 
management and data sharing between designer, contractor, owner, and 
operator will be limited. Meanwhile, the owner has no experience on BIM 
technology. The Owners and PMO staffs are encouraged to take BIM 
courses as part of their capacity improvement activities. 
It is encouraged that the BIM technology shall be applied at design, 
construction and operations, and a working mechanism on BIM 
management and data sharing shall be established before the project start. 
Since 2018, GZAR had conducted BIM application polit on 26 projects to try 
to promote the BIM technology application in the construction industry of 
GZAR. PUCIC could try to apply the Pinggui Workers’ Hospital project as a 
BIM pilot project. Once approved, with the assistance from provincial level, 
the BIM technology can be more effectively applied. 
E.  Key Procurement Conclusions 
National and provincial governments have enforced procurement laws and regulations. 
ADB procurement regulations have been implemented effectively for over 30 years in the PRC, which 
will be applied for ADB financed subprojects as well in this project. 
Appendix 8  
151 
The PRC has kept appropriate economic growth and stability. Chinese economy is backing into normal 
gradually since the full control of the COVID-19 outbreak. 
The economy of Hezhou and Pinggui is growing steadily, which ranks top level even in the PRC. 
Both environmental and ecological conditions have provided sustainable conditions for the project. 
The political, security, economic situation and policies of the government are favorable for the 
successful implementation of the project. 
In terms of technology, there is no substantial risk. 
The local and national e-procurement platforms will be used partially for e-publication only for all 
packages under the project.

H.  Key Procurement Conclusions 
Communication  is  an  essential  part  of  the  procurement  process  during  the  implementation  of 
procurement plan. PMO will make a mechanism to communicate with all stakeholders, and prepare a 
procurement manual to coordinate all the stakeholders. 
In this project, there are many consulting contracts involves multiple departments and require for the 
support  from  upper  authorities.  Thus,  it  is  very  important  to  keep  upper  authorities  and  stakeholders 
informed and get their feedback and support. 
156 
Appendix 8 
Timely  and  transparent  information  on  project  preparation  and  implementation  will  be  essential, 
particularly for procurement and value for money. 
The communication of relevant parties in the procurement process mainly focuses on: 
  Procurement schedule; 
  The quality of technical documents, the construction drawings, bill of quantities and technical 
specifications; 
  The differences between ADB's bid evaluation criteria and domestic practices; 
  Handling of reports and complaints in the procurement process; 
  A green procurement guideline will be prepared to promote green procurement practices. 
PMO plays a key role in the communication of entire procurement process and project implementation. 
Effective  communications  will  also  be  based  on  the  quality  of  communication  materials,  timing,  and 
approach to conduct communication.  
Appendix 8

SECTION 3: MARKET ANALYSIS 
The  purpose  of  the  market  analysis  is  to  allow  the  borrower  to  develop  an  appropriate 
9. 
understanding of the relevant market sectors, their structures, and how they operate. 
This Section is developed based on (i) recent similar projects carried out in Hezhou and 
10. 
GZAR; (ii) case studies and findings under ADB/ World Bank financing projects. Please refer to 
Appendices 1-10 for relevant project experiences and market research data. 
11.  Market analysis has been conducted intensively, assessments and results are presented 
in following tables by Works, Goods and Consulting Services. Experiences drawn from the market 
analysis can be summarized as follows: 
•  The  PRC  has  a  mature,  completive  market  on  civil  construction  project.  In  2018,  the  total 
output value of the PRC's construction industry exceeded CNY 24 trillion, with a total of more 
than 90,000 construction enterprises and about 55 million construction employees nationwide, 
and the new contract value of the construction industry reached CNY27 trillion in 2018.Based 
on ranking list of 250 largest contractors in the world published by ENR in 2018, there were 
54 Chinese companies in the top 250 list. For detail information, see Appendix 2: ENR top 
250 Global Contractors in 2018 – Mainland PRC contractors. Domestic competitive bidding 
is sufficient to attract qualified bidders, based on the understanding of domestic market, and 
other similar project studies; 
•  Contract  packaging  should  consider 
land  acquisition 
implementation plan, detailed design etc., to make the package sufficient to attract qualified 
bidders; 
the  actual 
location, 
logistic, 
•  From  the  contract  management  perspective,  the  contract  value  should  be  sufficient  to 
generate interest from the market. For our project, the contract value is ranging from $3.10 
million to $70 million for works; $0.80 million to $9.31 million for goods. 
•  Based on the market research results as can be seen in Appendix 14: Potential bidders for 
smart hospital construction, it is better to group the design, build and equipment provisions 
for customized IT system in one contract to attract higher qualified bidders and ensure the 
compatibility  of  the  system.  Meanwhile,  obligations  for  supplier  to  guarantee  a  certain 
operation period and provide ongoing staff support for knowledge transfer to client will allow 
the owner to get sufficient knowledge, which will ensure the sustainable system operation; 
•  As can be seem from the Appendix 7: Top 10 medical equipment manufacturers worldwide 
and  Appendix  8”  Top  end  medical  equipment  manufactures  in  the  PRC,  in  the  medical 
equipment industry market, the high-tech medical equipment market is mainly controlled by 
foreign brands. Thus, it is recommended to advertised internationally for high-tech medical 
equipment to attract dealers from international medical equipment market. However, for most 
commonly-used,  low-tech  medical  equipment,  it  is  encouraged  by  government  to  use 
domestic brands. Thus, for low-tech medical equipment provided for hospitals at township-
level, it can be advertised domestically. 
A.   
Lessons Learned from Previous Projects 
Lessons learned from previous projects in PRC 
12. 
Since  1986,  ADB  has  been  working  with  the  PRC  in  supporting  poverty  reduction, 
economic  development,  environmental  protection,  social  development,  climate  change,  etc. 
158 
Appendix 8 
Based on the experience of ADB project’s procurement, some lessons can be learned from the 
previously implemented projects. 
•  Very low bid in procurement – ADB Procurement Policy indicates to accept the lowest bid 
that meets the bidding qualification requirements. Due to the fierce market competition in the 
PRC, there are bidders using extremely low bids to bid on ADB or WB projects. These very 
low bids mean that the bid price is lower than the actual construction cost. If the contract is 
awarded to such a low bidder, the implementation of the project will run into major difficulties, 
and the contractor will find reasons to receive additional money for the contract; otherwise, 
there will not be any construction progress. ADB procurement reforms appropriate to local 
practices,  introduces  abnormally  low  bids  and  release  more  flexibility  in  2017.  The  new 
procurement framework is expected to provide clients with a more flexible, principles-based, 
and modern approach to procurement while allowing ADB to continue to effectively perform 
its fiduciary responsibility. But it remains a challenge for implementing them in PRC. In the 
PMISC team, there will be a procurement/contract management specialist to assist the PMO 
on handling the very low bid issues following the new framework. Meanwhile, the risk can be 
mitigated  by  setting  up  a  good  qualification  requirement  based  on  the  market  research 
results. 
•  Weak  institutional  capacity  –  ADB  projects  usually  involve  multiple  sectors  and  agencies 
during the project implementation phase, which is a different set-up as compared to typical 
domestic  projects.  The  domestic  project  is  usually  in  a  single  sector  and  involves  fewer 
agencies, and requires much less interagency coordination. In our project, the PMISC team 
consists  of  multiple  specialists  from  different  sectors  to  assist  the  PMO  during  the 
implementation. Meanwhile, and interagency coordination system has been established in 
Hezhou PMO and Pinggui PMO level to encourage the participation of all stakeholders. 
•  Many ADB projects had significant delays due to the slow or no progress of land acquisition 
and resettlement (LAR). The difficulty of land acquisition has been fully considered during the 
preparation of procurement plan. Meanwhile, An ADB’s study shows that the average loan 
implementation project would have an average implementation period of over 6 years.  51 In 
our project, we proposed a longer implementation period (around 6.5 years) to make sure it 
can be completed on time. 
•  Standard bidding documents. a provision on ALBs was introduced in the standard bidding 
documents  (SBDs),  which  provides  guidance  for  determining  and  treating  ALBs  during 
evaluation, including possible rejection of such bids if the evidence provided by the bidder 
does  not  satisfactorily  justify  the  low  bid  price.  The  provisions  introduced  in  the  bidding 
documents are already having an effect in ADB financed projects. This validates the need for 
such  provisions  to  decrease  the  risk  of  poor  implementation  performance  and  thereby 
increase value for money in ABD-financed procurement. 
•  Maximizing  value  for  money  in  ADB  financed  procurement.  The  key  principle  is  for  the 
borrower to obtain optimal benefits through effective, efficient, and economic use of resources 
by  applying,  as  appropriate,  the  core  procurement  principles  and  related  considerations, 
which  may  include  life  cycle  costs  and  socioeconomic  and  environmental  development 
objectives of the borrower. 
•  A  more  rigorous  project  cost  estimates  during  appraisal  is  importance  for  the  smooth 
implementation. The early project activities faced uncertainties in their implementation, the 
total investment of the project may drop significantly due to the change of content or change 
51 PRC Portfolio Overview by ADB, December 2020

159 
of design. In our project, both the cost estimate and the design details have been reviewed 
and discussed, and ADB will also participate into the preliminary design stage to ensure the 
quality of the project will not be compromised due to the cost issue. 
Lessons learned from previous projects conducted by PMO: 
13.  WB Financed Hezhou Urban Water Infrastructure and Environment Improvement Project 
(see Appendix 1: similar project experience for PMO and IAs) 
The project is approved in June 13, 2018, and the loan closing date will be June 30, 2024. 
14. 
The  development  objectives  of  Hezhou  Urban  Water 
Infrastructure  and  Environment 
Improvement Project for the PRC are to improve flood risk management and reduce discharge of 
water pollutants in Hezhou Municipality. The total investment is around $359.4 million, in which 
WB financed $150 million.52 
15. 
This  project  has  three  components.  (i)  The  first  component,  Improving  Flood  Risk 
Resilience  of  the  He  River,  aims  to  reduce  flood  risks  along  the  mainstream  He  River  by 
connecting mainstream to tributaries, improving flood drainage capacity, removing obstructions, 
and upgrade river infrastructure in the mainstream channel. (ii) The second component, Improving 
Urban Drainage and Wastewater Management, aims to reduce urban water logging by diverting 
flood waters, enhancing tributary drainage capacities, and storing/absorbing flood waters in lakes, 
improved  canals,  and  elements  of  green  infrastructure;  and  at  the  same  time,  reduce  water 
pollution by separating storm and sewage systems, and providing full collection and treatment of 
wastewater. (iii) The third component, Institutional Strengthening, Capacity Building and Project 
Management, aims to strengthen the capacity and coordination of local institutions by using the 
development  of  an  Integrated  flood  risk  and  urban  drainage  master  plan  as  a  Coordination 
platform for coordinated water planning and management (led by Hezhou Municipality), support 
the  development  of  smart  water  and  flood  monitoring  systems,  and  support  effective  project 
management. 
16. 
The  PIA  includes  the  Project  Management  Office  (PMO),  which  refers  to  Hezhou 
Municipal  World  Bank  Loan  Project  Management  Office  (Hezhou  PMO),  and  the  Project 
Implementation Units (PIUs), which refer to Hezhou Municipal Water Resources Bureau (HWRB), 
Hezhou  Municipal  Engineering  Administration  Bureau  (HMEAB)  and  Hezhou  Municipal 
Environmental Protection Bureau (HEPB). 
17. 
Based  on  the  latest  procurement  plan,  the  project  currently  has  45  contract  packages 
(using World Bank loan funds). Includes: 26 civil works construction contract packages, 8 goods 
procurement  contract  packages,  4  consultancy  service  contract  packages,  and  7  individual 
consultant  contracts.  Some  similar  contracts  will  be  introduced  in  Appendix  1:  similar  projects 
conducted  by  PMO  and  IAs.  Some  lessons  were  learned  during  the  implementation  of  WB 
financed project: 
•  Until  the  end  of  2020,  only  three  contracts  have  been  awarded  under  the  WB  Financed 
project, including Environment Improvement and Auxiliary Facilities (Elevators) (equipment), 
Project  Supervising  (consulting),  and  Huang'ansi  and  Shizigang  Flood  Drainage  Rivers 
Comprehensive Treatment (civil works). 
•  Due to the geographic location of Hezhou (consultants are requested to working on site) and 
due to the traffic restriction during COVID-19, the progress of hiring individual consultant is

Appendix 8 
not  going  well.  The  procurement  of  project  financial  consultant  (national),  project  cost 
consultant(national),  resident  engineer  (national)  and  project  procurement  consultant 
(national) are not going well since there were no adequate, qualified bidders express their 
interest.  Under  the  WB  financed  Hezhou  Urban  Water  Infrastructure  and  Environment 
Improvement Project, the request for EOI was published in March 2020, but until now, the 
contracts were not awarded yet. In our project, many specialists from different sectors shall 
be  hired  during  the  implementation  of  the  project  to  provide  technical  assistance  and 
knowledge sharing. Thus, to mitigate the risk of low interest of individual consultants, and to 
reduce the management and procurement difficulties for PMO, we proposed to hire PMISC 
instead of individual consultants. 
•  The procurement on project supervising firm is lagging. The request for EOI was published 
in march 28, 2019, and the contract was finally awarded in December 16, 2020. In the EOI, 
it requested that 18 personnel shall be assigned to this project, and all of them shall obtain 
the certificate of national registered supervision engineer. Indeed, for most domestic project, 
only the chief supervision engineer and some specialized supervision engineer shall obtain 
the national certification, other people, such as site inspector, can be assistant engineer or 
obtain the supervisor qualification. In our project, this issue has been fully considered into the 
draft TOR for construction supervision. 
•  The actual signed contract amount for works is around 20% lower than cost estimate. The 
cost estimate shall be further enhanced to ensure the overall investment plan. 
•  The actual schedule on procurement is far lagging due to multiple reasons, especially for the 
COVID-19 pandemic and the land acquisition issue. 
Lessons learned from previous domestic projects by PIUs: 
18. 
Both  PUCIC  and  HMIC  have  rich  experiences  on  construction  project.  The  PUCIC 
completed many projects regarding urban infrastructure in the Pinggui District. In 2019, there are 
100  civil  work  contracts,  18  goods  contracts  and  28  consulting  service  contracts,  with  a  total 
investment of CNY 700 million. In 2020, affected by the COVID-19, the PUCIC PIU still has a total 
investment  of  CNY  390  million,  involving  57  civil  work  contracts,  10  goods  contract,  and  21 
consulting service contracts. In 2020, HMIGC has 8 civil work contracts, 4 goods contracts and 6 
consulting  service  contracts.  These  projects  demonstrate  their  rich  construction  and  project 
management experience of the company. 
For detail domestic project information, please see Appendix 1: similar projects conducted 
19. 
by PMO and IAs. Procurement experience learned from that domestic funded project includes: 
•  Both PUCIC and HMIGC have conducted similar domestic projects in recent year. 
•  PUCIC  has  abundant  experience  on  infrastructure  construction  and  management  as  the 
owner,  especially  for  the  construction  of  school.  But  it  has  no  working  experience  on  the 
construction  and  management  of  hospital  project.  Thus,  Medical  and  health/elderly-care 
building  engineer  and  architect  will  be  recruited  (in  PMISC)  to  assist  on  the  design, 
construction and management for the hospital project. 
•  The  PRC  has  developed  a  comprehensive  system  of  laws  and  regulations  to  govern  the 
public  procurement  activities  that  are  consistent  with  the  ADB  procurement  principles.  All 
bidding activity will be carried out at the public resource trading centers at the different levels. 
•  A  good  quality  technical  specification  is  very  important  and  the  key  of  a  successful 
procurement. 
Appendix 8  
161 
•  Technical specifications for goods will also be reviewed by an expert panel before the bidding 
process  commences.  Technical  specifications  of  civil  works  are  prepared  by  the  qualified 
design institute used for the engineering design work. Without proper design, significant cost 
and time overruns will occur. 
•  The relatively low thresholds for bidding will result in an unnecessarily large amount of bid 
invitations  having  to  be  issued.  Transaction  cost  for  small  bids  may  be  increased.  Cost 
effectiveness in the procurement process may be compromised as a result. In our project, 
the smallest bidding package for goods and civil works is $0.8 million, which is a relatively 
high  contract  value  comparing  with  other  domestic  projects.  Meanwhile,  the  qualification 
requirement  in  bidding  documents  will  be  prepared  carefully  through  a  market  research 
process, which can reduce the risk of low thresholds of bidding. 
•  There have been some government sponsored training programs in place. However, they are 
insufficient in volume. 
•  The market in PRC for the civil works, goods and services is well developed with numerous 
competitive players from the private sector. 
•  Ethical and anticorruption safeguards are required and covered in most of the procurement 
documents and practices. 
•  The adequacy and accuracy of cost estimates are required before bidding. It is difficult to 
manage the variations during implementation.

In  2019,  the  national  construction  industry  completed  a  total  output 
value  of  CNY2,484,459  billion.  In  2019,  the  number  of  construction 
enterprises in the country was 103,814, with a yearly increase of 8.8%. 
According  to  the  U.S.  Engineering  News  Record  ("ENR")  magazine, 
the  world's  250  largest  international  contractors  in  2018  achieved  a 
total  revenue  of  $482.4  billion  in  overseas  markets.  A  total  of  69 
companies from Mainland PRC were listed in the list of the world’s 250 
largest international contractors in 2018. 
In  the  PRC,  there  is  a  mature  system  for  the  supervision  and 
monitoring  on  the  construction  market  in  the  PRC,  most  qualified 
contractor  and  project  experiences  are  published  on  the  National 
Public Service Platform for Construction Market Supervision.53 Based 
on the published information, it can be concluded that: 
(i)  For  the  construction  of  Hospital,  a  higher  qualification  could  be

Construction Engineering54). In GZAR, there have 9 contractors 
which  can  satisfy  the  requirement.  All  of  them  have  working 
experience on hospital before and they will be strong competitor 
for this hospital project, 
(ii)  For the construction of tailing collection, treatment and disposal, 
a  qualification  on  environmental  engineering  is  required.  In 
GZAR, there are 77 qualified contractors which have the Grade 1 
qualification  on  the  environmental  engineering.  Most  of  them 
have working experience on mining tailing collection and landfill 
project, and they will be strong competitor for the tailing collection, 
treatment, and disposal project in Kedashan. 
(iii)  For  other  construction  project,  such  as  the  construction  of 
Knowledge sharing center and elderly-care center, the scale and 
complexity are relatively small. There are more potential bidders 
for those projects. 
For detail analysis on the potential bidders for hospital, construction 
of tailing collection, treatment and disposal, and other civil projects, 
please see appendix. 
Due  to  over  supplied  market  in  civil  works,  the  bargaining  power  of 
buyer (PIUs) is high. In the bidding stage, PIUs have the initiative in 
contract  estimation  and 
technical  standards.  The  Contract 
Management and Procurement Specialist, Green Procurement, other 
technical specialists, and PIUs’ staff will ensure the preparation of good 
quality specifications. 
Bargaining Power

Low 
At the end of 2018, there were 620 legal entities in the construction 
industry in Hezhou. 
Because of the fierce competition in the market, suppliers in the bidding 
stage often do not have much bargaining power in bidding.

In the PRC, there were certain qualification requirement on contractors 
which can be divided into 12 sub-categories and I, II, III and Special

Although  new  entrants  can  join  the  market  competition,  contractors 
who  lack  strong  qualification,  or  regional  and  ADB-funded  project 
experience  are  unlikely  to  meet  the  requirements  of  substantive 
bidding response. Therefore, the risk of new entrants to this project is 
limited. 
This  project  mainly  is  a  government  investment  and  infrastructure 
project, generally using mature technology, in which the construction 
drawing  design  is  generally  undertaken  by  the  first-class  domestic 
design  institutes,  who  are  familiar  with  technical  standards  and 
substitutes are generally prudent and risk controllable.

The  PRC  has  many  goods  manufacturers  and  suppliers  with 
comprehensive specialties and strong competitiveness. 
For  building  associated  equipment,  training  equipment,  elderly-care 
equipment  and  IT  equipment,  due  to  over  supplied  market,  the 
bargaining power of buyer (PIUs) is high. In the bidding stage, PMO 
has the initiative in contract estimation and technical standards. The 
Contract  Management  and  Procurement  Specialist,  Green 
Procurement, other technical specialists, and PIUs’ staff will ensure the 
preparation of good quality specifications. 
In  most  cases,  because  of  the  fierce  competition  in  the  market, 
suppliers  in  the  bidding  stage  often  do  not  have  much  bargaining

Based  on  the  PRC's  medical  device  industry  market  status  and 
competitive  landscape  analysis  in  2020,  the  medical  equipment 
industry  is  a  multi-disciplinary,  knowledge-intensive,  and  capital-

Appendix 8 
intensive  high-tech  industry.  The  global  medical  equipment  industry 
has a high degree of concentration. At present, the sales volume of the 
top 25 medical equipment companies in the world accounts for 60% of 
the  total  sales  of  the  global  medical  equipment  industry.  From  the 
perspective of various countries and regions, the United States firmly 
occupies the leading position in the industry. Please see Appendix 7: 
Top 10 medical equipment manufacturers worldwide for details. 
With  the  deepening  of  trade  globalization,  foreign  medical  device 
products have fully participated in the competition in the PRC. Based 
on the medical equipment import and export data, the PRC's reliance 
on  diagnostic  and  therapeutic  equipment  is  significant.  the  PRC's 
imports of medical equipment in the hospital diagnosis and treatment 
equipment accounted for 69.69% of total market. Please see Appendix 
7 to 9 for more details. 
Based  on  the  "Supervision  and  Administration  of  Medical  Devices 
Regulations"  Article  XI:  second-class,  third-class  medical  equipment 
manufacturers  outside  the  PRC,  should  establish  its  representative 
office in the PRC or designate the enterprise legal person in the PRC 
as  an  agent,  which  is  responsible  to  submit  registration  application 
information and supporting document to the State Council Food and 
Drug  Administration.  Thus,  most  international  suppliers  have  branch 
company  or  certified  representatives  in  the  PRC,  as  can  be  seen  in 
Appendix 6. 
However,  for  some  high-tech  medical  equipment,  if  imported  with 
original  packaging  overseas,  it  will  involve  customs  clearance  and 
other  matters,  based  on  the  “Measures  for  the  Implementation  of

The PRC has also made some progress for on the medical equipment 
industry,  especially  for  low-tech  equipment.  The  size  of  the  PRC's 
medical equipment market reached CNY530.4 billion in 2018. As of the 
end  of  April  2019,  there  were  a  total  of  about  18,800  medical 
equipment enterprises in the PRC, mainly concentrated in the eastern 
coastal region. At present, most medical equipment has substitutable 
domestic products, especially for low-tech equipment. 
Bargaining Power 
of Buyers 
Medium 
to High 
For  some  medical  device  with  lower  technology  and  knowledge 
contents, there will be adequate competition due to the large volumes 
of equipment to be purchased. 
For  certain  types  of  medical  devices,  there  are  few  alternatives  of 
supply.  It  is  importance  to  conduct  fully  market  research  and  have 
adequate qualification criteria during the procurement process. 
Appendix 8

Bargaining  Power 
of Suppliers 
Low to

For  high-tech  medical  equipment,  due  to  the  number  of  qualified 
participants is limited, bidder who participate have certain bargaining 
power over the buyer as supplier market is dominated by a few bidders.

Entrants 
Low  to 
medium 
For  medical  device  industry,  it  is  a  multi-disciplinary,  knowledge-
intensive, and capital-intensive high-tech industry. It is very complicate 
to enter the market. meanwhile, the capital requirement is a financial 
barrier to enter the medical device industry. 
Recently, the Chinese government has introduced several policies to 
support the development of domestic medical equipment. Since 2016, 
it  is  encouraged  those  public  hospitals  shall  give  priority  to  the 
allocation of domestic medical equipment. 
Risk of 
Substitutes 
Low  
For medical equipment, it is encouraged to adopt innovation products 
if it has better curative effect. 
The  PRC  began  to  launch  several  batches  of  excellent  domestic 
medical  equipment  product  selection  in  2014.  The  Government 
Procurement  Law  of  the  People's  Republic  of  China  stipulates  that 
government procurement projects, in principle, shall procure domestic 
medical products if it can meet the requirements.

The Consultant has researched potential regional competitors 
capable of taking on similar projects based on contract awards 
published by ADB,55 Chinese traditional design, research institutes 
and universities, as well as international consulting institutions, can 
easily participate in the competition of consulting services for ADB 
loan projects. Due to the large number of bidding institutions, the

institution is unlikely to win the bid, so the risk is low. 
The consultancy services in the project are in conventional nature. 
The possibility of substitute to equivalent staff is low. 
C.  Key Procurement Conclusions 
Works: 
The PRC's engineering construction market is a buyer's market and there is fierce competition among 
contractors. PIUs, as the buyer, have the advantage of negotiating with the bidders. Special attention 
should be paid to landfill and hospital project, which request a higher construction quality. 
Goods: 
The size of goods packages is large; thus, a high completeness is expected. 
Some high-tech medical equipment can be supplier’s market. 
Consulting Service: 
Historically, there should be enough number of participating bidders. However, based on the experience 
of ongoing WB financed project, the competition rivalry on consulting services packages is medium to 
high. 
The qualification of consultants is critical to ensure the quality of proposed researches and studies. 
The main risk for the PMO and PIUs is the preparation of bidding documents and TORs, especially for 
the technical specifications. PMO or PIUs often falls into a passive situation because of rushing work 
and neglecting the quality of design documents, resulting in huge design changes in subsequent contract 
implementation. 
Therefore,  PMO  and  PIUs  should  attach  great  importance  to  the  quality  of  preparation  of  bidding 
documents,  especially  the  technical  section,  to  control  risks  during  the  implementation  stage.  Project 
management consultants will be recruited to support the PMO during the project implementation period, 
in addition to the procurement agency, to make sure ADB’s procurement policies and regulations are 
fulfilled,  and  project  objectives  are  fully  incorporated  in  to  designs,  especially  the  green  procurement 
practices.

E.  Key Procurement Conclusions 
The construction of Pinggui Workers’ Hospital and procurement of high-tech medical equipment 
require more professional knowledge and technical complex. And it is critical to achieve the 
project development objectives. Thus, they are considered as strategy security. 
Therefore,  bidding  documents  including  design  verification  clause  are highly  preferred  while 
the engineering designs shall also be conducted before tendering. This will reduce the risks for 
contract variations/over budgets to the PMO. 
Consulting  services  related  to  project  start-up,  project  management  and  capacity  building, 
green procurement and environmental education, wetland monitoring are critical to the project 
success, to support PMO for the entire project implementation, therefore, those are categorized 
as critical category.

G.  Key Procurement Conclusions 
Core contracts are the key for reaching project objectives for improving the environmental restoration 
and health capacity. 
This tool demonstrates the level of willingness or reluctance the contractor will exhibit in willingness to 
bid  for  work  and  the  corresponding  level  of  effort  the  contractor  will  make  in  meeting  the  employer’s 
requirement 
Harvest contracts should require high thresholds for bidders’ qualifications and experiences to attract 
competent potential bidders. 
Capacity  building  contracts  will  be  more  attractive  for  NGO  and  high-profile  research  institutes  and 
universities, to increase contract attractiveness, the development contracts should clearly define tasks 
in the terms of reference (TOR).

project. There are many qualified bidders with experience on hospital construction, elderly-care center 
construction and school construction. Thus, for time saving and higher efficiency, advertised nationally 
for all civil works project is recommended. 
(2)  Green Procurement to be used for the ADB financed contract packages for works 
Option  1:  green  procurement  will  be  taken  into 
consideration  during  the  entire  procurement 
process 
Advantage: align with project strategic objective, 
energy saving and environmentally friendly, less 
operation cost, less carbon emission 
Disadvantage: a green procurement guideline 
shall be prepared and international green 
procurement specialist shall be hired. More time is 
needed on preparing bidding document and 
conducting market researches. May reduce a 
higher contract value due to the additional 
requirements. 
Option 2: without green procurement 
Advantage: less time consuming, cost saving during 
construction 
Disadvantage: energy consuming cost during 
operation may be higher, higher carbon emission 
during construction and operation 
The PRC has proposed an ambitious carbon neutral plan recently, and the importance of energy saving 
and emission reduction is further enhanced. The green procurement can significantly reduce the pollution 
and the impact on environment by promoting the usage of energy saving materials and products. It is not 
only  agreeing  with  the  ADB's  concept,  but  also  matching  with  the  trend  of  domestic  government 
procurement. Thus, the green procurement is recommended in this project. 
(3)  Packaging mode for works 
Option 1: tradition construction packaging mode 
(DBB) 
Advantage: both owners and contractors are very 
family with this mode. easy for the cost control. 
owner has more control on project. balance 
between each stockholder. 
Disadvantage: longer design and construction 
period, higher risk on design variation during

less time consuming. 
Disadvantage: time intensive on bidding process; 
big challenge on cost control; big challenge for 
selecting qualified contractor; owner has no 
experience on EPC contract; owner has less control 
on the whole project; higher risk on the 
performance of contractor 
Option 3: Design and Building 
Advantage: easy on cost control and quality control; 
less time consuming. 
Disadvantage: time intensive on bidding process; 
owner has no experience on DB management; 
owner has less control on the whole project

Comparing  with  the  traditional  DBB  mode,  both  EPC  and  DB  mode  have  some  benefits  considering 
about the schedule, quality control etc. However, the owner may have less control on the total investment 
of the project. Meanwhile, the risk on procurement is higher due to the high value contract amount, and 
the risk on project management is higher due to the owner has no experience on those mode. 
After  consulting  with  owner,  it  is  recommended  to  use  the  traditional  mode  to  ensure  the  smooth 
procurement and implementation of the project. 
Meanwhile, to reduce owner's working load on management and coordination, there will be only four 
packages under this hospital project: one general work contract will be responsible for the building civil 
works, one work contractor for the site work and wastewater plate, one goods contractor responsible for 
all building equipment procurement and installation, and one goods contractor responsible for information 
infrastructure and system development. 
(4)  work contracts 
Option 1: one large work package, including 
structure, finishing, MEP, Elevators, HAVC etc. 
Advantage:  one  contractor  can  oversee  the  works, 
better coordination on site, less time intensive 
Disadvantage: 
subcontract proportion 
Option 2: separate works packages 
Advantage: professional specialized company 
focuses on the major thing, more bidders, less cost 
Disadvantage: more time intensive on procurement 
and construction, more coordination work on site, 
working procedures shall be carefully considered 
The construction of a hospital is a very complex project comparing with other civil engineering projects. 
The coordination between each system is critical under this project. Meanwhile, the PMO and IA have 
no  experience  in  hospital  construction.  Thus  one  work  package,  including  structure,  finishing,  MEP, 
elevators, HAVC etc., is recommended. 
For  other  work  components,  such  as  the  PIHECC,  and  the  skill  and  knowledge  sharing  center,  the 
construction scope is relatively small and the is less specialized. Thus, one general contract for all will 
be applied, including building structures, finishing, MEP, elevators, HAVC, etc. 
(5)  merit point evaluation 
the  cost  will  be  higher,  higher

Option 1: merit point evaluation applied 
Advantage: to mitigate the risk of poor quality of bid 
winners, better for the quality and green 
performance of the building 
Disadvantage: it is difficult to develop the criteria, 
longer procurement procedure, more subjective 
instead of objectivity, higher risk of corruption, 
higher cost 
Option 2: merit point evaluation not applied 
Advantage: more objective, less time consuming on 
bidding document preparation and procurement, 
PMO are more familiar 
Disadvantage: less VfM, higher risk of poor quality 
bid winners 
It is quite risky to apply the merit point system in our project, since some quality criteria specified cannot 
be measured objectively, may be prone to abuse of discretion and it is difficulty in measuring if contract 
meets criteria. Meanwhile, those merit point evaluation system has not included into PRC’s SBDs for 
works and goods. 
Thus, it is recommended that this merit point evaluation system will not be applied into our project at 
current stage. After PRC updated the SBDs, it can be applied in the future. 
(6)  Prequalification 
Option 1: Prequalification 
Advantage: reduce the number of bidders, reduce 
the difficulty of bid evaluation, reduce the risk of 
disqualified bidders been awarded. 
Disadvantage: Increase bidding costs and prolong 
bidding cycle. the information is easily leaked, the 
risk of fraud is higher  
Option 2: No prequalification 
Advantage: Lower cost and shorter cycle time; 
Good for information confidentiality 
Disadvantage: too much potential bidders, which 
makes the bid evaluation workload higher; 
To reduce the risk of fraud during procurement, it is recommended that no prequalification will be applied 
to  work  contracts.  The  risk  of  disqualified  bidders  and  abnormal  low  price  can  be  mitigated  through 
detailed market researches and the preparation of a high-quality bidding document. 
(7)  BIM applied during the design, construction, and operation  
Option 1: BIM will be applied 
Advantage: provide visual building model, improve 
the design and construction quality, less design and 
construction variation, align with government’s 
strategic on promoting BIM 
Disadvantage: Increase bidding costs and prolong 
bidding cycle, different BIM models may be used, 
owner has no experience on BIM management, 
data sharing 
Option 2: BIM will not be applied 
Advantage: owners are familiar with the traditional 
approach 
Disadvantage: more design variation, longer 
construction period, repetition works between 
different contractors

Many  governments  have  begun  to  demand  that  large  public  facility  agencies  adopt  and  implement 
building information modeling (BIM) in their business processes. GZAR have published BIM guideline 
and start BIM polit in couple projects. Most of these are technical specifications that are useful at the 
project level, but no support for the organization-level adoption effort. 
BIM  has  significant  benefits  for  large  project.  Thus,  BIM  is  encouraged  to  be  applied  for  the  Pinggui 
Workers’ Hospital project. For other work components, such as health/elderly-care center, the skill and 
knowledge sharing center, since the construction scope is relatively small and the contract value is lower 
as  well,  BIM  will  not  be  applied  to  increase  the  competences  by  allowing  the  participation  of  small 
contractors, which may have no capacity of BIM.

(1)  Open competitive bidding (OCB) to be used for the ADB financed contract packages for high-tech 
medical equipment 
Option 1: OCB advertised internationally

medical equipment, ensure the quality of medical 
equipment

Disadvantage: English bidding documents need to 
be prepared, more working load for PMO. Market 
research showed that domestic market is mature in 
providing the works and goods that is needed under 
the project. 
Option 2: OCB advertised nationally (OCB-AN) 
Advantage: Easy to operate, less time consuming 
on procurement. 
Disadvantage: due to the restriction of customs’ 
import and export regulations, some high-tech 
medical equipment are request for advertised 
internationally 
For  most  good  procurement  packages,  OCB  advertised  nationally  will  be  recommended  due  to  the 
domestic market is mature. 
However, for some high-tech medical equipment, there may have no substitutable products in the PRC. 
For  these  products,  if  imported  with  original  packaging,  it  will  involve  customs  clearance  and  other 
matters,  based  on  the  “Measures  for  the  Implementation  of  International  Bidding  for  Mechanical  and 
Electrical  Products,”  the  international  advertisement  is  recommended  considering  about  the  following 
benefits: 
The advertised internationally can encourage the participation of international manufactures and dealers 
as well to enhance the competitiveness. 
Part  of  the  mechanical  and  electrical  equipment  procured  through  international  procurement;  the 
contractor can apply for tax rebates. Thus, it can reduce the bid price of equipment. 
The  Ministry of  Commerce  promulgated  the  relevant  regulations  for  the  international  procurement.  In 
practice,  the  government  procurement  supervision  and  management  department  and  the  Ministry  of 
Commerce will perform certain supervisory functions on the use of international mechanical and electrical 
products bidding projects to strengthen the quality of bidding documents and ensure project compliance.

Option 1: package all medical equipment into a 
single goods package 
Advantage:  one  dealer  will  handle  everything;  time 
saving, and easy for contract management 
Disadvantage: medical equipment industry is highly 
specialized. The manufacturer may only produce for 
certain equipment, thus a single goods package can 
restrict the participation of most manufactures. 
Option 2: one package with different lots 
Advantage:  both  small  and  large  contractors  or 
suppliers  can  bid  for  individual  contracts  or  for  a 
group of similar goods or works. manufactures can 
participate directly 
Disadvantage: time consulting on procurement and 
goods supply, hard for contract management 
Overall speaking, packaging different types of medical equipment into one package can increase the 
procurement scale and contract amount, thus facilitating the market competition. At the same time, it can 
reduce the duplication process in the procurement. Finally, with only one supplier awarded, it is easier 
for PMO and owners to manage the contract. 
However, placing all medical equipment under one contract package also has higher risks, including: 
(i) with low correlation between different equipment, the manufacturer has less possibility to win the bid 
by himself. (ii) the bid preparation and bidding process is time consuming. (iii) If procurement items vary 
a lot, the manufacturer cannot directly participate in the bidding, and only dealers can win the bid, which 
may reduce a higher cost. 
Therefore, it is necessary to ensure sufficient competition and efficiency through flexible packaging or 
introducing  different  lots  under  one  package.  The  package  (lots)  combination  must  be  scientific  and 
reasonable,  to  fully  understand  the  relevance  of  each  medical  equipment,  to  understand  the  product 
composition  of  the  manufacturers,  as  well  as  the  quality  of  equipment,  through  investigation  and 
research. 
For  the  medical  equipment  of  hospitals  at  township-level,  since  it  is  all  widely-used  and  low-tech 
equipment, to ensure the efficiency and reduce the working load of people, one single package for all 
medical equipment for hospital at township-level is recommended. 
During the preliminary design, a medical specialist and the owner of hospital shall participate into the 
design and preparation of bidding document. The final packaging of medical equipment may vary.  
(3)  Contract packaging for IT systems 
Option  1:  purchasing  equipment  separate  from  IT 
services 
Advantage: can recruit more specialized group on 
equipment, and system development separately, 
more competitiveness 
18

The information system for hospital is relatively complex, including both software and hardware, including 
follow-up  maintenance.  The  software  package  contains  system  software,  tool  software,  application 
software, etc., while the hardware includes PC, storage equipment, network equipment, etc.

Considering the professional knowledge and equipment supply with technical complex are required, and 
the importance to achieve the entire project objectives, therefore, smart hospital (hardware) and medical 
community  information  system  (software)  should  be  integrated  into  one  contract  to  attract  reputable 
suppliers,  integrated  database,  compatible  design,  and  consistent  culture  of  the  system  as  well  as 
competitive prices. 
Based on the market research (as can be seen form the appendix), there are enough potential bidders 
can provide both equipment and development on the smart hospital.

(1)  Consulting services – PMISC or individual consultant 
Option 1: PMISC 
Advantage: easy to manage, the quality can be 
ensured, can provide systematic service as needed 
Disadvantage: relatively higher cost 
Option 2: Individual consultant 
Advantage: relatively lower cost, shorter time on 
procurement 
Disadvantage: more working load for PMO, hard to 
provide systematic consulting service and 
knowledge sharing to PMO and IAs, poor 
communication between individual consultants. 
Based on the previous experience, qualified individual consultant is hard to recruited. And it will also add 
more pressure on PMO. And this project is quite complicated comparing with other domestic project, 
many consultants with different background is needed, such as medical, hospital construction, IT, etc. 
Thus option 1 is recommended

Option 2: QCBS (80:20, 70:30, 50:50). 
Advantage: relatively lower cost 
Disadvantage: higher risk on the quality of 
consultants 
QCBS method will be adopted for selection of PMISC, Pinggui Comprehensive Public health-care system 
study and design, and construction supervision unit. Also, the performance-based specifications (TOR – 
Terms of Reference) should be adopted. 
Quality and cost weightings are chosen based on complexity and impact of the assignment and typically 
range from 90% to 70% for quality. Since the quality of the consulting services is very important to ensure 
the proper service delivery with qualified consultants, and the task is quite complex, thus option 1 (90:10) 
is considered as more appropriate method.

SECTION 6: PROCUREMENT STRATEGY SUMMARY 
A. 
Advance Contracting and retroactive financing 
22. 
All  advance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  will  be  undertaken  in  conformity  with 
ADB Procurement Policy and Regulations (2017, as amended from time to time). The issuance 
of invitations to bid under advance contracting and retroactive financing will be subject to ADB 
approval. The borrower has been advised that approval of advance contracting and retroactive 
financing does not commit ADB to finance the project. 
23. 
Advance  contracting.  Advance  contracting  will  apply  to  the  specific  work  packages  as 
indicated in the initial procurement plan (W-KDS01 Mining site environment and surface water 
restoration,  W-KDS02  Mining  tailings  collection,  treatment,  and  disposal  in  landfill)  and  some 
consulting  packages  (CS1  Project  Management  and  Implementation  Support,  CS5  Start-up 
Consultants, and CS6 Construction supervision for all works). Advance contracting will include all 
procurement steps up till prior to contract award. 
24. 
Retroactive  financing.  The  maximum  number  of  eligible  expenditures  for  retroactive 
financing is up to the equivalent of 20% of the total ADB loan, incurred before loan effectiveness, 
but not more than 12 months before the signing of the loan agreement. Retroactive financing will 
apply to the advance contracting packages as indicated above and in the initial procurement plan. 
B.

• 
Procurement Packaging and Scheduling 
The indicative procurement plan has been prepared with the following assumptions: 
the  packages  distributions  provided  is  tentative  and  may  vary  as  per  the  requirement  of 
carrying out the program. 
•  The estimated contract value in the plan is based on the FSR which is tentative and may 
vary. 
•  The advertisement date mentioned for the packages are tentative and may be conducted 
earlier, or later, as per the requirement of the program. 
•  Consultancy service contracts will be prioritized to be procured as soon as possible. 
•  The  Estimated  Value  indicated  for  each  contract  package  will  also  be  impacted  with  the 
variation in the Exchange Rate. 
•  Non-ADB financed contracts will be listed in the procurement plan under a separate list from 
the ADB financed contracts.

Contract packaging for the main works, including the mining site environment and surface 
water  restoration,  Mining  tailings  collection,  treatment  and  disposal  in  landfill,  Access  roads, 
Pinggui Workers’ Hospital building civil engineering and installation engineering (including main 
structure, finishing, outdoor engineering, MEP, HVAC, elevators, and etc.), Health and elderly-
care  building,  Knowledge  and  skill  sharing  center,  were  done  to  reflect  the  most  appropriate 
contract  sizes,  procurement  method  and  bidding  procedure,  which  are  in  line  with  strategic 
priorities of the PMO to meet the different demands, locations, and construction time schedule. 
27. 
The market assessment confirms that these works are common in the PRC and the market 
is  highly  competitive  with  enough  contractors  with  general  contractor  licenses.  All  contracts’ 
packages  are  subject  to  post  review  (sampling)  except  that  the  first  package  of  each  type  of 
procurement  category  for  each  subproject.  Considering  about  the  risk  and  complexity,  the 
contract  package  Pinggui  Workers’  Hospital  will  be  subject  to  prior  review  of  ADB,  to  ensure 
correct procurement procedures and the quality of bidding documents. 
28. 
It is recommended that: 
•  National advertisement be adopted to all work contracts. 
•  Traditional DBB mode will be applied for all works, including the Pinggui Workers’ Hospital. 
•  There will be one integrated work package under the Pinggui Workers’ Hospital to ensure 
the coordination between each systems and to reduce the risk of management. 
•  The mining  site environment and surface water restoration, mining tailings collection and 
health/elderly-care building can be design-ready and procurement-ready. 
•  The Project Management and Implementation Support, the Construction supervision for all 
works, and start-up consultants can be advanced contracting. 
•  BIM technology is encouraged to be applied during the design, construction, and operation 
for the Pinggui Workers’ Hospital project. But a working mechanism on BIM management 
and data sharing shall be established. Meanwhile, a unified BIM platform shall be applied 
for all stakeholders. The owners should try to apply the Pinggui Workers’ Hospital as a BIM 
polit project in GZAR to receive the assistance from provincial level. 
Goods and Supply: 
The packaging for goods, including IT equipment for Pinggui Workers’ Hospital, medical 
29. 
equipment  for  Pinggui  Workers’  Hospital,  medical  equipment  for  hospital  at  township-level, 
elderly-care and rehabilitation equipment, Vocational training experiment and testing equipment 
for the knowledge sharing center. 
30. 
Based on market assessment, the Pinggui Workers’ Hospital IT equipment, elderly-care 
and rehabilitation equipment, training experiment and testing equipment, medical equipment for 
hospital at township-level to be procured are common in PRC and the market is competitive with 
enough suppliers. Therefore, OCB-AN will be applied for those contract packages. 
31. 
For medical equipment for Pinggui Workers’ Hospital, since some high-tech, international 
original  packaging  equipment  will  be  procured,  thus  OCB-AI  will  be  applied.  During  the 
procurement of medical equipment, due to the special nature of medical equipment, the design 
institute, Pinggui Health Bureau, the owner of hospital shall assist bidding agencies to improve 
Appendix 8

184 
Appendix 8 
D. 
Prequalification 
39. 
Prequalification  will  not  be  used  for  any  of  the  packages  of  works  and  goods  for  this 
project.  However,  consultant  shortlist  procedure  will  be  used  for  QCBS  contract  of  consulting 
service. 
E. 
Bidding Procedures 
The  bidding  procedures  for  works  and  goods  will  follow  a  one-stage,  one  envelope 
40. 
process (1S1E). 
41. 
The local and national e-procurement platforms will be used partially for e-publication only 
for all packages under the project, such as the China Tendering & Bidding Public Service Platform. 
F. 
Specifications 
42. 
Conformance technical specifications shall be prepared for works and goods. Items listed 
in  the  Bill  of  Quantities  shall  be  cross  referenced  with  the  relevant  clauses  of  the  technical 
specifications.  Technical  specifications:  clear  standards  for  civil  engineering,  and  specific 
inspection methods for the consistency of standards. For goods contracts, technical specifications 
should clearly describe their features. Technical specifications should also include requirements 
for environment, safety, and technical management information. 
43. 
A  unified  BIM  platform  shall  be  used  from  be  design  stage  to  operation  stage  for  the 
Pinggui Workers’ Hospital. The potential bidder shall have working experience on BIM and their 
key staffs shall have capacities or certificates on BIM. 
44. 
Equipment  performance  requirements  can  be  determined  by  the  results  of  consulting 
activities.  Requirements  for  installation,  operation  manual,  maintenance  and  training  needs 
should also be taken into consideration. 
For consulting services packages, Terms of Reference will be prepared by owner with the 
45. 
assistance of project management consulting firm. 
Green  procurement  may  introduce  specifications  relating  to  sustainability.  The  green 
46. 
procurement  requirements  shall  be  considered  during  the  procurement  process,  which  can 
potentially reduce environmental pollution, promote the launches of eco-friendly products, etc. As 
of June 2021, there is no clear definition of green procurement in the PRC. In the PRC, green 
procurement is a concept that is encouraged during government procurement. In the Government 
Procurement  Law,  it  says,  “the  government  procurement  should  contribute  to  the  objective  of 
national economic and social development, including environmental protection.” Meanwhile, the 
PRC  government  has  published  some  relevant  regulations  to  encourage  the  usage  of  energy 
saving equipment and green materials, including: “Opinions on the implementation of Government 
Procurement of Environmental label products,” “Basic requirements for government procurement 
of green buildings and green building materials (for trial implementation).” Those regulations give 
priority to products with environmental-friendly labels or energy saving labels during procurement. 
Internationally, many governments and organizations have published some regulations and laws 
about green procurement. A green procurement guideline will be prepared by the international 
procurement specialist to guide the green procurement practices under this ADB project by fully 
considering the existing domestic regulations and some international best practices and will be 
further submitted to HMG for its consideration in Hezhou. 
G. 
Review Requirements 
Appendix 8  
185 
Following the ADB Procurement Review: Guidance Note on Procurement Review (June 
47. 
2018, as amended from time to time) for (i) all ADB financed contracts with advance contracting, 
and (ii) the first ADB financed contract of each type (OCB advertised internationally or nationally) 
for works and goods, ADB’s prior review and approval will be required. 
48. 
To  avoid  procurement  risks,  the  packages  identified  as  high  risk,  including  the  Pinggui 
Workers’ Hospital building and installation engineering and the Pinggui Workers’ Hospital medical 
equipment,  will  be  prior  review,  to  ensure  the  quality  of  bidding  documents  and  all  consulting 
service contracts should be applicable with prior review. 
49. 
Other works and goods supply contracts will be subject to post review (sampling) and post 
procurement audits. Post review (sampling) will be conducted at annual project review missions 
by ADB or its consultants or on an ad hoc basis when necessary. 
H. 
Standstill Period 
50. 
In the PRC’s domestic bidding practice, as the provision of TBL, the publicity period should 
not less than three (3) days. And according to the Regulation on Implementation of the TBL, the 
bidder could make a complaint to the relevant supervision department within 10 days from the 
date it knows or should have known about the bidding activities do not conform to the provisions 
of laws and relevant regulations. 
51. 
The PRC-specific SBD (updated 2020) allows for standstill period for EA to choose as an 
option (e.g., national provision, ADB recommended provision, or none). Suitable provision shall 
be indicated in the Bid Data Sheet if such a provision is applicable. 
I. 
Standard Bidding Documents and Contract Forms 
52. 
Since this project is a loan project of ADB, according to the common practice in the PRC, 
all goods and works contracts for payment of ADB loans (see the procurement plan) are prepared 
in accordance with the PRC specific SBD (updated 2020) stipulated by ADB and the PRC Ministry 
of  Finance  (MOF).  In  terms  of  decentralized  rural  sewage  treatment  facilities  and  domestic 
garbage disposal facilities of this project, which are not construct-only contracts, which have been 
included  some  auxiliary  equipment  and  materials,  such  as  pumps,  valves,  pipes  and 
communication  cables,  etc.  are  combined  with  the  civil  engineering  to  generate  an  integrated 
contract  for  bidding.  In  this  case,  the  item  listed  in  the  BOQ  shall  be  taken  as  the  unit  of 
measurement and payment, and equipment supplied by the bidder shall be evaluated according 
to  the  requirements  of  the  technical  specifications.  In  addition,  the  bidding  documents  for 
consulting  contracts  are  compiled  according  to  ADB  standard  templates.  All  above-mentioned 
SBDs or templates can be used are as follows: 
•  PRC specific SBD for Works (updated in 2020); 
•  PRC specific SBD for Goods (updated in 2020); 
•  ADB Template for IT services SBD; 
•  ADB Template for RFQ Works; 
•  ADB Template for RFQ Goods; 
•  RFP Template for Time-based Consulting Services (QCBS 90:10 weights); and 
•  RFP Template for Lump Sum Consulting Services (CQS). 
186 
Appendix 8 
A green procurement specification will be developed during the project implementation, 
53. 
which shall be incorporated into the SBDs and contract. 
J. 
Pricing and Costing Methods 
54.  Mainly unit price/measurement costing is expected for BOQ-based contacts. Generally, 
the unit price contract based on BOQ is adopted in civil engineering. If the bill includes equipment, 
all the items in the bill of equipment are merged into the bill of quantities of civil engineering and 
paid by measurement. 
Abnormally low bid provisions will apply for all OCB packages to mitigate quality risk from 
55. 
potential substandard subcontracting. 
The  goods  packages  will  follow  ADB  standard  template  for  lump  sum  and  unit  price 
56. 
contract. 
Time-based contract is generally applied for consulting services. The pricing and costing 
57. 
method will be defined in the TOR. 
K. 
Key Performance Indicators 
As  part  of  the  contract  management  strategy,  the  PMO  will  identify  key  performance 
58. 
indicators (KPIs) for the whole project. Some of the KPIs for the projects are suggested below: 
•  The design readiness and procurement readiness percentage 
•  Mobilization of a procurement agent 
•  Mobilization  of  start-up  consultants,  construction  supervision,  PMISC,  and  external 
monitoring agencies 
•  Mobilize personnel on procurement and contract management 
•  The progress deviation between the actual bidding schedule and the procurement plan 
•  The cost deviation between contract amount awarded and estimate 
•  Green procurement specification established and applied 
•  The on time project completion within the contract period 
•  …… 
L. 
Evaluation Method 
59. 
Qualification criteria only ensure bidder with the appropriate professional, financial, and 
technical capacity to successfully perform the contract will be awarded the contract. Qualification 
requirements have been limited to those necessary to establish that a bidder has such capacity. 
Market knowledge allows preparing the qualification criteria based not only on the needs of the 
project but also on the possibilities of the targeted market. 
The bid evaluation method will be the lowest evaluated price with responsive bids for most 
60. 
ADB financed OCB goods and works packages as it well reflects the fairness and meeting the 
minimum criteria for the competence. 
Appendix 8  
187 
For  ADB  financed  consulting  services  on  construction  supervision,  PMISC,  design  and 
61. 
study  on  the  health-care  system  in  Pinggui,  the  weight  of  90:10  for  technical  and  financial 
proposals is adopted for QCBS method for consultancy services to reflect the importance of the 
technical competence, qualifications, and experiences in delivering the services. 
62.  Works and goods bids evaluation are to organize professional evaluation teams to assess 
all  bids  fairly  and  professionally,  to  choose  and  confirm  the  bidding  documents  that  fulfill  the 
requirements, and to complete all the works required by the contract in a timely and high-quality 
manner, more importantly, the green procurement requirements should be considered during the 
evaluation of bids. Appropriate evaluation criteria considering life cycle cost shall be established 
in the evaluation of bids, particularly critical mechanical items, such as HVAC. 
63.  Merit points will not be applied to our project at this moment. Once the MOF updates the 
SBDs and incorporates the merit point into the SBD, the merit point system will be included in the 
evaluation. 
M. 
Contract Management Approach 
64.  With  the  assistance  from  start-up  consultants,  a  detailed  contract  management  plan 
(CMP) for all contracts shall be in place prior to the implementation, which may include graphs or 
flowcharts  (with  the  time  frame)  that  will  illustrate  these  procedures  in  a  visual  form  (certain 
standard forms of contract provide such graphs). 
The  PMO  and  PIUs  are  complementing  its  contract  management  capabilities  by  hiring 
65. 
start-up consultants and the PMISC firm. 
N. 
Value for Money 
66. 
Strategic  procurement  planning  was  carried  out  to  identify  procurement  risks,  develop 
mitigating  measures,  review  procurement  options,  and  agree  on  fit-for-purpose  procurement 
arrangements. 
67. 
The  project will  achieve  value  for  money  through  its  procurement  processes.  From  the 
market and options assessment, it will aim to attract qualified bidders through the development 
and  adoptions  of  (i)  appropriate  evaluation  criteria  considering  about  life  cycle  cost  shall  be 
established  in  the  evaluation  of  bids,  particularly  critical  mechanical  items,  such  as  HVAC.; 
(ii) ensure  abnormally  low  bid  provisions  are  included  to  mitigate  quality  risk;  (iii)  use  OCB-
internationally advertised method for medical equipment to drive open competition from qualified 
contractors;  (iv)  separate  medical  equipment  into  different  packages  to  encourage  the 
participation of manufactures, instead of dealers only; (v) use the traditional DBB mode to ensure 
the  management  efficiency;  (vi)  the  application  of  green  procurement  can  reduce  the  energy 
consumption and cost for the building in the life cycle.
