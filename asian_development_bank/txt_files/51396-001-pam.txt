Introduction 
I.  PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
Coffee and Agroforestry Livelihood Improvement is an innovative project to improve the 
1. 
lives of Timor-Leste’s coffee farmers. The project will underpin implementation of Timor-Leste’s 
new Coffee Sector Development Plan and pilot a new model for delivering extension services to 
2,000 coffee farming households in the Aileu, Ainaro, Bobonaro, Ermera, Liquica, and Manufahi 
municipalities. These households will receive training on good agricultural practices for production 
of coffee and related crops and assistance with access to finance. The project will also provide 
indirect benefits to all coffee producers by strengthening industry management and supporting 
initiatives to improve coffee quality and strengthen linkages with key markets for specialty coffee. 
B.  
Project Rationale 
2. 
Improvements in coffee production and processing offer one of the clearest pathways for 
reducing  poverty  and  growing  Timor-Leste’s  non-oil  economy.  Coffee  is  Timor-Leste’s  largest 
non-oil export and is grown by 37.5% of all Timorese households with half of these households 
relying  on  the  crop  for  cash  income.  Despite  its  significance,  the  coffee  sector  is  currently 
operating far below its long-term potential. Production is low and volatile, quality is inconsistent, 
and sector management is weak. As a result, many coffee producing households live in extreme 
poverty.  Strengthening  sector  management  and  providing  targeted  support  to  smallholder 
producers can generate sustained increases in household income, reduce poverty and contribute 
to the growth of non-oil exports.  
3. 
There  is  a  long  history  of  coffee  production  in  Timor-Leste.  Development  of  the  sector 
began  in  the  1860s  and  was  initially  driven  by  establishment  of  large  private  and state-owned 
plantations. The importance of smallholder farmers increased steadily over time and by the 1970s 
they accounted for a majority of production. During 1975-1994 coffee marketing was consolidated 
into  a  government  backed  monopoly.  Prices  paid  to  farmers  during  this  time  were  low  and 
underinvestment  in  the  sector  led  to  a  steady  decline  in  production.  Beginning  in  1994,  and 
accelerating after Timor-Leste regained independence in 2002, coffee marketing was liberalized 
and the number of actors in the supply chain has increased. This has brought benefits to farmers 
but the extended period of under-investment means that yields remain low and volatile.  
4. 
Coffee in Timor-Leste is grown under the shade of larger trees that form continuous areas 
of forest. This agroforestry system provides a range of important ecosystem services. The shade 
trees stabilize the soils on steep slopes, increase the infiltration of rainfall to aquifers, sequester 
carbon,  and  provide  a  habitat  for  diverse  flora  and  fauna.  They  can  also  help  to  improve  soil 
fertility by fixing nitrogen and provide a source of timber and edible fruits. Other economic crops, 
including  foods  like  banana, taro,  and  arrowroot,  and  spices  such  as  ginger,  turmeric,  pepper, 
vanilla, and cloves can also be grown within this system. However, many coffee farmers do not 
make use of simple practices to ensure reliable production of coffee and other products. Coffee 
yields  are  among  the  lowest  in  the  world  but  implementation  of  a  simple  package  of  good 
agricultural practices can triple coffee yields. 
5. 
In  2019  the  Government  of  Timor-Leste  approved  a  comprehensive  long  term  plan  to 
modernize  Timor-Leste’s  coffee  sector.  The  National  Coffee  Sector  Development  Plan,  2019-
2030  (NCSDP)  was  prepared  with  support  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  the 
Coffee  Quality  Institute.    The  plan  prioritizes  the  welfare  of  smallholder  coffee  farmers  and 
emphasizes  evidence-based  decision  making,  social  and  environmental  sustainability, 
2 
collaboration  between  the  public  and  private  sectors,  and  inclusion  of  women  and  other 
disadvantaged  groups.  The  plan  targets  a  doubling  of  coffee  production  by  2030  and  a  270% 
increase  in  export  earnings.  To  achieve  these  goals,  the  NCSDP  plans  for  investment  of 
approximately  $38  million  during  2019-2030  to  fund  activities  under  six  core  focus  areas:  i) 
research  and  development;  ii)  production  and  productivity;  iii)  quality  and  value  addition;  iv) 
market  access;  v)  domestic  consumption  and  tourism;  and  vi)  sector  management  and 
coordination. Further information on the goals and activities under each focus area is provided 
below.  
6. 
Applied research and development is the foundation of any successful agricultural export 
industry.  However, there  is  currently  almost  no  applied  research  on  coffee  in  Timor-Leste  and 
research capacity in the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries (MAF) and other relevant agencies 
is  limited.  This  is  unfortunate  given  the  special  role  that  Timor-Leste  has  played  in  the 
development  of  coffee  production  around  the  world.  The  Hibrido  de  Timor  (HdT)  -  a  unique 
naturally occurring hybrid between the Arabica and Robusta coffee species - was discovered in 
Timor-Leste  in  1927  and  has  been  used  to  breed  new  coffee  varieties  that  are  now  grown  in 
almost every coffee producing country. Some of these improved varieties have been introduced 
in Timor-Leste but there is almost no information about which varieties are currently being grown 
and no systematic research to determine which coffee varieties will perform best in each of the 
country’s  agro-ecological  zones.  There  is  also  very  little  formal  research  to  assess  the 
performance  of  the  agricultural  technologies  and  practices  that  are  recommended  to  coffee 
farmers or analyze the socio-economic dimensions of coffee production and farmer welfare. 
7. 
The NCSDP includes several actions to strengthen applied research and to link this with 
farmer support programs. Using genetic fingerprinting to profile the range of coffee varieties that 
is currently being grown is an essential first step. ADB is supporting initial genetic analysis through 
an  ongoing  technical  assistance  project.    The  results  of  this  analysis  will  be  used  to  guide 
immediate  improvement  of  the  systems  for  production  and  distribution  of  coffee  seedlings  by 
helping to ensure purity and quality. Genetic analysis will also guide longer term efforts to map 
local genetic diversity and new local varieties. In addition to mapping and cataloging its existing 
genetic resources, Timor-Leste also plans to assess the suitability of coffee varieties from other 
countries and regions. The NCSDP includes a commitment for Timor-Leste to participate in two 
international  research  programs  that  have  been  designed  and  managed  by  World  Coffee 
Research  (WCR).  WCR’s  International  Mulit-Location  Variety  Trial  (IMLVT)  is  a  program  to 
evaluate the performance of 31 elite coffee varieties in a wide range of growing conditions. This 
program  is  currently  being  implemented  in  22  countries  and  results  from  the  trials  are  shared 
across participating countries. The IMLVT is complemented by WCR’s On Farm Technology Trial 
(OFTT) program. OFTT’s are farmer managed trials in which nine different combinations of coffee 
variety  and  agronomic  practice  are  implemented  on  a  farmer  managed  plot  for  up  to  5  years. 
OFTT’s are used to generate high quality data about the actual performance of different varieties 
and agronomic practices.  
8. 
Research and development will help to refine the package of technologies being offered 
to  coffee  farmers  but  the  system  for  transmitting  this  to  farmers  must  also  be  strengthened. 
Training by public extension officers and private companies has been poorly coordinated and well 
below the required levels. A 2011 survey of 825 households from the main coffee growing region 
of Timor-Leste found that only 14% had received training on coffee production during the past 4 
years.    The  NCSDP  aims  to  rectify  this  through  an  ambitious  program  to  expand  training  and 
extension,  rehabilitate  old  and  unproductive  coffee  farms,  and  facilitate  farmers  access  to 
supporting  services  such  as  banking.  Financial  services  are  important  because  income  from 
coffee production is highly seasonal. Households that lack access to formal financial services may 
3 
use informal mechanisms to smooth their consumption but a 2011 survey found that 45% of coffee 
producing households significantly reduced their food consumption in the months preceding the 
harvest, with half of the surveyed households eating one or less meals per day.   Hunger, and the 
need to seek other sources of cash income, are likely to constrain household labor input during 
the  pre-harvest  period  and  discourage  the  adoption  of  new  technologies.  Because  of  this,  the 
NCSDP  includes  several  activities  to  help  coffee  farmers  access  formal  financial  services  to 
facilitate saving and enable access to credit.  
Women play an important role in coffee production in Timor-Leste and are highly involved 
9. 
in  all  stages  of  production.  However,  women’s contribution  to  coffee  is often  overlooked.  Male 
household leads may assume responsibility for representing the household in farmer groups and 
cooperatives  and  receiving  income  from  the  household’s  coffee  sales.  Experience  from  other 
projects to support the coffee sector in Timor-Leste shows that it is important for training to be 
provided to all ‘active farmers’ within a household, including women. However, women are likely 
to be under-represented in formal training and extension activities unless very deliberate actions 
are taken to address the social and time pressures that prevent them from attending training. 
10. 
Timor-Leste  currently  exports  most  of  its  coffee  as  a  commodity-grade  product  with 
minimal  differentiation.  However,  global  demand  for  differentiated  specialty  coffees  is  growing 
rapidly and this provides a significant opportunity for Timor-Leste to achieve better export prices. 
High quality is a defining feature of specialty coffee and the NCSDP includes activities to refine 
local technologies for coffee processing, provide training and support to coffee producers, and 
design  and  implement  policies  to  encourage  quality  improvement.  These  policies  will  include 
development of a common framework for measuring quality at each stage of processing and the 
introduction  of  quality-based  pricing mechanisms  that  provide  farmers  with  clear  incentives for 
quality improvement.  
11. 
Recent  analysis  has  highlighted  several  factors  that  influence  the  relationship  between 
coffee  quality  and  pricing  including  supply  chain  transparency,  product  traceability,  and  the 
knowledge and perception of value chain partners and consumers.  The NCSDP aims to improve 
Timor-Leste’s access to specialty coffee markets and to increase the value of Timorese coffees 
by making the supply chain more transparent, improving traceability, and using carefully targeted 
marketing to stimulate demand. Under the NCSDP, promotion of Timorese coffees in consuming 
markets will be reinforced by development of the domestic market for coffee consumption and 
coffee related tourism. Festival Kafe Timor, is one example of these linkages. Since 2016, this 
annual  festival  has  supported  the  development  of  Timor-Leste’s  coffee  sector  through 
competitions that encourage and celebrate excellence and events that celebrate the history and 
culture of coffee production in Timor-Leste.  
12. 
The success of initiatives to upgrade production, improve quality, and develop specialty 
markets  hinges  on  close  coordination  across  the  value  chain  and  between  government,  the 
private  sector  and  other  stakeholders.  During  1999-2015  numerous  studies  and  assessments 
identified  weak  coordination  as  a  constraint  to  developing  the  coffee  sector  in  Timor-Leste.  In 
2016,  following  an  initiative  from  ADB,  a  group  of  stakeholders  representing  all  stages  of  the 
coffee value chain came together to form the Timor Coffee Association (ACT).  Since 2016 ACT 
has  organized  a  wide  range  of  activities  including  the  annual  festival  and  coffee  quality 
competitions,  establishment  of  a  coffee  quality  lab,  and  training  programs  to  help  farmers  to 
improve quality. ACT works closely with MAF and other government agencies and was one of the 
main contributors to development of the NCSDP. Representatives from MAF and ACT co-chair a 
special taskforce which meets on a quarterly basis to coordinate implementation of the plan and 
ACT is responsible for leading implementation of some activities under the plan.  
4 
13.  While productivity improvement is a key focus of the NCSDP, some of the key foundations 
of  an  effective  national  system  for  farm  rehabilitation  are  still  being  established.  MAF  has  a 
network  of  extension  workers  at  Suco  level  but  these  staff  are  responsible  for  supporting 
production for all crops, livestock, and aquaculture. This is an extremely challenging mandate and 
it is generally accepted that extension services need to be improved. MAF has identified training 
partnerships  with  NGOs  and  private  businesses as  a model  with  excellent  potential.  However, 
there is currently no shared system for tracking the replanting and rehabilitation of coffee farms 
or  the  provision  of  training.  There  is  also  no  established  system  for  engaging  businesses  and 
NGOs  to  implement  public  funded  programs.  This  makes  it  difficult  to  assess  resource 
requirements, plan and implement rehabilitation and training programs, evaluate the efficacy of 
different training models, and maximize the returns on public investment.  
14. 
Under  the  NCSDP,  MAF  has  committed  to  developing  an  ICT  based  farm  information 
system to track the delivery of training and support to smallholder coffee farmers. This system will 
facilitate  the  outsourcing  of  some  training  and  extension  services  and  management  of  other 
activities that are planned under the NCSDP. ADB is currently providing technical assistance to 
Olam,  a  large  multinational  commodity  trader,  to  support  the  initial  deployment  of  the  Olam 
Farmer  Information  System  (OFIS)  in  Timor-Leste.  Deployment  of  OFIS  will  generate  useful 
lessons to inform development of a national farm information system and Olam could consider 
licensing OFIS for use across the whole of the coffee sector.  
15. 
Development  of  the  coffee  sector  is  a  clear  national  priority.  It  is  highlighted  in  Timor-
Leste’s Strategic Development Plan 2011-2030 and features prominently in the program of Timor-
Leste’s VIIIth Constitutional Government 2018-2023. Development of the non-oil economy is the 
overarching goal of ADB’s Timor-Leste Country Partnership Strategy 2016-2020 and the strategy 
identified the coffee sector as an area with notable potential. The project was included in ADB’s 
country  operations  and  business  plan  for  Timor-Leste  for  2020-2022  and  responds  to  clear 
demand from the Government of Timor-Leste and industry stakeholders.  
16. 
The  project  is  designed  to  leverage  some  of  the  activities  that  are  being  implemented 
through  a  related  non-sovereign  investment  and  technical  assistance  project.  It  also  builds  on 
previous initiatives and incorporates lessons learned from completed and ongoing projects in the 
coffee  sector.  The  project’s  training  approach  has  been  informed  by  lessons  learned  from 
investments  in  coffee  farm  rehabilitation  that  have  been  financed  by  the  Government  of  New 
Zealand and implemented by the National Cooperative Business Association of America. Grant 
financing is proposed because the project will trial several innovative approaches to addressing 
long-standing  sector  challenges  and  is  expected  to  have  a  substantial  positive  impact  on  the 
livelihoods of participating households. 
C. 
Impact and Outcome 
17. 
The impact is a doubling of coffee production by 2030 and a 270% increase in the value 
of coffee exports.  The outcome will be improved productivity and price realization in the coffee 
sector. The project has three outputs.  
D. 
Outputs and Key Activities 
18. 
Output 1. More productive coffee and agroforestry production systems established. 
The project will strengthen the systems for producing and distributing planting materials and will 
pilot  a  new  model  for  delivering  extension  services  to  smallholder  coffee  farmers.  This  will  be 
5 
achieved  through  i)  development  and  implementation  of  improved  protocols  for  seed  selection 
and  nursery  management  ii)  establishment  of  at  least  one  multi-variety  trial  and  ten  farmer 
managed demonstration research and plots; and ii) delivery of a 2.5 -year training program on 
productivity improvement and improved farm management to 2,000 coffee producing households. 
The project will strengthen the seed sector by completing the genetic profiling of locally available 
varieties,  analyzing  the  most  suitable  varieties  for  each  major  agro-ecological  zone  and 
implementing  actions  to  strengthen  nursery  management  and  ensure  the  integrity  of  the  seed 
supply.  The  multi-variety  research  site  and farmer-managed research  and  demonstration  plots 
will form part of a new national network and will serve as local hubs for delivering training and 
showcasing improved practices. The design of the plots will be consistent with best practices for 
farm  level  demonstration  in  Timor-Leste  and  each  plot  will  be  managed  by  a  local  community 
member with support from MAF and the project implementation partners.1 The training program 
for  households  will  span  three  coffee  harvests  thus  providing three  opportunities to  implement 
pruning and coffee plant-rejuvenation immediately following completion of the coffee harvest. The 
project will deliver provide training to coffee farmers who have not received training through recent 
and ongoing projects and will apply a community level screening tool to select the locations where 
training  will  be  offered. The technical  specialists  engaged through the  project  will  help  MAF to 
provide  a  suite  of  recommended  best  practices  and  associated  training  materials.  These  best 
practices and training materials will form a menu of options that can be tailored according to farm 
location  and  conditions  and  the  priorities  of  participating  households.    Households  will  be 
empowered to exercise agency in selecting the trainings and activities that they judge to be most 
relevant to their situation. Project support to farm households will also promote improved financial 
literacy and financial inclusion. This will be achieved through partnerships with financial service 
providers  and  by  encouraging  the  companies  that  procure  coffee  directly  from  smallholders  to 
work more closely with banks and microfinance institutions.2  
19. 
Output 2. Coffee quality and market linkages improved. The project will help industry 
stakeholders to design and implement a program to improve coffee quality and market linkages. 
This will be done through i) design and implementation of a national grading system for coffee 
cherries  and  parchment;  ii)  continuation  of  the  annual  Festival  Kafe  Timor  coffee  quality 
competitions and associated communication and training for farmers; and iii) development and 
implementation of a coffee industry marketing plan to provide comprehensive product information 
to key consuming markets. The grading system will provide a simple set of standards to support 
rapid evaluation of the quality of fresh coffee cherries and dried coffee parchment using simple 
and readily available equipment. Companies that procure coffee in cherry and parchment form 
will  be  encouraged  to  incorporate  the  new  standards  into  their  procurement  practices  and  to 
provide  a  clear  linkage  between  quality  and  price.  Dissemination  of  the  standards  and  their 
adoption by coffee buyers will help to reduce information asymmetries between coffee farmers 
and buyers and provide clearer incentives for quality improvements. The project will support the 
coffee quality competition that is a key part of the annual coffee festival and will fund associated 
communication with farmers on quality improvement. Other festival activities are expected to be 
supported by other sponsors. The project will also help to develop an industry marketing plan to 
1 Coffee Quality Institute. 2018. Baseline Assessment and Gap Analysis of Systems for Training Extension Workers 
and Delivering Extension Services to Farmers. Dili.The broad principles are: i) manageable plot size – the plot should 
not be so big that it cannot be managed using the labor resources available within the household that is responsible 
for the plot; ii) replicability -  the treatments and overall design should enable replication in other locations; iii) use of 
comparable treatments – differentiated use of treatments within the plot should enable ordinary observers to clearly 
see  the  incremental  impacts  of  specific  treatments;  iv)  relatable  –  the  plot  should  resemble  the  conditions  and 
characteristics of coffee farms in the surrounding community to maximize perceived relevance.  
2 A partnership may take the form of a non-binding memorandum of understanding between the entities delivering the 
training and financial service providers. 
6 
help Timor-Leste to identify target markets, develop a clear and consistent message about the 
positive attributes of Timorese coffees and provide timely information to consumers.  
20. 
Output 3. Sector management and coordination improved. The project will work with 
MAF  and  ACT  to  strengthen  information  management,  ensure  that  sector  activities  are  well 
coordinated,  and  promote  knowledge  sharing  and  exchange.  This  will  be  achieved  through  i) 
strengthening  of  the  secretariat  coordinating  implementation  of  the  NCSDP;  ii)  design  and 
implementation  of  a farm  information  management  system;  iii)  implementation  of  a knowledge 
sharing platform for the coffee sector. The NCSDP secretariat will be housed in MAF and will help 
to  coordinate  the  quarterly  meetings  of  the  NCSDP  implementation  taskforce  and  other  data 
collection and reporting for the NCSDP. The farm information management system will leverage 
information  communications  technology  to  improve  the  quality  and  efficiency  of  support  to 
smallholder  farmers  and  support  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  activities  under  Output  1.  The 
potential to use or adapt an existing system such as OFIS will be considered before design of a 
new  system  commences.  At  a  minimum,  the  system  will  capture  data  about  the  geographical 
location  of  each  household  and  farm  being  supported  through  the  project,  the  demographic 
profiles of active farmers, and the trainings provided under the project. If possible, the scope of 
the system will be made broader so that it can integrate information on support to smallholder 
farmers that is being provided through other channels, and can support other capabilities such as 
the traceability needed for some forms of product certification. The knowledge sharing platform 
will  provide  a  mechanism  for  improved  flow  of  information  between  sector  stakeholders. 
Convened by MAF and ACT, the platform will be open to all interested parties and will be designed 
to  accelerate  the  identification  and  dissemination  of  improved  practices  relating  to  coffee 
production,  processing,  quality  improvement,  etc.  Industry  stakeholders  will  be  encouraged  to 
share  their  own  experiences  through  the  platform  and  this  will  be  supplemented  by  external 
expertise to help to address shared priorities relating to production and quality improvement.

D.  Project Management  
22. 
The project will be implemented over 4 years from June 2020 to June 2024. MAF will be 
the executing agency and will establish a PMU in its National Directorate for Coffee and Industrial 
Crops  (DNCPI)  to  ensure  successful  project  implementation.  A  streamlined  PIU  will  be 
established  in  ACT  to  support  implementation  of  selected  project  outputs.  A  project  steering 
committee will provide guidance and quality assurance for project implementation.  
Project  Management  Unit.    The  PMU  will  comprise  staff  and  consultants  and  a 
23. 
supporting firm or non-government organization. The PMU will be responsible for daily running of 
the project including planning, implementation administration, financial management, monitoring 
and reporting. It will have direct responsibility for delivery of project outputs 1a-d and 3a-b and 
will coordinate and oversee the implementation of Outputs 2a-c and 3c by the ACT PIU.3  The 
PMU will be staffed by three full time national consultants recruited for the project, one or more 
part  time  consultants  and  MAF  counterparts.    The  PMU  will  be  supported  by  a  firm  or  non-
government organization (NGO) that will provide 44 months of international consultant inputs and

and consultants.  
24. 
Project Implementation Unit.  The PIU at ACT will be responsible for day-to-day running 
of  the  project  activities  for  output  2a-c  and  3c.  The  PIU  will  comprise  one  full  time  consultant 
recruited for the project and ACT counterparts and will be supported by a specialized firm or NGO 
that will provide 8 months of international consultant inputs to support the outputs delivered by 
the  PIU.    The  PIU  will  coordinate,  manage  contractors  and  consultants,  and  support 
implementation and administration of the project activities relevant for output 2a, 2b, 2c and 3c.  
The PIU will work closely with PMU and provide regular progress reports to PMU.

25. 
firms,  non-government 
organizations or other entities will be contracted to support project implementation. One firm will 
be  engaged  to  provide  56  person  months  of  consulting  inputs  to  the  PMU  to  support 
implementation  of  outputs  1a-d  and  3a-b.  This  firm  will  be  recruited  through  quality-  and cost-
based selection with simplified technical proposals. The second firm will provide 8 person months 
of international consultant inputs to the PIU to support implementation of outputs 2a-c and 3b and 
will be recruited using consultants’ qualification selection (CQS). A third specialized entity will be 
recruited to provide specific support on research and demonstration using consultant qualification 
selection.  Procurement  and  recruitment  of  consultants  will  be  conducted  in  accordance  with 
ADB’s Procurement Policy and Regulations (2017, as amended from time to time). 
26. 
Project  steering  committee.  A  project  steering  committee  will  be  established  for  the 
duration  of  the  project.  It  will  meet  at  least  semi-annually  to  review  and  monitor  project 
implementation and its plans and advise on project-related policy matters. It will be chaired by the 
Director General of Forestry and will include the MAF Project Director, and representatives from 
ACT,  ADB,  the  Embassy  of  Japan,  and  the  Ministry  of  Finance.  Where  relevant  other 
development partners and private sector stakeholders will be invited to participate as observers. 
IV. 
COST AND FINANCING 
A.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan 
The  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $3.2  million  (Table  1).    The  JFPR  will  provide  grant 
27. 
financing equivalent to $3.0 million to be administered by ADB. Some taxes and duties have been 
included in the base cost. The executing agency will provide in-kind counterpart support in the 
form of office space, workshop and training venues, and staff time for project implementation and 
monitoring.

 Source: ADB staff estimates  
The executing and implementing agencies, a project design team and ADB project team 
28. 
prepared the cost estimates and financing plan. For any proposed revisions to the project budget 
during project implementation, the Government of Timor-Leste will submit a request for project 
cost reallocation to ADB for review and endorsement. If the revision is endorsed, the PMU will 
revise the cost estimates under the guidance of ADB project officer. 
29. 
Exceptional  one-off  approval  from  the  Government  of  Japan  for  two  project 
vehicles.    Cost  estimates  include  the  purchase  of  two  cars  for  project  use.  There  is  strong 
justification  for  purchase  of  vehicles:  (i)  project  activities  include  establishment  of  at  least  one 
multi-location variety trial and ten demonstration plots and training of active farmers from 2,000 
households across six municipalities; (ii) the project is employing a participatory approach and 
most of the activities will be conducted directly with coffee farmers in the municipalities and will 
require supervision by PMU staff and consultants who will need frequent access to the field; (iii) 
public transportation to remote areas is extremely limited due to continued problems with road 
quality; and (iv) vehicle rental over 4 years will be more expensive than purchase. Upon project 
completion and in accordance with ADB guidelines, the project vehicles will be handed over to 
MAF.  Specific details will be determined at the completion of the project along with justification 
for ADB and the JFPR. 
Administrative budget support. Administrative budget support of 3% of the total grant 
30. 
amount ($90,000), exclusive from the project grant, will be provided in recognition of the technical 
complexity  of  the  project  and  the  geographical  scope  of  the  project  (establishing  farm-level 
demonstration activities and delivering training in up to 40 remote communities spread across five 
mountainous municipalities). This additional resources for project administration will be funded 
from the JFPR administrative budget rather than from the project grant. The administrative budget 
support  will  be  used  to  (i)  engage  a  national  staff  consultant  to  support  initial  project  start  up 
activities, provide support to the ADB project officer and MAF and ensure that initial activities are 
completed on time and to the required standards;  (ii) engage an international staff consultant to 
provide technical expertise for project review missions and on-demand advice and support to the 
project officer; (iii) produce and disseminate knowledge products including a video-case study.  
 The administrative support budget will be used to recruit a technical specialist to advise 
31. 
on  the  implementation  of  project  activities  related  to  farm  productivity  improvement  as  these 
activities account for a majority of the project budget and will have the most immediate and direct 
impact  on  poverty  reduction.  If  the  specialist  that  is  recruited  also  has  skills  and  experience 
relating  to  coffee  quality  and  marketing,  then  they  may  also  be  asked  to  advise  on  the 
implementation of these activities. 
32. 
The special administrative budget support will be administered by ADB. The processing 
and implementing project officer will manage and track the utilization of the administration budget 
support  and  will  provide  the  Strategy,  Policy  and  Partnerships  Department  and  the  Partners 
Funds Division  (SDPF) with an annual update on its utilization. Any deviation from the proposed 
expenditures should be consulted with, and endorsed by .

FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT 
A.  Financial Management Assessment 
As part of the project due diligence, a financial management assessment (FMA) of MAF, DNCPI 
36. 
and ACT was undertaken in accordance with ADB’s Guidelines for Financial Management Assessment 
and  ADB’s  Financial  Due  Diligence,  a  methodology  note,  and  Technical  Guidance  Note:  Financial 
Management Assessment. MAF will be the executing agency for the project.  
37. 
The FMA was conducted through interviews, review of artefacts and analysis of information. 
ADB’s FMA questionnaire was used as the basis for discussions. The scope of the FMA was to assess 
the  financial  management  capacity  of  the  executing  agency  and  implementing  agencies.  The 
assessment included a review of fund-flow arrangements, staffing, accounting policies and procedures, 
internal  and  external  auditing  arrangements,  reporting  and  monitoring,  and  financial  information 
systems.  A  summary  of  the  Financial  Management  and  Internal  Control  risks  that  were  identified 
through the FMA is presented in table 12 below.

staff are encouraged to avail of this training to help ensure efficient disbursement and fiduciary control. 
Advance fund procedure. A separate advance account should be established and maintained 
40. 
by  MAF for  the  project  in  collaboration  with MOF.    The  currency  of the advance  account  is the US 
dollar.  The advance account is to be used exclusively for ADB’s share of eligible expenditures.  MAF 
will establish the advance account in its name and is accountable and responsible for proper use of 
advances  to  the  advance  account.  Requests  by  the  executing  agency  for  initial  advance  and 
subsequent replenishments  of the  advance  account  will  be  supported  by  withdrawal  applications to 
ADB  and  will  be  based  on  the  executing  agency’s  estimate  of  ADB’s  share  of  eligible  project 
expenditures for up to, and not exceeding, the next 6 months, supported by a 6-month activity plan and 
Estimate  of  Expenditure  Sheet.5  Subsequent  applications  for  account  replenishment  will  be 
accompanied by a Summary Sheet, as well as the advance account reconciliation statement. 
41. 
The total outstanding advance to the advance account should not exceed $100,000. Supporting 
documents  should  be  submitted  to  ADB  and  retained  by  MAF  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  Loan

advance account. 
42. 
Before the submission of the first withdrawal application, MOF should submit to ADB sufficient 
evidence of the authority of the person(s) who will sign the withdrawal applications on behalf of the 
government,  together  with  the  authenticated  specimen  signatures  of  each  authorized  person.  The 
minimum value per withdrawal application is in accordance with the Loan Disbursement Handbook. 
Individual payments below this amount should be paid (i) by MAF and subsequently claimed to ADB 
through  reimbursement,  or  (ii)  through  the  advance  fund  procedure,  unless  otherwise  accepted  by 
ADB.  The  recipient  should  ensure  sufficient  category  and  contract  balances  before  requesting 
disbursements.    Use  of  ADB’s  Client  Portal  for  Disbursements  (CPD)6  system  is  encouraged  for 
submission of withdrawal applications to ADB.  
43. 
The  withdrawal  application  for  advances  or  replenishments  to  the  advance  account    will  be 
prepared  in  the  currency  of  the  advance  account  i.e.,  US  dollars.  Withdrawal  applications  for 
reimbursement and direct payment will be made in the currency in which the cost of goods and services 
has been paid or is payable. Withdrawal applications will be co-signed by the project director and MOF. 
The  initial  advance  will  be  prepared  by  the  project  director.  Thereafter,  once  the  PMU  project 
coordinator  and  finance  specialist  have  been  recruited,  the  PMU  will  prepare  the  withdrawal 
applications for review and co-signing by the project director and MOF. The schematic fund flow for 
the project is in the PAM section IV.G.Treasury Management.  The PMU will administer the financial 
resources of the Project through effective cash management and timely replenishment of the advance 
account.    The  PMU  will  prepare  cashflow  forecasts  to  ensure  liquidity  in  the  advance  account  is 
maintained.

C.  Accounting  
51. 
The PMU and PIUs will maintain, or cause to be maintained, separate books and records by 
funding source for all expenditures incurred on the project. For their respective components, the PMU 
and  PIUs  will  follow  the  cash  basis  of  accounting  which  are  broadly  based  on  the  cash-basis 
International Public Sector Accounting Standards. 
26 
D.  Auditing and Public Disclosure 
52. 
The  PMU  and  PIUs  will  cause  the  detailed  project  financial  statements  to  be  audited  with 
International Standards on Auditing or International Standards for Supreme Audit Institutions and with 
the government's audit regulations, by an independent auditor acceptable to ADB. The audited project 
financial  statements  together  with  the  auditors’  opinion  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  by  MAF  within  6 
months of the end of the fiscal year. All audit reports will be written in English.  
The annual audit report for the project accounts will include an audit management letter and 
53. 
audit opinions which cover (i) whether the project financial statements present a true and fair view or 
are  presented  fairly,  in  all  material  respects,  in  accordance  with  the  applicable  financial  reporting 
framework; (ii) whether grant proceeds were used only for the purposes of the project or not; and (iii) 
the level of compliance for each financial covenant contained in the legal agreements for the project. 
54. 
Compliance  with  financial  reporting  and  auditing  requirements  will  be  monitored  by  review 
missions  and  during  normal  program  supervision,  and  followed  up  regularly  with  all  concerned, 
including the external auditor. 
55. 
The  government,  MAF  and  DNCPI  have  been  made  aware  of  ADB’s  approach  to  delayed 
submission, and the requirements for satisfactory and acceptable quality of the audited project financial 
statements.7 ADB reserves the right to require a change in the auditor or for additional support to be 
provided to the auditor, if the audits required are not conducted in a manner satisfactory to ADB, or if 
the audits are substantially delayed. ADB reserves the right to verify the project's financial accounts to 
confirm that the share of ADB’s financing is used in accordance with ADB’s policies and procedures. 
56.

VI. 
PROCUREMENT AND CONSULTING SERVICES 
A.  Advance Contracting  
57. 
All advance contracting will be undertaken in conformity with ADB’s Procurement Policy and 
Regulations  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  their  associated  Staff  Instructions.9  The 
issuance  of  invitations  to  bid  under  advance  contracting  will  be  subject  to  ADB  approval.  MAF  and 
MOF have been advised that approval of advance contracting does not commit ADB to finance the 
project. 
7 ADB approach and procedures regarding delayed submission of audited project financial statements:  
(i)  When audited project financial statements are not received by the due date, ADB will write to the executing agency 
advising that (i) the audit documents are overdue; and (ii) if they are not received within the next 6 months, requests 
for new contract awards and disbursement such as new replenishment of advance accounts, processing of new 
reimbursement, and issuance of new commitment letters will not be processed. 
(ii)  When  audited  project  financial  statements  have  not  been  received  within  6 months  after  the  due  date,  ADB  will 
withhold processing of requests for new contract awards and disbursement such as new replenishment of advance 
accounts,  processing  of  new  reimbursement,  and  issuance  of  new  commitment  letters.  ADB  will  (i)  inform  the 
executing agency of ADB’s actions; and (ii) advise that the loan may be suspended if the audit documents are not 
received within the next 6 months. 
(iii)  When audited project financial statements have not been received within 12 months after the due date, ADB may 
suspend the loan.

Advance contracting. Advance contracting of consulting services is planned to enable early 
commencement  of  project  activities  following  grant  effectiveness.  The  advertisement,  shortlisting, 
evaluation, and consultant selection committee recommendations under advance contracting will be 
completed  according  to  the  matrix  of  procurement  responsibilities  presented  in  Appendix  1.  The 
government and the executing agency have been advised that approval of advance contracting prior 
to signing of the grant agreement does not commit ADB to financing the project. Retroactive financing 
will not be utilized under the project. 
B.  Procurement of Goods, Works, and Consulting Services 
All procurement of goods and works will be undertaken in accordance with ADB’s Procurement 
59. 
Policy  (2017,  as  amended  from time to time)  and  the  Procurement  Regulations  for  ADB  Borrowers 
(2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  their  associated  Staff  Instructions.  The  purpose  of  the 
Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers is to inform those carrying out a project that is financed 
in  whole  or  in  part  by  way  of  an  investment  loan  from  ADB,  ADB-financed  grant,  or  by  ADB-
administered funds of the policies and procedures that govern the procurement of goods, works, and 
nonconsulting and consulting services required for the project. The PMU, on behalf of the MAF, will be 
responsible for procurement. The selection and engagement of contractors for works and/or consulting 
services to be financed by the grant will be subject to ADB approval with ADB providing support for 
procurement as per the matrix of procurement responsibilities presented in Appendix 1. 
Before  the  start  of  any  procurement,  ADB  and  the  government  will  review  the  public 
60. 
procurement laws  to ensure consistency with ADB’s procurement  policy. 
61. 
Shopping will be used for procurement of equipment estimated to cost over $10,000 equivalent 
and  less  than  $100,000  equivalent.  Direct  contracting  will  be  used  for  goods  and  services  supply 
contracts valued $10,000 or below. 
62. 
All consultants and nongovernment organizations (NGOs), will be recruited according to ADB’s 
Procurement Policy and Regulations (2017, as amended from time to time) and their associated Staff 
Instructions.10 The terms of reference for all consulting services are detailed in Section D. 
63. 
An 18-month procurement plan indicating threshold and review procedures, goods, works, and 
consulting  service  contract  packages  has  been  prepared.  The  plan  describes  the  procurement 
methods  and review  procedures,  and  contract  packages for  goods,  works,  and  consulting  services. 
Any  necessary  modifications  or  clarifications  to  the  recipient  procurement  procedures  will  be 
documented in the procurement plan 
An  estimated  262  person-months  (56  international,  206  national)  of  consulting  services  are 
64. 
required to (i) facilitate project management and implementation, and (ii) strengthen the institutional 
and operational capacity of the executing agency. Consulting firms will be engaged using the quality- 
and  cost-based  selection  (QCBS)  method  with  a  standard  quality–cost  ratio  of  90:10  or  where 
appropriate, the consultants qualification selection (CQS) method.

SAFEGUARDS 
Environment (category C). The project is categorized as C for environmental safeguards. Under 
65. 
ADB’s Safeguard Policy Statement (SPS, 2009), only activities likely to have minimal or no adverse 
environmental impacts will be implemented under the project. No environmental assessment report is 
required  for  category  C  projects,  although  environmental  aspects  will  be  considered  as  part  of  the 
standard preparatory activities for each project component.  
66. 
Involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples (category C). No involuntary resettlement or 
land acquisition is envisaged, as the farming activities will be conducted on existing farm lands owned 
by beneficiary households. There are no communities of distinct and vulnerable indigenous peoples 
as  defined  under  ADB  SPS  living  in  the  project  sucos,  as  confirmed  by  due  diligence  and  national 
census  data.  The  project  does  not  trigger  the  SPS  requirements  on  involuntary  resettlement  and 
indigenous peoples. 
67. 
Prohibited  activities.  Pursuant  to  ADB's  SPS  (2009)  ADB  funds  may  not  be  applied  to  the 
activities described on the ADB Prohibited Investment Activities List set forth at Appendix 5 of the SPS. 
All project activities will comply with applicable national laws and regulations. 
VIII. 
GENDER AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS 
Poverty and social impacts. The project is designed to support inclusive growth and poverty 
68. 
reduction.  Key  considerations  and  design  elements  to  support  achievement  of  this  objective  are 
described in the project’s summary poverty reduction and social strategy (SPRSS) and summarized 
below.  
69. 
Profiling and selection of beneficiaries. Data from the 2015 national census has been used 
to profile the main characteristics of coffee producing households, including household composition 
and  educational  attainment,  productive  activities,  income,  and  asset  ownership.  This  profiling  has 
confirmed  that  most  commercial  coffee  producers  exhibit  characteristics  associated  with  poverty 
through low or volatile income or other non-income dimensions that are typically considered in multi-
dimensional poverty measures. Consultations with coffee producers during preparation of the National 
Coffee Sector Development Plan confirmed strong demand for additional training and support that is 
37 
focused on productivity improvement, quality improvement, and diversification. This was reconfirmed 
through extensive community consultations on the project design.  
70. 
The  selection  of  Aileu,  Ainaro,  Bobonaro,  Ermera,  Liquica,  and  Manufahi,  as  target 
municipalities  was  confirmed  during  project  preparation.  There  are  121  sucos  within  these 
municipalities with significant concentrations of commercial coffee farmers.11 The project is expected 
to deliver training in 20-40 of these sucos. The final selection of target sucos will be made by MAF with 
support  from  project  consultants  with  the  aim  of  i)  ensuring  coordination  with  recently  completed, 
ongoing,  and  planned  training  activities;    ii)  targeting  support  to  the  poorest  and  least  served 
commercial  coffee  farmers;  and  iii)  ensuring  the  overall  feasibility  and  efficiency  of  project 
implementation.  
Participatory  approach  to  implementation.  The  project  design  is  rooted  in  strong 
71. 
participation  of  local  households.  Opportunities  to  promote  participation  in  project  activities  were 
identified  during  consultations  with  potential  beneficiaries  and  two  distinct  channels  have  been 
confirmed. Firstly, the training that is provided to coffee producing households will be delivered using 
participatory approaches. Training service providers will be guided on community engagement and the 
use of participatory approaches. They will be expected to work with beneficiaries to identify learning 
priorities and develop an overall training plan and calendar of activities that responds to these priorities. 
The knowledge sharing platform that will be implemented by ACT under output 3 is also designed to 
promote  stakeholder  participation.  Training  service  providers  will  be  encouraged  to  share  their 
experiences and learnings through this platform. Project stakeholders will be encouraged to identify 
knowledge gaps and priorities to be addressed through the platform.  
Gender. The participation of women in project activities is critical for delivery of project outputs 
72. 
and achievement of the project outcome. The project is classified as effective gender mainstreaming. 
A gender action plan (GAP) has been prepared for the project and features 12 actions and 19 indicators 
relating to gender inclusion. A summary of the GAP is presented in table 13 below. A desktop review 
of relevant literature confirmed that women play a very important role in households’ coffee production 
and  suggested  that  production  activities  are  gendered,  with  women  playing  a  lead  role  in  some 
activities. However, consultations with potential beneficiaries in three of the five target municipalities 
suggested  that  the  degree  to  which  production  activities  are  gendered  may  have  been  overstated. 
Indeed,  it  seems that  women  play  an  important role  in  most  if  not  all  the  discrete  activities that  are 
involved in coffee production. This means that including women farmers in training activities is crucial 
for successful transmission of improved practices to farm households.

B.  Monitoring  
73. 
Project performance monitoring. A project performance monitoring system (PPMS) will be 
established  for  the  project.29  The  design  and  monitoring  framework  (DMF)  forms  the  basis  for 
monitoring  the  project  progress.  During  project  implementation,  the  PPMS,  through  project 
performance report, will monitor the likelihood that key milestone dates for activities, outputs, outcome, 
and impact will be achieved. The project’s impact, fully assessed 5 years after project completion, will 
be anticipated during project implementation through monitoring assumptions and risks. The DMF will 
be  reviewed  during  the  project  implementation  and  if  needed,  adjusted  to  reflect  changing 
circumstances.  Following  project  completion,  the  project  will  be  subject  to  an  assessment  of  the 
outcome along with recommendations for enhancing and sustaining the outcome. A project completion 
report will also include a preliminary assessment of the impact. The project impact, outcome, outputs, 
and targets and indicators are presented the DMF. 
74. 
The PMU will monitor project implementation as well as feedback from the executing agency, 
project steering committee, project beneficiaries, and other stakeholders. ADB will monitor five aspects 
of  project  performance  i.e.,  technical,  procurement,  disbursement,  financial  management,  and 
safeguards  (social  and  environment),  through  the  executing  agency’s  semiannual  progress  reports 
(prepared by the PIU and endorsed by the executing agency), day-today communication with the PIU, 
and ADB review missions. 
75. 
The PIU will prepare and submit semi-annual progress reports. These will include compliance 
monitoring with any conditions and covenants stipulated in the grant agreement; DMF activities and 
targets; environmental and social safeguards monitoring; and gender and social dimensions. 
76. 
Compliance monitoring. The PMU will monitor compliance with covenants stipulated in the 
grant agreement on behalf of the executing agency. ADB will monitor the compliance status through 
the executing agency’s semi-annual progress reports, day-to-day communication with the PMU, and 
ADB review missions; and take necessary remedial measures for any noncompliance. 
77. 
Environmental  safeguards  monitoring.  No  specific  environmental  safeguards  have  been 
adopted  for  the  project.  Nevertheless,  during  the  preparation  of  project  activities,  relevant 
environmental aspects will be considered and monitored during implementation as needed. The PIU 
will monitor and report the observations as part of the project performance monitoring and report on 
them in the semi-annual progress reports. The PMU will immediately inform the executing agency and 
ADB of any unanticipated environmental concerns. Corrective actions will be developed as needed, 
and agreed between the executing agency, PMU, affected persons, and any other relevant agencies. 
An environmental management checklist will be developed to monitor and mitigate impacts from the 
civil works and facilities operations. 
Social safeguards monitoring. The PMU will monitor project performance, including social 
78. 
safeguards  as  part  of the  project  performance monitoring  and report  it  in  the  semi-annual  progress 
reports. The PMU will immediately inform the executing agency and ADB of any unanticipated social 
safeguard concerns. No involuntary resettlement impacts will occur due to the project. 
79. 
Gender and social dimensions monitoring. The PMU social and gender specialist will record 
sex-disaggregated data and information on the social, gender, and participatory aspects of the project 
during the project activities. Monitoring and evaluation of the GAP will be incorporated into the project 
reporting. The social and gender specialist will prepare a semiannual report on GAP implementation 
and  progress,  as  part  of  the  semi-annual  progress  reports,  and  will  work  closely  with  the  project 
communities. 
44 
C.  Evaluation 
80. 
Project performance will be regularly monitored and rated through ADB’s e-Operations project 
implementation  module.  ADB’s  overall  grant  implementation  rating  will  be  made  based  on  five 
performance indicators: technical, procurement, disbursement, financial management, and social and 
environmental safeguards (Section IX.B). Such rating will be updated semiannually based on executing 
agency’s  semi-annual  progress  reports  and/or  ADB  review  missions.  Within  6  months  of  physical 
completion of the project, the executing agency (MAF) will submit a grant completion report to ADB. 
81. 
ADB  will  conduct  an  inception  mission  when  the  grant  becomes  effective.  ADB  and  the 
government  will  jointly  field  one  to  two  project  review  missions  a  year.  The  missions  will  (i)  review 
overall implementation of the project and update, in consultation with the executing agency, the project 
implementation schedule, (ii) examine existing and potential implementation problems, work with the 
executing agency to resolve them, (iii) review progress in procurement and disbursement, (iv) review 
the grant recipient's compliance with grant covenants and, where there is any noncompliance or delay, 
discuss proposed remedial measures, and (v) assess the likelihood of attaining the project’s outcome. 
82. 
ADB and the government will undertake a midterm review at the beginning of the third year of 
project  implementation, to  assess  implementation  status  and take  appropriate measures—including 
modification  of  scope  and  implementation  arrangements,  and  reallocation  of  grant  proceeds,  as 
appropriate—to achieve the project’s outcomes and impact. 
83. 
A  final  ADB  review  mission  will  take  place  within  6  months  after  physical  completion  of  the 
project. This mission will (i) assess project performance against targets and benchmarks including any 
revision(s) as agreed during the midterm review, (ii) identify any incomplete activities, or unused project 
funds, and (iii) determine the project’s performance rating. A project completion report will be prepared, 
in cooperation with the government. In case the project is selected as a sample of projects for project 
performance evaluation reporting, the project will be subject to more detailed performance evaluation 
and impact assessment about 3 or more years after completion. 
D.  Reporting 
84. 
The PMU, on behalf of the executing agency, will provide ADB with: (i) semi-annual progress 
reports in a format consistent with ADB's project performance reporting system; (ii) consolidated annual 
reports including (a) progress achieved by output as measured through the indicator's performance 
targets  against  the  baseline  data,  (b)  key  implementation  issues  and  solutions;  (iii)  updated 
procurement plan; (iv) updated implementation plan for each 12 months; and (v) a project completion 
report within 6 months of physical completion of the project.12 The completion report will present the 
government’s assessment of the project’s effectiveness and will take account of findings of the ADB’s 
final review. To ensure that the project continues to be viable and sustainable, project accounts and 
the executing agency audited financial statements, together with the associated auditor's report, should 
be adequately reviewed. 
The PMU shall include the results of implementing the GAP and summary poverty reduction 
85. 
and social strategy in the semi-annual reports to be submitted by the executing agency to ADB. 
86. 
Donor visibility. All project reports, training programs, seminars, workshops, materials, and 
equipment financed by the JFPR grant will clearly indicate the funding from the Government of Japan 
12  While activity reporting may be consolidated across the two implementing agencies, separate financial reportingmust be 
maintained for each implementing agency. The Executing Agency and PMU will review and compile the annual project 
financial statements prepared by each implementing agency for onward submission to ADB. 
45 
and  display  the  JFPR  and  Japan  Official  Development  Assistance  logos.  All  project  press  releases 
issued by ADB will refer to the financial contribution from the Government of Japan. The Government 
of Timor-Leste, including the executing agency, are requested to ensure that JFPR-financed activities 
are  well  covered  by  local  print,  electronic  and  social  media,  and  that  all  related  publicity  materials, 
official  notices,  reports  and  publications  explicitly  acknowledge  Japan  as  the  source  of  funding 
received.  The  executing  agency  and  PMU  will  collect  and  maintain  a  database  of  high-resolution 
photographs of the project activities, for use in project communication activities and for provision to the 
GoTL, ADB, and Embassy of Japan in Timor-Leste, which may use them  for public awareness and 
visibility purposes. 
87. 
Dissemination of project results to the Government of Japan. The PMU will provide MAF 
and ADB with reporting materials on the project activities, including high resolution photos, testimonials 
from project recipients and implementers, publications, and other knowledge products. In turn, the ADB 
project team will provide this information to ADB’s Office of Cofinancing Operations–Japan team, as 
well  as  back-to-office  reports,  inception,  midterm  review,  and  completion  reports.  Information  and 
methods for donor visibility and coordination are described in Appendices 2 and 3. 
E.  Stakeholder Communication Strategy  
88. 
A stakeholder communication strategy has been prepared for the project (Appendix 4). By its 
design,  the  project  requires  and  benefits  from  stakeholder  participation  and  ownership.  The 
communication  strategy  prescribes  timely  and  inclusive  dissemination  of  project  progress  and  the 
opportunity for public feedback. The strategy focuses on three objectives: (i) effective communication 
with the project stakeholders to achieve informed and supportive engagement; (ii) project visibility in 
the media; and (iii) coordination and alignment of the project activities with other donor programs. 
Public disclosure of project documents and activities will be made through the MAF website 
89. 
and using other dissemination approaches. 
X. 
ANTICORRUPTION POLICY  
ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its  agents,  any  violations  of  the 
90. 
Anticorruption Policy relating to the project.13 All contracts financed by ADB shall include provisions 
specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of the executing agency 
and all project contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers. Individuals and entities 
on ADB’s anticorruption debarment list are ineligible to participate in ADB-financed activity and may 
not be awarded any contracts under the project.14  
To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  are  included  in  the  grant  agreement  and  the 
91. 
bidding documents for the project.  
XI. 
ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISM 
People  who  are,  or  may  in  the  future  be,  adversely  affected  by  the  project  may  submit 
92. 
complaints  to  ADB’s  Accountability  Mechanism.  The  Accountability  Mechanism  provides  an 
independent  forum  and  process  whereby  people  adversely  affected  by  ADB-assisted  projects  can 
voice, and seek a resolution of their problems, as well as report alleged violations of ADB’s operational 
policies  and  procedures.  Before  submitting  a  complaint  to  the  Accountability  Mechanism,  affected 
people should make a good faith effort to solve their problems by working with the concerned ADB

operations department. Only after doing that, and if they are still dissatisfied, should they approach the 
Accountability Mechanism.15

APPENDIX 2:  GUIDANCE NOTE ON JAPANESE VISIBILITY 
I. 
Introduction 
1. 
The Revised Operating Framework for the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) was 
approved on 6 October 2009, combining Japan’s project grant and technical assistance 
support under one umbrella, and paving the way for a more comprehensive approach to 
the  use  of  these  funds  towards  addressing  poverty,  building  up  human  resources,  and 
empowering institutions and communities in the region. Japan has been making generous 
contributions for technical assistance activities through the Japan Special Fund, and for 
poverty reduction projects through JFPR, since they were established in 1988 and 2000, 
respectively. It is but fitting and proper that said contributions are acknowledged and the 
recipients and general public are informed of the source of the funding assistance both at 
the Fund level and at the level of the individual TA and project grants. The purpose of this 
note  is  to  provide  guidance  on  measures  to  ensure  that  the  contribution  of  Japan  in 
supporting JFPR is widely recognized.1
II. 
STATEMENT ON JAPANESE VISIBILITY 
2. 
Project teams are required to help promote the visibility and local awareness of JFPR in 
recipient countries through the following: 
(a) 
(b) 
(c) 
All press releases issued by ADB with respect to JFPR should refer to the financial 
contribution from the Government of Japan (GOJ)2; 
Signing  ceremonies  and  other  publicity  events  should  be  encouraged,  inviting 
Japan embassy officials, JICA staff, local and international press3; 
Civil  works,  project  billboards/signages,  vehicles,  and  equipment must  carry the 
JFPR and Japan ODA logos (see below). Likewise, all publications and training 
programs  must  bear  the  said  logos,  including  all  collaterals  used  (i.e.  training 
materials, banners, posters, flyers, etc.) that are financed by JFPR; these logos 
are available in the SDPF-JFPR website; 4
1 A copy of the Guidance Note on Japanese Visibility is appended to the Project Administration Manual as guide to 
the project team and the government, during project implementation. 
2 Staff may coordinate with the Department of Communications. 
3 Coordination with resident missions are necessary.

50  
Appendix 2 
(d) 
(e) 
Publications,  reports,  training  programs,  seminars  and  workshops  financed  by 
JFPR should acknowledge receipt of funding from GOJ; 
Recipients should be encouraged to ensure that JFPR-financed activities are well 
covered by local print and electronic media, and that all related publicity materials, 
and  official  notices  explicitly  acknowledge  funding  from  GOJ.  Below  is  the 
suggested  standard  text  to  be  used  by  those  who  prepare  publicity  materials: 
"The grant fund for (project name/activity) was received from the Japan Fund for 
Poverty  Reduction  financed  by  the  Government  of  Japan  through  the  Asian 
Development Bank”. 
III. 
PARTICIPATION OF JAPANESE ENTITIES IN IMPLEMENTATION 
3. 
It  is  also  important  to  generate  visibility  of  the  project  within  Japan.  Involvement  or 
cooperation with Japanese experts, financial resources and technologies are encouraged; 
occasional  information  sessions  on  JFPR  for  Japanese  organizations  may  also  be 
conducted. It is also highly recommended that ADB involve and cooperate with Japanese 
organizations including NGOs, civil society organizations, aid agencies in particular JICA 
and JBIC, the private sector enterprises or academic institutions. 
IV.  Reporting 
4. 
At  the  end  of  the  project,  the  completion  report  submitted  by  the  project  team  should 
include evidences of Japanese visibility such as photos (preferably high resolution), press 
releases,  articles  or  write-ups,  and  testimonials  from  project  recipients  and/or 
implementers.  Sample  products  generated  from  the  project  grant  are  requested  to  be 
made available to SDPF for inclusion in future exhibits. Copies of publications5 that are 
outputs of the project should also be provided to SDPF. 
V. 
VISIBILITY SUPPORT BY ADB 
5. 
6. 
SDPF promotes visibility of JFPR by: (i) informing Office and Department Heads of the 
importance of achieving high visibility in order to garner support for JFPR from Japanese 
officials  and  taxpayers;  (ii)  informing  Country  Directors  of  the  importance  of  signing 
ceremonies to  Japanese  officials  and the  public to  ensure  recognition  and  support  for 
JFPR  funding;  and  (iii)  continuing  widespread  distribution  of the  JFPR  Annual  Report, 
inclusion  of  JFPR  information  in  relevant  ADB  documents,  and  occasional  information 
sessions for Japanese organizations. 
Resident Mission staff are requested to forward copies of all visibility materials, such as 
press  releases,  newspaper  and  magazine  articles,  and  photographs  (including 
descriptive captions) to SDPF’s assigned focal staff for JFPR or e-mail to (jfpr@adb.org).

INTRODUCTION 
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
The  Final  Report  on  the  Review  of  Japanese  Official  Development  Assistance1 (ODA) 
underscores  the  need  for  strategic  and  effective  aid.  One  way  to  ensure  alignment  of 
Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  (JFPR)  projects  and  technical  assistance  (TA)  with 
Government  of  Japan’s  (GOJ)  bilateral  assistance  strategy  for  a  particular  developing 
member  country  (DMC)  is  by  bringing  on  board  the  comments  and  suggestions  of  the 
Embassy of Japan (EoJ) and the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA).2 Thus, 
the summary of consultations with EoJ and JICA (to include, date of consultation, name 
and position of staff met, and EoJ and JICA's response) should be included in the proposal 
submitted  to  SDPF.3  This  Guidance  Note  provides  detailed  instructions  regarding 
coordination activities with EoJ and JICA.4
II. 
EOJ AND JICA CONTACT PERSONS 
As soon as project officer informs SDPF of the intent to apply for JFPR funding,5 SDPF 
will  identify  the  appropriate  contact  persons  in  EoJ  and  JICA.  The  contact  persons’ 
information6 will be provided by SDPF to the project officer to start consultation. 
III. 
CONSULTATION WITH EOJ AND JICA – PROPOSAL PREPARATION 
At  concept  stage,  project  officer  should  consult  with  EoJ  and  JICA7 through  e-mail  the 
proposed  project  to,  (i)  seek  if  it  is  in  line  with  Japan  ODA  priorities,  (ii)  ensure  no 
duplication, and (iii) present the concept itself, with copy to SDPF. 
Upon SDPF’s confirmation to proceed with proposal preparation, the project officer may 
arrange the project design meeting with EoJ and JICA. This meeting intends to explain 
and  discuss  the  actual  project  design.  This  is  ideally  conducted  during  the  fact-finding 
mission.8 The proposal,9 should be provided to EoJ and JICA with copy to SDPF at least 
5 working days before the meeting to give ample time for review and consideration. After 
the meeting, if needed, SDPF in coordination with the project officer, may follow-up with 
EoJ and JICA, and respond to requests for clarification. 
5. 
In the case of regional TAs, the draft TA Summary and Report should be sent by email to 
EoJ and JICA contact persons on no-objection basis.

ROLE OF THE RESIDENT MISSION AND SDPF 
Project officer’s communications with EoJ and JICA should be done in coordination 
with the resident mission10 with copy to SDPF. If needed, SDPF supports to identify 
the appropriate staff to be consulted. 
Resident mission also arranges the Grant Agreement/TA letter signing event (section 
V) and in the overall coordination/relationship management with EoJ and JICA. 
SDPF’s role are as follows: (i) provide contact details of relevant staff from EoJ and 
JICA  for project consultation; (ii) liaise any need for clarification by EoJ and JICA in 
coordination  with the project officer, during project consultation; (iii) inform EoJ and 
JICA  when  there  is  withdrawal  or  cancellation  of  a  project;  and  (iv)  forward  all 
completion reports to both agencies.

11. 
Project officer should inform EoJ and JICA about ADB’s approval. Project officers are 
strongly encouraged to conduct signing or launching ceremonies with the attendance 
of EoJ officials.11
In  coordination  with  the resident mission,  the  project  officer  should  inform  EoJ  and 
SDPF  of  the  signing  ceremony–  at  least  10  working  days  in  advance.  SDPF  then 
informs  GOJ  of  this  activity.  The  project  officer  should  also  draft  news  release  in 
consultation  with  the  Department  of  communications  and  coordinate  arrangements 
with  the  resident  mission.  Local  and  international  press  are  invited  to  these 
ceremonies. 
COORDINATION WITH EOJ AND JICA – DURING PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION 
AND UPON PROJECT COMPLETION 
Throughout  implementation,  the  project  officer  should  inform  EoJ  about  project 
progress, milestones, and outcomes, and discuss when major changes in scope and 
objectives are required. Progress and outcomes of JFPR projects are also requested 
to  be  shared  with  JICA.  From  time  to  time,  EoJ  and  JICA  may  also  wish  to  join 
completion review missions in order to see project results and to interact first-hand 
with  project  recipients.  Lessons  from  the  JFPR  projects  are  also  requested  to  be 
shared to enable both sides to explore and seek potential collaboration. Completion 
reports are required to be submitted by the project officer to SDPF for forwarding to 
EoJ and JICA.12
