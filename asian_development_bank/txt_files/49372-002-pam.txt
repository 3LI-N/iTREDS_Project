PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
1. 
The project will contribute to enhancing food security and rural economic growth in Punjab 
province.  It  will  increase  the  agricultural  production  and  productivity  of  the  project  area  by 
developing a new irrigation system. The Greater Thal Canal (GTC) irrigation scheme will convert 
a  total  of  704,000  hectares  (ha)  of  low  productive  rainfed  (barani)  lands  in  Bhakkar,  Jhang, 
Muzaffargarh,  Khushab and  Layyah  districts  of Punjab to  irrigated  and productive  lands.  It  will 
provide reliable irrigation water supplies during the monsoon (kharif) season from April to October. 
The  government  has  constructed  its  Main  Canal  and  the  first  branch  (Mankera)  system.1 The 
proposed project will support the construction of the irrigation canal network in the second branch 
(Choubara)  system  and  the  on-farm  command  area  development  (CAD)  in  the  Main  Canal, 
Mankera branch, and Choubara branch areas covering about 263,000 ha. The project will also 
enhance  the  capacity  of  relevant  government  entities  and  water  users  for:  (i)  efficient  water 
management; (ii) introduction of advanced technologies, and (iii) improved and climate resilient 
agricultural practices and (iv) sustainable infrastructure. 
Water allocation for the entire GTC scheme was determined and approved by the Indus 
2. 
River System Authority in 2002. It is within the provincial allocation for Punjab province, as defined 
under  the  Water  Apportionment  Accord. 2 The  project  will  not  alter  or  exceed  the  approved 
provincial water allocation. The GTC irrigation scheme is non-perennial and will use water only 
during the monsoon (kharif) season from about April to October. 
The  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impacts:  food  security  enhanced 3 and  rural 
3. 
poverty in Punjab reduced.4 The project will have the following outcome: agricultural production 
and productivity in the project area increased.5 
4. 
Output  1:  Irrigation  system  infrastructure  for  Choubara  system  constructed.  This 
output will construct irrigation canals in the Choubara branch system and associated structures. 
Major activities will include (i) construction of the Choubara branch system; (ii) tree planting along 
irrigation canals for the Main Canal and Mankera and Choubara branch systems as wind breakers 
to prevent sediment deposits entering the irrigation canals; (iii) desilting of the  Main Canal and 
Mankera branch systems; (iv) construction and renovation of operational and administration site 
buildings  for  the  Punjab  Irrigation  Department  (PID);  and  (v)  the  implementation  of  a  social 
development action plan to receive an increased population in agricultural labor. This includes 
equipment procurement for a basic health unit, upgrading a girls’ school and vocational training 
(para.  36).  The  Choubara  branch  system  includes  the  construction  of  72  kilometers  (km)  total 
length of the branch canal, 251 km total length of 11 secondary canals and 127 km total length of 
11 tertiary canals.  
5. 
Output 2: On-farm command area developed with enhanced beneficiaries’ capacity. 
CAD activities in the Main Canal, Mankera and Choubara branch areas will include: (i) on-farm 
community watercourses, (including development and construction of field channels using farmer 
1   The overall GTC irrigation system comprises one Main Canal, and 4 branch canal systems. The Main Canal and

PROJECT MANAGEMENT ARRANGEMENTS 
A. 
Project Implementation Organizations: Roles and Responsibilities 
Project  steering  committee.  The  project  steering  committee  (PSC)  will  serve  as  an 
9. 
oversight  body.  The  PSC  will  be  chaired  by  the  Chairman,  Punjab  Planning  and Development 
Board  (P&DB)  and  include  Secretaries  of  PID,  PAD,  Forest,  Wildlife,  and  Fisheries  (FWF) 
Department, Punjab Environment Department, and Punjab Finance Department. Member Board 
of Revenue, the Project Directors of Project Management Office (PMO) under the PID and project 
implementation office (PIO) under the PAD, and the team leader of the project implementation 
consultant may also participate in PSC when necessary. 
CAD 
implementation  committee 
(also  called  PAD  project 
implementation 
10. 
committee). The coordination committee will ensure better interdepartmental coordination and 
provide overall guidance on implementation and operational issues. This will be particularly on 
command area development activities, especially on chakbandi and coordinating irrigation system 
development and operations with command area development.7 The committee will be chaired 
by  Secretary,  Agriculture,  with  representation  from  PMO,  PIO,  Irrigation  Secretariat,  relevant 
wings of the PAD, district administration and any other department, if needed. The committee will 
advise the Project Steering Committee proceedings. 
11. 
Executing and implementing agencies. The PID will be the executing agency for the 
project and will be responsible for the management and implementation of the entire project. It is 
directly  responsible  for  the  project’s  Output  1  (Choubara  irrigation  system  construction)  and 
Output  3  (PID  institutional  capacity  strengthening).  The  PAD  will  be  the  implementing  agency 
responsible for Output 2 (CAD) of the project, which includes capacity strengthening of PAD and 
farmers.  
Project management office and project implementation office.  The existing PID PMO 
12. 
for Barrages will be responsible for project implementation. The PMO will be strengthened through 
additional staff resources, enabling it to manage project implementation without affecting existing 
projects’  responsibilities.  The  project  director  of  PMO  will  manage  the  overall  project 
implementation, coordinate and manage implementation of Outputs 1 and 3, and facilitate PSC 
and working meeting proceedings. The PID had created an implementation and coordination unit 
at project site since inception of the main GTC and Mankera irrigation system implementation. 
This  unit  reports  to  PMO.  The  PMO  will  be  supported  by  a  project  implementation  consultant 
team.     
13. 
The  PID  established  a  divisional  office  -  the  Choubara  canal  division,  by  recruiting  an 
executive engineer and three sub-divisional officers in 2021 for the implementation of the project. 
The  Choubara  canal  division  will  be  responsible  for  joint  implementation  and  operations 
management  with  PMO  and  seamless  transition  to  takeover  completed  facilities  at  project 
completion. 
The  PAD  will  appoint  Director General  Agriculture (on-farm  water  management)  as  the 
14. 
project director responsible for overseeing the implementation of Output 2 in coordination with the 
PMO. Under the supervision of the PAD project director, a PIO will be established. The PAD will 
ensure that the PIO will have dedicated staff from allied directorates of agriculture field, extension

areas  of  channels  as  a  whole  or  of  individual  outlets  for  working  out  the  chak  boundary.  Chak  boundary  is  the 
boundary of areas reserved for irrigation from any particular outlet. 
6 
and adaptive research, and soil survey and maintain intradepartmental coordination. The existing 
PAD  field offices  will  be strengthened  through  additional  staff.  The  PIO  will  be  supported  by  a 
command area development consultant team.  
For  close  coordination,  staff  from  PMO,  PIO  and  two  project  management  consultant 
15. 
teams will hold monthly meetings and report to the government and ADB. This will ensure regular 
comprehensive reviews, decision making and problem solving. The monthly meetings will be co-
chaired by the project directors, PMO and PIO and the members will include PMO, PIO, project 
implementation consultants, command area development consultants.

COSTS AND FINANCING 
17. 
The project is estimated to cost  ¥27,979.6 million ($249.3 million equivalent) (Table 7). 
The  major  expenditure  items  include  civil  works,  on-farm  CAD  activity  support,  consulting 
services, and institutional capacity strengthening and project management. ADB will finance the 
expenditures  in  relation  to  works,  equipment,  on-farm  CAD  activities,  institutional  capacity 
development,  consulting  services,  resettlement  compensation  and  project  management.  The 
ADB loan financing will cover non-land compensations, while land costs will be financed by the 
government.  Farmers,  i.e.,  beneficiaries,  will  contribute  fixed  percentages  to  selected  CAD 
activities, such as field water course construction, installation of high efficiency irrigation systems. 
A. 
Cost Estimates Preparation and Revisions  
18. 
The PMO and PIO estimated capital costs for their respective assigned components, in 
close  consultation  with  relevant  sections  of  the  PID  and  PAD.  PID  institutional  capacity 
strengthening  costs  were  prepared  by  the  PID  and  the  consultant  financed  under  the  project 
preparation transactional technical assistance (TRTA). The overall project cost was estimated by 
the  TRTA  consultant.  Cost  estimates  may  be  updated  by  the  PMO  and/or  PIO  during  project 
implementation,  according  to  actual  awarded  contracted  amounts  and  other  considerations,  if 
any.  
B.

FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT 
A. 
Financial Management Assessment 
The  financial  management  assessment  (FMA)  was  conducted  during  the  project 
22. 
processing till June 2021 in accordance with ADB’s Guidelines for the Financial Management and 
Analysis of Projects and the Financial Due Diligence: A Methodology Note. The FMA assessed 
the  financial  management  capacity  of  the  PID  and  PAD  including  funds-flow  arrangements, 
staffing, accounting and financial reporting systems, financial information systems, and internal 
and external auditing arrangements were assessed. Based on the assessment, it was concluded 
that  the  incumbent  financial  management  staff  is  adequately  qualified  and  experienced  in  the 
financial  management  of  ADB  projects  and  implementation  of  Government  specified  financial 
rules and regulations. External audits of ongoing ADB funded projects implemented by the PID 
and  PAD  have  shown  satisfactory  results,  8  9  10 adequate  and  appropriate  documentation  of 
internal controls is available in the form of various national and provincial financial management 
rules  and  regulations,  and  the  controls  over  administrative  assets  are  robust.  However,  the 
financial management staff strength is insufficient which likely hinders segregation controls over 
accounting and financial reporting functions, the absence of independent internal audit function 
and use of manual systems for accounting and financial reporting impedes the effectiveness of 
internal controls, while the management of operating assets is weak. Accordingly, the overall pre-
mitigation financial  management  risk  was  assessed  to be  substantial.  The  PID  and  PAD  were 
assessed  to  possess  sufficient  capacity  to  manage  advance  fund  and  maintain  adequate 
documentation for the use of statement of expenditure (SOE) procedures. 
Efficiency of the financial management systems had improved as both agencies continue 
23. 
to  incorporate  measures  for  improving  their  financial  management  functions.  However,  both 
agencies  recognize  the  need  for  further  improvements.  The  PID  and  PAD  have  agreed  to 
implement  an  action  plan  as  key  measures  to  address  the  residual  gaps.  The  financial 
management action plan is provided in the table below.

27. 
Advance  fund  procedure.  Separate  advance  accounts  should  be  established  and 
maintained  by  PID  and  PAD  for  each  funding  source  at  the  National  Bank  of  Pakistan.  The 
currency of the advance accounts is the Japanese Yen.  The advance accounts are to be used 
exclusively  for  ADB’s  share  of  eligible  expenditures.  The  PID  and  PAD  who  administer  the 
advance accounts are accountable and responsible for proper use of advances to the advance 
account including advances to any sub-accounts.  
The total outstanding advance to the advance accounts should not exceed the estimate 
28. 
of ADB’s share of expenditures to be paid through the advance accounts for the forthcoming 6 
months  or  10%  of  the  loan  amount.  The  PID  and  PAD  may  request  for  initial  and  additional 
advances to the advance accounts based on an Estimate of Expenditure Sheet13 setting out the 
estimated  expenditures  to  be  financed  through  the  accounts  for  the  forthcoming  6  months. 
Supporting documents should be submitted to ADB or retained by the government in accordance 
with ADB’s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time) when liquidating

Supporting  documents  and  records  for  the  expenditures  claimed  under  the  SOE  should  be 
maintained and made readily available for review by ADB's disbursement and review missions, 
upon  ADB's  request  for  submission  of  supporting  documents  on  a  sampling  basis,  and  for 
independent audit. Reimbursement and liquidation of individual payments in excess of the SOE 
ceiling should be supported by full documentation when submitting the withdrawal application to 
ADB.

specimen signatures of each authorized person. The minimum value per WA is stipulated in the 
Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time). Individual payments below 
such amount should be paid (i) by the PID and/or PAD and subsequently claimed to ADB through 
reimbursement, or (ii) through the advance fund procedure, unless otherwise accepted by ADB. 
The  borrower  should  ensure  sufficient  category  and  contract  balances  before  requesting 
disbursements. ADB reserves the right not to accept WAs below the minimum amount. WAs and 
supporting documents will demonstrate, among other things that the goods, and/or services were 
produced in or from ADB members and are eligible for ADB financing. Use of ADB’s Client Portal 
for  Disbursements  (CPD)15 system  is  encouraged  for  submission  of  withdrawal  applications  to 
ADB.

Disbursement Arrangements for Counterpart Fund 
31. 
All  disbursements  under  government  financing  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with 
regulations of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan relevant to co-financing of the projects financed 
by the Multilateral Financing Organizations. PID and PAD shall open and maintain the separate 
advance  account  for  government  counterpart  funds.  The  Government  will  finance  local  taxes. 
Value added tax (VAT) will be claimed by the contactors, suppliers, and consultants in his interim 
payment  certificate  (IPC),  and  PMO-Barrages  will  approve  the  invoices  including  VAT.  PMO 
Barrages will pay the claimed VAT to Punjab Revenue Authority (PRA). PMO Barrages will pay 
the rest of the amount to the contractors, suppliers and consultants. Income tax will be deducted 
from the invoice of the contractors, suppliers and consultants. The deducted income tax will be 
paid by PMO-Barrages to the FBR (Federal Board of Revenue). The deducted income tax will be 
reflected in the income of contractors, suppliers and consultants when submitting their finance 
balance sheets to PRA. 
C. 
Accounting 
32. 
The PID and PAD will maintain, or cause to be maintained, separate books and records 
by funding source for all expenditures incurred on the project following  the International Public 
Sector Accounting Standard for cash-based accounting. The PID and PAD will prepare project 
financial statements in accordance with the government's accounting laws and regulations which 
are consistent with international accounting principles and practices. 
D. 
 Auditing and Public Disclosure 
33. 
The PID and PAD detailed project financial statements will be audited in accordance with 
International Standards on Auditing by an independent auditor acceptable to ADB. The audited 
project financial statements together with the auditor’s opinion will be presented in the English 
language to ADB within 6 months from the end of the fiscal year by the PID and PAD.   
34. 
The audit report for the project financial statements will include a management letter and 
auditor’s opinions, which cover (i) whether the project financial statements present an accurate 
and fair view or are presented fairly, in all material respects, in accordance with the applicable 
financial  reporting  standards;  (ii)  whether  the  proceeds  of  the  loan  were  used  only  for  the 
15 The Client Portal for Disbursement facilitates online submission of WA to ADB, resulting in faster disbursement. The 
forms  to  be  completed  by  the  Borrower  are  available  online  at  https://www.adb.org/documents/client-portal-

27 
purpose(s) of the project; and (iii) whether the borrower or executing agency was in compliance 
with the financial covenants contained in the legal agreements (where applicable). 
35. 
Compliance with financial reporting and auditing requirements will be monitored by review 
missions and during normal program supervision, and followed up regularly with all concerned, 
including the external auditor.  
36. 
The government,  PID  and  PAD  have  been  made aware  of  ADB’s  approach  to  delayed 
submission, and the requirements for satisfactory and acceptable quality of the audited  project 
financial  statements.16 ADB  reserves the  right  to  require  a  change  in  the  auditor  (in  a manner 
consistent with the constitution of the borrower), or for additional support to be provided to the 
auditor, if the audits required are not conducted in a manner satisfactory to ADB, or if the audits 
are  substantially  delayed.  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  verify  the  project's  financial  accounts  to 
confirm  that  the  share  of  ADB’s  financing  is  used  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  policies  and 
procedures. 
Public disclosure of the audited project financial statements, including the auditor’s opinion 
37. 
on the project financial statements, will be guided by ADB’s Public Communications Policy 2011.17 
After the review, ADB will disclose the audited project financial statements and the opinion of the 
auditors on the project financial statements no later than 14 days of ADB’s confirmation of their 
acceptability by posting them on ADB’s website. The management letter and additional auditor’s 
opinions will not be disclosed.18 
16 ADB’s approach and procedures regarding delayed submission of audited project financial statements:  
(i)  When audited project financial  statements  are  not  received  by  the  due  date,  ADB  will  write  to  the  executing 
agency advising that (a) the audit documents are overdue; and (b) if they are not received  within the next 6 
months, requests for new contract awards and disbursement such as new replenishment of advance accounts, 
processing of new reimbursement, and issuance of new commitment letters will not be processed. 
(ii)  When audited project financial statements are not received within 6 months after the due date, ADB will withhold 
processing  of  requests  for  new  contract  awards  and  disbursement  such  as  new  replenishment  of  advance 
accounts, processing of new reimbursement, and issuance of new commitment letters. ADB will (a) inform the 
executing agency of ADB’s actions; and (b) advise that the loan may be suspended if the audit documents are 
not received within the next 6 months. 
(iii)  When  audited  project  financial  statements  are  not  received  within  12  months  after  the  due  date,  ADB  may 
suspend the loan.

Procurement of Goods, Works, and Consulting Services 
42. 
All  procurement  of  goods,  works  and  consultant  selection  will  be  undertaken  in 
accordance  with  ADB  Procurement  Policy  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  the 
Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time). Major civil 
works contracts include irrigation canals, i.e., main branch canal, distributary and minor canals, 
gated  regulators,  associated  structures  and  field  office  buildings.  Open  competitive  bidding 
(international advertisement) will be used for the Choubara irrigation canal construction civil works 
package. Most of the goods and works contracts shall be used using open competitive bidding, 
(national  advertisement).  Request  for  quotations  (RFQ)  will  be  used  for  goods  and  works 
packages up to $200,000. 
Before  the  start  of  any  procurement,  ADB  and  the  government  will  review  the  public 
43. 
procurement  laws  of  the  federal  and  provincial  governments  to  ensure  consistency  with  ADB 
Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and Procurement Regulations for ADB

procedures of all packages is detailed in Section C.  
The  command  area  development  component  includes  watercourse  construction.  This 
45. 
comprises earthen construction of watercourses, lining in critical sections, and up to 50% of the 
29 
watercourse  length,  water  control  structures,  culverts,  drop  structures,  and  allied  works.19 The 
procurement will be carried out through community participation by involving 1,247 WUAs.20 This 
will enhance community mobilization, involvement, ownership, and employment of labor-intensive 
techniques through cost-sharing mechanism. WUA and PAD will enter an agreement by which 
WUA  will  execute  the  works.  WUA  will  purchase  the  construction  materials  through  an  RFQ 
procedure by inviting at least three quotations, preferably from local suppliers. Labor component 
of  the  subprojects  will  be  extended  by  the  members  of  the  community,  provided  adequate 
expertise  exists,  who  should  be  reimbursed  adequately  for  the  services rendered.  In  case  the 
WUA cannot identify adequately skilled labor within the community, the works can be let out by 
inviting quotations from three local contractors. The cost estimates for the works will be based on 
PAD  approved rates  (updated from time to time).  The command  area  development consultant 
team will supervise the works with PAD oversight. The details of community contracting are given 
in Appendix 2. 
46. 
The  CAD  includes  additional  works  components:  water  storage  ponds,  high  efficiency 
irrigation  systems,  laser  land  levelling,  high  efficiency  irrigation  systems  and  tubewell  water 
course lining. The PAD will invite applications from the beneficiary farm owner(s) and finalize the 
scope of intervention based on the selection criterion. Once agreement is reached between PAD 
and the beneficiary farm owner(s), the PAD will invite at least three quotations by using ADB’s 
(RFQ  procedures.  The  RFQ  will  be  issued  to  contractors  or  suppliers  who  have  adequate 
experience  and  capacity.  They  will  then  evaluate  and  award  the  work  and  inform  the  farmer. 
Contractors and suppliers will execute the works or install the equipment under the supervision 
of CAD consultants with PAD oversight and in coordination with beneficiary farmers.    
47. 
Consulting services packages for the project are described in Section D. 
48. 
All consultants will be recruited according to ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended 
from time to time) and Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time 
to time). The terms of reference for consulting services are detailed in Section D. 
49. 
For the PID project management consultant package, an estimated 984 person-months 
(national) of consulting services are required to (i) facilitate project management, (ii) construction 
supervision  support,  and  (iii)  project  monitoring  and  evaluation  support.  For  the  PAD  on-farm 
command area development support package, an estimated 2,070 person-months (national) of 
consulting services are required to (i) facilitate project management, (ii) on-farm CAD support, (iii) 
capacity strengthening support for the PAD and WUAs; and (iv) project monitoring and evaluation 
support.  Consulting  firms  will  be  engaged  using  the  quality  and  cost-based  selection  (QCBS) 
method with a standard quality cost ratio of 90:10.

41 
A. 
Environment 
VII. 
SAFEGUARDS 
The project is classified as category A for environmental safeguards. The environmental 
52. 
impact assessment (EIA) has been prepared by PID in accordance with ADB’s Safeguard Policy 
Statement (SPS), 2009. The first draft EIA was disclosed on the ADB website in February 2020. 
The second draft EIA that incorporates second round of an ecological survey, biodiversity action 
plan  (BAP),  and  stakeholders  engagement  plan  (SEP)  was  disclosed  on  the  ADB  website  in 
September 2021. The EIA concludes the project will result in positive impacts by converting semi-
arid rainfed low productive lands to irrigated agricultural lands resulting to increased agricultural 
productions  and  improved  livelihoods  of  local  population.  The  key  negative  impacts  are 
construction-related21 and  during  operations  of  the  canal,  such  as  hydrological  changes  in  the 
project area, socio-economic impacts, increased pesticide use, and potential habitat modification 
of the range lands (rakhs),22 which are classified as protected forests under the Forest Act and 
providing habitat for a limited range of wildlife species. 
53. 
Environmental  Management  Plan.  The  EIA  includes  an  environmental  management 
plan  (EMP)  which  specifies  mitigation  measures,  environmental  monitoring  and  reporting 
requirements,  safeguard  institutional  arrangements,  safeguard  capacity  development  for  the 
PMO  and  PIO, cost  estimates,  performance  indicators,  and  actions to ensure  compliance  with 
ADB SPS, applicable laws and regulations. The EMP will be incorporated into the bidding and 
contract  documents,  giving  contractors  the  primary  responsibility  for  implementation  of 
construction-related  mitigation  measures.  Prior  to  start  of  civil  works,  the  contractor  will  be 
required  to  submit  to  PMO  and  PIO  a  site-specific  EMP  (SSEMP)  that  will  include  pre-works 
photo-documentation, detailed mitigation measures and environmental monitoring program, and 
subplans23 such as but not limited to health and safety plan, waste management plan, and traffic 
management plan. If some residual impacts are likely to remain significant after mitigation, the 
SSEMP will also include appropriate compensatory measures (offset) that aim to ensure that the 
project  does  not  cause  significant  net  degradation  to  the  environment.  The  contractor(s)  shall 
reinstate  all  properties,  whether  public  or  private,  which  are  damaged  as  consequence  of 
execution of works to at least pre-works conditions. 
54. 
To address potential operational impacts on hydrogeological changes in the area, Output 
3 of the project includes installation of groundwater monitoring equipment for the entire GTC area, 
developing  ground  water  modelling,  and  institutional  capacity  for  improved  water  resources 
management and O&M of irrigation systems to ensure sustainability. On increased pesticide use, 
the  project  under  Output  2  includes  farmers’  capacity  enhancement  of  appropriate  agricultural 
practices including pesticide management. On potential habitat modification, the EIA includes a 
proposed BAP to offset potential losses of biodiversity values in the rakhs due to the project. The 
project will also not allow agricultural command area development activities in the rakh areas to 
prevent  land  use  changes,  complying  with  the  Forest  Act.  The  BAP  provides  institutional 
strengthening measures to enhance capacity of the various government departments, create an 
interface with other relevant stakeholders in the area, particularly Bhakkar District, measures for 
sustainable agricultural and livestock development alongside eco-tourism potential, to enhance 
21 Potential environmental impacts that may occur during construction include such as noise, dust, waste generation, 
localized increase in traffic, occupational health and safety risks, exposure to  biological hazard (e.g. viruses) and 
spread to the community (community health and safety) 
22 Most of the project area is located within a declared game reserve, but it serves the purpose of controlled hunting of 
mainly Houbara bustard and other wildlife by permit holders, and not of environmental conservation. 
23 The EIA includes details of the subplan and suggested outlines. 
42 
livelihood opportunities for the local communities. During the project implementation phase, the 
BAP will need to be presented to the Forest Department and other NGO’s working in the area 
(e.g., WWF and IUCN) for further discussion and agreement on the actions and timelines. The 
EIA also included a tree management plan (TMP) for trees to be planted along the irrigation canals 
(to act as a wind barrier) and to delineate roles and responsibilities between various parties for 
the planting and maintenance of trees during and beyond project implementation period. 
55. 
Recommendations  of  the  EIA.  The  EIA  has  analyzed  in  detail  all  the  potential 
environmental  and  socio-economic  impacts  during  various  project  phases.  The  EIA  concludes 
that  with  the  described  mitigation  and  biodiversity  offset  measures  and  capacity  building 
effectively implemented and monitored as outlined in the Environmental Management Plan and 
Biodiversity Management Plan and the implementation of the Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP), the 
project  will  achieve  its  goals  of  significant  benefits  for  farming  communities  while  keeping 
environmental impacts at an acceptably low level. It will also put in place awareness programs 
and conservation planning and resourcing which will target a no-net-loss outcome for biodiversity. 
Update/revision  of  the  EIA.  The  EIA  will  be  updated  to  include  feedback  from 
56. 
stakeholders  and  affected  people,  if  any,  or  in  the  event  of  any  unanticipated  environmental 
impacts during project implementation. The PMO will submit the updated/revised EIA(s) to ADB 
for  review  and  concurrence.  The  PMO  shall  ensure  any  additional  requirements  due  to  the 
updating/revision are communicated to the contractor(s) in a timely manner and issue contract 
variations,  if  needed,  to  meet  the  safeguard  compliance  requirements.  Any  update  in  the  EIA 
during implementation will also be disclosed on ADB and project websites. No relevant additional 
works shall be allowed until ADB approves the updated EIAs. 
57. 
Statutory clearances and applicable standards. Implementation of the project will be 
governed  by  Governments  of  Pakistan  and  Punjab  environmental  acts,  rules,  policies,  and 
regulations. All statutory clearances shall be obtained prior to commencement of works. The PMO 
and  PIO  will  inform  the  contractor(s)  for  any  environmental  clearance  conditions  related  to 
execution  of  works  and  will  ensure  these  are  considered  in  the  SSEMPs.  During  the  design, 
construction, and operation of the project, ADB SPS requires the PMO and PIO to apply pollution 
prevention and control technologies and practices consistent with international good practice, as 
reflected  in  internationally  recognized  standards  such  as  the  World  Bank  Group’s  (WBG) 
environment, health, and safety (EHS) Guidelines. These standards contain performance levels 
and measures that are normally acceptable and applicable to projects. In general, Government 
of Pakistan standards for environmental quality correspond to the WBG EHS Guidelines, however 
in case of differences, more stringent standards are applicable. The EIAs, IEEs and EMPs provide 
the applicable environmental standards on water quality, air quality, noise level, and vibrations. 
58. 
Occupational and Community Health and Safety (OHS). ADB requires that the PMO 
and PIO, through the contractors, will ensure that the workers are provided with a safe and healthy 
environmental,  considering  risks  inherent  to  the  sector  and  specific  classes  of  hazards  in  the 
subproject  areas  including  physical,  chemical,  and  biological  hazards.  The  PMO  and  PIO  will 
establish preventive measures and plans to address risks and impacts and potential exposure of 
surrounding communities to both accidental and natural hazards, especially where the structural 
elements of the project are accessible to members of the affected community or where their failure 
could result in injury to the community. The PMO and PIO will avoid or minimize the exacerbation 
of impacts caused by natural hazards, such as landslides or floods, that could result from project 
activities. The PMO and PIO shall be prepared to respond to accidental and emergency situations. 
This  preparation  shall  include  response  planning  document(s)  that  addresses  the  training, 
43 
resources, responsibilities, communications, procedures, and other aspects required to respond 
effectively to emergencies associated with project hazards. 
59. 
Consultation  and  Stakeholders  Participation.  Stakeholders  to  be  affected  by  the 
project  activities  have  been  consulted  during  preparation  of  the  EIA.  During  project 
implementation,  meaningful  consultations24 will  be  carried  out  with  affected  people  and  other 
concerned stakeholders including civil societies and facilitate their informed participation. The EIA 
includes a Stakeholders Engagement Plan (SEP) developed to ensure balanced and sustainable 
relationship  between  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies,  PMO,  PIO,  and  affected 
communities  throughout  the  project  cycle.  The  SEP  identified  the  project  stakeholders  and 
external  stakeholders,  timing  for  engagement,  issues  and  risks  to  the  project,  and  resources 
required. SEP. The goal of the SEP is smooth implementation of overall project activities while 
maintaining good relationship with external stakeholders, to help the project team to understand 
stakeholders’  concerns and  perceptions,  and to provide feedbacks  and anticipation  in  a  timely 
manner.  A  dedicated  PMO  staff  under  the  Environmental  Safeguards  Unit, (Deputy  Director 
Communication or  higher)  would  be  assigned  for  effective  implementation  of  the  SEP.  SEP 
activities and its results are to be documented and included in the periodic monitoring reports to 
be submitted to ADB.  
60. 
Information Disclosure. The PID, PMO, and POI shall ensure that the EIA, monitoring 
reports and corrective action plans, if any,  are disclosed by: (i) uploading on project websites, 
(ii) translating the EIA’s Executive Summary, monitoring reports, and corrective action plan into 
Urdu; (iii) placing hard copies of approved EIA and with the translated Executive Summary in the 
offices  of  PMO,  PIO  and  representatives  of  affected  people;  and  (iv)  informing  affected 
communities  of  significant  potential  hazards  in  a  culturally  appropriate  manner.  Appropriate 
information about the project’s emergency preparedness and response activities, resources, and 
responsibilities shall also be disclosed to affected communities. 
Grievance  Redress  Mechanism.  The  PMO  and  PIO  will  establish  the  grievance 
61. 
redressal mechanism (GRM) to receive and facilitate  resolution  of  affected people’s  concerns, 
complaints and grievances about the project and its subprojects’ environmental performance. The 
grievance mechanism  shall  be  scaled to the  risks  and  adverse impacts  of  the  subproject.  The 
Contractors will be required to assist in receiving, recording, and coordinating with PMUs on field-
level complaints/grievances. The detailed project-level GRM is included in the EIA and may be 
tailored to consider contractor’s roles and project-specific site conditions. 
Environmental  safeguards implementation  arrangement.  The  PMO  has established 
62. 
an Environment and Social Unit with a full-time Director (Social and Environment) and a Deputy 
Director  (Environment).  The  PMO  will  be  assisted  by  construction  supervision  consultant’s 
(CSC’s) environment specialists. The PMO will ensure that: 
(i) 
Over-all  compliance  of  the  project  with  ADB  SPS  requirements  and  applicable 
laws, rules, and regulations on environment, health, and safety; 
24 Per ADB SPS, meaningful consultation is defined as “a process that (i) begins early in the project preparation stage 
and is carried out on an ongoing basis throughout the project cycle; (ii) provides timely disclosure of relevant and 
adequate  information  that  is  understandable  and  readily  accessible  to  affected  people;  (iii)  is  undertaken  in  an

B. 
Land Acquisition and Resettlement 
69. 
The project is classified as category A for involuntary resettlement. About 2,279 ha (5,632 
acre) of land (of which 1,488 ha are privately owned and 791 ha are government land) will be 
required for the right of way of irrigation canals of the Choubara branch system under output 1. 
Approximately 4,686 households (29,628 persons) will be affected. Of these, 35 households will 
need  to  be  relocated.  In  total,  approximately  123,186  trees  and  crops  on  4,395  acres  will  be 
affected. The number of affected structures will be approximately 226.  
70. 
Of the 1,488 ha of privately owned land, approximately 1,481 ha. of land (99.5% of the 
private land required) have been acquired between 2008 and 2011. This is well in advance of 
ADB’s  financing  to  the  Choubara  branch  system  which  was  discussed  in  early  2019.  It  was 
identified, however, nearly half of the landowners (of the impacted area) were not compensated 
when  the  progress  and  status  of  the  government’s  land  acquisition  process  was  assessed  in 
47 
February 2020. To address this legacy issue, the PID has agreed to take the following measures: 
(i) complete all the outstanding land compensation payment based on the original compensation 
rate determined in 2006, (ii) provide additional allowances for unpaid landowners to bridge the 
gap between the original compensation rate and current market rate, and (iii) meet any other ADB 
SPS  requirements.  For  the  already  acquired  land  (2,272  ha  of  land),  a  Corrective  Action  Plan 
(CAP)  has  been  prepared  based  on  the  due  diligence  conducted,  agreement  between  the 
Government  of  Punjab  and  ADB,  and  any  other  ADB  SPS  requirements.  On  the  other  hand, 
approximately 7 ha. of private land (among 1,488 ha. of total private land) will need to be newly 
acquired  for  the  right  of  way.  A  Land  Acquisition  and  Resettlement  Plan  (LARP)  has  been 
prepared for this purpose.  
71. 
Compensation will be provided for  land and any other affected assets above the entire 
2,279  ha.  of  land.  These  include  crops,  trees,  structures  etc.  as  per  ADB  SPS  requirements. 
Intensive  public  consultations  and  information  dissemination  campaigns  which  covered  all  the 
affected villages and settlements in the project area have been conducted all through the project 
preparation period. The CAP and LARP were disclosed on ADB website in August 2021. Although 
intensive due diligence was conducted, additional assessment and data collection will be required 
during CAP implementation stage. This is to avoid missing any eligible AHs and APs of the project 
and  to  ensure ADB  SPS  requirement.  Additional surveys and  assessments  are for:  (i)  poverty 
assessment and vulnerability profiling, (ii) impact assessment and livelihood profiling (especially. 
Livestock farming) in Rakh areas, and (iii) preparation of community development program based 
on the findings from the assessments mentioned earlier.  With regards to output 2, land will be 
required for the construction of watercourses. The required land and any asset will be provided 
by  the  farmers  and  local  communities  as  counterpart  support.  Involuntary  resettlement  is  not 
involved.  Safeguard measures to  ensure  that  contributions  are  voluntary  and  documented  are 
explained below. 
72. 
Based on the above, the project is categorized A for involuntary resettlement safeguard. 
The government through PID and PMO will ensure that the design of the GTC Irrigation Project 
minimizes land acquisition and resettlement impacts by exploring design alternatives and all other 
activities  under  the  project  are  carried  out  in  full  compliance  with  all  applicable  laws  and 
regulations of Pakistan, ADB’s SPS (2009), and the approved CAP/LARP. PID and PMO shall 
ensure that: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
(v) 
(vi) 
the final and implementation-ready LARP following the  final detailed design and 
notification of Section 5 of the LAA is submitted to ADB for review and approval 
prior to its implementation; 
the final and implementation ready LARP duly endorsed by PID are disclosed to 
displaced persons (DPs) in their local language in accordance with the ADB’s SPS 
(2009); 
a qualified and experienced external resettlement monitor, acceptable to ADB, is 
timely recruited to verify CAP and LARP implementation progress and recommend 
issuance of no-objection by ADB to commencing of civil works;   
Handling over of site/commencing of civil works is made only upon completion of 
the CAP and LARP implementation as verified by an external resettlement monitor; 
all  land  and  rights  of  way  required  by  the  project  shall  be  cleared  and  made 
available  in  a  timely  manner  in  accordance  with  the  schedule  as  agreed  in  the 
relevant civil works contract;  
CAP and LARP implementation shall be monitored internally by PMO with support 
of PIC following monitoring parameters specified in the CAP and LARP (particular 
attention  needs  to  be  paid  to  the  progress  and  result  of  the  relocation  of  the 
vulnerable households). The PMO Social and Environment Unit assisted by PIC 
48 
to  day 
internal  supervision  and  monitoring  of  LARP 
will  conduct  day 
implementation progress to ensure compliance with the provisions of the LARPs 
for work package. The LARP implementation progress shall be consolidated into 
semi-annual  internal  resettlement  monitoring  reports  to  be  shared  with  ADB  for 
review. While bi-annual monitoring and evaluation reports prepared by an external 
monitor  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  for  review  and  clearance  throughout  project 
implementation period. Upon clearance of bi-annual monitoring reports by ADB, 
these will be disclosed by uploading on PID and ADB websites; 
(viii) 
(vii)  without limiting the application of the Involuntary Resettlement Safeguards or the 
LARP, PID and PMO shall ensure that no land shall be acquired for the purpose 
of  the  project  under  the  emergency  acquisition  provisions  of  Pakistan's  Land 
Acquisition Act (1894), as amended from time to time;  
the activities of the civil works contractor for the project are in compliance with the 
approved  LARP  and  no  physical  displacement  or  economic  displacement  shall 
occur and section or part of a section is handed over to the civil works contractor 
until:  (a)  compensation  at  full  replacement  cost  has  been  paid  to  all  affected 
persons  in  accordance  with  the  final  LARP  for  relevant  civil  works  contract 
packages or sections that are ready to be constructed; (b) other entitlements listed 
in the CAP and LARP have been provided to affected persons; and (c) CAP and 
LARP implementation report prepared by the external monitor is submitted to ADB 
and determined as satisfactory;  
Continued  efforts  shall  be  made  to  link  DPs,  especially  those  who  are  severely 
affected  and  vulnerable, 
livelihood 
opportunities and available livelihood support programs and training in the project 
area; and 
In  case  landowners  have  grievances  on  the  amount  of  compensation  for  land, 
project  level  GRM  will  review  them  in  coordination  with  revenue  department.  If 
such  grievance  redress  efforts  cannot  resolve  the  grievances,  PID/PMO  will 
engage an independent valuer to ascertain the full replacement cost of the land 
plots, where grievances are filed, and provide additional compensation/allowance 
to bridge the gap between the full replacement cost and original land compensation 
rate, if any.

Any unanticipated  land acquisition  and resettlement (LAR)  impacts  encountered  during 
implementation of project will be dealt in accordance with the ADB approved CAP and LARP and 
ADB’s  SPS  2009  requirements.  However,  change  to  the  scope,  location  or  alignment  of  the 
project shall be avoided. If during the implementation of the project, any such change to the scope, 
location or alignment of the project is identified, it shall not be made without prior approval of ADB. 
Any new LAR-related impacts as a result of changing in project scope, location or alignment will 
require a new LARP or LARP addendum which should be submitted to ADB for its approval. The 
additional  plan  should  be  prepared  following  ADB’s  SPS  and  its  required  guidelines.  No 
construction  activities  shall  be  commenced  in  the  sections  with  new/additional  LAR  impacts 
before full implementation of ADB approved LARP is confirmed and cleared by ADB. 
Under Output 2 of the project, a total of 1,347watercourses will be constructed. These will 
74. 
be planned, designed, and constructed through close consultation with, and participation by the 
beneficiary farmers, who will be organized into water users’ associations (WUAs).  These will be 
responsible for O&M of watercourses and associated structures. The formation of WUAs will be 
guided and the capacity of WUAs will be strengthened by trainings under technical supervision 
and guidance by PAD. The land is provided by the farmer beneficiaries and local communities as 
counterpart  support  including  other  assets  such  as  trees  and  labor,  therefore  involuntary 
49 
resettlement is not involved. As a safeguard measure, PAD and PIO, with support from the PMC 
shall undertake the following: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
(v) 
(vi) 
Early  screening  of  the  watercourse  development  will  be  undertaken  to  fully 
determine the land requirements, impacts and existence of dispute and any other 
encumbrances on the land required. Meaningful consultations will be undertaken 
in good faith with all potential land donors throughout the screening, planning and 
implementation phases of each project. Consultations will be recorded in detail 
and will include all discussions in relation to the donation of land, if applicable. 
Where land donation is required, written agreements must be obtained from each 
person donating land. For community or collective land, donation can only occur 
with the consent of all individuals using or occupying the land. 
No physical displacement should occur as a result of land donation (not only the 
landowners themselves but also tenants or labor, if any). Furthermore, donation 
should  not result  in  more  than  10%  of total  productive  agricultural  land  holding 
donated  by  any  individual  household,  or  more  than  10%  loss  of  any  other 
productive  or  income  generating  asset.  No  individual  household  should  be 
impoverished by the land donation. 
Donated lands for the watercourse will be legally transferred to the WUA. Only 
watercourse alignment where there is written confirmation of agreement among 
all concerned landowners/farmers will be included under the Project. 
The progress and status of the voluntary land donation will be monitored by PAD 
and  will  be  shared  with  ADB  through  semi-annual  social  safeguard  monitoring 
report.  
A grievance redress mechanism will be put in place under the PAD and PIO, with 
representation of the farmer beneficiaries, and local government. A grievance log 
will  be  established  prior  to  project  implementation  and  will  be  available  for 
inspection and reporting by project monitors. 
Grievance  Redress:  The  PID  and  PMO  shall  ensure  (i)  efficient  grievance  redress

mechanisms  are  in  place  and  functional  prior  starting  CAP  and  LARP  implementation  and 
contractor’s mobilization to assist DPs resolve queries and complaints, if any, in a timely manner; 
(ii)  all  complaints  are  registered,  investigated  and  resolved  in  a  manner  consistent  with  the 
provisions of Grievance Redress Mechanism as agreed in the ADB approved CAP and LARP; 
(iii) the Complainants/aggrieved persons are kept informed about status of their grievances and 
remedies available to them; and (iv) adequate staff and resources are available for supervising 
and monitoring the implementation progress of the CAP and LARP. Similarly, PAD and PIO will 
set up an efficient grievance redress mechanism prior to mobilization of farmers and WUAs under 
Output 2 of the project to ensure that disputes and concerns among farmer beneficiaries are acted 
upon and resolved timely, including issues related to land donations and other contributions.  
Information Disclosure and Stakeholder Participation: PID and PMO shall ensure that 
76. 
the CAP, LARP and monitoring reports are disclosed by: (i) uploading the CAP and LARP on PID 
and ADB websites, (ii) placing hard copies of approved CAP and LARP translated into Urdu in 
the  offices  of  PMO,  District  Revenue  Department,  PIC  and  representatives  of  DPs,  and 
(iii) translating the executive summary of ADB approved CAP and LARP, bearing information on 
project  impacts,  asset  valuation,  entitlements,  compensation  budget  and  provisions  with 
institutional arrangements in place and providing to the affected community. PMO, with support 
from the PIC shall: (i) conduct additional consultations and regular field visits during updating and 
implementation  of  the  CAP  and  LARP;  (ii)  inform  DPs  about:  (a)  resettlement  impacts,  asset 
valuation,  entitlements  and  compensation  payment  modalities  with  timelines,  (b)  rehabilitation 
and  income  restoration  measures  suggested  for  the  DPs;  and  (iii)  hold  regular  meetings  with 
50 
surrounding  communities  and  DPs  including  women  and  vulnerable  groups  to  share  project 
related information during project implementation period. 
C.  
Indigenous Peoples 
77. 
The project is screened as category C for Indigenous peoples planning requirement under 
SPS 2009 as there are no known IP communities within the project area. If during implementation, 
any change to the scope, location or alignment of the canal IPs are identified and found to be 
affected by the project, PID shall take all steps required to ensure that the project complies with 
the applicable laws and regulations of Pakistan and the ADB’s Safeguard Policy Statement 2009.  
78. 
Prohibited investment activities. Pursuant to ADB’s SPS (2009), ADB funds may not 
be applied to the activities described on the ADB Prohibited Investment Activities List set forth at 
Appendix 5 of the SPS (2009).  
VIII.   GENDER AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS 
The  rural  population  comprises  63%  of  the  country’s  total  population  in  2019.26 Farm-
79. 
based economic activities contribute 40% of rural households’ income. About 75% of women and 
girls in the labor force27 are employed in the agriculture sector, but only 19% of them are in paid 
employment. The high cost of quality agricultural inputs, limited access to land, and lack of access 
to  processing  and  storage  facilities  are  among  the  problems  that  women  farmers  face  in 
Pakistan.28 Poverty incidence is higher in rural areas. In Punjab, about 27% of the population still 
live below the poverty line.29   
80. 
Agriculture generates about 40% of the provincial labor force and remains the dominant 
source of income and livelihoods in rural Punjab. About 66% percent of women in the province’s 
labor force are in the agriculture sector compared to men, of whom only 29% are employed in 
agriculture  in  2018.30 The proposed  project  will  benefit  rural  people  living  in  about  80  villages, 
whose main sources of livelihood are agriculture and livestock rearing which are declining. Direct 
target beneficiaries will be smallholder farmers. There are estimated 35,000 farming households 
(or 217,000 persons) in the target area which will directly benefit from the project. It is likely that 
with  command  area  development  this  will  increase  with  potentially  up  to  84,500  farming 
households (or 524,000 persons). Households headed by women in the project area comprise 
1%. 
The project’s baseline study shows that patriarchal practices are strongly observed in the 
81. 
villages, which restrict women’s involvement in activities outside of the home. Women household 
members perform all unpaid care and domestic work. They also contribute to seasonal agricultural 
work as unpaid family labor. Kitchen gardens are not common in the villages. Livestock production 
and  marketing  at  the  village  level  are  women’s  main  economic  activities.  Women  have  weak 
access  to  health  and  education  services  as  facilities  are  located  in towns.  In  the  project  area, 
literacy  rate  among  adult  women  is  only  22%  compared  to  58%  for  men.  The  lack  of  middle 
schools and high schools in the villages contribute to the high dropout rate among girls.

The project is classified as effective gender mainstreaming (EGM) and will address the 
82. 
gender  issues  identified  through  the  following  measures:  (i)  installation  of  irrigation  system 
infrastructure with washing points, cattle baths, and crossing points in strategic locations of the 
irrigation system, (ii) inclusion of women as members of WUAs, (iii) training women in irrigated 
agricultural practices crop production, and on-farm water management; (iv) organizing of women’s 
community-based groups who are non-WUA members; and (v) increasing the number of female 
extension workers and trainers in PAD for social mobilization of women in the project areas. The 
project  will  design  and  implement  a  social  development  program  to  help  address  human  and 
social  development  needs  of  women  and  girls,  with  the  following  target  actions:  (i) conduct 
vocational training for women who are not engaged in farming to expand their income sources; 
(ii) provide basic social services on health and education such as procurement of equipment for 
basic health unit; and (iii) upgrade a girls’ primary school to middle school. 
83. 
The executing and implementing agencies through the PMO and PIO, is responsible for 
the achievement of the GAP targets and will ensure the implementation, monitoring, and reporting 
of  the  project’s  gender  targets  in  the  GAP.  Resources  will  be  allocated  for  gender  activity 
monitoring and reporting. The Gender Specialist as project implementation consultant, will provide 
technical support for implementing, monitoring, and reporting on the GAP targets

b  Women’s gender roles in the project areas hold them responsible for water collection for household use and care for livestock.  The construction of passage bridges 
will allow women to draw and carry water safely, for household cleaning, and for their kitchen gardens.  The construction of cattle baths will enable women to 
provide their cattle with access to water, and to ensure the safety of their cattle. This facilitates women’s work in the household as well as in their roles in livestock 
production.

B. 
Monitoring  
84. 
Project  performance  monitoring.  The  PID  will  develop  a  comprehensive  project 
performance  monitoring  and  evaluation  (M&E)  system.  It  will  closely  monitor  the  progress  of 
project activities, outputs, and outcomes based on the project performance monitoring system in 
accordance with the DMF. In particular, the project performance monitoring system will assess 
the following outputs and indicators (i) progress of planned activities according to the milestones; 
(ii) progress in achieving each project output and project outcome according to the performance 
targets and indicators indicated in DMF, and (iii) social and economic benefits with focus on the 
poor  and  women.  The  PAD  will  provide  inputs  of  relevant  data  to  the  monitoring  system.  The 
PAD’s activities will continue after PID complete their activities. The M&E system will be handed 
over  to  the  PAD  upon  the  completion  of  PID’s  activities,  and  the  PAD  will  be  responsible  for 
updating the M&E data until the end of the project  
85. 
Information and data gathered during project implementation period will be analyzed and 
measured against the targets and published regularly on the project website. The PID and PAD 
will prepare separate progress and completion reports. Refer to D. Reporting below.  
86. 
All project assurances including policy, legal, financial, economic, physical, environmental, 
gender, and other safeguard measures will be monitored through progress reports, and during 
project review missions. Refer to C. Evaluation and D. Reporting below. 
87. 
ADB will also monitor the progress of achievement of each output and outcome based on 
performance indicators with targets, and each activity based on milestones indicated in the DMF 
through a project management information system (i.e., eOps). 
88. 
Compliance  monitoring.  All  project  assurances  including  policy,  legal,  financial, 
economic,  physical,  environmental,  gender,  and  other  safeguard  measures  will  be  monitored 
through quarterly progress reports and twice a year during ADB loan review missions. 
issues/concerns/complaints,  and  recommended  corrective  actions 
89. 
Safeguards  monitoring.  ADB’s  monitoring  and supervision  on  safeguards compliance 
will be carried out on an ongoing basis until the project completion report is issued. The project 
quarterly progress report shall include the external monitoring report on environmental safeguards 
compliance, 
for  non-
compliances, if any. The external monitoring report will be disclosed on ADB website. The PMO 
Environment and Social Unit, with support of the CSC environmental specialists, will prepare the 
semi-annual environmental monitoring report (SAEMR) for submission to ADB commencing six 
months  after  loan  effectiveness  until  ADB  issues  the  project  completion  report.  The  SAEMR 
covering January to June will be due by 30 July, and SAEMR covering July to December will be 
due by 30 January. Once concurrence from the ADB is received the SAEMRs will be disclosed 
on ADB website.  
90. 
The PMO resettlement specialist will oversee the internal resettlement monitoring of CAP 
and  LARP  implementation,  with  support  from  the  consultant  safeguards  team.  External 
resettlement monitoring and compliance monitoring will be conducted by an independent external 
monitoring agency (EMA) or individual external monitor to be hired by PMO. Internal and external 
resettlement monitoring reports will be submitted on a semi-annual basis to ADB for review and 
disclosure.  All  monitoring  reports  will  also  be  disclosed  to  the  displaced  persons  including  the 
preparation of corrective action plan(s). As a condition of ADB for no-objection in handing over of 
site  for  commencing  civil  works  for  packages  with  LAR  impacts,  an  internal  and  external 
report  confirming  completion  of  compensation  activities,  provision  of 
resettlement 
58 
transition/rehabilitation allowances and fulfillment of all LAA requirements for land award will be 
submitted to ADB for review and approval. 
91. 
Gender and social dimensions monitoring. The PMO and PIO will be supported by the 
gender specialist in the project implementation support consultant teams. The PMO and PIO will 
be  responsible  for  monitoring  the  implementation  of  the  gender  action  plan  and  the  PMO  will 
report  consolidated  progress  data  on  the  progress  of  GAP  implementation  through  its  periodic 
progress reports. All the gender targets will be monitored using ADB’s GAP monitoring framework. 
This  will  be  informed  through  regular  collection of  data  disaggregated  by  sex,  age,  and where 
possible, disability, relevant to the indicators and targets in the GAP and DMF. The PMO gender 
specialist will provide information to review missions, including the mid-term review mission and 
project completion mission. 
C. 
Evaluation 
92. 
Inception mission.  ADB  will  conduct  an  inception  mission  within three months  of  loan 
effectiveness to assess project readiness and start-up activities, including staffing of PMO, PIOs, 
opening of an advance account, progress of recruitment of two consulting services packages, and 
progress of the Choubara branch construction works package procurement. The updated project 
implementation schedule will also be discussed.  
93. 
Review mission.  ADB  will  regularly  field  review  missions  to  (i)  assess  the  progress  of 
project  activities,  (ii)  monitor  the  implementation  of  GAP  and  safeguard  compliance  with  ADB 
Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  (iii)  review  compliance  with  loan  agreements  and  related 
matters, and (v) resolve any project implementation issues that may arise.  
94.  Midterm review mission. ADB will conduct a midterm review in the third year of project 
implementation.  The  midterm  review  will  (i)  assess  the  project  performance  and  achievement 
against targets and milestones in the DMF; (ii) review the initial outcomes, benefits, and impact 
of  the  project,  and  (iii)  identify  gaps,  if  any,  and  recommend  necessary  changes to  strengthen 
implementation arrangements or modify project design.   
Project completion review mission. ADB will field a project completion review mission 
95. 
upon physical completion of the project to commence preparation of ADB’s project completion 
report.  The  mission  will  (i)  assess  the  project  performance  against  targets,  indicators,  and 
benchmarks;  (ii)  evaluate  initial  benefits  and  outcome  of  the  project  across  outputs,  and  (iii) 
identify any incomplete activities and agree on the necessary actions.  
D. 
Reporting  
The  PID  and  PAD  will  prepare  separate  reports  The  PID  through  PMO  and  the  PAD 
96. 
through PIO will provide ADB with (i) quarterly progress reports in a format consistent with ADB's 
project  performance  reporting  system;  (ii)  consolidated  annual  reports  including  (a)  progress 
achieved  by  output  as  measured  through  the  indicator's  performance  targets,  (b)  key 
implementation  issues  and  solutions,  (c)  updated  procurement  plan,  and  (d)  updated 
implementation plan for the next 12 months; and (iii) a project completion report within 6 months 
of physical completion of the project. To ensure that projects will continue to be both viable and 
sustainable,  project  accounts  and the  audited financial  statement together  with  the  associated 
auditor's report, should be adequately reviewed. 
E. 
Stakeholder Communication Strategy  
97. 
Project information will be strategically disseminated through media at main milestones 
including loan signing, contract awards and project completion. A grievance redress mechanism 
will be established at the PMO Barrages, by phone and email, and through public consultation 
events. The documents to be disclosed are in the table below.

ANTICORRUPTION POLICY 
ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any violations of the 
98. 
Anticorruption  Policy  relating  to  the  project. 31  All  contracts  financed  by  ADB  shall  include 
provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the 
executing agency and all project contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers. 
Individuals and/or entities on ADB’s anticorruption debarment list are ineligible to participate in 
ADB-financed activity and may not be awarded any contracts under the project.32  
99. 
To support these efforts, relevant provisions are included in the loan agreement and the 
bidding  documents for  the  project.  The Government  will  comply  with,  and  will  ensure  that  PID 
complies  with,  ADB’s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date).  The  Government, 
consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability and transparency, agrees (a) 
that ADB has the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, 
collusive  or  coercive  practices  relating  to the  project;  and (b)  to  cooperate  fully  with  any  such 
investigation and to extend all necessary assistance, including providing access to all relevant 
books and records, as may be necessary for the satisfactory completion of any such investigation. 
In  addition,  the  Government  will  (a)  conduct  periodic  inspections  on  the  contractors’  activities 
related  to  fund  withdrawals  and  settlements;  (b)  ensure  that  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in 
connection with the project include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine 
the records and accounts of all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as 
they relate to the project; and (c) the project implementation consultant shall verify the contractors’ 
invoices in accordance with working drawings and contract specifications. 
XI. 
ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISM 
100.  Persons  who  are,  or  in  future  may  be,  adversely  affected  by  the  project  may  submit 
complaints  to  ADB’s  Accountability  Mechanism.  The  Accountability  Mechanism  provides  an 
independent forum and process whereby people adversely affected by ADB-assisted projects can 
voice,  and  seek  a  resolution  of  their  problems,  as  well  as  report  alleged  violations  of  ADB’s 
operational  policies  and  procedures.  Before  submitting  a  complaint  to  the  Accountability 
Mechanism, affected people should make an effort in good faith to solve their problems by working 
with  the  concerned  ADB  operations  department.  Only  after  doing  that,  and  if  they  are  still 
dissatisfied, should they approach the Accountability Mechanism.33

APPENDIX 1: DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION  
I. 
Overall Scope and History 
The Greater Thal Canal (GTC) irrigation scheme will convert about 704,000 hectares (ha) 
1. 
of  arid  or  semiarid  unproductive  lands in Bhakkar, Jhang,  Muzaffargarh,  Khushab  and  Layyah 
districts  of  Punjab  to  irrigated  productive  lands.  Detailed  structural  design  for  the  entire  GTC 
scheme was completed by the federal government, namely the Water and Power Development 
Authority (WAPDA) in 2005, and the Main Canal and the first branch system (Mankera) that cover 
about  144,000  ha  of  command  areas  have  been  constructed  by  WAPDA  in  2009.  On-farm 
command  area  development  (CAD)  activities  were  not  included  in  the  original  investments  by 
WAPDA, and were being partially conducted in the main canal and Mankera branch areas by the 
provincial government’s financing with a partial support of the World Bank’s project.  
2. 
The  development  of  the  GTC  scheme  was shifted  from  WAPDA  to the  Government  of 
Punjab.  Detailed  structural  design  for  the  Choubara  branch  system  was updated  by  a  team  of 
national consultants financed by the Punjab Irrigation Department (PID) in 2017-2019. However, 
the construction of the Choubara and subsequent branch system has not been commenced and 
the progress of CAD has been slow. Only 25% to 30% of command areas in the Main Canal and 
Mankera  command  areas  have  been  developed.  Table  A1-a1  at  the  end  of  this  appendix  -
summarizes the  current  status  of  each  branch system  of  the  GTC  scheme  and  Figure  A1-a1 
shows the overall GTC scheme. Table A1-a2 summarizes chronogeny.  
3. 
The proposed ADB-financed project  will  support  the  construction  of  the second  branch 
system (Choubara) covering about 119,000 ha, along with support for on-farm CAD for the Main 
Canal, Mankera and Choubara areas and capacity development of the government entities and 
water  users  for  efficient  water  uses  and  management,  improved  agricultural  practices  and 
sustainability of infrastructure. The proposed project is designed as the first project of potential 
phased-support for sequentially completing the development of the entire GTC scheme as in the 
indicative table below.

II. 
Overall Approach 
The project will contribute to enhancing food security and rural economic growth in Punjab 
4. 
Province.  It  will  increase  the  agricultural  production  of  the  project  area  by  developing  a  new 
irrigation system. 
Appendix 1        63 
5. 
The proposed project is built onto lessons learnt from the government’s interventions in 
the Main Canal and Mankera branch areas. Irrigation canals in these areas were constructed in 
2009, but only about 25%-30% of command areas have been developed. A CAD component was 
not included in the previous interventions and studies. Key challenges identified for the CAD in 
the GTC area are: (i) 6-months nonflow period in a non-perennial irrigation scheme during which 
unlined channels may be buried by blowing sands, and (ii) water conveyance and application to 
farms in the undulated terrain.  
6. 
Major  lessons  are:  (i)  support  for  on-farm  CAD  should  be  integrated  into  infrastructure 
development;  (ii)  CAD  should  be  coupled  with  capacity  development  of  farmers  for  better 
agricultural practice and efficient water uses; (iii) higher extent of water course lining than other 
areas  is  to  be  considered  for  the  project  area  with  sandy  and  undulated  topography;  (iv) 
awareness  campaign,  demonstrations  and  subsidies  for  high  efficiency  irrigation  and  other 
technologies applicable to sandy undulated lands are to be included; (v) measures for minimizing 
sediment  deposits  or  structural  design  for  easier  sand  removal  are  to  be  applied  to  irrigation 
canals and field watercourses for a non-perennial system with sand dunes, (vi) close coordination 
between the PID and PAD will create the environment of quicker CAD; (vii) water use efficiency 
and conjunctive use of surface and ground waters need to be considered in the CAD planning; 
and (iv) on-farm command area development including the construction of watercourses should 
adapt  a  participatory  approach  to  increase  the  ownership  of  farmers  which  will  contribute  to 
sustainability of the structures. Overall project design, components, activities and implementation 
arrangement are developed accordingly.  
Water allocation for the entire GTC scheme has been determined and approved by the 
7. 
Indus  River  System  Authority  in  2002  within  the  provincial  allocation  under  the  Water 
Apportionment  Accord.  The  proposed  ADB-financed  project  will  not  alter  the  approved  water 
allocation.  
III. 
Proposed Project 
The  proposed  ADB-financed  project  will  include  the  components,  namely  anticipated 
9. 
outputs, below:  
•  Output 1 (PID): Irrigation system infrastructure for Choubara system developed. 
•  Output  2  (PAD):  On-farm  command  area  developed  with  enhanced  capacity  of 
stakeholders including PAD and beneficiaries; and  
•  Output  3  (PID):  Institutional  system  for  irrigation  scheme  and  water  resource 
management strengthened. 
A. 
Output 1 (PID): Irrigation system infrastructure for Choubara system developed 
10. 
This component will include (i) construction of the Choubara branch system up to tertiary 
canals  (minors),  (ii)  tree  planting  along  irrigation  canals  for  the  Main  Canal  and  Mankera  and 
Choubara  branch  systems,  (iii)  de-siltation  of  the  existing  Main  Canal  and  Mankera  Branch 
systems  to  revive  their  functions,  (iv)  construction  of  PID  operational  administration  buildings 
(colonies and a site office), and implementation of a social development action plan.  
Construction of the Choubara branch system. The construction will include 72 km of 
11. 
the branch main canal; totaling 251 km of 11 secondary canals, i.e., distributaries; totaling 127 
64        Appendix 1 
km  of  11  tertiary  canals,  i.e.,  minors  and  associated  structures,  such  as  gated  regulators  and 
canal crossing bridges.  
12. 
The branch main Choubara branch canal (72 km) and the longest distributary (Choubara 
distributary, 50 km) with Choubara minor (34km) are designed to be lined. The other distributaries 
and minors are planned to be unlined. The complete lining is expected to bring more stable canal 
sections,  higher  water  conveyance  efficiency,  less  water  losses,  and  easier  maintenance 
especially  easier  sand  deposited  removals  of  the  non-perennial  canals  in  sandy  topography. 
Meanwhile, the partial lining is expected to bring improved economic viability with reduced total 
construction cost and groundwater recharging. In addition, as canals are impacted by wind-blown 
(sandstorm) sand movement which is highly likely to be deposited into an empty canal during the 
dry (rabi) season, desilting and removal of sediment is required. Concrete lined canals require 
careful  machinery  operation  during  cleaning  and  damage to  the  lining  is  possible.  One  of  key 
points for lining decision is groundwater quality. Groundwater recharge is beneficial only when 
groundwater quality is suitable for irrigation. However, existing groundwater quality data are not 
adequate  to  determine  temporary  distributions  of  lining  necessity.  A  windbreak  effect  of  the 
proposed tree planting along canals could also mitigate siltation of the irrigation canals. Hence, 
the proposed project will start with partial lining of the irrigation canals and groundwater monitoring 
equipment  installation  (paras.  29  to  30).  Additional  lining  may  be  discussed  during  the  project 
implementation after acquiring groundwater quality and silt deposit data in the project area.  
13.  Management,  operation  and  maintenance  roles  and  responsibilities  for  the  system 
infrastructure are highlighted in a separate supplementary document to the RRP.  
Tree planting along canals (branch, distributaries and minors) for the Main canal and 
14. 
Mankera  and  Choubara  branch  systems  is  to  be  included  as  a  wind  break  that  mitigates 
sedimentation  in  the  canals  (and  to  reduce  evapotranspiration  losses)  -  three  rows  of  tree 
windbreaks each side of the main branch canal and two rows each side of the secondary and 
tertiary canals (distributaries and minors). The existing right of way (ROW) delineated by WAPDA 
includes tree planting spaces along the canals, but trees were not planted when the Main Canal 
and Mankera branch systems were constructed. The planting will be included in the civil works 
contract, but the PID will prepare cost estimate and technical specifications based on technical 
advice from the Forest, Wildlife, and Fisheries (FWF) Department.  
15. 
De-siltation of Main Canal and Mankera Branch system. Many of existing canals have 
silt deposits as the current flows are less than the design capacity due to low water demand in 
the underdeveloped command areas. The proposed project will cover sediment removal for the 
existing  Main  Canal  and  Mankera  branch  system, 
the  possible  earliest 
commencement of CAD activities. In total, approximately 1.9 million m³ will need to be removed:

• 
Main Canal - 1,489,843 m³ 
Mankera Main Branch - 156,035 m³ 
Mankera distributaries and minors - 290,873 m³ 
Silt can be deposited on the side of the canal to act as an additional windbreak or for land 
16. 
levelling  if  there  are  depressions.  Thereafter  there  will  be  regular  desilting  using  PID’s  O&M 
budget. 
The canals are likely to be quickly re-silted under the current low flow due to low water 
17. 
demand. Hence, canal de-siltation by the PID and CAD planning by the PAD require coordination. 
The PID and PAD will jointly develop and implement distributary/minor-wise phasing (sequencing) 
Appendix 1        65 
desilting plan for the Main Canal and Mankera system areas by incorporating PAD’s CAD activity 
priority. The phased approach will enable efficient use of the budget. The desiltation planning will 
also consider hydraulics in the Main Canal and Mankera main branch canal. Full de-siltation is 
not required in these canals before the completion of entire CAD so that the water levels in the 
canals remain high enough to feed the distributaries during the transition period. 
18. 
PID operational administration buildings. Due to the vast size of the project area, the 
PID  needs  field  operational  administration  buildings  in  the  project  area  for  efficient  project 
implementation  and  irrigation  canal  operation.  This  will  include  construction  of  five  new  staff 
quarters (colonies) in Bhakkar, Adhikot, Choubara, Gouhar Wala and Haiderabad for those staff 
who will working on the management of the GTC scheme. Design has already been completed 
by the GTC Consultants.    
19. 
Social development action plan. As a result of the project, the population of the project 
area may increase due to returning landlords and an increase in the need for agricultural labor. 
To ensure that there is enough social infrastructure to cope with this influx a social development 
action plan will be implemented. The plan will include the upgrading of a girls’ primary to a middle 
school,  the  provision  of  pre-  and  post-natal  equipment  for  a  basic  health  unit,  and  vocational 
training for 1,000 males and females.  
The vocational training may include 1 month training on drafting and pattern marking, 1 
20. 
month training on home-based businesses, 1 month training on food processing and handicrafts, 
and 1 month training on marketing, and 1 month training on electrification (including electrification 
for food processing) and other activities that will contribute to local residents’ livelihoods. 
B. 
Output 2 (PAD): On-farm command area developed with enhanced capacity of 
stakeholders including PAD and beneficiaries 
This component will cover the Main Canal, Mankera branch and Choubara branch areas 
21. 
and will be designed in due consideration of lessons learnt in the previous interventions in the 
Main Canal and Mankera branch areas. CAD activities will include a combination of (i) strategic 
agriculture  land  development  planning;  (ii)  field  channels,  i.e.  watercourses,  construction  and 
lining of already constructed unlined watercourses, which includes social mobilization and water 
users association (WUA) formation; (iii) piloting for CAD and improved water productivity, such 
as rough and laser land leveling, high efficiency irrigation systems (HEIS), water storage ponds, 
and pipe lining of watercourses, etc.; (iv) capacity development of farmers on improved on-farm 
water management and good agricultural practices including awareness campaign for farmers, 
extension  services  like  farmer  field  schools  and  provision  of  high  yielding  seeds,  (v)  capacity 
development of the PAD; and (vi) construction of PAD site buildings. CAD in the project area also 
has  to  consider  the  dune  stabilization,  but  given  discussions  between  the  PAD  and  FWF 
Department, designated dune stabilization costs will not be included in the project cost, as FWF 
Department’s regular activities can cover necessary dune stabilization support in the project area.  
22. 
Field channel (water course) construction and lining of already constructed unlined 
watercourses.  This  includes  the  construction  of  watercourses,  i.e.  small  field  channels,  that 
convey  water  from  irrigation  canals  to  individual  farmlands.  The  project  aims  to  complete  the 
construction of all of required watercourses in the Main Canal, Mankera and Choubara branch 
areas.  In  the  Main  Canal  and  Mankera  Branch  areas,  only  about  25%  to  30%  planned 
watercourses have been in operation. In these areas, 749 watercourses were originally planned. 
However, only 444 watercourses have been constructed. 11 of these have been lined as planned 
(50%  lining).  Of  the  remaining,  94  have  been  lined  from  15-30%  (22%  on  average),  339  are 
66        Appendix 1 
unlined (and most now silted up) and 305 are not yet constructed, and unlined or partially lined 
ones lined. The remaining watercourses are to be constructed under the proposed project. In the 
Choubara branch area, 609 planned watercourses are to be constructed. The PAD’s default of 
50% lining will be applied to 80% of watercourses, but the complete lining (100%) will be applied 
to the remaining 20% of watercourses as piloting. Lining is expected to bring easier maintenance 
of watercourses for farmers in sandy terrain. The proposed lining technique is precast concrete 
parabolic segment (PCPS) lining which has been promoted by PAD since 2004. While 50% lining 
is considered economically most optimal based on various research studies, for the sandy soils 
of  the  GTC  area,  a  higher  percentage lining  may  prove more  economically  beneficial.  Thus  in 
20%  of  the  watercourses,  lining  will  be  undertaken  on  100%  of  the  length,  and  cost/benefit 
analysis  will  be  undertaken  to  assess  an  optimum  lining  policy  depending  on  site-specific 
conditions. The watercourses that benefit the most number of farmers will be given priority for the 
complete (100%) lining. 
23. 
On a limited number of watercourses (30), concrete piped watercourses will be used on a 
pilot basis. This will be trialed in the Main and Mankera Branch areas and if found to be more 
economically advantageous than PCPS, it can be scaled up in the Choubara branch area as a 
replacement to PCPS.  
24. 
Piloting of buried pipe watercourses is also planned. Different materials may be tested, 
such as un-plasticized polyvinyl chloride (uPVC) or high-density polyethylene (HDPE) pipes. This 
buried  plastic  pipe  irrigation  distribution  system  is  expected  to  (i)  distribute  water  to  individual 
fields, (ii) achieve the highest water distribution efficiency of not less than 98%, (iii) apply water 
on demand basis, and (iv) facilitate accurate water metering. Water received (through hydrants) 
at the  fields could be  used  for  flood,  border, furrow,  drip,  or  sprinkler  irrigation.  This  system  is 
beneficial to water saving and water productivity, and to undulated terrain in the project area.

The works are small-scale and labor-intensive, and will be conducted based on community 
participation. The PAD will enter an agreement with community institutional structure, i.e., water 
users associations (WUAs), for design, execution, cost sharing, supervision and O&M of works. 
Beneficiaries  contribute land and will  be  involved  as labor,  while construction  materials  will  be 
Appendix 1        67 
provided by the PAD. This is estimated to be equivalent to 15% farmers’ contributions. To enable 
the  community  participation,  project  activities  will  start  with  social  mobilization  and  WUA 
formation. The PAD has experienced similar arrangements for other irrigation schemes including 
the  ADB-financed  Jalalpur  Canal  Irrigation  Project.  The  community  involvement  will  enhance 
ownership  through  cost-sharing  mechanism  and  followed  by  sustainability  of  watercourses 
through increased ownership. For further details on the community contracting mechanisms see 
Appendix 2 of this document. 
For  rough  land  leveling  and  clearing  lands  for  water  course  construction,  additional 
26. 
bulldozers  will  be  purchased  for  the  PAD  Agricultural  Engineering  Department  (Field  Wing). 
Approximately 11 will be needed fin MC and MBC command areas. These can then move to the 
CBC command area, where an additional 4 will be required (i.e., 15 in total). The covenant will be 
included in the Loan Agreement to ensure that they will be used within the project area.  
27. 
Piloting  for  CAD  and  improved  water  productivity.  Subsidies  will  be  provided  to 
encourage the take-up of improved techniques, leading to improved water productivity. This will 
be done on a pilot basis, with the hope that this then eventually encourages scale-up once farmers 
see the benefits. 
28. 
Land levelling. Only about 20-30% of the MC, MBC and CBC command area is patti area 
(flat lands), which can be irrigated immediately with minor land levelling (including laser levelling). 
The  rest  requires  land  development.  Five  bulldozers  will  be  purchased  to  undertake  land 
development work – in addition to the four unutilized during MC and MBC WC ROW clearing (see 
para 25), 915 ha can be cleared in the project lifetime. Additional area may be cleared with PAD’s 
current stock of bulldozers. Land levelling will clear the backlog of farmers who have been waiting 
for land development activities. Farmers will contribute a cost as per current PAD regulations – 
with costs per hour depending on the size of the farm with larger landholders paying more. The 
requirements  for  levelling  will  be  analyses  utilizing  Digital  Elevation  Models  (DEM)  that  were 
purchased under the transaction technical assistance for the project preparation. 
29.  Where applicable (i.e., on sandy loam soils as opposed to sandy soils) subsidies will be 
provide for laser levelling to be undertaken (estimated at 4,000 ha), with equipment hired from 
private machinery and equipment service providers, with costs shared between government and 
farmers at a ratio of 80:20. Selection criteria for farmers will be determined during implementation, 
but they are likely to include:

watercourse) who will act as the farmer field school (see subsequent paras). 
PAD will coordinate with the Forestry Department to be mutually benefitted from their sand 
31. 
dune stabilization (through planting vegetation) programs.  
32. 
Piloting  of  improved  on-farm  water  management  (OFWM)  technologies.  To 
encourage the take-up of improved OFWM technologies to improve water use efficiency, and to 
foster  crop  diversification  including  high  value  crops  (with  high  water-consuming  crops 
discouraged),  equipment  will  be  provided  on  a  subsidized  basis  (coupled  with  demonstrations 
which  should  also  incentivize  take-up  –  see  further  below).  This  will  include  HEIS  (drip  and 
sprinklers covering an estimated area of 4000 ha), the lining of 1000 tubewell watercourses (with 
PCPS or pipes), and 100 water retention ponds (800m3) constructed on a pilot basis to assess 
their efficacy, with an improved design building on lessons learned from previous practice. The 
government/farmer  contribution  will  be  80:20  (50:50  for  tubewell  watercourse  lining  with  a 
maximum subsidy of PKR 350,000 following current government regulations). Selection criteria 
for farmers to demonstrate this subsidized HEIS will be determined during the implementation, 
but are likely to include:  
a)

only  pumps  with  an  approved  energy  source  used  (the  HEIS  would  be  offered 
together with a pump with approved energy source).  
Appendix 1        69 
Preferably the farmer should also be a lead farmer (as identified by fellow farmers in the 
33. 
watercourse) who will act as the farmer field school. 
34. 
For the lining of tubewell watercourses, the selection criteria for should follow that of HEIS, 
with an additional criteria that only tubewells linked to a pumping system with an approved energy 
source, and high-value crop production will be piloted.  
35. 
Construction of 100 water storage ponds (WSP) (typically 20m x 20m x 2m deep) will be 
undertaken on pilot basis. These may be linked to HEIS as discussed above and can be used to 
store excess canal water, as well as rainwater and groundwater. During 2008-18 only 15 WSPs 
were  constructed  by  the  OFWM  Directorate,  which  were  later  abandoned  because  of  the 
excessive  leakage  and  evaporation  losses  of  water.  Therefore,  for  this  project  on  a  trial  basis 
ponds with improved lining will be constructed. Further technical details will be developed during 
the project implementation, depending upon field conditions, such as topography, land availability 
and soil permeability. Selection criteria will be determined during the project implementation, but 
are likely to include:

36.  WUAs may also be eligible for a pond on a group basis. The WUAs are expected to be 
registered  with an  agreement signed  to take  on O&M costs  and allow  equitable  access to the 
pond  amongst  members.  Details  will  be  further  examined  during  the  project  implementation 
depending on the actual needs of beneficiaries.  
Training for farmers and PAD on improved on-farm water management and good 
37. 
agricultural  practice.  Demonstration  and  training  for  farmers  will  be  done  by  utilizing  lead 
farmers with a farmer field school (FFS) approach (60 FFS, or approximately one for every 2-3 
villages in the project area). Establishment of public owned and managed demonstration centres 
is recommended. In total it is expected that 21,600 farmers will be trained (10% women). In terms 
of  training  events  there  are  expected  to  be  held  at  least  every  month  (or  every  two  weeks 
depending on the season). 
Demonstrations  will  cover  both  agronomic  practices  (e.g.,  optimal  use  of  fertilizers  and 
38. 
pesticides  and  conservation  agriculture)  and  improved  OFWM 34 (e.g.,  HEIS  and  the  use  of 
groundwater),  although  separate  trainings  on  OFWM  will  also  be  undertaken  with  WUAs.  The 
FFS will also be used to demonstrate the use of agricultural machinery, which will be purchased

An awareness raising campaign will also be initiated including the production of training 
materials  and  the  organization  of  events.  Farmers  will  be  made  aware  of  what  crops  are  best 
suited to the area, building on the agro-ecological zoning carried out by FAO in 2019.35 These 
include  gram,  wheat,  millet,  quinoa,  garlic  and  radish  in  particular.  Others  include  sunflowers, 
sorghum,  peas,  carrots,  and  turmeric.  The  south  of  the  scheme  area  is  particularly  suited  to 
sesame, sudan grass, cotton, maize, mott grass, turnip, tomato and okra.  
40.  While these crops may grow best, farmers will be made aware that to increase their net 
income, a move to more profitable crops suitable to the area is recommended, as well as less 
water-consuming  crops.  For  example,  according  to  FAO,  for  the  GTC  area,  net  returns  on 
sunflower are Rs 9,000 / ha, cotton Rs 9,000-12,000 / ha, gram Rs 22,000-32,000 / ha, wheat 
approx. Rs 30,000 / ha, carrots and tomato Rs 140,000 / ha and garlic over Rs 600,000 / ha. To 
incentivize the take-up of high-yielding seeds, 687,600kg of high-quality seed varieties (maybe 
wheat,  gram  and  cotton)  will  be  provided  to  farmers  on  a  50:50  cost-sharing  basis  to  plant 
approximately 5,000 ha. 
41. 
Training  will  also  be  provided  for  staff  of  PAD,  in  particular  the  OFWM  department.  83 
training events will be organized on topics such as social mobilization, farm layout planning, the 
design of water storage ponds, the judicious use of groundwater, etc.  
42. 
Construction  of  PAD  site/office/training  buildings.  Six  office  buildings  (including  a 
training center) will be constructed for the OFWM department. Two buildings will be constructed 
for the agricultural extension department. One building (including a storage shed for agricultural 
machinery  for  demonstrations)  will  be  constructed  for  the  agricultural  engineering  department, 
most likely in Mankera. 
43. 
Farmer  consultations  will  be  necessary  throughout  the  life  of  the  project’s  planned 
program for agricultural development and CAD, in order to obtain feedback on what works and 
what  can  be  improved.  This  will  be  the  role  of  PAD  staff.  Mid-term  and  final  surveys  will  be 
undertaken  by  PAD  on  the  number  of  farmers  using  improved  on-farm  water  management 
technologies and practices (and the area covered).

other institutional capacity strengthening, maybe including support for start-up of 
the implementation of the new Water Act that may become required depending on 
findings  of  the  ongoing  ADB’s  capacity  development  technical  assistance 
(TA9255-PAK).36 
45. 
Ground water monitoring and modelling. Depths to ground water tables and ground 
water  quality  will  be  measured  and  monitored.  Groundwater  data  is  required  to  help  regulate 
farmers’ use of tubewells in case of over-abstraction, to identify where additional tubewells can 
be installed, and to help identify areas where groundwater is increasing as a result of seepage 
from unlined canals, which could cause water logging. The equipment installation is designed to 
supplement existing monitoring systems of the Irrigation Research Institute (IRI) under  the PID 
for other irrigation schemes in Punjab, with piloting for more advanced technologies. The IRI has 
installed  groundwater  monitoring  equipment,  i.e.,  piezometers,  in  command  areas  of  existing 
irrigation schemes and has been acquiring data. The GTC area has been out of the IRI’s existing 
monitoring network. The proposed project will install piezometers for the entire GTC scheme with 
6 km x 6 km density in the Main Canal, Mankera, and Choubara branch areas, and with lower 
density in the Nurpur and other remaining branch areas. Automated monitoring equipment will be 
installed at 5 locations as piloting.  
46. 
The piezometers will be installed in the first year of the project implementation period, for 
the earliest start of data acquisition that will be used for future canal lining discussions (para. 11). 
The  monitoring  system  will  cover  the  entire  GTC  area,  including  Nurbur  and  other  remaining 
branch  areas,  to  acquire  data  for  a  future  comprehensive  ground  water  assessment.  Project 
activities will also include support to the IRI for groundwater modelling and analyses.  
47. 
Piloting for groundwater recharge. Details will be determined during the ADB capacity 
development  technical  assistance  (TA9255-PAK)  (footnote  54).  The  pilot  will  likely  be  to  see 
whether during the wet (kharif) season excess water supply can be used to recharge the aquifer 
in areas where the groundwater is low, so it can then be abstracted by tubewells in the dry (rabi) 
season. 
48. 
Irrigation canal flows monitoring. To improve the PID’s ability to manage water flows 
within the irrigation system in an equitable and efficient manner measurement equipment will be 
installed  for  monitoring  flow  discharges  in  irrigation  canals.  The  flow  monitoring  equipment 
installation is designed to supplement existing monitoring systems of the IRI under the PID for 
other irrigation schemes, with piloting for more advanced technologies. Two or three automated 
monitoring  systems  will  be  installed  as  piloting,  in  addition  to  conventional  manual  monitoring 
meters.  
49. 
GIS-based  asset  management  system  will  also  be  developed  under  the  project  for 
enhancing the O&M capacity of the PID. The asset management system will be further expanded 
by the PID as an O&M decision making system. Separate systems have been established by local 
consultants  funded  by  the  PID,  but  these  are  not  linked  to  each  other.  An  improved  asset 
management system will be designed to convert existing excel inventory tables to georeferenced 
GIS-based database, to allow regular updates of information of asset conditions from field offices, 
and  to  become  the  basis  for  future  asset  management  decision-making  system  development. 
Assets, their locations and conditions are to be recorded.

GIS-based  project  monitoring  and  evaluation  system  (project  performance 
50. 
monitoring system [PPMS)). Performance monitoring will be undertaken by the PID to assess 
the impact of the scheme on land use (i.e., changes to crop production through a conversion to 
irrigated  agriculture).  Data  will  be  stored  in  a  PPMS  which  will  have  three  components  (to  be 
further verified in the first year of the project): 
• 
• 
• 
The  GTC  PPMS  Database:  an  integrated  information  system  which  includes 
spatial  data  (irrigation  assets,  satellite  remote  sensing,  digital  elevation  model 
(DEM) etc.), survey statistics and other statistical information. The data is stored 
locally on the computer system (or server) and partially stored in cloud. 
The  land  use  change  analysis  for  project  progress  assessment:  an  appraisal  of 
changes in land use in the GTC project area in order to document the impact of 
investments  in  command  area  development.  Outcomes  of  this  analysis  may 
include  land  use  change  maps  and  the  creation  of  statistics  by  district  or 
Branch/Distributary canals. The baseline is 2008 before the Main Canal (MC) and 
the Mankera Branch Canal (MBC) and the Choubara Branch Canal (CBC) were 
constructed. The analysis will be based on satellite data. 
Seasonal irrigation crop monitoring: This is likely to be yearly assessment of crop 
conditions using satellite data, maybe for the kharif (wet) seasons. The analysis 
will include computation of difference in (a) the same period in the previous year; 
(b) a wet and dry year, and (c) a long-term average. 
51. 
The PPMS data can be used for  agricultural assessments of the project’s impacts,  like 
cropping  intensities  and  yields  at  the  end  of  the  project.  This  will  supplement  annual  PAD 
agricultural survey data. The system is to be designed to use an open source software and freely 
available remote sensing data. The TRTA for the project preparation developed a system design 
proposal. The system design will be further examined during the project implementation.   
Training  for  PID  staff.  This  will  include  long-term  (Masters  courses)  and  short-term 
52. 
training and other capacity development activities.   
53. 
Piloting for groundwater recharge. Details will be determined following start-up of the 
ADB capacity development technical assistance (CDTA) (TA9255-PAK, footnote 54). The pilot 
will likely be to use the monsoon (kharif)season surplus water in areas where the groundwater is 
low, so it can then be abstracted by tubewells in the dry (rabi) season. 
Other  PID  institutional  capacity  strengthening.  It  may  include  institutional  capacity 
54. 
development for asset management and other capacity to ensure the project’s sustainability, and 
also for efficient water management. Requirements will be examined under the ongoing capacity 
development TA9255-PAK (footnote 36).

Event 
Project to irrigate the Thal Doab was conceived by the Government of United India. 
Project alternatives to irrigate the Thal Doab were designed and prepared, but these 
were repeatedly turned down or deferred by the Government of India due to funding 
constraints and issues of water availability. 
Late 1940s 
The Thal Canal system was constructed to irrigate the western part of the Thal Doab 
along the Kundian-Khushab and Kundian-Shershah railway lines. 
1970 
The Chashma Barrage and Chashma-Jhelum (C-J) Link Canal construction was 
completed, including a head regulator of 15,000 cusecs capacity at Adhikot, at RD 
180+222 of the C-J Link, to serve as the eventual offtake for irrigating the remaining 
area of the Thal Doab (i.e., the GTCIP). 
1972 and 1980  Project proposals to undertake the GTCIP from the head regulator on the C-J Link were 
twice developed and submitted by the Punjab Irrigation and Power Department (I&PD), 
but were both turned down by the Government of Pakistan due to funding constraints 
and issues of water availability between the provinces.

The Pakistan Water Apportionment Accord is agreed, including an allocation for the 
GTCIP and settling its longstanding issue of water availability between the provinces. 
A detailed feasibility study for the GTCIP was conducted, and PC-1 was prepared by 
I&PD (NESPAK-NDC joint venture was a consultant), but no further progress is 
achieved due to funding constraints. 
The Pakistan Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) released its Water 
Vision 2025 Plan. The GTCIP was one of three identified priority irrigation projects for its 
first phase. 
Anticipatory PC-1 for the GTCIP was approved for Rs 50 million and the project was 
inaugurated.  
The main PC-1 for the GTCIP was prepared and approved for Rs 30.467 billion. 
The Project Planning Report including environmental impact assessment and 
resettlement action plan, detailed engineering designs, and tender documents/drawings 
were prepared by WAPDA (a NESPAK-led joint venture was a consultant). 
Construction of the Phase I of the GTCIP, comprising the main canal, distributary off-
takes from the main canal, and the Mankera Branch canal and its distributaries and 
minors – contract packages GTC-01, 02, 03, 03a, 04, and 05. 
Original PC-1 for the project expired and a revised PC-1 was prepared by WAPDA 
(NESPAK was a consultant), with a revised project cost of Rs 43.126 billion. 
The Federal Government defers the revised PC-1 and stops funding the GTCIP for its 
proposed second and third phase, due to funding constraints. 
Construction of Phase 1 is completed and handed over to the Punjab Irrigation 
Department (PID) for canal operation and maintenance, and to the Punjab Agriculture 
Department (PAD) for command area and on-farm development. 
PID prepared a new PC-1 for construction of the Choubara Branch canal and its 
distributaries and minors (contract package GTC-06), which is approved for Rs 6.262 
billion of Government’s own finance. 
PID engaged a consultant team for detailed design updating, bidding document 
preparation and construction supervision for the Choubara branch canal system. 
The Punjab Government decided to shift the Choubara branch system construction from 
its own financing to ADB-financing.

APPENDIX 2: COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION IN PROCUREMENT (CPP) 
Greater Thal Canal Irrigation Project 
1. 
Introduction:  This  component  directly  addresses  the  needs  of  the  communities  in 
developing  tertiary  level  irrigation  network.37 Experience  has  shown  that  active  and  dedicated 
participation  of  the  key  stakeholders  in  the  design  and  implementation  of  projects,  especially 
those  at  the  grass-roots  level,  contribute  significantly  to  the  sustainability  of  developmental 
activities,  through  increased  ownership  and  more  effective  use  of  grassroots  level  inputs.  The 
additional  benefits  are:  (i)  more  appropriate  intervention;  (ii)  better  implementation  and 
sustainability;  (iii)  better  utilization  and  increased  ownership;  (iv)  greater  efficiency  and  better 
planning; (v) greater transparency and accountability; and, more importantly, (vi) increased equity 
and  empowerment through  greater  involvement of  the  poor,  women,  and other  disadvantaged 
groups.  
Selection criterion: The following is considered for the selection of works for community 
2. 
participation: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
Water Users Associations (WUAs) will be established at each canal outlet and will 
be registered under the “On Farm Water Management & Water Users Association 
Ordinance [Act]-1981 (Amended 2001)”;  
the estimated cost of each subproject should be less than $200,000; 
due  consideration  should  be  given  to  locating,  designing,  implementing,  and 
operating  the  subproject  in  order  to  minimize  any  adverse  impacts  on  the 
environment; 
no resettlement should be necessary. However, if absolutely necessary, suitable 
safeguards in accordance with ADB’s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) should 
be applied;  
(vi) 
(v)  WUAs will enter a participation agreement with OFWM as attached (Attachment 1) 
and will agree that all sub-projects will be designed and supervised by PIO through 
Command Area Development Consultants (CADC) assistance and in consultation 
with WUA;  
entire watercourse development will be carried out and watercourse will be lined 
as  per  approved  permissible  limit  including  critical  reaches  for  efficient  water 
conveyance to the farmer fields; 
community  will  preferably  engage  local  labor  and  should  indicate  willingness  to 
participate with counterpart funds and in kind, such as labor and should provide 
undertaking for recurrent operation and maintenance (O&M) works. 
(vii) 
3. 
Implementation Arrangements: The Punjab Agriculture Department is the implementing 
agency and will implement the command area development through the Project Implementation 
Office (PIO). The WUA will be the institution for watercourse development and each watercourse 
in the Greater Thal Canal command will serve about 400-500 acres (average) by over 50 farmers. 
The key responsibilities of the WUA are (i) provision of right-of-way (RoW) for earthen construction 
of  watercourse;  (ii)  arrangement  of  counterpart  funds  and  share  of  skilled  and  unskilled  labor 
required for works; (iii) procurement of construction materials and labor for carrying out civil works; 
(iv) resolution of disputes amongst the water users typically in respect of channel alignment and 
fixation of water control structures; (v) carrying out civil works in accordance with standards and 
37   This  includes  primarily  development  of  earthen  channel,  installation  of  water  control  structures,  lining  of  critical 
reaches, construction of culverts, animal wallow, drop structures, earth filling and associated works. 
78        Appendix 2 
specifications under the supervision of PIO and CADC; and (vi) agree to undertake routine O&M 
of improved watercourses. 
4. 
The  PIO  will  coordinate  with  the  Punjab  Irrigation  Department  which  is  the  executing 
agency through the Project Management Office-Barrages (PMO-Barrages) in the development of 
engineering and revenue chakbandi as well as Warabandis.38 This information will deliver the final 
map  of  each  watercourse  command,  channel  layout  and  delineation,  farm  turnouts,  land 
ownership data and lists of water users. These activities will benefit from the development of CAD 
models utilizing topographic data including Digital Elevation Models (DEM) (purchased under the 
TRTA). These will help to demarcate the watercourse command area and ROW based on digital 
topographic data, including the delineation of areas which are suitable for high efficiency irrigation 
systems  (HEIS)  without  the  need  for  major  land  development.  The  PIO  will  (i)  ensure  social 
mobilization  of  the  water  users  for  their  active  participation  at  all  stages  of  works  including 
organization  and  registration  of  shareholders  into  1,253  WUAs;39 (ii)  design  and  provide  cost 
estimation for system; (iii) collect farmers’ share as their contribution in sub-projects; (iv) allocate 
and release funds to WUA as per stage-wise completion; (v) provide regular progress reports; (vi) 
prepare  statements  of  expenditures,  maintain  proper  accounts,  and  conduct  audits;  and  (vii) 
construction supervision and monitoring through CADC assistance.   
5. 
Procurement: The WUAs will be responsible for procurement at the watercourse level. 
The WUAs will purchase the construction materials such as cement, pre-cast concrete parabolic 
segments (PCPS)/RCC pipes, bricks and sand through Request for Quotation (RFQ) procedures 
by inviting at least three quotations preferably from local suppliers. In case of PCPS lining, the 
PCPS will be procured through RFQ from PAD’s already approved and prequalified firms only.40 
The PAD with the help of the CAD implementation consultant team will provide close guidance to 
WUAs to ensure required technical specifications will be clearly indicated in the RFQ form. The 
labor component of the subprojects can be extended by the members of the community, provided 
adequate  expertise  exists,  who  should  be  reimbursed  adequately  for  the  services  rendered.  It 
should  be  ensured  that  children  will  not  be  employed  for  the  works.  In  case  the  WUA  cannot 
identify adequate skilled labor within the community, the work can be let out by inviting quotations 
from three local contractors. Here also, to the extent possible, members of the local community 
should be employed by the contractors for labor. The contract should be in the local language 
and simple, adequately addressing the main issues such as scope of work, start date, completion 
period, payment terms, progress and quality review, defects-liability period, responsibilities of the 
WUA and contractor, including review, inspection, payment procedures and contract termination.  
Project  Implementation:  The  WUA  will  be  responsible  for  the  implementation  of  the 
6. 
works while the PIO will supervise the works and certify the quantity and conformity with design 
and specifications, duly verified by CADC. The following procedure will be followed.  
38  The  engineering  Chakbandi  of  a  canal  system  involves  division  of  its  command  area  into  various  segments  and 
attachment of each segment to a particular outlet at the parent channel (distributary/minor) on the basis of topography 
for  delivering  irrigation  water.  The  revenue  Chakbandi  of  an  outlet  involves  on-site  verification  of  the  proposed 
command  area,  physical  demarcation  of  the  boundaries,  mapping  of  land  ownership,  and  preparation  of  lists  of 
shareholders/water users. 
39  Social mobilization may include intensive publicity campaign to reach out to the target communities through direct 
mail,  press  releases,  signage,  media  advertising,  workshops  and  meetings.  The  IA  district  and  tehsil  offices  will 
extend their services especially in areas from which response is low and provide training and other assistance to 
such people to support capacity-building. The IA may engage social mobilizers in CADC to undertake, among other 
activities, mobilization of community groups, skills training and establishment of participatory planning processes at 
the village or community level. 
40  The  Precast  Concrete  Parabolic  Segment  (PCPS)  lining  has  been  approved  as  alternate  lining  technique  being 
hydraulically more efficient, durable and quick in installation than rectangular shaped brick lined channel.

ii.  Second  Installment:  Release  of  remaining  50  percent  cost  of  earthen 
development/  construction  and  30  percent  of  the  estimated  material  cost  on 
receipt  of  second  intermediate  completion  report  from  CADC  certifying  that  (a) 
remaining  50  percent  labor  charges  of  farmers’  share  on  account  of  lining, 
installation of water control structures and associated works deposited; (b) entire 
designed earthen sections developed; and (c) at least 30 percent planned lining

Codes of respective DDA OFWM with the authorization of the Finance Department; 
l.  The  funds  from  Cost  Centers/DDO  Codes  will  be  released  by  the  Deputy  Director 
Agriculture OFWM/competent authority into the joint accounts of respective WUAs in 
three installments on recommendations of CAD Consultants as per above said criteria; 
m.  Audit will be carried out through PIO internal audit and externally-appointed auditor. 
This audit report should form a part of the overall audit of the Project and should be 
submitted to ADB in accordance with loan covenants. 
7. 
Risk mitigation: The community participation may encounter risks such as (i) being time 
and resource intensive; (ii) logistically difficult; (iii) conflicts among stakeholders; (iv) consultative 
groups  not  duly  represented;  (v)  higher  expectations;  (vi)  domination  by  powerful  and  more 
educated  elite;  and  (vii)  lack  of  adequate  capacity.  The  PIO  will  address  the  risks  through 
awareness  creation,  capacity  building  and  engaging  CADC  early  during 
the  project 
implementation. Majority of farmers are absentees because there are no significant agricultural 
activities  in  the  area  at  present.  The  watercourse  development  may  face  absence  of  owners, 
shortage of labor, and poor financial condition of the farming community. It is, therefore, planned 
that cost for earthen construction of watercourses will be borne by the project. This will provide 
initial contribution to the project and jumpstart the activities.  
41  On completion, the WUA, PIO and CADC will jointly visit the completed works for inspection. If the inspection team 
concludes that works have been implemented satisfactorily, a completion certificate will be issued by the PIO.  
Appendix 2         81 
Land donation: The land is provided by the farmer beneficiaries and local communities 
8. 
for farm level field channels (watercourses) as counterpart support including other assets such 
as trees and labor, therefore, involuntary resettlement is not involved. As a safeguard measure, 
PAD and PIO shall undertake the following:  
a.  Early screening of the watercourse development will be undertaken to fully determine 
the impacts, including the land requirements. Consultations with local communities will 
be undertaken throughout the screening, planning and implementation phases of each 
project.  Consultations  will  be  recorded  in  detail  and  will  include  all  discussions  in 
relation to the donation of land, if applicable; 
b.  Where  land  donation  is  required,  written  agreements  between  the  parties  will  be 
obtained; 
c.  Donated lands for the watercourse will be legally transferred to the WUA;  
d.  Only watercourse alignment where there is written confirmation of agreement among 
all concerned landowners/farmers will be included under the Project; and  
e.  A grievance redressal mechanism will be put in place under the PAD and PIO, with 
representation from the farmer beneficiaries, and local government. A grievance log 
will be established prior to project implementation and will be available for inspection 
and reporting by project monitors.

A.  
BACKGROUND 
1. 
The Greater Thal Canal Project area lies in the eastern part of Thal Doab bounded by the 
River Indus on the west and rivers Jhelum and Chenab on the east. On the west, the proposed 
project area abuts with the existing Thal Canal command boundary and falls within the boundaries 
of Bhakkar, Layyah, Khushab and Jhang districts. The eastern part of the Doab, which was left 
out from the original Thal Canal project, constitutes the Greater Thal Canal area. This area, a vast 
desert spread over about 1.976 million acres, has been lying barren for centuries except for some 
rainfed  agriculture,  mostly  during  Rabi.  It  has  now  to  be  considered  for  development  through 
irrigated agriculture. 
2. 
Under  the  inter-Provincial  Water  Accord,  Kharif  allocation  of  1.873  MAF  has  been 
approved for Greater Thal Canal Project in addition to which additional flood supplies may also 
be  available  during  monsoon  period.  The  studies  have  been  carried  out  for  non-perennial 
irrigation with water accord allocation and additional flood supplies. However, if in some year(s), 
additional  flood  supplies  are  not  available,  then  shortages  will  be  managed  through  rotational 
program system and reliance will be placed on stress irrigation techniques. 
3. 
The irrigation network of Greater Thal Canal Project consists of four command systems of 
Branch canals namely, Mankera, Choubara, Dhingana and Nurpur and one command system of 
Mehmood sub branch of Dhingana branch with total 65 distributaries and 29 minors. Phase - I of 
the  project,  involving  construction  of  Main  Canal  and  Mankera  Branch,  was  implemented  by 
WAPDA. Now the Government of Punjab is entrusted the job to implement remaining parts of the 
Project: 
Phase-I (Completed in 2008 by WAPDA) 
•  Construction of Main Canal, its 8 Nos. Direct Distributaries with Minors. 
•  Construction of Mankera Branch and Distribution System. 
Phase-II (under taken now) 
•  Construction of Choubara Branch Canal and Distribution System. 
Phase-III (Future) 
•  Construction of Dhingana Branch Canal and Distribution System. 
•  Construction  of  Mehmood  Sub  Branch  of  Dhingana  Branch  Canal  and  Distribution 
System. 
•  Construction of Noorpur Branch Canal and Distribution System. 
4. 
Phase-I  was  completed  in  2008  at  a  cost  of  Rs.  10.17  Billion  by  WAPDA,  through  five 
contract packages. Remaining contracts were not implemented by WAPDA. Phase-II is now to 
be implemented by the Punjab government with the financial assistance from Asian Development 
Bank (ADB). 
5. 
In 2015, Government of the Punjab decided to construct Phase II comprising Choubara 
Branch  Canal  System  under  Annual  Development  Programme  (ADP)  2015-2016.  For  this 
purpose, PC-I was prepared and approved on March 02, 2016 amounting Rs. 6,261.701 Million. 
GTC Consultants (JV of ACE and EGC in association with Berkeley Associates) were hired who 
Appendix 3 
101 
have already completed the updated detailed design and Bidding Documents of the Choubara 
Branch  Canal  System.  In  May  2019,  Government  of  the  Punjab  decided  to  seek  financial 
assistance from Asian Development Bank (ADB) for implementation of Choubara Branch Canal 
Construction Project. Accordingly, a new team of consultants will be engaged for structural design 
adjustments during implementation, contract management, social and environmental safeguard 
during  implementation  and  monitoring,  project  implementation management  support  and  other 
services to meet the requirements for an ADB - financed project.

The ADB and Government of Punjab have agreed to the following principles with regard 
to resettlement under the project (i) the approach to resettlement under the project should not be 
to  remove  all  persons  who  have  encroached  on  the  right  of  way(s),  but  to  move  only  those 
persons who will be directly affected; (ii) design will be drafted with the objective of minimizing 
resettlement activities; and (iii) contract packages and execution of civil works will be directed in 
such a way to minimize resettlement activities. Based on above classification, the ADB installed 
TRTA  Consultants  have  developed  a  Resettlement  Framework  and  Land  Acquisition  and 
Resettlement Plan (LARP) for the project that was likely to encounter the resettlement impacts. 
The  Consultants  would  assist  the  PMO  Barrages  in  updating  the  Land  Acquisition  and 
Resettlement  Plan  (LARP)  and  Resettlement  Action  Plan  (RAP)  prepared  by  the  TRTA 
Consultants that would be provided to CSC for implementation. The Plan may also be intended

implementation  of  Choubara  Branch  Canal  Construction  Project-  Greater  Thal  Canal 
(Phase-II). 
130        Appendix 3 
The  estimated  duration  of  consulting  services  is  fifty-two  (52)  months.  The  Choubara 
53. 
Branch ICB contract will be implemented over a period of forty-eight (48) months including twelve 
(12) months of Defects Notification Period (DNP). In order to complete the start-up project review 
activities well in time, the consultants will be installed about one (01) month ahead of mobilization 
of the work contractor and will continue for about three (03) months after the DNP for smooth 
project close-up and issuance of the Performance Certificate and Final Payment Certificate. The 
Consultants should note that work contract for the Project is likely to be awarded shortly after 
mobilization  of  the  Construction  Supervision  Consultants.  Therefore,  the  Consultants  are 
required to mobilize and complete start up Contract activities, drawings and specifications in such 
a manner that the scheduled start of construction is not jeopardized. Any changes required as a 
result  of  this review  will  be  brought to the  notice of  the  Client  and will  be  incorporated  in  the 
designs as necessary.

1. 
BACKGROUND  
1. 
The Greater Thal Canal (GTC) offtakes at RD 180+222 from the Chashma-Jhelum (CJ) 
link canal near Adhi Kot in district Khushab. In total, the GTC project consists of a Main Canal 
(MC)  and  five  (5)  branch  canals  (Mankera,  Choubara,  Dhingana,  Nurpur  and  Mehmood               
sub-Branch). The GTC system comprises of irrigation network extending over 35 km main canal 
(lined), 342 kms branch canals (lined), over 1,835 kms distributaries and minors alongwith allied 
structures (regulators, falls, bridges etc.). The GTC has a gross command area (GCA) of 1.918 
million  acres  and  canal  command  area  (CCA)  of  1.738  million  acres  in  Thal  Doab  (the  area 
between the Indus and the Jhelum rivers) encompassing Bhakkar (39%), Layyah (30%), Khushab 
(17%) and Jhang (14%) districts. The canal is a non-perennial channel and designed to deliver a 
total  2.497  MAF  of  water  annually  with  8,500  cusecs  discharge  with  water  allowance  of  3.88 
cusec/1000 acres.  
2. 
The Main  Canal  (MC)  of  the  GTC  network  has  been designed to  supply water through 
cross regulators and head regulators to the Mankera Branch Canal (MBC) with a design flow rate 
of about 34,384 litres per second (lps) (34.38 m3/sec). The MBC further supplies irrigation water 
through 8 distributaries and 9 minors to about 544 outlets/ watercourses. The commanded area 
of MBC is estimated as 257,132 acres (104,060 ha) with a current flow rate of 28,222 lps (28.22 
m3/sec).  The  average  commanded  area  of  the  MBC  is  485  acres  (197.8  ha)  per  outlet/ 
watercourse.  The  construction  of  MC  and  MBC  alongwith  its  distributaries  and  minors  were 
completed by the WAPDA in 2008, and later handed over to the Punjab Irrigation Department for 
its Operation & Maintenance (O&M) while the remaining network of branch canals, distributaries 
and minors are planned to be constructed. The combined water allowance of the MC and MBC 
has been estimated as 270 lps (0.27 m3/sec) / 1000 ha. The Choubara Branch Canal (CBC) with 
a design flow rate of 41,035 lps (41.04 m3/sec) is planned to be constructed under the proposed 
project alongwith its command area development.  
3. 
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has agreed to finance the construction of remaining 
systems  of  the  GTC  and  their  Command  Area  Development  (CAD).  The  proposed  project  will 
support the CAD activities in already constructed MC and MBC as well as newly planned CBC 
covering about 649,000 acres (263,000 ha) traversing Khushab District (Nurpur Tehsil), Bhakkar 
District (Mankera Tehsil), and Layyah District (Choubara Tehsil).  
2. 
PROJECT OBJECTIVES  
The  Project  Development  Objective  (PDO)  of  the  CAD-GTC  is  to  develop  irrigated
