Project Administration Manual Purpose and Process 
1.  The  project  administration  manual  (PAM)  describes  the  essential  administrative  and 
management requirements to implement the project on time, within budget, and in accordance 
with the policies and procedures of the government and Asian Development Bank (ADB). The 
PAM should include references to all available templates and instructions either through linkages 
to relevant URLs or directly incorporated in the PAM. 
2.  The  executing  and  implementing  agencies  are  wholly  responsible  for  the  implementation  of 
ADB-financed  projects, as  agreed jointly between  the  borrower  and  ADB,  and in accordance 
with  the  policies  and  procedures  of  the  government  and  ADB.  ADB  staff  is  responsible  for 
supporting implementation including compliance by the executing and implementing agencies 
of  their  obligations  and  responsibilities  for  project  implementation  in  accordance  with  ADB’s 
policies and procedures. 
3.  At loan negotiations, the borrower, and ADB shall agree to the PAM and ensure consistency 
with  the  loan  agreement.  Such  agreement  shall  be  reflected  in  the  minutes  of  the  loan 
negotiations. In the event of any discrepancy or contradiction between the PAM and the  loan 
agreement, the provisions of the loan agreement shall prevail. 
4.  After  ADB  Board  approval  of  the  project's  report  and  recommendations  of  the  President, 
changes in implementation arrangements are subject to agreement and approval pursuant to 
relevant government and ADB administrative procedures (including the Project Administration 
Instructions) and upon such approval, they will be subsequently incorporated in the PAM.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
The  proposed  Guangxi  Regional  Cooperation  and  Integration  Promotion  Investment 
Program will assist the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region (GZAR) of the People’s Republic of 
China (PRC) implement its strategies and action plans for regional cooperation and integration 
with countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), with a focus on developing 
the North–South Economic Corridor under the Greater Mekong Subregion Cooperation Program 
(GMS).  The  administrative  areas  covered  by  tranche  3  of  the  Investment  Program  include:  (i) 
Baise Municipality, (ii) Chongzuo Municipality, and (iii) Fangchengggang Municipality. 
Impacts and Outcome. The impacts of tranche 3 of the Investment Program will be (i) 
economic growth potential of border areas in the PRC and Viet Nam realized; (ii) efficient transport 
and  trade  operations  along  GMS  North–South  Economic  Corridor  achieved;  and  (iii)  economic 
integration between GZAR and rest of the GMS further strengthened. The outcome will be benefits 
of regional cooperation and integration in border areas of Guangxi and northern Viet Nam captured. 
Outputs (Tranche 3): The third tranche of the multitranche financing facility (MFF) will 
cover major investments in cross-border e-commerce and border economic zones (BEZ). In line 
with the framework financing agreement, those investments strongly support GZAR’s Strategy and 
Action  Plan  for  participation  in  GMS  Program,  aiming  to  deepen  economic  cooperation  and 
integration with ASEAN member countries.1 The six subprojects to be financed by tranche 3 are: 
(i) 
(ii) 
Output 1: Support for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in border 
areas expanded. The two subprojects are the a) Baise University Sino–Viet Nam 
Cross-border  Training  Center  project  and  b)  Baise  Cross-border  Agricultural 
Products  Industry  Chain  Upgrading  Project.  The  first  subproject  involves 
expansion of Baise University to increase its training capacity in skills sought by 
local employers such as international trade, e-commerce, tourism, food security, 
agriculture,  and  language,  and  translation,  and  includes  an  Art,  and  Culture 
Exhibition  Hall,  Culture  Exchange  Performance  Center,  and  PRC–Viet  Nam 
Training  Center,  including  training  laboratories  for  e-commerce  data  operation, 
and surrounding landscaping. The second subproject includes the construction of 
a facility with fruit sorting and packaging lines, fruit processing lines, and a fruit, 
and  vegetable  trading  area,  having  the  initial  aim  of  value  addition  for  key 
agricultural products produced by local SMEs and their onward distribution by rail 
transport, but also having potential for handling agricultural imports from ASEAN 
countries. 
Output  2:  Integrated  logistics  facilities  and  cross-border  e-commerce 
platforms  for  the  PRC  and  Viet  Nam  developed.  The  Chongzuo  Cold  Chain 
Logistics  Demonstration  subproject  will  construct  logistics  facilities  comprising  a 
bonded  warehouse  adjacent  to  the  newly  constructed  river  port  serving  the 
economic zone, and a cold storage facility located close to rail and expressway 
junctions  on  the  principal  Pinxiang–Chongzuo–Nanning  transport  corridor.  The 
digital  platform  will  be  developed  to  provide  warehouse  management,  payment 
settlement,  and  cross-border  electronic  transaction  service.  These  facilities  will 
serve  companies  in the economic zone.  The  cold storage  facility  will  also serve 
logistics providers transporting imported products brought overland from ASEAN 
countries, as well as products imported from the nearby seaports.

(iii) 
(iv) 
Output 3: Key infrastructure and trade-related services in border economic 
zones provided. The two subprojects are: a) Phase II of subproject 1 of tranche 
2 (Chongzuo Sino–Viet Nam Border Economic Zone Demonstration Project) which 
involves the construction of 12.39 kilometers (km)—six new roads, 46 km of water 
supply pipes, and an expansion of the current capacity of its fresh water treatment 
plant by 15,000 cubic meter per day; b) Fangchenggang Sino–ASEAN Trade and 
Culture  Exchange  Center  involving  the  construction  of  processing  factory 
workshops  for  frozen  imported  aquaculture  products,  logistics  facilities,  and  an 
exhibition center. 
Output 4: Cross-border tourism facilities and policy coordination improved. 
Chongzuo  Daxin  Sino–Viet  Nam  Cross-border  Tourism  subproject  will  enhance 
GMS tourism sector cooperation through upgrading of two roads totaling 16.28 km 
in length, and construction of a visitor center to accommodate steadily rising visitor 
numbers to the Detian waterfall which lies on the PRC–Viet Nam border and is the 
site of a planned bilateral cross-border tourism cooperation zone.

Project management offices (PMOs) have been set up for each IA, which also manages 
subprojects under tranche 1. A project management unit (PMU) will  also be established under 
each PIE. 
The  PIEs  and  their  PMUs  will  be  responsible  for  day-to-day  implementation  of  their 
respective  subprojects  under  guidance  by  their  IA,  and  supervised  by  the  EA.  Each  IA  will 
designate  staff,  including  procurement,  and  financial  management  staff,  to  its  PMO  to  ensure 
appropriate and efficient project implementation. Each PIE will also designate qualified staff to 
carry out their responsibilities and ensure compliance with relevant ADB guidelines and rules, and 
safeguards requirements. 
Project Management Consultant. To support the implementation of the subprojects, a 
project management and capacity development consultant (PMC) will be engaged by the EA as 
project  consultant  under  ADB  loan.  Their  outline  terms  of  references  are  described  in  the 
summary of tranche 3 subprojects. A procurement agent (firm) will be hired by the EA by its own 
financing  and  will  be  responsible  for  implementation  of  procurement  of  all  ADB-financed 
procurement packages including consulting services, goods, and works. The procurement agent 
will implement each step of the procurement process (preparation of draft bidding documents, bid

COSTS AND FINANCING 
The Government of the PRC has requested a MFF in an amount up to $450.0 million from 
ADB’s ordinary capital resources, including the PRC country allocation and regional set-aside, to 
help finance a part of the investment program. The MFF consists of three tranches, subject to the 
government’s submission of related periodic financing requests, execution of the related loan and 
project agreements for each tranche, and fulfillment of terms, and conditions, and undertakings 
set forth in the framework financing agreement. The first tranche amounting to $130 million (Loan 
3501 and Loan 3508) was approved on 12 December 2016 and loan effectiveness was declared 
on 28 July 2017. The second tranche (Loan 3652) amounting to $180 million was approved on 4 
April 2018 and declared effective on 14 November 2018. The third tranche is estimated to cost 
$140.0 million with a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, interest, and other charges 
during construction will not be capitalized. It will have (i) a straight-line repayment method, (ii) an 
annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB’s London interbank offered rate-based 
lending  facility,  (iii)  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%  per  year,  and  (iv)  such  other  terms  and

The  government  will  make  the  proceeds  of  each  tranche  available  for  purposes  of 
financing projects under the MFF. It is expected that the government will finance the remaining 
cost of about $186.7 million equivalent (for tranche 3), or 57.1% of the total cost, including taxes, 
duties, and other miscellaneous costs.

Financial Management Assessment 
V. 
FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT 
The  financial  management  assessment  (FMA)  was  conducted  in  October  2020  in 
accordance with ADB’s Guidelines for the Financial Management and Analysis of Projects and 
the  Financial  Due  Diligence:  A  Methodology  Note.  The  FMA  considered  the  capacity  of  the 
Guangxi  Zhuang  Autonomous  Region  government  as  the  EA,  the  four  IAs  and  the  six  PIEs, 
including funds flow arrangements, staffing, accounting, and financial reporting systems, financial 
information systems, and internal, and external auditing arrangements. Based on the assessment, 
the  key  financial  management  risks  identified  are  (i)  the  IAs  are  not  compliant  with  national 
accounting  framework  which  brought  PRC’s  updated  accounting  and  financial  reporting  into 
substantial compliance with International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS); (ii) the PIEs lack 
of  familiarity  with  ADB  financial  management  requirements,  particularly  relating  to  accounting, 
reporting, and auditing, which may delay project reporting and the identification of issues on the 
use  of  loan  proceeds;  and  (iii)  weakness  in  internal  controls  in  the  verification  of  fixed  assets, 
budgeting  controls,  and  reporting.  It  is  concluded  that  the  overall  pre-mitigation  financial 
management risk of the EA and IAs is moderate. 
These risks shall be mitigated by: 
(i) 
strengthening financial management capacities, particularly for IAs, and PIEs, by 
engaging a financial management consultant, and providing needed training to IAs 
and PIEs; 
actions overseen by the GPMO to strengthen (a) the IAs’ accounting procedures 
to  align  with  national  accounting  standards,  and  (b)  project  accounting  and 
financial reporting systems and procedures of the PIEs; and 
external audit of PIEs shall include the audit on ADB loan project accounts; and 
the GPMO and Guangxi Provincial Finance Bureau will closely monitor and guide 
PIEs  in  project  implementation,  especially  in  the  early  stages  of  project 
implementation.

B. 
Disbursement 
1. 
Disbursement Arrangements for ADB Funds 
The  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  Loan  Disbursement 
Handbook  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time) 3,  and  detailed  arrangements  agreed  upon 
between the government and ADB. Online training for project staff on disbursement policies and 
procedures is available.4 Project staff are encouraged to avail themselves of this training to help 
ensure efficient disbursement and fiduciary control. 
The planned funds flow for tranche 3 investment loan is shown in Figure 3 above. The 
PIEs  and  IAs  will  be  responsible  for  collecting  and  retaining  supporting  documents  at  the 
subproject level. The EA will undertake the preparation and submittal of withdrawal applications 
to ADB. 
3 The handbook is available electronically from the ADB website (http://www.adb.org/documents/loan-disbursement-
handbook)

27 
Advance fund procedure. To facilitate subproject implementation through timely release 
of loan proceeds, the EA will—through Guangxi Department of Finance (GDOF)—establish and 
maintain a separate advance account for the investment loan under tranche 3 promptly after loan 
effectiveness at a commercial bank. The currency of the advance account is in US dollar. The 
advance account is to be used exclusively for ADB’s share of eligible expenditures. GDOF who 
administers the advance account is accountable and responsible for proper use of advances to 
the advance account. 
The total outstanding advance to the advance account should not exceed the estimate of 
ADB’s share of expenditures to be paid through the advance account for the forthcoming 6 months. 
The EA, through GDOF, may request for initial, and additional advances to the advance account(s) 
based on an Estimate of Expenditure Sheet setting out the estimated expenditures to be financed 
through the account(s) for the forthcoming 6 months. Supporting documents should be submitted 
to ADB or retained by the EA in accordance with ADB’s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as 
amended from time to time) when liquidating or replenishing the advance account. 
Statement of expenditure procedures.5 The statement of expenditure (SOE) procedure 
may be used for reimbursement of eligible expenditures or liquidation of advances to the advance 
account. Supporting documents and records for the expenditures claimed under the SOE should 
be maintained and made readily available for review by ADB's disbursement and review missions, 
upon  ADB's  request  for  submission  of  supporting  documents  on  a  sampling  basis,  and  for 
independent audit. 
Before the submission of the first withdrawal application (WA), the borrower should submit 
to  ADB  sufficient  evidence  of  the  authority  of  the  person(s)  who  will  sign  the  withdrawal 
applications  on  behalf  of  the  GZAR  government,  together  with  the  authenticated  specimen 
signatures  of  each  authorized  person.  The  minimum  value  per  WA  is  stipulated  in  the  Loan 
Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time). Individual payments below such 
amount should be paid (i) by the EA and subsequently claimed to ADB through reimbursement, 
or  (ii)  through  the  advance fund  procedure,  unless  otherwise  accepted  by  ADB.  The  borrower 
should ensure sufficient category and contract balances before requesting disbursements. 
2. 
Disbursement Arrangements for Counterpart Fund 
The  EA  shall,  and  shall  cause the  IAs  and  other  entities,  in  line  with  the  cost  estimate 
prepared for the subprojects, to make available, promptly, and as needed, the necessary, and 
stipulated counterpart funding funds as well as facilities, services, land, and other resources. 
C. 
Accounting 
The GPMO will maintain and, through the IAs, cause the PIEs to maintain separate books 
and  records  by  funding  source  for  all  expenditures  incurred  for  the  subprojects.  The  basis  of 
accounting will be accrual for all PIEs. The GPMO will prepare and, through the IAs, cause the 
PIEs to prepare in-year and annual financial statements for the subprojects. 
5 SOE forms are available in Appendix 7B and 7D of ADB’s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from 
time to time). 
28 
The  accounting  and  financial  reporting  procedures  will  be  supported  through  initiatives 
already agreed between the GZAR government and ADB for tranche 1.6 This includes that the 
GZAR government within three months of the date of effectiveness of tranche 3 shall engage a 
professional accounting firm or consultants, acceptable to ADB, to assess the internal controls of 
the  project  management  offices  and  PIEs  and  to  recommend  improvements,  and  shall  take 
appropriate measures to implement such recommended improvements, if any. 
D. 
 Auditing and Public Disclosure 
The GPMO will cause the detailed consolidated project financial statements to be audited 
in accordance with International Standards on Auditing by an independent auditor acceptable to 
ADB. The audited project financial statements together with the auditor’s opinion will be presented 
in the English language to ADB within 6 months from the end of the fiscal year by the GPMO. 
For entities preparing independent entity financial statements, the audited entity financial 
statements,  together  with  the  auditor’s  report  and  management  letter,  will  be  submitted  in  the 
English language to ADB within 1 month after their approval by the relevant authority. 
The audit report for the project financial statements will include a management letter and 
auditor’s opinions, which cover (i) whether the project financial statements present an accurate 
and fair view or are presented fairly, in all material respects, in accordance with the applicable 
financial  reporting  standards;  (ii)  whether  the  proceeds  of  the  loan  were  used  only  for  the 
purpose(s) of the project; and (iii) whether the borrower or EA was in compliance with the financial 
covenants contained in the legal agreements (where applicable). 
Compliance with financial reporting and auditing requirements will be monitored by review 
missions and during normal program supervision, and followed up regularly with all concerned, 
including the external auditor. 
The  government, GPMO,  IAs,  and  PIEs  have  been  made aware of  ADB’s  approach to 
delayed submission, and the requirements for satisfactory and acceptable quality of the audited 
project  financial  statements.7 ADB  reserves  the  right  to  require  a  change  in  the  auditor  (in  a 
manner consistent with the constitution of the borrower), or for additional support to be provided 
to the auditor, if the audits required are not conducted in a manner satisfactory to ADB, or if the 
audits are substantially delayed. ADB reserves the right to verify the project's financial accounts 
to  confirm  that  the  share  of  ADB’s  financing  is  used  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  policies  and 
procedures. 
6 Para. 15 in the Schedule of the Project Agreement for Project 1 (Investment Loan Component) and para. 19 in Chapter 
V of the 2016 facility administration manual for tranche 1. 
7 ADB’s approach and procedures regarding delayed submission of audited project financial statements:  
(i)  When audited project financial statements are not received by the due date, ADB will write to the executing 
agency advising that (a) the audit documents are overdue; and (b) if they are not received within the next 6 
months, requests for new contract awards and disbursement such as new replenishment of advance accounts, 
processing of new reimbursement, and issuance of new commitment letters will not be processed. 
(ii)  When  audited  project  financial  statements  are  not  received  within  6  months  after  the  due  date,  ADB  will 
withhold processing of requests for new contract awards and disbursement such as new replenishment of 
advance accounts, processing of new reimbursement, and issuance of new commitment letters. ADB will (a) 
inform the executing agency of ADB’s actions; and (b) advise that the loan may be suspended if the audit 
documents are not received within the next 6 months. 
(iii)  When audited project financial statements  are not received within 12 months after the due date, ADB may 
suspend the loan. 
INTERNAL. This information is accessible to ADB Management and staff. It may be shared outside ADB with appropriate permission. 
29 
Public disclosure of the audited project financial statements, including the auditor’s opinion 
on the project financial statements, will be guided by ADB’s Access to Information Policy 2018. 
After the review, ADB will disclose the audited project financial statements and the opinion of the 
auditors on the project financial statements no later than 14 days of ADB’s confirmation of their 
acceptability  by  posting  them  on  ADB’s  website.  The  management  letter,  additional  auditor’s 
opinions, and audited entity financial statements will not be disclosed.8 
VI. 
PROCUREMENT AND CONSULTING SERVICES 
A. 
Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing 
All  advance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  will  be  undertaken  in  conformity  with 
ADB Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time) and ADB’s Guidelines on the 
Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). The issuance of invitations to bid under 
advance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  will  be  subject  to  ADB  approval.  The  borrower, 
executing  and  IAs  have  been  advised  that  approval  of  advance  contracting  and  retroactive 
financing does not commit ADB to finance the project. 
Advance  contracting.  Advance  contracting  will  be  applied  for  the  consulting  services 
contracts, and for five works contracts. Steps to be concluded in advance for works contracts are 
prequalification and shortlisting, issue of bidding documents, and evaluation of bids. Steps to be 
concluded  in  advance  for  consulting  contracts  are  prequalification  and  shortlisting,  issue  of 
request for proposals and evaluation of bids. 
Retroactive  financing.  Retroactive  financing  will  be  applied  for  consulting  service 
contracts  for  individual  consultants  for  start-up  support  and  external  monitoring.  Retroactive 
financing  will  be  allowed  up  to  20%  of  the  loan  amount  for  eligible  expenditures  prior  to  loan 
effectiveness. 
B. 
Procurement of Goods, Works, and Consulting Services 
All  procurement  of  goods  and  works  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB’s 
Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time). A strategic procurement planning 
study was carried out. Value for Money is achieved by (i) national competitive bidding (NCB) with 
national  advertising  for  ADB-financed  contracts  to  achieve  competitive  bid  prices,  with  ADB 
finance prioritized for larger contracts with a good state of readiness, and  (ii) open competitive 
bidding with national advertising under domestic procurement regulations by e-procurement using 
bidding centers for counterpart financed contracts. Counterpart finance is applied to lower value 
and  diverse  procurement such  as  goods  and  ICT systems  for  which detailed  design  is  not  yet 
available, and for which a larger number of separate packages or lots may be required. This takes 
advantage of the low administrative cost (for both client and bidders) and speed of the domestic 
e-procurement  system.  NCB  contracts  would  be  procured  following  national  procedures  in 
accordance with the PRC Tendering and Bidding Law (1999), subject to modifications as agreed 
with ADB and consigned in the NCB annex to the procurement plan. 
NCB with national advertising will be used for procurement of 11 ADB-financed works and 
goods contracts with total value of $231.7 million (of which ADB finance portion is $136.6 million) 
and estimated contract amounts between $1.7 and $36.7 million. 
8 Access to Information Policy: http://www.adb.org/documents/access-information-policy   
30 
Before  the  start  of  any  procurement,  ADB  and  the  government  will  review  the  public 
procurement  laws  of  the  central  and  state  governments  to  ensure  consistency  with  ADB’s 
Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time). 
An 18-month procurement plan indicating threshold and review procedures, goods, works, 
and consulting service contract packages and NCB guidelines is in Section C. 
The terms of reference for all consulting services are detailed in the tranche 3 subproject 
summaries. An estimated 193 person-months of consulting services are required to (i) facilitate 
project management and implementation and strengthen the institutional and operational capacity 
of  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies,  (ii)  carry  out  external  monitoring  of  safeguards 
(environmental and social), and (iii) provide start-up support to the EA and IAs. A consulting firm 
will be engaged using the QCBS method with a quality–cost ratio of 80:20, together with individual 
consultants.

VII. 
SAFEGUARDS 
Safeguard classifications. Potential impacts of tranche 3 of the Program are classified 
as “B” for environment, “B” for involuntary resettlement, and “B” for impacts on indigenous peoples 
(ethnic minorities). Tranche 3 has been screened, categorized, and assessed using the safeguard 
procedures  set  out  in  the  Program’s  environment  assessment  review  framework  (EARF),  and 
resettlement framework (RF) which reflect the PRC’s laws, regulations, and guidelines, and also 
ADB’s safeguard policy requirements, outlined in Safeguard Policy Statement (2009).9 
Grievance  redress  mechanism.  The  GPMO  ensures  that  each  PIE  will  establish  a 
grievance redress  mechanism  (GRM) for  each subproject  with  the consent  and support  of  the 
project-affected  persons  within  60  days  of  the  loan  effectiveness  date  and  before  the 
commencement of any project-related construction activity. A GRM will be established following 
the guidelines given in the environmental management plan (EMP) and the RPs. Each GRM will 
set  out  its  procedures  for  receiving  and  reviewing,  resolving,  and  recording  individual  and 
community concerns, and grievances, and complaints of the APs. It will provide the APs and the 
affected communities the contact details of focal points for safeguard compliance at the GPMO, 
IAs, PIEs, contractors, and other relevant agencies at project involved in Project administration. 
The GPMO will brief all contractors on safeguard requirements of subprojects and the role of the 
GRM in each subproject. Copies of the Public Information Booklet will be distributed among all 
the APs and stakeholders before commencing project implementation. Multiple approach points 
to each GRM  will  be  available including  verbal  and written  complaints, a hotline  number,  drop 
boxes, and e-mail contacts. The GPMO will report on complaints and grievances and the progress 
in their resolution to ADB in a quarterly project progress report and in safeguard monitoring reports. 
Prohibited investment activities. Pursuant to ADB’s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), 
ADB  funds  may  not  be  applied  to  the  activities  described  on  ADB’s  Prohibited  Investment 
Activities List set forth at Appendix 5 of the Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). 
Environment 
An environmental assessment and review framework has been prepared for the program 
to categorize and provide guidance on environmental safeguards for subsequent tranches of the 
MFF. These documents comply with the PRC’s regulatory requirements and ADB’s Safeguard 
Policy Statement and have been disclosed on ADB’s website. 
Environmental  assessment,  reports,  and  approvals.  Each  subproject  proposed 
through tranche 3 have been classified by ADB as category B for environment. A consolidated 
initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  and  EMP  have  been  prepared  based  on  information 
provided  in  the  domestic  environmental  impact  reports  (EIRs)  and  environment  impact  tables 
(EITs), feasibility study reports, and site reconnaissance. The EIRs and EITs for all subprojects 
have been approved by the local Environmental Protection Bureaus. The IEE and EMP will be 
updated during detailed design as required.

40 
Environmental impacts and mitigations. Potential environmental impacts from tranche 
3 subproject  activities  include  (i)  dust,  noise,  and soil  runoff  during  construction;  (ii)  temporary 
traffic  disturbances  because  of  transportation  of construction  materials; (iii)  risks to  community 
and  workers’  health  and  safety  during  construction;  and  (iv)  wastewater  and  solid  waste 
generated during construction and operation. The EMP defines mitigation measures, monitoring 
requirements,  and  institutional  arrangements  to  ensure  proper  environmental  management 
throughout construction and operation. Potential APs and stakeholders were consulted, and their 
concerns  will  be  addressed  through  the  implementation  of  the  EMP.  The  GPMO  will  submit 
semiannual environmental monitoring reports to ADB and engage an external monitor who will 
also submit semiannual monitoring reports to both GPMO and ADB. 
The construction contractors will be responsible for the implementation of the EMP. GPMO, 
together  with  PIEs  will  have  the  overall  responsibility  for  supervising  the  contractors’ 
environmental performance, coordinating public consultations and the project GRM, and reporting 
to  ADB  through  quarterly  project  progress  reports  and  semiannual  internal  environment 
monitoring reports. Each PIE will assign an environment officer to supervise the implementation 
of  EMP.  The  responsibilities  of  the  environment  officer  are  (i)  reviewing  and  approving  site-
specific  EMPs,  (ii)  monitoring  of  EMP  implementation,  (iii)  establishing  GRM,  (iv)  organizing 
training on environmental management, and (v) updating IEE and EMP (if necessary). GPMO will 
engage an external monitor who will validate monitoring results and submit semiannual reports to 
GPMO and ADB. 
Environment  budget.  GPMO  will  make  available  in  a  timely  manner  the  necessary 
budget and human resources to fully implement the EMP. The total estimated cost of the EMP 
implementation  is  about  $1.492  million  (EMP  Table  10:  Estimated  Budget  for  Environmental 
Management Plan Implementation). During implementation, records of actual budget should be 
maintained and included in the project completion report. 
Capacity  development  and  training.  The  capacity  of  GPMO,  the  IAs,  and  PIEs  to 
coordinate environmental management will be strengthened through the appointment of qualified 
staff  within  the  GPMO  and  each  PIE,  as  environmental  coordinators  in  charge  of  EMP 
coordination,  implementation,  and  site  inspections  including  GRM.  The  PMC  will  include  an 
Environmental  Specialist  to  guide  GPMO  and  PIEs  in  implementing  the  EMP  and  ensuring 
compliance  with  ADB’s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.  Each  PIE  will  also  commission  an 
independent  Environmental  Supervision  Engineer  to  provide  independent  monitoring  and 
verification  of  EMP  implementation,  as  well  as  commissioning  local  environmental  monitoring 
stations to conduct environmental quality monitoring. 
The capacity of GPMO, PIEs and contractors’ staff responsible for EMP implementation 
and supervision will be strengthened through the appointment of qualified staff and training. All 
parties involved in implementing and supervising the EMP must understand the goals, methods, 
and practices of project environmental management. A training plan is included in the EMP (see 
Table EMP-7: Training Program). 
Consultation.  During  environmental  safeguard  due  diligence  (July–September  2020), 
stakeholder  consultations  were  carried  out  using  questionnaire  surveys.  Consultations  were 
carried out at all subproject sites and respondents included affected residents from neighboring 
villages,  farmers,  students,  village  committees,  and  management  committees’  members.  All 
persons and organizations consulted expressed support for the project. Further consultations will 
take  place  before  the  start  of  construction  works  (with  due  considerations  to  national  and  the 
INTERNAL. This information is accessible to ADB Management and staff. It may be shared outside ADB with appropriate permission. 
41 
World Health Organization guidelines on COVID-19 risks). Meaningful consultations will continue 
throughout  project  implementation.  Proposed  public  consultation  during  construction  and 
operation are set out in the EMP (Table EMP-8: Public Consultation Plan). Proposals include site 
visits, interviews, workshops, and investigation of specific issues. 
Climate risk and vulnerability assessment. Climate risk and vulnerability assessment 
concluded that the level of overall climate risk level for the tranche 3 subprojects is medium. Key 
climate  change  impacts  will  be  through  the  increasing  storm  intensity.  GPMO  will  ensure  that 
detailed  engineering  design  and  drawings  to  be  prepared  by  design  institutes  incorporate 
proactive disaster risk reduction and climate adaptation and mitigation measures. 
Climate mitigation is estimated to cost $4.57 million and climate adaptation is estimated 
to cost $2.11 million. ADB will finance 86% of mitigation costs and 91% of adaptation costs. Key 
climate change mitigation measures include making use of advanced energy-saving technologies 
in subproject design, the installation of solar power system, using zero or low greenhouse global 
warming  potential  (GWP)  refrigerant  in  the  cold  warehouse  development,  increased  transport 
efficiency, and energy-saving, and water saving design in building development through green-
building techniques, sponge urban design concept, and new types of building materials. 
Involuntary Resettlement 
The Project is category B for involuntary resettlement. Land acquisition and resettlement 
impacts  of  the  Tranche  3  are  not  deemed  significant,  as  the  number  of  significantly  affected 
persons  (those  who  will  lose  more  than  10%  of  household  income  and/or  will  physically  be 
displaced) is less than 200 persons in each subproject. Moreover, most of the APs do not depend 
on agricultural land for their livelihood and have easy access to non-agricultural employment and 
cross-border trade facilities to earn their living. Four subprojects; (i) the Chongzuo Cold Chain 
Logistics  Demonstration  Subproject,  (ii)  Chongzuo  Sino–Viet  Nam  Border  Economic  Zone 
Demonstration subproject (Phase II), (iii) Chongzuo Daxin Sino–Viet Nam Cross-border Tourism 
Subproject,  and  (iv)  Fangchenggang  Sino–ASEAN  Trade  and  Cultural  Exchange  Center 
subproject will require permanent acquisition and/or occupation of 2,069.52 mu10 of land, of which, 
rural  collective  land  and  state-owned  farmland  of  794.08  mu  will  be  acquired,  and  the  rest 
1,275.44  mu  is  existing  state-owned  construction  land.  Permanent  land  acquisition  will  affect 
1,961 persons living in 500 households. Houses and structures of 5,057.17 m2 will be demolished, 
affecting 114 persons in 29 households. 
The  construction  of  the  Baise  University  Sino–Viet  Nam  Cross-border  Training  Center 
subproject and the Baise Cross-border Agricultural Products Industry Chain Upgrading subproject 
will  be  constructed  on  state-owned  land  and  as  a  result,  there  will  be  no  land  acquisition  and 
resettlement  impacts.  In  the  Chongzuo  Sino–Viet  Nam  Border  Economic  Zone  Demonstration 
subproject (Phase II) and the Chongzuo Cold Chain Logistics Demonstration Subproject, part of 
the  required  land  had  already  been  acquired  before  the  Project  was  formulated.  While 
compensation  payments  have  been  completed,  skills  training  and income restoration  activities 
are  still  ongoing,  and  the  land  use  rights  certificate  is  still  being  processed.  Progress  of  these 
activities will be monitored and reported as part of the internal and external monitoring. 
A draft resettlement plan (RP) has been prepared for each of the four subprojects. They 
are based on the findings of the feasibility study and the preliminary measurement surveys, and 
10 A mu is a Chinese unit of measurement (1 mu = 666.67 square meters). 
42 
the results of the consultations and group discussions with the APs, IAs, PIEs, and GPMO. The 
GPMO  has  already  established  a  grievance  redress  mechanism  and  will  ensure  that  the 
necessary  budget,  staffing,  monitoring,  and  coordination  activities  are  in  place  during  project 
implementation.  Capacity  building  activities  will  be  provided  to  the  GPMO  and  concerned 
agencies  during  project  implementation.  The  RDDRs  and  RPs  have  been  uploaded  on  ADB’s 
website and on the local government’s website. The RDDRs will be reconfirmed or updated, and 
the RPs will be updated based on detailed design; and will be submitted to ADB for review and 
approval  before  the  award  of  civil  work  contracts  and  commencement  of  land  acquisition  and 
resettlement activities. 
Indigenous Peoples (Ethnic Minorities) 
The Project is category B for indigenous peoples. The total population in the Project areas 
was 4,432,620 in 2019, of which the ethnic minorities (EM) population was about 3,730,629 (84%). 
The predominant groups are Zhuang and Yao ethnic minorities. The subprojects are unlikely to 
have adverse impacts on EM communities’ culture, religion, and belief systems. Ethnic minorities 
are  expected to  share the  same  project  benefits  and opportunities  while  measures to  address 
adverse impacts and risks related to involuntary resettlement are reflected in the RPs. 
VIII.  GENDER AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS 
The  SDGAP  of  tranche  3  focuses  on  how  to  increase  local  people’s  opportunities  for 
improving their life opportunities through the Investment Project, especially of women, and the 
poor. The Project will generate a robust socioeconomic base in subproject areas to achieve this 
key  objective.  It  will  also  help  build  the  capacity  of  local  communities  to  respond  to  new 
employment and cultural exchange opportunities that will be generated by subprojects. Once such 
a socioeconomic base is established, local government agencies, Women’s Federation, and the 
project management will improve the capacity of the local population to participate in remunerative 
and  culturally  fulfilling  community  participation  programs  which  will,  in  turn,  help  improve  their 
living  standards  and  socioeconomic  networks.  The  SDGAP  will  ensure  equal  participation  of 
women in development activities and maximization of project benefits for the local communities 
with positive gender impacts. The expected outputs of SDGAP are (a) increase the participation 
of local people in expanded employment opportunities with a guaranteed percentages of 30% of 
employments  allocated 
the  project  construction  and  operation 
phases (DMF gender  targets focus  on  employment  generated  during  the operation  phase); (b) 
lead businesses and enterprises to benefit from the enhancement of community development and 
regional cooperation and enable them to absorb trained and skilled women and men in subproject 
areas  to  their  workforces;  (c)  engage  local  people  and  especially  women  in  institutional 
strengthening and participatory capacity building for project implementation and management; (d) 
facilitate their participation in cultural exchanges and cross-border economic transactions, and (e) 
open a window for local people, especially for women, to benefit from the improvement of border 
area tourism which would generate more employment and income earning opportunities. 
to  women  during 
Gender. The Project is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming. As found during 
the social and poverty analysis (PSA), the Project will provide many opportunities to benefit the 
local people including women and the poor/low-income households in community-level activities. 
Women can participate in public awareness programs and play an active role in environmental 
protection in villages. Also, they can benefit from the Project by getting employed as skilled and 
unskilled workers during the project construction and operation phases, and by participating in 
project decision-making processes. In addition, they will get skills training that enables them in 
getting employed in Project activities and elsewhere, thereby improving their household incomes. 
INTERNAL. This information is accessible to ADB Management and staff. It may be shared outside ADB with appropriate permission. 
43 
The SDGAP ensures that the Project is socially inclusive for women. Adequate measures are in 
place  to  proactively  support  gender  mainstreaming.  Focus  group  discussions  (FGDs), 
consultations, field  surveys,  individual  interviews,  document  review,  and discussions  with local 
women and office  bearers  of  the  Women’s  Federation have  revealed that  gender  issues  have 
long been one of the main focuses of local governments in subproject areas. The local women’s 
federations  have  also,  for  a  long time,  been  advocating for  women’s  interests to  improve  their 
economic and social status. Such local women’s federations with the help of local government 
departments such as public security bureaus and nongovernment institutions have been making 
great efforts to guarantee women’s rights in households and communities and improve their living 
conditions. E-commerce is one of the important training fields, and the Women’s Federation is 
already  providing  such  training  to  women  in  the  border  areas.  The  project  will  establish  local 
Women’s Federation branches first at four pilot villages to assist women to strengthen such efforts 
and will help local governments on gender mainstreaming and empowerment. During the project 
implementation phase, the number of villages, which receive direct assistance from the Women’s 
Federation, will be increased based on the experiences of the four pilot villages. 
Poverty and Social 
The Social and Poverty Analysis (PSA) shows that the average poverty rate in the project 
area is 0.92%, however the average poverty rate varied significantly between the subproject areas. 
For example, the subproject area of the Chongzuo Daxin Sino–Viet Nam Cross-border Tourism 
is the poorest with the highest poverty rate of 30.8%. The Xinhe Town where the Chongzuo Sino- 
Viet Nam Border Economic Zone Demonstration Project (Phase II) subproject is located has the 
lowest poverty rate of 0.15%. 
The Project will (a) improve interconnections among the populations in subproject areas, 
(b) enhance the local living environment, (c) introduce targeted intervention measures, (d) exploit 
natural and geographical advantages of border areas and characteristic advantages of port trade 
to achieve innovative development in border trade, cross-border e-commerce, and barter trade 
between border inhabitants, (e) drive the regional economic growth, (f) absorb local labor force 
for  Project  activities,  thereby  increasing  their  incomes  and  living  standards,  and  (g)  facilitate 
cultural exchange between the PRC and Viet Nam broadening social and business links between 
the two countries. 
It is estimated that the subprojects will annually provide 4,900 additional job opportunities 
to local residents during the construction period. During the construction phase, 615 skilled jobs, 
and 985 unskilled jobs will be created. During the operation phase, 1320 skilled jobs and 2010 
unskilled  jobs  will  be  generated  and  30%  -  40%  of  such  jobs  will  be  allocated  to  women.  In 
allocation of the remaining jobs, poor, and vulnerable households will get priority. 
Residents in the subproject areas will receive training on labor skills and cross-border e-
commerce arrangements. The Project will annually train 3,610 residents in employable skills. 36% 
of them will be poor persons and 40% will be women. Project implementation will promote local 
economic growth and residents’ life chances. In addition, the Project will promote infrastructure 
conditions  and  investment  environment  on  the  PRC–Viet  Nam  border  providing  convenient 
conditions  for  human  resource  development,  labor  force  search,  trade,  and  cultural  exchange 
generating more income earning opportunities for the poor. The cross-border transactions and 
improved connectivity will facilitate economic growth and create employment opportunities during 
the construction and operation phases for local communities. 
44 
The Program will contribute to economic growth in the PRC–Viet Nam border areas and 
in  the  PRC  and  Viet  Nam.  The  improved  cross-border  connectivity  and  increased  trade  and 
investment  will  facilitate  economic  growth  and  create  employment  opportunities  for  local 
communities during the construction and operation phases and raise the income of residents. 
The SDGAP is intended to help maximize the project benefit through: (i) training of the 
local people with careful consideration of the needs of different social groups such as gender, 
ethnic, and vulnerable groups; and (ii) creating more employment opportunities and making them 
available  to  local  people  paying  attention  to  their  gender,  ethnicity,  and  vulnerability.  Each 
subproject  has  its  own action  plan  outlining  proposed activities, targets,  responsible agencies, 
monitoring indicators, budget, and timelines. They are summarized in Table 18 and fully detailed 
in the SDGAP.

Skills Training Programs for Women–Procedures 
To ensure effective SDGAP implementation, it is necessary to further clarify how to focus 
on gender in skills training programs. 
1. 
Number/Percentage of Women for Each Output. 
Based on interviews with the local WFs, field investigations, percentages of women for 
various training and assistance programs will be identified to meet the overall SGAP targets. 
2. 
Implementation of Skills and Awareness Training Programs for All Outputs. 
  Women will be encouraged to participate in project activities and improve their ability to 
earn better income. PMOs and IAs at all levels will be sensitized to this requirement. 
(i)  First  Stage:  Training  syllabus  preparation.  Assessment  of  training  needs  of 
residents  and  SMEs  in  subproject  areas  will  be  done  before  formulating  training 
content,  deciding  teaching  methods,  selecting  of  training  locations,  and  deciding 
registration procedures. This will be done by soliciting residents' opinions on training 
design using questionnaires, interviews, and conferences. Ideas and suggestions and 
will  be  collected  based  on  interviews  with  not  less  than 50%  of female  residents  in 
sample villages, at various age categories, and educational levels. 
(ii)  Second  Stage:  Developing  the  training  implementation  plan.  (a)  The  scope  of 
training targets will be defined, based on training content, and purposes. For example, 
training targets for employment, and skills development are mainly for women in the 
age  category  of  16-64  years,  while  training  on  traffic  safety  and  awareness  will  be 
given across all ages. (b) Considering the training targets and contents, the training 
location will be flexibly determined so as to ensure that more women can easily obtain 
training  opportunities;  (c)  Considering  women’s  low  educational  levels,  training 
methods will combine course teaching with on site demonstration. (d) The design of 
training courses will be based on training target selection. For example, e-commerce 
business training will accomplish skill building of women by the local WF, who can lead 
and drive the development of more common women in the community. Some women 
with  junior  high  school  and  high  school  education  degree  or  above,  and those who 
have a strong sense of marketing will be chosen as leaders and facilitators. 
(iii)  Third Stage: Issuing training notices and conducting training. (a) Residents in the 
subproject  areas  will  be  informed  of  the  training  programs  through  community 
meetings,  posting  of  notices,  and/or  mobile  WeChat  group  communication.  The 
training notices will specify the training content, location, form, and feedback phone, 
and contact person. (b) PMOs and IAs will publish a list of candidates who are willing 
to receive training before the courses start including information such as gender, age, 
contact information, and addresses. If a woman drops out, the agency will contact a 
new trainee from the list. 
(iv)  Fourth Stage: Training impact assessment and evaluation. During or after training, 
an  assessment  will  be  conducted  on  the  content,  form,  duration,  location  and  the 
faculty of the training, and such improvement feedback will be incorporated  into the 
next training course.

3. 
Cultural Exchange Programs of the Baise University Sino–Viet Nam Cross-
border Training Center Subproject 
The  training  programs  at  the  Baise  University  Sino–Viet  Nam  Cross-border  Training 
Center are for two groups. 
(i)  National  and  International  Students  of  Baise  University.  Students  who  are 
interested in training programs can participate regardless of their age, gender, and 
ethnic identity. At the same time, students from poor families, ethnic minorities, and 
women are encouraged to participate in training programs. 
(ii)  Residents with training needs. Women in the project areas are the main carriers 
of cultural inheritance and the sharers of folk art and crafts. Therefore, the Project 
will make full use of the skills of such local women. Firstly, some folk artists who are 
experts in abstract cultural heritage presentation will be invited as part-time lecturers 
at  the  Center.  They  will  also be  given  priority  allocation  of  venues to  display their 
works.  Secondly,  the  subproject  will  encourage,  and  promote  more  women  to 
participate in cultural exchange activities and training programs, the training will not 
set  restrictions  such  as  age  or  educational  level  and,  those  who  are  from  poor 
families  can  apply  for  some  payment  relief  for  training  course  fees  and 
accommodation. 
The trainees and visitors can decide where to stay during their training. If they prefer to 
stay at the hotel, (one of the project buildings), they can get their meals from the school canteen. 
Fees for accommodation or meals will be lower than the market prices nearby the University. 
B. 
Budget and Implementation Arrangements 
A  Social  Development/Gender  Specialist 
the 
implementation of the SDGAP. The implementation of the SDGAP will be financed by the project 
budget and local government budgets. With the support from the national consultant, the GPMO 
will coordinate the implementation of the SDGAP and will assign a focal point at each subproject 
to  assist  the  implementation  of  SDGAP.  The  local  WF  representatives  will  also  assist  the 
implementation of the SDGAP at the subproject level. 
(national  consultant)  will  guide 
IAs  in  coordination  with  the  contractors  and  village  committees  (town  government,  if 
necessary) will ensure that local laborers (both men and women) are employed during the project 
construction and implementation by giving priority to those local people who lost their land partially 
to the Project. 
The local government (mainly town government or similar level government) and village 
committee will ensure that all complaints and appeals relevant to the proposed subprojects are 
documented  and  responded  to  in  a  timely  manner.  IAs  and  contractors  will  also  have  focal 
persons to coordinate the operation of the grievance redress mechanism. 
C. 
Monitoring and Evaluation 
  Monitoring and evaluation of the SDGAP will be incorporated into the overall monitoring 
and evaluation framework of the Project. The national consultant will work with IAs and the EA to 
orient them on SDGAP’s requirements and to develop a detailed implementation and monitoring 
plan for SDGAP. The national consultant will guide the drafting of the first SDGAP Implementation 
52 
Progress Report and will review subsequent monitoring and progress reports, prepared by the 
IAs. They will submit semiannual monitoring reports to the EA and ADB for review and approval. 
Updated and revised project information and SDGAP implementation status will be included in 
the  project  progress  reports,  midterm  evaluation  reports,  and  project  completion  reports.  An 
external  monitor  will  verify  the  internal  monitoring  findings.  ADB’s  gender  specialists  will 
participate  periodically  in  project  review  missions  and  guide  the  PMO,  IAs,  and  other  relevant 
agencies, which are involved in social and gender development.

B. 
Monitoring 
Project performance monitoring. The project performance monitoring system indicators, 
as  specified  in  the  design  and  monitoring  framework,  will  include  (i)  gross  domestic  product 
growth, and (ii) Guangxi’s cross-border trade with Viet Nam. At the start of project implementation, 
the  EA,  IAs,  and  PIEs,  with  support  of  the  project  management  consultants  will  develop 
comprehensive  PPMS  procedures to  generate  data  systematically  on  project outcome,  inputs, 
and outputs of each subproject. These will be used to measure the tranche 3 impacts, outcome, 
outputs, and compliance with ADB safeguard policy requirements. The EA will (i) refine the PPMS 
framework, (ii) establish and/or verify the baselines, (iii) confirm achievable targets, (iv) finalize 
the  monitoring  and  recording  arrangements,  and  (v)  establish  data  collection  systems  and 
reporting procedures no later than nine months after the loan effectiveness. A project performance 
monitor specialist, engaged under the project management support for tranche 3, will support the 
executing, and IAs and PIEs to conduct appropriate project monitoring. Disaggregated baseline 
data and output and outcome indicators gathered during project processing will be updated and 
reported  quarterly  through  the  quarterly  progress  reports  and  after  each  ADB  review  mission. 
These quarterly reports will provide information necessary to update ADB's project performance 
reporting system.11 
Compliance  monitoring.  The  EA,  with  assistance  of  the  IAs,  PIEs,  and  the  project 
management  consulting  service  will  conduct  compliance  monitoring,  submit  periodic  (at  least 
semiannual)  reports  to  ADB  concerning  the  use  of  the  loan  proceeds,  project  implementation, 
project  implementation  performance,  and  compliance  of  loan,  and  project  covenants.  These 
reports  will  also  include  (i)  progress  reports  on  project  implementation  including  environment, 
involuntary resettlement, and SDGAP; (ii) consolidated annual reports; (iii) semiannual internal 
environmental  monitoring  report;  (iv)  semiannual  environmental  external  monitor  report;  (v) 
semiannual  external resettlement monitoring report  and SDGAP;  and (vi)  a project  completion 
report, which should be submitted not later than three months after the completion of the project 
facilities.  The  compliance  status  of  loan  and  project  covenants  will  be  reported  and  assessed 
through  quarterly  progress  report  and  consolidated  annual  reports.  ADB  review  missions  will 
verify the status. 
Environmental  compliance  monitoring.  Three  types  of  project  monitoring  will  be 
conducted under the EMP: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
Project readiness monitoring: Conducted by the PMC environment specialist 
or GPMO environmental focal point (under the support of EEM); 
Environmental  quality  monitoring:  Conducted  by  a  local  environment 
monitoring  specialist  (EMS)  (contracted  by  the  project  implementation  units) 
involving the collection and analyses of air quality and noise data at designated 
monitoring locations to assess compliance with applicable environmental quality 
and emission standards during construction; and 
Compliance monitoring or  auditing:  Conducted  by the  external  environment 
monitor to verify EMP compliance during project. 
The  Environmental  Supervision  Engineers  will  carry  out  day-to-day  supervision  of 
implementation  of  the  EMP.  The  environment  specialist  of  PMC  will  visit  the  project  sites  on 
regular  basis  and  support  GPMO  in  developing  the  quarterly  project  progress  reports  and the 
11 ADB’s project performance reporting system is available at 
https://www.adb.org/Documents/Slideshows/PPMS/default.asp?p=evaltool  
56 
semiannual  environmental  monitoring  reports.  The  reports  should  confirm  the  project’s 
compliance with the EMP and local legislation, identify any environment-related implementation 
issues  and  necessary  corrective  actions.  Operation  and  performance  of  the  project  GRM, 
environmental  institutional  strengthening,  and  training,  public  consultation,  compliance  with  all 
covenants under the project and site photographs will also be included in the report. A template 
for the environmental monitoring report is included in the IEE. 
ADB will oversee project compliance based on the quarterly project progress reports and 
annual environmental monitoring reports provided by GPMO and review missions (generally 1-2 
times/year). 
Involuntary resettlement: Internal and external monitoring of the RP implementation will 
be conducted. The GPMO will carry out internal supervision and monitoring to ensure compliance 
with the provisions of the RPs and corrective actions and submit internal resettlement monitoring 
reports  semi-annually  during  project  implementation,  to  be  submitted  together  with  the 
semiannual social monitoring reports. The GPMO will also employ an external monitoring agency 
to  carry  out  its  own  verification  and  monitoring.  Semiannual  external  monitoring  reports  and 
resettlement completion reports will be prepared and submitted to the GPMO and ADB and will 
be uploaded on the ADB website. 
Gender  and  social  dimensions  monitoring.  In  accordance  with  ADB’s  PPMS 
requirements,  a  M&E  plan  for  the  gender  and  social  development  activities  will  be  developed 
during the tranche 3 implementation. The plan will provide key indicators for monitoring poverty, 
gender, and social aspects of each subproject. In addition to the internal monitoring conducted 
by the project city governments and the project management consulting services, a resettlement 
and social external monitoring consultant—a qualified consulting company or a research institute 
or an individual consultant—will be engaged by GPMO to analyze socioeconomic, gender, and 
poverty  impacts  of  the  subprojects.  The  key  indicators  in  the  SDGAP  will  be  monitored  and 
included in PPMS. 
C. 
Evaluation 
The EA, IAs, and ADB will undertake semiannual review mission to evaluate the progress 
of project implementation. The EA, IAs, and ADB will undertake a comprehensive midterm review 
two  years  after  the  start  of  project  implementation  to  have  a  detailed  evaluation  of  the  scope, 
implementation arrangements, resettlement, achievement of scheduled targets, and progress on 
the agenda for policy reform and capacity building measures. Feedback from the PPMS activities 
will be analyzed. Within three months of physical completion of the project, the EA will submit a 
project completion report to ADB. 
D. 
Reporting 
The EA and IAs will provide ADB with (i) quarterly progress reports in a format consistent 
with ADB's project performance reporting system; (ii) consolidated annual reports including (a) 
progress achieved by output as measured through the indicator's performance targets, (b) key 
implementation  issues  and  solutions,  (c)  updated  procurement  plan,  and  (d)  updated 
implementation  plan  for  the  next  12  months;  (iii)  semiannual  environment  and  resettlement 
safeguards  monitoring reports  and (iv)  a  project  completion report  within  6  months of  physical 
completion of the project. To ensure that projects will continue to be both viable and sustainable, 
project accounts, audited project financial statements, and the audited entity financial statements 
together with the associated auditor's report, should be adequately reviewed.

E. 
Stakeholder Communication Strategy 
The  Stakeholder  Communication  Strategy  is  based  on  the  principles  of  transparency, 
timeliness,  meaningful  participation,  and  inclusiveness.  The  strategy  ensures  that  vulnerable 
groups, such as the poor, and women, who risk further marginalization, are provided opportunities 
for  communication  and  feedback  during  subproject  design  and  implementation.  Meaningful 
participation is defined as a process that: (i) begins early in the project preparation stage; and is 
carried out throughout the project cycle; (ii) provides timely disclosure of relevant and adequate 
information that is understandable and readily accessible to the APs. 
Stakeholders  include:  (i)  each  subproject’s  direct  and  indirect  beneficiaries  especially 
small  business  operators  and  employees  of  cross-border  trade-related  businesses;  (ii)  mass 
organizations; (iii)  BEZ and  border  crossing  point management  committees,  and PIEs  that  are 
responsible for community-level border social economic development, and site management; (iv) 
private sector operators who share an interest in the outcomes and/or impacts of the subproject; 
and (v) government agencies having a role in subproject implementation. The strategy serves to 
inform and support community development, enhance government capacity to manage project 
outcomes, and enhance project benefits while mitigating negative impacts. 
The  Stakeholder  Communication  Strategy  is  designed  to  ensure:  (i)  a  regular  flow  of 
reliable project information; (ii) ownership over project outcomes and interest and/or willingness 
to take advantage of the project benefits; (iii) inclusion of vulnerable groups in benefit distribution 
and project implementation; and (iv) the promotion of border regional development. 
The EA and IAs will develop, establish, and maintain a dedicated website or new media 
tools  like  “WeChat”  public  platform  for  this  project.  The  website  or  platform  will  include  the 
following information: (i) periodic financial request report (PFRR) and the PAM for tranche 3; (ii) 
procurement  information  (bidding  procedures,  bidders,  and  contract  awards);  (iii)  annual  work 
plans;  (iv)  quarterly  and  annual  progress  reports  and  the  project  completion  report;  (v) 
environmental and social safeguards documents and their monitoring reports; (vi) information on 
grievance redress mechanisms; and (vii) technical reports and knowledge products produced by 
the project. ADB will provide a quarterly update on the program on its website. The EA and IAs 
will upload the above information on their websites and platforms. 
X. 
ANTICORRUPTION POLICY 
ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any violations of the 
Anticorruption  Policy  relating  to  the  project. 12  All  contracts  financed  by  ADB  shall  include 
provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of the EA 
and all project contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers. Individuals and/or 
entities on ADB’s anticorruption debarment list are ineligible to participate in ADB-financed activity 
and may not be awarded any contracts under the project.13

XI. 
ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISM 
People  who  are,  or may  in the  future  be,  adversely  affected  by the  project  may  submit 
complaints  to  ADB’s  Accountability  Mechanism.  The  Accountability  Mechanism  provides  an 
independent forum and process whereby people adversely affected by ADB-assisted projects can 
voice,  and  seek  a  resolution  of  their  problems,  as  well  as  report  alleged  violations  of  ADB’s 
operational  policies  and  procedures.  Before  submitting  a  complaint  to  the  Accountability 
Mechanism, affected people should make an effort in good faith to solve their problems by working 
with  the  concerned  ADB  operations  department.  Only  after  doing  that,  and  if  they  are  still 
dissatisfied, should they approach the Accountability Mechanism.14

Appendix 1: TRANCHE 3 SUBPROJECT SUMMARY 
I. 
SUBPROJECT 1: BAISE UNIVERSITY SINO–VIET NAM CROSS-BORDER 
TRAINING CENTER 
A. 
Project Description 
Baise University servicing around 17,600 students, is located around six-kilometer (km) 
north of central Baise City, near the border with Viet Nam and provides vocational education and 
training  including  subjects  such  as  cross-border  trade,  e-commerce,  tourism,  food  security, 
agriculture,  and  language  and  translation.  The  university  is  building  partnerships  with  local 
companies  to  supply  much  needed  skills  and  plans  to  increase  its  capacity  to  around  30,000 
students within the next five years. 
The  proposed  training  center  is  on  the  existing  campus  of  Baise  University  and  will 
primarily  serve  the  School  of  Continuing  Education  which  trains  adult  students  and  provides 
corporate training  programs,  has more  than  3,000  students  and  yet  does  not  have  permanent 
facilities. The new facilities will also be accessible to existing students and faculties. 
The  Project  involves  expansion  of  Baise  University  to  increase  its  training  capacity  by 
around 2,650 students in skills sought by local employers such as international trade, e-commerce, 
tourism, food security, agriculture, and language, and translation, and includes particular features 
such as an Art and Culture Exhibition Hall, Culture Exchange Performance Center,  and PRC–
Viet  Nam  Training  Center  including  training  laboratories  for  e-commerce  and  data  center 
operation,  together  with  surrounding  landscaping.  Accordingly,  the  subproject  is  expected  to 
promote small- and medium- enterprises (SME) development in the border area.

SUBPROJECT 2: BAISE CROSS-BORDER AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS 
INDUSTRY CHAIN UPGRADING PROJECT 
A. 
Project Description 
The  site  is  12  km  southeast  of  Baise  City  center,  adjacent  to  an  interchange  of  two 
expressways, and with a freight station on Nanning–Kunming Railway to the south, and a branch 
line to a fuel storage facility to the north of the site. The site occupies part of a a larger plot which 
is already partially developed and currently includes: i) two cold storage buildings with capacity of 
56,000 tons, and ii) a service center building. In addition to the proposed development a seafood 
processing facility is planned, and an e-commerce center building is under construction. 
The  proposed  subproject  includes  the  construction  of  a  facility  with  fruit  sorting  and 
packaging lines, fruit processing lines, a fruit and vegetable trading area, and refrigerated trucks, 
and containers, having the initial aim of value addition for key agricultural products produced by 
local SMEs and their onward distribution by rail transport, but also having potential for handling 
agricultural imports from ASEAN countries. 
Relying on abundance of local agricultural resources, Baise plays an important role in the 
national program of fruit and vegetable in the South supply to the North and further development 
under this subproject aims to i) eliminate rural poverty and the promotion of rural development, ii) 
promote  agricultural  industry  cooperation  in  the  PRC–ASEAN  free  trade  agreement  member 
countries, iii) promote rail logistics to Europe, iv) provide integrated service platform and network 
system  of  cold  chain  logistics,  promoting  production  and  marketing  linkage,  and  promoting 
agricultural production and increasing farmers' income.

SUBPROJECT 3: CHONGZUO COLD CHAIN LOGISTICS DEMONSTRATION 
PROJECT 
A. 
Project Description 
The two facilities are planned to be constructed in the PRC–Thailand Chongzuo Industrial 
Park,  on  two  separate  plots  around  8  km  apart.  The  sites  are  around  10  km  east,  and  15  km 
northeast of Chongzuo City, respectively. The bonded warehouse (not temperature controlled) is 
proposed for a plot adjacent to the Zuo River, while the cold storage facility will be located adjacent 
to the Nanning to Xiangxiang railway which is under construction and expected to open in 2022. 
There  is  currently  no  cold  storage  in  the  PRC–Thailand  Chongzuo  Industrial  Park, 
although some individual companies have their own warehouses on a smaller scale, and the need 
for cold storage is growing rapidly at an annual rate of 15%–20% in response to market demand. 
In Guangxi in 2019 there was existing cold storage of 1.38m tons, and there were plans to add 
0.6m tons in 2020. In Chongzuo, it is estimated 0.12m tons are needed. 
The  information  and  communication  technology  (ICT)  component  of  the  project  is  the 
supply/installation/commissioning  of  an  integrated  logistics/e-commerce  system  including 
network hardware/software, e-commerce system, cross-border transaction system, supply chain 
finance system, vehicle tracking, and management system. Elements of the ICT system would be 
applicable to both the cold storage and bonded warehouse components. 
The subproject will construct logistics facilities comprising a bonded warehouse (36,960 
m2) and yard (26,605 m2), adjacent to the newly constructed river port serving the economic zone, 
and a cold storage facility (cold storage [39,691 m2], standard factory building [7,480 m2], auxiliary 
warehouse,  business  office  building,  etc.  [4,896  m2])  located  close  to  rail  and  expressway 
junctions  on  the  principal  Pinxiang–Chongzuo–Nanning  transport  corridor.  These  facilities  will 
serve  companies  in  the  economic  zone,  and  the  cold  storage  facility  will  also  serve  logistics 
providers  transporting  imported  products  brought  overland  from  ASEAN  countries,  as  well  as 
products imported from the nearby seaports. The proposed facilities will serve 12% of fruit and 
25% of meat of the total import demand of Chongzuo City.

SUBPROJECT4: CHONGZUO SINO–VIET NAM BORDER ECONOMIC ZONE 
DEMONSTRATION PROJECT (PHASE II) 
A. 
Project Design 
Tranche 2 (Phase I) financed construction of six roads and a wastewater treatment plant 
(WWTP)  for  development  of  the  border  economic  zone  and  its  linkage  with  Xinhe  Town.  The 
WWTP will serve the existing and expanded border economic zone, with capacity 10,000 cubic 
meters per day (m3/day), and included construction of 21.9 km of predominately trunk pipes laid 
along the project roads. 
In  Tranche  3  (Phase  II),  financing  is  proposed  for  (a)  construction  /  upgrading  of  an 
additional six roads as asphaltic concrete, with a total length around 12.4 km to further develop 
the BEZ road network and external linkages, and for connection with the urban center; and (b) 
capacity  expansion  of  a  water  treatment  plant,  with  additional  capacity  of  15,000  m3/day,  and 
construction of 46 km of water supply pipes. This plant will serve the existing and expanded border 
economic zone activities (55%) as well as the urban area and surrounding villages (45%). The 
existing water plant in Xinhe Town has capacity of 4,000 m3/d and is already insufficient leading 
66 
to supply outages so is currently being upgraded by 15,000 m3/day to serve immediate needs, 
while the subproject will provide additional capacity for medium / long term needs. 
The Chongzuo Sino–Viet Nam border economic zone in 2017 employed around 31,000 
Vietnamese labor (mainly seasonal labor for sugar cane cutting), and in future this is expected to 
increase to 60,000. This is about 40%-50% of the labor. Current main industry in the zone is a 
sugar refinery and its related industries. Main planned industries are fruit processing (imported 
from Viet Nam, processed, sold in PRC) and light textiles (materials from PRC, processed, sold 
in Viet Nam).

SUBPROJECT 5: CHONGZUO DAXIN SINO–VIET NAM CROSS-BORDER 
TOURISM PROJECT 
A. 
Project Design 
Detian waterfall (Ban Gioc in Viet Nam) which lies on the PRC–Viet Nam border and is 
the  site  of  a  planned  bilateral  visitor  zone,  is  one  of  the  most  beautiful  natural  attractions  in 
Guangxi  province.  The  Chinese  side  of  the  waterfall  and  surrounding  area  attracts  1  -  2,000 
visitors on weekdays, and up to 10 times that number during golden week. Above the falls there 
has been a bilateral market for decades, with access to the small market area controlled by border 
guards on each side, and allowing sellers from either side, with entry by both border residents 
and tourists, and that this had been successful although on a small scale. 
This  waterfall  is  already  served  by  a  visitor  center  with  1,700  parking  spaces,  and 
subproject is for the upgrading of two roads and construction of an additional visitor center with 
314 parking spaces to accommodate steadily rising visitor numbers to the waterfall. The proposed 
project does not include specific elements relating to opening of the bilateral zone although it does 
include a surveillance system which may have dual purpose for both traffic management as well 
as monitoring of the movement of persons and goods. 
Proposed facilities for construction are: 
•  Roads: Upgraded X539 and new branch road—16.28 km of 2-lane roads 
•  Facilities:  Construction  of  new  Renai  visitor  center  and  parking—18,565m2  building 
area and 314 parking spaces 
•  ICT system: Various ICT elements including: a traffic and parking management system 
based on RFID tags, automatic license plate recognition; a surveillance system, control 
room  displays,  vehicle  /  facial  recognition  software,  data  storage;  Data  center  and 
68 
network  system,  application,  and  database  servers,  and  software,  disaster  recovery 
backup  system;  and  an  application  server  and  applications  including  cross-border 
tourism booking, mobile app, marketing application, management application, human 
resources application, and an E-commerce application 
•  Buses: Supply of 15 No. single deck city buses 10m length, 2 door, low step, electric,
