I. 
PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
1. 
The proposed project will advance rural vitalization and ecological protection in Ganzhou 
Municipality  (Ganzhou)  in  Jiangxi  Province  (Jiangxi)    by  (i) enhancing  the  regional  and  local 
ecological and environmental management capacities; (ii) promoting rural transformation and the 
region’s transition to green development; (iii) developing the rural environmental infrastructure to 
address degradation from economic development; and (iv) improving ecosystem protection of the 
area to improve livability. The project’s experiences and best practices of relieving climate change 
and ecological pressures can be replicated in the rest of the Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB), 
other parts of the People’s Republic of China (PRC), and developing member countries of the Asian 
Development  Bank  (ADB).  The  project  area  includes  Ganzhou’s  Nankang  District  and  eight 
counties: Chongyi, Dayu, Huichang, Ningdu, Shangyou, Shicheng, Xingguo, and Yudu, benefiting 
578,138 residents (285,651 women). 
A. 
Rationale 
The YREB is one of the three key economic growth engines in the PRC. Its nine provinces 
2. 
and two directly administered municipalities account for more than 40% of the population, 40% of 
freshwater  resources,  and  about  45%  of  the  country’s  economic  output.  While  the  YREB  has 
benefited from extensive development since the 1980s, economic growth in the middle and upper 
reaches  of  the  Yangtze  River  basin  lags  that  of  the  coastal  areas.  The  basin  faces  significant 
challenges  because  of  (i)  weak  institutional  coordination  for  strategic  planning;  (ii)  increasing 
pollution  and  pressure  on  natural  resources;  (iii)  slow  transition  to  green  development;  and 
(iv) limited integration of waterways, ports, and intermodal logistics. To manage these challenges, 
the Government of the PRC formulated the YREB Development Plan, 2016–2030.1 ADB and the 
government  also  agreed  to  adopt  a  systematic  approach  that  prioritizes  (i)  institutional 
strengthening  and  policy  reforms;  (ii)  ecosystem  restoration,  environmental  protection,  and 
management  of  water  resources;  (iii)  inclusive  green  development;  and  (iv)  construction  of  an 
integrated multimodal transport corridor. The project is included in the YREB framework.2 
3. 
Rural  transformation  has  lagged  urban  development  in  the  YREB.  As  a  result,  income 
inequality persists in rural areas of the less-developed middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze 
River basin. Rural wastewater and solid waste in most rural areas are directly discharged into the 
water  bodies  without  treatment  or  safe  disposal.  In  2020,  only  29%  of  villages  had  appropriate 
sanitation facilities and 75% had solid waste collection and disposal services, both contributing to 
poor environmental conditions.3 As the rural economy expands, proper regulatory, administrative, 
and environmental management will require stronger institutional capacity. To help respond, ADB 
supports the PRC’s rural vitalization strategy of promoting rural development, green and inclusive 
growth, wastewater and waste management, and ecosystem protection.4 
Gan  River,  one  of  the  major  branches  of  the  Yangtze  River  basin,  originates  in  the 
4. 
mountains  of  Ganzhou.  The  watershed  area  that  lies  within  Ganzhou  covers  36,400 square 
kilometers, or 44.8% of the total watershed area. Gan River, 766 is running through the province 
from south to north. Gan River is the largest tributary of Poyang Lake, through which it connects to 
Yangtze River. Poyang Lake is heavily affected by high levels of nutrient pollution loads from Gan

River, which also accelerate the environmental and ecological degradation of the rural areas along 
the river. 
5. 
Ganzhou is a large agricultural prefecture-level municipality in the south of Jiangxi. It lies in 
the middle reaches of the Yangtze River and on the upper Gan River, and is part of the YREB. It 
had an estimated population of 9.8 million in 2020 and a land area of 39,380 square kilometers.5 
Ganzhou was selected for the project because it has high rural–urban inequalities with nearly three 
times  on  the  average  disposable  income  and  weak  institutional  capacity  for  environmental 
management.  It  lags  other  municipalities  in  Jiangxi  in  economic  development. 6 Ganzhou  also 
suffers from repeated heavy rains and floods. It has a pressing need to improve the livability, health, 
and livelihood outcomes of its local communities. The State Council of the PRC chose Ganzhou as 
a demonstration area because it is relatively rural, has substantial agricultural and forestry potential, 
has  a  growing  tourism  industry7 and  lies  in  Jiangxi,  a  national  ecological  pilot  zone  with  unique 
tourism resources and environmental advantages. 
6. 
Weak  institutional  capacity  for  ecological  and  environmental  management.  The 
regulatory,  institutional,  and  technical  capacities  for  environmental  management  and  flood 
protection are inadequate at all administrative levels of Ganzhou. The systems for environmental 
monitoring, environmental information management, river water quality monitoring, and air pollution 
control are all weak or outdated and require urgent upgrades.8 Gan River has only a few automated 
water  quality  monitoring  stations,  and  the  testing  equipment  is  insufficient.  Ganzhou  also  lacks 
effective environmental management information system, poor environmental enforcement system, 
inadequate advocacy on environmental behaviors, and weak financial management systems and 
capacity. Regulatory enforcement is weak, as is effective information sharing between districts and 
counties, or the advocacy of and public participation in environmental problem-solving. 
7. 
Absence  of  viable  green  development  and  financing  mechanisms.  As  a  lagging 
municipality, Ganzhou lacks sustainable green development and green financing mechanisms to 
invest in water pollution control and rural livelihood improvements. Green agriculture technologies 
and practices to reduce nonpoint source pollution for green development are not widely applied.9 
Unsustainable  farming  practices  and  poor  farm  waste  management  persist.  Ganzhou  offers  no 
incentives for private sector investments to accelerate green development through village-based 
eco-friendly  business  development  (e.g.,  ecotourism)  and  integrated  urban–rural  economic 
development.  SMEs  and  agriculture  cooperatives  have  limited  access  to  commercial  funding 
sources, and sustainable green financing mechanisms are not fully established. 
Inadequate  environmental  infrastructure  in  towns  and  villages.  The  ecological 
8. 
environment of Gan River faces many challenges. Point and nonpoint source pollution from urban 
and rural sewage and agricultural activities degrade the water quality, which is currently rated Class 
III.10 In 2019, 53,731 tons of chemical oxygen demand and 4,761 tons of ammonia nitrogen were 
5  More than 70% of the land area is forested, and more than 80% is mountainous. Its altitude is 300–500 meters above 
sea level. 
6  In 2019, Ganzhou was ranked 9th of 11 municipalities (gross domestic product per capita: CNY39,900). 
7   Ganzhou is a historical city with lots of scenic spots and tourist attractions. The tourism sector is growing rapidly and 
now accounts for 4% of its GDP. 
8  Ganzhou had an average concentration of particulate matter less than 2.5 micrometer in diameter of 39 milligram per 
cubic meter (mg/m3) in 2018; that of particulate matter less than 10 micrometer in diameter was 63 mg/m3. 
9  In  2015,  the  average  consumption  of  agricultural  chemicals  was  641.30  kilograms  of  chemical  fertilizers  and 
41.10 kilograms of pesticides per hectare of farmland in Ganzhou, both well above national and provincial averages. 
10 Based  on  the  2019  Ganzhou  Municipal  Environmental  Quality  Annual  Report,  6.8%  of  the  water  quality  at  county 
boundaries  was  not  in  compliance  with  the  Class  III  standard.  The  major  pollutants  are  chemical  oxygen  demand, 
ammonia nitrate, and mercury. 
3 
discharged into water bodies from point pollution sources in Ganzhou. While progress was made in 
urban  wastewater  treatment,  rural  sanitation  coverage  is  still  limited,  and  70%  of  rural  sewage 
remains untreated. Public toilets in townships and rural areas are inadequate, and it is common 
practice to dump solid waste into rivers and water bodies. The sewage treatment facilities and solid 
waste management systems that do exist are unable to meet the water quality and environmental 
requirements of the growing tourism industry. They are also poorly maintained because of a lack of 
government funding and limited community engagement. Rural access to water supply does not 
meet national standards either. 
Water-related  disaster  risks  and  degraded  ecosystems.  Flood  infrastructure  and 
9. 
management systems are inadequate along Gan River, and flood control standards in rural areas 
need upgrading. In 2019, a major flood event in Ganzhou inundated 128,600 hectares of farmland, 
destroyed 472 houses, and caused damages totaling CNY3.38 billion. Continuous and intensive 
precipitation during the rainy season routinely triggers severe flooding in low-lying urban and rural 
areas. Flood control is hampered by insufficient river embankments and inadequate nonstructural 
protection  measures.  Weak  forest  management  undermines  the  forests’  capacity  to  control  and 
attenuate soil erosion and water runoff, and thus impairs the resilience of the riverine ecosystem. 
Ganzhou’s soil erosion area was 7,142.3 square kilometers in 2018 (18.14% of total area), which 
is  above  the  national  average.  Some  wetland  areas  do  not  function  effectively  and  have  no 
productive use.11 
10. 
Green financing mechanism through FIL. The local enterprises in Ganzhou have limited 
access to financial services in green development and rural revitalization. The commercial banks 
and nonbank financial institutions cannot meet the growing financing needs of SMEs, agriculture 
cooperatives  and  eco-friendly  enterprises  in  the  region  due  to  their  limited  operational  and  risk 
management  capabilities.  A  green financing mechanism  adopting  a financial  intermediation loan 
(FIL)  modality  will  involve  cooperation  with  a  local  commercial  bank  that  prioritizes  funding  for 
business  and  activities  that  promote  green  agriculture,  sustainable  forest  management, 
environmental protection, and climate change adaptation and mitigation measures. 
11. 
COVID-19  pandemic.  The  coronavirus  disease  (COVID-19)  pandemic  has  amplified  the 
links between biodiversity, ecosystem degradation, public health, and livelihoods. COVID-19 has 
had a widespread impact, resulting in social and economic disruption, threatening PRC’s urban and 
rural  communities.  The  pandemic  remains  a  risk,  particularly  for  the  country’s  rural  areas.  With 
recognition of the need to prevent the spread of diseases, rural vitalization is key to recovery from 
COVID-19. 
B. 
Impact and Outcome 
12. 
The  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  rural  vitalization  in  the  YREB  realized 
(footnotes 1 and 4). The project will have the following outcome: living environment of rural areas 
along upper reaches of Gan River improved. 
C.

This output is expected to benefit 20,850 individuals, including 44% women. 
14. 
Output 2: Green development and financing mechanisms piloted. The project team will 
install water-saving irrigation systems and promote the reduction of nutrient pollution in agricultural 
production.  Climate  change  mitigation  and  adaptation  will  be  implemented  through  the  green 
financing  mechanism.  The  project  will  encourage  green  development  and  green financing  by  (i) 
piloting a tracing system for organic products; (ii) developing a vegetable demonstration area that 
uses  green  farming technologies;  (iii)  promoting eco-friendly  businesses,  including  village-based 
ecotourism  infrastructure; 13 (iv)  renovating  the  drainage  ditches  in  Chongyi  Hakkas  terrace  to 
showcase green development and agricultural heritage protection; and (v)  providing subloans to 
SMEs  and  agriculture  cooperatives  through  a  financial  intermediary,  Agricultural  Bank  of  China 
(ABC). This output is expected to benefit 101,852 individuals, including 48% women. 
15. 
Output 3: Rural waste and sanitation management improved. The project will improve 
the living environment of residents by solving wastewater, sanitation, and solid waste problems in 
selected  townships  and  administrative  villages;  this  involves  adopting  low-energy,  low-skilled 
treatment  processes  in  rural  wastewater  treatment  plants.  The  project  will  (i)  promote  inclusive 
sanitation  management  across  counties  and  increase  access  to  safely  managed  wastewater 
treatment plants through innovative technologies and service delivery methods; (ii) improve rural 
infrastructure  for  the  treatment  of  domestic  solid  waste  and  raise  public  awareness  of  proper

individuals, including 47% women. 
16. 
Output 4: Water and soil conservation practices improved. The project will introduce 
nature-based solutions to water and soil conservation in Ganzhou. The output consists of (i) river 
rehabilitation  and  flood  prevention  through  structural,  nonstructural,  and  natural  measures; 14 
(ii) wetland  rehabilitation  to  protect  biodiversity  by  (a)  planting  aquatic  and  terrestrial  plants, 
(b) restoring sand quarries, (c) intercepting solid waste, and (d) creating a management platform; 
(iii)  restoration  of  collapsed  bare  slopes  to  strengthen  water  and  soil  conservation;15 (iv)  better 
infrastructure for forest protection; (v) increased agroforestry benefits by expanding the cultivation 
zones for non-wood economic trees; and (vi) reforestation and forest conservation by (a) removing 
dead trees and planting new ones, and (b) increasing pest control and forest fire protection. This 
output is expected to benefit 268,888 individuals, including 52% women. 
17. 
FIL component. The FIL component is planned under the output 2: green development and 
financing mechanisms piloted. It aims to pilot a green financing mechanism by providing credit to 
SMEs  and  agriculture  cooperatives  engaged  in  green  agricultural  development  and  rural 
12 Project Innovation and Knowledge Dissemination (accessible from Appendix 2 of the report and recommendation of 
the President [RRP]). 
13 Ganzhou, a historical city with tourist attractions, generated CNY140.85 billion  in tourism revenues (4% of its gross 
domestic product). 
14 Renovation of drainage ditches, ecological restoration, and revetment rehabilitation (green trail and ecological strips). 
15 Includes building drainage canals, reducing slope gradients, greening grass areas, and restoring terraces.

revitalization. Specifically, the ADB FI loan equivalent to $50 million is expected to leverage $50 
million  in  counterpart  funding  from  the  ABC,  which  will  significantly  expand  the  project’s  green 
finance and development impact. The selection of ABC as the project financial intermediary (PFI) 
is based on the entity’s: (i) business focus on agricultural and rural development; (ii) extensive local 
network of farmers and farms; (iii) overall financial strength, being one of the world’s major banks; 
(iv)  sound  governance  (e.g.,  a  listed  company  in  Shanghai  and  Hong  Kong);  (v)  substantive  in-
house expertise in financing the agriculture sector; and (vi) willingness to engage with GMG on the 
project.

The  loan  agreements  will  be  signed  between  ADB  and  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF), 
PRC.  The MOF  will  relend the  proceeds to  Jiangxi  Provincial Government  (JPG)  on the  same 
terms and conditions. JPG will onlend the proceeds to the GMG. The GMG will then lend to the 
implementing agencies through the finance bureaus at the district or county-level (i) for the direct 
investment  loan  component  and  (ii)  to  the  PFI  —  Agricultural  Bank  of  China  (ABC)—  for  the 
financial intermediation loan component. 
20. 
Upon  effectiveness  of  the  loan,  withdrawal  applications  will  be  initiated  from  the 
city/district/county-level Bureau of Finance (BOF) and PFI based on ADB’s share of the estimated 
expenditures  for  the  next  six  months  and  send  to  Jiangxi  Provincial  Department  of  Finance 
(JPDOF) through Ganzhou Municipal BOF. The loan proceeds disbursement and fund flow are 
described in greater detail in Section I. 
21. 
GMG,  as  the  executing  agency,  has  established  a  project  leading  group  and  has 
appointed  the  Ganzhou  Environmental  Protection  Center  (GEPC)  as  the  project  management 
office  (PMO)  at  municipal  level. 16  The  participating  district  and  county  governments,  as 
implementing agencies, will implement the project through their respective district- or county-level 
PMOs under the PMO’s leadership. For the green financing component under output 2, Ganzhou 
Branch of ABC will be the implementing agency. The detailed implementation arrangement and 
procedures for FIL are elaborated in the following section.

counterpart  funds  from  the  PFI  (i.e.,  ABC)  will  support  increased  lending  to  green  agriculture 
development and rural revitalization in Ganzhou. The borrowers of the FIL from ABC will include 
new  business  entities,  agriculture  or  forestry-related  SMEs,  agriculture cooperatives  and other 
eco-friendly  enterprises in the  areas of rural  revitalization,  green agriculture development,  and 
climate change adaptation/mitigation that meet ADB’s eligibility criteria. 
23.

ADB will enter into a loan agreement with the PRC, acting through the MOF; MOF 
will relend the ADB loan to JPG; JPG will onlend the ADB loan to GMG; IAs will 
enter an onlending agreement with ABC, and all the onlending will be arranged 
on the same terms as the loan from ADB to the PRC. 
ABC will establish a separate account (separate ledgers for counties/districts) 
for the operation of FIL, which will be in Chinese Yuan (CNY).

compliance  to  the  ESMS,  based  on  its  own  potential  client  pool  and  candidate 
projects list provided by the government. 
ABC  submits  the  first  three  subprojects  to  ADB  for  financial,  technical,  and 
safeguard  clearance  irrespective  of  the  subproject  size  and  must  not  be 
retroactively financed. ADB will also very that ABC has conducted the subproject 
environmental and social safeguard reviews in compliance with the project ESMS. 
Upon successful completion of the review by ADB, the ABC will submit withdrawal 
application to ADB via counties/districts level PMO, counties/districts level Finance 
Bureau, GEPC, Ganzhou BOF, and Jiangxi DOF in turn. 
ADB will then disburse the funds through the advance account to PFI. 
ABC disburses the individual subloans to the subborrowers. 
29. 
In  any  unlikely  event  that  the  subproject  is  reviewed  and  deemed  ineligible  for  ADB 
financing, ABC must return such amount of unqualified subprojects to the advance account. ABC 
will bear the foreign exchange rate risk, if any. 
18 
ABC Counterpart Financing. ABC will provide $50 million equivalent counterpart finance 
30. 
to double the ADB finance support. The counterpart financing may be blended with the ADB funds 
to  finance  the  same  Qualified  Subprojects,  or  ABC  may  make  subloans  to  other  qualified 
subborowers or enterprises to finance other qualified subprojects. A loan made by ABC will not 
count toward fulfillment of this counterpart finance requirement unless it qualifies as a subloan to 
an  eligible  subborrower  for  eligible  subproject,  as  all  such terms  are  defined  in  the  ADB  Loan 
Agreement. 
Revolving Funds. ABC will recycle the ADB funds both before and after the closing date 
31. 
of the Loan until the moneys are repaid to ADB. ABC shall commit to this condition of proper use 
of  ADB  funds.  ABC  will  continue  maintaining  separate  ledgers  to  monitor  the  funds  and  the 
subprojects. 
IV. 
COSTS AND FINANCING 
The project is estimated to cost €387.10 million ($453.91 million).17 The project investment 
32. 
costs include (i) goods, works, and consulting and training services to improve the technical and 
management capabilities of the local authorities; (ii) a green financing component to invest in local 
companies  implementing  subprojects  supporting  the  green  agenda  of  Ganzhou  Municipality 
Government; and (iii) project management. 
33. 
Ganzhou  government  has  requested  a  regular  loan  of  €170.56  million  ($200  million 
equivalent) from ADB’s ordinary capital resources to help finance the project. The ADB loan will 
have a 25-year term, including a grace period of six years; an annual interest rate determined in 
accordance  with  ADB’s  London  interbank  offered  rate  LIBOR-based  lending  facility;  a 
commitment charge of 0.15% per year, such charge shall accrue on the full amount of the Loan 
(less amounts withdrawn from time to time), and such other terms and conditions set forth in the 
loan and project agreements. Based on the straight-line repayment method, the average maturity 
is  15.75  years,  and  the  maturity  premium  payable  to  ADB  is  0.30%  per  year.  A  project  loan 
modality combined with FIL (for the green financing mechanism under output 2) will be used. The 
project loan component and the FIL component will have the same financial terms and conditions. 
The  government  through  Jiangxi  Provincial  Government  will  make  the  loan  proceeds 
34. 
available to GMG and GMG will make a portion of the proceeds of the loan to the implementing 
agencies on the same terms and conditions as apply to the loan. GMG and project implementing 
agencies will bear the foreign exchange and interest rate variation risk relating to the respective 
portion of the loan proceeds. 
35. 
The ADB loan will finance 44.0% of the total project costs, including expenditures relating 
to civil works, goods, and consulting services, trainings, financial charges during implementation 
for eligible ADB-financed expenditures including the green financing component. The municipal 
government  and  PFI  will  contribute  44.5%  and  11.5%  of  the  total  project  costs,  including 
contingencies, respectively. 
A. 
Cost Estimates Preparation and Revisions 
36. 
Preparation.  The  cost  estimates  were  prepared  jointly  by  the  design  institute,  GEPC, 
district and county government agencies, and ADB, with support from the transaction technical 
assistance  (TA)  consultants.  The  sources  and  basis  of  cost  estimates  were  reviewed  during 
17 €0.8528 = $1.00 as of 23 September 2021. 
19 
project  preparation  and  confirmed  by  related  parties.  The  process  was  facilitated  by  a  model 
prepared in Excel software which enables easy updating or revision, if necessary. 
37. 
Revision. Revision of cost estimates will be conducted, when deemed necessary, during 
implementation. The GEPC will be responsible in proposing and drafting the revision, which will 
be subject to ADB’s approval. 
B. 
Key Assumptions

The loan agreements will be signed between ADB and the PRC through the Ministry of 
Finance (MOF). MOF is the borrower of the ADB loan for financing the project. MOF will relend 
the  loan  to  Jiangxi  Provincial  Department  of  Finance  (JPDOF)  of  the  Jiangxi  Provincial 
Government  on  the  same  terms  and  conditions,  which  will  then  onlend  the  loan  to  Ganzhou 
Municipal Bureau of Finance (GMBOF). The municipal finance bureau will then lend a portion of 
the  loan  to  the  IAs  through  the  finance  bureaus  at  the  district  or  county-level  for  the  direct 
26 
investment  loan  component  and  to  the  intermediary  bank  for  the  financial  intermediation  loan 
component. 
40. 
 ADB loan proceeds will go to the advance account at the Jiangxi Provincial Department 
of  Finance (JPDOF).  The  JPDOF will then  transfer the funds  to Ganzhou Municipal  Bureau  of 
Finance. The loan proceeds will then be split and sent to (i) corresponding district/county BOFs 
for payments to be made to contractors by district/county PMOs; (ii) contractors for procurements 
for subprojects at municipal level that are directly administered by GEPC; and (iii) ABC (Ganzhou 
Branch)  for  contribution  to  the  FIL  component.  Repayments  funds  will  flow  in  the  opposite 
direction from the district/county BOFs and ABC (Ganzhou Branch), and Ganzhou Municipal BOF, 
back to ADB through the Jiangxi Provincial DOF.

advance account denominated in Euro to receive loan proceeds from ADB.  
42. 
The FIL will be treated as a new loan product within ABC’s internal system, and subject to 
the  regular  approval,  disbursement,  monitoring,  and  risk  control  processes  typical  to  well-
established  commercial  banks.  The  entire  loan  initiation,  processing,  approval,  disbursement, 
repaying,  monitoring,  risk  control,  and  evaluation  process  will  take  place  via  a  custom-tailored 
computerized  network  system,  which  is  universally  used  by  ABC  and  monitored  by  the  China

FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT 
A. 
Financial Management Assessment 
The  financial  management  assessment  (FMA)  of  the  executing  agency  (EA),  the 
43. 
implementing agencies (IAs) and the financial performance appraisal of the financial intermediary 
for implementing the FIL have been carried out in accordance with the Asian Development Bank 
(ADB)  Financial  Management  Technical  Guidance  Note  (2015),  Financial  Management 
Assessment and the ADB Financial Due Diligence for Financial Intermediaries (2018).18 This FMA 
is also based on (i) reviews of the country system of the People’s Republic of China (the PRC) 
through the updated Country Governance Risk Assessment (CGRA); (ii) ABC Annual Reports, 
available public  information,  and  internal  documents  and  interviews  with ABC  (Ganzhou) staff, 
(iii) questionnaire to the public FMA (Appendix 1); and (iv) other relevant documentation including 
integrity and anti-money laundering due diligence. 
44. 
 The  FMA  considered  the  financial  management  capacity  of  the  Ganzhou  Municipal 
Government (GMG) as the project executing agency (EA), and the nine county governments as 
the  implementing  agencies  (IAs)  for  the  investment  loan  component.  The  GMG  has  selected 
Ganzhou  Ecological  Protection  Center  for  Mountains,  Water,  Forests,  Fields,  and  Lakes 
(Ganzhou Ecological Protection Center, GEPC) as the PMO at city level. The Chongyi County 
Development & Reform Commission (DRC), Ningdu County DRC, Shangyou County DRC, Dayu 
County  DRC,  Huichang  County  DRC,  Nankang  District  Ecological  Protection  Center,  Yudu 
County DRC, Shicheng County DRC, and Xingguo County DRC are the relevant PMOs at the 
county/district level. 
45. 
The identified key financial management risks include: 
(i) 
Lack  of  clarity  in  assigning  of  roles  and responsibilities  across  as  well  as  within 
individual  government  agencies  in  terms  of  approval,  financial  management, 
procurement, and records maintenance; 
Uncertainty in availability and adequacy of counterpart funds; 
(ii) 
(iii)  Weak  financial  management  systems  which  do  not  meet  national  and  ADB 
requirements for public funding management and regulatory compliance; 
Lack of experience with ADB project implementation and lack of awareness of ADB 
guidelines including disbursement procedures and loan proceeds use; and 
(v)  Weak accounting systems and inadequate charts of accounts for matching costs 
(iv) 
to the projects/subprojects costs categories and activities. 
46. 
It is concluded that the overall pre-mitigation financial management risk of the executing 
agency and implementing agencies is high. Both advance fund and statement of expenditures 
(SOE) procedures is proposed. Executing agencies and implementing agencies’ overall financial 
management capacity, including the capacity of managing advance fund and SOE procedures, 
needs  to  be  enhanced.  The  MOF,  GMG,  and  the  county/district  governments  have  agreed  to 
implement an action plan as key measures to address the deficiencies. 
47. 
FMA  Results  for  FI.  Financial  due  diligence  was  conducted  on  ABC  as  the  financial 
intermediary  of  the  FI  loan  covering,  among  others,  areas  of  corporate  governance  and  risk 
management.  The  systems  of  financial  accounting,  assets  management  (loan  books  and 
18 ADB. 2015. Financial Management Technical Guidance Note. Manila; and ADB. 2018. Financial Due Diligence for 
Financial Intermediaries. Manila. 
29 
nonperforming  assets),  credit  management,  liquidity  and  treasury  management,  financial 
reporting, internal controls, and  internal and external audits are adequate for its  extensive and 
diversified banking operations. The financial reporting and regulatory requirements of ABC follows 
more stringent requirements as one of PRC’s “big four banks” and a global systemically important 
bank (G-SIB). ABC is required to hold higher capital buffers by national authorities in accordance 
with  international  standards;  meet  the  total  loss-absorbing  capacity  standard,  alongside  the 
regulatory  capital  requirements  set  out  in  the  Basel  III  framework,  and  is  subject  to  higher 
supervisory  expectations  from  supervisory  bodies  for  risk  management  functions,  risk  data 
aggregation capabilities, risk governance and internal controls. During the project implementation, 
ABC is committed to maintain required prudential norms including on (i) minimum capital ratios, 
(ii) liquidity, (iii) total loss-absorbing capacity, and (iv) complies with the relevant requirements of 
the  Guidelines  for  the  Disclosure  of  Indicators  for  Assessing  Global  Systematic  Importance  of 
Commercial  Banks  promulgated  by  the  China  Banking  and Insurance Regulatory  Commission 
and the Instructions for G-SIB Assessment Exercise issued by the Basel Committee on Banking 
Supervision.  While  ABC  has  international  operations  outside  of  the  PRC,  ABC  has  not 
implemented  international  development  assistance  projects  from  ADB  and  other  development 
partners and are not familiar with ADB’s reporting requirements, project financial management 
procedures, project monitoring, and audit requirements. During implementation, trainings will be 
provided  to  all  IAs,  including  ABC  to  ensure  understanding  and  compliance  to  ADB  reporting 
requirements (if any) related to audit, safeguards, and procurement. Nevertheless, pre-mitigation 
financial  management  and  control  risks  are  low  given  the  adequate  financial  management 
capacity of ABC to carry out the FI loan.

Inherent  risk  is  the  susceptibility  of the  project financial  management  system  to  factors 
arising from the environment in which it operates, such as country rules and regulations and entity 
working environment. Table 13 provides summary of inherent risk assessment.

application should include a statement from the FI and PMO that all listed subloans satisfy the 
terms and conditions in the relending agreements between the government and ABC (Ganzhou 
Branch). 
55. 
Advance  fund  procedure.  Advance  fund  procedure  in  Euro  is  permitted  under  the 
project. The advance account shall be used exclusively for ADB’s share of eligible expenditures. 
An advance account in Euro will be set up for the project by JPDOF in a commercial bank. JPDOF 
shall  be  responsible  for  the  proper  use  of  advance  account  and  will  be  responsible  for  the 
management, monitoring, and reconciliation of the advance account. 
56. 
The total outstanding advance to the advance account should not exceed the estimate of 
ADB’s  share  of  expenditures  to  be  paid  through  the  advance  account  for  the  forthcoming  six 
months. JPDOF, on behalf of JPG, may request for initial and additional advances to the advance 
account based on an Estimate of Expenditure Sheet21 setting out the estimated expenditures to 
be financed through the account(s) for the forthcoming six months. Supporting documents should 
be  submitted  to  ADB  or  retained  by  GMG  or  district/county  governments  and  ABC  (Ganzhou 
Branch) in accordance with ADB’s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time 
to time) when liquidating or replenishing the advance account. The advance account will be for 
the overall project including the implementation of FIL. The executing agency and implementing 
agencies will be responsible for the disbursement arrangement for each of the subprojects and 
lending. 
57. 
Direct payment procedure. Direct payment may also be made to the bank account of 
the  contractors,  suppliers  and  consultants,  as  confirmed  by  GMG  and  project  county 
governments.

amended from time to time).  
35 
Statement of expenditure procedure.22 The statement of expenditure (SOE) procedure 
58. 
may be used for reimbursement of eligible expenditures or liquidation of advances to the advance 
account. Due to the nature of the FIL, in which many small subprojects will be funded, the SOE 
for  the  FIL  procedure  is  necessary  to  reduce  ADB  administrative  burden.  After  eligible 
expenditures are incurred and paid from the advance account, the BOFs/ABC (Ganzhou Branch) 
requests liquidation of the advance account by submitting an SOE for the direct investment loan 
or the FIL in accordance with ADB’s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time 
to  time).  The  withdrawal  application  should  include  a  statement  from  BOFs/ABC  (Ganzhou 
Branch)  that  all  listed  lending  satisfies  the  terms  and  conditions  specified  in  the  relending 
agreements among the DOF, BOFs, and the financial intermediary. Supporting documents and 
records for the expenditures claimed under the SOE will be maintained and made readily available 
for review by ADB's disbursement and review missions, upon ADB's request for submission of 
supporting documents on a sampling basis, and for project-level audits.23 This enables ADB to 
satisfy itself on the quality of the financial intermediary’s appraisal of subprojects. 
59.  Where  ADB  subsequently  finds  any  payment  made  under  the  SOE  procedure  to  be 
insufficiently  supported  or  ineligible  for  ADB  financing,  ADB  may  offset  the  amount  of  the 
unjustified  or  ineligible payment  against  subsequent  withdrawals  for reimbursement  of  request 
the borrower to refund the same amount to the loan account, or to the advance account  if the 
payment  was  made  from  the  advance  account.  Reimbursement  and  liquidation  of  individual 
payments more than the SOE ceiling shall be supported by full documentation when submitting 
the withdrawal application to ADB. 
60. 
Other Disbursement Matters. Before the submission of the first withdrawal application, 
the Ministry of Finance shall submit to ADB sufficient evidence of the authority of the person(s) 
who  will  sign  the  withdrawal  applications  on  behalf  of  the  government,  together  with  the 
authenticated specimen signatures of each authorized person. The minimum value per withdrawal 
application  is  stipulated  in the  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook (2017,  as amended from  time to 
time). Individual payments below such amount should be paid (i) by the executing agency and 
subsequently claimed to ADB through reimbursement, or (ii) through the advance fund procedure, 
unless otherwise accepted by ADB. The borrower should ensure sufficient category and contract 
balances before requesting disbursements. Use of ADB’s Client Portal for Disbursements (CPD) 
system is encouraged for submission of WAs to ADB.24 
61. 
Conditions for withdrawals for project loan. To secure timely and adequate provision 
of counterpart funding, the withdrawal of ADB funds will be conditioned on the EA’s and IAs’ timely 
and  successful  ring-fence  of  fiscal  budget  of  the  corresponding  amounts  for  the  project 
implementation years.  
62. 
Conditions for withdrawals for FIL. The withdrawal shall not be made until, (i) ABC has 
provided  counterpart  or  match-up  funds,  (ii)  screen  and  approve  the  qualified  recipient  in 
compliance  with  the  foregoing  requirements,  (iii)  the  designated  revolving  account  has  been 
opened at the ABC, and (iv) the ESMS for the project has been endorsed and adopted by the 
ABC and has retained appropriately qualified and experienced staff to manage implementation of 
the ESMS. 
22 SOE forms are available in Appendix 7B and 7D of ADB’s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from 
time to time). 
23 Checklist  for  SOE  procedures  and  format  are  available  at  relevant  sections  of  the  ADB’s  Loan  Disbursement 
Handbook 
24 The CPD facilitates online submission of WA to ADB, resulting in faster disbursement.  The forms to be completed 
by the Borrower are available online at https://www.adb.org/documents/client-portal-disbursements-guide.

2. 
Disbursement Arrangements for Counterpart Fund 
is 
to  be  reviewed  by 
the  city  government  and  approved  by 
63. 
The PMOs at city/district/county levels will be responsible for (i) preparing disbursement 
projections, and (ii) requesting budgetary allocations for counterpart funds in annual government 
budgets,  which 
the 
municipal/district/county  government  and  approved  by  the  municipal/district/county  people’s 
congresses.  Based  on  actual  incurrence  of  costs,  the  GEPC  and the  district/county  PMOs  will 
initiate disbursement requests to their relevant finance bureaus. Upon confirmation of the eligibility 
of the payments, the finance bureaus will disburse directly to the contractors. Currently the EA 
and the IAs need to confirm the commitment on counterpart funding provision, as well as issue 
official  statements  to  assure  that  the  above-stated  process  will  be  honored.  The  counterpart 
funding  for  FIL  is  readily  available  for  ABC.  Upon  confirmation  of  the  project,  ABC  (Ganzhou 
Branch) will be able to allocate the counterpart funding as determined in the project documents. 
C. 
Accounting 
64. 
The EA and IAs will maintain, or cause to be maintained, separate books and records by 
funding source for all expenditures incurred on the project, following the accrual-based accounting 
system  in  accordance  with  the  PRC  national  accounting  standards,  and  the  policies  and 
procedures for government fiscal revenues and expenditures issued by PRC Ministry of Finance. 
These accounting policies and procedures are also used to record and report the receipts and 
payments of fiscal revenues and expenditures through computerized systems with the ability to 
generate  financial  statements.  The  GMG  shall  ensure  that  project  financial  statements  are 
prepared by implementing agencies in accordance with the government's accounting laws and 
regulations which are consistent with international accounting principles and practices. 
65. 
ABC  will  prepare  consolidated  statement  of  utilization  of  funds  (SUF),  in  lieu  of  project 
financial statements, in accordance with the government’s accounting laws and regulations which 
are consistent with international accounting principles and practices. In this case, audited SUF 
will  indicate:  (i)  accounts  opening  balances,  (ii)  details  of  subloans,  (iii)  closing  balances,  (iv) 
comparative figures for prior year, and (v) cumulative amounts to date. In addition, SUF sill include 
withdrawal application reconciliation between amounts reported and disbursements appearing in 
the Loan Financial Information (LFIS) of ADB. LFIS can be accessed online and ADB will provide 
LFIS access to project staff on request. Sample SUF can be obtained from the ADB project officer 
upon request. 
D. 
Auditing and Public Disclosure 
1. 
General 
66. 
The GMG will cause the detailed project financial statements prepared by GEPC and the 
district/county PMOs to be audited to be audited in accordance with equivalent national standards 
and by an independent auditor both acceptable to ADB. The audited project financial statements 
together with the auditor’s opinion will be collected from the city/district/counties and presented in 
the English language to ADB within 6 months from the end of the fiscal year by the GEPC. 
67. 
For entities preparing independent entity financial statements, the audited entity financial 
statements,  together  with  the  auditor’s  report  and  management  letter,  will  be  submitted  in  the 
English language to ADB within six months from the end of the fiscal year to which they relate. 
37 
The audit report for the project financial statements will include a management letter and 
68. 
auditor’s opinions, which cover (i) whether the project financial statements present an accurate 
and fair view or are presented fairly, in all material respects, in accordance with the applicable 
financial reporting standards; (ii) whether the proceeds of the loan were used only for the purpose 
of  the  project;  and  (iii)  whether  the  borrower  or  executing  agency  was  in  compliance  with  the 
financial covenants contained in the legal agreements (where applicable). 
69. 
Compliance with financial reporting and auditing requirements will be monitored by review 
missions and during normal program supervision, and followed up regularly with all concerned, 
including the external auditor. 
70. 
The government, GMG, and the implementing agencies have been made aware of ADB’s 
approach to delayed submission, and the requirements for satisfactory and acceptable quality of 
the  audited  project  financial  statements.25 ADB  reserves  the  right  to  require  a  change  in  the 
auditor (in a manner consistent with the constitution of the borrower), or for additional support to 
be provided to the auditor, if the audits required are not conducted in a manner satisfactory to 
ADB,  or  if  the  audits  are  substantially  delayed.  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  verify  the  project's 
financial accounts to confirm that the share of ADB’s financing is used in accordance with ADB’s 
policies and procedures. 
Public disclosure of the audited project financial statements, including the auditor’s opinion 
71. 
on the project financial statements, will be guided by ADB’s Access to Information Policy 2018.26 
After the review, ADB will disclose the audited project financial statements and the opinion of the 
auditors on the project financial statements no later than 14 days of ADB’s confirmation of their 
acceptability  by  posting  them  on  ADB’s  website.  The  management  letter,  additional  auditor’s 
opinions, and audited entity financial statements will not be disclosed.27

For the FIL 
72. 
ABC shall ensure that the respective equivalent of: (i) $50 million ADB financing; and (ii) 
$50 million ABC’s counterpart financing is audited. For the ADB-financed component, the audited 
SUF  could  be  submitted.  ABC  will  cause  the  annual  consolidated  SUF  to  be  audited  by  a 
reputable auditing firm in, in accordance with auditing standards acceptable to ADB. The audited 
SUF  will  be  accompanied  by  adequate  explanatory  notes  which  will  include  the  basis  of 
preparation,  reporting  currencies,  undrawn  amount,  and  details  of  subloans  such  as  ADB 
approvals, amounts committed, disbursement up to the previous year, disbursement during the 
current reporting period, cumulative disbursement, undisbursed commitments, percentage of loan 
utilized  etc.  The  SUF  will  include  a  management  letter  (which  sets  out  the  deficiencies  in  the 
25 ADB’s approach and procedures regarding delayed submission of audited project financial statements:  
(i)  When audited project financial statements are not received by the due date, ADB will write to the executing 
agency advising that (a) the audit documents are overdue; and (b) if they are not received within the next 6 
months, requests for new contract awards and disbursement such as new replenishment of advance account, 
processing of new reimbursement, and issuance of new commitment letters will not be processed. 
(ii)  When  audited  project  financial  statements  are  not  received  within  6  months  after  the  due  date,  ADB  will 
withhold processing of requests for new contract awards and disbursement such as new replenishment of 
advance account, processing of new reimbursement, and issuance of new commitment letters. ADB will (a) 
inform the executing agency of ADB’s actions; and (b) advise that the loan may be suspended if the audit 
documents are not received within the next 6 months. 
(iii)  When audited project financial statements are not received within 12 months after the due date, ADB may 
suspend the loan.

performance  based  technical  specifications  should  be  considered  for  the  rural  water  and 
wastewater system packages to ensure least variations for contract implementation. Request for 
quotations  (RFQ)  is  proposed  for  the  procurement  of  small-size  and  simple  civil  works,  goods 
supply,  and  nonconsulting  services.  Quality  and  cost-based  selection  (QCBS)  through 
internationally  advertised  OCB  is  adopted  for  complex  consultancy  services.  Consultants’ 
qualification selection (CQS) is adopted for small-size and simple consultancy services. Start-up 
individual consultants will be engaged by individual consultant selection (ICS) method. 
Use of e-procurement tools. Use of the local e-procurement platform - Jiangxi Provincial 
80. 
Public Procurement System Platform will be limited to the publication of procurement notices and 
results such as IFBs, contract award information etc. (for e-publication only) unless specifically 
approved by ADB for its full use (for e-bidding). Procurement notices and results shall be posted 
as  well  at  the  national  e-procurement  platform  -  China  Tendering  and  Bidding  Public  Service 
Platform (http://cebpubservice.com/), simultaneously with the posting on the local platform. ADB’s 
online system - Consultant Management System (CMS) will be used for advertising consulting 
services contracts except for selection of national individual consultants. 
81. 
ADB Review. Prior review is applied to the first contract of works and goods with similar 
nature undertaken by each IA and all consulting service contracts. Other civil works and goods 
supply  contracts  will  be  subject  to  post  review  (sampling)  and  post  procurement  audits.  The 
following procedure should be followed: (i) ADB’s review is not required for invitation for bids and 
bidding document however the first bidding document reviewed and confirmed by ADB if relevant 
should  be  used  as  a  model  without  substantial  modification;  (ii)  procurement  process  will  be 
conducted without ADB’s prior approval; and (iii) only a copy of the signed contract needs to be 
submitted to ADB for records. PMOs will maintain all documents related to the procurement of 
these contracts (procurement file) for ADB post reviews and other supervision process including 
compliant  handling,  including  but  not  limited  to:  invitation  for  bids,  bidding  documents  and 
amendments  (if  any),  bid  evaluation  reports,  bids  submitted  by  the  bidders,  minutes/records, 
contract  award  letters  and  signed  contracts  etc.  Post  review  will  be  conducted  on  a  sampling 
basis by ADB annual review mission and/or by third party authorized by the ADB as a procurement 
audit. 
An 18-month procurement plan indicating threshold and review procedures, goods, works, 
82. 
and consulting service contract packages and national competitive bidding guidelines is in Section 
D. 
All consultants will be recruited according to ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended 
83. 
from time to time) and Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time 
to time) 29 The terms of reference for all consulting services are detailed in Section D. 
An estimated 558 person-months (81 international, 477 national) of consulting services 
84. 
are  required  to  (i)  facilitate  project  management  and  implementation,  (ii)  strengthen  the 
institutional  and  operational  capacity  of  the  executing  agency,  and  (iii)  conduct  studies  and 
research  on the topics  related  to the  project  implementation.  Consulting firms  will  be  engaged 
using the quality- and cost-based selection (QCBS) method with a standard quality–cost ratio of 
90:10 or consultants' qualifications selection method.

Procurement under FIL 
85. 
ADB expects that the procurement is undertaken by the respective loan beneficiaries in 
accordance with established private sector or commercial practices that ensure value for money, 
and  which  are  acceptable  to  ADB.  To  provide  guidance  to  ABC  to  monitor  the  procurement 
activities undertaken  by qualified  enterprises,  a project-specific  procurement  manual  has  been 
prepared and included in Appendix 5.

Methods, Review and Procurement Plan 
Except as ADB may otherwise agree, the following process shall apply to procurement of

goods, works, nonconsulting services, and consulting services: 
Procurement of Goods, Works, and Nonconsulting Services 
Method 
Open competitive bidding 
advertised nationally 
Comments 
The procurement assessment examined potential for attracting 
enough qualified bidders to ensure contract is delivered on time, 
to requisite quality and exhibit value for money. It was concluded 
that no works and goods contracts would require international 
advertising to attract enough qualified bidders. Works and goods 
contracts can therefore be advertised nationally following OCB 
procedures.

SAFEGUARDS 
Institutional arrangements for the project environmental safeguards. The project is 
89. 
classified  by  ADB  as  Category  B  for  environment.  The  project  environmental  safeguard 
assessments and documents comprise: (i) initial environmental examination (IEE) including an 
environmental management plan (EMP). The IEE and EMP cover all project components except 
one,  a  financial  intermediation  loan  (under  output  2),  which  will  be  implemented  by  Ganzhou 
Branch of Agricultural Bank of China (ABC); and (ii) an environmental and social management 
system (ESMS), for safeguard management for the financial intermediation loan (FIL). The IEE, 
EMP  and  ESMS  have  been  prepared  in  compliance  with  ADB’s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement 
(2009).  For  all  project  matters  relating  to  environmental  safeguards,  the  IEE,  EMP  and  ESMS 
form the basis of the official loan agreement between ADB and the executing agency. 
90. 
Content  of  the  EMP.  The  EMP  (provided  in  Appendix  1  of  the  IEE)  describes  (i)  the 
project environmental safeguard objectives; (ii) roles and responsibilities for EMP implementation, 
(iii) mitigation measures; (iv) inspection, monitoring, and reporting arrangements; (v) training and 
institutional  strengthening;  (vi)  a  project-specific  grievance  redress  mechanism;  (vii)  public 
consultation during project implementation; and (viii) a feedback and adjustment mechanism. The 
EMP  identifies  specific  roles  and  responsibilities  for  all  agencies  that  will  be  involved  in  EMP 
implementation, 
implementing  agencies,  contractors,  construction 
supervision companies, and operators of project facilities. The mitigation measures are tailored 
to the project-specific conditions and risks identified in the IEE. The scope and content of the EMP 
comply  with  ADB’s  SPS  for  environmental  safeguards  and  the  PRC’s  environmental  laws  and 
regulations. All project agencies are required to comply with the EMP. 
the  GMG, 
including 
91. 
EMP implementation. The EMP will be implemented in all phases of the project: design, 
pre-construction, construction, and operation. The GMG will be responsible for ensuring that the 
project will be designed, constructed, decommissioned, and operated in accordance with (i) the 
national and local government environmental, health, and safety laws, regulations, procedures, 
and guidelines; (ii) the SPS, and (iii) the IEE including the EMP. The executing agency, through 
the PMO, holds final responsibility for implementation of and compliance with the EMP. 
92. 
For  finalization  of  the  preliminary  engineering  designs,  and  preparation  of  the  detailed 
engineering  designs  for  the  project,  the  PMO  will  forward  the  EMP  to  the  engineering  and 
environmental  design  institutes.  The  PMO  and  implementing  agency  environment  officers  and 
start-up  environment  safeguard  specialist  will  work  with  the  design  institutes  to  ensure  that 
safeguard  risks  identified  in  the  EMP  are  considered  in  the  detailed  designs  and  avoided, 
minimized, or mitigated. The EMP will be updated at the end of the detailed design, as needed. 
To ensure that bidders will respond to the EMPs provisions, the PMO and implementing agencies 
will  prepare  and  provide  the  following  specification  clauses  for  incorporation  into  the  bidding 
documents: (i) a list of environmental management requirements to be budgeted by the bidders 
in  their  proposals;  (ii)  environmental  clauses  for  contractual  terms  and  conditions;  and  (iii) 
domestic EIAs, and the project IEE including updated EMP for compliance. All tenders involving 
civil  works  will  be  required  to  include  and  fully  address  the  EMP  requirements,  especially  the 
mitigation and monitoring measures. 
Personnel. The EMP will be coordinated by the following personnel: (i) one full-time and 
93. 
qualified  PMO  environment  officer,  who  will  be  appointed  by  the  GMG.  The  officer  will  be 
responsible  for  overall  coordination  of  the  EMP;  (ii)  nine  full-time  implementing  agency 
50 
environment officers (one per project county or district), who will be appointed by the county and 
district implementing agencies. These officers will lead the daily coordination of the EMP at the 
site  level  and  will  coordinate  closely  with  the  PMO  environment  officer.  The  PMO  and 
implementing  agency  environment  officers  will  be  supported  in  their  roles  by  environmental 
safeguard specialists engaged under the loan consulting services, as follows: (i) an environmental 
safeguard specialist as part of the start-up consulting services, to provide interim support to the 
PMO  before  the  loan  implementation  consultants  are  recruited;  and (ii)  a  loan  implementation 
environment  consultant  (LIEC),  as  part  of  the  loan  consulting  services.  These  consultants  will 
support the PMO and implementing agency environment officers to establish and implement the 
EMP, including to: assess whether the detailed engineering designs are consistent with the scope 
of  the  preliminary  designs  and  EMP  or  whether  new  safeguard  assessments  are  required; 
integrate the EMP within the project bidding documents; visit work sites and liaise with contractors 
and  construction  supervision  companies;  and,  support  the  preparation  of  safeguard  progress 
reports. Terms of reference for all environment safeguard positions for the project are provided in 
the Appendix 1 of the EMP. 
Capacity building. The implementing agencies have no previous experience with ADB-
94. 
funded  projects  or  safeguard  requirements.  To  ensure  effective  implementation  of  the  EMP,  a 
capacity  building  program  is  included  in  the  EMP  for  training  of  project  agencies  in  EMP 
implementation,  mitigation  measures,  supervision,  monitoring,  reporting,  and  the  grievance 
redress mechanism. Training will be provided by the loan consultants for safeguards and other 
specialists in the loan consulting teams. Trainees will include the staff of the PMO, implementing 
agencies, contractors, and construction supervision companies. 
Procedures  for  feedback  and  adjustment  of  the  EMP,  including  in  the  event  of 
95. 
noncompliance.  Based  on  site  inspections  and  monitoring  reports,  the  PMO  shall  decide,  in 
consultation  with  the  LIEC,  whether  (i)  further  mitigation  measures  are  required  as  corrective 
actions,  or  (ii)  improvements  are  required  for  environmental  management  practices.  The 
effectiveness  of  mitigation  measures  and  monitoring  plans  will  be  evaluated  by  a  feedback 
reporting system. Adjustment to the EMP will be made, if necessary. The PMO and implementing 
agency environment officers, start-up environment safeguard specialist, and LIEC will play critical 
roles in the feedback and adjustment mechanism. If during inspection and monitoring, substantial 
deviation  from  the  EMP  is  observed,  or  any  changes  are  made  to the  project  that  may  cause 
substantial adverse environmental impacts or increase the number of affected people, then the 
PMO will immediately consult with ADB and form an environmental assessment team to conduct 
additional environmental assessment. If necessary, further public consultation will be undertaken. 
A  new  or  updated  domestic  environmental  assessment,  and  IEE  (including  an  EMP)  will  be 
prepared and submitted to ADB for review, appraisal, and public disclosure. The revised EMP will 
be passed to the contractors, construction supervision companies, and operators of the project 
facilities, for implementation. 
96. 
Environmental  assurances.  Project-specific  environmental  safeguard  conditions  are 
included  in  the  loan  and  project  agreements  and  include  the  need  for  all  project  agencies  to 
comply with the EMP. 
97. 
Institutional  arrangements  for  FIL  environmental  safeguards.  In  compliance  with 
ADB’s SPS (2009), environmental and social safeguards for all activities supported under FIL will 
be  subject  to  an  ESMS.  The  Ganzhou  Branch  of  Agricultural  Bank  of  China  (ABC)  is  the 
implementing agency for FIL and will be responsible for establishment and implementation of the 
ESMS.  An  advanced  draft  ESMS  template  has  been  prepared  and  is  publicly  available  as  a 
separate linked document to the ADB report and recommendations of the President to the Board 
51 
of Directors. This will form the basis for the final draft ESMS document to be prepared by ABC. 
The final draft ESMS will be subject to review and endorsement by the GMG and ADB. The steps 
for ESMS establishment and implementation are summarized in Section D below. 
B. 
Land Acquisition and Involuntary Resettlement 
98. 
Category  and  impacts.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  B  for  involuntary 
resettlement. The project will occupy 61,379.04 mu land, including use of 54,656.5 mu existing 
state-owned land, permanent acquisition of 469.53 mu collective-owned land, and use of 6,253.01 
mu collective land through voluntary agreements or land leases. The project will also temporarily 
occupy 369.38 mu land during the construction. The land acquisition will impact 292 households 
with  1,141  persons  in  34  villages  of  29  towns  of  six  project  counties/district.  Among  them,  51 
households with 191 persons will be significantly affected. The due diligence for state-owned land 
and  associated  facilities  confirmed  that  there  are  no  outstanding  or  legacy  issues  of  land 
acquisition and resettlement; and it will be reconfirmed after the final design before approval of 
civil works contracts. 
99. 
Resettlement  plan.  A  resettlement  plan  (RP)  has  been  prepared  in  accordance  with 
ADB’s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) and relevant laws and regulations of the PRC. The RP 
includes  adequate  measures  of  compensation,  resettlement,  and  rehabilitation  for  affected 
people. Surveys and consultations were undertaken with affected people in preparation of the RP 
during  project  preparation.  Affected  people  will  be  further  consulted  for  updating  and 
implementation of the RP during the project implementation. A grievance redress mechanism has 
been established and incorporated into the RP. The RP also includes capacity building measures 
for the project executing and implementing agencies to implement RP in compliance with ADB 
requirements. The financial intermediary component will support only category C subprojects on 
involuntary  resettlement.  Necessary  measures  to  screen  and  avoid  involuntary  resettlement 
impacts are included in the ESMS. 
100.  Updating resettlement plan. The resettlement plan will be (i) updated based on the final 
design, detailed measurement survey, and census of affected persons; (ii) disclosed to affected 
persons;  and  (iii)  submitted  to  ADB  for  review  and  approval  prior  to  the  award  of  civil  works 
contract and commencement of land acquisition and resettlement. 
101. 
Institutional arrangement for implementation of the resettlement plan. GMG will be 
the  executing  agency  and  will  supervise,  coordinate,  and  manage  the  implementation  of  the 
resettlement plan. A project leading group (PLG) has been established in GMG, and a PMO has 
been established under the PLG in GMG. Implementing agencies will be the local governments 
of  the  nine  districts  and  counties.  Local  Natural  Resources  Bureaus  are  responsible  for  land 
acquisition,  compensation,  and  resettlement.  The  affected  township  governments  and  village 
committees will participate in and support the land acquisition and resettlement activities. 
102.  Capacity Building for implementation of the resettlement plan in compliance with 
ADB requirements. The executing and implementing agencies have the capacity to implement 
domestically funded projects. Their capacity will be strengthened to implement the resettlement 
plan in compliance with ADB requirements through several measures, including: (i) executing and 
implementing agencies will each appoint focal social safeguard staff, (ii) project implementation 
support  consultants  will  include  social  safeguard  specialists,  (iii)  staff  of  executing  and 
implementing agencies will be trained on social safeguard measures, (iv) a resettlement start-up 
consultant  will  provide  training  on  ADB’s  relevant  policy  requirements  and  will  assist  the 
52 
implementing  agencies  to  update  and  finalize  the  resettlement  plan,  and  (iv)  an  external 
monitoring agency will be recruited for external monitoring. 
103.  Resettlement  plan  implementation  schedule.  According  to  the  project  construction 
schedule,  the  resettlement  implementation  plan  has  been  prepared  and  included  in  the 
resettlement plan. The specific implementation time may be properly adjusted due to the deviation 
of the overall project progress. 
104.  Monitoring  and  reporting  of  resettlement  plan  implementation.  Provisions  of  both 
internal and external monitoring are included in the RP. With assistance of project management 
support  consultants,  the  PMO  will  include  progress  on  RP  in  progress  reports  to  ADB. 
Furthermore, PMO will employ an external resettlement monitoring institute or firm to (i) monitor 
and evaluate resettlement progress and results; and (ii) submit semiannual monitoring reports to 
ADB during resettlement implementation. 
C. 
Ethnic Minorities/Indigenous Peoples Safeguard 
105.  Ethnic  Minorities  (EM)/indigenous  peoples  (IP).  The  project  will  involve  six  ethnic 
minority concentrated villages, and the ethnic minority population comprises mostly She people. 
The ethnic minority villages will benefit from the project through training and capacity building, 
jobs,  sanitation  services,  ecotourism  and  improved  environment  and  living  conditions.  An 
assessment  of  potential  impacts  of  the  project  on  ethnic  minorities  was  conducted  during  the 
project  preparation  and  an  ethnic  minority  development  plan  has  been  prepared.  The  project 
executing and implementing agencies will implement the ethnic minority development plan and 
will  submit  monitoring  reports  to ADB.  For  the  FIL component,  necessary  measures for  ethnic 
minority are included in the ESMS. 
D. 
Environmental and Social Management System for FIL component 
106.  An ESMS has been prepared for the FIL (under output 2 of the project) by the PMO and 
ABC,  supported  by  the  TA  consultants  and  ADB  team.  The  ESMS  is  publicly  available  as  a 
separate linked document to the ADB Report and Recommendations of the President to the Board 
of Directors. The FIL will not fund any activities that are listed in the ADB Prohibited Investment 
Activity  List  (ESMS-Appendix  2).  PMO  and  ABC  committed  that  the  requirements  will  be  met 
during the screening of identified subprojects in accordance with the procedures stipulated in the 
ESMS; and adequate resources will be allocated to ensure the implementation, monitoring and 
reporting of ESMS for the FIL. 
107.  Content  of  the  ESMS  and  safeguards  selection  criteria.  The  ESMS  describes  (i) 
institutional  framework  of  the  ESMS,  including  legislative  and  policy  framework,  roles  and 
responsibilities of each specified position, and subproject selection criteria; (ii) activities that the 
FIL will or will not support (including activities listed under ADB’s prohibited investment activity 
list); (iii) implementation steps for the ESMS; (iv) integration of the ESMS into existing business 
procedures in ABC; (v) establishment  and  implementation  of  a  grievance redress mechanism; 
and  (vi)  capacity  building  and  training  for  ABC  to  implement  the  ESMS.  For  environment 
safeguards, activities that will not be supported by the FIL include: (i) activities which may cause 
significant and irreversible impacts to the environment i.e., meet the definition of ADB “Category 
A”  for  environment;  (ii)  are  located  in  or  next  to  a  designated  water  source  protection  zone, 
protected area, cultural heritage site, or critical natural habitat; (iii) involve large-scale landscape 
alteration e.g., quarrying, or terracing on slopes greater than 25º. For social safeguards, activities 
that  will  not  be  supported  by  GIF  include:  (i)  involve  involuntary  land  acquisition  impacts;  (ii) 
53 
involve  demolition  of  residential  or  private  commercial  buildings;  (iii)  involve  involuntary 
resettlement  which  meet  the  definition  of  ADB  “Category  A”  or  “Category  B”  for  resettlement 
safeguards;  and  (iv)  have  adverse  impacts  on  vulnerable  ethnic  minorities  (“Category  A”  or 
“Category  B”  for  indigenous  peoples  safeguards).  For  any  subprojects  which  involve  the 
expansion of, or links with, existing activities by the subborrower, the new subproject will only be 
supported if the existing activities follow domestic safeguard regulations. 
108.  Establishment of the ESMS. Prior to the transfer of any loan proceeds to ABC, ABC shall 
issue a formal Presidential Directive to integrate the ESMS into ABC business procedures and 
submit this  directive to GMG  and  ADB  at  least three months  prior  to establishing  the  financial 
intermediation  loan  fund.  ABC  shall  adhere to the  guidelines  in  the  ESMS  and  ensure  that  all 
screening,  categorization,  and  assessment  of  subloan  applications  specified  in  the  ESMS  is 
conducted  before  final  approval  of  any  investments.  GMG  and  ABC  will  ensure  that  all 
participating applicants receiving funds from FIL will follow the requirements listed in the ESMS. 
109.  ESMS  personnel.  ABC  will  recruit  at  least  one  qualified  environment  officer  and  one 
qualified social officer. These officers will lead the establishment of the ESMS and work closely 
with the ABC financial officers, applicants, and qualified end-borrowers, to integrate the ESMS 
into existing business procedures and for daily implementation of the ESMS procedures for the 
safeguard  screening,  categorization,  and  management  of  approved  equity  investments.  Draft 
terms of reference for the ABC environment officer and social officer positions are in the Appendix 
6 of ESMS. 
110.  ESMS Implementation procedures. ABC will ensure that each Qualified Project meets 
the requirements  of  the ESMS  i.e.,  screening  procedures  have  been  completed; the  proposed 
activities meet the ESMS criteria; and the proposed designs seek to maximize environmental and 
social benefits. To support the design process, the ABC environmental officer and social officer 
and applicant will consult with relevant government bureaus. The ABC environment officer and/or 
social  officer  will  also  work  with  the  PMO  environmental  officer  and  social  officer,  and  loan 
implementation  consultants  as  necessary,  for  technical  feedback  and  support.  All  Qualified 
Projects  shall  comply  with  ADB's  Safeguards  Policy  Statement.  The  ABC  and  qualified  end-
borrowers  shall  submit  to  PMO,  ADB,  and/or  ABC  all  records,  and  documents  as  may  be 
requested from time to time. 
E. 
Grievance Redress Mechanisms 
111.  Two  project-specific  grievance  redress  mechanisms  (GRM)  have  been  developed  in 
compliance  with  SPS  requirements:  one  for  environmental  safeguards  and  one  for  social 
safeguards.  The  GRMs  complement  and  builds  upon  existing  PRC  mechanisms 
for 
environmental and social complaints respectively, including the national environmental complaint 
hotline.  The  GRMs  are  designed  to  achieve  the  following  objectives:  (i)  provide  channels  of 
communication  for  communities  to  raise  concerns  about  environmental  and/or  social  related 
grievances which might result from the project; (ii) prevent and mitigate adverse environmental 
and/or social impacts to communities caused by project construction and operation; and (iii) build 
trust and respect and promote productive relationships between the project agencies and local 
villages  and  communities.  The  GRMs  are  accessible  to  all  members  of  the  villages  and 
communities,  including  women,  youth,  minorities  and  poverty-stricken  villagers  and  residents. 
Multiple  points  of  entry  are  available,  including  face-to-face  meetings,  written  complaints, 
telephone conversations, email, and social media. The details of the GRM, including a time-bound 
flow chart of procedures, are described in the EMP, RP, EMDP, and ESMS. 
54 
112.  Specific GRM procedures have been incorporated into the EMP, resettlement plan, EMDP 
and ESMS. The complaint channels are slightly different for environmental and social issues, but 
the PMO will maintain an integrated reporting system to document, follow-up, and report on all 
cases. Before construction, the PMO and CPMOs will notify the project design and impacts to the 
affected person(s). The environment and social officers of the PMO and nine CPMOs in the one 
district and eight counties will be the lead coordinators for GRM implementation. At the beginning 
of  construction,  the  PMO  and  CPMOs  will  determine  the  project  site,  floor  area,  etc.  with  the 
affected  village  committees  during  a  field  visit.  For  issues  of  great  public  concern (if  any),  the 
PMO and CPMOs will further improve the project design. All project agencies and staff will be 
trained in the GRM and will take an active role in supporting these officers when necessary. 
F. 
Other 
113.  Prohibited  investment  activities.  Pursuant  to  ADB’s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement 
(2009),  ADB  funds  may  not  be  applied  to  the  activities  described  on  the  ADB  Prohibited 
Investment Activities List set forth at Appendix 5 of the Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). ABC, 
the  financial  institution,  will  ensure  that  its  investments  follow  applicable  national  laws  and 
regulations and will apply the prohibited investment activities list (provided in the Appendix 4 of 
the PAM) to subprojects financed by ADB. 
55 
VIII.  POVERTY, SOCIAL AND GENDER DIMENSIONS 
A. 
General 
114.  Gender.  A  gender  assessment  has  been  conducted  during  project  preparation  and  a 
gender action plan (GAP) (Table 17) has been prepared. It is estimated 285,651 (50%) women 
will  directly benefit  from the  project.  Most  women (over  85%)  are  living  in rural  areas. Women 
between 15-49 years old migrate to work in urban areas on a long-term basis, but the percentage 
is  about  30%  lower  than  men.  The  rest  stay  working  as  seasonal  workers  and  taking  care  of 
children, seniors, and the land. Over 40% female respondents in the survey are farmers, seasonal 
workers, and homemakers. Double incomes are common, while in 76% of sampled households, 
men earn more than women. Wives and husbands make decisions together on important family 
issues. 
115. 
In the sample, 85% of the female respondents indicated being responsible for the disposal 
of  wastewater  and  domestic  waste.  Also,  87%  of  female  indicated  that  improving  farming 
infrastructure and production modes can reduce their vulnerability to natural disasters and market 
risks, while possibly increasing their income. The focus group discussions (FGDs) indicate women 
business  owners,  women  seeking  seasonal  jobs  and  homemakers  indicated  their  interest  in 
participating in skills trainings in e-commerce and green finance, learn good practices from others 
in starting small businesses and finding jobs in project related activities. In Ganzhou, women also 
play a role in rural vitalization. Over 4,000 women leaders have been on board to lead the rural 
campaign of “Clean home and village.” The social survey further confirmed women are the main 
project group and significant agent of change to achieve the project goals. 
116.  Women  in the  project  area  show  high  willingness  to participate in project  consultations 
(96.67%). The social survey had 270 (49.82%) female respondents. Eighteen female FGDs were 
organized and women representatives of business owners, farmers, homemakers, workers, civil 
servants participated in the discussions and their views, concerns and recommendations have 
been recorded and reflected in the gender analysis. Women’s consultation and participation will 
be continued throughout the project cycle to ensure a focus on gender equality. The focus of the 
GAP is on (i) increasing access to safely managed wastewater treatment plants; (ii) promotion of 
including  village-based  ecotourism 
women’s  participation 
infrastructure; (iii) quotas for women in skill trainings, (iv) engaging women in leading environment 
protection initiatives, (v) access to jobs; and (vi) quotas for women to access subloans. 
in  eco-friendly  businesses, 
117.  GAP monitoring and reporting. A gender specialist (national, 8 person-months) will be 
engaged to provide guidance to the implementing agencies and PMOs in implementing the GAP, 
to  monitor  implementation  progress  and  to  report  on  the  monitoring  results.  GAP  monitoring 
information  and  progress  toward  achievement  of  targets  will  be  included  in  the  semiannual 
monitoring  reports  which  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  for  review  as  well  as  midterm  and  project 
completion reports. 
118.  Poverty and Social. The project is classified as general intervention for poverty reduction. 
A  poverty  and  social  analysis  were  undertaken  based  on  stakeholder  consultations  and 
socioeconomic surveys. It indicates that the project will provide socioeconomic development and 
poverty  reduction  opportunities  for  residents  including  the  poor  and  low-income  people  by 
increasing their access to (i) jobs during project construction and operation; (ii) new jobs in green 
enterprises; and (iii) a better living environment. A total of 578,138 residents will directly benefit 
from the project outputs. Other residents in Ganzhou will also benefit indirectly from the improved 
environment and economic opportunities. The project will create 1,241 jobs during construction 
56 
and 1,584 jobs during operation. GMG prepared a social development action plan, which includes 
specific  measures  for  the  poor  and  low-income  people.  Consultations  were  undertaken  with 
residents and other stakeholders during the project preparation. A consultation and participation 
plan  for  project  implementation  stage  has  been  included  in  the  PAM.  The  executing  and 
implementing  agencies  will  ensure  implementation,  monitoring,  and  reporting  on  social  and 
poverty measures. A social development action plan (SDAP) (Table 18) has been prepared, which 
include specific actions and targets for low-income or poor people. 
B. 
For FIL Component 
119.  ABC  shall  require  the  consultants  to  ensure  that  contractors  and  service  providers 
engaged in subprojects under green financing component will implement relevant provisions of 
gender action plan and social development action plan, including: (i) give equal pay for equal work 
regardless of gender, ethnicity or social group; (ii) give priority to women in the employment and 
training  opportunities  generated  under  the  subprojects;  (iii)  maximize  the  employment  of  local 
people who meet the job and efficiency requirements for subproject construction, operation and 
maintenance; (iv) provide workers with adequate on-the-job and safety training; (v) disseminate 
information on sexually transmitted diseases (including HIV/AIDS) to subcontractors/employees 
and  local  communities  surrounding  the  subproject  construction  sites;  (vi)  implement  HIV/AIDS 
awareness  and  prevention  training  for  subcontractors/employees;  (vii)  provide  necessary 
measures to ensure the safety and health of its subcontractors/employees; and (viii) observe local 
customs concerning acceptable behavior toward the local population. 
120.  ABC shall require the consultants to ensure that the core labor standards and the PRC’s 
applicable  laws  and  regulations  are  complied  with  during  subproject  implementation  and  that 
specific provisions are included in bidding documents and contracts financed by the ADB Loan 
under green financing component requiring that the contractors, among other things: (i) comply 
with  the  PRC’s  applicable  labor  law  and  regulations  and  incorporate  applicable  workplace 
occupational safety norms; (ii) do not use child labor; (iii) do not discriminate workers in respect 
of employment and occupation; (iv) do not use forced labor; and (v) do not restrict workers from 
developing  any  legally  permissible  means  of  expressing  their  grievances  and  protecting  their 
rights regarding working conditions and terms of employment.

C. 
1. 
Monitoring 
Project performance monitoring 
121.  To  monitor  the  progress  of  the  project  in  achieving  the  planned  outcome  and  outputs, 
PMO  will  establish  a  project  performance  management  system  (PPMS)  before  the  project 
implementation starts (before the loan effectiveness) and will maintain it accordingly. The basis 
for project performance monitoring and reporting will be the DMF, which identifies performance 
targets for the outcomes and outputs of the project. It will be designed to permit adequate flexibility 
to  adopt  remedial  action  regarding  project  design,  schedules,  activities,  and  development 
impacts. 
122.  The  PPMS  will  cover  the  following  aspects  of  the  project  implementation:  (i)  project 
physical and financial progress; (ii) progress and results of capacity development; (iii) updating 
and implementation of the resettlement plan; (iv) implementation of the EMP; (v) implementation 
of  SGAP;  and  (vi)  compliance  with  loan  covenants  (policy,  financial,  economic,  sector,  and 
others). 
123.  With  inputs  from  the  IAs  and  other  stakeholders,  PMO  will  prepare  semiannual  project 
progress reports. Disaggregated baseline data for output and outcome indicators gathered during 
project  preparation  will  be  updated  and  reported  in  the  quarterly  reports  and  after  each  ADB 
review mission. At the start of project implementation, PMO, IAs, and ADB will develop integrated 
PPMS  procedures  to  generate  data  systematically  on  the  inputs  and  outputs,  as  well  as  the 
indicators to be used to measure the project’s impact and outcome considering the project scope. 
2. 
Compliance monitoring 
124.  During project implementation, ADB and PMO will closely monitor the compliance of all 
the covenants under the project and will take necessary remedial actions for any noncompliance. 
The compliance status will be reported in the quarterly progress reports by the PMO and will be 
reviewed during project review missions. 
125.  Legal covenants. GMG shall ensure that in the event of (i) any change in ownership or 
control  of  the  project  facilities;  or  (ii)  any  sale,  transfer,  or  assignment  of  the  shares  of  IAs  is 
anticipated,  GMG  will  consult  with  ADB  at  least  6  months  prior  to  the  implementation  of  such 
change. GMG shall cause IAs to further ensure that such changes are carried out in a lawful and 
transparent manner. 
126.  Counterpart  funding.  GMG  shall  provide  the  details  of  the  sources  of  the  counterpart 
funding as well as provide corresponding commitment letters. The total cost includes physical and 
price contingencies, and interest during construction. 
127.  Financial management. GMG shall establish and maintain sound financial management 
systems  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  guidelines  on  the  financial  management  and  analysis  of 
projects,  including  the  establishment  of  separate  project  accounts  and  the  maintenance  of 
minimum balances to ensure smooth cash flow and the timely settlement of project construction 
liabilities and future debt servicing. 
70 
3. 
Safeguards Monitoring 
128.  Environmental safeguard monitoring. The project monitoring program focuses on the 
environment in the project areas of influence. The environmental monitoring program is included 
in  the  project  EMP,  including  parameters,  time,  and  frequency,  implementing  and  supervising 
agencies, and estimated costs. Three types of monitoring will be conducted in accordance with 
the EMP: (i) internal monitoring, to be conducted by the implementing agencies and construction 
supervision consultants (CSCs); (ii) external monitoring of air, water, noise, and soil standards, to 
be conducted by an external environment monitoring firm; and (iii) compliance monitoring to be 
conducted  by  the  start-up  environment  safeguard  specialist  and  continued  by  the  loan 
implementation  environment  consultant  (LIEC),  to  ensure  the  EMP  and  ESMS  are  being 
implemented. Monitoring shall comply with the PRC standards for environmental monitoring. ADB 
will oversee the compliance based on semiannual environmental monitoring reports provided by 
the PMO and review missions. 
129. 
Internal environmental monitoring. During construction, the PMO environment officer, 
IA  environment  officers,  and  CSCs  will  be  responsible  for  conducting  internal  environmental 
monitoring in accordance with the monitoring plan. Results will be reported through: (i) internal 
progress reports of the PMO and IA environment officers, based on their direct observations at 
work sites;  and (ii)  monthly  reports  by  the  CSCs,  submitted to  the  implementing  agencies  and 
PMO. 
130.  External  monitoring.  External  environmental monitoring will  be  conducted  by  the  loan 
implementation consulting firm. The firm will have the relevant national certifications and capacity 
to undertake the external monitoring specified in the EMP or will subcontract this monitoring to 
another qualified firm. Monitoring will be conducted throughout construction and during the first 
year of operation. Semiannual monitoring reports will be prepared by the firm and submitted to 
the PMO and implementing agencies. The terms of reference for the firm are in Appendix 2. 
131.  EMP compliance monitoring. The LIEC will review the project progress and compliance 
with the EMP based on field visits, discussions with project agencies, and review of the progress 
reports  provided  by  the  CSCs  and  external  environmental  monitoring firm.  The findings  of  the 
LIEC will be reported to ADB through the semiannual EMP monitoring reports. 
132.  Environment  safeguard  reporting  and  disclosure.  The  PMO  will  submit  semiannual 
environmental  monitoring  reports  to  ADB.  The  reports  will  include:  (i)  progress made  for  EMP 
implementation, (ii) overall effectiveness of the EMP and ESMS implementation (including public 
and  occupational  health  and  safety),  (iii)  environmental  monitoring  and  compliance,  (iv) 
institutional  strengthening  and  training,  (v)  public  consultation  (including  GRM),  and  (vi)  any 
problems  encountered  during  construction  and  operation,  and  the  relevant  corrective  actions 
undertaken. The Agricultural Bank of China will also prepare semiannual safeguard reports on 
compliance  with  and  progress  to  implement  the  ESMS.  These  will  be  more  detailed  than  the 
overall PMO semiannual environment monitoring to be submitted to ADB and will help inform the 
content of these reports. The LIEC will assist the PMO and Agricultural Bank of China safeguard 
teams to establish reporting formats, prepare the reports and submit them to ADB. ADB will review 
and disclose the reports on the ADB website. 
133.  Environmental  acceptance  reporting.  Following  the  PRC  Regulation  on  Project 
Completion  Environmental  Audit  (Ministry  of  Environmental  Protection,  2001),  within  three 
months after the completion of major subprojects, an environmental acceptance report for each 
subproject  shall  be  (i)  prepared  by  the  implementing  agencies  or  capable  environmental 
71 
monitoring institute in accordance with the PRC Guideline on Project Completion Environmental 
Audit  (2017);  and  (ii)  finally  reported  to  ADB  through  the  semiannual  EMP  monitoring  and 
progress reporting process. The environmental acceptance reports of the subproject completions 
will indicate the timing, extent, effectiveness of completed mitigation and of maintenance, and the 
needs for additional mitigation measures and monitoring during operations. 
134. 
Involuntary  Resettlement.  Internal  and  external  monitoring  of  resettlement  plan 
implementation  will  be  conducted.  Monitoring  methodologies  are  specified  in  the  resettlement 
plan. The PMO and implementing agencies assisted by the project management consultants will 
carry  out  internal  monitoring  to  ensure  compliance  with  the  provisions  of  the  RP.  The  PMO, 
implementing agencies, and consultants for project management supports will develop a set of 
supervision milestones in accordance with the RP to ensure timely and effective implementation 
of resettlement activities. The PMO will include internal monitoring results in the progress reports 
to ADB. 
135.  An external social and resettlement monitoring agency acceptable to ADB will be engaged 
by  the  PMO  prior  to  commencement  of  land  acquisition.  The  external  monitoring  agency  will 
conduct  external  M&E  semiannually  during  the  implementation  of  land  acquisition  and 
resettlement, and conduct follow-up evaluation semiannually for two years after the completion of 
land acquisition and resettlement. The cost of the external resettlement M&E will be funded from 
the ADB loan. External resettlement M&E reports will be submitted semiannually to ADB, and a 
resettlement completion report will be prepared at the end-of-project. 
136.  Ethnic Minorities. Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of the EMDP is required to ensure 
the  plan  is  implemented  properly.  The  EMDP  will  be  monitored  and  reported  semiannually  to 
ADB. The social consultants who will be hired during project implementation by Ganzhou PMO 
will set up an appropriate monitoring system and assist with reports. The consultant shall assist 
Ganzhou PMO and implementing agencies in implementing to ensure that the activities included 
in  the  EMDP  are  implemented.  EMDP  monitoring  includes  internal  and  external  monitoring. 
Internal monitoring will be performed by Ganzhou PMO semiannually, with the assistance of a 
social specialist in the project implementation consultant team to be recruited by Ganzhou PMO 
during project implementation. External monitoring will be performed semiannually by an external 
agency  (together  with  the  external  resettlement  monitoring)  until  project  completion.  EMDP 
monitoring  reports  (together  with  the  resettlement  monitoring  report)  will  be  submitted 
semiannually to Ganzhou PMO and ADB. 
4. 
Gender and Social Dimensions Monitoring 
137.  Monitoring  indicators  for  the  GAP  and  SDAP  will  be  incorporated  into  the  PPMS.  The 
PMOs and implementing agencies will be responsible for establishing and coordinating regular 
monitoring and evaluation. 
138.  The regular project progress reports to ADB will include, at least semiannually, reporting 
on  GAP  and  SDAP  progress.  Assistance  will  be  provided  to  the  executing  agency  and 
implementing  agencies  by  the  project  consultant  who  will  help  to  set  up  effective  monitoring 
systems and work with the focal points and implementing agencies to ensure implementation of 
the GAP and SDAP. The project’s consultants will assist the PMO and implementing agencies to 
collect data to assess the effectiveness of the GAP and SDAP. This will include an end-of-project 
survey  of  a  small  number  of  sample  beneficiaries  and/or  focus  group  discussions  with 
beneficiaries to obtain qualitative information on the improvements to their lives because of the 
project. 
72 
D. 
Evaluation 
139. 
In addition to regular monitoring, ADB and GMG will jointly review project performance at 
least once a year. The review will assess implementation performance and achievement of project 
outcomes  and  outputs,  assess  financial  progress,  identify  issues  and  constraints  affecting 
implementation,  and  work  out  a  time-bound  action  plan  for  resolution.  ADB  and  GMG  will 
undertake a midterm review to assess implementation status and take appropriate measures—
including  modification  of  scope  and  implementation  arrangements,  and  reallocation  of  loan 
proceeds,  as  appropriate—to  achieve  the  project  impact  and  outcome.  Within  6  months  of 
physical completion of the project, GMG will submit a project completion report to ADB. 30 
E. 
Reporting 
140.  The GMG will provide ADB with (i) quarterly progress reports in a format consistent with 
ADB's  project  performance  reporting  system;  (ii)  consolidated  annual  reports  including  (a) 
progress achieved by output as measured through the indicator's performance targets, (b) key 
implementation  issues  and  solutions,  (c)  updated  procurement  plan,  and  (d)  updated 
implementation plan for the next 12 months; and (iii) a project completion report within 6 months 
of physical completion of the project. To ensure that projects will continue to be both viable and 
sustainable, project accounts and the executing agency audited financial statement together with 
the associated auditor's report, should be adequately reviewed. The GHG will also provide ADB 
with semiannual environment monitoring reports, which will describe and assess compliance with, 
and progress for, implementation of the project EMP and ESMS. 
F. 
Stakeholder Communication Strategy 
141.  Project  information  will  be  communicated  through  public  consultation,  information 
disclosure mechanism in ADB’s and government’s websites, meetings, interviews, focus group 
discussions  and  community  consultation  meetings  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  requirements  of 
information disclosure policy. 
142.  Environment.  Meaningful  consultation,  participation  and  information  disclosure  was 
conducted  during  project  preparation.  Information  disclosure  and  public  consultation  included 
newspaper disclosure; informal communication with key stakeholders, including residents, local 
authorities  and  sector  specific  institutions  and  authorities;  questionnaire  surveys;  and  wider 
stakeholder  meetings  attended  by  affected  people  and  other  concerned  stakeholders.  A  GRM 
has  been  defined  to  address  community  concerns,  reduce  risks,  and  assist  the  project  in 
maximizing environmental and social benefits. Meaningful consultation will continue throughout 
project implementation, especially prior to and during civil works. Planning for public consultations 
will ensure that environmental and social safeguard requirements are discussed. 
143. 
Involuntary  Resettlement.  All  the  affected  villages/households  were  involved  in  the 
project  impact  and  socioeconomic  survey.  Through  meetings,  interviews,  focus  group 
discussions,  public  consultation  workshops,  and  community  consultation  meetings;  local 
representatives participated in the planning, and their concerns have been integrated into the RP. 
The resettlement plan will be posted on the ADB website. Resettlement information booklets will 
be  distributed  to  affected  households.  The  booklets  contain  information  such  as  the  affected 
project  areas,  implementation  progress  of  and  procedures  for  land  acquisition  and  relocation,

compensation standards for land acquisition and house demolition, livelihood restoration strategy. 
Each implementing agency includes a full-time resettlement and social officer for supervision of 
implementation,  continued  public  consultation,  monitoring  of  progress,  and  response  to 
grievances.  The  grievance  redress  procedures  have  been  established  and  explanations  have 
been included in the resettlement information booklets. 
144.  Ethnic Minorities. At the preparation stage, the agencies concerned disclosed relevant 
information, collected comments on the project design, and held consultation meetings with direct 
beneficiaries,  including  ethnic  minority  groups.  At  the  implementation  stage,  needs  and 
suggestions  from  the  ethnic  minorities  will  be  handled  timely  based  on  project  progress,  and 
further consultation will be conducted; local minority villagers' comments on project layout and 
construction impacts will be considered; a public hearing on water and solid waste disposal rates 
will  be  held  with  minority  villagers;  employment  and  training  information  will  be  provided;  a 
grievance  redress  mechanism  will  be  established.  At  the  operation  stage,  consultation  with 
minority villagers will be conducted timely and in a culturally appropriate manner. 
145.  Social  and  gender.  Consultations  with  communities  were  conducted  and  will  be 
continued  during  the  implementation  of  the  SDAP,  and  GAP,  not  only  to  inform  people  about 
project components or activities, but also to enable people to ask questions, make suggestions, 
state preferences, and/or express concerns. Special attention will be paid to the participation of 
women, the poor and/or low-income people and other vulnerable groups. Public hearings will be 
held for any proposed adjustments in the water tariff, with attendance of adequate representation 
of the poor/low-income people and women, etc. 
146.  Public disclosure. ADB, the GMG including the PMO, and implementing agencies will 
disclose  relevant  project  information  to  the  public  and  interested  parties.  This  includes  the 
information regarding the overall project and environment and social safeguards. The information 
disclosure measures for different stakeholders are described in the Table below. 
147.  A  consultation  and  participation  plan  (CPP)  has  been  prepared  for  the  concerned 
stakeholders within the project areas as required by ADB to ensure inclusiveness, transparency, 
and meaningful consultation and participation of concerned stakeholders for the Project (Table 
19).  The  purpose  of  this  plan  is  to  engage  the  stakeholders  in  meaningful  consultation  and 
decision-making  process;  inform  them  about  the  project  and  consult  them  on  various  issues 
relevant to the project/subcomponents and activities during project design and implementation. 
Consultation  and  participation  serve  as  a  venue  for  the  key  stakeholders  (i.e.,  government 
agencies, project beneficiaries, and women) to be informed about the project, clarify and express 
feedbacks,  issues  and  concerns,  and  suggestions;  learn  how  they  will  be  benefited  by  the 
projects;  participate  in  decision-making  and  act  and/or  be  involved  during  the  design,  project 
implementation and operation/maintenance stages.

X. 
ANTICORRUPTION POLICY 
148.  ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any violations of the 
Anticorruption  Policy  relating  to  the  project. 31 All  contracts  financed  by  ADB  shall  include 
provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the 
executing agency and all project contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers. 
Individuals and/or entities on ADB’s anticorruption debarment list are ineligible to participate in 
ADB-financed, administered, or supported activities and may not be awarded any contracts under 
the project.32 
149.  To support these efforts, relevant provisions are included in the loan agreement and the 
bidding  documents  for  the  project.  PRC  has  introduced  extensive  laws  and  regulations  to 
strengthen government functions and address corruption. Local governments at all levels have 
developed  corresponding  regulations  and  rules.  Although  strict  laws  against  corruption  are  in 
place, the implementation team will closely monitor the identified finance high risk management. 
This  will  be  mitigated  during  implementation  as  specified  in  the  Risk  Assessment  and  Risk 
Management Plan. Specifically, the fraud and corruption risks will be mitigated by (i) explaining 
ADB’s  Anticorruption  Policy  and  whistle  blowing  mechanisms  to  executing/implementing 
agencies,  project management  offices  and  project  implementation  organizations staff  engaged 
under the project to ensure that they are equipped with sufficient knowledge and aware of the 
policy from the very early stage of project implementation (ii) strengthening the capacity of the 
executing/implementing  agencies,  project  management  offices  and  project  implementation 
organizations  by  providing  continuous  training  to  the  staff  on  ADB’s  procurement,  financial 
management and disbursement procedures and systems, (iii) ensuring efficient coordination on 
the flow of information between the different entities involved in the project implementation, and 
(iv)  generating  periodic  financial  and  physical  progress  reports  to  ensure  bottlenecks  and 
inefficiencies are identified in a timely fashion. 
150.  The EA/IAs are required to scrutinize ADB's Complete Sanctions List during bid/proposals 
evaluation,  prior  to  shortlisting,  contract  award,  and  contract  variations,  extensions  or 
modifications to confirm that no bidder, contractor, supplier, individual consultant, consulting firm, 
and its team members are currently on the List. Should GPMO and county/district PMOs identify 
that an entity/individual is on the ADB Sanctions List, it should be reported to ADB immediately. 
ADB has right to investigate, audit and inspect the suspicious entity or individual on the Sanctions 
List. 
XI. 
ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISM 
151.  People  who  are,  or may  in the  future  be,  adversely  affected  by the  project  may  submit 
complaints  to  ADB’s  Accountability  Mechanism.  The  Accountability  Mechanism  provides  an 
independent forum and process whereby people adversely affected by ADB-assisted projects can 
voice,  and  seek  a  resolution  of  their  problems,  as  well  as  report  alleged  violations  of  ADB’s 
operational  policies  and  procedures.  Before  submitting  a  complaint  to  the  Accountability 
Mechanism, affected people should make an effort in good faith to solve their problems by working 
with  the  concerned  ADB  operations  department.  Only  after  doing  that,  and  if  they  are  still 
dissatisfied, should they approach the Accountability Mechanism.33

Capacity Strengthening in Air Pollution Prevention and Control 
Indicative Terms of Reference for Package GZ-Serv-1 
A. 
Background 
1. 
Ganzhou is a large agricultural prefecture-level municipality in Jiangxi Province with an 
estimated population of 9.7 million in 2017 and a land area of 39,380 square kilometers. Ganzhou 
is deemed poor, ecologically fragile, relatively rural, and strategically located in the vicinity of the 
Gan  River  in  Jiangxi  province.  There  have  been  increased  environmental  and  ecological 
degradations in the rural areas of Gan River in Ganzhou. 
The  People’s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  has  requested  the  Asian  Development  Bank 
2. 
(ADB)  to  provide  investment  support  and  technical  assistance  for  the  Jiangxi  Ganzhou  Rural 
Vitalization and Comprehensive Environment Improvement Project (the project). The project will 
strengthen the environmental and ecological protection and urban-rural integration along the Gan 
River to improve the rural environmental and economic conditions in Ganzhou. The project will 
be implemented through four outputs within eight counties and one district, including institutional 
capacity  for  environment  and  water  resource  management  strengthened,  green  development 
mechanisms  piloted,  rural  waste  and  sanitation  management  improved,  and  water  and  soil

to establishment of a comprehensive air quality monitoring network and information management 
platform to enhance the capacity on air quality control of Ganzhou Municipal Government (GMG). 
B. 
The Objectives and Overall Scope of Works 
Particulate pollutant 2.5 (PM2.5) and ozone (O3) are the two key factors of air pollution in 
4. 
PRC. During the recent years, GMG has paid great efforts on air pollution prevention and control, 
the concentration of PM2.5 decreased but the concentration of O3 kept increasing. As the formation 
process of O3 is complicated and the increase of O3 in ambient air and air pollutant emission have 
a non-linear relationship, traditional air quality control strategy and mindset are not suitable for 
control  of  O3  pollution.  In  addition,  GMG  has  limited  equipment,  technical  personnel,  and 
supervision  capacity  for  volatile  organic  compounds  (VOCs)  monitoring  and  control.  The 
consulting  service  is  to  provide  physical  and  technical  support  to  provide  whole  process 
monitoring of air pollution emission and diffusion and improve the management capacity of air 
quality in Ganzhou, in line with the targets set in 14th Five Year Plan. 
5. 
Overall  working  scope  include:  (i)  establishment  of  a  comprehensive  air  quality 
monitoring  network;  (ii)  design  of  air  quality  monitoring  routes  for  the  monitoring  vehicles;  (iii) 
application  of  new-tech  equipment  and  vehicles  to  complement  traditional  manual  monitoring, 
including laser radar; (v) analysis of monitoring data and providing basis for decision-making; (vi) 
development of an air quality management platform; and (vi) procurement of relevant monitoring 
equipment and vehicles, etc. 
C. 
Major Outputs and Activities 
The consulting  service will  be  carried  out  by  a team  of  consultants through a  firm.  The 
6. 
consulting services will be financed by ADB, and the consulting firm will be recruited by the PMO 
according to Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers - Goods, Works, Nonconsulting, and 
86 
Appendix 2

by (i) inviting full technical proposals; and (ii) using the quality and cost-based selection (QCBS) 
method. The consulting services are expected to start on 1 June 2023 and finish on 31 May 2028. 
7. 
The key outputs of the consulting service will include: 
⚫  Output  1:  Assessment  of  the  status  quo  of  air  quality  monitoring  in  Ganzhou  city,  and 
establishment of a monitoring network to cover core and key control areas. 
⚫  Output 2: Analysis of the sources of PM2.5 and O3, and key factors influencing the formation 
of PM2.5 and O3 through quantitative and qualitative approaches. 
⚫  Output  3:  Development  of  an  air  quality  control  platform,  including  a  monitoring  network

A. 
Introduction 
APPENDIX 5: PROCUREMENT MANUAL 
This procurement manual is prepared to regulate the procurement activities of the Green 
1. 
the  Ganzhou  Rural  Revitalization  Environmental 
Financing  Mechanism  component 
Comprehensive Treatment Project, which will utilize an Asian Development Bank (ADB) financial 
intermediation  loan  (FIL).  ADB  expects  that  for  FILs,  the  procurement  is  undertaken  by  the 
respective  loan  beneficiaries  in  accordance  with  established  private  sector  or  commercial 
practices, and which are acceptable to ADB. 
in 
2. 
First objective of the manual is to draw attention to Qualified Investees that they have the 
responsibility to ensure the procurement activities they undertake to implement their Subprojects 
must: 
(i) 
(ii) 
Comply with any relevant laws and regulations of the People’s Republic of China 
(PRC)  and  the  municipal  or  provincial  governments  in the  greater  Ganzhou  are 
where the project is located and 
Adhere  to  procurement  principles  and  guidance  determined  by  ADB  to  be 
applicable to this FIL project. 
Second objective of the manual is to offer specific guidance on how procurement activities 
3. 
can be undertaken that will ensure compliance with ADB Procurement Policy and regulations. 
4. 
It is not appropriate for this ADB manual to offer specific advice on compliance with the 
specific  requirements  of  the  PRC  and  local  governments’  laws  and  regulations.  Such  legal 
compliance is the responsibility of investees and applies not just to procurement activities but is 
an all-embracing responsibility they have in how they conduct to all their business activities. 
5. 
Notwithstanding  the  above  statement,  all  the  guidance  provided  in  this  manual  is 
compatible with current applicable PRC  law—and specifically  the  PRC  Tendering  and Bidding 
Law 1999 (effective from 1 Jan 2000), the scope and applicability of which includes all investment 
projects that utilize foreign capital funds. Qualified Investees should therefore ensure that their 
procurement staff are familiar with the requirements of this law and its applicable regulations, in 
addition to being provided with this procurement manual. 
6. 
It is also not the intention of this manual to force changes in the procurement procedures 
of  the  investees  where  they  already  substantially  comply  with  required  ADB  procurement 
principles.  However,  it  is  expected  that  the  investees  will  review  their  own  procurement 
procedures using the contents of this manual as a guide and adjust their procedures to ensure 
the required substantial compliance. 
The  contents  of  this  procurement  manual  will  be  kept  under  review  during  project 
7. 
implementation and can be revised at any time according to the project requirements, or changes 
in applicable laws and regulations. Any changes in the manual will be jointly approved by GMG 
and ADB. 
B. 
Procurement Objectives 
The aim of any procurement process is to ensure the resulting procurement provides the 
8. 
investees with goods, works or services that: 
(i) 
Are  fit  for  the  intended  purpose–i.e.,  they  meet  required  quality,  durability,  and 
performance criteria; 
128 
Appendix 5 
(ii) 
(iii) 
Provide value for money to the purchaser; and 
Are procured in a timely and efficient manner. 
9. 
These objectives are wholly compatible with best commercial practice and endorsed by 
ADB. However, the objectives are not mutually exclusive, and they can conflict to a degree. For 
example, sophisticated procurement procedures may well be justified for large scale or technically 
complex  procurement  but  would  not  be  justified  on  efficiency  grounds  for  simpler  small-scale 
procurement.  ADB  Procurement  Policy  and  regulations  recognize  the  need  for  an  efficient 
procurement process by providing simpler procedures for small-scale procurement. 
10. 
Another  crosscutting  objective  of  any  procurement  process  is  to  adequately  safeguard 
investees  against  the  risks  of  corruption  and  fraud  that  could  damage  the  level  of  subproject 
performance (as measured in financial terms and/or energy/emissions savings), and potentially 
the competitiveness of the entire business. 
C. 
ADB Procurement Principles 
11. 
ADB procurement guidelines are based on the principles of (i) economy, (ii) efficiency, (iii) 
fairness, (iv) transparency, (v) quality, and (v) value for money. Each of these principles is briefly 
explained below, while specific guidance on their application is given in Section D of this manual. 
12. 
Economy.  The  principle  of  economy  means  considering  factors  such  as  price,  quality, 
and any nonprice attributes, as appropriate, without adversely affecting the viability of the project. 
Efficiency.  The  principle  of  efficiency  ensures  that  procurement  processes  are 
13. 
proportional  to  the  value  and  risks  of  the  required  outcome  and  underlying  project  activities, 
considering implementation capacity, time constraints, and cost-effectiveness. 
Fairness.  The  principle  of  fairness  means  (a)  equal  opportunity  for  and  treatment  of 
14. 
eligible bidders; (b) equitable distribution of rights and obligations between borrowers and bidders; 
and  (c)  credible  mechanisms  for  addressing  procurement-related  complaints  and  providing 
recourse. ADB encourages open competition as the preferred procurement approach, whenever 
possible, to maximize fairness of the opportunity to bid. 
15. 
Transparency.  The  principle  of  transparency  means  ensuring,  through  appropriate 
documentation and review of activities in the procurement process, that (a) relevant procurement 
information is made publicly available to interested parties, in a consistent and timely manner, 
through readily accessible and widely available sources at no (or reasonable) cost; (b) appropriate 
reporting of procurement activity; and (c) use of confidentiality provisions in contracts only where 
justified. 
16. 
Quality.  This  principle  requires  that  the  procurement  arrangements4  are  structured  to 
procure  inputs  and  deliver  outputs  of  appropriate  standard  in a  timely  and  effective manner  to 
achieve the project outcomes and development objectives, considering the context, risk, value, 
and complexity of procurement. 
17. 
Value for money. This principle enables the borrower to obtain optimal benefits through 
effective,  efficient,  and  economic  use  of  resources  by  applying,  as  appropriate,  the  Core 
Procurement  principles  and  related  considerations,  which  may  include  life  cycle  costs  and 
socioeconomic and environmental development objectives of the borrower. Price alone may not 
sufficiently represent value for money. 
Appendix 5 
129 
It is generally accepted by procurement experts that these principles, if properly applied, 
18. 
will  ensure  the  procurement  objectives  set  out  in Section B  of this  manual  are  realized  by the 
investees and represent best procurement practice. However, in setting the requirement that “FIL 
procurement is undertaken by the respective loan beneficiaries in accordance with established 
private sector or commercial practices, acceptable to ADB,” ADB recognizes that it may be in the 
interests  of  commercial  borrowers  of  ADB  funds  to  apply  these  principles  in  a  more  flexible 
manner than  as stipulated  in  ADB’s  detailed  procurement  guidelines  that  have been  designed 
with public procurement primarily in mind. 
D. 
Specific Guidance on FIL Procurement 
19. 
This  section  of  the  manual  builds  on  the  earlier  content  by  providing  some  specific 
guidance  to  investee  companies.  The  section  first  gives  guidance  on  how  generally  accepted 
procurement objectives might be best achieved and then considers each of the ADB procurement 
principles in turn and gives guidance on compliance. 
1. 
Ensuring the Procurement Results are Fit for Purpose 
20. 
For potential suppliers to provide equipment or goods or services that meet the needs of 
the purchaser, it is vital that purchasers clearly articulate their needs and expectations to those 
potential  suppliers.  Therefore,  appropriate  written  information  should  be  provided  to  potential 
suppliers. A good written specification of purchaser needs will enhance the prospects for those 
needs being successfully met and will also provide a basis for any procurement disputes to be 
adjudged and settled in a fair way. 
21. 
Feasibility  study  reports  will  need  to  be  prepared  and  approved  for  all  the  subprojects. 
These feasibility study reports will document the performance expectations of the Subproject and 
therefore,  it  is  important  that,  as  a  minimum,  these  expectations  are  included  in  relevant 
procurement specifications. 
22. 
For  the  procurement  of  key  equipment  and/or  civil  works  that  are  critical  to  the 
performance  of  the  subproject  then  the  procurement  documentation  should  include  a  more 
detailed design specification. This should be prepared by qualified technical staff in conjunction 
with procurement staff. 
23. 
For the procurement of services (such as technical support to assist the implementation 
of the subproject), it is important to ensure the potential service providers are suitably qualified, 
and that the scope of work and the required outputs/deliverables of the service provider are clearly 
defined. 
2. 
Achieving Value for Money 
24. 
Value for money (VFM) is normally considered to be achieved if the purchaser feels they 
have paid a fair price for what they have received. However, some would argue that VFM is only 
achieved if one pays the lowest available price. 
25. 
VFM  is  a  more  complex  concept  to  assess  than  simply  through  a  purchase  price 
comparison alone. For example, for an equipment purchase, the costs or downtime for equipment 
servicing, and the availability of spare parts may be important factors to the purchaser. Additional 
length of a performance guarantee (over and above anything specified by the purchaser) might 
also legitimately influence the purchaser to not purchase based on the cheapest price. If VFM is 
130 
Appendix 5 
to be  assessed  on  a scientific  basis  then a risk-based  approach over the  equipment  life cycle 
should be used, but even then, there will be subjectivity over matters, such as assessing the level 
of risk and the value of maintaining a long-lasting and trusted purchaser-supplier relationship. 
26. 
Specific guidance on making VFM judgments is as follows: 
(i) 
Consider what factors will affect the VFM judgment in advance of procurement and 
where possible include these into the product specification. Also, ask all potential 
suppliers  to  provide  supplementary  information  considered  relevant  to  the 
purchase  decision  in  addition  to  the  basic  supply  price  (e.g.,  response  time  to 
breakdowns, guarantee terms, service frequencies, downtime and costs, delivery 
periods and costs of spare parts). 
Establish  a  company  procurement  committee  to  evaluate  VFM  and  make 
procurement decisions as a means of reducing the individual subjectivity in VFM 
assessments. Ensure that records are kept of decisions made and the reasons for 
them,  so 
their 
that 
reasonableness. 
Use open procurement (see below) wherever possible so that the lowest available 
specification compliant price is known thus making the price premium paid for non-
quantifiable VFM factors readily identifiable. 
Only  use  sole  supplier  purchasing  where  either  (a)  an  existing  competitively  let 
rolling  supplier  contract  already  exist,  or  (b)  there  has  been  recent  similar 
procurement made via open procurement, or (c) extenuating circumstances apply 
that justify short-cutting normal procedures and company standing orders allow for 
this  (note:  such  a  situation  under  the  FIL  is  extremely  unlikely  and  such  short-
cutting is normally only justified in response to an emergency). 
independent  or  higher-level 
reviews  can  assess 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
3. 
Timeliness and Efficiency of Procurement 
For the procurement process to operate in a timely and efficient manner, the subproject 
27. 
will need to be planned and budgeted, so procurement activities are carefully scheduled to be 
compatible with the subproject implementation plan and that financial commitments can be met 
when due. 
28. 
It  follows  that  procurement  plans  should  (i)  be  linked  to  the  financial  plans,  (ii)  allow  a 
realistic time for the completion of individual activities, and (iii) as far as possible avoid a” log jam” 
of activity in the procurement department. 
29. 
Efficiency  of  procurement  will  be  achieved  where  (i)  companies  develop  standardized 
procedures  and  procurement  documentation,  (ii)  the  number  of  procurement  packages  are 
minimized  without  unduly  restricting  competitiveness,  (iii)  adopting  simplified  procurement 
procedures for small low value procurement, and (iv) the use of existing rolling annual or multi- 
year supplies of services and supplies for which a company has a regular demand. 
4. 
Use of Competitive Procurement 
30. 
Effective  competition  undoubtedly  reduces  prices  by  forcing  suppliers  to  innovate  and 
become more efficient. Purchasers will only be able to benefit from reductions that are available 
if they use procurement procedures based on competitive bidding or shopping. 
Competitive procurement is most achieved in a project setting through advertising and an 
31. 
open invitation for suppliers to request tender document and submit bids. 
Appendix 5 
131 
For some critical and specialist procurement packages a multi-stage procurement process 
32. 
may be advantageous whereby potential suppliers are first invited to pre-qualify by demonstrating 
they have the required skills and experience. Then all pre-qualified suppliers would be invited to 
submit bids. 
33. 
Preparing  bids  for  some  procurement  packages  can  impose  a  heavy  workload  and 
expense on potential suppliers, and this can discourage some good quality suppliers from bidding 
if they feel their chance of being successful is low. Purchasers can guard against the risks this 
situation  creates  restricting  the  number  of  suppliers  invited  to  bid  to  a  small  number  (typically 
three to five) of those most qualified to be the supplier. 
34. 
However,  before  deciding  on  the  detailed  procurement  procedures  to  use  they  should 
ensure investee companies should consult any applicable government laws and regulations on 
the procurement methods permissible in specific circumstances. This especially applies to state- 
owned enterprise (SOE) investee companies who will undoubtedly operate in a more regulated 
procurement environment than wholly private enterprises. 
5. 
Fairness and Equal Opportunity 
35. 
All eligible bidders should have an equal and fair opportunity. Procurement processes are 
designed and implemented that avoid preferential or discriminatory measures that might favor or 
adversely affect certain participants. 
36. 
Fairness and equal opportunity go hand in hand with procurement procedures that require 
open  competitive  bidding.  It  also  goes  hand  in  hand  with  transparency  in  procurement  (see 
below). 
37. 
Further measures to promote fairness and equal opportunity include: 
(i) 
Ensuring that potential suppliers have adequate time to submit bids or expressions 
of  interest  (the  actual  time  allowed  should  depend  on  the  complexity  of  the 
procurement and the level of detail requested in bids/expression of interest); 
The terms of purchase contracts used are equitable to both sides; 
The purchasing organization has a grievance redress mechanism (GRM) to deal 
with  cases  of  alleged  unfairness,  mis  procurement,  or  other  abuses.  This 
mechanism should operate to be independent of the purchasing function; and 
Subject  only  to  issues  of  commercial  confidentiality,  unsuccessful  bidders  may 
request and receive feedback on why they were unsuccessful. 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv)

Transparency in Procurement 
Transparency of procurement processes are those governed by clear rules that are easily 
38. 
accessible and can be consistently applied. This will show that the purchaser is fair and provides 
equal opportunity to all, as evidenced by their open and fair in procurement activity. 
Transparent  procurement  involves  contract  opportunities  (procurement  plans  and 
39. 
individual bid opportunities) being advertised widely, and results are published (or at least made 
available to the unsuccessful bidders). 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
Transparency in procurement has a few potential benefits to purchasers. 
Competition is increased. 
Suppliers can more readily identify the bids most suited to them allowing them to 
select  which  bids  to make  and  better  tailor  bids to meet the  purchaser’s needs.

Appendix 5 
From  the  purchaser  side  this  reduces  the  number  of  poor  quality  or  unqualified 
bids and should increase bid quality. 
They  gain  a  reputation  for  openness  and  fairness  in  how  their  businesses  are 
operated  and  if  they  practice  local  procurement  policies  (where  allowed  by 
applicable regulations) for the support they provide the local community. 
Open and transparent processes are less susceptible to abuse through fraud and 
corruption and such abuse is more likely to be detected.

Required Organizational Capacity and Arrangements 
The  investee  companies  need  to  assess  whether  they  possess  adequate  procurement 
40. 
capacity in terms of: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
(v) 
functional responsibilities; 
internal processes; 
resources and skills; 
information management; and 
experience and performance. 
41. 
For  the  selection  of  qualified  investees,  ADB  has  assessed  organizational  capacity  of 
proposed investee companies. The capacity building suggestions of these assessments may be 
of guidance to others and can be shared by contacting the Management Company for relevant 
guidance. 
42. 
If  investee  companies  conclude  it  is  uneconomical  to  build  the  required  internal 
procurement capacity, then they should consider recruiting the services of a procurement agent 
to fill the gap.
