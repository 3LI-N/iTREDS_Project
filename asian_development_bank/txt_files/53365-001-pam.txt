JFPR Project Administration Manual Purpose and Process 
1.  The  JFPR  project  administration  manual  (PAM)  describes  the  essential  administrative  and 
management  requirements  to  implement  the  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  (JFPR)-funded 
project on time, within budget, and in accordance with the government and Asian Development Bank 
(ADB) policies and procedures. The JFPR PAM should include references to all available templates 
and instructions either through linkages to relevant URLs or directly incorporated in the JFPR PAM. 
2.  The Department of the Renewable Energy (DRE) and Bhutan Power Corporation (BPC) are wholly 
responsible for the implementation of the project, as agreed jointly between the grant recipient and 
ADB, and in accordance with the Royal Government of Bhutan and ADB’s policies and procedures. 
ADB staff is responsible to support implementation including compliance by DRE and BPC of their 
obligations  and responsibilities  for  project  implementation  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  policies and 
procedures. 
3.  DRE, BPC and ADB shall agree to the JFPR PAM and ensure consistency with the grant agreement. 
In the event of any discrepancy or contradiction between the JFPR PAM and the grant agreement, 
the provisions of the grant agreement shall prevail. 
4.  After  ADB  Board  approval  of  the  project's  grant  assistance  report,  changes  in  implementation 
arrangements  are  subject  to  agreement  and  approval  pursuant  to  relevant  RGOB  and  ADB 
administrative  procedures  (including  ADB’s  Project  Administration  Instructions)  and  upon  such 
approval, they will be subsequently incorporated in the JFPR PAM.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
1. 
The  Alternative  Renewable  Energy  Pilot  Project  aims  to  demonstrate  viability  and 
sustainability  of  solar  power  as  an  alternative  energy  and  income  source  in  Bhutan  through:             
(i) conducting a study on regulatory requirements for alternative renewable energy resources and 
preparing a tariff structure for residential solar photovoltaic systems; (ii) assessing the adequacy 
of the national electricity grid and pilot-testing solar photovoltaic  systems in rural villages; and  
(iii)  enhancing  energy-based  livelihood  skills  through  vocational  education  and  energy-based 
livelihood  equipment  support.  The  project  has  strong  pro-poor,  socially  inclusive  and  gender-
sensitive features. The project will directly benefit 300 poor households in rural villages. 
2. 
This  project  aims  to  enable  the  Royal  Government  of  Bhutan  to  reduce  electricity 
subsidies, and the households to secure reliable and sustainable energy supply while providing 
an opportunity to generate income for the rural households. One of the important programs of the 
government’s  rural  poverty  alleviation  strategy  is  provision  of  a  lifeline  electricity  supply  to 
households  with  100%  subsidy  (Nu5.81/kWh,  2017–2019)  up  to  100  kilowatt  hour  (kWh)  of 
monthly  consumption  for  each  household.1 In  2018  alone,  Nu104.93  million  was  spent  by  the 
Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  as  subsidy  for  the  rural  electricity  supply,  which  is  a  significant 
component  of  the  annual  budget  allocation  for  the  energy  sector.2 Although  100%  subsidy  for 
electricity is aligned with poverty reduction efforts, it is not sustainable. Further, solar photovoltaic 
energy  supports  strong  gender  equality  and  social  inclusion  (GESI)  elements  by  improving 
income  generating  sources  through  solar  photovoltaic  power  trading  and  energy-based 
livelihoods with a focus on women.   
 The  proposed  project  is  included  in  the  country  operations  business  plan  (COBP)      
3. 
2020–2022 for Bhutan and is in line with 5 of the 7 operational priorities of ADB Strategy 2030 for 
addressing poverty reduction, accelerating gender equality, tackling climate change, promoting 
rural development and strengthening governance and institutional capacity. The impact is aligned 
with the energy security of the society enhanced by providing reliable and sustainable electricity 
supply  through  promotion  of  alternative  renewable  energy.  The  outcome  will  be  viability  and 
sustainability of solar power as an alternative energy and income source demonstrated in pilot 
rural villages. The project has three outputs which are described below. 
4. 
Output 1: Regulatory requirements for alternative renewable energy identified and 
a  tariff  structure  for  residential  solar  photovoltaic  systems  prepared.  RGOB  adopted  the 
Alternative  Renewable  Energy  Policy  in  2013  which  aims  to  promote  the  development  of 
alternative renewable energy resources, design appropriate tariffs and facilitate investment in the 
alternative  renewable  energy  sector.  To  implement  the  policy,  RGOB  needs  to  develop 
guidelines, rules, and regulations to accommodate alternative renewable energy sources in the 
existing power generation and trading system. The project will support a study on key regulatory 
and development issues associated with different alternative renewable energy technologies and 
recommendations on the design and implementation of pricing and other regulatory arrangements 
consistent  with  the  Policy  and  Electricity  Act  2001.  For the  pilot testing  of  the  residential  solar 
photovoltaic  systems,  an  indicative  tariff  structure  for  electricity  purchase  from  residential 
households will be prepared considering market price of solar photovoltaic systems, cost of the 
transportation and installation, economic benefits, and poverty alleviation aspects. Based on the 
experience in installations and operation under output 2, further recommendations on the tariff 
structure for residential solar photovoltaic system will be provided.

2   RGOB’s statistic in 2017 and 2018. It increased by 28% from the subsidy in 2017 which was Nu81.96 million.  
2 
Output 2: Small-scale solar photovoltaic system pilot tested. Technical adequacy of 
5. 
the grid will be assessed, and specifications and requirements for connecting solar photovoltaic 
systems to the grid will be identified. The grid connection is necessary as part of pilot testing solar 
photovoltaic systems, and purchase of excess electricity from the households under an indicative 
tariff  structure  is  proposed.  The  small-scale  solar  photovoltaic  systems  will  be  procured  and 
installed in 300 households in the rural villages selected based on Multidimensional Poverty Index 
(MPI),  geographical  and  atmospheric  conditions, 
technical  viability,  and  availability  of 
telecommunication3 and  other  infrastructures.  The  data  of  generation  and  consumption  profile 
throughout a year will be collected and analyzed. To mobilize pilot rural villages, an awareness 
campaign on benefit and limitation of the solar photovoltaic system and safe and efficient use of 
the electricity will be conducted.  
Output 3: Energy-based livelihood skills enhanced. A curriculum for solar photovoltaic 
6. 
system  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  will  be  developed.  Training  programs  on  solar 
photovoltaic  system  O&M  will  be  delivered  to  selected  villagers  and/or  Village  Electrical 
Entrepreneur  and  Electrical  Technician  (VEEET).  The number  of the trainees will  be  300,  and 
among them 30% will be women. Further, to maximize poverty reduction impact, energy-based 
livelihood  equipment  will  be  provided  with  the  required  skills  training  based  on  a  needs 
assessment to the villages benefitted from the solar photovoltaic systems. About 10 to 15 villages 
are  expected  to  be  provided  with  the  solar  photovoltaic  systems  and  at  least  10  units  of          
energy-based livelihood equipment will be installed.

The project will be implemented over a period of 4 years and 3 months from October 2020 
to December 2024. DRE will be the executing agency of the project, and a project management 
unit (PMU) will be established at DRE. DRE will also be the implementing agency responsible for 
outputs 1 and 3, while BPC will be the implementing agency for output 2. DRE will be responsible 
for disbursement of grant proceeds and preparation of audited project financial statement (APFS) 
covering  all  interventions.  A  project  steering  committee  led  by  DRE  will  convene  after  project 
approval with members from MOF, MOEA, BPC, and BEA. A consulting firm will be recruited to 
support the PMU’s project implementation. In addition, a project implementation analyst will be 
recruited for ADB’s project supervision, review, and monitoring with the administrative budget7 of 
JFPR.  Terms  of  References  for  the  consulting  firm  and  an  individual  consultant  have  been 
developed and attached to the PAM. 
8. 
Currently, there are 42 poorest villages identified based on the MPI. To ensure proximity 
of the target  project  sites, the  42  villages are  categorized  into 4  zones based  on their  locality. 
During  the  project  Implementation,  the  villages  will  be  further  shortlisted  and  among  4  zones, 
maximum of 2 will be selected with 10–15 villages for the solar photovoltaic system installation 
as per the selection criteria such as geographical and atmospheric condition, technical viability

and availability of the telecommunication and other infrastructures. The final selection criteria will 
be developed based on the site assessments to be carried out during project implementation. In 
the selected villages, solar photovoltaic systems and energy-based livelihood equipment will be 
provided.  Solar  photovoltaic  systems  will  be  installed  by  an  engineering,  procurement,  and 
construction contractor and ownership will be transferred to households. Bi-directional meters will 
be purchased, installed, and owned by BPC. For implementation of output 3, DRE with support 
from BPC will develop a curriculum on solar photovoltaic system O&M and deliver the training in 
consultation with Department of Technical Education (DTE). The trainings will be held at DTE’s 
or affiliated organization’s facilities around 10 times with 30 trainees per class. The selection of 
trainees will be based on socio-economic survey conducted during project implementation.

academic research, purchase of vehicles for project administration, salaries for civil servants, and 
foreign  travel,  scholarships  or  long  internships,  and  detailed  engineering.  RGOB  will  provide         
in-kind counterpart support, through executing agency and implementing agencies, in the form of 
project management (including project audit costs) and remuneration of counterpart staff, office 
space, furniture and equipment, general purpose vehicles for the project management unit, tax 
exemption and other required in-kind contributions for implementation. 
13. 
Administrative budget support. The project needs additional resources beyond those 
provided  by  the  regular  administration  budget  considering  the  complexity  of  the  project 
implementation. A project implementation analyst will be recruited for ADB’s project supervision, 
review, and monitoring. The detailed cost is provided in Table 6 for this purpose. Administrative 
budget  support  will  be  financed  from  the  JFPR  administrative  budget  separately,  not  from  the 
project grant of $3 million.

addition,  livelihood  skills  enhancement  activities  required 
lots  of  administrative  work  including  organizing  workshops 
from  ADB  as  well  as  executing  agency  and  implementing 
agencies. Due to remoteness and geographical hardness of 
the project sites, working days required for review mission 
would be longer than other projects, which needs teamwork 
and  support  from  the  consultant.  BHRM  has  grown  since 
2017 and established working units including a finance and 
administration unit, an economic and knowledge unit, and a 
project administration unit. However, it is still under-staffed 
to  digest  required  workload  and  address  requests  from 
project stakeholders.   
Type of work to be rendered by ADB 
In close coordination with the ADB project officer, executing 
agency,  implementing  agencies,  and  consulting  firm,  the 
consultant will oversee the grant’s financial transactions and 
maintain a financial management system in a manner that is 
compliant with generally accepted accounting principles and 
harmonized  with  ADB’s  policies  and  procedures  in  close 
coordination with concerned officers within ADB (e.g. SDPF, 
CTL, PPFD). The consultant will report to the ADB project

FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT10 
14. 
The  financial  management  assessment  (FMA)  was  conducted  in  November  2019 
following  ADB’s  Guidelines  for  the  Financial  Management  and  Analysis  of  Projects  (2005), 
Financial  Due  Diligence  Methodology  Note  (2009),  and  Financial  Management  Technical 
Guidance  Note  (2015).11 The FMA considered the  capacity  of  DRE  and BPC  as implementing 
agencies including funds flow arrangements, staffing, accounting and financial reporting systems, 
financial information systems, and internal and external auditing arrangements.  
15. 
DRE,  a  department  under  MOEA,  Bhutan  has  the  mandate  to  serve  as  the  central 
coordination  agency  and  the  focal  point  of  RGOB  on  all  matters  related  to  renewable  energy

development. DRE is classified as general government sector units (GGSU), which are primarily 
engaged in nonmarket operations (e.g., ministries and departments). Following the guideline, for 
GGSUs,  the  proposed  financial  management  arrangements  would  tend  to  adopt  the  country’s 
Public Financial Management (PFM) arrangements. 
16. 
BPC  has  the  mandate  of  distributing  electricity  throughout  the  country,  transmission 
access for generating stations for domestic supply and exports, and acts as the system operator. 
It purchases power generated by the Druk Green Power Corporation (DGPC) and sells the power 
to its customers through its transmission and distribution network. BPC, as a public corporation, 
its own financial management arrangements are assessed.  
Strengths.  Based  on  the  assessment,  DRE  and  BPC’s  financial  management  has  the 
17. 
following strengths and no significant weakness are identified:  
BPC 
(i)  Has significant experience in managing externally financed projects including ADB-funded 
projects and has qualified personnel who are familiar with the requirements for reporting, 
financial management and disbursement of ADB projects. 
(ii)  Has good corporate governance, complied with the statutory provision and proper board 
processes and compliance mechanism in place. 
(iii) Fixed  asset  and  inventory  register  are  properly  maintained  in  Enterprise  Resource 
Planning (ERP) system and the assets have been physically verified by the management 
in a phased/periodical manner. 
(iv) Robust risk management and internal control framework is in place. 
(v)  Effective human resource management by the management and board is in place based 
on strong manpower. 
(vi) Adequate and effective IT access management in the financial reporting process and ERP 
is fully functional. 
DRE 
(i)  Has experience in managing externally financed projects including ADB-funded projects 
and has qualified personnel who are familiar with the requirements for reporting, financial 
management and disbursement of ADB projects. 
(ii)  Equipped  with  effective  financial  reporting  and  monitoring  system  using  a  web-based 
government-wide software which is Public Expenditure Management System (PEMS). 
(iii) Finance section is staffed with qualified and experienced accountants. 
(iv) Effective budgetary planning and control are in place. 
(v)  Has improved transparency and government service through online grievance redressal 
system called “eKaaSel”. 
(vi) Robust external audit system and well-established supreme audit institution exists. 
18. 
The FMA reviewed two types of risks: (i) inherent risks (risks outside the direct control of 
the  DRE  and  BPC  financial  management)  and  (ii)  control  risks  (risk  concerning  the  internal 
functioning  and  control  of  the  DRE  and  BPC’s  finance  and  accounting  section).  Based  on  the 
assessment,  no  specific  risks  are  identified  to  hamper  the  achievement  of  project  outcomes 
and/or  outputs  and  hinder  effective  project  implementation.  Therefore,  it  is  concluded  that  the 
overall pre-mitigation financial management risk of DRE and BPC is moderate.

Funds Flow 
The government has issues with timely 
release of counterpart funds in other 
donor funded projects and this 
experience may be repeated with this 
project. 
Staffing 
MOEA/DRE will depute full-time accounts 
officer for this project, but all government 
accounting staff are centrally recruited 
and frequently rotated across ministries. 
Continuity in project management 
support may be disrupted if movement of 
account staff assigned to the project are 
frequent and delay project 
implementation. 
Accounting Policies and Procedures 
DRE prepares its accounts based on 
2016 Financial Rules and Regulations. 
These rules incorporate the latest trends 
in finance & accounts and are in line with 
the computerized Multi-year Rolling 
Budgets (MYRBS) and PEMS software.

While the country PFM systems 
are more robust than comparable 
countries, implementation of PFM 
Reforms Strategy 2017–2021 is 
still underway. 
The Royal Government of 
Bhutan, with World Bank support, 
is expected to establish a multi-
donor trust fund to support PFM 
reform program., Implementation 
progress will be monitored closely 
by the World Bank. ADB will 
closely coordinate with DRE to 
discuss emerging issues. 
DRE has good track record of 
implementing the projects from 
ADB and other multilateral donor 
agencies. 
Government counterpart support 
in this project will be in-kind and 
in the form of counterpart staff, 
and administrative support to 
avoid any potential delays in 
counterpart financing.  
There is a clear and systematic 
way of handing/taking overs that 
needs to be undertaken between 
the incoming and the moving out 
accounts officer. Also, the 
incoming finance personnel have 
similar experience to the 
transferred personnel and as 
such there are no major issues 
envisaged.

Advance  fund  procedure.  The  advance  account  will  be  opened  and  managed  by 
Department of Macroeconomic Affairs (DMEA), MOF. The currency of the advance account will 
be dollar. A signed withdrawal application for the advance account will be submitted to ADB by 
DRE  through  DMEA.  The  advance  fund  will  be  converted  to  local  currency  and  transferred  to 
DRE’s  sub-account  through  a  conduit  account  of  Department  of  Public  Accounts  (DPA),  MOF 
upon DRE’s request. It will take 3–5 working days for the fund to pass through the conduit account. 
In  case  of  reimbursement,  the  fund  will  be  transferred  by  ADB  to  the  Borrower’s  nominated 
account indicated on the withdrawal application. All withdrawal applications and payments under 
the project will be initiated by DRE. For expenses under output 2, BPC will verify and forward the 
invoices from consultants and contractors to DRE for payment. 
23. 
The total outstanding advance to the advance account should not exceed the estimate of 
JFPR’s  share  of  expenditures  to  be  paid  through  the  advance  account  for  the  forthcoming                
6 months. DRE may request for initial and additional advances to the advance account based on 
an estimate of expenditure sheet14 setting out the estimated expenditures to be financed through 
the account for the forthcoming 6 months. Supporting documents should be submitted to ADB or 
retained by DRE in accordance with ADB’s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended 
from time to time) when liquidating or replenishing the advance account. 
Statement  of  expenditure  (SOE)  procedure.15 The  SOE  procedure  may  be  used  for 
24. 
reimbursement of eligible expenditures or liquidation of advances to the advance account.  The 
ceiling of the SOE procedure is the equivalent of $100,000 per individual payment.  Supporting 
documents  and records for  the  expenditures  claimed  under  the  SOE  should  be maintained  by 
DRE and made readily available for review by ADB's disbursement and review missions, upon 
ADB's request for submission of supporting documents on a sampling basis, and for independent 
audit. Reimbursement and liquidation of individual payments more than the SOE ceiling should 
be supported by full documentation when submitting the withdrawal application to ADB. 
25. 
Before the submission of the first withdrawal application, the borrower should submit to 
ADB enough evidence of the authority of the person(s) who will sign the withdrawal applications 
on  behalf  of  the  government,  together  with  the  authenticated  specimen  signatures  of  each 
authorized  person.  The  minimum  value  per  withdrawal  application  is  US$20,000  equivalent.  
Individual payments below this amount should be paid: (i) by DRE and subsequently claimed to 
ADB  through  reimbursement  or  (ii)  through  the  advance  fund  procedure,  unless  otherwise 
accepted by ADB.

DRE  will  maintain,  or  cause  to  be  maintained,  separate  books  and  records  by  funding 
source for all expenditures incurred on the project by adopting the cash-based accounting system 
following the government’s financial regulations.  DRE will prepare consolidated project financial 
statements  in  accordance  with  the  government's  accounting  laws  and  regulations,  which  are 
consistent with international accounting principles and practices.

Auditing and Public Disclosure 
27. 
DRE  will  cause  the  detailed  consolidated  project  financial  statements  to  be  audited  in 
accordance with the International Standards for Supreme Audit Institutions, by an independent 
auditor  acceptable to ADB.  It  is  proposed  that, there  will  be  a  project  account created  only  by 
DRE. As such one audited project financial statement (APFS) covering entire project interventions 
will  be  prepared  and  submitted  to  ADB.  The  audit  of  the  project  financial  statements  will  be 
conducted by the Royal Audit Authority (RAA). The audited project financial statements together 
with the auditors’ opinion will be submitted in the English language to ADB within 6 months of the 
end of each fiscal year by the DRE.  
28. 
BPC  will  cause  the  entity-level  financial  statements  to  be  audited  in  accordance  with 
International Standards for Supreme Audit Institutions, by an independent auditor acceptable to 
ADB.  The  audited  entity-level  financial  statements,  together  with  the  auditors’  report  and 
management  letter,  will  be  submitted  in  the  English  language  to  ADB  within  1  month  after 
approval, but no later than 6 months from the end of each fiscal year, by the relevant authority.  
29. 
The annual audit report for the project accounts will include an audit management letter 
and audit opinions which cover: (i) whether the project financial statements present a true and fair 
view or are presented fairly, in all material respects, in accordance with the applicable financial 
reporting framework; (ii) whether loan and grant proceeds were used only for the purposes of the 
project or not; and (iii) the level of compliance for each financial covenant contained in the legal 
agreements for the project. 
Compliance with financial reporting and auditing requirements will be monitored by review

missions and during normal program supervision, and followed up regularly with all concerned, 
including the external auditor.  
The  government  and  DRE  have  been  made  aware  of  ADB’s  approach  to  delayed 
31. 
submission, and the requirements for satisfactory and acceptable quality of the audited project 
financial  statements.16 ADB  reserves  the  right  to  require  a  change  in  the  auditor  (in  a  manner 
consistent with the constitution of the borrower), or for additional support to be provided to the 
16 ADB approach and procedures regarding delayed submission of audited project financial statements:  
(i)  When audited project financial statements are not received by the due date, ADB will write to the executing 
agency  advising  that:  (i)  the  audit documents  are  overdue; and  (ii) if  they  are  not  received  within  the next             
6  months,  requests  for  new  contract  awards  and  disbursement  such  as  new  replenishment  of  advance 
accounts, processing of new reimbursement, and issuance of new commitment letters will not be processed. 
(ii)  When audited project financial statements have not been received within 6 months after the due date, ADB 
will withhold processing of requests for new contract awards and disbursement such as new replenishment of 
advance  accounts,  processing  of  new  reimbursement,  and  issuance  of  new  commitment  letters.  ADB  will                               
(i) inform the executing agency of ADB’s actions, and (ii) advise that the loan may be suspended if the audit 
documents are not received within the next 6 months. 
(iii)  When audited project financial statements have not been received within 12 months after the due date, ADB 
may suspend the loan.

32. 
Public  disclosure  of  the  project  financial  statements,  including  the  audit  report  on  the 
project financial statements, will be guided by ADB’s Access to Information Policy (2018).17 After 
review, ADB will disclose the project financial statements for the project and the opinion of the 
auditors on the financial statements within 14 calendar days of the date of their acceptance by 
posting them on ADB’s website. The audit management letter will not be disclosed.

Methods, Review and Procurement Plan 
39. 
Except  as  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  may  otherwise  agree,  the  following 
methods  shall  apply  to  procurement  of  goods,  works,  nonconsulting  services,  and  consulting 
services.  
Procurement of Goods, Works, and Nonconsulting Services  
Comments 
Method 
Open competitive bidding (OCB) with international 
advertising for goods 
Request for quotation for goods 
As there are not many contractors for solar 
photovoltaic systems within the country, 
international advertising is warranted. 
For energy-based livelihood equipment, ready-
made products can be purchased from local 
market. There are several well-known 
suppliers in the country. 
24 
Direct contracting for goods 
For electric meters, entire OCB process is less 
efficient, because less competition is expected 
for this small amount of package. 
For the update of the existing software, it 
should be done by the original supplier due to 
technical requirements. 
Method 
Comments 
Consulting Services 
Open competitive bidding with international 
advertising, using quality- and cost-based selection 
for consulting services 
One consulting firm is required to conduct a 
study and to assist the executing/implementing 
agency’s implementation. International 
advertising is warranted.

VII. 
SAFEGUARDS 
45. 
The  safeguard  categories  for  environment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous 
peoples  are  all  proposed  as  “C.”  The  project  has  only  one  physical  component,  which  is 
installation of the solar photovoltaic systems within the existing premises of the households. The 
project has a minimal or minor environmental impact and does not require any land acquisition. 
The  installation  of  residential  solar  photovoltaic  systems  is  not  included  in  the  list  of  activities 
published  by  National  Environment  Commission  (NEC)  requiring  environmental  clearance.  A 
safeguard  checklist  (Appendix  4)  has  been  developed  for  screening  and  selection  of  the 
households and sites. The PMU of the project will be responsible for screening locations based 
on  the  checklists  to  ensure  the  project’s  compliance  with  ADB’s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement 
(2009).  For  safety,  rooftop  structures  will  be  examined  to  check  its  solidity  and  presence  of 
asbestos  and  necessary  measures  will  be  taken  by  implementing  agencies  and  contractor  in 
accordance  with  the  safeguard  checklist.  The  project  activities  will  not  trigger  any  impact  on 
indigenous people. At the end of the life cycle of the solar photovoltaic system, it will be retrieved 
by DRE and will be handed over to the Department of National Properties (DNP) under MOF for 
disposal. For grievances redressal, DRE will provide the contact details of the nearest Electricity 
Service Division (ESD) under BPC which has offices in all 20 districts for any queries/questions 
regarding the project interventions. DRE will try to solve issues raised at the working level together 
with  BPC  engineers  and  technicians  and  escalate  the  issues  to  management,  if  required. 
Guideline  on  risks  of  and  prevention  measures  against  COVID-19  has  been  developed  and 
attached to the safeguard checklist.  
46. 
Climate  change  impact.  The  project  has  low  climate  change  risk  as  it  is  renewable 
energy pilot testing. The amount of climate change mitigation financed by ADB is $3 million. The 
21 in total 
total amount of the CO2 reduction is expected as 720tCO2 per annum or 14,401 tCO2
considering 20 years lifetime of the solar photovoltaic systems. 
21 Assumptions for calculation are 2 kW unit capacity, 300 number of households, 4.0 sun hours per day , 365days per 
year, 0.7%/year degradation of the solar photovoltaic system, and 20 years lifetime of the solar photovoltaic systems. 
Thus,  16,402  MWh  of  generation  is  expected  in  20  years.  In  Bhutan,  the  national  electricity  demand  is  met  by 
domestic generation of hydropower except for dry season and the excess energy has been exported to India through 
the  grid  connected.  Assuming  the  total demand in  Bhutan will  be  maintained,  it  is  fair to  assume  that  equivalent 
amount  of  electricity  with  the generation  from  this  project  will  be  additionally  exported  and  contribute  to  the  CO2 
reduction in India. During the dry season when the hydropower generation does not meet the demand in Bhutan, 
electricity has been imported from India. Thus, the solar photovoltaic system of this project will reduce the amount of 
electricity to be imported by replacing it with domestic generation by the solar photovoltaic systems. As the solar 
photovoltaic  generation  of  this  project  will  solely  contribute  to  the  increase  of  export  (other  than  dry  season)  or 
reduction of  import  (dry  season)  without  replacing  the  generation  of  hydropower  in  Bhutan,  using  India  emission 
factor (0.878 tCO2/MWh) for the project is justifiable, and 14,401 tCO2 of reduction is expected in 20 years.  
28 
Prohibited  investment  activities.  Pursuant  to  ADB’s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement 
47. 
(2009),  ADB  funds  may  not  be  applied  to  the  activities  described  on  the  ADB  Prohibited 
Investment Activities List set forth at Appendix 5 of the Safeguard Policy Statement (2009).  
VIII.  GENDER AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS 
48. 
Gender.  The  project  is  categorized  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming  and  a  gender 
action plan (GAP)  has  been  prepared.  The  persistent  poverty  in rural  areas  is  also caused  by 
labor-intensive unpaid care work of women. Women and girls in Bhutan, particularly in rural areas, 
shoulder  the  responsibility  for  many  of  the  household  work  such  as  cooking,  washing,  and 
cleaning.  This has  been  caused  by  high  level  of  household  workload and low  skill  sets  due  to 
limitations such as lack of reliable energy supplies and educational opportunities, among others. 
Having access to clean and efficient energy offers the potential to reduce the time and effort spent 
by women and girls on household work, which can have positive impacts not only on their health 
and level of educational attainment but can also enhance their economic opportunities. In project 
outputs  2  and  3,  the  project  stresses  on  ensuring  women’s  participation  in  the  design  and 
implementation of relevant activities, 50% women participation in awareness raising campaigns 
and  30%  women  participation  in  training  programs.  In  addition,  to  further  encourage  women 
participation  in  solar  photovoltaic  O&M  skills  training,  preferential  scoring  system  will  be 
established and included in trainee selection criteria.

B. 
Monitoring 
51. 
Project performance monitoring. Overall monitoring of each project component in terms 
of progress will be undertaken by the DRE and DRE will submit quarterly project progress report 
to  ADB.  These  quarterly  reports  will  provide  information  necessary  to  update  ADB's  project 
performance reporting system.23 In addition, ADB will undertake semi-annual review missions and 
provide guidance to the project director, the project PMU, and to project consultants. ADB  and 
DRE  will  regularly  monitor  the:  (i)  project  output  quality;  (ii)  implementation  arrangements;  (iii) 
implementation  progress;  and  (iv)  disbursements.  Performance  will  be  monitored  based  on 
indicators and targets stipulated in the design and monitoring framework.  
52. 
Compliance  monitoring.  The  grant  and  project  agreements  specify  undertakings  and 
covenants  that  will  be  monitored  through  regular  review  missions  and  on  a  quarterly  basis  in 
discussion with DRE and BPC. Compliance with undertakings and grant covenants, social and 
environmental safeguards, and financial and economic aspects will be jointly monitored by ADB 
and DRE. 
53. 
Safeguards  monitoring.  An  environment  and  social  safeguard  checklist  has  been 
developed for the project. ADB will ensure that the eligibility requirements are adhered to and the 
safeguard categorization is “C” for all installations.  
54. 
Gender  and  social  dimensions  monitoring.  The  compliance  with  labor  standards, 
health  and  gender  aspects  will  be  monitored  through  review  of  bidding  documents,  contract 
awards, and progress reports. 
C. 
Evaluation 
55. 
ADB will conduct regular semi-annual review missions to review, discuss progress, and 
report  on  the  project  performance.  A  midterm  review  will  be  carried  out  two  years  after 
effectiveness of the grant. Within 6 months of physical completion of the project, DRE will submit 
a project completion report to ADB.24 
D. 
Reporting 
56. 
The DRE will provide ADB with (i) quarterly progress reports in a format consistent with 
ADB's  project  performance  monitoring  including  the  status  of  grievance  redress  mechanism 
(GRM) implementation and the use of environment and social safeguard screening checklist; (ii) 
consolidated annual reports including (a) progress achieved by output as measured through the 
indicator's  performance  targets  against  the  baseline  data,  (b)  key  implementation  issues  and 
solutions, (c) updated procurement plan, and (d) updated implementation plan for next 12 months; 
and (iii) a project completion report within 6 months of physical completion of the project. Financial 
and  disbursement  information,  variance  analysis  of  physical  and  financial  progress,  details  of 
utilization of funds and reconciliation with ADB loan financial information system (LFIS) should be 
included  in  the  quarterly  progress  report  and  be  reviewed  periodically  by  the  team.  The 
consolidated project financial statements and BPC audited financial statements, together with the 
associated  auditor's  report,  will  also  be  adequately  reviewed.  DRE,  as  the  project  executing 
23 ADB's project performance reporting system is available at:

ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISM 
59. 
People  who  are,  or may  in the  future  be,  adversely  affected  by the  project  may  submit 
complaints  to  ADB’s  Accountability  Mechanism.  The  accountability  mechanism  provides  an 
independent forum and process whereby people adversely affected by ADB-assisted projects can 
voice,  and  seek  a  resolution  of  their  problems,  as  well  as  report  alleged  violations  of  ADB’s 
operational  policies  and  procedures.  Before  submitting  a  complaint  to  the  accountability 
mechanism, affected people should make a good faith effort to solve their problems by working 
with  the  concerned  ADB  operations  department.  Only  after  doing  that,  and  if  they  are  still 
dissatisfied, should they approach the accountability mechanism.27

JAPAN FUND FOR POVERTY REDUCTION 
GUIDANCE NOTE ON JAPANESE VISIBILITY 
Introduction  
The Revised Operating Framework for the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) was 
approved on 6 October 2009, combining Japan’s project grant and technical assistance 
support under one umbrella, and paving the way for a more comprehensive approach to 
the  use  of  these funds  towards  addressing  poverty,  building  up  human  resources,  and 
empowering institutions and communities in the region. Japan has been making generous 
contributions for technical assistance activities through the Japan Special Fund, and for 
poverty reduction projects through JFPR, since they were established in 1988 and 2000, 
respectively. It is but fitting and proper that said contributions are acknowledged and the 
recipients and general public are informed of the source of the funding assistance both at 
the Fund level and at the level of the individual TA and project grants. The purpose of this 
note  is  to  provide  guidance  on  measures  to  ensure  that  the  contribution  of  Japan  in 
supporting JFPR is widely recognized.1

TERMS OF REFERENCE 
ALTERNATIVE RENEWABLE ENERGY PILOT PROJECT 
1.1   Background 
1. 
The Royal Government of Bhutan requested ADB’s assistance to pilot test the installation 
of small-scale solar photovoltaic systems to the marginalized rural households and integrate them 
to the national grid. This will enable rural households to produce energy for their own consumption 
and  RGOB to  reduce  electricity  subsidies,  while  also  lessening  electricity  import  during  winters 
when solar radiation is at its peak. For the proposed intervention, ADB applied for $3 million grant 
financing from Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR), and it was approved by the Government 
of Japan on 20 August 2020.  
2. 
This project pursues to enable the RGOB to reduce budget for expenditure on electricity 
subsidies,  and  the  households  to  secure  reliable  and  sustainable  energy  supply  and  generate 
income by selling power to enhance their livelihoods. An important program of the government’s 
rural  poverty alleviation strategy  is  a  provision  of  a  lifeline  electricity  supply  to  households  with 
100% subsidy (Nu5.81/kilowatt hour (kWh), 2017–2019) up to 100 kWh of monthly consumption 
for each household.1 In 2018 alone, Nu104.93 million was spent by the Ministry of Finance (MOF) 
as subsidy for the rural electricity supply, which is a significant component of the annual budget 
allocation  for  the  energy  sector.2 Although  100%  subsidy  for  electricity  is  aligned  with  poverty 
reduction efforts, it is not sustainable. Further, solar photovoltaic energy supports strong gender 
equality and social inclusion (GESI) elements by improving income generating sources through 
solar photovoltaic power trading and energy-based livelihoods with a focus on women.  
3. 
The  Alternative  Renewable  Energy  Pilot  Project  aims  to  demonstrate  viability  and 
sustainability  of  solar  power  as  an  alternative  energy  and  income  source  in  Bhutan  through:              
(i) conducting a study on regulatory requirements for alternative renewable energy resources and 
preparing a tariff structure for residential solar photovoltaic systems; (ii) assessing the adequacy 
of the national electricity grid and pilot-testing solar photovoltaic systems in rural villages; and  (iii) 
enhancing  energy-based  livelihood  skills  through  vocational  education  and  energy  based 
livelihood  equipment  support.  The  project  has  strong  pro-poor,  socially  inclusive  and  gender-
sensitive features. The project will directly benefit 300 poor households in rural villages. 
4. 
For  the  interventions,  the  Department  of  Renewable  Energy  (DRE)  plans  to  hire  an 
international  consulting  firm  to  assist  the  project  management  unit  (PMU)  to  implement  project 
components  under  the  grant.  The  international  consulting  firm  has  experience  of  implementing 
similar  initiatives  for  at  least  5  years  with  access  to  international  and  national  experts  and 
specialists required for the different outputs. Experience in developing member countries in the 
region is desirable.  
1.2   Objective of the Assignment 
5. 
The key objective of the assignment is to implement the planned activities under the JFPR 
grant in line with international best practices and as described in grant assistant report (GAR) and 
provide required deliverables.  
The assignment is expected to commence in the first quarter of 2021 and will continue until

Appendix 4 
I.   Overview 
1.  
Objectives  
C.  GUIDELINE FOR COVID 19  
•  This guideline is designed with a set of procedures and actions to prevent and contain the 
spread of novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) in public and multi-purpose facilities.  
•  Examples  of  public  facilities:  schools,  workplaces,  facilities  for  youths  and  families, 
daycare centers, kindergartens, social welfare facilities, postnatal care centers, medical 
institutions, etc.  
•  Examples of multi-purpose facilities: performance halls, sports facilities, religious facilities, 
shopping malls (large-scale retail stores, markets, department stores, etc.), movie theaters, 
large-scale restaurants, public bathhouses, etc.  
•  This  guidance  outlines  the  strategies  and  actions  that  will  be  implemented  by 
representatives or managers  of  the  above-mentioned  facilities  (hereinafter  “managers”) 
for effective prevention and control of COVID-19 within their facilities. 
Characteristics of COVID-19 
Symptoms  
•  The  symptoms  of  COVID-19  are  fever,  fatigue,  cough,  shortness  of  breath,  pneumonia,  severe 
acute respiratory syndromes, etc. Most infected people experience mild symptoms, but those with 
underlying health conditions are likely to be at higher risk of developing a severe illness.  
• Other symptoms include sore throat, headache, phlegm, hemoptysis, nausea, and diarrhea.  
Mode of Transmission  
•  Droplets:  Respiratory  droplets  (saliva)  produced  when  a  person  infected  with  COVID-19  coughs  or 
sneezes  allow  the  virus  to  infiltrate  another  person’s  mucous  membranes  in  the  respiratory  system, 
thereby causing the infection. 
• Contact: When droplets produced by an infected person land on objects, surfaces, etc., the virus 
can be transmitted to those who touch these objects or surfaces with their hands and then touch 
their eyes, nose, mouth, and other body areas.  
Transmission characteristics  
(1) COVID-19 is highly contagious and can be transmitted even at early stages of infection with mild 
symptoms.  
(2) The scale of transmission can become much larger when people come into close contact with each 
other in confined spaces. 
2.  
Guiding Principles  
•  Managers of public and multi-purpose facilities where a large number of people gather or 
stay  should  follow  and  implement  “a  National  Preparedness  and  Response  Plan  for 
Outbreak  of  COVID-19  (National  Plan  for  COVID  -19) 51    as  well  as  a  coordination 
mechanism with relevant agencies.  
•  Measures must be implemented to protect employees, users, and visitors from COVID-
19, enhance early detection of the disease, and prevent community transmission.  
51 https://www.cabinet.gov.bt/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/National-Preparedness-and-Response-Plan-3rd-ed-1-1.pdf. 
Appendix 4 
 55
•  Specific  measures  include  ensuring  good  hygiene  practices,  and  routine  cleaning, 
disinfection, and ventilation; improving working conditions; regularly monitoring for fever 
and other symptoms; excluding individuals with such symptoms from work.  
•  Any  confirmed  case  must  be  immediately  reported  to  a  local  public  health  center  and 
necessary measures must follow suit to prevent further contraction. 
II.  
1.  
Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Countermeasures 
Establishment of a COVID-19 management and coordination mechanism  
•  Facilities should follow and implement National Plan for COVID-19, and to  this purpose, 
facilities should designate specific persons who are responsible for COVID-19 infection 
control  (called  “Inspection  Manager”)  in  order  to  ensure  accountability  in  disease 
prevention and mitigation efforts.  
•  Also,  it  is  highly  advised  for  facilities  to  assign  responsibilities  to  monitor  employees’ 
symptoms,  file  reports  of  confirmed  cases,  locate  hygiene  supplies  in  facilities,  etc.  to 
specific persons.  
It  is  essential  that  facilities  install  and  maintain  a  COVID-19  emergency  hotline  with 
relevant agencies (i.e. public health centers and medical institutions) for an effective and 
imminent  response  to  possible  and  probable  COVID-19  cases  and  other  emergency 
situations.  
• 
2.  
Thorough management for infection prevention  
Education and promotion for effective prevention 
•  Facilities  should  provide  their  employees,  users,  and  visitors  with  information  about 
COVID-19  and  conduct  education  sessions  on  the  code  of  conduct  on  proper 
handwashing, cough etiquette, etc.  
It is necessary to notify facility users and visitors that their access to the facilities can be 
limited  if  they  have  a  fever  or  respiratory  symptoms  and  display  such  notification  in 
common areas.  
• 
•  Also  important  is  to  exhibit  a  set  of  promotional  materials  in  common  areas  within  the 
facilities, including precaution guidelines for prevention of COVID-19 transmission, which 
cover handwashing, cough etiquette, etc.  
Hygiene and environmental management 
•  Facilities should place hand wash, such as liquid soaps and hand sanitizers (containing 
at least 70% alcohol), paper towels, etc. in sufficient quantity on sinks (those with non-
manual faucets, etc. preferred) in restrooms and other areas in the facilities.  
•  Waste  baskets  and  trash  cans  should  be  placed  at  several  locations  in  the  facilities to 
allow the immediate disposal of tissues used for coughing.  
•  Cleaning,  disinfection,  and  ventilation  should  be  increased  in  common  areas  within 
facilities, commuter buses, dormitories, etc. 
•  Particular attention should be paid to enhance disinfection for areas and objects* that are 
frequently touched with hands.  
•  As to door handles, handrails, various touch devices, desks, tables, chairs, telephones, 
and  computer  keyboards,  disinfection  must  be  implemented  at  least  once  a  day,  while 
entrance doors, elevators and similar public-using objects should be disinfected on a more 
frequent basis.  
•  Also, it is necessary to regularly purify air and ventilate in the facilities.  
56 
Appendix 4 
3.  
Strengthening management of employees, users and visitors  
•  Facilities must conduct temperature checks for fever at entry points and in the office.  
•  Temperature  and  respiratory  symptom  screening  of  employees  and  others  should  be 
conducted twice a day.  
•  For facility users and visitors, temperature checks should be offered when they enter the 
facilities.  
•  A  list  of  users  and  visitors  which  contains  their  personal  details,  contact  information, 
temperature check results, etc. should be kept at the facilities.  
•  Employees or users who have fever or respiratory symptoms should not be permitted to 
work or use the facilities.  
•  Workers with a fever or respiratory symptoms will stay at home and refrain from contacting 
others or leaving home.  
•  No employee who recently travelled overseas will be permitted to work in office for three 
weeks and working from home (or telecommuting) and other cautionary measures should 
be recommended.  
•  Example: A person who entered Bhutan on March 6 will be prohibited from work in office 
until March 27 (21 days from the day of arrival).  
•  Children's absence from daycare centers, kindergartens, schools, etc. will be processed 
as attendance, and isolated children should be provided with temporary daycare. Other 
measures should be followed as needed.  
•  When  staying  at  home,  employees  should refrain  from  making  contact  with  others  and 
going  outside  the  house  and  keep  monitoring  themselves  for  any  fever  or  respiratory 
symptoms.  
•  Employers or facility managers should grant leave or other forms of relief to workers who 
are excluded from work and ensure that these workers face no disadvantage.  
•  Employers,  facility  managers  and  others  in  relevant  positions  should  actively  provide

Support Requirements  
Procurement capability and 
capacity 
As and when there is a project, Department of Renewable Energy 
(DRE) creates a specific project management unit (PMU) team to carry 
out all the project activities including the procurement. In addition, we 
have access to the skills and expertise of the Ministry’s procurement 
officials.  
Within Bhutan Power Corporation (BPC), a dedicated team has been 
formed to deliver the project with expertise in procurement, monitoring 
and implementing the project.  
BPC has experience in tendering and procurement related to Japan 
International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and ADB funded projects as 
per their rules and guidelines.

To avoid potential procurement risks, prior review of all contract 
packages should be considered by ADB. 
Most of the Projects carried out by DRE are ADB funded e.g. RREDP 
0228, ACEF, Energy Plus, Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) 
9158. Therefore, DRE have enough experience in implementing ADB 
funded projects.   
BPC has implemented rural electrification project funded by JICA and 
ADB. BPC has also implemented the wind power project and JFPR 
9158 project funded by ADB.  However, it is noted that the previous 
ADB funded projects followed ADB Procurement Guidelines (2015).  
Therefore, further training / support for the executing 
agency/implementing agency staff to conduct procurement activities 
under New Procurement Framework following ADB Procurement Policy 
(2017, as amended from time to time) / Procurement Regulations for 
ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time) should be 
considered by ADB. 
As mentioned above, DRE has executed and implemented all the 
previous ADB and other donor funded projects without any issues. The 
RGOB has a clear set of rules & regulations for procuring such 
works/consultancy which DRE is very familiar with. In addition, the DRE 
is also well versed in the relevant ADB guidelines for procuring such 
works/activities. 
A project team (Renewable Energy Division in BPC) exists to oversee 
the implementation of the project including contract management and 
implementation however no contract management plan has been 
produced. The team has previous experience in delivering similar 
procurements and handling similar projects. The pilot wind power 
project was also handled by the same team.  
DRE is the nodal agency of the RGOB which oversees and administers 
all the plans and policies regarding the promotion and development of 
renewable energy technologies in the country. The department is also 
responsible for outlining the long-term plans, policies, guidelines for 
setting out the overall national targets on the renewable energy front. 
Most of the aforesaid activities are carried out through International 
consultants while we also endeavour to entrust whatever is doable in-
house to our national firms. 
BPC being a profit-making company and one of the highest revenue 
contributors to the government, it has a minimum reliance on external 
consultants regarding the energy business (distribution, transmission, 
and embedded generation system). 
DRE has a clear mechanism to handle any complaints/grievances. At 
department level, the complaints will be brought out to PMU level which 
if cannot be resolved will be put up to the Director, DRE who will bring it 
in the departmental committee meeting. If the issue is still unresolved at 
the department level, it will then be directed to the ministerial committee 
where an amicable solution could be reached.  
Complaints can also be logged with RGOB’s Anti-Corruption 
Commission and settled as arbitration in accordance with the laws of 
Bhutan. 
Any unresolved grievances could be also taken up in the court of law for 
final arbitrations.

C.  
Key Procurement Conclusions 
DRE and BPC have procurement experience in ADB financed projects under ADB Procurement 
Guidelines (2015) for rural electrification projects and the pilot wind power projects. The project team is 
aware of the ADB’s loan and grant disbursement and information system along with ADB’s payment 
methods and withdrawal application system.  
A dedicated team has been formed to deliver the project with expertise in procurement and work 
monitoring. There is wide range and depth of experience across not only the Procurement team but also 
delivering similar projects. 
To avoid potential procurement risks, prior review of all contract packages is recommended and should 
be considered by ADB. BPC has a standard procurement manual and guidelines for any procurement 
related to distribution and transmission works. Any pilot projects shall be given in EPC basis depending 
upon the past work experience of the bidders and success history of their brand of the solar panels and 
equipment. In addition, training / support for the executing agency/implementing staff to conduct 
procurement activities under New Procurement Framework following ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as 
amended from time to time) / Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time 
to time) should be considered by ADB. 
D.  
External Influences Analysis 
Governance 
●  There is a stable central and local government environment for 
Economic 
this project to operate within. 
●  There is a strong and established oversight and governance 
structures that oversees both national and international 
procurement. 
●  There is a strong integrity pact established by Anti-Corruption of 
Bhutan that needs to be followed for any procurements 
●  The project is delivered in an area which has no conflict. 
The economic environment presents a predictably stable environment 
for the life of the project. 
Economic Growth – Economic growth is high. At current prices, the 
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of Bhutan stands at about Nu. 
164,627.92 million in 2017‒ 2018. The GDP (in Nu) of Bhutan grew at 
the rate of 4.63% in 2017‒2018, though it is envisaged to be 2.4% in 
2020 due to COVID-19 pandemic. 
Inflation – Inflation rose moderately to 2.7 % in June 2019 from 2.6% 
in June 2018. It is envisaged to be 2.8% in 2020. Domestic CPI 
inflation over the medium term is projected at 4.7%, remaining within 
the range of Indian inflation target of 4 percent with a band +/-2 
percent. 
Unemployment –Bhutan has an overall unemployment rate of 3.4% 
as of 2018. 
Exchange Rate–The Bhutanese Ngultrum is relatively 
stable/predictable and is pegged with the Indian Rupee. The import 
component to the project from other third countries is low. 
Labor Supply–Unskilled labor is relatively low cost and in supply. 
Skilled labor needs to be hired from other countries. 
Sustainability 
Technology 
Appendix 5 
63 
Climatic Change and Impact – Climate Change (CC) will have 
minimal impact on this project. This project would in fact support and 
promote the RGOB’s effort in the mitigation of CC impacts, especially 
by way of curtailing firewood consumption through providing reliable 
electricity supply to the people. 
Waste Disposal and Recycling Capabilities – Waste disposal scheme 
is in place regulated by the government  
Local Environmental Standards – Strict standards and monitoring 
systems are in place which require adherence.   
Environmental Impact and Remedies – Potential impacts are 
mostly temporary, predictable, and reversible on air, water, soil and 
noise during construction period, and can be mitigated through 
adherence to national regulations and ADB’s Safeguard Policy 
Statement (2009), design criteria, and implementation of 
Environmental Management Plan. 
All the invoices/bills related to the procurement shall be through the 
government’s EGP system. Project system module in EGP system 
shall be used to monitor the financial and physical progress of the 
project. Smart meters and optic fiber shall be used to monitor the 
generation, consumption, and injection of the energy from solar 
photovoltaic systems remotely. Net metering technology shall be 
used for energy accounting purposes. 
Manufacturing – Absence of a domestic manufacturing base in the 
country will entail us importing all the materials/ equipment from other 
countries. 
E.  
Key Procurement Conclusions 
The external influences that could affect this project are low. There is a strong central and local government 
environment for the project to operate and a strong oversight and governance framework in place. 
Due to the need to import the materials and equipment from outside of the country there is some risk from 
exchange rate fluctuations and supply, but these will be minimal due to the low value of the pilot project.

Section 3: Market Analysis 
A.  
Porter’s Five Forces 
Supply and installation of 300 residential solar photovoltaic systems 
Competitive rivalry 
There are several contractors in the international and domestic market to 
bid for the supply and installation of 300 residential solar photovoltaic 
systems packages such as: 
●  Trina Solar – PRC 
●  Jinko Solar - PRC 
●  Vikram Solar – India 
●  Sunrun - US 
●  Vivint Solar - US 
●  Panasonic – Japan 
●  Hanwha Solar – Korea 
●  SunPower – US 
●  Canadian Solar – Canada 
●  Jattu Solar – Dealer (Bhutan) 
Bargaining power of 
buyers 
Bargaining power of 
suppliers 
Risk of new entrants 
The bargaining power of buyer is medium as although there are multiple 
suppliers in the market the relatively low value of the packages may 
affect interest levels from suppliers.  
All would be interested in taking up projects in Bhutan on EPC basis with 
project worth above $1 million. The bargaining power of suppliers is 
medium due to the number of possible suppliers who can deliver the 
work on EPC basis.  
Risk of new entrant would be unlikely to impact the market significantly. 
Risk of substitutes 
There is a low risk of substitutes.

Itron – America 
There are several contractors in the international market to bid for the 
packages such as: 
• 
•  Secure - India 
•  Actaris – India 
•  Siemens – Germany 
The bargaining power of buyers is medium due to the relatively low value 
of the package. 
The bargaining power of suppliers is medium due to the number of 
possible suppliers who can deliver the work in EPC basis. 
Risk of new entrant would be unlikely to impact the market significantly. 
There is a low risk of substitutes. 
Supply of Energy Based Livelihood Equipment 
Competitive rivalry 
The equipment is small and off the shelf, there are many local suppliers in 
the market who be willing to provide quotations. 
Appendix 5 
69 
Bargaining power of 
buyers 
Bargaining power of 
suppliers 
Risk of new entrants 
The bargaining power of buyer is high considering that there are multiple 
suppliers. 
The bargaining power of suppliers is low due to the huge number of suppliers 
who can deliver the equipment.  
There will be new entrants, but the risk is low as this is small contract. 
Risk of substitutes 
There is a low risk of substitutes. 
B.  
Key Procurement Conclusions 
Overall, there is considerable interest from the market for supply of both the solar equipment, software 
and livelihood supplies. The relatively low value of the procurement items may increase the supply risk 
somewhat. 
To combat these risks, bid packaging must be carefully considered to ensure maximum attraction of the 
bid to interested suppliers. 
As most goods will be sourced from outside of Bhutan, packages must be advertised internationally to 
ensure maximum exposure to interested suppliers. 
C. 
Supply Positioning 
For  all  packages  to  be  procured  under  this  project,  all  suppliers  would  fall  into  the  tactical 
acquisition  category.  Whilst  the  various  packages  are  low  in  value,  as  this  is  a  pilot  project, 
70 
Appendix 5  
suppliers should be interested in providing the services due to the possibility of a larger project 
being procured after successful pilot implementation. 
E.  
Supplier Preferencing 
For most of the packages in this project the suppliers would be positioned in the develop category. 
As previously mention, as this is a pilot project, whilst the revenue would be relatively small for 
the supply market, there would be a reasonably high level of attractiveness due to the potential 
for future business. 
For  the  equipment  category,  as the  goods  are  routine and off  the  shelf,  they  may  fall  with the 
nuisance category, however due to the high number of suppliers this poses little risk to project 
delivery.

Appendix 5 
75 
A.  Option Analysis 
Package 
Solar photovoltaic 
system 
Option 
Procurement Method 
1.  OCB with 
international 
advertisement 
2.  Merit-point 
evaluation 
Bidding Documents 
1. Goods 
2. Plant 
Analysis 
This is the standard competitive bidding procedure which 
results in optimum transparency. 
This procedure introduces competition among bidders and 
make the bidders to propose the lowest rate or proper 
market rate.  
As the solar photovoltaic technology is mature and has 
been widely adopted, certain quality can be assured by 
preparing bidding documents with proper technical 
requirements. Also considering that there are enough 
potential suppliers, there are no disadvantages in using 
OCB method. 
Merit-point evaluation criteria for goods & works contracts 
is like QCBS on consulting service contracts. Instead of 
selecting the lowest price bidder, the executing agency 
may select a bidder that offers better quality at higher price 
based on the merit-point evaluation criteria.  
However, the executing agency must spend additional time 
to prepare detailed evaluation criteria for merit point 
evaluation and to evaluate the proposals submitted by the 
bidders.  
This evaluation method ensures that the executing agency 
will receive the highest quality product whilst still achieving 
a competitive price. 
The executing agency may consider using the standard 
bidding documents (SBD) for plant due to the installation 
component. However, as the installation may be simple 
and shares a small proportion of the contract, the SBD for 
goods can be used. 
Preferred option: 
Department of Renewable Energy (DRE) and Bhutan Power Corporation (BPC) have experience in 
procurement of facility, equipment, and goods with OCB under ADB projects, and are familiar with this 
option. This will also save project implementation time compared with the other option, while the timespan 
is one of the challenges of the project implementation. The use of merit-point evaluation will balance 
quality with cost maximizing value for money. However, the solar photovoltaic market is homogeneous 
and competitive. The technical and/or geographical challenges of the project will be addressed through 
village selection criteria and the conditions in the bidding document. OCB is the preferred option using 
the SBD for goods with installation services.  
Package 
Bi-directional electric 
meter 
Option 
1.  OCB 
2.  RFQ 
Analysis 
This is the traditional and most prevail procurement method 
and transparent in terms of procedure.  
Considering the low value of the package, RFQ would be 
an option to make the process more efficient. 
76 
Appendix 5 
3.  Direct 
contracting  
The amount of the package is less than 100,000, it is 
eligible for the direct contracting.  
Preferred option: 
The project requires only 300 meters. To procure this small amount through OCB is not preferable as (i) 
there may be less or no competition as not many suppliers are expected to be attracted to this small 
package, and (ii) it is not efficient to go through all procedures spending much resource and time for this 
small package. Furthermore, as some customizations are required for the meters to make them 
compatible to the implementing agencies’ existing metering system, lower price is not expected from 
other suppliers than the current supplier for this small package. Under the circumstances, direct 
contracting, with due diligence in the assessment of the reasonability of the offered prices and eligibility of 
the supplier (Secure Meters Limited), is the most preferred option.   
Package 
Software upgrade 
Option 
Direct contracting 
Package 
Energy-based 
livelihood equipment 
Option 
1.  RFQ 
2.  Direct 
contracting 
Analysis 
The amount of the contract is very small, which is $25,000, 
and this is upgrading the existing software currently used 
by the BPC to add some functions for collecting data from 
bi-directional meters and integrating it to the existing billing 
system. Only the supplier who provided the existing 
software system can upgrade it without any interface issue. 
Direct contracting is considered only one option. 
Analysis 
The amount of the contract is very small which is $25,000. 
As there have been country wide activities undertaken by 
the Ministry of Agriculture and Forest in Bhutan, the market 
is mature and there are several well know suppliers in the 
country.  
This is eligible for direct purchase however it may cause 
the executing agency a problem in terms of reputation and 
fairness, the executing agency is not keen to this option for 
the package.  
Preferred option: 
To seek competition among the several suppliers in the market and to encourage them to proposed 
adequate market price with proper orientation, RFQ is more suitable and preferred option.   
ADB = Asian Development Bank, OCB = open competitive bidding, QCBS = quality- and cost-based selection,

Except as the Asian Development Bank (ADB) may otherwise agree, the following methods shall 
apply to procurement of goods, works, nonconsulting services, and consulting services.  
Procurement of Goods, Works and Nonconsulting Services  
Method 
Comments 
Open competitive bidding with international advertising for 
goods 
Request for quotation for goods 
Direct contracting for goods 
As there are not many contractors for solar 
photovoltaic systems within the country, international 
advertising is warranted. 
For energy-based livelihood equipment, ready-made 
products can be purchased from local market. There 
are several well know suppliers in the country. 
For electric meters, entire OCB process is less 
efficient, because less competition is expected for 
this small amount of package. 
For the update of the existing software, it should be 
done by original supplier due to technical 
requirements. 
Consulting Services 
Method 
Open competitive bidding with international advertising, using 
quality- and cost-based selection for consulting services with 
90:10 ratio. 
Comments 
One consulting firm is required to conduct a study 
and to assist the executing agency/implementing 
agencies implementation. International advertising is 
warranted.
