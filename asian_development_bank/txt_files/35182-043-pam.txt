PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
Indonesia is highly prone to flooding due to its climate and topography.1 Flooding, which 
1. 
occurs annually in most of the country, has been increasing in frequency, causing as much as 
$430 million in economic losses per year.2 During 2003–2015 average annual flood impacts have 
included: 1.58 million people per year affected; 223,000 homes completely or partially damaged; 
and 168,000 hectares (ha) of crops inundated.3 The floods sever vital transport arteries and often 
disrupt  access  to  ports  and  airports,  restricting  the  transfer  of  goods  and  services.  In  2013, 
Ciujung river flooding affected 19,674 households, displaced 50,527 people, and disrupted traffic 
along the Jakarta–Merak toll road that connects Java to Sumatra island.4 Despite its location in a 
drier region, in 2013 Ambon suffered from flash floods resulting in: the destruction of 59 homes, 
and  damage  to  45  others;  and  10  deaths,  5  missing  persons,  and  7,212  displaced  people 
(footnote 4). 
Flood  impacts  have  worsened  since  1980.  Deforestation  and  inappropriate  agricultural 
2. 
practices - which result in erosion and increased sediment loads in waterways5- are reducing the 
capacity  of  rivers  to  accommodate  higher  peak  flows  caused  by  intense  rainfall.  Expanding 
population  combined  with  inadequate  spatial  planning  and  land  management  has  led  to 
substantial  development  in  flood-prone  areas,  escalating  flood  damage  to  life  and  property. 
Urbanization, and particularly associated road construction and surfacing, reduces the vegetated 
area that would normally absorb rainwater, resulting in greater peak flood flows.6 The government 
agencies  ability  to  optimize  flood  management  capacity  and  effectiveness  is  limited  by  weak 
hydrological data acquisition and management, and flood forecasting and climate risk modeling; 
and the lack of coordinated decision-making among government agencies. Insufficient investment 
in and neglected operation and maintenance (O&M) of flood protection infrastructure accentuate 
the  adverse  impacts  of  floods.7  In  the  absence  of  appropriate  awareness  and  preparedness, 
communities remain highly vulnerable to and at greater risk of loss of life and assets from more 
frequent and intense floods. 
3. 
Climate change impacts include the increasing frequency of intense rainfall and rising sea 
levels, and are expected to further exacerbate flood risk.8 The impacts of intense and frequent 
flood events combined with the lack of economic and social capital to manage and respond to 
flood risks further limit the ability of many river based communities to escape poverty. 
1  Indonesia  experiences  two  main  types  of  flooding.  Long-lasting  river  floods,  which  are  often  influenced  by  tides, 
generally occur in large islands with large river basins that have steep slopes and long, flat, and low floodplains (e.g., 
Irian, Java, Kalimantan, or Sumatra). Flash floods typically inundate small islands in eastern Indonesia that have 
small and steep mountainous river basins.

study estimates that, at current trends, the urbanized area in Java will double within 30 years. 
7 Requirements to finance flood protection infrastructure for 2015–2019 are estimated at $74.6 million in the Cidanau–
Ciujung–Cidurian RBT and $102.7 million in the Ambon–Seram RBT. During 2010–2014, only 60% of the planned 
investment was realized. 
8  Climate  change  is  also  expected  to  produce  stronger  and  more  frequent  El  Niño  and  La  Niña  events  and  will 
exacerbate floods and droughts, thereby leading to increased food and water insecurity. 
2 
4. 
Water  security  is  a  central  pillar  of  the  RPJMN,  which  promotes  FRM  to  reduce  flood 
damage.9  Indonesia  adopted  the  integrated  water  resource  management  (IWRM)  approach, 
which is being promoted through (i) the establishment of river basin management organizations 
(RBOs),10 and (ii) the formulation of strategic basin plans as a prerequisite to basin development 
plans  (Rencanas).  The  Rencanas  form  the  basis  for  the  public  investment  in  water  resource 
management with a horizon of 20 years, including flood management. Implementation of IWRM 
and participatory river basin management is still hampered by inadequate planning, investment, 
capacity, and coordination. The RBTs targeted by the project are not an exception. There is a 
growing need to integrate structural and nonstructural measures to create a holistic response to 
the flood challenge. 
The  project  will  support  implementation  of  part  of  the  SPWR  calling  for  a  $3.06  billion 
5. 
investment in flood management.11 The Cidanau-Ciujung-Cidurian RBT (which is affected by river 
floods) and the Ambon-Seram RBT (which experiences flash floods)12 have been initially selected 
to  demonstrate  FRM  in  implementing  the  RPJMN.  The  investment  will  help  the  government 
accelerate  implementation  of  Rencanas  in  selected  RBTs,  and  provides  (i)  a  long-term 
partnership between the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the government for policy dialogue 
and capacity development, and (ii) the potential to  investment in other priority areas to  ensure 
continuity in combining infrastructure with nonstructural components. The project’s outputs and 
sector targets are clearly linked, and the criteria for the sector modality are met.13 
6. 
The  project  builds  on  lessons  from  flood  management  assistance  by  ADB  and 
development  partners.  The  project  design  incorporates  key  recommendations  based  on  such 
lessons, including: (i) intensive consultations need to be conducted with local stakeholders during 
project preparation to address all problems and issues, (ii) the government should routinely collect 
and analyze flood-damage data, (iii) support is needed to design and develop sustainable long-
term  flood  management  concepts,  and  (iv)  watershed  management  programs  should  be 
implemented to enhance the impact and sustainability of flood control works.14 
7. 
The project is consistent with (i) the strategic priorities for the Midterm Review of Strategy 
2020;15  and (ii)  ADB’s  interim  country  partnership  strategy,  2015 for Indonesia,  which has  two 
9   FRM embraces a range of measures that address three key components: (i) managing flood hazard, (ii) minimizing 
exposure to flood hazard, and (iii) reducing the vulnerability of people and property exposed. Managing flood hazard 
involves  physical  modifications  to  water  flow,  such  as  river  infrastructure  works,  and  catchment  management 
measures such as controls over forestry and agricultural practices. Managing exposure to floods involves property 
acquisition, land use zoning, building codes, planning development controls, and elevated building. Managing flood 
vulnerability  involves  nonstructural  measures  such  as  community  awareness,  flood  forecasting  and  warning, 
preparedness,  emergency  response,  and  post-flood  early  recovery  strategies.  The  FRM  process  allows  these 
measures  to  be  weighed  against  physical,  social,  and  economic  conditions;  and  addresses  specific  issues  that 
characterize each RBT. 
10 The central government is responsible for 63 RBTs, provincial agencies for 53, and district agencies for 15. 
11 The SPWR calls for an overall investment of $24.68 billion nationwide for water resources management. 
12 The  Cidanau–Ciujung–Cidurian  RBT  covers  an  area  of  4,125  square  kilometers  and  lies  mainly  within  Banten 
province, the westernmost province of Java. The Ambon–Seram RBT is located on the islands of Ambon and Seram 
in eastern Indonesia’s Maluku province, and has an area of 18,625 square kilometers. 
13 The required preconditions for the use of the sector lending modality—sector development plan, institutional capacity, 
and appropriate policy to implement the sector development plan—are all in place. The MPWH, as the executing 
agency, has the capacity to implement the sector development plan in terms of identification, selection, design, and 
implementation of subprojects. The sector development plan identified sector indicators that can be monitored and 
verified, including targets for cross-cutting and safeguard concerns.

strategic pillars: inclusive growth and environmental sustainability with climate change adaptation 
and mitigation.16 Agriculture and natural resources (including flood management) is a sector focus 
of  the  partnership  strategy.  The  project  is  aligned  with  the  ADB  water  operational  plan,  which 
identifies  flood  mitigation  (as  part  of  disaster  risk  management)  as  one  of  the  two  urgent 
challenges to be addressed in the IWRM approach.17 The project is also aligned with the ADB 
plan  for  integrated  disaster  risk  management  as  it  will  support  the  government  and  local 
communities to identify and better manage risks from natural hazards.18 
B. 
Impact and Outcome 
8. 
The impact will be economic and social losses from flood events in selected river basins 
reduced. The outcome will be flood risks in selected river basins, including those in the Cidanau–
Ciujung–Cidurian and Ambon–Seram RBTs, reduced through FRM. 
C. 
9. 
Outputs 
To achieve its expected outcome, the project will have the following outputs: 
(i) 
(ii) 
Planning  for  flood  risk  management  enhanced.  The  project  will  support  the 
RBOs  to  (a)  improve  hydrometeorological  data  management;  (b)  develop  flood 
models as the basis for the preparation of flood risk management plans (FRMPs); 
(c)  develop  flood  forecasting,  early  warning  system  and  mapping  of  hazards, 
exposure,  vulnerability,  risk,  and  emergency  response;  and  (d)  establish 
communication  procedures.  This  will  be  complemented  by 
institutional 
strengthening, planning, and coordination in those provinces and districts that will 
use FRMPs in updating provincial, district and/or city government spatial, midterm, 
and annual plans.19 
Land management improved and flood infrastructure upgraded. The project 
will  support  RBOs  to  prepare  detailed  engineering  designs  (DEDs);  meet 
environmental and social safeguards; conduct tendering and O&M planning; and 
implement infrastructure subprojects that are technically, socially, environmentally, 
and  economically  justified.  The  infrastructure  subprojects  comprise  the  (a) 
rehabilitation  and  upgrading  of  existing  flood  control  structures;  and  (b) 
construction  of  new  structures such  as  river  dikes,  spillways, coastal  protection, 
retention  basins,  and  check  dams.  Through  the  project,  communities  in  middle 
catchments will improve selected degraded land areas by implementing soil and 
water  conservation  measures  to  reduce  soil  erosion.20  The  project  will  also  (a) 
empower  farmers  groups  in  the  Cidanau–Ciujung–Cidurian  RBT  to  adopt 
sustainable agriculture practices, including terracing and development of retention 
ponds; and (b) implement measures to stop landslides and thus reduce sediment 
yields in both RBTs.

19 The  FRMPs  will  be  periodically  revised 
take 
into  account  asset  and  economic  growth,  updated 
hydrometeorological data, and changes in land use and policy. The FRMPs will also be used as a basis to update 
spatial, midterm, and annual plans by the local government; and issue related regulations (addressing land use, river 
corridors, solid waste management, spatial planning, and building).

20 The  project  will  empower  farmers  groups  in  the  Cidanau–Ciujung–Cidurian  RBT  to  adopt  sustainable  agriculture 
practices,  including  terracing  and  development  of  retention  ponds.  The  project  will  also  implement  measures  to 
mitigate landslides and associated reductions in the sediment yields in both RBTs. 
4 
(iii)  Capacity  for  community-based  flood  risk  management  enhanced.  To 
complement structural measures and improve flood resilience, community-based 
flood risk management (CBFRM) groups in the flood plains that benefit from the 
early  warning  system  will  be  established,  strengthened,  and  engaged  in  (a) 
identifying flood risks at the local level; (b) prioritizing community-based measures 
to reduce flood risk; (c) implementing priority measures to reduce flood risks, such 
as  solid  waste  management  and  construction  and  repair  of  small  water 
infrastructure;  and  (d) 
improving  disaster  preparedness  by  preparing  an 
emergency  response  plan  and  developing  corresponding  standard  operating 
procedures. 
Policy,  coordination,  and  capacity  at  national  level  improved.  To  ensure 
effective  policy  and  planning  coordination,  the  project  will  support  independent 
monitoring,  evaluation,  and  strategic  coordination  under  the  National  Steering 
Committee for Water Resources. A national strategy and a set of guidelines will be 
prepared  to  institutionalize  the  FRM  approach.  The  project  will  support  the 
executing  and  implementing  agencies  to  undertake  project  supervision  and 
strengthen  the  planning,  implementation,  and  management  capacities  of  the 
implementing agencies. 
(iv)

Implementation Procedures 
1. 
Subproject Selection, Preparation and Approval 
The executing agency (DGWR, MPWH), through the CPIU established in DRC, with the 
13. 
support  of  the  project  management  consultants  (PMC)  and  the  project  implementation  units 
(PIUs)—established in both the BBWS 3 Cis and BWSM—will have the main responsibility for 
preparing and appraising subprojects. 
14. 
Subproject Selection and appraisal process. Infrastructure investments are packaged 
as “subprojects”. In the context of this Project, a subproject is defined as an integrated package 
of  investments  and  activities  in  a  given  river  basin  territory.  A  tentative  list  of  candidate  sub-
projects both the 3 Cis and Ambon-Seram RBTs is provided in Appendix 4. This list of candidate 
subproject is based on the official river basin planning documents, Pola and Rencana for both 
RBT,22  consultation  with  BBWS  3  Cis  and  BWSM  and  basin  stakeholders,  past  studies,  and 
analysis  conducted  during  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (PPTA).23  During  the 
Project implementation, subprojects will  further be identified, prioritized, formulated, appraised, 
approved in accordance with technical, financial, economic, social and environmental appraisal 
criteria, mutually agreed between ADB and the Government as described below. ADB will review 
the subprojects on a selective basis with reference to the agreed criteria. The subproject scope 
should comply with the overall impact, outcome and management effectiveness outputs of the 
Project and contribute to the sector/sub-sector target of the Government, and geographic scope 
of the Project. DGWR will submit to ADB the environmental, social safeguard assessment reports 
and environment management plan (EMP), and resettlement plan for each subproject as required. 
Works  contracts  can  be  awarded  however  contract  implementation  is  subject  to  approval  of 
resettlement plan, if required. 
•  Step  1:  Screen  and select candidate  subprojects  from the  sector  development  plan 
(RBT  plans  -  Pola  and  Rencana),  consultation  with  the  Basin  Coordination  Forum 
(TKPSDAs) and submit the selection to ADB for approval.  
•  Step 2: Prepare the subproject appraisal report covering technical, economic,24 social, 
environment and financial aspects; hold required consultations; revise and submit to 
the CPMU for appraisal and approval as per template presented in Appendix 5. 
•  Step 3: Submit the subproject appraisal report to ADB for review and approval. 
•  Step 4: Prepare the detailed engineering design (DED) and social and environmental 
safeguards documents considering climate change aspects. 
•  Step 5: Submit the social and environmental safeguards documents for ADB approval. 
•  Step  6:  Implement  activities  including  tendering,  land  acquisition  and  resettlement 
(LAR), and other activities. 
15. 
Selection  criteria.  To  be  eligible  for  financing  through  the  project,  each  subproject 
feasibility study report will include a flood-risk and situation assessment, technical analysis and 
description,  subproject  rationale,  scope  and  components,  cost  estimates  and  financing  plan, 
implementation  arrangements,  financial  and  economic  analysis,  and  environmental,  social  and 
22 POLA for 3 Cis RBT was endorsed by Ministry of Public Works and Housing on 14 February 2012 and for Ambon 
Seram RBT on 28 November 2012. 
23  PPTA 7364 INO Phase 2 Final Report, Volume 1 Main Report. 
24 The  ecomomic  analysis  has  to  be  prepared  according  to  ADB’s  Guidelines  on  the  Economic  Analysis  of 
Projects. 
27 
poverty  impact  assessment  (see  Appendix  5  for  the  Subproject  Summary  Report  Template). 
Based on the feasibility study, subprojects must be selected according to the following criteria:  
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
(v) 
(vi) 
(vii) 
The subproject is in line with the sector development plan and the RBT plans – 
(Pola and Rencana).  
The  subproject  flood-risk  analysis  is  based  on  technical  requirements  for 
hydrological and hydraulic survey data for estimating flood flow and impact, and 
structural designs meet national technical requirements. 
The subproject is designed to maximize the benefit to cost ratio with a combination 
of structural and nonstructural measures for optimal flood management.  
The  subproject's  social  and  poverty  impact  assessment  assesses  that  the 
proposed  flood  protection  measures  will  have  a  net  positive  impact,  will  reduce 
poverty, and can be monitored. 
The  subproject  is  designed  to  minimize  social  impacts  and  ensure  that  people 
adversely affected by civil works under the project are compensated in compliance 
with the principles set in the resettlement framework. 
The subproject initial environmental examination assesses that the environmental 
impact  during  construction  can  be  minimized,  in  line  with  principles  set  in  the 
environmental  assessment  review  framework  (EARF);  and  the  subproject  is 
designed to minimize detrimental environmental impact. 
The subproject's implementation timeframe is reasonable, and surveys and design 
can  be  prepared, reviewed,  and  safeguard  processes  and  procedures followed, 
and implemented within the project period. 
(ix) 
(viii)  The local government provides commitment to the investment to facilitate the LAR 
process  (as  required),  including  implementation  of  the  social  action  plan  in 
accordance with the principles set out in the resettlement framework. 
The subproject has no negative and/or positive impacts to indigenous people, and 
screening  process  of  each  future  sub-projects  will  be  done  to  ensure  that 
indigenous people safeguards are not triggered (only category C). 
Local communities and beneficiaries demonstrate commitment to the investment 
through willingness to contribute, in cash or in kind, to the cost of development as 
appropriate.  
Subproject economic internal rate of return exceeds 9%. 
(xi) 
(x) 
16. 
These  civil  works  are  complemented  by  the  following  activities:  (i)  improvement  of 
hydrological  information  systems  and  preparation  of  FRMPs,  (ii)  institutional  strengthening  for 
implementation  of  FRMPs,  (iii)  rehabilitation  and  management  of  watershed,  (iv)  governance 
(building  code,  local  regulations,  land  use  zoning,  etc.),  (v)  detailed  engineering  design  and 
construction  supervision  for  flood  control  infrastructure,  and  (vi)  community-based  flood  risk 
management.25  
17. 
Participatory  planning  approach  and  stakeholder  involvement.  Subproject  design 
and  development  will  follow  a  participatory  planning  and  demand-driven  approach  in  the  
identification of a package of investments and activities. The basin coordinating committee will be 
consulted for the preparation of the sub projects in conjunction with the FRM planning. 
25 Based on above criteria, one core subproject was identified and appraised during project preparation in the Ciujung 
river basin consisting of the construction of new dikes (11 km), spillways and retention basin along the Ciujung main 
stream. 
28 
2. 
Technical Considerations for Structural Activities 
After  the  feasibility  study  and  project  selection  as  described  above,  the  structural 
18. 
subproject implementation will include the following steps:  
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
(v) 
Preparation  of  DED  that  will  take  into  account  climate  change,  future  land  use 
changes and eco-hydrology dimensions; 
Preparation of O&M plan; 
Review/approval of DED; 
Tendering for civil works; 
Complete  implementation  of  resettlement  plans  and  provision  of  required 
compensation to project affected people before issuing instruction to proceed to 
contractors; 
Construction, including technical and safeguard supervision and monitoring; 
(vi) 
(vii)  Commissioning, training and handover; and 
(viii)  Operation, maintenance and monitoring. 
19. 
The CPMU will recruit safeguards consultants as part of the PMC team. The consultants 
shall support the BBWS 3 Cis and BWSM to prepare the resettlement plans in consultation with 
provincial and district land agencies, and project affected people. This will ensure that appropriate 
measures are taken to mitigate any negative social impacts including special measures for land 
acquisition,  compensation,  and  to  ensure  full  implementation  to  improve  the  participation  of 
women and other disadvantaged groups as beneficiaries as set in the resettlement framework. 
The consultants will also prepare the  indigenous people screening. The safeguards specialists 
and the CPMU will work closely with gender specialist to ensure the gender action plan is fully 
implemented  and  gender  consideration  for  resettlement  plan  is  addressed.  The  guidelines  for 
community contracting under the MOA and MOHA components are presented in Appendix 6.

IV. 
COSTS AND FINANCING 
20. 
The  government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $108.7  million  from  ADB’s  ordinary  capital 
resources to help finance the Project. The loan will have an 17-year term, including a grace period 
of  8  years,  straight  line,  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  London 
interbank  offered rate (LIBOR)-based  lending facility,  a  commitment charge  of  0.15%  per  year 
(the interest and other charges during construction to be paid by the government, not capitalized 
in the loan), and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement.26 Based 
on this, the average loan maturity is 12.75 years and there is no maturity premium payable to 
ADB.  The  project  total  cost  is  $161.57 million  of  which  $141.68 million  constitutes  base  costs, 
$16.83  million  for  contingencies  and  $3.06  million  financial  charges  during  implementation 
(including  interest  rate  and  commitment  charges).  The  loan  proceeds  will  be  utilized  for  the 
construction of selected civil works, community driven activities, vehicles, equipment, consulting 
services, workshops, and training socialization.

On-Granting Fund Flow Mechanisms - Budget Document Preparation. On-granting 
fund flow mechanism is used for the DGRD and DGAIF components and include the following 
steps27: (i) following loan agreement signing, DGWR will request the Directorate General of Fiscal 
Balance  (DGFB),  MOF  to  issue  a  decree  by  the  Minister  of  Finance  on  loan  allocation  to  be 
transferred to local governments based on evaluation, (ii) after issuance of the decree, DGFB will 
prepare 
the  provincial/district 
governments, which settles the budget allocation to be transferred every year during the project 
period; (iii) relevant provincial/district agencies will assign their Satuan Kerja Perangkat Daerah 
formal  on-granting  agreements  between  MOF  and

(SKPDs, Provincial/District Working Unit) to prepare annual plans based on the annual work plan 
(AWP) endorsed by NSCWR and ADB; (iv) DGFB, in close coordination with CPMU and DGRD 
will prepare the work and budget plan of on-granting (RKA-HPD) which then will be submitted to 
Directorate  General  of  Treasury  (DGT),  MOF  to  produce  a  DIPA-HPD;  and  (v)  in  parallel  the 
provincial/district governments will issue their own DPA-SKPD.

FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT 
A. 
Financial Management Assessment 
27. 
The  Financial  Management  Assessment  (FMA)  has  been  prepared  in  accordance  with 
ADB’s Guidelines for the Financial Management and Analysis of Projects29 (the Guidelines) and 
the  Financial  Due  Diligence:  A  Methodology  Note.30  This  FMA  incorporates  the  Financial 
Management Internal Control and Risk Management Assessment required by the Guidelines. The 
RRP supplementary document 16 presents the FMA report including the consolidated results of 
the completed FMA questionnaires from the executing- and implementing agencies. This report 
was  prepared  by  reviewing  documents,  interviewing  the  staff  of  the  government  agencies, 
consultants,  targeted  project  beneficiaries  and  other  stakeholders.  Mitigating  actions  were 
identified together with the stakeholders.  
28. 
The  purpose  of  this  assessment  was  to  determine  the  robustness  of  the  accounting, 
financial  controls  and  internal  audit  arrangements,  and  the  capability  of  the  executing  and 
implementing  agencies  to  meet  all  the  fiduciary  requirements  which  are  set  out  in  the  loan 
agreement, and other project documents. Within this context, the report presents results of a FMA 
of  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies’  including  agreed  project  financial  arrangements 
financial  responsibilities  of  each  of  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies,  and  associated 
entities and perceived financial risks and risk management. The assessment concludes that the 
overall project financial management risk is moderate. The key risks, activities to mitigate risks, 
responsibilities to address these risks and a timeline are summarized in the table below: 
Key Risks 
Complex implementation 
arrangements- 
Coordination between the 
EA and IAs of four 
different ministries and 
LGs in two provinces and 
several districts. 
Country level weaknesses 
identified by the repeat 
PEFA report PFM reform 
program such as the 
introduction of accrual-
based accounting may 
impact in the preparation 
of financial management 
report.  
Lack of experience, 
especially at the PIU levels 
including in ADB financial 
management procedures 
Mitigation Activities 
Establishment of the steering 
committee that includes EA and 
IAs will ensure regular 
coordination to address issues 
and resolve it within a short time 
and communicate it to the CPMU.  
Strengthening of the EA, IAs and 
CPMU capacity in preparing the 
financial management report will 
be provided through the project 
management consultant and ADB 
resident mission specialist.

Key Risks 
High pre-mitigation 
financial management 
(FM) related to weak 
internal controls, limited 
FM capacity of EA/IAs, 
weaknesses in internal 
audit capabilities and 
reconciliations. 
The lack of segregation of 
duties in  the critical area 
of bank reconciliations as 
highlighted in section 4.9 
of the FMAQ 
The lack of an accurate 
and timely flow of 
information between the 
different implementing 
agencies, as highlighted in 
section 4.40 of the FMAQ. 
The  reliance on excel 
spreadsheets (and the 
associate risks) for 
preparation of financial 
statements as reflected in 
section 7.9 of the FMAQ 
Mitigation Activities 
Coordinate with BPKP to improve 
internal control system and work 
closely with EA and IAs to 
improve the internal control 
system, specific for the project 
and recruit financial management 
consultants and provide guidance 
to improve project staff capacity. 
Establish clear organizational 
structure of the CPMU and PIUs. 
Prepare the TORs of individual 
consultants and firms that will 
assist the project. 
Close monitoring by the CPMU 
and recruit financial management 
specialist to help CPMU collect 
and consolidate reports from the 
PIUs. 
Develop accounting and financial 
management manuals to 
empower accounting system; 
strengthen the internal audit 
function; and put in place the 
system to ensure data reliability.

Conclusion.  The  assessments  indicate  that  on  the  whole,  the  prevailing  government 
financial, accounting, and auditing rules and systems meet the generally acceptable international 
accounting and auditing standards. The executing and implementing agencies have worked in 
the past with ADB and/or other development partners and are implementing ongoing ADB funded 
projects.  The  overall  performance  of  executing  and  implementing  agencies  in  implementing 
financial management of the ongoing project is acceptable. MPWH, appointed as the Project’s 
executing  agency,  and  MOA,  MOHA  and  BAPPENAS  as  the  implementing  agencies,  have 
substantial and highly relevant experience in implementing externally-financed projects including 
ADB loans. There are shortfalls such as the lack of experience with ADB project management for 
some implementing agencies. However, this will be addressed through training and support from 
the  project  management  consultant.  The  Project  will  strengthen  staff  capacities  in  the 
implementation  units,  particularly  in  financial  management  procedures,  to  allow  the  efficient 
operation and the reporting of financial performance to the government and ADB. 
B. 
Fund Flow/Disbursement Arrangements 
30. 
The  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  Loan  Disbursement 
Handbook  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time),31  and  detailed  arrangements  agreed  upon 
between the Government and ADB.  Online training for project staff on disbursement policies and 
procedures  is  available  at:    http://wpqr4.adb.org/disbursement_elearning.    Project  staff  are 
encouraged to avail of this training to help ensure efficient disbursement and fiduciary control. 
31. 
Imprest  Account.  After  ADB  loan  effectiveness,  the  government  will  open  an  Imprest 
Account in US dollars, in the name of MOF at Bank Indonesia (BI, the Indonesian central bank). 
31 Available at: http://www.adb.org/documents/loan-disbursement-handbook. 
43 
The imprest account will be administered by MOF. The government who established the imprest 
account  in  its  name  is  accountable and responsible  for proper  use  of  advances to  the  imprest 
account. 
At  central  level,  the  project  will  have  six  budget  users:  DGRW,  BBWS  3  Cis,  BWSM, 
32. 
DGAIF, DGRD, and DWRI. Each budget holder will establish a working unit for implementation, 
which  is  headed  by  a  commitment  officer  (PPK).32  The  PPK  is  responsible  for  monitoring 
procurement and managing the payments for procured works, goods or services. The payments 
are made by the state treasury office (KPPN - Kantor Pelayanan Perbendaharaan Negara) at the 
request  of  PPK  and  following  the  approval  by  the  budget  holders.  The  CPMU  will  submit 
liquidation and replenishment request to the MOF in the form of withdrawal applications (WAs) in 
accordance  with  ADB’s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). 
The imprest account will be replenished to ensure liquidity of funds. 
33. 
The  imprest  account  will  be  established,  managed,  replenished,  and  liquidated  in 
accordance  with  ADB’s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). 
The total outstanding advance to the imprest account should not exceed the estimate of ADB’s 
share of expenditures to be paid through the imprest account for the forthcoming 6 months. The 
government may request for initial and additional advances to the imprest account based on an 
Estimate of Expenditure Sheet33 setting out the estimated expenditures to be financed through 
the accounts for the forthcoming six (6) months. Supporting documents should be submitted to 
ADB or retained by the borrower in accordance with ADB’s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, 
as amended from time to time) when liquidating or replenishing the imprest account.  
34. 
Before the submission of the first withdrawal application, the borrower will submit to ADB 
sufficient evidence of the authority of the person(s) who will sign the withdrawal applications on 
behalf of the borrower, together with the authenticated specimen signatures of each authorized 
person.  The  minimum  value  per  withdrawal  application  is  US$100,000  equivalent.  Individual 
payments below this amount should be paid by the EA/IA and subsequently claimed from ADB (i) 
through reimbursement; or (ii) from the imprest account, unless otherwise accepted by ADB. 
The CPMU will be responsible for preparing the annual contract awards and disbursement 
35. 
projections;  requesting  budgetary  allocations  for  counterpart  funds,  preparing  of  withdrawal 
applications,  and  sending  the  withdrawal  applications  to  ADB.  CPMU  and  the  PIUs  are 
responsible in collecting supporting documents for the project expenditures they have incurred.  
36. 
Statement of Expenditures (SOE). The SOE procedure may be used for reimbursement 
of  eligible  expenditure  and  liquidation  and  replenishment  of  advances  to  the  imprest  account. 
SOE records should be maintained and made readily available for review by ADB’s disbursement 
and review mission or upon ADB’s request for submission of supporting documents on a sampling 
basis. 
Sample forms for withdrawal of loan proceeds, replenishment and liquidation of imprest

Accounting Policies and Procedures 
38. 
DGWR will maintain, or cause to be maintained, separate books and records by funding 
source  for  all  expenditures  incurred  on  the  Project.  DGWR  will  prepare  consolidated  project 
financial statements in accordance with the government's accounting laws and regulations which 
are consistent with international accounting principles and practices. 
D. 
Reporting, Auditing and Public Disclosure 
39. 
Auditing  Requirements.  DGWR  will  cause  the  detailed  consolidated  project  financial 
statements  to  be  audited  in  accordance  with  International  Standards  on  Auditing  and  with  the 
Government's  audit  regulations,  by  an  independent  auditor  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  audited 
project financial statements will be submitted in the English language to ADB within six months of 
the end of the fiscal year by DGWR.  
40. 
The executing agency will engage the Badan Pengawas Keuangan (BPK), the Indonesian 
Supreme Audit Institution (SAI), to audit the consolidated project financial statements annually. 
BPK will allocate adequate budget to properly audit the project. The draft terms of reference (TOR) 
of BPK was discussed between ADB and BPK, and has been approved by BPK, MOF, and ADB 
dated  18  July  2014.  The  Project  will  follow  the  approved  TOR  of  BPK,  which  is  given  in  the 
financial management assessment. 
As in the TOR, BPK will prepare the annual audit report for the project accounts, which 
41. 
will  include  an  audit management  letter  and  audit  opinions  which  cover  (i)  whether the  project 
financial statements present a true and fair view or are presented fairly, in all material respects, 
in accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework; (ii) whether loan  proceeds were 
used  only  for the  purposes  of  the  project  or  not; (iii)  the  level  of  compliance  for  each  financial 
covenant  contained  in  the  legal  agreements  for  the  project;  and  (iv)  use  of  the  imprest  fund 
procedure. 
Compliance with financial reporting and auditing requirements will be monitored by review 
42. 
missions and during normal program supervision, and followed up regularly with all concerned, 
including the external auditor.  
The government, DGWR and implementing agencies have been  made aware of ADB’s 
43. 
policy on delayed submission, and the requirements for satisfactory and acceptable quality of the 
audited project financial statements.35 ADB reserves the right to require a change in the auditor 
35 ADB Policy on delayed submission of audited project financial statements:  
•  When audited project financial statements are not received by the due date, ADB will write to the 
executing agency advising that (i) the audit documents are overdue; and (ii) if they are not received 
within  the  next  six  months,  requests  for  new  contract  awards  and  disbursement  such  as  new 
replenishment  of  imprest  accounts,  processing  of  new  reimbursement,  and  issuance  of  new 
commitment letters will not be processed. 
•  When audited project financial statements have not been received within 6 months after the due 
date, ADB will withhold processing of requests for new contract awards and disbursement such as 
45 
(in  a  manner  consistent  with  the  constitution  of  the  borrower),  or  for  additional  support  to  be 
provided to the auditor, if the audits required are not conducted in a manner satisfactory to ADB, 
or if the audits are substantially delayed. ADB reserves the right to verify the project's financial 
accounts to confirm that the share of ADB’s financing is used in accordance with ADB’s policies 
and procedures.  
44. 
Public  disclosure  of  the  project  financial  statements,  including  the  audit  report  on  the 
project financial statements, will be guided by ADB’s Public Communications Policy (2011).36 After 
review, ADB will disclose the project financial statements for the project and the opinion of the 
auditors on the financial statements within 30 days of the date of their receipt by posting them on 
ADB’s website. The Audit Management Letter will not be disclosed.

commitment letters. ADB will (i) inform the executing agency of ADB’s actions; and (ii) advise that 
the loan may be suspended if the audit documents are not received within the next six months. 
•  When audited project financial statements have not been received within 12 months after the due 
date, ADB may suspend the loan.

VI. 
PROCUREMENT AND CONSULTING SERVICES 
A. 
Advance Procurement 
All  advance  contracting  will  be  undertaken  in  conformity  with  ADB’s  Procurement 
45. 
Guidelines  (April  2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)37  and  ADB’s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of 
Consultants  (March  2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).38  The  issuance  of  invitations  to  bid 
under advance contracting will be subject to ADB approval. The borrower and DGWR, BBWS 3 
Cis, BWSM, DGAIF, DGRD, and DWRI have been advised that approval of advance contracting 
does  not  commit  ADB  to  finance  the  Project.  ADB  financing  is  subject  to  the  government’s 
compliance  of  the  relevant  provisions  of  the  loan  agreement  and  ADB  guidelines.  The 
Government was also advised that ADB will not finance expenditures incurred by the government 
prior to loan effectiveness, even if advance contracting is approved by ADB.  
46. 
The following steps for the recruitment of consultants can be concluded in advance: (i) 
submission  to  ADB  for  review  and  approval  of  the  term  of  reference,  cost  estimates  and 
shortlisting evaluation criteria, (ii) advertisement, (iii) shortlisting of consulting firms, (iv) issuance 
of the request for proposals, (v) evaluation of technical proposals, and (vi) evaluation of financial 
proposals  and  final  ranking.  DGWR,  DGAIF,  DGRD,  and  DWRI  will  advertise  all  consulting 
opportunities in Consulting Services Recruitment Notice (CSRN) at www.adb.org. 
47. 
The following steps for the procurement of vehicles and office equipment, and civil works 
can be undertaken in advance: (i) submission to ADB for review and approval of the draft bidding 
document, (ii) advertisement, (iii) issuance of bid documents, (iv) bid opening, and (v) evaluation 
of bids. 
48. 
To facilitate rapid start-up, the government and ADB agreed that advance action could be 
undertaken for the (i) engagement of consultants under DGWR, BAPPENAS, DGAIF and DGRD, 
and (ii) urgent civil works packages under the BBWS 3 Cis core subproject. This is necessary to 
ensure (i) consultants are available to support the early stages of project implementation, and (ii) 
urgent civil works can start at early stage of the project.  
B. 
Procurement of Goods, Works and Consulting Services 
49. 
All  procurement  of  goods  and  works  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB’s 
Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time). Under the project, civil works will 
be procured through national competitive bidding (NCB) method  for packages up to or equal to 
$25,000,000 equivalent. Goods will be procured through NCB procedures for packages up to or 
equal to $3,000,000 equivalent. For packages of $100,000 equivalent or less, shopping method 
may be used. Small-scale works and good contracts with average value of $30,000 equivalent 
may  be  awarded  to  community  groups  following  procurement  procedures  for  community 
participation in procurement as contained in ADB's Procurement Guidelines. For procurement of 
works  and  goods  with  NCB  method,  the  application  of  post  qualification  is  suggested.  ADB 
Standard  Bidding  Document  (SBD)  will  be  used  for  NCB  works  and  good  packages.    The 
harmonized bidding document if available may be used.  The use of the e-procurement system 
(SPSE) is allowed for National Competitive Bidding (NCB) packages provided the system could 
facilitate regulation of the ADB’s Procurement Guidelines.. The SPSE has been upgraded from 
time to time, and recently the latest version of SPSE 4.3 is replacing the SPSE 3.6 platform.   The 
37 Available at: http://www.adb.org/Documents/Guidelines/Procurement/Guidelines-Procurement.pdf 
38 Available at: http://www.adb.org/Documents/Guidelines/Consulting/Guidelines-Consultants.pdf 
47 
new  SPSE  4.3  is  being  assessed  and  the  ADB  will  advise  the  Executing  Agency  on  the 
acceptability of the e-procurement system. If the use of e-procurement is accepted, for contracts 
estimated more than $10 million, the Invitation for Bid (IFB) will  be posted in the ADB website.  
For Quality- and Cost-Based Selection (QCBS) all consulting services recruitment notice (CSRN) 
must be posted in the ADB consultant management system (CMS).  The remaining steps will be 
carried  out  offline  for  recruitment  of  consultants  under  BAPPENAS,  DGAIF  and  DGRD.  The 
ADB’s Request for Proposal (RFP) will be used.   
50.  For consultant selection within MPWH, the use of  MPWH’ e- procurement system (SPSE 
ICB) is agreed. All consultants have to apply both in ADB CSRN and MPWH SPSE ICB systems, 
otherwise  will  not  be  processed.    If  there  is  any  discrepancy/difference  in  data  or  information 
submitted between the systems, only the data or information in SPSE system will be considered 
valid.The  executing  and  implementing  agencies  will  provide  assurance  that  the  use  of  MPWH 
electronic procurement system to engage the consulting firms will not hamper the advertisement 
of  the  CSRN  in  CMS  nor  the  receipt  of  all  Expression  of  Interest  (EOI)  and  corresponding 
evaluation of EOI.  The executing and implementing agencies will ensure that the e-procurement 
system and the provisions in the Request for EOI’s, RFPs and bidding documents of procurement 
of  works  and  goods  will  have  no restrictions  on registration  and  submission  of  bids,  EOIs  and 
proposals  by  the  prospective  bidders.    This  is  necessary  to  promote  open  competition  and 
discrimination.  The restrictions for foreign firms pertain, but are not limited to, to the requirement 
to  (i)  form  mandatory  joint  venture  or  other  forms  of  mandatory  partnership  between  firms,  (ii) 
have a representative office in Indonesia, and (iii) be physically present at the government agency 
to obtain the relevant identification and registration numbers necessary in order to participate in 
the  bidding.    For  procurement  of  goods,  references  to  brand  names/catalog  numbers  are  not 
permitted.   If  necessary,  the  words  “or  equivalent”  need to  be  added  after  such reference.Any 
procedure  under  which  bids  above  or  below  a  predetermined  assessment  of  bid  values  are 
automatically disqualified is not acceptable.  Rejection of all bids is justified when bid prices are 
substantially higher tthan the existing budget.  Where all bid prices substantially exceed the cost 
estimates,  the  executing  or  implementing  agencies  may  after  reviewing  the  budget  sufficiency 
and after consultation with ADB, negotiate with the lowest evaluated bidder for a reduction of the 
bid price, instead of calling new bids. 
A Procurement Sector Risk Assessment for the water sector, has been completed by ADB. 
50. 
The assessment suggested that the overall procurement risk in the sector is Medium with notes 
to give attention to (i) the sufficiency of the number of procurement committee members and (ii) 
the current procurement performance in the sector which resulted in limited number of qualified 
bidders despite significant larger number of firms which bidded.  
51. 
A Project Procurement Risk Assessment was prepared in accordance with ADB’s “Guide 
on  Assessing  Procurement  Risks  and  Determining  Project  Procurement  Classification.”39  The 
overall procurement classification for the Project is assessed as Medium Risk (Category Medium) 
and recommended the following to improve procurement capacity:

-  Complaint handling mechanism system exists but 
sanction system needs improvement. 
-  Standard Bidding Documents are used, however, the 
one for large contracts requiring international 
competition may need further improvements to attract 
more bidders 
-  Advance procurement is practiced in the end of each 
year to anticipate the new fiscal year, with strict 
stipulation that bid winner will be determined when the 
budget document (DIPA) is effective. 
-  Procurement planning may require further 
enhancement to anticipate widespread scattered 
contracts based on the current extensive demands for 
water resources management sector development. 
-  Procurement Service Unit is a permanent function unit. 
-  Each procurement working group members is 
procurement certified. 
-  For large contract procurement, the number of 
competitive private sector is rather limited.  
-  Advertisement of a procurement opportunity is 
adequately made in transparent manner. However, 
there may be an inadequate comprehensive public 
awareness program to show the general advantages 
for the private sector in participating in large value 
government contracts.  
-  The sector has a long experience in procuring large 
water resources development projects financed by 
various loans. 
-  Under the current regulations the cost estimate is 
based on market assessment. However, no further 
guidance/manual is provided on how to conduct such 
market assessment, and there is no proper 
supervision either on the application of the market 
survey.  
Implementing unit is used to refer to unit price list 
endorsed by each local government 
- 
-  e-catalogue for some items of goods is available 
-  Procedures and requirements on conducting 
procurement audit is still missing, so far which has 
been implemented nationally is financial audit which 
includes the review of the application of procurement 
procedures. 
-  Many improvements made in fighting against 
corruption and collusion however it needs to be 
addressed in a more institutional and sustainable way.

Environmental Safeguards 
VII. 
SAFEGUARDS 
The  Project  is  categorized  as  environment  category  B  in  accordance  with  ADB‘s  SPS 
54. 
2009. Details about the procedures to ensure that potential environmental impacts are avoided, 
reduced and mitigated in accordance with ADB SPS 2009 and regulations from the Government 
of  Indonesia  can  be  found  in  the  Environmental  Assessment  and  Review  Framework  (EARF) 
(RRP  Linked  document  11).  An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  report  including  an 
Environmental  Management  and  Environmental  Monitoring  Plan  (EMP)  was  prepared  for  the 
Ciujung core subproject. The EMP outlines the anticipated environmental adverse impacts of the 
subproject, proposed mitigation and monitoring measures, and roles and responsibilities of the 
executing and implementing agencies, consultants, and contractors for each measure. Based on 
the screening for potential environmental impacts and risks, the IEE concluded that the proposed 
core  subproject  can  be  implemented  in  an  environmentally  acceptable  manner  with  the 
corresponding  EMP.  In  addition,  an  Environmental  Impact  Assessment  (Analisa  Mengenai 
Dampak Lingkungan or AMDAL in Bahasa Indonesia) for the Ciujung core subproject has been 
approved in accordance with government regulations to supplement the IEE. The environmental 
management and monitoring plan of the approved AMDAL is presented in the IEE. 
For future subprojects, the AMDAL will be accepted by ADB as an IEE or Environmental 
55. 
Impact Assessment (EIA)41 and the UKL/UPL (environmental management/monitoring measures) 
reports will be accepted by ADB as an IEE on the condition that the English version of the full 
AMDAL  and/or  UKL/UPL  is  reviewed  and  considered  to  be  consistent  with  SPS  2009 
requirements.  The  full  AMDAL  or  UKL/UPL  reports—depending  on  categorization—will  be 
prepared and finalized in consultation with ADB before government approval. Upon incorporation 
of ADB’s comments to ensure that the AMDAL or UKL/UPL meet SPS 2009 requirements, the 
English  version  of  government  approved  AMDAL  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  for  disclosure. 
Disbursements  for  the  subproject  investment  can  only  proceed  upon  ADB  and  government 
approval of the relevant AMDAL studies and/or UKL/UPL. The operational steps for environmental 
mitigation measures for major activities are included in the standard operating procedures (SOP) 
for environmental safeguard presented in Appendix 8. 
56. 
During  implementation,  the  CPMU,  with  assistance  from  the  national  environmental 
safeguard specialist of the consultant team, shall be responsible for the following activities related 
to environmental safeguards: (i) screen all subprojects for categorization in accordance with ADB 
SPS  2009  and  Government  of  Indonesia  and  submit  to  ADB  for  approval;  (ii)  contract  an 
accredited agency to prepare UKL/UPL or AMDAL study (in Bahasa Indonesia and English) as 
required based on the categorization; (iii) ensure the UKL/UPL or AMDAL meet ADB SPS 2009 
requirements  as  described  in  the  EARF;  (iv)  ensure  that  the  UKL/UPL  or  AMDAL  has  been 
approved  by  the  respective  environment  agency;  (v)  consolidate  semi-annual  environmental 
monitoring reports; (vi) ensure timely disclosure of final AMDAL and updated EMP in locations 
and form accessible to the public; and (vii) address, record, and report on any grievances brought 
about through the Grievance Redress Mechanism in a timely manner. 
57. 
The  PIUs,  with  assistance  from the  environmental  officers  will:  (i)  confirm  that    EMP  is 
included in the bidding documents and civil works contracts;  (ii) ensure contractor’s EMPs are 
41  If  a  category  A  subproject  be  identified,  an  EIA  will  be  required.  If  a  subproject  is  identified  as  category  A  for 
environment, the categorization of the overall Project will be changed to category A as well, subject to approval by 
the Government and ADB.   
65 
prepared  by  contractors  prior  to  actual  construction;  (iii)  supervise  the  implementation  of 
environmental  mitigating  measures  required  for  the  construction  activities;  (iv)  review,  monitor 
and evaluate the effectiveness of the implemented contractor’s EMPs, and recommend necessary 
corrective actions; (v) prepare monthly and quarterly environmental monitoring reports and submit 
quarterly environmental monitoring report to the CPMU during construction phase; (vi) prepare 
and  submit  semi-annual  environmental  monitoring  report  to  the  CPMU  during  the  operational 
phase  of  the  subproject;  (vii)  contract  an  independent  safeguard  monitoring  entity  to  conduct 
water  quality  monitoring as  specified  in the IEEs  and  AMDAL environmental  monitoring  plans; 
and  (viii)  address,  record,  and  report  on  any  grievances  brought  about  through  the  Grievance 
Redress Mechanism in a timely manner.  
58. 
The BBWS 3 Cis and BWSM PIUs will each assign an environment officer to ensure EMP 
implementation. The TOR of the PIU environment officer can be found in Appendix 7 of the EARF.  
59. 
An independent safeguard monitoring entity will be engaged by each PIU to conduct water 
quality monitoring for the subprojects as specified in the environmental monitoring plan under the 
IEEs and the AMDAL. They will provide quarterly environmental safeguard monitoring reports to 
the PIU. A draft TOR of the safeguard monitoring entity is provided in Appendix 7 to the EARF. 
B. 
Social Safeguards 
60. 
In accordance with ADB’s SPS 2009, the project is classified as Category A for Involuntary 
Resettlement as 200 or more persons experience major impacts, which are defined as (i) being 
physically  displaced  from  housing,  and/or  (ii)  losing  10%  or  more  of  their  productive  (income 
generating) assets. The resettlement framework prepared for the Project is in line with the Land 
Acquisition Law No. 2/2012 and its related regulations, and with ADB SPS 2009.  The resettlement 
framework  will  guide  the  preparation  and  implementation  of  resettlement  plans  for  candidate 
structural  subprojects.  The  resettlement  framework  also  includes  provisions  on  voluntary  land 
donation/contribution  and  negotiated  land  principles.  When  negotiated  settlement  is  used  to 
acquire land, there will be an agreement with ADB on the consultation process, and principle of 
negotiated land acquisition (willing buyer – willing seller approach with market price), third-party 
validation,  and  record  requirements.  The  resettlement  framework  has  been  concurred  by  the 
government and approved by ADB. The resettlement plan for the Ciujung core subproject has 
been  prepared,  concurred  by  the  government  and  approved  by  ADB.  The  resettlement  plan 
summary  for  the  core  subproject  has  been  disclosed  to  the  affected  persons  and  other 
stakeholders and uploaded on ADB’s website. For future subprojects, resettlement plans will be 
prepared  and/or  updated  following  completion  of  DED  and  Detailed  Measuring  Survey (DMS). 
resettlement  plans  wil  then  be  concurred  by  the  Government  and  approved  by  ADB  prior  to 
implementation as per principles set in the resettlement framework. 
For subprojects for which land acquisition and resettlement (LAR) has been undertaken 
61. 
or is being undertaken prior to loan effectiveness, a due diligence or a social  compliance audit 
need  to  be  carried  out  (i)  to  identify  past  or  present  concerns  related  to  impacts  on  social 
safeguards and (ii) to ensure that land acquisition actions were carried out in accordance with the 
approved resettlement framework. If any outstanding compliance issue is identified, a corrective 
action plan (CAP) mutually agreed between ADB and the Executing Agency and/or Implementing 
Agency will be prepared. The plan will define necessary remedial actions, the budget for such 
actions, and the time frame for resolution of noncompliance. The due diligence report (including 
CAP, if any) will be made available to the public in accordance with the information disclosure 
requirements  set  in  the  resettlement  framework.  To  minimize  the  corrective  actions,  the 
66 
Executing/Implementing Agency will ensure that LAR for potential sub projects is undertaken in 
accordance with the agreed resettlement framework. 
62. 
The government enhanced its country system in order to address land acquisition issues 
for public interest development project purposes. The Land Acquisition Law No. 2/2012 places 
people at the center of development. Affected people rights for their land and property are fully 
respected  when  their  land  is  needed  to  build  infrastructure  for  public  interest.  ADB  SPS  2009 
looks at projects assisted by ADB as development opportunities for affected persons to improve 
their  living  standards.  The  Land  Acquisition  Law  and  its  implementing  rules  and  regulations 
approximate harmonization with SPS 2009. The law grants that affected person with no legal title 
over the land they occupy are entitled only to compensation for improvements of business losses, 
moving  cost,  etc.  but  not  for  the  land  itself.  The  executing  agency  is  required  to  prepare  a 
comprehensive  land  acquisition  planning  document  and  project  plan.  Its  location  should  be 
consulted with and agreed by eligible party and stakeholders prior to government issuance of a 
project  location  determination.  People  affected  by  land  acquisition,  are meaningfully  consulted 
and  grievance  mechanisms  are  in  place  during  the  planning  and  implementation  of  land 
acquisition. A social action plan (SAP) is to be prepared for livelihood restoration which includes 
provision of capacity and activities for skills development. 
63. 
The Project through DGWR has to follow the provisions of the Land Acquisition Law No. 
2/2012 and all other relevant laws while harmonizing those with SPS 2009. The BBWS 3 Cis and 
BWSM  will  carry  out  project  activities, 
including  resettlement  plan  preparation  and 
implementation.  DGWR  will  carry  out  sub  project  screening.  If  a  subproject  triggers  land 
acquisition and/or involuntary resettlement, the implementing agency will prepare a screening and 
resettlement plan as outlined in Table 5.

The  implementation  of  the  resettlement  plans  for  the  core  subproject  and  future 
65. 
subprojects that require resettlement plans, will precede the commencement of civil works. No 
resettlement plan shall be implemented without prior concurrence from ADB. Efforts will be taken 
to avoid or minimize any adverse impacts. If unavoidable, mitigation measures to enhance or at 
least  restore  the  livelihoods  of  all  affected  persons  to  pre-project  levels,  and  to  improve  the 
standards of living of the displaced poor and other vulnerable groups will be made. People who 
are displaced will be given compensation at full replacement cost for their affected land assets, 
non-land  assets,  and  economic  losses  including  job  loss,  business  income  loss,  change  of 
profession, restriction in land use and livelihood, relocation assistances for physically relocated 
affected persons, and livelihood restoration program for vulnerable and severely affected persons 
as per agreed entitlement matrix. The project authorities in collaboration with local governments 
will arrange the livelihood and income restoration program for the affected persons through the 
SAP.  All  relevant  information  regarding  the  project  are  disseminated  and  the  opinions  of  the 
affected  persons  are  taken  into  consideration  in  developing  and/or  updating  the  resettlement 
plans. 
DGWR as the executing agency is responsible for overall implementation of project that

identifies 
70. 
The  project's  gender  classification  is  "Effective  Gender  Mainstreaming"  (EGM)  which 
means that at least two of the project outputs are targeted to support women active participation, 
access  to  projects  information  and  benefits  and  empowered  through  various  potential  skills 
development, leadership and support for livelihood activities.  
71. 
The  CPMU  will  recruit  a  National  Gender  Specialist  to  oversee  and  assist  in  the  GAP 
implementation, monitoring  and reporting for  each  river  basin  organization  in  coordination  with 
gender focal person and gender working group. The Project will ensure setting up of a Gender 
Working  Group  amongst  the  agencies.  Adequate  budget  has  been  allocated  for  GAP 
implementation, monitoring and reporting. DGWR in coordination with BBWS 3 Cis and BWSM, 
MOA,  MOHA  and  BAPPENAS  will  have  the  overall  responsibility  to  implement  the  GAP.  A 
national gender specialist will be hired to support GAP implementation. Gender focal persons will 
be assigned in each B/BWS, PIU in MOA, MOHA and BAPPENAS to ensure gender coordination 
and  linkage  across  the  various  activities  and  to  coordinate  the  introduction,  implementation, 
monitoring and reporting of the GAP. The quarterly project progress report will include monitoring 
of the GAP.

B. 
Monitoring 
72. 
Project  performance  monitoring.  A  list  of  verifiable  performance  indicators  will  be 
prepared by the CPMU in accordance with ADB’s project performance monitoring system (PPMS) 
by Q1 2017. The PPMS will be compatible with the executing agency monitoring system E-Mon 
and will include spatial visualization interface (GIS based). The system will establish a cause-and-
effect relationship between the Project and its impact. Three different types of monitoring will be 
carried  out:  (i)  implementation  progress  monitoring;  (ii)  safeguard  monitoring;  and  (iii)  benefit 
monitoring and evaluation. The PPMS will comprise (i) a comprehensive list of implementation-
related  performance 
indicators  (socioeconomic,  environmental,  physical)  duly  collected, 
monitored, and recorded by the CPIUs and PIUs and semi-annually assessed by the CPMU; and 
(ii) post-completion performance and impact data collected by the CPMU. The PPMS will include 
detailed definitions of impact, outcome and output indicators, procedures and schedules for data 
collection;  and  roles  and  responsibilities.  Implementation  of  the  PPMS  will  generate  data 
systematically  on  project  inputs,  outputs  and  outcomes  for  each  component,  as  well  as  on 
compliance, safeguard and social indicators. These data will be used to measure the project’s 
impact and its compliance with ADB safeguard policy requirements. Baseline and impact data will 
be  disaggregated  by  district  and  by  other  dimensions  to  be  discussed  at  project  inception. 
Implementation of performance monitoring will integrate financial and other aspects. The CPMU 
will establish the PPMS satisfactory to ADB within one year of the loan effective date.  
73. 
Compliance  monitoring.  The  Project  will  be  reviewed  jointly  by  the  executing  and 
implementing  agencies,  and  ADB  semi-annually  to  assess  implementation  progress.  A 
comprehensive midterm review will be carried out by the executing and implementing agencies 
and ADB three years after commencement of the project. Taking into account the PPMS results, 
the  midterm  review  will  (i)  review  and  evaluate  the  scope,  design,  and  implementation 
arrangements  of  the  project;  (ii)  evaluate  the  progress  of  the  institutional  development  and 
capacity of the implementing agencies; (iii) identify changes needed in any of the areas mentioned 
above; (iv) assess the implementation performance against agreed project indicators and targets; 
(v)  review  and  establish  compliance  with  the  loan  covenants;  and  (vi)  identify  critical  issues, 
problems, and constraints, if any, and, if necessary, recommend adjustments in project design or 
implementation arrangements. 
74. 
Safeguards  monitoring.  The  CPMU  will  assure  overall  planning,  coordination,  and 
reporting for the project. Qualified social and environmental safeguards officers will be appointed 
in the CPMU to support the CPIUs and PIUs. CPMU together with the BBWS 3 Cis and BWSM 
with  the  support  of  consultants  will  supervise  the  preparation  and  implementation  of  the 
resettlement  plans  and  will  monitor,  and  report  to  the  CPMU  on  all  social  and  environmental 
safeguards activities. Project progress reports will indicate which subprojects require resettlement 
plan  and  AMDAL,  and  the  status  of  implementation.  Semi-annual  monitoring  reports  on  the 
implementation  of  the  resettlement  plans  and  AMDAL’s  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  review. 
Safeguard monitoring reports will be posted on the ADB and project website and made available 
to the affected and beneficiary communities. The CPIU at Ministry of Agriculture and Ministry of 
Home  Affairs  will  report  the  voluntary  land  donation  and  recruit  an  independent  party  for  the 
verification of voluntary land donation to ensure that land donation do not severely affect to the 
living  standard  of  affected  persons  and  complies  with  the  above  mentioned  criteria.  Internal 
monitoring indicators and report template for involuntary resettlement are presented in Appendix 
9. 
75. 
Gender  and  social  dimensions  monitoring:  Covenants  as  well  as  process  and 
performance targets on gender empowerment and social inclusion as reflected in the Design and 
78 
Monitoring  Framework,  GAP  and  the  SPRSS  and  in  the  Communication  Strategy  will  be 
monitored through Project Performance Monitoring, compliance monitoring and through periodic 
evaluations and reviews. The BBWS 3 Cis and BWSM, PIUs in MOA, MOHA and BAPPENAS 
will also ensure that contractors comply with social safeguards in the SPRSS to address potential 
risks relative to the core labor standards and to health and environmental conditions at worker 
camps. 
76. 
Gender-specific indicators to monitor project outcomes and impacts will be established by 
the CPMU in coordination with the Gender and Social Development Specialist and in accordance 
with ADB’s PPMS. Critical gender and social issues, problems, and constraints are identified and 
course adjustments are recommended, as necessary. 
C. 
Evaluation 
77. 
The CPMU, CPIUs, PIUs, PPMUs and DPMUs will quarterly review and evaluate project 
performance, while the CPMU and ADB will jointly assess project implementation at least once 
every  year.  The  government,  CPMU,  and  ADB  will  conduct  a  comprehensive  midterm  review 
three years after the Project starts. The review will (i) cover the scope, design, and implementation 
arrangements of the Project; (ii) identify changes needed since the time of project appraisal; (iii) 
assess implementation performance against project indicators; (iv) establish compliance with loan 
covenants; and (v) identify problems, constraints, and, if necessary, recommend changes in the 
design or implementation arrangements. Within 6 months of physical completion of the Project, 
DGWR will submit a project completion report to ADB.44 
D. 
Reporting 
78. 
DGWR  will  provide  ADB  with  (i)  quarterly  progress  reports  in  a  format  consistent  with 
ADB's  project  performance  reporting  system;  (ii)  consolidated  annual  reports  including:  (a) 
progress achieved by output as measured through the indicator's performance targets, (b) key 
implementation  issues  and  solutions,  (c)  updated  procurement  plan,  and  (d)  updated 
implementation plan for next 12 months; and (iii) a project completion report within 6 months of 
physical  completion  of  the  Project.  To  ensure that the  Project  continues to  be  both  viable  and 
sustainable,  the  Project’s  accounts  and  the  executing  agency  audited  financial  statements 
together with the associated auditor's report should be adequately reviewed. The template for the 
quarterly progress report is presented in Appendix 10.  
E. 
Stakeholder Communication Strategy 
To ensure effective communication with stakeholders during project implementation, and 
79. 
to enhance project outcomes, the Project will adopt a four-pronged communication strategy: 
(i)  Deliver relevant project information to stakeholders in a culturally appropriate, gender-
sensitive, and timely manner; 
(ii)  Obtain accurate and timely feedback from stakeholders; 
(iii) Enable  an  efficient  and  regular  two-way  flow  of  information  between  project 
implementers and stakeholders; and 
44 Project  completion  report  format  is  available  at:  http://www.adb.org/Consulting/consultants-toolkits/PCR-Public-
Sector-Landscape.rar 
79 
(iv) Support  key  communication  components  of  the  project,  including  community 
awareness  raising  for  flood  risk  management;  community  participation  in  needs 
identification;  outreach  for  integrated  flood  management;  and  public  awareness  on 
spatial plans and land use management. 
Stakeholders  include  but  are  not  limited  to  project  affected  persons,  women  and 
80. 
vulnerable  groups,  other  interested  groups  including  users  of  the  rivers,  those  affected  by 
flooding,  executing  and  implementing  agencies,  relevant  village,  sub-district,  district  and 
provincial  government  staff  and  entities,  interested  community  based  organizations,  and 
interested private sector entities. 
81. 
The CPMU will be responsible for implementing and monitoring information dissemination 
and  disclosure,  and  will  identify  a  focal  point  that  will  be  designated  for  regular  contact  with 
affected people and other interested stakeholders. 
82. 
Delivering information. Information about the project as a whole, including information 
about project plans, projected impacts, and implementation timelines, will be delivered through a 
public  information  booklet  (PIB)  that  describes  the  project’s  objectives,  components,  and 
activities. Written in Bahasa Indonesia, the PIB will use pictures and simplify concepts to make 
the project comprehensible to a wide range of stakeholder groups including the poor, women, and 
users of the river systems such as cattle growers and households. The PIB will highlight all key 
aspects of the project, including features that will directly benefit stakeholders such as staircases 
for easy access to women and children to wash and bathe. The PIB may be complemented with 
community  meetings  and puppet shows,  which have been found  to  be stakeholders’  preferred 
means of information-sharing based on experience with other projects in Indonesia. Information 
will  also  be  shared  through  other  culturally  appropriate  communication  channels,  and  key 
information materials may be developed for distinct stakeholder groups.  Pursuant to ADB’s Public 
Communications Policy, all requisite project documents will be posted on the ADB website.  
83. 
For some project activities, specific means of delivering information to stakeholders are 
required. For civil works, clear signage will be put up in strategic areas not just to provide summary 
information about the project and its construction, but also to ensure public safety. For community-
based flood risk management, leaflets specifically designed for this component will be distributed 
in  villages.  This  may  be  supplemented  with  community  events  to  role  play  or  otherwise 
demonstrate what are expected from stakeholders. For farmland management and sustainable 
agriculture,  and  watershed rehabilitation  and management,  leaflets  will  also be  distributed  and 
meetings held. As much as possible, each stakeholder group will be met with separately, as they 
have different interests.  
Obtaining  Feedback.  The  PIB  will  indicate  where  stakeholders  can  get  in  touch  with 
84. 
project implementers. Community meetings will ensure that accurate and sufficient feedback will 
be received from stakeholder groups.  
Ensuring Efficient, Two-Way Flow of Information. Establishing a project desk in key 
85. 
districts and/or strengthening of existing structure will be explored to ensure that more substantive 
information will be available to stakeholders whenever they need it, and that a competent person 
is available to receive feedback from stakeholders.  
86. 
Supporting  Key  Communications  Components  of  Project.  The  project  contains  a 
number of components requiring communication activities, including the establishment of flood 
80 
communication  procedures  (preparation  of  communication  and  outreach  strategy,  public 
awareness on revised special and land use management plans), awareness raising for flood risk 
management, and the identification of community needs. Appropriate plans will be put in place to 
ensure the successful implementation of these communication activities.

ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISM 
90. 
People who are, or may in the future be, adversely affected by the  Project may submit 
complaints  to  ADB’s  Accountability  Mechanism.  The  Accountability  Mechanism  provides  an 
independent forum and process whereby people adversely affected by ADB-assisted projects can 
voice,  and  seek  a  resolution  of  their  problems,  as  well  as  report  alleged  violations  of  ADB’s 
operational  policies  and  procedures.  Before  submitting  a  complaint  to  the  Accountability 
Mechanism, affected people should make a good faith effort to solve their problems by working 
with  the  concerned  ADB  operations  department.    Only  after  doing  that,  and  if  they  are  still 
dissatisfied, should they approach the Accountability Mechanism.47

The lack of effective flood and landslide forecasting

behind increased losses and damages. The current 
practice  of  flood  alerts  relies  on  the  meteorological 
forecast by Agency for Meteorology, Climatology and 
Geophysics  (Badan  Meteorologi,  Klimatologi  dan

Center for Water Resources (NRCWR – PusAir) has 
also  developed  a  public  rainfall  data  server  system 
that has been used in some cases for flood alerts, but 
not yet in the 3 CIs and Ambon – Seram RBTs. This

provide technical inputs to the project with close 
coordination with BMKG. 
OBJECTIVES 
The  general  objective  of  this  component  is  to 
enhance basin data and information system for 
improved preparedness and planning of FRM. It 
the  hydro-meteorological 
will  help  develop 
database and information management system 
that  has  implication  in  FFEWS  in  the  selected 
RBTs. The specific objectives are to (i) improve 
the quality and quantity of hydro-meteorological 
data, (ii) develop 2D flood modeling and map the 
hazards, 
flood 
management plans which then will be integrated 
into  water  resources  management  plans  and 
other  development  activities  in  the  basin,  (iv) 
develop  comprehensive  and  location-specific 
landslide  and  FFEW  systems  for  the  river 
basins,  (v)  map  the  flood  risk  (hazard  and 
exposure)  to  provide  the  basis  for  decision 
making,  (vi)  develop  the  capacity  of  RBOs  in 
operation  and  maintenance  of  databases  as 
well  as  FFEW  systems  and,  (vii)  develop 
decision  support  systems  for  short  and  long 
term  FRM  including  danger  to  life,  damage  to

However,  the  effectiveness  of  the  system  is  very 
often questioned due to the short lead-time. Also the 
flood warning information often does not reach village 
level  in  a  timely  and  understandable  manner.  In 
is  no  FFEWS.  There  are  no 
Ambon, 
hydrological  monitoring  stations  in  Batu  Merah  and 
surrounding  basins.  Both  river  basin  organizations 
(RBOs)  need  to  develop  the  reliable  (a)  improved 
hydro-meteorological  network  and  database,  (b) 
hydrological  basin  model 
including  sediment 
transport, (c) 2D flood model and forecast procedure, 
and (d) decision support system for both emergency 
response and long-term flood management planning 
including water resources management in the basin. 
There  is  a  need  for  establishing  forecast  and  early 
warning  systems  for  landslides,  flash  flood,  river 
erosion and riverine floods. While the riverine flood in 
the 3 Cis RBT can be forecast by applying a robust 
hydrological  model,  a  river  bed/bank  erosion  model 
can be coupled with a hydrological model to forecast 
the  river  erosion.  However,  early  warning  system 
(EWS) for landslide and flash flood is a challenging 
work  due  to  very  short  time  of  occurrence  of  such 
hazards.  Therefore, 
require 
standalone automatic warning system based on the 
real-time  observation  of  triggering  factors  and  their 
threshold  levels  such  as  rainfall  depth,  intensity, 
duration and slope stability.  
hazards 
these 
With the help of a database and flood model analysis, 
the potential hazard extent needs to be mapped and 
a risk map to be prepared accordingly. These maps 
will provide a basis for the development of the flood 
risk management (FRM) plans and the spatial plans 
for the region. This process would be guided by the 
RBT coordinating forum (TKPSDA) with its enhanced 
capacity. 
BENEFITS  
The  main  benefits  are  those  arising  from  the 
development  of  (i)  rainfall  runoff  observations  (ii) 
FFEWS, (iii) flood risk map of the entire basins and 
the large scale flood hazard maps of the basins and 
of  each  locality  and,  (iv)  development  of  the  FRM 
plans.  For  example,  in  Ciujung,  the  flood  forecast 
system will help increase the forecast lead-time by 6 
hours in the lower basin.  People  living  in 450 small 
settlements along the bank of the river downstream 
of  the  Pamarayan  weir  can  save  their  lives  and 
valuable  properties  from  flood  hazard.  Likewise 
installation  of  standalone  landslide  and  flash  flood 
warning in Ciujung, Way Ruhu and  Batu Merah will 
reduce  the  number  of  disaster  casualties  and  the 
household  damages.  The  improved  flood  risk  map

floods  have 
Landslides,  riverbank  erosion  and 
become annual phenomena in the Cidanau-Ciujung-
Cidurian (3 Cis) river basin territory (RBT). One of the 
most  serious  contributing  factors  to  the  hazard 
situation in the RBT is degraded watersheds due to 
poor  farm  management  and  deforestation.  This 
resulted in increased sediment yield and the peak of 
runoff  during  intense  rain  fall  event.  Sediment 
deposition in the main river channels leads to channel 
instability  and  bank  erosion  and  has  reduced  the 
conveyance capacity of the Ciujung river, increasing 
the flood hazard over time. 
Sustainable farming practices as well as afforestation 
should be implemented as a part of integrated flood 
risk  management.  Watershed  management, 
particularly  soil  and  water  conservation  activities,  if

implement  agro-forestry  related  activities  aiming  at 
soil and water conservation. Terracing practices will 
be promoted in the same areas. The Project will also 
support livelihood options to the famers that include 
provision for cattle (source of organic fertilizer), farm 
equipment, seeds and seedlings of a variety of high

will  be  improved.  The  introduction  of  improved 
farming practices include soil and water conservation 
measures  that  will  also  support  reduction  of  flood 
peaks and volumes downstream. The productivity of 
the land will be improved through the uses of organic 
fertilizers  and  advance  farming  practices.  In  the

RATIONALE 
Landslides,  riverbank  erosion  and 
floods  have 
become  annual  phenomena  in  the  (i)  Cidanau  – 
Ciujung - Cidurian (3 Cis) RBT, Banten Province, and 
(ii) Ambon - Seram RBT, Maluku Province. The flood 
risk condition in selected RBTs is worsening due to 
both natural and human induced factors. One of the 
serious  aspects  is  the  large  number  of  landslides 
scattered  all  over  the  river  basins,  which  are 
producing a huge amount of sediment yield annually. 
This has caused river bed aggradation and increased 
flood peaks during intense rainfall events. Sediment 
deposition in the main river channels further leads to 
channel instability, bank erosion and has reduced the 
discharge capacity of the rivers, increasing the flood 
hazard over time. Poor soil and water conservation, 
not only in the farm, but also at the settlements and 
unused  lands,  has  had  exacerbated  the  runoff 
situations in both selected river basins territories.   
Ideally  both  structural  and  non-structural  measures 
particularly  to  control  the  sediment  yield  from  the 
shallow landslide areas, which involve the  drainage 
and  reinforcement  of  the  existing  and  potential 
landslide areas are prime important and urgent need 
in  selected  RBTs.  The  watershed  management 
through  water  conservation  at  household  level  as 
well  as  in  public  land  should  be  implemented  as  a 
part  of  integrated  flood  risk  management  in  both 
RBTs. 
Watershed  management  activities  should  be 
implemented  with  appropriate  coordination  of 
activities  among  different  line  agencies’  and  with 
better  understanding  of  upstream-downstream 
interaction. The main objective is to reduce  the soil

IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS 
The Ministry of Home Affairs (MOHA) will be the 
implementing  agency  for  this  component  and 
activities  will  be  closely  coordinated  with  the 
provincial and district planning and development 
agencies 
(BAPPEDAs).  A  Central  Project 
Implementation Unit (CPIU) will be established 
in Directorate General of Regional Development 
(DGRD)  under  the  MOHA,  which  will  oversee 
the  overall  implementation  of  the  component. 
The  CPIU  will  be  led  by  the  Directorate  of 
Synchronization  of  Regional  Government 
Affairs I (SORGA I)  under DGRD. To implement 
the project at the local levels, Provincial Project 
Management Units (PPMU) and District Project 
Management  Units  (DPMU)  will  be  formed 
under  the  BAPPEDA  province  and  district 
respectively.  Local  agencies  for  Forestry  will 
contribute  to  implementation  of  the  activities 
related to this component. 
OBJECTIVES 
The  general  objective  of  this  component  is  to 
improve  conditions  of  the  critical  land  in  upper 
river  basins  to  reduce  soil  erosion  through 
improved  land  management  and  to  reduce 
runoff  through  rainfall  runoff  interception.  The 
specific objectives are to (i) stabilize the existing 
landslides  by  structural  and  bio-engineering 
works,  (ii)  identify  and  control  the  possible 
occurrence of landslide in highly landslide prone 
areas,  (iii)  construct  small  ponds  to  serve  dual 
purposes  of  on-farm  water  supply  and/or 
household consumption (CBFRM), (iv) regulate 
the  land  use  through  issuance  of  regulations 
endorsed  and  supervised  by 
local 
government, (v) improve  livelihoods of farmers 
to  control  natural  hazard, 
improving  skills 
implement rainfall harvesting technologies and,  
(vi)  promote  community  participation  and 
integrated  action  plans  for  the  sustainability  of 
the adopted systems.

extends  not  only  to  damage  to  residential 
areas  and  agriculture  farms  but  includes 
widespread damage and interruption of public 
services 
transportation,  power 
supply,  communication  etc.  The  flood  in  the 
Ciujung  river  in  2012  caused  a  week  long 
interruption of an important national highway, 
while livelihoods were at a standstill for about 
a month in the entire region. In 2013, massive 
physical  damage 
the  residential  and 
commercial areas of Ambon city was caused 
by flash floods from five adjoining small rivers 
and particularly from the Batu Merah and Way 
Ruhu  rivers.  Improvement  of  flood  control 
infrastructure  is an urgent  need to safeguard 
the  social  and  economic  development  in  all 
selected river basins particularly  in the areas 
where  rapid  urbanization  has  been  taking 
place.

RATIONALE 
Landslides, riverbank erosion and floods have become 
annual  phenomena  in  the  (i)  Cidanau–  Ciujung-
Cidurian (3 Cis) RBT, Banten Province, and (ii) Ambon 
-  Seram  RBT,  Maluku  Province.  The  flood  risk 
condition in the river basins is worsening due to both 
natural and human induced factors. 
rapid  urbanization 
High  population  density  and 
accompanied  with  land  use  changes  in  the  upstream 
Ciujung  river  basin  (e.g.  forest  cover  changed  from 
58%  in  2000  to  22%  in  2009,  and  at  the  same  time 
urban  area  increased  from  22%  in  2000  to  58%  in 
2009), has contributed to an increased peak flood flows 
by nearly 4 times since 1996. This situation is similar in 
Ambon city in Maluku. 
In Ciujung, the recent worst flood event was recorded 
in  the  first  week  of  January  2012,  which  caused 
significant  loss  and  damage  in  Lebak,  Serang  and 
Pandeglang  districts.  The  fatal  flood  also  occurred  in 
Ambon  city  in  July  2012  and  2013.  The  lack  of  flood 
forecasting  and  early  warning  system  has  been 
considered to be one of the causes behind increased 
losses due to the floods and landslides. Although the 
early warning information was issued in Ciujung mainly 
to the area downstream of the Pamarayan weir, there 
was a poor community response as communities were 
not well aware and prepared for evacuation on time. 
Losses due to flooding continue increasing each year. 
This  is  particularly  because  there  is  a  lack  of  local 
communities’ awareness, participation and ownership 
in the development process. In Ambon, poor drainage 
network  and  solid  waste  management  has  had 
exacerbated the flood risk situation. The community’s 
participation  in  the  planning,  design,  implementation 
and  management of community’s water  infrastructure 
is therefore essential. 
Where structural interventions are not feasible or have 
limited  effects,  communities  will  be  engaged 
in 
preparation  of  emergency 
response  planning, 
procedures, and evacuation provisions. Non-structural 
measures  can  demonstrate  significant  cost-benefit 
implemented  alongside 
ratios,  especially  when

any project loan. In addition, the Investment Program 
will  assist  the  NSCWR  through  the  CPIU  to  promote 
the cooperation and coordination with multiple entities 
to synergize the benefits of the project. 
BENEFITS  
The  primary  benefit  of  this  subcomponent  will  be  the 
effective monitoring and evaluation of the Project and 
the institutionalization of the FRM approach nationwide 
COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT 
The involvement of the community in project monitoring 
and  evaluation  is  expected  through  the  community 
based flood risk management, in which the organized 
communities themselves will monitor and evaluate the 
project progress. This will feed back to the monitoring 
and evaluation of the project by CPIU at BAPPENAS.

APPENDIX 3:  FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTATION 
PROCESS 
1. 
Introduction 
1. 
The shift from flood control to flood management is in process in Indonesia and has yet to 
be progressed. Coordination of planning for flood management between the multiple agencies 
with a role in flood risk management needs to be strengthened. This document lays out the overall 
flood  risk  management  (FRM)  approach,  steps  to  be  undertaken  and  important  features  to  be 
considered to obtain full benefits.

Under  the  Project,  the  Directorate  General  of  Water  Resources  (DGWR)  of  Ministry  of 
Public  Works  and  Housing  (MPWH),  the  Directorate  General  of  Agricultural  Infrastructure  and 
Facility (DGAIF), Ministry of Agriculture (MOA); the Directorate General of Regional Development 
(DGRD), Ministry of Home Affairs (MOHA); and Directorate for Water Resources and Irrigation 
(DWRI),  State  Ministry  of  National  Development  Planning/National  Development  Planning 
Agency (Bappenas) are actively involved and these ministries will coordinate with the Ministry of 
Environment  and  Forestry  and  the  disaster  agencies  (BPB)  at  national,  provincial  and  district 
levels  to  plan  and  design  their  activities.  Since  the  project  is  expected  to  be  the  showcase for 
effective FRM, the government will expand the know-how with participation of more agencies in 
184     Appendix 3      
the future. The Project will serve as model for the government to learn the lessons and to develop 
the long-term flood management plan country wide.   
4. 
In order to provide an enabling environment to these ministries and agencies to work on 
FRM,  there  is  considerable  work  to  translate  the  FRM  principles  in  legislation  into  practical 
guidelines and models for flood management. This requires (i) technical guidelines suited to local 
government needs and staff, and (ii) training for local government and others, that goes beyond 
routine socialization work of the Government (sosialisasi). The Project will contribute toward these 
objectives. 
5. 
Coordination of activities is critical in flood management. The involved ministries and local 
governments will work together in areas such as (i) communication of rainfall data and quantitative 
precipitation forecast (QPF) for flood forecasting and early warning, (ii) operation of civil works, 
(iii) development of flood risk management strategies and plans and the public consultation that 
should accompany that process, (iv) cooperation on upland watershed conservation programs, 
and  (v)  incorporation  of  flood  information  into  spatial,  sectoral  midterm  and  annual  plans. 
Disseminating the information and preparing communities will require considerable resources and 
excellent communications.  
6. 
The  development  of  technical  capacity  of  government  agencies  should  be  proposed  in 
different  forms,  including  developing  and  running  the  hydrological  and  flood  models.  The 
Research and Development Agency for Water Resources (PUSAIR) need to be mobilized to bring 
in the technical expertise into the river basin authorities. The aforementioned concerns and issues 
have been reflected in the Project design. 
3. 
Needs Assessment for Flood Management 
7. 
There is a need for rigorous flood risk assessments to identify current issues, challenges, 
needs and prioritize the areas and project interventions. An expanded flood problem tree is shown 
in  Figure  1.  In  doing  so,  the  assessment  considers future  needs  in the context  of  the  adopted 
strategic framework of flood risk management. The framework recommended and adopted for the 
Project is illustrated in Figure 2. The strategic framework defines flood risk as the product of three 
essential elements of risk: hazard, exposure and vulnerability. Each of these elements of flood 
risk can be treated or managed.

The strategic framework also includes the institutional foundation as another component 
8. 
that can be treated in flood management, and the planning activities that are undertaken within 
the institutions. Appended to the main framework are safeguard provisions that serve to minimize 
the generic risk of adverse consequences on the extraneous physical environment and human 
society:  social  and  environmental  safeguards,  and  provisions  for  adequate  community 
consultation. The measures used to treat each of the essential elements of flood risk are generally 
distinct.

There are two types of measures that can be applied to treat, manage and modify flood 
hazard: 
(i)  Structural measures that modify the physical characteristics of floods (extent, frequency, 
depth, duration, etc.); and 
(ii)  Conservation  measures 
flood 
characteristics (e.g. runoff volume, flood peaks), but also contribute to waterway stability 
and the sustainability of structural measures by reducing erosion. 
land  use  management 
that  also  modify 
through 
10. 
There are several measures that can be applied to modify flood exposure i.e. people and 
assets. The exposure to the flood risk can be modified by land use management measures. Land 
use regulations may limit the number of people exposed, or limit the value of assets exposed. 
Although  it  is  not  impossible,  it  may  be  very  difficult  to  modify  existing  Land-use,  and  so  land 
management measures are most effective when directed at future development and land use. By 
regulating  residential  development  to  manage  population  increase  in  hazard  areas,  and  by 
managing  the  types  of  enterprise  permitted  in  hazard  areas,  exposure  to  flood  hazard  can  be 
contained at or near current levels. 
11. 
Likewise, a way of classifying measures that modify vulnerability is according to whether 
the  actions  (associated  with  planning)  are  taken  pre-flood,  during  flood  emergencies,  or  post-
flood. 
(i)  Pre-Flood Management Measures to Modify Vulnerability 
(ii)  Management Measures to Modify Vulnerability During Flood Emergencies 
(iii) Post-Flood Management Measures to Modify Vulnerability 
4. 
Flood Management Planning  
12. 
FRM should start at planning level at river basin scale. In this regard, Indonesia is well 
placed with a national coverage of river basin organizations for water resources management. 
The  strategy  of  preparing  polas  (strategic  plans)  and  rencanas  (master  plans  to  guide 
implementation  of  the  strategy)  provide  a  sound  framework  for  IWRM  at  river  basin  scale  as 
shown in figure below: 
188     Appendix 3      
RKM/CAP 
Figure 3. WRM planning process  
Appendix 3      189 
These  plans  address  IWRM  in  general,  including  the  management  of  water  damaging 
13. 
potentials. However there is a need to further detail the Rencanas for effective implementation of 
FRM. The development of river basin flood risks management plans (FRMPs) is central in the 
process  to  integrate  the  flood  management  in  spatial  plans,  adhering  to  the  structured  or 
systematic  planning  procedure.  Beginning  of  the  FRMP  process  is  the  acquisition  of  detailed 
topographic  data  of  flood  risk  land  and  river  cross-sections  for  flood  modelling  purposes. 
Acquisition of detailed topographic data of flood risk land will also be a valuable resource for future 
spatial  planning  and  development  planning.  FRMPs  will  further  detail  and  complement  the 
established  planning  framework  of  polas  and  rencanas.  The  more  detailed  provisions  of  the 
FRMP should then be reflected into future revisions of the rencana. Preparation of a FMRP takes 
place  under the  guidance  of  the  consultative  bodies  established for  the pola/rencana  planning 
process  (e.g.    basin  and/or  provincial  water  resources  coordination  forum)  to  ensure  linkage. 
Appropriate milestones would be near the beginning and end of the process: first to advise on the 
FRMP  process  and  receive  feedback;  and  later  to  review  the  preferred  FMP  option  before  its 
finalization  and  approval  by  the  Balais,  and  the  provincial  Governor.  By  these  means  the 
preparation  of  the  FRMP  would  complement  the  current  planning  process  for  IWRM.  These 
aspects are well reflected in the Project design illustrated in Figure 4.

A  technical  manual  (or  guidelines)  will  be  prepared  during  the  implementation  of  the 
14. 
Project that will guide the RBOs in the preparation of the FRMP, and the consultants or research 
institutes engaged to undertake the technical inputs. The Coordinator appointed to the Central 
Project Management Unit (CPIU) under the Directorate of River and Coast (DRC) for the Project, 
will provide advise to the RBO. The TKPSDA  which has representation from all agencies with 
key roles in FRM, e.g. DGWR, BPBD, Forestry, Agriculture, BMKG, Bappeda, as well as BPBD 
and water resources agencies (balai and Dinas PSDA); and that those representatives, will be 
provided with opportunity to participate actively in the plan preparation process.  
5. 
Spatial Planning and Flood Management 
15. 
Spatial  planning  is  a  critical  element  in  management  of  exposure  to  flood  hazard. 
Exposure increases as settlement grows in locations where there is flood hazard, but this is not 
always  well  understood  or  acted  upon.  Spatial  plans  should  contain  regulations  that  limit  any 
increase in exposure to flood hazard. In order for that to succeed, the spatial planning systems 
(Figure 5), which are under the regional planning agencies (Bappeda) need to be closely linked 
to information generated on flood hazard. 
2.   
16. 
Development planning is relevant to flooding as it guides the location and density of urban 
and industrial development, and promotes rural and urban industries and economic enterprise. 
Knowing  the  general  features  of  future  plans  for  cities  and  rural  areas  is  important  when 
considering how flood events may affect settled areas in the future and what damage or losses 
may  occur.  The  Spatial  Planning  Law  (Law  No.  26/2008)  refers  to  the  need  to  minimise  the 
impacts  of  disasters  on  Indonesian  society.  The  development  planning  system  in  Indonesia 
applies to all levels of government, and authority to draft socioeconomic development plans is 
provided according to the National Development Planning System (Law No. 25/2004). 
Figure 5. Spatial planning system in Indonesia54 
54 Source: MLIT (http://www.mlit.go.jp/kokudokeikaku/international/spw/general/indonesia/index_e.html) 
192     Appendix 3      
The spatial planning system also operates at all levels of government. The national spatial 
17. 
plan is necessarily general, but should take into account flood risk as a key issue. The current 
national spatial plan was enacted with Law No. 26/2008 on Spatial Planning. It covers a 20-year 
period, but is to be reviewed every five years. The first round of detailed spatial plans under the 
new Spatial Planning Law has been accomplished and approved, and will govern development 
throughout Indonesia. An important feature of the spatial plans and the legislation is to criminalize 
divergence from the plan. Thus, where any infrastructure or building is constructed outside the 
zonings identified in the spatial plan it will be considered illegal and public infrastructure that is 
not compliant with a spatial plan may not be funded by the Ministry of Finance. 
18. 
It  is  important  to  incorporate  flood  risk  information  into  the  district/city  detailed  spatial 
plans, which identify land at plot or parcel level. If the information is available, flood hazard map 
information  should  be  overlaid  on  the  spatial  plan  to  identify  flood  hazard  characteristics  (e.g. 
frequency, depth, etc.), indicating the level of flood hazard (flood hazard zones). Only in this way 
is it likely that the plans will have some effect on the location and features of development, when 
people become aware that there is a real flood risk in that area. 
19. 
A second spatial planning issue is the identification of “floodways‟, or tracts of land that 
should  be  kept  open  for  floodwaters  to  pass  and  flow  away  as  rapidly  as  possible.  Such  land 
would be restricted to low density development and it is clear that public consultation would be 
important  when  delineating  such  zones.  The  design  of  floodways  (meaning  land  kept  clear  of 
development that would impede the flow of water) is one possible element in a FRMP. If such a 
strategy  is  adopted  in  a  FRMP,  there  needs  to  be  a  direct  connection  between  the  data  and 
strategies in the FRMP and the relevant spatial plans. 
20. 
There  are  some  matters  included  in  flood  emergency  response  plans  that  should  be 
considered  in  spatial  plans.  Flood  emergency  response  plans  are  the  responsibility  of  BPBD 
(under the umbrella of BNPB) and a directive on these has been issued. Some elements in an 
emergency  response  plan  are  relevant  to  spatial  plans,  such  as  identifying  and  maintaining 
evacuation  routes,  maintaining  access  to  infrastructure  for  flood  fighting  and  evacuation,  and 
locating facilities such as refuge shelters. Therefore BPBD also needs to have input to the spatial 
planning process. The public consultation on strategies, and at the stage where detailed zonings 
and regulations are being designed or updated, will include both the flood management and the 
spatial planning agencies working together. The spatial plans require the flood risk criteria in order 
to incorporate flood risk into decisions about land use. 
The Project will support the local Governments to upgrade the spatial plans based on the 
21. 
comprehensive  flood  risk  assessment.  To  do  this,  flood  hazard,  exposure  and  vulnerability 
assessment and mapping will be carried out in the selected RBTs. The building codes and the 
guidelines will be compiled to help facilitate the development and implementation of the FMRP 
and the spatial plans. The participatory approach of formulating the spatial plan will be promoted 
by involving all stakeholders including local communities. 
6. 
Integration of Flood Management Plan 
22. 
There are several types of plan that have a bearing on the management of flood risk and 
several  agencies  are  involved  in  those  plans.  There  is  a  need  to  strengthen  the  planning 
framework and to ensure that it is well coordinated to produce the best end results. The current 
plans fall into three general categories: 
(i)  Water resources or river basin plans (pola and rencana) 
Appendix 3      193 
(ii)  Disaster  management  plans,  including  components  plans  for  preparation,  emergency 
response and post-disaster,  
(iii) Spatial plans, and 
(iv) Mid term and annual sectoral plans at national, provincial and district levels. 
23. 
Thematic plans are legislated for their particular functions as follows: 
Type of plan  
River basin pola  
River basin rencana  
Disaster management plans  
Emergency response plans  
Strategic spatial plans  
Detailed spatial plans  
Catchment (watershed) 
management plans (Forestry)

FRMP shares some features with plans listed above. The relationship between the various 
24. 
plans is shown in the following Figure 6. 
Figure 6. Relationship between plans for flood risk management 
25. 
The  river  basin  plan  (rencana)  does  not  cover  flooding  in  the  same  detail  as  a  FRMP 
should. The rencana would deal with many different water management issues in the river basin 
and  flood  management  could  only  be  indicative,  while  FRMP  should  be  a  detail  document.  It 
would be based on a study of the river basin (or a part of a basin) and identify in detail the flood 
risk  in  the  river  basin  and  accurately  map  flood  hazard  areas.  On  the  basis  of  the  technical 
194     Appendix 3      
investigations  and  mapping,  the  FMP  would  identify  appropriate  flood  management  measures 
and responses. 
26. 
Information from the FRMP and its supporting study should be incorporated in the relevant 
spatial plans. The FRMP would also have some elements in common with a disaster management 
plan,  as  stipulated  in  the  Disaster  Management  Law.  These  could  include  measures  for 
preparedness, risk reduction and evacuation /emergency response. The FRMP process should 
be conducted in cooperation with the agencies responsible for the other related plans, and the  
TKPSDA is the platform for this process.  
27. 
A  FRMP  should  be  a  multi-agency  responsibility.  Flood  management  relies  on  the 
coordinated  participation  of multiple  agencies.  Moving  from  a flood  control  and flood  response 
paradigm  to  a  flood  risk  management  paradigm  means  that  agencies  that  used  to  operate 
independently  should  now  plan  together  and  sometimes  develop  joint  programs,  or  at  least 
coordinate  plans  and  programs.  This  philosophy  is  clearly  stated  in  the  Disaster  Management 
Law, and the institutional structure for disaster management is intended to coordinate inputs from 
multiple agencies. Coordination is a vital element in successful flood risk management too. The 
plan should be coordinated through and endorsed by the TKPSDA . In that respect, TKPSDA ’s 
role should be enhanced beyond its current mandates to have just two meetings – one to discuss 
the issues, and the second to discuss the draft. Therefore the TKPSDA  should be strengthened 
in its role and functions.

The purpose of a stakeholder consultation plan is to ensure that implementation of flood 
28. 
risk management measures proceeds with stakeholders commitment and meets the real needs 
of  beneficiaries,  including  communities  at  risk  from  flooding.  Programs  to  raise  awareness  of 
communities  at  risk  are  also  an  effective  approach  to  flood  risk  management.  Community 
preparedness reduces vulnerability to the adverse impacts of floods. 
29. 
Stakeholder  Workshops.  To  capture  broader  participation,  stakeholder  workshops  and 
community  consultations  are  important,  particularly  at  provincial  and  river  basin  district  levels. 
Workshops  should  draw  representation  from  multiple  agencies  with  roles  in  integrated  flood 
management,  but  more  from  those  involved  at  provincial  and  river  basin  scales,  and  with 
representatives from selected district and selected water user and farmer associations.  
Community  Consultation.  Community  consultation  should  commence  soon  after 
30. 
commencement  of  the  planning  process  immediately  following  initial  steps  of  definition  of 
management objectives and understanding of the planning context. Community group meetings 
should  be  organized  at  appropriate  intervals  during  the  planning  procedure,  and  should  be 
attended by representatives from the relevant RBO and district and provincial agency. Community 
consultation  should  continue  into  the  implementation  phase,  particularly  during  feasibility  and 
design of structural flood management measures. The key areas for community consultation will 
be  with  communities  at  risk  from  flooding  –  typically  in  lower  river  basins  –  and  with  selected 
communities in middle and upper river basins where watershed conservation sub-programs are 
proposed in upland agricultural and forestry areas. Separate consultations will be necessary at 
more localized scale where resettlement will occur. 
31. 
Plan  Preparation  Working  Groups:  Preparation  of  FRMPs  should  be  driven  by  a  multi-
agency committee or working group that adequately represents the partnership entailed for well 
integrated flood risk management. Because FRMPs will be prepared at river basin scale, there 
Appendix 3      195 
should be one working group for each river basin selected – a Plan Preparation Working Group 
(PPWG). Their role, under the leadership of the RBO, would be to organize and review terms of 
reference for the inputs required to undertake FRMP preparation, facilitate the collection of data 
inputs, review the work performed, advise on selection of flood management options, and approve 
or recommend revisions to the preferred flood management option before the FRMP is finalized.  
32. 
The main inputs to preparation of a FRMP will be supported by consultants responsible 
for all technical inputs, e.g.: topographic survey; engineering, technical and economic /financial 
analysis; community consultation and social impact analysis; environmental impact analysis. A 
Coordinator from the Project Management Consultant (PMC) or a CPMU manager could advise 
the PPWG on inputs and terms of reference required for plan preparation, especially in the initial 
phases. 
33. 
There are already coordinating forums (TKPSDA s) in river basin districts which have a 
role in the preparation and review of Polas and Rencanas, but their role is different to that required 
here, so it is proposed that the PPWG should be a separate group. Membership of the PPWG 
would  include  provincial,  balai,  and  District  representatives,  and  possibly  representatives  of 
farmer  associations;  and  it  is  proposed  that  the  PPWG  be  chaired  by  the  relevant  balai  WS 
(national,  or  provincial),  although  this  could  vary  from  river  basin  to  river  basin.  Proposed 
membership would include representatives from provincial Dinas Pengairan, BMKG, Bappeda, 
BPBD, Home Affairs and Agriculture at either or both provincial or District levels, and – if farmer 
representatives are included – from selected farmer or water user associations in areas exposed 
to  flood  risk,  and  from  upland  areas  where  watershed  conservation  programs  are  proposed. 
Although the intervals may vary at different stages of FRMP preparation, PPWGs should expect 
to meet at approximately 1½ month intervals throughout plan preparation, which is typically likely 
to last about 12 months. 
8. 
Mainstreaming Climate Change 
34. 
IPCC  projections  for  global  climate  change  in  most  of  the  Indonesian  archipelago  – 
including the provinces of Banten and Maluku – predict only small increases in precipitation by 
the late 21st century, generally less than in most other parts of Asia. Seasonally, there may be a 
greater distinction between wet and dry seasons, with a higher percentage of annual rainfall in 
the wet season. More significantly, the intensity of heavy rainfall during storms is likely to increase 
–  by  as  much  as  5%  per  ºC.  These  changes  are  likely  to  cause  some  increase  in  flood  peak 
discharges and flood frequency, but in the absence of more detailed studies these changes are 
difficult to quantify. The projections of global climate change are more definite that sea levels will 
rise with increasing global temperatures. This will affect the flat coastal plain and estuary of the 
selected river basins. 
The  Project  addresses  adaptation  to  climate  change  in  several  respects.  Firstly,  flood 
35. 
management measures reduce the risk of danger and damages from flood regardless of climate 
change, but the benefits are increased if the adverse impacts of climate change occur. In general, 
they  are  therefore  win-win  measures.  Secondly,  the  project  follows  a  comprehensive  risk 
management approach, and will prepare FRMPs that embrace a combination of structural and 
non-structural measures. Non-structural measures function to manage the residual risk that is not 
or  cannot  be  managed by  structural  measures, and  will  be  implemented  to manage  increased 
residual  risk  if  the  standard  of  protection  provided  by  structural  measures  declines  due  to  the 
impacts of future climate change. Thirdly, the land use management, soil and water conservation 
measures  included  in  the  project  will  counter  the  negative  effects  of  climate  change  within the 
river basins. Fourthly, an extra margin of freeboard will be included in the dikes and embankments 
196     Appendix 3      
to accommodate likely increased flood frequency deriving from climate change over the design 
life of the structures. 
36. 
During preparation of the FRM plan the impacts of projected sea level rise on the coastal 
plain,  estuary  and  dependent  livelihoods  will  be  considered,  and  appropriate  mitigation  or 
adaptation measures formulated. For both Banten Province and the region of Ambon in Maluku 
Province, the locations of the selected river basin territories, studies are proposed to use available 
data on climate change and analyze regional changes in precipitation and flood response to those 
changes. The study findings will be used in the design of structures identified in the development 
of FRM plans.

APPENDIX 6:  COMMUNITY CONTRACTING MECHANISMS 
Community Contracting Mechanisms for Community Based Flood Risk Management 
(Ministry of Home Affairs) 
1.  Community Action Plan (CAP) Development  
1. 
The  process  of the  Project  activities  will  commence  with the  establishment  of  a  long  list  of 
villages with communities showing interest to participate in flood risk management (FRM).59 The long 
list of villages will be confirmed at early stage of the project in line with flood and erosion prone areas. 
The next process will include an awareness campaign, community mobilization, and capacity building 
for the communities. A  Road Show presenting information about the Project and criteria for village 
participation will be organized in each district to inform and register the interested village communities. 
Based on village participation criteria, a short list of participating villages will be established.  
2. 
Supported by Community Facilitators Team (CFT), a given village community will form and 
legalize  a  Community  Group  (KMSB),  which  will  elect  a  representative  committee  comprising  five 
members  to  represent  their  interests.  The  committee  will  include  at  least  one  female  and    one  
member  from  a  minority group,  if  any present  in  the  village.  As  a  legalized  village institution, 
the  Community  Group  (KMSB)  will  open  a  bank  account  to  receive  the  fund  for  project 
implementation.  The  Community  Group  (KMSB)  will  develop  a  Community  Action  Plan  (CAP)  for 
FRM, to be approved by the District Project Management Unit (DPMU). The action plan will include 
development  of  small  check  dams,  land-  slide  protection  works,  drainage  system,  shelters,  early 
warning system, solid waste management land slide mitigation measures and other activities in line 
with  the  flood risk  management  plan (FRMP) developed  for the  district. With  the  help  of  CFT, the 
Community Group (KMSB) will be assisted in planning and designing the priority infrastructures. The 
design of community-selected infrastructure will be in accordance with the detailed guidelines for such 
infrastructure from public works agency. Besides development of physical works and its costs, in the 
CAP,  reservations  will  be  made  for  non-physical  activities  such  as  Community  Group  (KMSB) 
operational  costs  (travel,  tools,  office  materials,  etc.)  and  in-kind  community  contributions  (labor, 
materials, construction site, etc.). 
The   communities   will   be   facilitated   in   developing   and   establishing   operating   and 
3. 
maintenance  mechanisms.  The  Community  Group  (KMSB)  will  be  trained  in  operation  and 
maintenance of the infrastructures, and a user fee mechanism. 
2.  Village Eligibility and Selection Criteria 
4. 
The village participation criteria are described below:  
Village Participation Criteria   
(i) Community commitment through Letter of Intent, confirming: 
(a) no other similar FRM projects ongoing or planned for the village;  
(b) formation of a community implementation team (CIT);  
(c) willingness to prepare a community action plan (CAP);  
(d) willingness to participate and contribute in-kind and/or in-cash a minimum of 20% 
to construction activities 
(e)  willingness  to  conduct  and  finance  required  operation  and  maintenance  on  the 
59  Where structural interventions are not feasible or have limited effects, communities will be engaged in preparation of 
emergency response planning, procedures, and evacuation provisions. 
222     Appendix 6 
system; and  
(f) willingness to conduct behavioral change program.  
(ii) Geographic requisite: villages located in flood prone area 
5. 
Following confirmation of KMSB, villages will prepare a CAP to overcome flood management, 
drainage, solid waste and landslide problems at an appropriate level of technology and reasonable 
budget  level.  The CAP will  be  endorsed  by  all members  of  community’s  5 member  representative 
committee  and  approved  by  the  DPMU.  Selection  of  the  infrastructure  will  be  subject  to  technical 
feasibility,  cost  effectiveness,  financial  feasibility,  and  screening  for  social  and  environmental 
safeguards. A village walk-through demonstrating the nature, location, and impacts on at least 50% 
of  the  village  community  will  be  prepared  and  recorded.  The  CIT  will  prepare  an  operating  and 
maintenance plan, and a user fee mechanism, if needed, to maintain the works.  
3.  Women Participation  
6. 
Proportional representation of women in Community Facilitator Teams should be achieved. 
Women’s active participation in community decision making processes, representation in Community 
Implementation Teams and adequate reflection of women’s interests in the CAPs are mandatory and 
are to be monitored by the Consultant’s team at central level. 
4.  Implementation  
7. 
Once  the  CAP  has  been  approved,  implementation  can  start.  The  first  step  is  signing  of  a 
Community Contract between the District Commitment Officer and the Community Implementation 
Team for a community-selected infrastructure construction. Disbursement of the Social grant to the 
targeted  community  group  should  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF) 
regulations. The mechanism of the disbursement will be detailed in project technical guidelines. At. It 
is  the  Project’s  policy  that  the  final  installment  will  only  be  paid  after  the  community  group  have 
received training in operation and maintenance, and user fee collection, if any. 
8. 
Completion of construction works is to be verified by the District Consultant Engineer and the 
District  Commitment  Officer    and  confirmed  in  the  Report  on  Finalization  of  Works  (Laporan 
Penyelesaian  Pelaksanaan  Pekerjaan,  LP3).  Completion  of  civil  works  will  be  certified  through  a 
Statement of Completion of Works (SP4, Surat Pernyataan Penyelesaian Pelaksanaan Pekerjaan) 
signed by the CIT Chairperson, the District Commitment Officer and the District Consultant.  
5.  Sustainability  
9. 
The definition for sustainability in the context of the Project is that the systems constructed 
through the Project, will keep on operating and may even expand after the Project has closed. This 
means that: (i) O&M are organized and implemented properly by community members; (ii) repairs are 
being done; and (iii) that sufficient funds are available to cover all necessary expenditures to keep on 
running.

attend  meetings  and  follow-ups,  training,  incremental  workload  as  a  result  of  the  land  and  water 
management method adoption, and dissemination of lessons learned. From each farmers group, an 
advanced  farmer  will  be  selected  as  farmer  group  trainer  who  will  receive  training  on  farmland 
management and sustainable agriculture practices to become farmer field facilitator. 
2.  Capacity Building 
12.  The farmer group trainers and local extension workers will be trained in training of trainers to 
become  field  facilitators.  The  Project  will  use  the  services  of  a  Consultant  for  capacity  building  to 
empower community in farmland management and sustainable agriculture practices during project 
implementation.  The Consultant will provide training to the local extension workers and the farmer 
field  facilitators  on  the  job  training  and  facilitation  to  farmers  groups.  The  Consultant,  the  local 
extension workers, and the farmer group facilitators will organize a 5 days training class and 15 times 
field practices in one season. In addition, there will be focus group discussions (FGDs) in order to

Program Implementation and Integrated Flood Risk Management 
1. 
Background.  Indonesia  is  highly  prone  to  flood  hazards  due  to  its  climate  and 
topography.1 Flooding is a growing annual occurrence throughout most of the country imposing 
as much as $430 million per year in economic losses.2 From 2003 to 2013, the country’s average 
annual  flood  impact  included:  (i)  1.58  million  affected  persons;  (ii)  350  casualties  and  13,640 
injured;  (iii)  223,000  homes  fully  or  partially  damaged;  and  (iv)  168,000  hectares  (ha)  of  crops 
inundated.3 The floods sever vital transport arteries and often disrupt access to ports and airports, 
restricting the transfer of goods and services. In 2013, the Ciujung river flooding affected 19,674 
households, displaced 50,527 people, and disrupted the traffic along the Jakarta-Merak toll road 
that  connect  Java  to  Sumatra  island.4  Despite  its  location  in  a  drier  region,  in  2013,  Ambon 
suffered  from  flash  floods  resulting  in  59  destroyed  and  45  damaged  houses,  10  dead  and  5 
missing persons and 7,212 displaced people.5 
2. 
In Government’s  2015-2019  National Medium  Term  Development  Plan  (RPJMN),  water 
security is a central pillar and promotes Flood Risk Management (FRM) to reduce flood damages. 
FRM  embraces  a  range  of  measures  that  address  the  following  three  key  components:  (i) 
managing flood hazard, (ii) minimizing exposure to flood hazard, and (iii) reducing vulnerability of 
people and property exposed. Managing flood hazard involves physical modification of water flow 
such as river infrastructure works, and catchment management measures such as controls over 
forestry and agricultural practices. Managing exposure to floods involves property acquisition, land 
use zoning, building codes, planning development controls, and elevated building. Managing flood 
vulnerability involves non-structural measures such as community awareness, flood forecasting 
and warning, preparedness, emergency response, post-flood early recovery strategies, and flood 
insurance. 
3. 
The Project will support the Government of Indonesia (the Government) and communities 
to  better manage  and mitigate flood  risks.6  The  Project  has  been  designed  as  a  sector  loan to 
support the implementation of the 2015-2019 Strategic Plan for Water Resources (SPWR) of the 
Ministry of Public Works and Housing (MPWH).7 The SPWR includes policy measures and priority 
investments in 63 river basin territories (RBTs) in Indonesia. The Project will finance subprojects 
in (i) two of these RBTs namely the Cidanau-Ciujung-Cidurian (3 Cis) in Banten Province, and (ii) 
Province.

such as Java, Sumatra, Kalimantan or Iran Jaya; and (ii) flash floods, of short duration and high intensity, which occur 
in small and steep mountainous river basins, such as in small islands of Eastern Indonesia.

managing  flood  risks;  (ii)  upgrade  and  develop  flood  protection  infrastructure;  (iii)  improve 
watershed conditions to moderate runoff peaks and soil erosion; and (iv) prepare communities to 
manage  floods.  The  Project  will  promote  effective  flood  risk  management  (FRM)  by  coupling 
infrastructure investment with supporting software measures. It will contribute to achievement of 
the  2015-2019  Government’s  RPJMN  sector  target  to  reduce  the  magnitude  of  economic  and 
social damages due to floods. 
The  Project  will  support  the  implementation  of  an  area  slice  of  the  sector  development

plan, the SPWR.8 The 3 Cis and Ambon-Seram RBTs9 —respectively affected by the two main 
type  of  floods,  the  riverine  and  flash  floods—have  been  selected  to  demonstrate  the  FRM 
approach as part of the operationalization of the 2015–2019 RPJMN. The investment will help the 
Government to accelerate the implementation of the Rencanas in those RBTs. It provides for a 
long-term partnership between the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Government for policy 
dialogue  and  capacity  development,  and  ensures  continuity  in  combining  investments  in 
infrastructure with non-structural components. There is a clear link between this project’s outputs 
and sector targets, and the criteria for the sector modality are met.10  
5. 
The Project builds on lessons from past and ongoing ADB and other development partners’ 
assistance  in  flood  management.  The  Project  design  incorporates  the  key  recommendations 
based on the lessons learned including: (i) intensive consultation with local stakeholders need to 
be  conducted  during  project  preparation  to  ensure  that  the  project  addresses  the  full  range  of 
problems and issues; (ii) the Government should routinely collect and analyze flood damage data; 
(iii)  support  is  needed  for  designing,  developing  sustainable  long-term  flood  management 
concepts;  and  (iv)  watershed  management  programs  should  be  implemented  to  enhance  the 
impact and sustainability of flood control works.11 
6. 
The  lack  of  flood  infrastructure is  also  one  major  reason for  the escalating  damage  by 
floods in the selected river basins in recent years. The impact extends not only to  the damage 
to  the  residential  areas,  but  includes  widespread  damage  and  interruption  of  public  services 
including  transportation,  power  supply,  communication,  etc.  The  overbank  flood  in the  Ciujung 
river in 2013 caused a week long interruption of an important national highway, while  livelihood 
was at a  standstill  for  about  a  month  in  the  entire  region.  In  2013,  massive  physical  damage 
in the residential and commercial areas in Ambon City was caused by flash floods from  adjoining 
five  small  rivers  and  particularly  from  the  Batu  Merah  and  Way  Ruhu  rivers.  Flood  control 
infrastructure is an urgent need to safeguard the social and economic development in all  selected 
RBTs particularly in the areas where rapid urbanization has been taken place. 
8 The 2015 – 2019 SPWR calls for an overall investment of $24.35 billion nationwide including $3.05 billion for flood 
management. 
9  The 3 Cis RBT covers an area of 4,125 km2 and lies mainly within the Banten Province, the most westerly province 
of  Java.  The  Ambon–Seram  RBT  is  located  on  the  islands  of  Ambon  and  Seram,  in  Maluku  Province  in  eastern 
Indonesia with an area of 18,625 km2.  
10  The  required  preconditions  for  the  use  of  the  sector  lending  modality  —  a  sector  development  plan,  institutional 
capacity and appropriate policy to implement the sector development plan  — are all in place.  The MPWH, as the 
executing agency, has the capacity to implement the sector development plan in terms of identification, selection, 
design and implementation of subprojects. The sector development plan has monitorable, verifiable sector indicators 
identified,  including  targets  for  cross  cutting  and  safeguard  concerns.  There  is  a  clear  link  between  this  project’s 
outputs and sector targets.

In the downstream area of the Ciujung river basin, the 11 km river reach downstream of 
7. 
the  Pamarayan  weir  remains  unprotected,  while  the  other  reach  downstream  of  the  highway  is 
protected by dike structures designed for 5 years return period of flood. This has been the main 
cause  of  flooding  in  the  highway  and  surrounding  residential  areas.  In  some  locations,  river 
conveyance  capacity needs to be increased to mitigate the flooding. This can be done through 
river  dredging  and  channel  excavation,  but  also  through  controlling  sources  of  sediment  yields 
from upper catchment. 
In  Ambon,  local  government  is  planning  to  develop  the  city  as  a  water-front  city  with

emphasize  on  allocation,  formation,  sizing,  and  harmonizing  space  (land)  in  a  way  that  helps 
promote  the  economic  growth  including  the  mitigation  of  flood  hazard,  exposure  and 
vulnerability.  Therefore,  all  flood  management  activities  should  be  consistent  with  local 
government plans.

Scope  of  the  Project.  In  the  Project,  there  are  8  components  under  the  four  targeted 
outputs12 with 3 sector agencies namely Ministry of Public Works and Housing (MPWH), Ministry 
of  Agriculture  (MOA)  and  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs  (MOHA)  and  the  State  Ministry  of  National 
Development  Planning/National  Development  Planning  Agency  (Bappenas).  Directorate

and  BWSM).  The  proposed  interventions  in  the  selected  basins  are  development  of  hydro-
meteorological  data  management  system,  development  of  flood  forecast  model,  capacity 
development of relevant agencies and, improvement of the hydrological observation. 
information  and  preparation  of 
flood 
The project will establish flood early warning systems (EWSs) in the 3 Cis and Ambon-Seram 
RBTs, involving stakeholders with designated roles and responsibilities. Both RBOs in Ambon 
- Seram and the 3 Cis will be empowered to implement the measures. In the 3 Cis RBT, the 
localized flood models will be developed to help forecast the flood with considerable lead time 
and enable flood risk mapping. The model will be coupled with river bed/bank erosion model 
and validated through ground observation, historical flood hazard maps and community based 
flood hazard mapping. In Ambon, standalone flash flood forecast and early warning systems 
will  be  installed  considering  local  conditions.  The  forecast  and  early  warning  system  can  be 
developed based on the real-time observation of rainfall depth, intensity and, duration that to 
be communicated with local residents either by radio or cell phone networks.  
With the help of a database and flood model analysis, the potential hazard extent needs to be 
mapped and a risk map to be prepared accordingly. These maps will provide a basis for the 
development of the flood risk management (FRM) plans and the spatial plans for the region. In 
addition to 3Cis and Ambon-Seram RBTs, two other RBTs will be selected and their FRMPs 
will be prepared for future investments. This process would be guided by the RBT coordinating 
council () in each selected RBT with its enhanced capacity. 
12 Project components are (i) enhanced knowledge base for flood risk management, (ii) improved land management 
and upgraded flood infrastructure, (iii) enhanced capacity for community-based flood risk management (CBFRM) and, 
(iv) effective project implementation.

2.C  Detailed  engineering  design  (DED)  [including  Environmental  Impact  Assessment 
(EIA), social safeguards, economic analysis, tender documents and river operation and 
maintenance plans] and Construction Supervision for the 3 Cis RBT and Ambon-Seram 
RBT (DGWR, BBWS 3 Cis and BWSM). Structural subprojects will be identified, prioritized, 
formulated,  appraised,  and  approved  in  accordance  with  technical,  financial,  and  economic 
appraisal criteria, including social and environmental criteria, mutually agreed upon between 
ADB and the government. 
In the downstream area of the Ciujung river basin, the project will construct 11 km earthen dikes 
(core project) on both banks downstream of Pamayaran weir to 25 years return period of peak 
river  discharge  standard.  The  construction  consists  of  spillways,  gated  structures,  bridges, 
culverts  and,  retention  area.  The  list  of  potential  subprojects  has  been  prepared  and  their 
feasibility  study,  readiness  and  implementation  will  be  considered  under  the  project.  The 
existing dike in the remaining river sections, which is designed for 5 years return period will be 
upgraded to 25-year standard after the feasibility study and DED are completed. The DEDs for 
upgrading  work  and  other  structural  interventions  in  the  3  Cis  RBT  including  dikes  in 
Rangkasbitung, river normalization, check dams are included in the project activities scheduled 
in 2017. 
In  Ambon,  the  DED  of  flood  control  measures  will  be  designed  in  consistent  with  the  local 
government’s water front city plan. The list of potential subprojects has been prepared and their 
feasibility  study,  readiness  and  implementation  will  be  considered  under  the  project.  The 
construction of the 4 check dams in Batu Merah as well as in Way Ruhu river basins will be 
given priority.  
The project will assess the feasibility of other structural subprojets in the  3 Cis and Ambon-
Seram RBTs as per procedures set in the project administration manual. 
The design capacities of flood control infrastructure will be based on national standards, robust 
hydrological and hydraulic analyses, and hydrographic and topographical surveys of the project 
area, and will take into account future climate variations.

Background.  Indonesia  is  highly  prone  to  flood  hazards  due  to  its  climate  and 
topography.17 Flooding is a growing annual occurrence throughout most of the country imposing 
as much as $430 million per year in economic losses.18 From 2003 to 2013, the country’s average 
annual  flood  impact  included:  (i)  1.58  million  affected  persons;  (ii)  350  casualties  and  13,640 
injured;  (iii)  223,000  homes  fully  or  partially  damaged;  and  (iv)  168,000  hectares  (ha)  of  crops 
inundated.19 The floods sever vital transport arteries and often disrupt access to ports and airports, 
restricting the transfer of goods and services. In 2013, the Ciujung river flooding affected 19,674 
households, displaced 50,527 people, and disrupted the traffic along the Jakarta-Merak toll road 
that  connect  Java  to  Sumatra  island.20  Despite  its  location  in  a  drier  region,  in  2013,  Ambon 
suffered  from  flash  floods  resulting  in  59  destroyed  and  45  damaged  houses,  10  dead  and  5 
missing persons and 7,212 displaced people.21 
52. 
In Government’s  2015-2019  National Medium  Term  Development  Plan  (RPJMN),  water 
security is a central pillar and promotes Flood Management Risk (FRM) to reduce flood damages. 
FRM  embraces  a  range  of  measures  that  address  the  following  three  key  components:  (i) 
managing flood hazard, (ii) minimizing exposure to flood hazard, and (iii) reducing vulnerability of 
people and property exposed. Managing flood hazard involves physical modification of water flow 
such as river infrastructure works, and catchment management measures such as controls over 
forestry and agricultural practices. Managing exposure to floods involves property acquisition, land 
use zoning, building codes, planning development controls, and elevated building. Managing flood 
vulnerability involves non-structural measures such as community awareness, flood forecasting 
and warning, preparedness, emergency response, post-flood early recovery strategies, and flood 
insurance. 
53. 
The Project will support the Government of Indonesia (the Government) and communities 
to better manage and mitigate flood risks.22 The Project has been designed as a sector loan to 
support the implementation of the 2015-2019 Strategic Plan for Water Resources (SPWR) of the 
17  Indonesia is prone to two main type of flooding: (i) long-lasting riverine floods in large river basins having steep slopes 
in upper part and long, flat and low floodplains (often influenced by tides) - these are characteristic of the large islands 
such as Java, Sumatra, Kalimantan or Iran Jaya; and (ii) flash floods, of short duration and high intensity, which occur 
in small and steep mountainous river basins, such as in small islands of Eastern Indonesia.

enhance hydro meteorological data and analysis, management and institutional coordination for 
managing  flood  risks;  (ii)  upgrade  and  develop  flood  protection  infrastructure;  (iii)  improve 
watershed conditions to moderate runoff peaks and soil erosion; and (iv) prepare communities to 
manage  floods.  The  Project  will  promote  effective  flood  risk  management  (FRM)  by  coupling 
infrastructure investment with supporting software measures. It will contribute to achievement of 
the  2015-2019  Government’s  RPJMN  sector  target  to  reduce  the  magnitude  of  economic  and

plan, the SPWR.24 The 3 Cis and Ambon-Seram RBTs25 —respectively affected by the two main 
type  of  floods,  the  riverine  and  flash  floods—have  been  selected  to  demonstrate  the  FRM 
approach as part of the operationalization of the 2015–2019 RPJMN. The investment will help the 
Government to accelerate the implementation of the Rencanas in those RBTs. It provides for a 
long-term partnership between the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Government for policy 
dialogue  and  capacity  development,  and  ensures  continuity  in  combining  investments  in 
infrastructure with non-structural components. There is a clear link between this project’s outputs 
and sector targets, and the criteria for the sector modality are met.26  
55. 
The Project builds on lessons from past and ongoing ADB and other development partners’ 
assistance  in  flood  management.  The  Project  design  incorporates  the  key  recommendations 
based on the lessons learned including: (i) intensive consultation with local stakeholders need to 
be  conducted  during  project  preparation  to  ensure  that  the  project  addresses  the  full  range  of 
problems and issues; (ii) the Government should routinely collect and analyze flood damage data; 
(iii)  support  is  needed  for  designing,  developing  sustainable  long-term  flood  management 
concepts;  and  (iv)  watershed  management  programs  should  be  implemented  to  enhance  the 
impact and sustainability of flood control works.27 
56. 
The  lack  of  flood  infrastructure is  also  one  major  reason for  the escalating  damage  by 
floods in the selected river basins in recent years. The impact extends not only to  the damage 
to  the  residential  areas,  but  includes  widespread  damage  and  interruption  of  public  services 
including  transportation,  power  supply,  communication,  etc.  The  overbank  flood  in the  Ciujung 
river in 2013 caused a week long interruption of an important national highway, while  livelihood 
was at a  standstill  for  about  a  month  in  the  entire  region.  In  2013,  massive  physical  damage

2019. The plan calls for a reduction by 200,000 ha of the flooded area nationwide by 2019. 
24 The 2015 – 2019 SPWR calls for an overall investment of  $24.35 billion nationwide including $3.05 billion for flood 
management. 
25 The 3 Cis RBT covers an area of 4,125 km2 and lies mainly within the Banten Province, the most westerly province 
of  Java.  The  Ambon–Seram  RBT  is  located  on  the  islands  of  Ambon  and  Seram,  in  Maluku  Province  in  eastern 
Indonesia with an area of 18,625 km2.  
26  The  required  preconditions  for  the  use  of  the  sector  lending  modality  —  a  sector  development  plan,  institutional 
capacity and appropriate policy to implement the sector development plan  — are all in place.  The MPWH, as the 
executing agency, has the capacity to implement the sector development plan in terms of identification, selection, 
design and implementation of subprojects. The sector development plan has monitorable, verifiable sector indicators 
identified,  including  targets  for  cross  cutting  and  safeguard  concerns.  There  is  a  clear  link  between  this  project’s 
outputs and sector targets.

in the residential and commercial areas in Ambon City was caused by flash floods from  adjoining 
five  small  rivers  and  particularly  from  the  Batu  Merah  and  Way  Ruhu  rivers.  Flood  control 
infrastructure is an urgent need to safeguard the social and economic development in all  selected 
RBTs particularly in the areas where rapid urbanization has been taken place. 
57. 
In the downstream area of the Ciujung river basin, the 11 km river reach downstream of 
the  Pamarayan  weir  remains  unprotected,  while  the  other  reach  downstream  of  the  highway  is 
protected by dike structures designed for 5 years return period of flood. This has been the main 
cause  of  flooding  in  the  highway  and  surrounding  residential  areas.  In  some  locations,  river 
conveyance  capacity needs to be increased to mitigate the flooding. This can be done through 
river  dredging  and  channel  excavation,  but  also  through  controlling  sources  of  sediment  yields 
from upper catchment. 
58. 
In  Ambon,  local  government  is  planning  to  develop  the  city  as  a  water-front  city  with 
emphasize  on  allocation,  formation,  sizing,  and  harmonizing  space  (land)  in  a  way  that  helps 
promote  the  economic  growth  including  the  mitigation  of  flood  hazard,  exposure  and 
vulnerability.  Therefore,  all  flood  management  activities  should  be  consistent  with  local 
government plans. 
59. 
Scope  of  the  Project.  In  the  Project,  there  are  8  components  under  the  four  targeted 
outputs28 with 3 sector agencies namely Ministry of Public Works and Housing (MPWH), Ministry 
of  Agriculture  (MOA)  and  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs  (MOHA)  and  the  State  Ministry  of  National 
Development  Planning/National  Development  Planning  Agency  (Bappenas).  Directorate 
General  of Water Resources ( DGWR)  packages  cover four components.  
60.  Scope of the Works for Package 2. Key activities of the Package 2 cover Output 4.A as 
follows: 
4. A Project Management (DGWR-MPWH). DGWR will be an implementing agency for the 
aforementioned activities and also lead the overall project implementation in the capacity of the 
project  executing  agency.  A  mechanism  will  be  developed  and  applied  to  ensure  that  the 
approved recommendations of the project are well implemented, along with effective monitoring 
and  reporting  mechanisms,  so  that  government  and  ADB  can  ensure  that  funds  are  being 
disbursed  in  accordance  with  the  plans  and  in  a  timely  manner,  and  so  information  is 
exchanged  among  the  component  projects  to  improve  overall  performance,  and  minimize 
wasted effort caused by overlaps. This provision will also help facilitate CPMU and accelerate 
the project performance at all levels. 
61. The indicative project plans initially approved may be modified to some extent in the light 
of changing circumstances and needs. Also, the project stakeholders are many and 
varied, from both the public and private sectors, and there is an emphasis on community-
driven activities. Therefore meaningful liaison with these stakeholders and willingness to 
adapt to their advice and expectations will be essential for Project success. 
28 Project components are (i) enhanced knowledge base for flood risk management, (ii) improved land management 
and upgraded flood infrastructure, (iii) enhanced capacity for community-based flood risk management (CBFRM) and, 
(iv) effective project implementation.

I. 
Background 
80. 
.  The  proposed  Flood  Management  in  Selected  River  Basins  Project  (the  Project)  will 
support the Government of Indonesia (GoI) and communities to better manage and mitigate flood 
risks.  The  Project  aims  to  shift  from  project-oriented  flood  control  centered  around  structural 
measures, to process-oriented integrated flood management (IFM) that provides a well-balanced 
mix  of  non-structural  interventions,  institutional  and  capacity  building,  and  structural  works  to 
mitigate the negative impacts of floods. It is proposed that the Project be financed by the Asian 
Development  Bank  (ADB)  through  a  sector  loan  with  a  period  of  six  years.  The  government 
designed the Ciujung (Banten Province) and Batu Merah and Way Ruhu (Ambon City, Maluku 
Province)  as  priority  river  basins.  These  basins  were  selected  as  they  represent  a  range  of 
different  flooding  regimes  common  throughout Indonesia.  They  address the multiple  and  inter-
related concerns of flood and watershed management in the river basins. Inadequate institutional 
arrangements, deteriorating infrastructure, competing water and land resource, and rapid urban 
and industrial growth have led to flood risk and unhealthy environmental conditions throughout 
the basin. 
81. 
The  overall  Project  has  four  components.  Project  Component  2  is  "Adapted  basin 
management, increased discharge capacity and reduced peak flow". Within Project Component 
2, (i) sub-component 1 - watershed management – is to be implemented by BANGDA / Ministry 
of  Home  Affairs  in  both  Ambon  and  in  Ciujung,  and  by  Ministry  of  Agriculture  working  only  in 
Ciujung; and (ii) sub-component 2 focuses on major structural / civil methods of flood control, to 
be implemented by the Major/National River Basin Organization (Balai Besar Wilayah Sungai) of 
Cidanau-Ciujung-Cidurian  rivers  (hereinafter  BBWS  3Cis),  and  the  Provincial  River  Basin 
Organization (Balai Wilayah Sungai or BWS) of Maluku river. One core priority subproject has 
been identified under sub-component 2: construction of a 11 km dike in Ciujung river. Other major 
structural  /  civil  flood  control  sub-projects  under  this  sector  Project  will  be  identified  and  fully 
investigated  during  implementation,  following  the  procedures  established  in  the  environmental 
assessment and review framework (EARF – linked document LD10).   
II. 
Required Safeguards Monitoring Entities (SMEs) and its Services   
In addition to the internal monitoring, the Project Administration Manual (PAM) requires 
82. 
independent  monitoring  on  the  safeguards  to  ensure  that  all  recommendations  and  mitigation 
measures under the IEEs and the AMDAL (environmental impact assessment in the Indonesian 
system)  of  the  core  subproject,  as  well  as  the  AMDAL  of  all  future  subprojects  are  being 
implemented. 
83. 
One SME will be required in each of the two Project provinces, Banten and Maluku. The 
required  SME  will  be  recruited  by  the  relevant  PIU  following  ADB  Consultants’  Qualifications 
Selection (CQS) procedure. Interested entities such as local NGOs, or domestic universities and 
institutions must provide amplified Expressions of Interest (EOI) which includes the information 
showing that they are qualified to perform the services, giving the entity general experience for 
similar assignments and CVs of Key personnel with academic background, experience in similar 
assignments, knowledge of local conditions, etc. The completed EOI form can be found in CSRN 
of the ABD website. CVs must be submitted using the format in Attachment-1. 
276    Appendix 7 
III. 
Overall Schedule of Safeguards Monitoring 
Independent  environmental  monitoring  will  be  undertaken  during 
84. 
the  project 
implementation period from 2016 to 2022. The SME will provide the services for all the subprojects 
within the province under the sector loan. Procedures for environmental safeguards in the sector 
loan can be found in the Environmental Assessment and Review Framework (Linked document 
10). For the core subproject that has been identified, the environmental monitoring will follow the 
Environmental Management and Monitoring Plans (EMPs) that have been prepared and included 
in the Initial Environmental Examinations (IEEs  – Linked document 11) and the Environmental 
Impact  Assessment  (AMDAL).  For  future  subprojects  for  which  an  AMDAL  is  required, 
environmental  monitoring  will  be  undertaken  following  the  EMP  under  the  AMDAL.  List  of 
candidate structural subprojects under the Project can be found in the following Table.

floods  have  become  annual 
phenomena in the 3 Cis river basin territory (RBT), which usually occur between November and 
January every year.  The flood risk  condition in the basin is worsening due to both natural and 
human  induced  factors.  One  of  the  most  serious  aspects  is  degrading  watershed  associated 
with poor farm management and deforestation. This has increased sediment yield and of runoff 
volumes  and  peaks  during  intense  rainfall  events.  Sediment  deposition  in  the  main  river 
channels  downstream  has  reduced  the  conveyance  capacity  of  the  rivers,  increased  channel 
instability and bank erosion, and generally increased flood hazard. 
94. 
In  order  to  mitigate  the  flood  risk,  proactive  measures  are  necessary,  which  have  not 
been  given  much  priority  to  date  in  regional  development  planning.  Ideally  non-structural 
measures  particularly  watershed  management  from  the  view  point  of  sustainable  faming  and 
irrigation  practices  as  well  as  afforestation  should  be  done  as  a  part  of  integrated  flood  risk 
management. 
95.  Watershed  management,  particularly  soil  and  water  conservation  activities, 
if 
implemented  in  proper  coordination  among  different  sectors/  line  agencies  with  better 
understanding of upstream-downstream consequences, will significantly reduce soil erosion and 
mitigate  floods  downstream.  At  the  same  time,  if  implemented  appropriately  the  activities  can 
enhance the livelihoods of farmers through different income generation opportunities and  various 
agro-forestry related enterprises. 
Objectives. The general objective of  this component  is to develop critical lands in the 
96. 
upper Ciujung river basin to control erosion through better land management, to reduce runoff 
through water conservation and enhance the income of the farmers by involving and benefiting 
them  from  the  watershed  management/agro-forestry  initiatives.108 The  specific  objectives  are 
to  (i)  develop  the  critical  land  by  terracing,  improved  farming  practices,  plantation  of  multi-
purpose  trees  on  upper  slopes,  better  hill  irrigation,  forming  vegetated  waterways  and  other 
soil  and  water conservation measures, and (ii) improve the livelihoods of farmers by increasing 
incomes  through better land and water conservation practices 
97. 
Scope  of  Works.  Poor  agricultural  practices  and  the  large  and  increasing  amount  of 
critical  land  are  a major cause  of  the  increased runoff  in  the  Ciujung  river  basin,  and  are  yet 
to  be  improved  in  such  a  way  that  agricultural/livelihood  benefits  are  maximized,  while 
reducing  soil  erosion  and  runoff.  Under  this  component,  Directorate  of  Land  Conservation  of 
MOA  will  implement the agro-forestry in [10 ha x (70 groups in Serang + 225 groups in Lebak 
+ 150 groups  in  Pandeglang)]  hectares  of  land  in  three  Districts.  Terracing  practices  under 
the  scope  of  land  optimization that helps reduce the peak flow and help conserve the water 
and  nutrients  increase  the  productivity,  will  be  promoted  in  the  same  districts  [10  ha  x  (15 
groups in Serang + 105 groups in  Lebak + 50 groups  in  Pandeglang)].  As  a  part  of  livelihood 
support  and  support  to  the  conservation  activities,  farmers  in  targeted  areas  will  also  be 
provided with agro-machinery and  other farm toolkits. MOA through the Directorate General of 
Agricultural Infrastructure and Facility (DGAIF) will be responsible for the implementation of the 
sustainable  agriculture  practices  in  the  3  Cis  RBT  in  cooperation  with  provincial  and  district 
agriculture  agencies.  A  CPIU  will  be  established  in  DGAIF,    while  Provincial    Project 
108 Based  on Ministry  of Agriculture  guidelines:  (i) 2009,  Pedoman Teknis  Konservasi  Das Hulu, (ii) 2009,  Pedoman

Implementation Unit (PPIU) and District Project Implementation Unit (DPIU) will respectively be 
established in the provincial and district agriculture agencies.  CPIU,  PPIU and the DPIUs will 
promote  other  livelihood  options  to  the  farmers  that  include  provision  for  cattle  (source  of 
organic fertilizer), seeds and seedlings of a variety of crops, etc. In addition, the Directorate of 
Water  and  Irrigation  under  MOA  will  support  the  aforementioned  activities by  constructing 
small  water storage  ponds  in  the  farms  to  be  complemented  by  drainage  and  irrigation 
systems  improvement.  The  baseline  survey  data  (covering  land  use  condition,  erosion, 
social  and  economic  conditions  of  the  farmers)  will  centralized  in  the  GIS  based  monitoring 
system.  A  socio  economic  analysis  will  be  prepared  to  evaluate  livelihood  impact and long 
term sustainability of the activities. 
98. 
Key activities will be as follows: 
(i) 
Selection and strengthening of targeted farmers groups based on agreed selection 
criteria (technical, social and economic); 
(ii)  Conversion of critical land 4,450 ha (10 ha x 445 groups) hectares implemented by 
445  farmer  groups  in  3  districts.  Included  in  the  Land  Conservation  activities  are 
Development  of  Terraces,  and  or  land  conservation  buildings,  for  example  small 
waterfall, gabions, or a combination with vegetative. 
(iii)  Land optimization in 1,700 ha [(15 x 10) + (105 x 10) + (50 x 10)] hectares will be 
implemented by 68 farmers groups in Serang, Lebak and Padeglang districts; 
(iv)  1,045,500 [4,250 x (445 + 170)] number of multi-purpose trees planted in the selected 
critical lands; 
(v)  36 micro check dams, 20 infiltration tanks, 21 small water collection ponds built  and 
4,080 ha  of  land irrigated through community participations. Starting in 2020 there 
are  additional  activities  for  Participatory  construction,  namely  Farm  Roads.  This 
activity was previously part of Land Optiomization. 
(vi)  15  income  generating  and  agro-forestry  related  training  courses  conducted  for 
communities; and 
(vii)  Effective operation and maintenance/ rehabilitation.

III.  MOHA  Package:  Institutional  Development  for  Community- Based  Flood 
Risk Management 
floods  have  become  annual 
110.  Background.  Landslides, 
phenomena  in  3  Cis  and  Ambon-Seram  river  basin  territories  (RBTs),  which  usually  occur 
between November and January in 3 Cis RBT and May and August in Ambon every year. The 
flood  risk  condition  in  the  river  basins  is  worsening  due  to  both  natural  and  human  induced 
factors. 
riverbank  erosion  and 
111. 
In  order  to  mitigate  the  flood  risk,  proactive  measures  are  necessary,  which  has  not 
been  given  much  priority  to  date  in  regional  development  planning.  Diagnostic  assessment  of 
the legal, institutional and policy framework identified needs for greater awareness of flood risk 
(and  elements  of  flood  risk:  hazard,  exposure  and  vulnerability)  in  government  organizations, 
and  greater  focus  on  flood  management  as  a  core  responsibility  in  the  Directorate  General  of 
Water Resources (DGWR) under the Ministry of Public Works and Housing, within the disaster 
management agency (BNPB) and in  local government agencies with more recognition of flood 
management planning at river-basin scale. Institutional and governance reforms are necessary 
together with capacity building of agencies to initiate and implement effective flood management 
measures. Formal coordination mechanisms are required to transform recognition of the needs 
into  practical  coordination  between  government  organizations.  There  is  also  great  need  for 
building technical and administrative capacity in all government stakeholder institutions, and for 
provision of adequate and sustained funding. 
112.  Despite  the  efforts  made  by  local  governments  to  improve  the  situation,  flood  losses 
continue worsening each year. This is particularly because there is a lack of local communities’ 
awareness  and  ownership  in  the  development  and  management  process,  while  the  risk  is 
increasing  both  on  spatial  and  temporal  scales.  The  capacity  of  local  communities  in  all  flood 
prone areas is yet to be mobilized so that they can prepare better in normal times and respond 
better  in  the  case  of  emergency.  Both  mutual  support  and  self-support  conditions  need  to  be 
improved. Community mobilization and community based approach of flood risk management is 
essential in all flood prone communities in the basin. In addition, the effort given by central and 
local  government  alone  to  mitigate  the  risk  will  not  be  sufficient  as  the  risk  is  dynamic  and 
changes markedly in time and space throughout the river basins. Community engagement and 
participation in FRM activities is very important. 
113.  Objective: This consulting services package will support the following components: 
1.B: 
Institutional  strengthening,  planning  and  coordination 
(i) 
for 
implementation  of  FRM plans in the 3 Cis and Ambon-Seram RBTs. The general 
objective  of  this  sub-component  is  to  develop  the  institutional  capacity  of  local 
government  to  initiate,  plan,  design  and  implement  flood  risk  management  (FRM) 
plans 
in  the  river  basins.  The  specific  objectives  are  (i)  strengthening  of  local 
government  officers  capacity  to  address  FRM,  (ii)  development  of  FRM  knowledge 
and  introduction  of  replicable  best  practices, (iii)  formulation  of  district  FRM  plans  for 
the  basins  with  balanced  structural  and  non-  structural  measures,  (iv)  integration  of 
FRM  plans  in  regional  development  and  spatial  land  use  plans,  (v)  development  of 
river  corridor  management  and  building  code  with  proper regulation, monitoring  and 
evaluation mechanisms and, (vi) coordination of  central,  provincial  and  district  level 
authorities  for  implementation  of  integrated  FRM  measures.

(ii) 
2.B  Improved  runoff  and  erosion  control  in  3Cis  RBT  and  Ambon-Seram 
RBT. The  general  objective  of  this  component  is  to  improve  conditions  of  the  critical 
land in upper  river basins to control soil erosion through better land management and 
to reduce runoff  through  rainfall  runoff  interception.  The  specific  objectives  are  to  (i) 
stabilize the exiting  landslides by structural and bio-engineering works, (ii) identify and 
control  the  possible  occurrence  of  landslide  in  highly  landslide  prone  areas,  (iii) 
install  rainfall  harvesting  facilities  at  individual  household  level,  (iv)  construct  small 
ponds to serve dual purposes  of on-farm water supply and/or household consumption, 
(iv)  regulate  the  land-use  by  rules  and  regulations  endorsed  and  supervised  by  the 
local  government,  (v) 
livelihoods  of  farmers  by  providing  skills  and 
experience of  controlling  natural  hazard,  rainfall harvesting technologies and their end 
uses, and  (vi) promote community  participation and joint action for the sustainability of 
the adopted systems.

(iii) 
3.A  Enhanced  capacity  for  community-based  flood  risk  management  in 
the  3  Cis  and  Ambon-Seram  RBTs.  There  is  a  need  to  mobilize  communities  by 
organizing  each  community  to  enable  them  to  build  effective  mutual  and  self-help 
capacity.  Communities  will  be  organized  in  teams;  they  will  develop  their  capacity 
in  different  stages of FRM and at the same time work to alleviate poverty, which has 
much  to  do  with  the  vulnerability  to  flood  risk.  Communities  will  be  an  active  part 
in  flood  early  warning  systems  as  well.  CBFRM  activities  are  proposed  to  achieve 
these  goals.  The  specific  objectives  are  to  (i)  conduct  awareness  campaigns,  (ii) 
develop  community  organizations,  (iii)  develop communities’ capacity and implement 
(v)  expose 
community  based  FRM  activities, 
communities 
to  best  practices  and  support  their  active  participation  and  (vi) 
encourage  communities  to  initiate  their  own  activities to mitigate their risk by various 
means. 
(iv)  promote  gender  equity, 
114.  Scope of Works. Key activities will be as follows: 
1.B:

approaches  to  achieve 
government  officials,  specialized 
to  support 
introduction  of  new  technology  or  new  procedures, and knowledge sharing on flood 
management. These  activities  will  be  supported  by  the  use  of  flood  risk  mapping  for 
both planning and emergency response.  Coordination committees for FRM planning and 
response should be created at provincial  and district levels and to support mainstreaming 
of FRM in relevant development  sectors. Key activities will be as follows:

Community-Based Flood Risk Management (CBFRM) (MOHA) 
127.  Background. The recurring flood hazards in 3 Cis and Maluku RBTs have had a negative 
impact  on  the  population  affecting  the  most  vulnerable:  children,  women,  elderly,  people 
with  disabilities  and  the  livelihoods  of  the  low  income  population.  While  the  downstream 
communities  suffer  from  the  losses,  the  upstream  communities  have  had  share  to  reduce  the 
flood  magnitude  in  the  downstream  areas  in  the  river  basin.  Therefore  empowerment  of  the 
community and their preparedness against flood disaster in the entire river basin will collectively 
minimize the flood damage. 
128.  The  Project  will  implement  the  community  based  flood  risk  management  activities 
including  end-to-end  flood  early  warning  system  in  3 Cis  and  Ambon  Seram  RBTs.  Where 
structural interventions are not feasible or have limited effects, communities will be engaged in 
preparing  emergency response  planning,  procedures,  and  evacuation  plans.  This  will  be  done 
through 
intensive  community  mobilization  (awareness,  organization,  skill  and  capacity, 
technological  interventions,  gender  equity  and  cultural  norms),  and  by  providing  technical 
guidance to the communities. Interested entities such as local NGOs, or similar institutions must 
provide amplified Expressions of Interest (EOI) which includes the information showing that they 
are  qualified  to  perform  the  services,  giving  the  entity  general  experience  for  similar 
assignments  and  CVs  of  Key  personnel  with  academic  background,  experience  in  similar 
assignments, knowledge of local conditions, etc. 
129.  Overall  Schedule  of  Community  based  Flood  Risk  Management.  CBFRM  will  be 
undertaken during the project implementation period from 2015 to 2021. 
130.  Scope of Works. The CBFRM Entity (CBFRME) will focus on the awareness campaign, 
community mobilization, facilitation of community driven activities, and establishment of end-end 
flood early warning system in target communities.  Key responsibilities of the SME include: 
(i)  A baseline survey; 
(ii)  Community  mobilization  activities  under 
the  seven  basic  principles 
(Organization,  Capital, Knowledge and skill, Technology, DRR activities, Gender 
inclusion,  and Social  and cultural harmony); 
(iii) Organize training programs; and 
(iv) Facilitate  in  community  development  works.  The  community  mobilization  will 
be  conducted  based  on  the  7  basic  principles  i.e.  organization  development, 
capital  formation,  knowledge  and  skill  development,  gender  equity,  DRR, 
technology  transfer  and cultural harmony. 
131.  Deliverables. Key expected outputs and deliverables are as follows: 
Appendix 7     311 
(i)  A  CBFRM  plan  responding  to  the  scope  of  works  outlined  in  these  terms  of

BAPPENAS (NSCWR) Package: Independent Monitoring and Evaluation (IME) 
137.  Background.  The  Project  will  support  the  Government  of  Indonesia  (the  government) 
and communities to better manage and mitigate the flood risks in the Cidanau-Ciujung-Cidurian 
(3 Cis) and Ambon–Seram river basin territories (RBTs). The Project aims to shift from project-
oriented  flood  control  centered  around  structural  measures,  to  process-oriented  FRM  that 
provides a well-balanced mix of non-structural interventions, institutional and capacity building, 
and structural works to mitigate the negative impacts of floods.

INTRODUCTION 
1. 
As  part  of  Project  Administration  Manual  (PAM)  and  Memorandum  of  Understanding 
(MOU) between Government of Indonesia and Asian Development Bank (ADB) related to Flood 
Management in Selected River Basin Sector (FMSRB) Project (the Project), the Government of 
Indonesia  (the  Government)  is  obliged  to  apply  environmental  safeguards  in  the  project 
implementation in accordance with ADB’s and the Government’s policy and regulations. In line 
with the agreement, the environmental safeguards have been stipulated in PAM and reflected in 
the Environmental Assessment and Review Framework (EARF) of the Project. In that respect, 
application  of  environmental  safeguard  policy  is  inherent  in  the  planning,  design  and 
implementation of the FMSRB from the beginning. 
2. 
This  technical  guideline  on  environmental  safeguards  namely  standard  operating 
procedure  (SOP)  on  Environmental  Safeguards  is  prepared  as  guidance  for  contractors  and 
stakeholders  in  implementing  measures  to  avoid,  minimize,  and/or  mitigate  the  negative 
environmental  impacts  of the  project  activities,  from the  planning  to  implementation  as  well  as 
post implementation (operation and maintenance) stages. Some of the technical guidelines on 
environmental safeguards were already discussed and provided in the EARF. Similar framework 
for social safeguards is separately prepared.  
3. 
It  is  expected  that  all  preventive  and  mitigating  measures  will  be  taken  in  design  and 
implementation  of  the  project  to  ensure  the  environmental  soundness  and  sustainability  of 
projects and to support the integration of environmental considerations into the project decision-
making process. 
A. 
Understanding the Safeguard Issues 
In  this  SOP,  safeguards  is  interpreted  as  environmental  “protection  measures”.  The 
4. 
protection measures cover prevention and mitigation techniques and tools as well as the solutions 
of any anticipated problems resulting from adverse negative impacts of the project. The SOP is 
to ensure that the safeguard measures are carried out systematically and integrated during the 
planning,  implementation  and  operation  and  maintenance.  In  this  context,  the  goal  of  the 
safeguards  is  to  promote  the  sustainability  of  project  outcomes  by  protecting  people  and  the 
environment from potential adverse impact of the project and by enhancing the benefits from the 
project. 
5. 
In transforming the safeguard commitment, ADB and its borrowers/clients take shared but 
differentiated  responsibilities  and  actions.  As  stipulated  in  EARF,  ADB  has  responsibility  for 
explaining  policy  requirements  to  borrowers/clients,  and  helping  borrowers/clients  meet  these 
requirements  during  project  processing  and  implementation  through  due  diligence,  review, 
supervision,  and  capacity-building  programs.  Borrowers/clients  are  required  to  undertake 
environmental  assessments,  engage  affected  people  and  communities  through  information 
the 
disclosure  and  consultations,  prepare  and 
implementation of these plans, and prepare and submit monitoring reports. This SOP is mainly 
prepared to support the borrowers/clients to meet the requirements.  
implement  safeguard  plans,  monitor

Compatability and Review 
6. 
The  Indonesia  AMDAL  system  generally  conforms  in  intent  to  ADB’s  environmental 
management guidelines. There is corresponding relationship between the ADB and Indonesia’s 
regulations/policies.  
7. 
The full AMDAL or UKL/UPL reports—depending on categorization—will be prepared and 
finalized in consultation with ADB. The Government approved environmental documents (AMDAL 
or UKL/UPL) which have incorporated ADB’s comments to ensure that the AMDAL or UKL/UPL 
meet  ADB  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (SPS)  2009  requirements  is  the  only  documentation 
required to process the potential sub-projects. To ensure compliance of the document with ADB 
SPS 2009, periodical support1 will be provided by the Environmental Safeguard Specialist, who 
will be employed under the project implementation team. 
C. 
Objective 
This  SOP  does  not  seek  to  be  definitive  and  exhaustive  reference;  rather  it  helps 
8. 
implement the environmental safeguard measures for FMSRB. Reference materials published by 
multilateral development banks such as ADB, World Bank Group, and others can provide useful 
information on environmental assessment and safeguards in general.  
In  general,  the  SOP  is  aimed  to  guide  the  implementation  of  safeguard  measures  for 
9. 
FMSRB project and mainly helps: 
(i) 
(ii) 
Minimize adverse environmental impacts resulting from the implementation 
and operation and maintenance of the subprojects under FMSRB; 
Ensure that proposed subprojects do not interfere protected areas (negative 
list) as attached in Appendix 6; 
(iii)  Mitigate the negative environmental impacts through safeguard procedure;  
(iv)  Monitor the process of environmental safeguard implementation; and 
(v) 
Ensure compliance with ADB 2009. 
D. 
Users 
10. 
In  particular,  the  SOP  of  environmental  safeguards  is  aimed  at  supporting  consultants, 
contractors and stakeholders to implement the safeguard measures under FMSRB.  Therefore, 
the  SOP  is  intended  to  be  used  by  Central  Project  Management  Unit  (CPMU),  project 
implementation units (PIUs) and parties engaged by CPMU/PIUs (Consultants and Contractors) 
involved in planning, implementation and maintaining of FMSRB project. 
II.  GENERAL CONDITIONS 
A. 
Basic Principles of Environmental Safeguard 
Referring to  ADB  2009, the  basic  principles  to  be  applied  in  this  project shall  meet  the 
11. 
safeguard requirements as elaborated below: 
1 National Environmental Safeguard Specialist will review and report periodically to ADB on compliance of SPS 2009, 
including requirement for updating of categorization, EMP and RKL/RPL as applicable 
324     Appendix 8 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
(v) 
(vi) 
(vii) 
Use a screening process for each proposed project, as early as possible, to 
determine the appropriate extent and type of environmental assessment so 
that  appropriate  studies  are  undertaken  commensurate  with 
the 
significance of potential impacts and risks. 
Conduct  an  environmental  assessment  for  each  proposed  subproject  to 
identify potential direct, indirect, cumulative, and induced impacts and risks 
to  physical,  biological,  socioeconomic  (including  impacts  on  livelihood 
through  environmental  media,  health  and  safety,  vulnerable  groups,  and 
gender  issues),  and  physical  cultural  resources  in  the  context  of  the 
project’s  area  of  influence.  Assess  potential  trans-boundary  and  global 
including  climate  change.  Use  strategic  environmental 
impacts, 
assessment where appropriate. 
Examine  alternatives  to  the  project’s  location,  design,  technology,  and 
components  and  their  potential  environmental  and  social  impacts  and 
document  the  rationale  for  selecting  the  particular  alternative  proposed. 
Also consider the no project alternative. 
Avoid,  and  where  avoidance  is  not  possible,  minimize,  mitigate,  and/or 
offset  adverse  impacts  and  enhance  positive  impacts  by  means  of 
environmental  planning  and  management.  Prepare  an  environmental 
management plan (EMP) that includes the proposed mitigation measures, 
environmental monitoring  and  reporting  requirements,  related  institutional 
training 
or  organizational  arrangements,  capacity  development  and 
measures,  implementation  schedule,  cost  estimates,  and  performance 
indicators.  Key  considerations  for  EMP  preparation  include  mitigation  of 
potential adverse impacts to the level of no significant harm to third parties, 
and the polluter pays principle. 
Carry out meaningful consultation with affected people and facilitate their 
informed  participation.  Ensure  women’s  participation  in  consultation. 
including  affected  people  and  concerned 
Involve  stakeholders, 
nongovernment organizations, early in the project preparation process and 
ensure that their views and concerns are made known to and understood 
by  decision  makers  and  taken  into  account.  Continue  consultations  with 
stakeholders  throughout  project  implementation  as  necessary  to  address 
issues related to environmental assessment. Establish a grievance redress 
mechanism  to  receive  and  facilitate  resolution  of  the  affected  people’s 
the  project’s  environmental 
regarding 
concerns  and  grievances 
performance. 
Disclose a draft environmental assessment (including the EMP) in a timely 
manner, before project appraisal, in an accessible place and in a form and 
language(s)  understandable  to  affected  people  and  other  stakeholders. 
Disclose  the  final  environmental  assessment,  and  its  updates  if  any,  to 
affected people and other stakeholders. 
Implement  the  EMP  and  monitor  its  effectiveness.  Document  monitoring 
results,  including  the  development  and  implementation  of  corrective 
actions, and disclose monitoring reports. 
Appendix 8      325 
(ix) 
(viii)  Do  not  implement  project  activities  in  areas  of  critical  habitats,  unless  (i) 
there are no measurable adverse impacts on the critical habitat that could 
impair its ability to function, (ii) there is no reduction in the population of any 
recognized endangered or critically endangered species, and (iii) any lesser 
impacts are mitigated. If a project is located within a legally protected area, 
implement additional programs to promote and enhance the conservation 
aims of the protected area. In an area of natural habitats, there must be no 
significant  conversion  or  degradation,  unless  (i)  alternatives  are  not 
available, (ii) the overall benefits from the project substantially outweigh the 
environmental costs, and (iii) any conversion or degradation is appropriately 
mitigated.  Use  a  precautionary  approach  to  the  use,  development,  and 
management of renewable natural resources. 
Apply  pollution  prevention  and  control 
technologies  and  practices 
consistent  with  international  good  practices  as  reflected  in  internationally 
recognized  standards  such  as  the  World  Bank  Group’s  Environmental, 
Health  and  Safety  Guidelines.  Adopt  cleaner  production  processes  and 
good energy efficiency practices. Avoid pollution, or, when avoidance is not 
possible, minimize or control the intensity or load of pollutant emissions and 
discharges,  including  direct  and  indirect  greenhouse  gases  emissions, 
waste generation, and release of hazardous materials from their production, 
transportation, handling, and storage. Avoid the use of hazardous materials 
subject  to  international  bans  or  phase-outs.  Purchase,  use,  and  manage 
pesticides based on integrated pest management approaches and reduce 
reliance on synthetic chemical pesticides. 
Provide  workers  with  safe  and  healthy  working  conditions  and  prevent 
accidents,  injuries,  and  disease.  Establish  preventive  and  emergency 
preparedness  and  response  measures  to  avoid,  and  where  avoidance  is 
not possible, to minimize, adverse impacts and risks to the health and safety 
of local communities. 
Conserve  physical  cultural  resources  and  avoid  destroying  or  damaging 
them by using field-based surveys that employ qualified and experienced 
experts during environmental assessment. Provide for the use of “chance 
include  a  pre-approved  management  and 
find”  procedures 
conservation approach for materials that may be discovered during project 
implementation.

General Criteria 
In general the criteria to be met for selection of the subprojects under the Project are as 
12. 
follows: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
The subprojects shall only be selected from the list of projects prioritized by the 
Government (such as in short and/or medium term plan);  
The subprojects shall only involve activities that follow all the government 
regulations;  
The subprojects are not types of projects listed in ADB SPS‘s Appendix 5 (ADB 
326     Appendix 8 
(iv) 
Prohibited Investment Activities List) that do not qualify for ADB‘s financing2; and  
The  subprojects  shall  meet  environmental  requirements.  They  are  subject  to 
mandatory  environmental  assessment,  especially 
that  may  have 
considerable adverse impacts to the environment or are located in environmentally 
sensitive areas. 
those 
Any  subproject,  which  does  not  meet  the  general  criteria  listed  above,  would  be 
13. 
unacceptable to ADB and the Government.  
C. 
Avoidance of Protected Areas 
Consistent with Basic Principles of Environmental Safeguard (Point 8),  project activities 
14. 
will  not  be  allowed  in  areas  of  critical  habitats.  Annex  III  of  the  Decree  of  the  Minister  of 
Environment No. 05/2012 on Type of Business and/or Activities Requiring Environmental Impact 
Assessment, identifies 20 (twenty) classifications of protected areas (by regulation under Ministry 
of Forestry, Ministry of Public Works and Housing, etc). The following areas should be avoided 
for project sitting: 
Protected forest area; 
Peat area; 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii)  Watershed (catchment) area. 
Coast demarcation (corridor); 
(iv) 
River demarcation (corridor);  
(v) 
Area around lake or reservoir; 
(vi) 
(vii) 
Flora sanctuary and marine sanctuary; 
(viii)  Natural reserve and marine reserve; 
(ix)  Mangrove forested coast area; 
(x) 
(xi) 
(xii)  Natural tourism park and marine tourism park; 
(xiii)  Cultural and knowledge heritage area; 
(xiv)  Natural geology reserve area; 
(xv)  Groundwater recharge area; 
(xvi)  Spring demarcation;  
(xvii)  Genetic protection area; 
(xviii)  Fauna refugee area; 
(xix)  Coral reef; and 
(xx)  Corridor area for protected flora or marine biota. 
National park and national marine park; 
Forest park; 
For these  areas,  any  use  beyond  the  purpose  of the  original  function  and/or  protection 
15. 
should be avoided. These areas are normally identified in Spatial Planning documents.  
16. 
This  sitting  criterion  also  corresponds  with  ADB  Environmental  Safeguard  –  Good 
Practices Working Source Book (2012 Draft), which prevents siting of projects on critical habitat. 
According to this sourcebook, critical habitat is defined as an area that has high biodiversity value 
and may include sites that are legally protected or officially proposed for protection such as areas 
2  ADB uses a list of ineligible items to prohibit the purchase of specific goods and services under program loans. This 
list includes such goods as alcohol beverages, tobacco, jewellery, nuclear reactors and radioactive materials, military 
supplies, and hazardous substances.

that meet International Union  for  Conservation of  Nature (IUCN)  classification  criteria,  Ramsar 
List  of  Wetlands  of  International  Importance,  and  United  Nations  Educational,  Scientific,  and 
Cultural Organization (UNESCO) world natural heritage sites. 
D. 
Impacts and Mitigation Measures 
17. 
Potential environmental impacts associated with the proposed project are classified as: (i) 
impacts during design and construction phase; and (ii) impacts during operation and maintenance 
(post construction) phase. The impacts and mitigation measures are described below. 
E. 
Mitigation Measures Related to design (Pre-Construction) and Construction Phase 
1. 
Excavation/Borrow Area and Land Use Change 
For the proposed structural construction, substantial quantity of excavation will be required 
18. 
in  the  borrow  pit  areas.  The  impacts  of  the  excavation  are  among  others  dust,  soil  spillage, 
transport  related  disturbance,  aesthetics,  change  of  natural  landscape  and  landslide  and 
increasing run-off and flood.  
19. 
The  impacts  will  be  minimized  by  applying  good  practice  of  engineering  (including 
Indonesian  National  Standard/SNI  and  government  guidelines)  as  controlled  through  standard 
bidding documents, among others: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
(v) 
(vi) 
(vii) 
site clearance; 
minimizing run-off; 
isolation of works area; 
de-watering of isolated area; 
treatment/disposal of contaminated water; 
temporary river crossings; 
reinstatement of bed/banks. 
The closed borrow pit areas can be used to build settlements, farms and others use as 
20. 
suggested in the design (special requirement of owners).  
2. 
Quarry and Land use Change  
21. 
A  structural  project  would  require  a  significant  amount  of  construction  particularly  the 
earthen material. It will be a condition of Construction Contracts that all materials required for the 
construction  of  embankment  and  roads  shall  be  procured  from  quarries  approved  by  the 
government and with necessary formal environmental approvals.  
22. 
The environmental aspects and control of pollution due to quarrying operation of  approved 
quarries are controlled and monitored by the third party operators (contractors). Thus, adverse 
impacts as a result of quarrying operations are not envisaged in the proposed project. 
23. 
During  the  construction  there  will  be  some  debris/excavated  soil  from  demolition  of 
existing old structures, which shall be temporarily disposed/collected at land near the work site, 
before permanently disposed to other disposal location and/or taken for earth filling elsewhere. 
For  that  reason,  some  portion  of  (appropriate)  land  at  work  site  need to be  earmarked for the 
dumping (of construction waste). The land at work site shall also be free from any social issue. 
328     Appendix 8 
3. 
Noise and Vibration 
24. 
During  construction  phase,  noise  will  be  generated  from  various  activities  such  as  site 
clearing, excavation, erection, finishing, etc. The general noise levels during construction phase 
due to the operation of heavy earth moving equipment and machineries installation can potentially 
go up to 100 dB(A) at the work sites. It is also to be noted that significant amount of manual labor 
will be involved during construction of embankments. 
25. 
However, the increase in noise levels will be localized, temporary in nature and mostly will 
be  during  working  hours  only.  This  impact  is  one  of  issues  to  be  discussed  with  communities 
during public consultation.  
26. 
Various noise control measures can be adopted such as: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
Site  Controls:  Where  possibly  placing  equipment  away  from  sensitive  receptors 
and where not possible using temporary noise barriers. 
Scheduling  of  Project  Activities:  Operations  will  be  scheduled  to  when  people 
would be least likely to be affected. For example, construction activities could be 
restricted between 10 P.M. and 6 A.M. near residential areas if specifically required 
by local communities. 
Protection  devices  (ear  plugs  or  ear  muffs)  will  be  provided  to  the  workers 
operating in the vicinity of high noise generating machines. 
Construction equipment and machinery shall be fitted with silencers (if applicable) 
and maintained properly. 
27. 
In  line  with  contracting  practice  for  this  project,  the  contractor  will  be  responsible  for 
properly  maintaining  the  noise  generating  machines.  Rather  than  the  contract  specifying  what 
actual  methods  the  Contractor  must  adopt,  the  Contractor  will  produce  the  operational 
Environmental Management Plans (including methods to control noise) together with normal Work 
Plans for approval by the Supervising Engineer. The Supervising Engineer will be responsible for 
immediate monitoring  of  compliance  of  environmental  conditions  and  ensure  that  the  Contract 
Conditions will enable enforcement of immediate remedial actions. 
4. 
Air Pollution  
28. 
During the construction phase, there will be two main sources of air emissions, i.e., mobile 
sources  and  stationary  sources.  Mobile  sources  are  mostly  vehicles  involved  in  construction 
activities,  whereas  emissions  from  stationary  sources  include  construction  equipment  & 
machinery, diesel generator sets, excavation/ grading activities etc. It would not be possible to 
distinguish  between  the  emissions  from  project  construction  vehicles  and  equipment  and 
emissions from non-project vehicles. 
Construction-related airborne dust can arise from both vehicular traffic generating fugitive 
29. 
dust  on  paved  and  unpaved  roads  (and  especially  where  there  are  spillages  of  soil  from 
construction  transport  vehicles  to  the  public  roads  and  soil/aggregate  material  handling  and 
processing).  As  for  noise  control,  the  requirement  shall  be  set  up  in  tender  and  contract 
documents that the Contractor is obliged to prepare Contractor’s EMP as part of their Work Plan, 
which shall specify methods to control dust. The compliance monitoring on the requirement will 
be carried out by the Supervising Engineer. 
Appendix 8      329 
5. 
Water Pollution  
30. 
The requirements in the Construction contract will include specific measures for: 
(i) 
(ii) 
proper  collection  and  disposal  of  all  wastewater,  whether  from  workers  on  the 
construction area itself or from temporary labor camps; 
preventing  oils  and  similar  escaping  from  refueling.  servicing  or  storage 
operations; 
(iii)  minimizing the amount of “in-stream” operations by heavy construction equipment; 
preventing the dumping of any solid or sludge material into the river or on the banks 
(iv) 
from where storm rain could wash it into the river; and 
As for other aspects, it is required for the Contractor to nominate specific methods 
to be adopted in accordance with Contractor’s Work Plan, and with suggestions 
from the Supervising Engineer to ensure compliance. 
(v) 
31. 
Notwithstanding these controls, it will not be possible to prevent (as currently occurs) high 
suspended  solids  levels  in  the  flood  flows  during  high  rain  events.  Some  mitigation  shall  be 
proposed  to  solve  the  problem,  among  others  minimizing  extent  of  disturbed  area,  especially 
steep areas such as embankments (and especially during rain season) and provision of temporary 
silt traps. 
Discharge of untreated domestic sewage to the river or to any natural waters will not be 
32. 
permitted. No debris shall be dumped in the water bodies. 
33. 
Typical  method  for  large  temporary  land  disturbance  activities  such  as  for  dike 
construction  is  use  of  silt  fence,  a  temporary  barrier  designed  to  retain  sediment  on  the 
construction site. It consists of a geo-textile attached to supporting posts that are trenched into 
the ground. The fence retains sediment primarily by retarding flow and promoting deposition on 
the uphill side of the fence. Runoff is also filtered as it passes through the geo-textile. 
6. 
People Access (during construction) 
34. 
The disturbance may occur from vehicular movement along the road near the settlement. 
The mobilization of material and personnel from and to the project site during the construction 
phase  generates  heavy  traffic,  which  otherwise  carefully  managed,  will  cause  congestion  and 
disturbance  to  people  daily  access  to  the  area.  Since  the  direct  project  construction  has  very 
limited effect on the river itself, except for some minor cross river bridges, there should be almost 
no disturbance to boat use on the river. If it occurs, it only affects cross-river ferries, small boats 
and to sand excavation mid-river and transporting to shore-based loading onto trucks. 
35. 
To  mitigate  and  compensate  the  social  impacts  related  to  land  acquisition  and 
resettlement,  a  Resettlement  Plan    following  the  requirements  of  the  Government  and  in 
compliance  with  ADB  the  social  impacts3  has  been  prepared  in  consultation  with  the  central, 
provincial, and district governments.  
7. 
Occupational Health and Safety  
36. 
The risks associated with the proposed project are minimal. However, with roads being 
narrow,  efforts  shall  be  made  so  that  no  hazardous  traffic  conditions  are  created  due  to 
3  ADB. 1998. Handbook on Resettlement: A Guide to Good Practice. Manila

construction vehicle movement. Local people may potentially encroach to construction area and 
get hurt. 
37. 
This can be mitigated by adequate lighting and fluorescent signage shall be provided at 
the construction sites. Signage shall be made in local language. The workers shall be provided 
with  necessary  Personal  Protective  Equipment  and  a  First  Aid  kit.  In  case  of  emergency  the 
victims will be referred to the nearest hospitals or clinics. Contractors will be recommended to use 
the World Bank Group’s Occupation Health and Safety Guidelines.4 Standard contract conditions 
have specific requirements related to worker and public safety. 
8. 
Mitigation  Measures  Related  to  Operational  and  Maintenance  (Post 
Construction) Phase 
a.  People Access  
38. 
The structural project will also build inspection road along the right and left banks of the 
river,  providing  access  for  people  as  well  as  supporting  river  inspection  and  maintenance. 
Crossing bridges are also provided to serve people to move from one side of the river to another 
easily  and  safely.  The  design  of  bridges  considers  height  of  flood  level  at  peak  flow  from  the 
upstream. For that reason, generally impact of the river normalization to the people access during 
post construction is positive.  
9. 
Changes in Water Level 
39. 
The proposed works will have a significant effect on flood levels in the river floodplain. The 
embankments will confine all flows to estimated Q25 within the river cross section that includes 
(for peak flows) access roads, thereby reducing the amount of flooding in the areas adjacent to 
the new works. 
10. 
River Morphology and Drainage Change  
40. 
The new structures (such as dikes) will not be changing the river’s low and medium flow 
morphology. At high flows the difference will be that the flows up to Q25 will in future remain within 
the river cross section, albeit the peak flows on the access roads, rather than at present spreading 
out though residential areas. 
41. 
Provision shall be made not to obstruct the natural drainage from discharging into the river. 
The strengthening and widening of the existing embankment structure and provision of necessary 
cross-drainage facilities like sluice gates, and  bank protection works will improve the drainage 
system in both inland and in the river reaches.5

provided in Appendix 5. 
The  CPMU  will  (i)  ensure  approval  of  the  AMDAL  and  UKL/UPL  by  the  relevant 
49. 
environment  authority  at  the  provincial  or  district  level;  and  (ii)  issuance  of  environmental 
clearance/permit as part of the AMDAL process. Draft AMDAL or UKL/UPL will be submitted to 
ADB  for  review  and  approval  prior  to  formal  submission  for  approval  to  provincial  or  district 
environmental  agency.  Government  approved  AMDAL  or  UKL/UPL  which  has  incorporated 
ADB’s  comments  is  the  only  environmental  documentation  required.  Any  change  and/or 
addendum applies as prevailing regulation (see Point 3 below). 
Expire and New AMDAL Requirement 
50. 
Basically the AMDAL or UKL/UPL is applicable for whole life time of the project. However, 
it is legally considered obsolete when main physical activities are not implemented during the 3 
(three)  years  period  since  the  decision  of  approval.  Under  such  circumstance,  the  AMDAL  or 
UKL/UPL document should be submitted to provincial or district environmental agency for review. 
The decision may be in favor of a new AMDAL or the old one, which is still considered  valid.  
7  AMDAL  refers  to  environmental  impact  assessment  at  whole,  while  ANDAL  is  part  of  the  assessment  where 
environmental  impact  analysis  (ANDAL)  carried  out  for  the  significant  issues.  In  addition  to  ANDAL  report,  the 
assessment  will  be  supported  with  RKL/RPL  (equivalent  to  EMP)  for  managing/mitigating  the  impacts  and 
subsequently monitoring the effectiveness of the environmental impacts management/mitigation. 
334     Appendix 8 
51. 
The review of AMDAL or UKL/UPL is also applicable in case of change of location, design, 
process, capacity, raw material or significant environmental change occurs due to natural event 
or  other  causes  before  the  implementation  of  the  activities.  Under  such  circumstance,  a  new 
AMDAL or UKL/UPL may be required.  
Implementation of EMP 
52. 
As described in the AMDAL and UKL/UPL, implementation of mitigation measures in EMP 
(RKL/RPL) will be the responsibility of the PIUs based on contracts with the contractor/developer, 
with assistance from the national environmental safeguard specialist, under the supervision of the 
CPMU.  
53. 
The  respective  AMDAL  or  UKL/UPL  requirements  will  be  incorporated  into  the  works 
bidding documents and contracts. This ensures that the civil works contractors will have primary 
responsibility  for  the  implementation  of  the  required  environmental  safeguards  measures. 
Contractors  are  required  to  have  specific  staff  with  responsibility  for  environmental  and  social 
management.  Bidders  are  required  as  part  of  their  bid  to  submit  contractor’s  Environmental 
Management Plan, including a Traffic Management Plan (TMP), conforming to the requirements 
of  the  various  environmental  documents.  These  will  be  developed  into  detailed  plans  by  the 
winning contractor.  
54. 
Each PIU will  assign an environment officer to ensure EMP implementation. The officers 
will work on behalf of the PIUs for the entire project duration to implement the project EMP. The 
officers will report directly to the PIUs. The duties of PIU’s Environment Officer are explained in 
Section B.2. below.  
Safeguard Monitoring  
In addition to the internal monitoring, the Project Administration Manual (PAM) requires 
55. 
independent  monitoring  on  the  safeguards  to  ensure  that  all  recommendations  and  mitigation 
measures under the IEE and the AMDAL (environmental impact assessment in the Indonesian 
system) of the core subproject in Ciujung, as well as the AMDAL of all potential subprojects are 
being implemented. 
56. 
An  independent  safeguard  monitoring  entity  will  be  engaged  by  each  PIU  to  conduct 
monitoring for the subprojects as specified in the environmental monitoring plan under the IEEs 
and the AMDAL. They will provide quarterly environmental safeguard monitoring  reports to the 
PIU.  
Role of Institutions and Parties 
1. 
CPMU, CPIU and PIUs 
57. 
The  Ministry  of  Public Works  and  Housing  (MPWH) through  the  Directorate General  of 
Water  Resources  (DGWR)  will  be  the  executing  agency.  A  Central  Project  Management  Unit 
(CPMU) will be established in the Directorate of River and Coast (DRC), DGWR. A Central Project 
Implementation  Unit  (CPIU)  will  also  be  established  under  DRC,  DGWR  for  the  provision  of 
technical  guidance  to  the  River  Basin  Organizations  (RBOs),  the  Balai  Besar  Wilayah  Sungai 
(National  River  Basin  Organization)  of  Cidanau-Ciujung-Cidurian  (BBWS  3  Cis),  and the  Balai 
Besar  Wilayah  (BWS)  of  Maluku  as  implementing  agencies.  The  CPMU  will  assure  overall 
planning, coordination, and reporting for the project. The DRC NPIU will be responsible to select,

Infrastructure and Facility (DGAIF) will be responsible for the implementation of the sustainable 
agriculture  practices  in  the  3  Cis  RBT  in  cooperation  with  provincial  and  district  agriculture 
agencies.  A  CPIU  will  be  established  in  DGAIF,  while  Provincial  Project  Implementation  Unit 
(PPIU)  and  District  Project  Implementation  Unit  (DPIU)  will  respectively  be  established  in  the 
provincial and district agriculture agencies. 
59. 
Under the overall guidance and responsibility of the CPIU under the Directorate General 
of  Regional  Development  (DGRD),  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs  (MOHA),  provincial  and  district 
planning agencies (BAPPEDAs) will ensure institutional strengthening, planning and coordination 
of provincial and local disaster management, public works, social and forestry agencies. PPIUs 
and  DPIUs  will  be  established  in  each  of  the  provincial  and  district  agencies  involved  in 
community-based flood risk management (CBFRM) activities. The BAPPEDAs will ensure that 
FRMPs are accordingly reflected into spatial, mid-term and annual plans of the various involved 
sectors. 
Environmental Officers 
60. 
Each  PIU  under  the  BBWS3  CIs  and  BWSM  will  assign  a  counterpart  staff  as  an 
environment officer to oversee the implementation of the environmental management plan, act 
as a focal point for the grievance redress mechanism, and facilitate the AMDAL development and 
approval process. This will be reflected in PIU decrees. 
61. 
Qualified environmental officers will be appointed to support the CPIUs and PIUs. CPMU 
together  with  the  BBWS  3  Cis  and  BWSM  with  the  support  of  consultants  will  supervise  the 
preparation and implementation of the AMDAL requirements and will monitor, and report to the 
CPMU  on  all  environmental  safeguard  activities.  Project  progress  reports  will  indicate  which 
subprojects require AMDAL, and the status of implementation. Semi-annual monitoring reports 
on the implementation of the AMDAL’s will be submitted to ADB review.

INTERNAL MONITORING REPORT TEMPLATE 
*  Note:  The  approach  taken  is  to  keep  the  reporting  requirements  as  simple  as  possible  by 
focusing on key issues and not overburden the executing agency (EA) with questions that may be 
too cumbersome for them to collect and maintain data on. Any text included in square brackets “[ 
]” means it is intended to be in the template as direction to the project management unit (PMU). 
Text in “{ }” means it is comments to SERD. This is intended as a sample template to be adapted 
for specific project or country requirements as needed.

which certain sections were cleared before others. Thus, the column headings may need to be adjusted depending 
on the nature of the project and loan conditions. Narrative of partial handover of land that had no resettlement 
impacts may be warranted.}

II. 
Resettlement  
{The  reiteration  of  actual  impacts  on  houses  is  important  because  often  there  can  be  a  lot  of 
changes  from  what  was  estimated  in  the  RP  compared  to  actual  impacts  –  either  increase  or 
decrease.  Also  the  numbers  of  actual  physically  displaced  persons  can  affect  the  safeguards 
categorization so there is a need to be on top of this.}
