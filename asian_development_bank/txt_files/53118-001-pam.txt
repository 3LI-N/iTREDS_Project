Project Administration Manual Purpose and Process 
1.  The  project  administration  manual  (PAM)  describes  the  essential  administrative  and 
management requirements to implement the project on time, within budget, and in accordance 
with the policies and procedures of the government and Asian Development Bank (ADB). The 
PAM should include references to all available templates and instructions either through linkages 
to relevant URLs or directly incorporated in the PAM. 
2.  The  Ministry  of  Regional  Development  and  Infrastructure  of  Georgia  (MRDI),  Municipal 
Development Fund of Georgia (MDF), Tbilisi City Municipality (TCM), and Tbilisi Development 
Fund (TDF) are wholly responsible for the implementation of ADB-financed projects, as agreed 
jointly between the borrower and ADB, and in accordance with the policies and procedures of 
the  government  and  ADB.  ADB  staff  is  responsible  for  supporting  implementation  including 
compliance  by MRDI, MDF,  TCM  and  TDF  of their  obligations  and responsibilities  for  project 
implementation in accordance with ADB’s policies and procedures. 
3.  At loan negotiations, the borrower and ADB shall agree to the PAM and ensure consistency with 
the loan agreement. Such agreement shall be reflected in the minutes of the loan negotiations. 
In the event of any discrepancy or contradiction between the PAM and the loan agreement, the 
provisions of the loan agreement shall prevail. 
4.  After ADB Board approval of the project's report and recommendations of the President (RRP), 
changes in implementation arrangements are subject to agreement and approval pursuant to 
relevant government and ADB administrative procedures (including the Project Administration 
Instructions) and upon such approval, they will be subsequently incorporated in the PAM.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
1. 
The Livable Cities Investment Project for Balanced Development (LCIP) is a sector loan 
project for a total loan amount of €101 million ($119.9 million equivalent) that will improve livability 
and  inclusive  economic  growth  in  Georgia  including  the  seven  lagging  regions—Kvemo  Kartli, 
Samegrelo-Zemo Svaneti, Kakheti, Samstkhe-Javakheti, Shida Kartli, Imereti and Guria—and the 
capital city Tbilisi.1 The project will improve the quality of life of at least 1.5 million people (of which 
52%  are  women)  across  Georgia  through  integrated  urban  solutions  for  inclusive and climate-
resilient  urban  infrastructure  and  services,  improved  accessibility,  connectivity  and  economic 
competitiveness, and enhanced institutional capacity. The project will upgrade urban centers and 
other  settlements,  public  spaces,  and  parks;  restore  cultural  heritage  buildings  and  natural 
heritage  sites;  upgrade  roads;  and  construct  community  infrastructure  such  as  kindergartens, 
libraries, e-learning centers, and sports and tourism facilities. Universal design and accessibility 
standards will be applied for all project components.2  
2. 
The project is aligned with the following impact: Sustainable economic growth, improved 
livability  and  balanced  development  promoted  in  Georgia.3  The  project  will  have  the  following 
outcome: Livability and inclusive economic growth in Georgia improved.4 The project will improve 
the  livability,  accessibility,  mobility,  and  the  quality  of  public  spaces  with  the  application  of  the 
inclusive  cities  guidelines,  Georgia’s  first-ever  gender-responsive  and  accessibility  standards, 
developed  by  ADB  and  adopted  by  the  government  to  adapt  the  built  environment  for  older 
persons, persons with disabilities, women, and children (footnote 2). 
3. 
The project outputs are: (i) inclusive and climate-resilient urban infrastructure rehabilitated 
and  constructed  and  services  improved;  (ii)  accessibility,  connectivity,  and  mobility  in  tourism 
clusters across Georgia improved; and (iii) institutional capacity for sustainable urban and regional 
development enhanced.

PROJECT MANAGEMENT ARRANGEMENTS 
Project Implementation Organizations: Roles and Responsibilities 
The Ministry of Regional Development and Infrastructure  of Georgia (MRDI) and Tbilisi 
4. 
City  Municipality  (TCM)  are  the  executing  agencies  responsible  for  overall  guidance,  strategic 
decisions, and oversight of the implementation for the project. The implementing agency for the 
regional components is the LEPL Municipal Development Fund of Georgia (MDF). MDF under 
MRDI  will  coordinate  with  other  agencies  and  organizations  for  the  micro,  small  and  medium 
enterprise components. The NEPL Tbilisi Development Fund (TDF) will act as the implementing 
agency responsible for the Tbilisi components. 
To ensure oversight, at central level, a steering committee (SC) will be constituted with 
5. 
Deputy Minister of Ministry of Finance (MOF) as the Chairperson. Other members of the SC will 
be Minister or Deputy Minister from MRDI, Mayor or Deputy Mayor of TCM, Executive Director of 
MDF, and Chief Executive Officer of TDF. The roles and responsibilities are summarized in Table 
3. 
6. 
Both  MDF  and  TDF  have  established  Project  Management  Units  (PMUs)  that  oversee 
design,  manage  procurement  processes,  supervise  construction,  assure  technical  quality  of 
designs and construction, and provide support on capacity building, governance improvement, 
and  awareness  building.  The  PMUs  will  procure  contractors  and  manage  construction  and 
commissioning activities. For social and environmental safeguards, the PMUs will appoint staff to 
oversee safeguards monitoring and compliance.  
7. 
MDF  will  recruit  most  of  its  18  PMU  staff  as  project  support  consultants.  Eight  project 
support consultants engaged under the LCIP project readiness financing will be transferred to the 
ensuing  loan,  while  an  additional  six  consultants  will  be  hired  in  2021.  The  PMU  is  further 
strengthened  by  four  full-time  MDF  seconded  staff.  The  MDF  PMU  will  also  be  supported  by 
construction supervision consultants, one team for kindergartens and sports facilities, and another 
one for urban upgrading subprojects.  
TDF aims to guarantee PMU sustainability by filling the 11 positions with its own staff or 
8. 
consultants. Where expertise is not available in-house, TDF will recruit new staff or consultants 
such as for Environment and social safeguards, Procurement etc. A team of Project Management 
Consultants (PMC) will support the PMU in establishing its project management systems and will 
provide staff training in all elements of ADB project implementation management. Construction 
supervision consultants will provide support during implementation of all subprojects. TDF’s PMU 
will  closely  coordinate  with  the  Environmental  Protection  Department  and  Transportation  and 
Urban  Development  Authority  of  TCM  regarding  design/supervision/other  technical  consultant 
deliverables and will request for comments/no-objection for approval of such deliverables.

III. 
COSTS AND FINANCING 
9. 
The total project costs will be covered by the ADB and the Government of Georgia. The 
total project cost is estimated at €152.1 million ($180.5 million equivalent), of which €101 million 
($119.9 million equivalent) will be financed by ADB’s regular ordinary capital resources, and €51.1 
million ($60.6 million equivalent) will be financed by the Government of Georgia. ADB will finance 
the  expenditures  in  relation  to  civil  works,  goods,  consulting  and  non-consulting  services, 
environment and social mitigation, project management, financial charges during implementation, 
and  part  of  the  administrative  expenses  exclusive  of  taxes  and  duties.  The  government  will 
finance taxes and duties, land acquisition and resettlement costs, contingency costs, and part of 
the administration expenses. 
A. 
Cost Estimates Preparation and Revisions  
10. 
The cost estimates have been prepared by in June 2021 by the Transaction and Advisory 
Technical Assistant (TRTA) consultant based on market prices for consulting services and civil 
works  and  the  estimates  from  the  detailed  engineering  design  prepared  by  the  responsible 
designers of each subproject, in accordance with Georgian norms as provided in the Government 
Publication “Supply of Materials and Services for Construction” and checking of the market rates 
at time of design. The cost estimates will be updated for each package at the stage of Invitation 
for Bid. 
11. 
The  cost  of  each  project  is  fixed  during  the  Tender  and  process  subsequent  Contract 
Negotiation  and  signing.  During  Implementation  of  the  Works,  revising  and  updating  Cost 
Estimates  is  done  as  part  of  the  Variation  Process,  and  requires  the  Supervising  Engineer  to 
examine the Contractor’s request for increase. This is usually only possible due to a narrow series 
of situations, firstly, if the Client requests changes to the design, if there is an increase of more 
than a set volume of materials, or if there are significant and unexpected changes in the market 
price beyond the control of the Contractor. The Contractor, if the Engineer supports their need for 
a  Variation,  will  then  negotiate  the  final  price  with  the  Client.  Once  the  Variation  is  agreed,  a 
Contract Variation will be sent to ADB for their No Objection, and if this is received, the Contract 
Variation will be signed by the relevant parties.  
The Bills of Quantity and Cost Estimates were examined and found to be within the rates 
12. 
expected by Government standards and market rates for materials and labor. 
B. 
Key Assumptions 
13. 
The following key assumptions underpin the cost estimates and financing plan: 
Exchange rate: USD is used in cost estimates  
As of 9 September 2021, €1 = $1.18; Georgian Lari (GEL) 3.115 = $1.00

FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT 
A. 
Financial Management Assessment 
The  financial  management  assessment  (FMA)  was  conducted  in  December  2020  in 
16. 
accordance with ADB’s Guidelines for the Financial Management and Analysis of  Projects and 
the  Financial  Due  Diligence:  A  Methodology  Note.  The  FMA  considered  the  capacity  of  the 
executing  agencies  (MRDI  and  TCM)  and  implementing  agencies  (MDF  and  TDF),  including 
funds-flow  arrangements,  staffing,  accounting  and  financial  reporting  systems,  financial 
information systems, and internal and external auditing arrangements. Based on the assessment, 
the  key  financial  management  risks  identified  are  (i)  susceptibility  to  factors  arising  from  the 
project’s environment, such as country rules and regulations and entity working environment; (ii) 
susceptibility that the Project’s accounting and internal controls framework will be inadequate to 
ensure Project funds are used economically and efficiently and for the purpose intended, and that 
the  use  of  funds  is  properly  reported.  It  is  concluded  that  the  overall  premitigation  financial 
management risk of the executing and implementing agencies is “Substantial” mainly because 
of  identified  TCM  and  TDF  risks.  MDF  has  experience  implementing  large  IFI-funded 
infrastructure projects and has administrative and accounting capacity to manage donor funds. 
TDF has an annual average budget of GEL 75 million ($23 million) and has more than 10 years 
of  experience  managing  construction  projects  of  up  to  $7.5  million.  However,  TDF  lacks  the 
experience  in  managing  ADB-funded  projects,  knowledge  of  ADB  financial  procedures,  and 
capacity to manage under IFI rules and procedures the large cash balance and disbursement that 
will arise out of the proposed loan. MRDI has extensive experience as an EA, including for ADB-
funded projects.  
17. 
Proposed  risk  mitigation  measures  include:  (i)  training  relevant  TCM  and  TDF  staff  on 
ADB monitoring, financial reporting and disbursement procedures; (ii) on-the-job training of TDF 
PMU  staff,  including  by  the  recently-engaged  Financial  Management  consultant;  (iii)  annual 
monitoring of EAs and IAs financial performance, which  will be IPSAS-based from 2021 in the 
case of TCM and TDF; (iv) liquidating the advance fund account quarterly and depositing funds 
in  a  Treasury  Department  of  MOF;  (v)  quarterly  provision  of  advance  account  reconciliation 
statements and interim (half yearly) project financial statements to ADB; (vi) strengthening internal 
audit  processes  in  TCM  and  performing  independent  annual  project  audit  by  an  audit  firm 
acceptable to ADB; and (vii) accounting data back-up plan and systems implementation.  
18.  We conclude that these measures will ensure appropriate use of the advance account and 
statement of expenditure procedures for which the thresholds set are currently at minimum levels. 
The borrower and executing agencies and implementing agencies have agreed to implement an 
action plan as key measures to address the deficiencies. The financial management action plan 
is provided in Table 11.

Disbursement Arrangements for ADB Funds 
The  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  Loan  Disbursement 
19. 
Handbook  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)5,  and  detailed  arrangements  agreed  upon 
between the government and ADB. Online training for project staff on disbursement policies and 
procedures  is  available.6  Project  staff  are  encouraged  to  avail  of  this  training  to  help  ensure 
efficient disbursement and fiduciary control.

Direct  payment  procedure.  This  procedure  will  be  used  for  payment  to  contractors, 
20. 
suppliers of goods, and supervision consultants. Contractors will submit an invoice along with an 
interim  progress  certificate  (IPC)  showing  the  completed  civil  works  for  the  period.  The 
construction  supervision  consultants  will  review  the  IPC  against  the  contract  and  endorse  the 
invoice to the implementing agency (MDF/TDF). Upon satisfactory review, MDF/TDF will prepare 
a withdrawal application (WA) for direct payment to the contractor, for signature of loan authorized 
signatories. ADB will make payment to the contractor based on the submitted WA. The contracts 
for  supply  of  goods  will  be  administered  by  MDF.  The  suppliers  will  prepare  their  invoices 
according to the conditions in the contract and submit these to MDF for approval. Upon approval, 
MDF will prepare a WA for direct payment to the supplier, for signature of the loan authorized 
signatories.  The  minimum  size  of  a  WA  shall  be  $100,000.  All  claims  shall  be  processed  and 
consolidated  by  the  IA  prior  to  WA  submission  to  ADB  to  ensure  efficient  disbursement 
administration. Withdrawal applications will be prepared by the IA and signed by person(s) who 
is authorized by the Ministry of Finance to sign on behalf of the government. Proper books and 
records  are  to  be  maintained  by  the  IA  and  supporting  documents  should  be  readily  made 
available  for  review  by  ADB’s  disbursement  and  review  missions,  upon  ADB’s  request  for 
submission on a sampling basis, and for independent audit. 
21. 
Advance  fund  procedure.  Two  advance  accounts  will  be  established  in  the  Treasury 
Account  of  the  Ministry  of  Finance  with  the  National  Bank  of  Georgia  and  maintained  by  the 
respective IA. The currency of the advance accounts is in Euro (€). This procedure will be used 
for  small  payments  of  eligible  project  expenditures.  The  advance  accounts  are  to  be  used 
exclusively for ADB’s share of eligible expenditures. The IAs who administer the advance account 
are accountable and responsible for proper use of advances to the advance account.  
22. 
The total outstanding advance to the advance accounts should not exceed the estimate 
of ADB’s share of expenditures to be paid through the advance accounts for the forthcoming 6 
months. The IAs may request for initial and additional advances to the advance accounts based 
on  an  Estimate  of  Expenditure  Sheet7  setting  out  the  estimated  expenditures  to  be  financed 
through the accounts for the forthcoming 6 months. Supporting documents should be submitted 
to ADB or retained by the IAs in accordance with ADB’s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as 
amended from time to time) when liquidating or replenishing the advance accounts. 
Statement  of  expenditure  (SOE)  procedure.8  The  SOE  procedure  may  be  used  for 
23. 
reimbursement of eligible expenditures or liquidation of advances to the advance accounts. The 
ceiling of the SOE procedure is the equivalent of $200,000 per individual payment. Supporting 
documents and records for the expenditures claimed under the SOE should be maintained and 
made  readily  available  for  review  by  ADB's  disbursement  and  review  missions,  upon  ADB's 
request for submission of supporting documents on a sampling basis, and for independent audit. 
Reimbursement  and  liquidation  of  individual  payments  in  excess  of the SOE  ceiling  should  be 
supported by full documentation when submitting the withdrawal application to ADB. 
24. 
Before the submission of the first withdrawal application (WA), the borrower should submit 
to  ADB  sufficient  evidence  of  the  authority  of  the  person(s)  who  will  sign  the  withdrawal 
applications on behalf of the government, together with the authenticated specimen signatures of 
each  authorized  person.  The  minimum  value  per  WA  is  stipulated  in  the  Loan  Disbursement 
7 Estimate of Expenditure sheet is available in Appendix 8A of ADB’s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended 
from time to time),

Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time). Individual payments below such amount should 
be paid (i) by the IAs and subsequently claimed to ADB through reimbursement, or (ii) through 
the advance fund procedure, unless otherwise accepted by ADB.  The borrower should ensure 
sufficient category and contract balances before requesting disbursements. Use of ADB’s Client 
Portal for Disbursements (CPD)9 system is encouraged for submission of withdrawal applications 
to ADB. 
2. 
Disbursement Arrangements for Counterpart Fund 
The IAs will be responsible for (i) preparing disbursement projections, and (ii) requesting 
25. 
budgetary allocations for counterpart funds for financing local taxes and duties. 
C. 
Accounting 
26. 
The IAs will maintain, or cause to be maintained, separate books and records by funding 
source for all expenditures incurred on the project following International Public Sector Accounting 
Standard for cash-based accounting. IAs will prepare project financial statements in accordance 
with  the  government's  accounting  laws  and regulations  which  are  consistent  with  international 
accounting principles and practices. 
D. 
Auditing and Public Disclosure 
27. 
The IAs (MDF and TDF) will cause the detailed project financial statements to be audited 
in accordance with International Standards on Auditing by an independent auditor acceptable to 
ADB. The audited project financial statements together with the auditor’s opinion will be presented 
in the English language to ADB within 6 months from the end of the fiscal year by the IAs. 
28. 
 Separate  audited  entity financial  statements (prepared following  International  Financial 
Reporting Standards [IFRS]), together with the auditor’s report, will be submitted in the English 
language to ADB by MDF within 12 months from the end of the fiscal year and for TDF within 1 
month after the approval by the relevant authority. 
The audit report for the project financial statements will include a management letter and 
29. 
auditor’s opinions, which cover (i) whether the project financial statements present an accurate 
and fair view or are presented fairly, in all material respects, in accordance with the applicable 
financial  reporting  standards;  and (ii)  whether  the  proceeds  of the  loan were  used  only for the 
purpose(s) of the project. 
30. 
Compliance with financial reporting and auditing requirements will be monitored by review 
missions and during normal program supervision, and followed up regularly with all concerned, 
including the external auditor.  
31. 
The government, executing agencies (MRDI and TCM) and implementing agencies (MDF 
and  TDF)  have  been  made  aware  of  ADB’s  approach  to  delayed  submission,  and  the 
requirements for satisfactory and acceptable quality of the audited project financial statements.10 
9 The CPD facilitates online submission of WA to ADB, resulting in faster disbursement. The forms to be completed by 
the Borrower are available online at https://www.adb.org/documents/client-portal-disbursements-guide.     
10 ADB’s approach and procedures regarding delayed submission of audited project financial statements:  
(i)  When audited project financial statements are not received by the due date, ADB will write to the executing 
agency advising that (a) the audit documents are overdue; and (b) if they are not received within the next 6 
23 
ADB  reserves  the  right  to  require  a  change  in  the  auditor  (in  a  manner  consistent  with  the 
constitution of the borrower), or for additional support to be provided to the auditor, if the audits 
required  are  not  conducted  in  a  manner  satisfactory  to  ADB,  or  if  the  audits  are  substantially 
delayed. ADB reserves the right to verify the project's financial accounts to confirm that the share 
of ADB’s financing is used in accordance with ADB’s policies and procedures.  
32. 
Public disclosure of the audited project financial statements, including the auditor’s opinion 
on the project financial statements, will be guided by ADB’s Access to Information Policy 2018.11 
After the review, ADB will disclose the audited project financial statements and the opinion of the 
auditors on the project financial statements no later than 14 days of ADB’s confirmation of their 
acceptability  by  posting  them  on  ADB’s  website.  The  management  letter,  additional  auditor’s 
opinions, and audited entity financial statements will not be disclosed.12 
V. 
PROCUREMENT AND CONSULTING SERVICES 
A. 
Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing 
33. 
All  advance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  will  be  undertaken  in  conformity  with 
ADB’s  Procurement  Policy13  and  Procurement  Regulations  for  Borrowers  (2017,  as  amended 
from time to time).14 The issuance of invitations for bids under advance contracting and retroactive 
financing  scope  was  approved  by  ADB.  The  borrower,  EAs  and  IAs  have  been  advised  that 
approval of advance contracting and retroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance the 
project. 
Advance contracting. The advance contracting arrangements under the project includes: 
34. 
(i) 26 civil works contracts for reconstruction/construction of kindergartens, sport facilities, project 
consultants  for  MDF,  as  well  as  park  rehabilitation  and  urban  upgrading  works  amounting  to 
around $61.45 million; (ii) 2 packages for procurement of goods for an estimated amount of $2.65 
million;  (iii)  3  consulting  services  contracts  for  recruitment  of  construction  supervision  firms 
amounting  in  total  $3.35  million;  and  (iv)  recruitment  of  project  management  consultants 
(institutional strengthening) for TDF with total estimated amount of approximately $0.50 million. 
The presented costs are indicative. Four contracts for sport facilities have been awarded under 
advance contracting arrangements. 
35. 
Retroactive  financing.  The  maximum  amount  of  eligible  expenditures  for  retroactive 
financing  is  up  to  €20.20 million  ($23.98 million  equivalent), the  equivalent  of  20%  of the  total 
project loan, may be applied for the financing of project expenditures incurred for a period not 
exceeding 20 months before signing of the loan agreement. The limit for retroactive financing is 
months, requests for new contract awards and disbursement such as new replenishment of advance accounts, 
processing of new reimbursement, and issuance of new commitment letters will not be processed. 
(ii)  When  audited  project  financial  statements  are  not  received  within  6  months  after  the  due  date,  ADB  will 
withhold processing of requests for new contract awards and disbursement such as new replenishment of 
advance accounts, processing of new reimbursement, and issuance of new commitment letters. ADB will (a) 
inform the executing agency of ADB’s actions; and (b) advise that the loan may be suspended if the audit 
documents are not received within the next 6 months. 
(iii)  When audited project financial statements  are not received within 12  months after the due date, ADB may 
suspend the loan.

12  months.  Approval  for  an  extension  of  the  retroactive  financing  period  beyond  12  months 
(additional  8  months)  is  requested  during  ADB’s  project  review  and  approval  process,  on  an 
exceptional  basis,  due  to  delays  in  project  processing  caused  by  COVID-19  lockdown,  which 
hampered the due diligence to be undertaken and subsequent changes in the leadership in MRDI 
delayed decision-making. Retroactive financing also includes 11 packages previously identified 
under the Sustainable Urban Transport Investment Program (SUTIP) MFF, and included under 
LCIP as these are critical to achieve the project objective of livability, accessibility, urban transport 
and  mobility.15  The  contracts  for  components  to  be  financed  under  retroactive  financing  are 
included in the draft procurement plan (Appendix 1). 
36. 
All advance contracting and retroactive financing will be undertaken in conformity with the 
procurement framework as set out in ADB’s Procurement Policy and Procurement Regulations 
for  ADB  Borrowers.  The  issuance  of  invitations  for  bids  under  advance  contracting  are  to  be 
approved  by  ADB.  The  borrower  was  advised  that  any  concurrence  by  ADB  with  the 
documentation or proposal for an award does not commit ADB to finance the Project. 
B. 
Procurement of Goods, Works, and Consulting Services 
37. 
All procurement of goods, works and consulting services will be undertaken in accordance 
with  ADB’s  Procurement  Policy  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  Procurement 
Regulation for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time). 
38. 
To  achieve  Value  for  Money,  a  procurement  strategy  was  prepared  during  Strategic 
Procurement  Planning  process,  including  strategic  contract  packaging  and  fit-for-purpose 
procurement method to be used, based on the nature of different package, market analysis and 
previous experience. The Strategic Procurement Plan has identified risks for each of the different 
project  phases  of  procurement,  design  and  contract 
Implementation.  During  project 
implementation, these risks, especially those  “High” risks as identified in “Risk Register” in the 
Procurement Strategy in the Strategic Procurement Planning should be closely monitored. The 
mitigating measures proposed will be carefully considered and properly taken. 
39. 
The  project  procurement  risk  assessment  was  conducted  as  part  of  the  strategic 
procurement planning process, it takes into account the relevant risks identified in the Georgia 
Country/Sector Procurement Risk Assessment (CSPRA 2019) which may have an impact on this 
project. Considering the nature and substance of the questions in the standard questionnaire, the 
procurement  risk  for  MDF  is  assessed  as  “Low”,  while  for  TDF  the  risk  was  assessed  as 
“Medium”.  Further,  taking  into  account  of  the  real  risks  during  implementation  identified  as (i) 
capacity  of  MDF  on  handling  large-scale  of  procurement  with  quite  a  number  of  packages 
geographically widely spread is quite a challenge; (ii) under current COVID-19 situation, since it 
is hard to attract international contractors, the capacity of local contractors to accommodate such 
large-scale of procurement is in question; (iii) the Georgian electronic Government Procurement 
(Ge-GP)  system  will  be  used  for  the  first  time  for  ADB-financed  projects;  (vi)  TDF  has  limited 
knowledge  on  ADB  procurement  policies  and  limited  experience  in  handling  procurement 
financed by ADB; and (vii) contract management capacity of MDF and TDF on large number of 
contracts is a challenge. It is noted that the capacity of MDF to handle advance contracting and 
TDF to start procurement process are being supported by external experts recruited under LCIP 
PRF. The overall project procurement risk for LCIP is assessed as “Medium”. Risks for each of 
15 Multitranche  Financing  Facility  (MFF)  0043-GEO:  Sustainable  Urban  Transport  Investment  Program’s  availability 
period expired on 18 July 2020 and project closing of all related tranches (Tranche 1 to 5) was scheduled on the 
same date. An MFF extension beyond its availability period was not considered. 
25 
the different project phases (i.e., bidding document preparation, tender, contract implementation) 
were identified. Mitigation measures are under discussion and will be finalized in the SPP and 
PPRA and to be closely monitored during project implementation. 
ADB’s latest version of standard bidding documents for goods and works and consulting 
40. 
services (2018, as amended from time to time) will be used for procurement of goods, works and 
consulting  services  depending  on  the  nature  of  different  packages.  ADB’s  SBDs  includes 
necessary provisions for using e-GP. Domestic preference will not apply. All civil works contracts 
are  based  on  conformance-based  approach,  hence  Single-Stage:  One-Envelope  bidding 
procedure shall be applied for this procurement. Standstill Period of 10 days will be applied as it 
is  currently  applied  under  other  IFIs  and  budget  funded  projects  as  well  as  based  on  the 
Government preference.  
All  civil  works  and  goods  packages  will  be  evaluated  based  on  the  lowest  evaluated 
41. 
substantially responsive bid.  
Contract management will be on collaborative basis. Contract management plans shall be 
42. 
prepared  for  each  contract.  This  should  include  risks  and  risk  management  plan,  identifying 
resources,  communication  management,  contract  administration  procedures,  quality 
management,  managing  payments,  records  management,  managing  changes,  claims  and 
disputes and finally contract closure procedures and requirements. MDF and TDF will seek ADB’s 
approval of the contract management plan and provide timely reports to ADB. 
43. 
An 18-month procurement plan indicating threshold and review procedures, goods, works, 
and consulting service contract packages and national competitive bidding guidelines is in Section 
C. 
44. 
Consulting services are required to (i) facilitate project management and implementation, 
and  (ii)  strengthen  the  institutional  and  operational  capacity  of  the  implementing  agencies. 
Consulting firms will be engaged using the quality- and cost-based selection (QCBS) method with 
a standard quality–cost ratio of 80:20. Audit firms will be engaged using request for proposals for 
non-consulting services.  The terms of reference for all consulting services are detailed in Section 
D. 
C. 
Procurement Plan 
The procurement plans will be updated by the MDF and TDF for approval by ADB, at least 
45. 
annually, and more frequently if necessary, and should cover the next 18 months of procurement 
activities. Any delay in loan effectiveness, other start-up delays, and delays during implementation 
will require an unscheduled procurement plan update. ADB will review each updated procurement 
plans prior to its publication. The estimated packages costs in the procurement plan is inclusive 
of taxes and duties. The procurement plan is attached as Appendix 1 to the PAM. 
D. 
Consultant's Terms of Reference 
46. 
The  outline  terms  of  reference  for  the  following  construction  supervision  consultant 
contracts under MDF are attached as Appendix 2A and 2B to the PAM: (i) Supervision of Civil 
Works for  Construction of  Kindergartens  and  Sport  Complexes  in  different regions  of Georgia; 
and (ii) Supervision of the Construction of the urban and tourism infrastructure across three urban 
area  clusters  -  Kakheti  region  with  Telavi  and  Gurjaani,  Samegrelo-Zemo  Svaneti  region  with 
Zugdidi  and  Mestia  as  the  regional  hubs.  The  terms  of  reference  for  construction  supervision 
26 
consultants under TDF is attached as Appendix 2C.   
VII. 
SAFEGUARDS 
In  compliance  with  ADB’s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  of  2009  (SPS),  the  project’s 
47. 
safeguards  categories  are  outlined  below.  The  TCM  will  establish  a  Grievance  Redress 
Mechanism (GRM) and appoint members of the grievance redress committee at project level by 
(30 July 2021). MDF has an established GRM functioning for previous ADB projects since 2010. 
The PMU will designate necessary staff for compliance of safeguards, implementation progress 
reporting and disclosure mechanisms.    
Environment 
48. 
The Project is categorized as B for environment under ADB Safeguard Policy Statement 
(2009). Initial environmental examinations (IEE) conducted for five sample subprojects16 indicate 
that LCIP is unlikely to have any significant adverse environmental impacts that are irreversible, 
diverse, or unprecedented. The potential impacts are site-specific, are temporary in nature, and 
can be mitigated to standard levels without difficulty through proper engineering design and the 
incorporation  or  application  of  recommended  mitigation  measures  and  procedures.  Potential 
impacts  are  due  to  construction  activities  and  are  expected  to  be  site-specific  and  temporary. 
Expected impacts include noise, dust and exhaust emissions from equipment and construction 
vehicles, impacts on the river/surface water, waste management, occupational health and safety, 
site  accessibility,  community  health  and  safety,  and  construction  traffic.  Anticipated  impacts 
during  O&M  will  be  related  to  operation  of  the  facilities  and  STPs,  repair,  and  maintenance 
activities. Potential impacts may include but not limited to odor nuisance, unsatisfactory treated 
water quality and sludge, overflow and flooding, inefficient sludge disposal, occupational health 
and  safety  risks,  exposure  to  biological  hazard  (e.g.  viruses)  and  spread  to  the  community 
(community health and safety). Provisions will be made in the design: to recirculate wastewater 
from STPs and to collect, thicken and dispose sludge. The facilities and STPs will be operated 
using the standard operating procedures following an operating manual. Thus, considering the 
design  and operational procedures that  will  be considered  in  implementation,  it  is  unlikely that 
there  will  be  any  significant  negative  impacts  due  to  O&M.  Routine  repairs  and  maintenance 
works will be very small in scale, to conducted manually by small teams and works will be very 
short thus will not cause significant physical impacts. Subprojects projected to be categorized as 
A (potential impacts are significant, irreversible, diverse, unprecedented, or larger than the sites 
or facilities subject to physical works) will not be considered for implementation under the project.  
49. 
An  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework  (EARF)  has  been  developed  in 
accordance with requirements of ADB SPS (2009), Government of Georgia environmental laws, 
rules  and  regulations.  The  EARF  will  (i)  guide  selection,  screening  and  categorization, 
environmental  assessment,  and  preparation  of  IEE  and  implementation  of  environmental 
management  plan  (EMP)  of  subsequent  subprojects;  and  (ii)  facilitate  compliance  with  the 
requirements specified in ADB SPS (2009). In addition to the subproject selection criteria in this 
PAM, the EARF includes an exclusion lists and environmental criteria to be considered during 
subproject selection to rule out potential Category A subprojects. The EARF will be reviewed from 
time  to  time  (i.e.,  ADB  review  missions)  and,  if  necessary,  updated  during  implementation 
especially if unanticipated impacts arise or if there is any change in scope or change in legal and 
16 The sample subprojects are: (i) LCIP-CW-15 Velistsikhe urban upgrade, (ii) LCIP-CW-25 Dighomi park rehabilitation, 
(iii) LCIP-CW-01 Construction of Kindergarten in Kutaisi, (iv) LCIP-CW-02 Construction of Olympic Swimming Pool 
in Kutaisi, and (v) LCIP-CW-04 Construction of Sport Complex in Zugdidi. 
regulatory  frameworks.  None  of  the  provisions  of  EARF  will  be  relaxed  or  lowered  in  the 
subsequent revisions and updates. 
27 
50. 
Subsequent subprojects are expected to be within the same range of scope, scale and 
setting as the sample subprojects, and will produce generally the same impacts at the same or 
lesser magnitude. The subprojects (sites) may be grouped together, as appropriate, into individual 
civil works procurement packages. One IEE may be prepared per procurement package subject 
to  concurrence  of  ADB.  The  draft  IEEs  will  be  included  in  the  bid  documents  and  will  be

updated/finalized  prior 
updating/finalization  of  the  IEE  will  be  brought  to  the  Contractor’s  attention  during  contract 
negotiations.  The  Contractors  will  be required  to submit  site-specific  EMPs  (SSEMPs)  to MDF 
and TDF based on the final IEEs. No works will be allowed until the SSEMPs are cleared. A copy 
of the EMP or approved SSEMP will be always kept on-site during the construction period. Non-
compliance with, or any deviation from, the conditions set out in the EMP or SSEMP constitutes 
a failure in compliance and will require corrective actions.

available,  screening  is  to  be  conducted  using  the  ADB’s  Rapid  Environmental  Assessment 
Checklist  (Appendix  4  of  the  EARF)  to  determine  the  subproject  environmental  category. 
Requirements as per the government regulations (clearances, approvals, consent etc.) shall also 
be identified at this stage, including the statutory clearance requirements. In addition to the REA, 
the  following  questionnaire  in  Table  12  will  be  used.  The  project  consultant  teams  will  include 
technical  experts  on  environment,  health  and  safety  (EHS)  biodiversity,  heritage  impact 
assessment,  and  waste  management/asbestos  management  expert  (if  there  are  ACMs  to  be 
identified) to conduct the respective required actions.

categories.  
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
Category A. A proposed project is classified as category A if it is likely to have 
significant  adverse  environmental  impacts  that  are  irreversible,  diverse,  or 
unprecedented. These impacts may affect an area larger than the sites or facilities 
subject  to  physical  works.  Category  A  subprojects  for  Environment  will  not  be 
allowed under LCIP; 
Category B. A proposed project is classified as category B if its potential adverse 
environmental impacts are less adverse than those of category A projects. These 
impacts  are  site-specific,  few  if  any  of  them  are  irreversible,  and  in most  cases 
mitigation measures can be designed more readily than for category A projects. 
An IEE is required; and 
Category C. A proposed project is classified as category C if it is likely to have 
minimal  or  no  adverse  environmental  impacts.  No  environmental  assessment  is 
required although environmental implications need to be reviewed.

Environmental  Management  Plan.  The  IEEs  of  the  sample  subprojects  include  more 
detailed  EMPs  which  describe  and  address  the  potential  impacts  and  risks  identified  by  the 
environmental assessment. The EMPs included mitigation measures, environmental monitoring 
institutional  or 
and  reporting 
organizational  arrangements,  capacity  development  and  training  measures,  implementation 
schedule,  cost  estimates,  and  performance  indicators.  Where  impacts  and  risks  cannot  be 
avoided or prevented, mitigation measures and actions will be identified so that the subproject is 
designed,  constructed,  and  operated  in  compliance  with  applicable  laws  and  regulations  and 
meets the requirements specified in the EMP. The level of detail and complexity of the EMP and 
the priority of the identified measures and actions shall be commensurate with the subproject’s 
impacts and risks. Key considerations include mitigation of potential adverse impacts to the level 
of “no significant harm to third parties,” the “polluter pays” principle, the precautionary approach, 
and adaptive management. A template for environmental management process and monitoring 
plan is provided in the EARF as a guide for preparing an EMP. 
related 
If some residual impacts are likely to remain significant after mitigation, the EMP will also 
55. 
include appropriate compensatory measures (offset) that aim to ensure that the project does not 
cause significant net degradation to the environment. Such measures may relate, for instance, to 
conservation of habitat and biodiversity, preservation of ambient conditions, and greenhouse gas 
emissions. Monetary compensation in lieu of offset is acceptable in exceptional circumstances if 
the  compensation  is  used  to  provide  environmental  benefits  of  the  same  nature  and  is 
commensurate with the project’s residual impact. 
Statutory  clearances  and  applicable  standards.  Implementation  of  LCIP  will  be 
56. 
governed  by  Government  of  Georgia  environmental  acts,  rules,  policies,  and  regulations.  All 
statutory clearances shall be obtained prior to commencement of works. The PMUs will inform 
29 
the Contractors for any environmental clearance conditions related to execution of works and will 
ensure these are considered in the SSEMPs. During the design, construction, and operation of 
the project, ADB SPS requires the PMUs to apply pollution prevention and control technologies 
and practices consistent with international good practice, as reflected in internationally recognized 
standards  such  as  the  World  Bank  Group’s  (WBG)  environment,  health,  and  safety  (EHS) 
Guidelines.  These  standards  contain  performance  levels  and  measures  that  are  normally 
acceptable  and  applicable  to  projects.  In  general,  Government  of  Georgia  standards  for 
environmental quality correspond to the WBG EHS Guidelines, however in case of differences 
more  stringent  standards  are  applicable.  The  EARF  provides  the  applicable  environmental 
standards on water quality, air quality, noise level, and vibrations. 
57. 
Environmental  Audit  of  Existing  Facilities.  For  subprojects  involving  facilities  that 
already exist or are under construction  when proposed under LCIP, environmental compliance 
audit  is  required  to  be  conducted.  The  environmental  compliance  audit  will  include  on-site 
assessment to identify (i) past or present environmental concerns,  (ii) whether actions were in 
accordance with ADB’s safeguard principles, (iii) requirements for executing and implementing 
agencies,  and  (iv)  appropriate  measures  to  address  outstanding  compliance  issues.  ADB  and 
PMUs  will  agree  on  the  corrective  action  plan  (CAP)  defining  the  necessary  remedial  actions, 
budget  for  such  actions,  and  timeframe  for  resolution  of  non-compliance.  The  environmental 
compliance  audit  report  (including  the  CAP,  if  any)  will  be  made  available  to  the  public  in 
accordance with the information disclosure requirements of ADB SPS. If a subproject involves an 
upgrade  or  expansion  of  existing  facilities  that  has  potential  impacts  on  the  environment,  the 
requirements  for  environmental  assessments  and  planning  specified  in  the  EARF  will  apply  in 
addition to the environmental compliance audit. 
58. 
Physical  Cultural  Resources  (PCR).  ADB  SPS  environmental  safeguard  policy 
principles  require  conservation  of  physical  cultural  resources  (PCRs)  and  avoid  destroying  or 
damaging them by using field-based surveys employing qualified and experienced experts during 
environmental assessment. It also emphasizes the use of chance find procedures that include a 
pre-approved  management  and  conservation  approach  for  materials  that  may  be  discovered 
during  project  implementation.  The  IEE  of  one  sample  subproject  (Package  LCIP-CW-15 
Velistsikhe urban upgrade) reports that heritage sites are present within the subproject’s indirect 
impact  zone.  MDF  confirmed  construction  works  will  not  directly  impact  the  heritage  sites, 
required heritage impact assessment (HIA) has already been conducted and reflected in the IEE 
accordingly. The subproject contractor will also be required to include a chance find procedure in 
the  SSEMP  and to  stop  works  if  materials  will  be  found  during  construction.  Per  procurement 
plan’s indicative subprojects, it is noted that Package LCIP-CW-19 Rehabilitation of Svan Towers 
in Ushguli Subproject will trigger ADB SPS requirements on PCRs due to its recognition as the 
Upper  Svaneti  UNESCO  World  Heritage  Site.  For  subsequent  subproject/towns/cities  with 
potential PCRs, a HIA is to be conducted as part of the IEE in accordance with the EARF. The 
HIA will document all PCRs, assess the potential impacts, and recommends measures to avoid 
any  negative  impact.  If  an  impact  is  unavoidable,  mitigation  measures  and/or  compensatory 
measures are to be implemented as part of the EMP. The HIA will also include the protocol and 
coordination  arrangement  with  the  regulatory  agency  (National  Agency  for  Cultural  Heritage 
Preservation) in case of chance find during execution of works. The TRTA team will engage an 
Archaeological  Expert  to  prepare  the  preliminary  HIA  for  subsequent  subprojects  which  will 
provide the requirements and costs to be included in the IEE and bid documents. MDF will also 
engage an Architect/Heritage Expert, through the Construction Supervision Consultant (CSC), to 
update the preliminary HIA based on detailed design, conduct HIAs of remaining heritage towns 
(if  any),  provide  technical  support  in  obtaining  statutory  clearances,  advise  MDF  on  matters 
related to PCRs, provide training and awareness, coordinate with the various stakeholders, review 
30 
designs/drawings from architectural and heritage perspective, promptly address any site-specific 
issues  regarding  architectural  and  heritage  aspects,  and  provide  supervisory  support  in  works 
within or adjacent to PCRs. 
Pre-  and  Post-Work  Site  Conditions.  Prior  to  commencement  of  the  work,  the 
59. 
Contractor will submit a pre-works condition information to the PMU ensuring that all identified 
pre-construction environmental impact mitigation measures will be undertaken. The Contractor 
shall reinstate all properties whether public or private which are damaged in consequence of the 
execution and maintenance of the works to a condition at least to pre-works conditions. PMUs 
will  include  post-construction  audit  reports  in  Project  Semi-annual  Progress  Report  and/or 
SAEMRs.  
Occupational  Health  and  Safety.  ADB  requires  that  the  borrowers  ensure  that  the 
60. 
workers  are  provided  with  a  safe  and  healthy  environmental,  considering  risks  inherent  to  the 
sector  and  specific  classes  of  hazards  in  the  subproject  areas  including  physical,  chemical, 
biological and radiological hazards.  
61. 
Unanticipated  Environmental  Impacts.  Where  unanticipated  environmental  impacts 
become  apparent  during  the  implementation,  the  PMUs  shall  update  the  IEEs  and  EMPs  to 
assess  the  potential  impacts,  evaluate  the  alternatives  and  outline  mitigation  measures  and 
resources to address those impacts. 
Consultation  and  Participation.  Meaningful  consultation17  shall  be  carried  out  with 
62. 
affected  people  and  other  concerned  stakeholders  including  civil  society  and  facilitate  their 
informed  participation.  The  consultation  process  and  its  results  are  to  be  documented  and 
reflected in the IEEs and semi-annual environmental monitoring report (SAEMR).  
63. 
Grievance  Redress  Mechanism.  The  PMUs  have  established  the  grievance  redress 
mechanism (GRM) to receive and facilitate resolution of affected people’s concerns, complaints 
and grievances about the project and its subprojects environmental performance. The grievance 
mechanism shall be scaled to the risks and adverse impacts of the subproject. The Contractors 
will  be  required  to  assist  in  receiving,  recording,  and  coordinating  with  PMUs  on  field-level 
complaints/grievances.  The  detailed  project-level  GRM  is  included  in  the  EARF  and  may  be 
tailored  to  consider  contractor’s  roles  and  subproject-specific  on-site  conditions.  The  IEEs  will 
include subproject-specific GRM. 
Public  Disclosure.  The  IEEs,  EDDRs,  SAEMRs,  post-construction  audit  reports  and 
64. 
CAPs  will  be  posted  on  PMUs  and  ADB  websites.  Relevant  information  will  be  disclosed  in 
accessible manner in local communities. 
Implementation Arrangement. The EARF specify detailed responsibilities of the PMUs, 
65. 
project  consultants  and  contractors  in  relation  to  the  preparation,  submission,  review  and 
clearance  of  IEEs,  implementation  of  mitigation  and  monitoring  measures  during  design, 
construction,  and  if  applicable,  O&M  phases,  and  over-all  compliance  with  ADB  SPS  and 
17 Per ADB SPS, meaningful consultation is defined as “a process that (i) begins early in the project preparation stage 
and is carried out on an ongoing basis throughout the project cycle; (ii) provides timely disclosure of relevant and 
adequate  information  that  is  understandable  and  readily  accessible  to  affected  people;  (iii)  is  undertaken  in  an 
atmosphere  free  of intimidation  or  coercion;  (iv)  is  gender  inclusive  and  responsive,  and tailored  to  the  needs of 
disadvantaged and vulnerable groups; and (v) enables the incorporation of all relevant views of affected people and 
other stakeholders into decision making, such as project design, mitigation measures, the sharing of development 
benefits and opportunities, and implementation issues” 
government laws, rules and regulations. The EARF includes indicative safeguards trainings and 
awareness workshops with the primary focus of enabling the PMUs’ staff to understand impact 
assessments  and  carry  out  environmental  monitoring  and  implement  EMPs.  Specific  modules 
customized for the available skill set will be devised after assessing the capabilities of the target 
participants and the requirements of the project.

Potential impacts of climate change and natural hazards (floods, earthquakes) have been 
71. 
considered during preparation of the Climate Risk and Vulnerability Assessment (CRVA) report 
for  areas  including  the  locations  of  proposed  projects  and  their  surroundings.  Elaborated 
recommendations for siting and design of the projects will be part of the EMPs. 
Land Acquisition and Resettlement 
72. 
The Project is categorized as B for resettlement under ADB Safeguard Policy Statement 
(2009),  due  the  anticipated  certain  economic  displacements  (loss  of  land,  permanently  or 
hindered access to land/assets).  A land acquisition and resettlement framework (LARF) has been 
developed in accordance with the requirements of ADB SPS and local rules and regulations. The 
LARF will (i) guide selection, screening and categorization, impact assessment, and preparation 
and implementation of social safeguards requirements for each subproject to be prepared after 
ADB Board approval; and (ii) facilitate compliance with the requirements specified in ADB SPS. 
The LARF will be updated if necessary, during implementation especially if unanticipated impacts 
arise or if there is any change in scope or change in legal and regulatory frameworks. None of 
the  provisions  of  LARF  will  be  lowered  in  the  subsequent  revisions  and  updates.  Subproject 
selection  criteria  will  avoid  subprojects  with  significant  involuntary  resettlement  (IR)  impacts 
(Category  A).  A  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plan  (LARP)  will  be  prepared  for  each 
18 Reasonable  size  social  outreach  team  (SOT)  to  be  appointed  by  contractor  to  facilitate  community  liaison, 
consultations and R&R implementation (including resolution of grievances). Requirement of SOT will be included in 
bid document. 
34 
subproject with IR impacts while a social safeguards due diligence report (SDDR) will be prepared 
if a subproject is not likely to have IR impacts. 
73. 
Sample  subprojects  and  prepared  safeguards  documents.  Social  safeguards  due 
diligence conducted for five sample subprojects. The SDDRs have been prepared for the regional 
subprojects (kindergartens and sport complexes), while implementation-ready LARPs have been 
prepared for Velistsikhe and Mestia subprojects in accordance with the LARF and ADB SPS. The 
draft LARP has been prepared for Dighomi Park subproject in Tbilisi  subject to update into an 
implementation-ready status upon finalization of public consultations and proposed compensation 
and  livelihood  restoration  options.  Prepared  SDDRs  and  LARPs  can  be  used  as  model 
documents  for  subsequent  subprojects.  The  subprojects  (sites)  may  be  grouped  together,  as 
appropriate, into individual civil works procurement packages. One SDDR/LARP may be prepared 
per procurement package subject to concurrence of ADB.  
74. 
According  to  the  impact  assessment  results,  IR  impacts  for  regional  subprojects  in 
Velistsikhe  and  Mestia  are  likely  to  be  of  temporary  in  nature  (temporary  resettlement  from 
residence and temporary business suspension). In total, 31 affected businesses and lessors will 
be suspended temporarily during project implementation phase (5 businesses in Mestia, and 20 
businesses and 6 lessors in Velistsikhe) 11 affected persons temporarily losing jobs (all of them 
in Velistsikhe).  In total, there will be 42 affected households (AHs) subject to temporary relocation 
(including  17  vulnerable)  in  Mestia  and  14  AHs  (including  2  vulnerable)  in  Velistsikhe.  The 
compensation  for temporarily  relocation  and affected  assets  were calculated  and budgeted  as 
part of LARPs.  
Based  on  impact  assessment  the  Dighomi  Park  subproject  in  Tbilisi,  this  will  involve 
75. 
involuntary  resettlement  (IR)  impact  due  to  informal  use  of  municipal  land  due  to  illegally 
constructed  structures  and  fences  identified  within  the  subproject  area.  Furthermore,  the 
structures were found to be used as small farms for cows and pigs by internally displaced persons 
(IDP) living nearby. Within the preparation of draft LARP, TDF and the TRTA team  (i) conducted 
full  IR  impact  assessment  covering  the  subproject’s  boundaries;  (ii)  conducted  detailed 
measurement survey, census,  socio-economic survey with affected households (AH) and focus 
group discussions (FGD) with IDPs and other vulnerable AHs; (iii) initiated relevant mechanisms 
of  cut-off  date  establishment  and thereof  disclosure  and  dissemination  to  project  stakeholders 
(including  AHs);  and  (iv)  conducted  valuation  of  all  structures  and  other  assets    by  qualified 
valuator  at  replacement  cost  as  per  ADB  SPS.  The  draft  LARP  is  subject  to  update  into  an 
implementation ready status upon completion of following actions by TDF with support of TRTA 
team: (i) conduct meaningful public consultations with stakeholders and AHs, including targeted 
consultations with vulnerable AHs, and (ii) consult and agree with AHs on relevant compensation 
and livelihood restoration options proposed as a result of FGDs. 
LAR financing. IR costs for all subprojects (both for MDF and TDF) will be covered by 
76. 
state budget, ADB loan financing is not anticipated to be used for LAR costs.  
77. 
Consultation  and  Participation.  Meaningful  consultation  shall  be  carried  out  with 
affected  people  and  other  concerned  stakeholders  including  civil  society  and  facilitate  their 
informed  participation.  The  consultation  process  and  its  results  are  to  be  documented  and 
reflected in the LARPs/SDDRs and semi-annual social monitoring report (SSMR).   
Grievance  Redress  Mechanism.  The  PMUs  have  established  the  grievance  redress 
78. 
mechanism (GRM) to receive and facilitate resolution of affected people’s concerns, complaints 
and grievances about the project and its subprojects environmental performance. The grievance 
35 
mechanism shall be scaled to the risks and adverse impacts of the subproject. The Contractors 
will  be  required  to  assist  in  receiving,  recording,  and  coordinating  with  PMUs  on  field-level 
complaints/grievances.  The  detailed  project-level  GRM

on PMUs and ADB websites. Relevant information will be disclosed in accessible manner in local 
communities. 
80. 
Implementation  Arrangements.    The  LARF  specifies  detailed  responsibilities  of  the 
PMUs, project consultants and contractors in relation to the preparation, submission, review and 
clearance  of  LARPs/SDDRs,  implementation  of  mitigation  and  monitoring  measures  during 
design,  construction,  and  over-all  compliance  with  ADB  SPS  and  government  laws,  rules  and 
regulations. The LARF includes indicative safeguards trainings and awareness workshops with 
the primary focus of enabling the PMUs’ staff to understand impact assessments and carry out 
IR  monitoring  and  implement  LARPs.  The  PMUs  within  MDF  and  TDF  will  be  responsible  for 
overall land acquisition and resettlement (LAR) management under the project, implementation 
of  LARPs  and  SDDRs,  and  compliance  with  ADB’s  safeguards  requirements  and  national 
regulations.  
81. 
Each PMU has appointed a Social Safeguards and Resettlement Officer who will: 
•  Review IR checklists and assign categorization based on ADB SPS 2009 and LARF;  
•  Submit LARP/SDDR to ADB for approval and disclosure in ADB website;  
•  Ensure LARPs/SDDRs are updated/revised based on detailed engineering design (DED) 
and recommendations of technical studies;  
•  Ensure approved LARPs/SDDRs are disclosed in PMU websites and relevant information

wherein  gender  design  features  and  targets  will  be  incorporated  in  project’s  operations  and 
investments. 
86. 
Key  issues.  The  issue  of  Gender  Mainstreaming  in  Urban  and  Infrastructure  Project 
Planning  was  present  in  the  regions19  covered  by  the  planned  projects.  During  the  process  of 
urban infrastructure planning in urban and rural areas the communities, especially women are not 
consulted,  as  a  result  of  which  planned  infrastructure  projects  often  do  not  meet  the  needs  of 
women/girls. From the 96 kindergartens planned by the project only 14.5% are adapted for people 
with  disabilities.  There  are  children  between  2  to  6  years  5,545  girls  (48.9%),  5,783  boys 
(51.1%).20 The total number of kindergarten places provided by the project is 3070, which is less 
than  the  demand  (number  of  children  of  kindergarten  age-3764).  It  should  be  mentioned  the 
infrastructural condition of the buildings of pre-school and educational institutions, including the 
issue of adapting the physical environment to the needs of persons with disabilities and providing 
sanitary facilities to ensure proper hygiene. Also, lack of gender sensitivity of kindergarten staff. 
87. 
Gender  issues.  Urban  planning  covers  a  wide  spectrum  of  concerns  including 
employment, housing, access to public space, transport and environment. Gender is relevant to 
all of these. During the planning process women are hardly consulted and as a result infrastructure 
projects  often  do  not  meet  the  needs  of  women  and  girls.  It  is  therefore  important  to  have  a 
gender-sensitive  approach  to  address  the  specific  needs  of  different  social  groups,  including 
persons with disabilities. 
Access to internet. By 2020 more than 20% of the Georgian population was still without 
88. 
internet. According to the National Communications Commission Georgia has 915,636 internet 
subscribers  with  quite some  differences from  region  to region.  The lowest rates  are in  Racha-
Lechkhumi and Lower Svaneti as well as in Guria and Kakheti. Only 62% of the households are 
provided with computers with a huge difference between urban and rural areas. Tbilisi shows the 
highest rate of provision, the lowest is in Kakheti. An important difference can also be recognized 
between women and men – 58.9% women and 63.1% men use computers. The highest rate of 
users are citizens between 15 and 29 years. 
89. 
It should be mentioned that a Gender Equality Council has been established in Tbilisi. The 
Municipality  of  Tbilisi  has  approved the Gender Equality  Action  Plan for 2018  –  2020  which is 
19 The regions covered under the project ‘’Geo Livable Cities Investment Project for Balanced Regional Development’’ 
cover Tbilisi, Imereti, Guria, Kakheti, Kvemo Kartli, Shida Kartli, Samtskhke-Javakheti and Samegreo-Zemo Svaneti 
region.

currently renewed although it is to be mentioned that the respective process has been delayed 
due to the ongoing COVID19 situation.

Access to sports for women is limited primarily to the stereotypical attitudes of women 
and  men  into  sports  in  society.  This  is  due  to  insufficient  sports  infrastructure,  accessibility  in 
terms  of  fees  and  existing  gender  stereotypes  according to which  female and male sports  are 
segregated in society. The above-mentioned opinions are reinforced by the data related to several 
projects’ locations: There are 13 sports schools in Kutaisi, where there are 32 sports circles. The 
number of young boys involved is almost 4 times higher than the number of girls: 20% - girls, 80% 
- boys (792 girls - 3217 boys); There are 13 sports circles in Akhaltsikhe, where from persons 
involved 92% are boys and 8% are girls (372 boys and 33 girls). The boys are mostly involved in 
almost all existing circles. As for the girls, in Kutaisi girls are involved only in 21 out of 32 sports 
circles. In Akhaltsikhe in 4 out of 13.21  
91. 
Economically active men in urban settlements -66.8%, women -47.1%. 79.6% of men 
and 65.1% of women are economically active in rural areas.22 Women dominate among the self-
employed  and  are  employed  in  households,  have  their  own  handicrafts  and  involved  in family 
business/family hotels. During the Covid-19 pandemic, in April-June, the number of unemployed 
people in Georgia increased by 15,600 and 89% of the unemployed are women. The COVID-19 
pandemic has caused even more harm to women engaged in small business or retail and has 
importantly slowed down the process the tourism sector. Most of women entrepreneur’s activities 
are suspended, and in many cases, this is due to the inability to repay loans and sell products 
which are related to insufficient knowledge of tailoring services to existing challenges (e.g. online 
sales) and the availability of well-equipped, -safe spaces for women in tourist areas that will help 
them sell products.23 
92. 
Key actions.  In order to address gender concerns, the project will include the following 
key  actions:  (i)  introducing  gender-sensitive  urban  planning  design  and  guidelines  for  urban 
projects  of  the  proposed  program;  (ii)  awareness-raising  of  users  of  the  urban  services 
(kindergarten,  library,  sports  complexes)  on  the  issues  of  violence  against  women,  healthy 
lifestyle, safe mobility and related issues; (iii) capacity-building and awareness-raising of urban 
planners  and  municipality  representatives;  (iv)  introducing  gender  in  increasing  of  institutional 
effectiveness of the implementing agencies; (v) ensuring gender-mainstreaming in urban planning 
and infrastructure projects of Tbilisi Municipality; (vi) supporting women entrepreneurs; and (vii) 
reflecting project needs in local gender policy and institutions. Classified as EGM, the project will 
hire a gender specialist to ensure implementation of the gender action plan. The gender action 
plan is provided below in Table 13.

to those included in the LCIP DMF. The baseline data corresponding to indicators and targets set 
out in the DMF and the monitoring and evaluation framework could be generated through primary 
data, collected while preparing the detailed project reports and further through the data collected 
by construction supervision consultants. Such baseline data, disaggregated by income levels and 
sex, should be established within 12 months of loan effectiveness. After establishing the baseline, 
the PMUs will prepare annual, mid-term and end of the project monitoring reports using the same 
indicators and submit the reports to ADB. 
95. 
Compliance monitoring. The PMC, supervision and governance and capacity building 
consultants will support the PMUs in monitoring performance based on the DMF, monitoring and 
evaluation framework and their respective PPMS. The PMUs will prepare a semi-annual progress 
report, which among other items will include compliance of implementation with: (i) assurances, 
covenants, conditions; (ii) safeguards; (iii) GAP; (iv) community awareness and participation plan 
(CAPP); and (v) reforms. 
96. 
Safeguards’  monitoring.  Each  PMU  will  be  responsible  for  overall  compliance  with 
ADB’s safeguard requirements and national environmental regulations. The IAs (MDF and TDF) 
will ensure that the preparation, design, construction, implementation, and if applicable, operation 
and  decommissioning  of  the  subprojects  and  all  project  facilities  comply  with  (i)  all  applicable 
national laws and regulations relating to environment, health and safety; (ii) the Environmental 
Safeguards; and (iii) all measures, and requirements set forth in the  EARF and IEEs, and any 
corrective  or  preventive  actions  set  forth  in  the  safeguards  monitoring  reports.  The  IAs  will 
facilitate  coordination  with  the  project  consultants  and  Contractors  in  ensuring  the  proper 
implementation of safeguards and SSEMPs to avoid any adverse impacts. 
The status of the implementation of the IEE/EMP and LARP/SDDR will be discussed at 
97. 
each ADB review mission and integrated into semi-annual reports for IEE/EMP and LARP/SDDR 
implementation using the integrated safeguards monitoring format. These will be prepared by the 
46 
respective EAs with assistance from safeguard specialists of LCIP consultants and safeguards 
officers  in  PMU,  based  on  the  information  provided  by  IAs,  contractors  and  community  liaison 
staff,  where  relevant.  The  EAs  will  submit  semi-annual  monitoring  reports  (ESMR)  and  social 
safeguards  semi-annual  monitoring  reports  (SSMR)  in  the  standard  templates  advised  by  the 
ADB  to  ADB,  within  30  days  of  the  end  of  reporting  period,  for  review  and  disclosure.  The 
safeguards monitoring team structure and responsibilities are summarized in table below.

98. 
Safeguards  monitoring  –  Environment.  Each  PMU  will  monitor  and  measure  the 
progress of EMPs and SSEMPs implementation. The monitoring activities will correspond with 
the subproject’s risks and impacts. In addition to recording information on the work and deviation 
of work components from original scope, the PMUs and project consultants  will undertake site 
inspections and document review to verify compliance with the loan assurances, EMPs, SSEMPs, 
technical studies and CAPs, if any. 
99. 
Prior  to  commencement  of  the  work,  the  Contractor  will  submit  a  pre-works  condition 
information and SSEMP to the PMU ensuring that all identified pre-construction environmental 
impact  mitigation  measures  will  be  undertaken.  The  PMU  Environment  Officer,  with  the 
assistance of the CSC Environment Specialist will review the pre-works information and SSEMP, 
conduct  site  verification,  and  thereafter  PMU  will  allow  commencement  of  works.  During 
construction, results from internal monitoring by the Contractor will be reflected in the Contractor’s 
Monthly  Report  to  be  submitted  to  the  PMU  and  CSC  Environment  Specialist.  The  PMU 
Environment  Officer  and  CSC  Environment  Specialist  will  review  the  Contractor’s  Report, 
undertake site verifications, and advise contractors for corrective actions if necessary. 
100.  Semi-annual  progress  report  shall  be  prepared  by  CSC  Environment  Specialist  to  be 
submitted to the respective PMUs for review and further actions. The PMU Environment Specialist 
will review and prepare the project’s safeguards compliance status to be included in the Project’s 
Semi-Annual Progress Report. A suggested checklist in included as Appendix 7 of the EARF to 
ensure completeness of safeguards requirements.  
101.  Based  on  monthly  and  semi-annual  reports  and  measurements,  the  CSC  Environment 
Specialist will draft SAEMRs and submit to respective PMU for review, concurrence of the findings 
and recommendations, and further submission to ADB. The suggested SAEMR outline is included 
as Appendix 8 of the EARF. Each PMU will submit SAEMRs to ADB within 30 days of the end of 
reporting  period.  The  SAEMR  covering  January  to  June  will  be  due  by  30  July,  and  SAEMR 
covering July to December will be due by 30 January. Once concurrence from the ADB is received 
the SAEMRs will be disclosed in the project website. 
102.  ADB will review project performance against the Government of Georgia commitments as 
47 
agreed in the legal documents. The extent of ADB's monitoring and supervision activities will be 
commensurate  with  the  project’s  risks  and  impacts.  Monitoring  and  supervising  of  social  and 
environmental safeguards will be integrated into the project performance management system. 
ADB will monitor projects on an ongoing basis until a project completion report is issued. ADB will 
carry out the following monitoring actions to supervise project implementation: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
(v) 
conduct periodic site visits for projects; 
conduct  supervision  missions  with  detailed  review  by  ADB’s  Safeguard 
Specialists, Safeguard Officers or consultants for projects with significant adverse 
social or environmental impacts; 
review the periodic monitoring reports submitted by EAs and PMUs to ensure that 
adverse impacts and risks are mitigated, as planned and agreed with ADB; 
work with the EAs and PMUs to rectify to the extent possible any failures to comply 
with  their  safeguard  commitments,  as  covenanted  in  the  legal  agreements,  and 
exercise remedies to re-establish compliance as appropriate; and 
prepare  a  project  completion  report  that  assesses  whether  the  objective  and 
desired  outcomes  of  the  safeguard  plans  have  been  achieved,  considering  the 
baseline conditions and the results of monitoring. 
103.  ADB’s  monitoring  and supervision  activities  are carried out  on an  ongoing  basis  until  a 
Project  Completion  Report  is  issued.  Thus,  SAEMRs  which  may  cover  O&M  of  completed 
packages, will be submitted to ADB until PCR is issued. ADB issues a PCR within 1 to 2 years 
after the project is physically completed and in operation. 
104.  Safeguards  monitoring  –  Resettlement.  Each  PMU  will  monitor  and  measure  the 
progress of LARPs and SDDRs implementation. The monitoring activities will correspond with the 
subproject’s risks and impacts. In addition to recording information on the work and deviation of 
work  components  from  original  scope,  the  PMUs  and  project  consultants  will  undertake  site 
inspections and document review to verify compliance with the loan assurances, LARPs/SDDRs 
and CAPs, if any. Monitoring of each project specific LARP will be undertaken by PMU through 
construction supervision consultants. Consultants and/or officers of PMU will provide on-the-job 
training  and  backstopping  for  the  construction  supervision  teams,  as  required.  The  social 
safeguards consultants and/or officers of PMU will (i) provide inputs to semi-annual and annual 
progress reports detailing the progress in implementation of the LARPs, (ii) prepare and submit 
to ADB semi-annual Social Safeguards Reports.  
105.  The implementation and effectiveness of the LARPs will be monitored internally by PUMs 
with  support  of  consultants.    In  particular,  the  PMUs  with  assistance  from  the  consultants  will 
supervise and manage monitoring of resettlement activities and implementation arrangements. 
106.  The PMU through the EA will provide semi-annual reports to the ADB. They will ensure 
the EA that the consultants reports include progress and status reports, information on location 
and numbers of people affected, compensation amounts paid by item, and assistance provided 
to displaced people. The ADB will also monitor these activities in its regular supervision missions 
during the period of project implementation. 
107.  The objectives of the monitoring and evaluation program are to (i) ensure that the standard 
of living of affected households are restored or improved, (ii) monitor whether or not the timelines 
are being met, (iii) to identify problems or potential problems, and (iv) to ensure that the GRM is 
functioning and grievances, if any, are being addressed timely and effectively. 
108.  The principal indicators for internal monitoring of resettlement activities include: 
48 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
(v) 
Timely and complete disbursement of compensation to AHs according to the 
compensation policy agreed in the RP; 
Timely and complete delivery of relocation, income restoration (when available) 
and rehabilitation allowances and measures; 
Public information dissemination and consultation procedures; 
Adherence to grievance procedures and identification of outstanding issues that 
require further attention and resolution; 
Attention given to grievances of affected persons regarding the options offered 
and the priorities of AHs regarding the options offered. 
109.  Completion of resettlement activities certified by Compliance Report is required before the 
start of civil works. ADB will monitor projects on an ongoing basis until a project completion report 
is issued. ADB’s monitoring and supervision activities are carried out on an ongoing basis until a 
Project Completion Report is issued. 
110.  Gender and Social Dimensions Monitoring. Status of the implementation of the GAP 
action plan and the CAPP will be discussed at each ADB review mission. The GAP monitoring 
matrix with updated data on progress will be included with semi-annual progress reports. 
111.  The monitoring of impacts on the social and gender aspects, including social and gender 
benefit  monitoring,  will  be  incorporated  into  the  overall  program  monitoring  and  evaluation. 
Assisted  by  the  social  and  gender  specialists  in  the  consultant  team,  the  PMU/PIUs  will  be 
responsible  for  analyzing  and  consolidating  the  performance  data.  The  social  and  gender 
monitoring will be designed to allow adequate flexibility to adopt remedial actions regarding the 
project design, schedules, activities, and development impact. Specific indicators in the SPRSS 
and  the  GAP  will  be  further  elaborated  during  the  detailed  design  phase.  Semi-annual  GAP 
monitoring will be carried out in accordance with ADB GAP Progress Report template. 
C. 
Evaluation 
112.  ADB  provides  financing  for  projects  that  will  effectively  contribute  to  the  economic  and 
social development of the country concerned and have the strongest poverty reduction impact in 
conformity with the country and ADB strategies. The government and ADB will jointly review the 
project  at  least  twice  a year.  This  includes:  (i)  the  performance  of  the  PMUs,  consultants  and 
contractors;  (ii)  physical  progress  of  projects  and  effectiveness  of  safeguards,  CAPP  and  the 
action plan; (iii) inclusion of women and vulnerable groups, including the poor, in project planning

115.  Midterm Review Mission. ADB will conduct a midterm review in the fourth year of LCIP 
implementation. The midterm review will (i) assess the program performance and achievement 
against  targets  and  milestones;  (ii)  review  the  initial  outcomes,  benefits,  and  impact  of  the 
program,  and  (iii)  identify  gaps,  if  any,  and  recommend  necessary  changes  to  strengthen 
implementation arrangements or modify program design. 
116.  Project  Completion  Review  Mission.  ADB  will  conduct  program  completion  review 
mission upon physical completion of the program to commence preparation of ADB’s program 
completion report (PCR). The mission will (i) assess the program performance against all targets, 
indicators,  and  benchmarks  (including  any  revised  at  the  midterm  review);  (ii)  evaluate  initial 
benefits, and outcome of the program across outputs; and (iii) identify any incomplete activities 
and agree on the necessary actions. 
117.  Project  completion  report.  The  PMUs  will  submit  to  the  ADB,  within  6  months  of  the 
completion of the project, a project completion report that will cover the details of implementation 
(including  changes  in  scope),  costs,  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  activities,  problems 
encountered,  actions  taken,  and  other  information  requested  by  ADB  and  implementing 
agencies.24 
D.

118.  The  PMUs  under  each  IA  will  provide  ADB  with:  (i)  semi-annual  progress  reports  in  a 
format consistent with the ADB's project performance reporting system; (ii) consolidated annual 
reports  including  (a)  progress  achieved  by  output  as  measured  through  the  indicator's 
performance targets, (b) key implementation issues and solutions, (c) updated procurement plan, 
and (d) updated implementation plan for the next 12 months; and (iii) a project completion report 
within 6 months of physical completion of the project. To ensure that projects will continue to be 
both viable and sustainable, project accounts and the audited financial statements together with 
the associated auditor's report, should be adequately reviewed. 
E. 
Stakeholder Communication Strategy  
119.  A stakeholder communication strategy is conducted in line with ADB's Access Information 
Policy,  2018,  which  supports  proactive  disclosure,  external  relations  and  improved  access  to 
information  about  ADB  operations  for  better  development  effectiveness.  The  policy  promotes 
greater transparency and accountability by enabling ADB's stakeholders and especially people 
24    Project  completion  report  format  is  available  at:  http://www.adb.org/Consulting/consultants-toolkits/PCR-Public-  
Sector-Landscape.rar 
50 
affected by development activities to better participate in the decisions that affect them. It also 
recognizes the right of people to seek, receive, and impart information about ADB’s operations. 
120.  The  project  Stakeholders  have  been  identified  based  on  the  Stakeholder  mapping  and 
analysis, media mapping, consultations and information gathered through meetings, workshops, 
conversations with workshop participants and review of websites. 
121. 
Information on LARP entitlements has been and will be shared at the village level through 
consultation meetings and through public consultation during the public hearings. The impacted 
residents have been and will be closely involved through additional stakeholder consultations as 
reflected in SDDRs and LARPs prepared. Where necessary, MDF/TDF and TRTA consultants 
will  conduct  additional  social  surveys/consultations  under  the  resettlement  and  environmental 
safeguards.  Grievance  mechanism  (GRM)  has  been  established  to  receive  and  re-dress 
complaints, including those from the poor. 
122.  At design stage, MDF/TDF safeguard team is the focal point for communication with other 
stakeholders  and  regular  contact  with  project-affected  people.  MDF/TDF  is  responsible  for 
implementing  and  monitoring  disclosure  and  dissemination  of  Project-related  information. 
MDF/TDF  will  further  extend  the  current  mechanisms  for  feedback  (during  design  and 
implementation  (GRM,  public  consultations,  brochure,  MDF/TDF  website,  press  releases).  All 
communications will be made in Georgian language and contact details of MDF/TDF’s focal point 
will  systematically  be  disseminated  to  stakeholders  through  relevant  communication  channels. 
During construction stage, in addition to the timely disclosure of Project information as per ADB 
requirements  (safeguards,  procurement,  monitoring  reports,  etc.),  MDF/TDF  will  ensure  the 
following activities are performed: 
(i)  Information dissemination and meeting/consultation with households of subproject areas 
held at least semi-annually. Disclosure of information meetings reports (including minutes 
of questions and answers) on MDF/TDF website; 
(ii)  Distribution  of  information  on  design  and  work  progress,  to  households  of  subproject 
areas, at least semi-annually;  
(iii) Disclosure of brochures (if any) on MDF/TDF website; and 
(iv) Communicate  on  subprojects’  design  and  work  progress  (via  different  communication 
channels acceptable and accessible for stakeholders) at least quarterly.

ANTICORRUPTION POLICY 
124.  ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any violations of the 
Anticorruption  Policy  relating  to  the  project.25  All  contracts  financed  by  ADB  shall  include 
provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the 
executing agency and all project contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers. 
Individuals and/or entities on ADB’s anticorruption debarment list are ineligible to participate in 
ADB-financed, -administered, -supported activities and may not be awarded any contracts under 
25 Anticorruption Policy: https://www.adb.org/documents/anticorruption-policy 
52 
the project.26 
125. 
 To support these efforts, relevant provisions are included in the loan agreement and the 
bidding documents for the project. All contracts financed by ADB in connection with the project 
will include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts 
of the PMU contractors, suppliers, consultants and other service providers as they relate to the 
project. ADB will disseminate ADB’s Anticorruption Policy to EAs and IAs. 
126.  Georgia’s anticorruption regulatory framework is outlined in the 2009 Law of Georgia on 
the Conflict of Interests and Corruption in Public Service. Since 2012, the government improved 
accountability and transparency in public finance, procurement, and private sector oversight. Low-
level  corruption  in  the  public  sector  is  virtually  eradicated.  Georgia  ranked  41st  (out  of  180 
countries) and scored 58 (out of 100) in the 2018 corruption perception index of Transparency 
International, implying the scope for further improvement in governance. The legal provisions on 
corruption offences are overall deemed to be in line with international standards. Corruption in 
Georgia particularly high-level corruption by public officials continues to be seen as a problem, 
and  legal  enforcement  in  the  judiciary  and  in  public  procurement  is  deemed  deficient. 
Transparency  International’s  Corruption  Perception  index  for  the  last  five  years  and  increased 
from 52 in 2015 to 56 in 2020. The World Bank’s Worldwide Governance Indicators assessed the 
Control of Corruption indicator at 74.04 in 2019 demonstrating a decline from 77.40 in 2017. 
127.  A  summary  of  the  corruption  risk  assessment  findings  and  mitigation  measures  are

128. 
Integrity due diligence was conducted on MDF and TDF, the members of the Supervisory 
Boards and management. They do not appear to constitute a significant or potentially significant 
integrity risk since no adverse media or other relevant information related to them exists. ADB 
has obtained reasonable assurance that MDF and TDF was not established and is not being used 
for money laundering or terrorism financing in the project jurisdiction. ADB’s Anticorruption Policy 
(1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government and the MRDI 
and TCM. 
129.  ADB’s Anticorruption Policy designates the Office of Anticorruption and Integrity (OAI) as 
the point of contract to report allegations of fraud or corruption among by ADB-financed projects 
or its staff. OAI is responsible for all matters related to allegations of fraud and corruption. For a 
more  detailed  explanation  refer  to  the  Anticorruption  Policy  and  Procedures.  Anyone  coming 
across the evidence of corruption associated with the project may contact the Anticorruption Unit

ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISM 
130.  People who  are,  or may  in the  future  be,  adversely  affected  by the  project  may  submit 
complaints  to  ADB’s  Accountability  Mechanism.  The  Accountability  Mechanism  provides  an 
independent forum and process whereby people adversely affected by ADB-assisted projects can 
voice,  and  seek  a  resolution  of  their  problems,  as  well  as  report  alleged  violations  of  ADB’s 
operational  policies  and  procedures.  Before  submitting  a  complaint  to  the  Accountability 
Mechanism, affected people should make an effort in good faith to solve their problems by working 
with  the  concerned  ADB  operations  department.  Only  after  doing  that,  and  if  they  are  still 
dissatisfied, should they approach the Accountability Mechanism.27

4. 
agreed with ADB. 
A. 
Prequalification 
5. 
The Works and Goods contracts intended to be procured are standard works/goods where 
pre-qualification  process  will  not  add  any  value  rather  will  increase  the  procurement  time. 
Therefore, MDF shall procured Works and Goods without pre-qualification arrangements. 
B. 
Bidding Procedures 
All civil works contracts are based on conformance-based approach, hence Single-Stage: 
6. 
One-Envelope bidding procedure shall be applied for this procurement.   
C. 
Specifications 
7. 
The technical specifications and detailed drawings, included in the bidding documents for 
civil works contracts for kindergartens and sport facilities construction, are to be duly elaborated 
by the detailed design firm.  
D. 
Review Requirements 
Under the MDF scope, the first package for each type of civil works (kindergarten, sport 
8. 
complex, urban upgrading) and goods packages subject to advance contracting and retroactive 
financing will be subject to ADB’s prior review, while the succeeding packages will be subject to 
ADB’s  post  review  (sampling)  as  per  the  procurement  plan  except  for  the  Urban  Upgrade  of 
Mestia-Laghami  and  Rehabilitation  of  Svan  Towers  in  Ushguli  packages  which  will  remain  for 
ADB’s prior review. All contracts for consulting and non-consulting services are subject to ADB’s 
prior review procedure. The decision is made based on the simple and repetitive nature of civil 
works and goods supply contracts, as well as based on the market analysis, extensive experience 
of MDF in IFIs projects implementation. The post review (sampling) will be conducted during each 
loan review mission and may also be additionally conducted by request. The accumulated number 
of  all  contract  awards for  works  and  goods  will  be sent  to  ADB  each  quarter together  with the 
evaluation reports. 
Based on the lack of experience of TDF in IFIs projects implementation, all contracts for 
9. 
civil works, goods and consulting services shall be subject to ADB’s prior review. 
Appendix 1  
79 
E. 
Standstill Period

12. 
be calculated based on the detailed Bill of Quantities presented in the bidding documents.  
H. 
Key Performance Indicators 
13. 
KPIs will not apply for conformance based civil works contracts. However, the MDF and 
TDF will monitor each contract on the contractor’s performance during contract implementation.  
I. 
Evaluation Method 
14. 
All  civil  works  and  goods  contracts  will  be  evaluated  based  on  the  qualification  and 
experience requirements of the bidding documents and contracts will be awarded to the lowest 
evaluated  substantially  responsive  bidder.  Recruitment  of  consulting  firm  for  construction 
supervision services will use QCBS with quality and cost ration of 80:20 and STP proposal will be 
required. 
J. 
Contract Management Approach 
15. 
Contract management will be on collaborative basis. Contract management plans shall be 
prepared  for  each  civil  works  contract.  They  should  include  risks  and  risk  management  plan, 
identifying resources, communication management, contract administration procedures, quality 
management,  managing  payments,  records  management,  managing  changes,  claims  and 
disputes and finally contract closure procedures and requirements.  The contract management 
plan  should  be  prepared  before  signing  of  each  contract.  The  updated  contract  management 
reports should be submitted to ADB Loan Review Mission.

APPENDIX 2A: TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR SUPERVISION OF CIVIL WORKS UNDER 
THE PROJECT – CONSTRUCTION OF KINDERGARTENS AND SPORT COMPLEXES IN 
DIFFERENT REGIONS OF GEORGIA  
A. 
1. 
Background and Objective 
Background 
Municipal Development Fund of Georgia was established in 1997. The fund is cooperating 
1. 
with all large investment banks and financial institutions operating in Georgia. It is coordinated by 
the  Supervisory  Board  approved  by  the  Government  of  Georgia  and  Ministry  of  Regional 
Development and Infrastructure of Georgia. Municipal Development Fund of Georgia (MDF) is a 
Legal  Entity  under  Public  Law  (LEPL)  with  the  objective  of  assisting  to  enhancement  of 
institutional and financial capacities of local self-governmental bodies, making investments in local 
infrastructure and services, and improvement of main economic and social conditions for the local 
population. MDF implements significant infrastructural projects such as: urban renovation of the 
cities, arrangement of tourist infrastructure near cultural heritage monuments, construction and 
rehabilitation  of  schools  and  kindergartens,  improvement  of  infrastructure  aimed  at  preventing 
natural  disasters,  creation  of  sustainable  economic  base  for  Internally  Disabled  Persons, 
rehabilitation  of  water  supply  and  water  supply  and  sanitation,  construction  of  shelters  for

Scope of Consulting Services 
Organization and Communication 
8. 
Overall, the administration, execution and oversight of the “Civil Works” will be organized 
through contract with three standard roles: the Employer, a Contractor, and a Project Manager. 
82 
Appendix 2 
MDF  as  the  Employer,  on  behalf  of  the  government  of  Georgia,  will  act  as  the  implementing 
agency  to  perform  day-today  management  and  administration  of  the  project.  Contractor  (s), 
selected construction companies through open and transparent process, will be executor of the 
“Civil Works” under the project - Construction of Kindergartens and Sport Complexes in different 
regions of Georgia. Moreover, the Consultant, MDF’s legal representative, as identified in the 
contract  between  Employer  and  Contractor,  will  have  overall  responsibility  to  professionally 
supervise the Contractor’s activities and works – on behalf of the Employer (MDF).  
Therefore,  MDF  is  looking  forward  to  select  a  qualified  and  experienced  entity 
9. 
(Consultant),  which  will  provide  the  stated  Consulting  Services  and  diverse  expertise  that  is 
necessary  to  fulfill  the  contractual  role.  The  Consultant,  representing  the  Employer  will 
administer the construction contract and ensure that the works are conducted in accordance with 
the  provisions  of the construction contract.  The Consultant  will  make  all engineering decisions 
required for the successful and timely implementation of the civil works contract and will have all 
of  those  powers  defined by  the  Employer-Contractor  Agreement  and the Employer-Consultant 
Agreement.  
10. 
According to the LCIP implementation plan, at the time the consultant starts the services, 
the contracts of construction of most of the Kindergartens and Sport Complexes will be already 
signed  and  civil  works  started.  Supervision  of  started  projects  will  be  temporarily  managed  by 
MDF.  Therefore, the  Consultant  will  have to  take over  the  started  works  on  each  location  and 
continue  the  supervision  services  according  to  the  tasks  and  requirement  outlined  in  this 
document. The transfer procedure of works will be defined by MDF.  
At the start of the consulting services, on locations, where there are no signed contracts 
11. 
of  construction,  the  Consultant  will  have  to  provide  the  services  according  to  the  tasks  of  this 
document (including the “Pre-construction Phase, Section 2 below). The list of projects/location 
may be amended and/or some locations may be changed, added or subtracted at the discretion 
of MDF. 
12. 
The  Consultant  is  directly  responsible  for  day-to-day  supervision  of  the  civil  works  by 
actively cooperating and working with the Contractor. The Consultant should closely work with 
MDF’s monitoring unit to solve ongoing issues of a project. The Consultant should ensure that 
Contractors  adhere  to  the  requirements  of  detailed  designs,  technical  specifications  and 
environmental/social safeguards requirements. 
The Consultant should provide all necessary personnel on site (engineers, supervisors, 
13. 
quality inspectors, environmental, social and gender specialists, health and safety engineer etc.) 
for the supervision of works, inspection and installation of the equipment, testing of construction 
materials, monitoring the implementation of environmental, social and gender requirements etc. 
The Consultant should monitor that works and goods are delivered according to specifications, 
calculations  and  terms  and  conditions  of  civil  works  and  supply  contracts.  Moreover,  after  the 
completion  of  civil  work the  Consultant  is  liable to  monitor the facilities for  defects  during the 
liability period and confirm that defects are remedied.  
14. 
Before  commencement  of  works,  the  Consultant  should  conduct  a  comprehensive, 
critical review of the proposed designs (for the locations/projects, where contracts for construction 
are not signed) in the field – and present written conclusions in the report regarding any necessary 
design  changes  or  design  aspects,  which  may  pose  implementation  problems  or  unintended 
results  during  works.  Should  a  construction  contract  require  a  change,  the  Consultant  shall 
prepare a “change order”, agree a price for the change with the Contractor, draft an amendment 
Appendix 2  
83 
to the Bill of Quantities, and submit all to the Employer for approval. This shall be done over a 
ten-day period after a change is called to the attention of a Consultant.   
15. 
The  Consultant  shall  submit  the  detailed  work  plan  of  the  construction  supervision 
(including scope of duties of each specialist of the Consultant’s team) considering construction 
phases and tentative terms of implementation as well as cost estimates indicating estimation of 
work days of the specialists and covering all the costs related to supervision execution. 
2. 
 General Tasks 
16. 
The Consultant should ensure that construction and rehabilitation works are conducted 
in  accordance  to  prescribed  quality,  specifications,  tender  documents,  social,  gender, 
environmental,  health  and  safety  (EHS)  requirements,  and  quality  assurance  system.  As 
necessary, the Consultant will assist MDF with overall contract management and approve "as 
built" drawings prepared by Contractors. 
The Consultant should consider civil works supervision services for all 20 Kindergartens 
17. 
and  4  Sport  Complexes  listed  above.  Civil  works  will  include  various  types  of  structural 
strengthening, construction, and rehabilitation works, including introduction of energy efficiency 
measures.  Below  is  presented  a  table  with  the  tentative  timeframe  and  estimated  costs  of

Background and Objective 
General Background 
1. 
Construction-rehabilitation  of  infrastructure  is  one  of  the  priorities  of  the  Georgian 
Government. The Municipal Development Fund of Georgia (MDF) established by the Government 
under the Ministry of Regional Development and Infrastructure (MRDI)  implements construction-
rehabilitation of  infrastructure  on  the  whole territory  of  Georgia.  For  above mentioned  goal the 
MDF actively cooperates with various international donors whose finances together with the funds 
of  the  budget  of  Georgia  make  the  source  of  financing  of  the  MDF  for  implementing  various 
infrastructure projects.  
2. 
Georgia has applied for financing from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) toward the cost 
of the Livable Cities Investment Project for Balanced Development (LCIP) under a sector loan to 
improve urban and tourism infrastructure and services across three urban area clusters - Kakheti 
region with Telavi and Gurjaani, Samegrelo-Zemo Svaneti region with Zugdidi  and Mestia as the 
regional hubs and one specific area in the city of Tbilisi. The Project aims at improving the livability 
of the selected urban area clusters and Tbilisi through three interlinked outputs:  
(i)  Inclusive  and  climate-resilient  urban infrastructure  rehabilitated  and  constructed and 
services improved, 
(ii) accessibility, connectivity and mobility of tourism clusters  across Georgia improved, 
and (iii) institutional capacity for sustainable urban and regional development enhanced. 
The main goal of the LCIP is to support the local economy in the selected clusters by 
3. 
carrying out an integrated approach to tourism development, focusing on infrastructure, urban 
regeneration, cultural heritage restoration, skills development and enabling the environment to 
attract private sector investments. These include integrated solutions that bring co-benefits to the 
citizens in the development of the urban clusters including water supply, sewerage and sanitation 
(including off-network solutions), tourism, urban transport and mobility (including nonmotorized 
and  public  transport),  solid  waste  management,  economic  corridors,  cultural  and  historical 
heritage  conservation, flood control  and  drainage,  urban  safety  and resilience,  among  others. 
Several subprojects are already defined to be implemented in selected clusters under the LCIP. 
Overall management and coordination of implementation and supervision of Project will 
4.  
be executed by the Municipal Development Fund of Georgia (MDF).  
The present terms of reference (ToR) describe consulting services for supervision of civil 
5.

Scope of Consulting Services 
1. 
Organization and Communication 
Overall, the administration, execution and oversight of the “Civil Works“ will be organized 
8. 
through contract with three standard roles: the Employer, a Contractor, and a Project Manager. 
TDF  as  the  Employer,  on  behalf  of  the  government  of  Georgia,  will  act  as  the  implementing 
agency to perform day-today management and administration of the project.  
9. 
Contractor(s), selected construction companies through open and transparent process, 
will be executor of the “Civil Works” under the project - Construction of Dighomi Meadows Park 
in Tbilisi. 
10.  Moreover,  the  Consultant,  TDF’s  legal  representative,  as  identified  in  the  contract 
between Employer and Contractor, will have overall responsibility to professionally supervise the 
Contractor’s activities and works – on behalf of the Employer (TDF).  
11. 
Therefore, TDF is looking forward to select a qualified and experienced entity (Consultant), 
which will provide the stated Consulting Services and diverse expertise that is necessary to fulfill 
the contractual role. The Consultant, representing the Employer will administer the construction 
contract  and  ensure  that  the  works  are  conducted  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  the 
construction  contract.    The  Consultant  will  make  all  engineering  decisions  required  for  the 
successful and timely implementation of the civil works contract and will have all of those powers 
defined by the Employer-Contractor Agreement and the Employer-Consultant Agreement.  
12. 
Therefore,  the  consultant  will  have  to  take  over  the  started  works  and  continue  the 
supervision  services  according  to  the  tasks  and  requirement  outlined  in  this  document.  The 
transfer procedure of works will be defined by TDF.

TERMS OF REFERENCE 
FOR PROJECT MANAGEMENT SUPPORT CONSULTANTS 
A.  Background 
Georgia is strategically located at the crossroads of Europe and Asia and is rich in natural 
1. 
resources  and  cultural  heritage.  Despite 
these  comparative  advantages,  substantial 
infrastructure, urban services, and capacity gaps remain to unlock its economic growth potential 
especially for secondary cities and towns in the regions. Although Georgia is an upper middle-
income country, living standards are poor and economic growth has been unevenly distributed 
between Tbilisi,  the  capital  city  and  other  urban areas across  the regions. Most regional  cities 
offer limited job opportunities and low social benefits and poor quality of life resulting in an out-
migration of youth to the larger cities of Tbilisi, Kutaisi and Batumi. Growing disparities between 
urban and rural areas challenge inclusive economic growth nationwide. 
2. 
The Government has been focusing on improving livability in the regions, but generally 
followed  a siloed  approach,  targeting  a single element  of  regional/urban development.  Donors 
followed  suit  in  their  support.  ADB,  for  instance,  supported  water  supply  and  sanitation 
interventions under the Urban Services Improvement Investment Program (USIIP) multi-tranche 
financing facility (MFF) from 2011 and urban transport interventions under the Sustainable Urban 
Transport Investment Program (SUTIP) from 2010-2020.   
3. 
The  Government  reoriented  urban  sector  operations  since  November  2016,  under  the 
ADB  technical  assistance  for  Livable  Urban  Areas,  to  provide  programmatic  and  integrated 
solutions  for  developing  livable  cities.  TA  9220  expanded  ADB’s  3E  approach  of  Economy 
(competitive), Environment (resilience) and Equity (inclusive) to a 5E Livable Cities Approach by 
including  Enablers  (institutions  and  policies)  and  Engagement  (stakeholders).  ADB’s  Livable 
Cities approach puts people and community well-being at the center of urban development for 
making cities economically competitive, environmentally sustainable, low-carbon and resilient, as 
well as inclusive.29 The TA prepared integrated urban action plans (IUAPs) through participatory 
planning and visioning as ten-year investment plans for selected urban region clusters as tourism 
hubs. The IUAPs were the basis for prioritization of the subprojects for the proposed Livable Cities 
Investment Project (LCIP) for balanced regional development.  
4. 
The  Integrated  Urban  Action  Plans  prepared for  the  urban regional  clusters  and  Tbilisi 
along  with  the  Government  socio-economic  strategy  (Georgia  2020)  and  the  Regional 
Development Program 2018-2021 provide a sector development plan with targets, benchmarking 
and an investment plan to leveraging the comparative advantages to develop competitive, livable 
cities  and  urban  area  clusters  based  on  integrated  urban  planning  through  an  adaptive 
approach.30 The main focus of the sector development plan is to overcome three main challenges: 
i) limited economic opportunities and high (youth) unemployment, ii) inadequate urban, public and 
tourism infrastructure and services, and, iii) limited planning and urban management capacities 
of municipalities.

livability and balanced regional development promoted in the regions and Tbilisi in Georgia. The 
Project, will improve the quality of public space, mobility, and livability, with an inclusive urban 
design and public space management for adapting the built environment for the elderly, people 
with disabilities, women, and children. It will have the following interlinked outputs: (i) Inclusive 
and climate-resilient urban infrastructure rehabilitated and constructed and services improved; (ii) 
accessibility,  connectivity,  and  mobility  of  tourism  clusters  across  Georgia  improved;  and  (iii) 
institutional  capacity  for  urban  and  regional  development  enhanced.  The  additional  scope  for 
Tbilisi  City  covers  urban  area  upgrading,  park rehabilitation,  public  space  management,  public 
transport  improvements  covering  550  km  of  Tbilisi  Metro  cabling  (baseline:  388  km)  and 
installation of 32 ventilators, provision and installation of software and equipment for the academic 
center  and  research  laboratory  (BridgeLab)  of  the  Georgian  Technical  University,  one  bridge 
constructed  in  Tbilisi  alongside  the  proposed  transit-oriented  development,  at  least  one  park 
upgraded and at least one metro station access improved incorporating inclusive cities guidelines, 
river rehabilitation and supporting private sector development for affordable housing.

Tbilisi. Subprojects will incorporate inclusive cities and gender-responsive guidelines. 
and 
(iii) Institutional capacity for sustainable urban and regional development enhanced 
Under this output, the project will strengthen the capacity of MRDI, MDF, TCH, TDF, 
and local governments to manage regional and local economic development, urban 
service  delivery,  and  municipal  finances  with  the  conduct  of  urban  management 
partnerships, trainings and workshops.31 A business development facility, designed at 
a later stage for the areas where  investment projects are implemented  will support 
development of the private sector and MSMEs, including women’s entrepreneurship, 
through supporting them  with mechanisms for accessing finances including through 
Government funded Grant and Credit Guarantee schemes.

development  and  is  aligned  with  the  Government  of  Georgia’s  flagship  programs  such  as 
Renewed Regions Program. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the executing agencies for 
the project readiness loan have discussed and agreed on selection criteria for choosing ensuing 
projects that will be supported during implementation. This approach will allow the government to 
lead the identification, prioritization, and due diligence for selecting future projects to be supported 
under  the  Livable  Cities  Investment  Project  for  Balanced  Development  as  prepared  under  the 
Loan 6024 Project Readiness Financing for Livable Cities Investment Program. Projects prepared 
by Government through their budget will also be considered for financing subject to meeting the 
selection criteria. The subprojects will be as per the outputs with a focus on upgrading of urban 
centers,  other  settlements  and  neighborhoods,  improvement  of  public  spaces  and  parks, 
pedestrian  paths,

2. 
Management Responsibility for Preparing Project Financial Statements  
Management is responsible for preparing and fairly presenting the project financial statements, 
3. 
and for maintaining sufficient internal controls to ensure that the financial statements are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In addition, management is responsible for ensuring 
that funds were used only for the purpose(s) of the project, for compliance with financial covenants 
(where applicable), and for ensuring that effective internal controls, including over the procurement 
process, are maintained. In this regard, management must: 
(i) 
(ii) 
Prepare and sign the Audited Project Financial Statements. 
Prepare and sign a Statement of Compliance. 
4. 
Management must include the following in the Statement of Compliance: 
(i) 
(ii)

That project financial statements are free from material misstatements including 
omissions and errors, and are fairly presented;  
That the borrower or executing agency has utilized the proceeds of the loan only for the 
purpose(s) of the project; 
That the borrower or executing agency was in compliance with the financial covenants of 
the legal agreement(s) (where applicable); 
32  This statement of audit needs was developed to guide project teams and executing and implementing agencies in

audit needs may also be used as a guide when communicating auditing requirements with supreme audit institutions, 
where applicable. 
164 
Appendix 5 
(iv) 
(v) 
That the advance fund procedure, where applicable, has been operated in accordance 
with the Asian Development Bank’s (ADB) Loan Disbursement Handbook; 
That adequate supporting documentation has been maintained to authenticate claims 
stated on the statement of expenditures (SOE), where applicable, for reimbursement of 
eligible expenditures incurred and liquidation of advances provided to the advance 
account; and 
(vi) 
That effective internal control, including over the procurement process, was maintained. 
3. 
Objectives  
The objective of the audit of the project financial statements is to enable the Auditor to (i) express 
5. 
an independent and objective opinion as to whether the project financial statements present fairly, in all 
material respects, or give a true and fair view of the project’s financial position, its financial performance 
and cash flows; and (ii) provide a reasonable assurance opinion over certain specific representations 
made in the Statement of Compliance.   
4. 
Auditing Standards 
The audit is required to be conducted in accordance with International Standards of Auditing 
6. 
(ISA). These standards require that the Auditor comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform 
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the project financial statements are free from 
material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the 
amounts and disclosures in the project financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the 
Auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the project financial 
statements whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the Auditor considers the 
internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the project financial statements 
in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of 
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes 
evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting 
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the project financial 
statements. 
7. 
The standards to be applied will be documented in the project/loan documents, and will include:  
Standards promulgated by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB): 
1. 
2. 
International Standards on Auditing (ISA); and 
International Standards on Assurance Engagements (ISAE). 
8. 
In complying with ISA, the Auditor will pay particular attention to the following standards: 
•
