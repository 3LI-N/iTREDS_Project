The  project  administration  manual  (PAM)  describes  the  essential  administrative  and 
management requirements to implement the project on time, within budget, and in accordance 
with the policies and procedures of the government and Asian Development Bank (ADB). The 
PAM should include references to all available templates and instructions either through linkages 
to relevant URLs or directly incorporated in the PAM. 
The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) and the five participating provincial 
people’s  committees  (PPC),  as  executing  agencies  and  the  five  participating  Department  of 
Agriculture and Rural Development (DARD), as implementing agencies are wholly responsible 
for the implementation of ADB-financed projects, as agreed jointly between the borrower and 
ADB,  and in  accordance  with  the  policies and  procedures of the government  and ADB.  ADB 
staff  is  responsible  for  supporting  implementation  including  compliance  by  MARD,  the  five 
participating  PPCs  and  the  five  DARDs,  as  implementing  agencies,  of  their  obligations  and 
responsibilities for project implementation in accordance with ADB’s policies and procedures. 
At loan negotiations, the borrower and ADB shall agree to the PAM and ensure consistency with 
the loan and grant agreements. Such agreement shall be reflected in the minutes of the loan 
negotiations. In the event of any discrepancy or contradiction between the PAM and the loan 
and grant agreements, the provisions of the loan and grant agreements shall prevail. 
After ADB Board approval of the project's report and recommendations of the President (RRP), 
changes in implementation arrangements are subject to agreement and approval pursuant to 
relevant government and ADB administrative procedures (including the Project Administration 
Instructions) and upon such approval, they will be subsequently incorporated in the PAM.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
1. 
The  project  will  modernize  eight  irrigation  systems  in  five  drought-affected  provinces, 
namely Binh Thuan, Dak Lak Dak Nong, Khanh Hoa and Ninh Thuan.1 The modernized systems 
will  enhance  the  provinces’  ability  to  manage  climate  variability,  improve  water  productivity  of 
agriculture, and increase incomes by supporting farmers to grow high-value crops (HVC) such as 
coffee, pepper, grapes, apples, dragon fruit and mango.2 The project was predicated by the El 
Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) induced drought in 2014−2016 which affected the south central 
coastal  and  central  highland  regions  of  Viet  Nam.  The  project  integrates  climate  resilient 
agricultural  practices 
(i) strengthening irrigation management to improve climate resilience; (ii) modernized irrigation 
infrastructure; and (iii) supporting efficient on-farm water management practices.

A. 
Impact and Outcome 
2. 
The project is aligned with the following impact: climate resilience and water productivity 
in  agriculture  improved.  The  project  will  have  the  following  outcome:  climate  resilient  and 
modernized irrigation systems in five provinces established.3 
B. 
Outputs 
3. 
Output  1:  Irrigation  management  services  strengthened  will  support  policy  and 
institutional development measures to improve climate resilience of agriculture by strengthening 
irrigation  management  taking  into  consideration  social  and  gender  dimensions  in  all  relevant 
activities. Specifically, the project will support the following interventions:  
(i) 
Irrigation  water  allocation  and  delivery  services.  Activities  will  include:  (a) 
updating  surface  and  ground  water  assessments;  (b)  an  irrigation  water  sharing  and 
allocation framework; and (c) provision of a real-time decision support system for farmers 
on optimizing crop water application.  
(ii) 
Maintenance of irrigation systems. Includes (a) development of asset inventory 
and  management  database  for  each  irrigation  system  supported  by  the  project;  (b) 
development  of  a  systematic  asset  maintenance  schedule  with  a  rigorous  approach  to 
maintenance funding based on asset condition assessments; (c) development of a pricing 
framework for water charges; and (d) assessment of options for engaging third parties in 
the operation and maintenance (O&M) of irrigation systems. 
4. 
Output 2: Modernized irrigation infrastructures developed. This output will modernize 
eight  irrigation subprojects  in five provinces to  provide  water  on-demand to farmers  cultivating 
HVCs and reduce vulnerability to climate change.4 The modernization falls into three groups. 
(i)  Group  1:  New  pipe  systems  taking  water  from  canals  or  reservoirs,  and  supplying 
1  Modernization  is  defined  as  the  process  of  upgrading  infrastructure,  operations  and  management  of  irrigation 
systems to sustain the water delivery service requirements of farmers and optimize production and water productivity. 
ADB. 2017. Irrigation Subsector Guidance Note. Manila. 
2   Water Productivity (commonly termed as crop per drop) involves the dual objectives of increasing crop yields and/or 
reducing crop water use. It does not replace irrigation efficiency; instead it brings together the two essential outcomes 
of  irrigation  water  management  into  one  single  expression:  crop  production  and  crop  water  consumption.  It  is  a 
relative indicator measured in terms of crop yield (kilogram) or value ($) per unit of water consumed (cubic meter). 
3   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.

hydrants located at a reasonable distance from a farmer’s field, such that the farmer 
can connect directly using a hose.5 Several farmers would connect to each hydrant 
taking water in turns and as per their requirements. Sufficient flexibility is provided so 
that, generally, all farmers can irrigate within daylight hours. Basic supervisory control 
and  data  acquisition  (SCADA)  systems  will  facilitate  operations  such  as  remote 
monitoring of flows at hydrants, pressures at key points in pipelines, and linking pump 
operation  to  water  levels  in  a  controlling  header  tank.  Consultation  with  male  and 
female farmers will be conducted and its outputs will be incorporated in the design and 
implementation.  This  group  is  further  subdivided  into:  gravity  pipe  systems,  and 
pumped pipe systems. 
(ii)  Group  2:  Existing  canal  systems  rehabilitated  and  upgraded  including  canal  lining, 
control structure, balancing storage and installation of flow control and measurement 
devices  with  remote  monitoring.6  Direct  pumping  into  pumped-pipe  systems  will  be 
supported. The canal  systems  together  with pumped pipe  abstractions,  will  support 
efficient irrigation of HVCs. 
(iii)  Group 3: New and improved weirs, and other works. New weir structures will replace 
farmer’s  constructed  temporary  weirs  and  provide  permanent  ponds/storage  from 
which farmers can pump to irrigate HVCs such as pepper and coffee on hill slopes. 
Other  works  include  upgrading  of  upstream  storage  and  supply  systems  including 
reservoirs,  culverts,  roads,  and  control  /  monitoring  systems  to  facilitate  improved 
management. 
(iv)  Other works include upgrading culverts and roads, to facilitate improved management 
of irrigation systems. 
5. 
The project will finance on a sliding scale, the viability gap associated with the operator’s 
breakeven financial return over the course of the project period. It will also finance an evaluation 
study upon completion to assess effectiveness and commercial viability of the arrangement. 
6. 
Output  3:  Efficient  on  farm  water  management  practices  adopted  will  focus  on 
improving on-farm water productivity in the subproject command areas, to improve resilience to 
climate change. Water productivity assessments conducted under output 1 will  help determine 
suitable  norms  for  different  crops  under  different  agro-ecological  conditions.  Based  on  this 
information,  farmers  will  receive  training  and  advisory  services  to  improve  on-farm  water 
management to cope with climate variability. The service providers will consult with and provide 
technical  advice  to  male  and  female  farmers  regarding  identifying  and  developing  appropriate 
micro-irrigation systems that meets their individual requirements. Farmers will also be linked up 
with private sector suppliers and be provided training in O&M of micro-irrigation systems.  
Detailed  implementation  procedure  per  output  is  in  appendix  1  of  this  project

A. 
Project Implementation Organizations: Roles and Responsibilities 
The  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Rural  Development  (MARD)  and  the  five  participating 
12. 
provincial people’s committees (PPCs) will be the executing agencies. MARD will be responsible 
for the overall implementation and management of the project through its Central Project Office 
(CPO). The CPO will establish a central project management unit (CPMU), to implement activities 
under output 1. It will also be responsible for overall coordination of the project with the Asian 
Development  Bank  (ADB),  other  central  government  agencies  and  provincial  agencies.  The 
participating PPCs will delegate implementation responsibility to their respective Department of 
Agriculture  and  Rural  Development  (DARD).  In  their  respective  provinces,  each  DARD  will 
establish  a  PPMU  to  implement  activities  under  outputs  2  and  3.  All  loan  proceeds  will  be 
channeled  directly  to  the  provinces  on  re-lending  terms  and  conditions  agreed  between  the 
Ministry of Finance (MOF) and the provinces. MARD will receive no loan proceeds. 
The CPMU and PPMUs will be established immediately after approval of the minutes of 
13. 
the loan negotiation. The CPMU will be headed by a project director and supported by qualified 
staff responsible for social/gender safeguards, environment safeguards, resettlement safeguards, 
procurement accounts, monitoring and evaluation and office administration. 
14. 
Each PPMU will be headed by a project director and have staff responsible for safeguards, 
implementation  support,  contract  administration  and  supervision,  procurement,  accounts, 
monitoring and evaluation, and office administration. ADB recommends that staff with previous 
experience in implementing ADB projects or other official development assistance (ODA) projects 
be recruited for the PMUs. Qualifications of selected staff will be subject to ADB's review and no-
objection.

FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT 
A. 
Financial Management Assessment 
The  financial  management  assessment  (FMA)  was  conducted  between  March  to  May 
21. 
2017,  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  Guidelines  on  the  Financial  Management  and  Analysis  of 
Projects and the Financial Management Due Diligence: Methodology Note.  The FMA reviewed 
financial  management  capacity  of  (i)  the  CPO  for  MARD,  and  (ii)  DARDs  for  the  Provincial 
People's  Committees  (PPCs)  of  five  project  provinces.  The  scope  of  FMA  covered  funds  flow 
arrangements, staffing, accounting and financial reporting systems, internal and external auditing 
arrangements,  and  financial  information  systems.  The  FMA  was  prepared  based  on  the 
information collected from the EA and IAs. 
22. 
The FMA concluded that the overall financial management risk rating of the project before 
considering mitigating measures is moderate. This is because CPO and DARDs have sufficient 
capacity  in  financial  management  of  donor-funded  projects  and  they  will  establish  respective 
project management units (PMUs) exclusively for this project. The capacity of CPO and DARDs 
are not limited to financial management, but also to other areas related to project management 
such as consultant recruitment and procurement of goods and works.  Based on the FMA, it is 
concluded that the EA and the IAs have the capacity to  use the statement of expenditure and 
advance fund procedures. During the project implementation, the CPO will supervise and guide 
the central project management unit (CPMU) while each of the five DARDs will do the same for 
the provincial project management units (PPMUs). The CPO already have financial management 
manual used for other ADB projects and will update the manual for this project. Each of CPMU 
and  PPMUs  will  have two full-time qualified  accountants  with a chief  accountant dedicated for 
financial management of this project at the national and provincial levels. 
23. 
The  FMA  concluded  that  the  prevailing  structure  and  system  of  project  financial 
management  in  the  EA  and  IAs,  after  considering  mitigating  measures  is  appropriate.  The 
identified financial management risks will be closely monitored during project implementation. The 
financial management action plan is provided in Table 9. 
Table 9: Financial Management Action Plan 
Action 
EAs and IAs will establish CPMU and PPMUs. 
EAs and IAs will ensure recruitment of two full-time 
qualified accountants, one of which has experience with 
ADB or the World Bank project. 
EAs/CPO will give a first round of training to accountants 
of PPMUs on ADB financial management requirements 
or get them to attend ADB’s training on disbursement. 
EAs/CPO and IAs will ensure that PPMUs will use an 
accounting software satisfactory for the government and 
ADB. 
CPMU will develop a financial management manual.

Disbursement 
1. 
Disbursement Arrangements for ADB Funds 
The  loan,  CCF  grant  and  ADB  administered  grant  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in 
24. 
accordance  with  ADB’s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time), 
and detailed arrangements agreed upon between the government and ADB. Online training for 
project staff on disbursement policies and procedures is available.7 Project staff are encouraged 
to avail of this training to help ensure efficient disbursement and fiduciary control. 
25. 
Under  the  guidance  of  CPO  and  DARDs,  CPMU  and  each  PPMU  in  the  participating 
provinces  will  be  responsible  for  all  disbursement  arrangement  including  (i)  preparing 
disbursement  projections,  (ii)  requesting  budgetary  allocations  for  counterpart  funds,  (iii) 
collecting supporting documents, and (iv) preparing and sending withdrawal applications to ADB. 
At the end of each year, realistic projections of contract awards and disbursement for the next 
year will be made for an assessment and projection of ADB funds. 
26. 
Following  this  arrangement,  works  contractors, goods  and service  suppliers  will  submit 
invoices to their respective PPMU. Each PPMU will be responsible for preparing all supporting 
documentation required for payment and retain original documentation for purposes of audit. The 
PPMUs  shall  prepare  withdrawal  applications  for  direct  payments  or  make  the  necessary 
payments directly from the advance fund account after securing expense concurrence from the 
provincial state treasury. 
Advance fund procedure. A total of seven advance accounts will be established - two 
27. 
accounts to receive the advance from each grant at the CPMU level and five in each of the PPMU 
to receive the advance from the loan. The currency of the advance fund accounts is in US dollar. 
The  advance  fund  accounts  are  to  be  used  exclusively  for  each  financier’s  share  of  eligible 
expenditures. The CPMU and PPMUs who established the advance fund account in its name, is 
accountable and responsible for proper use of advances to the advance fund account. 
28. 
The total outstanding advance to each of the advance accounts should not exceed the 
estimate  of  each  financier’s  share  of  expenditures  to  be  paid  through  the  respective  advance 
account  for  the  forthcoming  six  months.  The  CPMU  and  PPMUs  may  request  for  initial  and 
additional advances to the advance accounts based on an Estimate of Expenditure Sheet8 setting 
out  the  estimated  expenditures  to  be  financed  through  the  accounts  for  the  forthcoming  six 
months. Supporting documents should be submitted to ADB or retained in the CPMU and PPMUs 
in accordance  with the ADB’s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook (2017,  as amended from time to 
time) when liquidating or replenishing the advance accounts. 
Statement  of  expenditure  procedure  (SOE).9  The  SOE  procedure  may  be  used  for 
29. 
reimbursement of eligible expenditures or liquidation of advances to the advance accounts. The 
ceiling of the SOE procedure is the equivalent to $100,000 per individual payment. Supporting 
documents and records for the expenditures claimed under the SOE should be maintained and 
made  readily  available  for  review  by  ADB's  disbursement  and  review  missions,  upon  ADB's 
request for submission of supporting documents on a sampling basis, and for independent audit.

9   SOE forms are available in Appendix 7B of ADB’s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to 
time). 
26 
Reimbursement  and  liquidation  of  individual  payments  in  excess of the SOE  ceiling  should  be 
supported by full documentation when submitting the withdrawal applications to ADB. 
30. 
Before the submission of the first withdrawal application, the borrower should submit to 
ADB sufficient evidence of the authority of the person(s) who will sign the withdrawal applications 
on  behalf  of  the  government,  together  with  the  authenticated  specimen  signatures  of  each 
authorized person. The minimum value per withdrawal application is set in accordance with the 
ADB’s Loan Disbursement Handbook. Individual payments below this amount should be paid (i) 
by the executing agency and/or implementing agency and subsequently claimed to ADB through 
reimbursement, or (ii) through the advance fund procedure, unless otherwise accepted by ADB. 
2. 
Disbursement Arrangements for Counterpart Fund 
31.  MARD  and  the  five  PPCs  will  annually  allocate  counterpart  funds  for  the  project.  The 
government will finance local taxes and duties; value-added tax and other similar types of taxes 
and duties. Counterpart funds are directly downloaded to CPMU and five PPMUs from the state 
treasury and provincial treasury. 
C. 
Accounting 
CPMU and each PPMU will maintain separate project accounts and records by funding 
32. 
sources and by categories as outlined in the financing agreements for all project expenditures 
incurred. The project’s accounting records and chart of accounts must be in compliance with the 
Circular 195/2012/TT-BTC dated 15/11/2012 issued by MOF. All supporting documents will be 
retained  per  requirements  by  ADB  and  the  government  of  Viet  Nam  with  easy  access  for  the 
authorized users of such information. Each PMU will prepare annual project financial statements 
using  the  modified  method  of  accounting  and  in  accordance  with  the  Vietnamese  government 
accounting  laws  and  regulations, specifically  Circular  195/2012/TT-BTC  under the  Vietnamese 
Accounting Standards, as well as the reporting requirements by ADB. 
D. 
Auditing and Public Disclosure 
33.  MARD  and  each  PPC  through  their  respective  PMUs  will  cause  the  detailed  project 
financial  statements  to  be  audited  in  accordance  with  the  International  Standards  on  Auditing 
(ISA)  and  International  Standard  on  Assurance  Engagements  on  (ISAE)  by  an  independent 
auditor  acceptable  to  ADB  (see  Appendix  8).  The  audit  report  will  comprise  the  financial 
statements prepared by project management and the auditor’s opinion following ISA 800: “Special 
Considerations - Audits of Financial Statements Prepared in Accordance with Special Purpose 
Frameworks” on whether the project financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, 
or give a true and fair view of the project’s financial positions and activities in accordance with the 
applicable  financial  reporting  framework  as  set  forth  in  the  Accounting  Section  C  above. 
Additionally, the auditor will also issue audit opinion on whether (i) the proceeds of the loan were 
used only for the purpose(s) of the project; and (ii) the borrower or executing agency was following 
the financial covenants contained in the loan agreements (where applicable) in accordance with 
requirements per ISAE 3000: “Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical 
Financial Information”. ADB requires a reasonable assurance engagement to be conducted under 
these standards. Limited assurance engagements are not acceptable. The annual audit report 
will include a management letter and a schedule of non-compliance findings, as necessary. 
27 
Compliance with financial reporting and auditing requirements will be monitored by review 
34. 
missions and during normal program supervision, and followed up regularly with all concerned, 
including the external auditor. 
Each of the PPC and CPO audited project financial statements will be submitted to ADB 
35. 
annually for each reporting period (fiscal year) from the date of loan effectiveness until the loan 
closing date or as agreed for the purpose of the project. The audited financial statements, together 
with the auditor's opinions, management letter and other supplementary information, if any, will 
be submitted in the English language to ADB within six months of the end of the fiscal year. The 
government and the PPCs have been made aware of ADB’s policy on delayed submission, and 
the requirements for satisfactory and acceptable quality of the audited accounts (covering failure 
of submitting audited accounts and financial statements by the due dates). ADB reserves the right 
to require a change in the auditor (in a manner consistent with the constitution of the borrower), 
or for additional support to be provided to the auditor, if the audits are not conducted in a manner 
satisfactory to ADB, or if the audits are substantially delayed. ADB reserves the right to examine 
the project's financial accounts and the auditor’s working papers to confirm that the share of ADB’s 
financing is used in accordance with ADB’s policies and procedures. 
36. 
Public disclosure of the audited project financial statements, including the auditor’s opinion 
on the project financial statements, will be guided by ADB’s Public Communications Policy 2011.10 
After the review, ADB will disclose the audited project financial statements and the opinion of the 
auditors on the project financial statements no later than 14 days of ADB’s confirmation of their 
acceptability  by  posting  them  on  ADB’s  website.  The  management  letter,  additional  auditor’s 
opinions, and audited entity financial statements will not be disclosed.11 
VI. 
PROCUREMENT AND CONSULTING SERVICES 
A. 
Advance Contracting 
37. 
All  advance  contracting  will  be  undertaken  in  conformity  with  ADB’s  Procurement 
Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time) and ADB’s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants 
(2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  issuance  of  invitations  to  bid  or  the  request  for 
submission of proposal under advance contracting will be subject to ADB’s prior approval. The 
borrower,  the  executing  agencies,  and  the  implementing  agencies  have  been  advised  that 
approval of advance contracting does not commit ADB to finance the project. 
Contracts  for  the  detailed  engineering  design  consultants,  construction  engineering 
38. 
support  consultants;  and  consulting  team  for  the  water  resources  assessment  (surface  and 
ground water) and water allocation framework will be recruited as part of advance contracting. 
The  steps  include  soliciting  and  evaluating  expressions  of  interest,  shortlisting  of  firms,  and 
preparation and evaluation of proposals. Said contracts will be awarded only after the project is 
declared effective. 
B. 
Procurement of Goods, Works, and Consulting Services 
All  procurement  of  goods  and  works  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB’s 
39.

Public Communications Policy. Paragraph 97(iv) and/or 97(v). 
28 
International competitive bidding (ICB)  procedures will be used for civil works contracts 
40. 
estimated to cost  $10.0 million  or  more,  and  supply  contracts  valued at $2.0 million  or  higher. 
Shopping  will  be  used  for  contracts  for  procurement  of  works  and  equipment  worth  less  than 
$100,000. National competitive bidding (NCB) procedures will be used for civil works estimated 
to cost $100,000 or higher but less than $10.0 million, goods and equipment worth $100,000 and 
higher but less than $2.0 million. 
41. 
Since the project is confinanced by the Netherlands Trust Fund under Water Financing 
Partnership Facility, which allows for universal procurement, a blanket waiver of member country 
procurement eligibility restrictions will apply as approved by the Board in 2013.12 
42. 
Procurement of works shall include construction of modern irrigation systems which are 
characterized by a combination of canal and pump-pipe pressure systems, together with control 
and  flow  measurement  equipment,  some  with  automation  and  remote  SCADA  monitoring  and

43. 
including pumps, valves, sensors and meters, need to be quickly replaced in event of failure to 
avoid  disruption  of  operations,  (ii)  commissioning  of  modern  systems  entails  calibration  and 
adjustment of valves, meters and other equipment and, particularly for any SCADA systems, also 
takes time, and (iii) IMCs and any third-party operators needs to acquire new skills in operating 
procedures.  Therefore,  civil  works  contracts  should  include  provision  to  support  for  operation 
throughout the (12 month) maintenance period to include, as appropriate for each subproject: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv)

51. 
works under contracts awarded on the basis of National Competitive Bidding shall be those set 
forth  in:  (a)  Law  on  Procurement  No.  43/2013/QH13  dated  November  26,  2013  (“Law  on 
Procurement”) and (b) Decree No. 63/2014/ND-CP dated June 26, 2014 (collectively, “National 
Procurement Laws”). Whenever any procedure in the National Procurement Laws is inconsistent 
with  the  ADB  Procurement  Guidelines  (March  2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time),  the  ADB 
Procurement Guidelines shall prevail, amongst others on the following. 
b. 
Eligibility 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
The  eligibility  of  bidders  shall  be  as  defined  under  section  I  of  the  ADB 
Procurement  Guidelines;  accordingly,  no  bidder  or  potential  bidder  should  be 
declared ineligible for reasons other than those provided in section I of the ADB 
Procurement  Guidelines,  as  amended  from  time  to  time.  Conditions  of  bidders’ 
participation shall be limited to those that are essential to ensure bidders’ capability 
to fulfill  the  contract  in  question.    Foreign  bidders  shall  be  eligible  to  participate 
under the same conditions as national bidders.  Foreign bidders shall not be asked 
or required to form joint ventures with, or be subcontractors to, national bidders in 
order to submit a bid. 
A firm declared ineligible by ADB cannot participate in bidding for an ADB-financed 
contract during the period of time determined by ADB. 
A  bidder  shall  not  have  a  conflict  of  interest,  which  term  shall  be  defined  in 
accordance with section 1 of ADB Procurement Guidelines.13 Any bidder found to 
have a conflict of interest shall be ineligible for contract award. 
Government-owned  enterprises  in  the  Borrower’s  country  shall  be  eligible  to 
participate as a bidder only if they can establish that they are legally and financially 
autonomous, operate under commercial law and are not dependent agencies of 
the Borrower or Sub-Borrower. 
(v) 
National sanction lists may only be applied with approval of ADB.14 
c. 
Preferences 
52. 
No preference of any kind shall be given to domestic bidders over foreign bidders or for 
domestically manufactured goods over foreign manufactured goods. Unless otherwise stated in 
the applicable financing agreement, preferences among domestic bidders set forth in Article 14(3) 
of the Law on Procurement shall not be applied. 
13  Detailed guidance on how to apply conflict of interest test is available under section 1 of ADB’s standard bidding documents  for 
goods and works (as amended from time to time). 
14  For fraud and corruption cases, Section 50 of ADB’s Integrity Principles and Guidelines provides that ADB may decide that another 
international financial institution’s or legal or regulatory body’s determination that a party has failed to adhere to appropriate ethical 
standards,  as  defined  by  any  established  system  of  principles,  rules,  or  duties,  including  the  laws  or  regulations  of  a  state, 
constitutes that party’s failure to maintain the highest ethical standards as required by ADB’s Anticorruption Policy. The party may 
be subject to remedial action in accordance with the Integrity Principles and Guidelines.

Table 10: Summary of Technical Services 
Summarized Scope of Work 
To support the CPO’s CPMU, the PPCs, DARDs, PPMUs and IMCs in oversight 
of construction quality and any design variations, SP management arrangements 
including  metering  and  charging,  possible  involvement  of  3rd  party  firms  under 
PPP arrangements, including supervising the technical support for high efficiency 
on farm water management systems and practices. 
Will monitor the implementation of safeguards if it’s in accordance with the agreed 
EMPs, REMDPs, GAP and ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement, 2009. 
Assess  water  resources,  surface  and  groundwater,  and  design  and  initiate  a 
groundwater monitoring program in selected WEIDAP SPs.  Consider and advise 
on water allocations between sectors, and priorities in event of water shortage/ 
drought. Output will include long term plans/ scenarios to meet rising demand from 
non-agricultural  sectors.  Contract  to  include  for  additional  monitoring  wells  as 
required in the selected (two coastal) subprojects. 
Each  subproject  will  have  the  option  of  accessing  water  productivity  data 
generated through a mobile network distribution system to be piloted under the 
project. 
In line with the new Law on Hydraulic Structures, provinces are expected to initiate 
water charging for irrigation. Particularly for the piped - hydrant schemes, accurate 
volumetric metering will facilitate transparent charging. However, in drought years, 
water  will  be short, and  farm allocation  priorities  need  to be  established,  giving 
priority  to  high-value  and  perennial  crops.  The  water  charging  framework/ 
amounts should reflect this. Finally, the IMCs do not at present have the skills to 
manage modern systems and water charging, and under this contract PPP options 
will  be  considered  to  bring  in  necessary  expertise,  as  an  alternative  to 
strengthening IMCs. 
With focus on WEIDAP subprojects, review and upgrade IMC asset inventories 
and operation control systems, developing database/ software control systems as 
appropriate,  and  also  develop  together  with  the  IMCs  and  others  concerned, 
generic guidelines for: (i) SP operations and software control systems, and (ii) SP 
maintenance planning, budgeting and implementation. The assignment will review 
the SCADA/ metering systems provided under the engineering contracts for each 
SP in output 2, with the aim to support uniformity in soft water/ database systems. 
Note:  In  addition  to  periodic  maintenance  of  civil  works  infrastructure  including 
canal banks, lining, and concrete structures, the new engineering control systems 
will need periodic calibration/ checking and part replacement. The maintenance 
guidelines need to cover both civil works and the equipment associated with the 
control systems. 
Selected  firm  to  provide  technical  advice  to  local  stakeholders/  farmers  on:  (i) 
connectivity  options  to  hydrants,  such  hose  or  buried  pipe  installations,  (ii)  on 
technically  appropriate  on-farm  water  distribution  /  application  systems,  drip, 
sprinkler,  buried  pipe  &  drag  hose,  depending  on  soils,  land  slopes,  crops  and 
watering requirements and farmer preference, and (iii) post implementation care, 
including fertigation for drip, cleaning of filters and clogged emitters, replacement 
of broken fittings, and so on. 
The  objectives  are  to  enable  the  auditor  to  (i)  express  an  independent  and 
objective opinion as to whether the project financial statements present fairly, in 
all material respects, or give a true and fair view of the project’s financial position, 
its  financial  performance  and  cash  flows,  and  (ii)  provide  a  reasonable 
assurance/opinion over certain specific representation made in the Statement of 
Compliance. 
Each  province  will  have  one  construction  supervision  consulting  contract  to 
provide technical supervision to the civil works contractors. To ensure that works 
are in accordance with the approved detailed engineering design. 
62. 
The Institute for Water Resources Planning (IWRP) will be directly engaged to undertake 
the  water  resources  assessment  (surface  and  groundwater)  and  water  allocation  framework 
40 
development. IWRP is the only institution that develop and monitor the development strategies, 
planning and management of irrigation, flood and drought in river basins on the central and central 
highlands regions since 1975. They are the only one who holds the comprehensive databases on 
water resources and irrigation development in all river basins in the regions. Furthermore, crop 
water productivity is a new technology in Viet Nam and IWRP is the only Vietnamese institution 
that  has  national  experts,  together  with  the  United  Nations  Education  Scientific  and  Cultural 
Organization’s - Institute for Water Education experts, that are required to undertake assessing 
baseline crop water productivity for WEIDAP. The existing surveyed data and trained capacities 
from IWRP is critical to assure quality and progress of WEIDAP which is not widely available in 
Viet Nam. While IWRP is a government-owned research center, its services are of a unique and 
exceptional nature and its participation is critical to project implementation. Therefore, it is eligible 
to participate in the project in accordance with ADB’s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, 
as amended from time to time) para 1.13(c). 
63. 
The  Center  for  Water  Resources  Software  (CWRS)  will  be  directly  engaged  by  the 
government for the development of software and guidelines for subproject management, as the 
assignment requires expertise in geographic information system, water resources management 
of irrigation systems, and managing built systems such as remote-sensing technology to serve 
the  irrigation  schedule  planning  and  system  operation,  SCADA  technology  for  monitoring  and 
controlling water distribution of systems. CWRS is the only agency in Viet Nam conducting in-
depth research and  development for managing, monitoring,  controlling  and  operating  irrigation 
systems in real time. Specifically, CWRS has been: (i) developing software tools for automatic 
image analysis and interpretation instead of manual interpretation using different remote-sensing 
image sources; (ii) researching GIS and software to manage irrigation area of each parcel and 
each irrigation work structure to ensure that the system runs smoothly on WebGIS platform; (iii) 
manufacturing  and  upgrading  SCADA 
technology  devices;  and  (iv)  using  researched 
technologies  to  develop  system  for  managing,  monitoring  irrigation  works  in  Vietnam 
(htpp://thuyloivietnam.vn), including the   information management for 5858 reservoirs; Vietnam’s 
river network, and large scale irrigation structures. Currently, the system is connected to receive 
data  from  27  reservoirs,  11  salinity  measuring  stations  equipped  with  automatic  monitoring 
devices, almost 500 reservoirs with manually entered data. The system is also set to update data 
from  657  rain  gauge  stations,  496  water  level  monitoring  stations  from  the  server  system  of 
National Hydro- meteorological center. In addition, the system updates data from 37 hydropower 
reservoirs from the server system of Electricity Vietnam Corporation (EVN). This system has been 
step-by-step  developed  via  the  implementation  of  packages  on  managing,  monitoring  and 
operating irrigation works in different projects in Vietnam. While CWRS is a government-owned 
research center, its services are of a unique and exceptional nature and its participation is critical 
to project implementation. Therefore, it is eligible to participate in the project in accordance with 
ADB’s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time) para 1.13(c). 
A. 
Involuntary Resettlement 
VII. 
SAFEGUARDS 
The overall project is categorized as B for involuntary resettlement. The project will result 
64. 
in minor social and economic displacement resulting from the rehabilitation of existing canals, the 
installation of buried pipe distribution networks (above which the land is to be converted into public 
land  to  facilitate  access  for  maintenance),  and  the  widening  of  existing  road  alignments  in 
association with providing service roads to the irrigation infrastructure. All eight subprojects for 
which  resettlement  and ethnic minority  development  plans  (REMDPs)  have been  prepared,  all 
are rated as Category B for resettlement. The nature and scale of displacement are specified in 
the REMDPs that guide implementation of the irrigation modernization subprojects. 
65. 
For output 2, the following have, or shall be applied: 
41 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
(v) 
(vi) 
Surveys were conducted to enable the quantification of resettlement impacts and 
baseline data for the preparation of the draft REMDPs. They include the inventory 
of losses (IOL) to estimate resettlement impacts and a socioeconomic survey to 
assess pre-project living standards as well as likely social impacts resulting from 
land acquisition; 
Public  consultations  with  stakeholders  comprising  government  entities,  private 
sector  interests  and  affected  households  were  held  during  preparation  of  the 
REMDP.  Meaningful  consultations  will  continue  during  the  updating  and 
implementation of the REMDPs. The draft and updated REMDPs will be disclosed 
to affected households and their communities; 
During DED process, locations of pipe alignments may change marginally and will 
result  to  changes  to  the  REMDP.  As  the  process  of  DED  is  proceeding,  the 
REMDP  shall  be  progressively  updated  and  the  consultation  with  affected 
households and communities continued through the DED phase; 
The final REMDPs for all eight subprojects shall be disclosed prior to PPC approval 
for  the  investment  to  proceed.  The  fundamental  objective  of  the  project 
resettlement policy is to replace and compensate lost assets based on the principle 
of  replacement  cost.  Compensation  and  various  forms  of  assistance  will  be 
provided. Once land acquisition is completed, income restoration measures will be 
put in place in a way that will ensure that standards of living of the project affected 
persons  are  at  least  restored  to  their  pre-project  levels,  and  that  those  in  the 
category of vulnerable groups (i.e. poor households.) are assisted to help improve 
their socioeconomic status; 
REMDPs  will  be  updated  upon  loan  effectiveness,  endorsed  by  PPCs  and 
submitted  to  the  ADB  for  review  and  concurrence.  The  updated  REMDPs  will 
require further detailed studies (including DMS and replacement cost survey) and 
additional  consultation.  Principal  aspects  to  be  updated  in  REMDPs  are 
resettlement  impacts  based  on  DMS;  census  of  affected  people;  entitlement 
matrix; and replacement costs and details of consultations and disclosure; and 
The  PPMUs,  with  participation  of  the  wards/communes,  and  relevant  mass 
organizations  (particularly 
the  Women's  Union  (WUs))  will  have  primary 
responsibility for the updating and implementation of the REMDPs with the support 
of the consultants. As such the capacity of these bodies is of critical importance 
and the project must ensure appropriate capacity building assistance in the form 
of information, training, and consultation and mentoring that will be supported by 
the  resettlement  officer  located  in  the  PPMU  as  well  as  by  national  specialists 
provided under the construction engineering support consultants (CESC). 
66. 
The EAs/IAs and the PPMUs will ensure that any involuntary resettlement is carried out in 
accordance with the agreed REMDPs, ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), and the laws 
and  regulations  on  involuntary  resettlement  that  apply  in  Viet  Nam.  In  case  of  discrepancies 
between government laws, regulations, and procedures, and ADB's Safeguards Policy Statement 
(2009), ADB' Safeguards Policy Statement will take precedence. 
42 
67. 
The  CPO/CPMU  will  engage  the  services  of  a  qualified  appraiser  to  carry  out  the 
replacement cost survey for land and non-land assets and submit the replacement cost survey 
report to the PPCs for review and approval. 
68. 
PPMUs  shall  ensure  that  prior  to  the  issuance  of  the  notice  for  site  possession  and 
commencement  of  construction  activities  for  a  specific  section,  the  resettlement  specialist  in 
CESC  has  officially  confirmed  in  writing  that  (i)  payment  has  been  fully  disbursed  to  the 
displaced/affected persons and rehabilitation measures are in place for that specific section as 
per the updated REMDPs agreed between the EAs and ADB; (ii) for affected persons that were 
already compensated have been cleared from the specific section in a timely manner; and (iii) 
that the specific section is free from any encumbrances. 
69. 
PPCs shall provide counterpart funds for land acquisition in a timely and sufficient manner, 
will  carry  out  resettlement  and  monitoring  activities  specified  in  the  agreed  REMDPs,  and  will 
meet  any  unforeseen  obligations  more  than  the  budget  cited  in  the  REMDPs  to  satisfy 
resettlement objectives. 
70. 
The PPMUs are responsible for internal monitoring with assistance from the resettlement 
specialist of the CESC. PPMUs will submit semi-annual internal monitoring reports to ADB. Final 
monitoring and evaluation need to be conducted after completion of all resettlement activities to 
assess (i) achievement of resettlement objectives; (ii) changes in living standards and livelihoods; 
(iii)  restoration  of  the  economic  and  social  base  of  the  affected  people;  (iv)  effectiveness  and 
sustainability of entitlements; and (v) the need for further support as required. Findings monitoring 
reports will be submitted to ADB through CPMU (on behalf of MARD). 
71. 
For  the  rehabilitation  of  existing  rural  road  alignments  to  improve  market  access  and 
provide incentives for private investment in the area.  As the roads are already in existence, there 
are existing corridors of public land with defined set-backs from the road edges. Land acquisition 
will therefore be minimal and required only where the road is to be straightened to meet higher 
road safety requirements. During preparation, the alignments were surveyed, and a resettlement 
plan prepared for the road upgrading. The same principles outlined for output 2 above are to be 
used for the resettlement plan implementation for the rural road rehabilitation. 
B. 
Environment 
The overall project is classified as Category B for environment as reflected from all the 
72. 
eight subprojects under output 2. Five separate initial environmental examinations (IEEs) have 
been  prepared,  including  eight  subproject  environment  management  plans  (EMPs) for the five 
participating  provinces.  CESC  will  include  an  environment  safeguards  specialist  who  will  work 
closely  with  the  DED  national  consultant  and  PPMUs.  The  CESC  environment  safeguard 
specialist will support updating subproject EMPs to be approved by ADB to reflect changes in the 
subproject, if any and include detail of the impacts and mitigation measures identified during DED. 
The approved EMP will  be integrated in the bidding and civil contract documents. Site EMP in 
detailing  mitigation  measure  implementation  in each construction package will  be  prepared by 
respective contractor and submitted to PPMUs for review. 
73. 
The CESC environment safeguards specialist will support CPMU to procure environment 
monitoring  contract  and  work  closely  with  the  construction  supervision  consultants  and 
independent  safeguard  monitoring  consultants  to  support  the  PPMU  in  monitoring  and 
supervision of the EMP implementation and ensure environment compliance in each subproject. 
43 
During  construction  phase,  semi-annual  environment  monitoring  reports  will  be  prepared  and 
submitted by PPMU to CPMU (on behalf of MARD) and ADB for review and uploading on ADB’s 
website. 
C. 
Ethnic Minorities 
74. 
ADB’s  Indigenous  People’s  policy  requires  that  under  an  ADB  loan,  the  borrower  will 
undertake  meaningful  consultation  with  affected  Indigenous  Peoples,  herein  referred  to  in  the 
Vietnamese context as “Ethnic Minorities” to ensure their informed participation in (i) designing, 
implementing, and monitoring measures to avoid adverse impacts on them or, when avoidance 
is not possible, to minimize, mitigate, and compensate for such effects; and (ii) tailoring project 
benefits that accrue to them in a culturally appropriate manner. Consultation will be carried out in 
a  manner  commensurate  with  the  impacts  on  affected  communities.  The  consultation  process 
and its results are documented and reflected in the REMDP. 
75. 
The overall project is classified as Category B for ethnic minorities and all eight irrigation 
modernization subprojects are Category B. In some cases, particularly in the Central Highland 
provinces  of  Dak  Lak  and  Dak  Nong,  ethnic  minorities  form  the  majority  of  the  population  of 
subproject command areas and since the project is designed to provide positive impacts to these 
groups,  measures  to  mitigate  negative  impacts  have  been  incorporated  in  the  combined 
REMDPs. 
76. 
Internal monitoring and progress reporting will be the responsibility of the PPMUs. At the 
local  level,  the  commune  supervision  board  with  representatives  of  ethnic  minority  people  will 
monitor on a regular basis. The process of establishing participatory monitoring must begin with 
the  identification  of  monitoring  criteria  by  the  beneficiaries  themselves,  against  which  they  will 
judge the success or failure of the subproject. 
Prohibited  investment  activities.  Pursuant  to  ADB’s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement 
77. 
(2009), ADB funds may not be applied to activities described on the ADB Prohibited Investment 
Activities List set forth at Appendix 5 of the Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). 
VIII. 
GENDER AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS 
78. 
Beneficiaries. The project will directly benefit about 39,140 households or an estimated 
184,000  people in the  eight  subproject  command  areas  who  will  benefit from the  project,  18% 
being ethnic minorities (EMs), 5,800 poor households, and a further 3,000 near poor. Households 
in target provinces are predominantly dependent upon agriculture for their livelihoods.  MOLISA 
reports  national  poverty  levels  of  9.9%  country-wide  in  2016  yet  within  three  of  the  five 
participating provinces, poverty levels are higher - Ninh Thuan - 14.9%; Dak Lak - 19.4%; and 
Dak Nong - 19.3%. Poverty levels are lower than the country average in Binh Thuan and Khanh 
Hoa because of the alternative income sources available. Poverty is characterized by lack of land, 
labor, access to credit, limited production knowledge and trade skills (especially of the ethnic and 
poor  women  with  lower  education),  and  poor  access  productive  (irrigation)  and  rural  road 
infrastructure (and consequently,  to  public  services).  A further  issue  is  language  barrier facing 
indigenous  EMs,  especially  middle-aged  women,  preventing 
in 
public/community  meetings  and  in  agricultural  extension  training  activities  proposed  under  the 
project. 
their  participation 
79.  With the project, the poor and landless will have more opportunities to provide labor on 
larger-scale farms expected with the larger commercial farming enterprises and the larger scale 
44 
private investors in high-tech agricultural production zone. If the poor own land within the planned 
command areas, they will directly benefit from a more secure source of water for productive and 
household purposes. As irrigation water is widely used for domestic purposes, the increased ease 
of access from the higher levels of service will result in women spending less time collecting water 
for domestic purposes (especially in the dry season). 
80. 
The  project  is  categorized  Effective  Gender  Mainstreaming  (EGM).  A  gender  analysis 
identified  relevant  gender  issues,  including  women  have  fewer  opportunities  than  men  to 
participate  in  public  decision  making,  access  information/training,  and  employment,  especially 
during  the  low  agricultural  season.  There  will  be  social  risks  associated  with  project 
implementation  during  and  after  civil  works  (the  arrival  of  labor  gangs  to  carry  out  the  works 
programs and install piped systems with the consequent threat of HIV/AIDS transmission, human 
trafficking  and  sexual  harassment).  Women  should  be  encouraged  to  participate  in  the  wage 
opportunities where equal wages for work of equal value is required. 
81. 
A Gender Action Plan was prepared, based on gender analysis, in consultation with the 
provinces,  DARDs/PPMUs  and  local  authorities  and  includes  gender  strategies,  activities  and 
targets. The GAP will promote gender equality through enhancing women’s access to economic 
opportunities, and social services and decision making and reduce social risks and vulnerabilities 
for  communities  with  specific  efforts  targeting  on  ethnic  minorities,  women  in  communities  of 
project  areas. The  PPMUs,  with the  support  of  the  CPO/CPMU  and  CESCs  will  develop  M&E 
system that provides sex-disaggregated data wherever relevant and gender specific information 
and assign a gender focal point and engage a social / gender specialist who shall be responsible 
for GAP implementation support, monitoring and reporting. 
82. 
Implementation  arrangements  and  budget:  ADB  will  finance  around  $30,128  for  the 
implementation  of  the  GAP  activities.  Each  PPMU  will  assign  a  gender  focal  point  to  be 
responsible  for  coordinating  GAP  implementation,  monitoring  and  reporting.  The  PPMUs  will 
incorporate  GAP  monitoring  in  their  quarterly  progress  reports,  (using  the  ADB  GAP  Progress 
Report template appendix 11) to government and ADB. The overview of the GAP is presented 
here  and  is  also detailed  in the  linked  document  No.15  accessible from the  Appendix  2  of the 
RRP.

B. 
Monitoring 
83. 
Project performance monitoring. Project progress and performance will be based on 
the indicators and targets shown in the design and monitoring framework (DMF). Five kinds of 
monitoring  will  be  carried  out  including:  (i)  activity/  implementation  progress  and  output 
monitoring; (ii) outcome/ benefit monitoring and evaluation; (iii) environment, resettlement, social 
and  gender  safeguards  monitoring;  (iv)  financing  agreement  covenant  monitoring;  and  (iv) 
financial monitoring/audit. Details of the PPMS is in Appendix 10 
84. 
The  project  performance  monitoring  should  be  carried  out  by  all  PPMUs  and  will  be 
submitted to ADB through CPMU for consolidation, on an annual basis to ensure that the intended 
project  benefits  are  receive  and  that  the  distribution  of  benefits  amongst  households  in  the 
irrigation command areas are received equitably throughout. 
85. 
Compliance  monitoring.  The  CPO,  CPMU,  PPC,  and  PPMU  with  assistance  of  the 
construction  engineering  support  consultants  and  construction  supervision  consultants  will 
conduct compliance monitoring and submit reports and information to ADB concerning (i) the use 
of  the  loan  and  grant  proceeds,  (ii)  project  implementation,  (iii)  project  performance,  and  (iv) 
compliance with the loan and grant covenants. These reports will be included in the (i) periodic 
progress  reports  on  project  implementation,  and  (ii)  project completion report  which should be 
submitted not later than six months after the physical completion of the project. 
86. 
ADB  will  undertake  regular  review  missions  to  assess  the  status  of  compliance  of  the 
project,  executing  and  implementing  agencies  with  the  loan  covenants  related  to  policy,  legal, 
economic, financial, environmental, and institutional elements. Non-compliance issues identified 
during the ADB review missions will be specified in the quarterly progress reports together with 
the recommended course of action. 
Gender  and  Social  Dimensions  Monitoring.  The  GAP  has  been  prepared  to  guide 
87. 
implementation to ensure that gender issues are adequately addressed. Performance against the 
GAP  will  be  monitored  by  the  PPMU  staff  who  will  review  subproject  activities  to  ensure 
conformity. The monitoring of project impacts will be collected on a sex disaggregated basis to 
demonstrate that women and men have equal access to project opportunities in an equal manner. 
Each PPMU will be responsible for monitoring the GAP and will report on achievements against 
project requirements on a quarterly basis. 
C. 
Evaluation 
88. 
ADB will conduct regular (at least twice per year) reviews throughout implementation of 
the project to assess implementation performance and achievement of outcomes and objectives, 
examine financial progress, and identify issues and constraints affecting the project and work out 
time-bound action plans for their resolution. 
89. 
A midterm review will also be undertaken within 36 months from loan effectiveness. This 
review will include a comprehensive evaluation of project implementation arrangements, detailed 
evaluation of the scope and implementation process and progress of subprojects, feedback from 
the PPMS, performance of consultants, capacity building progress, and possible reallocation of 
loan proceeds. During this more significant review, the impact from the pro-poor initiatives linked 
to  irrigation  system  development  will  be  assessed  as  will  the  allocation  by  local  IMCs  for  the 
maintenance of the infrastructure developed under the project. Remedial action will be instituted 
as required. 
50 
90.  Within  six  months  of  physical  completion  of  the  project,  MARD  will  submit  a  project 
completion report to ADB.16 
D. 
Reporting 
91.  MARD  through  the  CPMU  will  consolidate  reports  from  PPCs  and  submit  to  ADB  the 
following  (i)  quarterly  progress  reports  in  a  format  consistent  with  ADB's  project  performance 
reporting system; (ii) consolidated annual reports including (a) progress achieved by output as 
measured  through  the  indicator's  performance  targets,  (b)  key  implementation  issues  and 
solutions, (c) updated procurement plan, (d) updated implementation plan for the next 12 months, 
and (e) brief update on safeguard including GAP monitoring report using ADB’s format; (iii) semi-
annual  safeguard  monitoring  reports;  and  (iv)  a  project  completion  report  within  six  months  of 
physical  completion  of  the  project.  To  ensure  that  projects  will  continue  to  be  both  viable  and 
sustainable, project accounts and the executing agency audited financial statements together with 
the associated auditor's report, should be adequately reviewed. 
E. 
Stakeholder Communication Strategy 
92. 
Project preparation has been conducted with stakeholder agencies in the government at 
national,  provincial,  district  and  commune  levels  including  MARD,  MOF,  MPI  and  provincial 
equivalents.  Meetings  have  also  been  held  in the  participating  provinces  with  DPI,  DARD  and 
DOF  officials,  focusing  on  management  arrangements  and  issues.  Requirements  for  ensuring 
appropriate  levels  of  consultation  for  subproject  preparation  and  implementation  have  been 
reviewed and confirmed. 
93. 
Initial  subproject  preparation  includes  consultation  requirements  involving  documented 
evidence  of  inclusive  consultation  with  all  communities  in  the  subproject  area  and  participant 
information on numbers of women and men by ethnic minority. Subproject socio-economic/gender 
surveys that identify vulnerable groups to provide basis for specific consultation and participation 
mechanisms will be followed during implementation. 
During  implementation,  the  process  of  consultation  will  continue  throughout  detailed 
94. 
engineering design of subprojects to afford community groups the opportunity to voice their views 
on  how  the  subproject  is  to  be  designed,  implemented  and  operated.  In  addition,  associated 
initiatives  will  be  built  into  the  design  of  each  subproject  to  enhance  the  impact  from  and 
sustainability of the investments, particularly, the need to make payments for the pumping of water 
through piped ring main systems for farmer access. These associated initiatives will be identified 
in a participatory manner from a menu of options developed with the respective stakeholders and 
beneficiaries and will strengthen community-based organizations such as the women’s unions, 
village mediation units, producers and marketing groups, and businesses. 
5. 
Participation 
It  is  anticipated  that  the  community  will  be  mobilized  in  several  different  ways  during 
95. 
subproject  design,  implementation  and  operation.  During  subproject  design  and  preparation 
stages, community participation will consist primarily of their contributing to pipe locations, siting 
of offtake hydrants, river and road crossing structures and other aspects of location concerning 
infrastructure. During construction, there will be significant opportunities for active participation, 
51 
particularly for the poor households who will benefit from the subproject through provision of wage 
labor to the contractors. This will be encouraged through the bidding documents which will request 
the contractors to investigate this option, whenever possible. The community will also be able to 
participate  in  the  O&M  of  the  completed  infrastructure  whenever  possible through  provision  of 
labor or in some cases funds. The beneficiary communities will need to be consulted in the level 
of service provided during operations as they will ultimately be expected to contribute to ensure 
sustainability. 
6. 
Awareness 
96. 
Information  about  the  project  and  the  subprojects  including  the  objectives,  potential 
environmental  impact,  implementation  arrangements,  resettlement  and  compensation  matters, 
gender  issues,  issues  of  concerns  for  ethnic  minorities  will  be  provided  to  beneficiaries. 
Information will be provided through village meetings, pamphlets, and other announcements in 
both Vietnamese language and the language(s) of the communities whenever appropriate. The 
community will be fully informed of issues such as their right to participate in the subprojects and 
to be compensated for any loss of property including productive land and/or assets as well as 
gender equity and other relevant policies. Separate meetings and discussions will be arranged 
with  the  people  who  are  directly  affected  by  land  acquisition  and/or  resettlement  issues.  The 
community and particularly the affected households will be provided with detailed guidance and 
procedures regarding resettlement and compensation.

ANTICORRUPTION POLICY 
97. 
ADB’s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed 
with  MARD,  CPO,  PPCs  and  DARDs.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, 
accountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its 
agents, any violations of the Anticorruption Policy relating to the project.17 All contracts financed 
by ADB shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and 
accounts of the executing agency and all  project contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other 
service providers. Individuals and/or entities on ADB’s anticorruption debarment list are ineligible 
to participate in ADB-financed activity and may not be awarded any contracts under the project.18 
98. 
To support these efforts, relevant provisions are included in the loan and grant agreements 
and  the  bidding  documents  for  the  project.  References  on  ADB's  Anticorruption  Policy  can  be 
accessed through the following link: http://www.adb.org/Integrity/. 
XI. 
ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISM 
99. 
People who  are,  or may  in the future  be,  adversely  affected  by the  project  may  submit 
complaints  to  ADB’s  Accountability  Mechanism.  The  Accountability  Mechanism  provides  an 
independent forum and process whereby people adversely affected by ADB-assisted projects can 
voice,  and  seek  a  resolution  of  their  problems,  as  well  as  report  alleged  violations  of  ADB’s 
operational  policies  and  procedures.  Before  submitting  a  complaint  to  the  Accountability 
Mechanism,  affected  people  should  make  an  effort  in  good  faith,  to  solve  their  problems  by 
working with the concerned ADB operations department. Only after doing that and, if they are still 
dissatisfied, should they approach the Accountability Mechanism.19

Background 
The  project  will  modernize  eight  irrigation  systems  in  five  provinces  that  were  most 
1. 
severely affected by the drought, namely Binh Thuan, Dak Lak Dak Nong, Khanh Hoa and Ninh 
Thuan. The modernized irrigation systems will support farmers to grow high-value crops (HVC) 
which will increase the water productivity of agriculture.  The project takes a comprehensive and 
integrated  approach  under  three  outputs:  (i)  irrigation  management  services  strengthened;  (ii) 
modernized  irrigation  infrastructures  developed;  and  (iii)  efficient  on-farm  water  management 
practices adopted. The project is aligned with the government’s agriculture sector strategy and 
supports implementation of its recently approved Law on Hydraulic Structures.  It is also aligned 
with ADB’s country partnership strategy for Viet Nam (2016–2020), specifically pillar 2: increasing 
the  inclusiveness  of  infrastructure  and  service  delivery,  and  pillar  3:  improving  environmental 
sustainability and climate change response.

Appendix 3:    Terms of Reference for the Water Charging Framework, Institutional 
Arrangement and Protocols to Engage Service Providers to Operate Modernized 
Irrigation Systems 
A. 
Background 
1. 
In line with the new 2017 law on Water Resources/ Irrigation, provinces are expected to 
initiate water charging for irrigation. Particularly for the piped - hydrant schemes constructed under 
WEIDAP, accurate volumetric metering will facilitate transparent charging. However, in drought 
years, water will be short, and farm allocation priorities need to be established, giving priority to 
high-value and perennial crops. Under this contract, support will be given for each Province to 
develop and adopt a water charging framework and set irrigation charge amounts, which reflect 
this  crop  value,  cost  of  providing  water  and  priority/  assurance  of  supply.  The  Irrigation 
Management  Companies, IMCs,  do  not  at  present  have the  skills  to manage  modern  systems 
and  water  charging,  and  under  this  contract  public  private  partnership,  PPP,  options  will  be 
considered  to  bring  in  necessary  expertise,  as  an  alternative,  or  in  addition,  to  strengthening 
IMCs. Recommended arrangements will be piloted first in Khanh Hoa Province, then rolled out 
as appropriate in other subprojects.  
In undertaking the assignment, the contractor shall liaise closely with MARD, the CESCs, 
2. 
PPCs, DARDs, IMCs and others.

Task  1:  Metering  options  shall  be  reviewed  including  metering  hardware  (reliability, 
accuracy,  local  or  remote  read),  costs  and  management  implications.  The  review  shall  also 
consider pre- and post- paid charging options and advantages and disadvantages. Also, to be 
considered  is  the  level  of  metering  within  the  irrigation  system,  and  whether  group  and/  or 
individual household metering should be adopted. Deliverable: working paper on metering options 
5. 
Task 2: Water allocations and charging framework. From assessments of crop farm 
budgets  and  crop  values,  including  impact  of  low  priority/  interrupted  irrigation  supply,  water 
allocation priorities in the face of drought shall be recommended. Priority for irrigation shall be 
given  to high-value  and perennial  crops,  but  other factors may  also be factored  in.  Volumetric 
and/ or area-crop water charge rates shall be determined based on crop water requirements in 
the dry/ wet season months, irrigation allocation priority, as well as the cost of supplying irrigation. 
Crops/ farmers which are given the highest priority for water in the face of scarcity/ drought shall 
have a surcharge reflecting the value to farmers of having more assured/ reliable supply. Charges 
that  cover  full  O&M  costs  shall  be  identified,  and  the  subsidy  requirement  quantified  for  lower 
charges. Deliverable: irrigation charging framework and irrigation charge amounts 
Task  3:  Management  and  public-private-partnership  options.    Assess  the  irrigation

training  requirements.  Assess  risks  and  identify  mitigation  measures.  If  3rd  parties  are  to  be 
involved, detail contractual arrangement (with the IMC), as well as payment modality, and assess 
3rd party (private sector) interest. It is expected that farmer beneficiaries will bear the full cost of 
operation and maintenance. The study shall include for consultations with stakeholders including 
PPCs, IMCs, DARDs and farmers. Deliverable: working paper on MOM arrangements for pipe-
hydrant systems, with focus on 1-2 SPs where recommendations are to be piloted. 
Task  4:  Piloting  and  roll-out  of  charging  and  management  arrangements.  The 
7. 
metering, water allocation and charging and management arrangements shall be piloted in 1-2 
SPs, most likely in Khanh Hoa province. Under this contract, hands-on support shall be provided 
for the pilot(s) including workshops, capacity development and monitoring. It is anticipated that 
recommendations may require a variation to the engineering construction contract. Deliverables:

▪  Task 2B: Maintenance planning and budgeting system. A new and improved asset 
inventory  will enable timely planning and improved budgeting of maintenance. Data 
from  the  inventory  concerning  asset  condition  and  “fitness”,  may  be  combined  with 
yardsticks26, to estimate maintenance costs. The guideline will recognize the different 
categories  of  maintenance,  such  as  “routine”,  “periodic”  and  “priority  /  emergency” 
maintenance,  as  well  as  describe  the  maintenance  characteristics  of  different 
elements of the irrigation systems. For example, maintenance of earthen and concrete 
structures is generally “routine” or “periodic” as they continue to be fit-for-purpose even 
with significant deterioration in condition. In contrast, a broken pump or transformer is 
not  fit-for-purpose  has  to  be  replaced  immediately  and  is  regarded  as  a  “priority/ 
emergency” 
for 
maintenance  including  planning,  budgeting,  and  implementation  arrangements.  It  is 
anticipated that the database inventory (see Task 2A) may be expanded/ linked to a 
maintenance  budgeting  tool  to  facilitate  preparation  of  maintenance  budgets.  The 
maintenance planning and budgeting guideline will be approved by the respective IMC 
and endorsed for adoption by the respective Provincial Peoples Committee.

(Surface and Groundwater) and Water Allocation Framework  
A. 
Background 
1. 
The  southern  central  coastal  and  central  highland  regions  of  Viet  Nam  face  significant 
inter-annual variability of rainfall due to localized weather patterns, uneven flows and the influence 
of El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The 2014−2016 ENSO drought was the most severe in 
40 years; the rainfall deficit during the 2015 monsoon period ranged from 40%−70% below the 
long-term  average.  Around  60,000  hectares  of  agricultural  land  in  the  central  highlands  was 
affected  in  varying  degrees,  including  permanent  loss  of  perennial  crops  such  as  coffee  and 
pepper.    
2. 
The Water Efficiency Improvement in Drought-Affected Provinces Project (WEIDAP) was 
predicated by the 2014-2016 El Nino which caused considerable water scarcity in Khanh Hoa, 
Ninh  Thuan,  Binh  Thuan,  Dak  Lak  and  Dak  Nong.  The  project  will  modernize  eight  irrigation 
systems to improve the reliability of supply of water to farmers growing high-value crops. This will 
increase the water productivity of agriculture. Currently the project area is irrigated with rainfed 
irrigation systems and groundwater.  
The detail water resource is assessed in the feasibility study of subprojects conducted by 
3. 
the Institute for Water Resources Planning (IWRP) in 2016-2017. The assessment quantified 85% 
reliability of water balance for exist crops and expanded crops in subproject area based on water 
resources  assessment  and  water  demand  calculation  of  all  water  users.  The  study  used  all 
available data in the project area, however the similarity catchment method is applied for several 
river basins where the measured water resource data is not availability. In overall project area, 
the measured data is limited and low level of reliability over the region. Groundwater information 
is very scattered and unknown rate of irrigated area using groundwater and surface water. Water 
use information is in high variability ranges for each crop. Therefore, the water allocation plan is 
not carry out in the study due to the difficulty in available data and implement mechanism of the 
plan.  
The  water  supply  plans  for  irrigation  systems  are  currently  based  on  the  management 
4. 
experience of irrigation management company (IMC), it’s built separately for each crop season 
according to the production plan of the local government. These plans are not flexibility with water 
shortage – drought condition and the high variability of crop water demand in the irrigation area.

A. 
Background 
Recently, with the rapid development of science and technology, it is now possible to real-
1. 
time  inform  and  warn  people  about  proper  irrigation  schedule  and  watering  for  crops  where 
remote sensing and GSM networks and internet service are much better than ever. However, the 
actual situation in the project area, the irrigation of crops is mainly based on the experience as 
well as concerns about the lack of irrigation water, so farmers often over-irrigation needed when 
there  is  water.  It  is  necessary  to  have  a  data collection and processing  center  and share with 
people in real time the water source and water demand of the plant at each day so that the people 
have the basis for irrigation. 
2. 
At present, there are no irrigation guidelines and regulations for water schedule of some 
the key up-land crops in the project area. Developing irrigation schedule for crops is an important 
determinant of the efficiency of using surface water. Establishment of real-time irrigation services 
for  farmers  based  on  remote  sensing  data  is  the  application  of  advanced  technology  in  the 
implementation of irrigation services to farmers for efficient and economical use of water. 
3. 
Community  awareness  is  the  key  factor  in  the  implementation  of  modern  water-saving 
irrigation,  other  technical  assistance  in  applying  irrigation  in  real  time,  managing  irrigation  and 
allocating irrigation water. The water productivity index of the crop as well as the price of water 
under the Irrigation Law come into effect from July 1, 2017.

Micro Irrigation 
A. 
Background 
1. 
The Water Efficiency Improvement in Drought-Affected Provinces Project (WEIDAP) is a 
project  that  responds  to the  severe  drought  conditions  experienced  in the  south-central  coast, 
and  central  highlands  region  of  Viet  Nam  in  the  period  2012-2016.  It  also  responds  to  the 
anticipated changes in water availability predicted under the influence of climate variability. The 
project  addresses  three  strategic  areas  to  improve  water  use  efficiency  in  these  drought 
vulnerable areas including (i) the planning and allocation of water resources both between and 
within  the  agricultural  sector,  (ii)  the  more  efficient  distribution  of  water  resources  for  irrigated 
agriculture, and (iii) the more efficient on-farm water management that includes crop application 
methods. Terms of reference outlined here relate to the latter output concerning the adoption of 
on-farm  efficient  application  technologies.  Under  this  output,  activities  will  focus  on  (i)  the 
provision of technical support services to farmers within subproject command areas to support 
their adoption of micro irrigation systems, and (ii) linked up with private sector suppliers and be 
provided training in operation and maintenance (O&M) of micro irrigation systems. 
2. 
The services contract will be recruited by the Central Project Management Unit located 
within the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development’s Central Project Office. The contract 
will be an output-based contract and deliverables will be agreed with the winning bidder upon the 
evaluation  of  the  technical  and  financial  proposals  submitted.  The  single  contract  will  ensure 
consistency in delivery of technical support services as well as in the implementation of the grant 
scheme directed at the poor. The contract will be financed by ADB loan funds that are allocated 
to each of the participating provinces (Binh Thuan, Ninh Thuan, Khanh Hoa, Dak Lak and Dak 
Nong) and invoices submitted by the service provider to the CPMU will need to be approved by 
the  beneficiary  province  before  funds  can  be  released  under  the  contract  from  the  provincial 
project  management  units.  This  arrangement,  although  somewhat  cumbersome,  is  unlikely  to 
cause delays in payments as long as the claimed deliverables are concurred by the provinces.

107     Appendix 10      
Appendix 10: Project Performance Management System 
A. 
Introduction 
1. 
The  project  performance  management  system  (PPMS)  is  a  results-based  approach  to 
project  planning,  performance  monitoring,  and  evaluation  of  results.  Performance  is  largely 
measured and evaluated against the Design and Monitoring Framework, for achievement at two 
levels: (i) outcome and impact, and (ii) outputs and activities. The project design and monitoring 
framework has been appended as Appendix 1 to RRP. Safeguards and financial aspects are also 
assessed and monitored.  
Systematic  monitoring  allows  the  various  project  performance  reports  (PPRs)  to  be 
2. 
prepared providing information on project implementation and progress in achieving development 
outcome and impact, as well as adherence to the various safeguard plans. These will be reviewed 
by the executing and implementing agencies as well as ADB, in various review missions. At the 
end of the project, the project completion report (PCR) summarizes achievements and lessons 
learnt. 
In  this  section,  the  PPMS  system  is  described,  complete  with  the  monitoring  and 
3. 
evaluation implementation arrangements and responsibilities. 
B. 
Monitoring Scope and Implementing Arrangement 
4. 
Five kinds of monitoring will be carried out including: (i) activity/ implementation progress 
and  output  monitoring,  (ii)  outcome/  benefit  monitoring  and  evaluation;  (iii)  environment, 
resettlement, social and gender safeguards monitoring; (iv) loan agreement covenant monitoring; 
and  (iv)  financial  monitoring/  audit.  The  bulk  of  monitoring  and  reporting  will  fall  under  the 
consultancy contract for the construction engineering support consultants, together with MARD, 
and supported by various other contracts, as follows: 
• 
• 
Independent environmental monitoring contract to monitor adherence to the environment 
management plan 
Independent social safeguards monitoring contract to monitor adherence to resettlement 
and gender action plans 
•  M&E contract to carryout baseline and annual surveys in (selected) subprojects. 
• 
Independent financial audit contract for financial audits. 
Implementation progress and output monitoring 
5. 
The  construction  engineering  support  consultants  (CESC)  will  design  and  establish  a 
monitoring and evaluation system to report on achievements under each output. However, most 
the data will be collected/ provided by others, including from studies/ contracts funded by project 
as well as from the IMCs. 
6. 
Ideally  a  simple  data  base  will  be  developed  and  maintained  by  the  CESCs  to  track 
progress of activities and achievement of outputs, otherwise spreadsheets/ word documents may 
be used. The suggested structure for the database/ monitoring systems, following the DMF, is as 
follows: 
108 
Appendix 10 
•  Module 1: Irrigation management services strengthened 
o  1a: water allocations between crops and other users. This is closely related to the 
following  study,  “Water  resources  assessment  (surface  and  groundwater),  and 
water allocation framework”. Water use / allocations will be monitored for selected 
SPs. 
o  1b: recovery of O&M. This is closely related to the following study, “Water charging 
framework,  identifying  institutional  arrangements  and  preparing  protocols  to 
engage service providers to operate modernized irrigation systems”. Adoption of 
water  charging,  charge  amounts,  and  collection  rates  /  achievement  will  be 
monitored in (selected) SPs. 
o  1c:  irrigation  asset  condition  reports  prepared  and  used  for  budgeting.  This  is 
closely related to the following study: “Development of software and guidelines for 
subproject  management.  Adoption  and  use  of  effective  systems  to  track 
engineering assets and use for budgeting will be monitored in (selected) SPs. 
•  Module 2: Modernized irrigation infrastructures developed 
o  For  each  SP  list  proposed  engineering  works,  and  track  physical  construction 
progress each quarter. Evaluation would be against planned progress. 
•  Module 3: Efficient on-farm water management practices adopted 
o  3a  &  3b:  at  least  10,000  ha  irrigated  using  on-farm  micro  irrigation  and  at  least 
1,500 farmers receive training on improving water productivity on-farm. Data would 
largely be from the contractor implementing “Technical support for High Efficiency 
Irrigation  Systems  and  implementation/  administration  of  Micro  Irrigation.”  Data 
would be collected and disaggregated for each SP. 
•  Module 4: Contracts utilization and disbursement – for each contract track fund utilization 
or financial disbursement for the whole project. 
The  CESC  will  be  responsible  for  introducing  the  monitoring  system  into  the 
7. 
DARD/PPMUs and for training the local M&E staff on the collection of data against established 
indicators as well as progress reporting required every quarter to ADB and provincial and national 
governments.  
The  progress  will  be  reported  against  the  agreed  contract  timetable  for  completion  of 
8. 
works and other deliverables with reports reporting against these deliverable measures. 
Where possible, the progress reporting will incorporate opinions of that will be obtained 
9. 
from interviews of samples of beneficiaries within the command areas. The beneficiary communes 
will  also  be  consulted  to  obtain  their  views  as  to  implementation  progress  and  to  raise  any 
potential implementation issues in the process.  
Outcome Monitoring & Evaluation 
10. 
Outcome/  benefit  monitoring  and  evaluation  will  be  carried  out  on  an  annual  basis  to 
ensure that the intended project benefits are received and that the distribution of benefits amongst 
households in the irrigation command areas is reasonably equitable.  
Appendix 10         109 
The  essential  first  phase  of  outcome  and  impact  monitoring  is  to  establish  a  baseline 
11. 
against which project impacts can be measured. While a baseline survey was undertaken during 
preparation, a more comprehensive study is needed against which impacts can be measured - 
particularly the distribution of benefits. Thereafter, surveys of (selected) subproject (SP) will be 
conducted, each year initially and then after a longer, 5-10-year gap. Surveys are proposed for 
two SPs located in coastal provinces and two in highland provinces. Outcome/ impact monitoring 
surveys will be tendered and carried out under contract. The field surveys should be done at the 
same time each year, in the mid/ late dry season, from March to May. In addition to field surveys 
the  following  data  sources  will  be  used:  (i)  Progress  reports  and  data;  (ii)  IMC/  operator  data/ 
records/ reports from various studies supported by the project, e.g.,  Development of Technical 
Systems for  SP  Management, Water  Productivity  (baseline  and  crop  water  productivity  advice 
service), etc. 
•  M&E Field surveys by 3rd party contractors (1-3 weeks the field in selected SPs), with HH 
and group interviews (questionnaires and discussion checklists to be developed) 
Design of the survey instruments will be by the CESC M&E specialist in consultation with 
12. 
others, including the social, gender and communications specialist, and the CPO/PMU and PPMU 
appointed  monitoring  and  social  specialists.  It  will  include  household  and  group  interview 
questionnaires and checklists. Special focus will be given to the poor and vulnerable groups. The 
survey will be standardized to allow comparison between subprojects. 
13. 
The Annual M&E reports would comprise the following sections: 
•  Status  of  SP  development 
(engineering  works,  management  arrangement, 
implementation of irrigation service charge collection, etc.). 
•  Rainfall/ water availability in previous season (these distort/ affect annual findings). 
•  Groundwater depths / trends. 
•  Farmer  interest  and  connectivity  to  system,  volumes  of  irrigation  water  used  (pipe 
systems) / irrigation practices, payment of ICS, etc. 
•  Adoption of on-farm micro irrigation. 
•  Crop areas, crop types, yields, prices, marketing, etc. 
•  Social/ wealth indicators and distribution of benefits.
