Project Administration Manual for Project Readiness Financing: Purpose and Process 
The project administration manual (PAM) for the project readiness financing (PRF) facility is an abridged 
version  of  the  regular  PAM  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  describes  the  essential 
administrative and management requirements to implement the PRF facility following the policies and 
procedures of the government and ADB. The PAM should include references to all available templates 
and instructions either by linking to relevant URLs or directly incorporated them in the PAM. 
The  Punjab  Irrigation  Department  (the  executing  agency)  and  Punjab  Agriculture  Department  (the 
implementing agency) are wholly responsible for the implementation of ADB-financed PRF projects, as 
agreed  jointly  between  the  borrower  and  ADB,  and  following  the  policies  and  procedures  of  the 
Government and ADB. ADB staff is responsible for supporting implementation, including compliance by 
the  executing  and  implementing  agencies  of  their  obligations  and  responsibilities  for  PRF  project 
implementation following ADB’s policies and procedures. 
In the event of any discrepancy or contradiction between the PAM and the loan agreement, the provisions 
of the PRF loan agreement will prevail. 
After  ADB’s  approval  of  the  PRF  proposal,  changes  in  implementation  arrangements  are  subject  to 
agreement and approval pursuant to relevant government and ADB administrative procedures (including 
the Project Administration Instructions) and upon such approval, they will be subsequently incorporated 
in this PAM.

FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT 
A. 
Financial Management Assessment 
The  financial  management  assessment  of  the  executing  agency,  Punjab  Irrigation 
5.  
Department  (PID),  and  the  implementing  agency,  Punjab  Agriculture  Department  (PAD),  was 
conducted in 2017 and updated more recently in July 2019,1 following ADB’s Guidelines for the 
Financial Management and Analysis of Projects and the Financial Due Diligence: A Methodology 
Note.2 PAD  is  expected  to  serve  as  an  implementing  agency  of  an  on-farm  command  area 
development  component  under  the  ensuing  loans,  while  it  will  not  be  involved  in  an  financial 
transaction during the PRF implementation. The financial management assessment considered 
the financial management capacity, including funds-flow arrangements, staffing, accounting and 
financial  reporting  systems,  financial  information  systems,  and  internal  and  external  auditing 
arrangements. Based on the assessment, the key financial management risks identified were lack 
of  internal  audit  arrangement,  shortage  of  accounting  staff  for  PID  and  PAD  and  high  ratio  of 
Operations and Maintenance (O&M) cost in budget allocation. The government, and PID have 
agreed  to  implement  an  action  plan  as  key  measures  to  address  the  deficiencies  for  the  PRF 
implementation. Key measures are: (i) adoption of the Financial Management Manual and tailor 
it accordingly to the need of the project; (ii) establishment and timely hiring of relevant positions 
in  finance  and  accounting;  (iii)  timely  opening  of  an  advance  account;  and  (iv)  preparation  for 
retroactive  financing  arrangement  based  on  the  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2017,  as 
amended from time to time) and the Financial Management Manual. The overall pre-mitigation 
financial management (FM) risk rating was specifically concluded as substantial. Nevertheless, 
there is sufficient FM capacity to render the use of advance fund and the statement of expenditure 
(SOE) procedure suitable for the executing and implementing agency within the limits defined in 
section B, Disbursement below. The financial management, internal control and risk assessment 
used to derive the FM risk rating and the associated recommendations are given in the financial 
management action plan below.

The MOF and Punjab Government shall ensure the timely 
release of counterpart funds, as per loan covenants. PID 
shall  ensure  its  annual  budget  is  allocated  and  available 
during the fiscal year. 
The PID is already experienced in implementing ADB and 
World Bank financed irrigation projects. 
For  Financial  Management,  conduct  training  annually  on 
ADB  procedures  even  though  the  PID  is  experienced  in 
ADB  procedures,  vigilance 
land  acquisition  and 
resettlement  activities,  frequent  risk  reassessments  and 
timely  project  progress  reporting  and  diligent  complaint 
management should be exercised.

Remarks/Risk Mitigation Measures 
PID  has  experience  of  executing  externally  financed 
projects funded by ADB and World Bank. 
A  rule-based  mechanism  for  fund  flow  is  available  and 
governed  under  rules  of  the  Government  of  Pakistan’s 
Ministry  of  Finance:  Revolving  fund  account  (Advance 
Account)  and  direct  payment  procedure  can  be  suitably 
used by the executing agency/implementing agency. 
Staff is sufficient in number and well-trained to manage the 
project. Vacant positions in accounts department are being 
filled. 
Accounting standards and practices are based on IPSAS 
Standards  which  are  in  compliance  with  International 
Accounting Standards. 
All  payments  are  governed  under  the  government’s 
Financial Rules and Irrigation Department’s manuals. 
Government Financial Rules, New Accounting Manual and 
ADB disbursement procedures are the guiding principles. 
PID has separate bank accounts operated jointly with dual 
signatories and up to date cashbooks. 
Project  specific  fixed  assets  registers  are  available. 
Physical verification on periodical bases is conducted. 
PID does not have a permanent internal audit arrangement 
for  PMO  (e.g.  PMO  Barrages).  PID  and  the  provincial 
auditor will assist in internal auditing matters. 
Historical  data  suggests  that  in  some  instances  budget 
allocation  for  O&M  was  less  than  yardstick  or  estimated 
requirement of PID. However, an asset management plan 
has  resulted  in  improvements  in  budgetary  allocation, 
the  maintenance 
estimation  and  gradually  reduced 
backlog. PID has adopted a third party for the monitoring 
and evaluation of M&R works. The overall O&M allocation 
has  relatively  improved  in  recent  years  and  has  been 
sufficient in relation to actual expenditure. PID’s operations 
manual  provides  comprehensive  guidance  on  O&M  for 
barrages and the ADB assisted MFF program has further 
improved  the  technical  sustainability,  enhanced  and 
sustained water diversions and conveyance capacity, and 
reduced maintenance requirements in the short to medium 
term. 
Considering the current scale of the project, computerized 
Excel-based accounting ledgers are sufficient, however it 
is suggested that an off-the-shelf accounting software and 
decision support system to prioritize spending, especially 
O&M expenses, is implemented to ensure completeness 
and  accuracy  of  accounting  records,  and 
informed 
decision making. Needs assessment must be carried out.

Disbursement 
6. 
The Project Management Office (PMO) under the PID will disburse the project readiness 
loan proceeds following the ADB Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to 
time),3 and detailed arrangements agreed between the government and ADB. Online training for 
project staff on disbursement policies and procedures is available.4  Project staff are encouraged 
to  avail  of  his  training  to  help ensure  efficient  disbursement  and  fiducially  control.  The  direct 
payment  and  reimbursement procedures  will  normally  be  used  for  disbursements  under  the 
project  readiness  financing  (PRF).  The  PMO  will  be  responsible  for (i)  collecting  supporting 
documents, and (ii) preparing and sending withdrawal applications to ADB.  
7.  
Advance account. An advance account will be established at National Bank of Pakistan 
for receipt of funds from ADB. The currency of the advance account is United States dollar. The

12 
account is to be used exclusively for ADB’s share of eligible expenditures. The PMO of the PID 
who  administers  the  advance  account  is  accountable  and  responsible  for  the  proper  use  of 
advances to the advance account.  
Considering  the  financial  arrangements  of  the  PID’s  current  ADB  project,  the  advance 
8.  
fund limit is set to the advance equivalent to 6 months forecast or 10% of the loan amount. These 
financial  arrangements  are  the  same  as  the  ones  being  applied  to  the  currently  implemented 
projects by PID.5  
9.  
Statement  of  expenditure  procedures.  The  PMO  may  use  the  SOE  procedure  for 
reimbursement of eligible expenditures.6 The ceiling of the SOE procedure is the equivalent of 
$100,000  per  individual  payment.  Supporting  documents  and  records  for  the  expenditures 
claimed under the SOE should be maintained and made readily available for review by ADB's 
disbursement and review missions, upon ADB's request for submission of supporting documents 
on  a  sampling  basis  and  for  independent  audit.  Reimbursement  and  liquidation  of  individual 
payments  in  excess  of  the  SOE  ceiling  should  be  supported  by  full  documentation  when 
submitting the withdrawal application to ADB. 
10. 
Before submitting the first withdrawal application, the government should submit to ADB 
sufficient evidence of the authority of the person(s) who will sign the withdrawal applications on 
behalf of the government, together with the authenticated specimen signatures of each authorized 
person.  The minimum value per withdrawal application is stipulated in ADB’s Loan Disbursement 
Handbook. Individual payments below such amount should be paid by the PID and subsequently 
claimed to ADB through reimbursement unless otherwise accepted by ADB. The borrower should 
ensure sufficient category and contract balances before requesting disbursements. Use of ADB’s 
Client Portal for Disbursements system is encouraged for submission of withdrawal applications 
to ADB.7 
11.   No further disbursements will be made from the PRF account upon refinancing under an 
ensuing or ongoing loan. The PRF loan amount and accrued financing charges are paid out under 
the PRF cost category of the ensuing or ongoing loan that will refinance the PRF loan. Provided 
the following  costs  are  eligible  expenditures,  the ensuing  or  ongoing  loan  will  finance  (i)  costs 
incurred under PRF that have not yet been paid from the PRF account by the refinancing date; 
(ii) costs for activities initiated under PRF and contributing beyond the refinancing date; and (iii) 
costs incurred during PRF implementation but ineligible under PRF.  
5  The PAD will not be provided advance funds under the PRF. 
6  SOE forms are available in Appendix 7B of ADB’s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to 
time). 
7  The Client Portal for Disbursements facilitates online submission of WA to ADB, resulting in faster disbursement. 
The  forms  to  be  completed  by  the  Borrower  are  available  online  at  https://www.adb.org/documents/client-portal-
disbursements-guide.

Accounting  
12. 
The PID will maintain separate PRF project accounts and records by funding source for 
all  expenditures  incurred  on  the  PRF  project.  The  project  accounts  will  be  prepared  using  the 
cash basis of accounting as prescribed in the International Public Sector Accounting Standards 
issued by the International Public Sector Accounting Board, which is a member of the International 
Federation of Accountants.  
D. 
Auditing and Public Disclosure  
13.  
The PID will cause the project financial statements to be audited following the International 
Standards on Auditing by an independent auditor acceptable to ADB. The PID will present the 
audited project financial statements together with the auditor’s opinion, in English, to ADB within 
6 months from the end of the fiscal year.  
14 
The audit report for the project financial statements will include a management letter and 
14. 
auditor’s opinions, which cover (i) whether the project financial statements present an accurate 
and  fair  view  or  are  presented  fairly,  in  all  material  respects,  following  the  applicable  financial 
reporting standards; (ii) whether the proceeds of the loan were used only for the purpose(s) of the 
project; and (iii) whether the borrower or executing agency  complied with the financial covenants 
contained in the legal agreements (where applicable). 
15. 
The PID will monitor compliance with financial reporting and auditing requirements during 
review missions and normal program supervision and will followed up regularly with all concerned, 
including the external auditor.  
16. 
ADB  has  made  the  government  and  the  PID  aware  of  ADB’s  approach  to  delayed 
submission  and the requirements for satisfactory  and  acceptable quality  of the  audited  project 
financial  statements.8 ADB  reserves  the  right  to  require  a  change  in  the  auditor  (in  a  manner 
consistent  with  the constitution  of the  borrower) or for  additional  support  to  be  provided  to the 
auditor, if the audits required are not conducted in a manner satisfactory to ADB, or if the audits 
are  substantially  delayed.  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  verify  the  project's  financial  accounts  to 
confirm that its policies and procedures were followed when the share of ADB’s financing was 
used.  
ADB’s Access to Information Policy 2018 will guide the public disclosure of the audited 
17. 
project financial statements, including the auditor’s opinion on the project financial statements. 
After the review, ADB will disclose the audited project financial statements and the opinion of the 
auditors on the project financial statements no later than 14 days of ADB’s confirmation of their 
acceptability by posting them on its website. The management letter, additional auditor’s opinions, 
and audited entity financial statements will not be disclosed.9 
8  ADB’s approach and procedures regarding delayed submission of audited project financial statements:  
(i)  When audited project financial statements are not received by the due date, ADB will write to the executing agency 
advising  that  (a) the audit  documents  are overdue;  and  (b)  if  they  are  not  received  within  the next  6  months, 
requests for new contract awards and disbursement such as new replenishment of advance accounts, processing 
of new reimbursement, and issuance of new commitment letters will not be processed. 
(ii)  When audited project financial statements are not received within 6 months after the due date, ADB will withhold 
processing  of  requests  for  new  contract  awards  and  disbursement  such  as  new  replenishment  of  advance 
accounts, processing of new reimbursement, and issuance of new commitment letters. ADB will (a) inform the 
executing agency of ADB’s actions; and (b) advise that the loan may be suspended if the audit documents are 
not received within the next 6 months. 
(iii) When  audited  project  financial  statements  are  not  received  within  12  months  after  the  due  date,  ADB  may 
suspend the loan.

VI. 
SAFEGUARDS   
28. 
Since  the  PRF  activities  consist  of  consulting  services  only,  activities  have  not  been 
categorized  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  The  safeguard 
classification for the ensuing loan of the Greater Thal Canal Irrigation Project is expected as ‘A’ 
for environment, and ‘C’ for involuntary resettlement. The safeguard classifications for the other 
ensuing loans are not yet known. No adverse impact from the ensuing projects are expected for 
indigenous peoples (Category C). For the ensuing loans, the PRF will finance the preparation of 
necessary safeguard documents. 
29. 
Prohibited  investment  activities.  Pursuant  to  ADB’s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement 
(2009),  ADB  funds  may  not  be  applied  to  the  activities  described  on  the  ADB  Prohibited 
Investment Activities List set forth at Appendix 5 of the Safeguard Policy Statement.  
21 
VII. 
PERFORMANCE MONITORING 
A. 
Monitoring and Evaluation 
Project  readiness  financing  project  performance  monitoring:  The  PID  will  monitor 
30. 
PRF project performance semiannually and provide consolidated reports to ADB. These reports 
will  include  (i)  key  implementation  issues  and  solutions,  (ii)  each  activity’s  progress  measured 
against  the  implementation  schedule,  (iii)  an  updated  procurement  plan,  and  (iv)  an  updated 
implementation plan for the next 12 months. To ensure PRF projects continue to be both viable 
and  sustainable,  the  PID  should  adequately  review  PRF  project  financial  statements  and  the 
associated auditor's report. In the event that an ensuring loan is not approved, the PID will submit 
a  PRF  project  completion  report  to  ADB  within  6  months  of  physical  completion  of  the 
PRF project.11 
Compliance  monitoring:  The  PID  will  submit  the  status  of  covenants  on  policy,  legal, 
31. 
financial, environmental, and others in its project performance monitoring report.  
32. 
Safeguards monitoring: Since activities consist of consulting services only, the PRF has 
not been categorized in accordance with ADB’s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). No action is 
required.  
B. 
Reporting  
33. 
The PID will provide ADB with: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
semi-annual progress reports on the PRF project in a format consistent with ADB's 
project performance reporting system; 
consolidated annual reports, including (a) progress achieved by output measured 
against the performance targets, (b) key implementation issues and solutions; (c) 
an updated procurement plan, and (d) an updated implementation plan for next 12 
months;12 and 
PRF project accounts, the PID’s audited financial statements, and the associated 
auditor's report.
11 Project completion report format is available at: http://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/pai-6-07-a.pdf  
12 The regional departments will present the performance of the completed PRF in the project completion report of the 
ensuing loan.  
22 
VIII.  ANTICORRUPTION POLICY 
34. 
ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any violations of the 
Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  relating  to  the  PRF  project  following  ADB’s 
Integrity  Principles  and  Guidelines. 13  All  contracts  financed  by  ADB  will  include  provisions 
specifying ADB’s right to audit and examine the records and accounts of the executing agency 
and all PRF project contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers. This includes 
the  examination  of  project  outputs,  assets,  and  all  other  information  that  may  be  considered 
relevant  for  audit  or  inspection  by  ADB  regardless  of  project  completion,  termination,  or 
cancellation.  Firms  or  individuals  on  ADB’s  anticorruption  debarment  list  are  ineligible  to 
participate  in  activities  that  are  financed,  supported,  or  administered  by  ADB;  and  may  not  be 
awarded any contracts under the PRF project.14

ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISM 
People who are, or may in the future be, adversely affected by the PRF project may submit 
36. 
complaints  to  ADB’s  Accountability  Mechanism.  The  Accountability  Mechanism  provides  an 
independent  forum  and  process  whereby  people  adversely  affected  by  ADB-assisted  PRF 
projects can voice and seek a resolution of their problems, as well as report alleged violations of 
ADB’s operational policies and procedures. Before submitting a complaint to the Accountability 
Mechanism, affected people should make an effort in good faith effort to solve their problems by 
working with the concerned ADB operations department.  Only after doing that, and if they are 
still dissatisfied, should they approach the Accountability Mechanism.15

I. 
BACKGROUND 
Pakistan’s population of 210 million in 2017 is projected to reach 229 million in 2025. The 
1. 
increase in population combined with improved living standards will require 40% to 50% additional 
food  by  2025.  This  additional  food  can  be  achieved  through  expanded  irrigated  area  and 
agricultural  productivity,  wherever  opportunities  exist.  Increased  agriculture  activities  will  also 
contribute  to  job  creation  and  poverty  reduction  in  the  province’s  rural  communities.  Punjab, 
Pakistan’s  second  largest  province,  contributes  about  80%  to  the  country’s  food  requirements 
and  57% to the  production  value  of  the country’s  agriculture. Irrigated  agriculture  accounts for 
more  than  26%  of  Punjab’s  gross  domestic  product  and  employs  over  40%  of  its  labor  force. 
Punjab manages an existing irrigation system serving 8.4 million hectare (ha) irrigated land. The 
value of Punjab’s irrigation infrastructure has been estimated at $20 billion (2005-06 estimates). 
2. 
Agriculture  production  in  Punjab  has  benefitted  from  the  Indus  Basin  Irrigation  System 
(IBIS) that provides irrigation water to 15 million ha of land, of which about 60% lies in Punjab. 
The  IBIS  is  the  lifeline  of  the  Punjab  agriculture  sector.  However,  deteriorated  century-old 
structures and inefficient water management within irrigation schemes and /or on farm resulted to 
the unreliable surface irrigation water delivery in the IBIS. Some cultivable lands in Punjab remain 
outside of the IBIS and relay on unpredictable scarce rainfall or ground water that may lower the 
water table. Although the Government of Punjab has placed a high priority on improving irrigation 
infrastructure  and  its  efficiency1,  additional  efforts  are  required  for  improved  agriculture 
productivity and water use efficiency to achieve economic growth target and food security in the 
province.  
3. 
Among  the  priority  projects  identified  by  the  Punjab  provincial  government  to  improve 
irrigation infrastructure that will enhance water availability and, thus, increase productivity of the 
agriculture sector; four projects involve construction, rehabilitation, remodeling, and upgradation 
of irrigation canals. A list of these priority projects is in Table 1.

1  The Punjab Irrigation Department (PID) has taken actions by working closely with ADB, the World Bank, and Japan 
International  Cooperation  Agency  for  the  improvement  of  irrigated  agriculture.  ADB’s  $700  million  multitranche 
financing facility for Punjab Irrigated Agriculture Investment Program has successfully supported the improvement of 
the irrigation infrastructure, on-farm agriculture of over 2 million ha, and institutional reforms.

The provincial government, through the Government of Pakistan, has requested the Asian 
Development  Bank  (ADB)  to  provide  support  for  improved  project  preparation  of  these  priority 
projects. A project readiness financing (the PRF) is proposed as the financing modality. 
II. 
OBJECTIVES OF THE ASSIGNMENT 
5. 
The PRF will support accomplishing high project preparation readiness of these priority 
projects by (i) reviewing and revising the feasibility studies and making up their deficiencies to 
ensure the efficacy and compliance with funding agency’s requirements; (ii) preparing detailed 
design and procurement documents; and (iii) providing other project readiness support.  
6. 
Feasibility  studies  for  the  Package  I  priority  projects  were  carried  out  by  various 
consultants. The detailed design of Greater Thal Canal (Phase-III) was also carried out previously. 
The proposed consulting services package will: (i) scrutinize the priority of the projects; (ii) review 
/ update existing feasibility studies; (iii) conduct detailed engineering design, including preparation 
of  drawings  and  priced  bill  of  quantities  for  all  priority  projects  (for  GTC  project,  the  existing 
WAPDA detailed design will be updated while for the other three projects, detailed design will be 
prepared)  and  (iv)  provide  project  readiness  support,  including  the  preparation  of  bidding 
documents and PC-Is for all priority projects. The priority of projects may be updated during the 
PRF. Detailed design of individual projects will be conducted / updated sequentially, starting from 
higher priority or urgent project(s).

way  as  to  fit  it  into  the  available  time  span  in  the  proposed  construction 
schedule.  Construction  equipment,  crews,  materials  and  other  resources 
would be adjusted to accomplish the work within the required time span. The 
computations  or  unit  prices  shall  be  supported  by  detailed  sets  or  financial 
price with source. 
indirect  cost  of  construction  for  all  major  items  should  be  established 
separately.  Total  cost  of  each  construction  item  shall  then  be  obtained  by 
multiplying  the  direct  cost  of  construction  by  a  bid  factor  representing  the 
influence of indirect cost. 
 
preparation  or  cost  estimates  of  the  project  broken  into  local  and  foreign 
components. These shall include: 
 
reasonable breakdown by major items or electro-mechanical and civil works 
or  canal  /  irrigation  network.  Price  for  major  civil  works  and  permanent 
equipment shall be estimated on the basis of internationally advertised open 
competitive bidding (OCB).

          Project Administration Manual – Attachment (Terms of Reference 1)         35 
Reporting Requirements:  
56.  
The consultants will have a dual reporting function to the Executing Agency (EA) and ADB. 
The consultants will prepare the following reports in English with Arial font (12 for headings and 
11 for body text). The tables should use 10 Arial. The consultant will submit Table of Contents 
(TOC) for each report for prior approval of the client. A brief description of some important reports 
is given below. 
(i) 
(ii) 
Quarterly  Progress  Report:  Ten  copies  of  Quarterly  Progress  Reports  shall  be 
presented  quarterly  before  the  10th  day  of  the  subsequent  quarter  and  shall  indicate 
progress of the implementation of the consultancy contract.  The issues that may hinder 
implementation  as  planned  shall  be  flagged  in  these  reports  along  with  the  suggested 
solutions. 
Resettlement  Plans:  The  project  falls  in  “Category  A”  under  ADB’s  resettlement 
guidelines meaning that there may likely be significant impacts for at least 200 persons 
due to the project. Based on this reclassification, the TA Consultants have developed a 
draft  resettlement  framework,  and  resettlement  action  plan  (RAP)  for  a  subproject  that 
was likely to encounter the greatest resettlement impacts. The ADB and Government of 
Punjab  have  agreed  to  the  following  principles  with  regard  to  resettlement  under  the 
project: 
 
the approach to resettlement under the project should not be to remove all persons 
who have encroached on the right of way(s), but to move only those persons who 
will be directly affected,  
  design will be drafted with the objective of minimizing resettlement activities, and  
  contract packages and execution of civil works will be directed in such a way to 
minimize resettlement activities.  
The  Consultants  would assist  PMO  in  updating the  RAP  prepared  during  PPTA  on  the 
basis of the detailed design and assist PMO in preparing RAP to meet funding agency’s 
requirements for any other area affecting more than 200 persons.  
(iii)  Draft and Final Design Criteria: The Consultants shall prepare the draft design criteria 
for  review  by  the  Client. The final  design  criteria  shall  be  prepared  after incorporating  / 
remedying the comments made by the Client. 
(iv)  Detailed Engineering Design Report: Both the draft and final version of Detailed Design 
Report shall be prepared separately. The Report shall comprise of sections / sub-sections 
covering detailed field surveys, investigations and all types of engineering and economic 
studies. The Report shall consist of detailed design after incorporating comments of the 
Client.  The  reference  of  the  formulae  used  in  calculations  will  be  mentioned  in  the 
calculation  sheets  in  the  remarks  column  for  ease  of  review.  Soft  copy  of  the  design 
calculations in Excel with formula format or any other software used will be submitted with 
the design reports. 
Tender  drawings  and  Construction  Drawings:  Based  on  the  detailed  design  carried 
out, the consultants shall prepare tender drawings as well as construction drawings for all 
facets of the construction works.  
(v) 
(vi)  Engineer’s  Estimate:  Prepare  the  Engineer’s  Estimate  of  the  expected  cost  of 
construction immediately prior to the finalization of bidding documents.  This estimate shall 
be based on the most up-to-date assessment of construction rates prevailing at the time 
and  shall  include  all  items  such  as  contractor’s  mobilization  and  insurance  costs, 
allowance for all necessary provisional sums and estimated day works, and contingencies.

SUMMARY OF FOUR PRIORITY PROJECTS 
PROJECT A: Remodeling and Upgrading of Dera Ghazi Khan Canal System 
Feasibility Study Consultants: Joint Venture of Engineering & Agricultural Service Entity-
Pakistan and Quality Engineering and Consultancy Services 
Culturable Command Area: 384,082 ha (949,087 acre) 
Location: Dera Ghazi Khan and Rajanpur tehsils 
Estimated Cost: $68.00 million 
Status of Studies and Specific Issues: Dera Ghazi Khan Canal, a non-perennial channel, off 
taking from Taunsa Barrage on the right bank of river Indus was commissioned in 1959. DG Khan 
main canal was initially designed to carry 8,757 cusecs and later on remodeled to 11,549 cusecs 
as its authorized discharge. All structures on the main canal have been designed for the same 
discharge. It was anticipated at the time of designing of DG Khan Canal that area between DG 
Khan Canal and River Indus besides some partial area on the right side of DG Khan Canal would 
be irrigated through DG Khan Canal system, for which DG Khan Canal will be remodeled to carry 
a discharge of 14,503 cusec. Though the capacity of DG Khan was enhanced from 8,757 cusecs 
to  11,549  cusecs,  it  is  still  unable  to  carry  the  anticipated  discharge  of  11,549  cusecs  due  to 
problems  in  approach  angle  of  river  resulting  in  un-balanced  flow,  deterioration  of  banks, 
excessive berm growths and due to abnormal silt deposit in the bed of channel which ranges from 
1 ft to 2.5 ft in depth resulting incapacitation of the channel section. 
The  Feasibility  Study  for  Remodeling  and  Upgrading  of  Dera  Ghazi  Khan  Canal  System  was 
awarded to Joint Venture of Engineering & Agricultural Service Entity-Pakistan and Quality 
Engineering  and  Consultancy  Services  by  Executive  Engineer,  DG  Khan  Canal  Division.  The 
main objectives of the feasibility study were as follows: 
i) 
ii) 
iii) 
Due to construction of Kachi Canal on right side of D.G. Khan canal, flow pattern of hill 
torrent flood water across hill torrent crossing structure already constructed on D.G. Khan 
canal system has been changed. 
To carry out hydraulic survey of D.G. Khan Canal system, establish bottlenecks / problems 
in  feeding  D.G.  Khan  Canal  to  its  designed  discharge  and  propose  solution  for 
improvement of efficiency of D.G. Khan Canal system. 
There  is  chronic  tail  shortage  problem  especially  in  Rajanpur  Canal  Division  which 
requires detailed investigation and engineering solution to the problem. 
The feasibility study for D.G. Khan Canal was completed in January 2018 which indicated that 
the viability of the Project with high rate of return which is obvious on the count that if the system 
can  deliver  11,549  cusecs  against  the  presently  running  capacity  of  8,757  cusecs  only,  the 
difference is almost 1/3rd of the capacity and the rehabilitation would result in increase in intensity 
and yields both. The feasibility has been prepared for discharge of 11,549 cusecs however the 
structures have been checked for 14,503 cusecs, the ultimate discharge. 
PROJECT B:  Rehabilitation and Upgrading of Upper Jhelum Canal (UJC) System 
51359-001-PAK: Project Readiness Financing for Punjab Water Resources Management Projects 
Annexure A         43 
Feasibility  Study  Consultants:  Barqaab  Consulting  Services  (Pvt.)  Ltd.  (Lead),  Rehman 
Habib Consultants (Pvt.) Ltd. (JVP) and Engineering & Agricultural Service Entity-Pakistan 
(JVP)  
Culturable Command Area: 244,328 ha (603,749 acre) 
Location:  Between  Mangla  Dam  and  Khanki  Barrage.  The  canal  traverses  through  the 
districts of Jhelum, Gujrat, Mandi Bahauddin, and Gujranwala 
Estimated Cost: $174.00 million 
Status of Studies and Specific Issues: The Upper Jhelum Canal Project area lies to Longitude 
– 73 o 42’ 55” to 74 o 01’ 23” of East and Latitude – 32o 27’ 44” to 33o 05’ 36” of North and is located 
between Rim stations of Mangla on Jhelum River and New Khanki Barrage on Chenab River. The 
Upper Jhelum Canal traverses in districts of Jhelum, Gujrat, Mandi Bahuddin and Gujranwala. 
UJC was designed in 1905 and commissioned in 1915. The design discharge of UJC at the time 
of  commissioning  was  8,500  cs.  However,  in  1923  the  design  discharge  of  the  canal  was 
increased to  9,031  cs. The  canal  was  partly  remodeled  in  1982  on the request  of WAPDA for 
providing  1,800  cs  of  additional  water  to  Rasul  Hydropower  Station  but  head  discharge  was 
restricted  to  8,500  cs  due  to  abnormal  scour  in  the  head  reach.  Since  then  it  is  running  with 
restricted head discharge. 
UJC  is  designed  to  serve  as  a  Link  channel  connecting  River  Jhelum  with  River  Chenab  to 
mitigate the shortages of canal supply upstream of New Khanki Barrage. The off-taking system 
of New Khanki Barrage as Lower Chenab Canal (LCC) needs about 6,000 - 8000 cs during certain 
lean periods (Rabi season) from UJC Link channel.  
At present, the UJC is unable to deliver its authorized discharge of 8,500 cs and facing severe 
silting problems in the middle and tail reaches particularly reach RD 244+000 to 417+805 (Tail) 
is badly silted up. The recommended freeboard (FB) of 3 ft is not available in major portion of the 
canal sections and almost upstream of all hydraulic structures (bridges, falls, X-regulators and 
head  regulator  of  the  distributaries).  There  are  chances  of  breaches  due  to  weak  banks  and 
overflowing  sections,  especially  in  reach  downstream  of  Khokhra  Head Regulator.  Most  of the 
worn-out decking of bridges and regulators need replacement. The overall conveyance efficiency 
has significantly decreased and most of the Gates and Gearing systems have badly deteriorated. 
The Feasibility Study for Remodeling of Upper Jhelum Canal was awarded to Joint Venture of 
Barqaab  Consulting  Services  (Pvt.)  Ltd.  (Lead),  Rehman  Habib  Consultants  (Pvt.)  Ltd. 
(JVP)  and  Engineering  &  Agricultural  Service  Entity-Pakistan  (JVP)  in  February  2016  by 
Executive Engineer, Jhelum Division. The main objectives of this study were as follows: 
i) 
ii) 
iii) 
iv) 
To improve conveyance efficiency, reliability and durability of the system as per enhanced 
proposed discharged by rehabilitating / remodeling Upper Jhelum Canal. 
To ensure water supply for Rasul Power House. 
To ensure water supply at tail for Shadiwal Power House.  
To ensure irrigation supplies for Khanki heads in dry / rabi season. 
The feasibility study (FS) report was submitted in May 2017 and it has been discussed at various 
forums.  The  canal  and  structures  remodeling  will  (i)  increase  the  canal  capacity  at  head  from 
8,500 cubic feet per second (cfs) to 12,655 cfs; and (ii) enable two (02) power houses to achieve 
full  potential  of  33  megawatt  (MW)  up  from  current  generation  of  10  MW.  The  Consultants 
recommended the project being technically and economically viable on fast track basis to offset

44        Annexure A 
the shortage of River Chenab at New Khanki Barrage during the winter season. 
Several alternatives were investigated at the feasibility stage. However, the report has not been 
rigorously  reviewed  by  experts  and  hence  there  is  little  agreement  among  various  Punjab 
Irrigation Department (PID) specialists on the final solution. 
PROJECT  C:  Greater  Thal  Canal  (GTC)  Project  (Phase  III)  -  (Dhingana  Branch,  Nurpur 
Brach And Mahmood Sub Branch Systems) 
Detailed  Design  Consultants:  JV  of  National  Engineering  Services  Pakistan,  National 
Development Consultants (Pvt.) Ltd., Associated Consulting Engineers-ACE (Pvt.) Limited 
and  Barqaab  Consulting  Services  (Pvt.)  Ltd.  in  association  with  Engineering  General 
Consultants EGC (Pvt) Limited.   
Culturable Command Area: 440,850 ha (1,088,900 acre) 
Estimated Cost: $600 million 
Project Background: Greater Thal Canal Project, with a designed capacity of 8,500 cusec (240 
m3/s), aims at new irrigated agriculture development of 1.738 million acres (703,345 ha) CCA of 
land, in the eastern part of Thal Doab falling within the boundaries of Bhakkar, Layyah, Khushab, 
Jhang and Muzaffargarh districts. The project envisages increasing crop production from 12,032 
ton/ annum to 2,250,950 ton/ annum at full development ensuring food security for the increasing 
population of Pakistan. The project will not only result in boosting of economy but will also bring 
improvement in quality of life associated with socio-economic and socio-cultural changes in the 
life of poor people of the project area. 
The overall project comprises main canal (34 km length – lined) with 5 branch canals (Mankera, 
Chaubara, Dhingana, Nurpur and Mahmood Sub Branch) in a length of 341 km,  distributaries/ 
minors of about 2,000 km length. The Project PC-I amounting to Rs. 30,467 million was approved 
by ECNEC in 2002. The design capacity Greater Thal canal is 8,500 cusec with water allowance 
of 3.88 cusec/ 1000 acres. The Project feasibility study was prepared by the Consultants hired by 
WAPDA during 1992-94 and detailed design for the entire scheme was completed in 2007. 
Project Phasing: Greater Thal Canal (Phase-I) works, covering the construction of canals up to 
minors for a CCA of 0.356 million acres (144,068 ha), were completed under WAPDA during 2008 
at a cost of Rs. 10.17 billion. The GTC overall project was then handed over to Punjab Irrigation 
Department  in  October  2009  for  operation  and  implementation  of  remaining  two  phases.  The 
Phase II project (Choubara) was decided to be constructed by the provincial government, and the 
WAPDA detailed design was updated by the consultant engaged by the PID in 2017-2018. The 
PID and ADB agreed in April 2019 that the Choubara branch system construction will be shifted 
from the provincial government financing to ADB financing.  As regards the last Greater Thal 
Canal (Phase-III)  Project, the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  agreed to  include  it  in  the 
ensuing  ADB’s  Project  Readiness  Financing  Facility  (PRF)  for  developing  an  implementation 
project.  The  current  consulting  assignment  envisages,  amongst  others,  updating  the  project 
detailed  design  and  preparation  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plan,  social  safeguard 
documents, project PC-I and procurement documents including technical specifications etc.

PROJECT D: Remodeling of R-Q, Q-B & B-S Link Canals 
Feasibility Study Consultants: Joint Venture of National Engineering Services Pakistan 
(Pvt.) Limited (NESPAK), AAB (Pvt.) Limited (AAB), and Development and Management 
Consultants (DMC). 
Proposed Culturable Command Area: 1,083,159 ha (2,676,544 acres) 
Estimated Cost: $50.00 million 
Project Background: Rasul-Qadirabad (R-Q), Qadirabad-Balloki (Q-B), and Balloki-Suleimanki 
(B-S) Link Canal System is the water transfer system where the capacity enhancement is needed 
to remove capacity constraint for reducing water shortages in the canal commands served from 
this system and rehabilitating the structures where necessary. 
The  R-Q  Link  Canal  is  the  first  tier  of  three  link  canals  forming  Rasul-Qadirabad-Balloki-
Suleimanki Link System which connects four eastern rivers i.e. Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi and Sutlej. 
R-Q link offtakes from Rasul Barrage with a full supply discharge of 19,000 cusec. This unlined 
canal is 29 miles long, and outfalls into River Chenab upstream of Qadirabad Barrage. This Link 
Canal meets the water transfer requirement of Q-B Link, which in turn fulfills water requirement 
of canal systems offtaking from Balloki Barrage on River Ravi and Suleimanki and Islam Barrages 
on River Sutlej. 
Q-B Link Canal is the second tier in the inter-river water transfer system. With a design discharge 
of 25,000 cusec, this Link Canal takes off from Qadirabad Barrage and outfalls into Ravi River 
upstream of Balloki Barrage. Although the capacity of this canal has been increased from 18,500 
cusec  to  25,000  cusec,  the  structures  have  not  been  correspondingly  modified.  Therefore, 
51359-001-PAK: Project Readiness Financing for Punjab Water Resources Management Projects 
46        Annexure A 
backing  up  of  water  takes  places  at  various  regulation  structures  even  at  discharge  of  22,000 
cusec particularly at the aqueduct of Gajar Gola distributary and LCC Complex. The maximum 
discharge which is presently carried by the canal is only 22,000 cusec against the official figure 
of 25,000 cusec. 
The Balloki-Suleimanki Link Canal is the third and last segment of this inter-river transfer system. 
This Link canal offtakes from River Ravi at Balloki Barrage and flows in a southern direction for 
distance  of  53  miles  towards  River  Sutlej  where  its  outfalls  at  a  point  approximately  10  miles 
above Suleimanki Barrage. In June 1960, capacity of the Link was increased from 15,200 cusec 
to  18,500  cusec.  For  carrying  this  enhanced  discharge,  the  first  14  miles  unlined  reach  of  the 
canal was widened to accommodate additional 6,500 cusec, and thereafter a new (unlined) canal, 
was dug to run parallel to existing lined BS-I to carry additional discharge of 6,500 cusec. This 
parallel unlined canal is designated as Balloki-Suleimanki-II (BS-II) Link Canal. 
To  meet  the  increased  irrigation  demand  of  Sutlej  Valley  Canals,  BS  Link  Canal  System  was 
remodeled repeatedly by Irrigation Department, first from 18,600 cusec to 22,000 cusec, and then 
from 22,000 cusec to 24,500 cusec. In the most recent remodeling of canal in 2003-2005, the 
capacity of BS-II was raised from 6,500 cusec to 9,000 cusec. The BS-II Link runs parallel to the 
BS-I along its left, or up-doab side, for a distance of 38 miles and ends at tail regulator constructed 
adjacent to the outfall structure of the BS-I. The two Links discharge into a common outfall channel 
that extends about a mile into Sutlej River.

DETAILED DESIGN CONSULTANTS FOR  
HARNESSING OF HILL TORRENTS IN D. G. KHAN AND RAJANPUR 
I. 
BACKGROUND 
1. 
Pakistan’s population of 210 million in 2017 is projected to reach 229 million in 2025. The 
increase in population combined with improved living standards will require 40% to 50% additional 
food  by  2025.  This  additional  food  can  be  achieved  through  expanded  irrigated  area  and 
agricultural  productivity,  wherever  opportunities  exist.  Increased  agriculture  activities  will  also 
contribute  to  job  creation  and  poverty  reduction  in  the  province’s  rural  communities.  Punjab, 
Pakistan’s  second  largest  province,  contributes  about  80%  to  the  country’s  food  requirements 
and  57% to the  production  value  of  the country’s  agriculture. Irrigated  agriculture  accounts for 
more  than  26%  of  Punjab’s  gross  domestic  product  and  employs  over  40%  of  its  labor  force. 
Punjab manages an existing irrigation system serving 8.4 million hectare (ha) irrigated land. The 
value of Punjab’s irrigation infrastructure has been estimated at $20 billion (2005-06 estimates). 
2. 
Agriculture  production  in  Punjab  has  benefitted  from  the  Indus  Basin  Irrigation  System 
(IBIS) that provides irrigation water to 15 million ha of land, of which about 60% lies in Punjab. 
The  IBIS  is  the  lifeline  of  the  Punjab  agriculture  sector.  However,  deteriorated  century-old 
structures and inefficient water management within irrigation schemes and /or on farm resulted to 
the unreliable surface irrigation water delivery in the IBIS. Some cultivable lands in Punjab remain 
outside of the IBIS and relay on unpredictable scarce rainfall or ground water that may lower the 
water table. Although the Government of Punjab has placed a high priority on improving irrigation 
infrastructure  and  its  efficiency1,  additional  efforts  are  required  for  improved  agriculture 
productivity and water use efficiency to achieve economic growth target and food security in the 
province.  
3. 
Although  hill  torrents  in  D  G  Khan  and  Rajanpur,  and  the  area  they  traverse  before 
entering the Indus River, lie in the Indus basin, they are not part of the IBIS. The area of about 
100,000 hectares (ha) the hill torrents traverse, is currently used for crop production using spate 
irrigation,  residual  moisture  and  recharging  of  local  aquifers.  However,  there  is  potential  of 
improvement  in  spate  irrigation,  watershed  management  in the  catchment,  building reservoirs, 
flood protection and developing an irrigation network to cover a vast command area which will 
greatly help in meeting the food security targets of the country and improving livelihood of millions 
of  the  residents  of  the  area.  In  this  context,  the  Punjab  provincial  government  has  identified 
Harnessing of Hill Torrents in Dera Ghazi Khan and Rajanpur as one of the priority projects to 
improve water availability in the area and, thus, increase productivity of the agriculture sector. The 
project will also provide flood protection to the infrastructure in the area which includes residential 
and farm areas, roads, D G Khan Canal and Kachhi Canal. The Government has identified 13 
potential hill torrents that are expected to serve a culturable command area (CCA) of 80,937 ha 
with estimated cost of US$316 million. This is subject to feasibility studies and detail design as 
there  are  uncertainties  related  to  floods,  hydraulic  challenge  of  guiding  or  storing  flood  flows, 
sediment loads, economics, water rights, and management models. In addition, previous studies 
indicated paucity of data and thus warrants further review of selected hill torrents, harnessing the 
1  The Punjab Irrigation Department (PID) has taken actions by working closely with ADB, the World Bank, and Japan 
International  Cooperation  Agency  for  the  improvement  of  irrigated  agriculture.  ADB’s  $700  million  multitranche 
financing facility for Punjab Irrigated Agriculture Investment Program has successfully supported the improvement of 
the irrigation infrastructure, on-farm agriculture of over 2 million ha, and institutional reforms.

water and feasible interventions before undertaking the detail design. 
4. 
The provincial government, through the Government of Pakistan, has requested the Asian 
Development  Bank  (ADB)  to  provide  support  for  improved  project  preparation  of  these  priority 
projects. A project readiness financing (the PRF) is proposed as the financing modality. 
II. 
OBJECTIVES OF THE ASSIGNMENT 
The PRF will identify and recommend feasible interventions in hill torrents in Dera Ghazi 
5. 
Khan and Rajanpur for improved water and agriculture productivity. The PRF will support project 
readiness of selected hill torrents for the proposed project “Harnessing of Hill Torrents in Dera 
Ghazi Khan and Rajanpur”. 
III. 
SCOPE OF SERVICES, TASKS AND EXPECTED DELIVERABLES 
General Approach: 
6. 
The services will be carried out in three-phased approach. Phase 1: (i) review secondary 
information  including  available  data  and  studies  of  13  hill  torrents,  (ii)  perform  desk  based 
assessment of proposed interventions, (iii) provide recommendations for selecting, possibly, 7-8 
hill torrents for improving, upgrading or conducting feasibility studies, (iv) present alternate options 
other  than  proposed  in  previous  studies,  (v)  install  stream  gauging  and  sediment  sampling 
stations at key locations of the hill torrent, observe the flow and sediment data. Phase 2: feasibility 
studies of 7-8 hill torrents (see footnote 2). Phase 3: detail design, procurement documents and 
other  documents  and  studies  to  fulfill  the  project  readiness  support  for  4-5  hill  torrents  (see 
footnote 2).  
7. 
In transition from each stage to the next, the consultants are required to provide a walk-
through of their recommendations to wider-stake holders including the panel of experts. There is 
a possibility that final intervention of any hill torrent may result in a mix of interventions, notably 
and  not  limited  to  new  or  improved  spate  irrigation  infrastructure,  improving  catchment 
degradation, flood management, improving interaction between spate irrigation and groundwater, 
water storages, improved soil and field water management, agricultural practices and extension 
services, and improved capacities of institutions and beneficiaries.

  Ranking List for Major Hill Torrents: More than 200 hill torrents originate from Suleiman 
range  and  after  crossing  Pachad  area,  spread  over  in  the  canal  command  area  of  DG 
Khan  and  Rajanpur  District.  Out  of  above,  thirteen  are  major  of  which  again,  four  hill 
torrents  namely  Chachar,  Vidore,  Mithawan  and  Kaha  have  created  huge  floods  and 
devasted  vast  irrigation  area  in  the  year  2010-2015.  Dispersion  structures  made  in  the 
past on various hill torrents have not worked efficiently and some effective innovations are 
required  to  mitigate  the  flood  damages  by  constructing  delay  action/  storage  dams  to 
6        Project Administration Manual – Attachment (Terms of Reference 2) 
attenuate the flood peaks of hill torrent floods. At present, feasibility studies for Chachar, 
Mithawan and Vidore dams have been prepared. As regards Kaha hill torrent, its feasibility 
study etc has been picked up by WAPDA. The Consultants will review and analyze the 
available data/ documents and develop ranking list/ priority of dams for all major hill torrent 
sites. Out of that, PID plans that Consultants will provide recommendations for selecting, 
possibly,  7-8  hill  torrents  for  improving,  upgrading  or  conducting  feasibility  studies  and 
then take up 4-5 hill torrents, under the ADB’s Project Readiness Financing Facility. The 
selection of priority 4-5 hill torrents shall be completed during first year of the Consultancy 
services.  The  local  knowledge  about  spate  irrigation  and  international  practices  in  this 
subject need to be applied in formulation of hill torrent projects. 
  Selection of a Model Project: During the first year, the consultant will identify the most 
viable and economical hill torrent development model project based on the available data 
and surveys and discussion with the client and pursue further studies and detailed design 
of the model hill torrent project. 
Flood Protection: During the recent years, hill torrents have created huge floods and 
devasted  vast  irrigation  area.  For  the  selection  of  the  priority  hill  torrent  projects,  the 
Consultants will specifically consider the factor of flood protection to the infrastructure in 
the area which includes residential and farm areas, roads, D G Khan Canal and Kachhi 
Canal. 
 
  Design of Dams: The consultant will review all aspects of the design of the proposed 
dams  with  particular  emphasis  on  hydrology,  sedimentation,  hydraulics,  geotechnics, 
structures, and dam safety; and give recommendations for revisions, if any. 
  Multiple  Uses  of  Water:  The  economic  returns  would  be  limited  if  the  water  is  used 
exclusively  for  conventional  irrigated  agriculture.  The  returns  could  be  significantly 
increased  if  the  water  is  used  for  human  consumption,  as  well  as  high-value  crop 
production  using  HEISs.  The  proposed  project  activities  will  lead  to  ground  water 
recharge which could facilitate conjunctive use of surface, stored, and ground water, thus 
enhancing sustainability and providing flexibility in systems operation. The department of 
Livestock  and  Dairy  Development;  and  Forestry,  Wildlife  and  Fisheries  need  to  be 
associated to provide the services to support livestock development. 
  Command Area Development (CAD) Activities: In this context, the consultants will: 
(i) 
(ii) 
prepare  inventory  of  quantity  and  quality  of  all  available  resources  including  soil 
types,  topography,  availability  of  surface/  groundwater  resources,  groundwater 
depths,  aquifer  quality,  depletion  trends,  recharge  rates  along  with  their  sources, 
number of tubewells & density, rainfall pattern, rainwater harvesting potential & its 
contribution in irrigation, farm sizes, land tenure etc. The resource assessment would 
also  include  farming  practices,  irrigation  methods,  efficacy  of  existing  agricultural 
practices, water productivity, cropping patterns & intensities, input use levels, crop 
yields etc. The consultants will carry out field surveys for ground truthing/ verification 
of such data gleaned from various documents/ reports, statistical records etc; 
consultants  will  develop  a  detailed  engineering  and  revenue  Chakbandi  of  the 
proposed new outlets/ watercourses; 
(iii)  suggest suitable farmers’ friendly cost sharing arrangements for various packages 
of  interventions  for  each  area  to  promote  adoption  of  modern  technologies  e.g. 
watercourse development, LASER land levelling, drip/ sprinkler irrigation systems, 
tunnel farming etc. among various categories of farmers after thorough consultation 
with the farming community and the OFWM wing of Agriculture Department;  
recommend  mechanisms  and  plans  for  capacity  building  of  farmers  as  well  as 
training  of  other  stakeholders  for  each  area  to  ensure  provision  of  technical 
assistance for successful adoption of proposed interventions; 
(iv) 
          Project Administration Manual – Attachment (Terms of Reference 2)         7 
(v) 
carry out economic and financial analyses for each of the proposed package/ CAD 
model and intervention for each area.; 
(vi)  explore  the  possibility  for  development  of  waste  lands  through  cooperative, 
corporate  or  any  other  such  farming  mode,  prepare  data  of  potential  agricultural 
lands and range lands development. For this, present status of land (barren, shingle, 
uneven, boulders/rocky etc.) need to be documented along with ownership and user 
rights. The data will include quantity, quality and characteristics of land and including 
land tenure; and 
(vii)  consult  with 
the  OFWM  wing  of  Agriculture  Department  and  propose  a 
comprehensive implementation strategy for the recommended development options 
including  investment  priority,  timeframe,  institutional  setup,  stakeholders,  roles/ 
responsibilities. 
  Use  of  More  Efficient  Agriculture  Management  Techniques:  Considering  limited 
amount of water, high evapotranspiration, remoteness of the area, and development of 
new  areas;  the consultant  need  to  promote  more  efficient management techniques  like 
HEISs;  tunnel  farming;  use  of  solar  pumps;  and  growing  high-value  fruits,  vegetables, 
condiments, and medicinal products. The project would provide a unique opportunity for 
organic  crop  production  considering  livestock  development  is  likely  to  be  an  important 
component of the project which would provide farmyard manure. 
  Spate Irrigation: The consultant will train/orient PID and Agriculture Department Staff in 
theory  and  practice  of  spate  irrigation  in  Pakistan  and  will  share  knowledge  of  other 
countries to have better understanding of hill torrent as integrated resource management. 
The consultant will liaise with different academic / research institutions and projects within 
country and international level to get support in hill torrent knowledge.   
  Value Addition and Value Chain: The consultant will be required to explore the possible 
value addition activities relevant to the project and promotion of value chain particularly 
relevant to the products (like wool, meat, and grains, fruits, and vegetables produced in 
the project area). 
  Sustainability: The consultant will need to design the project to ensure sustainability by 
devising suitable operation and maintenance (O&M) procedures, maximum cost recovery, 
strong  stakeholders’  participation  at  all  stages,  and  project  design  suitable  for  local 
conditions and culture. 
  Climate  Change  Adaptations:  The  consultant  will  incorporate  suitable  adaptations  in 
project design that will meet the challenges of climate changes. 
  Sediment Studies: The consultant will review the already available sediment studies for 
hill torrent projects and will conduct the sediment studies including sediment loads and 
transport modelling preferably for three years from Irrigation Research Institute / any other 
independent  source  and  will  incorporate  the  results  of  these  studies  in  their  detailed 
design. 
  Groundwater Investigations: The consultant will carry out groundwater investigations by 
aquifer  mapping  using  Geophysical  and  other  techniques  /  tools  by  monitoring 
Groundwater  quality  and  levels  from  Groundwater  Management  Cell  of  Irrigation 
Research Institute / any other independent source and will incorporate the results of these 
studies in their detailed design. 
  Due  Diligence: The  consultant  will  ensure that the  project  complies fully  with  the  ADB 
due  diligence  guidelines  related  to  environment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and  social 
aspects including gender. 
  Revision  and  Updating  of  Project  Design,  Costs,  and  Economic  and  Financial 
Analyses: The consultant will develop alternate development plans, including non-crop 
initiatives  (like  farmers’  training,  crop  production  support  interventions,  value-addition 
8        Project Administration Manual – Attachment (Terms of Reference 2) 
initiatives, animal husbandry, tree plantation, etc.) that may facilitate additional income to 
the  project  beneficiaries,  with  their  estimated  costs  and  benefits  and  select  the  most 
suitable  alternate  in  consultation  with  all  stakeholders  including  PID  and  ADB.  The 
consultant will prepare the feasibility level design for the selected alternate and revise the 
economic and financial analysis following relevant ADB Guidelines. 
  The  consultant  will  develop  alternate  development  plans,  including  non-crop  initiatives

56. 
The consultants will have a dual reporting function to the Executing Agency (EA) and ADB. 
The consultants will prepare the following reports in English with Arial font (12 for headings and 
11 for body text). The tables should use 10 Arial. The consultant will submit Table of Contents 
(TOC) for each report for prior approval of the client. A brief description of some important reports 
is given below. 
  Quarterly  Progress  Report:  Ten  copies  of  Quarterly  Progress  Reports  shall  be 
presented  quarterly  before  the  10th  day  of  the  subsequent  quarter  and  shall  indicate 
progress of the implementation of the consultancy contract.  The issues that may hinder 
implementation  as  planned  shall  be  flagged  in  these  reports  along  with  the  suggested 
solutions. 
  Resettlement  Plans:  The  project  falls  in  “Category  A”  under  ADB’s  resettlement 
guidelines meaning that there may likely be significant impacts for at least 200 persons 
due to the project. Based on this reclassification, the TA Consultants have developed a 
draft  resettlement  framework,  and  resettlement  action  plan  (RAP)  for  a  subproject  that 
was likely to encounter the greatest resettlement impacts.  
  The ADB and Government of Punjab have agreed to the following principles with regard 
to resettlement under the project:  
 
 
 
the  approach  to  resettlement  under  the  project  should  not  be  to  remove  all 
persons  who  have  encroached  on  the right  of way(s),  but to move  only  those 
persons who will be directly affected,  
design will be drafted with the objective of minimizing resettlement activities, and  
contract packages and execution of civil works will be directed in such a way to 
minimize resettlement activities.  
The  Consultants  would assist  PMO  in  updating the  RAP  prepared  during  PPTA  on  the 
basis of the detailed design and assist PMO in preparing RAP to meet funding agency’s 
requirements for any other area affecting more than 200 persons.

SUMMARY 
PROJECT E: Harnessing of Hill Torrents in Dera Ghazi Khan and Rajanpur 
Feasibility  Study  Consultants:  Joint  Venture  of  National  Engineering  Services  Pakistan 
(Pvt.) Limited (Lead) and Associated Consulting Engineers-ACE (Pvt.) Limited (JVP) and 
with Technical Resources Services (Pvt.) Limited (SC) 
Culturable Command Area: 80,937 ha (200,000 acre) 
Location: Dera Ghazi Khan and Rajanpur districts 
Estimated Cost: $316.00 million 
Status of Studies and Specific Issues: Suleman Mountainous Range runs in the vicinity of 20-
30 Kilometers along D. G. Khan and Rajanpur districts. More than 200 hill torrents originate from 
Suleiman range and spread over in the canal command area of DG Khan and Rajanpur District 
after crossing Pachad area. These streams outfall in the Indus River stretched in a reach of 57 
miles upstream of Taunsa Barrage to 5.5 miles upstream of Guddu Barrage. Out of the 200 hill 
torrents,  thirteen  are  major,  Kaura,  Vehowa,  Sanghar,  Sori  Lund,  Vidore,  Sakhi  Sarwar  and 
Mithawan are in DG Khan District, whereas, Kaha, Chachar, Pitok, Sori Shumali, Zangi and Sori 
Janubi  are  in  Rajanpur  District.  The  catchment  area  of  each  hill  torrent  has  two  distinct  parts; 
mountainous area and plain area. The plain area is called as Pached area and comprises good 
quality  land  for  cultivation  with  hill  torrents  flows  being  the  only  source  of  irrigation.  The 
mountainous and sub mountainous catchment area is about 7,184 square miles.  
Out of above thirteen major hill torrents, four hill torrents namely Chachar, Vidore, Mithawan and 
Kaha  created  huge  floods  in  the  year  2010,  2012,  2013  and  2015.  These  Hill  Torrent  mostly 
irrigate  the  Pachad  area  from  foothills  to  Kachhi  canal.  The  PID  has  constructed  number  of 
dispersion structures on these hill torrents to disperse flood water in the Pachad area which is 
constructed along the right side of the D.G Khan and Dajal Branch Canal to irrigate the area of 
Balochistan Province. Now Kachhi Canal is in the direct hit of these hill torrents. The dispersion 
structures are suitable for low flood flows whereas these structures are not working efficiently in 
case  of  high  flood  or  as  second  freshet  of  flood.  The  Chachar  hill  torrent  has  no  permanent 
structure  for  dispersion.  Only  small  dikes  are  constructed  by  local  irrigators  for  low  flood,  but 
during  high flood,  whole flood  water  reaches  at Kachhi  canal  and  Dajal Branch,  the  two  cross 
drainage  structures  on  these  canals  do  not  ample  capacity  to  pass  such  high  flood  flows. 
Therefore, main objective of the feasibility study is to mitigate the flood damages by constructing 
delay action/ storage dams to attenuate the flood peaks of hill torrent floods. 
Various studies were conducted at different forums for hill torrents management. A Hill Torrent 
Management Study in Dera Ghazi Khan Division was conducted under Kachii Canal Project by 
WAPDA in 2016 for all the thirteen hill torrents. A Feasibility Study of dams on Kaha, Chachar, 
Vidore  and  Mithawan  Hill  Torrents  in  Districts  D.  G.  Khan  &  Rajanpur  was  awarded  to  Joint 
Venture  of  National  Engineering  Services  Pakistan  (Pvt.)  Limited  (Lead)  and  Associated 
Consulting  Engineers-ACE  (Pvt.)  Limited  (JVP)  and  with  Technical  Resources  Services 
(Pvt.) Limited (SC) by Chief Engineer, DG Khan Irrigation Zone in February 2017. The objectives 
of the study were to: 
Annexure          41 
i) 
ii) 
iii) 
explore the possible dam sites on Chachar, Kaha, Vidore & Mithawan hill torrents for the 
construction of storage dam across the local stream for flood mitigation; 
assure  that  the  storage  water  shall  be  supplied  for  agriculture  to  improve  the  cropping 
intensities of the Pachad area and  
boost up the living standard of the local communities accordingly. 
At  present,  feasibility  studies  for  Kaha,  Vidore,  Mithawan  and  Chachar  dams  have  been 
prepared. As regards Kaha hill torrent, its feasibility study etc has been picked up by WAPDA. 
The  Consultants  recommended  “Short  Term  Measures”  and  “Long  Term  Measures”  in  their 
feasibility studies. Short Term Measures” include the improvement of existing Rodkohi system to 
reduce the flood hazard up to 25 years return period flood along with improvement of dispersion 
arrangement currently in practice. “Long Term Measures” based on 100 years return period flood 
are  the  ultimate  solution  for  the  flood  management  through  storage  /  delay  action  dams.  The 
priority of dams/ ranking list for the major 13 hill torrent sites will be reviewed and firmed up by 
the Consultants. Out of that, PID plans to take up four to five hill torrents, under the ADB’s Project 
Readiness Financing Facility. The documents required to be generated under the study would 
include  projects’  updated  feasibility  studies,  detailed  design,  tender  drawings,  construction 
drawings, cost estimates, social safeguard documents, PC-Is and bidding documents including 
technical specifications.
