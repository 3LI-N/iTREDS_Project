I.  THE PROPOSAL 
1. 
I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to 
Papua New Guinea (PNG) for the COVID-19 Rapid Response Program under the Countercyclical 
Support Facility's COVID-19 pandemic response option (CPRO).1 
2. 
Among the Pacific developing member countries of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), 
only PNG is currently affected by community transmission of the coronavirus disease (COVID-
19). The country is classified as a small island developing state, in a fragile and conflict-affected 
situation.2 It  exhibits  vulnerabilities in its  economy  and  health system,  limited fiscal space,  and 
significant  reliance  on  development  partners  to  help  it  achieve  its  development  objectives. 
The economy is projected to contract by 2.9% in 2020, and poverty and unemployment are rising. 
To manage the adverse socioeconomic impacts of COVID-19, the government is implementing a 
$769 million countercyclical program, including an economic stimulus package that encompasses 
the  government’s  COVID-19  health,  education,  and  multisector  response  plans.3 Collectively, 
these represent the government’s overall pandemic response plan, and the proposed CPRO will 
help the government implement it. PNG meets the access criteria of the CPRO (Table 1).4

Asian Development Bank Assessment 
GDP is projected to contract by 2.9% in 2020 in real terms, against 2.1% growth projected 
prior  to  the  pandemic,  driven  by  contractions  in  construction,  accommodation  and  food 
services, and transport (main text, para. 8). The 2020 fiscal balance is estimated to worsen 
from  –5%  of  GDP  pre-COVID-19  to  –8.2%  of  GDP  post-COVID-19.  Public  sector  debt  is 
expected to reach 49.8% of GDP in 2020, compared with 39.8% in 2019. The 2020 current 
account surplus is projected to decline to 15.9%, from 22.3% in 2019. The pandemic resulted 
in immediate and significant negative impacts on unemployment (31% of household heads 
lost their jobs) and poverty (increase by 4.5 percentage points) (main text, paras. 11–12). 
total 
Countercyclical  development  expenditures  approved  and  prepared 
$769 million (3.2% of GDP). This includes support for pro-poor countercyclical expenditures 
of $445 million through the budget and $324 million from domestic institutions—in the form 
of  support  for  the  health  system  response;  improved  social  assistance;  better  hygiene; 
support for agricultural development and food security; support for micro, small, and medium-
sized enterprises; loan repayment holidays; and superannuation withdrawals to mitigate the 
impacts of COVID-19, especially on vulnerable groups (main text, paras. 14–16).

macroeconomic 
management 
Growth,  which  averaged  4.2%  during  2015–2019,  was  undermined  by  falling  commodity 
prices, droughts, and an earthquake. Despite the multiple shocks, fiscal policy was generally 
sound, and the deficit averaged 3.9% during 2015–2019. The government managed to limit 
the fiscal deficit to 2.5% of GDP in 2017 and 2.6% of GDP in 2018 under a fiscal consolidation 
strategy.  In  2019,  as  it  stepped  up  capital  expenditures  to  stimulate  growth,  the  deficit

Access Criterion 
Asian Development Bank Assessment 
expanded to 4.9% of GDP. Fiscal reform is ongoing and supports revenue-raising measures 
and expenditure control guided by IMF technical assistance under a Medium-Term Revenue 
Strategy  (2018–2022)  and  an  IMF  SMP.  The  central  bank  has  managed  price  stability 
(inflation averaged 5.3% during 2015–2019) through its exchange rate mechanism and other 
monetary policy tools. However, the exchange rate mechanism, combined with a policy of 
foreign currency rationing, resulted in foreign exchange shortages, which dampened growth 
(main text, para. 7).  
A  state  of  emergency  was  declared  on  23  March  2020,  accompanied  by  the  State  of 
Emergency  Act  2020. This  was  replaced  by  the  National  Pandemic  Act  2020  on  16  June 
2020. On 17 June 2020, the National Control Centre was set up to manage the response 
and  coordinate  national  government  agencies  and  development  partner  support. 
Borders have  been  closed  since  26  March  2020  and  remain  so,  but  initial  restrictions  on 
domestic  movements  were  relaxed.  The  Department  of  Health  issued  the  Emergency 
Preparedness and Response Plan in March 2020, which outlined key actions to respond to 
COVID-19.  The  government  added  beds  in  intensive  care  units  and  isolation  facilities, 
purchased  medical  and  personal  protective  equipment,  increased  COVID-19  testing, 
strengthened contact tracing, and trained frontline health workers (main text, paras. 5 and 
14). Lessons from the pandemic will feed into the preparation of the National Action Plan for 
Health Security 2021–2030, with longer-term public health and preventative measures.  
Public sector debt in 2020 is forecast to expand to 49.8% of GDP post-COVID-19, compared 
with a 40.3% pre-pandemic projection. The IMF’s DSA prepared in June 2020 puts PNG at 
high risk of debt distress, with no access to external market finance. The rating results from 
the  COVID-19-induced  breaches  of  the  debt  service–revenue  ratio.  However,  debt  is  still 
assessed as sustainable, conditional on the implementation of sound fiscal policies and SMP 
commitments.  A  DSA  conducted  by  ADB  shows  that  the  negative  consequences  of  the 
pandemic  are primarily short-to-medium term, with positive growth resuming  as pandemic 
effects subside. ADB’s proposed loan is not expected to add significantly to the debt service 
obligations or affect PNG’s debt sustainability (main text, para. 27). 
ADB has been in close communication with the IMF on the CPRO. In June 2020, the IMF 
disbursed  $364  million  to  PNG  under  an  RCF,  noting  the  need  for  additional  financing 
support. The IMF’s RCF report is provided in lieu of an assessment letter. The IMF began an 
SMP in February 2020, and ADB closely coordinated with the IMF on the proposed State-
Owned Enterprise Reform Program, which is a benchmark in the SMP (main text, para. 24).

Background and Development Constraints

Resource-rich but inherently vulnerable. PNG is a resource-dependent, lower middle-
income country with an estimated population of 9.3 million and per-capita gross national income 
of $2,685 in 2019.5 The mineral sector (mining, petroleum, and natural gas) accounted for 28% 
of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  in  2019, while  agriculture,  forestry,  and  fisheries  contributed 
another 17.1%.6 Micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) account for about 25% of 
GDP (of the formal economy) and 24% of the labor force.7 MSMEs are mainly engaged in retail 
and service industries and operate in urban and peri-urban settings. PNG, despite its wealth of 
natural resources, remains politically and socially fragile with high rates of violent crime, ethnic

violence, and one of the highest rates of gender-based violence (GBV) in the world.8 It has the 
lowest life expectancy in the Pacific region (65.9 years in 2018). An estimated 48% of children 
born  in  PNG  are  stunted  or  chronically  undernourished  (double  the  rate  of  countries  with  a 
comparable GDP per capita), risking cognitive limitations in a population where a majority of the 
workforce has completed a maximum of grade ten education.9 These fragilities are reflected in 
the  United  Nations Development  Programme  (UNDP)  human  development  index,  which ranks 
PNG 155th out of 189 economies.10 PNG is also prone to disasters caused by natural hazards. 
Since 2016, PNG has experienced droughts, earthquakes, and a volcanic eruption.  
4. 
Fragile health system. PNG is making modest progress in improving its health outcomes. 
However, its performance is uneven. The maternal mortality ratio declined from 470 deaths per 
100,000 live births in 1990 to 215 deaths in 2015, and was estimated at 171 during 2016–2018.11 
PNG’s human development index rose by 43% between 1990 and 2017 and its ranking remains 
low (footnote 10). Health facilities are in poor condition and short of medical supplies. The country 
does  not  have  enough  health  workers  and  is  generally  unprepared  to  respond  to  a  pandemic 
(footnote 3). Financial constraints limit the number of outreach clinics, particularly in rural areas. 
Only  12  of  the  22  provinces  have  pre-triaging  areas  and  isolation  facilities;  most  provincial 
hospitals (16 of 22) have limited capacity in their intensive care units (ICUs)—only 93 ICU beds 
and 12 functioning ventilators for COVID-19 patients are available nationwide; and the quality of 
these  beds  and  the  adequacy  of  supplies  such  as  personal  protective  equipment  (PPE)  are 
unknown.  According  to  the  World  Health  Organization,  PNG’s  preparedness  and  response 
capacity for COVID-19 is at Level 2 (where Level 5 is best).  
5. 
Government quick to act on COVID-19. PNG’s first case of COVID-19 was detected on 
20 March 2020. The following day, a state of emergency was declared, which also activated the 
United  Nations  (UN)  Humanitarian  Cluster  system.  The  government  closed  the  borders  from 
26 March  2020,  imposed  internal  travel  restrictions,  and  decreed  a  national  lockdown  on  23 
March–27 April 2020. On 23 March 2020, the Prime Minister appointed the Police Commissioner 
as "Emergency Controller," which Parliament confirmed in April 2020. Parliament also passed the 
National Pandemic Act 2020 on 16 June 2020, which outlines the legal powers conferred to the 
Controller, as well as the reporting obligations and financial management arrangements (including 
the need for audits) for the medium-term response to the pandemic.12 With this act in place, the 
state of emergency was lifted. On 17 June 2020, the National Control Centre (NCC) was set up 
to manage the response and coordinate national government agencies and development partner 
support,  including  the  implementation  of  the  pandemic  response  plan  (para.  2).  A  second 
lockdown was imposed on 29 July–14 August 2020. The lockdowns meant that most businesses 
and  institutions,  including  schools,  were  shut  for  about  7  weeks.  This  depressed  domestic 
demand and required education to be delivered virtually (para. 15). No domestic flight restrictions 
apply at present, but international travelers are admitted subject to strict entry regulations.13

13 The National Pandemic Act (Measure No. 2) outlines international travel measures. They restrict entry to four PNG 
seaports (Port Moresby, Rabaul, Morobe, Madang) and Port Moresby’s international airport. No person is permitted 
entry unless provided with an exemption by the Controller. A 14-day quarantine period is required upon arrival.

COVID-19 tally. As of 16 November 2020, PNG recorded 602 positive cases of COVID-
6. 
19  and  7  deaths  across  13  provinces  (out  of  22  administrative  regions),  and  had  carried  out 
29,466  tests. 14 , 15  While  the  rate  of  testing  has  increased  since  March  2020,  testing  in  the 
provinces (and the settlement areas of Port Moresby) remains inadequate given that most cases 
are  not  epidemiologically  linked,  suggesting  widespread  community  transmission.  In  mid-July 
2020, PNG recorded a dramatic upsurge in COVID-19 infections, reflecting increased testing.16 
Testing  is  carried  out  through  a  network  of  public  and  private  clinics  with  samples  processed 
through  two  laboratories  in  Port  Moresby  and  Goroka,  and  overseas.  However,  effective 
surveillance  is  limited  by  the  slow  processing  time  and  lack  of  patient  identification  after  the 
results.  The  ADB-financed  public  health  surveillance  system  (electronic  national  health 
information  system)  is  supporting  surveillance  by  tracking  COVID-19-  associated  symptoms, 
including pneumonia, and through death reports.  
7. 
Pre-shock  record  of  generally  sound  fiscal  management.  Growth  averaged  4.2% 
between 2015–2019, but has been volatile because of falling commodity prices, droughts, and an 
earthquake  (Table  2).  Despite  the  multiple  shocks,  fiscal  policy  was  generally  sound,  and  the 
deficit averaged 3.9% during 2015–2019. The government managed to limit the deficit to 2.5% of 
GDP in 2017 and to 2.6% of GDP in 2018 under a fiscal consolidation strategy. Additionally, the 
government adopted fiscal reforms—including revenue-raising measures under a medium-term 
revenue  strategy  guided  by  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  technical  assistance  (TA),  and 
measures  aimed  at  controlling  recurrent  expenditure.17 A  switch  to  a  more  expansionary  fiscal 
policy in 2019 led to a deficit of 4.9% of GDP, largely driven by increased capital expenditure to 
stimulate growth, but also in a context of weaker revenues and a revision to nominal GDP.18

18 The 2020 budget used the October 2019 Supplementary budget revised nominal GDP calculations for 2016–2020 
which were down by 4.0% from the 2019 budget, driven by an exercise to more accurately value GDP. Without this 
revaluation, the fiscal deficit would have been –4.7% (compared with –4.9% actual) and the debt stock would have 
been 38.2% (compared with 39.8% actual).

to a contraction of 2.9% in 2020. Export revenues fell as global commodity prices weakened along 
with weaker external demand, and declines in mining production also contributed to lower exports. 
Lockdowns and restrictions on international and domestic travel hurt several industries: transport, 
accommodation and food services, real estate, manufacturing, and construction. Cognizant that 
adverse business conditions and lower economic activity are anticipated to continue into 2021 
because  of  the  continued  spread  of  COVID-19  and  ongoing  depressed  regional  demand,  the 
government is formulating the 2021 national budget with support from development partners in 
an effort to continue critical pandemic response plan measures and identify opportunities for re-
energizing productive economic sectors outside the extractive industries, such as infrastructure 
(para. 21). In response to this uncertainty, the government indicated that several critical elements 
of the pandemic response plan were likely to continue and be reflected in the 2021 budget.  
Fiscal impact of COVID-19. The fiscal deficit is projected to expand to 8.2% of GDP, from 
9. 
5.0% of GDP before the pandemic. This reflects an estimated fall in revenues of 19.4% and a net 
expenditure  cut  of  3.9%  in  2020  when  compared  to  projections  before  the  pandemic. 
The  government  reduced  its  revenue  projection  from  15.3%  of  GDP  to  14.0%  of  GDP. 
The  supplementary  budget  announced  expenditure  cuts  totaling  K2.3  billion  from  the  2020 
budget, and directed K1.6 billion to fund COVID-19-related and other expenditures.19  
10. 
COVID-19 impact on finance sector. The impact on the finance sector is expected to be 
limited.  Nonperforming  loans,  which  were  4.0%  of  total  loans  prior  to  the  pandemic,  including 
those of MSMEs, are expected to increase moderately. Commercial banks are profitable and well 
capitalized, and are expected to be able to absorb credit losses.20 Nonbank financial institutions 
typically lend only against collateral, such as movable assets, and have limited exposure to the 
high-risk market segment of MSMEs. While liquidity was sufficient prior to COVID-19, the Bank 
of  Papua  New  Guinea  (BPNG)  has  subsequently  provided  additional  liquidity  through  a 
quantitative easing program and continues to monitor this closely. 
Socioeconomic  impacts  of  COVID-19.  Poverty  models  suggest  that  the  poverty  rate 
11. 
was about 27.2% before the pandemic; based on a 10% decline in mean per capita consumption, 
the poverty rate could jump to 31.7% in 2020.21 As of June 2020, up to 31% of household heads 
were  reported  to  have  lost  their  jobs  (footnote  7).  The  most  vulnerable  are  those  without  any 
alternative sources of income, such as low-income earners and subsistence workers. Of these 
vulnerable people, 79% are employed and 48% are women.22 Disruption in the food supply chain 
and surges in food prices particularly threaten the 26.5% of the population below the national food 
poverty  line  (with  an  incidence  of  28.5%  in  rural  areas).23 Protracted  impacts  on  employment 
indicate a longer period of recovery, which could exacerbate pre-existing challenges of stunting, 
wasting,  and  malnutrition  (para.  3).  With  limited  social  insurance  programs  in  the  country, 
vulnerable  groups  such  as  poor  households,  older  people,  people  with  disabilities,  and 
households headed by women are at risk of slipping into poverty. Of these vulnerable people, 
80% currently have no income or only limited ability to generate income, and 67% do not have 
access  to  basic  services  such  as  water  and  sanitation,  health  clinics,  and  primary  schools. 
19 The supplementary budget showed a net reduction in recurrent expenditure of K0.8 billion, and a net increase in 
capital expenditure of K0.1 billion. 
20 Commercial banks reported a combined ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 34.9% as of June 2019. 
21 J.  Bulan  et  al.  2020.  COVID-19  and  Poverty:  Some  Scenarios.  Unpublished  note  prepared  for  ADB’s  Economic 
Research and Regional Cooperation Department. The poverty rate, based on a poverty line of $1.90 per day, was 
last recorded at 39.9% (2009). Reflecting trends since 2009, including in GDP per capita, the poverty rate is modeled 
to have fallen to 27.2% as of 2020, pre-COVID-19.

Interrupted schooling because of domestic containment and lockdown measures will potentially 
have long-term effects on students’ performance and learning (footnote 7).   
12.  Women and girls particularly vulnerable. In addition to the risk of COVID-19 infection, 
additional  health  impacts  on  women  and  girls  include  the  diversion  of  resources  from  other 
essential  services  such  as  maternal  and  reproductive  health  care.  The  UN  Population  Fund 
research  highlights  that  GBV  is  increasing  and  that  the  state  of  emergency  severely  curtailed 
women and girls’ ability to access GBV services.24 The COVID-19 pandemic is also undermining 
women’s  economic  security.  Women  are  more  vulnerable  to  economic  hardships  given  their 
reliance on informal work (60% of informal entrepreneurs are women). Even before the state of 
emergency, women's workforce participation was lower than men's—men were almost twice as 
likely as women to have wage jobs in the formal sector. The Women’s Microbank is experiencing 
95%  customer  default  on  either  single  or  multiple  loan  repayments  as  many  of  their  women 
entrepreneur clients feel the impacts of COVID-19. While the data is not disaggregated by sex, a 
UN survey of MSMEs found that 37% have temporarily ceased operations and a further 25% have 
reduced  staff  or  wages  (footnote  7).  The  same  research  indicates  that  the  income  of  80%  of 
households has been negatively affected, with debt increasing by up to 42%.

Strong countercyclical expenditure plan. The government’s pandemic response plan 
13. 
(para.  2)  totals  $769  million  (3.2%  of  GDP).  The  plan  (Table  3)  comprises  multiple  measures 
(paras.  14–16) to  improve  core  health  sector  capacities,  respond  adequately to  the  pandemic, 
minimize the impacts on vulnerable groups, and provide economic stimulus to boost aggregate 
demand and help the economy through the recovery.

Health and safety ($166 million). Following confirmation of the first COVID-19 case in 
14. 
March  2020,  the  government,  with  development  partner  support,  is  expending  $92  million  on 
health system strengthening, delivering (i) 400 non-ICU beds in temporary isolation facilities for 
COVID-19  patients  across  the  country,  (ii)  clinical  guidelines  on  how  to  manage  COVID-19 
patients  and  training  in  COVID-19  case  management  for  about  4,836  health  workers, 
(iii) a community education campaign and establishment of logistic arrangements, and (iv) rapid 
procurement  of  test  kits  and  PPE  to  support  national  testing  capacity.25 To  improve  access  to 
water,  sanitation,  and  hygiene,  the  government  and  development  partners  are  implementing 
actions to provide water supply to communities, schools, and health care facilities ($35 million). 
To protect the people, the government set up the NCC to coordinate its pandemic response, and 
is  strengthening  quarantine  facilities,  border  protection,  and  policing  ($39  million).  Lessons 
learned during the pandemic will feed into the preparation of long-term activities to be designed 
and presented in the National Action Plan for Health Security 2021–2030 (footnote 3). 
Social  assistance,

($213 million).26 The government’s social assistance and food security programs targeted poor

and  vulnerable  groups  at  risk  of  being 
The government, with development partners, is expending $38 million on nationwide food security 
activities, including distribution of food rations during April–December 2020. The main recipients 
are those affected by income and job losses, especially in urban areas where they have fewer 
means  to  grow  their  own  food;  5,000  individuals  in  the  National  Capital  District  (NCD)  are 
estimated to have received food rations to date. Implementation is channeled through churches 
and  local  administration  bodies  to  ensure  correctly  targeted  and  timely  distribution  of  relief. 
This scheme draws on the databases of nongovernment organizations involved in volunteer and 
humanitarian work in the NCD. In addition, an estimated 10,000 smallholder farmers and poor 
rural  households  are  receiving  support  to  purchase  seedlings  or  home  gardening  kits,  or  to 
manage threats to plant and animal health. The aim is to help them sustain their crop and livestock 
production for household consumption and/or market sale, and thus prevent income losses from 
COVID-19-induced  disruptions  to  economic  activities.  A  rapid  assessment  revealed  that  most 
schools find it difficult to deliver remote teaching. In response, the government, with development 
partner  support,  is  spending  $22  million  on  broadcasting  educational  television  and  radio 
programs nationwide three times a week for secondary students, and daily radio programs for 
primary  students.  This  benefits  more  than  370,000  children,  including  168,000  girls,  and 
minimizes  learning  disruptions.  The  humanitarian  cluster  system  has  been  activated (para.  5), 
including  the  protection  cluster.  The  government  and  development  partners  are  implementing 
$6 million worth of initiatives, e.g., through the GBV and child protection subclusters, to ensure 
the safety and protection of women, children, older people, and people with disabilities across the 
country. Women and community groups were encouraged to produce face masks as a source of 
immediate income. At least 200,000 locally made masks were procured by the government and 
are  being  distributed  around the  NCD.  At  least  14,000  superannuation fund  members  working 
mostly  in  the  formal  sector  (about  38%  of  them  women)  will  get  early  access  to  their 
superannuation equivalent to 20% of their own contributions to date, or a maximum of K10,000, 
for immediate cash assistance. This is estimated to total $147 million, or less than 5% of overall 
assets held by the superannuation funds, so is not considered to impact the funds' sustainability. 
25 An amount of $57,000 was disbursed to each province in June 2020 to support local COVID-19 activities and procure 
supplies. The PPE procurement follows the same advance procurement arrangements supported by the UN Office 
for  Project  Services  (UNOPS)  and  the  United  Nations  Children's  Fund  (UNICEF)  as  does  the  World  Bank’s 
$19.38 million COVID-19 Emergency Response Project (P173834).

16.  MSMEs  and  other  economic  support  ($390  million).  The  government  took  several 
measures  to  safeguard  small  businesses  and  rural  producers,  and  improve  the  hygiene  in 
markets  and  business  centers  to  allow  trading  to  continue,  especially  for  informal  traders  and 
small vendors. This includes $66 million to support the prices for coffee, cocoa, and copra farmers 
and  stabilize  their  income,  and  a  market  improvements  program  for  producers.  Smallholder 
producers receive logistics and transportation support, including aggregation of products to urban 
hubs and main commercial markets. To date, 14 shipments took place from Lae to Port Moresby, 
each  containing  10,000  bags  of  produce  or  912  dry  and  refrigerated  containers.  Lending  to 
MSMEs is also being supported with a $59 million credit guarantee program delivered through 
Bank  South  Pacific  (about  65%  market  share)  and  National  Development  Bank  (about  2.2% 
market share). This will enable MSMEs to retain their workers. The lending support comes with 
business training to build the resilience of small businesses to withstand the COVID-19 impacts. 
The package includes $11 million for agriculture-related businesses; $7 million for youth, women, 
and micro businesses; and a further $2.2 million exclusively for women-run businesses. Interest 
rates range between 4%–5% with a term of 15–20 years. The government allocated $88 million 
to  support  short-term  employment  through  capital  works  in  the  education,  health,  judiciary, 
transport, and other infrastructure sectors. Finally, in April 2020, PNG’s financial institutions began 
granting loan repayment holidays for 3 months or longer, estimated to cost $177 million. Laid-off 
workers and businesses impacted by COVID-19 are eligible for this support.  
17.  Monetary policy response. The BPNG launched a 3-month quantitative easing program 
in April 2020, which injected K643 million into the financial system. As a further policy measure to 
support liquidity, it reduced the cash reserve ratio of commercial banks from 10% to 7%. It also 
reduced its policy rate, the kina facility rate, from 5% to 3%, and commercial banks responded by 
reducing lending rates. 
C. 
Proposed  Program,  Impact,  ADB’s  Value  Addition,  and  Development  Partner 
Coordination 
18. 
ADB’s program will support the government in containing the pandemic and cushion its 
social  and  economic  impact,  particularly  on  the  poor  and  vulnerable.  It  is  aligned  with  PNG's 
overarching development objective of mitigating the health, social, and economic impact of the 
outbreak (footnote 3). The outcome will be: adverse effects of COVID-19 on businesses and the 
population  reduced.  The  program  has  three  outputs:  (i)  COVID-19  health  response  measures 
implemented,  (ii)  measures  to  protect  and  provide  social  assistance  and  food  security  to 
vulnerable  groups  enhanced,  and  (iii)  MSMEs  safeguarded  from  the  economic  downturn. 
The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. 
19. 
Lessons  learned.  The  COVID-19  pandemic  exacerbated  the  country's  fragilities  and 
required the use and strengthening of existing systems to meet the needs of the people. Policy 
dialogue and experiences from other CPROs have shown that support to areas where ADB is not 
traditionally  involved,  such  as  social  protection,  requires  longer  and  more  substantive 
engagement with the government. While ADB’s ability to influence the design of social protection 
initiatives is limited, the CPRO provides a basis for greater ADB engagement and the opportunity 
to improve  these areas through  future  projects  and/or  TA.  COVID-19  presented  time-sensitive 
challenges  in  procurement  and  logistics  to  which  national  agencies  were  not  previously 
accustomed.  Contracting  the  UN  Office  for  Project  Services  (UNOPS)  to  procure  and  import 
medical supplies through both the government and development partners has worked well. The 
design of the proposed CPRO incorporates these lessons and reflects evaluation findings from 
9 
previous disaster responses, such as that to the 2018 earthquake, its coordination with the cluster 
system, and the use of both government and partner systems to respond most effectively.27 
20. 
ADB’s value addition. This CPRO is part of a wider package of assistance to meet short-
term response requirements—it supports the stabilization of the fiscal situation and contributes to 
recovery efforts. It is complemented by TA funds ($1.6 million) to directly procure health supplies, 
Asia Pacific Disaster Response Fund assistance ($3 million) to further contribute to the health 
response, and a proposed policy-based operation focused on public financial management (PFM) 
reforms  in  the  health  sector  (an  additional  $50  million  added  to  the  originally  planned  $100 
million).28 This operation has supported the government in achieving critical actions underlying 
their  health sector response  plan (para.  3).29 In concert  with  other  development  partners,  ADB 
contributed  to  policy  discussions  on  the  economic  response  and  the  development  of  the 
supplementary budget, especially on managing higher debt levels.30 ADB also supported a public 
health surveillance system, and PFM regulatory reforms at the Department of Health's subnational 
agencies and four provincial health authorities (footnote 28). ADB will embed consultants in the 
Department  of  Treasury  (DOT)  to  support  monitoring  and  reporting  of  the  program’s 
implementation, and the development of a revised medium-term fiscal strategy that provides a 
path  toward  longer-term  fiscal  sustainability.  ADB  will  also  mobilize  regional  TA  in  support  of 
social  assistance  and  gender  equality  to  help  monitor  these  aspects  of  the  CPRO,  build  the 
capacity  of  line agencies  for  social  policy  development,  help them  strengthen  their  systems to 
deliver  social  protection,  and  supplement  their  efforts  to  report  on  the  effectiveness  of  these 
initiatives,  particularly  for  women  and  girls. 31  This  work  will  also  inform  any  future  ADB 
interventions. 
ADB’s support for recovery. ADB expects to provide further budget support through the 
21. 
Health  Services  Sector  Development  Program  ($150  million  in  2020)  and  the  State-Owned 
Enterprises Reform Program ($100 million in 2020, $150 million in 2021, $250 million in 2022). 
These  policy-based  operations  provide  financial  resources  to  help  meet  PNG's  short-term 
financing  needs  while  supporting  policy  reforms  that  promote  longer-term  growth  and  poverty 
reduction. To assist the country’s medium-term economic recovery, ADB has planned significant 
investments  in  infrastructure  to  support  road  transport,  maritime  links,  and  domestic  and  air 
transportation.  Quality  infrastructure  is  a  central  component  of  the  government’s  economic 
recovery strategy. This pipeline of programs and projects complements the CPRO by building on 
the government’s desire for macroeconomic stability, fiscal sustainability, and greater economic 
growth, including beyond the extractive industries. 
Alignment with Strategy 2030 and country partnership strategy. The CPRO is aligned 
22. 
with ADB’s Strategy 2030, particularly the operational priorities of addressing remaining poverty 
and reducing inequalities, promoting rural development and food security, accelerating progress 
in  gender  equality,  and  strengthening  governance  and  institutional  capacity.32 The  program’s 
design  reflects  Strategy  2030’s  approach  to  fragile  and  conflict-affected  situations  and  small

approach,  such  as  embedding  consultants  in  long-term  advisory  roles  in  DOT  (footnote  30). 
The program is aligned with the PNG country partnership strategy, 2016–2020, particularly the 
operational  priorities  relating  to  inclusive  economic  growth,  rural  primary  health  delivery,  and 
public sector management improvements.33 
23. 
Development  partner  coordination.  The  support  of  development  partners  for  the 
government’s  COVID-19  response  is  well  coordinated  through  the  NCC  and  the  UN  Disaster 
Management  Team. 34  The  NCC  is  at  the  center  of  the  response,  while  the  UN  leads  the 
coordination with the development partners. Several UN agencies also directly support the relief 
efforts.35 The UN Disaster Management Team, of which ADB is a member, is the primary vehicle 
for the UN to align the efforts of development partners, keep the partners abreast of developments, 
and  advocate for more financing  to meet  pressing needs  as  described  in the  COVID-19  Multi-
Sector Response Plan (footnote 3).  
24. 
ADB maintains a regular dialogue with the IMF on assessments of PNG's macroeconomic 
and  fiscal  situation.  When  the  IMF  prepared  its  Rapid  Credit  Facility  and  reviewed  its  Staff-
Monitored Program, it sought ADB’s views on the economic outlook in the context of ADB’s budget 
support in 2020, the proposed State-Owned Enterprise Reform Program, which is a benchmark 
in the Staff-Monitored Program, and forward pipeline.36 ADB also sought the IMF’s views on the 
CPRO access criteria.37 
D. 
Development Financing Needs, Budget Support, and Debt Sustainability  
The  budget  deficit  of  8.2%  in  2020  is  equivalent  to  a  financing  need  of  $1.95  billion. 
25. 
This is $558 million more than the pre-pandemic need. The deficit will be financed through a mix 
of domestic ($566 million) and external ($1,246 million) sources, with a further drawdown on the 
cash  balance  of  $138  million  with  the  BPNG,  which  indicates  an  overall  financing  shortfall. 
External borrowing will be entirely financed by multilateral and bilateral partners (Table 4).

The government has requested a regular loan of $250 million from ADB’s ordinary capital 
resources to help finance the program. The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace period 
of 3 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB’s London interbank offered 
rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan 
agreement. The government’s development policy letter is in Appendix 3. 
Debt sustainability. Despite the IMF classifying PNG at high risk of debt distress, debt 
27. 
sustainability analyses conducted by ADB and the IMF have shown that the consequences of the 
pandemic would primarily be short-to-medium term.38 In the longer term, as PNG’s major resource 
projects generate higher growth, the economic effects of the pandemic would gradually dissipate. 
Planned lending from development partners would lift public debt to 49.8% of GDP in 2020 and 
to 52.6% in 2023, before a downward trajectory resumes. The breaches of debt service limits are 
either one-off or short-lived. The longer-term sustainability of PNG’s external and public debt is 
preserved. Debt management is guided by a medium-term debt strategy that seeks to make use 
of low-cost external financing. ADB provides TA support in debt management (footnote 30). ADB’s 
proposed loan, which represents 2.5% of PNG’s outstanding public debt stock, is not considered 
to add significantly to the debt service obligations of the government or affect debt sustainability. 
E. 
Implementation Arrangements 
28. 
DOT  will  be  the  executing  agency.  The  implementing  agencies  are  the  departments  of 
health,  education,  community  development  and  religion,  agriculture  and  livestock,  national 
planning and monitoring, and commerce and industries. DOT will monitor budget execution and 
the flow of funds for countercyclical measures, and submit a report to ADB by the end of May 
2021. ADB will commit TA resources (para. 20) to monitor program implementation which will be 
aligned  to  the  government’s  monitoring  arrangements  (para.  5).  The  program  implementation 
period is February 2020 to June 2021. The proceeds of the loan will be withdrawn in accordance 
with ADB’s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time).  
III. 
DUE DILIGENCE 
29. 
Governance. The most recent public expenditure and financial accountability assessment 
was in 2015.39 PNG scored relatively well on credibility of the fiscal strategy and budget, policy-
based planning and budgeting, and comprehensiveness and transparency. However, it has scope 
for improvement in accountability; management of public assets, liabilities and associated fiscal 
risks;  and  timeliness  of  fiscal  accounts.  ADB  and  development  partners  are  supporting  the 
government’s  improvements  in  PFM.  The  current  administration  set  up  several  institutional 
arrangements  to  ensure  that  COVID-19  funds  are  expended  as  intended.  This  includes  the 
38 Debt Sustainability Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). 
39 IMF. 2015. Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability Assessment. Washington, DC. 
12 
Pandemic  Act  (para.  5),  financial  instructions  that  prescribe  how  COVID-19  funds  are  to  be 
disbursed,  and  the  reporting  required.  Despite  PNG  ranking  137th  out  of  179  economies  in 
corruption perception, improving governance is a priority, as evidenced by the Whistleblowers Act 
2020, which protects civil servants who report maladministration or misconduct from retaliation.40 
ADB’s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was discussed with the government. 
30. 
Poverty.  Poverty  has  increased  with  COVID-19  (para.  11).  The  impacts  on  the 
employment of heads of households are severe, and temporary relief such as cash support from 
superannuation  funds  will  prevent  households  from  falling  into,  or  deeper  into,  poverty. 
Food supplies are an essential immediate response for those at high risk of reduced food intake, 
especially  affected  informal  workers  in  urban  areas.  Most  poor  households  are  in  rural  areas 
dominated  by subsistence  and  cash  crop  production;  hence,  agriculture  support  through  price 
subsidies,  payment  of  freight  costs for transporting  produce  and distributing  planting  materials 
and  livestock  will  help  maintain  food  and  cash  crop  production,  a  source  of  food  security  and 
income for small-scale producers. The government’s assistance to MSMEs and informal traders 
through market improvements, small business training, provision of loans, and loan repayment 
holidays will prevent enterprises from going out of business or having to dismiss workers.   
Gender.  The  program  is  categorized  effective  gender  mainstreaming. 41  It  includes 
31. 
proactive actions across all three output areas to support women’s health, safety, and economic 
empowerment. To protect women’s health, the National Guidelines on Clinical Management of 
COVID-19  Cases  include  gender  actions  such  as  provisions  for  pregnant  women,  continued 
antenatal care and prioritizing GBV risk assessments, training for frontline health workers (most 
are women) on the clinical management of COVID-19 (which has been provided), and ringfenced 
budget  for  maternal  health  care  services.  The  GBV  subcluster  continues  to  be  activated  and 
meets regularly; agreements are in place to ensure that GBV services across PNG are considered 
"essential services" and can operate during lockdowns; and the government approved a code of 
conduct preventing sexual exploitation and abuse by humanitarian workers. To support women’s 
economic  empowerment,  the  government’s  package  to  support  MSMEs  will  target  women 
entrepreneurs through low-interest financial products, market improvements, training, and loan 
repayment  holidays.  In  addition,  women  and  women’s  groups  in  the  NCD  are  producing  face 
masks  as  an  additional  income-generating  opportunity;  200,000  masks  were  procured  by  the 
government to be distributed to communities around the NCD. 
32. 
Safeguards. In compliance with ADB’s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the program 
was  screened  and  classified  category  C  for  environment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and 
indigenous peoples.42 Additional due diligence confirmed that the program’s component with the 
greatest risk—comprising a guarantee arrangement for lending to MSMEs—will not result in any 
adverse environmental impacts.43 The banks will apply ADB’s prohibited investment activities list 
in their lending to MSMEs. The program is not expected to have any significant environmental or 
social safeguards impacts as per the provisions in the Safeguard Policy Statement.

Table 5: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures 
Risks 
Economic and fiscal conditions 
deteriorate because of 
accelerating COVID-19 infections, 
which further depresses demand.   
Poor execution of the 
government’s countercyclical 
policies, not least because of 
limited capacity, results in fewer 
benefits than envisaged. 
Political instability or a breakdown 
in law and order hampers the 
government’s efforts to execute 
its countercyclical program. 
Mitigation Measures 
The government  will continue  to  support  the economy  and focus expenditure  on 
initiatives that will limit the economic impacts of COVID-19. The government, with 
the support of development partners, will monitor the effectiveness of interventions 
and make adjustments as required. The IMF will provide policy advice, through the 
implementation  of  the  Staff-Monitored  Program,  to  ensure  a  balance  between 
economic stimulus and fiscal sustainability.  
The  government’s  countercyclical  policies  have  been  designed  to  limit  the 
complexity of stimulus measures and use existing channels to ensure that they can 
be  implemented.  Existing  channels,  particularly  for  social  assistance,  have  their 
limitations, but comprehensive and localized support from development partners is 
helping  overcome  these  constraints  and  improve  monitoring.  ADB  technical 
assistance resources will help supplement capacity.a 
ADB maintains strong relationships across the legislature, including those who may 
form a new government. ADB has strong relationships with key public servants in 
central government agencies. The government has increased funding to the police 
and the defense forces to maintain law and order.

ASSURANCES 
34. 
The government has assured ADB that the implementation of the program shall conform 
to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, 
gender, procurement, consulting services, financial management, and disbursement as described 
in detail in the loan agreement.  
V. 
RECOMMENDATION 
35. 
I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the 
Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of 
$250,000,000 to Papua New Guinea for the COVID-19 Rapid Response Program, from ADB’s 
ordinary  capital  resources,  in  regular  terms,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with 
ADB’s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility;  for  a  term  of  15  years, 
including a grace period of 3 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in 
accordance with those set forth in the draft loan agreement presented to the Board.

Asian Development Bank Assessment 
1.  Adverse 
Impact of 
Exogenous 
Shocks 
GDP is projected to contract by 2.9% in 2020 in real terms, against 2.1% growth projected 
prior to the pandemic. Revenue is projected to fall by $800 million or 3.4% of GDP, from 
the  pre-COVID-19  target  or  to  fall  by  2.9%  of  GDP  compared  to  2019.  The  2020  fiscal 
balance is estimated to worsen from –5% of GDP pre-COVID-19 to –8.2% of GDP post-
COVID.  The  current  account  surplus  is  projected  to  reduce  to  15.9%  from  22.3%  pre-
COVID-19.  
The economy has been increasingly battered by the COVID-19 pandemic. The authorities 
have managed to contain the spread of COVID-19, to some extent, by imposing lockdowns, 
but  these  measures  have  depressed  economic  activity.  Further,  combined  with  falling 
export revenue as global commodity prices weaken along with external demand, and with 
the  closure  of  Porgera  gold  mine,  lockdowns  have  significantly  undermined  the  fiscal 
position of the government. Recovery in 2021 is expected to be weak. 
international  and  domestic 
Several  industries  have  been  hampered  by  partial  business  closures  as  a  result  of 
lockdowns  and  restrictions  on 
transportation, 
accommodation  and  food  services,  real  estate,  manufacturing,  and  construction. 
Agriculture  and  forestry  have  also  been  constrained  by  disruption  to  transportation  and 
trade,  notably  by  quarantine  requirements  on  shipments,  which  have  lengthened 
turnaround  times.  Domestic  demand  and  household  spending  have  weakened  with 
curtailed business activity and associated cost-cutting measures, most notably layoffs and 
reduced work hours and salaries.  
travel: 
The  production  and  export  of  liquefied  natural  gas  are  not  expected  to  be  significantly 
affected by COVID-19, but mining and quarrying have been hit by the recent suspension of 
operations at the Ok Tedi gold and copper mine following a local outbreak of COVID-19. 
Beyond the Ok Tedi suspension, mining and quarrying output overall is seen to contract by 
15%  or  more  in  2020,  largely  reflecting  closure  of  Porgera,  following  the  government’s 
decision not to renew the operator’s license, and by disappointing output from the Lihir gold 
mine. 
The forecast for inflation in 2020 is unchanged from before the pandemic, at 3.3%, as prices 
track  persistently  weak  economic  activity.  Recent  economic  developments  have  applied 
both downward and upward pressure on inflation. Downward pressures include a lower oil 
price,  weaker  domestic  demand,  and  government  interventions  to  mitigate  the  effect  of 
COVID-19, including price regulations on selected consumer goods and a freight subsidy 
introduced  to  support  shipments  of  local  produce  to  the  capital  and  ill-served  offshore 
islands. Upward pressures include the reduced supply of goods under restrictions intended 
to contain COVID-19 and local currency depreciation. A lesser but still noteworthy upward 
pressure  is  accelerated  increase  in  the  money  supply  fueled  by  a  quantitative  easing 
program introduced by the BPNG, the central bank. 
The current account surplus is seen to fall to 15.9% of GDP with lower commodity prices, 
weaker external demand for exports, and disruption caused by transportation bottlenecks. 
The gold price has increased, but its positive effect will be more than offset by lost gold 
production  from  key  mines.  Imports  have  similarly  slowed  as  businesses  have  become 
cautious  and  restrictions  have  reduced  trade.  Foreign  exchange  reserves  stood  at 
$2.1 billion  at  the  end  of  March  2020,  providing  cover  for  5.1  months  of  imports.  The 
reduction in the prices for hydrocarbons impacts PNG through the reduction in tax revenue 
and  dividends  to  the  state,  and  reduced  foreign  exchange  transfers  to  the  government 
because resource companies remit tax in US$. 
Government revenue is expected to deteriorate significantly, with the authorities forecasting 
that revenue in 2020 will fall to the equivalent of 3.4% of GDP, below earlier expectations. 
Meanwhile, additional expenditure is needed to implement the government’s response to 
the COVID-19 emergency.

Management 
The shortfall will be funded in part through increased financing from development partners, 
and the government initiated a supplementary budget to cut expenditure on other budget 
items. PNG’s net borrowing for 2020 is projected to increase from 5% to 8.2% due to the 
reduction  in  revenue  and  expenditure  re-appropriations  for  2020.  This  will  increase  the 
gross domestic borrowing from a target of 40.3% to 49.8%. 
The pandemic has also had a significant social and economic impact, with an increase in 
poverty, unemployment and violence against women and children. 
The  government,  development  partners  and  domestic  institutions  have  prepared 
$769 million of countercyclical support or 3.2% of GDP (table 3). This includes $166 million 
for  health  and  safety,  $213  million  for  social  assistance,  food  security  and  protection  to 
vulnerable groups, and $390 million for MSMEs and other economic support. From the total 
support of $769 million, $444 million is directed through the budget, of which $332 million 
is  government  funded  and  $112  million  is  development  partner  financial  assistance. 
The additional  $324  million  of  support  is  from  domestic  institutions,  including  for  loan 
repayment  holidays, 
for  superannuation 
though  commercial  banks,  and  support 
withdrawals. 
The government funded portion of $332 million (K1.1 billion) is composed of (i) K645 million 
announced  stimulus package,  (ii) additional  infrastructure stimulus of K305 million within 
the supplementary budget, and (iii) K200 million of support for MSMEs through commercial 
banks.  By  midyear,  the  government  has  already  released  75%  of  the  expenditures 
announced form the K645 package, including for water, sanitation and hygiene programs 
for  districts  (K60.0  million),  medical  drug  and  PPE  procurement  in  the  Health  Sector 
(K67.0 million),  Reinforcing  security  and  defense  border  posts  (K113.0  million),  citizens 
repatriation program (K15.0 million), food distribution programs through Churches and City 
Authorities  (K5.0  million),  agriculture  market  development  for  Provinces  and  Districts 
(K111.0 million), and logistics support for MSME’s and households (K44.5 million). 
In the face of falling revenues of 3.4% of GDP, the government has announced the retention 
of  the  full  capital  works  budget  for  2020.  Overall  share  of  development  or  capital 
expenditure as share of total expenditure has been increased by 3%. With budget cuts of 
100% directed towards non-productive operational expenditure for 2020, the government 
has attempted, with the supplementary budget, to maintain a fiscal expansionary stance to 
stimulate the economy within its limited fiscal space. 
In May 2020, the government requested and received $363.3 million from the IMF under 
the RCF made available to fund COVID-19 expenditures. The loan proceeds financed the 
initial emergency response in health, helped to shore up foreign exchange reserves and 
execute  a  re-prioritized  capital  and  operational  budget  of  the  government,  where 
emergency expenditures in health and security were brought forward. The government has 
committed to post details of all procurement awarded under a National State of Emergency 
within  1  week,  present  weekly  reports  of  COVID-19  expenditures  in  the  Budget 
Management  Committee,  and  submit  a  consolidated  report  to  the  National  Executive 
Council published within 3 months of the end of the emergency period. 
Growth averaged 4.2% between 2015–2019, and 0.9% in the non-mineral economy, despite 
being impacted by multiple shocks—falling commodity prices, drought, and an earthquake.  
In  this  very  challenging  context,  fiscal  policy  has  generally  been  sound,  with  the  deficit 
averaging 3.9% over 2015–2019. The deficit was limited to 2.5% of GDP in 2017 and 2.6% 
of GDP in 2018, before a switch to a more expansionary fiscal policy in 2019, with a deficit 
of 4.9% of GDP, largely driven by increased capital expenditure, to stimulate growth of the 
economy; although, the deficit was also impacted by falling revenues associated with weak 
growth (revenues excluding grants fell to 14.1% of GDP in 2019 from 15.5% in 2018), and 
to  a  lesser  extent  revisions  in  nominal  GDP.  Additionally,  the  government  has  worked  to 
implement  fiscal  reform  measures,  including  revenue  raising  measures  under  a  Medium-
Term Revenue Strategy (2018–2022), guided by IMF technical assistance, and measures 
aimed  at  controlling  recurrent  expenditure  under  a  Medium  Term  Fiscal  Strategy  (2018–
2022),  although  progress  has  been  slower  than  hoped  for.  An  IMF  SMP  commenced  in 
February 2020, following a request from the Government to the IMF to oversee its reform 
agenda.

Inflation  averaged  5.3%  during  2015–2019  and  5.0%  during  2010–2014.  Key  drivers  of 
inflation  were  exchange  rate  movements,  commodity  price  fluctuations,  and  demand  pull 
associated with a large foreign direct investment, PNG LNG, a $19 billion liquified natural 
gas  plant  constructed  during  2010-2014.  Inflation  may  also  have  been  impacted  by  a 
program of purchasing government debt by the BPNG during 2014–2017; however, this was 
terminated and wound down from 2018 (BPNG holdings of Government debt increased from 
K766  million  in  December  2013,  to  K2.0  billion  in  December  2014,  and  to  K3.9  billion  in 
December  2016,  and  were steadily  reduced  thereafter,  falling  to  K1.9  billion as of March 
2020).  
The  Kina  Facility  Rate  is  the  BPNG’s  policy  rate;  it  was  held  at  6.25%  during  2015–July 
2019, above the rate of inflation; however, its effectiveness has been limited, as evidenced 
by its weak transmission to lending rates, which remain primarily determined by credit risk 
appetite,  and  to  deposit  rates,  which  remain  low  as  a  result  of  ample  system  liquidity. 
The exchange rate mechanism has also limited the effectiveness of the Kina Facility Rate. 
Key factors that influence PNG’s exchange rate are commodity price fluctuations and capital 
flows associated with foreign direct investment. The kina appreciated against the US dollar 
by 34.8% between June 2010 and June 2012, during a period of rising gold prices and large 
inflows of foreign currency associated with the construction phase of PNG LNG; central bank 
foreign exchange reserves grew to over $4 billion in 2012, compared to $2 billion in 2007. 
However, this trend reversed in 2013 as PNG LNG construction ended and as commodity 
prices began to slide. This put significant downward pressure on the kina, which depreciated 
by 26.3% between June 2013 and June 2014, as well as on international currency reserves, 
which reduced to $2.6 billion in July 2014. The central bank intervened to stem the pace of 
depreciation and loss of reserves by introducing in June 2014 a trading band and a policy of 
rationing foreign exchange. These interventions prevented the exchange rate and currency 
trading  from  adjusting  to  market  conditions,  finally  appearing  as  shortages  of  foreign 
exchange. A recent assessment by the IMF indicates that the currency remains overvalued 
by 12% to 18%. This  is evidenced by a reported backlog of foreign currency  orders (i.e., 
demand for foreign currency) with commercial banks, estimated at around $0.5 billion. This 
has impeded growth and inhibited investment. In this context, the IMF SMP recommends 
that PNG gradually devalue its currency, which could be achieved with a  real depreciation 
of  3%  to  5%  per  annum  over  a  period  of  3  years,  and  to  complement  this  with  seeking 
technical assistance for an appropriate exchange rate policy. During 2020, exchange rate 
depreciation picked up after the commencement of the IMF SMP (the kina depreciated by 
2.6%  versus  the  US  dollar,  between  January  and  September  2020).  In  addition,  the  IMF 
SMP  recommends  that  an  amount  of  at  least  $60  million  per  month  be  released  from 
reserves  under  the  SMP,  and  the  BPNG  is  broadly  on  track  with  this,  having  released 
$330  million as of July 2020, against an annual target under the IMF SMP of $720 million.  
The Department of Health released an Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan on 
2 March  2020,  outlining  a  framework  for  key  actions  needed  to  prepare  and  respond  to 
COVID-19.  On  23 March  2020,  a state  of emergency  was declared,  which  resulted in  a 
lockdown  of  the  economy  and  restrictions  on  movements  of  people.  An  Emergency  Act 
2020  was  passed  on  24  March  2020,  which  was  retroactively  applied  from  13  March, 
empowering  authorities  to  respond.  The  Police  Commissioner  was  appointed  as  the 
‘Emergency Controller’ by the Prime Minister. The borders were closed from 26 March and 
the first lockdown was from 23 March to 1 April. A second lockdown was from 29 July to 
14 August. The Emergency Act was superseded by the National Pandemic Act 2020, which 
was  passed  on  16  June  2020.  The  National  Pandemic  Act  outlined  the  legal  powers 
conferred to the Controller, including the imposition of border and quarantine controls, and 
financial  management  arrangements  for  the  medium-term  response  to  the  pandemic. 
On 17 June 2020, a NCC was established to manage the response and coordinate national 
government agencies and development partner support. The NCC is led by the Controller, 
and through the whole-of-government NCC governance structure, it is currently monitoring 
and  enforcing  11  Pandemic Measures  including governing  of  international  and  domestic 
travel,  provincial  coordination,  burial  of  deceased  persons,  customs  duties,  testing, 
surveillance,  businesses  and  social  events,  health  protocols,  and  public  transport 
restrictions in the capital. At present, physical borders are closed but land and sea borders 
remain porous. The only formal points of entry are Port Moresby’s airport for travellers, and 
the seaports of Port Moresby, Lae, Madang and Rabaul for cargo.

6.  Coordination 
with the IMF 
The government has initiated a countercyclical economic package to be implemented by 
various agencies to support the economy and the vulnerable through support for MSMES, 
food donation, freight subsidy scheme and superannuation support to those who have lost 
their jobs due to COVID-19 among others. 
The drastic economic and financial effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have deteriorated 
PNG’s growth prospects. The government’s limited capacity to generate sufficient revenues 
to fund its mounting expenditures in the face of the pandemic has widened the fiscal deficits 
which must then be covered by borrowing. The current deteriorating fiscal deficits will raise 
PNG’s public debt ratio to nearly 50% of GDP in 2020, well beyond the government’s 30% 
medium-term target. This has forced the government to request adoption of amendment to 
Fiscal  Responsibility  Act,  raising  the  legal  threshold  level  of  45%,  set  in  2019,  to  60%. 
Current upward pressures come on the back of a marked trend of rising public debt during 
recent years. Fiscal slippage, revaluation of foreign currency debt in 2018, and a revision 
of public debt to include some SOE project loans taken over by the government caused 
public  debt  to  rise  to  39.8%  in  2019  from  32.7%  of  GDP  in  2017.  Exceptionally  tough 
circumstances this year will likely see the debt ratio jump to 49.8%, and to stabilize above 
50% in the years to follow, as overall fiscal deficits are expected to more than outweigh 
economic growth’s downward pull on the debt ratio. 
Despite the IMF classifying PNG at high risk of debt distress, the DSAs conducted by ADB 
(and  the  ones  conducted  by  the  IMF/WB),  have  shown  that  the  drastic  outcome  of  the 
pandemic would be presenting themselves in the short to medium term and that over the 
longer term, as PNG’s major resource projects will continue to generate higher growth, the 
drastic  economic  effects  of  the  pandemic  would  gradually  dissipate.  Both  ADB’s  and 
IMF/WB’s  DSAs  point  to  the  fact that  as  breaches  of  debt services are either  one-off  or 
short  lived,  the  longer-term  sustainability  of  the  country’s  external  and  public  debt  are 
preserved. ADB’s assessment points to the gradual decline of the projected present value 
of the public debt-to-GDP to below 50% from 2024 and onwards (45% in IMF/WB’s DSA). 
Both DSAs reach the conclusion that the short-term breaches of the external debt service-
to-revenue  ratio  are  expected  to  be  financed  by  loans  with  concessional  terms.  ADB’s 
proposed loan, which represents 2.5% of PNG’s outstanding debt stock, is not expected to 
add significantly to the debt service obligations facing the government or affect PNG’s debt 
sustainability. 
ADB has been in close communication with the IMF on the CPRO. ADB undertook regular 
dialogue with the IMF on issues such as an assessment of the macroeconomic and fiscal 
situation, particularly related to how the increasing deficit would affect debt sustainability. 
ADB also sought the IMF’s views on the access criteria for this CPRO. The IMF commenced 
a SMP in Feb 2020, and ADB has been closely coordinating with the IMF on the SOE reform 
program, which is a benchmark in the SMP. When the IMF prepared its RCF and undertook 
a review of the SMP, the IMF sought ADB’s views on the economic outlook in the context 
of ADB’s budget support in 2020 and forward pipeline. In June 2020, the IMF disbursed 
$364 million to PNG, under a RCF and prepared an updated DSA. The RCF paper notes 
the need for additional financing support for PNG. The IMF’s RCF report is provided in lieu 
of an assessment letter.
