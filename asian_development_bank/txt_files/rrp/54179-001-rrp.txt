THE PROPOSAL 
1. 
I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant 
to the Republic of Vanuatu for the COVID-19 Fiscal Response Program (the program) under the 
Countercyclical Support Facility's COVID-19 pandemic response option (CPRO).1  
2. 
Vanuatu has avoided an outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) through decisive 
early  action  to  close  borders  and  adopt  prevention  and  containment  measures.  As  of 
12 November  2020,  the  country  had  only  one  confirmed  case  of  COVID-19  contained  in 
quarantine after being identified from a repatriation flight. Vanuatu's efforts to prevent the spread 
of COVID-19 have come at significant economic and social costs. The program will help finance 
the  implementation  of  the  government’s  countercyclical  response,  which  is  anchored  on  the 
Health Preparedness and Response Plan (HPRP) and the Economic Stimulus Program (ESP), 
to mitigate the socioeconomic consequences of COVID-19. The proposed program is aligned with 
four operational priorities of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Strategy 2030—(i) addressing 
remaining  poverty  and  addressing  inequalities,  (ii)  accelerating  progress  in  gender  equality, 
(iii) strengthening  governance  and  institutional  capacity,  and  (iv) promoting  rural  development 
and  food  security.2 It  is  also  aligned  with  the  Pacific  Approach  priority  of  managing  risks  and 
building  resilience  by  strengthening  the  health  and  agriculture  sectors.3 Vanuatu  meets  all  the 
CPRO access criteria (Table 1).4

Access Criteria 
1. Adverse

shocks 
ADB Staff Assessment 
After growing by 2.8% annually during 2015–2019, Vanuatu’s GDP is likely to contract by 9.8% 
in 2020 because of COVID-19-related declines in tourism, remittances, and exports, which are 
exacerbated by damages from Cyclone Harold. A fiscal deficit of 6.0% of GDP is expected in 
2020 driven by lower revenues and higher stimulus spending, after surpluses averaging 6.2% 
annually in 2018–2019. The expected current account deficit of 5.8% of GDP in 2020 compares 
with  an  average  annual  surplus  of  3.7%  in  2015–2019.  Up  to  70%  of  the  29,000  workers 
employed in tourism in 2019 could lose their jobs by the end of 2020. It is estimated that the pre-
COVID-19 share of the population living below $1.90/day was 13.9% in 2020. This could rise to 
18.3%, with a 10% decline in consumption due to COVID-19.  
The  government  is  implementing  a  $44  million  countercyclical  response  focusing  on  public 
health  and  the  economy.  The  HPRP  aims  to  prevent  the  import  of  COVID-19  and  mitigate 
infection risks while preparing to manage a potential outbreak through detection, isolation, and 
clinical management. The ESP seeks to alleviate the impact of COVID-19 on individuals and 
businesses. It includes employment support, grants and fee relief for MSMEs, and support for 
agricultural production and education to assist poor and vulnerable groups, including women. 
The  ESP  is  complemented  by  the  distribution  of  food  to  needy  households.  Assistance  to 
agriculture will be extended, and MSMEs will have access to credit of up to $90,000 at 1.0% 
interest to support the economic recovery. 
The  government's  pre-pandemic  macroeconomic  management  record  was  generally  sound. 
The  IMF  confirms  that  the  economy  was  growing,  prices  were  stable,  fiscal  balances  were 
aligned  with  the  economy's  cyclical  position,  and  foreign  exchange  reserves  were  strong. 
Vanuatu's economy grew by 2.9% in 2019 and was forecast to grow at a similar rate in 2020. 
Inflation was 2.8% in 2019 and was expected to remain within the Reserve Bank of Vanuatu's 
target of 0.0%–4.0% in 2020. The fiscal deficit fell from 7.3% of GDP in 2015 when Cyclone Pam 
damages  required  reconstruction  expenditures.  The  government  reported  a  fiscal  surplus  of 
4.9% of GDP in 2019. A fiscal deficit of 1.0% of GDP was expected in 2020 because of lower 
revenues from its citizenship program. Foreign exchange reserves were equivalent to about 12 
months of imports at the end of 2019 and were expected to remain at similar levels in 2020.

with the IMF 
Public health measures were implemented early to prevent COVID-19 from entering Vanuatu 
and to prepare the health system. Borders were closed on 23 March 2020, and a national state 
of  emergency  has  been  in  place  since  26  March  2020.  Repatriation  flights  commenced  after 
establishing  limited  testing  capacity  on  25  May  2020,  and,  with  a  single  case  of  COVID-19 
identified  from  the  repatriation  flights,  the  system  has  proven  to  work  well.  Hospitals  were 
upgraded, medical personnel were trained on infection prevention control and contact tracing, 
and  personal  protective  equipment  was  distributed  to  Vila  Central  Hospital  and  Northern 
Provincial Hospital. The government intends to maintain and expand public health programs and 
requested  ADB  support  to  prepare  for  introducing  a  COVID-19  vaccine  when  it  becomes 
available.  Measures  to  mitigate  the  pandemic's  economic  impact  were  implemented  early  to 
support employment, including 4-month salary-equivalent payments to affected businesses, fee 
relief for businesses, and grants for MSMEs, followed by education assistance. Support for food 
security  is  ongoing.  Support  for  credits  to  MSMEs  through  a  government-owned  bank  and 
support for the agriculture sector will be extended beyond 2020. 
The Joint World Bank–IMF June 2019 DSA found that Vanuatu was at moderate risk of debt 
distress. ADB's DSA, updated in October 2020, finds that Vanuatu's short-term growth prospects 
deteriorated  with  COVID-19,  and  countercyclical  policy  will  sharply  worsen  fiscal  balances. 
While  fiscal  deficits  put  Vanuatu's  public  debt  on  a  rising  path,  they  will  be  offset  by  higher 
economic  growth  in  the  longer  term.  The  government  intends  to  finance  fiscal  deficits  using 
development partner grants and domestic resources (including drawing down cash reserves). 
The  ADB  grant  will  enable  it  to  prioritize  spending  on  countercyclical  measures.  The  DSA 
concludes that with ADB grants, the public debt–GDP ratio will remain lower than the threshold 
of 60%, as per Vanuatu's Debt Management Strategy (2019–2022) and will be sustainable.  
The IMF supports ADB's response and provided an assessment letter. The letter presents the 
IMF's  views  on  debt  sustainability,  is  consistent  with  ADB's  DSA  findings,  and  reports  that 
Vanuatu's  risk  of  breaching  the  debt  threshold  will  be  elevated  if  another  disaster  occurs. 
ADB coordinates macroeconomic monitoring with the IMF, and Vanuatu is on a standard 12-
month  Article  IV  consultation  cycle.  The  country  continues  to  benefit  from  IMF  technical 
assistance  in  areas  including  foreign  exchange  reserve  management,  finance  sector 
supervision, and national statistics. ADB and the IMF also participate in annual public financial 
management partner meetings and share updates.

PROGRAM AND RATIONALE  
A. 
Background and Development Constraints 
3. 
Development context. Vanuatu is a small island developing state, vulnerable to natural 
hazards and global economic shocks. According to the World Risk Index Report, Vanuatu is the 
most  at  risk  of  disasters  from  natural  hazards  among  180  economies  worldwide. 5  It  had  a 
population  of  about  305,000  in  2019  and  is  ranked  141st  of  189  economies  for  human 
development.6 About  75%  of  the  population  lives  in  rural  areas.  The  main  contributors  to  the 
economy are tourism and agriculture (crops and livestock). Major exports are beef, cocoa, copra, 
kava,  and  timber.  Vanuatu  depends  on  imported  food,  fuels,  and  machinery  and  equipment. 
The  most  recent  national  data, from  2013,  shows  that  38.8%  of  people are multidimensionally 
poor (reflecting deprivations in health, education, and living standards), and another 32.3% are 
vulnerable  to  multidimensional  poverty. 7 Modeled  estimates  of  pre-COVID  poverty  levels  put 
13.9% of the population living below $1.90/day.8

Cyclone  damage.  Soon  after  the  global  outbreak  of  COVID-19,  Vanuatu  was  hit  by 
4. 
Cyclone Harold on 6–7 April 2020.  Cyclone Harold was the most severe storm to strike Vanuatu 
since Cyclone Pam in 2015. 9 It caused 3 deaths, affected 176,000 people, and damaged homes 
and  infrastructure.  Agricultural  produce  was  destroyed,  reducing  potential  exports  and 
jeopardizing food security. Damage and loss from Cyclone Harold are estimated at 51% of GDP 
in  2020.  Cyclone  Harold  compounded  the  socioeconomic  stress  caused  by  COVID-19  as  the 
government struggled to manage twin shocks. 
Health system challenges. Vanuatu's health system faced significant challenges even 
5. 
before  COVID-19,  including  shortages  of  health care  workers to  deliver services.10 As  of  June 
2020, more than 50 of 402 health facilities had closed because of inadequate staffing or absence 
of  routine  maintenance.11 Despite  these  hurdles,  women's  health  in  Vanuatu  has  improved—
skilled birth attendance rates are high, at about 90%, and maternal mortality ratios are declining 
(down  from  225  deaths  per  100,000  live  births  in  1990  to  72  in  2017).  However,  this  remains 
higher than the Sustainable Development Goal target of 70 deaths per 100,000 live births.12 The 
major causes of deaths in Vanuatu are cardiovascular diseases and diabetes, and those affected 
by these diseases are susceptible to severe COVID-19 symptoms.13 Vanuatu has established a 
24-bed isolation capacity and five ventilators in its hospitals to prepare for COVID-19. The country 
has a minimum 1-month supply of protective equipment, and more than 2,000 personnel were 
trained in contact tracing and management of COVID-19. Vanuatu has established local testing 
capacity but needs additional health sector support in the case of a COVID-19 outbreak.  
6. 
Prevention  and  containment  measures.  The  government  took  proactive  actions  to 
prevent cases, starting from January 2020. It announced the $6 million HPRP on 24 January 2020 
to  strengthen  prevention  and  containment  (para.  17)  and  protect  public  health.  This  included 
issuance  of  health  advisories,  health  screenings  at  airports  and  seaports,  and  progressive 
restrictions on international travel as the pandemic evolved—culminating in the closure of borders 
on 23 March 2020. A state of emergency was declared on 26 March 2020 and remains in effect 
until  31 December  2020.  Other  measures  implemented  include  social  distancing,  temporary 
closure  of  schools,  restrictions  on  interisland  travel,  limited  passengers  on  public  transport, 
cancellation  of  mass  gatherings  and  sporting  events,  early  closure  of  businesses,  and  an 
overnight  curfew.  Limited  testing  capacity  was  established  with  support  from  the  World  Health 
Organization  (WHO)  and  the  Pacific  Community. 14  The  government  allowed  the  phased 
repatriation  of  residents  stranded  abroad.15 Quarantine  processes  are  in  effect  for  all  inbound 
travelers to limit potential contact with the public. As of 12 November 2020, Vanuatu has only one 
confirmed case of COVID-19 in border quarantine. The government has since ceased repatriation 
flights and imposed domestic travel restrictions to minimize the risk of community transmission.

Effective from 12 November 2020, all travelers are required to provide a negative COVID-19 test result within 72-
hours of their departure. The quarantine period is also increased from 14 to 28 days.   
4 
Coordination of responses. The National COVID-19 Taskforce was formed in January 
7. 
2020 and merged into the National Disaster Management Office on 26 March 2020. The National 
Health Emergency Operations Centre under the Ministry of Health (MOH) has been coordinating 
COVID-19 preparedness activities. The capacity of the operations center was supplemented with 
support from development partners such as Australia, France, Israel, the Pacific Community, Red 
Cross, United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Population Fund, and WHO. 
Provincial health emergency operations centers were also set up.  
Pre–COVID-19 record of generally sound macroeconomic management. Vanuatu's 
8. 
economy  experienced  growth  from  2004  to  2019,  driven  by  expanding  tourism,  public 
investments, economic reforms, and a stable macroeconomy. Following Cyclone Pam in 2015, 
economic growth averaged 2.8% during 2015–2019, driven by construction and tourism. Inflation 
averaged  2.3%  over  the  same  period.  While  relief  and  rehabilitation  expenditure  resulted  in  a 
fiscal deficit of 7.3% in 2015, this was reduced subsequently, and fiscal surpluses averaging 6.2% 
of GDP were recorded in 2018 and 2019 (Table 2). Fiscal deficits largely related to Cyclone Pam 
reconstruction have led to a rise in public debt from 34.4% of GDP in 2015 to 44.4% of GDP in 
2019. Vanuatu's Debt Management Strategy (2019–2022) targets nominal public debt below 60% 
and external debt below 40% of GDP. The strategy targets concessional debt for investment only. 
Current  account  surpluses  were  recorded  in  2018  and  2019,  averaging  11.3%  of  GDP,  and 
foreign exchange reserves equaled about 12 months of imports at the end of 2019. The IMF also 
finds that the economy was growing, prices were stable, the external position was stronger than 
expected, and public finances were sound.16 Vanuatu was expecting a fiscal deficit in 2020, on 
the  back  of  declining  revenues  from  the  citizenship  by  investment  program,  and  this  had  also 
negatively impacted the expected current account deficit. Nonetheless, the performance was in 
line with the economy's cyclical position.

Transmission  mechanisms.  COVID-19  had  its  most  substantial  impact  on  Vanuatu's

tourism industry, which in 2019 contributed almost 35% of GDP, 67.3% of exports, and 29,000

jobs.17 Border closures have halted tourism, a source of income in urban and rural areas, and a 
key generator of foreign exchange and government revenue. Service exports are expected to fall 
by  68%  compared  with  2019.  Tourism  is  expected  to  recover  gradually,  given  the  economic 
slowdown in the two largest visitor source markets: Australia (52% of visitors) and New Zealand 
(13%). Remittances, estimated by the Reserve Bank of Vanuatu (RBV) at 13% of GDP in 2019, 
are expected to fall since workers cannot freely travel to Australia and New Zealand, which have 
dedicated  labor  mobility  schemes  for  the  Pacific.  More  than  10,000  workers  from  Vanuatu 
participate in seasonal work in Australia and New Zealand annually.18 
Economic  impacts.  Vanuatu's  economy  is  expected  to  contract  by  9.8%  in  2020 
10. 
(compared with 2.9% growth in 2019) because of COVID-19 and the impacts of Cyclone Harold. 
Other  key  macroeconomic  variables  are  expected  to  worsen  in  2020  (Table  2).  Vanuatu's 
merchandise  exports  are  expected  to  fall  by  43%  from  2019  because  of  lower  demand. 
The current account deficit is forecast at 5.8% of GDP in 2020 (compared with a surplus of 12.4% 
of GDP in 2019) because tourism stopped. Economic growth of 1.0% is expected in 2021, driven 
largely by a recovery in tourism, agriculture, and post-cyclone construction activities. The duration 
of the COVID-19 crisis poses significant risks to the outlook.  
11. 
Fiscal pressures. Declining tourism, combined with lower demand under the COVID-19 
containment  measures,  will  result  in  lower  domestic  revenue  in  2020. 19  The  government's 
countercyclical  response  will  further  strain  the  deteriorating  fiscal  position.  The  fiscal  deficit, 
projected to reach 6.0% of GDP in 2020 (footnote 19), will be financed by domestic loans and 
drawdown  of  cash  reserves  accumulated  from  fiscal  surpluses  in  2018  and  2019.  Economic 
recovery will require substantial resources beyond 2020. A fiscal deficit of 3.0% is projected in 
2021. The government intends to adhere to its debt strategies and maintain public debt below 
60% of GDP (and external debt below 40% of GDP), while the Debt Management Strategy (2019–
2022)  prevents  the  government  from  borrowing  for  operating  payments  (para.  8).  Financing 
options are, therefore limited. 
12. 
Increased risks in the finance sector. An extended period of tourism shutdown is likely 
to  cause  financial  difficulties  for  micro,  small,  and  medium-sized  enterprises  (MSMEs)  that 
operate  in  tourism  and  related  industries.  About  20%  of  MSMEs  are  owned  and/or  led  by 
women. 20  Failing  MSMEs  and  employment  losses  will  impact  the  commercial  banks'  loan 
performance and dampen prospects for Vanuatu's economic recovery.21 About 10% of bank loans 
are to the tourism sector, and 55% are for personal loans such as housing mortgages and car 
leases, whose servicing may become challenging. The nonperforming loan ratio was 15.5% in 
March 2020, increasing by 1.1 percentage points from September 2019.22 
13. 
Significant  poverty  and  social  impact.  It  is  estimated  that  Vanuatu's  share  of  the 
population living below $1.90/day could rise from 13.9% (para. 3) to 18.3%, with a 10% decline 
in  consumption  because  of  COVID-19  (footnote  6).  Poverty  is  higher  in  the  two  major  urban 
centers  of  Port  Vila  and  Luganville  than  in  rural  areas.  While  those  living  in  rural  areas  are 
vulnerable  to  multidimensional  poverty,  those  living  in  urban  areas  have  had  their  livelihoods 
impacted by the collapse in tourism. Tourism, which employed 29,000 formal workers (of whom

about 43% are women) in 2019, is the hardest hit, with estimates of up to 70% job losses by year-
end 2020.23 Job losses will exacerbate urban poverty since most of these workers live in urban 
centers  and  contribute  to  the  welfare  of  the  vulnerable  and  informal  sector  workers  through 
traditional support systems. While most tourism activities are in urban areas, the lack of demand 
for agricultural produce from hotels and restaurants affects rural incomes as well. Even before 
COVID-19, market vendors (of whom about 91% are women) were more vulnerable to poverty 
than  other  groups.  24 Interventions  to  prevent  the  entry  and  spread  of  COVID-19  have  already 
resulted  in  many  women  losing  their  livelihoods  in  the  formal  and  informal  sectors  (including 
market  vendors  and  lower-skilled  employees  in  hotels  and  restaurants).  Strict  measures  also 
resulted  in  declining  air  and  sea  freight  volumes,  which  restricts  the  availability  of  food. 
These impacts could reduce assets, increase personal debt burdens, and lower food intake or 
the quality of intake—with long-term detrimental effects on social welfare.  
Impact  of  both  disasters  on  health.  The  co-occurrence  of  Cyclone  Harold  and  the 
14. 
COVID-19  pandemic made  it  even  more  difficult for  Vanuatu's  health  system to  overcome  the 
impacts on health and well-being. These include interrupted access to health services, damaged 
medical equipment such as the immunization cold chain, limited availability of essential medicines 
and equipment because of disrupted supply chains, damaged crops undermining food supply and 
nutrition,  and  contaminated  water  sources  catalyzing  the  spread  of  diseases.  Preliminary  data 
show  an  increase  in  diarrheal  diseases,  respiratory  infections,  leptospirosis,  typhoid,  dengue, 
malnourishment,  skin  infections,  and  an  elevated  risk  of  mental  illness  from  evacuation  and 
unemployment.25 The gains made in improving women's health are likely to be compromised by 
an outbreak of COVID-19, particularly if funding for essential services is not maintained. The WHO 
Country Preparedness and Response Status for Vanuatu remains at Level 2 as of June 2020 in 
the response category "high risk of imported cases," indicating the need for significant support.26 
life-saving  emergency  obstetric  care,

Gender impacts. In addition to job losses by women (para. 13), COVID-19 will exacerbate 
gender  inequalities.  The  prioritization  of  COVID-19  responses  threatens  women's  continued 
access to maternal and reproductive health services, a particular issue in Vanuatu where maternal 
mortality  ratios  are  still relatively  high (para.  5).27 Poor  access  to  basic  health  services,  limited 
availability  of 
infrastructure,  difficult 
transportation, and delayed referrals of life-threatening conditions are major contributing factors. 
The  lifetime  prevalence  of  intimate  partner  violence  is  high  in  Vanuatu,  with  60%  of  women 
reporting  some  form  of  this.  The  COVID-19 threat  and  associated  movement restrictions  have 
increased gender-based violence (GBV) while simultaneously making it more difficult for women 
and girls to access services. Data from GBV service providers suggest that already high levels of 
GBV are rising further, and reports of sexual exploitation as a result of economic hardship and 
economic abuse by partners are increasing.

Government Responses to COVID-19 
16. 
The  government's  countercyclical  response  to  COVID-19  amounts  to  5.2%  of  GDP, 
focusing  on  health  since  January  2020  and  providing  economic  stimulus  since  April  2020.

to alleviate the socioeconomic impact of the pandemic on individuals and businesses. The initial 
response to COVID-19 (paras. 6–7) was put in place before a new coalition government assumed 
office on 20 April 2020. The new administration focused on immediate cyclone relief as well as 
mitigation  of  COVID-19  impacts.  It  announced  additional  components  of  the  countercyclical 
response  to support  economic recovery—$26.7 million  support to MSMEs  with  credit  provided 
through  a  government-owned  bank  beyond  2020  and  expanded  support  to  agriculture  with  a 
$10.6 million program in 2021 targeting agricultural production and employment while ensuring 
the availability of fresh and nutritious food. The government's countercyclical response to COVID-
19 will continue until December 2021, and several key measures are already being implemented 
(paras. 17–21).  
1. 
Health Protection  
The HPRP, implemented by MOH, outlines (i) containment measures to prevent the import 
17. 
of cases and interrupt local transmission through quarantine of clusters of sporadic cases; and 
(ii) mitigation measures to  prevent  community  outbreaks through  isolation,  infection  prevention 
control,  enhanced  contact  tracing  and  surveillance,  and  risk  communication  in  communities. 
The  HPRP  adheres  to  the  WHO's  recommended  operational  guidelines  for  COVID-19 
responses.28 Of the $6 million health budget, 20% is allocated for infrastructure; 40% for clinical 
management  of  suspected  cases;  23%  for coordination,  communications,  and  prevention;  and 
17% for early detection and isolation. Personal protective equipment was provided to all health 
care  workers  who  would  tend  to  COVID-19  patients  in  Vila  Central  Hospital  and  Northern 
Provincial  Hospital.  More  than  2,000  public  and  health  care  workers  were  trained  in  contact 
tracing  to  improve  surveillance  and  clinical  management  of  COVID-19.  MOH  is  also  intent  on 
improving  community  awareness  through  ongoing  public  information  campaigns,  including  a 
dedicated online information page on key measures to prevent and contain the virus's spread.29 
Hospitals  were  refurbished,  24  isolation  beds  were  prepared,  and  local  testing  capacity  was 
established.  MOH  plans  to  keep  expanding  laboratory  facilities,  isolation  wards,  and  refresher 
training  in  the  medium-  and  long-term.  Measures  to  prevent  and  respond  to  GBV  were  also 
introduced (para. 34). The government intends to maintain and expand public health programs 
and requested ADB support to prepare for the introduction of COVID-19 vaccines, once available. 
2. 
Economic Support 
18. 
The  government's  $38 million  initial  economic  support  will  alleviate  the  impact  of fewer 
employment  opportunities  and  business  activities  and  provide  social  protection. 30  The  ESP 
comprises the following measures.  
(i)  Employment stabilization payment—$22.2 million. The government prioritized job 
protection in recognition of the important role of informal social protection networks, 
whereby  those  with  paid  employment  support  extended  families  and  communities. 
The traditional social protection system has been an integral part of Vanuatu's post-
disaster relief and recovery efforts. The employment stabilization payment supports 
in  businesses  affected  by  COVID-19.  The  government  reimburses  affected 
businesses  with  up to  $260  per  employee  on their  payroll  per month  for  4 months 
(April–August). As a further incentive to retain employees, employers receive a further 
12% of the amount they are reimbursed for employee wages for contributions to the 
Vanuatu National Provident Fund (VNPF) and administrative costs. The support was 
available to all industries affected by COVID-19. The scheme is available to all 7,391

registered  employers  in  the  VNPF  and  supports  an  estimated  6,000  of  77,231 
employees  (29,530  women  and  47,701  men)  registered  with  the  VNPF. 31  The 
scheme also includes part-time and casual workers who are registered with the VNPF. 
About 40% of beneficiaries will be women.32 Payments for claims will be processed 
retroactively and be made until the end of 2020.  
(ii)  Grants  to  micro,  small,  and  medium-sized  enterprises—$3.5  million.  With  an 
annual turnover of less than $1.7 million, MSMEs can access a maximum grant of 
$520 to support their operating cash flow requirements. About 450 of 1,500 potential 
recipients  are  MSMEs  owned  or  co-owned  by  women.  Recipients  also  include 
licensed holders of small market stalls. The government waived business license fees 
for 2020 or, if these were paid before 31 March 2020, will waive the fees for 2021. 
(iii)  Agriculture  support—$3.5  million.  The  government  will  also  support  increased 
production and marketing of copra, kava, cocoa, and other commodities through price 
subsidies and transportation assistance from farms to urban centers. Price subsidies 
will  supplement  the  incomes  of  smallholder  farmers  and  allow  larger  farmers  to 
employ more  workers.  About  31,650  households  engaged  in  cash  crop production 
could benefit from this support.33  
(iv)  Tuition fee grant—$4.5 million. Support for households has primarily been through 
the exemption of the 2020 tuition fees for early childhood care and education, and 
primary  and  secondary  education,  along  with  exemptions  of  several  other  school 
fees—92,644  primary  and  secondary  students  (48%  girls)  will  be  able  to  continue 
schooling despite hardships faced by their families. Support for early childhood care 
allows working mothers to balance work and caregiving responsibilities.  
(v)  Tax  and  fee  exemptions—$4.3  million.  Additional  measures  include  (a) rent  tax 
exemptions for property owners, (b) road tax exemptions for MSMEs and individuals, 
(c)  residence  and  work permit  exemptions to  encourage  nonresidents to  remain  in 
Vanuatu, and (d) exemptions from other fees and charges applying to MSMEs and 
individuals. 
19. 
Support from the finance sector. In addition to the HPRP and ESP support, the RBV 
set up a disaster recovery and import-export facility of up to $10 million to assist exporters and 
importers.  The  RBV  also  reduced  official  interest  rates  from  2.90%  to  2.25%  and  the  capital 
adequacy  ratio  from  12%  to  10%  to  align  with  expansionary  fiscal  policies.  It  requires  foreign 
commercial  banks  to  seek  prior  approval  for  repatriation  of  capital  as  an  exchange  control 
measure. Formal social protection is available to 53% of Vanuatu's workforce through the VNPF, 
including those who are informally employed but have registered with the VNPF through voluntary 
contributions (footnote 34). VNPF members who lost their jobs because of the COVID-19 crisis 
can  access  interest-free  hardship  relief  loans  up  to  $850.  Commercial  banks  in  Vanuatu  also 
offered repayment relief to their customers.  
Other  government-supported,  pro-poor  programs.  Vanuatu  has  no  formal  social 
20. 
protection schemes for those who do not contribute to the VNPF. Still, the government supports 
international and local nongovernment organizations (NGOs) that assist the poor and vulnerable. 
The  Department  of  Agriculture  promotes  the  production  of  root  crops,  vegetables,  and  fish  by 
providing seedlings and fingerlings for backyard gardening and fish farms to ensure affordable 
food supply.34 The  National  Disaster Management Office, MOH, and several  NGOs  distributed 
31 Of  the  workers  accessing  support,  683  are  staff  of  government-owned  enterprises.  Of  these,  438  Air  Vanuatu

food, health, and nutrition supplements to about 55,000 vulnerable families affected by COVID-
19 restrictions and Cyclone Harold, which benefited many elderly people, children, people with 
disabilities,  and  pregnant  women.  This  included  distributing  nutritional  supplements  to 
malnourished children under 5 years in partnership with local NGOs and UNICEF. A $6 million 
cash-transfer program, funded by development partners and piloted in partnership with Oxfam, 
will support vulnerable households outside the employment stabilization program. The Ministry of 
Trade, Tourism, and Industry is training farmers on food processing to add value to their produce 
and improve livestock management and fish farming skills. 
Recovery targeted. The initial $3.5 million support for agriculture under the ESP will be 
21. 
supplemented by $10.6 million financing in 2021 for ongoing agricultural assistance programs. 
This  includes  targeting  partnerships  with  the  private  sector  to  deliver  extension  services,  food 
crop  planting  materials,  and  additional  markets;  and  will  also  assist  mechanization.  To  further 
boost economic recovery, the government will provide $26.7 million in financing to support lending 
to MSMEs beyond 2020. MSMEs will be able to borrow up to $90,000 at an interest rate of 1.0%.   
C. 
Proposed Program, Impact and ADB's Value Addition 
22. 
Proposed program. ADB's fiscal response program will help the government implement 
its  countercyclical  measures  to  mitigate  the  adverse  socioeconomic  impacts  of  COVID-19. 
The program will provide the government with the fiscal space to meet critical public health needs 
while managing the effects of the economic downturn on vulnerable groups and businesses. It is 
aligned with the following overarching development objective: adverse impact of the COVID-19 
pandemic on the economy, health systems, and social services minimized. The program outcome 
will be: adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on individuals and businesses mitigated. The 
three program outputs are: (i) health sector responses to COVID-19 implemented; (ii) measures 
for  supporting  employment  and  businesses  implemented;  and  (iii) food  security  and  education 
support programs implemented. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. 
23. 
ADB's value addition. The program builds on a strong base of country knowledge and 
relationships that supported investments in infrastructure, public sector management, and private 
sector  development. 35  To  enhance  COVID-19  preparedness,  ADB  provided  test  cartridges, 
swabs,  and  other  medical  supplies  totaling  $0.9  million. 36  ADB  also  provided  support  for 
quarantine facilities, human resources, and the expansion of isolation facilities.37 A regional health 
project is strengthening immunization programs and access to quality-assured safe vaccines at 
affordable  prices. 38 Additional  financing  of  $3.8  million  is  proposed  under  the  regional  health 
project  to  upgrade  cold  chains,  strengthen  surveillance,  and  procurement  of  the  COVID-19 
vaccine,  once  available.  ADB  will  also  support  one  long-term  economic  advisor  in  the  Prime 
Minister's  office  to  provide  policy  advice  on  economic  recovery,  and  another  in  the  Ministry  of 
Finance and Economic Management (MFEM) to strengthen the oversight and monitoring of state-
owned  enterprises.39 Technical  assistance  is  available  to  support  the  government  in  collecting 
gender-based data and monitoring social implications, including the impact on women.40

The program is complemented by a contingent disaster financing program ($5.0 million 
grant)  to  strengthen  resilience  to  disasters  triggered  by  natural  hazards  and  future  health 
emergencies. 41  In  addition,  an  urban  infrastructure  project  ($9.6  million  grant)  to  construct 
climate-resilient multipurpose community shelters that can also be used as triage facilities is under 
preparation. 42 ADB will also complement the program with a proposed project ($3.5 million grant) 
to assist informal workers and other vulnerable groups.43 ADB will provide additional financing to 
improve the connectivity of the outer islands and complement the government's extended support 
for agriculture.44 Infrastructure projects will play a critical role in stimulating growth and support 
the recovery from COVID-19. ADB will provide grants and concessional loans for energy access, 
urban infrastructure, and maritime transport during 2020–2023.45 
25. 
Development  partner  coordination.  Effective  development  partner  coordination  has 
enabled  sequenced  financing  and  supplementation  of  government  capacity  in  preparing  the 
health  sector  (para.  7). ADB  consulted  with the World  Bank, the  IMF,  Australia,  New  Zealand, 
the  European  Union,  and  other  development  partners  on  Vanuatu's  financing  needs  and  the 
timing of support. The World Bank, the European Union, Australia, and New Zealand provided 
budget  support.  Australia  and  the  People's  Republic  of  China  contributed  essential  medical 
equipment and supplies. For the public health response, ADB worked closely with United Nations 
agencies in Vanuatu, including UNICEF and WHO, on technical support for health preparedness 
and  response. 46  The  IMF  provides  advisory  and  technical  support  with  macroeconomic 
assessments and monetary and financial policy advice, which is in addition to staff consultations 
and  Article  IV  requirements.  The  IMF  shares  its  assessment  reports  with  the  ADB.  IMF  was 
consulted  as  the  COVID-19  crisis  evolved  and  prepared  an  assessment  letter  to  confirm  that 
Vanuatu's  macroeconomic  policy  before  COVID-19  had  generally  been  sound  and  that  the 
pandemic significantly impacted Vanuatu's economy (footnotes 16 and 22). 
26. 
Lessons.  The  proposed  program  applies  lessons  from  ADB's  experience  in  providing 
economic  recovery  support  in  the  Pacific  during  the  2008–2009  global  financial  crisis. 47 
Earlier programs demonstrated the need to support aggregate demand while safeguarding the 
fiscal  position  and  the  role  of  development  partner  coordination  in  a  comprehensive  crisis 
response.  ADB's  past  engagement  with  Vanuatu  highlighted 
to  overcome 
implementation capacity constraints. Accordingly, the new program will use existing government 
mechanisms for program monitoring and implementation. The ESP implementation will rely on 
the existing database and records of the VNPF and key government agencies to verify potential 
beneficiaries'  eligibility.  Tuition  fee  assistance  will  use  the  existing  school  grant  procedures. 
To supplement the implementation capacity, ADB is mobilizing extensive TA support (para. 23).

Development Financing Needs, Budget Support and Debt Sustainability 
27. 
Reduced government revenues and higher countercyclical development expenditures will 
lead  to  a  larger  financing  need  in  2020  than  initially  expected  (Table  3).  A  fiscal  deficit  of 
$51.1 million (6.0% of GDP) is estimated in 2020, and $26.5 million in 2021 (para. 11). The CPRO 
budget  support  is  financing  17.4%  of  the  total  financing  needs  for  2020.  Other  development 
partners  have  disbursed  budget  support  grants  equivalent  to  $29.0  million  in  2020.  Domestic 
resources include $12.7 million in domestic debt and use of $38.4 million in cash reserves. It is

The government has requested a grant not exceeding $16.925 million from ADB's Special 
28. 
Funds resources (Asian Development Fund) to help finance the program. The grant proceeds will 
support development financing needs, excluding ineligible items.48  
Vanuatu's  public  and  publicly  guaranteed  debt  was  44.4%  of  GDP  in  2019,  of  which 
29. 
domestic debt was 5.2% of GDP.49 Vanuatu is considered to be at moderate risk of debt distress 
based on the IMF's 2019 debt sustainability analysis. A substantial component of the public debt 
was  to  finance  the  post-Cyclone  Pam  reconstruction  activities  and  infrastructure  investments. 
ADB's  October  2020  debt  sustainability  analysis  suggests  that  without  grants  from  its 
development  partners,  the  debt–GDP  ratio  will  breach  the  threshold  of  60%  by  2024. 
However,  with  grants,  the  public  debt–GDP  ratio  will  reach  48.7%  by  2024  and  remain 
sustainable. 50  The  government  intends  to  use  development  partner  grants  and  domestic 
resources  (including  the  drawdown  of  cash  reserves)  to  meet  its  financing  needs  in  2020. 51 
The IMF's September 2020 assessment finds that even though the risk of debt distress remains 
moderate, risks will be elevated with another disaster (footnotes 16 and 22). 
E. 
Implementation Arrangements 
30. 
The  program  will  be  implemented  from  1  February  2020  to  31  December  2021,  using 
primarily existing mechanisms and platforms (para. 26). The MFEM will be the executing agency. 
The government formed an implementation team to execute, supervise, and monitor compliance 
with  set  guidelines,  and  ensure  communication  and  information  dissemination  to  potential 
beneficiaries.  The  implementing  agencies  are  MOH  for  health  measures,  the  Ministry  of 
Agriculture,  Livestock,  Forestry,  Fisheries  and  Biosecurity  and  the  Ministry  of  Education  and 
Training. Through the MFEM, the government will monitor budget execution under the ESP and 
48 List of Ineligible Items (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).

produce quarterly and midyear reports. The government also separated bank accounts and cost 
centers to facilitate reporting and monitoring. While general capacity constraints exist, risks are 
mitigated  because  the  government  has  successfully  implemented  countercyclical  measures 
through its regular systems. ADB technical assistance will support the government in collecting 
sex-disaggregated data and monitoring social implications, including the impact on women (para. 
23). Grant proceeds will be withdrawn in accordance with ADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook 
(2017, as amended from time to time).  
III. 
DUE DILIGENCE 
31. 
Safeguards. In compliance with ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the program 
is  classified  as  category  C  for  environment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples 
safeguards. 52  The  actions  were  assessed  and  are  not  expected  to  have  any  adverse 
environmental or social safeguard impacts within the meaning of the Safeguard Policy Statement.  
32. 
Poverty  and  social.  Despite  Vanuatu's  lack  of  formal  social  protection  programs,  the 
employment  stabilization  payments  will  prevent  affected  workers  from  falling  into  poverty. 
They  will  also  generate  traditional  support  for  those  outside  the  formal  support  schemes. 
Assistance  to  MSMEs  will  help  them  stay  in  business,  including  self-employed  workers  who 
depend on a single income source, such as market stall owners. Households have been relieved 
of  paying  school  fees,  estimated  at  $290,  equivalent  to  3  months  of  household  income.  Most 
producers in Vanuatu are smallholder farmers. Support for agriculture will address food security 
and provide income to help meet nonfood essentials such as access to basic services, transport, 
and communication, especially during the pandemic. Support to agriculture will be expanded in 
2021. Transport and logistics are significant constraints and a critical cost component of supply 
chains  for  cocoa,  copra,  and  other  crops.  Assistance  from  the  stimulus  package  will  support 
smallholder farmers to maximize income opportunities from cash crops. Distribution of food and 
health supplies to an estimated 55,000 households complements the ESP (para. 20).  
Gender.  The  program  is  categorized  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming.53 The  health 
33. 
response to COVID-19 ensures that (i) health workers in hospitals and subnational laboratories, 
including 40% women, receive personal protective equipment; (ii) proactive health messages on 
COVID-19  and  pregnancy,  childbirth,  and  breastfeeding  are  disseminated  widely;  (iii)  nutrition 
supplies are provided to 3,000 pregnant and lactating women, and children; and (iv) funding for 
maternal  and  reproductive  health  services  will  be  continued.  Also,  socioeconomic  impacts  on 
women  will  be  mitigated  through  support  for  employment  and  MSMEs.  The  ESP  also  assists 
businesses owned by women in retaining employees and supports female employees in "at risk" 
industries. The one-off grant provided to MSMEs will benefit women-owned businesses (about 
18% of all MSMEs), including licensed microentrepreneurs such as market vendors. Public sector 
employment, where women make up 40% of the workforce, will be maintained. Free tuition was 
introduced for early childhood education and public schools to reduce hardships and safeguard 
previous gender gap reductions in education enrollment.  
34. 
Finally, measures taken to prevent and respond to GBV include (i) activation of the gender 
and protection subcommittee; (ii) provision of remote GBV services (through a telephone hotline); 
(iii)  continued  employment  of  all  GBV  staff  (45  staff  in  five  centers);  (iv) upgrade  of  centers  to 
include additional handwashing facilities; (v) public campaigns in national newspapers to provide 
information on GBV and COVID-19; (vi) activation of "authorized persons" to help women access 
services  in  rural  areas;  (vii)  police  training  on  GBV  and  the  provision  of  police  rotations  to

investigate GBV; and (viii) agreement that GBV prevention and response services are mandated 
as "essential services" in states of emergency and lockdown.  
35. 
Governance.  A  public  expenditure  and  financial  accountability  self-assessment  was 
completed in 2015. Subsequently, the MFEM prepared a Public Financial Management Reform 
Roadmap 2017–2021.  54 The road map focuses on (i) enhancing controls to ensure compliance 
in procurement, debt management, and payroll management; (ii) adopting medium-term planning 
and budgeting; (iii) strengthening budget accountability; (iv) improving domestic revenue; and (v) 
improving public investment and asset management. Vanuatu has recently improved its rank from 
71st  in  2017  to  64th  of  180  economies  in  2018  and  2019  in  Transparency  International's 
Corruption Perception Index.55 Development partners such as Australia and the European Union 
have  supported  public  financial  management  improvements  in  Vanuatu.  ADB's  Anticorruption 
Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government. 
36.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in 
the risk assessment and risk management plan.56

response, including additional support if required. Other initiatives in 
the  pipeline  will  continue  to  support  private  sector  investment, 
alternative employment and generate additional economic activities. 
ADB  will  coordinate  with  other  development  partners  to  provide 
emergency support guided by follow-on International Monetary Fund 
assessments.  ADB  is  providing  contingent  disaster  financing  for 
future disasters caused by natural hazards and health emergencies.

ADB Staff Assessment 
Vanuatu's  economy  is  forecasted  to  decline  significantly  in  2020  as  a 
result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Its economic growth averaged 2.8% 
from  2015 to  2019.  As  of  12  November  2020,  the  country  reported  its 
first  confirmed  case  of  COVID-19  from  a  repatriation  flight,  in  border 
quarantine.  Although  Vanuatu  did  not  have  any  confirmed  cases  of 
COVID-19  until  11  November  2020,  border  closures  have  stopped  all 
visitor arrivals since April 2020.  
With tourism declining significantly and agricultural crops damaged due 
to Cyclone Harold, the economy is forecast to decline by 9.8% in 2020.  
 
Without tourism, the government's tax revenues are expected to decline 
significantly, and combined with higher expenditures related to COVID-
19, lead to reduced fiscal buffers. A fiscal deficit equivalent to 6.0% of 
GDP  is  projected  in  2020,  and  a  further  deficit  of  3.0%  is  projected  in 
2021.  
With higher levels of expenditure and reduced revenue, the government 
relies on development partner grants and domestic resources (including 
cash reserves to meet financing shortfalls. At the end of 2019, Vanuatu 
had foreign exchange reserves equivalent to about 12 months of imports. 
Given  their  high  pre-pandemic  levels,  foreign  exchange  reserves  are 
expected  to  remain  adequate  despite  a  decline  in  tourism  and  export 
earnings. The final magnitude of the economic losses will depend on how 
the outbreak evolves and the tourism industry's recovery.  
The  government's  measures  for  addressing  COVID-19  impact  are 
included in a HPRP and an ESP.  
The  HPRP  has  been  iterated  with  the  evolution  of  the  pandemic  with 
assistance  from  the  World  Health  Organization.  This  plan  focuses  on 
preventing  the  virus  from  entering  the  country  and  getting  the  country 
ready  if  it  enters,  particularly  the  health  sector.  Increasing  preventive 
measures have been introduced since late January 2020 through travel 
advisories, border closures, and quarantine measures. The government 
is  conducting  community  awareness,  strengthening  public  health 
systems, and enhancing preparedness for effective case management 
while maintaining essential health services. 
 
includes  revenue  measures  and  several 
The  $38  million  ESP 
expenditure  measures.  Approximately  60%  of  this  stimulus  package 
consists  of  a  pro-employment  countercyclical  expenditure  program  to 
support those likely to lose jobs because of the pandemic. Another 9% 
is  allocated  to  help  MSMEs  to  retain  workers.  The  MSMEs  are  also 
supported by revenue exemptions to reduce businesses' operating costs 
to mitigate insolvency.  
CPRO Criteria 
and indicators

23 
The  revenue  measures  include  exemptions  for  business  license  fees, 
turnover taxes, rent tax, work permit fees, and several other smaller fees. 
The  central  bank  has  also 
reduced  banks'  capital  adequacy 
requirements and policy interest rates to facilitate lower interest costs. 
The government commenced the implementation of its stimulus program 
approved on 30 March 2020.  
On 10 April 2020, the government mandated the implementation of the 
Family  Protection  Act  and  prioritized  preventing  and  responding  to 
domestic violence.  
Following  initial  short-term  measures,  the  government  has  planned 
significant  support  to  the  agricultural  sector  to  facilitate  economic 
recovery and ensure food security. The government has also provided 
additional  liquidity  to  government-owned  commercial  banks  to  support 
MSMEs through the provision of credit. 
3. Pre-shock  
  Record of  
  Generally 
Sound Macro-  
  economic  
  Management 
record  of  generally  sound 
The  government  has  a  pre-shock 
macroeconomic  management.  The  economy  grew  by  an  average  of 
2.8% between 2015 and 2019. Economic growth was driven by tourism 
growth  and  post-Cyclone-Pam  reconstruction  activities.  Prices  were 
relatively  stable,  with  inflation  averaging  2.2%  over  the  same  period, 
within the Reserve Bank of Vanuatu's target range of 0%–4. The fiscal 
deficit was high in 2015 due to relief and reconstruction needs following 
Cyclone Pam but was reduced in the following years.  
 
4. Structural 
  Reforms 
  (including 
   health  
  response) 
As a result of significant reconstruction requirements following Cyclone 
Pam in 2015 and a large existing infrastructure pipeline, external debt 
rose from 25.6% of GDP in 2015 to 39.1% of GDP in 2019. The current 
account surpluses averaged 3.7% from 2015 to 2019. Foreign exchange 
reserves  were  equivalent  to  about  12 months  of imports  at  the  end  of 
2019. 
As  of  12  November  2020,  Vanuatu  had  only  one  confirmed  case  of 
COVID-19  contained  in  quarantine  after  being  identified  from  a 
repatriation flight.  
With  a  fragile  health  system,  further  compromised  by  damages 
sustained  as  a  result  of  Cyclone  Harold,  which  would  quickly  be 
overwhelmed  if  the  virus  arrived  and  spread  rapidly,  the  government 
implemented  strong  measures  to  prevent  the  entry  of  the  virus  and 
prepare the country, particularly the health system, for an outbreak.  
 
Borders  were  closed  on  23 March,  and  a  national  state  of  emergency 
was declared on 26 March 2020. It has since been renewed and was last 
extended  to  the  end  of  2020.  The  government's  Preparedness  and 
Response  Plan  developed  in  February  2020  and  iterated  with  the 
evolution of the pandemic, covers coordination and response, prevention

transmission, 
of 
risk  communications,  surveillance,  and  clinical 
management. The  plan  is  being  iterated  with  the  evolving  COVID-19 
situation.  
Hospitals have been upgraded, particularly isolation units, which for use 
as  intensive  care  units;  medical  personnel  are  trained  on  infection 
prevention, control, and contact tracing to improve surveillance; testing 
equipment  and  medical  supplies  have  been  procured;  and  public 
awareness  campaigns  are  underway.  Development  partners  have 
provided funding to supplement the government's efforts. 
5. Debt 
Sustainability 
The IMF’s 2019 DSA found that Vanuatu was at moderate risk of debt 
distress  and  could  take  on  more  concessional  borrowing.  Public  debt 
remains sustainable, but its rising trend adds to fiscal vulnerabilities.  
 
ADB's  DSA,  updated  in October  2020,  finds that  Vanuatu's short-term 
growth  prospects  have  deteriorated  with  COVID-19  and 
that 
countercyclical policy will sharply deteriorate fiscal balances. The DSA 
finds that higher fiscal deficits put Vanuatu's public debt on a rising trend, 
with public debt–GDP projected to rise from 44.4% in 2019 to more than 
55.0% in 2020. The higher fiscal deficit will be partially offset by higher 
economic  growth  over  the  longer  term.  The  DSA  concludes  that 
Vanuatu's  public  debt  level  is  sustainable,  as  most  debt  is  on 
concessional  terms.  Without  grant  support  for  Vanuatu,  public  debt  is 
likely to reach unsustainable levels. 
Public  external  debt  constitutes  about  70%  of  the  total  debt  stock 
outstanding. It is mostly contracted on concessional terms, which keeps 
borrowing costs low and limits rollover and interest-rate risks. However, 
the  foreign-currency  denomination  of  the  external  debt  constitutes 
currency risk.  
Additional  risks  stem  from  the  country's  heavy  exposure  to  disasters 
triggered by natural hazards. Air Vanuatu was financially exposed, and 
the government was likely to be required to guarantee debt servicing.  
IMF has assessed that Vanuatu remains at moderate risk of debt distress 
post-COVID-19,  and  risks  have  been  elevated  compared  to  its  2019 
assessment.  
ADB  and  IMF  collaborate  closely  on  macroeconomic  monitoring  and 
policy issues in Vanuatu.  
 
The IMF shares updates from missions and the IMF are updated about 
ADB's  investment  pipeline  in  Vanuatu.  IMF  is  supportive  of  the  ADB 
response and has provided an assessment letter.
