THE PROPOSAL 
1. 
I  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  (i)  a  proposed 
loan from the ordinary capital resources of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) (A loan); and (ii) 
a proposed loan funded by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Infrastructure 
Fund  (B  loan),  both  to  the  Republic  of  Indonesia  for  the  Integrated  Participatory  Development 
and Management of Irrigation Program.1 
The  program  will  support  the  Government  of  Indonesia  in  implementing  its  irrigation 
2. 
improvement  program  (IIP),  2015–2025, 2  which  advances  the  overarching  agenda  of  food 
security and rural poverty reduction through increased and improved water delivery.3 The focus 
of  the  ADB  support  will  be  on  improving  irrigation  system  operation,  maintenance,  and  water 
delivery to farmers. The program will finance a time slice of the government’s IIP in 74 districts. 
The International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) is providing parallel financing to the 
Ministry of Agriculture for improved delivery of agricultural services to maximize the benefits of 
the irrigation improvements.4 
A. 
Strategic Context   
II. 
THE PROGRAM 
3. 
Boosting rural incomes and improving food security are significant concerns in Indonesia. 
Poverty  is  still  predominantly  rural,  with  poverty  rates  in  rural  areas  1.8  times  higher  than  in 
urban  areas.5 Millions  of  people  derive  their  incomes  from  food  production,  and  food  is  the 
single  largest  expenditure  item  for  the  vast  majority  of  households.6 Despite  positive  trends  in 
agricultural  production,  Indonesia  still  faces  rising  food  imports,  higher  domestic  food  prices, 
and  sporadic  food  shortages.  Key  agricultural  products  include  rice,  soybean,  corn,  fruit,  and 
vegetables.  With  most  of  the  rice  coming  from  irrigated  areas,  water  resources  and  irrigation 
management  play  an  important  role  in  the  country’s  efforts  to  increase  agricultural  output.7 
However,  water  availability  to  the  farm  community  is  erratic  in  many  areas.  The  Ministry  of 
Public Works and Housing (MPWH)—in charge of irrigation infrastructure—estimates that only 
55% of the nation’s irrigation system is functioning at full capacity, limiting yields and reducing 
cropping intensity.8 Irrigated agriculture is also sensitive to climate change. 
4. 
Since  2006,  the  Directorate  General  of  Water  Resources  (DGWR),  MPWH,  has 
introduced  reforms  to  improve  water  delivery  and  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  services 
1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. 
2  The IIP is a subprogram of the Sector Plan for Water Resources from the Ministry of Public Works and Housing. It 
is  aligned  with  the  2015–2025  strategy  for  irrigation.  Government  of  Indonesia,  MPWH.  2011.  Kebijakan  Irigasi

Management of Irrigation Project for Western and Eastern Indonesia Phase 1 (TA 8460-INO).  
4  IFAD  financing  of  €94.56  million  was  approved  in  December  2015  and  will  be  recorded  as  collaborative 
cofinancing.

and farmer’s involvement by applying participatory irrigation management.9 In 2010, the DGWR 
established a directorate dedicated to O&M for water resources. Asset management and needs-
based budgeting (NBB) processes have been introduced to address the long-term sustainability 
of  the  infrastructure.  In  2015,  the  DGWR  institutionalized  reforms  introduced  under  the  ADB-
financed Participatory Irrigation Sector Project to improve sector performance.10 This provides a 
robust regulatory framework for irrigation infrastructure, management, and O&M. 
5. 
Since 2015, the implementation of the IIP has progressed with 834,000 hectares (ha) of 
irrigation  systems  rehabilitated,  460,000  ha  of  irrigation  infrastructure  inventoried  and  161 
irrigation  commissions  established  nationwide.  However,  there  are  remaining  gaps  that 
constrain  effective  implementation  of  the  IIP.  Institutions  and  processes  need  strengthening, 
especially  at  the  subnational  level,  to  ensure  sufficient  budget  allocation  for  routine  O&M.  To 
this end, a sound irrigation asset management registry and better planning at the scheme level 
are required, as a basis for NBB and performance benchmarking. Water delivery services also 
need improvements to provide the intended level of service and to cope with climate variability. 
Irrigation schemes need to be rehabilitated or upgraded to improve water efficiency and climate 
resilience.  Improving  irrigation  services  is  necessary  to  increase  rice  yields  and  cropping 
intensity, provide farmers with an incentive to diversify from low- to high-value crops, increase 
rural incomes, and enhance food security. Better integration between irrigation and agriculture is 
needed to adapt to climate risks. 
B. 
Program Rationale 
6. 
The  program  is  aligned  with  the  government’s  long-term  National  Development  Plan, 
2005–202511 and  National  Medium-Term  Development  Plan,  2015–2019,12 in  which  water  and 
food security are priorities. To meet these national goals, the IIP calls for participatory irrigation 
management,  better  asset  management  systems,  NBB,  strengthening  of  water  users 
associations (WUAs) and water resources agencies (WRAs), and the rehabilitation of 3.2 million 
ha  of  irrigation  systems.  The  program  is  also  aligned  with  the  priorities  of  ADB’s  country 
partnership  strategy,  2016–2019  for  Indonesia.13 The  program  is  included  in  ADB’s  country 
operations business plan, 2017–2019 for Indonesia. It is aligned with ADB’s Water Operational 
Plan, 2011–2020 and Operational Plan for Agriculture and Natural Resources, 2015–2020.14 
7. 
This operation will be delivered using the results-based lending (RBL) modality because 
of  (i)  the  strong  government  ownership  of  and  commitment  for  the  IIP;  (ii)  the  nature  of  the 
program,  which  requires  a  results  and  system  approach;  (iii)  the  opportunity  to  leverage  ADB 
financing  by  influencing  key  results  under  a  large  program;  and  (iv)  the  potential  for 
harmonization  among  development  partners  through  a  mutual  focus  on  results.  RBL  is  also  a 
suitable modality because it can (i) provide the most effective support by leveraging institutional 
9   Participatory  irrigation  management  is  a  process  that  involves  farmers  and  beneficiaries  in  the  planning,  design, 
construction, and operation and maintenance of irrigation systems.

changes  within  the  overall  government-led  program  rather  than  specific  areas  as  with  other 
modalities;15 (ii) enhance operational efficiency by shifting the focus to results rather than inputs; 
(iii) strengthen country systems on the basis of the outcome of technical, fiduciary, and program 
safeguard-system  assessments;  (iv)  develop  institutional  capacity  through  the  effective  use  of 
disbursement  linked  indicators  (DLIs);  and  (v) enable  ADB  to  disburse  for  results  related  to 
institutional strengthening, and capacity development to improve O&M and management.  
8. 
The  program  incorporates  the  key  recommendations  on  sustainability  from  the 
Participatory  Irrigation  Sector  Project:  (i)  strengthening  institutional  frameworks  and  improving 
implementation  processes;  (ii)  facilitating  convergence  between  irrigation,  livelihood,  and 
agriculture  interventions;  (iii)  incorporating  irrigation  development  and  management  plans  into 
regional  plans;  and  (iv)  enhancing  the  roles  of  communities  and  women  in  governance  and 
service delivery. 16 The program will also introduce innovations: (i) upgrading the irrigation asset 
management  information  system  (IAMIS)  to  a  web-based  and  geospatial  interface  to  facilitate 
data management; (ii) introducing aerial surveys to reduce costs and improve the quality of the 
asset  registry;  (iii)  preparing  water  accounting  using  satellite  data  to  predict  water  availability 
and  adjust  engineering  design;  (iv)  pilot  testing  water  productivity  measurement  as  a  future 
vehicle  for  policy  making  and  improving  water  security;  and  (v)  improving  standards  for 
engineering design to integrate infrastructure, agriculture, and climate resilience. 
C. 
Program Scope 
9. 
The  RBL  program  will  strengthen  capacity  to  address  institutional  weaknesses, 
organizational  fragmentation,  and  weak  governance  to  improve  O&M  and  management  of 
irrigation  systems. It  will  also  improve  water  delivery  to farmers  by rehabilitating  infrastructure. 
This combination of measures will improve rural resilience and boost water resource productivity. 
IFAD’s  support  will  complement  RBL  program  by  addressing  underperforming  extension 
services,  poor  access  to  financial  services,  and  inefficiencies  in  the  value-chain  and  cropping 
patterns that contribute to low farm incomes. The program scope is summarized in Table 1.

Program Results   
10. 
The  RBL  program’s  impacts  will  be  improved  rural  incomes  and  livelihoods,  and 
enhanced  food  security.  The  outcome  will  be  sustainable  and  more  productive  irrigated 
agriculture in 74 districts, as evidenced by the enhanced performance of irrigation systems (DLI 
1).17 An additional indicator on increased crop yield will reflect the convergence with agricultural 
interventions  by  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  IFAD. 18  The  program  will  emphasize 
strengthening  of  institutions  and  systems,  including  better  tracking  of  irrigation  system 
performance.  Increased  farmer  participation  will  help  improve  water  delivery.  Improved  asset 
management,  NBB,  and  planning  will  improve  O&M  to  ensure  sustainability  of  the  irrigation 
infrastructure. The outcome will be achieved through three outputs. 
11. 
Output  1:  Systems  and  institutional  capacity  for  sustainable  irrigated  agriculture 
strengthened.  Output  1  will  support  institutional  measures  that  strengthen  the  planning, 
management,  and  delivery  of  irrigation  systems;  and  improve  the  linkage  between  irrigation 
service  delivery  and  agricultural  development  support.  It  will  support  the  upgrading  of 
(i) engineering  guidelines  for  irrigation  infrastructure  to  improve  water  efficiency  and  climate 
resilience, and (ii) planning guidelines to ensure that irrigation and agriculture development are 
integrated (DLI 2).19 DLI 3 measures the operationalization of irrigation commissions, which will 
improve  subnational  institutional  capacities  for  integrating  agriculture  and  infrastructure 
development and O&M. Capitalizing on these strengthened institutions, this output will support 
the process to incorporate irrigation development and management plans into regional plans as 
captured  by  DLI  4.20 A  capacity  development  framework  will  be  implemented  and  monitored 
(program  action  plan  [PAP])21 to  strengthen  the  capacity  of  river  basin  organizations  (RBOs), 
WRAs, and subnational planning agencies to address weaknesses in implementing government 
safeguards,  procurement,  financial  management,  gender  mainstreaming,  engineering,  and 
irrigation O&M and management processes.  
12. 
Output  2: Irrigation  operation,  maintenance, and  management improved. Output 2 
17 The government’s irrigation performance index measures improvements in infrastructure, water efficiency, cropping 
intensity, WUA participation, and other supporting factors required for sustainable and more productive agriculture.  
18 Cropping intensity is the number of times a crop is planted per year in a given agricultural area, while crop yield for 
rice refers to the weight of rice, at agreed standard moisture content, per unit of land area harvested for rice. Crop 
yield will depend more on Ministry of Agriculture interventions than on the program, so it has not been made a DLI. 
19 Improved guidelines will benefit the IIP nationwide with an investment estimated at $6.4 billion for infrastructure. 
20 The irrigation development and management plan is approved with appropriate budget allocations by the district or 
province parliament. It then becomes part of the development policy and plan for that district and/or province.

5 
focuses on measures aimed at enhancing irrigation sustainability and resilience at the scheme 
level.  Having  a  better  understanding  of  the  condition  of  the  irrigation  network  is  critical  to  this 
effort. Toward that end, the program will upgrade and update the IAMIS to cover 2.5 million ha 
of  irrigated  area  using  aerial  surveys  of  assets  and  remote  sensing  technologies  (DLI  5). This 
will  enable  better  linkages  between  asset  management,  sector  budgeting,  and  planning.  The 
participation  of  beneficiaries  is  central  in  improving  asset  management  and  water  service 
delivery. Output 2 will enhance the role and participation of WUAs, including women and poor 
farmers,  in  the  planning,  design  and  construction,  and  operation  of  irrigation  infrastructure  to 
improve  maintenance  and  management  (DLI  6).  Output  2  will  also  promote  climate-resilient 
practices and provide training to farmers in water management.22 It will ensure the convergence 
of  irrigation,  livelihood,  and  agriculture  interventions  in  the  technical,  socioeconomic,  and 
institutional profiling of irrigation schemes as a basis for investments (DLI 7).  
13. 
Output  3:  Irrigation  infrastructure  improved. The  program  will  support  infrastructure 
rehabilitation  and/or  upgrading.  Rehabilitation  will  address  design  shortcomings,  restore 
effective water service delivery, and improve water efficiency and climate resilience (DLI 8). To 
ensure the technical soundness of investments, the program will confirm the reliability of water 
sources through water accounting. The combination of participatory approaches and technology 
will lead to irrigation systems with improved efficiency that better serve the farm community.

comprise critical institutional output and outcome indicators to improve institutional and systemic 
capacity and irrigation infrastructure. The disbursement allocation is in Table 2. 
15. 
Results  monitoring  and  the  measurement  of  outcome  and  output  indicators  (including 
DLIs)  will  rely  on  the  reporting  system  of  the  DGWR.  The  Financial  and  Development 
Supervisory Board (BPKP) will be the independent verification agency. The BPKP is an internal 
auditor  of  the  government  and  a  separate  agency  from  the  executing  and  implementing 
agencies. It has a decentralized organizational structure and is mandated to verify government 
financial  and  development  activities.  The  BPKP  has  significant  experience  working  with 
externally  funded  programs,  and  is  the  independent  verification  agent  for  the  World  Bank’s 
results-based  Local  Government  and  Decentralization  Project. 24  The  verification  process  is 
designed  to  strengthen government  capacity  in  supporting  the  implementation  of the  IIP.  ADB 
will conduct review missions to confirm the achievement of DLIs.

loan) to help finance the IIP.25 The A loan will have a 17.5-year term, including a grace period of 
8 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB’s London interbank offered 
rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility;  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%  per  year;  and  such  other 
terms  and conditions  set forth  in the  draft  loan  agreement.  Based  on the  straight-line  method, 
the average maturity is 13 years, and there is no maturity premium payable to ADB. The B loan 
will  have  a  17.5-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years;  an  annual  interest  rate 
determined  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending

straight-line method, the average maturity is 13 years, and there is no maturity premium payable 
to  ADB.  The  World  Bank,  through  its  Water  Resources  and  Irrigation  Sector  Management 
Program, will provide $28 million. The financing plan is summarized in Table 4.

Capacity Development and Program Action Plan 
18. 
The  program  will  strengthen  the  capacity  of  agencies  involved  in  the  IIP,  especially  at 
the  subnational  level.  A  capacity  development  framework  will  be  prepared,  implemented,  and 
monitored. The PAP includes key actions in specific technical areas, governance and fiduciary 
management, monitoring and evaluation (M&E), environment and social safeguards, and social 
inclusion  and  gender  mainstreaming.  The  PAP  will  also  strengthen  government  systems  and 
institutions  to  manage  performance  and  deliver  results,  notably  in  performance  measurement, 
planning, supervisory and monitoring mechanisms, and addressing gaps in relevant knowledge. 
The government will procure consulting services to support the implementation of the PAP. 
G. 
Implementation Arrangements 
19. 
The  executing  agency  will  be  the  DGWR,  MPWH.  National  RBOs  and  provincial  and 
district  WRAs—as  implementing  agencies—will  deliver  infrastructure  investment  and  irrigation 
services,  each  according  to  its  level  of  responsibility. 26  Under  the  overall  guidance  of  the 
Ministry of Home Affairs, provincial and district planning agencies—as implementing agencies— 
will  ensure  institutional  strengthening,  planning,  and  internalization  of  O&M  into  five-year  and 
annual plans.27 The program completion date is on 31 December 2022.28 
III. 
SUMMARY OF ASSESSMENTS 
A. 
Program Technical Assessments 
The  program’s  soundness  was  assessed  according  to  its  relevance,  justification,  and 
20. 
adequacy.29 The  program is  highly  relevant to  Indonesia’s  efforts to  improve  food  security  and 
foster rural income growth. The program is designed to improve irrigation service reliability and 
sustainability. Program interventions are well-justified, focusing on key results to implement the 
IIP. The program addresses inefficiencies in the delivery of irrigation services by strengthening 
WRAs  and  increasing  beneficiary  participation. To  maximize  the  benefits  brought  by  improved 
water  delivery,  the  program  will  align  irrigation  efforts  with  agriculture  development.  The 
25 The assessment of the government budgets (including projected provisions for the program) confirmed the ability 
of the government to meet financing requirements and, in time, to ensure no program implementation delays. 
26 Irrigation schemes of less than 1,000 ha are the responsibility of districts; irrigation schemes above 1,000 ha and 
below 3,000 ha are managed by provinces, while schemes above 3,000 ha are managed by national RBOs. 
27 The National Development Planning Agency will provide strategic and policy guidance.

program was screened for climate change risks and found to be at medium risk.30 The climate 
risk  and  vulnerability  assessment  also  identifies  adaptation  measures.  Economic  benefits 
include  (i)  improved  farm  income  resulting  from  improved  yield,  cropping  intensity,  and 
agricultural  development;  and  (ii)  O&M  cost  savings  owing  to  the  improved  IAMIS. 31 At  the 
program level, the economic internal rate of return is 14%. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the 
program  is  robust  against  downside  risks.  Since  2011,  the  O&M  expenditure  for  national 
irrigation schemes has consistently increased. For subnational irrigation schemes, the provision 
for  O&M  expenditure  has  been  less  predictable,  the  program  will  help  the  government  to 
allocate  the  required  funds  for  O&M.  The  IAMIS  will  bring  substantial  O&M  cost  savings  and 
budget  allocation  efficiency  for  the  government.  Consequently,  the  government  will  be  able  to 
deliver  more  extensive  irrigation  maintenance  services,  with  the  same  budget  provision  as  set 
out under the IIP. To ensure long-term sustainability of the program, the government has agreed 
to allocate adequate funds for O&M of the irrigation schemes rehabilitated under the program.  
21. 
The  program  is  categorized  some  gender  elements.  The  primary  beneficiaries  of  the 
program  will  be  local  farming  communities,  including  poor  women  farmers,  and  agricultural 
workers.  The  program  will  enhance  participation  and  decision-making  by  women  by                          
(i) accelerating the capacity development of stakeholders, (ii) increasing the share of women in 
strategic  positions,  (iii) ensuring  better  social  organization  of  WUAs,  and  (iv)  strengthening 
institutions for pro-poor monitoring and gender mainstreaming in the irrigation sector. 
B. 
Program Systems Assessments 
22.  Monitoring and evaluation system. The M&E system assessment found that the M&E 
the  Directorate  of  Operation  and  Maintenance,  DGWR—which  covers 
system  under 
infrastructure, O&M, WUA participation, institutional, and other aspects—is the most appropriate 
to  monitor  program  implementation.  However,  reports  from  some  districts  with  weaker 
capacities  are  delayed  or  incomplete.  The  program  provides  a  unique  opportunity  to  enhance 
and  strengthen  the  M&E  system  by  (i) upgrading  the  forms  to  ensure  that  all  indicators 
presented  in  the  result  frameworks  are  captured,  (ii)  improving  the  capacity  of  agencies  to 
comply with reporting requirements, (iii) preparing annual performance reports, and (iv) adopting 
the IAMIS as the M&E system in the long term. The DGWR will consolidate and submit periodic 
progress reports on the achievement of DLIs, PAP actions, and other performance indicators.  
23. 
Fiduciary  systems.  The  fiduciary  assessment  confirms  that  the  government  financial 
management,  procurement,  and  anticorruption  systems  are  adequate  with  some  mitigation 
measures.32 The financial management system assessment indicates a moderate fiduciary risk. 
While  some  financial  management  weaknesses  and  shortcomings  have  been  identified,  these 
can  be  effectively  addressed  through  the  proposed  mitigation  measures.  The  assessments 
found that (i) improvements were needed in planning and budgeting, (ii) further computerization 
was  required  for  accounting  and  financial  reporting,  and  (iii)  the  capacity  of  implementing 
agencies should be strengthened. The PAP includes the following risk mitigation measures: (i) 
provision  of  capacity  building  in  financial  management,  supported  by  consultants;  and  (ii) 
preparation of consolidated unaudited financial statements at the program level. 
24. 
The  program  will  entail  the  procurement  of  civil  works,  goods,  consulting  services,

surveys,  and  individual  facilitators.  Except  for  large  consulting  services  to  support  the 
implementation  of  the  program,  it  is  unlikely  that  packages  will  attract  international  bidders. 
Overall,  the  legislative  framework  for  goods,  works,  and  smaller  consulting  packages—where 
the national market can meet the demand—is largely adequate and incorporates internationally 
recognized  principles  of  public  procurement.  The  procurement  assessment  has  identified  the 
following  risks:  (i)  low  procurement  capacity  in  some  districts  and  provinces;  (ii)  procurement 
delays owing to insufficient planning and late release of government budgets; (iii) large numbers 
of bids being disqualified for not meeting technical, administrative and commercial terms, which 
leads  to  suboptimal  competition;  (iv)  inconsistent  procurement  monitoring  across  all  procuring 
entities;  and  (v)  barriers  for  the  participation  of  international  contractors  and  consultants.  The 
risks  will  be  mitigated  by  (i)  improving  procurement  reporting,  (ii) ensuring  that  procurement 
actions  are  completed  early  each  year,  (iii)  conducting  procurement  and  probity  audits 
throughout  the  program,  (iv)  procuring  the  large  consulting  services  needed  for  the  program 
under the ADB-funded Accelerating Infrastructure Delivery through Better Engineering Services 
Project,33 outside the RBL program, and (v) conducting a value-for-money audit. The Guidelines 
to  Prevent  or  Mitigate  Fraud,  Corruption,  and  Other  Prohibited  Activities  in  Results-Based 
Lending for Programs were explained to, and discussed with, the government.34

Safeguard  systems. The program is classified category B for environment, involuntary 
resettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples. 35  The  program  safeguard  system  (PSS)  will  apply. 
Potential  environment  impacts  include  those  from  rehabilitation  of  irrigation  infrastructure, 
changes in river morphology, and reduced water quality. Those impacts are reversible and site-
specific, and mitigation measures can be readily designed within the PSS. Rehabilitation works 
will occur on existing irrigation canals that already have right-of-way. The works will not require 
any  significant  relocation  of  households  or  acquisition  of  productive  assets.  They  might  only 
affect  crops  and  land  temporally  and  cause  temporary  loss  of  income.  Severe  impacts  on 
indigenous peoples are not envisaged. The PSS assessment revealed that the PSS is broadly 
aligned with ADB’s Safeguards Policy Statement (2009).36 The main gaps identified are (i) weak 
screening and reporting; (ii) limited awareness of government’s regulations on safeguards at the 
regional level because of rapid issuance of new regulations and guidance; and (iii) limited staff 
and budget for safeguards implementation. These gaps will be addressed through (i) upgrading 
of the screening procedures, and guidelines on environment assessment and management; (ii) 
improving  reporting  and  monitoring  processes  and  capacity;  (iii)  institutional  strengthening  of 
environment and social safeguards units in RBOs and WRAs; and (iv) improving compensation 
and  assistance to meet ADB’s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  principles.  Environment  and  social 
safeguard specialists and consultants will assist the government in implementing the PAP.

Financing Plan  
Total program financing from 2017 to 2021: $1,679.0 million 
Government of Indonesia: $1,051.0 million 
Asian Development Bank: $500.0 million loan (ordinary capital resources) 
ASEAN Infrastructure Fund: $100.0 million loan 
World Bank: $28.0 million loan 
Assumptions for Partner Financing 
Outputs necessary to reach the outcome, but not administered by the Asian Development Bank, include 
those largely financed by the Government of Indonesia and IFAD: 
1. Improved farm productivity and services, improved financial services and use of services, and improved 
market access and services (IFAD: €94.56 million in parallel financing) 
2. Rehabilitation of tertiary canals (government) 
3.  Rehabilitation  of  irrigation  systems;  formation  and  strengthening  of  WUAs  and  irrigation  commissions; 
and  preparation  of    Social,  Economic, Technical,  and  Institutional  Profile;  and  RP2I  (government  and  the 
World Bank) 
The  assumption  is  that  these  partners  have  sufficient  resources,  as  planned,  for  their  outputs  to  help 
achieve goals for irrigated agriculture and food security in Indonesia.

a   The irrigation performance index or Indek Kinerja Sistem Irigasi (IKSI) is calculated based on 6 criteria, with a possible total score of 100 as stipulated in the 
Ministry  of  Public  Works  and  Housing  (MPWH)  regulation  12/2015.  The  6  criteria  are  measured  and  weighted  for  every  irrigation  scheme  as  follows:                            
(i)  functioning  infrastructure  (45%);  (ii)  agriculture  productivity  (15%);  (iii)  supporting  facilities  for  operations  and  maintenance  (O&M)  (10%);  (iv)  adequacy  of 
human resources for O&M (15%); (v) adequacy of data and information (5%); and (vi) water user association participation (10%). Achievement of DLI 1 requires 
achieving  outputs  as  well  as  strengthening  the  IKSI  system  so  that  baselines  can  be  set.  DLI  1  will  cover  irrigation  schemes  of  more  than  400  ha  and  10 
irrigation schemes with an area of less than 200 ha included in the selected 74 districts.

Definition: The irrigation performance index or Indek Kinerja Sistem Irigasi 
(IKSI) is calculated based on 6 criteria, with a possible total score of 100 as 
stipulated in the MPWH regulation 12/2015 or its update. The 6 criteria are 
measured and weighted for every irrigation scheme as follows: (i) functioning 
infrastructure (45%); (ii) agriculture productivity (15%); (iii) supporting facilities for 
O&M (10%); (iv) adequacy of human resources for O&M (15%); (v) adequacy of 
data and information (5%); (vi) water user association participation (10%).  
DGWR has a system for measuring this index that involves collection of field 
data in a series of forms. 
Baseline: The IKSI is measured for irrigation schemes under national authority 
in the program area. In 2015, the average IKSI for national schemes in the 
program area was 60%. There is no baseline for subnational schemes. 
“Program area” means irrigation schemes of more than 400 ha and 10 irrigation 
schemes with an area of less than 200 ha included in the selected 74 districts 
across 16 provinces.  
The definition of targets each year is geared towards strengthening the IKSI 
monitoring to be able to (a) set baseline data for 2017, (b) ensure the channels 
for regular data collection and annual report are well established and produce 
annual reports by 2018, and (c) start tracking performance index improvement in 
2019, 2020, and 2021. This system will be combined with the IAMIS described in 
DLI 5, when complete.   
Conditions for disbursement are met if the target specified each year is 
achieved.  
Partial disbursement: The DLI is scalable and partial disbursement is allowed. 
If the target for each year is not met, then disbursement can be proportional to 
the increase made (e.g., if an improvement in IKSI for the program area is 
increased by only half the target set, then 50% of the planned disbursement for 
that year can be made).  
Disbursements are allowed for early or late achievement of the DLI. This means 
that the planned disbursement amount for a given year can be released when 
the set target is fully achieved even if the achievement is a year or more late, as 
long as the achievement is during the program’s duration. 
DOM reporting supported 
by DILL, RBOs, WRAs 
and MOHA  
Frequency for reporting 
will be annual or semi-
annual when necessary. 
However, monitoring 
may be as frequent as 
necessary. 
Each year, the focal unit

attestation that the DLI is 
met and attaches the 
relevant report.  
The IVA will verify the 
results each year in DOM 
where the database is 
housed. The IVA will 
verify the results by spot 
checks of the system at 
central level (where the 
data are housed), and at 
district, province and 
scheme level, where 
sampling and spot 
checks of the IKSI 
calculation and criteria 
will be undertaken.  
The IVA will refer to the 
verification guidelines

The IVA might require 
independent technical 
expertise, which could be

Definitions: 
“Updated” means that guidelines are acceptable for the technical agencies. 
DOM and DILL reporting 
supported by MOHA 
“Officially issued” means that the updated guidelines have been legalized by the 
technical agencies. 
“Disseminated” means that the updated guidelines have been distributed 
electronically and explained to national and subnational water resources 
agencies by the central government through 1 regional roadshow on year 2018. 
Frequency for reporting 
will be annual or semi-

The focal unit in DOM 
prepares an attestation 
that the DLI is met and

The IVA will refer to the 
verification guidelines 
prepared for the 
program. 
The purpose of this indicator is to ensure that program innovations and 
approaches become part of the institutional framework for irrigation systems 
O&M and management. 
Conditions for disbursement are met if the government issues the regulations 
or guidelines.  
Partial disbursement: The DLI is scalable and partial disbursement is  allowed. 
If the target for each year is not met, then disbursement can be  proportional to 
the increase made. The updated detailed engineering design guidelines weight 
for 50%, others are pro rata. 
Disbursements are allowed for early or late achievement of the DLI. This means 
that the planned disbursement amount for a given year can be released when 
the set target is fully achieved even if the achievement is a year or more late, as 
long as the achievement is during the program’s duration. 
Definition: Irrigation commissions can be at both district and province level.  
An irrigation commission is considered to be “operationalized” based on the 
updated performance indicators.  
Conditions for disbursement are met if the number of commissions each year 
meeting the definition above is equal to or more than the target number of 
“operationalized” commissions for that year.  
Partial disbursement: The DLI is scalable and partial disbursement is allowed. 
If the target for each year is not met, then disbursement can be proportional to 
the increase made (e.g., if the number of commissions meeting the definition and 
conditions set above is equivalent to half of the target number for that year, then 
50% of the planned disbursement for that year can be made).  
Disbursements are allowed for early or late achievement of the DLI. This means

Definitions:  
District Irrigation Development and Management Plans or Rencana 
Pengembangan dan Pengelolaan Irigasi (RP2I) are the aggregation of available 
irrigation scheme level IAMPs covering national, province, and district levels in 
line with requirements set in MPWH regulation 12/2015 and its update. RP2Is 
cover irrigated agriculture development on a 5-year horizon and are updated 
every year. 
DOM reporting supported 
by MOHA 
Frequency for reporting 
will be annual. However, 
monitoring may be as 
frequent as necessary. 
“Endorsed” means that the head of district government (Bupati) endorses the 
RP2I through a legal letter as a step for inclusion into the sector plan and budget 
of the district/province agencies. The budget should incorporate operations and 
maintenance needs. This process is called “internalization.” 
Conditions for disbursement are met if the number of RP2I that have been 
endorsed by the district head.  
Partial disbursement: The DLI is scalable and partial disbursement is allowed. 
If the target for each year is not met, then disbursement can be proportional to 
the increase made (e.g., if the number of aggregated IAMPs meeting the 
definition set above is equivalent to 50% of the target number for that year, then 
50% of the planned disbursement for that year can be made).  
Disbursements are allowed for early or late achievement of the DLI. This means 
that the planned disbursement amount for a given year can be released when 
the set target is fully achieved, even if the achievement is a year or more late, as 
long as the achievement is during the program’s duration. 
Each year, the focal unit

Definition and Description of Achievement  
“Updated data and maps for IAMIS” means that: (i) location of irrigation 
infrastructure (canal, headworks, diversion, turn out, drop, gate, aqueduct, drain) 
are digitalized and imported into the IAMIS: and (ii) dimensions and conditions of 
irrigation infrastructure have been validated through field check and are inputted 
in the IAMIS.  
The indicator relates first, to strengthening and upgrading the current IAMIS, and 
second, to the number of hectares of irrigation systems for which IAMIS data set 
has been thus updated.  
Conditions for disbursement are met if conditions specified in the DLI table 
each year are met. In the last four years, conditions for disbursement are met 
when digital geo-referenced information on irrigation infrastructure is inputted 
into the IAMIS and validated through field check that meets the definition above 
is equal to or more than the target number of hectares for that year.  
Partial disbursement: The DLI is scalable and partial disbursement is allowed. 
If the target for each year is not met, then disbursement can be proportional to 
the increase made (e.g., if the number of hectares meeting the definition and 
conditions set above is equivalent to 50% of the target number for that year, then 
50% of the planned disbursement for that year can be made).  
Disbursements are allowed for early or late achievement of the DLI. This means 
that the planned disbursement amount for a given year can be released when 
the set target is fully achieved even if the achievement is a year or more late, as 
long as the achievement is during the program’s duration. 
DLI 6: Effective 
management of tertiary 
irrigation systems 
through 
operationalizing at 
least 4,500 WUAs by 
2021 
Definitions:  
The DLI will be met when WUAs are considered operationalized as per 
performance evaluation in line with updated guidelines in line with the MPWH 
regulation 30/2015 and its update.  
“Program area” means irrigation schemes included in the selected 74 districts 
across 16 provinces. 
DOM reporting supported 
by RBOs, WRAs and 
MOHA  
Frequency for reporting 
will be annual. However, 
monitoring may be as 
frequent as necessary. 
Conditions for disbursement are met if the number of WUAs each year 
meeting the definition above is equal to or more than the target number of WUAs 
for that year.  
Partial disbursement: The DLI is scalable and partial disbursement is allowed. 
If the target for each year is not met, then disbursement can be proportional to

Each year, the focal unit 
in DOM prepares an

met and attaches the 
relevant report.

development 
conducted for at least 
719 priority schemes 
by 2021 
Definitions:  
The SETIP/PSETK will go beyond the usual assessments and be in line with the 
updated requirements to include environmental, livelihoods, agricultural, and 
institutional assessments.   
“Program area” means irrigation schemes included in the selected 74 districts 
across 16 provinces 
Conditions for disbursement are met if the number of SETIPs/PSETK as 
specified above for each year is equal to or more than the target number of 
assessments for that year.  
Partial disbursement: The DLI is scalable and partial disbursement is allowed. 
If the target for each year is not met, then disbursement can be proportional to 
the increase made (e.g., if the number of SETIPs/PSETK meeting the definition 
and conditions set above is equivalent to half the target number for that year, 
then 50% of the planned disbursement for that year can be made).  
Disbursements are allowed for early or late achievement of the DLI. This means 
that the planned disbursement amount for a given year can be released when

Definitions: 
The irrigation infrastructure in program areas that have been rehabilitated and 
upgraded as per MPWH technical standards includes all or parts of irrigation 
schemes, including headworks; primary, secondary and tertiary canals; 
associated structures (such as diversion, turn out, drop, gate, aqueduct, culvert, 
drains) and which function well, meaning that the irrigation infrastructure as a 
system delivers irrigation water to the target tertiary blocks.
