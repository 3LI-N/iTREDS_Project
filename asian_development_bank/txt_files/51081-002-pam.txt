Project Administration Manual Purpose and Process 
1.  The  project  administration  manual  (PAM)  describes  the  essential  administrative  and 
management requirements to implement the project on time, within budget, and in accordance 
with the policies and procedures of the government and Asian Development Bank (ADB). The 
PAM should include references to all available templates and instructions either through linkages 
to relevant URLs or directly incorporated in the PAM. 
2.  The  executing  and  implementing  agencies  are  wholly  responsible  for  the  implementation  of 
ADB-financed  projects, as  agreed jointly  between the  borrower  and ADB,  and in  accordance 
with  the  policies  and  procedures  of  the  government  and  ADB.  ADB  staff  is  responsible  for 
supporting implementation including compliance by {executing and implementing agencies} of 
their  obligations  and  responsibilities  for  project  implementation  in  accordance  with  ADB’s 
policies and procedures. 
3.  At loan negotiations, the borrower and ADB shall agree to the PAM and ensure consistency with 
the loan and grant agreements. Such agreement shall be reflected in the minutes  of the loan 
negotiations. In the event of any discrepancy or contradiction between the PAM and the  loan 
and grant agreements, the provisions of the loan and grant agreements shall prevail. 
4.  After ADB Board approval of the project's report and recommendations of the President (RRP), 
changes in implementation arrangements are subject to agreement and approval pursuant to 
relevant government and ADB administrative procedures (including the Project Administration 
Instructions) and upon such approval, they will be subsequently incorporated in the PAM.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
1. 
The project will strengthen the climate change and disaster resilience of the water sector 
through: modernized and well-maintained infrastructure, enhanced agricultural and on-farm water 
management,  and  improved  disaster  risk  management.  The  project  interventions  will  be  both 
structural  (including  civil  works  and  equipment)  and  non-structural  (including  capacity  building 
and  demonstration  activities).  The  interventions  will  be  focused  in  the  Ferghana  Valley  in  the 
southwest of the country and the Chui River Basin in the north of the country, which are vulnerable 
to flooding, landslides (including mudflows), and drought risks that are likely to be exacerbated 
by climate change. 
2. 
The  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  losses  in  the  agriculture  and  water 
resources  sectors  from  extreme  weather  events  reduced.1  The  project  will  have  the  following 
outcome: climate change and disaster resilience of infrastructure and water security improved.2  
3. 
Output 1: Irrigation infrastructure protected and modernized. The project will protect 
and  modernize  irrigation  systems  to  improve  the  productivity  and  disaster  resilience  of  about 
20,000  hectares  of  irrigated  land.  It  will  upgrade  and  construct  main  (primary  and  secondary) 
canals;  lower-level  (inter-farm  and  on-farm)  canals;  and  associated  infrastructure  such  as 
protective  mudflow  crossing  structures,  cross-regulators,  and  offtakes.3  Infrastructure  design 
specifications will incorporate disaster risk mitigation measures for future climate conditions. The 
project will mobilize a participatory planning and design process involving the DWR, WUAs, WUA 
subgroups,  and  other  key  stakeholders  to  ensure  equitable  and  sustainable  outcomes.  One 
representative subproject has been selected and developed during project preparation and two 
or  three  additional  subprojects  will  be  identified  for  investment  during  implementation.4 
Community-based  contracting  will  be  pilot  tested  for  lower-level  canal  modernization  in  the 
representative subproject and will be expanded to further subprojects if shown to be successful.  
Output 2: Irrigation system and agricultural land management enhanced. The project 
4. 
will strengthen management and O&M of target irrigation systems, including practical drought and 
climate risk management, to ensure the sustainability of the investment benefits. In conjunction 
with  output  1,  under  the  participatory  planning  process,  the  project  will  (i)  reorganize  and 
strengthen the institutional capacity of WUAs and WUA subgroups for more effective organization; 
and (ii) build the capacity of the DWR representatives, WUA and WUA subgroup representatives, 
and farmers on effective and resilient irrigation system management, water use, and agronomy. 
The project will develop  and implement joint DWR–WUA irrigation system management plans, 
including  water  delivery  scheduling  and  O&M  financing  and  planning.  WUA  on-farm  water 
management  and  agricultural  management  plans  with  gender  elements  will  be  developed, 
including  irrigation  scheduling,  cropping  patterns,  and  cultural  methods,  and  will  be  supported 
with  capacity  building  for  farmers  and  community  members  (including  women),  such  as 
comparative field trials and farmer field days.

support capacity building and upgrade equipment for national DRM in the water resources sector. 
Heavy  machinery  and  specialist  equipment  for  preventive  and  rehabilitation  works,  such  as 
excavators, bulldozers, and cranes, will be purchased and installed in the Northern and Southern 
Emergency Response Centers of the MOES. This will be accompanied by enhancement of the 
Centers’  asset  management  and  capacity  building  on  DRM,  including  project  planning,  to 
undertake  preventive  and  rehabilitation  works  more  efficiently  in  the  water  resources  sector. 
Hydrological posts for KyrgyzHydromet will be installed in about 20 sites in the project’s target 
areas and an information system for enhanced data collection, processing, and flood warning will 
be pilot tested for improved efficiency and accuracy.

FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT 
A. 
Financial Management Assessment 
financial 
16. 
The financial management assessment (FMA) was conducted in July and August 2018 in 
accordance with ADB’s Guidelines for the Financial Management and Analysis of Projects and 
the Financial Due Diligence: A Methodology Note.  The FMA considered the capacity of the DWR 
of  MOA  and  MOES,  including  funds-flow  arrangements,  staffing,  accounting  and  financial 
reporting  systems, 
internal  and  external  auditing 
arrangements.  It  is  concluded  that  the  overall  pre-mitigation  financial  management  risk  of 
executing  agencies  is  substantial.  The  Financial  Management  Internal  Control  and  Risk 
Management Assessment is found in Table 2 of the Financial Management Assessment linked 
document. The borrower and executing agencies have agreed to implement an action plan as 
key measures to address the deficiencies. The financial management action plan is provided in 
Table 18. Taking in to considerations the pre-mitigation risk and the financial management action 
plan  for  risk  mitigation,  it  is  concluded  that  the  capacity  and  suitability  of  DWR  and  MOES  is 
information  systems,  and 
adequate to utilize the advance fund and statement of expenditure procedures with the proposed 
ceilings  described  below,  accompanied  by  the  use  of  direct  payment  and  reimbursement 
procedures.

Disbursement 
1. 
Disbursement Arrangements for ADB Funds 
17. 
The  concessional  loan  and  ADF  grant  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with 
ADB’s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)8,  and  detailed 
arrangements agreed upon between the government and ADB. Online training for project staff on 
disbursement policies and procedures is available.9 Project staff are encouraged to avail of this 
training to help ensure efficient disbursement and fiduciary control. 
The  PIU  will  be  responsible  for  (i)  preparing  disbursement  projections,  (ii)  requesting 
18. 
budgetary  allocations  for  counterpart  funds  from  MOF,  (iii)  collecting  and  retaining  supporting 
documents, and (v) preparing and sending withdrawal applications to ADB. 
Advance fund procedure. The MOF will establish a separate advance account for each 
19. 
the ADB loan and grant funds at a commercial bank. The currency of the advance accounts is US 
dollar. The advance account is to be used exclusively for ADB’s share of eligible expenditures. 
The DWR and MOES are accountable and responsible for proper use of advances to the advance 
account. 
20. 
The total outstanding advance to the advance account should not exceed the estimate of

handbook)

28 
ADB’s  share  of  expenditures  to  be  paid  through  the  advance  account  for  the  forthcoming  6 
months. The PIU may request for initial and additional advances to the advance accounts based 
on  an  Estimate  of  Expenditure  Sheet10  setting  out  the  estimated  expenditures  to  be  financed 
through the accounts for the forthcoming 6 months. Supporting documents should be submitted 
to  ADB  or  retained  by  the  borrower  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook 
(2017, as amended from time to time) when liquidating or replenishing the advance account. 
Statement  of  expenditure  procedure.11  The  SOE  procedure  may  be  used  for 
21. 
reimbursement of eligible expenditures or liquidation of advances to the advance accounts. The 
ceiling of the SOE procedure is the equivalent of $100,000 per individual payment. Supporting 
documents and records for the expenditures claimed under the SOE should be maintained and 
made  readily  available  for  review  by  ADB's  disbursement  and  review  missions,  upon  ADB's 
request for submission of supporting documents on a sampling basis, and for independent audit. 
Reimbursement  and  liquidation  of  individual  payments  in  excess of the SOE  ceiling  should  be 
supported by full documentation when submitting the withdrawal application to ADB. 
Before the submission of the first withdrawal application (WA), MOF should submit to ADB 
22. 
sufficient evidence of the authority of the person(s) who will sign the withdrawal applications on 
behalf of the government, together with the authenticated specimen signatures of each authorized 
person. The minimum value per WA is stipulated in the Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as 
amended from time to time). Individual payments below such amount should be paid (i) by the 
executing agencies and subsequently claimed to ADB through reimbursement, or (ii) through the 
advance  fund  procedure,  unless  otherwise  accepted  by  ADB.  The  borrower  should  ensure 
sufficient category and contract balances before requesting disbursements.  The use of ADB’s 
Client  Portal  for  Disbursements  (CPD)12  system  is  encouraged  for  submission  of  withdrawal 
applications to ADB.  
23. 
Direct  Payment.  Generally,  for  payments  exceeding  $100,000  (e.g.  large  payments, 
consultant’s fees, procurement of goods). ADB may make payments, at the project implementing 
unit’s  request,  directly  to  a  third  party  (e.g.,  supplier,  contractor,  and  consultant)  for  eligible 
expenditures. 
2. 
Disbursement Arrangements for Counterpart Fund 
24. 
The government will provide counterparts funds for the project to finance taxes and duties 
on civil works, goods, and services and income tax on international consultants under the project, 
estimated at $5.0 million equivalent. MOF will open a separate bank account for use only for the 
government’s counterpart funding of eligible expenditures under the project. The currency of the 
counterpart fund bank account is KGS. 
The  PIU  will  be  responsible  for  (i)  projecting  duties  and  taxes  to  be  financed  by  the 
25. 
governments  in  the  forthcoming  12  months,  and  (ii)  requesting  on  a  monthly  basis  budgetary 
allocation for the government counterpart funds. The DWR and MOES will be accountable and 
responsible for proper use of counterpart funds.  
10    Estimate  of  Expenditure  sheet  is  available  in  Appendix  8A  of  ADB’s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2017,  as  
amended from time to time),  
11  SOE forms are available in Appendix 7B and 7D of ADB’s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from  
time to time). 
12  The CPD facilitates online submission of WA to ADB, resulting in faster disbursement. The forms to be completed 
by the Borrower are available online at https://www.adb.org/documents/client-portal-disbursements-guide.     
29 
C. 
Accounting 
26. 
The DWR and MOES through the PIU will maintain, or cause to be maintained, separate 
books  and  records  by  funding  source  for  all  expenditures  incurred  on  the  project  following 
International  Public-Sector  Accounting  Standard  for  cash-based  accounting.  The  DWR  and 
MOES through the PIU will prepare consolidated project financial statements in accordance with 
the  government's  accounting  laws  and  regulations  which  are  consistent  with  international 
accounting  principles  and  practices.  The  PIU  will  purchase  and  install  commercial  accounting 
software for use under the project. 
D. 
 Auditing and Public Disclosure 
External Audit. The DWR and MOES through the PIU will cause the detailed consolidated 
27. 
project financial statements to be audited in accordance with International Standards on Auditing 
by an independent auditor acceptable to ADB. The DWR and MOES through the PIU will submit 
the audited project financial statements together with the auditor’s opinion will be presented in the 
English language to ADB within 6 months from the end of the fiscal year.  
28. 
The audit report for the project financial statements will include a management letter and 
auditor’s opinions, which cover (i) whether the project financial statements present an accurate 
and fair view or are presented fairly, in all material respects, in accordance with the applicable 
financial reporting standards; (ii) whether the proceeds of the loan and grant were used only for 
the  purpose(s)  of  the  project;  and  (iii)  whether  the  borrower  or  executing  agency  was  in 
compliance with the financial covenants contained in the legal agreements (where applicable). 
29. 
Compliance with financial reporting and auditing requirements will be monitored by review 
missions and during normal program supervision, and followed up regularly with all concerned, 
including the external auditor. 
30. 
The government and the executing agencies have been made aware of ADB’s approach 
to delayed submission, and the requirements for satisfactory and acceptable quality of the audited 
project  financial  statements.13  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  require  a  change  in  the  auditor  (in  a 
manner consistent with the constitution of the borrower), or for additional support to be provided 
to the auditor, if the audits required are not conducted in a manner satisfactory to ADB, or if the 
audits are substantially delayed. ADB reserves the right to verify the project's financial accounts 
to  confirm  that  the  share  of  ADB’s  financing  is  used  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  policies  and 
procedures.  
13 ADB’s approach and procedures regarding delayed submission of audited project financial statements:  
(i) When audited project financial statements are not received by the due date, ADB will write to the executing agency 
advising that (a) the audit documents are overdue; and (b) if they are not received within the next 6 months, requests 
for  new  contract  awards  and disbursement  such  as  new  replenishment  of  advance  accounts,  processing  of  new 
reimbursement, and issuance of new commitment letters will not be processed; (ii) When audited project financial 
statements are not received within 6 months after the due date, ADB will withhold processing of requests for new 
contract  awards  and  disbursement  such  as  new  replenishment  of  advance  accounts,  processing  of  new 
reimbursement, and issuance of new commitment letters. ADB will (a) inform the executing agency of ADB’s actions; 
and (b) advise that the loan may be suspended if the audit documents are not received within the next 6 months; and 
(iii)  When  audited  project  financial  statements  are  not  received  within  12  months  after  the  due  date,  ADB  may 
suspend the loan and grant. 
30 
Public disclosure of the audited project financial statements, including the auditor’s opinion 
31. 
on the project financial statements, will be guided by ADB’s Public Communications Policy 2011.14 
After the review, ADB will disclose the audited project financial statements and the opinion of the 
auditors on the project financial statements no later than 14 days of ADB’s confirmation of their 
acceptability  by  posting  them  on  ADB’s  website.  The  management  letter,  additional  auditor’s 
opinions, and audited entity financial statements will not be disclosed.15 
32. 
PIU Management Audit. For the first two fiscal years of project implementation, the DWR 
and MOES through the PIU will cause an annual PIU management audit report to be presented 
in the English language to ADB within 6 months from the end of the fiscal years. The report will 
be prepared by an independent auditor acceptable to ADB, and cover (but not be limited to) the 
PIU procurement processes, payment processes and systems (including bank reconciliation), and 
fixed asset management. The auditor producing the PIU management audit must not be the same 
as  that  auditing  the  project  financial  statements.  ADB,  at  its  own  discretion,  may  extend  the 
requirement  for  the  PIU  management  audit  report  beyond  the  first  two  years  of  project 
implementation. Within 30 days of effectiveness, the Borrower, through DWR and MOES, shall 
engage  an  independent  auditor,  whose  qualifications,  experience  and  terms  of  reference  are 
acceptable to ADB, to conduct the annual management audits on the PIU and its operations

A. 
Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing 
33. 
All  advance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  will  be  undertaken  in  conformity  with 
ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time). The issuance of invitations to bid 
under  advance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  will  be  subject  to  ADB  approval.  The 
borrower and executing agencies have been advised that approval of advance contracting and 
retroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance the project. 
34. 
Advance  contracting.  No  advance  contracting  is  currently  anticipated,  but  subject  to 
sufficient  progress  of  advance  action,  advanced  contracting  may  be  used  for  PIU  staff  and 
consultant recruitment.

Consultant's Terms of Reference 
Draft  terms  of  reference  for  the  project  implementation  consultant  are  provided  in 
37. 
Appendix 4. 
VII. 
SAFEGUARDS 
38. 
Environment.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  B  for  environment.  An  initial 
environmental examination (IEE), including an environmental management plan (EMP), has been 
prepared  for  the  core  subproject.  Public  consultations  were  conducted  and  involved  affected 
people  from  nearby  houses  and  other  project  stakeholders.  Remaining  sub-projects  will  be 
selected  after  project’s  Board  approval  and  an  Environmental  Assessment  and  Review 
Framework  (EARF)  has  been  prepared.  Subproject  selection  criteria  will  rule  out  projects  with 
significant environmental impacts (Category A), and an IEE will be performed for each subsequent 
subproject and any civil works. 
39. 
Project impacts during construction are expected to be site-specific and temporary and 
related to the construction of the core sub-project components. Expected impacts include noise, 
dust  and  exhaust  emissions  from  equipment  and  construction  vehicles;  impacts  on  the  river/ 
surface water, waste management, occupational health and safety, site accessibility, community 
health and safety, construction traffic. During operation phase, potential impacts  are related to 
limited local capacity to maintain functionality of the components, with expected positive impacts 
due  to  the  rehabilitation  works.  Adequate  mitigation  measures  are  included  as  part  of  the 
assessment,  and  will  be  implemented  through,  the  EMP  and  Site-specific  Environmental 
Management Plans (SEMP).  
36 
40. 
The PIU will be responsible for environmental management plan (EMP) implementation 
will  ensure  that  EMP  will  be  adequately  included  in  bidding  documents  and  all  environmental 
mitigation measures will be included in construction contracts. PIU will be responsible to ensure 
the Contractor prepares SEMPs and PIU will approve all SEMPs before start of any construction 
works.   
41.  Monitoring of environmental quality and the implementation of mitigation measures will be 
performed  by  the  PIU,  with  support  from  project  implementation  consultant  as  required  with 
sufficient TORs and staff-time for this task. The monitoring results will be included in the project 
quarterly progress reports and semi-annual environmental reports to be submitted to ADB. 
The  cost  for  implementing  EMP  will  be  financed  by  the  grant  and  loan,  specifically  the 
42. 
costs  of  mitigation  measures  will  be  included  in  the  construction  contracts,  and  the  cost  for 
supporting  environmental  monitoring  will  be  included  in  the  consulting  service  of  the  project 
implementation consultant. Mitigation measures and a monitoring plan have been developed and 
incorporated into the EMP, which form the basis for the future SEMP. The contractor will have to 
submit  Site-specific  Environmental  Management Plans  (SEMP),  which  will  contain the method 
statement  for  construction,  and  the  site-specific  plans  prepared  with  IEE  prior  to  commencing 
operations.  The  SEMPs  shall  be  endorsed  by  the  project  implementation  consultant  before 
submission to the PIU for approval. 
43. 
PIU  will  promptly  inform  ADB  of  the  occurrence  of  any  risks  or  impacts,  with  detailed 
description of the event and proposed corrective action plan if any unanticipated environmental 
and/or  social  risks  and  impacts  arise  during  construction,  implementation  or  operation  of  the 
Project that were not considered in the initial environmental examination. PIU will report any actual 
or potential breach of compliance with the measures and requirements set forth in the IEE and 
EMP promptly after becoming aware of the breach. 
44. 
The  project  implementation  consultant  will  assist  PIU  in  compiling  and  submitting 
semiannual monitoring reports during project construction within one month after each reporting 
period. Environmental monitoring reports will be disclosed at ADB website and to local authorities. 
45. 
Social Safeguards. The project is classified as category B for involuntary resettlement 
impacts. The  Land  Acquisition  and Resettlement  Plan  (LARP)  has  been prepared for  the  core 
subproject  to  ensure  that  resettlement  activities  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  Kyrgyz 
applicable laws and regulations and ADB SPS (2009). 
46. 
Since  this  project  will  employ  sector  loan  modality,  Land  Acquisition  and  Resettlement 
Framework (LARF) has also been prepared to guide the EAs to conduct screening, assessment, 
institutional  arrangements,  and  processes  to  be  followed  for  subsequent  subprojects  to  be 
selected during project implementation. For all civil works sites, DWR and MOES through the PIU 
will ensure that all requirements prescribed in the LARF will be complied with during preparation 
of relevant safeguard documents and implementation. A screening checklist in LARF will be used 
by  DWR  and  MOES  to  select  only  category  B  (avoiding  land  acquisition  and  minimizing 
resettlement 
impact)  or  category  C  subprojects  and  civil  works  sites  during  project 
implementation. The executing agencies through PIU and the project implementation consultants 
will  ensure  that  meaningful  consultations  are  carried  out  with  the  project  affected  persons 
throughout the project cycle with attention to the needs of the vulnerable and the disadvantaged 
groups. 
37 
Surveys  carried  out  during  the  project  preparation  for  the  representative  subproject 
47. 
identified approximately 2 affected households with a total of 12 household members17. According 
to the local government and department of water resources (DWR), the affected land plots are 
public lands designated as water conservation zone, for which the 2 affected households have 
been permitted to use without any cost or financial obligation for small scale farming. Therefore, 
compensation  only  for  affected  assets  on  the  land  have  been  calculated  during  draft  LARP 
preparation and included to the project budget. No households will experience severe impacts 
from the core subproject nor belong to vulnerable groups. Draft LARP for core subproject will be 
updated upon completion of the detailed design. The civil works could only be commenced after 
full compensation payment to the affected households.  
48. 
For implementing the LARPs, the PIU will ensure that:  
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
(v) 
The safeguards specialist recruited as part of the PIU and project implementation 
consultant  team  will  conduct  LARP  implementation  and  monitoring,  including 
facilitation of resolution of affected households’ concerns and grievances; 
Continuous meaningful consultations with affected households, and no change is 
made on the entitlement matrix of the draft LARP and LARF that provides a clear 
guidance on entitlements for compensation; 
The final LARP is submitted to ADB for concurrence prior to implementation, as 
early as detailed design is available; 
The final LARP is disclosed through the Project’s and ADB’s website; and 
Reports  on  monitoring  of  the  LARP  implementation  including  grievances  is 
submitted to ADB on a semi-annual basis. 
49. 
In case of any changes, additional land acquisition and involuntary resettlement, or related 
unanticipated impacts will be identified, then addendum LARP will be prepared and implemented 
in accordance with approved LARF.  
50. 
Compensation  for  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  will  be  covered  under  the  ADB 
financing.  Initial  budget  of  $10,000  has  been  set  for  all  subprojects  across  DWR  and  MOES 
activities, as site selection will avoid land acquisition and minimize resettlement impacts. These 
funds  may  be  used  to  (i)  provide  payments  to  affected  persons  in  line  with  the  associated 
approved  updated  LARP  and  (ii)  cover  incremental  expenses  directly  associated  with 
implementation of the LARP and grievance redress mechanism (including by affected persons) 
excluding those covered under the TOR of the project implementation consultant. Payments will 
be  disbursed  from  the  advance  account  and  liquidated  through  the  SOE  procedure  with 
submission  of  (i)  signed  contract  between  PIU  and  affected  persons  based  on  results  of  the 
valuation  survey;  (ii)  confirmation  from  bank  that  payment  is  transferred  to  affected  persons’ 
account; and (iii) written acknowledgment from affected persons of receipt of payment. 
51. 
The  PIU  will  establish  a  grievance  redress  mechanism  (GRM)  in  accordance  with  the 
EARF, IEE/EMP, LARF and LARP to receive and facilitate the resolution of the affected persons’ 
concerns and grievances. 
52. 
Indigenous  Peoples.  The  country  does  not  have  indigenous  people’s  communities  as 
defined in the SPS for operational purposes. As such, the project is classified as C for indigenous 
peoples. 
17 Their fences, crops and trees will be affected. No land will be acquired.  
38 
Prohibited  Investment  Activities.  Pursuant  to  ADB’s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement 
53. 
(2009),  ADB  funds  may  not  be  applied  to  the  activities  described  on  the  ADB  Prohibited 
Investment Activities List set forth at Appendix 5 of the Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). 
VIII.   GENDER AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS 
54. 
The project is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming (EGM), as it addresses the 
gender issues relevant to the project, such as (i) women’s participation in WUAs and WUA sub-
groups, (ii) gender-sensitive plans for improved irrigation and agricultural management; and (iii) 
participation of women in training. The gender action plan (GAP) provides targets for: (i) increased 
female  leadership  positions  in WUAs  and WUGs;  and  (ii)  women’s  involvement  in  all  capacity 
building  activities.  To  ensure  gender-inclusiveness  of  disaster-risk  management  and  irrigation 
systems, as well as all project activities, the GAP requires that: (i) all public awareness campaigns 
and materials on the project benefits are gender-sensitive; (ii) infrastructure planning is gender-
responsive and social-inclusive and that contracts ensure women-friendly working conditions for 
female workers, as well as ensuring that all work camps have explicit policies on zero tolerance 
for use of illegal drugs, sexual harassment, and use of prostituted women; and (iii) gender capacity 
building be conducted for staff of executing agencies. To implement and monitor the benefits to 
women,  the  GAP  includes  targets  for  female  beneficiaries.  This  entails  the  collection  of  sex-
disaggregated  data,  which  is  included  as  a  key  element  in  project  monitoring  and  information 
system. 
55. 
The executing agencies through the PIU will ensure that the projects gender targets are 
met during implementation, with resources allocated in the project implementation consultant for 
gender activity monitoring. The PIU Director is responsible for achievement of GAP targets and 
is supported by safeguards specialist in the PIU and gender and social development specialist in 
project implementation consultant.

Monitoring  
56. 
Project performance monitoring. The executing agencies will ensure PIU, with support 
of  the  project  implementation  consultant,  undertake  monitoring  project  performance  using  the 
targets,  indicators,  milestones/activities,  assumptions,  and  risks  in  the  DMF  and  GAP,  and 
establish  an  adequate  project  performance  monitoring  system  within  3  months  of  project 
effectiveness.  The  project  performance  monitoring  system  will  assess  the  following  outputs  and 
indicators (i) progress of planned activities according to the milestones; (ii) progress in achieving each 
project output and project outcome according to the performance targets and indicators indicated in 
the  DMF  and  GAP,  and  (iii)  social  and  economic  benefits  with  focus  on  the  poor  and  women. 
Disaggregated  baseline  data  for  output  and  outcome  indicators  gathered  during  project 
processing  will  be  updated  and  reported  quarterly  through  the  executing  agency's  quarterly 
progress  reports  and  after  each  ADB  review  mission.  These  quarterly  reports  will  provide 
44 
information  necessary  to  update  ADB's  project  performance  reporting  system.18  The  project 
performance monitoring will involve a participatory approach, including inputs form WUAs and local 
DWR offices facilitated by the project implementation consultant and community development teams 
to ensure timely collection of quality data. 
57. 
Compliance monitoring. All project assurances including policy, legal, financial, economic, 
physical, environmental, gender, and other safeguard measures will be monitored through quarterly 
progress  reports,  and  twice  a  year,  during  ADB  loan  review  missions.  ADB  will  also  monitor  the 
progress of achievement of each output and outcome based on performance indicators with targets, 
and  each  activity  based  on  milestones  indicated  in  the  DMF  through  a  project  management 
information system (i.e., e-Ops).   
Safeguards  monitoring. The monitoring  and reporting  of the  activities identified  in  the 
58. 
environment and resettlement action plans is discussed in Section VII. 
59. 
Gender  and  social  dimensions  monitoring.  The  PIU,  with  support  of  the  project 
implementation consultant, will be responsible for monitoring the implementation of the GAP and for 
the preparation of the monitoring reports that will be submitted to ADB.19 
E. 
Evaluation 
60. 
Inception Mission. ADB will conduct an inception mission within 3 months of loan and grant 
signing to assess project readiness and implementation arrangements including establishment of PIU, 
opening  of  advance  accounts,  progress  of  recruitment  of  consulting  services,  status  of  the 
development of the project performance monitoring system, and progress of advance procurement 
actions.  Review  Missions.  ADB  will  field  review  missions  at  least  twice  a  year  to  (i)  assess  the 
progress  of  project  activities  and  outputs  and  effectiveness  of  implementation  arrangements,  (ii) 
monitor the implementation of GAP and safeguard compliance with ADB Safeguard Policy Statement 
(2009), (iii) review compliance with loan and grant agreements and related matters, (iv) follow up on 
decisions  and  actions  agreed  during  previous  review  missions,  and  (v)  resolve  any  project 
implementation issues that may arise. ADB will conduct a midterm review in the third year of project 
implementation. The midterm review will (i) assess the project performance and achievement against 
targets and milestones in the DMF; (ii) review the initial outcomes, benefits, and impact of the project, 
and  (iii)  identify  gaps,  if  any,  and  recommend  necessary  changes  to  strengthen  implementation 
arrangements or modify project design. Project Completion Review. Within 6 months of physical 
completion of the project, the executing agencies will submit a project completion report to ADB.20 
ADB  will  field  a  project  completion  review  mission  upon  physical  completion  of  the  project  to 
commence  preparation  of  ADB’s  project  completion  report.  The mission  will  (i)  assess  the  project 
performance against all targets, indicators, and benchmarks (including any revised at the midterm 
review); (ii) evaluate initial benefits, and outcome of the project across outputs, and (iii) identify any 
incomplete activities and agree on the necessary actions.

F. 
Reporting  
61. 
The executing agencies will ensure that the PIU provides ADB with (i) quarterly progress 
reports in a format consistent with ADB's project performance reporting system; (ii) consolidated 
annual  reports  including  (a)  progress  achieved  by  output  as  measured  through  the  indicator's 
performance targets, (b) key implementation issues and solutions, (c) updated procurement plan, 
and  (d)  updated  implementation  plan  for  the  next  12  months;  (iii)  bi-annual  reporting  of 
environmental and social safeguards due within 30 days of end of each half-year period; and (iv) 
a project completion report within 6 months of physical completion of the project. To ensure that 
projects  will  continue  to  be  both  viable  and  sustainable,  project  accounts  and  the  executing 
agency  audited  financial  statement  together  with  the  associated  auditor's  report,  should  be 
adequately reviewed. 
62. 
The  PIU  will  establish  a project  website with  suitable domain and email address  within 
three months of project effectiveness. The PIU will ensure that the website, presented in English 
and Russian (and optionally Kyrgyz language), is periodically updated with (i) general information 
on the project objectives including links to project documents; (ii)  summary updates on project 
progress including summary quarterly reports; (iii) procurement plans and advertisements; and 
(iv) other relevant project information. 
G. 
Stakeholder Communication Strategy  
63. 
Project  information  will  be  strategically  disseminated  through  media  at  main  milestones 
including loan signing, contract awards and project completion. A grievance redress mechanism will 
be established at the PIU, by phone and email, and through public consultation events.

ANTICORRUPTION POLICY 
64. 
ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any violations of the 
Anticorruption  Policy  relating  to  the  project.21  All  contracts  financed  by  ADB  shall  include 
provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the 
executing agency and all project contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers. 
Individuals and/or entities on ADB’s anticorruption debarment list are ineligible to participate in 
ADB-financed  activity  and  may  not  be  awarded  any  contracts  under  the  project.22  To  support 
these efforts, relevant provisions are included in the loan and grant agreements and the bidding 
documents for the project. 
XI. 
ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISM 
65. 
People  who  are,  or may  in the future  be,  adversely  affected  by the  project  may  submit 
complaints  to  ADB’s  Accountability  Mechanism.  The  Accountability  Mechanism  provides  an 
independent forum and process whereby people adversely affected by ADB-assisted projects can 
voice,  and  seek  a  resolution  of  their  problems,  as  well  as  report  alleged  violations  of  ADB’s 
operational  policies  and  procedures.  Before  submitting  a  complaint  to  the  Accountability 
21 Anticorruption Policy: http://www.adb.org/Documents/Policies/Anticorruption-Integrity/Policies-Strategies.pdf 
22  ADB's Integrity Office web site: http://www.adb.org/integrity/unit.asp 
Mechanism, affected people should make an effort in good faith to solve their problems by working 
with  the  concerned  ADB  operations  department.    Only  after  doing  that,  and  if  they  are  still 
dissatisfied, should they approach the Accountability Mechanism.23

APPENDIX 1: IMPLEMENTATION PROCEDURES AND RESPONSIBILITIES FOR 
OUTPUTS 1 AND 2 
1.  INTRODUCTION 
1. 
This document details the specific procedures and responsibilities for the implementation 
of outputs 1 and 2, which comprises an integrated and participatory process to system design, 
construction,  and  management.  As  described  in  the  project  administration  manual  (PAM),  the 
project will protect and modernize irrigation systems (output 1) and modernize irrigation system 
and agricultural land management (output 2). This approach will consult and plan jointly among 
irrigation system stakeholders for a bottom-up approach to modernization. 
2. 
i. 
ii. 
Under output 1 and 2, the project will:  
Invest in modernizing and protective works for main canal and associated infrastructure24 
that are under responsibility of Department of Water Resources (DWR) of the Ministry of 
Agriculture and Melioration through international or national competitive bidding;  
Invest in modernization of lower-level canals that are under the responsibility of water user 
associations (WUAs) and pilot community contracting for these works;  
iii.  Develop and implement irrigation system and agricultural management plans; and  
iv. 
Provide extension and capacity building for farmers and other community representatives 
on on-farm water management and agricultural practices. 
3. 
The design and monitoring framework (DMF) in Section IX(A) of the PAM tabulates the 
output  performance  indicators  which will  guide their  design  and  implementation.  As  described, 
the project outcome, is climate change and disaster resilience of infrastructure and water security 
improved  as  measured  by  improvements  in  productivity  of  water  (PoW)  and  net  value  of 
agricultural production (NVP). 
2.  PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS 
4. 
The DWR is the project executing agency responsible for outputs 1 and 2, while MOES is 
the implementation agency responsible for output 3. A project implementation unit (PIU) will be 
established to implement the project on behalf of both DWR and MOES. A project implementation 
consultant (PIC) will be recruited to support the PIU to implement all outputs. Numerous small 
community  development  teams  (CDT)  will  be  recruited  under  the  PIC  to  facilitate  community 
contracting and capacity building activities to ensure sufficient coverage of the large number of 
farmers in each target system. 
5. 
As described in Section III of the PAM, the PIU staff have responsible for delivery of project 
outcomes  1  and  2  including:  (i)  selection  of  additional  subprojects  in  line  with  agreed  criteria; 
oversight  the  PIC  and  support  and  coordination  of  WUAs  and  rayon  DWR  offices  and  other 
stakeholders; and (iii) oversight and accountability for all civil works, goods delivery, and capacity 
building activities. 
For outputs 1 and 2, the PIC will provide key expertise and manpower for implementation, 
6. 
including  but  not  limited  to:  (i)  provide  conventional  engineering  services  to  deliver  outputs 
including oversight of civil works and delivery of goods; (ii) lead development and implementation 
of  the  integrated  technical-participatory  process  to  modernize  irrigated  agriculture  systems  in 
24 Mudflow crossing structures, cross-regulators, offtakes. 
49 
target subprojects; (iii) recruit, train, deploy, and support CDTs; and (iv) help rayon DWR offices, 
WUAs, and CDTs to develop and implement their capacity development plans. 
7. 
CDTs are small three-person teams whose function is to provide on-the-ground support 
for  the  implementation  of  the  participatory  system  design,  construction,  and  management. 
Numerous teams are required because the PIU and PIC on their own will not have the resources 
to reach out the large number of farmers in the target areas for the period (over two to three years) 
required to ensure the outcome and benefits of the project. The CDTs will (i) organize and mobilize 
stakeholders  including  WUAs, WUA  sub-groups  (WUGs),  farmers,  and  others  for  participatory 
design, construction, and management activities; (ii) provide technical advice and training in line 
with the cascading capacity development structure (see Table 1 below); (iii) facilitate collective 
decision-making on planning, design, and management; (iv) provide support for development and 
implementation of community contracts including technical advice, supervision, and monitoring 
and  reporting;  and  (v)  help modern WUAs to develop  their  capacity for  irrigation management 
transfer  (IMT)  and  /  or  participatory  irrigation  management  (PIM).  One  CDT  is  expected  to  be 
required  per  1800  ha  target  area,  meeting  bi-weekly  to  monthly  for  three  years.  Total  CDT 
requirements for approximately 20,000 ha target area under the project are expected to total 900 
person-months over the project.

One  Subproject  Coordinating  Committee  (SCCs)  will:  (i)  coordinate  the  parties  and 
activities  at  subproject  and  system  levels,  and  (ii)  resolve  conflicts  and  disputes  between  the 
parties. The head of the DWR unit in the PIU will Chair the SSC; the PIC will act as Secretary; 
and each relevant Rayon DWR, Local Self Government (LSG or Aiyl Okmotu), and tertiary-level 
WUA(s) in the subproject target area will each delegate a representative as a Member of the SSC. 
DWR rayon offices will facilitate delivery of outputs 1 and 2, including responsibility for: (i) 
9. 
assisting  PIC  in  oversight  and  accountability  for  civil  works  delivery  and  (ii)  developing  and 
implementing joint DWR-WUA management plan. 
3.  IRRIGATED AGRICULTURE SUBPROJECTS 
10. 
Achievement of the project outcome indicators will, requires the phased development and 
implementation  of  an  efficient  and  effective  innovative  behavioral  change  process.  Table  2 
presents  several  of  the  underlying  problems  experienced  by  irrigated  agriculture  systems  in 
Kyrgyz Republic, and the proposed solutions that the project aims to deliver. 
50 
Table 2: Summary of irrigated agricultural system strategic problems and proposed 
solutions 
Strategic Problems 
Traditional risk-aversive farmers and water users  Mobilize  communities  to  catalyze  latent  demand 
Existing WUAs are too large to be effective 
Low-level  performance  equilibrium  of  existing 
governance and management organizations 
and form new lower level sub-WUA groups 
Reorganize and strengthen existing WUAs to form 
modern representative democratic WUAs 
Proposed Solutions 
Existing  main  canals  are  often  too  low,  are  not 
equipped with cross or head-regulators and there 
are not enough suitable lower-level canals; 
Therefore,  irrigation  systems  cannot  command  
their full permissible service area (PSA).a 
Modernize  and  revitalize  system  management. 
Modernize infrastructure to facilitate operation 
Systems designed to meet social equity objective; 
limited water is overallocated = scarcity by design 
Irrigation  systems  are  in  a  low-level  performance 
equilibrium  and  are  not  achieving 
their 
considerable agricultural PoW and NVP potential 
Source: Summary Sector Assessment Linked Document. 
a Command is the head (difference in elevation), between the canal water level and the farmers field, required to make 
water flow by gravity to irrigate or “command” the farmers field without pumping. The permissible service area (PSA) 
excludes villages and government infrastructure (canals, drains and roads etc). However, the PSA includes both: (i) 
similar WUA or farmer infrastructure as well as (ii) land that is too high to irrigate by gravity. Therefore, the size of the 
PSA is between the sizes of the gross and net service areas, where net service area is defined as the irrigable area.    
Optimize the win-win trade-off between the social 
equity and economic efficiency objectives. 
Organization and community behavioral change to 
modernize  system  management  and  achieve  the 
PoW and NVP outcome.      
11. 
The  project,  using the  sector  project modality,  will  undertake  a total  of  approximately  4 
investment sub-projects under outputs 1 and 2 to achieve the targets presented in the DMF. The 
subprojects  are  expected  to  be  implemented  sequentially  in a  phased  approach (see  Figure  6 
below). The subproject phases described below in Section 4, are expected to comprise: advanced 
action, mobilization, design and procurement, construction, and management. 
12. 
The  participatory  approach  to  system  design,  construction,  and  management  will  be 
undertaken  with  the  following  principles:  (i)  investments  must  be  requested  by  genuine 
representatives  of  the  stakeholders,  such  as  revitalized  WUAs  and  other  community  groups, 
interested in improving water resources management in the target areas; (ii) local beneficiaries 
(notably, farmers) must be involved in all stages of key decision-making processes; and (iii) the 
approach  will  address  two  inter-related  processes  related  to  technical/engineering  aspects  of 
irrigation system design and institutional/management of the system. 
13. 
The  representative  (core)  subproject  has  been  selected  as  Pravaya  Vetka  irrigation 
system  comprising  main  and  secondary  canal  works  and  lower-level  canal  works  for  the 
command  area  served  by  the  third  secondary  canal  (most  distant  from  headworks)  covering 
approximately  6000  ha.  A  feasibility  study  including  economic  analysis,  initial  environmental 
examination  (IEE),  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plan  (LARP),  and  design  specifications 
incorporating climate change considerations has been undertaken during project preparation, to 
serve  as  a  demonstration  and  template  for  further  subprojects  to  be  selected  under 
implementation.

Note: Timing and sequencing of subprojects is purely indicative and will be finalized during implementation. 
14. 
The core subproject will be the first subproject implemented. Subsequent subprojects will 
be selected during the by the PIU-A in consultation with the Department of Water Resources and 
incorporating  expert  advice  from  the  PIC-A  to  ensure  eligibility.  A  long  list  of  prospective 
subprojects has been prepared by DWR. To be eligible to be selected, the subproject is required 
to meet the following criteria (see Table 3). Proposed subprojects, along with assessment against 
eligibility criteria, will be submitted to ADB for prior approval. In selecting the site as a sub-project, 
due consideration will be given to the remaining budget for main and secondary canal works and 
the appropriateness of the expected target area for lower-level canal works (i.e. contiguous area, 
investment needs, and capacity and willingness of WUAs to participate). The budget for lower-
level canal works is expected to be divided roughly equally among subprojects (e.g. around $200 
per hectare or around $1 million each) but substantial changes in distribution may be allowed with 
ADB prior approval. Further sections of Pravaya Vetka irrigation system may also be selected as 
“additional” subprojects.

4.  PHASED IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH 
The  indicative  phases  of  subproject  implementation  are  described  below,  including 
15. 
expected  activities  and  deliverables  (with  respect  to  the  DMF).  It  is  expected  that  the  PIU,  in 
collaboration  with  the  PIC,  will  refine  the  approach  during  implementation  incorporating  the 
lessons learned from ongoing and earlier subprojects. The estimated time-frames are indicative 
and based on earlier experience in Kyrgyz Republic and other countries. 
4.1 
Advanced Action 
Advance  action  represents  the  preparatory  phase  of  subproject  implementation,  taking 
16. 
place  after  subproject  selection  and  prior  to  formal  commencement  of  the  participatory  design 
and  management  process.  It  may  be  efficient  to  undertake  advance  action  on  non-core 
subprojects  simultaneously,  after  which  time  the  mobilization  phase  may  be  appropriately 
staggered.  Advanced  action  is  led  by  the  PIU,  with  expert  input  and  review  by  the  PIC.  It  is 
expected that study and design activities are subcontracted by the PIC. 
17. 
Detailed  planning  of  sub-project  phases.  The  PIC  with  oversight  from  PIU  will 
undertake detailed plan of the subproject phasing and activities, starting with the representative 
subproject. While some phases cannot start before the prior phase is completed (e.g. Design and 
Bidding  before  Construction  phases),  some  phases  may  overlap  (e.g.  Construction  and 
Management phases). Lessons learned from previous sub-projects should be incorporated, and 
the detailed plan should be updated periodically and reported in the quarterly reporting (see PAM 
Section IX). The PIC should review the Sector Assessment linked document for the project as a 
guidance document for planning. 
Public  information  campaign.  For  each  sub-project,  the  PIU  with  support  of  PIC  will 
18. 
make announcements in local media targeting the sub-project’s stakeholder organizations and 
target beneficiaries to advise of (i) the objectives and activities of the overall project and (ii) the 
planned  schedule  and  activities  of  the  sub-project  including  the  intended  benefits,  phased 
approach, eligible works and eligibility requirements of WUAs, and community contract approach. 
The  campaign  should  ideally  be  conducted  1-2  months  prior  to  the  Mobilization  phase  with  2 
weeks duration. 
53 
19. 
Topographic  survey.  A  spot-level  survey  will  be  carried  out  on  the  target  area  at  an 
adequate grid spacing, levelling accuracy and contour interval. The output will be a permissible 
service  area  contour  plan  suitable  for:  (i)  hydraulic  design  of  4th  and  3rd  level  canals  and  (ii) 
determination of net irrigable service area (NSA). Another output will be longitudinal and cross 
sections,  of  main  (1st  and  2nd)  canals,  suitable  for  design  of  mudflow  protection  and  modern 
irrigation infrastructure improvements. 
Calculation of productivity of water. The present agricultural PoW (Pa = Ya/ETa) will be 
20. 
estimated using remote sensing image interpretation or other suitable method.25,26 Output will be 
a map of the PSA, showing the spatial variation of present PoW. Potential agricultural PoW (Pc = 
Yc/ETc) will be estimated using the following methods: 
i. 
ii. 
Crop water requirements (ETc) using standard FAO Penman-Monteith method; 27  
Potential crop yields (Yc) using the following methods;

Prepare  initial  irrigation  system  performance  assessment  and  diagnosis  (PAD). 
Based on survey and initial field work, the PIC with oversight by PIU will prepare a pre-feasibility 
level plan for irrigation system modernization. This will form the basis for initial presentation and 
consultation  to  the  stakeholders  (WUAs,  farmers,  and  DWR)  during  mobilization.  This  will 
comprise (i) expected irrigation service area; (ii) schematics for options for canal modernization 
and management; and (iii) expected improvements in yield, PoW, and income. This will include 
the:

Recruitment and preparation of CDT teams. The PIU and PIC will plan and mobilize 
required CDT resources appropriate for planned subproject phasing. This includes development 
of  TOR  and  recruitment,  expected  to  be  undertaken  under  PIC  sub-contract.  Each  CDT  is 
expected  to  comprise  three  individuals:  (i)  a  community  facilitator  to  organize  and  lead 
consultations  and training  meetings;  (ii)  agricultural  technician  to  provide  technical  advice  and 
training for development and implementation of agricultural management planning and capacity 
building;  and  (ii)  irrigation  technician  to  provide  technical  advice  and  training  for  participatory 
irrigation development. 
Establish Subproject Coordinating Committee. An SCC will be established ahead of 
24. 
key mobilization activities. 
4.2  Mobilization (expected 6-9 months duration) 
25.  Mobilization  is  the  first  phase  of  the  subproject  process  and  includes  a  participatory 
approach for the design of irrigation system modernization with the DWR, WUAs, and farmers. It 
is a critical phase as it will establish the foundation for the procurement and construction of works 
and subsequent management phase. Community mobilization is required to: (i) catalyze farmer 
water user demand for irrigated agriculture modernization to optimize the net value of agricultural 
production, and to (ii) form representative WUA and WUA sub-groups that are transparent and 
accountable  to  their  farmer  water  user  members,  for  informed  collective  decision-making  in 
planning, construction and system management. 
26. 
Step 1: Initial mobilization of farmers and WUAs. Farmers and WUA representatives 
from  the  target  beneficiary  area  (nominally,  a  contiguous  area  serviced  by  the  same  main  or 
secondary canal) will be assembled by the PIC and CDT with oversight by the PIU to present the 
intended phased approach and activities. The PIC will undertake a capacity assessment of the 
current WUAs and its sub-units to identify appropriate institutional unit for lower-level canal works 
and management. It is expected that current “zones” could be (i) reorganized along quaternary 
system boundaries to empower the members to participate in system planning and management; 
(ii) as appropriate, aggregated to areas of approximately 120 ha; and (iii) formalized with elected 
Council.  PIC  and  CDTs  will  support WUA  and WUGs  to  achieve  eligibility,  as  required.  To  be 
eligible for project funds via community contracting for lower-level canal works, WUAs or WUGs 
must: (i) meet basic self-governance criteria (see Helvetas Kyrgyzstan. 2014. Governance Self-
Assessment Guide); (ii) female representation on their Council must meet the level stated in the 
project gender action plan (GAP); (iii) as necessary meet additional community contracting criteria 
(see Table  7 below); (iv) undergo training on accounting, irrigation service fee calculation and 
collection;  and  (v)  substantiate  financial  sustainability  for  O&M  through  positive  cashflow  from 
previous 24 months35 and ownership or right of use of land proposed for civil works. 
35 In the event that a newly-formed WUA or WUG is proposed as counterpart, financial sustainability of members must 
be substantiated.

Step 2: Joint system design process. The PIC and CDT with oversight from PIU will 
27. 
facilitate a joint DWR-WUA design process using bottom-up professional irrigation canal planning 
and professional hydraulic design procedures and practices36 and incorporating the results of the 
Advanced Action to determine:   
i. 
ii. 
iii. 
iv. 
v. 
Net service area that is irrigable by gravity from the target canal(s); 
Hydraulic boundaries of quaternary and tertiary units, and therefore: 
Farmer water user membership of quaternary WUGs and tertiary WUAs.  
Determine the number of tertiary canals, locations of their outlets, from main canals, 
and the required operating head (water level) in main canals at each outlet, and; 
Therefore, provide a basis for the hydraulic design of main (1st and 2nd) canals. 
28. 
The  results  of  the  design  process  will  form  a  pre-feasibility  analysis  of  the  subproject 
including description of works, to be finalized by the PIC on behalf of the WUGs and revitalized 
WUAs and approved by the SSC and PIU and submitted to ADB for review. 
Step 3: Prepare civil works packages and counterparts for community contracting. 
29. 
The  PIC  on  behalf  of  the WUAs  and WUGs  with  oversight  from  PIU  will  (i)  conduct  feasibility 
study-level assessment of proposed design; (iii) prepare due diligence for economic and financial 
viability,  environment  and social  safeguards  reports;  and (iv)  prepare  packaging of  civil  works. 
Eligible infrastructure improvements comprise modernization or protective works in line with the 
pre-feasibility analysis (see Table 5). Eco-system or nature-based solutions should be considered 
where feasible and appropriate. 
Procurement  packages  will  be  prepared  for  the  main/secondary  canal  and  associated 
30. 
works in line with the thresholds in the procurement plan in the PAM. Community contracting will 
be  piloted  for  the  Pravaya  Vetka  irrigation  system  lower-level  canal  and  ancillary  works  to  be 
conducted  by  the  WUAs/WUGs.  As  required,  the  PIC  will  facilitate  legal  establishment  of  the 
counterpart  units  for  community  contracting  and  conduct  capacity  building  to  ensure  eligibility 
requirements  are met  (see  Mobilization  Step  1  above  and  Section  5  below).  If  the  community 
contracting pilot is deemed inefficient and unsuccessful, the PIU may request ADB that remaining 
lower-level and ancillary canal works are conducted using traditional contracting methods. 
31. 
Deliverable: The PIU with support from PIC will prepare and submit to ADB for review 
and  approval  the  feasibility  study  document  including  (i)  technical  feasibility  study  report;  (ii) 
economic and safeguards due diligence; and (iii) updated procurement plan with indicative list of 
works packages and cost estimates.

As necessary, the consultants will also refine the climate risk and vulnerability assessment

(CRVA).  The  refined  CRVA  will  effectively  be  a  2050  drought  risk  assessment  comparing  the 
difference  between  2050  projections  and  present  stationary  climate  for  the:  (i)  water  balance 
hazard  and  (ii)  irrigated  agricultural  drought  risk  and  (iii)  an  adaptation  assessment.  Relevant 
projections of 2050 temperature and precipitation are available (see project Sector Assessment).  
57 
Temperature will be used to project potential (reference crop) evapotranspiration (ETo). A 
35. 
simple catchment rainfall – runoff water accounting model37 will be used to project streamflow.  
The project adaptation assessment will be used to facilitate WUG planning for future 2050 drought 
disaster risk management. For example, because of temperature rise and earlier snow and glacier 
melt, the main adaptation intervention is likely to be an earlier start to the annual cropping season.

Design and Procurement (expected 6-12 months duration) 
Lower-level  canal.  The  CDT  teams  with  oversight  from  PIC  and  PIU  will  assist  the 
36. 
counterparts  in  preparing  community  contracting  project  proposals.  The  PIU  will  review  and 
approve the contracting proposals. The first 10 proposals for each sub-project will be submitted 
for ADB prior review and approval, with subsequent packages subject to post review (sampling). 
ADB may impose additional oversight for prior review as necessary. See further information in 
Section 5 below. 
37.  Main canal and ancillary works. The PIU and PIC will: (i) sub-contract detailed design 
of the proposed works, which will incorporate the design considerations described in the feasibility 
study including climate-proofing elements; (ii) prepare bidding documents including safeguards 
requirements;  and  (iii)  and  conduct  tendering  in  line  with  the  procurement  plan  requirements 
including ADB prior review. Contract with winning bidder must not be signed before ADB review 
and approval of the draft contract. 
4.4 
Construction (expected 12-18 months duration) 
If  applicable,  works  may  not  commence  before  remedies  described  in  the  IEE  and/or 
38. 
LARP are undertaken and confirmed by PIC in a report to be submitted to ADB for approval. The 
PIC with oversight from PIU will conduct construction supervision including review of compliance 
with safeguards. 
4.5  Management (expected 24-36 months duration) 
39. 
The PIU and PIC will commence the management phase during construction. The PIC-A 
and CDT will facilitate a participatory planning process with the DWR representatives, WUA and 
WUGs, and farmers to develop and implement: (i) a joint DWR-WUA irrigation management plan 
to be endorsed by the SCC; (ii) agriculture and on-farm water management plan for each targeted 
WUA to be endorsed by the respective WUA Council; and (iii) capacity building for farmers to be 
undertaken  by  WUAs  and  WUGs.  The  plans  and  capacity  building  will  be  developed  in  an 
integrated fashion,  with each  plan/activity  ensuring  consistency  with the  other.  Implementation 
support by the PIC will be conducted over 2-3 cropping years. 
The joint DWR-WUA irrigation management plan is expected to include but not be limited 
40. 
to: (i) water delivery schedule taking into account aggregate cropping pattern based on WUG-
level cropping calendar; (ii) asset management plan including operation and maintenance (O&M) 
financing, cost-sharing, and planning. Irrigation service fee (ISF) level and collection rate should 
be ensure adequate revenue to cover sustainable long-term maintenance and re-investment. The 
agriculture and on-farm water management plan is expected to include but not be limited to: (i) 
37 For example, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), https://swat.tamu.edu/, or 
    Water Evaluation and Planning (WEAP) model, http://weap21.org/.  
58 
cropping  patterns  including  introduction  of  and  diversification  to  “win-win”  crops;38  and  (ii) 
precision surface irrigation methods and scheduling. 
The development and implementation of the management plan will comprise the following 
41. 
activities: 
Crop Diversification and Marketing: Main activity purpose is to promote diversification into 
42. 
modern commercial crops with higher PoW ($ m-3) and NVP ($ ha-1) than present traditional crops, 
and/or to take advantage of the spring “window of opportunity” from March to June.39 For example, 
oils seeds such as rape are presently grown on small areas and generally have as little as a 125 
day growing season and a northern planting date as early as March.40 The PIC and CDT will help 
WUG members,  particularly  women,  to identify  potential  diversified  crops  and potential  buyers 
and  negotiate  equitable  production  support  and  marketing  arrangements.  This  should  include 
information on legal rights, access to finance, and agricultural value chains. 
Irrigation Method and Scheduling: When precipitation is negligible, e.g. during the Kyrgyz 
43. 
summer,  agricultural  productivity  of  water  applied  by  farmers  is  Pa  =  (eYa/ETa)  (see  Sector 
Assessment  linked  document).  The  primary  purpose  will  be  increased  actual  crop  yields  (Ya). 
However, crop yields can be increased by either improved agronomy (fertilizer and seed, etc.) or 
by increased water consumption (ETa). Therefore, if agronomy is also a constraint, this activity 
will address both these issues together. 
44.  Where water is scarce, as it is in the Pravaya Vetka irrigation system, the primary method 
of increasing (ETa) is to increase irrigation efficiency, starting with farmer field-level where physical 
water  losses  are  often  highest.  This  requires  farmer  capacity  development  to  adapt  improved 
irrigation  methods  and  scheduling  to  increase  field-level  application  efficiency  (e  =  water 
consumption  /  water  application)  and,  if  water  application  remains  the  same,  actual  crop 
evapotranspiration (ETa), yield (Ya) and NVP.  
45. 
Therefore,  this  activity  will  promote  farmer  adaption  of:  (i)  precision  furrow  irrigation 
methods (see Sector Assessment linked document), to increase field-level application efficiency 
(e), and (ii) scheduling, including the application of more water to less land, to increase (ETa), (Pa) 
and NVP.41  
Comparative Field Trials (CFTs). Subject to informed WUG member preferences, PIC and 
46. 
CDT will support CFTs under the target areas, if feasible roughly one per 1000 ha. Progressive 
farmers would divide their fields and follow: (i) their traditional production practices on one field 
and (ii) modern crop management practices, irrigation methods and scheduling on others. The 
latter might include a range of (ETa) values, at different crop growth stages, up to potential crop 
evapotranspiration (ETc). Water applications and actual crop yields (Ya) would be measured and 
(ETa) and PoW (Pa) estimated to determine the optimum NVP. 
38 Win-win crops are extensive crops that are both: (a) high-value commercial crops and (b) spring crops (e.g. rape and 
other oil seeds) that don’t compete with traditional crops (e.g. cotton and lucerne) for scarce summer water. 
39 During the spring (March to June) “window of opportunity”, crops with this four-month growing season do not compete 
for scarce summer water with lucerne (perennial), cotton (harvest late September) or corn (August).

59 
Farmer Field Days (FFDs). The PIC and CDT will support the WUAs in organizing and 
47. 
mobilizing farmer field days to bring stakeholders including farmers from the target and nearby 
area as well as nearby areas, DWR and other MOA representatives. The objective of the FFDs 
will  be  to  demonstrate,  share,  and  discuss  agricultural  management  practices  and  equipment 
including  results  of the CFTs. The field  day  can  include presentations,  a farmer’s market,  and 
walk-throughs of the fields. 
Irrigation System Management will increase irrigation system efficiency, from headworks 
48. 
to  farmer  field  (e  =  water  application  /  water  withdrawal).  However,  the  main  challenge  is  to 
improve the timing, adequacy and reliability of water deliveries in a trade-off between the present 
social equity and future economic efficiency objectives (optimum PoW and NVP). Therefore, this 
important output comprises activities for assessment and participatory planning of: (i) cropping 
patterns, (ii) water delivery schedules, management of (iii) drought and (iv) climate change risks 
and (v) sustained system performance through asset management. 
Cropping  Patterns  and  Rotations:  Improve  agricultural  productivity  may  include:  (i) 
49. 
improved  cropping  pattern,  including  diversified  high-value  crops,  and  (ii)  field  rotations  to 
facilitate application of more water to less land to increase (ETa), (Pa) and NVP. For example, the 
latter might involve dividing the NSA into (say) three zones and irrigating only two zones each 
year. To meet the social equity objectives, the zones could be rotated each year: 
i. 
ii. 
iii. 
iv. 
Year 1 = zone 1 (irrigated), zone 2 (irrigated) and zone 3 (not irrigated); 
Year 2 = zone 1 (not irrigated), zone 2 (irrigated) and zone 3 (irrigated); 
Year 3 = zone 1 (irrigated), zone 2 (not irrigated) and zone 3 (irrigated); 
Year 4 = repeat year 1 etc.  
50.  Water  Delivery  Schedules:  to  develop  associated  water  delivery  schedules,  the  above 
cropping patterns, crop water requirements (optimum ETa) and realistic irrigation efficiencies, will 
be aggregated from crop-level, to farmer field, to quaternary WUG and so on up to the headworks 
to determine irrigation water withdrawal requirements. On this basis each tertiary-level WUA will 
negotiate a water delivery contract with DWRM. WUAs and WUGs will have similar agreements. 
51.  Water Balance and Drought Risks: Above cropping pattern and water delivery schedule 
will be based on a transparent irrigation system water balance with an agreed specific reliability. 
For example, irrigation systems are often designed for 80% reliability or probability of exceedance. 
In this case, the probability of drought is 100% - 80% = 20%. However, to optimize the probabilistic 
NVP, WUG members may choose to manage their system:  
i. 
ii. 
Normally, for the normal water balance with (say) 50% probability, and: 
Differently, in the event of drought, (in this case) also with 50% probability; 
52. 
Consultants will extend the water balance (see Sector Assessment linked document) to 
assess drought disaster risks (crop production losses) for different hazard probabilities of (say) 
50%, representing no drought risk (in the above example), 20%, 10%, 5%, 1%, 0.1% and 0.01%. 
The  NVPs,  of crop  production  losses,  will  then be  used to  derive the  annual  average  damage 
(AAD)  from  irrigated  agricultural  drought.  References  in  Section  7.1.2  will  be  used  for  prior 
transparent and equitable prioritization of zones according to their: (i) crops, (ii) growth stage and 
(iii) yield response to water stress or agricultural PoW ($ m-3). Potential AAD reductions will then 
be  used to  assess  alternative  drought risk management  strategies to facilitate WUG  choice of 
their preferred alternative. 
60 
Asset Management: DWR is presently streamlining and finalizing its current draft asset 
53. 
management guidelines.42 The DWR guidelines and other relevant publications,43 will be adapted 
and applied to help WUGs, WUAs and DWRM to prepare their relevant asset management plans 
including transparent realistic costs. These will include more equitable ISF collection income and 
O&M cost-sharing agreements between DWRM and WUAs and WUAs and WUGs. If suitable, 
cost-sharing  agreement  could  comprise  transfer  of  system  O&M  from  DWR  to  WUAs  as  per 
prevailing government policy (see WUA Law, as amended in 2012).  
Capacity  development  and  monitoring  plan:  The  PIU  and  PIU  will  undertake  quarterly

As required by ADB PAI 5.10, board members of the Counterpart will act as the Managing 
Committee for community contracting and construction. The Counterpart will be responsible for 
procurement. To the extent possible, the Counterpart should purchase the construction materials, 
such as cement, steel, stone aggregate and sand, in bulk through shopping procedures by inviting 
at  least  three  quotations,  preferably  from  local  suppliers.  Bulk  procurement  action  should  be 
judiciously exercised to avoid pilferage. Labor component of the subprojects can be extended by 
the members of the community, provided adequate expertise exists.

The existing hydrological network does not allow to fully and reliably observe/monitor the 
hydrological  regime  of the  challenging  terrains/territories of Kyrgyzstan and does  not meet the 
requirements  of  full-fledged  information  support  for  the  tasks  of  qualitative  and  quantitative 
assessment of the region's water resources. The following measures/activities are necessary for 
a meaningful monitoring of the water resources of the Kyrgyz Republic: 
(i)  Increase in the number of stations of the State Observation Network (taking into account 
the recommendations of the World Meteorological Organization) (WMO). In accordance 
with  the  WMO  recommended  estimate  of  the  required  number  of  hydrological  posts 
/gauging stations for various physiographic areas, for the territory of the Kyrgyz Republic 
an area of 199.9 thousand km2 should be 107 draining/drain stations/posts assuming 1 
post/station  per  1875  km2.  At  present,  there  are  78  gauging  stations  operating  in  the 
Kyrgyz Republic, i.е. 1 drain post/station per 2701 km2.

analytical and auxiliary equipment, reliable communication systems. 
methods 
and 
2. 
In  connection  with  the  foregoing,  it  is  proposed  to  restore  observations  at  previously 
existing  and  currently  existing  hydrological  stations,  ensuring  uniformity  of  the  series  of 
observations of water levels and water discharges in the Chui river basin and in Batken, Jalal-

COMPONENT B – TOR FOR INFORMATION SYSTEM 
3. 
In a mountainous area characterized by variations of natural and climatic conditions, the 
existing hydrologic network of Kyrgyz Republic does not allow to fully and reliably monitor/observe 
hydrological regime. Nor does the present system meet the requirement of full-fledged information 
support  for  qualitative  and  quantitative  assessment  of  region’s  water  resources.  The  southern 
regions of Kyrgyz Republic are specifically vulnerable to floods and flash floods. In 1998 Jalal-
Abad and Osh oblasts experienced heavy flooding due to excessive spring rain and snow melt in 
May and June 1998 (source: (World Bank, 1999)). 
The present system of flood warning in Kyrgyz Republic is completely manual and has the 
4. 
below mentioned limitations: 
(i)  The  rainfall  and  discharge  data  is  recorded  manually.  This  data  is  conveyed  to 
Hydromet  Bishkek  over  phone.  Hydromet  maintains  these  records  on  database  and 
hard copy. Limitations: The data transfer from Site to Hydromet Bishkek office takes 
significant amount of time.  
(ii)  Kyrgyzhydromet  generates  flood  warnings  relying  on  validated  data  based  on  the 
dependence of the runoff on rainfall that is developed/designed using historical data 
and  informs  Crisis  Management  Center.  The  Crisis  Management  Department  runs 
‘what if’ scenarios using this information and generates flood alerts and conveys these 
to  the  state  (Oblast)  and  district  (Rayon)-level  disaster  management  agencies. 
Limitations: The generation of flood warnings is a completely manual process and is 
time  consuming.  The  flood  warning  contains  information  about  water  level  and 
discharge at gauge locations only. Limitations: In absence of information about flood 
extent and flood depth the evacuation planning and emergency operations are based 
on experience only. 
5. 
The tasks of obtaining reliable and accurate data about hydrological observations of water 
bodies and improving the quality of information and hydrological services for water management 
complexes cannot  be  solved  without measures to  restore  and further  develop  the  hydrological 
observation system. 
Scope of Work 
6. 
The scope of component B includes:  
(i)  A phone-based system (SMS or android app) to enter data to be transferred to the 
hydromet server. This includes: 
(ii)  A simple android-based form/ or text sms in which user can enter data at site itself 
and this data will be transferred to the hydromet server in digital format. 
(iii) This app will work in offline and online mode i.e. when internet is not available the 
data will be stored in the mobile and as soon as user will be connected to internet the 
data will be transferred to centralized server 
(iv) Data processing application at server to generate discharge and runoff based on 
historical rainfall-runoff ratios. 
(v)  A TRMM rainfall-based system parallel to exiting system 
(vi) Developing appropriate inundation models to predict inundation extent, depth at any 
location in the basin, and validating these against historical flood. 
a.  This should be done for observed as well as TRMM data. 
66 
(vii) Developing an open-source web-based application to generate institution and 
community targeted inundation forecasts and/or alert messages (via SMS and e-
mails) and web enabling the display of maps based on user-selected geographical 
area. 
7. 
This has three major components: 
(i)  Rainfall and runoff data from gauging stations/hydroposts 
(ii)  Data processing at server (Hydromet, Bishkek) 
(iii)  Generation of flood warnings 
Rainfall and runoff data from gauging stations/hydroposts 
8. 
To automate this process, two software applications may be developed.  
SMS based: if user is not using a smart phone he/she can use this functionality to 
9. 
send observed rainfall and discharge data to the Hydromet, Bishkek server on real time 
basis. 
User has to send this text in the standard format, e.g. 
: 
Site Id   
Site Name 
: 
Water level (m): 
Rainfall (mm)  : 
1234 
abcd 
120 
50 
User has to send this text to a fixed mobile number as shown in the figure below: 
Figure 1: SMS based Hydro-meteorological data collection system 
Smart phone based: If user is using smart phone, he/she can use this functionality to 
10. 
send observed rainfall and discharge data to the Hydromet, Bishkek server on real time 
basis. 
A simple android-based form is provided in which the user can enter data at site itself and 
11. 
this data will be transferred to the Hydromet server in digital format. 
12. 
This app will work in offline and online mode, i.e. when internet is not available the data 
will be stored in the mobile and as soon as the user is reconnected to internet the data will be 
transferred to centralized server. 
67 
Figure 2: Android (Smart Phone) based Hydro-meteorological data collection system 
Data processing at server (Hydromet, Bishkek) 
13.  Quality  check  of  incoming  data:  System  will  provide  functionalities  so  that  all  the  data 
received by the system is quality checked and approved by a senior officer of the Department of 
(+/-  20%  of 
Hydrological  Forecasting  of  KyrgyzHydromet.  Any  abnormal  values 
maximum/minimum  of  historical  data)  for  any  site  will  be  highlighted  by  the  system  as  shown 
below in pink color for easy decision-making. 
Table 1: Data quality check and approval process 
Generation of flood warning 
14. 
As  soon  as  data  has  passed  through  quality  check,  based  on  relationship  developed 
between  rainfall  and  discharge  using  historical  data,  system  will  search  this  observed 
rainfall/discharge value in this relationship table. 
If this value falls in warning level based on historical data, the warning will be generated 
15. 
and disseminated by the system automatically through e-mail and SMS to the target users. 
16. 
The overall process is shown in the figure below:

19.  We propose to use open source GIS or ESRI GIS environment to generate input file for 
flood inundation model containing geometric attribute data from a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) 
such as SRTM DEM (30 m resolution)/ World View DEM.  
20. 
Hydraulic  roughness  will  be  estimated  initially  using  the  land  use  map  and  visual 
representation  from  Google  Earth.  Initial  roughness  values  of  0.025  will  adopted  for  the  river 
channels and 0.035 for the floodplains but these values will be used based on channel section 
and discussion with the client.  These will be subsequently varied during the model calibration 
process. Figure 6 shows a typical example of the HEC-RAS set up with a plan view of the modeled 
reaches, longitudinal riverbed profile, and cross-section.

21.  Model  will  be  calibrated  with  the  available  flood  footprints  from  Hydromet  as  well  as 
satellite  images  from  global  data.  Global  mapping  agencies,  such  as  the  Dartmouth  Flood 
Observatory (DFO), and government agencies record the behavior of historical flood events and 
provide footprints of recent floods.

APPENDIX 4: DRAFT TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION 
CONSULTANTS 
I. 
INTRODUCTION 
1. 
These Terms of Reference (TOR) provide specific details of the project which are relevant 
to the assignment, implementation arrangements, and objectives of the consultancy. The TOR 
also  provide  specific  details  on  the  scope  of  the  consultancy  and  the  composition,  roles  and 
responsibilities of the consulting team. 
A. 
BACKGROUND 
The  project  will  strengthen  climate  change  and  disaster  resilience  in  the  water  sector 
2. 
through modernized and well-maintained infrastructure; enhanced agricultural and on-farm water 
management; and improved data collection and analysis. The project interventions will be both 
structural  (including  civil  works  and  equipment) and non-structural  (including  capacity  building, 
planning, and training). The interventions will be focused in agriculturally-productive areas in the 
in the Ferghana Valley in the south of the country (centered around Osh) and in Chui River Basin 
in the north (centered around Bishkek) which are vulnerable to flood, landslide and drought risks 
that are likely to be exacerbated by future climatic risks. 
3. 
ADB’s  value  addition  will  be  two-fold.  The  project  will  take  an  inclusive  participatory 
approach  for  irrigation  system  modernization,  involving  both  government  and  community 
stakeholders, to  support  more productive and  sustainable long-term management. The  project 
will  incorporate  high-level  technologies  in  asset  management  as  a  means  of  supporting  more 
effective  and  sustainable  preventative  and recovery  works.  In  doing  so,  the  project  will  aim  to 
develop  a  comprehensive  package  of  climate  change  and  disaster  resilience  investment  in  a 
model that may be replicated and scaled up elsewhere in subsequent projects. 
4. 
The  project  executing  agencies  (EA)  are:  (i)  the  Department  of  Water  Resources  and 
Melioration of the Ministry of Agriculture, Food Industry, and Melioration (DWR) responsible for 
output  1;  and  (ii)  Ministry  of  Emergency  Situations  (MOES)  responsible  for  output  3.  A  single 
project  implementation  unit  (PIU)  will  be  established  within  DWR,  delegated  to  implement  the 
entire project on behalf of DWR and MOES. 
B. 
OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE OF THE PROJECT 
5. 
The project outcome will be climate change and disaster resilience of infrastructure and 
water security improved. The project will be aligned with the following impact: losses from climate 
change-related disasters reduced in the water resources and agriculture sectors.44 
6. 
Output 1: Irrigation infrastructure protected and modernized. The project will protect 
and modernize irrigation systems to improve the water productivity of approximately 20,000 ha 
irrigated land through upgrading and construction of main (primary and secondary) canals, lower-
level (intra-farm and on-farm) canals, and associated infrastructure such as protective mudflow 
crossing  structures,  and  cross-regulators,  and  offtakes.  A  participatory  planning,  design,  and 
management process involving the DWR, WUAs, and other key stakeholders will be mobilized to 
ensure equitable and sustainable outcomes. WUA and sub-WUA groups will be reorganized and 
strengthened.  One  representative  subproject  has  been  selected  and  developed  during  project 
44 Kyrgyz Republic. 2015. Intended Nationally Determined Contribution to the UNFCCC Paris Agreement. Bishkek; and 
Kyrgyz Republic. 2018. Development Program of the Kyrgyz Republic for 2018-2022, Unity, Trust, Creation. Bishkek. 
81 
preparation  and  the  project  will  select  a  further  2-3  subprojects  for  investment  during 
implementation. Community-based contracting will be piloted for lower-level canal modernization 
in the representative subproject, to be expanded to further subprojects if shown to be successful.  
Output 2: Irrigation system and agricultural land management enhanced. The project 
7. 
will strengthen management and operation and maintenance (O&M) of target irrigation systems 
including  practical  drought  and  climate  risk  management.  In  conjunction  with  output  1,  the 
participatory  planning  process  will  develop  and  implement  joint  DWR-WUA  irrigation  system 
management plans including water delivery scheduling and O&M financing and planning. WUA 
on-farm  water  management  and  agricultural  management  plans  with  gender  elements  will  be 
developed, including irrigation scheduling, cropping patterns, and cultural methods, and will be 
supported with capacity building for farmers and community members (including women) such as 
comparative field trials and farmer field days. 
8. 
Output  3:  National  disaster  risk  management  capacity  improved.  The  project  will 
support capacity building and upgrade equipment for national disaster risk management in the 
water  resources  sector.  Heavy  machinery  and  associated  equipment  for  preventative  and 
rehabilitation  works  will  be  purchased  and  installed  in  the  Northern  and  Southern  Emergency 
Response Centers of the MOES. This will be accompanied by enhancement of the Centers’ asset 
management  and  capacity  building  on  disaster  risk management  including  project  planning,  to 
more  efficiently  undertake  preventative  and rehabilitation  works  in  the  water  resources  sector. 
Hydrological posts for KyrgyzHydromet will be installed in approximately 20 sites in the project’s 
target  areas  and  an  information  system  for  enhanced  data  collection,  processing,  and  flood 
warning will be piloted for improved efficiency and accuracy. 
9. 
The project is implemented under the sector loan modality. Under project preparation the 
feasibility study was prepared for only one “core” representative subproject for output 1 and 2: the 
Pravaya Vetka Irrigation System in Jalal-Abad district. It is expected that during implementation, 
additional subprojects (approximately 2 to 3, covering roughly 20,000 ha of irrigated area) will be 
selected from a long-list in line with the project eligibility criteria and feasibility study, due diligence, 
detailed  design  undertaken.  In  addition,  roughly  20  sites  for  hydrological  monitoring  station 
construction  or  rehabilitation  have  been  identified  during  project  preparation,  and  for  which 
feasibility study, due diligence, and detailed design will be conducted during implementation. 
II.  SCOPE OF SERVICES  
The  project  implementation  consultant  (PIC)  will  support  DWR,  MOES,  and  the  newly 
10. 
established project implementation  unit (PIU) to manage project implementation. The scope of 
services  and  detailed  tasks  of  the  PIC  are  given  in  the  following  paragraphs.  For  indicative 
purposes  only,  this  package  of  consulting  services  is  estimated  at  58  person-months  of 
international consultants and 121 person-months of national consultants. 
11. 
For outputs 1 and 2, the PIC will support the efficient and timely implementation by the 
PIU of the design and implementation of a participatory design and management approach for 
irrigation system modernization and protection to improve productivity of water in the target areas. 
The services will cover: overall project management, oversight, and coordination; procurement 
support;  monitoring  and evaluation;  construction  supervision:  and  capacity  building  for  system 
management (O&M). 
12. 
For output 3, the PIC will support the efficient and timely implementation by the PIU of the 
procurement  and  installation  of  equipment  and  accompanying  capacity  building  activities  for 
82 
MOES and KyrgyzHydromet. The services will cover: overall project management, oversight, and 
coordination; procurement support; monitoring and evaluation; and construction supervision. 
III.  KEY EXPERTISE REQUIRED 
13. 
The  consultant  team  will  be  led  by  an  international  firm  with  preferably  10 years’ 
experience in designing and preparing similar externally financed projects in the water resources 
and related sectors, preferably with ADB and in the Central Asia region. It may be advantageous 
for the lead firm to partner with a local firm or NGO with experience in community  mobilization 
and WUA capacity development activities for outputs 1 and 2. 
14. 
The terms of references are prepared on a performance (output) basis, and thus proposing 
firms  will  in their  proposal  determine  the  number  and  the  nature  of  experts they  will  require  to 
achieve  assignment  tasks  and  deliverables,  in  accordance  with  their  proposed  approach  and 
methodology. However, DWR and MOES requires a minimum number of key experts, including 
a  Team  Leader,  as  tabulated  in  Table  1  below.  A  time-based  contract  will  be  awarded  to  the 
winning firm with provisional sums for (i) workshops, and training ($60,000), (ii) studies, surveys, 
and  design  ($500,000),  and  (iii)  community  mobilization  and  development  ($500,000).  The 
contingency under the contract are provided in the amount of $235,000. 
In addition to the required key experts, the proposing entities should also include in their 
15. 
technical proposal, in the personnel work plan, and in their financial proposal all other “non-key 
experts” required in accordance with their proposed approach and methodology. The proposing 
entity must also determine and indicate the number of person-months for which each key or non-
key  expert  will  be  required.  For  indicative  purposes  only,  the  non-key  experts  might  include: 
environment  specialist, 
financial  management  specialist,  and  procurement  specialist. 
Administrative and support roles (e.g. firm’s own financial and contract management) should not 
be included as non-key experts, and such costs should instead be factored into the overall bid 
price. Note: in their proposal of non-key experts, firms should not duplicate the national consultant 
positions already appearing in the PIU.
