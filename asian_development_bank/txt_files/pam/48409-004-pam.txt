Project Administration Manual Purpose and Process 
The  project  administration  manual  (PAM)  describes  the  essential  administrative  and 
management requirements to implement the project on time, within budget, and in accordance 
with the policies and procedures of the government and Asian Development Bank (ADB). The 
PAM should include references to all available templates and instructions either through linkages 
to relevant URLs or directly incorporated in the PAM. 
The  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Forestry  (MAF)  and  its  provincial  departments  are  wholly 
responsible  for  the  implementation  of  ADB-financed  projects,  as  agreed  jointly  between  the 
recipient and ADB, and in accordance with the policies and procedures of the government and 
ADB. ADB staff is responsible for supporting implementation, including compliance by MAF of 
its obligations and responsibilities for project implementation, in accordance with ADB’s policies 
and procedures. 
At grant  negotiations,  the  recipient  and  ADB  shall  agree to  the  PAM  and ensure  consistency 
with  the  grant  agreement.  Such  agreements  shall  be  reflected  in  the  minutes  of  the  grant 
negotiations. In the event of any discrepancy or contradiction between the PAM and the grant 
agreement, the provisions of the grant agreement shall prevail. 
After  ADB  Board  approval  of  the  project's  report  and  recommendations  of  the  President, 
changes in implementation arrangements are subject to agreement and approval pursuant to 
relevant government and ADB administrative procedures (including the Project Administration 
Instructions) and upon such approval, they will be subsequently incorporated in the PAM.

Rationale 
I.  PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
1. 
Agriculture sector remains an important part of the Lao PDR’s economy. However, it faces 
a range of physical, economic, and capacity constraints: (i) infrastructure and capacity constraints, 
including inadequate supply of inputs, production technologies and access to affordable credit; 
(ii) an aging and declining labor force due to migration of youth to urban areas; (iii) poor enabling 
policy  environment  characterized  by  onerous  registration  requirements  and  conflicting 
regulations; (iv) a low level of private sector participation resulting in low investment at farm level 
in new  and innovative technologies  such  as  mechanization;  and  (v)  limited competitiveness of 
agriculture value chains due to lack of adequate knowledge of value addition and marketing, and 
underdeveloped marketing systems.  
2.

MAF will establish a National Project Management Office (NPMO) within its Department 
of Planning and Finance (DOPF). NPMO (Figure 2) will be headed by a project director, assisted 
by  a  project  manager,  and  will  comprise  a  chief  accountant,  rural  infrastructure  engineer, 
procurement  officer,  safeguards  officer,  contracts  administration  officer,  and  a  finance  and 
administrative  assistant. NPMO  will  provide  updates  of  implementation  progress to the  project 
steering committee.

The bulk of the project activities will be carried out at the provincial and district levels. 
However,  lessons  learned  from  past  projects  include  the  need  to  involve  MAF’s  specialized 
technical  departments  and  organizations.  The  specialized  departments  and  organizations  will 
assist NPMO to design the implementation program and prepare their own work plans/budgets 
and  contribute  to  the  overall  work  plan.  The  following  table  outlines  the  lead  implementation

14. 
At  provincial  level,  the  implementing  agencies  are  the  provincial  governments,  whose 
function and role will be through the provincial agriculture and forestry offices (PAFO). The PPIUs 
will be established within the PAFOs utilizing, to the extent feasible, infrastructure, and equipment 
and vehicles under previous ADB projects, e.g. Smallholder Development Project (2001– 2015) 
and the Sustainable Natural Resource Management and Productivity Enhancement Project (2009 
–  2015).  The  PPIUs  will  be  chaired  by  the  director  of  the  province  and  comprise  a  project 
coordinator, accountant, rural infrastructure engineer, and administrative assistant. 
15. 
Implementation  at  the  district  level  will  be  the  responsibility  of  the  respective  district 
governments  in  the  project  areas.  The  district  project  implementation  units  (DPIU)  will  be 
established  within  the  district  agriculture  and  forestry  offices  (DAFO).  Field  activities  will  be 
supervised  by  PPIU  and  the  respective  DPIUs  in  MAF’s  technical  departments.  DPIU  will 
comprise a district project director and an administrative assistant. The tasks and responsibilities 
of all government staff to be assigned under the project is detailed in Appendix 2.  
16. 
Project  implementation  consultants  (PIC)  will  be  mobilized  to  support  MAF  and  the 
implementing agencies to carry out a range of activities on capacity building and detailed designs. 
16  
IV.  COSTS AND FINANCING 
17. 
The project is estimated to cost $46.37 million. The government has requested a grant in 
the amount of $40.5 million equivalent from ADB’s Special Funds resources to help finance the 
project. ADB will finance the expenditures in relation to works, equipment, consulting services, 
incremental operating costs and taxes and duties. 
18. 
The government will  finance  the  equivalent  of  $0.75 million for counterpart staff salaries 
and office space. The beneficiaries will finance the equivalent of $5.12 million as contribution to 
upgrade infrastructure under the matching grants scheme. The government will make the grant 
proceeds available to the executing agency and implementing agencies on a grant basis.

Financial Management Assessment 
V.  FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT 
The  financial  management  assessment  (FMA)  was  conducted  from  October  2016  to 
22. 
March 2017 in accordance with ADB’s Guidelines for the Financial Management and Analysis of 
Projects and the Financial Due Diligence: A Methodology Note. The FMA considered the capacity 
of  MAF  as  the  executing  agency  and  PAFO  of  participating  provinces  as  the  implementing 
agencies,  including  funds-flow  arrangements,  staffing,  accounting  and  financial  reporting 
systems, financial information systems, and internal and external auditing arrangements. Based 
on the assessment, the key financial management risks identified are (i) limited capacity in the 
control of budget execution, accounting, reporting, and auditing; (ii) limited financial management 
capability  of  staff  of  NPMO  and  PPIUs;  (iii)  lack  of  accounting  system  to  record  financial 
transactions;  and  (iv)  limited  capacity  in  internal  audit.  It  is  concluded  that  the  overall  pre-
mitigation financial management risk of MAF and the PAFOs is substantial. MOF has capacity to 
administer the advance fund and implement SOE procedures. MAF, as the executing agency and 
with its extensive experience in the implementation of past and ongoing ADB projects, has agreed 
to  appoint  qualified  staff  with  capacity  to  administer  the  statement  of  expenditure  (SOE) 
procedures.  MOF,  MAF,  and  PAFOs  have agreed to implement  an  action  plan  to  address the 
financial management time-bound action plan is provided in Table 8.

B. 
Disbursement 
1. 
Disbursement Arrangements for ADB Funds 
The  grant  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  Loan  Disbursement 
23. 
Handbook  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  detailed  arrangements  agreed  upon 
between the government and ADB. Online training for project staff on disbursement policies and 
procedures is available and project staff are encouraged to avail of this training to help ensure 
efficient disbursement and fiduciary control.3  
24. 
Advance  fund  procedure.  MOF,  upon  grant  effectiveness,  will  be  responsible  for 
establishing, managing, replenishing,  and liquidating  the  advance  account  at the  Bank  of  Lao. 
The currency of the advance account is the United States dollar. The advance account will be 
used exclusively for ADB's share of eligible expenditures. MOF is accountable and responsible 
for proper use of advances from the advance account, including advances to any sub-accounts. 
Six  sub-accounts  will  be  established  in  a  commercial  bank.  These  will  be  opened  and 
25. 
managed by NPMO and the five PPIUs in the provinces of Champasak, Khammouane, Saravan, 
Savannakhet, and Sekong. Expenditures of Vientiane Capital and other MAF departments will be 
under  NPMO.  The  sub-accounts  are  to  be  used  exclusively  for  ADB's  share  of  eligible 
expenditures. 
26. 
The total outstanding advances to the advance account should not exceed the estimate 
of ADB's share to be paid through the advance account for the forthcoming six months. MOF may 
request  initial  and  additional  advances  to  the  advance  account  based  on  an  Estimated 
Expenditures Sheet setting out the estimated expenditures to be financed through the accounts 
for the forthcoming six months. Supporting documents should be submitted to ADB or retained 
by the executing agency in accordance with the Loan Disbursement Handbook (footnote 4) when 
liquidating or replenishing the advance account. 
Statement of expenditure procedure.4 The state of expenditure (SOE) procedure may 
27. 
be  used  for  reimbursement  and  to  liquidate  and  replenish  the  advance  accounts  for  eligible 
expenditures. Any individual payment to be reimbursed or liquidated under this procedure shall 
not exceed a ceiling of $50,000. Supporting documents and records for the expenditures claimed 
under  the  SOE  should  be  maintained  and  made  readily  available  for  review  by  ADB's 
disbursement and review missions, upon ADB's request for submission of supporting documents 
on  a  sampling  basis,  and  for  independent  audit.  Reimbursement  and  liquidation  of  individual 
payments  in  excess  of  the  SOE  ceiling  should  be  supported  by  full  documentation  when 
submitting the withdrawal application to ADB. 
Before the submission of the first withdrawal application (WA), the recipient should submit 
28. 
to ADB sufficient evidence of the authority of the person(s) who will sign the WAs on behalf of the 
government, together with the authenticated specimen signatures of each authorized person. The 
minimum value per WA is stipulated in the Loan Disbursement Handbook (footnote 4). Individual 
payments  below  this  amount  should  be  paid  (i)  by  the  executing  agency  and/or  implementing 
agency  and subsequently  claimed  to ADB through reimbursement,  or  (ii)  through the  advance 
3  The handbook is available electronically from the ADB website (http://www.adb.org/documents/ loan-disbursement-
handbook.  
4  SOE forms are available in Appendix 7B of ADB’s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to 
time). 
26  
fund  procedure,  unless  otherwise  accepted  by  ADB.  The  recipient  should  ensure  sufficient 
category  and  contract  balances  before  requesting  disbursements.  SOE  records  should  be 
maintained and made readily available for review by ADB's disbursement review mission or upon 
ADB's request for submission of supporting documents on a sampling basis, and for independent 
external audit. The WAs must be sequentially numbered starting with number one.  
29. 
Further  to  Schedule  2  (para.  5)  of  the  Grant  Agreement,  a  withdrawal  from  the  Grant 
Account will not be made for the procurement of equipment (private) until MOF confirms to ADB 
(in writing) that the relevant beneficiaries have committed to contributing their share of the cost. 
2. 
Disbursement Arrangements for Counterpart Funds 
NPMO and PPIUs will be responsible for the disbursement and liquidation procedures for 
30. 
government  funds  and  will  (i)  prepare  disbursement  projections,  and  (ii)  request  budgetary 
allocations for counterpart funds. Project management staff salaries and supplements will also be 
covered by counterpart funds.  
C. 
Accounting 
31.  MOF, NPMO, PPIUs, and DPIUs will maintain separate project accounts and records by 
funding source for all expenditures incurred on the project following International Public Sector 
Accounting  Standard  for  cash-based  accounting.5  The  NPMO  will  prepare  project  financial 
statements in accordance with government accounting laws and regulations which are consistent 
with  international  accounting  principles  and  practices.  A  record  of  government  in-kind 
contributions/counterpart funds shall also be maintained regularly.  
D. 
Auditing and Public Disclosure 
32.  MAF will cause the detailed consolidated project accounts to be audited in accordance 
with  International  Standards  on  Auditing  by  an  independent  auditor  acceptable  to  ADB.  The 
audited project financial statements, together with the auditor's opinion, will be presented in the 
English language to ADB within six months of the end of the fiscal year by the MAF. 
33. 
The audited entity financial statements, together with the auditor’s report and management 
letter, will be submitted in the English language to ADB within one month after their approval by 
the relevant authority. 
34. 
The audit report for the project financial statements will include a management letter and 
auditor’s opinions, which cover (i) whether the project financial statements present an accurate 
and fair view or are presented fairly, in all material respects, in accordance with the applicable 
financial  reporting  standards;  (ii)  whether  the  proceeds  of  the  grant  were  used  only  for  the 
purpose(s) of the project; and (iii) whether the recipient or executing agency was in compliance 
with the financial covenants contained in the legal agreements (where applicable). 
Compliance with financial reporting and auditing requirements will be monitored by review 
35. 
missions and during normal program supervision, and followed up regularly with all concerned, 
including the external auditor. 
5  An  eLearning  module,  found  in  https://www.adb.org/about/financial-management-resources,  can  be  used  by  the 
project team to deliver training to the EA and IA staff. 
27 
36. 
The government, MAF, and the implementing agencies  have been made aware of ADB’s 
approach to delayed submission, and the requirements for satisfactory and acceptable quality of 
the audited project financial statements.6 ADB reserves the right to require a change in the auditor 
(in  a  manner  consistent  with  the  constitution  of  the  recipient),  or  for  additional  support  to  be 
provided to the auditor, if the audits required are not conducted in a manner satisfactory to ADB, 
or if the audits are substantially delayed. ADB reserves the right to verify the project's financial 
accounts to confirm that the share of ADB’s financing is used in accordance with ADB’s policies 
and procedures. 
37. 
Public disclosure of the audited project financial statements, including the auditor’s opinion 
on the project financial statements, will be guided by ADB’s Public Communications Policy 2011.7 
After the review, ADB will disclose the audited project financial statements and the opinion of the 
auditors on the project financial statements no later than 14 days of ADB’s confirmation of their 
acceptability  by  posting  them  on  ADB’s  website.  The  management  letter,  additional  auditor’s 
opinions, and audited entity financial statements will not be disclosed. 
VI.  PROCUREMENT AND CONSULTING SERVICES 
A. 
Advance Contracting  
All advance contracting will be undertaken in conformity with ADB Procurement Guidelines 
38. 
(2015, as amended from time to time) and ADB’s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as 
amended from time to time). The issuance of invitations to bid under advance contracting will be 
subject to ADB approval. The government, MAF and DOPF have been advised that approval of 
advance contracting does not commit ADB to finance the project. Contracts can only be signed 
after the project is declared effective. 
NPMO  will  initiate  recruitment  of the  (i)  start-up management  consultants  (international 
39. 
project  management  specialist  and  national  project  management  &  coordination  specialist), 
(ii) PIC,  and  (iii)  the  financial  management  entity  (FME).  ADB’s  approval  on  various  stages, 
including requesting for expressions of interest, shortlisting, sending out requests for proposals, 
and evaluation of technical and financial proposals will be sought prior to proceeding with the next 
step. NPMO will also initiate procurement of vehicles and office equipment/furniture. The bidding 
documents (prepared under the PPTA) will be finalized, requests for quotations will be sent out, 
and evaluation of quotations/bids will be completed in time for project effectiveness. 
B. 
Procurement of Goods, Works, and Consulting Services 
6  ADB’s approach and procedures regarding delayed submission of audited project financial statements:  
(i)  When audited project financial statements are not received by the due date, ADB will write to the executing 
agency advising that (a) the audit documents are overdue; and (b) if they are not received within the next six 
months, requests for new contract awards and disbursement such as new replenishment of advance accounts, 
processing of new reimbursement, and issuance of new commitment letters will not be processed. 
(ii)  When audited project financial  statements  are  not  received  within  six  months after  the due  date,  ADB  will 
withhold processing of requests for new contract awards and disbursement such as new replenishment of 
advance accounts, processing of new reimbursement, and issuance of new commitment letters. ADB will (a) 
inform the executing agency of ADB’s actions; and (b) advise that the grant may be suspended if the audit 
documents are not received within the next six months. 
(iii)  When audited project financial statements are not received within 12 months after the due date, ADB may 
suspend the grant. 
7  Public Communications Policy:  http://www.adb.org/documents/pcp-2011?ref=site/disclosure/publications. 
28  
All  procurement  of  goods  and  works  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB’s 
40. 
Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time). 
41. 
For goods, international competitive bidding (ICB) procedures will be used for contracts 
estimated  at  $1  million  or  more,  national  competitive  bidding  (NCB)  procedures  for  contracts 
estimated  at  $100,000  or  more,  and shopping  procedures for  contracts  estimated  at  less than 
$100,000. For works, ICB procedures will be used for contracts estimated at $3 million or more, 
NCB procedures for contracts estimated at $100,000 or more, and shopping procedures at less 
than $100,000. 
42. 
The Harmonized Bidding Documents for the Procurement of Goods and Works of the Lao 
PDR will be used for small contracts through shopping and NCB duly following the NCB annex in 
the procurement plan.  
43. 
An 18-month procurement plan indicating threshold and review procedures, goods, works, 
and consulting service contract packages and national competitive bidding guidelines is in Section

Start-up Consultants. Two individual consultants will be recruited to assist NPMO with 
62. 
start-up activities. 
63. 
Project  Implementation  Consultants  (PIC).  PIC  consulting  firm  will  be  recruited  to 
(i) provide management and technical assistance to the EA and IAs in the  implementation of the 
project and meet the reporting and procedural requirements of ADB; (ii) carry out feasibility studies 
and supervise construction of the subprojects; (iii) assist in project performance monitoring and 
evaluation;  (iv)  develop  and  implement  the  capacity  building  master  plan;  (v)  implement  policy 
research studies and pilot activities; and (vi) ensure adequate provision for compliance with social 
and environmental safeguards, including monitoring and review during the construction and post-
construction period. 
38                 
64. 
Financial  Management  Entity  (FME).  The  FME  will  be  a  team  or  consortium  of  firms, 
consisting  of  individuals  capable  of  performing  business  analysis  and  formulation  of  business 
plans and financial projections for agribusiness and agro processing business. The main function 
of the FME will be to evaluate and recommend grant applications from agribusiness enterprises 
(ABEs) in conformity with agreed financial support evaluation criteria and percentage contributions 
by beneficiaries and the project towards overall subprojects. The FME will also assist in providing 
awareness  and  capacity  building  in  green  finance  instruments,  as  agreed  with  the  executing 
agency, to Lao PDR financial institutions committed to supporting the agribusiness sector. 
65. 
External Monitoring Agency (EMA). To monitor all safeguard activities under the project. 
EMA will focus on assessing progress and compliance with the environmental management plans 
(EMPs),  the  ethnic  group  development  plans  (EGDP),  the  gender  action  plan,  and  the  land 
acquisition  and  compensation  plans  (LACPs),  identifying  constraints  and  developing  remedial 
actions to effectively address these. The EMA will be a national entity and will have experience in 
resettlement, environment and ethnic groups.  
66. 
External  Auditor.  The  firm  will  annually  audit  the  project  financial  statements  in 
accordance with international standards for auditing or the national equivalent acceptable to ADB, 
and prepare a report (which includes the auditor’s opinion on the financial statements, use of the 
grant proceeds, and compliance with the financial covenants of the Financing Agreement as well 
as  on  the  use  of  the  procedures  for  advance  fund(s)  and  statement  of  expenditures)  and  a 
management letter (which sets out the deficiencies in the internal control of the project that were 
identified in the course of the audit, if any). Audit services will cover from project effectiveness until 
project completion.  
Individual Consultants. In addition, 6 finance and administration assistants (360 person-
67. 
months) for NPMO and PPIUs will be recruited.  
68. 
Single  Source  Selection.  In  close  coordination  with  NAFRI,  the  International  Rice 
Research  Institute  (IRRI)  (package:  CS  05),  will  be  recruited  using  the  single-source  selection 
method to assist the MAF in deploying  climate-resilient varieties of rice and vegetables, and in 
strengthening capacity of stakeholders on climate smart agriculture production technologies and 
practices. IRRI has been working with Lao PDR on crops and climate change research since 1991 
- a time when climate change was considered a marginal topic within agriculture research. The 
institute has defined a coherent research portfolio on climate change emphasizing on three areas: 
adaptation, mitigation, and policy. This sets crop production into the broader context of food supply 
and  food  security  alongside  socioeconomic  issues,  such  as  rural  development  and  gender 
mainstreaming. IRRI also maintains good working relationships with other international research 
institutes belonging to the Consortium of International Agricultural Research Centers (CGIAR) and 
the World Vegetable Center, and has agreed to deliver their solutions to Lao PDR in a seamless 
manner.8    Outline  of  the  terms  of  reference  is  in  Appendix  3.  The  NAFRI  will  develop  detailed 
terms of reference, with support from project implementation consultants.

A. 
Resettlement and Land Acquisition 
VII. SAFEGUARDS9 
The  project  has been  assessed  as  Category  B for  resettlement  and  land acquisition  as 
69. 
there  will  be  no  significant  involuntary  physical  or  economic  dislocation,  relocation  or  loss  of 
livelihood.  Subproject  screening  during  project  preparation  and  to  be  used  during  project 
implementation in identifying additional subprojects, will reject any cases requiring any significant 
involuntary  resettlement  or  land  acquisition  activity.  Land  acquisition  will  be  limited  and  mainly 
comprise thin strips of land to accommodate irrigation canal construction and field access road 
improvement.  Land  acquisition  will  be  carried  out  through  negotiated  settlement  based  upon 
market values, and in some cases, to secure the project, communities are willing to voluntarily 
donate  small  strips  of  non-productive  land.  These  latter  donations  are  subject  to  stringent 
conditions and due diligence to verify bona fides. If negotiation fails and expropriation will be used, 
land acquisition and resettlement plan shall be drafted in accordance with the LARF and sent to 
ADB for concurrence and disclosure prior to the issuance of the bidding documents. 
70. 
During  project  preparation,  feasibility  studies  were  conducted  for  three  representative 
subprojects  proposed  under  output  1:  (i)  rice  mill  upgrading;  (ii)  improvements  to  a  vegetable 
processing,  storage  and  marketing  hub;  and  (iii)  improvements  to  a  state-owned  biofertilizer 
factory. The project design team conducted meaningful consultations for safeguards planning and 
such consultations will continue during project implementation. Land acquisition under the project 
is only envisaged under Output 1, and mainly for the rehabilitation of irrigation systems and limited 
road  works.  Both  these  activities  will  not  cause  significant  resettlement  impacts  because  most 
works will be along existing canal or route alignments and will only require, if any, the acquisition 
of minor  amounts  of  land.  Any  access  track  improvement  associated  with any  subproject must 
follow  existing  footprints  and  not  involve  further  acquisition  of  land.  Design  alternatives  are 
investigated to minimize the need for land acquisition. 
71. 
Other activities identified under project preparation such as the rice mill and biofertilizer 
factory improvements and construction of any training or laboratory buildings will not require land 
acquisition  by  the  project.  Land  required  under  the  rice  mill  initiative  is  already  available  and 
belongs to the selected rice mill owner. The biofertilizer factory is on state land and there is land 
still available for expansion of storage areas within the existing compound. Vegetable processing 
and  storage  facilities  delivered  via  farmer  groups  or  cooperatives  will  be  constructed  on  land 
already  acquired  by  the  group  or  being  purchased  under  private  commercial  transactions  at 
current market value, according to the principle of “willing buyer and willing seller” arrangements, 
and independent of the project. 
72. 
During implementation, the project must carry out due diligence to ensure that the farmer 
group have made any decisions to buy or lease land in a transparent manner and in accordance 
with the group’s articles and memorandum of association regarding voting and decision making. 
The community must also be provided with the details of the implementation grievance redress 
procedure as an added safety valve. This will be a priority first task for the implementation team. 
Due diligence for sample subprojects will be updated based on detailed design, and due diligence 
will be conducted for non-sample projects. 
73. 
A resettlement framework has been prepared to guide the preparation of land acquisition 
resettlement plans (LARPs) where subprojects require land acquisition, and to conduct and report 
9 ADB. 2009. Safeguard Policy Statement. https://www.adb.org/documents/safeguard-policy-statement 
40                 
the due diligence required to establish voluntary land donation bona fides. The LARP will record 
details of any land acquired and or donated by affected households and calculates the amount of 
compensation payable to the affected households that can be audited later. 
The  NPMO  safeguards  officer,  under  the  guidance  of  the  international  and  national 
74. 
safeguards  specialists  of  the  PIC,  will  then  screen  all  additional  subprojects  identified  during 
CFAVC implementation and rigidly apply both the involuntary and voluntary screening checklists. 
Where  involuntary  acquisition  or  voluntary  land  donation  will  take  place,  the  specialists  must 
prepare a LARP in accordance with the framework provided by the PPTA team. This LARP must 
clearly outline the community consultation process and detail the benefits to be received by the 
affected households. LARPs will be subject to a 10% case audit by an independent agent selected 
through a transparent bidding process conducted by the CFAVC management unit. 
A. 
Indigenous People/ Ethnic Groups 
75. 
The  project  has  been  classified  as  category  B for  indigenous  people and  ethnic groups 
mainly due to the presence of ethnic groups in the project provinces and the potential involvement 
of some minority households in farmer groups or in irrigation or access road subprojects selected 
for implementation. Due diligence on three representative subprojects showed that there were no 
indigenous  peoples.  Therefore,  no  indigenous  people’s  plan  (IPP)  has  been  prepared.  The 
vegetable  hub  representative  subproject  includes  50%  group  members  belonging  to  an  ethnic 
group.  
76. 
An ethnic group development framework has been prepared for any subprojects that will 
impact on ethnic groups. The extent to which this framework will be used depends upon the scale 
and nature of impact, and it is most likely to be used only in irrigation or access road rehabilitation 
subprojects. 
The project must conduct due diligence in such cases to ensure that the group’s decision-
77. 
making  process  is  inclusive  and  transparent  and  carried  out  with  the  full  knowledge  and 
awareness of all group members regardless of ethnicity and carried out in accordance with the 
group’s articles and memorandum of association. This due diligence must be carried out before 
the group receives any ADB investment funds. 
B. 
Environment 
An environmental assessment has been conducted for representative subprojects during 
78. 
project  preparation.  The  three  representative  subprojects  have  been  classified  as  Category  C 
based on the ADB’s rapid environment assessment checklist. However, the overall project is still 
classified as Category B, as there may be a few subprojects with some adverse environmental 
impacts which can be mitigated. To support the environmental management of these anticipated 
impacts of future subprojects, an environmental assessment and review framework (EARF) has 
been  prepared  as  a  linked  document.  The  EARF  provides  guidance  for  the  preparation  and 
implementation  of  mitigation  measures  when  minor  environmental  issues  arise  through 
environmental management plans. 
79. 
For category B subprojects, an initial environmental examination (IEE) is required and a 
suitable EMP should be developed and applied to strengthen management during the period of 
construction  of  infrastructure.  The  need  for  improved  occupational  health  and  safety  in  the 
operation of improved equipment at the biofertilizer factory and in the rice milling processing, as 
well  as  in  the  dispersal  of  inputs  in  the  intensive  horticultural  activities  associated  with  market 
       41 
garden  and  vegetable  hub  activities  has  also  been  recognized.  The  farmers  involved  in  the 
vegetable hub are also pursuing completion of GAP certification, a status which will also ensure 
that concerns and day-to-day practices associated with environmental management and resource 
stewardship is enhanced and maintained. Budget for EMP implementation will be included in the 
design, construction, operations and maintenance costs.  
80. 
A subproject screening process is applied before any additional subprojects are selected 
to ensure that proposed  activities fit  ADB  environmental  category  B  or  C  or  are  environmental 
category  1  under  the  2010  environmental  impact  assessment  sub-decree  of  Lao  PDR.  No 
category  A  subprojects  will  be  funded.  Subprojects  located  immediately  adjacent  to  protected 
areas and that could lead to encroachment or higher risk of exploitation of natural resources in 
protected areas will be excluded. 
81. 
Institutional  arrangements.  MAF  will  be  responsible  for  ensuring  that  environmental 
performance is monitored throughout implementation and the project is implemented in line with 
ADB  and  government  requirements  for  environmental  safeguards.  MAF  will  appoint  a  national 
safeguards  officer  at  NPMO.  S/he,  duly  assisted  by  the  international  and  national  safeguards 
experts of the PIC, will be active in site supervision, management and appraisal, particularly to 
identify potential and any current problems, and solve them in a timely manner.  
Grievance  redress  mechanism.  A  grievance  redress  mechanism  (GRM)  will  be 
82. 
established in each subproject province in compliance with ADB’s SPS (footnote 11) requirement 
to prevent  and  address community  concerns  and assist  the  project to  maximize environmental 
and social benefits. The GRM will be accessible to diverse members of the community, including 
more vulnerable groups such as women and youth. Multiple points of entry, including face-to-face 
meetings, written complaints, telephone conversations, or e-mail, will be available. Details about 
the GRM can be found in the EARF and IEE. 
Prohibited investment activities. Pursuant to ADB’s Safeguard Policy Statement 2009, 
83. 
ADB  funds  may  not  be  applied  to  the  activities  described  on  the  ADB  Prohibited  Investment 
Activities List set forth at Appendix 5 of the Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). 
Disclosure.  The  executing  agency  and  implementing  agencies  will  be  responsible  for 
84. 
disclosing  all  safeguard  reports  at  the  provincial  level  and  on  the  project  website.  During  the 
project  implementation  period,  all  IEEs  and  semi-annual  environmental  safeguard  monitoring 
reports will be submitted to ADB every July, which will cover the reporting period of January to 
June, and every January, which covers the reporting period of July to December for disclosure on 
ADB website.   
VIII.   GENDER AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS 
85. 
In the context of project gender and social dimensions, the Report and Recommendation 
of the President includes the linked document Social Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy, and 
the  following  supplementary  documents:  (i)  detailed  poverty  and  social  impact  analysis;  (ii) 
detailed gender analysis, (iii) stakeholder consultation and participation plan; and (iv) stakeholder 
communications strategy. These documents are summarized under the sections below. 
A. 
Social Dimensions of the Project 
86. 
Links to the National Poverty Reduction and Inclusive Growth Strategy and Country 
Partnership Strategy. The project supports the national poverty reduction strategy of Lao PDR 
42                 
and  directly  contributes  to  poverty  reduction,  inclusive  growth  and  achievement  of  social 
development  goals  of  rural  populations.  The  Five-Year  National  Socio-Economic  Development 
Plan VIII (2016-2020) (8th NSEDP) is a means of implementing the National Strategy on Socio-
Economic Development  until  2025  and  Vision  until  2030. The  8th  NSEDP  aims  to:  (i) facilitate 
eligibility  for  graduation  from  LDC  status  by  2020;  (ii)  consolidate  regional  and  international 
integration in the context of the launching of the ASEAN Economic Community in 2015; (iii) take 
further  steps  towards  industrialization  and  modernization  and  to  enhance  the  well-being  of  the 
people  and  the  prosperity  of  the  country  to  achieve  the  ranking  as  an  upper  -middle-income 
country  by  2030.  The  agriculture  sector contributes to the  8th  NSEDP  through the  MAF’s  long 
term framework for the development of the agriculture and forestry sector which is enshrined in 
the  “Agricultural  Development  Strategy  to  2025  and  vision  to  the  year  2030”.  This  document 
includes the following sectoral vision and aim “Ensuring food security, producing comparative and 
competitive  agricultural  commodities,  developing  clean,  safe  and  sustainable  agriculture  and  a 
shift gradually to the modernization of a resilient and productive agriculture economy linking with 
rural  development  contributing  to  the  national  economic  basis”.  The  current  ADB  Country 
Partnership Strategy (CPS) 2012–2016 supports the 7th National Socio-Economic Development 
Framework (NSEDP). ADB’s support has directly assisted education, water and other municipal 
infrastructure and services, together with the agriculture and energy sectors. The new ADB CPS 
2017–2021 is being discussed with the government and is geared to support and match the 8th 
NSEDP. 
87. 
Key  Poverty  and  Social  Issues.  Lao  PDR  has  achieved  the  Millennium  Development 
Goal target of halving its national poverty rate over the past decade.10  However, poverty reduction 
and consumption growth lag the country’s GDP growth. The poverty rate in rural areas is 2.9 times 
that  of  the  urban  areas.  Various  analyses  identify  education,  agricultural  produce  prices, 
livelihoods  and  geographic  location  as  important  factors  in  determining  poverty  patterns  and 
trends  in  the  country.  Underlying  these  are  factors  that  are  more  difficult  to  quantify,  such  as 
ethnicity, traditions, and attitudes towards gender and education. There is vulnerability to poverty 
in the subproject areas, mainly because households face constraints in resources such as small 
landholdings,  vulnerability  to  extreme  climatic  events,  limited  water  for  cropping,  and  non-
affordable credit. 
Impact  channels. The project  will  directly  assist  in the  development  of effective  supply 
88. 
arrangements between poor farmers, cooperatives, water users’ groups, processors, distributors, 
and traders. Subproject investments will directly reduce poverty among beneficiaries and lead to 
higher  household  incomes  and  the  creation  of  rural  employment  opportunities.  The  project  will 
provide support along the length of the rice and vegetable value chains to ensure that value chain 
linkages are strengthened. Poor farmers will be encouraged to strengthen their producer groups 
to  provide  quality  products  at  the  right  time  and  with  continuity  of  supply.  Landless  and  poor 
households will be included in agribusiness development and vocational training. 
89. 
Other  social  and  poverty  issues.  The  very  poor  still  have  problems  in  accessing 
microfinance. Beneficiaries priority need was a source of affordable credit at low interest, as an 
alternative to informal loans at high interest rates.  
90. 
Project design features. Identified poor households in subproject areas will be targeted 
for job opportunities related to civil works. Landless or poor farmers will have the opportunity to 
access off-farm and on-farm employment related to post-harvest support services such as farm 
mechanization, drying, milling, grading and storage of produce.

B. 
Gender Dimensions of the Project 
91. 
Gender dimensions. Women are key actors in the rice and vegetable value chains—they 
are  producers,  collectors,  intermediaries  and  rice  millers,  and  they  own  and  operate  their  own 
brokerage  and  trading  enterprises.  On  an  average,  women  represent  50%  of  the  population 
engaged  in  the  agricultural  sector  in the  targeted  provinces.  Rural  women  generally  have  joint 
access to and control over land and capital together with their husbands. Men and women have 
equal  access  to  markets,  although  it  is  mainly  men  accessing  marketing  information.  They 
generally jointly agree when, where, and to whom to sell produce. The top two priority needs for 
both women and men farmers are: (i) year-round supplementary irrigation water, and (ii) access 
to affordable (short term) credit. Women farmers face additional constraints that include: (i) limited 
capacity  including  insufficient  technical  skills  related  to  productivity  enhancement,  insufficient 
information  about  the  impact  of  climate  change,  and  an  inadequate  understanding  of  market 
mechanisms and how to respond effectively to market information; (ii) less access to agricultural 
extension and business trainings; and (iii) a lower level of financial literacy compared to their male 
counterparts in the targeted areas. Moreover, women in Lao PDR were found to spend over four 
times more time than men on household and caring work, which limits women’s participation in 
economic activities and training opportunities. The target populations are largely homogeneous, 
but  ethnic  minority  (Laven)  households may  be poorer than other households.  Female-headed 
households or elderly households are generally constrained by labor shortages. 
92. 
The MAF adopted a gender mainstreaming strategy for the sector: “Vision the year 2030, 
Ten-Year Gender Equality Strategy of Agriculture, Forestry and Rural Development Sector, from 
2016 to 2025”. The strategy includes targets related to facilitating and increasing participation of 
female  farmers  and  poor  families  in  all  activities  and  trainings  to  45%  participation,  increasing 
participation of women in decision making to more than 25%, increasing participation of female 
technical staff in trainings in different topics to 35% participation by 2025, and building capacity of 
the Subcommittee for the Advancement of Women (Sub-CAWs) of the sector at each level. One 
of the objectives of the strategy is also to increase women’s representation among female staff in 
the  sector  to  30%  at  all  levels.  Note  that  women  constitute  about  25%  of  the  MAF  staff  in  the 
targeted provinces for this project.

The National Commission for the Advancement of Women and Lao Women’s Union (LWU) 
are  the  two  main  institutions  responsible  for  monitoring  the  Convention  for  the  Elimination  of 
Discrimination Against Women implementation and mainstreaming gender into various sectors, 
including coordinating the gender-related work of line ministries and development partners and 
monitoring and evaluating the implementation of national strategies and action plans. 
94. 
Gender action plan. A gender action plan (see Table 19) has been prepared and includes 
gender  actions  and  numerical  targets  to  promote  women’s  voice  and  active  participation  in  all 
project activities. Implementation of all the gender action plan activities is aligned and meant to 
support  implementation  of  the  Gender  Equality  Strategy  of  Agriculture,  Forestry  and  Rural 
Development Sector 2016-2025. The project will actively involve the MAF’s Commission for the 
Advancement  of  Women  Division  (CAW),  the  Department  of  Technical  Agricultural  Extension 
Services and Processing’s CAW focal point, the PAFO and DAFO Sub-CAW gender focal points, 
and the LWU as key partners in implementation and monitoring of the gender action plan activities.

implementation,  monitoring  and  reporting  rests  with  the  executing  agency  and  implementing 
agency.  NPMO  will  appoint  a  gender  focal  point  preferably  from  the  MAF  CAW  who  will  work 
44                 
closely  with  the  PAFO  and  DAFO  Sub-CAW  gender  focal  points  and  the  LWU.    At  project 
inception, a clear terms of reference will be developed for LWU’s involvement as key partner in 
project implementation. Representative of the MAF CAW will be invited to attend all the meetings 
of the project technical review committee and encouraged to share gender-related aspects of the 
project. The MAF CAW will ensure that implementation of gender action plan activities is aligned 
and  supports  the  MAF  Gender  Strategy  implementation.  Social  development  and  gender 
specialists (international, 6 person-months; and national, 30 person-months) will be recruited as 
part  of  the  PIC  team  to  build  capacity  of  the  NPMO  and  PPO  staff  and gender  focal  points  in 
gender analysis and mainstreaming, and provide support to gender action plan implementation, 
monitoring  and  reporting.11  The  terms  of  reference  of  the  social  development  and  gender 
specialists are contained in the terms of reference of the PIC. Work plans and budget to implement 
the  gender  action  plan  activities  will  be  prepared  annually.  The  project  M&E  framework  will 
integrate  gender  sensitive  indicators  included  in  the  design  and  monitoring  framework  and the 
gender  action  plan.  During  project  implementation,  regular  meetings  will  be  conducted  with 
women farmers organized by gender focal points and LWU with the support from the consultants 
to find out about their concerns and specific training needs, and to ensure that they are included 
as demonstration and targeted farmers for the adoption of climate-friendly techniques. 
96. 
Adequate financial resources have been allocated to implement the gender action plan. 
Implementation of its activities will be covered by the budget allocated for implementation of the 
regular  project  activities  under  the  corresponding  outputs,  including  any  extra  costs  implied  by 
special arrangements that shall be made to facilitate and increase women’s participation in the 
regular project activities (e.g. such as series of shorter training sessions at venues closer to their 
communities)  and  the  costs  related  to  the  conduct  of  a  gender  analysis  of  the  targeted  value 
chains shall be integrated in the PIC contract.  
11 Allocation of additional person-months for the social development and gender specialists will be made with additional 
financing for the project upon the GCF approval.

Monitoring  
Project  performance  monitoring  system  (PPMS).  A  PPMS  will  be  developed  and 
98. 
implemented by the NPMO with the assistance of the PIC. A draft PPMS is attached in Appendix 
7 for review and finalization when PIC is on board. The PPMS will be approved by NPMO and 
endorsed by PSC for no-objection by ADB. Data will be collected at the village level to identify the 
current  socio-economic  conditions  of  target  beneficiaries  and  to  assess  the  impact  of  the 
investments. The PPMS will be based on inputs, outputs and outcomes to be measured from the 
baseline survey and throughout project implementation. PIC’s international and national PPMS 
experts will be responsible for baseline survey, and for subsequent surveys. 
99. 
Compliance  monitoring.  MOF  has  agreed  with  ADB  on  certain  covenants  for  the 
proposed  project,  which  are  set  forth  in  the  grant  agreement  including  the  following:  (i)  only 
investments that have been screened by ADB-approved consultant (i.e., FME) shall be financed 
by the grants; (ii) the government will ensure that adequate funds are allocated for the periodic 
maintenance  of  infrastructure  to  maintain  any  infrastructure  in  functional  order;  and  (iii)  the 
government will also ensure that a grievance mechanism is established for affected people in the 
participating districts. 
100.  ADB  will  monitor  compliance  with  those  covenants  throughout  implementation  through 
regular review missions, quarterly progress reports submitted by the NPMO, and review of project 
accounts and procurement procedures. 
101.  Social  and  environment  safeguards  monitoring.  Safeguard  monitoring  will  be 
undertaken by the safeguard experts under PIC. Independent external monitors will be recruited 
by  NPMO  to  ensure  that  all  recommendations  and  mitigation  measures  under  the  EMPs,  the 
EGPs, and the resettlement plans are implemented in accordance to the plans. For involuntary 
resettlement, NPMO with the assistance of PIC will set up monitoring indicators, databases, and 
systems. PPIUs will oversee monitoring resettlement plan. 
102.  Gender and social dimensions monitoring. Regular monitoring of gender action plan 
implementation  will  be  done  during  project  implementation.  The  PPMS  will  monitor  women’s 
participation in all project capacity building, training events and meetings, for both female staff 
       55 
and  women  farmers.  Sex-disaggregated  data  will  be  collected  regularly  wherever  relevant 
(particularly in relation to project activities that are linked to specific actions and for which verifiable 
sources of data for monitoring will be available at community/village level), and gender specific 
and sensitive indicators from the DMF and the gender action plan will be integrated as part of the 
PPMS. The NPMO will ensure regular monitoring and reporting (at least semi-annually to ADB) 
on the progress of gender action plan implementation; the template to be used for gender action 
plan monitoring and reporting is included as Appendix 4. 
103.  Participatory monitoring of project impact will be implemented at the midterm of the project 
and this will include women’s focus groups discussions and interviews with individual households, 
Sub-CAW gender focal points and LWU representatives for obtaining quantitative and qualitative 
data. Household interviews will include adequate representation of female-headed households. 
C. 
Evaluation 
104.  ADB  will  conduct  regular  (at  least  twice  a  year)  review  missions  throughout  project 
implementation to assess implementation performance and achievement of project outcomes and 
objectives, examine financial progress, and identify issues and constraints affecting the project, 
and work out time-bound action plans for their resolution. 
105.  A midterm review mission will also be undertaken within 30 months of grant effectiveness. 
This  review  will  include  a  comprehensive  evaluation  of  project  implementation  arrangements, 
detailed  evaluation  of  the  scope  and  implementation  process  and  progress  of  investments, 
feedback from the PPMS, performance of consultants, capacity building progress, and possible 
reallocation  of  grant  proceeds.  During  this  more  significant  review,  the  impact  from  enhanced 
performance of APGs will be assessed as will the performance of the value chain credit facility 
developed under the project. Remedial actions will be instituted as required. 
106.  Within  12  months  of  physical  completion  of  the  project,  ADB  will  conduct  a  project 
completion review mission to carry out a preliminary assessment of the success of the project to 
achieve  its  physical,  and  socioeconomic  developmental  objectives,  as  well  as  to  review 
compliance with ADB requirements and grant covenants. 
D. 
Reporting  
107.  NPMO  will  provide  ADB  with  (i)  quarterly  progress  reports  in  a  format  consistent  with 
ADB's  project  performance  reporting  system  (Appendix  5);  (ii)  consolidated  annual  reports 
including  (a) progress  achieved  by  output  as  measured  through  the  indicator's  performance 
targets,  (b)  key  implementation  issues  and  solutions,  (c)  updated  procurement  plan,  and  (d) 
updated implementation plan for next 12 months, consistent with the approved annual workplan; 
and  (iii)   a  project  completion  report  within  6  months  of  physical  completion  of  the  project.  To 
ensure the project continues to be both viable and sustainable, project accounts and the executing 
agencies’ AFS, together with the associated auditor's report, should be adequately reviewed. 
E. 
Stakeholder Communication Strategy  
108.  A  stakeholder  communication  strategy  has  been  prepared,  drawing  on  best  practices 
outlined  in  ADB’s  Public  Communications  Policy.12  It  is  based  on  principles  of  transparency, 
timeliness, meaningful participation, and inclusiveness. It will ensure that vulnerable groups, such

as  the  poor  and  female-headed  households,  who  risk  marginalization,  are  provided  with 
opportunities  for  receiving  timely  information,  and  can  provide  feedback  during  project 
implementation. Stakeholders include: (i) project direct and indirect beneficiaries with a focus on 
micro-  and  small-enterprises  and  small  agri-businesses;  (ii)  civil  society  organizations;  (iii) 
community  groups  and  individuals  living  in  the  project  area;  (iv)  private  agencies  and  service 
providers who share an interest in the outcomes and/or impacts of the project; and (v) government 
agencies  with  a  role  in  implementation.  The  strategy  serves  to  inform  and  support  community 
development, enhance government capacity to deliver a positive project outcome, and enhance 
project performances while mitigating any potential negative impact.

ANTICORRUPTION POLICY 
109.  ADB’s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)13    is  consistent  with  its 
commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency  ADB  reserves  the  right  to 
investigate, directly or through its agents, any violations of the anticorruption policy relating to the 
project. All contracts financed by ADB shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit 
and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  executing  agency  and  all  project  contractors, 
suppliers, consultants and other service providers.  Individuals/entities on ADB’s anticorruption 
debarment list are ineligible to participate in ADB- financed activity and may not be awarded any 
contracts under the project. 
110.  To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB’s Anticorruption Policy are included 
in the grant regulations and the bidding documents for the project. All contracts financed by ADB 
about the project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the 
records and accounts of MAF, NPMO, the PPIUs, and DPIUs, as well as all contractors, suppliers, 
consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the project. Individuals/ entities on ADB’s 
anticorruption debarment list are ineligible to participate in ADB- financed activity and may not be 
awarded any contracts under the project.14 The project design and implementation arrangements 
provide  for mitigation  of corruption  risks.  Risks  associated  with project management,  including 
procurement and disbursement, will be mitigated by the engagement of a PIC to advise and assist 
in the procurement of goods and services, and the engagement of other consultants. The project 
will also establish a website or establish a subpage under the existing MAF’s website in which it 
will disclose implementation progress; bid notifications and their results; and provide grievance 
mechanism against any corrupt practice.  
XI. 
ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISM 
111.  Those  parties  who  are,  or  may  in  the  future  be,  adversely  affected  by  the  project  may 
submit complaints to ADB’s accountability mechanism. The accountability mechanism provides 
an independent forum and process whereby people adversely affected by ADB-assisted projects 
can voice, and seek a resolution of their problems, as well as report alleged violations of ADB’s 
operational  policies  and  procedures.  Before  submitting  a  complaint  to  the  accountability 
mechanism, those affected should make a good faith effort to solve their problems by working 
with the concerned ADB operations department.  Only thereafter, and if they are still dissatisfied, 
should they approach the accountability mechanism.

IMPLEMENTATION PROCEDURES 
Output  1:  Critical  agribusiness  value  chain  infrastructure  improved  and  made 
1. 
climate-resilient. This output includes the following activities: 
2. 
 Activity 1.1: Rehabilitating small-scale irrigation infrastructure and rural roads to climate-
resilient condition. This activity will  (i) improve and upgrade  tertiary canals from earth-lined to 
brick-lined or concrete structures (targeting 10,000 ha  and 6,000 households with at least 15,000 
women)  to  direct  water  to  the  farmer’s  field  and  reduce  water  losses,  while  ensuring  that  the 
improved  structures  are   climate-resilient; (ii) rehabilitate  at  least  150  water retention  ponds to 
provide  supplemental  irrigation  during  droughts  (targeting  300  ha  and  750  households);  and 
(iii) improve  and  upgrade  at  least  45  km  of  earth-based  farm  access  roads  to  climate-resilient 
gravel-based  surfaces  (benefitting  20,000  households  with  at  least  50,000  women  to  improve 
supply  of  inputs  to  farms  and  market  access,  reduce  post-harvest  crop  losses,  and  enhance 
safety).  National  Project  Management  Office  (NPMO)  will  implement  this  activity  under  the 
guidance of the Department of Irrigation (DOI) as lead technical oversight agency. 
3. 
During  the  processing  stage  of  the  project,  a  longlist  of  candidate  investments  was 
identified and a shortlist of priority subprojects were agreed upon by the provincial agriculture and 
forestry offices (PAFO), district agriculture and forestry offices (DAFO), and farming communities. 
Prioritization of subprojects from the longlist will be done by NPMO, taking into consideration the 
inputs  of the  provincial  project  implementation  units  (PPIU)  and  district project  implementation 
units (DPIU) and after assessment of the requirements of the agriculture production groups (APG) 
and enterprises, to complement activities under the project. The prioritized list will be reviewed 
and endorsed by NPMO and submitted to the Project Technical Advisory Committee (PTAC) for 
approval. ADB will also provide no objection on the list. The PIC will commence work on feasibility 
studies, following an FS template in Appendix 6, of the priority packages. Detailed designs will be 
prepared by DOI. The bidding documents will be prepared by NPMO with the assistance of the 
PIC.  The  master  bidding  documents,  based  on  the  Harmonized  Bidding  Documents  for  the 
Procurement of Goods and Works of the Lao PDR, have been prepared. 
Candidates for support under this activity will be evaluated against the following selection 
4. 
criteria:  
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
(v) 
The subproject must not be in the mandate for improvement under an existing ADB 
rural infrastructure project, e.g., Greater Mekong Subregion East-West Economic 
Corridor Agriculture Infrastructure Project; 
The proposed irrigation and road improvement work must be directly farm linked; 
The proposed irrigation work should focus, primarily, on tertiary canal upgrading 
from soil lined canals to concrete and/or brick lined structures; however, other civil 
works  may  be  considered  at  the  discretion  of  the  executing  agency  and  on 
justification from PAFOs; Introduction of appropriate bio-engineering approaches 
to the upgrade specification and detailing of roads and canals is to be encouraged, 
both  from  the  climate  change  perspective,  as  well  as  specifically  helping  to 
maintain the traditional biodiversity of the canal systems; 
The proposed road works should focus on upgrading a minimum of 5 km road by 
the levelling and consolidation of soil based surfaces to gravel; 
The  proposed  civil  works  must  be  appropriately  designed  to  take  into  account 
adaptation to climate change variabilities such as improved drainage, particularly 
flooding (such as road drainage, concrete rather than earthen canals); and 
Appendix 1       65

linkages for at least 50 APGs. The lead technical agency are NAFRI for the research centers, 
DALAM for the soil testing laboratories, and DOA for plant diagnostics laboratories (including the 
upgrading of soil and plant testing laboratories in 2 agricultural colleges). 
6. 
The  Department  of  Agricultural  Land  Management’s  (DALAM)  diagnostic  soil  testing 
laboratory  and  the  Department  of  Agriculture’s  (DOA)  plant  protection  laboratories  will  be 
upgraded to meet at least regional compliance standards for food safety and organic, including 
organic  fertilizer  certification.  DALAM  and  DOA  submitted  detailed  priority  lists  of  equipment, 
infrastructure, and training and capacity building. While DALAM’s diagnostic soil laboratory will 
be furnished with necessary equipment, DOA will receive broader support including upgrading of 
plant protection testing laboratory equipment, improved demonstration plots, and integrated pest 
management section. 
7. 
PIC will conduct a needs analysis on the rice research centers, vegetable seed research 
centers,  soil  laboratories,  and  plant  protection  laboratories  in  the  provinces  of  Khammouane, 
Saravan and Savannakhet, identify subprojects for prioritization, and develop an implementation 
plan.  The  prioritized  list  and  implementation  plan  shall  be  submitted  to  NPMO  for  review, 
incorporation in the overall workplan, and endorsement to PTAC. Guidance may be sought from 
PCFC for any vague financial issues. Upon ADB’s no objection on the list, NPMO shall notify the 
research  centers  and  laboratories  on  their  respective  approved  subproject  for  preparation  of 
design, specifications and initial procurement documentation of the needed equipment, facility, 
supplies  or  small  works.  Procurement  will  be  done  by  NPMO.  PIC  will  assist  NPMO  on 
procurement where necessary, in accordance with ADB’s policies on procurement. The following

13.  Matching Grant Scheme.16 Financial support will be provided to qualified agribusinesses 
through a matching grant scheme (MGS) with beneficiaries contributions in cash. The operational 
guidelines for MGS were developed in cooperation with the World Bank, which is implementing a 
similar  MGS  in  other  provinces.  The  MGS  will  be  handled  by  the  financial  management  entity 
(FME) consultants under MAF-ADB approved operating guidelines.  
The  co-investment  requirement  can  be  variable  depending  on  the  level  of  risk  and 
14. 
readiness for co-investment currently established at 60:40, subject to PCFC and ADB approval. 
The MGS will support agribusinesses in targeted sub-sectors (rice, vegetables and bio-fertilizers) 
to encourage private investment and also to increase their overall competitiveness. The MGS will 
provide a grant to cover up to 50 percent of investment cost in post-harvest facilities, including 
cleaning,  drying,  storage,  and  processing.  The  recipient  agribusinesses  are  to  provide  the 
remaining  40  percent  of  investment from  a  combination  of  equity  and commercial  loans. They 
should  also  provide  a  market  plan  with  a  sound  market  analysis,  and  provide  evidence  of 
agreements with business partners and APGs. To ensure independency, the selection process 
will be administered by the FME, which will also assist the shortlisted agribusinesses to apply for 
commercial loans. 
15.  MOF    and  MAF  confirmed  that  such  support  to  the  private  sector  is  in  line  with  the 
government's objectives on agricultural commercialization and trade facilitation. However, MOF 
and MOIC cautioned that the matching grants should not undermine the development of other 
financial institutions and should not distort the credit market.  
Subject to any agreed changes to the operations manual during an initial review by the 
16. 
FME upon start-up, the steps in the MGS process are as shown in the figure below.   
16 Details of the Matching Grant Scheme and its operational guidelines, including the establishment and implementation 
of smallholder financing scheme (SFS) under activity 2.3, are available in a supplementary document.

Output 2: Climate smart agriculture and agribusiness promoted. This output includes 
19. 
the following activities: 
20. 
Activity  2.1:  Deploying  climate-resilient  rice  and vegetable  varieties.  Yields  of  both  rice 
and vegetable varieties grown in the target provinces are adversely impacted by climate change. 
Under  this  activity,  the  project  will  support  the  National  Agricultural  and  Forestry  Research 
Institute (NAFRI) to develop, trial and release climate-resilient rice and vegetable varieties.17  An 
agreement with the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) will be initiated to develop new 
rice  varieties  and  improve  land  management  and  crop  establishment,  which  are  resource  use 
(labor,  water,  energy)  efficient,  with  reduced  risk  and  drudgery,  able  to  generate  avenues  for 
employment  and  economically  attractive  to  youth  and  women.  The  varietal  characteristics  will 
include tolerance to higher temperatures, drought, prolonged submergence as well as varieties 
with shorter cropping cycles. Support will be provided to NAFRI to develop a commercialization 
program with recommendations on the legal framework to develop intellectual property rights and 
partial  cost  recovery  for  the  institution.  The  lead  technical  oversight  agency  for  this  activity  is 
NAFRI. 
17  The National Agricultural and Forestry Research Institute (NAFRI) is the government research agency responsible 
for increasing agricultural productivity, improving crop diversification and ensuring environmental sustainability and 
stability of rural livelihoods through agricultural research and technology utilization.

preparation of the terms of the agreement with International Rice Research Institute (IRRI). 18 On 
the introduction and distribution of the rice varieties, the following should be kept in mind when 
preparing the agreement,  as a wide range of climate adaptation practices has been evaluated on 
farm.  These  included  the  testing  of  (i)  precision  land  leveling,  (ii)  improved  wet  season  rice 
varieties  (drought,  submergence  tolerance  and  short-duration  varieties),  (iii)  drum  and  direct 
seeding of wet season rice, (iv) double cropping of short duration wet season rice crops improved 
agronomy, including nitrogen management and weed control, (v) improved planting rules for rain 
fed crops, and (vi) supplementary wet season irrigation from stored water. Most of these practices 
appear to perform as well or better than current farmer practices and seem to offer technically 
feasible  opportunities  for  adaptation,  as  well  as  providing  immediate  benefits  under  current 
climate conditions. The general trends exhibited by modelling of the adaptation practices are that 
the 2030 climates in many cases do not suggest a major decline in yields. 
22. 
Activity 2.2: Strengthening capacity in climate smart and organic agriculture. The project 
will  strengthen  technical  capacity  of  MAF  staff,  including  PAFO  and  DAFO  staff,  farmers  and 
farmers’ groups (20,000 farmers of which at least 40% are women and 2,000 are ethnic group 
members), water user groups, APG committee members, agribusinesses, and other value chain 
actors  on  CSA,  organic  farming  and  agribusiness.  Women  led/owned  agribusinesses  will  be 
identified  during  the  6-month  awareness  raising  program  on  matching  grants  scheme.  To  the 
extent  possible,  regional  and  international  institutions  such  as  IRRI  and  International  Water 
Management Institute will be engaged to assist in capacity building. The Department of Technical 
Extension and Agricultural Processing shall be the lead technical oversight agency. 
An initial capacity-building master plan is to be developed by the start-up consultants, and 
23. 
reviewed  and  finalized  by  PIC  in  close  consultation  with  NPMO,  PTAC  and  PCFC  to  ensure 
training needs are identified and assessed carefully. The master plan may include the following: 
(i) 
(ii) 
Training of Trainers (TOT) courses. The courses indicated below may be merged 
and form part of an overall TOT curriculum and are not exhaustive. It is recommended 
that the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations publication, Climate 
Smart Agriculture Sourcebook,19 is used as a guideline when preparing TOT courses, 
including  the  following:  controlled  environmental  agricultural  technology  (CEAT) 
including hydroponics, good agricultural practices (GAP), integrated pest management 
practices, farm mechanization, organic farming, land preparation and sustainable land 
management  techniques,  on  farm  micro  irrigation  techniques  and  innovation,  post 
harvesting and handling, value addition and marketing, climate change adaptation and 
mitigation measures, and environmental and gender issues in farming. 
Farmer training courses. Based on the advice of district project implementation units 
(DPIUs), selected farmers will be trained in CSA through district level training courses. 
The courses, the content of which will be based on the subjects indicated above, will 
be  delivered  by  Department  of  Technical  Extension  and  Agricultural  Processing 
18   Note that it is recommended that IRRI is contracted under single source selection, since it is the leading international 
agency responsible for rice variety research. In addition, over the past decade IRRI has had a close involvement in 
the Lao PDR rice sub sector. For example (i) in collaboration with the World Bank, IRRI prepared the “Lao People’s 
Democratic Republic Rice Policy Study, 2012”  
(file:///C:/Users/User/Documents/LAOS/REFERENCE%20DOCUMENTS/WB%20FAO%20LAOS%20RICE%20P
O;ICY%202012REV.pdf); and (ii) in collaboration with ACIAR, IRRI prepared the “Rice in Lao Study, 2006” 
(http://www.worldcat.org/title/rice-in-laos/oclc/99996465).

(DTEAP)  staff  who  have  completed  TOT  courses  and  appointed  by  the  National 
Project  Management Office  (NPMO),  and  organized  by  PIC. The indicated  average 
duration  of  each  course  is  five  days,  including  one-day  practical  field  work.  The 
courses  will  be  arranged  with  intermittent  sessions  over  a  maximum  of  five  weeks. 
Each training session  should be  organized  with a maximum  of  25  participants,  with 
duration of at least one full day per session. 
Farm  demonstration  plots.  Field  demonstrations  on  farm  mechanization,  micro 
irrigation and water conservation, climate-resilient varieties, and CEAT techniques will 
be  undertaken  using  a  roadside  demonstration  plot  provided  by  a  volunteer  lead 
farmer selected by the PPIU/DPIU under overall advice from the DTEAP. The project 
will  nominate  lead  farmers  responsible  for  the  demonstration  plots.  The  project  will 
provide  the  lead  farmer  with  a  stock  of  farm  equipment  including  micro  irrigation, 
mechanized and other farm tools and implements, CEAT such as shade houses, net 
houses, green houses, and an annual supply of agricultural inputs including seeds and 
planting materials, fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides. It is proposed that the project 
pays the lead farmer a nominal fee to compensate for the use of his/her land, and time, 
for demonstration purposes.  
Farmer  field  days.  Regular  field  days  will  be  organized  at  critical  times,  such  as 
planting or harvest, for small groups of a maximum of 10, linked to the demonstration 
plots described above. 
Farmer study tours. Farmers wishing to learn from examples of growing or improving 
crop  production,  using  innovative  technology,  will  be  eligible  for  participation  in 
regional tours of one-week duration, in groups of 10 maximum, to suitable locations in 
the region, particularly Cambodia, Southern China, Thailand, and Viet Nam. 
(vi)  Workshops.  A  minimum  of  three  workshops  will  be  organized,  at  central  level,  to 
discuss  developments  in  innovative  farm  technology  including  research  and 
development  studies,  experiences  of  individual  farmers,  and  solutions  to  problems. 
Three provincial level workshops will also be held during the lifetime of the project. 
Farmer group training. Training will be provided to APGs and water user groups in 
group 
logistics,  marketing, 
certification and networking. A main objective is to encourage several APGs, say in a 
district, to evolve into agricultural cooperatives.

(viii)  Gender sensitization. The safeguards, gender and social development specialist will 
provide training for government officials, workshops and provincial/district gender focal 
points, facilitated by the NPMO safeguards officer. 
The  masterplan  should  include  all  information  dissemination  and  promotion  seminars, 
24. 
trainings  under  this  activity  and  other  safeguards,  gender,  project  financial  management,  and 
procurement sessions, taking into consideration the timing, human resources, target participants, 
agricultural calendar and budget. The plan shall be updated and revised, as necessary. The plan 
should  also  provide  for  post-training  evaluation  mechanisms  and  should  be  in  sync  with  the 
annual workplans. Detailed budget estimate should be prepared and approved by NPMO prior to 
implementation  of  each  training/workshop/seminar  at  least  one  month  prior  to  ensure  fund 
availability.  The financial  training  program (FTP) targeting the farmers,  APGs, research  center 
staff, laboratory staff, private enterprises, and financial institution personnel should be developed 
by the FME. The FTP will include the curricula, materials, resource persons, budget estimates, 
and  timing,  and  should  be  incorporated  in  the  capacity-building  master  plan.  The  FME  will 
implement the FTP. 
25. 
Activity  2.3:  Promoting  smallholder  financing  scheme  for  climate-friendly  agriculture. 
Under this activity, the project will provide financial and technical support to APGs entering into 
Appendix 1       75 
profitable agribusiness ventures through the establishment and operation of smallholder financing 
scheme (SFS). Further details are in the matching grant operations manual as a supplementary 
document. Small investments in farm-based CSA technology, mechanization and infrastructure 
may be funded through the SFS on a group guarantee basis, subject to the guidelines on SFS. A 
key activity under this activity will be the promotion and support to the formation of agricultural 
cooperatives  for  those  interested  APGs  who  meet  the  requirements  of  regulations  under  the 
ministerial agreement dated 25 September 2014.20 The SFS will be directly managed by the FME, 
with oversight from the PCFC. 
26. 
APG members will be supported to gain access and apply knowledge of on farm climate 
smart and organic agricultural practices and technologies. The aim is to improve yields, quality, 
productivity, profitability, reduce post-harvest losses, and foster crop diversification and organic 
farming. Financial and technical support will be given, among others, in the following areas: (i) 
land  clearance  and  leveling  equipment  such  as  tractors,  laser  precision  land  levelers,  and 
ploughing equipment; (ii) planting equipment such as seed drills; (iii) small-scale on-farm irrigation 
such as ponds, drip and sprinkler systems; (iv) water storage and conservation facilities; (v) CEAT 
such  as  plastic  sheets,  shade/net  houses,  and  greenhouses;  and  (vi)  equipment  for  the 
application of agricultural inputs such as high quality seeds and planting material, bio-fertilizer, 
pesticides, herbicides and agricultural tools and implements.  
Interested lead farmers will be selected to partner with the  project in promotion of crop 
27. 
diversification and organic farming. In this context, any infrastructure and mechanized technology 
needed to establish and operate demonstration plots will be supported financially. Lead farmers 
will be incentivized through priority participation in trainings, study tours and field visits. Emphasis 
will be on promoting techniques to cope with impacts of climate change and reduce greenhouse 
gas  emissions  in  both  rice  and  vegetable  farming  systems.  Practices  such  as  (i)  greater  crop 
diversification  and  optimum  crop  rotation;  (ii)  the  timing  of  field  operations  based  on  better 
knowledge of climate changes; (iii) the improvement of soil quality and the judicious use of organic 
fertilizers; (iv) zero tillage to reduce carbon emissions; and (v) farm-based production and use of 
renewable energy. 
28. 
The  project  will  also  support  APGs  through  promotion  of  joint  activities  in  combined 
harvesting, and post-harvest crop handling to promote improved market access, prices, contract 
farming and value addition through small-scale agro processing, packaging and branding. The 
project  design  team,  together  with  PAFOs  and  DAFOs,  noted  the  need  for  provision  of 
mechanized services to individual farmers. The services include the following: (i) land leveling, 
seed planting, use of  combined harvesters; (ii) small-scale post-harvest handling infrastructure 
such as  collection sheds, washing and drying, grading and sorting, packaging, storage including 
cold  stores,  and  transport  including  refrigerated  trucks;  (iii)  joint  CEAT,  e.g.  greenhouses, 
hydroponics,  plastic coverings,  etc.;  (iv)  small  scale  organic  fertilizer  production;  and (v)  small 
scale agro processing, such as rice chips, pancakes, juices, and dried vegetables. Examples of 
APG joint agribusiness activity are illustrated in the following tables:

The SFS will provide support to agricultural production groups (APGs). There will be no 
scored selection criteria for APG applicants for the SFS. Applications (plus budget items within 
applications) will either be eligible or not eligible. Eligibility criteria include: 
(i) 
(ii) 
proposed  use  of  funds  is  eligible  and  amount  requested  is  not  more  than  the 
equivalent of US$1,000 for each member. The APG shall provide a comprehensive 
list of activities to be supported by the SFS, including an explanation of how the 
investment will help farmers to undertake CSA, grow higher quality crops and add-
value,  or  cope  with  the  impacts  of  climate  change  and  reduce  greenhouse  gas 
emissions.  
The type  and value  of  individual  budget  items will  be  listed. The  FME  team  will 
benchmark costs against the market while a technical sector expert within the FME 
will check that the items requested are relevant for the business plan purpose and 
are viable e.g. will there be sufficient utilization of equipment (either within the sub-
group, APG or outside the APG to make investment viable);

met  the  requirements  of  the  MAF  Ministerial  Decree  of  25  September  2014 
regarding agricultural producers’ groups; 
the APG should have, or be willing to open, a bank account with a registered FI

policy; 
APG members shall be primarily be involved in the cultivation of vegetables and/or 
rice;

public  private  community  partnerships  (PPCP),  and  in  particular  on  group 
formation and strengthening, provided by the project under outputs 2 and 3; 
confirmation  to  abide  by  the  terms  of  the  SFS  (e.g.  to  propose  loan  repayment 
terms for sub-groups of farmers who lend from the scheme). 
Subject to any agreed changes to the operations manual during an initial review by the 
30. 
FME upon startup, the steps in the SFS process are as shown in the figure below. 
21  Few APGs in Lao PDR have bank accounts at this stage, although as they are registered with PAFOs, this should 
be possible. 
78  
Appendix 1 
Figure 3: Steps in the SFS Process 
Grant  disbursement  will  be  made  directly  from  the  NPMO  to  grantees,  with  the  FME 
31. 
providing a verification function. 
32. 
Grant disbursement will be made in one lumpsum advance by the PPIU to the APG’s bank 
account,  according  to the  amount  in  the  grant  agreement.  It  will  then  become  the  APG’s  own 
assets  and  can  be  used  as  a  fund  for  investments  as  outlined  in  the  application.  Before 
disbursement is made, evidence of the 10% seed fund deposit in the APG bank account will be 
required.  
Depending  on  the  approved  application  (as  outlined  in  the  grant  implementation 
33. 
agreements) the APG will then use the fund for either (a) purchase of items to be owned by the 
group as a whole, but for use by members of the group (depending on the type of investment use 
may either be for free or on a fee basis – e.g. renting of equipment); or (b) on-lending to  sub-
groups of farmers who will then borrow the funds as a loan from the APG fund (for activities as 
outlined in the application), following signature of a loan agreement, and will collectively then have 
to repay the loan back to the APG at an interest rate and at terms as set out by the APG (which 
should be proposed as part of the grant application, and which should be no less than 5% per 
annum).  The  fund then becomes  a  revolving  fund  to  be  used  by  the  APG  in  perpetuity,  to  be 
reused for other sub-groups or the group as a whole. Loan agreements will be guaranteed, by 
legal document, by each member of each sub-group, witnessed by the chairman of the APG. If

one member of a sub-group cannot provide his/her loan repayment amount, the others must cover 
this. Nonpayment of loans (within a specific period as set-out by the APG) will result in the debtor 
sub-group  being  debarred  from  applying  for  and  receiving  further  loans  from  the  fund  (and 
potentially for utilizing group level assets – to be decided by the APG board). 
It should be noted that it is the APG or farmer sub-group’s responsibility to purchase the 
34. 
equipment or supplies for its activities. This will not be a project responsibility.  
Since no collateral is required upfront, disbursement of 100% of the grant poses a risk in 
35. 
case of misuse of funds. To mitigate this risk the PPIUs or DPIUs (with PAFO and DAFO staff) 
will monitor use of the fund (disbursements and repayments to the fund) as outlined in the GIA, 
and  provide  ongoing  support  (training,  etc).  They  will  be  trained  to  do  this  by  the  Agricultural 
Production Group  Development  Specialist  (part  of  the  FME). While  it  is  recognised  that  some 
investments may not have the desired outcome and that farmers may not be able to pay back 
loans, such events will not be penalized but regarded as lessons learned.  However, if there is 
any misuse of funds (e.g. not used for the intended purpose as set out in the application) then 
APGs will be penalised – they will be blacklisted by PAFOs (and PAFOs) for the receipt of future 
donor or government support, and their registration as a group may be cancelled. Legal recourse 
to get the grant money repaid will also be an option. 
To assist the PPIUs and DPIUs in their monitoring function, the grantee will be required to 
36. 
prepare brief quarterly progress reports (to be submitted to the DPIU). Training can be provided 
by the PPIUs and DPIUs on how to do this, while this will also be part of the training as mentioned 
above. Such reports will feed into the FME PPMS. 
37. 
Output  3:  Enabling  environment  for  climate-friendly  agribusiness  enhanced.  This 
activity will focus on support for formulation of climate-friendly agribusiness policies and standards 
and enabling environment for green finance.22 Key activities include: 
38. 
Activity 3.1 Formulating climate-friendly agribusiness policies and standards. In Lao PDR, 
both  MAF  and  MOIC  do  not  have  a  climate-friendly  policy  for  agribusiness.  Any  agribusiness 
policy must provide stability in the sector to encourage private investment, which includes green 
investment, and will consider both mitigation and adaptation opportunities and socially appropriate 
best practices. The policy formulation will involve (i) identification of measures to remove barriers 
for private sector investment in agribusiness and related activities; (ii) identification of investment 
strategies for  the  public sector to enhance  CSA;  (iii)  promotion  of the  development  of  climate-
friendly  infrastructure  so  that  Lao  PDR’s  agribusinesses  have  a  comparative  and  competitive 
advantage  with  their  regional  rivals;  and  (iv)  creation  of  institutional  and  legal  frameworks 
conducive  to  supporting  and  assisting  CSA,  particularly  with  respect  to  regulations,  taxes, 
business registration and the streamlining of licenses required and the multiplicity of government 
institutions involved in the sector.  
22  Green finance can be defined as financing of investments that provide environmental benefits in the broader context 
of environmentally sustainable development. These environmental benefits include, for example, reductions in air, 
water and land pollution, reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, improved energy efficiency while utilizing 
existing natural resources, as well as mitigation of and adaptation to  climate change and their co-benefits. Green 
finance  involves  efforts  to  internalize  environmental  externalities  and  adjust  risk  perceptions  in  order  to  boost 
environmental friendly investments and reduce environmentally harmful ones. Green finance covers a wide range of 
financial  institutions and  asset  classes,  and  includes both  public  and private  finance.  Green  finance  involves  the 
effective management of environmental risks across the financial system (Source: UNEP, September 2015). 
80  
Appendix 1 
The project will identify reforms required with the overall objective of easing the freedom 
39. 
to  do  business  and  to  improve  efficiencies  in  logistics  and  administration.  Integrating  climate 
change concerns into agribusiness policy at national level is critical to developing a strong and 
dynamic market-driven private agribusiness sector and a long-term agribusiness strategy with a 
climate-friendly  vision.  Activities  also  entail  working  with  MAF,  MOIC  and  MONRE  for 
mainstreaming  climate  change  in  policies,  particularly  to  conduct  studies  identifying  priority 
agricultural products with processing potential and prepare a comprehensive strategic action plan 
based on value chains. The study and the resulting strategic action plan will be submitted to MAF. 
40. 
Currently,  the  International  Standards  Organization  (ISO)  is  developing/enhancing  ISO 
14080 towards climate neutrality in different operations and ISO 26000 to consider climate change 
adaptation.  The  project  will  support  developing  climate-conscious  standards  for  agribusiness 
operations  aimed  at  climate  neutrality  and  effective  adaptation.  The  activities  may  be  broadly 
divided into two categories: (i) for standards that have been drafted already, a technical review 
followed by public consultation is needed to determine impact for the eventual endorsement by 
the government, in order that the standard can be a national standard with the Lao PDR Standard  
mark; and (ii) for the standards that are yet to be drafted, working groups will need to be formed 
to develop the first draft, followed by technical committees for the review of the drafts, followed 
by public consultation with the eventual endorsement by the government.  
For climate-conscious standards, most of the project activity may fall into category (ii); for 
41. 
example, standards for climate-resilient post-harvest infrastructure facilities (e.g., storage, milling, 
processing)  will  need  to  be  developed  to  guide  the  development  of  future  infrastructure.  The 
project will support activities related to certification and compliance that concerns climate change 
issues  and  human  health  and  welfare  in  line  with  corporate  social  responsibility  guidelines.  It 
includes support to GAP for vegetables to develop a LAO GAP standard, and organic production 
standards for both rice and vegetables. The project will support the working groups in specialized 
subjects including GAP, GMP, HACCP and organic certification. The project will support a human 
resource  development  program  for  government  staff  to  build  capacity  in  policy  and  standards 
development and elaboration, and link with the work on regulatory impact assessment, already 
supported by ADB.23 The project will also provide liaison support to ensure harmonized actions 
with the Sanitary and Phyto-sanitary (SPS) project. 
42. 
Recent assessments of the facilitation of safe trade in Lao PDR in respect of analytic and 
diagnostic capacity are still insufficient to conduct basic functions as demonstrated by the plant 
protection  center,  the  animal  health  laboratory,  and  the  Food  and  Drug  Control  Center.  No 
laboratory has ISO 17025 accreditation. Capacity for chemical analysis of food and agrochemicals 
must still be developed. Lack of staff and operational funding is a key constraint for the operation 
of laboratories and development of testing and analytical skills.24 The project will commission an 
in-depth  study  to  assess  and  analyze  the  country’s  requirements  laboratory  testing  and 
certification requirements to meet regional and international food safety requirements, together 
with  organic  food  certification  requirements  for  export,  under  the  mandate  of  the  Standards 
Division of the DOA. The study shall also identify the steps and facilitate getting certification.  
Land and access to land for agribusinesses is a major contemporary issue in Lao PDR.

development and making the move from subsistence farming to commercial agriculture. The Law 
on Lands determines the principles of land ownership, management, registration and certification, 
and the right of land use, and details the structure for land management in Lao PDR. Article 8 
establishes the National Land Management Authority, assigns to it the duties of coordination with 
sector ministries (Article 9) and spells out in greater detail its general rights and duties in Article 
10.25 Land categories are defined in Article 11 of the land law and individual sector ministries are 
given  responsibility  for  the  management  and  issuance  of  regulations  on  the  management, 
protection, development and use of those categories of land.26 Expected results from delivering 
this activity to be closely coordinated with MONRE, will include (i) an in-depth study on agricultural 
land  registration  and  titling  issues  affecting the agribusiness  sector, taking  into account recent 
work on this subject by donors and identifying gaps;27 and (ii) a pilot project introducing a land 
registration and titling model for rice and vegetable farmers in a selected project district. 
44. 
The policy studies and pilot modelling activities may be implemented by engaging short-
term experts through the PIC. The detailed terms of reference, budget estimate and study and/or 
modelling objectives shall be prepared by the PIC, subject to the review and approval of NPMO 
and  the  corresponding  technical  oversight  agency.  PTAC,  PCFC,  and/or  PSC  may  also  be 
consulted to address technical and financial issues. Studies, reports, roadmaps and/or strategic 
action plans shall be submitted to the concerned technical oversight department for no objection, 
then to  PTAC,  PCFC  and/or  PSC  if  needed, for review  and endorsement. In  all  cases,  a Lao-
translated version of the final documents will be produced.

Experts on trade standards and certifications will be engaged on a short-term basis by 
the  PIC  to  identify  gaps  and  intervention  requirement  to  help  the  enterprises  secure  export-

Activity  3.2  Promoting green finance  and  climate  risk  sharing  mechanisms. The  project 
will  support  creation  of  PPCPs  in  agribusiness  by  identifying  incentives  for  private  sector 
participation, enhancing ABEs’ access to finance, reducing risk aversion of commercial banks to 
financing the agribusiness sector; and reducing climate change risk to crop production through 
promoting crop insurance.  
To  achieve  the  PPCP  objectives,  the  project  will  support  dialog  between  public  and

discussion and promotion of the establishment of crop centric forums for each value chain (rice 
and vegetables). For key players within the scope of PPCP initiatives, two regional study tours 
will be supported with a maximum of 25 stakeholders to acquire a better knowledge of how a new 
green technology works, what is available, what market opportunities there may be for particular 
agricultural  products,  and  the  benchmarking  of  potential  Lao  PDR  PPCP  initiatives  with  those 
taking place in the region.  
48. 
PPCP projects should have the following features: (i) Eligible PPCP partners should be 
legal entities that have the capacity to engage successfully with small-scale farmers through their 
APGs and agro processors through their rice milling groups and vegetable packhouse operating 
groups, to increase output, productivity, quality and sustainability of the marketing of primarily, 
food  products,  and  to  integrate  the  agricultural  value  chain  through  backward  and  forward 
linkages; (ii) The range of potential PPCP partners should be defined in a broad and inclusive 
manner  covering  all  stakeholders  in  the  agriculture  sector,  and  identify  a  lead  PPCP  partner, 
eligible to enter contracts and manage funds, and a secondary partner(s); and (iii) Eligible PPCP 
activities should generally include a large proportion of small scale farmers. It is proposed that 
legally binding PPCP arrangements will be established for the export of rice and vegetables by 
the  end  of the  project.  A  single partnership  may cover  more  than  one  agricultural product  and 
value  chain,  and  individual  farmers  may  participate  in  more  than  one  PPCP  partnership. 
Examples of possible PPCP eligible activities may include: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
(v) 
(vi) 
production of improved planting material, including rehabilitation and/or expansion 
of existing nurseries, and the establishment of satellite nurseries; 
investments  in improved  agro  processing,  value  addition  trading  and  marketing, 
and storage facilities for quality management and environmental sustainability; 
training  to  improve  farmers’  financial  literacy,  business  and  farm  management 
skills; 
capacity  building  of  market  driven  APGs  or  cooperatives  in  management  skills, 
record keeping, and participatory and democratic group processes; 
training in sustainable and certified production and processing systems including 
support to interested APGs producing certified food products; and 
facilitation of crop diversification activities to reduce one crop dependence and risk 
and contribute to improved food and nutrition security. 
49. 
Ineligible PPCP activities may cover: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
(v) 
activities that do not comply with ADB environmental and social safeguard policies;  
overhead  and  management  costs  of  PPCP  partners  which  are  not  directly  and 
exclusively linked to the PPCP investment project;  
funding of activities through third parties that are not part of the PPCP partnership 
agreement or not formally linked with the lead partner; 
activities that focus on the import of foodstuffs into Lao PDR; and 
retroactive financing of activities already undertaken.

instruments such as crop insurance is extremely low to nonexistent. The project aims to create 
an enabling environment for crop insurance in the target provinces by examining financial and 
regulatory constraints specific to target provinces in developing the insurance market and identify 
mechanisms to overcome such barriers. A final comprehensive report, including a strategic action 
plan, shall be submitted to MAF, subject to NPMO’s review and recommendations. 
Appendix 1       83 
The project will provide  capacity building assistance to the financial sector to evaluate 
51. 
climate risks and recognize lending opportunities for banks and financial institutions for climate-
friendly investments. At least 50 staff, 30% of which are women, from financial institutions will be 
trained in CSA lending and green finance. The project, through a training and capacity building 
program,  comprising  awareness  raising  and  promotional  activities  and  field  visits  to  green 
financing  projects,  will  build  the  capacity  of  banks  and  financial  institutions  to  evaluate  loans 
against  environmental  and  climate  risk  screening  criteria,  by  integrating  them  into  the  current 
credit  application  process  and  reporting  procedures,  and  to  recognize  both  mitigation  and 
adaptation opportunities. It will also strengthen linkages, trust and shared understanding between 
lenders,  recipients,  and  input  and  services  providers  regarding  climate-friendly  agribusiness 
investment  opportunities.  It  is  expected  that  the  green  finance  mechanism  will  be  sustainable 
even at the end of the project with the strengthening of the capacity of the financial institutions, 
not just the APGs.

FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT ENTITY (Package CS 02) 
57. 
Objectives  of  the  Assignment. To  administer  the  matching grant scheme (MGS)  and 
smallholder  financing  scheme  (SFS).  The  primary  tasks  of  the  FME  are  set  out  in  the  MGS 
Operations Manual. 
58. 
In addition to administering the MGS, a secondary function of the FME will be to organize 
a training and awareness raising program to financial institutions (FIs), predominantly banks. The 
rationale being that in the medium to long term it is envisaged that commercial FIs will provide 
increased  levels  of  credit  for  agribusinesses  against  terms  which  are  attractive  enough  for 
agribusinesses  to  invest,  negating  the  need  for  a  MGS.  This  will  require  a  change  in  the  risk 
averse nature of FIs in loaning to agribusiness.28 This can be partly overcome by providing training 
to  selected  FIs  in  assessing  the  risk  of  agribusiness  lending  (credit  risk  and  business  plan 
analysis); in raising awareness and building capacity on new financial products (including green 
finance  products)  that  can  be  offered  to  the  agribusiness  sector;  and  in  providing  training  to 
agribusinesses and farmers groups on applying for bank loans or other financial products, and in 
financial management.29 The range of training topics to be provided by the FME should include 
regional or global best practices in agribusiness lending, credit assessment, credit risk mitigation, 
available financial products, and operation risk mitigation. Training to commercial bank staff will 
be conducted by an international green finance and agricultural credit analysis specialist, although 
joint  training  with  those  responsible  for  training  agribusinesses  and  APGs  in  business  plan 
preparation  (and  for  APGs  financial  management)  could  be  envisaged  to  ensure  integration 
between credit suppliers and users.30 Aside from knowledge transmission, the training can be a 
venue for trainees to make business contacts. Consultants will be based in Vientiane although 
travel to the project provinces will be required. 
59. 
Qualifications of the firm. The firm, or consortium of firms, will have recent demonstrable 
experience  in  administering  and  managing  matching  grant  schemes  (with  experience  in  the 
management of related challenge funds also beneficial); analyzing agribusiness plans; providing 
training  on  business  plan  preparation  (including  preparing  financial  projections);  undertaking 
monitoring  (including  fiduciary  oversight)  of  grant  projects;  providing  training  to  financial 
institutions  on  agribusiness  credit  risk  (and  business  plan)  analysis;  knowledge  of  a  variety  of 
financial  products  appropriate  to  agribusinesses  (preferably  including  green  financing). 
Knowledge  of  the  financial  (banking)  and  agribusiness  sector  in  Lao  PDR  is  an  advantage, 
including agribusiness technology and infrastructure needs.

Sector Specialist – 1 international (3 pm) and 1 national (4 pm) 
63. 
Qualifications: Since it is not possible to determine requirements at this stage, which may 
be very specific, and require inputs of only a few hours or days, this may be an unallocated budget 
line to be drawn down as needed. CVs and TORs (including number of days input and expected 
outputs) will be presented to the NPMO for approval. However, since support may be required 
within a short time period the FME should try and identify types of expertise needed in advance 
(even if not eventually used) and submit to the NPMO for early approval. 
Tasks: The sector specialist pool will be utilized, as required by the core team, to help 
64. 
assess concept notes and applications. For example: 
•

modelling  preferred),  and  in  agricultural  value  chains,  preferably  for  rice  and  vegetables.  One 
person may not possess all these skills so the tenderer will propose the most appropriate mix of 
staff. 
66. 
Tasks:  The  business  analysts  will  be  the  main  interlink  with  applicants  and  thereafter 
grantees. They will be involved in all key steps of the MGS process. During concept note and

Background of the Project:  
91. 
Please refer to Annex E.1 (attached to this TOR), the following information: 
a.  background of project 
b.  project description 
c.  executing and implementing Agencies (EA/IAs) 
16. 
Accounting and Financial Management  
If  the  project  has  a  financial  management  manual,  mention  it  here,  please  include  as

Annex E.2, attached to this TOR for the content of the Financial Management Manual. 
17. 
Objective 
93. 
The objective of audit assignment is to ensure that ADB, on an annual basis, is provided 
with  the  following  reliable,  comprehensive,  and  timely  information:  (i)  audited  project  financial 
statements  (APFS);  (ii)  specific  additional  audit  opinions;  and  (iii)  management  letter.  ADB 
requires these documents to be provided in English. 
18. 
Scope of Work 32 
A. APFSs: Financial Statement to be audited:33  
94. 
The EAs/IAs are responsible for preparation and consolidation of APFSs. The Auditor is 
to  express  an  opinion  on  the  accompanying  statements  based  on  the  audit.  The  accounting 
standard adopted should be specified in the annual audited financial statements. The content of 
the financial statements is expected to include, as a minimum (refer to Annex E.3, attached to 
this TOR for a sample list of requested document): 
a. 
A Summary of all sources of funds, as well as expenditures against a classification 
system that is responsive to the project’s objectives both for the current fiscal year 
and cumulative to date, showing ADB funds and counterpart fund and funding from 
other sources separately; 
32 The auditor should be sufficiently clear with the scope of the audit to properly define what is expected of the auditor. 
The EA should not restrict the audit procedures or the techniques the auditor may wish to use to form an opinion. 
The TOR will not generally have to be customized to a particular audit situation. The list of issues outlined in the 
TOR is not exhaustive, nor should all matters be addressed in every project. The scope and detail of an audit are 
likely to be unique for each project. 
33 The form of the APFS and supporting documentation that will be supplied to the auditor, and on which they are to 
give  an  opinion  and  a  report,  should  be  specified.  In  practice,  the  form  and  content  of  APFS  will  vary  among 
countries and projects. For instance, the APFS may comprise a Statement of Receipts and Payments only on project 
transactions. Other schedules may include cumulative work-in-progress, assets and inventories, and summarized 
bank reconciliation. The estimated time for providing these documents to the auditor should be stated (e.g., one 
month after financial year-end). This schedule helps the auditee and the auditor plan for the financial statements-
preparation and the audit process. 
Appendix 3       121 
b. 
c. 
d. 
A Summary of Expenditures (SOE) shown under the main project components and 
by main categories of expenditures, both for the current fiscal year and accumulated 
to date;  
A Balance Sheet showing Accumulated Funds of the Project, bank balances, other 
assets of the project, and liabilities, if any; and 
Supporting  schedules  to  the  financial  statements  which  at  least  include:  (i)  a 
reconciliation of the amounts shown as received by the project from the ADB with 
those  shown  as  being  disbursed  by  ADB;  and  (ii)  SOE  procedure  (if  applicable) 
listing  individual  SOE  withdrawal  applications  by  specific  reference  number  and 
amount.  
95. 
In addition to the audit of the project financial statements, the auditor is required to audit 
all SOEs as the basis for the submission of the withdrawal applications to ADB. The auditor should 
apply such tests and controls as the Auditor considers necessary under the circumstances. These 
expenditures should be carefully compared for project eligibility with the relevant grant agreement 
for guidance when considered necessary. Where ineligible expenditures are identified as having 
been  included  in  withdrawal  applications  and  reimbursed  against,  these  should  be  separately 
noted  by  the  Auditor.  A  note  to  the  Project  Financial  Statements  should  be  a  schedule  listing 
individual  SOE  withdrawal  applications  by  specific  reference  number  and  amount.  The  total 
withdrawals  under  the  SOE  procedure  should  be  part  of  the  overall  reconciliation  of  ADB 
disbursements described above. 
96. 
Advance Account/Sub Account statement showing movement and reconciliation with the 
bank statements. The Auditor is also required to audit the activities of the Advance Accounts/Sub 
Accounts associated with the Project that usually comprise of: 
a.  Deposits and replenishments received from ADB; 
b. 
c. 
Payments substantiated by withdrawal applications; 
Interest that may be earned from the balances and which belong to the Recipient; 
and 
The remaining balances at the end of each fiscal year. 
d. 
The Auditor must form an opinion as to the degree of compliance with ADB’s procedures 
97. 
and the balance of the EAs at year-end. The audit should examine the eligibility and correctness 
of financial transactions during the period under review and fund balances at the end of such a 
period,  the  operation  and  use  of  the  IAs  in  accordance  with  the  financing  agreement,  and  the 
adequacy of internal controls for this type of disbursement mechanism. 
98. 
The Accounting Policies adopted and Explanatory notes. A Management Assertion that 
ADB funds have been expended in accordance with the intended purposes.  Request for form of 
Annual Project Financial Statements (extracted from PAI 5.07 revised on Jun.2012) including, but 
not limited to: 
a. 
b. 
Annual  project  financial  statements  should  normally  be  presented  in  the  local 
currency,  with  the  basis  for  conversion  of  any  foreign  exchange  transactions  or 
commitments explicitly stated. 
The annual project financial statements should be presented in the English language 
and  should  reflect  the  operations  supported  by  ADB  financing,  including  ADB-
administered funds. 
122   Appendix 3 
c. 
d. 
e. 
f. 
g. 
h. 
The project expenditures should be presented following the expenditure categories 
contained in the legal agreement and/or the PAM, and revisions thereto. 
The annual project financial statements should include comparative figures for the 
preceding reporting year and cumulative figures from the grant effectiveness date to 
the end of the current reporting year. For projects that receive funding from other 
sources, the annual project financial statements should include all sources of funds 
(both ADB-provided and otherwise). 
The  accompanying  Notes  to  Financial  Statements  should  provide  sufficient 
explanation  and  information  on  the  financials  in  narrative  form  or  appropriate 
supporting schedules, including description of key financial reporting policies. 
For projects where separate and distinct components are being administered by the 
EA  and/or  several  implementing  agencies  (IAs)  each  agency  should  prepare 
separate project financial statements reporting on the funds they are administering.  
Financial statements should be prepared in accordance with accrual based financial 
reporting standards.  
The agreed financial reporting and auditing arrangements will be set forth in the legal 
agreement and detailed in the PAM.  
B. Specific additional audit opinions: 
99. 
The auditors are engaged to provide an independent and objective opinion on whether 
the financial statements present a true and fair view, in all material respects, in accordance with 
the applicable financial reporting framework. The auditors should also form an opinion from the 
audit evidence obtained, and clearly express that opinion through a written report. The auditor’s 
opinion is necessary to establish the credibility of the project financial statements. The objective 
of the audit of the annual project financial statements (APFS) is to enable the auditor to provide 
opinion(s) covering:  
a.  Use  of  grant  proceeds  -  to  confirm  whether  the  recipient  or  EA  has  utilized  all 
proceeds of ADB’s grant only for purposes of the project;  
b.  Compliance with financial  covenants:  (Please refer  to:  Annex  E.4  attached  to  this 
TOR,  where  applicable)  -  to  confirm  or  otherwise,  that  the  recipient  or  EA  was  in 
compliance with the financial covenants of the grant agreement. 
c.  Compliance  with  the  advance  fund  procedure  which  includes  advance  account(s) 
and  sub-account(s)  (where  applicable)  -  to  confirm  or  otherwise,  whether  the 
advance  account  (and  sub-accounts)  gives  a  true  and  fair  view  of  the  receipts 
collected and payments made and supports advance and sub-account- liquidations 
and replenishments during the year. 
d.  Compliance with the Statement of Expenditure (SOE) procedures (where applicable) 
-  to  confirm  or  otherwise,  whether  adequate  supporting  documentation  has  been 
maintained  to  support  claims  to  ADB  for  reimbursement  of  expenditures  incurred 
and that the expenditures are eligible for financing under the grant agreement. 
C. Management Letter 
100.  ADB requires the EA/IAs to provide a copy to provide a copy of the auditor’s Management 
Letter, together with the APFS/AFS. At the minimum, this should include: 
Appendix 3       123 
a. 
b. 
c. 
d. 
e. 
a general overview of the internal control systems of the project and the EA, or an 
opinion on the management systems; 
an identification of material deficiencies or weaknesses in the project or EA/IAs’ 
internal controls over financial reporting or on the overall system of internal control; 
the auditor’s recommendations for improvements or for rectification of identified 
weaknesses; 
the client’s comments on the findings and recommendations; and 
follow-up action/s or status to previously identified issues and findings, if any. 
101. 
In  cases  where  a  management  letter  is  not  received  for  the  entity  as  a  whole,  then  a 
management letter covering internal controls and procedures associated with the preparation of 
the  project  financial  statements  is  required  and  should  be  submitted  together  with  the  APFS. 
When significant weaknesses come to attention of the auditor during the course of audit that are 
not reflected in the audit opinion, they should be reported in a management letter as follows; 
a. 
b. 
c. 
d. 
A  description  of  specific  internal  control  weaknesses  noted  in  the  financial 
management  and  recommendations  to  resolve/eliminate  the  internal  control 
weaknesses; 
Inappropriate accounting policies and practices and effectiveness of the accounting 
records system in providing useful and timely information for proper management of 
the program/and project; 
Issues  regarding  general  compliance  with  broad  covenants  on  each  financing 
agreement  and  give  comments,  if  any,  on  internal  and  external  matters  affecting 
such compliance; 
e.  Report significant matters raised in previous reports which have not been dealt with 
f. 
g. 
effectively 
Any other matters that the auditor considers should be brought to the attention of the 
recipient. 
A time bound actions plan that have been agreed with the management to address 
each of the individual issue, including date of completion, and person(s) responsible 
for implementation of the action plan. 
A. 
Locations to be Audited  
102.  ADB  funded  projects  in  Lao PDR  often  include central  level,  provincial  and even  lower 
levels. The auditors may have to travel to all lower levels to do the audit. If it is the case, the TOR 
should specify the provinces where Auditors must visit.  
B. 
Phasing of the Audit 
103.  The TORs must specific in the following table when the report will be submitted in draft 
and in final format: 
Month of fiscal year (FY) and report submission 
Period 
FY start  
FY End 
Report 
Submission 
Remarks

124   Appendix 3 
104.  Although the auditing firm will be contracted for the mentioned audit phases (maximum 
three years per contract), it must submit the financial proposal in US$ in a format indicating the 
amount for each financial year independently: (i) If performance is not satisfactory in one year 
then  the  client  will  not  be  bound  for  subsequent  year’s  audits;  and  (ii)  If  the  performance  is 
satisfactory, the auditor may participate in bidding process for the next fiscal years, but the total 
assignment should be up to 6 years for one project.  
C. 
Auditing Requirements: 
105.  The  audit  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  International  Standards  of  Auditing 
including:  
a. 
b. 
c. 
d. 
e. 
planning and conducting the audit in accordance with a risk-based framework with 
a detailed audit work program which is sufficiently extensive in its coverage of the 
project’s FS to support the opinion given. 
the auditor will gather evidence and prepare working papers to properly documents 
the evidence seen in support of the opinion given, sufficient audit evidence will be 
gathered  to  substantiate  in  all  material  respects  the  accuracy  of  the  information 
contained in supporting schedules attached to the feasibility. 
the auditor will review and evaluate the system of internal controls in effect, including 
internal audit procedures, to determine the degree of reliance that may be placed 
upon them and to determine the extent of testing of actual transactions needed to 
assure the auditor of the accuracy of the accounting records,  
the audit coverage will consider the risk of material misstatement(s) as a result of 
fraud  or  error. The  audit  program  should  include  procedures that  are  designed to 
provide reasonable assurance that material misstatements (if any) are detected.  
the  auditor  must  obtain  an  understanding  of  the  design  and  operation  of  internal 
control  over  compliance  with  requirements  that  could  have  a  direct  and  material 
financial  effect  on  the  funding  agreements.  The  auditor’s  work  in  this  area  is  in 
addition to the consideration of internal control over financial reporting that is part of 
the FS audit. Specifically, the auditor must obtain an understanding of the internal 
control  over  compliance  that  is  sufficient  to  plan  the  audit  to  support  a  low 
assessment  level  of  control  risk  for  donor  program.  The  auditor  needs  to  test  the 
internal control unless the internal control is likely to be ineffective in preventing or 
detecting noncompliance.  
106.  The auditor need also review the following:   
a. 
ADB  financing  (and  expand  to  all  external  financing  where  ADB  is  not  the  only 
financier) shall be used in accordance with the conditions of the relevant financing 
agreement, with due attention to economy and efficiency, and only for the purposes 
for which the financing was provided, as detailed in the supporting documents  
b.  Counterpart funds shall be provided and used in accordance with the relevant grant 
agreements, with due attention to economy and efficiency, and only for the purposes 
for which they were provided;  
c.  Goods,  works  and  services  financed  shall  be  procured  in  accordance  with  the 
relevant financing agreements including specific provisions of the ADB Procurement 
Policies and Procedures and relevant laws of Recipient. However, in case there are 
Appendix 3       125 
d. 
e. 
f. 
conflicts between ADB policies and procedures with Recipient’s relevant laws, ADB 
policies and procedures will prevail. Fixed assets procured by all financiers shall be 
reviewed;  
The expenditures submitted to ADB shall be eligible for financing and all necessary 
supporting documents, records, and accounts in support of credit withdrawals have 
been adequately maintained with clear linkages between the books of account and 
reports presented to ADB; 
Funds  disbursed  through  SOEs  shall  be  utilized  for  the  purposed  defined  in  the 
funding  agreements.  Where  ineligible  expenditures  are  identified  as  having  been 
included  in  withdrawal  applications  and  reimbursed  against,  these  should  be 
separately noted by the auditor;  
Advance Accounts and sub-accounts, (if used) shall be maintained in accordance 
with the provisions of the relevant financing agreements and funds disbursed out of 
the account were used only for the purpose intended in the financing agreement and 
other supporting documents. 
D. 
Accounting Policies and Changes  
107.  The auditor should comment on the project’s accounting policies and confirm the extent 
to which the agreed project accounting policies have been applied. In particular, the auditor should 
note  the  impact  on the APFS  arising from  any material  deviations from the  agreed  accounting 
standards. The auditor should also comment on any accounting policy changes, either during a 
financial year, or from one year to another. 
E. 
Compliance with laws, regulations and funding agreements  
108.  The  auditor  should  be  aware  of  the  unique  characteristics  of  the  compliance  auditing 
environment. Governments and not-for-profit organizations differ from commercial enterprises in 
that  they  may  be  subject  to  diverse  compliance  requirements  including  its  compliance  with 
financial covenants and financial assurances.  
109.  Management  is  responsible  for  ensuring  compliance  with  relevant  laws,  regulation  and 
funding  agreements.  That  responsibility  encompasses  the  identification  of  applicable  laws, 
regulations and funding agreements and the establishment of internal control designed to provide 
reasonable  assurance  that  the  auditee  complies  with  those  laws,  regulations  and  funding 
agreements. 
110. 
In addition to the opinion on the FSs, the auditor should provide an opinion on whether 
the auditee complied with laws, regulations and provision of contracts and funding agreements 
that  have a direct  and material financial  effect on  the  project financial statements. The  auditor 
should prepare a report with separate schedule of findings and questioned costs. The scope of 
the  audit  should  also  refer  to  compliance  with  the  Procurement  procedures  as  set  out  in  the 
funding agreements.  
F. 
Responsibility to Consider Fraud in an Audit  
111.  The primary responsibility for the prevention and detection of fraud rests with both those 
charged with governance of the entity and with management. It is important that management, 
with  the  oversight  of  those  charged  with  governance,  place  a  strong  emphasis  on  fraud 
prevention, which may reduce opportunities for fraud to take place, and fraud deterrence, which 
126   Appendix 3 
could  persuade  individuals  not  to  commit  fraud  because  of  the  likelihood  of  detection  and 
punishment.  It  is  the  responsibility  of  those  charged  with  governance  of  the  entity  to  ensure, 
through  oversight  of  management,  that  the  entity  establishes  and maintains  internal  control  to 
provide  reasonable  assurance  with  regard  to reliability  of financial  reporting,  effectiveness  and 
efficiency  of  operations  and  compliance  with  applicable  laws,  regulations  and  funding 
agreements. To do that, management is responsible for establishing a control environment and 
maintains policies and procedures to assist in achieving the objectives of ensuring the orderly and 
efficient conduct of the entity’s operation.  
112.  Therefore, in order to ensure that those assertions are addressed in the audit of the entity, 
it  is  important  that  auditors  must  follow  International  Standards  of  Auditing  (ISA  240)  “The 
Auditor’s Responsibility to consider Fraud in an Audit of Financial Statements. 
G. 
Audit Report 
113.  The  auditor  should  become  familiar  with  the  following  documents:  Guideline  for  the 
financial governance and management of investment projects financed by the Asian Development 
Bank;  and  the  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook.  The  Auditor’s  reports  on  the  projects  financial 
statements should be prepared in 08 copies (04 in English and 04 in  Lao)34 and mentions the 
following matters:  
a.  A title identifying the person or persons to whom the report is addressed; 
b.  An introductory paragraph identifying the financial statements audited; 
c.  Separate  sections,  appropriately  headed  dealing  with  respective  responsibilities  of 
directors (or equivalent persons), 
d.  The basis of the Auditor’s opinion, 
e.  The Auditor’s opinion on the financial statements, SOEs and IAs/SAs; 
f.  The manuscript or printed signature of the Auditor; and 
g.  The date of the Auditor's report. 
114.  The audit report is required to include separate audit opinions on the Financial Statements 
(as described in part D. the Scope). This would include at least the following: 
a.

e. 
f. 
g. 
the audit report will state the purpose of the report and its intended use, 
the audit report will state which/whose generally accepted accounting standards have 
been applied and indicate the effect of any deviations from those standards, 
the audit report will state that the audit was conducted in accordance with ISAs, 
the audit opinion will cover the current period, 
the audit opinion will state whether or not the financial statements presents fairly in 
accordance with the adopted accounting policies for the project and that the funds 
were utilized for the purposes defined by the funding agreements, 
the audit opinion will cover in all material respects the supporting schedules, 
the auditor should provide an opinion on whether the Project complied with applicable 
laws, regulations and the Procurement procedures and other provisions of the funding 
agreements that have a direct and material financial effect on the Project’s financial 
report, 
34 The auditing firm must take note that audited financial statements, audit report and the management letter prepared 
by  the  Auditor,  should be  received by  ADB  no  later  than six  months  after  the end  of  the  accounting period  (ie., 
normally no later than June 30). The Auditor should therefore submit, on a timely basis, audit report, management 
letter and the relevant documentation to the EAs/IAs to meet this requirement.  The EAs/IAs will be responsible for 
forwarding two copies of the audited project financial statements, audit report and management letter to the ADB.

h. 
the  auditor  should  provide  an  opinion  on  the  effectiveness  of  internal  control  over 
compliance with requirements that could have a direct and material financial effect on 
the financial statements as well as internal control over financial reporting. 
H. 
Available Information and Services to be Provided to the Auditor 
115.  Please refer to Annex E.3 attached to this TOR for a sample list of requested documents 
by Auditor. These include: 
a.  The auditor should have access to all legal documents, correspondences, and any 
other information associated with the project and deemed necessary by the auditor. 
The  auditor  will  also  obtain  confirmation  of  amounts  disbursed  and  outstanding  at 
ADB.  Available information  should include copies  of  the  relevant:  project  appraisal 
document; 
financial  management  assessment  reports; 
supervision mission reports and implementation status reports. 
financing  agreement; 
b.  The  Auditor  shall  have  the  right  of  access  to  banks  and  depositories,  consultants, 
contractors and other persons or firms engaged by the project. In case access has 
been restricted, the auditor must note this in the management letter.  
c.  ADB can request access to the auditors unedited audit working papers. If necessary, 
the auditing company can be requested, free of charge, to participate in a wrap-up 
session for  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF),  the  EA/IAs  and  ADB to share  common 
findings across projects being audited and provide recommendations for addressing 
bottlenecks in preparation for the next audit. 
I. 
Services to be Provided to the Auditor 
116.  The  following  services  will  be  provided  by  the  EA/IAs  without  cost  to  the  Auditor.  The 
NPMO  should  coordinate  with the  EA/IAs  and the Auditor  to  ensure  the following  services  are 
adequately and timely provided to the Auditor: 
a.  Data:  Provide  the  Auditor  with  access  to  all  available  data,  information,  legal 
documents, correspondence and any other information considered necessary by the 
Auditor  and  shall  be returned at  the  completion of the  assignment  or  earlier,  or  as 
may be requested by the EA/IAs. 
b.  Access: The NPMO and the IAs will arrange for access by the Auditor to the sites 
which the Auditor deems necessary to visit and conduct investigations in connection 
with performing their duties. Access to the key officials in the Government, the project 
provinces and agencies concerned with subjects related to the assignment will also 
be arranged by the EA/IAs, as appropriate. 
J.

Internal control (IC) 
1. 
IC Objectives: 
The  IC  forms  part  of  the  financial  and  accounting  policies  for  the  management  of  the 
6. 
project. The objectives of the internal controls are to: 
(i) 
ensure  adherence 
guidelines, project policies and procedures; 
to  Government’s  and  donors'  regulations  and 
Appendix 3       133 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
(v) 
achieve clear and transparent financial practices; 
promote operational efficiency; 
provide controls to safeguard the project assets; and 
facilitate the early detection of errors and problems. 
2. 
Internal  control  principles:  The  basic  principles  of the  internal  controls are  as 
follows: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
(v) 
(vi) 
(vii) 
(viii) 
monitoring, checking and approving, by an upper level, of expenditures and 
procurements executed by the lower level; 
defining  responsibilities  of  project  staff  commensurate  with  position  and 
level of authority; 
separating specific responsibilities of staff; 
using appropriate method to ensure proper custody of assets; 
ensuring full and appropriate documentation; 
using  internal  procedures  for  cross-checking  of  accounts,  payments  and 
transaction; 
entries for timely detection of errors; and 
preparing annual inventory of assets. 
3. 
IC  requirements:  Key  internal  controls  to  be  implemented  by  PCU/PMU  must 
satisfy the below requirements: 
•  Competent and Reliable Personnel: The internal control system relies on the people 
running it. Employees should be adequately trained and properly supervised to enable 
them to carry out their duties and responsibilities effectively. 
•  Separation  of  Functional  Responsibilities:  A  person  should  not  have  complete 
control of a transaction from beginning to end. There should be clear understanding 
as to who will approve, what is to be approved and the limitations of authorization. The 
approving officers should not have responsibility for posting or the ability to change 
accounting records. 
•  Assignment  of  Responsibility  for  Every  Function:  Employee  responsibilities 
should be clearly defined to avoid overlapping or unassigned areas of responsibility 
(e.g. an organization chart should be prepared). Staff must know their responsibilities 
and whom they report to. 
•  Separation  of  Asset  Custodianship  and  Accounting:  The  accounting  function 
should be separated from the custody of assets (e.g. an employee who is entrusted to 
receive cash should not have access to the cash journals or ledgers). 
•  Security Measures: Techniques, procedures and measures should be employed to 
protect assets and ensure reliable accounting data and reports (e.g. use of mechanical 
devices  such  as  vaults  and  cash  registers;  use  of  control  accounts  and  subsidiary 
ledgers). 
•  Supervision: Internal regulations should include the supervision of staff. For example, 
the  supervision  of  the  director  or  manager  of  a  DPIU  for  example  on  setting  up  of 
annual estimated expenditures, approving of the annual reports, or the supervision of 
134   Appendix 3 
chief  accountant  to  the  process  of  setting,  recording  of  transactions  made  by 
assistants, and the preparation of financial statements. 
•  Regular Independent Review: Internal auditors should regularly review and evaluate 
the  system  of  internal  controls  to  determine  whether  it  is  functioning  effectively  as 
planned (e.g. internal auditors' findings and recommendations should be submitted to 
senior management for action). 
•  Control  of  Transactions:  Every  transaction  should  be  authorized,  approved, 
executed and recorded according to prescribed procedures (e.g. staff are not free to 
procure without the approval of the manager). 
•  Serially  Numbered  Documents:  Organization  documents  should  be  serially 
numbered to check completeness of transactions (e.g. checks, invoices and vouchers 
should be serially numbered). 
•  Sequencing:  Accounting  control  system  should  be  set  up  in  such  a  manner  that 
proper  sequencing  is  followed  with  regards  to  payments,  posting  of  transactions  to 
ledgers  etc.  For  example,  payments  should  not  be  authorized  or  made  before  the 
goods or services for which the payment relates to has been received by the project. 
•  Duration  of  documentation  archiving:  Full  documentation  of  project  transactions 
will be managed and recorded in accordance with existing regulations. The records 
should be kept for 10 years in good condition to avoid damage and ensure easy access 
when needed. Document disposal (if necessary) shall be done with prior approval of 
competent authority. 
4. 
Content of IC: 
7. 
Must  ensure that  the  FMM  covers  all  important  IC matters:  such  as  cash  control,  bank 
account control, procurement, assets management, contract management and receivables, and 
payables etc.  
5. 
IC system:  
The  auditor  shall  assess  the  adequacy  of  the  project  financial  management  systems, 
8. 
including internal controls. The assessment includes whether:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Proper  authorizations  are  obtained  and  documented  before  transactions  are 
entered into;  
Accuracy and consistency are achieved in recording, classifying, summarizing and 
reporting transactions;  
Reconciliations with internal and external evidence are performed on a timely basis 
by the appropriate level of management;  
Balances can be confirmed with external parties;  
Adequate documentation and an audit trail is retained to support transactions;  
Transactions are allowable under the agreements governing the project; 
Errors  and  omissions  are  detected  and  corrected  by  project  personnel  in  the 
normal course of their duties, and management is informed of recurring problems 
or weaknesses; 
• 
• 
Management  does  not  override  the  normal  procedures  and  the  internal  control 
structure; and  
Assets are property accounted for, safeguarded and can be physically inspected.

Appendix 3  
F. 
VARIETY DEVELOPMENT (Package CS 05)  
130.  Lao PDR is one of the most vulnerable countries in the world to climate change. Agriculture 
sector is one of the most vulnerable sectors to such impacts. The climate change events reflected 
in terms of increased frequencies of temperature extremes, frequent droughts, and floods have 
already  started  affecting  agricultural  production  and  productivity  and  particularly  more  so  in 
marginal or low input environments like Lao PDR. 
131.  The climate-friendly agribusiness value chains sector project aims to support the National 
Agriculture  Forestry  Research  Institute  (NAFRI)  in  production  and  multiplication  of  climate-
resilient  varieties  of  rice  and  vegetables.  In  addition,  assistance  will  be  provided  to  NAFRI  to 
develop a commercialization program with recommendations on the legal framework to develop 
intellectual property rights and partial cost recovery for the institution.  
132.  The climate-resilient  traits  to  be  selected  in  new  varieties  shall  include  shorter  maturity 
duration,  tolerance  to  drought,  tolerance  to  high  temperature,  tolerance  to  prolonged  flooding, 
anaerobic germination, as well as traits supporting better adaptation to water saving cultivation 
practices-  dry  direct  seeding  and  alternate  wetting  and  drying.  This  will  not  be  a  basic  plant 
breeding  program  which  will  take  10  years  to  develop.  Instead,  the  focus  would  be  on  testing 
available climate-resilient lines within a 5-year program that includes continued selection, agro-
climatic  adaptation,  climate-resilient  trait  evaluations,  yield  comparisons  and  farmer  and 
processor  evaluation.  Ensuring  the  availability  of  quality  seed  of  climate-resilient  varieties  in 
adequate quantity at right time poses greater challenge rather than production per se. 
133.  The project will also support large scale seed multiplication of climate-resilient varieties in 
target  provinces  and  distribution  of  quality  seed  to  farmers.  For  example,  new  rice  varieties 
suitable for direct seeding, and for alternate wetting and drying technologies will be demonstrated 
together  with  the  full  technology  package  on  about  100  hectares  in  each  target  province.  The 
project will recommend standards for seed certification procedures for different grades of seed, 
and seed certification procedures for the approval of and implementation by the government. 
134.  By 2024, it is expected that at least two climate-resilient varieties of rice and vegetables 
would be released for commercial production; and that NAFRI would be able to achieve partial 
cost recovery in variety  development and foundation seed supply with the corresponding legal 
framework in place. The project will develop seed quality standards, seed certification standards 
for different classes of seeds for the four crops and maintain such standards in the quality seed 
production in the current project.   
135.  The  scope  of  work  also  covers  the  development  and  dissemination  of  climate  smart 
agriculture  (CSA)  practices  including  improved  land-water-nutrient  management  and  crop 
establishment practices. The work includes dissemination of mechanized cultivation practices that 
have  reduced  risk  and  drudgery  and generate  avenues  for  employment  for  youth  and  women 
farmers. The project will work closely with  NAFRI and other key institutions as well as private-
sector  partners  for  the  deployment  of  the  climate-resilient  varieties  and  technology  of  different 
crops.  In  addition,  the  work  includes  efforts  to  reduce  postharvest  losses  during  harvesting, 
drying,  storage,  and processing through  implementation of  modernized  post-harvest  practices, 
capacity development and training on postharvest technology, and the development of linkages 
between the public and private sector. 
136.  An international research institution of high repute will be recruited to deliver the above 
services. Based on assessment of various institutions in the region focusing on development and 
Appendix 3       141 
deployment  of  climate-resilient  varieties,  and  substantial  contributions  made  so  far  on  climate 
smart agriculture in various countries including Lao PDR, it is proposed to select the International 
Rice Research Institute (IRRI) to deliver the above services.  The detailed terms of reference will 
be developed by NAFRI with cooperation from project implementation consultants during the first 
year of project implementation after assessing needs of target crops in target provinces.  
137. 
IRRI has been working with Lao PDR on crops and climate change research. The Institute 
has  defined  a  coherent  research  portfolio  on  climate  change  emphasizing  on  three  areas: 
adaptation,  mitigation,  and  policy.  This  sets  crop  production  into  the  broader  context  of  food 
supply and food security alongside socioeconomic issues, such as rural development and gender 
mainstreaming.  IRRI  also  maintains  solid  working  relationships  with  other  international  crop 
research institutes belonging to the Consultative Group on Agricultural Research (CGIAR) and 
has agreed to deliver their solutions to Lao PDR a in a seamless manner.   
138.  Currently, Lao PDR and IRRI are conducting joint research projects on climate change 
adaptation and mitigation, climate-resilient rice varieties, remote sensing-based crop monitoring, 
improvement of farmers’ livelihoods, and postharvest technology. Many Lao researchers are also 
benefiting  from  IRRI’s  training  and  capacity-building  activities.  Some  achievements  of  IRRI  in 
relation to the development of climate-resilient varieties are listed below:  
(i) 
(ii) 
Flood tolerance: The erratic floods experienced in rainfed and flood-affected areas 
are  usually  caused  by  heavy  rainfall,  overflow  of  nearby  rivers  and  canals  or 
sometimes  tidal  movements  as  in  coastal  areas.  These  floods  cause  serious 
problems for  rice  and other  crops  because  of the poor  or  non-existent  drainage 
and, in some cases, the topography of the land prevents fast water movement to 
drain flooded fields. Through conventional breeding, IRRI developed a rice variety 
that  can  withstand  being  submerged  under  water  for  two  weeks. After  the  gene 
(called SUB1 gene) was found, it was infused into popularly grown rice varieties in 
rice-growing  countries  in  Asia.  Scuba  rice  is  spreading  fast  in  several  countries 
over the last few years and are currently grown by more than 5 million farmers in 
Asia.  
Drought  tolerance:  Drought  is  the  most  widespread  and  damaging  of  all 
environmental stresses, affecting 23 million hectares of rainfed rice in South and 
Southeast  Asia.  IRRI  scientists  have  identified  several  key  regions  of  the  rice 
genome  that  give  the  rice  drought  tolerance  and  improve  rice  grain  yield  under 
drought. IRRI is working towards introducing drought tolerance into popular high-
yielding  rice  varieties.  By  using  drought-tolerant  rice,  farmers  can  enjoy  0.8-1.2 
tons  per  hectare  yield  advantage  than  non-drought-tolerant  varieties.  This  yield 
advantage will make the drought prone areas of target provinces in Lao PDR to be 
much more productive, contributing to food security in poor rural communities. 
139.  Some achievements of IRRI on climate smart agriculture techniques are listed below: 
(i) 
Climate smart water management: IRRI has developed the alternate wetting and 
drying technology (AWD) or intermittent irrigation of the rice field as an effective 
water-saving measure.  It  reduces  water  consumption  in  paddy  rice  by  30%  and 
consequently,  reduces  the  cost  of  pumping  water.  Additionally,  AWD  helps 
mitigate emissions of methane—a greenhouse gas—in rice production by 50%.  
142   Appendix 3 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
Nutrient management: Fertilizer often represents the highest input cost for farmers 
after labor, accounting for about 20% of the total cost of production. Soil nutrient 
knowledge can guide the development of practical tools to help farmers increase 
rice production and reduce costs through smart nutrient management. Importantly, 
the work shows that when fertilizer is used appropriately, yield can boost without 
negative impact on soil health.  
Pest  management:  Through  a  collaborative  research  network  with  national 
scientists in Asia, IRRI and ADB initiated the Rice Planthopper Project. It promotes 
ecological  engineering  as  a  management  strategy  to  build  ecological  diversity 
which strengthens the rice field’s natural capacity to cope with pests. 
Rice  Research  and  Training  Project:  An  SDC-funded  project  provided  higher 
degree training, short courses, on-the-job training, and participation in international 
conferences/seminars to Lao PDR. Now, Lao PDR is a key site for rice research 
in uplands under IRRI’s CURE with a network of thirteen research stations and a 
well-trained  cadre  of  research  scientists  and  managers.  The  project  helped  the 
government of Lao PDR achieve sustainable rice self-sufficiency. 
140. 
In view of the wide-ranging achievements in development of climate-resilient varieties and 
dissemination of climate smart agricultural practices and technologies to various countries, and 
in recognition of outstanding contributions to the Lao research institutions, IRRI is ideally placed 
to provide its services under this package in a comprehensive manner. Estimated budget below.
