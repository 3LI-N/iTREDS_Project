Project Administration Manual Purpose  
1.  The  project  administration  manual  (PAM)  describes  the  essential  administrative  and 
management requirements to implement the project on time, within budget, and in accordance 
with the policies and procedures of the government and Asian Development Bank (ADB). The 
PAM  should  include  references  to  all  available  templates  and  instructions  either  through 
linkages to relevant URLs or directly incorporated in the PAM. 
2.  The  Ministry  of  Finance,  the  Rural  Restructuring  Agency  (RRA),  and the  Ministry  for  Foreign 
Trade  (MFT)  are  wholly  responsible  for  the  implementation  of  ADB-financed  projects,  as 
agreed  jointly  between  the  borrower  and  ADB,  and  in  accordance  with  the  policies  and 
for  supporting 
procedures  of 
implementation  including  compliance  by  RRA  and  the  MFT  of  their  obligations  and 
responsibilities for project implementation in accordance with ADB’s policies and procedures. 
the  government  and  ADB.  ADB  staff 
is  responsible 
3.  At  loan  negotiations,  the  borrower  and  ADB  shall  agree  to  the  PAM  and  ensure  consistency 
with the loan and project agreements. Such agreement shall be reflected in the minutes of the 
loan negotiations. In the event of any discrepancy or contradiction between the PAM and the 
loan and project agreements, the provisions of the loan and project agreement shall prevail. 
4.  After ADB Board approval of the project's report and recommendations of the President (RRP), 
changes in implementation arrangements are subject to agreement and approval pursuant to 
relevant government and ADB administrative procedures (including the Project Administration 
Instructions) and upon such approval, they will be subsequently incorporated in the PAM.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
1. 
The  proposed  project  supports  the  government’s  plan  to  establish  horticulture  clusters 
where  production  and  post-harvest  services  can  be  consolidated  to  improve  efficiency  and 
economies  of  scale.  It  will  finance  the  establishment  of  agro-logistic  centers  (ALCs)  in  two 
locations—Andijan  and  Samarkand  regions—taking  into  account  international  best  practices. 
Such  infrastructure  will  provide  all  necessary  facilities  and  services  under  one  roof:  trading, 
storage, processing, food safety certification, customs clearance, transport, shipping, marketing 
advisory  services,  trade  finance,  and  commercial  banking,  etc.  Significantly  larger  volumes  of 
product with improved quality will be marketed as a result of better post-harvest logistics that will 
facilitate reduced post-harvest losses and increased domestic sales and exports. The ALCs will 
enhance value-chain linkages with production, post-harvest processing, and handling following 
international  quality,  and  safety  standards.  Increased  export  and  domestic  marketing  of 
horticultural products will increase price transmission to small-scale producers, and small- and 
medium-sized agribusinesses. It will also support further diversification of the agriculture sector 
from cotton to horticulture, which generates higher financial and economic returns, and involves 
fewer social and environmental concerns.

Project implementation and management structure. The Rural Restructuring Agency 
(RRA)  will  be  the  executing  agency  of  the  project  and  will  be  responsible  for  the  overall 
implementation of the project. The Ministry for Foreign Trade (MFT) and the ALC management 
company (once established) will be the implementing agencies for the project. The MFT will be 
responsible  for  the  establishment  of  the  ALC  management  company  as  a  limited  liability 
company,  which  will  be  fully-owned  by  the  government.  The  ALC  management  company  will 
own,  operate  and  manage  the  ALCs.  The  management  board  of  the  ALC  management 
company,  comprising  of  one  managing  director  and  two  deputy  managing  directors,  will  be 
responsible for the day-to-day operations of the ALC management company. 
4. 
The ALC management company will have a supervisory board which will be chaired by a 
MFT’s deputy minister with senior representatives from the Ministry of Agriculture, the Chamber 
of  Commerce,  customs  authority,  regional  governments  of  Andijan  and  Samarkand,  and/or 
other relevant sector agencies. The supervisory board will hold its meeting on a quarterly basis 
and will be responsible for ensuring that (i) the ALC management company operates with good 
governance  and  in  accordance  with  applicable  laws  and  regulations  of  the  Republic  of 
Uzbekistan; (ii) the products traded in each ALC comply with quality and safety standards; and 
(iii) the ALCs provide regular and solution-oriented feedback to help the government formulate 
policies,  strategies,  and  regulations  related  to  (a)  organizing  and  modernizing  the  horticulture 
value  chain;  (b)  improving  linkages  between  value  chain  actors;  and  (c)  agro-product  safety, 
traceability, and certifications. 
5. 
The  project  management  office  (PMO)  established  under  the  RRA,  and  the  project 
management  and  supervision  consultant  (PSC)  engaged  under  the  project  will  assist  the  ALC 
management company in setting up ALCs, including preparation of ALCs’ detailed designs, land 
acquisition,  compliance  with  social  and  environmental  safeguards,  construction  of  civil  works 
and purchase and installation of equipment. The RRA, through the PMO, will recruit the PSC as 
an  international  firm  using  the  quality-and  cost-based  selection  (90:10)  method  in  accordance 
with ADB’s  Procurement Guidelines  (2015,  as  amended from time to  time).  The  PMO  and the 
PSC will assist the ALC management company in recruiting a turnkey contractor to design and 
construct  the  ALCs.  The  ALC  management  company  will  supervise  the  detailed  design  and 
construction with assistance of the PMO and the PSC. 
6. 
Operation  of  the  ALCs  and  private  sector  participation.  The  ALC  management 
company  will  operate and manage the  ALCs  on commercial  and  cost-recovery  principles. The 
ALC  management  company  will  lease  out  the  ALC  facilities  to  private  sector  users  and/or 
operators  on  user-pays  principle.  Prospective  private  sector  clients  will  include  producers 
(farmers), processors, traders, exporters, and other support service providers such as transport 
companies,  banks,  insurance  companies  and  brokerage  houses,  among  others. With  all  post-
harvest  activities  taking  place  within  the  premises,  the  ALCs  will  help  strengthen  linkages 
among  value  chain actors,  both  upstream  and downstream,  and  increase efficiency gains and 
value addition along the horticulture value chain.

The  MFT  will  ensure  an  annual  assessment/audit  of  the  ALC  Management  Company,  starting 
from the second year after commencement of commercial operation of the ALCs, by employing, 
among  others,  a  combination  of  the  following  financial  and  physical  indicators:  (a)  Financial: 
return on assets (of at least equal to annual inflation rate of the reporting year plus 2.0%); and 
debt  to  equity  (not  exceeding  1.5  times);  and  (b)  Physical:  occupancy  rate  of  the  wholesale 
market area (of no less than 65%); occupancy rate of the small-farmers’ market area for each 
ALC  (of  no  less  than  70%);  total  processing  throughput  in  each  ALC  for  export  and  domestic 
sales (of no less than 0.7 million tons); and utilization rate of cold storage capacity in each ALC 
(of no less than 0.9 million tons).  
Organization  Structure  of  the  ALC  Management  Company.  The  ALC  management 
9. 
company  will  have  three key  departments:  (i)  Administration  Department,  with subdivisions for 
Finance, and Legal Affairs and Human Resources; (ii) Operations Department, with subdivisions

Location and Site Selection 
10. 
The selection of the location for the ALCs reflected an assessment of the potential of all 
Uzbekistan’s  12  regions  and  the  Autonomous  Republic  of  Karakalpakstan  based  on  (i)  the 
existing  and  potential  levels  of  horticulture  production;  and  (ii)  existing  market,  post-harvest, 
transport,  and  utilities  infrastructure,  and  ease  of  access  to key  domestic  and  export  markets. 
Discussions  were  held  with  horticulture  sector  stakeholders  and  potential  participants  in  ALC 
management  and  operation  at  regional  and  national  levels.  Such  stakeholders  included 
provincial  and  district  administrations,  market  operators  and  users,  owners  and  operators  of 
post-harvest  facilities  (cold  storage,  processing,  etc.,),  farmers  (including  dehkan  [small-scale] 
farmers) and traders, RRA, and concerned government ministries. 
11. 
The  choice  of  Andijan  and  Samarkand  is  based  on  their  greater  suitability  relative  to 
other  areas  of  Uzbekistan.  In  particular,  Andijan  and  Samarkand  is  based  on  their  favorable 
agro-climatic  conditions  that  allow  multiple  fruit  and  vegetable  crops  per  year.  Together,  they 
account  for  25%  of  the  total  area  in  Uzbekistan  under  horticulture  crops  and  for  30%  of  total 
9 
production,  which  are  significantly  higher  than  other  regions.  They  have  large  dehkan  farmer 
populations,  accounting  for  22%  of  all  dehkan  farmers  in  Uzbekistan,  who  will  benefit  from 
increased  market  opportunities.  Andijan  and  Samarkand  also  have  significant  urban 
populations,  are  well  connected  to  other  urban  centers  in  Uzbekistan,  and  are  strategically 
located  for  access  to  export  markets.  1  There  was  also  strong  support  from  Andijan  and 
Samarkand regional administrations for establishing the ALCs in their locality. 
12.  Within  Andijan  and  Samarkand,  selection  of  the  specific  site  for  location  of  each  ALC 
was based on a number of criteria, as follows: (i) availability of a land plot of at least 50 hectare 
(ha)  (with  potential  expansion  up  to  100  ha)  not  currently  in  use;  (ii)  proximity  to  main  city 
center;  (iii)  easy  (and  close)  access  to  transportation  infrastructure  (provincial  highways  and 
railways);  (iv)  access to utilities  (electricity, gas, and water);  (v)  level  terrain (without  hills); (vi) 
safe  distance  from  watercourses  (river,  streams,  and  springs);  (vii)  outside  environmentally 
protected  area;  (viii)  safe  distance  from  large-scale  industrial  or  chemical  plants;  (ix)  minimal 
impacts of land acquisition and resettlement;  (x) ease of access for construction works; and (xi) 
supportive regional and district administration. 
13. 
Andijan  Site.  The  ALC  at  Andijan  comprises  (a)  approximately  25,000  square  meters 
(m2) of trading area split evenly between wholesale and small farmer sales areas with an annual 
throughput of around 425,000 tons; (b) approximately 60,000 cubic meters (m3) of cold storage 
with an annual capacity of approximately up to 1.5 million tons; (c) 12 processing lines with an 
approximate  annual  throughput  of  600,000  tons  for  export  and  80,000  tons  for  the  domestic 
market;  and  (d)  provision  of  groundworks  for  future  expansion  of  the  ALC  for  an  increased 
volume  of  horticulture  produce  and/or  trading,  storage,  and  processing  of  alternative  food 
product. The ALC at Andijan will be located in Andijan district away from, but well connected to 
Andijan city. The site is located on National Highway 4P112 and the A373 (Tashkent - Fergana 
Valley road) and opposite the airport. It is in the center of the major production areas of Andijan 
region  in  Andijan,  Asaka,  Jalalkuduk,  Pakhtaabad,  and  Shakhrihon  districts.  It  is  also  well 
located  for  access  to  and from  neighboring  regions  of  Fergana  and  Namangan,  and  to  export 
destinations.  The  identified  site  covers  a  gross  area  of  51.43  ha,  of  which  40.90  ha  will  be 
developed under the proposed project, and the remaining area is reserved for future expansion. 
Samarkand  Site.  The  ALC  at  Samarkand  comprises:  (a)  approximately  35,600  m2  of 
14. 
trading  area  split  evenly  between  wholesale  and  small  farmer  sales  areas  with  an  annual 
throughput of around 550,000 tons; (b) approximately 60,000 m3 of cold storage with an annual 
capacity of up to 1.5 million tons; (c) 17 processing lines with an approximate annual throughput 
of  850,000  tons  for  export  and  150,000  tons  for  the  domestic  market;  and  (d)  provision  of 
groundworks  for  future  expansion  of  the  ALC  for  an  increased  volume  of  horticulture  produce 
and/or trading, storage and processing of alternative food products. The ALC at Samarkand will 
be located in Jomboy district with good connection to Samarkand city. It is on National Highway 
M39  connecting  Samarkand  with  Tashkent  and  is  close  to  Samarkand  airport.  The  location  in 
Jomboy  will  enable  traders  from  southern  regions  of  Surkandarya  and  Kashkadarya  to  avoid 
passing through Samarkand city thereby avoiding traffic congestion in the city. It is in the center 
of the major production areas of Samarkand Region in Bulungur, Jomboy, Samarkand, Toyloq, 
and Urgut districts. The identified site covers a gross area of 78.00 ha, of which 54.83 ha will be 
developed  under  the  proposed  project,  and  the  remaining  area  is  reserved  for  future 
1  ALCs  in  Tashkent  region  and/or  other  regions  may  be  considered  in  another  project  or  an  additional  financing, 
subject to the government’s request and further due diligence by ADB.

expansion.2    Both  ALCs  will  include  on-site  trade  support  facilities  such  as  quality  and  safety 
certification, online market information system, banking, and custom services, among others. 
2. 
Key Design Features of the ALCs 
15. 
Each ALC is designed as a hub, at the center of which is the administration building that 
will  house  ALC  administration  offices,  and  complementary  services  for  market  users  such  as 
financial services, laboratory services and certification, customs clearance, transport agencies, 
accommodation,  and  restaurant.  Around  the  administration  building,  the  market  trading  areas, 
cold  storage  buildings,  and  processing  buildings will  be  constructed.  All  buildings  and facilities 
will be based on a modular format so that they may be replicated to cater for increased demand 
for a particular type of service. This approach provides flexibility for the future expansion of the 
ALC  to  handle  larger  volumes  of  horticulture  produce  or  to  diversify  into  alternative  products 
such as meat and dairy (if needed). Detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 3. 
16. 
Key features and functions of each ALC are as follows.3 
17. 
Entrance Area features the following: 
•

Redirection to: 
• 
Market  building  –  areas  for  (i)  wholesale  traders,  brokers,  exporters, 
medium-size farmers, and (ii) small farmers. 
Post-harvest  services  building  –  area  for  washing,  weighing,  sorting, 
grading,  and  packaging  for  local  distribution.  Areas  will  be  crop  specific, 
combining produce of similar dimensions.  
Post-harvest  services  building  –  area  for  washing,  weighing,  sorting, 
grading, and packaging for export. Areas will be crop specific. 
Processing area – peeling, cutting, and preserving depending on crop. In 
the  Andijan  ALC  an  area  is  proposed  specifically  for  tomato  processing 
given the volume of production in the Andijan area. 
Cold storage for cold or frozen product storage.

18.  Market  building  area  for  wholesale  traders,  brokers,  exporters,  medium-size 
farmers.  This  is  the  fruit,  vegetables,  and  tubers  wholesale  area  within  warehouses  and/or 
pavilions,  with  a  central  aisle  for  buyers  and  commercial  areas  (rentable  on  an  annual  or 
monthly basis) to the side arranged in stalls (10m by 6m) with a door to a loading and unloading 
dock  for  shipping  by  pallet  or  in  boxes.  Stalls  will  be  designed  to  include  cold  storage,  basic 
processing and packing area, and office space at the cost of the tenant. Andijan ALC will have 
three  warehouses,  around  18,000  m2,  capacity  400,000–450,000  tons  per  year;  while 
Samarkand ALC will have four warehouses, around 25,000 m2, capacity 550,000–600,000 tons 
per year. 
19.  Market  building  area  for  small  farmers.  This  is  an  area  within  warehouses  and/or 
2  ALCs  in  Tashkent  region  and/or  other  regions  may  be  considered  in  another  project  or  an  additional  financing, 
subject to the government’s request and further due diligence by ADB.  
3  The  specific  size  and  functional  capacity  of  each  ALC  are defined  in the  detailed  feasibility  studies of  each  ALC 
(available on request). 
11 
pavilions  dedicated  for  use  by  small  farmers  and  rented  by  the  day  or  week  to  accommodate 
sellers with smaller product volumes and selling on an intermittent basis. Sales areas comprise 
floor space demarcated into 3m x 2m blocks. The area will have a cold store for common use. 
The upper floor of the market building can be used to house additional storage, accommodation, 
and restaurants. 
20. 
Post-harvest services building - areas for internal distribution and export of fresh 
and  processed  fruits  and  vegetables.  This  is  a  building  incorporating  processing  lines  for 
basic processing of fruit, vegetables, and tubers for domestic sale and export. There will be 12 
processing lines in the Andijan ALC, and 17 processing lines in the Samarkand ALC, each with 
a  capacity  of  10–15  tons/hour,  depending  on  the  projected  throughput  by  type  and  volume  of 
fruit and vegetables. 
21. 
The envisaged processing flow is as follows: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Arrival at the loading dock and unloading of produce 
Reception and produce weighing 
Precooling  
Processing 
Cleaning

Conservation and product packing/packaging 
Delivery to (i) wholesale market, (ii) cold storage, and (iii) exporters 
Current  practice  is to transport  produce  in  bulk, which results  in significant  losses. The 
22. 
two  ALCs  will  operate  a  standardized  packing  management  system  for  all  fruit  and  vegetable 
produce  chain.  All  users  of  processing  facilities  will  be  required  to  use  crates,  pallets,  and 
containers. Their use will also be promoted for producers, consolidators, transporters, wholesale 
and  retail  sellers,  and  exporters.  The  post-harvest  services  building  includes  the  following 
infrastructure and/or facilities:

23. 
produce  destined  for  export.  Each  refrigeration  or  freezing  chamber  will  be  15m  x  10m  x  7m 
(1,050  m3)  with  three  storage  levels  using  a  rack  system.  At  each  ALC,  it  is  proposed  to 
establish  60  chambers  providing  around  63,000  m3  with  a  capacity  of  21,000  tons,  and  an 
annual  throughput  of  1.5  million  tons.  The  cold  storage  building  includes  the  following

Administrative building. This is a four-story building with 1,000 m2 usable area on each 
24. 
level. This will be where the ALC administration office of the management company is located. It 
will also provide space for complementary services for ALC users, such as customs clearance, 
laboratory facilities, health, first aid and pharmacy, communications, financial services (currency 
exchange  and  banking),  restaurant,  and  accommodation.  It  is  proposed  to  rent  space  on  first 
level  to  service providers  with  rentable  areas  ranging from  20  m2 to  100  m2. The  second  level 
would house the offices of the ALC management company, the third level the business center, 
meeting and training rooms and laboratory, and the fourth level is for the customs office.

FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT 
A. 
Financial Management Assessment 
The  financial  management  assessment  (FMA)  was  conducted  during  February–March 
27. 
2018  for  the  RRA  and  in  September  2018  for  the  Ministry  for  Foreign  Trade  (MFT)  in 
accordance with ADB’s Guidelines for the Financial Management and Analysis of Projects and 
the Financial Due Diligence: A Methodology Note. The FMA considered the capacity of the RRA 
and  MFT,  including  funds-flow  arrangements,  staffing,  accounting  and  financial  reporting 
systems,  financial  information  systems,  and  internal  and  external  auditing  arrangements. 
Although  no  project  fund  will  flow  through  the  MFT  during  the  project  implementation, 
FMA  was  conducted  and  recommendations  were  made  to  help  them  better  able  to 
supervise the ALC management company once set up.4 
28. 
Rural  Restructuring  Agency.  Based  on  the  assessment  of  the  RRA,  there  are  no 
significant  financial  management  risks  in  respect  of  its  proposed  role  in  project  management 
under  the  proposed  project.  The  RRA  has  significant  experience  in  the  implementation  of 
projects  financed  by  ADB,  the  World  Bank,  and  other  international  financial  institutions.  The 
financial management arrangements in place for those projects are appropriate for the proposed 
project. 
29. 
It  is  concluded  that  the  overall  pre-mitigation  financial  management  risk  of  the  RRA  is 
moderate.  As  the  executing  agency  of  the  project,  RRA  has  adequate  capacity  to  administer 
advance  account  procedures  with  the  six  (6)  month-expenditure  limit  proposed  and  the 
statement of expenditure (SOE) procedures. RRA has complied with all FMA actions under the 
Horticulture Value Chain Development Project (Loan 3471-UZB) as of April 2018. 
30.  Ministry  for  Foreign  Trade.  Based  on  the  assessment  of  MFT,  the  overall  pre-
mitigation financial management risk is moderate in respect of its proposed role in  supervising 
the ALC management company to be established. A number of key risks have been assessed 
as requiring actions by the MFT, namely (i) the MFT staff are not experienced in managing ADB 
projects and in ADB procedures; (ii) lack of accounting staff trained and certified in international 
public  sector  accounting  standards  (IPSAS);  (iii)  fixed  assets  are  not  properly  registered  and 
labelled  with  inventory  numbers;  (iv)  no  internal  audit  function  in  place;  and  (v)  no  risk 
management  function  in  place.  Corresponding  financial  management  actions  to  address  the 
stated risks are outlined in Table 10. 
4  Detailed FMAs for RRA and MFT are accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2 of the RRP.

All  procurement  of  goods  and  works  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB’s 
Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time). One turnkey contract package, 
10 ADB’s approach and procedures regarding delayed submission of audited project financial statements:  
(i)  When audited project financial statements are not received by the due date, ADB will write to the executing 
agency advising that (a) the audit documents are overdue; and (b) if they are not received within the next 6 
months,  requests  for  new  contract  awards  and  disbursement  such  as  new  replenishment  of  advance 
accounts, processing of new reimbursement, and issuance of new commitment letters will not be processed. 
(ii)  When  audited  project  financial  statements  are  not  received  within  6  months  after  the  due  date,  ADB  will 
withhold processing of requests for new contract awards and disbursement such as new replenishment of 
advance accounts, processing of new reimbursement, and issuance of new commitment letters. ADB will (a) 
inform the executing agency of ADB’s actions; and (b) advise that the loan may be suspended if the audit 
documents are not received within the next 6 months. 
(iii)  When audited project financial statements  are not received within 12 months after the due date, ADB may 
suspend the loan.

estimated  to  cost  $213.57  million,  will  be  used  to  procure  detailed  engineering  designs,  civil 
works, buildings, and equipment supply to establish two ALCs (one in Andijan region and one in 
Samarkand region). The turnkey contract will follow international competitive bidding  using the 
two-stage  procedures.  The  turnkey  contract  is  proposed  to  ensure  that  (i)  civil  works 
construction,  buildings,  and  equipment  installation  for  optimal  finishing  and  utility  will  be 
consistent  with  the  overall  masterplan  for  each  ALC,  and  coherent  with  the  detailed  designs; 
and  (ii)  ALCs  will  be  installed  with  most  up-to-date  equipment, furniture,  and fixtures,  which is 
not the case if the detailed designs are prepared by a separate contractor(s) due to a time lag, 
needs for adjustments, and design discrepancies. To minimize the risk of inflated cost estimates 
by  the  turnkey  contractors,  the  PMO  and  ALC  management  company  with  technical  support 
from  the  PSC  will  supervise  and  guide  the  ALCs  detailed  designs;  and  the  government’s 
technical  agencies  will  review  such  detailed  designs  until  they  are  in  acceptable  forms  and 
substance  for  the  government’s  approval.  Only  after  the  ALCs  detailed  designs are  approved, 
can  the  turnkey  contractor(s)  be  notified  to  proceed  with  civil  works,  buildings,  and  equipment 
installation.13  Shopping  will  be  used  for  contracts  for  procurement  of  office  equipment  and 
vehicles for project implementation, worth less than $100,000. 
49. 
All consultants will be recruited according to ADB’s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants 
(2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).14  The  PSC  will  be  engaged  by  the  RRA.  The  terms  of 
reference for the PSC service are detailed in Appendix 2. The contract for consultant’s service 
will  be  time-based.  The  PSC  comprises  a  total  of  314  person-months  (including  232  person-
months  of  international  specialists  and  82  person-months  of  national  specialists).  An 
international  consulting  firm  will  be  engaged  by  the  PMO  using  the  quality  and  cost-based 
selection  (QCBS)  method  with  90:10  ratio  to  assist  in  overall  project  implementation  and 
supervision. Key aspects of the PSC’s work will include, but not limited to the following:  (i) set 
up  and  develop  capacity  of  the  ALC  management  company  in  managing  and  operating  the 
ALCs through preparing and applying operational guides and protocol, coaching and on-the-job 
training; (ii) assist the PMO in managing and implementing the project and ensuring compliance 
with  the  project  implementation  plan,  the  loan  agreement,  and  the  project  agreement(s);  (iii) 
assist  in reviewing  and revising  bid  documents  for  goods,  works,  and  services  for  the  turnkey 
contracts  for  establishing  the  ALCs  in  selected  project  sites,  and  assist  PMO  and  ALC 
management  company  in  bid  evaluation;  (iv)  prepare  requests  for  proposal  for  capacity 
development consulting services, and assist  PMO in proposal evaluation; (v) provide technical 
oversight  and  guidance  on  technical  aspects  related  to  the  turnkey  contracts  including  the 
construction  supervision  and  capacity  development;  (vi)  supervise  the  implementation  of,  and 
monitor  the  compliances  with  social  and  environmental  safeguards,  and  social/gender 
development aspects; (vii) help set up systems and procedures including relevant management 
and  monitoring  templates  for  PMO  and  ALC  management  company  to  follow;  and  (viii)  build 
capacity of staff in the PMO and ALC management company to undertake their tasks.

SAFEGUARDS 
Two sites selected for the proposed project are Andijan and Samarkand. Both sites are 
55. 
categorized  as  “B”  for  environment,  and  “B”  for  involuntary  resettlement.  The  project  is 
categorized as “C” for indigenous peoples. Safeguard plans have been prepared for both project 
sites.  These  plans  are:  (i) 
the  environmental  management  plans  (see  Report  and 
Recommendation of the President [RRP] to the Board of Director linked documents); and (ii) the 
resettlement plans (see RRP’s linked documents).  
26 
The RRA is responsible for implementing these plans. Budget has been included in the 
56. 
project cost estimates for implementing activities as described in each plan. The PSC package 
has  included  the  following  specialists:  (i)  international  environment  specialist;  (ii)  international 
resettlement  specialist;  (iii)  national  environment  specialist;  and  (iv)  national  resettlement 
specialist.  The  PMO  has  allocated  full-time  national  environment  and  resettlement  officers  to 
ensure  proper  implementation  and  adequate  monitoring  of  the  plans  throughout  the  project 
period.  The  PSC  and  PMO  staffing  and  terms  of  reference  are  in  Appendices  1  and  2, 
respectively. 
57. 
Environment. Impacts from the project are expected to be limited in magnitude and site-
specific,  mostly  related  to  construction  activities.  These  include  generation  of  dust,  waste 
generation, noise and vibration, transportation of construction materials. Environmental impacts 
during  operation  phase  include  solid  waste,  impacts  on  surface  and  ground  water  sources 
(especially  for  the  Samarkand  ALC),  and  from  the  increased  traffic  of  goods  transportation. 
These impacts could be mitigated by proper implementation of mitigation measures developed 
in the environmental management plan (EMP). 
58. 
The  RRA’s  PMO  will  be  responsible  for  implementation  of  EMP  to  comply  with  ADB’s 
safeguards requirements and environmental national regulations. For this purpose, the PMO will 
hire  a  qualified full-time  environmental  officer.  International  and  national  environmental 
specialists  of the  PSC  will  assist  the  PMO  and guide  the  contractors for EMP  implementation. 
The cost for implementing EMP during construction will be financed by the project, specifically, 
the  costs  of  mitigation  measures  and  environmental  monitoring  will  be  included  in  the 
construction  contracts,  and  the  cost  for  environmental  supervision  will  be  included  in  the 
consulting  service  of  the  PSC.  The  PMO  is  responsible  for  overall  environmental  compliance 
with the ADB’s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). During the operation, EMP implementation 
will be included in the operating costs of the ALC management company. A grievance redress 
mechanism to handle both environmental and social safeguard issues will be established after 
the project effectivity.  
59. 
Land Acquisition and Resettlement. The PMO will ensure that land acquisition will be 
carried out in accordance with Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) requirements, and applicable 
laws  and  regulations  of  Uzbekistan  that  have  been  referred  to  in  the  land  acquisition  and 
resettlement  plans (LARPs). The  RRA’s  PMO  will  ensure  that the  LARPs  will  be  implemented 
and  monitored  to  ensure  that  no  project  affected  person  will  suffer  by  unattended  impacts 
associated  with  land  acquisition.  The  draft  LARPs  indicated  that  the  project  will  require 
approximately 130 ha of land, which will affect approximately 63 households. 
60. 
PMO  will  be  responsible  to  pay  compensation  to  the  affected  households  due  to  land 
acquisition  according  to  the  process  outlined  in  the  LARPs.  The  civil  works  could  only  be 
commenced  after  compensation  is  fully  paid  to  all  the  affected  households.  For  implementing 
the LARP, the RRA will ensure that: 
•  The  RRA,  as  the  executing  agency,  will  establish  a  PMO  with  required  staff, 
including a social safeguards and resettlement specialist within the PMO; 
•  The  draft  LARPs  will  be  updated  after  the  detailed  design  is  available.  The 
resettlement  specialist  will  carry  out  adequate  consultations  with  the  affected 
persons. The updated LARPs should indicate any change in land acquisition due to 
the  detailed  design,  change  in  the  number  of  the  affected  persons,  and  change  in 
budget for the LARP implementation. However, the standards set in the entitlement 
matrix of the approved draft LARP cannot be lowered in the final LARP without any 
clear reasons; 
27 
•  The  updated  LARPs  have  to  be  submitted  to  ADB  for  concurrence  prior  to 
implementation  and  have  to  be  submitted  as  early  as  possible  after  the  detailed 
engineering design becomes available; 
•  The updated LARPs will be disclosed on the ADB and PMO website. The PMO will 
be  responsible  to  disclose  relevant  information  from  the  updated  LARP  to  the 
affected people; 
•  The awarding of civil works contract will be done only after the affected households 
receive full payment of compensation, and a report on full payment of compensation 
needs to be submitted to ADB; 
•  A report on monitoring the implementation of the LARP, including any grievances will 
be submitted to ADB on semi-annual basis until the payment of compensation to the 
affected households is completed; and 
•  The  RRA,  through  the  resettlement  specialist  of  the  PMO  will  observe  any 
unanticipated  impacts  due  to  land  acquisition  and  take  necessary  measures  in 
accordance to the provision described in the LARPs. 
Indigenous  Peoples.  The  project  has  been  classified  as  category  C  for  indigenous 
61. 
peoples’ safeguard. There are no indigenous people’s communities in the project area or in the 
country  in  general,  as  defined  in  the  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  for  operational 
purposes. Accordingly, no indigenous peoples planning documents will be required. 
62. 
Prohibited investment activities. Pursuant to Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), ADB 
funds may not be applied to the activities described on the ADB Prohibited Investment Activities 
List set forth in the Appendix 5 of the Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). 
VIII.  GENDER AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS 
The  proposed  project  is  categorized  as  “effective  gender  mainstreaming  (EGM)”.  The 
63. 
main  thrusts  of  gender  development  associated  with  the  project  investment  are  to  (i)  improve 
female  entrepreneurship  in  horticulture  business  development  and  management,  and  (ii) 
promote  job  creation  for  female  workers  directly  and  indirectly.  Detailed  gender  action  plan

ANTICORRUPTION POLICY 
73. 
ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any violations of the 
Anticorruption  Policy  relating  to  the  project.16  All  contracts  financed  by  ADB  shall  include 
provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the 
executing  agency  and  all  project  contractors,  suppliers,  consultants,  and  other  service 
providers.  Individuals  and/or  entities  on  ADB’s  anticorruption  debarment  list  are  ineligible  to 
participate in ADB-financed activity and may not be awarded any contracts under the project.17 
To support these efforts, relevant provisions will be included in the loan and project agreements 
and the bidding documents for the project.  
XI. 
ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISM 
74. 
People who  are,  or may  in the future  be,  adversely  affected  by the  project  may  submit 
complaints  to  ADB’s  Accountability  Mechanism.  The  Accountability  Mechanism  provides  an 
independent  forum  and  process  whereby  people  adversely  affected  by  ADB-assisted  projects 
can voice, and seek a resolution of their problems, as well as report alleged violations of ADB’s 
operational  policies  and  procedures.  Before  submitting  a  complaint  to  the  Accountability 
Mechanism,  affected  people  should  make  an  effort  in  good  faith  to  solve  their  problems  by 
working  with the  concerned ADB  operations  department. Only  after  doing  that,  and  if they  are 
still dissatisfied, should they approach the Accountability Mechanism.18

APPENDIX  2:  TERMS  OF  REFERENCE  FOR  PROJECT  MANAGEMENT  AND 
SUPERVISION CONSULTING SERVICE 
Republic of Uzbekistan 
Project No. 51041-002: Horticulture Value Chain Infrastructure Development Project 
Terms of Reference for Project Management and Supervision Consulting Service 
A.  
PROJECT BACKGROUND 
1. 
The  proposed  project  supports  the  government’s  plan  to  establish  horticulture  clusters 
where  production  and  post-harvest  services  can  be  consolidated  to  improve  efficiency  and 
economies  of  scale.  It  will  finance  the  establishment  of  agro-logistic  centers  (ALCs)  in  two 
locations—Andijan  and  Samarkand—taking  into  account  international  best  practices.  Such 
infrastructure will provide all necessary facilities and services under one roof: trading, storage, 
processing, food safety certification, customs clearance, transport, shipping, marketing advisory 
services, trade finance and commercial banking, etc. Significantly larger volumes of product with 
improved  quality  will  be  marketed  as  a  result  of  better  post-harvest  logistics  that  will  facilitate 
reduced post-harvest losses and increased domestic sales and exports. The ALCs will enhance 
value-chain 
following 
international  quality,  and  safety  standards.  Increased  export  and  domestic  marketing  of 
horticultural products will increase price transmission to small-scale producers, and small- and 
medium-sized agribusinesses. It will also support further diversification of the agriculture sector 
from cotton to horticulture, which generates higher financial and economic returns, and involves 
fewer social and environmental concerns.  
linkages  with  production,  post-harvest  processing,  and  handling 
2. 
The  Rural  Restructuring  Agency  (RRA)  will  be  the  executing  agency,  and  the  project 
management  office  (PMO)  under  the  RRA  will  oversee  implementation  activities,  including 
monitoring of ALCs’ detailed designs, construction, land acquisition and resettlement, and social 
and environmental safeguards. It will also manage the consultants for project management and 
supervision and capacity building. An ALC management company will be established under the 
Ministry for Foreign Trade as a limited liability company to  act as a special purpose vehicle of 
the  government  in  (i)  organizing  and  modernizing  the  horticulture  value  chain;  (ii)  improving 
linkages between value chain actors through the ALCs; and (iii) being conduits for agro-product 
safety and traceability through sanitary and phytosanitary measures and product certifications. 
The  ALC  management  company  will  work  closely  with  the  RRA  in  supervising  of  the 
construction of the ALCs and undertaking the management of the ALCs upon completion.
