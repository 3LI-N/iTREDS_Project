Project Administration Manual Purpose and Process 
1.  The  project  administration  manual  (PAM)  describes  the  essential  administrative  and 
management requirements to implement the project on time, within budget, and in accordance 
with the policies and procedures of the government and Asian Development Bank (ADB). The 
PAM should include references to all available templates and instructions either through linkages 
to relevant URLs or directly incorporated in the PAM. 
2.  The  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Forestry  (MAF)  as  the  executing  agency  (EA),  and  the 
Department  of Irrigation (DOI),  and the  Provincial  Agriculture  and  Forestry  Offices  (PAFO)  of 
Houaphan,  Xiangkhouang,  Louangphabang  and  Xaignabouli  Provinces  –implementing 
agencies (IA) are wholly responsible for the implementation of ADB-financed projects, as agreed 
jointly between the borrower and ADB, and in accordance with the policies and procedures of 
the  government  and  ADB.  ADB  staff  is  responsible  for  supporting  implementation  including 
compliance  by  MAF  -  DOI,  and  PAFOs  of  Houaphan,  Xiangkhouang,  Louangphabang  and 
Xaignabouli  of  their  obligations  and  responsibilities  for  project  implementation  in  accordance 
with ADB’s policies and procedures. 
3.  At loan negotiations, the borrower and ADB shall agree to the PAM and ensure consistency with 
the loan and grant agreements. Such agreement shall be reflected in the minutes of the  loan 
negotiations. In the event of any discrepancy or contradiction between the PAM and the  loan 
and grant agreements, the provisions of the loan and grant agreements shall prevail. 
4.  After ADB Board approval of the project's report and recommendations of the President (RRP), 
changes in implementation arrangements are subject to agreement and approval pursuant to 
relevant government and ADB administrative procedures (including the Project Administration 
Instructions) and upon such approval, they will be subsequently incorporated in the PAM.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
The  project  will  improve  rural  incomes  from  market-driven  diversified  farm  output, 
1. 
watershed  health,  and  community  nutrition  in the four  northern  provinces  (FNP)  of  Houaphan, 
Louangphabang, Xaignabouli, and Xiangkhouang. It will (i) promote diversification into dry season 
high-value crops (HVCs), improve the yields of wet season rice by providing irrigation and access; 
(ii)  protect  watershed ecological  services;  and  (iii)  improve nutrition. The project  contributes to 
government policy goals for food security, economic growth, and natural resource conservation.

Special features 
The SRIWSM design builds on the existing ADB financed subsector irrigation portfolio and 
7. 
adopts new features. These include: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
(v) 
(vi) 
(vii) 
The  transition  from  irrigation  infrastructure  focused  on  paddy  rice  to  command 
areas,  management,  provision,  and  regulation  of  reliable  water  for  dry  season 
HVCs. 
The requirement for cropping to be market-led and connected, including support 
for  developing  (i)  agribusiness  capacity  within  the  provincial  administration,  (ii) 
supporting key  commercial  market  chains  attached  to  the  irrigation  districts,  (iii) 
ensuring  crop  water  demand  is  defined,  scheduled,  and  used  to  specify 
engineering design terms of reference, and (iv) good agricultural practices using 
LAOGAP. 
Support  to  secure  watershed  ecological  services  especially  through  land  use 
change programs within the linked catchments that reduces the risk of accelerated 
evacuation of flood water, while increasing water retention within the catchment to 
reduce risk to dry season water supply. 
A  strong  commitment  to  devolved  project  implementation  under  the  Sam  Sang 
policy  with  implementation  responsibility  delegated  to  provincial  administration, 
recognizing the need to provide governance oversight and short-term mentoring 
with  the  benefit  of  building  capacity  in  public  institutions  as  opposed  to  local 
consultants. 
Support  devolution  with  project  wide  information  and  financial  management 
systems that will be cloud-based and able to interface with the new public sector’s 
double  entry  accounting  systems  for  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MAF)  and  the 
Department of Irrigation (DOI). 
The piloting and application of mobile phone technologies for project monitoring 
and reporting functions that will also enable public sector work plan reporting at far 
less cost and increased reliability. 
The integration of nutrition sensitive agriculture activities into ADB-financed loan 
portfolio.

2 Annex 1 is the detailed list of all subprojects and supporting screening. 
12 
Shortlisted subprojects. The additional subprojects will be processed according to the 
8. 
following schedule. Batch one of 4 RSPs will be followed by Batch 2 of up to two subprojects per 
province, and then batch three the following year will process 2 subprojects in Xiangkhouang and 
Xaignabouli provinces, and  one subproject each in Houaphan and Louangphabang Provinces. 
to ensure that design costs are not wasted if implementation financing is not available. Processing 
in batches will ensure that the previous year’s batch is contracted prior to committing funds to the 
final batch so that each IA is assured that sufficient funds remain for implementation. During the 
midterm  review  (MTR)  tentatively  scheduled  for  March  2023,  the  project  team  will  assess  the 
representative  subprojects’  (RSP)  implementation  progress  within  each  province.  Slow  or 
significantly  delayed  provincial  work  programs  that  were  not  adapted  or  managed  will  be 
addressed through fund reallocation from the slow-moving provinces to the provinces who meet 
the schedule. If all provinces achieve satisfactory ratings in terms of implementation, additional 
financing for the project can be requested by the executing agency (EA).

I. 
Project Devolution - Overview 
The project organization is aligned with the Sam-Sang3 policy (three builds) and aims to 
9. 
develop  the  provincial  administrations  as  strategic  units,  the  districts  as  comprehensive 
strengthening  units,  and  the  villages  as  development  units.  The  adoption  of  provincial 
implementation arrangements and WUGs is consistent with the policy. The irrigation law assigns 
the responsibility for irrigation schemes with less than 1,000 ha. to the Provincial administration 
and the PAFO’s Irrigation Section. 
10. 
The national level ministries will define overarching sectoral policies, laws and economic 
development plans that ensure inter-sectoral coordination. Provincial administrations will develop 
operational strategies that align with the national institutional framework and local priorities and 
through their District networks that support the village level development process. 
11. 
Capacity shortfalls exist in all ADB PRI projects. These capacity gaps are addressed by 
adding contracted non-government staff and consultants to complete functions expected to be 
delivered through the staff and IAs’ systems simply to achieve implementation targets, but in doing 
so, perpetuate the capacity shortfall. Consequences include (i) high turnover of contracted staff 
and local consultants as they move from provincial roles back to Vientiane - often into similar roles 
with other projects or donors, (ii) low quality of consultants due to a limited pool of expertise within 
which  skilled  people  are  targeted  into  higher  paying  roles  in  Vientiane,  (iii)  an  array  of  project 
management  systemsthat  is  difficult  for  government  staff  (and  consultants)  to  master  and 
apply,4(iv) a resultant shortfall of skills and capacity within Government staff as those employed 
by Government with skills are attracted into consulting roles.  
12. 
SRIWSM support for devolution, raises issues of the capacity of project IAs with risks to 
achieving  efficient  implementation.  SRIWSM  will  take  the  next  step  on  devolution  of  building 
capacity  at  the  provincial  level  and  working  through  this  capacity  to  institutionalize  functions. 
SRIWSM  takes  a  modest  approach  to  physical  targets,  provides  support  for  standardizing 
systems  and  procedures,  providing  up-front  support  to  build  systems  and  capacity  within  FNP 
and DOI. The SRIWSM will distribute functions, roles, and responsibilities across FNPs and then 
provide implementation support. The systems and capacity being built will provide the basis for 
moving to a system of support for a single ADB PRI program through wide adoption of the same 
project  administration  and  implementation  systems  for  financial  management,  procurement, 
monitoring and reporting. SRIWSM intends to build systems and capacity that will increasingly be 
applied through the Government administrative systems. 
13. 
The  transition  to  devolved  systems  will  constrain  the  scope  of  the  initial  activities  and 
creates additional risks relating to governance and systems integrity. The project design seeks to 
offset and manage these risks through the EA, DOPF, and DOI that will provide a governance 
support function including system establishment, mentoring implementation staff and procedures, 
and  providing  on-going  governance  oversight  throughout  each  implementation  year.  The  loan 
implementation  consultant (LIC) team contracted by DOI will provide support and guidance to 
the governance support function, as well as to the PAFOs, in the devolution process. To build 
awareness  of  roles  and  responsibilities  regarding  the  devolved  arrangements  a  series  of 
orientation  workshops  will  be  organized  by  the  EA/LIC  during  the  initial  stages  of  project 
implementation. An LIC team will also be contracted individually by each provincial IA to provide 
support and guidance at the provincial level. 
3 As defined in the Third Politburo Resolution. 
4 Including examples of multiple accounting systems, differing reporting systems within one project.

J. 
Project Organization  
14. 
At the national level, MAF,  as the EA, is ultimately responsible for project performance 
and  will,  through  its  Department  of  Planning  and  Finance  (DOPF),  provide  oversight  for 
governance  integrity  and  the  reporting  channel  on  performance  and  financial  management 
especially disbursement and replenishment reporting to MOF. 
The project organization is aligned with the structure of public administration and will be 
15. 
implemented through these, rather than through parallel project management units. MAF, through 
DOI, will implement the national level functions as defined in the Irrigation Law and other sector 
and public administration regulations. Daily implementation will be undertaken by each provincial 
administration  wherein  implementation  has  been  assigned  to  the  Provincial  Agriculture  and 
Forestry Office (PAFO) – see Figure 1.  
Figure 1: Project Organization Arrangement 
The  National  Steering  Committee  will  be  the  oversight  body  and will  be  chaired  by  the 
16. 
Minister of MAF. It will be comprised of the Governors of the four provinces (FNP). The Provincial 
Steering  Committees  will  be  chaired  by  the  Governors  of  the  four  provinces  and  will  have  as 
members, the representatives of PAFO, Provincial Office of Finance (POF), PONRE, Provincial 
Public Works and Transport Department, and the representatives of participating districts. MAF 
will  be  the  executing  agency,  with  DOI  as  the  central  implementing  agency.  A  program 
governance  team  consisting  of  government  staff  will  be  established  within  DOI  and  will  be 
responsible for project supervision and mentoring of provincial staff.

DOI project roles will be assigned to appropriate staff within its existing structure using 
staff with the mandated roles for irrigation development and public sector administration functions 
who  will  be  assigned  to  SRIWSM.  There  will  be  no  project  management  unit  but  rather  the 
SRIWSM will be managed by the existing team - PGT.  
18. 
In line with the government decentralization policy, each of the FNP governor’s offices will 
be  an  implementing  agency  and  will  assign  the  Provincial  Agricultural  and  Forestry  Offices 
(PAFO)  for  the  daily  implementation  of  consultant  recruitment,  local  procurement,  finances, 
subproject design and approvals through their staff resources. 
1. 
Governance Risks 
19. 
Under  devolved  project  implementation,  the  high  financial  management  risks  will  be 
managed or mitigated through appropriate financial management systems and procedures based 
on  double  entry  accounting  systems.  These  will  include  provincial  accounting  modules  linked 
through  cloud-based  internet  capabilities.  It  will  interface  with  MAF’s  accounting  system,  with 
oversight from the PGT. Government staff will be trained in project management. Procurement 
risks are considered moderate as the EA and IAs have experience with ADB procurement using 
national  competitive  procedures.  Given  the  limited  ability  of  DOI  and the  PAFOs  in  consultant 
recruitment following ADB procedures, support will initially be provided to DOI  and the PAFOs 
prior to loan effectiveness by the Procurement and Advance Action Specialists under TRTA 9323, 
and  by  the  Procurement  Specialist  Start-up  Consultant  thereafter.  ADB’s  Anticorruption  Policy 
(1988, as amended to date) was discussed with the government, MAF, DOI, and the PAFOs. With 
increased roles and responsibilities for financial management and procurement at the Province 
level, there is a need to ensure the integrity of planning, approval and disbursement systems to 
avoid  potential  inappropriate  activity.  The  oversight  of  procedures  and  systems  is  essential  to 
ensure that the responsibility of the EA as specified in the loan and grant agreements are adhered 
to. 
Compliance integrity is important, however at the same time those with the responsibility 
20. 
for  operating  and  maintaining  financial  and  procurement  systems  need  to  have  access  to  (i) 
underlying systems that support these requirements, (ii) the skills and experience to operate these 
22 
systems, and (iii) committed management and staff to ensure that the systems are respected and 
applied.  
21. 
A  key  element  of  successful  devolution  of  project  implementation  are  the  systems  to 
manage  governance  risk.  Risk  mitigation  and  management  will  adopt  consistent  systems  and 
supporting capacity to use these systems in tandem. Without both the systems and the capacity 
to use these systems in a coherent and consistent manner, the governance risk could increase, 
and controls could easily fail. 
2. 
Project Governance Team 
22. 
The PGT’s structure is presented in figure 2 below and includes: 
One (1) Team Leader – at least a DDG (DOI) rank;  
(i) 
Two  (2)  managers  -  (i)  planning  and  finance  deputy  head,  and  (ii)  technical 
(ii) 
irrigation development staff member assigned from DOI government staff. (Both 
should be full-time government staff and not contracted staff); 
The  six  supporting  staff positions  are:  two  for  procurement,  two  for  safeguards, 
one for finance, and 1 for planning; and;  
Up to four administrative support staff. 
(iv) 
(iii) 
Figure 2: Organizational Structure for DOI - Program Governance Team 
23. 
The main role for the PGT during establishment will be to define and establish standards 
for project management such as planning, budgeting, reporting, contract management, financial 
management  and  accounting.  The  PGT  will  assist  each  of  the  FNP  to  establish  its  systems, 
prepare  initial  work  plans  and  budgets,  and  thereafter  provide  capacity  support  and  technical 
assistance. The central and provincial LIC will be contracted through five QCBS contracts one for 
23 
each  IA.  See  Annex  2:  Terms  of  Reference  for  LIC  for  detailed  terms  of  reference,  posting 
locations and level of effort. 
24. 
For additional PRI subprojects preparation (around 14 – see Annex 1: Summary of Priority 
Subproject Shortlist) PGT will contract service providers that support FNP in their preparation of 
additional subprojects these will include specialists relating to social impact and social safeguards 
- resettlement and land acquisition requirements.  
The service providers will be mobilized according to annual planning needs as prepared 
25. 
by  each  of  PPIT  teams.  The  PGT  will  ensure  all  safeguards  monitoring  and  reporting  is 
undertaken according to the respective loan and grant agreements using an external independent 
monitoring  contractor.  A  service  provider  will  be  contracted  for  the  translation  of  the  required 
documentation  into  English  i.e.,  bid  evaluation  reports,  safeguards  and  documents  requiring 
approval  from  ADB.  This  will  enable  all  PPIT  work  to  be  undertaken  in  the  Laos  language 
wherever possible and then professionally translated into English for submission documents.  
3. 
Governance and Administrative Roles  
26. 
The  governance  and  administration  roles  will  be  managed  by  the  DDG-1  under  the 
Planning Cooperation Section who will be a government staff member, and who will be assigned 
to the PGT. In this role, they will have a line control reporting to the head of Planning and Finance 
Section  PAFO,  and  a  staffing  role  reporting  to  the  Leader  of  the  PGT.  Key  functions  of  the 
Planning and Finance Division: 
(i) 
Work planning. The work planning templates will be consistent with government 
planning  formats  (for  the  in-kind  contributions)  and  will  have  the  SRIWSM  work 
plan requirements included. Work plan templates will be developed on (i) a whole 
of  project  life  work  plan  at  the  level  of  subproject  and  major  tasks  to  be 
accomplished, (ii) with a more detailed work plan for the first 12 months prepared 
on a monthly and quarterly basis. The “whole project” work plan will be updated 
semi-annually  and  will  be  subject  to  review  two  months  prior  to  the  end  of  the 
planning  period  to  identify  activities  to  be  carried  forward  or  modified.  Work 
planning  will  need  to  account  for  elapsed  times  for  preparing  and  procuring 
services. For example, this will include: 
➢  Quality and Cost-Based Selection (QCBS) for consultants – more than 10 to 
12 months 
➢  Consultant’s  Qualification  Selection  (CQS)  and  individual  recruitment  for 
consultants – 5 to 12 months 
➢  Procurement  of  goods,  equipment,  and  vehicles  –  tendering  3  months, 
RFP/Shopping six (6) weeks 
➢  Design of subprojects 
o  Hydrology assessment - 2 weeks  
o  Water needs and demand agreement - 3 weeks 
o  Design - 5 months 
o  Safeguards - 2 months 
o  Technical design review - 20 days 
o  Detailed subproject design reports - 1 month 
o  Government approvals - 4 weeks 
o  ADB approvals - 4 weeks 
o  Land acquisition and compensation clearance – 3 months 
24 
o  UXO  clearance  certification  –  12  months  for  clearance  work,  and  1 
month for certification of areas with existing clearances 
➢  Bidding documentation - 1.5 months 
➢  Bidding - 1.5 months 
➢  Proposal evaluations - 2 months 
➢  Contracting - 2 weeks 
Financial  Management.  Budgets  will  be  developed  by  each  IA  using  the  work 
planning templates and as defined in the financial management manual (FMM). 
Budgets  will  be  based  on  (i)  contract  award  or  committed  financing  basis  and 
prepared along the requirements of government and ADB as appropriate. Monthly 
cash flows will be prepared. Each IA will need their own work plan and supporting 
budgets.  These  will  be  used  to  develop  contract  award  and  disbursement 
projections for ongoing and new contracts within each budget cycle.  
(ii) 
Procurement systems. Identified in the procurement plan included in this PAM – 
see annex 8. It is not envisaged that the DOI – PGT staff will participate in any of 
the provincial level procurement activities unless specifically instructed to do so by 
the National or Provincial Steering Committee/s and then only in observer status.

Staff/Human Resources 
The following tables (Tables 7-10) provide the current staffing and organization structure 
27. 
of  each  Provincial  IA  -  PAFO.  The  level  of  staffing  and  structures  differ  significantly  between 
provinces  with  the  contract  and  volunteer  staff  roles  now  being  outside  the  Government  Staff 
positions  and  funded  by  donors  or  other  projects.  SRIWSM  will  place  two  positions  into  each 
PAFO  as  contracted  positions.  In  addition,  each  PAFO  identified  a  number  of  additional 
contracted  positions  included  only  those  that  are  essential.  Even  these  roles  will  need  clear 
justification under the Order no: 33 - 2018. The financial management roles and the procurement 
roles  for  the  SRIWSM  will  be  led  by  government  staff  positions  and  the  in-service  financial 
management professional development training opportunities will be limited to Government Staff.

2. 
Provincial Project Implementation Team 
Responsibility  for  Provincial  implementation  was  assigned  by  the  FNP  Governor’s  to 
28. 
PAFO. SRIWSM will be implemented through the existing PAFO structures and staffing under the 
direction  of  either  the  DG  or  a  nominated  DDG.  The  management  will  receive  support  from 
contracted positions (note: these roles will need ratification as part of Order No: 33, 2018 –from 
Ministry of Home Affairs via MAF) and key technical consultant inputs. The PAFO DDG will be 
supported with a Project Management adviser that will ensure the day to day functions and actions 
are  completed  and  that  the  requirement  for  the  use  of  standardized  project  management 
templates are met. The role will have a declining level of input after the first two years. 
29.  Within PAFO, the PPIT will comprise of existing staff in their respective functional roles 
(figure  4)  including  from  the  (i)  planning  and  finance  section  –  for  work  planning,  financial 
management,  procurement,  monitoring  and  reporting,  (ii)  irrigation  section  –  for  detailed 
engineering  design  and  design  approvals,  construction  supervision  and  commissioning,  (iii) 
DALAM for land titling surveying and registration and for Xiangkhouang province for the PLUP 
and land use change program monitoring, (iv) inputs from  technical units for input to crop and 
water planning, agricultural technology demonstrations etc. The key element of the approach is 
that there will be separation between the technical design and the procurement of contractors.  
The terms of reference for the detailed engineering design is in Annex 3: Terms of Reference for 
Detailed Engineering Design. 
The  PPIT  will  report  to  the  Governors’  Offices  as  per  existing  provincial  administrative 
30. 
relationship  but  with  the  addition  of  (i)  a  Provincial  Steering  Committee  that  comprises  of  a 
28 
Governor’s  office  representative  of  no-less  than  a  Vice-Governor,  District  governors  and 
representatives of PONRE, Health and Public Works Offices. 
Figure 4: Provincial– PAFO Project Implementation Team  
31. 
The specific roles are: 
(i) 
Work Planning  
a.  The  head  of  the  planning  and  administration  section  will  be  responsible  for 
assigning  staff  to  the  annual  work  planning  as  per  usual  Government 
procedures.  The  SRIWSM  work  planning  will  be  templated  by  the  PGT  to 
ensure the same format, structure and activity labels are applied by all IAs to 
enable consolidation of the provincial data and alignment of workplans with the 
project accounts. The Planning and Finance section will apply these templates 
along with the procedures outlined in this PAM.  
b.  The initial work planning will be undertaken as a project awareness and training 
session  with  assistance  from  the  project  management  adviser,  and  that  this 
planning would be conducted at the level of monthly inputs including costs, and 
within a whole of project life timeline. The first 12 months will be planned in detail 
by  output,  activity  and  task  with  responsibilities  assigned  to  them  all.  A 
subproject planning and monitoring template is provided in Annex 4 (Subproject 
Planning  and  Monitoring  Template)  that  can  be  used  to  monitor  the 
implementation  and  also  ensuring  that  the  elapsed  time  of  the  approval 
processes is adequately addressed in planning. 
(ii) 
Financial management  
29 
a.  The  head  of  the  planning  and  finance  section  will  assign  two  staff  to  the 
financial management of the project. These individuals were identified during 
project  preparation  and  have  been  given  exposure 
financial 
management  systems  to  be  used.  A  common  accounting  software  platform 
and chart of accounts will be used by all IAs as described in the FMM.  
the 
to 
b.  The  Planning  and  Finance  section  will  be  responsible  for  establishing  and 
maintaining  the  SRIWSM  subaccount  and  its  replenishments,  as  such  it  will 
report  directly  to  the  DDG  PAFO  for  all  matters  including  inappropriate 
purchasing, missing documentation etc. this reporting will be logged within the 
cloud-based management information systems that is linked to PGT, MAF and 
ADB to ensure transparency and accountability.  
c.  The  integration  of  financial  reporting  and  financial  projections  for  contract 
awards  and  disbursements  into  the  monthly  provincial  reporting  and  the 
quarterly project reporting will be one of the core management control points 
and as such, will be submitted by the head of the section to the DDG PAFO 
and the Project Management Advisor both of whom will be required to confirm 
the  report,  add  a  management  response  to  outstanding  issues  and  then 
forward  the  report  to  the  DG  PAFO  Governor  office  and  the  PGT.  Issues 
relating to improper financial management and delayed implementation will be 
the highlighted issues in the monthly reporting frameworks. 
is  support 
(iii)  Monitoring and Reporting. Will be the responsibility of the planning and finance 
for  develop  a  monitoring  system  (a)  project 
section.  There 
implementation efficiency and (b) project effectiveness – (section IX of this PAM). 
The  project  manager  will  ensure  these  systems  are  (i)  established  and  (ii) 
maintained on time and with integrity. The PGT and DOPF will during each year 
conduct governance audits that will review and disclose to MAF, MOF and ADB 
any irregularities in the reporting. Failure to establish reporting and the integrity of 
reporting  as  described  in  the  Project  Management  Manual  will  be  addressed  at 
MTR through the movement of funds to the provinces that do comply resulting in 
the loss of additional subprojects.  
(iv)  Environmental Safeguards.  
a.  The  procedures  within  the  EARF  will  be  applied  to  the  design  and 
implementation  of  additional  subprojects.  For  processing  additional 
subprojects, the PGT (through LIC consultants) will provide technical expertise 
for  screening  and  categorizing  the  subproject  and  then  preparing  the  due 
diligence reports or if required the IEE/EMP. Implementation monitoring of the 
EMP to PAFO will be the responsibility of PONRE.  
b.  The Provincial Steering Committee will ensure that there is a MOU between 
PAFO  and  PONRE  for  this  input  –  the  SRIWSM  provide  the  allowances  to 
cover  the  operating  costs  of  PONRE.  PONRE  will  receive these  allowances 
based  on  (i)  50%  on  agreement  to  conduct  the  work  and  (ii)  the  remainder 
based on reports submitted. Failure to report will be reported by the PAFO to 
the PSC seeking an explanation and remedial responses. All such reports will 
be filed within the dropbox management information systems and shared with 
PGT who will seek confirmation that the issues have been addressed.  
30 
(v) 
Social  safeguards  monitoring.  Is  assigned  to  a  Government  staff  member  of 
PAFO  who  will  be  supported  by  the  PGT  based  LIC  experts.  All  monitoring  will 
ensure that the provisions of the LARP are identified, confirmed and reported in a 
timely basis. The monitoring will also conduct confirmation meetings with adversely 
affected  households  and  the  findings  of  these  will  be  included  in  the  monthly 
reports. The social safeguard position is a new contract staff position in the PAFO 
– PPIT that will work closely with the external monitoring team, provide day to day 
review and input to the project implementation to ensure best practice as defined 
in the REGDF and LARP are established and applied in the RSPs. A key role of 
the  social  safeguard  role  will  be  to  identify  issues  and  ensure  that  these  are 
responded to in a timely and correct manner. 
(vi)  Gender.  The  PAFO  will  appoint  a  gender  focal  point  from  the  Women’s 
Advancement Unit that will be responsible for ensuring all project stakeholders are 
fully aware of the GAP and its provisions, ensure that the GAP is implemented and 
reported accordingly.  
(vii)  Land Acquisition and Compensation. PAFO will assign a person from DALAM 
to Land Acquisition and compensation as per the provisions of the REGDF. This 
role  will  ensure  that  the  administrative  requirements  of  the  LARP  are  expedited 
accordingly based on the required procedures and timelines. 
32. 
To implement Output 4 in Houaphan and Xiangkhouang,the PAFO will be responsible 
for the collection and integration of the contractors monitoring data within the SRIWSM quarterly 
progress  reports.  The  Provincial  Steering  Committee  and  PAFO  will  need  to  establish  the 
institutional linkages between Output 4 and the respective output 1 through 3 in terms of capacity 
building and convergence of nutrition sensitive agriculture into the wider Project.  
IV. 
OUTPUT 1 ARRANGEMENTS 
33. 
Under Output 1, the PPIT will have a contracted staff role for agribusiness support. This 
role will not be an ex-Government staff member but will have commercial and market experience 
and training. The role shall work closely with the LIC agribusiness experts (withiin the DOI LIC 
team) in conducting market assessments, market connectivity, quality assurance programs, farm 
to  farm  extension  services.  The  Provincial  Plant  Protection  Center  will  be  responsible  for 
implementation of the promotion of LAOGAP including Pesticide Reduction Training through the 
MAF Plant Protection Center, and grants administration and award programs as defined in the 
Project Management Manual and with support from the LIC experts. 
34. 
Output  1  will  be  implemented  through  the  proposed  agribusiness  contracted  staff 
positions, and the LIC agribusiness advisors. The output represents a substantial change in the 
direction  of  the  current  thinking  and  skill  sets  within  PAFO.  The  design  envisages  using  the 
SRIWSM as a means of building increased knowledge and linkages between the public sector 
and the private sector that underpin commercial agriculture. It does not foresee major roles for 
PAFO in the decision-making of market chains with their role limited to connectivity and quality 
assurance  functions  (Supplementary  Report  –  Output  1  Design  Document  for  a  detailed 
description of all activities and implementation details). 
35. 
The  proposed  investment  will  develop  the  market  connections  between  irrigation  and 
upland farmers, and higher value markets for their dry season products. Farmers will be assisted 
to  plan  and  produce  their  dry  season  crops  and  livestock  on  the  upgraded  irrigated  schemes 
based  upon  better  information  about  market  demand,  quality  requirements,  and  prices.  Better 
31 
market  connections  will  consist  of:  (i)  identified  market  demand  with  associated  producer 
connections, logistic services, information flows, post-harvest agri-enterprise, trader and retailer 
relationships; (ii) once opportunities in the market are identified, additional investment is required 
into  on-farm  technology,  farmer  learning  about  new  production  technologies,  pesticide 
management  including  pesticide  reduction  training  and  where  necessary  Integrated  Pest 
Management through the Provincial and District Plant Protection Centers including agrochemical 
handling  and  application;  (iii)  value  creation  and  quality  assurance  with  certification  and 
traceability through LAOGAP. 
36. 
Some  investment  opportunity  may  be  identifed  during the  output  2  watershed  land  use 
planning programs within Houaphan and Xieng Khuoang provinces that require a wider subsector 
or commodity based response that will be addressed through output 1. For example investment 
in  Xingkhouang  tea  market  connections  and  agribusiness  development  will  concentrate  upon 
developing market connections for better quality wet season produced and processed tea that 
will  be  sold  at  higher  prices.  Farmers  will  be  assisted  to  grow,  and  harvest,  a  better-quality 
product,  and  processing  quality  will  be  enhanced  through  improved  techniques  using  more 
modern equipment.  Tea marketing cooperation and coordination among the Phousan tea agri-
enterprises will ensure the tea meets higher quality certified standards and is marketed to higher 
value markets. Marketing and market development may occur under the proposed Lao Tea brand, 
or a more specific Phousan mountain tea brand. By building wider market connections and value 
adding the tea producers in Nam Tong RSP watershed will be able to benefit from reduced market 
risk and expanded market opportunities. 
A.  Market-led Strategy 
The  strategy  is  for  a  market-led  approach  for  both  DSIA  products  and  upland  crops 
37. 
encompasses: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
(v) 
(vi) 
farmers and agri-enterprises supported to strengthen and develop existing market 
connection and agribusiness relationships; 
farmers and agri-enterprises have better information about market, and emerging 
market opportunities; 
agri-enterprises and small village-based processors are assisted to create value 
through processing and quality assurance; 
irrigation farmers are assisted to produce HVC and livestock in response to market 
demand; 
upland farmers and agri-enterprises partners producing, processing and marketing 
HVC such as quality tea for the local and export markets; and 
a  clearer  direction  over  market  development  for  the  agribusiness  sector  and 
functional provincial agencies. 
38. 
For RSPs detailed implementation programs have been prepared (Supplementary report 
Output 1 - Design Document and has outlined the roles for the additional subprojects). Integration 
or  interfacing  with  both  the  proposed  collaborative  co-financed  projects  being  (i)  Deutsche 
Gesellschaft  fur  Internationale  Zusammenarbeit  (GIZ/GCF)  Catchment  management  and 
emissions  reduction,  and  the  (ii)  International  Fund  for  Agriculture  Development  (IFAD) 
Partnerships for commercial agriculture will need to be defined and agreed and then incorporated 
into the PAM as an amendment to the implementation arrangements.   
39. 
Currently it is proposed that ADB finance all output 1 activities for all subprojects. If the 
timing  of  the  IFAD  parallel  financing  program  effectiveness  is  aligned  to  the  ADB  SRIWSM 
32 
financing for output 1 and for the water user group capacity building program will switch to IFAD 
and ADB funds will be reallocated to PRI investments. 
40. 
Output 1 will involve: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
(v) 
(vi) 
Market  assessments  for  each  subproject  based  on  developing  (i)  existing 
commodity market chains, (ii) confirming markets for other opportunities identified 
by growers, DAFO, PAFO or the private sector. 
Based  on  the  market  assessment  develop  a  market-led  strategy  for  the  project 
producers through linking producers to markets either directly or through logistic 
agents and information platforms 
Establish a grants program for producers and enterprises that are directly linked 
to  the  market  opportunities  and  have  supporting  business  plans  prepared  with 
input from the agribusiness advisors.  
Establish  a  network  of  farm  to  farm,  backward  linkage  and  project  to  project 
extension programs that support the market-led response of farmers including the 
use of farm-based demonstrations.  
LAOGAP and quality assurance programs linked to the market assessments and 
including environmental and social safeguard mitigation programs that manage the 
risks of agrichemical use in HVC production including pesticide reduction training.  
Support  strategic  commodities  such  as  the  (i)  Phousan  tea  sector  to  develop  a 
cohesive marketing strategy with support provided to small holders to link into this 
strategy  through  first  step  processing  and  value  addition,  (ii)  Livestock  for  the 
China  and  Viet  Nam  market  through  the  provision  of  fodder  demonstrations, 
livestock handling and weighing equipment, etc. 
B. 
Grants Program 
41. 
Output 1 will provide a limited number of grants for producers or small enterprises linked 
to the market assessment and opportunities therein. There are two types of grants: (i) producer 
and enterprise small grants; and (ii) strategic market chain grants that seek to provide a catalyst 
to  overcome  specific  market  chain  bottlenecks  or  capture  opportunities.  The  following  section 
outlines the procedures for the grant programs. 
Guidelines  for  the  implementation  of  the  grants  will  be  prepared  by  the  Agribusiness 
42. 
Specialist  in  the  DOI  LIC.  The  guidelines  will  vary  in  accordance  with  needs  of  the  specific 
commodity or grant purpose. The guidelines will include: (i) selection criteria, (ii) accounting and 
auditing procedures, and (c) monitoring mechanism of activities. The guidelines will be reviewed 
and approved by ADB prior to disbursement. The accounting of grant awards will be through the 
accounting packages established in each Province which already have embedded in the chart of 
accounts, activities code structure. Disbursement guidelines are based on an initial advance and 
then the remainder of funds will be released in accordance with the guidelines and will include (i) 
site visits by the PPIT, (ii) supporting documentation for the purchases, (iii) processing of these 
by the PAFO financial management team. 
The eligibility and targeting of grants is outlined in the following table. These criteria and 
43. 
conditions apply for all enterprise level grants within outputs 1 and 2 where required.  
33 
General Features: The PPIT Agribusiness Advisor will develop and implement the grants 
44. 
program for PAFO. The PSC has discretion to exceed the indicated funding limits by 15% based 
on  the  proposals  received.  If the  PAFO requires  an  increase to the  maximum  amounts,  it  can 
seek  prior  approval  with  the  PGT/  MAF  and  the  ADB  with  a  supporting  document  that  clearly 
demonstrates the benefits to the Project outcome. 
45. 
General Grant Conditions: All grants will be competitive, and all enterprise and producer 
grant  applications  must  meet  the  following  basic  requirement:    (i)  Business  plan  that  is  both 
feasible and viable and must include: (a) statement of financial assets and liabilities; (b) financial 
analysis of the proposed investments; (c) cash flow projection for the proposed investment; (d) 
details of the source of funds contributed by the investor, and financing details for any loans; (e) 
technical  assessment  of  the  proposed  investment  activity;  (f)  risk  analysis  covering  market, 
financial  and  production  risks;  (ii)  Innovation  or  market  added  value  contribution  may  also  be 
included  in  the  business  plan.  The  full  format  of  the  business  plan  for  each  type  of  grant  is 
attached as an appendix. 
46. 
The use of a matching grant award system is proposed for all grants. Due to the application 
nature of the grants the administration of funds will be based on an initial advance of 30% and 
the remainder on presentation of supporting documentation, have a PPIT staff member confirm 
the presence and implementation of the grant proceeds that will be notified in writing to the DG 
PAFO.  This  will  trigger  the  remaining  grant  balance  to  be  disbursed  from  the  Provincial

with 
SRIWSM will support the demonstration of new and modern technologies as a means of 
50 
increasing both water and labor productivity within the irrigated agriculture sector.  
51. 
These technologies will be based on (i) digital technologies that reduce labor input, and 
increase the  precision  of  water  user, (ii)  support the  integration  of  irrigation  with nontraditional 
cropping systems such as out of season production under shade or rain cover, the use of trickle 
irrigation of command area margins for high value fruit crops and along irrigation infrastructure to 
establish permanent land use such as horticultural tree crops as a means to stabilize and protect 
irrigation canals.  
Specifically  the  project  is  providing  support  to  the  four  representative  subporjects  to 
52. 
demonstrate technology relating to: 
(i)  phone based control of gates – these may be offtake gates to avoid flood flows, they may 
be control gates within the command area to management water distribution to reduce 
the labor cost of scheme operation.  
(ii)  Integration of phone based water control (including pipe offtake lines as in Nam Poua or 
distribution canals as in other RSP) with soil moisture meters to deliver irrigation water 
that is not surplus to demand 
(iii) The integration of solar pumping, header tanks and trickle/spray irrigation systems with 
covered  out  of  season  production  that  enables  existing  HVC  producer  to  extend  their 
production  seasons  into  higher  price  periods  of  the  year  and  also  to  increase  quality 
control functions. The systems here would enable phone based control of irrigation linked 
to  soil  moisture  meters  /  tensiometers  such  that  the  daily  labor  requirement  for  water 
management is minimized.  
(iv) The use of modern technology (solar pumping and trickle based irrigation to support HVC 
crops  outside  of  the  irrigation  command  area  including  the  stabilization  of  land  use 
adjacent  to  canals  and  headworks  through  irrigation  of  high  value  perennial  or  semi-
perennial tree crops.  
Access to these funds is based on water user demand and then the technical support from 
53. 
the  SRIWM  PAFO  teams  and  LIC.    A  total  of  $275,000  is  budgeted  for  each  representative 
subproject site only.  
Each demonstration will be discussed and designed with WUGs with the international and 
54. 
national water resource management experts providing oversight and planning of the proposed 
demonstrations. The design will be provided by PIS in PAFO at no direct cost to the demonstration 
fund, while any procurement will be undertaken by the PPIT in conjunction with the land user. No 
land use or labour costs will be financed. The host of the demonstration will have the advantage 
of regular technical input and access to the potential benefits.  
38 
A  demonstration  site  will  not  exceed  0.4  ha  and  needs  to  be  sized  according  to  labor

availability and the need to control technology. O&M input to the demonstration will be by the land 
owner, according to a detailed demonstration plan agreed with the LIC and PPIT staff. Monitoring 
and technical support will be provided for the first two years of operation after which the equipment 
and or facilities will transfer to the land owner. The demonstration sites these must be within the 
RSP command areas or hydraulically linked to the command area. Each site will develop a land 
owner  agreement,  a  supporting  memorandum  of  understanding,  and  detailed  implementation 
plan that is agreed by the water resource management expert, the agribusiness experts, head of 
PIS and the DDG PAFO.  
56. 
Each  site  will  have  a  detailed  farming  systems  performance  monitoring  system  that 
includes biophysical and soil fertility characteristics, costs of capital, water use and soil moisture 
records  from  tensiometers  for  the  production  season  and  non-production  season,  crop 
productivity, labor demand, and financial performance. All data will be available for sharing with 
local farming groups either form within the command area or from nearby irrigation systems.  PPIT 
will  organise  demonstration  days  during  crop  establishment,  crop  growth  stages  and  then  at 
harvest time to introduce the achievements to other farmers.  
D. 
Investment Master Plan Preparation 
Funds are included for the preparation of a sector master plan with supporting investment 
57. 
program. The SRIWSM will work with the EA to (i) finalise the draft terms of reference appended 
to the PAM, (ii) contract the required research or diagnostic studies, (iii) support the processes 
for prioritising options and the structuring of the proposed investment plan. MAF will form a cross 
subsector working group that will be provide oversight and guidance to the PGT in the conduct of 
the  program.  The  output  will  be  required  to  support  the  proposed  financing  of  a  multi-tranche 
program  that  addresses  the  agreed  priorities  and  will  in  some  instances  be  implemented  by 
agencies other than DOI or even outside of MAF. 
58. 
The master planning will be led by the MAF task force under the coordination of the DOI 
Planning Unit. SRIWSM will provide support for research and data analysis that will be identifeid 
by the MAF task force and then procured through SRIWSM – DOI PGT. The LIC Team Leader 
will  provide  techncial  support  to  the  DOI  Planning  Unit  unless  an  alternative  arrangement  is 
requested by MAF, ADB or the National Steering Committee. The DOI PLAnning Unit and the LIC 
Team  Leader  will  ensure  that  work  is  completed  within  20  months  of  project  effectiveness  by 
ensuring  that  contracted  studies  and the  supporting  processes  are maintained  and  completed 
according to the timelines in the contracts. Responsibility for the production of the final plan is 
assigned to the MAF task force attacehd to the DOI planning unit.  
E. 
GAP Quality Assurance and Farm Extension 
59. 
Instituting quality assurance systems is also part of Output 1. The Project will develop a 
quality  assurance  system that  is  based  upon  LaoGAP. Implementation of  LaoGAP  will  require 
PAFO to be assisted by the Department of Agriculture in MAF including the plant protection center 
for  providing  training  in  pesticide  reduction  and  supporting  IPM  activities  if  pest  surveillance 
indicates this need. This will include farmer and trader training in LaoGAP and compliance with 
the regulations. The project is providing $18,000 per WUA for LAO GAP training over a 3-year 
period and a further $27,000 per subproject for support WUGs for farm based extension programs 
including training.  
39 
The  LIC  Agribusiness  Advisers  will  assist  PAFO  with  quality  assurance  system 
60. 
implementation by working with safe vegetable retailers, and their customers, to recognize and 
accept LaoGAP as reliable safe food quality standard. These retailers will have been identified in 
the market assessment. 
61. 
Farmers  will  be  supported  to  plan  their  dry  season  farming  to  better  align  with  market 
demand for HVCs. The dry season cropping plans will involve water scheduling plans that will be 
prepared with the WUG/WUA. The farmers will also be assisted with new technical production 
techniques and knowledge, and specialized input will be mobilized for this. Included with this will 
be the need to address the risks arising from intensification and the use of agrichemicals. Under 
the LaoGAP program there is a requirement for safe food which will mean knowledge of pesticide 
reduction techniques.  LaoGAP  is  implemented  through  the  Department  of  Agriculture  with  the 
Lao GAP standards approved as part of the ASEAN GAP standards under the ASEAN Economic 
Community  2015  Agreement.  These  standards  include  (i)  adoption  of  food  quality  standards 
linked  to  identified  market  requirements,  (ii)  food  safety  standards  including  residues  and 
handling,  (iii)  Environmental  protection  including  agrichemical  management  and  nutrient 
management systems, and (iv) occupational health and safety requirements. 
62. 
The LIC Agribusiness Advisers, PPIT Agribusiness staff will mobilize resources to support 
programs for farmers in designing production plans based on market demand and prices. This 
data will initially be from the market assessment, and then from the Market Information Application 
and other sources.   
63. 
Farmer-to-farmer  extension  for  production  knowledge  learning  will  be  supported  along 
with the mobilization of existing programs from the Plant Protection Center for pesticide reduction 
training.  Other  short-term  technical  specialists  may  also  be  contacted  e.g  for  in-field  irrigation 
technologies.  Farmer skills development will commence in Project Year 2 (2021) and the farmer-
to-farmer  extension  will  target  the  least  experienced  dry  season  irrigation  farmers.  The  more 
experienced DSIA farmers will be provided with more advanced technical advice as required over 
the subsequent two seasons that if required integrates IPM Farmer Field Schools in their training. 
V. 
OUTPUT 2 ARRANGEMENTS 
A. 
PLUP Planning 
64. 
In  Xiangkhouang  and  Houaphan,  the  respective  PPIT  will  be  responsible  for  PLUP 
planning for up to 37 villages in the  nine catchments linked to the output 3 subproject command 
areas. Each PLUP will be funded as a lump-sum of approximately $3,000 that will cover all costs 
of staff and the associated processes. Implementation of the land use change programs will be 
through  the  usual  planning  and  procurement  systems  as  described  in  the  Procurement  Plan. 
DALAM will be required to monitor the land use change activities on a quarterly basis as an input 
to  the  finalization  of  the  community  agreements  in  terms  of  establishing  temporary  land  use 
certificates for village land and individual land titles for production land that is maintained. PONRE 
will issue land titles as part of the wider PONRE MoU that details services and fees for services 
that PONRE will deliver to SRIWSM.  
65. 
Output  2  will  be  implemented  in  Houaphan  and  Xiangkhouang  provinces  only  and  the 
scope of the investment is defined by the number of PRI subprojects that is currently expected to 
be  nine (see Table 2 for the proposed processing batches and the timing of these and Annex 1 
for a summary of each of the screened PRI subprojects). The program seeks to update land use 
plans  for  communities  within  the  PRI  catchments  that  will  identify  areas  of  land  use  that  are 
40 
inconsistent with soil and water protection. Through the process of planning, specific land uses 
that are inconsistent will be identified and options for offsetting or incentivizing land use change 
will be identified and supported to complete the land use change. The Output 2 description for 
Nam Tong Catchment is presented in Supplemental Document – Output 2 Design Document. 
66. 
As subprojects are identified and then confirmed within the annual PPIT work plans, the 
PPIT  will  also  initiate  the  upper  catchment  planning  process that  will  be  included  in  the  same 
annual work plan. Within PAFO, the staff of DALAM and Forestry Section and Land Use Planning 
Department (FSALUPD) will be responsible for the planning of the catchment and its land users. 
PAFO  will  be  resourced  in  lump-sum  arrangements  consistent  with  current  charges  for  other 
PLUP planning processes. The funds will be advanced at 70% in advance and 30% on provision 
of their final report.  
67. 
The process will include the team of trained land use planning staff and addition staff from 
livestock, forestry, agriculture as required. The land use planning team will initiate socio-economic 
baseline  data  survey  supported  by  the  LIC  consultant  to  confirm  the  number  of  villages, 
households  and  population.  During  the  planning  process,  the  planners  will  work  closely  with 
villagers to identify inappropriate land uses, options for offsetting the land use through incentive 
for land use change including local households and what options that can be identified through a 
process of household and community/village level negotiations that conclude with a community 
agreement that identifies who will change, what land use behaviours will change to what preferred 
options, and the required inputs and how these will be delivered and monitored. A core part of the 
community agreement is to move land from exploitative use into the revegetating forest category. 
The  PLUP  will  be  the  basis  to  initiate  the  implementation  of  this  output.   Where  PLUP 
68. 
already exists, the team will review and update the plan and then extend the planning into the 
behavioural change program. Where plans do not exist, new plans will be prepared along with 
the supporting land use change program. The detailed implementation process  is presented in 
Figure 5 below. 
Figure 5: PLUP Planning Process 
41 
B. 
Land Use Change Investment 
69. 
The  identification  of  alternative  activities  that  project  could  support  to  incentivize  the 
change  behaviour  is  the  key  question  to  discuss  with  villagers.  The  possible  options  are 
agroforestry,  soil  conservation  cultivation  practices,  livestock  promotion,  income  generation, 
water retention check dam building, micro- irrigation development, orchard development, forest 
conservation. Where community agreements are in place and the land use change is successfully 
implemented along with the proposed changes being maintained, the village is eligible for land 
use titling as an incentive to maintain their resources. The Project will provide addition technical 
assistance  for  land  use  management  and  community  agreement  development  within  the 
Xiangkhouang PPIT.   
Procurement for Output 2 land change activities will be defined on the proposed land use 
70. 
change programs as part of the PLUP approval. The approval process will require PLUP to be 
ratified by the village leadership, approved by the District Governor, and Provincial PAFO.  
Once approved, the land use change program will be included in the annual work plan for 
71. 
the project and then implemented. It is important that the PAFO DALAM Land Use Planning teams 
initiate the PLUP processes for all catchments within the 3rd quarter of Project year 1 such that 
the above planning system and the required approvals will be completed within 12 months. The 
land use change programs will not start before project year 3 and will require 3 years to implement. 
Any  PLUP  not  approved  by  the  end  of  the  2nd  quarter  of  project  year  4  will  not  be  eligible  for 
funding from ADB. All procurement will be through the ADB procedures in the procurement plan 
mostly  using  request  for  quotations  systems  due  to  the  size  of  packages.  The  exception  will 
generally be works packages over about $100,000 that will use open competitive bidding (OCB). 
C. 
Catchment and Land Use Behavior Change Studies 
The catchments of Louangphabang and Xaignabouli province subprojects are both large 
72. 
and often involve a complex array of current land uses that are organized within equally complex 
land  use  arrangements  and  institutional  settings  that  are  both  formal  and  informal.  These 
complexities  add  significant  challenges  to  achieving  effective  land  use  change  and  provide 
challenges far more complex that being addressed through community based land use planning 
principles within the PLUP process.  
73. 
In Louangphabang and Xaignabouli  provinces these catchment issues are increasingly 
widespread  with  current  policy  and  regulatory  frameworks  seemingly  unable  to  address 
inappropriate  land  use  in  an  effective  manner.  The  SRIWSM  seeks  to  develop  a  deeper 
understanding  of  these  issues  with  the  purpose  of  informing  future  policy  and  investment 
decisions including the likely costs and trade-offs required to achieve more sustainable land use 
with sustainable ecologicla services.  
74. 
Two such catchments – Nam Nan in Louangphabang and Nam Poui in Xaignabouli will 
be part of land use research pilot studies. The project has budgeted for the two studies – to be 
either contracted collectively or individually with a total budget of $360,000.  
75. 
The purpose of these pilots will be to understand the requirements of achieving a land use 
behavior  change  outcome  that  supports  the  long  term  sustainability  of  land  use  in  the  two 
catchments including:

D. 
Unexploded Ordinance 
76. 
All subproject sites need to be certified clear of UXO before any project activities can be 
undertaken.  Each  Provincial  Governors  Office  will  be  required  to  provide  a  Government 
declaration to this effect. It is assumed, but not certain, that existing command areas are cleared 
of UXO, however in Xiangkhouang output 2 for catchment works there will need to be clearance 
due  diligence.  All  UXO  will  be  the  responsibility  of  the  government  through  the  National 
Regulatory Authority for UXO / Mine Action Sector in Lao (UXONRA). Te UXONRA requires a 12-
month  planning  window  for  any  clearance  work  and  as  such  each  Province  should  notify  the 
UXONRA before March 2019 that their subproject sites need clearance. 
VI.

proposed crops. The  design team  must  provide  direct  evidence  that  the WUG  and  water  user 
associations (WUAs) have input to the design requirements prior to the preliminary design and 
must address (i) within command area access, (ii) water management and control in the command 
areas that enables the water scheduling to be achieved, (iii) alignments are responsive to existing 
plot  boundaries,  residential  areas,  and  other  infrastructure,  (iv)  addition  PRI  is  included  in  the 
designs including road upgrades, bridge or access, etc. that is prioritized within the Social Impact 
Assessment (SIA). If the additional subprojects’ SIA priorities are not responded to, the subproject 
is NOT ELIGIBLE FOR FINANCING. Further, any road access with loose aggregate or laterite 
surfaces is not to be financed from ADB.  
78. 
Specific  attention  will  be  paid to the  requirement  of  women  and  technologies  that save 
time  including  access  and  use  of  piped  irrigation,  automated  systems  for  accessing  water 
including the use of phone or internet-based control systems, the inclusion of trickle spray or drip 
systems that do not require full time presence in the command area when water is available.  The 
PPIT Gender focal point will ensure that the PIS design team respond to the social needs of water 
users, especially women. 
79. 
PIS will provide the final report for the subproject design and submit this to the PSC for 
review and approvals. The head of the irrigation section is to be accountable for the completion 
of  the  SIA,  the  IEE  and  LARP  according  to  the  requirements  of  the  loan  agreements  and  this 
PAM. Subprojects will need to demonstrate detailed operational and maintenance costs and will 
not be eligible for funding if the Irrigation Service Fee (ISF) cannot support these costs.

Fish Passage 
80. 
All  14  additional  subprojects  will  be  assessed for the  potential  benefits  of  incorporating 
fish passes into river weirs and headworks. Where a new weir or headworks is to be constructed 
(including  the  replacement  of  existing  structures)  all  designs  will  incorporate  provision  for  fish 
passage. PAFO - Irrigation Section management will ensure that these subprojects are assessed 
by LARREC which will assess site requirements, local fish species and their passage needs and 
provide indicative designs to the PIS engineering section for inclusion in their detailed design of 
structures and cost estimates.  
81. 
ADB  will  finance  (budget  provision  $225,000)  these  incremental  costs  for  site  based 
assessments and needs along with the cost of the fish passage ways for up to  nine passages (at 
an  incremental  cost  of  $25,000  each)  structures  being    two  in  Louangphabang,  three  in 
Xiangkhouang, three in Houaphan, and one in Xaignabouli. If required, additional inputs will be 
46 
financed  through  the  additional  subproject  financing  line  to  be  accessed  through  the  detailed 
engineering design process.   
82. 
To support the institutionalization of fish passage within irrigation and flood river structures 
the Project will finance the training and mentoring of engineering design staff within the Provincial 
Irrigation  Section  of  PAFO  in  the  (i)  assessment  of  fisheries  needs  through  instream  surveys, 
community  consultation,  and  wider  fisheries  data  sets,  (ii)  identification  and  defining  the  fish 
passage needs of local species including the specific design needs to be integrated within a fish 
passage  to  increase  effectiveness,  (iii)  engineering  design  input  to  fish  passage  –  setting  the 
appropriate  standards,  and  design  specifications  for  specific  fishery  needs,  (iv)  construction 
oversight, (vi) fish passage monitoring.  
A budget line (USD 240,000) is included specifically for this training that will be organized 
83. 
by  PAFO  with  assistance  from  the  Project  Management  Advisor  to  ensure  the  participation  of 
LARREC and their technical assistance provided by ACIAR. It is envisaged that the project will 
cost share the training with the Project financing participation, field costs and resource materials. 
ACIAR will design the course and ideally have the course acknowledged as a formal accreditation. 
ACIAR  participation  is  envisaged  to  be  provided  through  their  budget  but  this  needs  to  be 
confirmed.  
B. 
Proposed Fish Passage Masterclass 
1. 
Proposed Participants 
This course is designed for biologists, engineers and natural resource managers who are 
85. 
responsible for implementing effective fish passage programs for upstream migrating fish. The 
course  will  largely  focus  on  the  challenges  of  providing  upstream  fish  passage  at  irrigation 
infrastructure, with particular focus on Laos. The SRIWSM project will support the PIS irrigation 
engineers  to  complete  the  course  along  with  in-field  mentoring  during  planning,  design  and 
construction as well as operational efficacy reviews.  
2.

3. 
Main Learning Modules 
(i)  Module 1 Introduction: This module will provide a fundamental grounding in what 
fish  passage  is  and  the  engineering  process  to  follow,  including  fish  passage 
ecology and river hydrology.  
(ii)  Module 2 Preparing for Fish Passage Design: This module will focus on the two 
main  areas  of  fishway  design;  (a)  Developing  knowledge  on  target  species  (b) 
47 
Identifying the location of the entrance. There will be a distinct focus on students 
preparing design specifications for a fishway in their home country. 
(iii) Module 3 Developing Fish Passage Options: This module will focus on the many 
different  fishway  types  available,  their  advantages  and  disadvantages,  how  to 
select the right one for a given location and basic criteria methods for sizing them 
to a site. Students will be required to design their own fishway customized to a site 
of their choosing. 
(iv)  Module  4  Construction:    This  module  will  provide  a  grounding  in  construction 
oversight and contractor management. The principles of good construction will be 
introduced and the importance of inspections, along with the ability to understand 
how to negotiate variations that do not limit fishway effectiveness 
4. 
Overall goal 
Upon  completion  of  this  masterclass  all  students  will  have  a  grounding  in  the  basic 
87. 
fundamentals of fishway design, the various options available and how to make an effective and 
efficient  design.  Additionally,  for  the  sites  evaluated  in  class,  students  will  have  selected  and 
performed the initial design of a fishway.   Utilizing the information gained in class, students would 
then use the principles of each module to (1) prepare, (2) design, and (3) construct a fishway in 
Laos. 
C. 
Representative Subprojects 
88. 
Due diligence and subproject preparation (including detailed engineering design) for four 
RSPs  was  completed  during  project  preparation.  These  include  small  riparian  zone  schemes 
typical  of  many  FNP  irrigation  schemes  being  (i)  Nam  Pua  in  Houapahn  that  is  an  intensively 
cropped command area of 70ha, partially cropped with high value crops in the dry season using 
furrow irrigation and plastic mulch, and (ii) Nam Tong Xiangkhouang, a cascaded series of weirs 
supporting  riparian  zone  command  areas  that  currently  produce  wet  season  rice  but  is  mostly 
own grazed stubble for the dry season. A new command area in Nam Seng Louangphabang that 
develops  an  additional  265  ha  of  irrigation  for  wet  and  dry  season  cropping  within  an  existing 
undeveloped scheme. Updated command area water control infrastructure on a large wet and dry 
season cropping irrigation scheme that will provide additional choices to grow new crops including 
green  soyabean  in  Nam  Phieng  1  and  2  Xaignabouli  (subproject  design  reports  available  on 
request).  Training  will  be  provided  on  integrated  pest  management  and  the  application  and 
handling of agrichemicals as appropriate to the crops. 
D. 
Additional Subprojects 
89. 
The following table presents a summary of additional PRI subprojects by province which 
indicates  the  number  likely  to  be  implemented  in  each  province.  Each  year,  each  province  is 
expected  to  design  one  additional  subproject  and  implement  the  subproject  designed  in  the 
previous  year.  Details  of  each  subproject  are  presented  in  Annex  1  –  Summary  of  Priority 
Subproject Shortlist.

Processing Additional Subprojects  
a. 
Approach  
90. 
The SRIWSM will use a modified detailed design process rather than the previous process 
of a feasibility study followed by a detailed design process due to (i) the cost, and (ii) the elapsed 
time to conduct and get approval for both studies and the resultant delays. All engineering design 
and survey work for the additional subprojects (ASPs) will be provided by the PIS or Provincial 
Public Works and Transport Department for non-irrigation infrastructure. The project preparation 
findings  are  that  there  is  adequate  technical  engineering  capability  within  each  Province.  The 
major gap is the ability to identify needs-based PRI requirements i.e., what is to be designed and 
the decision process by which this is decided as opposed to technical design input.  
91. 
The  preparation  of  the  DED’s  and  supporting  subproject  feasibility  study  (FD)  will  be 
included in the project annual work plans for the PIS according to the implementation schedule.  
At the provincial level this schedule will be used to form a work plan for all ASP designs according 
to  the  prioritization  (see  Annex  1).  The  Head  of  the  PIS  will  have  the  responsibility  for  PRI 
subproject designs and will report monthly to the PAFO DDG.  
92. 
Processing of ASPs will be undertaken in two batches. Batch one includes the 4 RSPs. 
Batch two will include 2 ASPs per province to be designed in Project Year 2.  For Batch three in 
Project Year 3  Xiangkhouang and Xaignabouli provinces will have 2 subprojects to process whilst 
Houaphan and Louangphabang will have 1 ASP to design. All subprojects that are to be financed 
by ADB need to have approved designs by the end of Project Year 3 if they are to be implemented 
using ADB financing.  
The SRIWSM midterm review (MTR) is scheduled in March 2023. If any province is unable 
93. 
to  achieve  the  required  time  lines,  funds  assigned  for  that  Provincial  program  will  be 
recommended  for  reallocation  that  will  be  agreed  and  documented  within  the  MOU,  and  any 
reallocated funds will still require an approved design before mid-year 4.  
94. 
ASP preparation will be undertaken by PAFO staff with the PIS leading the DED for the 
prioritized list of ASPs (see Annex 1).  The design process will be initiated by the DDG – PAFO 
and  the  Head  of  PIS  -  who  will  establish  a  subproject  DED  and  FS  team  from  within  PAFO, 
assigning  expertise  from  the  different  sections  (Annex  3:  Terms  of  Reference  for  Detailed 
Engineering Design). An important requirement is to ensure all maps, drawings are georeferenced 
and include the entire scheme including beyond the command area and that these are integrated 
with an up to date cadastre map.  
95. 
The first  step  is to conduct  water  users  interviews  and then consult WUGs,  the  private 
sector, and agricultural specialists. From these consultations, the agribusiness advisors from the 
PGT  will  work  with  the  agribusiness  contracted  staff  position  in  each  PAFO  to  conduct  rapid 
49 
market assessments and develop a market linkage plan. Based on the water user consultations 
and the market assessments, potential farming systems and cropping patterns will be prepared 
in consultation with WUGs.  
Concurrently a hydrological assessment will be made including the gathering of supporting 
96. 
meteorological records, flow data, historical irrigated areas, farmer indication of high and low flow 
records data. A summary hydrological model will be developed and included in the design as part 
of input to water scheduling to specify available water. Note the specification of Qmax is important 
in terms of a P1 (1 in 100 yr exceedance frequency  – based on the historical record) estimate 
which is used for all in stream structures and canal offtake protection works. Qmin or minimum 
flows  are required to ensure  the  conditions  of the EARF and  the  environmental minimum flow 
rates are observed.  
97.  Where the expected off take will result in the environmental flow rates falling below 30%, 
PONRE must be asked to review the hydrological records. It is important to note that the Qmin 
flow rates may have little relevance to the cropping pattern and water offtake unless the timing of 
Qmin coincides with the irrigation schedule for the crops. In most case minimum flow rate occurs 
significantly after the last irrigation for the first dry season crop. As such the shape of the recession 
hydrograph and the timing of the last irrigation within the recession phase is the point at which 
the  minimum  environmental  flow  should  be  estimated.  Crop  choices,  sowing  dates  and  water 
deficit  irrigation  systems  can  be  used to moderate the  effects  of  dry  years,  and the IWMI flow 
research suggest a high correlation between the flow rate on November 1st and the likely flow rate 
through  the  dry  season.  All  subprojects  will  be  required  to  have  gauge  plates  installed  and 
monitored in a 14-day sequence for recession phase on the wet season monsoon flow throughout 
two dry seasons and with a record within 5 days of the November 1 indicator date. Delaying the 
start of gauging adds a risk that the design will not be completed before the end of year 3 deadline, 
or  subproject  delays  will  be  apparent  at the  MTR  risking the  loss of  capital  from  the  province. 
Advance actions by the Head of PIS for all provincial subproject is needed. 
98. 
LIC Water Resource Management consultants (two teams one based in each of LPB and 
XK but covering two provinces each) will work with the PPIT and WUGs to develop a final water 
use  plan,  estimate  water  demand  and  prepare  a  minimum  requirement  for  water  scheduling 
during  the  dry  season.  These  minimum  requirements  will  specify  the  required  operational 
performance to be addressed by the engineering design team. Should these not be achievable 
throughout the command area, a design meeting to discuss options will be held with WUGs, the 
water resource management consultant and the design team to identify options. 
99. 
This  will  ensure  that  WUGs,  agricultural  experts,  and  water  resource  expertise  are 
involved in the design process to ensure water needs are clearly established prior to the irrigation 
design  engineers  finalizing  their  design  assumptions.  The  Head  of  PIS  will  be  responsible  to 
ensure  the  design  responds  to  modern  water  user  needs  according  to  the  agreed  water 
scheduling. 
100.  Equally important to the design process is the need for safeguard due diligence as outlined 
in the REMDF, the EARF, and the economic due diligence. The PPIT leader will assign a staff 
from  the  PAFO Women’s  Advancement  Unit  to the  gender  focal  point  role,  and  other  staff  for 
social  safeguards  and  land acquisition  roles.  Environmental  considerations  will  be  assigned to 
PONRE  under  an  MOU  between  PAFO  and  PONRE  and  ratified  by  the  Provincial  Steering 
Committee. Production of safeguards documentation will use the support of the PGT contracted 
service providers and the experts in the LIC.  
50 
101.  The  first  step  in  the  design  process  will  necessitate  PAFO  to  clearly  establish  water 
availability  and  current  water  use  and  to  define  the  flow  rates  available  for  the  proposed 
subprojects to ensure a feasible subproject can be designed. The hydrological summary will need 
to be signed off by DDG PAFO and PONRE.  Where water is limited in the dry season, a clear 
estimate of the area to be irrigated is required. 
102.  The water user needs for each additional subproject will then be used by the DDG PAFO 
as the scope of technical work for the Head of PIS and the DED teams.  Once water user needs 
are established, the Head of PIS will establish and negotiate a work plan for the DED based on 
the  required  consultation  process  included  in  the  terms  of  reference  (Annex  3:  Terms  of 
Reference for Detailed Engineering Design). WUG member consultations including both men and 
women from  each  household,  a  combined  PIS  – Water  Users  command  area  walk-through  to 
identify access and needs for water control structures, topographic and cadaster mapping overlaid 
with the design layouts will be carried out. The DED team is required to reflect WUG needs in 
their  preliminary  designs  and  obtain  a  WUG  sign-off  of  the  preliminary  design  through  a 
consultation  process.  Without  this  sign-off,  ADB  will  not  endorse  the  design  or  finance  the 
subproject.  
103.  All  subprojects  that  work  on  in  stream  headwork  structures  that  impound  flow  will  be 
required to include fish passages within the design. Examples of fish passage design have been 
prepared and included in the Xiangkhouang representative subproject design. Where necessary, 
PAFO will obtain technical input and review of fish passages from LARAC who will participate in 
the design and the construction process to ensure the integrity and appropriateness of structures.  
104.  The irrigation staff have the skills sets to complete DEDs, although additional equipment 
for survey and flow rate assessments is necessary. PRI Subproject FS reports will necessitate 
inputs from (a) social assessment survey teams, (b) LIC environmental specialists will screen the 
additional subprojects, confirm environmental classification and prepare the necessary safeguard 
documents,  IEE/EMP  for  Category  B  subprojects  and  due  diligence  report  and  Environmental 
Code of Conduct for Category C subprojects, (c) PGT contracted SIA and resettlement and land 
acquisition  contractor,  and  an  (d)  LIC  economist  (Annex  2:  Terms  of  Reference  for  Loan 
Implementation Consultant). 
105.  DED  (drawings)  and  contract  documents  will  be  in  Lao  language  to  suit  the  local 
contracting industry. The requirement for English documentation while reduced within the OCB 
procurement  system  is  retained  for  safeguard  documentation,  and  procurement  evaluation 
reports and, also project progress reporting. Past projects have used local English speakers to 
address language issues, however, the volume of work and the technical nature of the language 
in safeguards and procurement is problematic. To overcome this, SRIWM will procure a project-
wide  service  provider  for  translation  services  for  all  PPITs. Where  prior  review  or  post  review 
(sampling) is required, this facility will be essential as all bidding and contract documenation will 
need to be translated into English for ADB review. While the cost of this may be higher in direct 
terms, the saved costs of reduced delays from repeated editorial comments prior to approvals 
justify. 
106.  PAFO,  via  the  PPIT,  will  receive  a  lumpsum  payment  for  each  DED  amounting  to 
USD16,000 which will include all costs of field work,  staff allowances, drawings, bill of quantity 
and cost estimates, associated administration, approvals and fees. The fee will be disbursed 50% 
in  advance,  and  50%  on  receipt  of  the  approved  and final  design  with  supporting  safeguards, 
hydrology and economic assessments.  
51 
107.  The  project  would  if  needed  provide  additional  resources  to  the  irrigation  section  (a) 
equipment for field survey and hydrological measurement, (b) higher capacity laptops while cost 
of operations is covered by the PPIT operational budgets.  
6. 
Subproject approval  
108.  Subproject approvals processes will involve the following steps: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
(v) 
(vi) 
PONRE  review  of  the  hydrological  assessment  when  the  environmental  flows 
decline below 30%. 
PONRE review and approve IEE and EMP and issue environmental compliance 
certificate.  
ADB Approve of IEE and EMMP within 20 working days. 
PAFO review and approval of LARP. 
ADB approval of LARP within 20 working days.  
ADB no objection of the DED report. 
(vii)  DED  report  with  supporting  due  diligence  reviewed  PAFO,  Provincial  Technical 
Departments, and DOI PGT technical deputy (within 20 working days). 
(viii)  PAFO submit the design report to the Provincial Steering Committee for approval. 
(ix) 
(x) 
(xi) 
Public Disclosure of the LARP and IEE on ADB website in Lao and local languages 
and on the village information Boards. 
PSC approves the subproject design. 
PAFO proceeds with procurement of contractor. 
7. 
Procurement 
109.  The  procurement  will  be  undertaken  by  the  procurement  team  established  within  the 
planning and finance section of PAFO with responsibility assigned to two staff assigned to the 
PPIT that have participated in the project preparation training. No PIS staff are eligible to work 
with or inside the procurement teams.  
110.  Two  staff  have  been  identified  within  PAFO  during  project  preparation  and  these  have 
been trained and mentored in the preparation of the Procurement Plan and supporting bidding 
documents. These staff should have had exposure and ideally some experience. It is recognized 
that  staff  in  PAFO  at  this  stage  do  not  have  extensive  experience  in  procurement,  therefore 
technical support will be provided in the form of training and mentored learning by doing, starting 
with the RSP procurement planning and documentation preparation using the project readiness 
support program. Ongoing technical support will be required through the PGT and the LICs. 
111.  The procurement team will be responsible for implementation of the procurement plan as 
per the PAM which will include packaging for ASPs, preparation of all procurement documentation 
for  approval  by  the  DG  PAFO.  The  positions  need  to  be  government  staff.  Contract  staff  or 
consultants will not be used for these roles as neither has been proven to be successful at building 
the capability required for the proposed move into a programmatic approach.

Construction Supervision 
113.  Construction  supervision for  all  PRI  works  will  be assigned to  the  PIS  who  will  appoint 
staff; refer Annex 6: Construction Supervision Guidelines. Staff allowances, etc. are included in 
the construction supervision budgets which will be disbursed based on the provision of the agreed 
reports with supporting photographic evidence of the log books during each visit.  
114.  The government cost norm of 2% capital value is not applied for government staff as this 
cost  norm  assumes  a  private  contractor,  whereas  under  the  SRIWSM,  all  Government  staff 
salaries etc. are paid by Government. For the first three construction seasons, LIC will mobilize a 
construction supervision expert to audit and oversee the supervision works. Supervision by PIS 
will also include the completion of environmental and LARP monitoring checklists.  Supervision 
shortfalls and failures will be addressed with urgency, and if they persist, the allowances will be 
withdrawn,  a  private  sector  contractor  procured  with  the  cost  being  deducted  from  the  PPIT 
budgets. 
E. 
Water User Associations 
1. 
Status of WUA and WUG 
115.  There is a mix of WUAs and WUGs among the four RSPs. Nam Pieng 1 and 2, have a 
well-established  WUA.  Nam  Tong,  Nam  Seng  and  Nam  Pua  have  WUGs  that  operate  on  a 
variable  basis.  The  Nam  Pieng  1  &  2  WUAs  were  formed  under  the  Decentralized  Irrigation 
Development and Management project. Nam Tong, Nam Pua, and Nam Seng have WUGs, but 
they perform a limited role in irrigation scheme management. The farmers on the additional Nam 
Seng irrigated area (SC1) are not members of the Nam Seng WUG. 
116.  Assessment of the Nam Tong irrigation scheme found that the WUGs exist in name only, 
and the main irrigation tasks are managed by the Village Authority that are located in the different 
scheme  sectors.  The  main  role  performed  by  the  WUG,  or  the  Village  Authority,  is  nominally 
collecting  ISF,  coordinating  some  scheme  maintenance  and  some  scheme  repairs.  Water 
management in Nam Tong is limited as the main use of irrigation water is for wet season rice.  
53 
117.  Nam Pua has a WUG that was reformed in 2014 and the water management activities are 
managed on a village basis. There is no WUG formed for the Nam Seng SC1 area - it will be 
included in the scheme after upgrading. 
118.  While collection of ISF (in a variety of forms) for Nam Pua, Nam Tong, and Nam Seng is 
undertaken  the  adequacy  of  the  fees  to  operate  and  maintain  the  schemes  infrastructure  is 
constrained  due  to  the  low  income  generated  by  wet  season  rice  and  the  small  areas  of  dry 
season cropping on some schemes.  
119.  WUAs in Nam Pieng 1 & 2 are assessed as being competent. They collect fees from the 
farmers  and  operate  bank  accounts.  Nam  Pieng  1  &  2,  however,  face  the  same  challenge  of 
inadequate funds for scheme operations and maintenance as the other three RSPs.     
120.  The Project investment in upgrading the irrigation schemes can only be justified if the ISF 
fund  the  operations  and  maintenance  of  the  upgraded  schemes.    The  opportunity  to  increase 
incomes  through  DSIA,  mainly  HVCs,  will  be  provided  by  the  Project.  There  must  be,  fully 
functional WUAs that will gather ISF from the farmers and manage the scheme O&M.  
121.  WUG  are  not  sufficient  legal  entities  to  open  bank  account  and  perform  fiducial  tasks. 
Each scheme must have a WUA that is approved by the district authorities before it is eligible to 
open and operate a bank account.   
122.  The WUA must also upgrade their services to the farmers especially water delivery and 
scheduling for dry season crop and livestock stock production. Profitable DSIA activities require 
much more precise water delivery and scheduling than for wet season, or even dry season, rice. 
WUAs must also ensure that there is regular and ongoing dialogue with the farmers over their 
water requirements and scheme maintenance. 
2.  WUG Strengthening Program  
123.  Functional WUAs will be developed for all subprojects. ISF fee collection will be instituted 
on for each of the upgraded schemes and will be set at levels to recover the O&M costs of each 
scheme including maintenance and repairs. Collection and management of the  ISF will be the 
responsibility of the WUAs and WUGs. ISF collection and fund management will require a bank 
account and suitable financial records to account for the use of the ISF. To open and operate a 
bank account a WUG needs to be a formal legal entity which requires their scheme to have a 
WUA. Experience from other projects is that formation of a WUA may take up to three years. 
a. 
Functional WUA 
124.  Each scheme will be assisted to form one WUA. These WUAs will not replace the WUGs 
that  already  exist  but  will  be  overarching  agency  that  will  coordinate  and  manage  irrigation 
activities on each subproject. The WUGs must continue to operate once the WUA are formed as 
the WUGs are responsible for the specific irrigation sectors on each scheme. These sectors are 
linked to villages or to specific areas of schemes served by a canal or headworks.  
125.  The first priority in the transition from WUGs to one WUA is to register the WUA with the 
district authority. Registration requires that the WUA demonstrates the capacity to operate as a 
competent  agency  and  able  perform  its  main  functions.  Once  registered  the  newly  constituted 
WUA will open bank account. The main financial management task for the initial WUGs will be 
the collection of the ISF, banking the fees, and managing the use of the funds. This may include 
54 
the contracting of some service. An interim banking arrangement may need to be instituted. One 
interim option is that the ISF funds are banked in the respective Village Authority bank accounts 
until the WUA is formally established. 
126.  One of the reasons for the slow establishment of the WUAs is their capacity to manage 
the WUA tasks as defined in the WUA regulations. Capacity development will be provided by the 
Project to better address the capacity issues in a more timely and efficient way. 
127.  There are four main functions that the WUAs must perform: (i) O&M of the water delivery; 
(ii) Maintenance; (iii) Repairs, (iv) ISF Collection and Administration. The Maintenance, Repairs, 
and  Administration  functions  are  nominally  performed  now  for  the  schemes  and  the  irrigation 
farmer community and the Village Administration are aware of them. Operations on the upgraded 
schemes  will  become  a  critical  function  to  ensure  that  the  farmers  have  adequate  and  timely 
delivery of dry season water for their HVCs. Farmers often consider the delivery of dry season 
water to be a high risk, and this will influence their decision whether to grow crops over the dry 
season. Flood irrigation is suitable for rice, but vegetable and fruit crops require a more controlled 
and precise irrigation regime to produce good quality products. 
128.  There  is  some  experience  in  Lao  PDR  with  WUAs  that  have  business  functions  and 
provide business services to the farmers. WUAs in the SRIWSM, however, must only undertake 
the four functions outlined above. The reason for this is that the WUAs must concentrate on their 
role as the scheme’s irrigation water management agency. The poor WUG performance in past 
years  highlights  that  the  WUAs  (once  they  are  formed)  should  concentrate  on  the  essential 
functions related to their water management role. The WUGs will be assisted with farm business 
planning,  market  connections  and  marketing  and  with farm  production  technical  advice  by  the 
Project.  Moreover, these services will be developed so that they can be provided to the WUGs 
on a sustainable basis from sector service providers. 
b. 
WUA Main Functions 
i. 
Operations 
129.  WUA  operations  on  the  upgraded  schemes  will  concentrate  upon  dry  season  water 
scheduling and delivery. This is a new operational task for the WUGs and WUAs.  Farmers will 
require irrigation water on a schedule that meets the water demand of their crops. Upgrading of 
the schemes has been planned to be able provide water on regular schedule over the dry season.  
But the WUAs for the schemes will be required to manage the delivery of the water on schedule. 
Water scheduling based upon crop demand is not well understood by the PAFO PIS staff and by 
the farmers. Capacity development by the Project will be targeted at the WUA, and the farmers 
learning  about  water  scheduling. The  Project  will  provide  technical  extension  services that  will 
enable farmers to learn about the irrigation water demand of their crops, and the optimal times for 
watering. 
130.  Water planning and scheduling must be done based upon the water demand of the crops 
and any forages that will be grown over the dry season. Close coordination between dry season 
farm planning by the farmers (and their Project technical advisers) and the irrigation scheduling 
that the WUA will be responsible for must occur. The LIC will facilitate this process for the first 
two dry seasons. 
55 
ii.  Maintenance 
131.  Scheme maintenance is usually performed by the scheme farmers under the direction of 
the WUG, WUA  or  the  Village  Authority.  The  farmers  are  proactive  with  maintenance  and  will 
clean  the  main  canals  prior  to  the  main  wet  season  irrigation.  The  community  will  continue  to 
provide this maintenance service after scheme upgrading and WUA formation. The Nam Tong 
farmers said they would prefer to continue to carry out regular maintenance on a voluntary basis 
to keep the ISF down.  
iii.  Repairs 
132.  Scheme  repairs  and  upgrading  will  be  undertaken  by  the  schemes’  farmers,  and  by 
contractors for bigger construction or repair tasks. Farmers will be able to manage some repair 
tasks, and this will reduce the ISF.    
iv.  ISF Collection and Administration 
133.  Collection  of  IFS  in  the  past  has  been  weak  and  is  commonly  through a  standard  rice 
contribution. Each WUA will be required to establish annual budget and workplan based on the 
projected O&M costs, and then from this, determine the required ISF. Without an agreement for 
the  higher  ISF,  no  capital  investment  will  be  approved.  Higher  ISF  will  be  phased  in  once  the 
schemes have been upgraded and formally handed over. Farmers will be levied on an irrigated 
land  area  basis  by  season  of  water  availability  not  water  use.  Implementing  an  ISF  collection 
system will be a major task for the WUA. 
134.  The WUA will institute financial management and operational procedures that will provide 
the  basis for the WUA to efficiently  execute  its main functions. This  will  include setting  up the 
WUA  bank  account,  suitable  financial  management  recording  systems,  and  administrative 
systems.  Project  support  will  be  provided  to  assist  the  WUA  become  operational  and  this  will 
include training for the WUA manager and the accounting staff. Main tasks are:  
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
(v) 
(vi) 
(vii)  Monitor and report work programs to membership   
Definition of annual operational water schedules 
Assignment of responsibility for operating the water schedules 
Define the cost of such services 
Identify expected repairs and maintenance requirements and include in planning 
Define the costs of Repair and Maintenance  
Prepare an annual operational plan, supporting budget and agreed ISF 
3.  WUA Organizational Structure 
135.  Staffing of the WUA will be on a part-time basis, and some of the positions may be filled 
in  by  Village  Authority  staff  for  specialist  tasks  such  as  accounting. WUA  employment  of  staff 
must be matched by the work demand, which will vary from scheme to scheme. This applies to 
the  number  of  staff  and  the  time  they  are  employed.  WUA  work  demand  will  vary  between 
schemes and the WUGs on each scheme will also perform some irrigation management tasks  
136.  The main WUA positions are outlined below and the main tasks for each position are also 
included. It is emphasized that there is no standardized WUA staffing structure and positions, and 
this will vary from scheme to scheme. All WUA positions will be part-time. 
56 
(i)  WUA  Manager  –  this  is  an  elected  position  and  the  Manager  will  oversee  the  WUA 
functions  and  activities.  Important  responsibilities  will  be  managing  the  ISF  collection, 
management  of  the  ISF  funds,  especially  their  use  to  repair,  maintain  and  operate  the 
scheme. Scheme maintenance, repairs, and new investment will be another responsibility. 
Ensuring  efficient  water  delivery  and  scheduling  for  the  dry  season  will  be  new  and 
important tasks. Dialogue with the farmers will be an important task and must occur on a 
regular basis. The WUA must adopt and follow a client services attitude. 
(ii)  Accountant  –  financial  recording  tasks,  and  preparation  of  monthly  reports  on  WUA 
financial position and financial transactions. Banking of ISF and any other income. 
(iii)  Secretary Administrator -support the WUA Manager and Accountant. 
(iv)  Water  Delivery  Operational  staff  –  responsible  for  ensuring  that  the  farmers  have  their 
irrigation water delivered to their farms on schedule (based on the agreed water delivery 
plan). For the dry season this is critical role. These staff will maintain regular contact with 
the farmers and monitor delivery and identify any delivery and scheduling issues that arise.    
(v)  Repairs  and  Maintenance  staff  –  responsible  scheme  maintenance  and  repairs.  These 
tasks  may  be  done  on  a  volunteer  basis  for  the  scheme  maintenance,  and  small-scale 
repairs. Larger repairs may need to be contracted. 
4.  Inputs 
137.  Proposed  Project  investments  for  WUA  development  are:  (i)  project  meetings  with  the 
farmers groups  to form and reactivate  the WUGs;  (ii) WUA  office  equipment  and  systems; (iii) 
capacity development for WUA staff. 
5.  Implementation  
138.  Timing of the  implementation  of WUA formation and capacity  development  is  critical  to 
ensure that the WUAs (and WUGs) manage and deliver ISF for the first irrigated dry season on 
the upgraded schemes. 
a. 
Activity 1: WUG and WUA Guidelines and Regulation 
139.  Task 1: The LIC WUA Group Management Adviser, with support from the International 
Water  Resources  Adviser  and  the  National  Water  Resources  Adviser,  will  prepare  the  WUG 
regulations that will cover the period until the WUAs are legally formed and operational. This task 
will use existing regulations and revise them to match the needs of the Project. After the WUAs 
are  legally  formed  the  WUGs  will  still  operate  and  represent  the  scheme  sectors  (based  on 
villages or irrigation areas).  Preparation of the WUG regulations must recognize that the ongoing 
role of WUGs, as well their interim role until the WUAs are formed. This is a priority task as it 
provides the basis for WUG formation, reactivation and subsequent operation (Output Activity 2). 
It must occur soon after the LIC is mobilized in Project Year 2.   
140.  Task 2: Preparation of the WUA regulations for each subproject by the LIC WUA Group 
Management Adviser and will utilize the experience from other WUAs already operating in Laos. 
These must be consistent with the Laos Irrigation Law (2013) and comply with any other relevant 
Laos  laws.  The WUA  regulations  for  the  two  existing WUAs  will  be  reviewed  and  modified  as 
required.  Regulations  for  the  RSP  schemes  must  include  the  financial  requirements  for  ISF 
collection  at  the  level  set  for  each  scheme  by  the  Project,  and  water  delivery  and  scheduling 
operations. Regulations that enable the WUA to be formed and operate a bank account must be 
prioritised.  
141.  The Nam Phieng 1 & 2 WUA regulations may need to be revised to align with the Project’s 
requirements for ISF collection and for water delivery operations. ISF collection, the management 
57 
of the funds, financial reporting, and the utilization of the funds must be consistent for the WUAs 
in all subprojects. 
b.  Activity 2: WUG and WUA Formation  
142.  Formation or reactivation of the WUGs that will transition into WUAs must commence at 
the  beginning  of  Project  Year  2.  This  will  be  concurrent  with  the  preparation  of  the  WUG 
regulations (Output Activity 1 above). Because of the different operational status of the WUGs in 
each scheme the WUG formation and development work will vary. The International and National 
Water Resources Advisers will lead this activity with the PPIT for each subproject.  
143.  Task 1: Formation of the WUGs will involve a series of community meetings with the RSP 
irrigation scheme farmers where the role of functions of the WUGs and WUAs are presented and 
discussed with the farmers. The discussion must feature the differences between the purpose of 
the Project supported WUGs and WUAs, and the WUGs and WUAs that currently exist and may 
operate in each subproject. The financial aspects of scheme management including fee collection, 
and  the  dry  season  operations functions  must  be highlighted  at these meetings. The  irrigation 
farmers will elect the WUG leader, if required, at the community meeting. 
144.  Task  2:  Once  the  WUGs  in  each  subproject  are  formed  (or  reactivated)  they  will  be 
assisted  to  develop  and  undertake  their  main  operations.  The  initial  WUG  formation  and 
development program will be spread over nine months and will be completed immediately prior 
to  the  first  dry  season  of  irrigation  on  the  upgraded  schemes  in  early  Project  Year  3.  WUG 
performance after the first season will be reviewed and the program of support for subsequent 
years determined at that stage.   
145.  The WUGs must be ready to start their initial operations by mid Project Year 2. Main areas 
of support for the WUGs by the LIC WUA Management Adviser will be: (i) to understand the WUG 
regulations; (ii) appointment of the WUG staff members – this may be only required for Nam Tong;  
(iii) to prepare and implement an annual operational plan; (iv) establish (or further develop) their 
financial management systems, including the financial records, reporting and the fee collection 
mechanism; (v) to develop water delivery and water scheduling operations – this must be a priority 
leading into the first dry season irrigation activity; and (vi) maintenance and repairs. 
146.  Task 3: Although some Nam Phieng 1 & 2 WUAs are more advanced than the WUGs in 
other subprojects, they must be assisted to prepare their irrigation services for the first dry season 
of irrigation activity on the upgraded schemes. The LIC WUA Management Adviser will assess 
the  operational  status  and  capacity  of  the  two  Nam  Pieng  schemes  during  the  LIC  Inception. 
Using  the  LIC  assessment  the  program  for  the  Nam  Pieng  1  &  2  will  be  prepared  and 
implemented.      
147.  Task 4: WUAs will be established based upon the existing and interim WUGs. Experience 
from  the  formation  of  other WUAs  should  be  used  to make  the WUA  formation  process  more 
efficient.  The  LIC  WUA  Management  Adviser  will  identify  the  main  constraints  to  WUA 
establishment and undertake measures that will speed up the establish process. Shadow WUAs 
for  each  scheme  will  be  formed,  and  they  will  have  no  legal  status.  They  will  be  supported  to 
assume the main WUA functional tasks, involving ongoing coordination with the WUGs.  Over the 
WUA formation process, the Project will provide a WUG and WUA capacity development program 
that  will  build  the  skills  and  knowledge  of  the  WUG  staff,  and  the  Village  Authority  staff  to  be 
involved in the WUA (Activity 3 below). 
58 
148.  Task  5:  Once  the  district  authorities  approve  the  legal  status  of  the  WUAs,  they  will 
formally assume the responsibility managing the irrigation scheme. A WUA bank account will be 
established, and the WUA will assume responsibility for the main functions and tasks outlined the 
WUA regulations.  It is expected that this will be an easy transition as the shadow WUA will have 
operated  for  at  least  one  year,  and  the WUGs  will  have  all  extensive  operational  support  and 
capacity development from the Project. The WUA Management Adviser and other LIC consultants 
will provide support for the WUAs for at least one Project year after formal WUA approval.  
c. 
Activity 3: WUG and WUA Capacity Development 
149.  Capacity  development  will  be  closely  aligned  with  the  institutional  and  operational 
development of the WUGs, and WUAs. Capacity development needs will be undertaken by the 
LIC inception team, and the Water Management Adviser will coordinate the capacity development 
program that will consist of four phases over a three-year period (from mid-Project year 2 to mid-
Project Year 5). There will be four main capacity development target groups: (i) WUG and WUA 
Managers  (leaders);  (ii)  Accounting  and  Finance  staff;  (iii)  Technical  Operations  staff;  and  (iv) 
Farmers.  Water  planning  and  scheduling  training  for  farmers  is  included,  as  this  must  be 
integrated with the WUA and WUG operations. 
150.  Phase 1 of the capacity development will concentrate in the Nam Tong, Nam Seng and 
Nam  Pua  WUGs  to  develop  the  basic  skills  for  the  WUG  to  manage  the  upgraded  scheme 
operations (Nam Pieng can be included based on needs).  Phase 1 will occur at the end of Project 
year 2 in the two months immediately when the upgraded schemes have their first irrigated dry 
season  (at  the  start  of  Project  Year  3).  Water  management,  including  water  delivery  and 
scheduling  will  be  a  priority  training  topic.  The  training  must  include  both  the WUG  and  WUA 
water operations staff. The training must also align with the water planning and scheduling training 
provided to the farmers that will grow dry season crops on all subprojects. (Training Task 4 in the 
Implementation Schedule). Timeliness of this first irrigation water delivery and scheduling training 
is critical and must occur in the weeks leading to the first irrigated dry season on the upgraded 
RSPs.    
151.  The  second  phase  of  WUG  and  WUA  capacity  development  will  occur  after  the  first 
irrigated dry season leading up to the second irrigated dry season on the RSPs and subsequent 
subprojects.  Capacity  development  over  this  phase  will  include  leadership  and  management 
training, finance and accounting, as well as continuing the water management operations skills 
and  knowledge  development.  Training  for  the  WUGs  will  focus  on  building  their  capacity  to 
develop into a fully functioning WUA. The WUA training will be more targeted at specific skills to 
improve WUA performance.  
152.  Phase  3  of  the  capacity  building  will  follow  a  similar  pattern  to  Phase  2,  based  on  the 
review of WUG and WUA performance and application of skills and knowledge. There will be an 
assessment of capacity development prior to the commencement of each phase. WUG and WUA 
performance review will not be formal and will consist of on-the-job assessment by the LIC team 
members and some self-assessment of ongoing training needs by the WUA and WUG staff. 
153.  Phase 4 will be the last period of capacity development activity. It will occur following the 
completion of the third dry season irrigation (Project Year 5). It is expected that the WUA will be 
officially operational by this stage and the capacity development will concentrate upon ensuring 
the WUA staff are competently performing their main tasks. ISF collection, financial management, 
and planning and implementation of maintenance and any repairs will be more prominent roles 
59 
by this stage. More farmers will be using the dry season water and water planning and scheduling 
will also be important training topics.      
154.  The capacity development program will not be predetermined and prescriptive and will be 
based upon the learning needs of the WUG and WUA staff. The LIC WUA Management Adviser 
and the International Water Resources  specialist will be responsible for the assessment of the 
main learning needs. They will also monitor what has been learned and applied by the WUG and 
WUA staff.  
155.  Learning and training activities must also be practical and applied, consisting of a mix of 
teaching and learning methods such as on-the-job training, mentoring. There should be limited 
formal teaching. Adult learning principles followed especially not delivering the learning activity 
more than six weeks in advance of the staff using the skill or knowledge in their work. All training 
and learning activities will meet the time availability of the WUA and WUG staff, especially the 
women staff.  
VII.  OUTPUT 4 ARRANGEMENTS 
156.  Output 4 is funded through an ADB administered EU grant. The project will use the existing 
nutrition coordination process to identify nutrition-priority villages in each of the 6 districts and will 
scale-up existing tried and tested methods promoted under the NNSPA, by forming nutrition clubs, 
providing Social Behavior Change Communication (SBCC) and nutrition training, and supporting 
club  and  individual  development  plans  designed  to  increase  the  production  and  year-round 
consumption of diverse and nutritious foods. It will work with Output 1 to ensure that a proportion 
of  the  vegetable  production  from  the  irrigation  schemes  will  be  readily  accessible  to  people  in 
surrounding areas where fresh produce is currently not widely available. 
157.  The output will be implemented in approximately 100 villages and will use methods already 
successfully piloted in Houaphan province. The implementation will be contracted to the existing 
service provider that has trained staff, existing resources material etc. and will upscale their work 
through the 6 Project Districts by delivering the following Interventions: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
Formation and capacity development of district nutrition teams (DNT). The district 
nutrition committees will coordinate the formation of these teams that will include 
2-3 personnel from each of the District Department of Health, DAFO and LWU. 
Formation  and  capacity  development  of  village  nutrition  teams  comprising 
volunteers associated with LWU, DAFO and, if available Health. These teams will 
be  the  main  conduit  for  implementation  of  activities  and  will  ensure  the 
sustainability of the project in the long term. 
Baseline  and  formative  research  undertaken  by  the  DNTs  and  village  nutrition 
teams.  The  formative  research,  including  Knowledge,  Attitudes,  Perceptions, 
Practices  (KAPP)  will  identify  the  nutrition-related  practices  that  need  to  be 
supported and promoted at the household level. From the offset, village nutrition 
related data will be shared with the communities to instill ownership. 
Convergence  triggering  session:  DNTs  and  project  staff  will  mobilize  the 
communities for this initial activity, to be informed by the KAPP. Emphasis will be 
on the relation between nutrition and the well-being of all household members, how 
poor nutrition during the critical years can affect every child’s education and lifetime 
achievements, and the importance for each child to eat a diversity of food to enable 
60 
(v) 
(vi) 
him/her to grow and develop. A “triggering tool” is used to prompt discussion and 
raise awareness. 
Preparation  of  Village  Convergence  Poster,  which  includes  the  number  of  key 
nutrition indicators, such as the number and diversity of crops produced, number 
and percentage of latrines, nutrition knowledge and hygiene concepts, percentage 
of children with malnutrition and the dietary diversity for different members of the 
households. 
LANN (Linking Agriculture to Nutrition and Natural Resources) activities. LANN is 
an approach to address malnutrition that was developed by development partners 
in Laos and is particularly suited to upland areas. It includes multiple flexible tools 
(i.e.  cards,  games,  training  materials)  and  activities  related  to  nutrition,  WASH, 
agriculture and natural resource management. 
(vii)  Development of Convergence Actions Plans with targets for the enhancement of 
indicators  shown  on  the  posters.  LANN  is  a  process  that  follows  a  seasonal 
calendar. However early in the process, it is possible to facilitate the development 
of  Convergence  Action  Plans.  These  have  proven  to  give  effective  guidance  to 
village members on doable actions to improve their nutrition situation. Examples 
include  increasing  the  variety  of  crops  grown  and  consumed,  establishment  of 
vegetable  gardens,  planting  more  fruit  trees,  cooking  meals  with  more  diverse

DNTs.  Bi-annual  participatory  monitoring  enables  the  villagers  to  update  their

158.  SBCC centered around the promotion of a number of key behaviors related to the 1,000 
days  (maternal  nutrition,  exclusive  breastfeeding,  complementary  feeding)  and  adolescent 
nutrition, hygiene practices and gender social roles and norms, distribution of household tasks, 
and  awareness  of  women’s  and  men’s  roles  in  nutrition.  SBCC  activities  need  to  be  aligned 
closely  with  activities  in  agriculture  and  WASH  that  aim  to  improve  the  food  and  sanitation 
environment. For example, cooking demonstrations that include foods available in that season, 
the proper use of irrigation water for domestic purposes, the use of income from cash crops for 
household food, etc. and mass media campaign using community radio. 
VIII.  COSTS AND FINANCING 
159.  The  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $51.46  million  including  taxes  and  duties,  and  the 
Government  of  Lao  PDR’s  in-kind  contributions.  The  Government  has  requested:  (i)  a 
concessional loan of $40 million from ADB’s ordinary capital resources with a 32-year term, a 8-
year grace period, with an interest rate of 1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per 
annum thereafter; (ii) a grant of $5 million from ADB’s Disaster Risk Reduction Fund; and (iii) a 
grant  of  Euro  4  million,  equivalent  to  $4.46  million  from  the  European  Union  to  be  fully 
administered by ADB. The European Union grant will finance all costs of Output 4 including taxes 
and duties. Both ADB and EU funds will be disbursed using ADB procedures and in accordance 
with the agreed allocation table. The details of various aspects of project costing are presented in 
the tables which follow (Tables 23-29). 
A. 
Cost Estimates Preparation and Revisions  
160.  Cost  estimates  have  been  prepared  for  the  seven-year  implementation  period  of  the 
Project.  The  RSP  designs  and  civil  works  components  are  based  upon  DED  with  the  costs 
estimated  reflecting  current  prices  for  materials,  equipment  and  civil  works  in  Laos.  Cost 
61 
estimates for all training, technical assistance and support activities are also based on current 
costs prevailing in Laos as of 15 March 2019. 
B. 
Key Assumptions 
161.  The following key assumptions underpin the cost estimates and financing plan: 
(i) 
Exchange  rate:  KN8583.76  =  $1.00  (19  March  2019).  The  exchange  rate  for 
conversion of EUR to USD was taken from euro info as of September 2018 at USD 
0.8969: EUR 1 (24/05/2019) and will be updated at the time of confirmation from 
the EU and again prior to loan negotiations and ADB Board circulation.  
(ii) 
Price  contingencies  based  on  expected  cumulative 
implementation period are as follows:

(iii) 
In-kind contributions were calculated based on or using government staff salaries 
and allowances as specified in the Government Order. The farm gate costs are 
applied  to  all  farm  inputs,  and  provincial  construction  cost  norms  for  civil  works 
costs  based  on  industry  specific  norms  and  crossed  referenced  to  local  market 
rates.

FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT  
A. 
Financial Management Assessment 
164.  The financial management assessment (FMA) was conducted in June 2018 in accordance 
with ADB’s Guidelines for the Financial Management and Analysis of Projects and the Financial 
Due  Diligence:  A  Methodology  Note.5  The  FMA  considered  the  capacity  of  MAF  and  its  two 
departments - the Department of Planning and Finance (DOPF), and the Department of Irrigation 
(DOI) - which is also an implementing agency (IA). Additional assessments were conducted for 
in  Houaphan, 
IA,  Provincial  Agriculture  and  Forestry  Office  (PAFO) 
each  provincial 
Xiangkhouang, Louangphabang, and Xaignabouli provinces. The assessment also reviewed the 
funds  flow  arrangements,  staffing,  accounting  and  financial  reporting  systems,  financial 
information systems, and internal and external auditing arrangements. Based on the assessment, 
the key financial management risks identified are: (i) serious issues shown in the annual audit 
reports  of  the  provincial  entities  related  to  financial  governance  with  unclear  procedures  on 
contract and asset management; (ii) inadequate financial management systems and controls of 
the IAs; (iii) unavailability and lack of technical capacity of government staff for the project; (iv) 
incomplete,  unclear,  and  inconsistent  financial  management  systems  and  procedures  for  ADB 
projects; (v) lack of an acceptable computerized accounting system; (vi) lack of effective internal 
auditing by IAs; (vii) incomplete project audit reports in the implementing agencies and which are 
not  based  on  international  standards;  and  (viii)  incomplete  project  management  information 
leading  to  inaccurate  project  reporting.  It  is  concluded  that  the  overall  pre-mitigation  financial 
management risk  of  MAF  and the IAs  is  high.  MOF though has  the  capacity  to administer  the 
advance fund and implement SOE procedures. The Government of Lao, MAF and the IAs have 
agreed  to  implement  an  action  plan  as  key  measures  to  address  the  deficiencies.  MAF,  the 
executing agency has broad experience in the implementation of past and ongoing ADB projects 
and has agreed to oversee the implementation of the action plan. Consultants under the TRTA 
project readiness activities are supporting MAF and the IAS in implementing the action plan ahead 
of the project start up, and this will be further supported by the Loan Implementation Consultants 
after project start up. 
165.  The  FMA  found  IAs  to  have  inadequate  internal  audit  arrangements  including  both 
systems  and  staffing  resulting  in  internal  audit  reports  being  unavailable.  The  risk  is  that  this 
situation will weaken financial management controls. These project risks are mitigated through: 
(i)  Project  FMM  detailing  the  financial  management  systems  and  procedures,  including 
accounting  software  based  on  an  internationally-accepted  double-entry  book  keeping  and 
accounting system and financial reporting to meet project management and donor requirements. 
(ii) Monitoring and oversight from the Department of Irrigation’s Program Governance Team and 
5 Financial Management Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2 of the RRP). 
72 
the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Forestry’s  Department  of  Planning  and  Finance.  The  project  is 
providing consultant support to these roles. (iii) External audits to be conducted by a private audit 
firm; (iv) Ongoing training of IA staff. 
166.  The FMM, accounting software, and IA training is being implemented by the TRTA team, 
as  part  of  project  readiness,  is  ready  to  go  by  end  of  August  2019.  The  expert  and  software 
company are available as soon as required. IA training, as well as monitoring and oversight and 
systems updates based on initial experience, will be implemented at project start up, including 
transitional consultant support arrangements if necessary prior to the engagement of the LIC.

Disbursement 
1. 
Disbursement  Arrangements  for  ADB  and  ADB-administered  Cofinancier 
Funds 
168.  The  loan  and  grant  proceeds  including  ADB  administered  co-financier  funds  will  be 
disbursed in accordance with ADB’s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time 
to  time),6  and  detailed  arrangements  agreed  upon  between  the  government  and  ADB.  Online 
training for project staff on disbursement policies and procedures is available.7 Project staff will 
be required to avail of this training to help ensure efficient disbursement and fiduciary control. 
169.  Advance  fund  procedure.  Three  separate  advance  accounts  will  be  established  and 
maintained by MOF for each of the three funding sources. Three separate sub-accounts will be 
opened for DOI and the Houaphan and Xiangkhouang provincial PAFOs whilst the remaining two 
provinces of Louangphabang and Xaignabouli provinces will have subaccounts for the ADB COL 
and  ADB  Special  Funds  Resources.  The  currency  of  the  advance  accounts  is  US  dollar.  The 
advance accounts are to be used exclusively for ADB’s and ADB-administered co-financier funds 
share of eligible expenditures. MOF, who administers the advance accounts, is accountable and 
responsible  for  proper  use  of  advances  to  the  advance  accounts  including  advances  to  sub-
accounts. 
170.  Direct payments by ADB that are agreed in negotiated contracts will be disbursed based 
on documentation submitted by the contractor to the IA. Each IA will review documentation and 
submit this to DOI, and then to MAF (Finance and Planning) for review of documentation. Once 
cleared  by  MAF,  the  documentation  will  be  reviewed  by  MOF  for  approval  of  disbursement  of 
Project funds by ADB directly to the contractor. 
6 The handbook is available electronically from the ADB website (http://www.adb.org/documents/ loan-disbursement-
handbook 
7  Disbursement eLearning. http://wpqr4.adb.org/disbursement_elearning  
74 
171.  The total outstanding advances to the respective advance account should not exceed the 
estimate of the respective ADB’s share of expenditures to be paid through the respective advance 
account for the forthcoming 6 months. MOF may request for initial and additional advances to the 
respective  advance  account  based  on  an  Estimate  of  Expenditure  Sheet8  setting  out  the 
estimated  expenditures  to  be  financed  through  the  respective  account  for  the  forthcoming  6 
months.  Supporting  documents  should  be  submitted  to  ADB  or  retained  by  the  respective 
executing and implementing agencies in accordance with ADB’s Loan Disbursement Handbook 
(2017, as amended from time to time) when liquidating or replenishing the the respective advance 
account. 
172.  Statement  of  expenditure  (SOE)  procedure.9  The  SOE  procedure  may  be  used  to 
reimburse  eligible  payments  or  to  liquidate  advances  to  the  respective  advance  account.  The 
ceiling of the SOE procedure is the equivalent of $100,000 per individual payment.  Supporting 
documents and records for the expenditures claimed under the SOE should be maintained and 
made  readily  available  for  review  by  ADB's  disbursement  and  review  missions,  upon  ADB's 
request for submission of supporting documents on a sampling basis, and for independent audit. 
The IAs under the coordination of the PGT will be responsible to ensure SOEs are operated in 
accordance  with  ADB  requirements.  Reimbursement  and  liquidation  of  individual  payments  in 
excess  of  the  SOE  ceiling  should  be  supported  by  full  documentation  when  submitting  the 
withdrawal application to ADB. 
173.  Before the submission of the first withdrawal application (WA), the borrower should submit 
to  ADB  sufficient  evidence  of  the  authority  of  the  person(s)  who  will  sign  the  withdrawal 
applications on behalf of the government, together with the authenticated specimen signatures of 
each  authorized  person.  The  minimum  value  per  WA  is  stipulated  in  the  Loan  Disbursement 
Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time).  Individual payments below such amount should 
be paid (i) by the IAs and subsequently claimed to ADB through reimbursement, or (ii) through 
the advance fund procedure, unless otherwise accepted by ADB. The borrower should ensure 
sufficient category and contract balances before requesting disbursements.   
2. 
Disbursement Arrangements for Counterpart Fund 
174.  Counterpart funds are only used for (i) staff costs and (ii) obtaining the UXO certification 
prior to subproject implementation. Arrangement for counterpart funds needs to be incorporated 
into the annual workplan and budget cycle for all IAs and MAF. This will require each provincial 
IA and the DOI to prepare workplans and supporting budgets in May to June the year prior to the 
funds being required. In the case of the UXO funding which will be taken form the government’s 
UXO trust fund and implemented through their work plan, a one-year advance notice is required 
from  each IA to the  UXO  program  manager. Once  approved, funds  are  disbursed  through  the 
annual appropriation to each Ministry and the respective Departments. For provincial staff costs, 
these are provided through the provincial governor’s budget appropriation. 
175.  The  in-kind  government  contribution  will  be  expressed  in  quarterly  and  annual  reports 
based on the actual cost to Government budget, for salaries and associated social costs these 
will be identified from the time allocation in annual work planning, office and utilities costs will be

assigned based on a prorate of total annual costs per staff member. Non-financed participation 
costs will be included based on cost records from each provincial project implementation team.  
D. 
Accounting 
176.  The  PGT  -  DOI  and  each  provincial   IA  will  maintain  separate  books  and  records  by 
funding source for all expenditures incurred on the project following International Public Sector 
Accounting  Standards  for  cash-based  accounting  or  its  national  equivalent.  The  Provincial 
administration will be responsible for account and report on these accounts in accordance with 
government’s accounting laws.  The compiled accounts for the project will be maintained by DoI 
on behalf of the executing agency[1] and will include reconciliation of the payments made from 
the Advance Account and direct payment by ADB to contractors as is currently practiced by other 
sector projects in Lao PDR.  
E. 
Auditing and Public Disclosure 
177.  The MAF will cause the detailed consolidated project financial statements to be audited in 
accordance  with International  Standards  on  Auditing  by  an  independent  auditor  acceptable  to 
ADB. The audited project financial statements together with the auditor’s opinion will be presented 
in the English language to ADB within 6 months from the end of the fiscal year by the MAF.  
1786.  The audit report for the project financial statements will include a management letter and 
auditor’s  opinions,  covering  the  following:  (i)  that  the  project  financial  statements  present  an 
accurate  and  fair  view  or  are  presented  fairly,  in  all  material  respects,  in  accordance  with  the 
applicable financial reporting standards; (ii) that the proceeds of the loan and grant were used 
only  for  the  purposes  of  the  project;  and  (iii)  that  the  borrower  or  executing  agency  was  in 
compliance with the financial covenants contained in the legal agreements (where applicable). 
Six audited financial reports will be submitted for this Project. 
179.  The  PGT  -  DOI  and  each  provincial IA  will  cause  the  audit  of  their  respective  financial 
statements  in  accordance  with  acceptable  standards  on  audit  or  its  national  equivalent  by 
independent  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB.   In  addition,  the  MOF  will  cause  the  audit  of 
the   Advance  Account   in  accordance  with  International  Standards  on  Auditing  or  its  national 
equivalent, by an independent auditor acceptable to ADB. The audited project financial reports 
shall be compiled by PGT-DOI  and submitted to ADB within 6 months from the close of the fiscal 
year. 
180.  Compliance with financial reporting and auditing requirements will be monitored by review 
missions and during normal program supervision, and followed up regularly with all concerned, 
including the external auditor; refer Annex 7: Terms of Reference for Independent Project Audit 
of Project Financial Statements. 
181.  The  government,  MAF,  DOI  and  Provincial  PAFOs  have  been  made  aware  of  ADB’s 
approach to delayed submission, and the requirements for satisfactory and acceptable quality of 
the  audited  project  financial  statements.10  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  require  a  change  in  the 
[1] Whilst  the  EA  has  no  direct  control  over  the  Provincial  Financial  Management  –  all  direct  payments,  withdrawal 
application  and  replenishments  are  processed  by  the  EA   (through  DoI  to  MAF  (Planning  and  Finance)  who  are 
accountable for overall coordination and review of day to day financial management.) 
10 ADB’s approach and procedures regarding delayed submission of audited project financial statements:  
(i)  When audited project financial  statements  are  not  received  by  the  due  date,  ADB  will  write  to  the  executing 
agency advising that (a) the audit documents are overdue; and (b) if they are not received within the next  6 
76 
auditor (in a manner consistent with the constitution of the borrower), or for additional support to 
be provided to the auditor, if the audits required are not conducted in a manner satisfactory to 
ADB,  or  if  the  audits  are  substantially  delayed.  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  verify  the  project's 
financial accounts to confirm that the share of ADB’s financing is used in accordance with ADB’s 
policies and procedures.  
182.  Public disclosure of the audited project financial statements, including the auditor’s opinion 
on the project financial statements, will be guided by ADB’s Public Communications Policy 2011.11 
After the review, ADB will disclose the audited project financial statements and the opinion of the 
auditors on the project financial statements no later than 14 days of ADB’s confirmation of their 
acceptability  by  posting  them  on  ADB’s  website.  The  management  letter,  additional  auditor’s 
opinions, and audited entity financial statements will not be disclosed.12

(2017, as amended from time to time) and its associated project administration instructions and 
staff instructions.  The issuance of invitations to bid under advance contracting will be subject to 
ADB approval. The borrower, MAF, DA, PAFOs in Houaphan, Xiangkhouang, Louangphabang, 
and Xaignabouli Provinces (IAs) have been advised that approval of advance contracting does 
not commit ADB to finance the project. Contracts can only be signed after the project is declared

for  expressions  of  interest  for  translation  services  (CQS);  and  (vi)  CMS  listing  and  request  for 
expressions of interest for external audit services The contract with the start-up consultant will be 
signed immediately following loan effectiveness and will then continue to support PGT and PAFOs 
with the procurement of LIC consulting services packages until their appointment in late-2020. 
Following  mobilization  of  the  LICs,  the  procurement  of  the  remaining  consulting  services  will 
proceed with the aim of signing all contracts by the end of 2020. Procurement of the consultant 
for the preparation of the investment master plan will be initiated by DOI LIC following contract 
signing.  
186.  For  goods,  equipment,  and  vehicles  contracts,  DOI  and  PAFO  will  have  confirmed  the 
specifications for office and field equipment, and have these approved by relevant government 
entities,  final  tender  documentation  is  reviewed  and  approved  by  government,  and  ready  for 
tendering at loan signing. 
187.  For  works  contracts  related  to  the  four  representative  subprojects  (RSP),  the  bidding 
documents have been prepared and will be approved by the EA and supporting agencies prior to 
Loan signing. Works contract tender documentation will be updated and ready for advertising by 
Loan effectiveness and when land acquisition completion is confirmed.    
B. 
Procurement of Goods, Works, and Consulting Services 
188.  All  procurement  of  goods  and  works  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB’s 
Procurement  Policy  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  its  associated  project 
administration instructions and staff instructions. 
189.  Before  the  start  of  any  procurement,  ADB  and  the  government  will  review  the  public 
procurement  laws  of  the  central  and  state  governments  to  ensure  consistency  with  ADB’s 
Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time). The Harmonized Standard Bidding

contracts  through  shopping  and  nationally-advertised  open  competitive  bidding  (OCB)  duly 
following the NCB annex in the procurement plan.  
190.  The  18-month  procurement  plan,  which  is  in  Annex  8  Procurement  Plan  (Updated), 
indicates  the  goods,  works,  and  consulting  service  contract  packages,  review  and  bidding 
procedures.  
191.  All  consultants  and  nongovernment  organizations  (NGO)  will  be  recruited  according  to 
ADB’s Procurement Policy 2017. The terms of reference for all consulting services are detailed in 
Section C. 
C. 
Consultant's Terms of Reference 
192.  The detailed consultant’s terms of reference are provided in Annexes 2, 9, 10, 15, 16, 17 
and  18.  The  project  implementation  will  be  supported  by  the  following  consultant  services 
packages: 
(i) 
Start Up Consultants (package OP5-CS011/1; Annex 13: Terms of Reference for 
International  Project  Management  Start-Up  Consultant  and  National  Start-up 
Procurement Specialist) 
a)  An international project management start-up consultant for 12 person-
months  recruited  using  individual  consultant  selection  (ICS)  who  has 
78 
in  project  management,  procurement  and  project 
experience 
management  systems,  preferably  at  least  ten  years. The  role  will  work 
closely with PGT and the respective PPITs in each province to advance 
the start-up through building project implementation teams, ensuring all 
are staff as agreed, ensure all are fully aware of the project, roles and 
responsibilities and the systems that will be established in the first two 
quarters of the project calendar. 
(ii) 
A National Procurement Specialist. (package OP5CS011/2; Annex 13: Terms of 
Reference for International Project Management Start-up Specialist and National 
Start-up Procurement Specialist) 
a)  National Start-up Procurement Specialist for 15 months to be recruited 
as  individual  consultant  selection  (ICS)  according  to  ADB  CMS  and 
procurement procedures (2017). The consultant will work closely with the 
DOI PGT to prepare and oversee the contracting of the LIC teams for the 
Provinces plus the supporting service provider contracts.  
Both start up consultants will be eligible for roles in the DOI Loan Implementation 
Consultant team should the respective bidders (firm) and the individual agree on 
terms. This eligibility is included to encourage continuity that will reduce the risks 
of delays during the handover during the DOI LIC mobilization. 
(iii) 
DOI  LIC  (package  OP5-CS01;  Annex  2:  Terms  of  Reference  for  Loan 
Implementation Consultant (Updated)). Recruited as a firm using ADB’s CMS and 
QCBS procedures with a full technical proposal  due to the range of expertise being 
contracted  (mostly  project  management  and  governance  support)  reflecting  the 
changes to Project Governance and administration, and for technical innovation in 
terms of dry season irrigation, commercial agribusiness and market led high value 
crop systems necessitates quality technical inputs to ensure project effectiveness 
and sustainability. The team will be based in DOI, Vientiane, however, it will also 
support each of the Provincial IA with project management governance systems 
by working through the PGT in DOI.  
a)  The  DOI  team  will  comprise  (i)  project  management,  (ii)  financial 
management,  (iii)  procurement,  (iv)  monitoring  expertise,  along  with

skills  are  not  included  in  the  DOI  team  as  technical  input  is  the 
responsibility of each province 
(iv) 
Provincial IA (PAFO) LIC  
Recruited as a national company using ADB’s CMS and QCBS procedures based 
on a simplified technical proposal. Each provincial IA will be supported by their own 
LIC team of consultants, however contracting of these teams will be undertaken 
centrally  due  to  the  lack  of  experience  of  each  PAFO  in  the  contracting  of 
consulting services (See PRAMP survey findings). While contracted centrally, the 
Provincial  IAs  team  will  be  co-located  with  the  PAFO  PIT  and  will  report  to  the 
Director of the PIT and PAFO management. For each Provincial team the core role 
79 
is  a  Project  Management  role  to  support  the  PAFOs  in  overall  planning  and 
implementation of the SRIWSM.  In addition, water resource management roles 
(one  international  and  one  national)  are  included  in  the  Louangphabang  and 
Xiangkhouang teams with these roles supporting water resource management and 
planning  in  two  provinces  per  team.  Additional  technical  roles  are  provided  for 
watershed  management  planning  and  implementation  in  Xiangkhouang  and 
Houaphan provinces.  
a)  The Provincial LIC team is based on project management support and 
social  safeguards,  water  management  expertise  for  supporting  the 
planning  of  water  use  and  irrigation  scheme  operation  are  included  in

for subproject planning in two provinces for each team.  
b)  Each  Provincial  LIC  will  be  led  by  a  long-term  program  management 
advisor that will report to the assigned DDG of DOI and will work closely 
to ensure that project implementation efficiency is actively managed by 
both IAs and EAs.  
c)  The Houaphan and Xiangkhouang LIC teams include specialist support 
(unallocated in the ASP) but in Xiangkhouang RSP Nam Tong includes 
tea  and  livestock  sector  experts.  The  unallocated  person-months  are 
provided  to  support  technical  inputs  as  cropping  systems  and  markets 
are prioritized.

XI. 
SAFEGUARDS 
193.  ADB safeguard classifications and documents. All safeguard documents have been 
prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB  SPS  (2009).13
    The  safeguard  classifications  are  B  for 
environment, involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. MAF/Department of Irrigation are 
committed  to  implementing  safeguard  plans  and  adhering  to  ADB  and  the  government’s 
safeguard policies.   
194.  The  screening  of  the  long  list  of  proposed  subprojects  removed  any  known  significant 
resettlement risk.  Only category B and C PRI subprojects will be eligible for financing under the 
overall  project.    Most  civil  works  will  involve  rehabilitation  of  existing  irrigation  facilities,  and 
construction work will be carried out within the existing rights-of-way.  
195.  Public disclosure and consultation.  The draft IEEs and EMPs were disclosed on ADB 
website in June 2019, before Board approval.  The REGDF, EARF and EMPs will be translated 
into Laos language, and provided to the PPITs to be made available to interested stakeholders 
on request. The updated IEE/EMPs for RSPs and the IEE/EMPs, LARPs and/or due diligence 
reports for additional subprojects will be disclosed on ADB website prior to civil works contract 
awards.  Semi-annual  safeguard  monitoring  reports  will  be  disclosed  following  review. 
Consultation  with  affected  persons  and  key  stakeholders  has  been  carried  out  during  project 
preparation and will be ongoing during implementation as described in the safeguard documents. 
Consultation will include individual and focus group discussions to ensure the affected households 
impacts,  asset  valuation/RCS,  entitlements  and 
are 
compensation  payment  modalities  with  time  lines,  (b)  rehabilitation  and  income  restoration 
measures suggested for the project affected persons, (c) environmental impacts and mitigation 
measures;  and  (d)  project  grievance  redress  mechanism.  See  section  IX.  Performance 
Monitoring,  Evaluation,  Reporting  and  Communication  for  safeguard  monitoring  and  reporting 
requirements. 
informed  about:  (a)  resettlement 
196.  During  implementation,  there  should  be  regular  liaison  with  affected  persons  and 
community,  consultation  meetings  with  communities  in  the  project  area  of  influence  and  with 
project  affected  persons,  including  women  and  vulnerable  groups,  to  ensure  project  related 
information is regularly shared. 
that 
197.  Project  safeguards  grievance  redress  mechanism.  ADB  SPS  requires 
Government establishes and maintains a project-specific grievance redress mechanism (GRM) 
to  receive  and  facilitate  resolution  of  affected  peoples’  concerns  about  project  social  and 
environmental performance.   PGT and PPITs will establish the GRM, as detailed in safeguard 
plans within 60 days of the loan effectiveness date, or before implementation of land acquisition 
activities,  whichever  is  the  earliest.  The  GRM  comprises  a set  of  clear  procedures  to receive, 
record,  and  address  concerns  or  complaints  raised  about  project  safeguard  issues  at  village, 
district and provincial level. GRM Focal Points from the PGT, PPITs, contractor teams and districts 
will be identified.  Contact details will be disclosed at construction sites and contractor camps and 
each affected village. Affected persons will have the option of seeking redress through the existing 
country system  or through the  project GRM.  The  PPIT  will  report monthly  on  the GRM  to  the 
13  Available at: http://www.adb.org/documents/safeguard-policy-statement    
83 
PGT.  The PGT will monitor and report on GRM to ADB in quarterly project progress reports and 
semi-annual safeguards monitoring reports. 
198.  Prohibited  investment  activities.  Pursuant  to  ADB’s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement 
(2009),  ADB  funds  may  not  be  applied  to  the  activities  described  on  the  ADB  Prohibited 
Investment Activities List set forth at Appendix 5 of the Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). 
B. 
Environmental Safeguards 
199.  Environment assessments.  Four RSPs have been assessed, three (Louangphabang, 
Xiangkhouang and Houaphan) were classified as category B for environment and IEEs and EMPs 
have been prepared.  The fourth RSP (Xaignabouli) was classified as category C for environment, 
a review of implications and an Environmental Code of Conduct was prepared. Proposed works 
under the project are mostly rehabilitation of existing schemes, anticipated environmental impacts 
are  mostly  minor  and  short-term  and  limited  to  the  construction  phase.  These  impacts  can  be 
readily addressed through effective implementation of measures specified in the EMP.  
200.  An EARF was agreed with the Government which provides guidance on future subproject 
selection, screening, assessment and implementation.  The EARF will be applied to additional 
subprojects under Output 3 and any other civil works proposed under other outputs.  Additional 
subprojects under Output 3 have already been screened and determined eligible for financing. If 
new subprojects are introduced to the long list, pre-screening will be undertaken by a consultant 
acceptable to ADB to ensure conformity with PRI subproject eligibility criteria at the cost of the 
Government. Any subprojects classified as Category A will not be eligible and will be excluded 
from  financing.  Environmental  Compliance  Certificates  will  be  obtained  from  the  relevant 
Provincial Department of Natural Resources and Environment prior to civil works. 
201.  The  key  environmental  issues  to  be  addressed  during  detailed  design  of  RSPs  and 
additional subprojects are: (1) sustainable water use to ensure that volume of offtake does not 
have an adverse impact on downstream users and riparian ecosystems; and (2) ensuring that 
agrichemical inputs are used in accordance with good agriculture practice. Detailed engineering 
design  will  assess  permissible  quantities  of  water  offtake  during  the  dry  season  that  maintain 
adequate flow for downstream users and environmental flows and takes into account potential 
climate  change  impacts  on  water  availability.  The  project  will  also  support  the  capacity 
development of WUAs and WUGs and integrated pest management approaches. The introduction 
of  land  zoning  in  catchment  areas  of  reservoirs  will  minimize  inappropriate  land  use  activities 
within the catchment and reduce the risk of siltation of streams while assuring dry season. 
202.  The LIC safeguard Specialists will provide safeguards capacity development training for 
PGT,  PPIT,  LIC,  Contractors  and  GRM  focal  points  on  safeguard  mitigation  and  monitoring 
measures, Contractor EMP preparation, templates for environmental monitoring and report. LIC 
safeguard specialists will screen and assess additional subprojects proposed under Output 3 and 
any  other  infrastructure  requiring  civil  works  under  other  outputs  and  prepare  the  safeguards 
reports  and  ensure  that  RSP  safeguard  reports  are  updated  based  on  detailed  engineering 
design.   
203.  The  Contractor  will  be  required  to  develop  a  site-specific  Construction  Environmental 
Management  Plan  (CEMP)  in  accordance  with  the  IEE/EMP  and  designate  an  environmental 
health and safety (EHS) Officer to supervise and train workers on occupational and community 
health  and  safety  practices  and  to  monitor  and  report  on  implementation  of  EMP/CEMP  and 
corrective  actions.    A  GRM  focal  point/community  liaison  officer  should  also  be  designated  to 
84 
ensure public disclosure of planned construction to affected persons and monitoring and reporting 
on GRM.  Each works Contractor EHS Officer will prepare a monthly report on EMP/CEMP and 
GRM implementation for submission to PPIT, PGT and LIC.   
204.  The construction supervision consultants (CSC) will ensure a CEMP is prepared for each 
Category B subproject and an Environmental Code of Conduct for each Category C subproject.  
The CSC will be responsible for day to day monitoring of implementation of health and safety and 
EMP/Code of Conduct requirements and issuing instructions for corrective actions, as needed. 
C. 
Social Safeguards 
205. 
Involuntary resettlement (Category B). MAF and ADB have agreed upon a combined 
resettlement  and  ethnic  group  development  framework  (REGDF),  through  which  two  Land 
Acquisition and Resettlement Plans and two Due Diligence Plans were prepared for the four RSPs 
and  publicly  disclosed.14  The  plans  are  supported  by  public  consultation  and  disclosure,  with 
minor impacts of land acquisition and compensation for roadside trees, crops, or small structures 
within the right-of-way for which compensation, allowances, surveys, monitoring, and reporting 
will be financed from ADB loan proceeds. The impacts will be monitored, evaluated, and reported 
semiannually to ADB by MAF. 
Indigenous peoples (category B). Impacts on indigenous peoples, referred to as ethnic 
206. 
groups in Lao PDR, are overwhelmingly positive as they are fully integrated into the subproject 
communities  and  will  share  in  the  project  benefits.  The  project  will  not  cause  physical 
displacement from traditional or customary lands, nor will it negatively impact the identity, culture, 
or  customary  livelihood  systems  of  the  ethnic  groups.  The  combined  resettlement  and  ethnic 
group development framework will be used to prepare resettlement and ethnic group development 
plans  that  include  mitigation  measures  to  address  impacts,  institutional  capacity  development 
programs, a grievance redress mechanism, and compliance with ADB’s  information disclosure 
and consultation requirements. 
207.  The  REGDF  which  includes  a  community  participation  framework  and  a  resettlement 
framework  provides  guidance  on  future  subproject  selection,  screening,  assessment  and 
implementation.  The REGDF will be applied to additional subprojects under Output 3 and any 
other  civil  works  proposed  under  other  outputs.    Additional  subprojects  under  Output  3  have 
already been screened and determined eligible for financing. If new subprojects are introduced to 
the  long  list,  pre-screening  will  be  undertaken  by  a  consultant  acceptable  to  ADB  to  ensure 
conformity with PRI subproject eligibility criteria at the cost of the Government. Any subprojects 
classified as Category A will not be eligible and will be excluded from financing.  
208.  Voluntary land donation and negotiated settlement are accepted through the community 
participation  framework.  Specific  conditions  for  direct  beneficiares  of  the  project  are  provided 
within  the  REGDF  that  limit  donations  to  9%  of  the  affected  plot  and  that  severely  affected 
households and households identified to be economically vulnerable are not eligible for donation.  
209.  The most likely resettlement issue will come from relocation of delivery canals to improve 
water  utilization  efficiency.  The  REGDF  outlines  specific  requirements  for  the  management  of 
such  instances,  within  an  overall  requirement  that  the  affected  households  that  experience 
impacts  shall  be  supported  through  mitigation,  livelihood  restoration,  or  compensation  options

of forest land will be impacted by the project.  (b) 52 households hold a total of 60 
land parcels identified in the DMS as being affected by the irrigation project. Of 
these 60 plots affected, 31 are eligible for compensation through the Community 
Participation  Framework  and  29  are  eligible  for  compensation  through  the 
Resettlement  Framework.  (c)  The  project  has  identified  5  vulnerable  AHHs. 
Twenty-nine  severely  affected  HHs  are  eligible  to  participate  in  livelihood  and 
income restoration activities under Output 1. (d) No secondary structures, trees or 
crops are affected (no dry season cropping along access road). There will be no 
dismantling of residential structures, or impact on graves or businesses. (e) A Land 
Acquisition and Resettlement Plan was prepared. (f) The village in the project area 
comprise of two ethnic groups: 89% are of Phuan and 11% are Hmong. Special 
measures, to ensure equitable access to information and opportunities provided 
by the project, such as improved consultation materials and approaches shall be 
utilized for all ethnic groups within the project area.  
RSP  Nam  Seng:  (a)  The  total  number  of  affected  households  (AHH)  is  106 
consisting of 6032 affected people (AP). Of these 106 HH, 93 Households have 
land  plots  eligible  for  compensation  through  the  Community  Participation 
Framework and 33 Households have land plots eligible for compensation through 
the  Resettlement  Framework.  Note  that  several  households  have  multiple  plots 
affected.  This includes 9 AHH affected on their residential land (691m2). (b) The 
project has 10 vulnerable AHHs (64 APs). 33 severely affected HHs are eligible to 
participate in livelihod and income restoration activities under Output 1. (c)  The 
total area of agricultural land affected by the project is 38,007 m2. Two (2 AHHs) 
secondary structures (toilets) are affected. There is no dismantling of residential 
structures, or impact on graves or businesses. 523 trees are affected in the project 
area of which most are Teak trees aged 6 years or more. (d) A Land Acquisition 
and Resettlement Plan was prepared. (e)  8. 57.2% of the AHHs are of Lao-Tai, 
19.8% are Hmong, 26% are Khmu,, 4.2% are Prai and 1% are Nyouan. Special 
measures, to ensure equitable access to information and opportunities provided 
by the project, such as improved consultation materials and approaches shall be 
utilize for all ethnic groups within the project area. 
RSP  Nam  Poua: (a)  A  total  of  22  households  consisting  of  122  affected  people 
(AP) have 24 land plots impacted. Of these 24 plots affected, 17 are eligible for 
compensation through the Community Participation Frameworks and 7 are eligible 
for compensation through the Resettlement Framework. 7 severely affected HHs 
are eligible to participate in livelihod and income restoration activities under Output 
1.  (b) A total of 4,071 m2 of agricultural land will be impacted by the sub-project. 
Within the 24 parcels of the existing irrigation in 4 villages,16 are used as garden 
land and 8 as paddy fields.  One garden in Houaphan has 25 small orange trees 
on it. (c) No houses or permanent structures are affected therefore there is no need 
for  any  relocation.  (d)  The  location  of  the  bridges  has  been  confirmed  and,  the 
approaches  to the  bridges will  connect to the  existing  roads  via  communal  land 
which is reserved for this purpose. Validation of land ownership will be undertaken 
86 
during  implementation.  (e)  A  Land  Acquisition  and  Resettlement  Plan  was 
prepared. (f) There are 4 Hmong, 1 Lu-Mien and 17 Lao-Tai affected households. 
Special  measures,  to  ensure  equitable  access  to  information  and  opportunities 
provided by the project, such as improved consultation materials and approaches 
shall be utilize for all ethnic groups within the project area.

RSP Phieng 1 and 2. Was found to have no land acquisition and no issues with 
ethnic groups and was categorized C for IR and IP. A DDR has been prepared. 
211. 
Institutional arrangements for implementation of safeguards. The PGT will appoint 
qualified  safeguards  officers  to  supervise  and  coordinate  implementation  of  social  and 
environmental safeguard requirements with support and capacity building as needed from the LIC 
International and National Safeguard Specialists. The PGT Project Director will be responsible for 
submitting safeguard reports to ADB for clearance and disclosure. They will also carry out regular 
monitoring during implementation and prepare a summary of progress of the safeguard measures 
and GRM implementation for the quarterly project progress reports. They will participate in ADB 
loan  review  missions,  ensure  that  semi-annual safeguards monitoring reports  are  submitted to 
ADB on time and follow-up on agreed actions.  The LIC will provide capacity-building orientation 
and skills training, as needed, to concerned personnel of the PPIT and other agencies that maybe 
involved in resettlement implementation. 
212.  Each PPIT will nominate a social and environmental safeguards focal point to support LIC 
Environment Specialists and PGT with co-ordination at the province and district level.  The PPIT 
safeguards focal points will undertake joint site visits with subproject Supervision Consultants and 
Contractors to review implementation of safeguard plans and GRM and report issues to PGT and 
LIC.  PPIT will co-ordinate environmental quality monitoring with PONRE and invite PONRE to 
join site visits and ADB loan review missions. 
213.  The preparation of LARPs will be overseen by the LIC and will work with the PGT service 
provider for surveys such as SESAH, DMS, IOL. The requirements for these are detailed in the 
REGDF, and it is expected that each PAFO will assign a staff member as a focal point to work 
with the resettlement teams and to monitor the day to day implementation of each LARP.  The 
PPIT  safeguards  focals  will  assist  in  preparing  and  updating  the  LACPs  in  a  participatory  and 
transparent way and consistent with the project resettlement policy. Once approved by DONRE 
and reviewed and concurred by ADB, the LIC will provide technical advice in the implementation 
of  the  approved  LARP  and  provide  sufficient  information  regarding  the  completion  of 
compensation and the provision of livelihoood income restoration support. The PGT will contract 
an external monitor for resettlement and the LARP implementation.  
214.  ADB will visit project sites and review project performance against the  safeguard plans 
and legal agreements and as documented in periodic safeguard monitoring reports submitted by 
the PGT. If any of the safeguard requirements that are covenanted in the legal agreements are 
found  not  to  be  satisfactorily  met,  ADB  will  require  the  PGT  to  develop  and  implement  an 
appropriate  corrective  action  plan  (CAP)  agreed  upon  with  ADB.  If  unanticipated  safeguard 
impacts become apparent during project implementation, ADB will require the PGT with support 
of  LIC  to  (i)  assess  the  significance  of  such  unanticipated  impacts;  (ii)  evaluate  the  options 
available to address them; and (iii) prepare or update the safeguard plans. 
In case of any discrepancy through independent verification, direct meetings with AHHs or the 
GRM  (at  project  level  or  directly  to  ADB),  on  the  voluntary  nature  of the donations  by  the  EA, 
87 
External Monitor or the ADB, this option will be withdrawn from this REGDF and eminent domain 
shall be applied as per the entitlement matrix for all cases without exclusion. 
215.  Safeguard responsibilities and roles. These will lie with PGT for the establishment of 
safeguard systems based on the respective REGDF and EARF. For the REGDF each PGT will 
be responsible for the completion and the approval of the safeguard documentation required for 
the  approval  of  each  subproject.  Once  approved,  the  implementation  of  safeguards  will  be 
overseen by the PGT – this will include (i) LIC support, (ii) an external monitor to ensure that the 
provision on each LARP have been applied. Ultimately the EA is responsible for the safeguard 
requirements in the project and for ensuring these are implemented correctly. As such, PGT will 
need  to  ensure  that  its  systems  and  reviews  are  closely  aligned  to  the  respective  safeguard 
frameworks. As no subproject can be approved without a safeguard approval if the safeguards 
are not completed on time severe delays may arise. In this respect, the ADB review of safeguard 
documentation  will  be  provided  within  20  working  days  of  document  submission.  Government 
decision-making also needs to be expedited, however, delayed decisions comes at its own cost, 
so it is not specified. 
216.  Climate and disaster risk. The project is classified as being at medium risk from climate 
change impacts, flood, landslide, tropical cyclones and depressions. A climate vulnerability and 
disaster  risk  assessment  has  been  prepared  and  makes  recommendations  on  parameters  for 
engineering  design  and  for  agricultural  systems  and  PLUPs  to  improve  climate  and  disaster 
resilience of subproject infrastructure and target upland catchments.  These requirements have 
been integrated in the TORs and specifications for detailed design. 
XII.  GENDER AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS 
A. 
Gender 
217.  The overall project aims to improve agriculture productivity in the FNP through provision 
of  infrastructure  and  associated  initiatives.  The  overall  project  is  classified  as  ‘Gender  Equity 
(GEN)’ under the ADB guidelines of March 2010. 
218.  The overall project can provide women in target communities with improved infrastructure 
that  will  increase  productivity  and  incomes,  improve  mobility,  empower  women  by  creating 
opportunities  to  participate  in  decision-making,  lessen  women's  work  burdens  and  save  time. 
Further benefits are identified through the nutrition program of output 4, and the increased access 
to  HVC  markets  and  time  saving  technologies  within  the  irrigation  schemes.  To  ensure  these 
results, appropriate actions need to be undertaken, though gender mainstreaming knowledge and 
skills are lacking across implementing agencies. 
219.  The  PGT  leader  will  ensure  that  staff  are  assigned  to  the  Project  from  the  Women’s 
Advancement Unit of MAF to oversee and implement the GAP (section VIII). The gender focal 
points  across  all  IAs  will  be  existing  personnel  from  the  Women’s  Advancement  Unit’s  at  the 
respective level of the Government Administration.

Monitoring 
1. 
Monitoring Framework 
221.  The M&E system will be implemented to report progress against timelines, budgets, and 
project outputs as well as the impact of these outputs on the stated project outcome. The M&E is 
structured around the two objectives, being: 
(i) 
Project Implementation Efficiency - the need for IA management and their superiors to track 
implementation is critical, given their responsibility and accountability for implementation 
and given the additional risks that derive from decentralization that SRIWSM applies. The 
different risks and their dispersed nature from decentralization also means that both the EA 
(MAF)  and  ADB  require  accurate  and  timely  information  on  these  risks.  The  early 
identification  of  risks  arising  from  delays,  failings  or  external  events  will  use  a  variance 
reporting  model  where  actual  achievement  and  planned  implementation  (i.e.,  workplan, 
93 
budget and cashflow projections including contract awards and disbursement, procurement 
plan implementation, contract management, safeguard monitoring and management plans, 
GAP  action  plans) are compared and reported.   Performance reports  will show planned 
start and completion dates for activities, and slippage in meeting these dates, by duration, 
activity and institution. Effectiveness monitoring will be built on monthly reporting within the 
IAs as required by the Government. 
(ii) 
Project  Effectiveness  –  on  the  extent  that  the  outputs  being  achieved  contribute  to  the 
stated  outcome  within  the  DMF.  Effectiveness  reporting  seeks  to  build  longitudinal  data 
series that enable behavioral change to be identified and tracked along with the impact of 
these changes.  Effectiveness will be measured on a range of specified indicators – mostly 
quantitative but supported with qualitative reporting.  This will provide a longitudinal basis 
for  measuring  project  effectiveness  throughout  the  project  implementation  period.  The 
effectiveness  monitoring  will  be  built  on  a  bi-annual  reporting  system  to  align  with  the 
completion of one growing season with understanding the plans for the upcoming season. 
Effectiveness reporting will be structured around project outputs within each of the IAs with 
data aggregated at both subproject, district and provincial levels. 
222.  Project progress and performance will be assessed using data to report on the indicators 
and targets shown in the DMF (see above). 
C. 
Project Efficiency – Implementation 
223.  Within project implementation, efficiency, monitoring, and reporting will be completed for 
the  following:  (i)  implementation  progress  monitoring;  (ii)  safeguard  monitoring;  and  (v)  loan 
agreement covenant monitoring. 
1. 
Implementation progress 
224. 
Implementation  progress  monitoring  will  be  the  responsibility  of  each  IA  that  will 
establish a contract monitoring system in the Planning and Finance Section of PAFO through the 
PPIT. A staff member will be assigned to the role and will be the focal point for monitoring. The 
role will need to work closely with all PPIT with implementation roles to develop, implement and 
report  the  implementation  progress.  To  establish  the  baseline  for  the  variance  reporting  the 
monitoring staff member will work closely with the planning and financial staff members and the 
LIC  Provincial  Project  Management  Advisor  to  ensure  the  tasks  and  timing  of  these  tasks  are 
clearly defined within the annual work plans and then included as reporting baselines. 
225.  The PGT Project Start-Up advisor will establish planning templates for each output and 
the specific subprojects within these templates will be used across all IAs/PPIT’s. The PGT will 
manage the consolidation of the work plans and the reporting of implementation progress. At the 
subproject,  district  and  output  level  the  work  planning  templates  will  be  consolidated  into  a 
Provincial Performance Monitoring System (PPMS) PPMS and at the national level into a Project 
wide PPMS by the PGT - DOI.  
226.  The  PPMS  will  be  managed  by  the  PPIT  –  PAFO  who  will  (i)  maintain  the  data  and 
reporting archive for Government and ADB reviews, and (ii) report updated progress according to 
the requirements of Provincial Government (monthly), and (iii) report to National Government and 
ADB on a quarterly basis. A consolidated project PPMS will be managed by the PGT - DOI where 
the  overall  project  archive  will  be  maintained.  Data  and  reporting  archives  are  expected  to  be 
included in the cloud base data systems with viewer access to DOPF, MAF and ADB.  
94 
227.  Operational  efficiency  implementation,  monitoring,  and  reporting  will  be  linked  to  the 
Provincial  Government’s  monthly  reporting  cycle,  where  PAFO/DAFO  staff  or  consultants  with 
work plan implementation responsibilities will be required to report their work progress to the PPIT 
monitoring  focal  point  who,  with  the  project  management  advisor,  will  assemble  the  data  and 
monthly reports. This will include financial management staff who will generate financial reporting 
data from the Project accounting system as per the Financial Management Manual (Section V). 
The reporting monthly will be through the Project Management advisor to the DG-PAFO and from 
there to each Provincial Governors Office. Quarterly financial reports will aggregate the 3 monthly 
cash flow variance reports, contract award and disbursement reports, and contract management 
reports into a single report with all variances, and management response to variances reported. 
These will be combined with the operational efficiency reports. 
228.  The  PPMS  will  monitor  implementation  progress  including  activities  by  subproject  and 
output  in  the  respective  provinces.  To  augment  information  collected  during  SRIWSM  design, 
additional  data  will  be  collated  from  the  additional  subproject  DED  studies  that  will  baseline 
datasets for both efficiency and effectiveness monitoring purposes. This will define (i) activities, 
(ii)  the  implementation  timelines  and  milestones,  (iii)  output  delivery  progress,  (iv)  final  output, 
and  (v)  expected  contribution  of  each  subproject  output  to  the  outcome  indicators.  This 
information will first enter the monitoring system through the annual work plan forecasts and then 
through the monthly and quarterly reporting programs. The efficiency implementation monitoring 
will not directly assess the contribution to the project impact.  
229.  Each subproject will have monthly reports and a contract completion report prepared by 
the  construction  supervision  consultant  that  will  include  details  of  (i)  contract  implementation 
progress, (ii) implementation delays or issues and the resolution or ongoing status of these issues, 
(iii)  completed  outputs  after  road  completion.  Where  a  variance  has  persisted  without 
management response, these will be flagged as red (Part IX.D below). The quarterly reports are 
transmitted per the monthly reports, with inclusion of the PGT DOI as in the Governor’s office. 
The  PPIT  monitoring  staff  member  will  collate  this  into  provincial  level  reports  and  submit  this 
through  the  DG  PAFO  to  the  PGT–DOI  who  will  consolidate  these  into  an  overall  Project 
Performance data base and reporting system that can be used for post evaluation purposes.  
230.  The scope of work for the efficiency implementation monitoring will include (i) annual work 
plan,  (ii)  the  annual  budget  and  cashflow  forecast,  (iii)  procurement  planning,  (iv)  contract 
management  and  completion  progress, 
land  acquisition  and  compensation  plan 
(v) 
implementation,  (vi)  environmental  management  and  monitoring  plans,  and  (vii)  the  GAP 
implementation plan. 
2. 
Safeguard Monitoring 
231.  Each IA will have (i) staff responsible for environment and social safeguards and GRM 
monitoring,  and  (ii)  a  memorandum  of  understanding  with  the  Provincial  Office  of  Natural 
Resources  and  Environment  (PONRE)  for  environmental  quality  monitoring.  The  PPIT 
environmental  focal  point  and  the  Program  Management  Advisor  to  the  PGT  will  ensure 
monitoring are completed and reported in a timely manner based on an MOU established between 
PAFO and PONRE through the Governors’ Office. All issues whether resolved or outstanding will 
be  reported  within  the  month  of  identification.  Issues  remaining  unresolved  for  more  than  one 
month will be elevated to the DG PAFO, and the PGT monitoring advisor. 
232.  Safeguards  monitoring  systems  and  associated  grievance  redress  mechanisms  will  be 
developed to ensure that the required policies, procedures and plans for: (i) resettlement including 
95 
land acquisition and compensation; (ii) ethnic minority peoples’ specific actions are implemented 
and  achieve  their  expected  outcomes  during  subproject  preparation,  implementation  and 
operation; and (iii) EMP plan implementation. 
233.  The PGT with support from the LIC will be responsible for internal monitoring of the LACP 
implementation. Resettlement monitoring reports will include progress on the status of the LACP 
implementation,  information  on  location  and  number  of  people  affected,  land  acquisition  and 
compensation status, and assistance provided to displaced people and vulnerable people. This 
should  include  georeferenced  information  of  each  household,  linked  to  household  level 
documents such as the inventory of loss, detailed measurement surveys and any other household 
level  document  generated.  All  data  collected  should  be  included  within  a  database.  The  ADB 
review  missions  will  monitor  and  assess  the  resettlement  activities  during  the  project 
implementation period.  
234. 
Internal monitoring will be carried out by PPIT safeguard focal with support from the LIC. 
The  PPIT  safeguard  focal  will  conduct  internal  monitoring  by  (i)  regular  meetings  with  the 
representatives of the affected people; (ii) holding group discussions with all or representatives of 
severely affected households; (iii) meeting with marginally affected households; and (iv) meeting 
with all or representatives of the ethnic minority groups.  
235.  The principal indicators for monitoring of resettlement activities include: 
a.  timely and complete disbursement of compensation to affected households according 
to the compensation policy agreed in the REGDP, 
b.  timely income restoration and rehabilitation allowances and measures, 
c.  allocation of replacement land, 
d.  public information dissemination and consultation procedures, 
e.  adherence  to  grievance  procedures  and  identification  of  outstanding  issues  that 
require further attention and resolution, 
f.  attention  given  to  the  priorities  of  affected  households  regarding  the  compensation 
options offered, 
g.  completion of resettlement activities required by start of civil works, 
h.  record  participation  of  poor  and  vulnerable  households  throughout  the  consultation 
process, and 
restoration and improvement of socioeconomic conditions of affected households. 
i. 
236.  Adequate  mapping  and  documentation 
implementation. The principal requirements are as follows: 
is  required  to  support 
the  resettlement 
a.  Geo  referenced  maps  and/or  gps  readings  tagged  with  unique  identifiers 
(household numbers). 
b.  Maps along alignment that shows land to be acquired, land remaining for AH (if 
any), structures to be impacted (either through gps readings or on google earth 
map) and corridor of impact. 
c.  Photos of each affected household (preferably with all persons present) to be taken 
in front of their abode, with their household ID (unique identifier). Consent should 
be sought prior to photo taking and should the household refuse, a signed letter 
declining the photo is to be provided. 
d.  All documents (IoL, DMS, SESAH, compensation forms, grievances, family books 
etc) should include household IDs (unique identifier) both on the document and on 
e-files. 
96 
e.  All documents are compiled into a database for ease of reference and access to 
data. 
237.  The focus of internal monitoring will be as follows: 
a.  confirmation  on  the  number  of  severely  affected  households  due  to  the  loss  of 
productive agricultural land;  
b.  confirmation  on  the  number  of  severely  affected  households  due  to  the  loss  of 
residential structures; 
c.  confirmation on the number of permanent loss of land and assets and temporary 
impacts; 
d.  impact on vulnerable household; 
e.  report on the methodology and approach utilized to determine compensation unit 
f. 
rates endorsed and approved by provincial authorities; 
reaching  agreement  with  the  affected  households  on  compensation  rates  and 
issuance of summary compensation forms; 
g.  documentation of affected people preference on rehabilitation measures; 
h.  detailed breakdown of resettlement expenses; 
i.  progress in the disbursement of compensation and other assistance in accordance 
j. 
k. 
with the implementation schedule and entitlement matrix; 
issuance of notice to harvest the crops, remove rubber trees and vacate the land 
as per schedule; 
information  dissemination  and  public  participation:  (a)  the  number  of  public 
consultation  meetings  held  during  the  preparation  of  the  detailed  compensation 
plan, (b) the number of affected households that participated, and (c) comments, 
suggestions,  and  concerns  of  the  affected  households  and  how  these  were 
addressed; 
l.  progress  in  the  implementation  of  the  LACPs:  progress  in  planning  and 
implementation of income rehabilitation measures including skill training; 
m.  smooth transition period between the payment of compensation and assistance to 
affected people and clearing of area prior to start of civil works; 
n.  grievance redress: the number of affected people with complaints, nature of the 
complaints, status of the resolution of the complaints, assessment of efficiency of 
the grievance redress mechanism (GRM); and 
o.  gender concerns: participation of women in meetings and in the implementation of 
resettlement,  concerns  of  women  in  connection  with  their  resettlement  and 
resolution of their grievances. 
238.  During  subsequent  monitoring periods, the  PMU  will  look  into the  issues and problems 
identified in the preceding reports and actions taken to address the problems in a timely manner. 
239.  External  monitoring  is  required  as  the  project  has  triggered  both  IR  and  IP  safeguards 
policy  and  a  qualified  independent  social  safeguards  expert  or  an  institution/agency  will  be 
recruited. 
240.  General objective of the external monitoring is to provide an independent verification of 
the  Borrower’s  monitoring  information  through  the  conducting  of  a  periodic  review  and 
assessment  of  (i)  achievement  of  resettlement  objectives;  (ii)  changes  in  living  standards  and 
livelihoods;  (iii)  restoration  of  the  economic  and  social  base  of  the  affected  people;  (iii) 
effectiveness,  impact,  and  sustainability  of  entitlements;  and  (iv)  need  for  further  mitigation 
measures  if  any.  Based  on  such  reviews  and  assessments,  strategic  lessons  for  future  policy 
97 
formulation and planning will be formulated. Project authorities will responsible for contracting a 
competent independent external monitoring agency (EMA), or an independent consultant, to carry 
out external monitoring of resettlement implementation in the project.  
241.  Specific objectives of external monitoring include: 
a.  to  provide  project  management  with  an  effective  tool  for  assessing  LACP 
implementation at various stages; 
b.  to  examine  whether  or  not  the  implementation  of  the  LACP  is  carried  out  as 
planned and in compliance with the approved LACP, and identify the strengths and 
weaknesses of the present LACP; 
to  identify  problem  areas  and  recommend  immediately  remedial  measures  for 
efficient implementation of the policy; 
c. 
d.  to provide inputs for future LACP formulation and implementation; 
e.  to assess the timely delivery of resettlement implementation and the effectiveness 
of income restoration and other rehabilitation measures for affected households, 
and  whether  the  affected  people,  including  vulnerable  households,  the  ethnic 
groups have been able to improve, or at least restore their livelihood and standard 
of living to pre-project level; and 
to  assess  effectiveness of  the  GRM  established for  the  project,  identify  specific 
problems if any, and suggest improvement of the GRM.  
f. 
242.  The monitoring of LACP implementation is intended to (i) ensure that the standard of living 
of affected persons are restored or improved, (ii) determine that the resettlement objectives are 
being met, (iii) assess that rehabilitation and compensation elements are sufficient, (v) identify 
problems  and  risks,  and  (vi)  where  gaps  are  identified,  come  up  with  adequate  measures  to 
mitigate resettlement problems. 
243.  Consequently  the  range  of  activities  and  issues  that  need  to  be  recorded  and  verified 
include:  (i)  compensation,  allowance  payments,  and  delivery  of  assistance  measures;  (ii)  re-
establishment of displaced person settlements and livelihoods; (iii) reaction of displaced persons 
to resettlement and compensation packages; and (iv) re-establishment of income levels.  
244.  For  resettlement  and  land  acquisition  plan  implementation,  an  external  monitoring 
contractor will be retained by the PGT. The external monitoring contractor will (i) work closely with 
the land acquisition and resettlement implementation teams to ensure that the integrity of work 
and the adoption of a best practice approach is established early in the project, and (ii) will validate 
the completeness of the LARP implementation to ensure all cases are appropriately addressed. 
The external monitoring contractor will report directly to the PGT, EA and ADB simultaneously on 
all findings.  
3. 
Compliance monitoring 
245.  The government and IAs have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, set 
forth in the loan agreement, which includes the following: 
(i) 
(ii) 
That  each  irrigation  scheme  in  the  Project  will  no  longer  be  included  in  the 
provincial or national register of required rice production areas for the dry season.  
irrigation  schemes 
irrigation 
The 
management transfer (IMT)  processes with  both WUG  and WUAs  established 
prior to the award of any works contract and shall formally identify the required 
ISF to enable operation and maintenance of the irrigation command area.  
the  Project  must  have  completed 
in 
98 
(iii) 
The  use  of  the  irrigation  service  fee  (ISF)  collected  by  WUAs  in  the  Project 
irrigation schemes shall be limited to the operation and maintenance requirement 
of  the  scheme  until  such  time  where  the WUAs  bank  account  has  a  year-end 
balance  of  at  least  two  years  operational  and  maintenance  requirements.  At 
which stage, the WUAs, based on majority member, will distribute to village or 
district officials any funds in excess of this amount; and 
(iv) 
The government will ensure that a grievance redress mechanism established in 
RPs/REMDPs for affected people in the participating districts will be implemented 
effectively and satisfactorily. 
246.  ADB  will  monitor  compliance  with  all  covenants  throughout  implementation  via  regular 
review missions, quarterly progress reports submitted by the IAs through the PGT, and review of 
project accounts and procurement procedures. Compliance reporting will be implemented by the 
Independent Safeguards monitoring contractor, the independent auditor, by each PPIT, and the 
PGT. 
4. 
Gender and social dimensions monitoring 
247.  Each PAFO shall assign a gender focal point for gender mainstreaming and reporting, and 
these roles will be supported through the LIC National Gender specialist. Each IA (including PAFO 
and  DOI)  will  appoint  a gender focal  point from the  PAFO Women’s  Advancement  Unit  or the 
MAF Women’s Advancement Unit, who will ensure that all Project staff and contractors are fully 
versed in gender requirements, that the project stakeholders are aware of gender equity and the 
GAP options, and to report the progress of the GAP implementation with recommendations for 
further  strengthening  as  lessons  are  learned.  The  detailed  terms  of  reference  for  the  gender 
specialist and gender focal point are in Annex 18. 
248.  The IA gender focal point will monitor and report on GAP implementation and outcomes 
through  the  PGT  to  ADB  as  part  of  each  2nd  quarter  report  using  the  ADB  GAP  monitoring 
template.  All  data  on  process  participation  and  beneficiaries  will  be  disaggregated  by  sex  and 
sensible15  ethnic  groups.  Routine  monitoring  by  the  Project  will  focus  on  assessing  progress 
against  GAP  activities  and  targets,  identifying  constraints  and  developing  remedial  actions  to 
effectively address these. Monitoring results will be included in at least every second quarterly 
progress  reports,  and  assessment/evaluations  of  the  GAP  will  be  an  essential  element  of  all 
reviews.  
A. 
Project Effectiveness  
1. 
Overview 
249.  Project effectiveness monitoring seeks to build data sets that demonstrate what changes 
are adopted by farmers for both the wet and dry season water use and agricultural production in 
terms of: output 1 – Irrigated and upland farmers with income increased from HVC and livestock; 
output  2  -  catchment  watershed  ecological  service  protected  in  Xiangkhouang  through  the 
adoption  of  improved  soil,  water,  and  use  of  perennial  vegetation  and  non-destructive  forest 
practices; output 3 - PRI upgraded to be climate resilient, efficient, and sustainable that will report 
the completion of modernized irrigation systems and their management by WUG; and output 4 
Improved nutrition status of targeted communities. Findings or changes will be interpreted into

reduced. 
how  the  changes  contribute  to  the  project  outcome  being  “Sustainable,  market  oriented 
agricultural production and natural resources management in selected watersheds with improved 
community nutrition”.

Digital and Telephone Data Collection  
250.  A key feature of the effectiveness monitoring will be the use of an automated, digital data 
collection and aggregation platform based on the proprietary mobile phone and data systems16 
or a local equivalent that manage data collection and reporting for decision makers. The system 
will use data collection templates developed by the monitoring and technical team within the IAs, 
these  will  be  piloted,  and then once final,  they will  be  used  to  establish  a  baseline  and then  a 
longitudinal time series data set.  
251.  The time series will be based on the forms being sent via SMS to (i) village leaders, (ii) 
water user group leaders, (iii) water users, (iv) district nutrition committee chairpersons, (v) village 
nutrition  school  members,  and  (vi)  catchment  farmers.  The  delivery  of  the  templates  will  be 
through automated phone calling in the form of text messages via mobile phone. On receipt of 
the SMS, recipients will be expected to reply within a set period during which they will collect data 
and fill the forms in on their phones and return the form by text message. The SRIWSM sender 
will  receive  an  aggregated  excel  of  the  responses  that  will  be  linked  back  to  the  SRIWSM 
monitoring team.  
252.  The  data  base  will  link  to  a  prepared  data  assessment  worksheet  that  will  produce 
tabulated variance data files that will form the basis of six-monthly reports on progress to achieve 
outputs and outcomes. The forms will all be in Laos language, while the data reporting output can 
be in either Laos or English as the fields are all locked. 
253.  Social  Cops  Limited  offers  an  annual  subscription  service  to  distribute  the  question 
templates and provide by way of return text call the receipt of respondent data, and the provision 
of aggregated data within excel files to the PGT monitoring experts. The respondents and Project 
stakeholders will receive rapid benchmarking data reports, and their Village Development Fund 
or WUA will receive an agreed payment to cover the costs of phone transmission.  
254.  The  objective  is  to  provide  (i)  subproject  level  effectiveness  measures  and  reports,  (ii) 
provincial  output  and  outcome  level  progress  reports,  (iii)  overall  project  output  and  outcome 
progress reports, using consistent longitudinal data series that will be used to inform the project 
mid-term review and final project completion reporting. 
255.  Kobotoolbox will require the project to set up the forms and then use a no-cost account to 
access the phone transmission and data receipt services. Kobotoolbox is a suite of tools for field 
data collection for use in challenging environments. The software is open source, as such it has 
16 The TRTA has reviewed two such options (i) being based out of India https://socialcops.com/ which offers a service 
for fee option, and (ii) http://help.kobotoolbox.org/getting-started/welcome/welcome-to-kobotoolbox -which is an open 
source software that can be customized and provides the same range of services. 
101 
not direct costs associated with its use with the advantage of working offline as well as on line. 
The platform will integrate easily with the proposed SRIWSM cloud-based information system.  
256.  Most  reported  applications  are  linked  to  humanitarian  crises,  however  there  are 
applications that have used the process to monitor complex agricultural programs including data 
collection from field or producer level using bar coding effectively establishing traceability. The 
software is supported by a team of developers, designers, and researchers-based places around 
the world.  Kobotoolbox was built for human rights and donor professionals. Currently, our users 
range from city and state government officials, search and rescue teams, UN agencies, large and 
small NGOs, to business consulting and accounting firms. There is potential to use this as a cost 
efficiency tool for the monthly work plan reporting required by Government as the data would not 
move outside the public sector assuring its security.   
257.  The major difference is that the role of developing data collection forms would fall on the 
IAs with support from the LIC and IT support roles. This will also require field-based training and 
protocols for the people to be included in the surveys. Having the IA and LIC develop the data 
collection forms would be beneficial in building deeper understanding of what the project needs 
in terms of information and what it is seeking to achieve.   
258.  Under  either  option, the respondents  will  receive  (i)  a smart  phone  that will  remain the 
property of the project for a period of at least 3 years and for which the respondent gets daily use, 
(ii) A phone credit that will cover the costs of the required responses plus provide an incentive. 
The data collection will be twice yearly to coincide with the cropping season.  For every correct 
survey response, the respondent will receive their phone credit automatically from the respective 
IA.  
259.  The form submitted will be consolidated in the PAFO level, grouped by subprojects being 
implemented in each province. The PPIT Reporting and M&E PAFO staff is assigned and trained 
to  export  this  consolidated  table  to  Excel  format  for  inputting  in  regular  6-monthly  and  annual 
reports for further submission to PGT at DOI. 
260.  Equally  important,  the  longitudinal  data  sets  will  provide  early  indicators  where  the 
integration of the proposed IFAD and GIZ GCF projects that are SARWSM parallel co-financed 
is  or  is  not  working,  so  the  Executing  Agency  and  the  National  Steering  Committee  can  take 
remedial  action.    For  example,  if  farmer  adoption  of  dry  season  irrigation  is  slow  or  has  other 
technical issues, this information will need to be communicated via the DG PAFO, the Provincial 
Steering Committees to the national steering committee, and MAF, to take appropriate actions.  
261.  The Project Management Advisor (with inputs from the National Monitoring Consultant) 
will work closely with the monitoring division of the DOPF, MAF in deciding which systems will be 
used. They will also lead to the process of establishing the templates, recipients, define and agree 
the timelines for providing with all recipients and their groups. Along with the provincial monitoring 
staff and project management advisers, the Monitoring Consultant will ensure that all project staff 
and beneficiaries are fully aware of the data collection systems, followed by data response training 
and data for benchmarking performance including running hands on training sessions. They will 
then form the baseline through the initial surveys and the reporting for the first two years covering 
(i) a benchmarking baseline, (ii) two six monthly reports for the year of contraction within the RSPs 
and  then,  the  following  wet  and  dry  season  irrigation  seasons.  After  this,  the  system  should 
increasingly be managed and operated by the PPIT monitoring staff.  
102 
B. 
Reporting  
262.  Reporting will build from the requirements of the Government which is based on monthly 
achievement  reports  from  each  Province  to  their  respective  Governor  and  Provincial 
Administration which currently are based on achievement of agreed outputs linked to the agreed 
National and Provincial sector targets. Within each PPIT monthly SRIWSM reporting will address 
the  implementation  efficiency  requirements  as  outlined  above  and  will  be  the  responsibility  of 
those  assigned to  the  different  roles  assigned  to  PAFO,  including  (i)  agribusiness  and  market 
connectivity program with supporting matching grants and extension programs, (ii) DALAM and 
DOF for the implementation of output 2 in Xiangkhouang for the proposed PLUP and supporting 
land use change programs, (iii) the head of the irrigation section for the processing of additional 
subprojects  through  to  approved  detailed  designs,  construction  supervision,  and  infrastructure 
commissioning and hand overs, and the strengthening of WUG/WUAs, (iv) output 4 through the 
contractor reports, and (v) the planning and finance section heads that will report progress against 
overall work plan and those tasks and activities delayed, financial management reporting in terms 
of disbursements to date compared project cashflows, amounts of advances outstanding without 
supporting documentation, procurement plan progress including delays or issues creating delays, 
safeguards implementation and GAP implementation progress. 
263.  On  a  quarterly  basis,  the  monthly  project  implementation  efficiency  reports  will  be 
consolidated and prepared in a consistent format to be part of the Project Management Manual 
provided by the PGT–DOI. Quarterly reports will be the responsibility of the PAFO staff person 
assigned to the monitoring role with support of the Project Management Advisor provided by the 
LIC. In addition, project effectiveness reporting will be provided every six months as part of the 
quarterly reporting program based on the proposed stakeholder survey program described above. 
Quarterly reports will be provided by PAFO to the Provincial Government and to the PGT–DOI 
who  will  consolidate  the  4  PAFO  reports  into  an  overall  SRIWSM  project  report.  The  DOI  will 
submit the report to PODF within 20 working days from the end of each quarter, and PODF will 
provide the report to MAF and ADB within 30 working days of the end of the reporting period. 
Indicative Monitoring Report Templates are provided in Annex 11. 
264.  Overall, MAF  will provide ADB with (i) quarterly progress reports in a format consistent 
with ADB's project performance reporting system; (ii) consolidated annual reports including (a) 
progress achieved by output as measured through the indicator's performance targets, (b) key 
implementation  issues  and  solutions,  (c)  updated  procurement  plan,  and  (d)  updated 
implementation plan for the next 12 months; and (iii) a project completion report within 6 months 
of physical completion of the project. To ensure that projects will continue to be both viable and 
sustainable, project accounts and the executing agency audited financial statement together with 
the associated auditor's report, should be adequately reviewed. 
C. 
Monitoring and Reporting 
265.  The  PGT  will  ensure  that  the  proposed  project  monitoring  and  reporting  systems  are 
undertaken as set out in Section IX of this PAM. This will include establishing the data collection 
and  reporting frameworks  developed for  SRIWSM  using  a mobile phone  platform  described  in 
Section IX of the PAM. The PGT will be the receiving point for the data and will be responsible for 
the data QA, reporting and feedback systems. Additional expertise for monitoring is included in 
the LIC and in the IT support contracts. 
266.  The PGT monitoring role will be assigned to a DOI staff member with experience of the 
Government monthly reporting. SRIWM progress reports (see Annex 12) will be undertaken on a 
103 
quarterly basis with reports passed to DOPF, MAF as part of the wider government and donor 
reporting.    PGT  will  confirm  report  formats,  and  the  level  of  data  for  both  the  implementation 
efficiency reporting of which the major project management challenge is to manage the risks of 
delays, and where delays arise having early responses to address the delays. 
267.  The  PGT  monitoring  staff,  with  support  from  LIC,  will  work  closely  with  each  PPIT  to 
develop and finalize the monitoring templates, provide training in their use and applications and 
mentor staff over the first 12 months. In doing so, they will ensure that the Provincial government’s 
monthly reporting requirements are completed and supported by the data collection systems of 
SRIWSM such that each PPIT- PAFO is able to report on SRIWSM to their respective Governors 
as part of their monthly reporting.  
268.  An important aspect of reporting is the ability to have each IA linked to the PGT through a 
dropbox cloud-based reporting system that will be installed by the SRIWSM IT contractor. The 
cloud-based systems will be used in conjunction with the mobile phone data collection system to 
provide feedback and sharing of data and reports information. 
D.

Stakeholder Communication Strategy  
Consultation and Participation  
269.  The project design process has adopted the principles of devolution policy of government 
with the proposed IA being Provincial PAFO’s while the ownership of most infrastructure will be 
water users as represented by their Water User Associations. For output 1 relating to commercial 
market linkages and agriculture, the design process is to be engaged widely with local farmers, 
buyers and logistics stakeholders, producer groups and local and provincial officials. Wider sector 
actors  are  in  the:  livestock  sector  (including  Viet  Nam  buyers),  safe  vegetable  production 
(including Viet Nam traders and buyers), Phounsay Mountain tea including Chinese buyers, green 
tea market chain actors and processors, service providers to producers, industry and marketing, 
and  large  commercial  enterprises  from  Thailand  and  People’s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  on 
contract farming opportunities on fresh Soybean markets inPRC. 
270.  For  output  2,  Catchment  watershed  ecological  services  protected  consultations  were 
conducted throughout the design process with DALAM and DOF both nationally and provincially, 
other  donor  supported  land  use  planning  and  forestry  programs,  provincial  land  use  planning 
personnel, and communities living within the representative catchment. At the community level, 
detailed consultations were done on the objectives of the output and the role of the community in 
the project land use change programs. 
271.  For output 3, the PRI infrastructure support has been defined within the provisions of the 
Irrigation  Law  with  the  Provincial  responsibility  for  all  the  Project  schemes.  The  design  has 
initiated a revised detailed design process through the Irrigation Section of PAFO. The process is 
defined in detailed and requires the irrigation section to first identify water users water demand 
and  water  demand  requirements  that  enable  them  to  produce  HVC  during  the  dry  season. 
Extensive consultation with water  users  and  market  agribusiness  is  required for  each WUG to 
identify  potential  cropping systems. Once the  water  use and demand is  identified  and agreed, 
water users and the design engineers are required to (i) meet formally with WUG members to 
identify issues in and around their command areas, (ii) conduct full command and infrastructure 
walk through with water users – not just WUG leaders – to assess existing infrastructure condition, 
to identify water users needs and preferences including alignments, mitigation of reduced access 
such  as  piped sections or  bridges etc., (iii)  a  preliminary  design is  produced and  the  irrigation 
104 
designers are required to hold both village and water user meetings to present the design and 
obtain support from water user groups prior  to completing the final detailed design. During the 
village level meetings, other PRI requirements will be identified. 
272.  Output  4  consultation  programs  have  been  conducted  with  the  Government  NGO  and 
Donor  led  nutrition teams  and  project from  the  central,  provincial  and district  levels.  Additional 
consultation has been held with wider actors and recently implemented programs. 
273.  Wider consultations were conducted through the engagement of the social impact survey 
teams that completed both consultation at administrative and village levels, household surveys 
and  focus  groups  for  water  user  groups,  male  and  female  water  users,  and  ethnic  group 
consultations.  
274.  The  social  safeguards  consultation  provisions  have  all  been  applied  during  the  design 
process and have been modified and strengthened in the REGDF for implementation. Here, the 
real  focus  is  on  (i)  identification  of  affected  households  and  their  need  to  complete  household 
surveys and the DMS, and (ii) close consultation process with the set of households considered 
adversely impacted to identify the range of potential options available and how the project can 
ensure that these are delivered. All these processes are included in the REGDF.  
275.  The  above  consultation  processes  are  required  for  the  implementation  of  the  project 
including the preparation and implementation of the additional subprojects.  
i. 
Awareness  
276.  Project information and awareness will be supported through the project start up among 
all  provincial  stakeholders  with  the  Project  Start-up  consultant  (refer  Annex  13  for  terms  of 
reference)  and  the  loan  implementation  consultants  working  with  each  IA  and  the  wider 
stakeholders to conduct briefing and awareness meetings for the project.  
277  At the beneficiary level, public information will be conveyed through public meetings in a 
range  of languages  to meet the  requirements  of  local  communities.  For  output  1, there  will  be 
consultative meetings and forums that link commercial buyers and suppliers to producers along 
with proposed investment into digital phone or tablet-based market awareness sharing platforms. 
278.  Output  2  includes  a  predefined  awareness  and  engagement  process  in  the  existing 
requirements for land use planning that will be applied, and then through a program of community 
land  use  agreements  and  community  participation  in  the  land  use  change  implementation 
programs.  
279.  Output  3  includes  awareness  and  consultation  to  be  developed  through  the  irrigation 
section heads working with district and village level staff to present data on the availability of water 
and  dry  seasons  irrigable  areas,  and  the  proposed  use  of  this  water  as  a  means  of  getting 
informed participation (section 1 above). 
280.  Output  4  provides  support  to  the  government’s  nutrition  policy  and  works  through  the 
provincial  and  district  level  committees  and  officials,  and  then  use  the  piloted  engagement 
programs in each target village.

XIV.  ANTICORRUPTION POLICY 
281.  ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any violations of the 
Anticorruption  Policy  relating  to  the  project.17  All  contracts  financed  by  ADB  shall  include 
provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the 
executing agency and all project contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers. 
Individuals and/or entities on ADB’s anticorruption debarment list are ineligible to participate in 
ADB-financed activity and may not be awarded any contracts under the project.18  
282.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  are  included  in  the  loan  and  grant 
agreements, and the bidding documents for the project. To address governance, integrity, and 
corruption  risks,  DOI  will  provide  a  governance  and  oversight  function  to  ensure  integrity  of 
systems, procedures and decision making. These will be supported by a cloud-based information 
and accounting system that will be accessed by MOF, MAF and the financiers, and will be within 
the control of the project. Conflict of interest clauses to minimize collusion associated with contract 
awards are included in all procurement procedures and proposed contracts.  
XV.  ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISM 
283.  People who  are,  or may  in the future  be,  adversely  affected  by the  project  may  submit 
complaints  to  ADB’s  Accountability  Mechanism.  The  Accountability  Mechanism  provides  an 
independent forum and process whereby people adversely affected by ADB-assisted projects can 
voice,  and  seek  a  resolution  of  their  problems,  as  well  as  report  alleged  violations  of  ADB’s 
operational  policies  and  procedures.  Before  submitting  a  complaint  to  the  Accountability 
Mechanism, affected people should make an effort in good faith to solve their problems by working 
with  the  concerned  ADB  operations  department.    Only  after  doing  that,  and  if  they  are  still 
dissatisfied, should they approach the Accountability Mechanism.19 
XVI.  RECORD OF CHANGES TO THE PROJECT ADMINISTRATION MANUAL 
284.  All revisions and/or updates during the course of implementation should be retained in this 
section to provide a chronological history of changes to implemented arrangements recorded in 
the PAM, including revision to contract awards and disbursement s-curves.

Sustainable Rural Infrastructure and Watershed Management Sector Project (RRP LAO 50236) 
ANNEX 2: TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR LOAN IMPLEMENTATION CONSULTANT 
A. 
Introduction  
The  Government  of  Lao  PDR  has  recognized  the  importance  of  productive  rural 
1. 
infrastructure (PRI) in driving rural growth and has invested heavily in it over the past 30 years. 
Irrigation  investment  has  until  now  targeted  food  security  policy  objectives  mostly  through  the 
production  of  wet  season  rice.  Lao  PDR  is  currently  self-sufficient  in  rice  and  as  such  the 
Sustainable Rural Infrastructure and Watershed Management Sector Project (SRIWSM) will direct 
irrigation investment into economic growth policy objectives with a focus on dry season irrigated 
agriculture. An integral part of this move is the integration of nutrition sensitive agriculture and 
nutrition improvement by diversifying food sources. 
2. 
The  project  will  modernize  at  least  18  irrigation  schemes  to  secure  reliable  dry  season 
irrigation for water users that is both reliable in terms of quantity, time of delivery and place of 
delivery.  The  project  seeks  to  offset  risks  to  producers  from  high  value  crop  markets  and  the 
destruction  of  upstream  catchments.  Smallholders  who  to  date  have  grown  a  wet  season  rice 
crop will be able to grow and market high value crops and livestock farming systems.  
The  SRIWSM  will  achieve  its  outcome  of  sustainable  market-oriented  agriculture 
3. 
production and natural resources management in selected watersheds with improved community 
nutrition by bringing approximately 3,600 hectares of land under dry season irrigation, producing 
and marketing over 30,000 tons of high value crops and improving the number  of women who 
meet minimum dietary diversity in target communities by 50%. It will do this through four outputs: 
4. 
Output  1:  Market-oriented  agricultural  production  increased.  The  output  involves 
identifying  markets  and  connecting  producers  to  these  markets,  providing  support  for  value 
addition  along  the  market  chain.  Technical  support  will  be  provided  for  development  of  the 
agribusiness  capacity  for  market  assessments,  market-led  farm  planning  and  facilitating 
investment into post-harvest value addition, improved logistics for market connectivity, and quality 
assurance and traceability systems that respond to trade requirements.  A loan implementation 
consultant (LIC) situated within the Department of Irrigation (DOI) will support the establishment 
and institutionalization of agribusiness capacity within each PAFO supporting the development of 
market-led commercial agriculture including irrigated dry season high value crops and livestock. 
A provincial LIC will be situated within the provincial agriculture and forestry office (PAFO) in each 
province to support the provincial project implementation team (PPIT).  
5. 
Output 2: Watershed ecological services protected. The project will support the update 
or  development  of  participatory  land  use  plans  for  villages  within  the  catchments  of  PRI 
infrastructure. The project will support land use behavior change programs to protect the soil and 
water  based  ecological  services  and  embed  these  changes  within  negotiated  community 
agreements.    Each  LIC  PAFO  will  support  this  process  through  the  provision  of  a  land  use 
management and land use change advisor to support the Provincial Land Use Planning teams. 
Further  technical  support  will  be  mobilized  to  support  the  technical  requirements  of  behavior 
change programs.  
6. 
Output 3: Command area irrigation reliability improved. This output supports irrigation 
infrastructure modernization for dry season irrigated agriculture and other infrastructure to support 
community  wellbeing.  A  key  element  of  the  investment  is  the  capacity  of  local  water  users  to 
operate a managed water delivery systems during the dry season. The LIC DOI will support the 
establishment  of  water  user  groups  and  the  members  to  develop  knowledge,  skills  and 
2 
information systems to operate dry season irrigation reliably whilst also maintaining their irrigation 
assets.  
7. 
Output 4: Nutrition awareness and facilities improved. This output will be undertaken 
in  Xiangkhouang  and  Houaphan  provinces.  The  project  will  upscale  existing  pilot  programs  in 
approximately  20  nutrition-priority  villages in  each of the  6  districts. The scale-up methods  will 
include nutrition clubs, providing social behavior change communication programs and nutrition 
training,  and  supporting  club  and  individual  development  plans  designed  to  increase  the 
production and year-round consumption of diverse and nutritious foods. This output will not be 
within the scope of the LIC technical consultants and will be single sourced to an existing service 
provider in the two provinces included.  
SRIWSM is the first ADB irrigation subsector project to use decentralized implementation. 
8. 
The  role  of  DOI  is  to  establish  common  systems  and  to  manage  governance  risks  within  the 
Provincial  implementation  agencies.  Risks  associated  with  procurement,  delays,  decentralized 
financial management, and safeguard requirements will be subject to oversight from a Program 
Governance Team in DOI. The LIC DOI will support the Program Governance Team in overall 
project planning and coordination, project management and reporting, financial and procurement 
support, monitoring and safeguard reporting.  
Within each province, the project will be implemented through the structure of the PAFO. 
9. 
Here  the  LIC  DOI  will  support  the  PAFO  implementation  teams  through  the  provision  of  skills 
relating to Project management coordination, safeguards and technical expertise relating to dry 
season irrigated agriculture and high value crops with each Province having a project team leader 
that reports to and support the DG PAFO.   
10. 
The SRIWSM will be implemented over a period of seven years. The Ministry of Agriculture 
and Forestry (MAF) will be the executing agency and implementation will be through the PAFOs, 
in collaboration with other provincial and district level offices. 
B. 
Consulting Services 
1. 
Loan Implementation consultants  
11. 
Each  IA  will  contract  a  loan  implementation  consultant:  packages  OP5-CS01,  OP5-
CS02,  OP5-CS03,  OP5-CS04,  and  OP5-CS05  for  DoI  in  Vientiane,  Louangphabang  PAFO, 
Xiangkhouang  PAFO,  Houaphan  PAFO  and  Xaignabouli  PAFO,  respectively.  Each  will  be 
recruited as a company using QCBS and simplified technical proposal. 
12. 
The LIC teams will in effect continue the program of support provided by the project start-
up consultants – international Project Management, and national procurement specialists. Both 
start up consultants will be eligible for roles in the DOI loan implementation consultant team should 
the  respective  bidders  (firm)  and  the  individual  agree  on  terms.  This  eligibility  is  included  to 
encourage continuity that will reduce the risks of delays during the handover during the LIC DOI 
mobilization.   
II. 
DOI PGT LOAN IMPLEMENTATION CONSULTANT (LIC) PACKAGE OP5-CS01 
The following TOR is for the Department of Irrigation Loan Implementation Consultant that 
13. 
will work with the Program Governance Team (PGT): procurement package OP5-CS01. 
3 
The contractor will be recruited as a company using ADB’s CMS and QCBS procedures 
14. 
using a simplified technical proposal (STP) due to the range of expertise being contracted (mostly 
project management and governance support) reflecting the changes to Project Governance and 
administration,  and  for  technical  innovation  in  terms  of  dry  season  irrigation,  commercial 
agribusiness  and  market  led  high  value  crop  systems  necessitates  quality  technical  inputs  to 
ensure project effectiveness and sustainability. The team will be based in DoI however it will also 
support  each  of  the  Provincial  IA  with  project  management  governance  systems  by  working 
through the PGT in DoI.  
15. 
The LIC DoI team will comprise of 16 positions that provide a total of 272 person months 
of input of which 83 person months are International and 189 person months of national specialist 
input. The overriding role of the LIC DOI team is to ensure the technical roles of the PGT are of 
an  international  standard  in  terms  of  project  management,  project  administration,  and  project 
governance and compliance. The majority of the inputs will be to develop and ensure PGT has 
technical systems and standards required to support a decentralized implementation through the 
PAFOs.  Some  technical  support  will  be  required  for  the  PAFOs,  however,  it  is  envisaged  that 
most of this needs to be delivered by the PGT of DoI with mentored support and oversight from 
the LIC DOI. A key function and requirement of the LIC DOI is to ensure that each of the respective 
functions in the PGT responsibility and mandate is able to support provinces and new programs 
in the future. Both technical systems and capacity needs to be in place to ensure this.  
16. 
The  most  significant  variation  on  this  is  the  inclusion  of  the  two  Agri-Market  Linkage 
experts. These roles will work mostly in the provinces but need to be based in Vientiane to connect 
with buyers and the wider commercial operators in the agricultural sector.  
17. 
The  team  will  be  led  by  an  experienced  program  manager  as  opposed  to  a  technical 
engineer.  Under  the  implementation  arrangement  for  SRIWSM  the  DoI  focus  is  on  program 
governance  and  transparency  and  to  ensure  compliance  with  both  donor  and  government 
requirements. A detailed breakdown of the positions and the level of effort by year is included in 
Table  1,  followed  by  the  individual  terms  of  reference  which  detailed  experience  and 
qualifications, expected outputs and tasks each position is responsible for.

ANNEX 2.1: TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR LOUANGPHABANG PAFO LOAN 
IMPLEMENTATION CONSULTANT 
A. 
Introduction  
1. 
The  Government  of  Lao  PDR  has  recognized  the  importance  of  productive  rural 
infrastructure (PRI) in driving rural growth and has invested heavily in it over the past 30 years. 
Irrigation  investment  has  until  now  targeted  food  security  policy  objectives  mostly  through  the 
production  of  wet  season  rice.  Lao  PDR  is  currently  self-sufficient  in  rice  and  as  such  the 
Sustainable Rural Infrastructure and Watershed Management Sector Project (SRIWSM) will direct 
irrigation investment into economic growth policy objectives with a focus on dry season irrigated 
agriculture. An integral part of this move is the integration of nutrition sensitive agriculture and 
nutrition improvement by diversifying food sources. 
2. 
The  project  will  modernize  at  least  18  irrigation  schemes  to  secure  reliable  dry  season 
irrigation for water users that is both reliable in terms of quantity, time of delivery and place of 
delivery.  The  project  seeks  to  offset  risks  to  producers  from  high  value  crop  markets  and  the 
destruction  of  upstream  catchments.  Smallholders  who  to  date  have  grown  a  wet  season  rice 
crop will be able to grow and market high value crops and livestock farming systems.  
The  SRIWSM  will  achieve  its  outcome  of  high-value  agricultural  production,  natural 
3. 
resources  management,  status  of  women,  and  community  nutrition  improved  by  bringing 
approximately 3,600 hectares of land under dry season irrigation, producing and marketing over 
30,000 tons of high value crops and improving the number of women who meet minimum dietary 
diversity in target communities by 50%. It will do this through four outputs: 
4. 
Output  1:  Market-oriented  agricultural  production  increased.  The  output  involves 
identifying  markets  and  connecting  producers  to  these  markets,  providing  support  for  value 
addition  along  the  market  chain.  Technical  support  will  be  provided  for  development  of  the 
agribusiness  capacity  for  market  assessments,  market-led  farm  planning  and  facilitating 
investment into post-harvest value addition, improved logistics for market connectivity, and quality 
assurance and traceability systems that respond to trade requirements.  A loan implementation 
consultant (LIC) situated within the Department of Irrigation (DOI) will support the establishment 
and institutionalization of agribusiness capacity within each PAFO supporting the development of 
market-led commercial agriculture including irrigated dry season high value crops and livestock. 
A provincial LIC will be situated within the provincial agriculture and forestry office (PAFO) in each 
province to support the provincial project implementation team (PPIT). 
5. 
Output 2: Watershed ecological services protected. The project will support the update 
or  development  of  participatory  land  use  plans  for  villages  within  the  catchments  of  PRI 
infrastructure. The project will support land use behavior change programs to protect the soil and 
water  based  ecological  services  and  embed  these  changes  within  negotiated  community 
agreements.    Each  LIC  PAFO  will  support  this  process  through  the  provision  of  a  land  use 
management and land use change advisor to support the Provincial Land Use Planning teams. 
Further  technical  support  will  be  mobilized  to  support  the  technical  requirements  of  behavior 
change programs.  
6. 
Output 3: Command area irrigation reliability improved. This output supports irrigation 
infrastructure modernization for dry season irrigated agriculture and other infrastructure to support 
community  wellbeing.  A  key  element  of  the  investment  is  the  capacity  of  local  water  users  to 
operate a managed water delivery systems during the dry season. The LIC DOI will support the 
2 
establishment  of  water  user  groups  and  the  members  to  develop  knowledge,  skills  and 
information systems to operate dry season irrigation reliably whilst also maintaining their irrigation 
assets.  
Output 4: Nutrition awareness and facilities improved. This output will be undertaken 
7. 
in  Xiangkhouang  and  Houaphan  provinces.  The  project  will  upscale  existing  pilot  programs  in 
approximately  20  nutrition-priority  villages in  each of the  6  districts. The scale-up methods  will 
include nutrition clubs, providing social behavior change communication programs and nutrition 
training,  and  supporting  club  and  individual  development  plans  designed  to  increase  the 
production and year-round consumption of diverse and nutritious foods. This output will not be 
within the scope of the LIC technical consultants and will be single sourced to an existing service 
provider in the two provinces included.  
8. 
SRIWSM is the first ADB irrigation subsector project to use decentralized implementation. 
The  role  of  DOI  is  to  establish  common  systems  and  to  manage  governance  risks  within  the 
Provincial  implementation  agencies.  Risks  associated  with  procurement,  delays,  decentralized 
financial management, and safeguard requirements will be subject to oversight from a Program 
Governance Team in DOI. The LIC will support the Program Governance Team in overall project 
planning  and  coordination,  project  management  and  reporting,  financial  and  procurement 
support, monitoring and safeguard reporting.  
9. 
Within each province the project will be implemented through the structure of the PAFO. 
Here  the  LIC  DOI  will  support  the  PAFO  implementation  teams  through  the  provision  of  skills 
relating to Project management coordination, safeguards and technical expertise relating to dry 
season irrigated agriculture and high value crops with each Province having a project team leader 
that reports to and support the DG PAFO.   
10. 
The SRIWSM will be implemented over a period of seven years. The Ministry of Agriculture 
and Forestry (MAF) will be the executing agency and implementation will be through the PAFOs, 
in collaboration with other provincial and district level offices.

Xiangkhouang  PAFO,  Houaphan  PAFO  and  Xaignabouli  PAFO  respectively.  Each  will  be 
recruited as a company using QCBS and simplified technical proposal. 
The LIC teams will in effect continue the program of support provided by the Project Start-
12. 
Up consultants – International Project Management, and National Procurement specialists. Both 
start up consultants will  be eligible for roles in the DOI Loan Implementation Consultant Team 
should the respective bidders (firm) and the individual agree on terms. This eligibility is included 
to encourage continuity that will reduce the risks of delays during the handover during the LIC 
DOI mobilization.

Sustainable Rural Infrastructure and Watershed Management Sector Project (RRP LAO 50236) 
ANNEX 2.2: TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR XIANGKHOUANG  PAFO LOAN 
IMPLEMENTATION CONSULTANT 
A. 
Introduction  
1. 
The  Government  of  Lao  PDR  has  recognized  the  importance  of  productive  rural 
infrastructure (PRI) in driving rural growth and has invested heavily in it over the past 30 years. 
Irrigation  investment  has  until  now  targeted  food  security  policy  objectives  mostly  through  the 
production  of  wet  season  rice.  Lao  PDR  is  currently  self-sufficient  in  rice  and  as  such  the 
Sustainable Rural Infrastructure and Watershed Management Sector Project (SRIWSM) will direct 
irrigation investment into economic growth policy objectives with a focus on dry season irrigated 
agriculture.  An  integral  part  of  this move is  the  integration  of  nutrition  sensitive agriculture  and 
nutrition improvement by diversifying food sources. 
2. 
The  project  will  modernize  at  least  18  irrigation  schemes  to  secure  reliable  dry  season 
irrigation for  water  users  that  is  both  reliable  in terms  of quantity,  time of  delivery  and place  of 
delivery.  The  project  seeks  to  offset  risks  to  producers  from  high  value  crop  markets  and  the 
destruction of upstream catchments. Smallholders who to date have grown a wet season rice crop 
will be able to grow and market high value crops and livestock farming systems.  
The  SRIWSM  will  achieve  its  outcome  of  high-value  agricultural  production,  natural 
3. 
resources  management,  status  of  women,  and  community  nutrition  improved  by  bringing 
approximately 3,600 hectares of land under dry season irrigation, producing and marketing over 
30,000 tons of high value crops and improving the number of women who meet minimum dietary 
diversity in target communities by 50%. It will do this through four outputs: 
4. 
Output  1:  Market-oriented  agricultural  production  increased.  The  output  involves 
identifying  markets  and  connecting  producers  to  these  markets,  providing  support  for  value 
addition  along  the  market  chain.  Technical  support  will  be  provided  for  development  of  the 
agribusiness  capacity  for  market  assessments,  market-led  farm  planning  and  facilitating 
investment into post-harvest value addition, improved logistics for market connectivity, and quality 
assurance and  traceability  systems that respond  to trade requirements.  A  loan  implementation 
consultant (LIC) situated within the Department of Irrigation (DOI) will support the establishment 
and institutionalization of agribusiness capacity within each PAFO supporting the development of 
market-led commercial agriculture including irrigated dry season high value crops and livestock. 
A provincial LIC will be situated within the provincial agriculture and forestry office (PAFO) in each 
province to support the provincial project implementation team (PPIT). 
5. 
Output 2: Watershed ecological services protected. The project will support the update 
or  development  of  participatory  land  use  plans  for  villages  within  the  catchments  of  PRI 
infrastructure. The project will support land use behavior change programs to protect the soil and 
water  based  ecological  services  and  embed  these  changes  within  negotiated  community 
agreements.  The LIC will support this process through the provision of a land use management 
and land use change advisor to support the Provincial Land Use Planning teams. Further technical 
support will be mobilized to support the technical requirements of behavior change programs.  
6. 
Output 3: Command area irrigation reliability improved. This output supports irrigation 
infrastructure modernization for dry season irrigated agriculture and other infrastructure to support 
community  wellbeing.  A  key  element  of  the  investment  is  the  capacity  of  local  water  users  to 
operate a managed water delivery systems during the dry season. The LIC DOI will support the 
2 
establishment of water user groups and the members to develop knowledge, skills and information 
systems to operate dry season irrigation reliably whilst also maintaining their irrigation assets.  
7. 
Output 4: Nutrition awareness and facilities improved. This output will be undertaken 
in  Xiangkhouang  and  Houaphan  provinces.  The  project  will  upscale  existing  pilot  programs  in 
approximately  20  nutrition-priority  villages  in  each  of  the  6  districts.  The  scale-up  methods  will 
Include nutrition clubs, providing social behavior change communication programs and nutrition 
training,  and  supporting  club  and  individual  development  plans  designed  to  increase  the

The  role  of  DOI  is  to  establish  common  systems  and  to  manage  governance  risks  within  the 
Provincial  implementation  agencies.  Risks  associated  with  procurement,  delays,  decentralized 
financial management, and safeguard requirements will be subject to oversight from a Program 
Governance Team in DOI. The LIC  DOI will support the Program Governance Team in overall 
project planning and coordination, project management and reporting, financial and procurement 
support, monitoring and safeguard reporting.  
Within each province the project will be implemented through the structure of the PAFO.

Here  the  LIC  DOI  will  support  the  PAFO  implementation  teams  through  the  provision  of  skills 
relating to Project management coordination, safeguards and technical expertise relating to dry 
season irrigated agriculture and high value crops with each Province having a project team leader 
that reports to and support the DG PAFO.   
10. 
The SRIWSM will be implemented over a period of seven years. The Ministry of Agriculture 
and Forestry (MAF) will be the executing agency and implementation will be through the PAFOs, 
in collaboration with other provincial and district level offices.

Sustainable Rural Infrastructure and Watershed Management Sector Project (RRP LAO 50236) 
ANNEX 2.3: TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR HOUAPHAN PAFO LOAN IMPLEMENTATION 
CONSULTANT 
A. 
Introduction  
1. 
The  Government  of  Lao  PDR  has  recognized  the  importance  of  productive  rural 
infrastructure (PRI) in driving rural growth and has invested heavily in it over the past 30 years. 
Irrigation  investment  has  until  now  targeted  food  security  policy  objectives  mostly  through  the 
production  of  wet  season  rice.  Lao  PDR  is  currently  self-sufficient  in  rice  and  as  such  the 
Sustainable Rural Infrastructure and Watershed Management Sector Project (SRIWSM) will direct 
irrigation investment into economic growth policy objectives with a focus on dry season irrigated 
agriculture.  An  integral  part  of  this move is  the  integration  of  nutrition  sensitive agriculture  and 
nutrition improvement by diversifying food sources. 
2. 
The  project  will  modernize  at  least  18  irrigation  schemes  to  secure  reliable  dry  season 
irrigation for  water  users  that  is  both  reliable  in terms  of quantity,  time of  delivery  and place  of 
delivery.  The  project  seeks  to  offset  risks  to  producers  from  high  value  crop  markets  and  the 
destruction of upstream catchments. Smallholders who to date have grown a wet season rice crop 
will be able to grow and market high value crops and livestock farming systems.  
The  SRIWSM  will  achieve  its  outcome  of  high-value  agricultural  production,  natural 
3. 
resources  management,  status  of  women,  and  community  nutrition  improved  by  bringing 
approximately 3,600 hectares of land under dry season irrigation, producing and marketing over 
30,000 tons of high value crops and improving the number of women who meet minimum dietary 
diversity in target communities by 50%. It will do this through four outputs: 
4. 
Output  1:  Market-oriented  agricultural  production  increased.  The  output  involves 
identifying  markets  and  connecting  producers  to  these  markets,  providing  support  for  value 
addition  along  the  market  chain.  Technical  support  will  be  provided  for  development  of  the 
agribusiness  capacity  for  market  assessments,  market-led  farm  planning  and  facilitating 
investment into post-harvest value addition, improved logistics for market connectivity, and quality 
assurance and  traceability  systems that respond  to trade requirements.  A  loan  implementation 
consultant (LIC) situated within the Department of Irrigation (DOI) will support the establishment 
and institutionalization of agribusiness capacity within each PAFO supporting the development of 
market-led commercial agriculture including irrigated dry season high value crops and livestock. 
A provincial LIC will be situated within the provincial agriculture and forestry office (PAFO) in each 
province to support the provincial project implementation team (PPIT). 
5. 
Output 2: Watershed ecological services protected. The project will support the update 
or  development  of  participatory  land  use  plans  for  villages  within  the  catchments  of  PRI 
infrastructure. The project will support land use behavior change programs to protect the soil and 
water  based  ecological  services  and  embed  these  changes  within  negotiated  community 
agreements.  LIC will support this process through the provision of a land use management and 
land use change advisor to support the Provincial Land Use Planning teams. Further technical 
support will be mobilized to support the technical requirements of behavior change programs.  
6. 
Output 3: Command area irrigation reliability increased. This output supports irrigation 
infrastructure modernization for dry season irrigated agriculture and other infrastructure to support 
community  wellbeing.  A  key  element  of  the  investment  is  the  capacity  of  local  water  users  to 
operate a managed water delivery systems during the dry season. The LIC DOI will support the 
2 
establishment of water user groups and the members to develop knowledge, skills and information 
systems to operate dry season irrigation reliably whilst also maintaining their irrigation assets.  
7. 
Output 4: Nutrition awareness and facilities improved. This output will be undertaken 
in  Xiangkhouang  and  Houaphan  provinces.  The  project  will  upscale  existing  pilot  programs  in 
approximately 20 nutrition-priority villages in each of the six districts. The scale-up methods will 
include nutrition clubs, providing social behavior change communication programs and nutrition 
training,  and  supporting  club  and  individual  development  plans  designed  to  increase  the 
production  and  year-round  consumption  of diverse  and  nutritious foods. This  output  will  not  be 
within the scope of the LIC technical consultants and will be single sourced to an existing service 
provider in the two provinces included.  
SRIWSM is the first ADB irrigation subsector project to use decentralized implementation. 
8. 
The  role  of  DOI  is  to  establish  common  systems  and  to  manage  governance  risks  within  the 
Provincial  implementation  agencies.  Risks  associated  with  procurement,  delays,  decentralized 
financial management, and safeguard requirements will be subject to oversight from a Program 
Governance Team in DOI. The LIC  DOI will support the Program Governance Team in overall 
project planning and coordination, project management and reporting, financial and procurement 
support, monitoring and safeguard reporting.  
Within each province the project will be implemented through the structure of the PAFO. 
9. 
Here  the  LIC  DOI  will  support  the  PAFO  implementation  teams  through  the  provision  of  skills 
relating to Project management coordination, safeguards and technical expertise relating to dry 
season irrigated agriculture and high value crops with each Province having a project team leader 
that reports to and support the DG PAFO.   
10. 
The SRIWSM will be implemented over a period of seven years. The Ministry of Agriculture 
and Forestry (MAF) will be the executing agency and implementation will be through the PAFOs, 
in collaboration with other provincial and district level offices.

Sustainable Rural Infrastructure and Watershed Management Sector Project (RRP LAO 50236) 
ANNEX 2.4: TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR XAIGNABOULI PAFO LOAN IMPLEMENTATION 
CONSULTANT 
A. 
Introduction  
1. 
The  Government  of  Lao  PDR  has  recognized  the  importance  of  productive  rural 
infrastructure (PRI) in driving rural growth and has invested heavily in it over the past 30 years. 
Irrigation  investment  has  until  now  targeted  food  security  policy  objectives  mostly  through  the 
production  of  wet  season  rice.  Lao  PDR  is  currently  self-sufficient  in  rice  and  as  such  the 
Sustainable Rural Infrastructure and Watershed Management Sector Project (SRIWSM) will direct 
irrigation investment into economic growth policy objectives with a focus on dry season irrigated 
agriculture.  An  integral  part  of  this move is  the  integration  of  nutrition  sensitive agriculture  and 
nutrition improvement by diversifying food sources. 
2. 
The  project  will  modernize  at  least  18  irrigation  schemes  to  secure  reliable  dry  season 
irrigation for  water  users  that  is  both  reliable  in terms  of quantity,  time of  delivery  and place  of 
delivery.  The  project  seeks  to  offset  risks  to  producers  from  high  value  crop  markets  and  the 
destruction of upstream catchments. Smallholders who to date have grown a wet season rice crop 
will be able to grow and market high value crops and livestock farming systems.  
The  SRIWSM  will  achieve  its  outcome  of  high-value  agricultural  production,  natural 
3. 
resources  management,  status  of  women,  and  community  nutrition  improved  by  bringing 
approximately 3,600 hectares of land under dry season irrigation, producing and marketing over 
30,000 tons of high value crops and improving the number of women who meet minimum dietary 
diversity in target communities by 50%. It will do this through four outputs: 
4. 
Output  1:  Market-oriented  agricultural  production  increased.  The  output  involves 
identifying  markets  and  connecting  producers  to  these  markets,  providing  support  for  value 
addition  along  the  market  chain.  Technical  support  will  be  provided  for  development  of  the 
agribusiness  capacity  for  market  assessments,  market-led  farm  planning  and  facilitating 
investment into post-harvest value addition, improved logistics for market connectivity, and quality 
assurance and traceability systems that respond to trade requirements. A Loan Implementation 
Consultant (LIC) situated within the Department of Irrigation (DOI) will support the establishment 
and institutionalization of agribusiness capacity within each PAFO supporting the development of 
market-led commercial agriculture including irrigated dry season high value crops and livestock. 
A provincial LIC will be situated within the provincial agriculture and forestry office (PAFO) in each 
province to support the provincial project implementation team (PPIT). 
5. 
Output 2: Watershed ecological services protected. The project will support the update 
or  development  of  participatory  land  use  plans  for  villages  within  the  catchments  of  PRI 
infrastructure. The project will support land use behavior change programs to protect the soil and 
water  based  ecological  services  and  embed  these  changes  within  negotiated  community 
agreements.  LIC DOI will support this process through the provision of a land use management 
and land use change advisor to support the provincial land use planning teams. Further technical 
support will be mobilized to support the technical requirements of behavior change programs.  
6. 
Output 3: Command area irrigation reliability increased. This output supports irrigation 
infrastructure modernization for dry season irrigated agriculture and other infrastructure to support 
community  wellbeing.  A  key  element  of  the  investment  is  the  capacity  of  local  water  users  to 
operate a managed water delivery systems during the dry season. The LIC DOI will support the 
2 
establishment of water user groups and the members to develop knowledge, skills and information 
systems to operate dry season irrigation reliably whilst also maintaining their irrigation assets.  
7. 
Output 4: Nutrition awareness and facilities improved. This output will be undertaken 
in  Xiangkhouang  and  Houaphan  provinces.  The  project  will  upscale  existing  pilot  programs  in 
approximately 20 nutrition-priority villages in each of the six districts. The scale-up methods will 
include nutrition clubs, providing social behavior change communication programs and nutrition 
training,  and  supporting  club  and  individual  development  plans  designed  to  increase  the 
production  and  year-round  consumption  of diverse  and  nutritious foods. This  output  will  not  be 
within the scope of the LIC technical consultants and will be single sourced to an existing service 
provider in the two provinces included.  
SRIWSM is the first ADB irrigation subsector project to use decentralized implementation. 
8. 
The  role  of  DOI  is  to  establish  common  systems  and  to  manage  governance  risks  within  the 
provincial  implementation  agencies.  Risks  associated  with  procurement,  delays,  decentralized 
financial management, and safeguard requirements will be subject to oversight from a Program 
Governance Team in DOI. The LIC  DOI will support the Program Governance Team in overall 
project planning and coordination, project management and reporting, financial and procurement 
support, monitoring and safeguard reporting.  
Within each province the project will be implemented through the structure of the PAFO. 
9. 
Here  the  LIC  DOI  will  support  the  PAFO  implementation  teams  through  the  provision  of  skills 
relating to Project management coordination, safeguards and technical expertise relating to dry 
season irrigated agriculture and high value crops with each province having a project team leader 
that reports to and support the DG PAFO.   
10. 
The SRIWSM will be implemented over a period of seven years. The Ministry of Agriculture 
and Forestry (MAF) will be the executing agency and implementation will be through the PAFOs, 
in collaboration with other provincial and district level offices.

ANNEX 3:   TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR DETAILED ENGINEERING DESIGN 
A. 
Irrigation Scheme Physical Survey and Design 
The  DOI  with  support from  ADB  is  preparing the Sustainable Rural  Infrastructure  and 
1. 
Watershed  Management  Project.  The  Project  sites  for  this  project  will  be  the  watershed  of 
approved  irrigation  schemes.  The  attached  terms  of  reference  is  for  the  development  of  a 
preliminary  design,  bill  of  quantity  and  cost  estimate  for  the  modernisation  of  subproject 
(**************) to be completed by PAFO – irrigation section of ********* province. 
B. 
Approach  
Farmer participation and involvement at all stages of the survey and design activities is 
2. 
required with the modernisation of the above irrigation scheme. Consultation with the village and 
WUG leaders on the scheme history, past performance and past or ongoing issues will be the 
basis on which the design will be assessed. At all stages of the design the involvement of WUG 
member farmers will ensure that their needs i.e., demand for water will first inform and then dictate 
the design choices with respect to supply canals, crossings and water control systems. This input 
is both necessary and mandatory if the design is to be accepted by the LIC and PGT consultants 
as such evidence of this involvement will be required. 
3. 
Agreement between the WUG / WUA and the Project is to be signed at the completion 
of  the  design  and  is  to  form  part  of  the  overall  Scheme  Agreement  with  the  WUA  for  the 
modernisation, on-ongoing development, protection and maintenance of their irrigation scheme 
and watershed on which it is reliant.

for 
environmental and in-stream value uses. The water availability throughout the year 
should be assessed on a monthly basis and a minimum environmental flow of 10% 
the average monthly flow is to be assumed within the design process.  
For  the  flood  levels  and  flows,  the  max  water  levels,  flooded  areas  and  flow 
pathways as observed by the farmers at the headworks (or other accessible site) 
should be noted. Special attention should be made of where water which overtops 
or passes around the headworks during high floods re-enter the main channel. The 
peak  flows  on  site  should  be  evaluated  using  the  slope/area  method  once  the 
topographic  survey  of  the  headworks  site  (or  at  the  other  accessible  site)  have 
been completed. 
For all subprojects a simple staff gauge plate at the headworks or in a stable river 
section from which on-going monitoring of the water levels (and  after rating, the 
flows)  can  be  undertaken  by  the WUG  –  no  works  contracting  will  be  approved 
without the staff gauge data for at least one entire dry season being no less than 
fortnightly  records  for  the  period  from  November  to  May.  PAFO  will  provide 
instruction and training with the WUG members to monitor the staff gauge.   
PAFO  (DG)  will  submit  to  the  Provincial  Steering  Committee  for  review  each 
subproject hydrological assessment prior to initiating the design process. During 
this time PONRE will be formally required to ratify the assessment and the Vice 
Governor  will  in  his  role  of  chairperson  approve  the  movement  into  the  design 
process. 
On  completion  of  the  detailed  design,  but  prior  to  submitting  the  design  for 
approval,  the  PAFO  DG  shall  submit  to  the  provincial  steering  committee  a 
hydrological report based on forecast flow rates, measured or observed flow rates 
(defined by  staff gauge record  of  at  least fortnightly  recording) for  the  entire  dry 
season  being  no  less  than  November  to  May,  and  the  expected  water  drawoff 
assumed for the design. This report will be reviewed by PONRE and will need to 
be formally ratified by the Steering Committee prior to the detailed design report 
being submitted for review and approval. For instances where the residual flow is 
equivalent to or less than 10% of the monthly low flow no approval is to be allowed.  
E. 
Design Process and Terms of Reference  
(i) 
Pre-survey assessments to include: 
−  Collation and check of design documents for existing scheme 
−  Understanding of irrigation schemes and water use upstream and downstream 
from  existing  scheme  –  all  schemes  within  the  same  watershed  will  be 
identified and documented in terms of location, village name, command area 
and water use  
(ii) 
Surveys to include 
−  Orientation / walkthrough of existing scheme and any proposed extension area  
−  An inventory of the physical condition of existing infrastructure at the time of 
3 
the walk through 
−  Hydrological assessment 
o  Water availability for irrigation 
o  Flood levels and flows  
−  Topographic survey 
o  Existing infrastructure 
o  Command area  boundaries, wet season and dry season  
−  Existing water delivery efficiency assessment at defined points in the scheme  
main canals, secondary canals 
−  Undertake  an  orientation  /  walkthrough  survey  of  the  entire  existing 
irrigation scheme confirming on a map the location of the existing layout of all 
infrastructure (including headworks, canals, drains, crossings, structures both 
from original construction, subsequent farmer or other development) as well 
as  in  the  areas  proposed  for  extension.  Note  carefully  the  existing  field 
turnouts (structures, pipes or otherwise) and seek comment from farmers on 
their use and the need for additional outlets or adjustments. Also note on the 
maps the water flow directions (from farmer observations/ discussions) in the 
command areas 
5. 
 During  the  orientation  survey  or  subsequently,  undertake  a  rigorous  physical 
inspection  and  assessment  of  the  scheme  infrastructure  noting  (1)  dimensions  and  type  of 
materials (eg canal lining), (2) present condition (3) if failed, the reasons for failure, (4) the works 
required  to  bring  the  infrastructure  to  a  fully  operational  condition  including  options  / 
recommendations  for  ensuring  failure  will  not  reoccur  and  (5)  additional  infrastructure 
requirements  based  on  farmer  and  own  assessments  to  enhance  scheme  operation.  All 
infrastructure should be marked up clearly on maps and summarised on a spreadsheet. In parallel 
with this survey, if possible where canals are operational, the water delivery efficiency survey 
may be conducted to assess present canal flow capacities, canal leakages and areas of water 
use (see item e) below).           
Undertake a topographic survey for the (1) existing irrigation scheme infrastructure (2) 
6. 
existing command area and (3) future (proposed) command area. Permanent bench marks are 
to be established at the headworks and along the main canal at distances not exceeding 2 km. 
All levelling to be undertaken at +/- 0.01m accuracy.  
7. 
Surveys are to be presented on CAD maps and drawings at appropriate scales to clearly 
show the existing layouts, profiles and sections of the irrigation scheme and in sufficient detail 
and clarity for use in the preparation of the detailed designs.     
(i) 
The existing infrastructure includes the headworks, main canals, drains, structures 
and  associated  infrastructure  (eg  access  roads,  livestock  crossing,  super 
passages, culverts, etc).  
(a) 
For  the  headworks,  the  channel  should  be  surveyed  (dimensions  and 
levels) for a distance of 100m upstream and 100m downstream from the 
existing  weir  or  from  the  proposed  weir  alignment.  In  addition,  the  areas 
(ii) 
(iii) 
4 
subject to flooding and flood flow pathways around the headworks structure 
should also be surveyed.          
For the main canals and drains, levels are to be taken at not greater than 
50m distances, noting the top of bank levels (left and right) and bed invert 
levels.  
For control structures, invert levels are to be recorded.  
For  associated  infrastructure,  an  appropriate  no.  of  levels  should  be 
obtained to facilitate its improvement.    
(b) 
(c) 
(d) 
The  existing  command  area  includes  the  lower  order  canals  and  drains,  field 
structures  (or  sites  of  water  division,  etc,),  field  levels  and  other  associated 
infrastructure.          
(a) 
For lower order canals and drains, levels are to be taken on the top of bank 
(bund), bed invert levels and adjacent paddy field levels (both sides)    
For control structures sites, invert levels are to be recorded. 
For  associated  infrastructure,  an  appropriate  no.  of  levels  should  be 
obtained to facilitate its improvement. 
For  the  fields,  where  the  water  distribution  is  clearly  understood  by  the 
farmers,  then minimal  or  no  additional  survey  is required.  However  if the 
water distribution is not clearly understood, then levels at sufficient points 
should be taken to define the contours and slopes of the command area – 
typically where differences in relief are between 0.25 and 0.5 m.        
(b) 
(c) 
(d) 
The proposed command area includes taking levels of the fields to which water is 
to be supplied and other associated infrastructure.          
(a) 
For the fields, sufficient levels should be taken to define the contours and 
slopes of the new command area – typically where differences in relief are 
between 0.25 and 0,5 m   
For existing drains, levels should be taken at on the top of bank (bund), bed 
invert levels and adjacent paddy field levels (on both sides). 
For  associated  infrastructure,  an  appropriate  no.  of  levels  should  be 
obtained to facilitate its improvement. 
For adjacent areas outside the proposed command area that may be able 
to utilise return water from collectors or main drains through the use of small 
pumps that are interested in being part of the  irrigation scheme, a sufficient  
no.  of  levels  should  be  taken  to  facilitate  system  design  and  associated 
infrastructure                
(b) 
(c) 
(d) 
8. 
Where  it  is  possible  to  operate  the  canals,  undertake  a  water  delivery  efficiency 
assessment which involves operating the irrigation scheme in its present condition and assessing 
(1) the canal flows at head of canal and at each offtake from the main canal to the secondary 
canals or direct field outlets; (2) the flows at each outlet from the secondary canals or direct field 
outlets and (3) noting the areas of the fields able to be served. Based on this data the delivery 
efficiency of the scheme can be determined by estimating the flow per unit area which is then the 
baseline against which the improvements can be compared.

(iv) 
(v) 
(vi) 
(vii) 
(viii) 
(ix) 
Confirming that water is able to reach the existing and proposed command areas 
(assuming  critical  ground  levels  and  delivery  structure  head  losses,  from 
topographic survey)  
Assessing the seasonal water demand (wet season rice / proposed dry season crops) as 
discussed with farmers and Project advisors.  
Confirming water availability from the river (taking due regard for other users and ecological 
demands) to meet the seasonal cropping demands (assuming appropriate efficiencies as 
per modernisation infrastructure options) 
Use of the proposed water demand and waters scheduling specification as the basic water 
demand requirement to be served by the design team. Failure to provide evidence that the 
level of water scheduling required will be achieved will result in no payments for the design 
provided until this is rectified 
Undertaking upgrade / new  design of headwork (if necessary)  by  adopting  the  type and 
configuration of structure with hydraulic and structural sizing in accordance with the flood 
hydrology, sediment loads, diversion requirements and channel topography. Consideration 
of the inclusion of a facility for fish passage is also a requirement.     
Undertaking hydraulic and structural design improvements for the main canal(s) to meet 
the  water  demands  and  sustainability  requirements  as  identified  in  the  field  surveys 
(involves addressing critical sections identified with high failure / maintenance risk)    
Undertaking  hydraulic  and  structural  design  improvements  for    secondary  and  tertiary 
distribution (canals or pipes) as per design agreement with the WUG and the water demand 
Preparing the sizing and layouts for the field channels / pipes (for sprinklers,  drip or hand 
held hoses)  and drains for the delivery of water to the fields (to be constructed / procured 
by the farmers themselves as per Project procedures) 
Preparing a draft operations and maintenance plan for the irrigation scheme containing the 
assumptions used in the modernised designs on (1) how it is to be operated and (2) the 
forecast routine maintenance requirements ie. the work quantities, estimates (labour and 
costs) and schedules to maintain the scheme in fully operational condition once upgraded.         
10. 
Note: The design of the distribution system is to follow a fully participatory and iterative 
process with the farmers to ensure it meets their water use requirements as well as incorporates 
some flexibility to meet changing future demands.  The cropping patterns, areas for promotion of 
dry season high value crops (HVC) to maximise water use and production, and the technologies 
to be adopted in the designs will be determined in discussions between the farmers, the designers 
and the Project advisors The final scheme designs should also balance the capital investment 
with the on-going maintenance requirements after works completion.  
11. 
The designs are to be presented on CAD maps and drawings at appropriate scales to 
clearly show the improved layouts, profiles and sections of the irrigation scheme and in sufficient 
detail and clarity for use in the construction and implementation of the works. 
12. 
A  design  report  which  contains  the  design  details,  assumptions,  calculations  and 
recommendations and the draft agreement between the WUG/WUA and the Project to the design, 
is to be submitted for peer review. Also to be submitted are the draft bills of quantities and tender 
documents based on the agreed procurement arrangements for the Project. 
13. 
the additional of a bill of quantities, cost estimate and indicative procurement packaging.  
The design report once approved or ratified by the WUG/WUA shall be completed with

ANNEX 6: CONSTRUCTION SUPERVISION GUIDELINES 
A. 
Construction Management and Monitoring Guideline  
1. 
General 
1. 
Works  quality  and  contractor  performance  are  key  contributors  to  the  success  of  the 
irrigated agriculture especially during the dry season and the medium costs that will be incurred 
by water users to maintain and operate their schemes. The following guideline is to be applied 
during the implementation of construction contracts by the contractor and supervising personnel.  
It  is  prepared  to  support  management  of  the  construction  contracts  so  that  the  works  are 
completed in compliance with the technical specifications, environmental management plans and 
social safeguard requirements of the SRIWMP with completed irrigation schemes commissioned, 
handed-over and functioning as designed.  Construction Supervision is to be undertaken by each 
Irrigation  Section  who  will  receive  payment  for  the  inputs  to  this  activity  as  per  the  usual 
Government allowance schedules. All payments will be made in arrears once reports are filed, 
reports more than 10 days (2 working weeks) late shall receive no payment and two late reports 
in a row  (or falsification of  reports)  will  result  in the  allowances being  withdrawn and a private 
contractor  recruited.  This  will  incur  substantial  delays  and  additional  costs  to  be  borne  by  the 
respective PAFO. 
2. 
The guideline is not a technical manual as it is assumed that all parties to the contract 
and  personnel  assigned  to  undertake  the  various  tasks  and  duties  during  implementation  are 
appropriately qualified and experienced for executing their responsibilities and are trained in the 
procedures  and  requirements  of  the  project  before  mobilising.  Should  assigned  personnel  not 
have the requisite experience then it is the duty of their superiors to provide the necessary support 
so as they are able to undertake their tasks in compliance with the required standards.  
A  national  construction  supervision  consultant  will  provide  mentoring  and  on-time 
3. 
supervision  of  the  Provincial  construction  supervisors  work  and  performance.  Any  shortfalls  in 
inputs,  quality  of  supervision  or  reporting  will  be  raised  with  each  Provincial  Project  Manager, 
Irrigation Section head and the Head of the PPIT. All such matters will be assigned to the project 
record and reported in both monthly and quarterly reports.  
a. 
Meetings and Site Records 
4. 
minutes prepared. Copies are to be maintained by the project (PPIT) and by the contractor.  
All  formal  meetings  between the  project  and  the contractor  must  be  documented  with 
5. 
All site visits and inspections must be recorded in the site register (record book) which is 
to be maintained at every site (see Annex 1). Photographs, by mobile phone, must also be taken 
at  all  stages  of  construction  especially  during  mandatory  technical  inspections  and  where  any 
defective works, environmental or social issues are observed.         
To facilitate implementation the contactor’s representative assigned to attend meetings 
6. 
and site inspections must be authorized to make decisions on behalf of contractor on issues that 
are  brought  up  during  the  meetings  and  inspections.  Similarly,  the  assigned  site  supervisor(s) 
must  be  authorised  to  make  timely  decisions  (in  consultation  with  appropriate  persons  as 
necessary) on the day to day implementation issues.

On–site pre-construction meeting  
8. 
Prior to the commencement  of  construction,  meetings  with the  communities  are  to  be 
held  to  discuss  the  implementation  activities  and  programme.  At  this  time  the  roles  of  the 
contractor,  project  personnel  and  communities  are  explained.  The  role  of  the  community  in 
assisting  with  monitoring  the  technical,  environmental  and  social  safeguards  aspects  is 
elaborated, emphasising the importance of ensuring quality standards are met as the assets are 
within the community and for which they are responsible  for O&M after completion.          
9. 
Attendees at the meeting must include (at least):  
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
(v) 
(vi) 
Project manager and site foreman of the contractor   
Assigned PAFO / DAFO construction site supervisor(s)  
Other representatives from Provincial Project Implementation Team (PPIT)  
Village leaders 
Villagers – representatives from both beneficiaries and affected persons 
LIC  personnel  where  specific  technical,  environmental  or  social  safeguards 
aspects need to be addressed    
10. 
The following items are to be discussed:  
(i) 
Introduction of implementation staff, responsibilities and coordination  
▪  Contractor and his staff. (i.e Contractor Representative(s), Project Manager, Site 
Supervisor(s), labors) 
▪  PPIT and assigned PAFO / DAFO site supervisor(s) 
▪  Village liaison person(s) – appointed by villagers 
▪  LIC personnel supporting scheme development  
3 
(ii)  Work description and time schedule 
▪  The  works  to  be  undertaken  with  special  attention  paid  to  site  access,  workers  camp, 
machine / materials site, proposed sources for materials and other aspects likely to impact 
on the village eg road use, site safety, etc 
▪  The construction time schedule and works sequencing  
(iii) 
Technical, Environmental and Social Safeguards aspects 
▪  The technical standards / quality control / quality assurance procedures  
▪  The EMMP  
▪  The  social  safeguards  aspects  with  compliance  with  land  settlement  confirmed 
from subproject LARP or DDR 
▪  The grievance procedures with confirmation from villagers that they are understood 
▪  Monitoring and recording of works progress and compliance with technical, environmental 
and social standards. The on-site works register to be maintained and completed on a daily 
basis by on-site staff and during all visits / inspections  
▪  Recording  and  reporting  of  grievances  or  other  concerns  of  individuals  or  community, 
including procedures for recording complaints (verbal or written) and confidential meeting 
requests      
d. 
Works supervision 
Under  SRIWMP,  the  role  of  the  construction  site  supervisor  is  paramount.  He  or  she 
11. 
must not only work in close liaison with the contractor on technical aspects but also will assume 
overall  responsibility  for  day  to  day  monitoring  of  the  environmental  and  social  safeguards 
applicable to the scheme. This will involve familiarising himself / herself with the scope of works, 
conditions of contract, technical specifications, environmental management and monitoring plan 
(EMMP), social safeguards requirements (LARP / DDR), and Gender Action Plan (GAP) for the 
scheme  prior  to  commencement  of the  works  and  then  liaising  closely with the  contractor  and 
communities  to  check  and  report  compliance  during  implementation.  Check  lists  for  regular 
recording of site observations are attached (Annexes 2  – 4).   The construction supervisor will 
also need to work closely with the PGT External Monitor for Social Safeguards on a no-decline 
request basis.      
In  addition  to  the  assigned  site  supervisor  who  is  responsible  for  the  day  to  day 
12. 
supervision and quality control, the works will be inspected at least twice per month during the 
construction  period  by  a  senior  engineer  /  supervisor  from  the  PPIT  who  will  provide  quality 
assurance assessments. These checks are to ensure the day to day monitoring, reporting and 
follow-up  of  issues  are  being  undertaken,  technical  standards  are  being  met  (test  reports 
inspected), environmental and social safeguards are being complied with and appropriate actions 
and  mitigation  are  being  undertaken  in  a  timely  manner.  In  addition  spot  inspections, 
measurements and audits of recorded quantities will be undertaken as will materials supply and 
delivery documents. All materials used on site must be legal and hence require traceability and 
proof of source.         
13. 
These  visits  are  to  be  a  mix  of  unannounced  and  prearranged  inspections  with  the 
inspector  being  accompanied  by  the site supervisor, contractor’s representative,  village liaison 
person (for at least the prearranged visits) and other villager representatives as necessary during 
the walkover surveys. The site record book which is to be kept at the project site at all times during 
4 
the construction period is inspected and countersigned by the senior engineer / supervisor.  A 
quality  assurance  inspection  visit  should  be  scheduled  immediately  before  the  monthly  PPIT 
meeting.  
e. 
Monthly meeting  
14. 
The PPIT will be fully briefed on works progress with decisions on actions to address any 
outstanding issues taken at the monthly project meeting. Where matters are in dispute, both the 
project  site  supervisor  and  the  contractor  (or  contractor’s  representative)  are  to  be  given  the 
opportunity to present their views. This meeting is also the forum at which changes and variation 
orders are presented and ratified.

clear understanding by all participants.   
Use of  photos  to  illustrate points  discussed during  the  meeting  is  important to  ensure 
f. 
Contract Variations 
17. 
Variation  orders  are  required  where  additions  or  deductions  to  the  works  quantities, 
changes  in  specified  materials  or  adjustments  in  technical  methods  increase  or  decrease  the 
contract sum. During the course of the construction, the site supervisor (in consultation with the 
design  engineer,  senior  supervisor  or  LIC  technical  advisor  as  appropriate)  may  instruct  the 
contractor to make any necessary variation of the quantity, quality or form of the works described 
in  the  specifications  and/or  shown  on  the  drawings  without  invalidating  the  contract.  This 
instruction will be done in writing as a Variation Order.  
18. 
Note: As per Lao regulations, Variation Orders are not permitted to exceed 15 % of the 
total  original  contract  value.    A  standard  physical  contingency  of  10%  of original  contract  sum 
should  be  included  within  the  contract  under  the  SRIWMP  which  can  be  utilised  for  Variation 
5 
Orders to facilitate changes to this level without the need to seeking approval for a revised budget 
which often leads to delays.      
19. 
Variations  are  most  commonly  applied  to  increase  or  decrease  of  quantities  already 
included  in  the  Bill  of  Quantity.  The  PPIT  may  approve  a  twenty  percent  (20%)  increase  or 
decrease in an item of work without entitling the contractor to claim an adjustment in item rates. 
The site supervisor must provide justification for additional work with the request certified by the 
senior  engineer  /  supervisor.  Comments  and  recommendations,  if  any,  with  respect  these 
variations must be retained in the contract file. 
20. 
For variations exceeding 20% of listed quantities or when introducing items not included 
in the  Bill  of Quantities, the  contractor  has the right to request  an  increase or  decrease  in the 
current contract unit price and to negotiate the unit price for new items, As for all variations, the 
site supervisor must provide justification for the additional works with the request certified by the 
senior  engineer  /  supervisor  and  comments  and  recommendations,  if  any,  with  respect  these 
variations must be retained in the contract file.  
21. 
A copy of all approved variations should be provided to the contract file in the PPIT and 
at PGT- DoI.  Where there are increases in the contract sum, the revised contact sum must be 
updated on the Provincial Contract Register and advised to ADB to adjust the PCSS.  
g. 
Filing system 
22. 
A copy of the contract drawings, specifications and bills of quantities is to be kept on site 
along  with  the  site  register  (record  book)  at  all  times  for  reference  by  the  contractor  and  site 
supervisor. In addition, copies of the technical, environmental and social safeguard check lists 
are to be on site for completion during inspections. On completion of inspections, digital copies 
are to be made of the completed site forms and sent to the PPIT for review by the senior engineer 
/ supervisor before filing in the main contract file held in the project office.     
23. 
The following filing structure is recommended:  
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
Contract documents 
Letter  of  Acceptance,  Contract  Agreement,  Bank  Guarantees,  Contractor’s 
Workplan etc. 
Payment documents 
▪  Payment requests and payment certificates 
▪  Handing-over inspection forms, defects liability inspection forms 
▪  Letters to and from the contractor 
▪  Minutes of meetings 
(iv)  Materials testing results 
(v) 
(vi) 
Site records (copies of register and check-lists) 
Photographs  
h. 
Works completion inspection  
The contractor is to advise the PPIT in writing when the construction works are completed 
24. 
and  the  irrigation  system  (or  other  infrastructure)  is  ready  for  commissioning.  Within  seven 
calendar days of receiving notice the PPIT will arrange a “contract works completion inspection” 
involving  the  contractor,  site  supervisor  and  appropriate  technical  specialists  (i.e.  civil,  bridge, 
6 
road engineers, etc) as necessary. Village representatives will also be invited to accompany the 
inspection team.  
25. 
This inspection shall involve:  
(i) 
(ii) 
Walk-over visual inspection of the works, and  
Check  of  supporting  documents  (site  register,  test  reports,  materials  verification 
statements, etc) submitted to confirm that the works fulfil the contract requirements  
26. 
necessary and / or any defects identified are to be noted.  
Any  works  found  to  be  outstanding,  areas  where  additional  works  are  considered 
If the PPIT inspection team and the contractor agree that the works are completed (save 
27. 
for  the  minor  pending  or  additional  works  noted),  and  there  is  no  reason  to  prevent  the 
infrastructure being used for the intended purpose, then the PPIT inspection team will recommend 
that  Contract Works  Completion  Certificate be  issued. The  defects  liability  period (normally  12 
months) will commence from the date of issue of this Certificate. A list of the outstanding works 
which must be completed during the defects liability period is agreed with the contractor. During 
the defects liability period, the Contractor also remains responsible for maintaining the works and 
therefore a maintenance schedule should also be agreed.    
28. 
depending on the payment schedule agreed in the Contract.    
At this stage typically up to 80 to 90% payment of Contract Sum is made to the contractor, 
i. 
Commissioning 
29. 
During the defects liability period and before final acceptance (and final payment), the 
infrastructure  must  be  commissioned.  For  an  irrigation  scheme  this  requires  testing  the  entire 
system  at  the  design  full  supply  level  (FSL)  to  confirm  that  all  infrastructure  is  functioning  as 
designed and water is able to be effectively managed to reach (or shown to have the potential to 
reach) every field within the command area. Water must be able to be provided at the correct flow 
rate  at  every  outlet  under  a  rotational  water  management  schedule  for  dry  season  irrigation. 
Commissioning  tests  must  therefore  take  place  in  the  dry  season  or  under  conditions  which 
simulate expected dry season operational requirements. Testing during the wet season based on 
simulating wet season operation is NOT acceptable. 
The  commissioning  must  be  organised  by  the  contractor  assisted  by  the  PPIT  water 
30. 
management staff and the water users. The PPIT must prepare an appropriate irrigation schedule 
to be followed and advise the farmers in advance to participate in witnessing the event.  Testing 
should be of sufficient duration to identify any infrastructure and/or management issue. Any issues 
identified must be clearly recorded, remedial actions determined and appropriately addressed by 
the contractor (if deemed his responsibility) or by the PPIT (if deemed project responsibility). In 
either  case,  the  Final  Completion  Certificate  (and  final  payment)  can  only  be  issued  once  all 
defects are rectified and scheme commissioned.  
31. 
It is important to note that under SRIWMP, final acceptance and final contract payment 
is only made once the irrigation system is proven to be fully functioning with all water users can 
receive water as per the design.   
7 
j. 
Final inspection 
32. 
This final inspection is carried out at the end of the defects liability period once all defects 
have been reported as rectified by the Contractor and commissioning is completed. As for the 
contract works completion inspection, within seven calendar days of receiving notice the PPIT will 
arrange  a  final  inspection  involving  the  contractor,  site  supervisor  and  appropriate  technical 
specialists (i.e. civil, bridge, road engineers, etc) as necessary. Village representatives will also 
be invited to accompany the inspection team.  
33. 
This inspection will undertake a walk-over visual inspection of the rectified works, and 
again  check  supporting  documents  submitted  to  confirm  that  the  works  fulfil  the  contract 
requirements.  
34. 
If the PPIT inspection team and the contractor agree that the works are completed and 
in  the  case  of  the  irrigation  scheme  it  is  fully  operational,  then  the  PPIT  inspection  team  will 
recommend that Final Completion Certificate be issued. At this stage the balance contract amount 
and any retention monies will be paid and infrastructure handed over to the agency or organisation 
responsible for its ongoing O&M. 
35. 
If during final inspection it is demonstrated that any of the affected households who has 
voluntarily released land and assets to the project do not receive the designed level of irrigation 
water,  these  AHHs  are  notified  that  they  may  be  adversely  affected  and  the  land  and  assets 
released by them may be eligible for compensated and as such they still have access to the GRM 
within the REGDF. If households trigger the GRM a corrective action plan will be developed by 
the PPIT and submitted to the ADB for approval. 
k. 
Sub-project handover 
After the Final Completion Certificate is issued, responsibility for the O&M of the irrigation 
36. 
and associated infrastructure constructed under the sub-project is formally “handed over” to the 
respective WUG / WUA. At this stage a ceremony will be conducted to formalise the event.  
However, the “hand-over” process actually starts 12 months earlier once the construction 
37. 
is completed and the scheme can be operated. It continues during the commissioning phase when 
water users participate in the testing and by the end of the first year they will have observed and 
be  familiar  with  its  operation.  During  this  year  the  WUG/WUA  will  be  also  established  (if  not 
already  organised)  and  strengthened  with  the  project  providing  training  to  develop  its 
management  capacity.  With  the  contractor  responsible  for  organising  and  undertaking  the 
maintenance  in  the  first  year,  by  working  with  the  WUG/WUA,  the  water  users  will  gain  an 
appreciation  of  what  these  activities  involve.    It  is  imperative  that  the  project  facilitates  close 
cooperation between the contractor and the water users throughout this first year to ensure the 
WUG/WUA has a good understanding and appreciation of scheme operation and maintenance 
at the time of formal handover.  
It  is  generally  accepted  that  it  takes  three  years  of  experience  after  construction  for 
38. 
farmer  managed  irrigation  schemes  to  become  fully  operational.  Therefore  even  though  the 
WUG/WUA  will  have  had  a  full  year  of  familiarisation  before  formal  handover,  the  support 
throughout the second and third years which is planned by the project is very important for the 
sustainability of the scheme.

5. 
reconciliation between the amounts shown as “received by the project from the ADB” and that 
shown as being disbursed by the Bank. As part of that reconciliation, the auditor should  indicate 
the  mechanism  for  the  disbursement,  i.e.  project’s  advance  account,  PCU  and  PIUs  sub-
accounts, Statements of Expenditures, or direct reimbursement. 
D. 
Statements of Expenditures 
In  addition  to  the  audit  of  the  PFS,  the  auditor  is  required  to  audit  all  SOEs  used  as 
6. 
the basis  for  the  submission  of  withdrawal  applications.  The  auditor  should  apply  such  tests 
and controls as the auditor considers necessary under the circumstances. These expenditures 
should be carefully compared for project eligibility with the relevant financing agreements.  Where 
ineligible  expenditures  are  identified  as  having  been  included  in  withdrawal  applications  and 
reimbursed against, these  should  be  separately  noted  by  the  auditor.  Annexed  to  the  Project 
Financial Statements  should be  a  schedule listing individual  SOE withdrawal applications  by 
specific reference number and amount. The total withdrawals under the SOE procedure should 
be part of the overall reconciliation of Bank disbursements described above. 
E. 
Advance Accounts 
In  conjunction  with  the  audit  of  the  Project  Financial  Statements,  the  auditor  is  also 
7. 
required to audit the activities of the project’s advance account and all sub-accounts associated 
with the Project. The advance accounts and all sub-accounts usually comprise 
(a) 
(b) 
(c) 
(d) 
deposits and replenishments received from the Bank 
payments substantiated by withdrawal  applications 
interest that may be earned from the balances and which belong to the  borrower; 
and 
the remaining balances at the end of each fiscal year. 
8. 
The  auditor  must  form  an  opinion  as  to  the  degree  of  compliance  with  the  ADB’s 
procedures and the balance of the advance account at year-end.  The audit should examine 
the eligibility and correctness of financial transactions during the period under review and  fund 
balances  at  the  end  of  such  a  period,  the  operation  and  use  of  the  advance  account  in 
accordance with the financing agreement, and the adequacy of internal controls for this type of 
disbursement mechanism. 
9. 
For this project, the project advance accounts are referred to in [cite references] of  the 
relevant  financing  agreements.  Project  advances  account  statements  and  the  auditor’s  report 
should be attached with the Project Financial Statements 
F. 
Audit Opinion 
10. 
Besides a primary opinion on the Project Financial Statements, the annual audit report of 
the  Project  Accounts  should  include  a  separate  paragraph  commenting  on  the  accuracy  and 
propriety of expenditures withdrawn under SOE procedures and the extent to which the Bank can 
rely  on  SOEs  as  a  basis  for  loan  disbursement.  The  financial  statements,  including  the  audit 
report,  should  be  received  by  the  Bank  no  later  than  [three  to  six]  months  after  the  end  of 
the  accounting  period  to  which  the  audit  refers.  The  auditor  should  submit  the  report  to  the 
borrower’s  designated  agent  rather  than  to  any  staff  member  of  the  project  entity. The  agent 
should then promptly forward two copies of the audited accounts and report to the Bank. 
3 
G. 
Management Letter 
In addition to the audit reports, the auditor will prepare a “management letter,” in which 
11. 
the auditor will: 
(a) 
(b) 
(c) 
(d) 
(e) 
give comments and observations on the accounting records, systems, and controls that 
were examined during the course of the audit; 
identify specific deficiencies and areas of weakness in systems and controls and make 
recommendation for their improvement; 
report on the degree of compliance of each of the financial covenants on the financing 
agreement and give comments,  if any, on  internal and external matters  affecting  such 
compliance; 
communicate matters that have come to attention during the audit which might have  a 
significant impact on the implementation of the project; and 
bring to the borrower’s attention any other matters that the auditor considers pertinent. 
H. 
General 
12. 
The auditor should be given access to all legal documents, correspondence,  and   any 
other information associated with the project and deemed necessary by the auditor. Confirmation 
should  also  be  obtained  of  amounts  disbursed  and  outstanding  at  the  Bank  [and  of  amounts 
disbursed  under  [specify  other  donor,  loan  or  grant,  if  any].  ADB  Project  Officer  can  assist 
in obtaining these confirmations. 
It is highly desirable that the auditor become familiar with a copy of the ADB’s Guidelines 
13. 
on  Financial  Governance  and  Management  of  Investment  Projects  Financed  by  the  Asian 
Development Bank (2002, as amended time to time),61 which summarizes the ADB’s  financial 
reporting  and  auditing requirements. The  auditor should  also  be  familiar  with  the  ADB’s  Loan 
Disbursement Handbook (2012, as amended time to time).62

TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR THE AUDIT OF PROVINCE XXX  
A. 
Background 
The  (name  of  province)  Provincial  XXX  is  a  state-owned  enterprise  (state  company) 
1. 
responsible for the provision of  water supply service in the  province.  Under  Articles 
153 and 216 of the Law on Enterprises (No. 11/NA, 9 November 2005), a  state-owned enterprise 
shall recruit an independent auditor to verify the accuracy of information in the accounting records 
in  accordance  with  the  Law  on  Enterprise  Accounting  prior  to  the submission  of  its  balance 
sheet  and  annual  report  to  the  shareholders  at  least  once  a  year. These Terms of Reference 
(TOR) are issued in compliance with the requirements  on independent audit under the existing 
law. 
B. 
Objectives of the Audit 
•  To  verify  if  the  accounting  records  provide  the  correct  basis  in  the  preparation  of  the 
financial  statements  of  the  enterprise  in  compliance  with  the  Law  on  Enterprise 
Accounting and generally accepted accounting principles; 
•  To  determine  if  the  enterprise  maintains  an  adequate  system  of  internal  control  and 
supporting documentation and records for its financial transactions; and 
•  To  enable  the  auditor  to  express  a  professional  opinion  on  whether  the  financial 
statements, comprising the balance sheet and related statement of  income, present fairly 
in all material respects the financial position of the enterprise as of end of the  fiscal year 
and its financial performance for the year then ended in accordance with Lao  PDR and 
generally accepted accounting and financial reporting standards. 
C. 
Preparation of Annual Financial Statements 
•  The enterprise is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these  financial 
statements in accordance with Lao PDR and generally accepted accounting  and financial 
reporting standards. This responsibility includes: designing, implementing and maintaining 
internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements 
that are free from material misstatements,  whether  due to fraud or error;  selecting  and 
applying  appropriate  accounting  policies;  and  making  accounting  estimates  that  are 
reasonable in the circumstances. 
•  The auditor’s responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements based on 
his audit. He shall conduct his audit in accordance with Lao PDR and generally accepted 
standards on auditing. Those standards require that he comply with ethical requirements 
and  plan  and  perform  the  audit  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  whether  the  financial 
statements  are  free  from  material  misstatements.  The  audit  involves  performing 
procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial 
statements.  The  procedures  selected  depend  on  the  auditor’s  judgment,  including  the 
assessment of the risk of material misstatements of the financial statements, whether due 
to fraud or error. In making those risks assessments, the auditor considers  internal control 
relevant  to the  entity’s  preparation  and  fair  presentation  of  the  financial  statements  in 
order  to  design  the  audit  procedures  that  are  appropriate  in  the circumstances. The 
audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of  accounting policies  used  and  the 
reasonableness  of  accounting  estimates  made  by  management, as well as evaluating 
the overall presentation of the financial statements.

Sustainable Rural Infrastructure and Watershed Management Sector Project (RRP LAO 50236) 
ANNEX 9: INDEPENDENT SOCIAL SAFEGUARDS MONITORING 
A. 
Introduction  
The Government of Lao PDR recognizes has recognized the importance of productive 
1. 
rural infrastructure (PRI) in driving rural growth and has invested heavily  in it over the  past 30 
years. Irrigation investment has until now targeted food security policy objectives mostly through 
the  production  of  wet  season  rice.  Lao  PDR  is  currently  self-sufficient  in  rice  and  as  such  the 
Sustainable Rural Infrastructure and Watershed Management Sector Project (SRIWSM) will direct 
irrigation investment into economic growth policy objectives with a focus on dry season irrigated 
agriculture. An integral part of this move is the integration of nutrition sensitive agriculture and 
nutrition improvement by diversifying food sources. 
2. 
The project will modernize at least 16 irrigation schemes to secure reliable dry season 
irrigation for water users that is both reliable in terms of quantity, time of delivery and place of 
delivery.  The  project  seeks  to  offset  risks  to  producers  from  high  value  crop  markets  and  the 
destruction  of  upstream  catchments.  Smallholders  who  to  date  have grown  a  wet  season  rice 
crop will be able to grow and market high value crops and livestock farming systems.  
The  SRIWSM  will  achieve  its  outcome  of  high-value  agricultural  production,natural 
3. 
resources  management,  status  of  women,  and  community  nutrition  improved  by  bringing 
approximately 3,800 hectares of land under dry season irrigation, producing and marketing over 
30,000 tons of high value crops and improving the number of women who meet minimum dietary 
diversity in target communities by 50%. It will do this through four outputs: 
4. 
Output  1:  Market-oriented  agricultural  production  increased.  The  output  involves 
identifying  markets  and  connecting  producers  to  these  markets,  providing  support  for  value 
addition  along  the  market  chain.  Technical  support  will  be  provided  for  development  of  the 
agribusiness  capacity  for  market  assessments,  market-led  farm  planning  and  facilitating 
investment into post-harvest value addition, improved logistics for market connectivity, and quality 
assurance and traceability systems that respond to trade requirements. The LIC will support the 
establishment and institutionalization of agribusiness capacity within each PAFO supporting the 
development of market-led commercial agriculture including irrigated dry season high value crops 
and livestock. 
5. 
Output  2:  Watershed  ecological  services  protected.  The  project  will  support  the 
update or development of participatory land use plans for villages within the catchments of PRI 
infrastructure. The project will support land use behavior change programs to protect the soil and 
water  based  ecological  services  and  embed  these  changes  within  negotiated  community 
agreements.  The LIC will support this process through the provision of a land use management 
and  land  use  change  advisor  to  support  the  Provincial  Land  Use  Planning  teams.  Further 
technical  support  will  be  mobilized  to  support  the  technical  requirements  of  behavior  change 
programs.  
Output  3:  Command  area  irrigation  reliability  improved.  This  output  supports 
6. 
irrigation infrastructure modernization for dry season irrigated agriculture and other infrastructure 
to support community wellbeing. A key element of the investment is the capacity of local water 
users to operate and manage water delivery systems during the dry season. The LIC will support 
the  establishment  of  water  user  groups  and  the  members  to  develop  knowledge,  skills  and 
information systems to operate dry season irrigation reliably whilst also maintaining their irrigation 
assets.  
2 
Output 4: Nutrition awareness and facilities improved. This output will be undertaken 
7. 
in  Xiangkhouang  and  Houaphan  provinces.  The  project  will  upscale  existing  pilot  programs  in 
approximately 20 nutrition-priority villages in each of the six districts. The scale-up methods will 
nutrition clubs, providing social behavior change communication programs and nutrition training, 
and supporting club and individual development plans designed to increase the production and 
year-round consumption of diverse and nutritious foods. This output will not be within the scope of 
the LIC technical consultants and will be single sourced to an existing service provider in the two 
provinces included.  
is 
the 
SRIWSM 
first  ADB 
irrigation  subsector  project 
8. 
to  use  decentralized 
implementation. The role of the Department of Irrigation is to establish common systems and to 
manage  governance  risks  within  the  provincial  implementation  agencies.  Risks  associated  with 
procurement,  delays,  decentralized  financial  management,  and  safeguard  requirements  will  be 
subject to oversight from a Program Governance Team in DOI. The LIC will support the Program 
Governance Team in overall project planning and coordination, project management and reporting, 
financial and procurement support, monitoring and safeguard reporting.  
9. 
Within each province the project will be implemented through the structure of the PAFO. 
Here the LIC will support the PAFO implementation teams through the provision of skills relating 
to Project management coordination,  safeguards  and  technical  expertise relating to  dry  season 
irrigated  agriculture  and high value  crops  with each Province  having  a project  team  leader that 
reports to and support the DG PAFO.   
10. 
The  SRIWSM  will  be  implemented  over  a  period  of  seven  years.  The  Ministry  of 
Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) will be the executing agency and implementation will be through 
the Provincial Agriculture and Forestry Offices, in collaboration with other provincial and district 
level offices.

ANNEX 10: TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR SERVICE PROVIDER FOR SOCIAL IMPACT 
ASSESSMENT AND SOCIAL SAFEGUARD SURVEYS 
A. 
Introduction and Background 
1. 
The Lao People’s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) will receive a Loan in late-2019 from 
the Asian Development Bank (ADB) towards the cost of implementation of further works under 
the proposed Sustainable Rural Infrastructure and Watershed Management Sector project (the 
Project). The further works will be funded through an ADB loan and grant-financed Project, part 
of which will be used to finance eligible payments for the consulting services required to assist 
with the overall implement of the Project. The executing agency (EA) for the Project is the Ministry 
of  Agriculture  and  Forestry  (MAF),  which  exercises  its  responsibilities  through  its  Program 
Governance  Team  (PGT)  situated  in  Vientiane  capital  city,  comprising  representatives  of  the 
Department  of  Irrigation  (DoI),  and  supported  by  a  loan  implementation  consultant  (LIC). 
Implementation of the subprojects under the Project will be carried out by the provincial offices of 
agriculture and forestry (PAFOs) in the provinces of Houaphan, Louangphabang, Xaignabouli and 
Xiangkhouang. 
2. 
The  Project  has  four  outputs  (i)  market-oriented  agricultural  production  increased;  (ii) 
watershed ecological services protected; (iii)  command area irrigation reliability increased; and 
(iv) nutrition awareness and facilities improved. Within the scope of these outputs, MAF together 
with the four target PAFOs will identify up to about 11 additional subprojects. The period for which 
SIA services are required is around five years, commencing in project year 1 last quarter.  
B. 
Social Impact Assessment teams   
3. 
Essentially,  SIA  will  be  undertaken  as  part  of  the  preparation  of  the  remaining  11 
additional subprojects to (i) provide socio-economic data to PAFO-PPIT for use in the preparation 
of feasibility and other studies, and (ii) provide a reference point for assessing social impact and 
the likely contribution to project outcomes and outputs. The data collected will contribute to the 
project baselines.  
Following completion of each subproject, SIA-SSG will conduct a post-implementation 
4. 
survey and collect all other secondary data as necessary to undertake a social impact assessment 
and  prepare  a  report  on  its  findings.  The  framework  and  approach  for  survey,  data  collection, 
analysis  and  reporting  will  be  agreed  with  LIC  and  the  executing  agency  prior  to  the 
commencement of any work, as well as any social indicators to be used. SIA will work under the 
supervision and guidance of LIC and under the overall direction of PGT to ensure all aspects are 
effectively coordinated and meet ADB requirements. 
1. 
Scope of work for producing Additional Subproject SIA reports  
1. 
The scope of work for SIA is summarized below: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
Review the procedure for the conduct of the Socio-Economic Analysis and Social 
Impact Assessment in accordance with ADB’s Policy on Gender and Development

The Survey Company will conduct the following detailed scope of work and 
cover  all  additional  subprojects  (these  can  be  combined  for  DMS  and 
SESAH): 
All surveys: 
•  Questionnaire /survey form translation. The survey firm will prepare 
questionnaire / survey form for each survey and a translation of all 
survey and questionnaire forms, and submit to the TRTA social 
safeguards expert for review and “no objection”. The use of 
questionnaire / survey forms on tablet or similar is encouraged.  
•  Conduct training for interviewers and facilitators. The training will 
commence with training for all field staff and will include Project 
background and purpose, project policies that can affect the 
households and community, reviewing data collection instruments, 
interview and discussion facilitation, data collection techniques and 
protocols, editing of completed questionnaires and focal group 
reports, cleaning and formatting of collected data.  
•  Develop a field visit, data collection and milestone schedule – 
Survey firm will provide the Project – and the DOI counterpart - with 
a work plan schedule showing when field work will take place in each 
target village and when payment milestones will be achieved. 
•  Public  consultation  and 
information  dissemination.  Prior 
to 
commencing actual data collection and surveys, a village meeting to 
be convened explaining the Project, purpose, goals, main activities, 
basic  policy 
land  acquisition,  Grievance  Resolution 
towards 
Mechanism and compensation policy. 
•  Participation and Attendance Records. Details of participants must 
be obtained from each and every meeting, interview and 
consultation. An attendance sheet is to be used for all events with 
communities, groups and also government agencies as needed, and 
all participants must fill in and sign the attendance sheets. 
•  Photo record. Photos will be taken of all meetings and interviews, 
and of impacted plots with land owners. These must be properly 
labelled indicating the names, location, date and event. 
5 
•  Develop quality control procedures to ensure that high quality 
primary data is collected. The survey team leader must undertake 
ongoing checks of data collected for accuracy and quality. Upon 
start-up, the TL should check the datasets by each team member to 
ensure correctness. Data collected in each village must be checked 
before leaving the village. 
•  Data analysis – Provide the Project with electronic versions of the 
raw data collected and produce summary data tables as a minimum. 
The firm may produce additional summary tables if regarded as 
adding value to the information. The data should be presented on 
single excel sheet for clarity, but with necessary drop down and filter 
menus.  
•  Reporting - All reports shall be produced using Microsoft Office 
software in English language. Text will be Arial 11 font, and tables 
will be prepared in a separate Excel file and pasted into the report 
document. The report shall contain short text descriptions of tables, 
figures, and graphs to present the survey data and report against the 
variables and conditions as indicated in the survey instruments. 
Photos should be contained in a separate appendix to the report. 
Copies of Word, Excel and photograph files used in preparation of 
the data and report will be provided to the client, along with 5 hard 
copies of the report itself.

•  Village  committee.  The  VC  comprise  the  head  and  deputies,  Party 
representative,  LWU,  Elders,  Tax,  Security,  WUG/WUA  and  other 
CBO management, and other key persons. 
•  Separate Women’s and Men’s Focal Group Discussions. Focal 
Groups should comprise of between 6 to 8 people per group in order 
to allow for group discussion and the number, sex and ethnicity of 
people participating in these FGDs must be recorded.  
•  Water User Groups. Water User Groups (WUGs) are essential for 
the project as the affordability and viability of the project investments 
will largely be determined by the operation of dry season irrigation 
and water control systems. These will require WUG members 
through the irrigation service fee to finance these inputs, which will 
require substantial awareness and capacity building within the 
WUGs. 
•  Civil Society Organizations. If there are civil society organizations 
working in the subproject villages, especially active on rural 
development, agriculture, poverty reduction, ethnic minority groups 
or similar fields, interviews need to be conducted following 
introduction of the project scope, purpose and objectives. 
6 
•  Affected Household socio-economic survey. The socio-economic 
household level survey is conducted with HHs identified as 
potentially losing some land for the subproject construction. The 
Village Committee will assist in the identification and arranging an 
interview schedule. SES HH sample size should be between 5-10% 
of HHs in each selected village, depending on the village population, 
to ensure representative sample. Survey firm will select 
representative villages for the field survey. 
(2)  Detailed  Measurement  Survey  (DMS)  and  Socio-Economic  Survey  of 
Affected Households (SESAH) need to cover the following: 
•  Cover 100% of the affected households. Interview and complete the 
SES with each AHH (AHH to sign completed form as a correct 
record of the interview). 
•  Conduct meeting with village committee and the WUG to identify the 
Affected HHs. Arrange a time and schedule to conduct AHH 
impacted land structure and asset measurement and HH interview. 
•  Conduct physical inspection of the impacted area with the Village 
Committee (VC) and AHH owners, measure and count affected 
assets (affected land by the project, and total land of affected 
households need to be both measured). Obtain GPS coordinates of 
affected assets (parcel boundaries and affected area boundaries), 
and photo of affected asset and owner. Record losses on DMS form 
(AHH and VC to sign as correct). 
•  Any communal land or structures affected must be measured and 
agreed by the VC.  
•  Design and prepare DMS data base – computer input of 
measurement and HH and affected asset ID data. Prepare the 
summary Inventory of Losses and SESAH data for each subproject 
based on the affected HH data. 
•  Prepare a site map of affected land and other assets using the GPS 
coordinates and linking affected parcel to affected HH database (via 
title certificate number if available or if not, an identifying code for 
each affected HH). 
• 
•  Provide a summary details of land to be acquired under the Project 
that will be required in order to transfer the acquired land within 
existing titles to the government. 
In case of communal land allocation systems confirm the system and 
clearly define use rights (even if rotational) to ensure that at the time 
of measurement the holder of the use right will still be the holder of 
use rights that are being compensated at the time of implementation. 
Check as to when (year and month) the next round of land 
allocations will take place and whether or not the VC know which 
HHs will be allocated what land. If known, these details should be 
summarized. 
In case of Concessionaires leasing land verify details of the 
agreement for plantation(s) falling into the impacted areas, identify 
• 
7 
who is growing the products, the actual land owner and their plot 
size, and what the arrangements are regarding land rental or lease 
and the date of expiry of any existing agreements with the 
landowner. 
In the case of affected communal land, it is possible that the affected 
land may have been reserved for a specific use in the village 
development plan. Such uses could include land reserved for 
bridges, where the village plans to construct the bridge whenever it 
has sufficient budget. Such reserved land should be identified. 
In all additional subprojects, it is possible that AHH have received 
compensation of the affected land under a previous project. The 
question has been included in the AHH SES form 
• 
• 
•  AHH Agreement in Principle. Details of the inventory of losses for 
each household are taken from the DMS Summary form and 
inserted on the AHH Voluntary Land and Asset Release Form, which 
is to be distributed to the AHH for signing if they wish to do so.

ANNEX 13: TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR INTERNATIONAL START-UP 
PROGRAM MANAGEMENT CONSULTANT AND NATIONAL START-UP 
PROCUREMENT SPECIALIST 
A. 
Introduction  
1. 
The  Government  of  Lao  PDR  has  recognized  the  importance  of  productive  rural 
infrastructure (PRI) in driving rural growth and has invested heavily in it over the past 30 years. 
Irrigation  investment  has  until  now  targeted  food  security  policy  objectives  mostly  through  the 
production  of  wet  season  rice.  Lao  PDR  is  currently  self-sufficient  in  rice  and  as  such  the 
Sustainable Rural Infrastructure and Watershed Management Sector Project (SRIWSM) will direct 
irrigation investment into economic growth policy objectives with a focus on dry season irrigated 
agriculture. An integral part of this move is the integration of nutrition sensitive agriculture and 
nutrition improvement by diversifying food sources. 
2. 
The project will modernize at least 16 irrigation schemes to secure reliable dry season 
irrigation for water users that is both reliable in terms of quantity, time of delivery and place of 
delivery.  The  project  seeks  to  offset  risks  to  producers  from  high  value  crop  markets  and  the 
destruction  of  upstream  catchments.  Smallholders  who  to  date  have grown  a  wet  season  rice 
crop will be able to grow and market high value crops and livestock farming systems.  
The  SRIWSMP  will  achieve  its  outcome  of  high-value  agricultural  production,  natural 
3. 
resources  management,  status  of  women,  and  community  nutrition  improved  by  bringing 
approximately 3,800 hectares of land under dry season irrigation, producing and marketing over 
30,000 tons of high value crops and improving the number of women who meet minimum dietary 
diversity in target communities by 50%. It will do this through four outputs: 
Output  1:  Market-oriented  agricultural  production  increased.  The  output  involves 
4. 
identifying  markets  and  connecting  producers  to  these  markets,  providing  support  for  value 
addition  along  the  market  chain.  Technical  support  will  be  provided  for  development  of  the 
agribusiness  capacity  for  market  assessments,  market-led  farm  planning  and  facilitating 
investment into post-harvest value addition, improved logistics for market connectivity, and quality 
assurance and traceability systems that respond to trade requirements. A loan implementation 
consultant (LIC) situated within the Department of Irrigation (DOI) will support the establishment 
and institutionalization of agribusiness capacity within each PAFO supporting the development of 
market-led commercial agriculture including irrigated dry season high value crops and livestock. 
A provincial LIC will be situated within the provincial agriculture and forestry office (PAFO) in each 
province to support the provincial project implementation team (PPIT). 
Output  2:  Watershed  ecological  services  protected.  The  project  will  support  the 
5. 
update or development of participatory land use plans for villages within the catchments of PRI 
infrastructure. The project will support land use behavior change programs to protect the soil and 
water  based  ecological  services  and  embed  these  changes  within  negotiated  community 
agreements. LIC will support this process through the provision of a land use management and 
land  use  change  advisor  to  support  the  provincial  land  use  planning  teams.  Further  technical 
support will be mobilized to support the technical requirements of behavior change programs.  
Output  3:  Command  area  irrigation  reliability  improved.  This  output  supports 
6. 
irrigation infrastructure modernization for dry season irrigated agriculture and other infrastructure 
to support community wellbeing. A key element of the investment is the capacity of local water 
users  to  operate  a  managed  water  delivery  systems  during  the  dry  season.  The  LIC  DOI  will 
2 
support the establishment of water user groups and the members to develop knowledge, skills 
and  information  systems  to  operate  dry  season  irrigation  reliably  whilst  also  maintaining  their 
irrigation assets.  
Output 4: Nutrition awareness and facilities Improved. This output will be undertaken 
7. 
in  Xiangkhouang  and  Houaphan  provinces.  The  project  will  upscale  existing  pilot  programs  in 
approximately 20 nutrition-priority villages in each of the six districts. The scale-up methods will 
nutrition clubs, providing social behavior change communication programs and nutrition training, 
and supporting club and individual development plans designed to increase the production and 
year-round consumption of diverse and nutritious foods. This output will not be within the scope 
of the LIC technical consultants and will be single sourced to an existing service provider in the 
two provinces included.

within  the  Provincial  implementation  agencies.  Risks  associated  with  procurement,  delays, 
decentralized financial management, and safeguard requirements will be subject to oversight from 
a Program Governance Team in DOI. The LIC DOI will support the Program Governance Team 
in  overall  project  planning  and  coordination,  project  management  and  reporting,  financial  and 
procurement support, monitoring and safeguard reporting.  
9. 
Within each province the project will be implemented through the structure of the PAFO. 
Here  the  LIC  DOI  will  support  the  PAFO  implementation  teams  through  the  provision  of  skills 
relating to Project management coordination, safeguards and technical expertise relating to dry 
season irrigated agriculture and high value crops with each Province having a project team leader 
that reports to and support the DG PAFO.   
10. 
The  SRIWSMP  will  be  implemented  over  a  period  of  seven  years.  The  Ministry  of 
Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) will be the executing agency and implementation will be through 
the PAFOs, in collaboration with other provincial and district level offices. 
B. 
Consulting Services  
11. 
As part of the implementation arrangements a range of consulting services packages will 
be procured along with project management support services to support the devolved nature of 
project  implementation.  Such  services  include  five  loan  implementation  consultant  (LIC) 
packages,  social  survey  and  safeguards,  etc.  The  LIC  packages  will  each  be  recruited  as  a 
company  using  ADB’s  CMS  and  QCBS  procedures  based  on  a  95:05  (technical:  financial) 
criterion. The main LIC team will be based in the Department of Irrigation (DOI) in Vientiane, and 
the  four  provincial  LICs  one  in  each  province  to  provide  project  management  support  to  the 
PAFOs. Advance actions will enable contracting by the third quarter of 2020. 
12. 
Since procurement of the LIC packages will take some time (around 12 months), and to 
help kick-start project implementation, two start-up specialists will be engaged initially to bridge 
the support gap between the end of the TRTA and the start of the project. Advance action will be 
taken on the recruitment of these two specialists such that contracts can be signed immediately 
following  effectiveness.  The  two  specialists  will  help  the  executing  agency  and  implementing 
agencies to initiate project activities and to help recruit the LICs and other consulting packages. 
13. 
An international project management start up consultant for  12 person months will be 
recruited  as  an  individual  with  experience  in  project  management,  procurement  and  project 
3 
management  systems,  preferably  over  at  least  ten  years.  The  role  will  work  closely  with  the 
Program  Governance  Team  (PGT)  in  the  Department  of  Irrigation  (DOI)  and  the  respective 
Provincial  Project  Implementation  Teams  (PPITs)  situated  in  the  Provincial  Agriculture  and 
Forestry  Offices  (PAFOs)  in  each  province  to  advance  the  start-up  through  building  project 
implementation teams, ensuring all staff are as agreed, ensure all are fully aware of the project, 
roles and responsibilities and the systems that will be established in the first 2–3 quarters of the 
project calendar. 
14. 
A national procurement start-up specialist for 15 person-months will also be recruited.

ANNEX 15: WATER RESOURCE MASTER PLAN - TERMS OF REFERENCE  
A. 
Background and overview  
1. 
The preparation of a water resources management plan with supporting investment plan 
is  proposed.  The  proposal  for  this  initiative  includes  a  series  of  iterative  steps  some  of  which 
precede The SRIWSM implementation period.  
2. 
The first step has been the irrigation subsector review that is being implemented by IWMI 
under  contract  to  the  NRI-  AF  project  funded  by  ADB.  This  study  is  contracted  to  deliver  in 
December  2018  however  it  is  now  extended through  to  late  2019 and suffers from  substantial 
data gaps. During this period the MAF and DOI have formed working groups to start work on an 
irrigation  sector  strategy  that  was  intended  to  use  the  IWMI  output.  The  working  groups  have 
started to form a vision of an irrigation sector strategy but this remains a work in progress and 
risks  being  short  of  data  and  analytics  regarding  (i)  effectiveness  and  efficiency  within  the 
irrigation sector, (ii) the role of irrigation in the ongoing and accelerating rural transformation that 
is gathering momentum in Lao PDR, (iii) the operational incentives for innovation and efficiency, 
(iv) risks to water supplies resulting from competing uses, climate change impacts and the indirect 
impacts of watershed land use conversion of downstream water availability.  
3. 
During the preparation of SRIWSM the challenges to irrigation and the role of irrigation 
in future rural economic development were identified as substantial drivers with the wider problem 
and opportunities within the sector. Concurrently, the 2018 monsoon flood season highlighted the 
interactions  between  land  uses,  competing  water  use  flood  management  systems  and  costs, 
drought risks and challenges in high cost low efficiency irrigated agriculture. A significant concern 
was the significant cost of reparation and emergency relief as a result of both the monsoonal flood 
pulse and the additional pulse created from hydro-storage release along with the realization that 
with  increased  storage  coming  on-stream  that  such  risks  are  likely  to  increase  along  with  the 
associated costs.  
4. 
In response the Government of Lao PDR has indicated a need to adopt a wider multi-
sector approach to water resource management than the proposed irrigation sector strategy or 
master plan that had been planned. SRIWSM is proposing to provide support to the development 
of an informed and evidence-based national water resources management plan and associated 
multi-sector investment plan to implement the management plan.  
5. 
As a multisector initiative the endorsement of the wider programming is required from 
the National Assembly, and once obtained (planned for late 2019) the SRIWSM will resource the 
development of the master plan.  
B. 
National Assembly Concept Paper Purpose 
6. 
The preparation of a Concept Paper to the National Assembly on the need for improved 
water resource management for managing the cost of impacts from floods.  The purpose of the 
concept paper is to present to the national assembly information on the scale and impact of flood 
and water resource management impacts. The purpose being to obtain a directive from the NA 
for  the  development  of  a  multi-sector  approach  to  water  resource  management  that  includes 
agricultural  use,  hydro-storage  and  power  generation,  industrial  uses,  urban  demand  and 
environmental flows.  
2 
The paper seeks to present an overview of the nature and scale of trade-offs involved in 
7. 
the prioritization of alternative uses and management of water resources. These trade-offs include 
the  low  level  of  water  use  efficiency  within  the  predominant  use  of  available  water  for  current 
irrigation  systems,  the  interaction  of  watershed  land  use  and  catchment  discharge  rates,  the 
impact  of  incentives  for  maximizing  hydro-generation  versus  management  of  downstream 
impacts arising from flood induced storage release including the need (i) disaster and emergency 
responses  from  the  Government,  the  impact  on  social  and  economic  infrastructure  and  the 
incremental impact and costs of flood release on resilient flood protection infrastructure.  
8. 
The paper will present to the NA the (i) scope and (ii) impacts of floods within Lao, and 
(iii) show likely future scenarios that lead to the increased frequency, impact and costs of such 
flooding. The report seeks to obtain an NA mandate for the preparation of a multi-sector water 
resource management master plan that targets the contributing factors to increased flood impacts 
and costs and which will identify priority investment and management systems that reverse the 
trend of increasing costs of flooding. 
This paper will be issue – impact report that provides insight to the scale of the issue, the 
9. 
nature of floods and the range of contributing factors along with impacts, and potential trade-offs 
in the way water resources are managed – from upper catchment, to within catchment storage 
management, downstream flood protection including increasing the ability to live with floods. At 
this stage data sets will only be partial but need to evidence, to the extent possible, the issue of 
flooding and the costs for the Public Investment Budget going forward. 
The report to the National Assembly seeks: 
“to state the flooding problem or issue, the range of impacts and costs of such events, the 
contributing factors for increasing impacts and options or scenarios to manage the level of 
impacts using evidence from recent past events.” 
The report to the National Assembly should 
“ not mirror or represent itself to be a preliminary WRM Master Plan as it serves a different 
role that is to obtain a mandate for developing a multisector WRM Master Plan.”  
II. 
THE REPORT FOR THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY (NA REPORT) 
A. 
Objective  
10. 
The thesis is that the cost of flooding to the economy of Lao PDR to both private sector 
and  the  public  investment  budget  is  excessively  high  due  in  part  to  the  manner  in  which 
contributing  factors  are  managed.    Understanding  the  options  for  improved  multi-sector 
management  of  water  across  a  landscape  that  includes  both  upstream  and  downstream 
catchments  will  provide  the  basis  for  defining  the  trade-offs  that  can  then  inform  options  for 
reduced dependence on emergency and disaster response spending.  
The  NA  report  will  indicate  the  future  direction  of  impacts  due  to  changes  in  the 
11. 
contributing  factors  and  forces  behind  flooding  events  including:  catchment  deforestation, 
reservoir  management  (for  both  irrigation  and  hydro  objectives)    during  monsoon  and  high 
3 
intensity  rain  events,  the  impact  of  expected  climate  change,  and  the  nature  of  downstream 
development  i.e.,  the  trend  toward  increased  density  of  urban  living  and  the  manner  in  which 
economic and social infrastructure is developed in areas of high risk.  It also needs to present the 
institutional incentives that current contribute to increased flooding from across all sectors.  
12. 
It is proposed that the report will draw on data and information that is accessible to the 
preparation  team.  Some  of  this  needs  to  be  country  wide,  region  specific  but  there  will  be 
significant gaps. To provide a strong evidence base it is suggested to use the 2018 flood event 
from Nam Ngum and take components of the impacts to build a more detailed understanding of 
the multisector roles within the event.

18. 
 The output will be a clear road map of current institutional arrangements (both de jure 
and  de  facto)  relating  to  water  users,  disaster  management  and  infrastructure  and  spatial 
planning. The study will conduct an institutional study for all the sectors and downs stream impacts 
linked  to  the  Water  Resource  Management  plan.  This  will  cover:  laws,  regulations  and  then 
planning and institutional mandate, jurisdiction, authority, roles and responsibilities through to the 
end users of water. 
4. 
Sector Performance and Impact Assessments 
19. 
A  key  aspect  is  to  understand  the  relative  value  of  water  and  water  resource 
infrastructure  between  sectors.  This  will  require  development  on  appropriate  models  through 
which  resource  demand  projections  can  be  derived.  The  models  should  be  able  to  present 
evidence based financial and economic returns to water allocated to the different sector uses by 
specific region.  It is envisaged that this would include a series of water user surveys, that may 
be form credible reports, or from additional case study or surveys that are implemented to fill data 
gaps.  Sector  models for  land  use  will  need  to  be aggregated to  the scale  of priority  or  agreed 
management units and for land users this will need to reflect the returns to land labor and capital 
at a range of scales from household to irrigation scheme, upper watersheds,  and to wider impact 
catchment.   Other  users  will  need  to  be  able  to report the marginal  value  of  output  per  unit  of 
water. The models will need to be able to accommodate externalities and linkage between sectors 
including those that are interdependent, and those that create offsite impacts to social economic 
goals or infrastructure capital and maintenance costs. 
6 
The models should be developed for indicative or representative management units as 
20. 
discussed above. In addition, multi-sector economic impact models can be used to assess the 
impacts at the level of local provincial and national economy in terms of overall output, income 
and employment effects.  It is expected that the representative models will include coverage of 
different  regional  perspectives  for  irrigation  (North,  Central,  and  Southern),  large  medium  and 
small in-stream storage for hydro, and also for mixed storage areas that integrate irrigation and 
water supply and tourism. The representative models should also include areas linked to high risk 
flood zones and to areas with limited flooding histories. 
21. 
The  modelling  will  need to develop  integrated flood  and  environmental flow  modelling 
within  an  overall  multi-sector  water  balance  models  that  should  include additional  options  that 
include climate change scenarios for both mid and late century based on the RCP 8.5 projections.  
22. 
Expected output include: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
Multiscale models for the use of land and water  
Modelling of the marginal value of water for non-agricultural use including hydro, 
tourism and urban/industrial use 
Representative  management  units  with  supporting  economic  and  water  balance 
modelling that indicate the marginal value of water with and without downs stream 
or cross sector impacts.  
5. 
Sector Options by Management Unit and  Inter-sector Trade-offs 
For  a  range  of  representative  management  units  that  will  provide  the  breadth  of 
23. 
information and understanding that will enable a Water Resource Master plan to be defined will 
be constructed based on Section 2 and 3 above. For each of these management until the water 
balance and interactions, economic and financial value of water and how these link to direct users, 
indirect  impacts  and  the  wider  economic  value  of  water  resources.  Within  each  type  of 
management unit a series of multisector scenarios will be developed and then modelled at both 
the sector and overall management unit.  
As  a  direct  of  result  of  these  scenarios  trade-offs  matrices  that  identify  positive  and 
24. 
negative interactions between sectors, between upper catchment and water users, and between 
storage and down-stream infrastructure and land uses will be defined. The scenarios will include 
trade-offs  between  the  sectors  and  provide  a  series  of  preferred  strategies  plus  the  likely 
distribution of costs and benefits.  
25. 
For each of the trade-off strategies addition investment or management options will be 
assessed  in  terms  of  economic  productivity  but  also  in  term  of  cost-effectiveness,  and  fiscal 
impacts and social cost benefit assessment.  
6. 
WRM Vision - Priority Actions and Targets actions and Investment 
 Based on the above the WRM program will develop provincial level consultations and 
26. 
from these consultations identify preferred priorities, targets and required actions, these will be 
consolidated  into  management  units  with  different  groups  of  stakeholders,  and  with  sector 
representatives. The range of preferences will be supported with an assessment of the trade-offs, 
extent of impacts and least cost options for reducing off site impacts, whilst maximizing the value 
of water resources. 
7 
27. 
It is expected that priority actions will be identified for agreed themes such as: 
Integrated flood management information systems 
(i) 
Revised institutional arrangements 
(ii) 
Catchment management strategies and targets 
(iii) 
Regional irrigation development and modernization 
(iv) 
Instream storage management and support strategies 
(v) 
(vi) 
Downstream flood protection – infrastructure and flood containment zones 
(vii)  Potential use of payment for ecological service models to support diffuse support 
for upstream water users to maintain forest or permanent vegetation cover 
28. 
The priority actions and targets will be used to prepare a consolidated WRM strategy and 
management  plan  with  supporting  actions  plans  for  management  units  and  water  uses  within 
these  units  these  will  be  sequenced  for  20  year  window  with  supporting  implementation 
responsibilities. 
7. 
WRM Investment Plans 
29. 
Each  mandated  agency  will  develop  a  5  and  10  year  investment  plan  based  on  the 
priority  actions  including  detailed  action  plans,  implementation  responsibilities  and  budget 
requirements.

ANNEX 15: WATER RESOURCE MASTER PLAN - TERMS OF REFERENCE  
A. 
Background and overview  
1. 
The preparation of a water resources management plan with supporting investment plan 
is  proposed.  The  proposal  for  this  initiative  includes  a  series  of  iterative  steps  some  of  which 
precede The SRIWSM implementation period.  
2. 
The first step has been the irrigation subsector review that is being implemented by IWMI 
under  contract  to  the  NRI-  AF  project  funded  by  ADB.  This  study  is  contracted  to  deliver  in 
December  2018  however  it  is  now  extended through  to  late  2019 and suffers from  substantial 
data gaps. During this period the MAF and DOI have formed working groups to start work on an 
irrigation  sector  strategy  that  was  intended  to  use  the  IWMI  output.  The  working  groups  have 
started to form a vision of an irrigation sector strategy but this remains a work in progress and 
risks  being  short  of  data  and  analytics  regarding  (i)  effectiveness  and  efficiency  within  the 
irrigation sector, (ii) the role of irrigation in the ongoing and accelerating rural transformation that 
is gathering momentum in Lao PDR, (iii) the operational incentives for innovation and efficiency, 
(iv) risks to water supplies resulting from competing uses, climate change impacts and the indirect 
impacts of watershed land use conversion of downstream water availability.  
3. 
During the preparation of SRIWSM the challenges to irrigation and the role of irrigation 
in future rural economic development were identified as substantial drivers with the wider problem 
and opportunities within the sector. Concurrently, the 2018 monsoon flood season highlighted the 
interactions  between  land  uses,  competing  water  use  flood  management  systems  and  costs, 
drought risks and challenges in high cost low efficiency irrigated agriculture. A significant concern 
was the significant cost of reparation and emergency relief as a result of both the monsoonal flood 
pulse and the additional pulse created from hydro-storage release along with the realization that 
with  increased  storage  coming  on-stream  that  such  risks  are  likely  to  increase  along  with  the 
associated costs.  
4. 
In response the Government of Lao PDR has indicated a need to adopt a wider multi-
sector approach to water resource management than the proposed irrigation sector strategy or 
master plan that had been planned. SRIWSM is proposing to provide support to the development 
of an informed and evidence-based national water resources management plan and associated 
multi-sector investment plan to implement the management plan.  
5. 
As a multisector initiative the endorsement of the wider programming is required from 
the National Assembly, and once obtained (planned for late 2019) the SRIWSM will resource the 
development of the master plan.  
B. 
National Assembly Concept Paper Purpose 
6. 
The preparation of a Concept Paper to the National Assembly on the need for improved 
water resource management for managing the cost of impacts from floods.  The purpose of the 
concept paper is to present to the national assembly information on the scale and impact of flood 
and water resource management impacts. The purpose being to obtain a directive from the NA 
for  the  development  of  a  multi-sector  approach  to  water  resource  management  that  includes 
agricultural  use,  hydro-storage  and  power  generation,  industrial  uses,  urban  demand  and 
environmental flows.  
2 
The paper seeks to present an overview of the nature and scale of trade-offs involved in 
7. 
the prioritization of alternative uses and management of water resources. These trade-offs include 
the  low  level  of  water  use  efficiency  within  the  predominant  use  of  available  water  for  current 
irrigation  systems,  the  interaction  of  watershed  land  use  and  catchment  discharge  rates,  the 
impact  of  incentives  for  maximizing  hydro-generation  versus  management  of  downstream 
impacts arising from flood induced storage release including the need (i) disaster and emergency 
responses  from  the  Government,  the  impact  on  social  and  economic  infrastructure  and  the 
incremental impact and costs of flood release on resilient flood protection infrastructure.  
8. 
The paper will present to the NA the (i) scope and (ii) impacts of floods within Lao, and 
(iii) show likely future scenarios that lead to the increased frequency, impact and costs of such 
flooding. The report seeks to obtain an NA mandate for the preparation of a multi-sector water 
resource management master plan that targets the contributing factors to increased flood impacts 
and costs and which will identify priority investment and management systems that reverse the 
trend of increasing costs of flooding. 
This paper will be issue – impact report that provides insight to the scale of the issue, the 
9. 
nature of floods and the range of contributing factors along with impacts, and potential trade-offs 
in the way water resources are managed – from upper catchment, to within catchment storage 
management, downstream flood protection including increasing the ability to live with floods. At 
this stage data sets will only be partial but need to evidence, to the extent possible, the issue of 
flooding and the costs for the Public Investment Budget going forward. 
The report to the National Assembly seeks: 
“to state the flooding problem or issue, the range of impacts and costs of such events, the 
contributing factors for increasing impacts and options or scenarios to manage the level of 
impacts using evidence from recent past events.” 
The report to the National Assembly should 
“ not mirror or represent itself to be a preliminary WRM Master Plan as it serves a different 
role that is to obtain a mandate for developing a multisector WRM Master Plan.”  
II. 
THE REPORT FOR THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY (NA REPORT) 
A. 
Objective  
10. 
The thesis is that the cost of flooding to the economy of Lao PDR to both private sector 
and  the  public  investment  budget  is  excessively  high  due  in  part  to  the  manner  in  which 
contributing  factors  are  managed.    Understanding  the  options  for  improved  multi-sector 
management  of  water  across  a  landscape  that  includes  both  upstream  and  downstream 
catchments  will  provide  the  basis  for  defining  the  trade-offs  that  can  then  inform  options  for 
reduced dependence on emergency and disaster response spending.  
The  NA  report  will  indicate  the  future  direction  of  impacts  due  to  changes  in  the 
11. 
contributing  factors  and  forces  behind  flooding  events  including:  catchment  deforestation, 
reservoir  management  (for  both  irrigation  and  hydro  objectives)    during  monsoon  and  high 
3 
intensity  rain  events,  the  impact  of  expected  climate  change,  and  the  nature  of  downstream 
development  i.e.,  the  trend  toward  increased  density  of  urban  living  and  the  manner  in  which 
economic and social infrastructure is developed in areas of high risk.  It also needs to present the 
institutional incentives that current contribute to increased flooding from across all sectors.  
12. 
It is proposed that the report will draw on data and information that is accessible to the 
preparation  team.  Some  of  this  needs  to  be  country  wide,  region  specific  but  there  will  be 
significant gaps. To provide a strong evidence base it is suggested to use the 2018 flood event 
from Nam Ngum and take components of the impacts to build a more detailed understanding of 
the multisector roles within the event.

2. 
Water Resource Issues and Success factors 
17. 
There are a number of critical issues that need to be understood and accounted for the 
future of a multisector water resource master plan. These include the development of scenario 
that address the risks, and opportunities relating to the following themes: 
(i) 
(ii) 
Establishing potential case study water resource management units  
Available water  resources  by management  unit, and region. What  is known and 
what is not 
(iii)  Water quality data about what is know and what is not 
(iv) 
(v) 
Pollution and pollution risks and the effects of these risks 
Climate  change  and  the  effect  of  all  projected  climate  variable  including 
temperature seasonal rainfall etc. 
3. 
Institutional arrangement study 
18. 
 The output will be a clear road map of current institutional arrangements (both de jure 
and  de  facto)  relating  to  water  users,  disaster  management  and  infrastructure  and  spatial 
planning. The study will conduct an institutional study for all the sectors and downs stream impacts 
linked  to  the  Water  Resource  Management  plan.  This  will  cover:  laws,  regulations  and  then 
planning and institutional mandate, jurisdiction, authority, roles and responsibilities through to the 
end users of water. 
4. 
Sector Performance and Impact Assessments 
19. 
A  key  aspect  is  to  understand  the  relative  value  of  water  and  water  resource 
infrastructure  between  sectors.  This  will  require  development  on  appropriate  models  through

28. 
The priority actions and targets will be used to prepare a consolidated WRM strategy and 
management  plan  with  supporting  actions  plans  for  management  units  and  water  uses  within 
these  units  these  will  be  sequenced  for  20  year  window  with  supporting  implementation

ANNEX 16: CATCHMENT AND LAND USE BEHAVIOR CHANGE STUDIES 
1. 
The catchments of Louangphabang and Xaignabouli province subprojects are both large 
and often involve a complex array of current land uses that are organized within equally complex 
land  use  arrangements  and  institutional  settings  that  are  both  formal  and  informal.  These 
complexities  add  significant  challenges  to  achieving  effective  land  use  change  and  provide 
challenges far more complex that being addressed through community based land use planning 
principles within the PLUP process.  
2. 
In Louangphabang and Xaignabouli  provinces these catchment issues are increasingly 
widespread  with  current  policy  and  regulatory  frameworks  seemingly  unable  to  address 
inappropriate  land  use  in  an  effective  manner.  The  SRIWSM  seeks  to  develop  a  deeper 
understanding  of  these  issues  with  the  purpose  of  informing  future  policy  and  investment 
decisions including the likely costs and trade-offs required to achieve more sustainable land use 
with sustainable ecologicla services.  
Two such catchments – Nam Nan in Louangphabang and Nam Poui in Xaignabouli will 
3. 
be part of land use research pilot studies. The project has budgeted for the two studies – to be 
either contracted collectively or individually with a total budget of $360,000.  
The purpose of these pilots will to understand the requirements of achieving a land use 
4. 
behavior  change  outcome  that  supports  the  long  term  sustainability  of  land  use  in  the  two 
catchments including:
