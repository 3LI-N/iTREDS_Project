Project Administration Manual Purpose and Process 
1.  The  project  administration  manual  (PAM)  describes  the  essential  administrative  and 
management requirements to implement the project on time, within budget, and in accordance 
with the policies and procedures of the government and Asian Development Bank (ADB). The 
PAM includes references to all available templates and instructions either through linkages to 
relevant URLs or directly incorporated in the PAM. 
2.   
3.  The Provincial People’s Committees (PPCs) of the four northeastern provinces1(NEPs) which 
are  the  executing  agencies  (EAs),  the  four  NEPs’  Provincial  Departments  of  Planning  and 
Investment  (DPIs)  which  are  the  implementing  agencies  (IAs)  or  project  owners,  and  the 
respective  Project  Management  Units  (PMUs)  under  the  IAs,  are  wholly  responsible  for  the 
implementation of the ADB-financed project, as agreed jointly between the borrower and ADB, 
and in accordance with the policies and procedures of the government and ADB. ADB staff is 
responsible for supporting implementation including compliance by PPCs and DPIs for the four 
NEP of their obligations and responsibilities for project implementation in accordance with ADB’s 
policies and procedures. 
4.   
5.  At loan negotiations, the borrower and ADB shall agree to the PAM and ensure consistency with 
the  financing  agreements.  Such  agreement  shall  be  reflected  in  the  minutes  of  the  loan 
negotiations.  In  the  event  of  any  discrepancy  or  contradiction  between  the  PAM  and  the 
financing agreements, the provisions of the financing agreements shall prevail. 
6.   
7.  After ADB Board approval of the project's report and recommendations of the President (RRP), 
changes in implementation arrangements are subject to agreement and approval pursuant to 
relevant government and ADB administrative procedures (including the Project Administration 
Instructions) and upon such approval, they will be subsequently incorporated in the PAM.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
1. 
The proposed project will (i) rehabilitate and upgrade about 265 kilometers of roads in the 
four northeastern provinces (NEPs); (ii) install 10 rural domestic water supply (RDWS) schemes; 
(iii) provide infrastructure support for agricultural and rural value chains (ARVC) in Lang Son; and 
(iv) strengthen provincial infrastructure asset management.2 
A. 
Impact and Outcome 
2. 
The project is aligned with the following impact: sub-regional competitiveness of the four 
northeastern  provinces  enhanced.3  The  project  will  have  the  following  outcome:  Production, 
service delivery, and movement of goods and passengers sustainably increased.4 
B. 
Outputs 
3. 
Output  1:  Road  network  connectivity  improved.  The  output  will  upgrade  about  121 
kilometers  of  provincial  and  about  144  kilometers  of  district  roads,  which  will  improve  overall 
network  efficiency  by  integrating  interprovincial  travel,  transport,  and  commerce,  as  well  as 
improve connectivity into border crossings. Many isolated, poor rural communities will access the 
transport network at lower cost, leading to social benefits. Reduced transport costs and improved 
rural  access  will  make  small  and medium  enterprises  (SMEs)  more  competitive,  and  enhance 
rural development initiatives. The improved network connectivity addresses significant barriers to 
the development of tourism circuits. Road safety will be included in subproject design, with 44 
traffic calming measures forcing reductions in vehicle speed, and 13 safety awareness trainings 
for  vulnerable road  users  such  as  school  children.  Output  1  will  benefit approximately  44 rural 
communities, comprising 160,000 people in 27,411 households. 
4. 
Output 2: Rural water supply improved. About ten RDWS subprojects will be designed 
and  constructed  to  meet  the  2030  forecasted  demand.  Clean  water  is  essential  for  (i)  public 
health,  which  is  particularly  important  for  communities  located  far  from  medical  facilities;  (ii) 
ARVCs,  as clean  water is  needed to  wash  produce,  and for creating  sanitary  conditions  at  an 
early  stage  of  value  addition  at  farm  and  aggregation  points;  and  (iii)  developing  facilities  to 
support  tourism.  Output  2  will  serve  22  communes,  comprising  42,300  people  in  10,000 
households by 2023. 
5. 
Output  3:  Agricultural  and  rural  value  chain  infrastructure  in  Lang  Son  province 
improved.  The  output  will  increase  the  viability  and  incomes  of  local  enterprises  and  rural 
producers  by  supplying  high-quality  food,  spices,  and  flowers  to  (i)  international  markets,  (ii) 
northern  Vietnamese  urban  centers,  and  (iii)  local  tourist  sites.  The  project  will  support 
horticultural  trade  and  marketing  organizations  and  services  for  at  least  five  horticultural 
commodities.  Apart  from  Lang  Son,  the  other  project  provinces  continue  to  benefit  from 
substantial 
for  ARVC 
development.  Based  on  successful  IFAD  experiences,  in  Lang  Son,  the  project  will  introduce 
market-based  business  plans,  provide  viability  gap  grants  to  at  least  30  existing  value  chain 
enterprises  to  leverage  investment  into  value-adding  technology  and  productive  infrastructure, 
and  support  80  producer  groups  for  investing  in  market-linked  quality  control,  production,  and 
for  Agricultural  Development  (IFAD)  support

post-harvest  infrastructure.  Better  transport  from  output  1  and  clean  water  from  output  2  will 
contribute essential support for competitive ARVCs in all of the provinces. Output 3 will benefit 
three communes comprising 10,400 people in 3,000 households 
Output  4:  Decentralized public  asset  management  processes  established.  ADB  is 
6. 
supporting the decentralized public asset management program. The provinces will procure asset 
management  hardware  and  systems,  and  carry  out  associated  staff  training.  The  systems  will 
include indicators and tools to allow monitoring of annual maintenance budgets and their funding, 
as  well  as  moving  to  life-cycle-based  investment  decisions  for  future  asset  procurement  and 
sustainability.

B. 
Project Coordination 
23. 
At the provincial level, the Project will operate under the oversight of a steering committee 
that will be under the chairmanship of the PPC and will have representation from (i) DPI, (ii) PMU 
Project  Director  and (iii) participation  from  other  agencies  such  as  DOT,  DARD,  DOLISA,  and 
DOIT. The Steering committee will review progress, proposed work plans, and provide direction 
and guidance in four NEP sub-regional policy and national program initiatives. 
24.  Coordination of work planning and reporting to ADB will be supervised by Lang 
Son Province which the government has delegated responsibility for overall project 
coordination. Each provincial PMU Project Director will conduct their own provincial 
level planning and biannual reviews and then use these as input to the overall project 
planning and review reports. The overall project plans and reviews will be developed in 
at least two meetings to be convened under the chairmanship of the Project Director 
(Lang Son). The preparation of consolidated annual work plan and biannual progress 
report will be supported by the coordination unit that operates out of the Lang Son PMU. 
The coordination unit will provide secretariat services to the PMUs on an as needed 
basis – see  
Figure 1 and will provide a contact point to ADB for day to day communication. 
25. 
All project management, administration, and procurement will be decentralized to each of 
the four NEP PMUs as per the directives of Decree16 with the approvals for procurement being 
at the PPC or delegated Project Owner (IA).

Subproject Implementation Procedures 
Subproject implementation (see Annex D for a detailed breakout of all steps involved in 
26. 
the implementation of subprojects (both representative and additional)) will include the following 
steps:  
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
(v) 
Preparation of feasibility and safeguard studies including IEEs, EMPs, REMDPs, 
GAP with a preliminary engineering design and supporting bill of quantities detailed 
cost estimate and financial (where required) and economic assessment; 
PMU conduct technical review and consultant updates; 
DPI submits to PPC the FS for approval; 
Implementation plan prepared; 
ADB conduct review of FS for ADB safeguard compliance, and adherence to the 
agreed upon FS structure;  
FS and supporting implementation plan submitted to PPC for approval; 
(vi) 
(vii)  DEDs contracted; 
(viii)  Preparation of DED; 
(ix) 
(x) 
(xi) 
(xii)  Commissioning, training and handover. 
Approval of DED by PPC after technical review; 
Tendering for civil works;  
Construction, including technical and safeguard supervision and monitoring; and 
FS for additional subprojects will be prepared by the consultants recruited by the PMUs. 
27. 
They shall be responsible for the technical aspects of the FS including the economic and financial 
analysis, all social and safeguard issues and land acquisition assessments required for preparing 
the  IEEs  as  required  and  where  appropriate  REMDPs,  GAP,  and  Poverty  and  Social 
Assessments, and inclusion of road safety and climate resilient measures. 
28. 
This will ensure that appropriate measures to (i) build and strengthen the inclusiveness of 
subprojects, and (ii) to mitigate any negative social impacts including special measures for land 
acquisition, compensation, ethnic minorities specific actions if required, and special measures to 
improve the participation of women and other disadvantaged groups as beneficiaries are taken.  
29. 
Each PMU upon completion of the FS, shall use the consultant services provided through 
the loan implementation consultant (LIC), recruited by each province using counterpart funds, to 
review the FS to ensure that: (i) appropriate technical standards are incorporated in the design 
and that costs to be applied reflect realistic market estimates; and (ii) ADB’s and the Government’s 
23 
social and environmental safeguards requirements are duly addressed. Once approved, the PMU 
will inform the project owner DPI of the feasibility's acceptance. DPI will then submit the accepted 
FS to the PPC for approval. ADB will review FS and associated documents on request. Ultimate 
responsibly for FS compliance rests with each EA. 
30. 
All additional subproject FS for plain, rural, and mountainous roads will include a traffic 
forecast  derived  from  traffic  counts  of  baseline  traffic  demand.  The  traffic  forecasts  will  be 
presented  in the  summary  of  each  feasibility  study  for  the  economic  life  of  the  proposed road 
investment. The technical design standard for the road engineering must be consistent with the 
assessed traffic demand - specified in daily Passenger Car Unit terms according to the Viet Nam 
Design Specification TCVN 4054 – see table 4.   
31.  Where  the  road  traffic  forecast  spans  more  than  one  Passenger  Car  Unit  category  the 
standard  to  be  applied  will  be  based  on  the  design  category  that  is  consistent  with  the  traffic 
forecast  at  year  10  of  the  projection.    Where  the  indicated  design  category  differs  from  the 
Provincial master plan or the proposed subproject design standard indicated in the Government 
Investment  Proposal  (IP)  the  PMU/PPC  will  confirm  the  design  standard  to  be  used  as  the 
standard indicated by the traffic forecast under regulation TCVN 4054. 
32. 
The economic assessment of the subproject must utilize the same traffic forecast data to 
ensure  capital  investment  costs  are  consistent  with  the  expected  benefit  streams.  This 
requirement will remove bias of inflated Economic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR) estimates from 
the use of a higher traffic forecast, or alternately, applying a capital investment that is insufficient 
to  construct  the  category  of  road  required  by  the  traffic  forecast  and  the  estimated  project 
economic benefits.

33. 
ADB will confirm with a formal note to file for each subproject feasibility study that the road 
subproject  feasibility  assessment  has  a  traffic  forecast  that  is  consistent  with  the  proposed 
construction design category, and the projected traffic benefits used in the economic assessment.  
34.  Where  there  is  any  inconsistency,  the  ADB  will  notify  the  PMU/DPI  that  the  subproject 
feasibility is not accepted and the subproject is ineligible for ADB financing. 
In  the  event  a  subproject  does  not  meet  the  required  level  of  feasibility  and  eligibility

criteria,  a  new  subproject  may  be  proposed  by  the  EA  and  included  in  the  project  with  the 
concurrence of ADB.

FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT 
A. 
Financial Management Assessment 
The overall FMA is presented in the context of ADB’s sector modality for the BIIG1 project. 
57. 
The financial assessment uses the detail of representative subproject feasibility8 as well as the 
proposed financial structure and management of the overall project. 
The main financial management risks that need to be managed by the EAs, IAs, and PMUs 
58. 
are:  (i)  implementation  risk  -  lack  of  familiarity  with  ADB  sector  project  subproject  processing

B. 
Risk Analysis 
61. 
The  risk  assessment  considered  the  staffing,  internal  control,  accounting  and reporting 
policies and procedures, and auditing standards and arrangements of the EA and IAs. Based on 
the assessment, the overall project financial management pre-mitigation risk is high. 
1. 
Inherent Risk 
62. 
Inherent risk is the susceptibility of the project financial management system to factors 
arising from the environment in which it operates, such as country rules and regulations and 
58 
project  management entities  and  the  political  economy  of their  working environment. Table 45 
presents an overall inherent risk summary.

Project financial management policies and procedures are in 
place for DPI budget and financial accounting systems.  
Each  of  the  project  IAs  will  adopt  the  generally  accepted 
accounting principles as specified by the Ministry of Finance. 
The IA PMUs will set up a separate project accounting system 
within three months after loan effectiveness and each IAs will 
submit a copy of these to ADB financial management expert 
in VRM. 
ADB  loan  is  on-lent  to  each  EA.  Each  EA  will  repay  the 
portion  made  available  to  it  through  budget  allocation  whilst 
the  State  will  repay  the  portion  made  available  to  the  EAs 
under respective on-lending agreements. The loan will have a 
repayment period  of 25  years, including a  grace period of 5 
years  and  the  EAs  will  assume  the  foreign  exchange  and 
interest rate variation risks. Each PMU will open an advance 
account  to  manage  the  loan  proceeds  in  line  with  the 
requirements in the Loan Agreement. Timely release of loan 
proceeds  to  each  province  will  be  required  through  loan 
covenant. 
Counterpart funds need to be mobilised from the PPC with 
a  front-loaded  cash-flow  that  may  delay  implementation 
consultant support. 
PMU staffing is currently unknown as PMU establishment can 
be up to 30 days after loan signing. Staffing is proposed as a 
mix  of  existing  government  civil  servants  with  lifetime 
employment  and  adequately  qualified  and  contracted  staff 
positions  that  are  yet  to  be  filled  using  project  counterpart 
funding. No province has experience in acting as a loan EA 
and  therefore  the  lack  previous  experience  in  financial 
management, familiarity with ADB loan management policies 
and  procedures,  and  training  on  ADB  loan  management 
policies and procedures including procurement, disbursement 
and  repayment  policy  need  to  be  provided  to  enhance  the 
professional capacity of relevant staff before implementing the 
project.  Contracted  staff  and

required  within  the  project  implementation  process  was  identified  as  varying  by  province.  The 
exact extent required is difficult to determine when not all PMUs are in place and the respective 
staff  not  engaged.  An  initial  part  of  capacity  building  under  the  project  is  a  Training  Needs 
Assessment (TNA) from which a training plan could be developed. The TNA would be directed at 
DOF and PMUs as well as for recipient line ministries. The initial training and capacity building

Fund Flow Mechanism 
65. 
The GOV is the borrower of the ADB loan for financing the Basic Infrastructure for Inclusive 
Growth  in  the  Northeastern  Provinces  Sector  Project.  On  behalf  of  the  borrower,  Ministry  of 
Finance (MOF) will relend a portion of the proceeds of the loan to the four Executing Agencies 
being Bac Kan PPC, Cao Bang PPC, Ha Giang PPC, and Lang Son PPC while the balance will 
be  made  available  to  the  EAs  through  budget  allocation.  The  repayment  period  is  25  years, 
including a grace period of 5 years.  
66. 
Each PMU will open an advance account to manage the loan proceeds in line with the 
requirements  in the  Loan Agreement.  For  Lang Son  province,  a  subaccount  will  be  opened to 
support the operation of the ARVC output. 
D. 
Personnel 
67. 
The financial staff of EA and IAs are a mix of government civil servants seconded to the 
PMU and contracted staff to ensure the correct experience and range of skills are available during 
implementation. It is expected that staff will need training to familiarize with ADB project-related 
disbursement guidelines and procedures, project accounting requirements, project and contract 
management, financial monitoring  and  report  preparation.  Additionally,  somebody  with English 
capability  will  be  needed  to  support the finance  teams,  especially  at  the early  stage  of  project 
implementation.  Key  risks  relate  to  the  timing  of  the  formation  of  the  final  PMUs  and  the 
subsequent staffing of these. The PMUs can legally be formed up to 30 days after loan signing 
62 
with individual staff positions filled at this time. Currently, (i) positions within the PMU are proposed 
positions  only,  (ii)  positions within the  proposed PMU  are  indicated to  be  either  seconded  DPI 
staff or contracted positions however this may change on the formal establishment of the PMUs, 
(iii)  the  individuals  to  fill  positions  are  unknown  and  as  such  the  capability  of  staff  is  largely 
unknowable, (iv) the EAs and Project Owners may choose to modify the structures and also the 
nature of each position resulting in fewer full time contracted positions that are substituted for part 
time DPI seconded staff. The experience in Viet Nam PMU operation is that without full time staff 
PMU and project performance is significantly and adversely affected.

procedures  is  available.9  Project  staff  are  expected  to  complete  this  training  to  help  ensure 
efficient disbursement and fiduciary control. 
69. 
Advance fund procedure. 4 advance accounts (one for each EA) will be established at 
a commercial bank nominated by SBV and acceptable to ADB and maintained by each Project 
Owner as assigned by each PPC (EA). The Project Owner (IA) will be the DPI who will form a 
PMU  that  will  in  turn  establish  the  provincial  advance  account.  The  currency  of  the  advance 
accounts  is  USD.  The  advance  account  is  to  be  used  exclusively  for  ADB’s  share  of  eligible 
expenditures. The Project Owner on behalf of the PPC that established the advance account in 
its name is accountable and responsible for proper use of advances to the advance account.  
70. 
The total outstanding advance to the advance accounts should not exceed the estimate 
of  ADB’s  share of  expenditures to  be  paid through  the  advance  account for  the forthcoming  6 
months. The DPI/PMU on behalf of the PPC may request for initial and additional advances to 
the  advance  accounts  based  on  an  Estimate  of  Expenditure  Sheet  setting  out  the  estimated 
expenditures  to  be  financed  through  the  accounts  for  the  forthcoming  6  months.10  Supporting 
documents should be submitted to ADB or retained by the EAs and IAs in accordance with ADB’s 
Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  when  liquidating  or 
replenishing the advance accounts. 
Statement of expenditure procedure.11The SOE procedure is applied for items up to a

ceiling of $100,000. All supporting documents and records for the expenditures claimed under the 
SOE  should  be maintained and made readily  available for review  by  ADB's  disbursement  and 
review  missions,  upon  ADB's  request  for  submission  of  supporting  documents  on  a  sampling 
basis, and for independent audit. Original documentation will be kept by the respective provincial 
PMUs while a copy of all documentation will be archived by the coordination unit within the lead 
province of Lang Son.

person.  The  minimum  value  per  withdrawal  application  is  set  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  Loan 
Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time). Individual payments below this 
amount  should  be  paid  (i)  by  respective  DPI  and  subsequently  claimed  to  ADB  through 
reimbursement, or (ii) through the advance fund procedure, unless otherwise accepted by ADB.  
73. 
No withdrawals shall be made from the Loan Account for a particular project province until 
the respective on-lending Agreement, in form and substance satisfactory to ADB, has been duly 
authorized  by,  and  executed  and  delivered  on  behalf  of,  the  Borrower  (or  its  authorized 
government entity) and the concerned Project Province, and is legally binding upon the parties 
thereto in accordance with its terms12. 
F. 
Accounting and Financial Reporting 
74. 
Each  IA/PMU  will  adopt  accounting  methods  required  by  MOF  to  establish  separate 
project  accounts  and  records  by  funding  source  for  all  expenditures  incurred  on  the  project. 
Subsidiary ledgers will be maintained to facilitate reconciliation of accounts with the general ledger 
and  bank records.  All reports  and  supporting  documents  on  all  transactions  will  be  stored  and 
retained on a semi-permanent basis and will be accessible by authorized users, and are available 
for audit inspection. The IA will prepare individual project financial statements and submit to the 
EA for monitoring and each EA will submit their accounting records to the ADB via the Project 
Coordination Unit in Lang Son for consolidation and reporting. 
75. 
The EAs through the IAs/PMUs will maintain, or cause to be maintained, separate books 
and records by funding source for all expenditures incurred on the project. Annual project financial 
statements will be prepared following modified cash-based accounting system in accordance with 
the  government's  accounting  laws  and  regulations,  specifically  Circular  No.195/2012/TT-BTC 
under the Vietnamese Accounting Standards (VAS).  
76. 
Financial reporting follows the recent State Budget Law which covers the responsibilities 
including the duties of state agencies, revenue sources and spending authority, preparation of 
budget  estimates,  and  on  budgetary  execution,  along  with  details  on  accounting,  auditing  and 
disclosure requirements. 
G. 
Budgeting System 
77. 
The  financial  departments  of  EA  and  IAs  are  in  charge  of  summarizing  the  preliminary 
budgets and make an overall annual budget for approval by the Project Owner on behalf of the 
EA (the respective PPC).  
78. 
Detailed  project  budgets  will  be  formulated  by  each  PMU  under  the  oversight  of  the 
financial  management  team,  with  input  from  the  procurement  expert,  technical  staff  with  input 
from  relevant  departments  but the  accounting staff  needs to make  sure the  costs  are  incurred 
within the budget. The project budgets will be prepared annually by each IA and their PMU based 
on the work planning templates provided in the PAM and will include physical and financial targets. 
79. 
Prior  to  loan  effectiveness  -  a  whole  of  life  project  work  plan  will  be  prepared  with  a 
supporting budget by project output, subproject, expenditure items, and disbursement category. 
This  work  plan  and  supporting  budget  will  be  continually  applied  for  ongoing  planning  and 
12 Disbursement conditions for specific category/subcategory are set out in the Loan Agreement.

reporting  by  the  PMU  and  monitoring  by  each  IA.  Budget  monitoring  reports  will  present  a 
comparison  between  budgeted  and  actual  amounts,  and  highlight  budget  variances  with  each 
PMU  Project  Director  responsible  for  identifying  and  auctioning  remedial  actions  to  recover  or 
reschedule activities that are delayed or incomplete. The Project Coordination Unit within Lang 
Son  Province  PMU  will  provide  the  consolidation of  planning,  budgeting and  progress  records 
across all four EAs and report this to ADB. 
H. 
Safeguard of Assets 
80. 
Subsidiary records of fixed assets and stocks are currently considered to be well managed 
and kept up-to-date and reconciled with control accounts of the IA periodically. The EA and IAs 
will conduct annual physical inventory of all project assets and all subproject assets will remain 
on  the  PMU  registry  until  formally  handed  over  to  asset  managers  on  completion.  During  the 
construction  insurance,  shall  be  the  responsibility  of  contractors  and  shall  cover  worker 
compensation for losses due to accidents apart from compensation for property. 
I. 
Auditing and Public Disclosure 
81. 
The Government of Viet Nam has its internal audit system that each EAs and their IAs 
currently implement. The standards of internal audit are less than international standards creating 
a degree of risk that inappropriate use of resources may not be identified. The Consultant has 
discussed these risks with the Project Owners/IA and how internal auditing can play a constructive 
role  in  assuring  normal  financial  management  procedures  and  policies  to  the  Project.  The 
weakness and associated risks are systemic and without confirmed staff in positions the issue 
requires ongoing monitoring. The use of independent external audit seeks to offset the weakness 
of internal controls if the scope of the external audit includes the confirmation of details recorded 
for transactions as opposed to be limited to the confirmation of a transaction paper trail. 
Each  of  the  PPCs  through  the  IAs/PMUs  will  cause  its  own  detailed  project  financial 
82. 
statements  to  be  audited  in  accordance  with  International  Standards  on  Auditing  by  an 
independent auditor acceptable to ADB. The audited project financial statements together with 
the auditor’s opinion and management letter will be presented in the English language to ADB 
within 6 months from the end of the fiscal year by the PPCs through the DPI/PMUs. 
83. 
The audit report for the project financial statements will include a management letter and 
auditor’s opinions, which cover (i) whether the project financial statements present an accurate 
and fair view or are presented fairly, in all material respects, in accordance with the applicable 
financial  reporting  standards;  (ii)  whether  the  proceeds  of  the  loan  were  used  only  for  the 
purpose(s) of the project; and (iii) whether the borrower or executing agency was in compliance 
with the financial covenants contained in the legal agreements (where applicable). 
84. 
Compliance with financial reporting and auditing requirements will be monitored by review 
missions and during normal program supervision, and followed up regularly with all concerned.  
The government, the four NEP PPCs and DPI/PMU’s have been made aware of ADB’s 
85. 
approach to delayed submission, and the requirements for satisfactory and acceptable quality of 
the  audited  project  financial  statements13.  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  require  a  change  in  the

auditor (in a manner consistent with the constitution of the borrower), or for additional support to 
be provided to the auditor, if the audits required are not conducted in a manner satisfactory to 
ADB,  or  if  the  audits  are  substantially  delayed.  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  verify  the  project's 
financial accounts to confirm that the share of ADB’s financing is used in accordance with ADB’s 
policies and procedures.  
86. 
Public disclosure of the audited project financial statements, including the auditor’s opinion 
on the project financial statements, will be guided by ADB’s Public Communications Policy 2011.14  
After the review, ADB will disclose the audited project financial statements and the opinion of the 
auditors on the project financial statements no later than 14 days of ADB’s confirmation of their 
acceptability  by  posting  them  on  ADB’s  website.  The  management  letter,  additional  auditor’s 
opinions will not be disclosed.15 
J. 
Reporting and Monitoring 
87. 
The  project  financial  reports  will  be  prepared  using  existing  Public-Sector  budget 
accounting software systems and are submitted on a monthly, quarterly and annual basis. The 
reports  will  highlight  the  physical  and  financial  progress  of  subprojects  being  undertaken  in 
comparison  with  the  proposed  annual  work  plan  and  budgets  established  prior  to  end  of  the 
previous  year.  Reports  will  be  produced  for  each  subproject,  each  IA/EA  and  for  the  overall 
project.  During project implementation, financial reports will be prepared and submitted to the 
DPI and the PPC of each province and to ADB as quarterly progress reports for individual outputs. 
The financial report will be used for monitoring progress of project implementation and compare 
actual  expenditure  with  budgeted  and  programmed  allocations.  The  Project  Coordination  Unit 
Lang Son will consolidate each EA reports into a project level report, however it should be noted 
to avoid cash flow constraints and delays, each EA will submit their financial and procurement 
approval requests and their financial withdrawal applications direct to ADB with the record of these 
shared  with  the  coordination  unit.  As  such,  the  coordination  unit  will  not  be  involved  with  the 
presentation of procurement approvals, or withdrawal applications to ADB they will however be 
copied on all records so that a consolidated Project level record is established and maintained. 
K. 
Information Systems 
88. 
A computerized accounting system will be used by each PMU for the accounting records, 
payment financial statement including balance sheet, income statement and cash flow statement. 
The financial reports are generated by the computer system rather than by manual. The financial 
data  and  the  operational  information  have  not  been  inter-connected  in  the  system,  and 
reconciliations are realized by regular manual checks. 
(i)  When audited project financial statements are not received by the due date, ADB will write to the executing 
agency advising that (a) the audit documents are overdue; and (b) if they are not received within the next 6 
months, requests for new contract awards and disbursement such as new replenishment of advance accounts, 
processing of new reimbursement, and issuance of new commitment letters will not be processed. 
(ii)  When  audited  project  financial  statements  are  not  received  within  6  months  after  the  due  date,  ADB  will 
withhold processing of requests for new contract awards and disbursement such as new replenishment of 
advance accounts, processing of new reimbursement and issuance of new commitment letters. ADB will (a) 
inform the executing agency of ADB’s actions; and (b) advise that the loan may be suspended if the audit 
documents are not received within the next 6 months. 
(iii)  When audited project financial  statements are not received within 12 months after the due date, ADB may 
suspend the loan.

A key source of information will be the ADB VRM project administration workbooks that 
provide subproject and overall project level work plans, budgets, monthly cash flow projections 
and records, contract award schedules and disbursement projections. The workbooks will form 
the  basis  of  a  Provincial  level  PPMS  that  will  interface  with  the  project  accounting  systems  to 
report physical and financial progress against agreed quarterly reporting indicators.  
90. 
Existing accounting software systems of the EAs and IAs are sufficient for supporting the 
project  information  system  and  for  generating  project  reports  required  for  both  external  and 
internal  use.  In  addition,  all  current  staff  in  the  IAs  are  familiar  with  these  systems,  although 
supplementary training in reporting requirements for the ADB financed project will be provided 
and is available on-line as e-learning courses. Systems and procedures for regular back-ups of 
all accounting systems and appropriate security measures of backed-up data are in place.

Environment 
VII. 
SAFEGUARDS 
101.  The  overall  project  is  classified  as  Category  B  for  environment  and  all  subproject  are 
required  to  be  category  B  or  below.  The  civil  works  associated  with  the  road  subprojects  are 
limited  to  upgrading  that  involve  civil  works  within  existing  right-of-way  (ROW)  or  newly 
established  ROW.  The  environmental  impacts  that  will  result  from  this  are  limited  to  the 
construction phase; all impacts will be temporary in nature, with no residual long-term impacts. 
For  the rural  water  supply  schemes  and the  strengthening  of agricultural  value  chains  in  Lang 
Son  Province.  The  project  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework  (EARF)  and 
initial environment examinations (IEEs) including environmental management plans (EMP) have 
been  prepared  for  the  representative  subprojects  including  four  roads  and  three  water  supply 
schemes in Bac Kan, Cao Bang, Ha Giang and Lang Son, and agricultural and rural value chains 
in Lang Son, and will be updated and approved by ADB to reflect any changes in the subproject 
during detail design. These documents will be uploaded on the ADB website before ADB staff 
review meeting (SRM). 
102.  The processing of additional subprojects will include an initial environmental examination 
during the feasibility  stage  to  be  contracted  and  completed  by  the  EAs and IAs. These  will  be 
guided  by  the  EARF  and  are  expected  to  be  completed  prior  to  loan  signing  and  or  loan 
effectiveness. Further the detailed engineering design consultant will also be required to provide 
environmental safeguard input to the design process. The approved EMP will be integrated in the 
bidding and civil contract documents. Site EMP in detailing mitigation measure implementation in 
each construction package will be prepared by respective contractor and submitted to PMU for 
review.  Each  Province  has  committed  counterpart  funding  for  the  implementation  of  the 
environmental safeguards identified for the representative subprojects and indicative budgets for 
the additional subprojects.  
103.  Each PMU will have an environmental safeguards staff person/focal point who will also be 
assisted  by  an  environmental  safeguards  consultant  who  is  intermittent  within  the  loan 
implementation consultant team. Further the detailed engineering design consultants will also be 
required to provide environmental safeguard input to the design process. The PMU environment 
safeguards staff will work closely with environment consultants that form part of the successful 
detailed engineering design team, and the environmental consultant in the loan implementation 
consultant team, as well construction supervision consultants for supporting each PMU to assess, 
monitor  and  supervise  the  EMP  implementation,  and  ensure  environment  compliance  in  each 
subproject.  Semiannual  environment  monitoring  report,  during  construction  phase,  will  be 
prepared and submitted by PMU to ADB for review and uploading on ADB’s website. 
B. 
Involuntary Resettlement 
104.  The  overall  project  is  classified  as  Category  B  for  involuntary  resettlement.  The 
developments  and  improvements  under  the  subprojects  will  not  trigger  major  resettlement 
impacts because most of the infrastructure will be improved within existing ROWs. An assessment 
and  full  census  of  impacted  households  along  the  length  of  the  subproject  right  of  way  was 
conducted, based on the center-line and preliminary designs for the representative roads, and a 
resettlement framework and resettlement plans were prepared in accordance with national legal 
requirements and ADB’s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). 
105.  There were no subprojects with significant involuntary resettlement (IR Cat A) impacts. As 
71 
a result, primary points of concern will be minor land acquisition and compensation for roadside 
trees, crops, or small structures that may be affected within the ROW. The PPCs and ADB have 
agreed on a combined resettlement and ethnic minorities development framework (REMDF). 
Minor  land  acquisition,  compensation,  allowances,  operation  and  administration,  surveys, 
monitoring,  and  reporting  will  be  financed  from  government  counterpart  funds.  The  internal 
monitor will ensure that the resettlement process and impacts is evaluated properly and reported 
to ADB semi-annually through the EAs. 
106.  Public consultation and information disclosure was undertaken during the preparation of 
resettlement and ethnic minorities development plans (REMDP), including affected persons 
and the public associated with the representative subprojects. The consultation and information-
sharing process will be continued throughout project implementation. The main features of the 
resettlement  concerns-project  impacts,  asset  valuation,  entitlements,  and  compensation 
provisions-were disclosed to project-affected people during consultative meetings. 
107.  The REMDF has been prepared and will be implemented by the PMUs’ who have a social 
and resettlement staff positions for social safeguard. For the processing of subprojects, both the 
FS and Detailed Designs will be supported by the requirement for a REMDP and social safeguard 
input to the detailed design processes. Additional budgets have been included in the Government 
counterpart contribution for the implementation the requirements of the REMDF.  
108.  For Output 1 road subprojects and Output 2 water supply subproject the following applies 
for the representative subprojects (4 road, and 3 water supply) the following has been prepared: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
(v) 
Engineering preliminary designs established the center lines and right of way for 
all  roads and the  alignment  of  all  intakes,  pumping  and treatment  stations  and 
distribution network for the water supply schemes; 
Based on the engineering survey and cadastral data surveys were conducted to 
enable the quantification of resettlement impacts and baseline data for the draft 
REMDPs. They include the inventory of losses to estimate resettlement impacts 
and  a  socioeconomic  survey  to  assess  pre-project  living  standards  of  affected 
households  as  well  as  likely  social  impacts  resulting  from  land  acquisition  on 
them; 
Public consultations with stakeholders comprising of government entities, private 
sector interests and affected households. Meaningful consultations will continue 
during the updating and implementation of the REMDPs during and on completion 
of the detailed designs and their approval. The draft and updated REMDPs have 
been  disclosed  to  affected  households  and  their  communities  based  on  the 
preliminary feasibility design documents; 
The  final  REMDPs  for  all  representative  subprojects  are  subject  to  disclosure 
prior to project approval of the detailed designs. The fundamental objective of the 
project resettlement policy is to replace and compensate lost assets based on the 
principle of replacement cost. Compensation and various forms of assistance will 
be provided. Once land acquisition is completed, income restoration measures 
will be implemented in a way that will ensure that standards of living of the project 
affected persons are at least restored to their pre-project levels, and that those in 
the  category  of  vulnerable  groups  (i.e.,  poor  households.)  are  assisted  to  help 
improve their socio-economic status; 
The REMDPs will be updated upon loan effectiveness, endorsed by the EAs and 
submitted  to  the  ADB  for  review  and  concurrence.  The  updated  REMDPs  will 
72 
(vi) 
require  further  detailed  studies  (including  detailed  measurement  survey  and 
replacement  cost  survey)  and  additional  consultation.  Principal  aspects  to  be 
updated  in  the  REMDPs  are  resettlement  impacts  based  on  DMS;  census  of 
affected  people;  entitlement  matrix;  and  replacement  costs  and  details  of 
consultations and disclosure; and 
The  PMUs  and/or  Center 
the 
wards/communes,  and  relevant  mass  organizations  (particularly  the  Vietnam 
Women’s  Union  (VWUs))  will  have  primary  responsibility  for  the  updating  and 
implementation of the REMDPs with the support of the consultant. As such the 
capacity  of  these  bodies  is  of  critical  importance  and  the  project  must  ensure 
appropriate capacity building assistance in the form of information, training, and 
consultation and mentoring. 
for  Land  Fund  Development 
(CLFD), 
109.  For  Output  3:  initial  REMDP  and  IEEs  have  been  prepared.  The  implementation 
arrangement of the output 3 is based on the award of grants to applicants. These applicants will 
be either enterprises who will be submitting an investment proposal with supporting business plan 
or producer groups that will be submitting an investment plan with supporting business case. Both 
groups  will  need  to  submit  clear  safeguards  provisions  in  accordance  with  the  EARF  and 
REMDPF for which support will be provided through the service provider to be contracted and 
through the LIC and PMU staff. 
110.  The EAs/IAs and the PMUs will ensure that any involuntary resettlement is carried out in 
accordance  with  the  agreed  REMDPs,  ADB’s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  and  the 
Vietnamese laws and regulations on involuntary resettlement. In case of discrepancies between 
the  government’s  laws,  regulations,  and  procedures,  and  ADB’s  Safeguards  Policy  Statement 
(2009), ADB’ Safeguards Policy Statement will apply. 
111.  The EAs/IAs and the PMUs will ensure that the REMDPs agreed between the EAs and 
ADB will be updated following completion of detailed designs based on detailed measurement 
survey;  census  of  affected  people;  entitlement  matrix;  replacement  costs  and  details  of 
consultations and will be submitted to ADB for review and concurrence before awarding bid of 
civil works. 
112.  The EA will engage the services of a qualified appraiser to carry out the replacement cost 
survey for land and non-land assets, and submit the replacement cost survey report to the PPCs 
and PMUs for review and approval. 
113.  The  PMUs,  the  wards/communes  and  relevant  mass  organizations  (particularly  the 
VWUs) will have primary responsibility for the updating and implementation of the REMDPs with 
the support of the Loan Implementation Consultant.  
114.  The  EAs/IAS  and the  PMUs  shall  ensure  that  a  site  possession  notice to  a  civil  works 
contract  to  commence construction  activities for a specific  section  or  subproject  is  issued  only 
when the resettlement specialist of the PMU has officially confirmed in writing that (i) payment 
has been fully disbursed to the displaced persons and rehabilitation measures are in place for 
that  specific  section  as  per  updated  REMDPs  agreed  between  the  EAs  and  ADB;  (ii)  already 
compensated APs for that specific section have been cleared the area in a timely manner; and 
(iii) that the specific section is free from any encumbrances. 
115.  The  EAs  shall  timely  and  sufficiently  provide  counterpart  funds  for  land  acquisition, 
resettlement  and  monitoring  activities  specified  in  the  agreed  REMDPs,  and  will  meet  any 
73 
unforeseen obligations in excess of the REMDPs budget estimate in order to satisfy resettlement 
objectives. 
116.  PMUs  are  responsible for  internal  monitoring  with  assistance from the  LICs.  PMUs  will 
submit semi-annual internal monitoring reports to ADB. Final monitoring and evaluation need to 
be  conducted  after  completion  of  all  land  acquisition  activities  every  6  months  to  assess  (i) 
achievement of land acquisition objectives; (ii) changes in living standards and livelihoods; (iii) 
restoration  of  the  economic  and  social  base  of  the  affected  people;  (iv)  effectiveness  and 
sustainability of entitlements; and (v) the need for further support as required. Findings monitoring 
reports will be submitted to ADB and PMU. External resettlement agency is not required for this 
project because of insignificant impact on land acquisition. 
C. 
Indigenous peoples 
117.  ADB’s  Indigenous  People’s  policy  requires that  under  an ADB  loan, the  borrower/client 
will undertake meaningful consultation with affected Indigenous Peoples, herein referred to in the 
Vietnamese context as “Ethnic Minorities” to ensure their informed participation in (i) designing, 
implementing, and monitoring measures to avoid adverse impacts on them or, when avoidance 
is not possible, to minimize, mitigate, and compensate for such effects; and (ii) tailoring project 
benefits that accrue to them in a culturally appropriate manner. Consultation will be carried out in 
a  manner  commensurate  with  the  impacts  on  affected  communities.  The  consultation  process 
and its results are documented and reflected in the REMDF. 
118.  The overall project is classified as Category B for Ethnic Minorities and all representative 
and additional subprojects must be Category B. Since, in many cases, ethnic minorities form the 
overwhelming  majority  of  the  population  of  road  subproject  areas  and  since  the  project  is 
designed to  provide  positive  impacts  for  these  groups,  measures  to  mitigate  negative  impacts 
have been incorporated in the subproject REMDPs and the procedures within the REMDF that 
the PMUs apply in the processing of additional subprojects. 
119. 
Impacts  on  ethnic  minorities  in  the  project  areas  are  overwhelmingly  positive  since  the 
subprojects will be aimed at the overall economic and social improvement of the total population. 
The  project  will  not  cause  physical  displacement  from  traditional  or  customary  lands,  nor 
negatively  impact  the  identity,  culture,  or  customary  livelihood  system  of  ethnic  minorities. 
REMDPs will ensure the inclusion of ethnic minorities and their access to project benefits. The 
REMDP  also  includes  mitigation  measures  to  address  impacts  on  ethnic  minorities,  an 
institutional  capacity  development  program,  a  grievance  redress  mechanism,  and  compliance 
with ADB information disclosure and consultation requirements. Output 3, agricultural value chain 
subprojects are assessed as category C for involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. 
Internal monitoring and progress reporting will be the responsibility of the PMUs. At the 
120. 
local level, the CSB will monitor on a regular basis.  
121.  Prohibited  investment  activities.  Pursuant  to  ADB’s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement 
(2009),  ADB  funds  may  not  be  applied  to  the  activities  described  on  the  ADB  Prohibited 
Investment Activities List set forth at Appendix 5 of the Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). 
D. 
Road Safety Dimensions 
1. 
Road Safety Objectives and Strategy 
74 
122.  The improvements in subproject roads to a smoother riding road quality may encourage 
higher speeds, that may in turn increase rate and severity of crashes on these roads. In some 
rural areas, the paved roads may also change the road environment, as all vulnerable road users 
feel less safe with increased traffic speeds. For all subprojects, road safety assessments will be 
made to minimize rate/severity of crashes over the long-term and to demonstrate good practice 
road safety interventions to the PMU. 
2. 
Road Safety Action Plan (RSAP) 
123.  Technical experts from the ADB will provide the following support to improve road safety 
related to the Output 1 subproject investments:  
(i) 
will  hold  training  sessions  in  each  of  the  NEP  provinces  on  incorporating  road 
safety measures into subproject detailed engineering designs, including how to cost such 
measures. The trainees will include PMU road staff and local design consultants; 
(ii) 
upon request, will review road subproject detailed engineering designs. 
124.  The PMUs will work with the Provincial and District Road Safety Committees and related 
entities  at  the  Commune  levels  to  coordinate  and  implement  associated  capacity  building 
activities and to raise local awareness of road safety issues due to road improvements in their 
communities.  Implementation  of  the  RSAP  will  be  overseen  by  the  PMUs.  Budget  for  all  non-
engineering road safety activities will be through counterpart funding. 
125.  All roads will at a minimum have appropriate traffic calming and control measures at all 
schools  and  kindergartens,  health  clinics  and  hospitals,  market  and  high  intensity  traffic  areas 
and administrative centers. 
75 
VIII.  GENDER AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS 
A. 
Gender Objectives and Strategy 
126.  The project is classified as Effective Gender Mainstreaming (EGM). The objective of the 
GAP is to reduce inequalities between women and men associated with access to benefits and 
opportunities and social risks such as exposure to disease and road safety.  A gender analysis 
revealed that women have fewer opportunities than men to participate in public decision making, 
and less access to information, training, and employment, especially during the low agricultural 
season. The agricultural value chain subprojects and enterprise values subprojects, are likely to 
enable women to participate and benefit in the improved economic opportunities associated with 
agriculture value chains and the road connections to markets. The design features of the GAP 
are (i) promotion of equality of project benefits and opportunity-sharing between men and women; 
(ii) reduction in gender inequalities and social risks such as HIV/AIDs transmission prevention, 
human trafficking prevention and road safety; (iii) training of women, including those from ethnic 
minorities on technical topics, including tourism service deliveries; (iv) increased representation 
of  women  in  decision-making  bodies  and  (v)  collection  of  sex-disaggregated  data  for  benefit 
monitoring and evaluation. 
127.  A  Gender  Action  Plan  has  been  developed  that  will  also  be  applied  at  the  subproject 
implementation  level  and  will  be  the  responsibility  of  the  gender  focal  point  in  the  PMU  with 
support from a gender consultant in the loan implementation consultant team. 
B. 
Budget and Implementation Arrangements 
128.  The GAP implementation budget is included in the cost tables for operational costs plus 
the input from the gender specialist of LIC consultant. The Four Northeastern Provinces Provincial 
People's  Committees  (PPCs)  will  be  the  EAs  and  the  NEP  Departments  of  Planning  and 
Investment (DPIs) as project owners will be the implementing agencies. The DPIs will implement 
and monitor the GAP with support from the safeguards social/gender specialist. The PMUs will (i) 
assign  a gender focal  point  and  (ii)  will  incorporate GAP monitoring  in their quarterly  progress 
reports, (using the ADB GAP Progress Report template) to government and ADB. The PMUs will 
also assign a gender focal point among PMUs staff to be responsible for GAP implementation, 
monitoring and reporting to ADB. 
129.  The PMUs will be responsible for implementation of the GAP and will appoint Safeguard 
Officers with responsibility as gender focal point(s) ensuring annual planning, implementation and 
monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of the GAPs. The PMUs will recruit national consultants as part 
of the LIC to provide technical assistance in implementation and M&E and reporting of GAP and 
related DMF targets. They will support PMUs in preparing GAP for the additional subprojects and 
for the updating of GAP based on the final approved DED.  
130.  The PMUs will work with the relevant provincial, district and commune agencies (Viet Nam 
Women's Union, Agriculture extension agencies, Committee for Ethnic Minority Affairs and NGOs, 
etc.)  to  implement  and  coordinate  training,  capacity  building,  and  HIV/AIDs  awareness  raising 
and road safety activities.  
Implementation  of  the  GAP  will  be  overseen  by  each  Provincial  Steering  Committee. 
131. 
Budget  for  GAP  implementation  is  provided  through  counterpart  funding  including  training  for 
capacity building and gender activities at subproject level.

B. 
Monitoring 
1. 
Project performance monitoring. 
132.  Project progress and performance will be based on the indicators and targets shown in 
the  DMF.  Five  kinds  of  monitoring  will  be  carried  out  including:  (i)  implementation  progress 
monitoring; (ii) safeguard monitoring; (iii) benefit monitoring and evaluation; (iv) GAP monitoring; 
and (v) loan agreement covenant monitoring. 
133. 
Implementation progress monitoring will be one of the main tasks of each PMU that 
will  be  supported  by  each  PMU  monitoring  and  evaluation  specialist  and  will  be  based  on  the 
detailed  work  planning  schedules  –  see  Annex  4  for  the  proposed  subproject  and  project 
management  work  planning  template  and  the  overall  project  implementation  schedule.  
Collectively  these  will  be  consolidated  into  a  provincial  EA  and  Project-wide  provincial  project 
performance monitoring system (PPMS).  
134.  The PPMS will be managed by the PMU who will maintain it and report updated progress 
on a quarterly basis.  The consolidated project PPMS will be managed by the BIIG1 Coordination 
Unit attached to the Lang Son Province.  
135.  The PPMS will monitor the progress of activities in the province. To augment information 
collected during the PPTA and the subproject feasibility studies will provide a baseline dataset for 
each subproject that will define (i) activities, (ii) the implementation timelines and milestones, (iii) 
outputs delivery progress, (iv) final output, and (v) contribution of each subproject output to the 
outcome  indicators.  The  PPMS  will  not  directly  assess  the  contribution  to  the  project  impact. 
PPMS  monitoring  activities  will  entail  periodic  monitoring  of  the  benefits  and  impacts  of  a 
representative  number  of  selected  subprojects  as  reported  in  quarterly  reports.  This  will  be 
undertaken by each PPC-PMU monitoring and evaluation staff member.  
136.  Each subproject will have a completion report prepared by the construction supervision 
consultant that will include details of (i) output completed, (ii) output still in progress, (iii) road user 
data and forecasts based on traffic counts after road completion and within 6 months of Project 
completion and the conversion of this data into PCU with a comparative assessment of measured 
PCU’s and the those projected at subproject design and feasibility approval. For Water supply the 
number of connections, sale of water data will also be compared to design forecasts. The PMU 
staff will collate this into provincial level reports and the BIIG1 coordination unit will consolidate 
these into an overall Project Performance data base and reporting system that can be used for 
post evaluation purposes. 
2. 
Compliance monitoring. 
137.  The  government  and  EAs  have  agreed  with  ADB  on  certain  covenants  for  the  project, 
which are set forth in the loan agreement including the following: 
(i) 
The government will ensure that adequate funds are allocated for the periodic 
82 
(ii) 
maintenance  of  infrastructure  developed  under  the  project  through  provincial 
budgets to maintain the infrastructure in functional order; and 
The government will ensure that a grievance redress mechanism established in 
RPs/REMDPs for affected people in the participating districts will be implemented 
effectively and satisfactorily. 
138.  ADB  will  monitor  compliance  with  all  covenants  throughout  implementation  via  regular 
review missions, quarterly progress reports submitted by the PMUs through the Secretariat, and 
review of project accounts and procurement procedures. 
139.  Safeguards  monitoring.  Safeguards  monitoring  with  associated  grievance  redress 
mechanisms will be developed to ensure that the required policies, procedures and plans for: (i) 
resettlement including land acquisition and compensation; (ii) ethnic minority specific actions are 
implemented  and  achieve 
their  expected  outcomes  during  subproject  preparation, 
implementation and operation; and (iii) EMP plan implementation. 
3. 
Gender and social dimensions monitoring. 
140.  PMUs  will  monitor  and  report  on  GAP  implementation  to  ADB  regularly.  Data  will  be 
disaggregated by sex and where sensible20 ethnic minorities. Routine monitoring by the Project 
will focus on assessing progress against GAP activities and targets, identifying constraints and 
developing remedial actions to effectively address these. Monitoring results will be included in at 
least every second quarterly progress reports, and assessment/evaluations of the GAP will be an 
essential element of all reviews. 
4. 
Road Safety Monitoring 
141.  The  implementation  of  the  road  safety  awareness  plan  and  the  implementation  of  the 
measures will be reported in the quarterly progress reports. 
C. 
Evaluation 
142.  ADB will conduct regular (at least twice per year) reviews throughout implementation of 
the project to assess implementation performance and achievement of outcomes and objectives, 
examine financial progress, and identify issues and constraints affecting the project and work out 
time-bound action plans for their resolution. 
143.  A midterm review will also be undertaken after 18 months from loan effectiveness. This 
review will include a comprehensive evaluation of project implementation arrangements, detailed 
evaluation of the scope and implementation process and progress of subprojects, feedback from 
the PPMS, performance of consultants, and possible reallocation of loan proceeds. During this 
more significant review, the effectiveness of project management arrangements will be a priority 
with remedial action will be instituted as required. 
144.  Within  12  months  of  physical  completion  of  the  project,  ADB  will  conduct  a  project 
completion mission to carry out a preliminary assessment of the success of the Project to achieve 
its physical, and socio-economic developmental objectives, as well as to review compliance with 
ADB requirements and loan covenants. 
20  Where  ethnic  minorities  account  for  more  than  85%  of  the  population  the  need  to  disaggregated  is  significantly 
reduced  
83 
D. 
Reporting 
1. 
Provincial Work Planning and Reporting  
145.  Reporting will be directly linked to the physical implementation progress of project annual 
work plans, budgets and forecasts of contract awards and disbursements. Work planning will be 
developed by each PMU no later than 45 days prior to the end of the fiscal year with a mid-year 
update no later than 30 days after mid-year. The work plans will be developed for each individual 
subproject with the first annual work plan within 45 days of Project start up. Draft work plans will 
be developed prior to loan signing to enable preparation of advances to be planned and approved. 
A draft structure for subproject physical planning is included in Annex 2 and will be linked into the 
ADB (Viet Nam Resident Mission PDIP excel work book) after loan negotiations. The individual 
subproject work plans will be consolidated and linked to the budgets for ADB and Government 
Funds in separate projections. Both the work plan and projections will be based on a life of project 
approach with progress reported against these and modifications and adaptation to plans made 
on an as needed basis but no less than six monthly. The Project Director is solely responsible for 
ensuring work plans and forecast are developed and maintained on this time line.  
146. 
In addition to the subproject work plan each PMU will also derived a project procurement 
and contract award schedule. The information for this schedule will be derived from the subproject 
workplan schedule and will develop a procurement and contract award reporting worksheet that 
clearly identifies progress against plans and highlights on a quarterly basis any deviation from 
planned schedule timelines where the deviation exceeds one month and formal PMU statement 
on the cause and management response to address the delay is required.  
147.  The  PMU  Project  Director  will  also  ensure  that  the  overall  progress  of  the  project 
implementation  and management  are  clearly  scheduled  including  activities  such  as Safeguard 
monitoring reports,  compliance reporting,  land  acquisition  and  compensation  achievement  and 
the achievement of outputs and how these are contributing to the project DMF indicators – see 
Table  50  below.  As  such  this  will  require  each  PMU  to  establish  a  Project  Performance 
Management  System  that  disaggregates  technical,  social  and  financial  data  within  each 
subproject and captures (i) baselines data from the feasibility study surveys, (ii) data on technical, 
safeguards and social from the detailed design stage, (iii) subproject outputs and the effects on 
the number of beneficiaries, the nature of impacts etc. The different outputs require significantly 
different data sets that will need to be stored and accessible to the PMU for project completion 
reporting  as  well  as  implementation  reporting.  An  indicative  table  of  contents  for  the  progress 
report is provided in Annex E. 
2. 
Project Level Work Planning and Reporting  
148.  As  coordinating  Province  the  Lang  Son  DPI/PMU  will  provide  ADB  with  (i)  quarterly 
progress  reports  in  a  format  consistent  with  ADB's  project  performance  reporting  system; 
(ii) consolidated annual reports including (a) progress achieved by output as measured through 
the  indicator's  performance  targets,  (b)  key  implementation  issues  and  solutions,  (c)  updated 
procurement plan, and (d) updated implementation plan for the next 12 months; and (iii) a project 
completion report within 6 months of physical completion of the project. To ensure that projects 
will continue to be both viable and sustainable, project accounts and the executing agency audited 
financial statement together with the associated auditor's report, should be adequately reviewed. 
84 
149.  Each  Provincial  DPI/PMU  will  ensure  that  the  required  information  and  milestones  are 
achieved through a Memorandum of Understanding agreed between the four EA’s that details the 
annual timing for the preparation and Provincial approval of: 
(i) 
Each  Province  annual  implementation  and  work  plans  presented  by  subproject,  output 
and for the overall province, including 
a.  supporting  annual  budgets  in  the  form  of  financial  forecasts  that  define 
budget and cashflow requirements by source of funding;  
b.  annual projection of contract awards; and  
c.  projected disbursements.  
(ii) 
Timing of a joint provincial project performance and planning meeting supported by the 
BIIG1 co-ordination unit in Lang Son that presents: 
a.  A review of progress and achievement in the past year; 
b.  An updated status of subproject preparatory work for submission to ADB 
and PPC for approvals; 
c.  An updated procurement and contracting status; 
d.  An updated implementation program for the following year including carry 
over activities that were not completed; 
e.  Revised  budget  and 
financial  projections  by  subproject, 
financial 
cashflows; 
f.  Revised contract award and disbursement projections;  
g.  The  preparation  of  a  consolidated  work  plan  and  financial  projection  for 
ADB  8  weeks  prior  to  the  end  of  each  Project  year  Timing  of  a  joint 
provincial  project  performance  and  planning  meeting  every  three-month 
planning update meeting within one month of the mid-year point that: 
i.  Review  the  consolidated  quarterly  report  prepared  by  the  BIIG1 
coordination report; 
ii.  Identifies outstanding implementation issues and challenges; 
iii.  Identifies issues or bottlenecks that need to be addressed within or 
across the provinces; 
iv.  Prepares a report for ADB and the respective PPCs.

E. 
Stakeholder Communication Strategy 
1. 
Consultation 
150.  The  project  is  designed  to  improve  the  welfare  of  rural  inhabitants  in  the  four  Project 
Provinces   through a series of investments aimed to improve transport, socio-economic wellbeing 
and agricultural value chains. 
151.  Project preparation has been conducted with stakeholder agencies in the government at 
national, provincial and district levels including MPI, MOF, SBV and MONRE. Meetings have also 
been held in the participating provinces with DPI, DOT, DARD, DOIT and DOF officials, focusing 
on  management  arrangements  and  issues.  Requirements  for  ensuring  appropriate  levels  of 
consultation for subproject preparation and implementation have been reviewed and confirmed. 
152.  Representative  subproject  preparation  included  consultation  requirements  involving 
documented evidence of inclusive consultation with all communities in the subproject  area and 
participant  information  on  numbers  of  women  and  men  by  ethnic  minority.  Subproject  socio-
economic/gender  surveys  that  identify  vulnerable  groups  to  provide  a  basis  for  specific 
consultation and participation mechanisms will be followed during implementation. 
153.  During implementation, the process of consultation will continue throughout the process 
for preparing and approving FS for additional subprojects and the follow on detailed engineering 
designs for each subproject. The consultation seeks to provide community groups the opportunity 
to  voice  their  views  on  how  the  subproject  is  to  be  designed,  implemented  and  operated.    In 
addition,  associated  initiatives  will  be  built  into  the  design  of  each  subproject  to  enhance  the 
inclusiveness of the project activities from the perspective of social and economic integration of 
less well-off communities. 
2. 
Participation 
154. 
It is anticipated that the community will be mobilized in a number of different ways during 
subproject  design,  implementation  and  operation.  During  subproject  design  and  preparation 
stages, community participation will consist primarily of their contribution through the consultation 
process,  field  survey  ad  focus  group  discussions  and  direct  consultation.  During  construction, 
there will be significant opportunities for active participation, particularly for the poor households 
who will benefit from the subproject through opportunities to participate in paid employment for 
unskilled workers and through the linkages to producers to value chain enterprises and markets. 
This  will  be  encouraged  through  (i)  the  bidding  documents  which  will  require  contractors  to 
investigate  the  option  of  local  employment  whenever  possible,  and  (ii) through  the  terms  of 
reference  for  the  value  chain  service  provider,  the  criteria  for  accessing  producer  group  and 
enterprise grants. 
3. 
Awareness 
Information about the project and the subprojects in particular, including the objectives, 
155. 
potential  environmental  impact,  implementation  arrangements, resettlement  and  compensation 
matters, gender issues, issues of concerns for ethnic minorities will be provided to beneficiaries. 
Information will be provided through village meetings, pamphlets, and other announcements in 
both Vietnamese language and the language(s) of the communities whenever appropriate. The 
community will be fully informed of issues such as their right to participate in the subprojects and 
to be compensated for any loss of property including productive land and/or assets as well as 
87 
gender equity and other relevant policies. Separate meetings and discussions will be arranged 
with  the  people  who  are  directly  affected  by  land  acquisition  and/or  resettlement  issues.  The 
community and particularly the affected households will be provided with detailed guidance and 
procedures regarding resettlement and compensation. 
156.  For output 3 an outreach and information capability will be developed for HortLangSon to

Anticorruption  Policy  relating  to  the  project.21  All  contracts  financed  by  ADB  shall  include 
provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the 
executing agency and all project contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers. 
Individuals and/or entities on ADB’s anticorruption debarment list are ineligible to participate in 
ADB-financed activity and may not be awarded any contracts under the project.22   
159.  To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB’s Anticorruption Policy are included 
in  the  loan  regulations  and  the  bidding  documents  for  the  project.  In  particular,  all  contracts 
financed by ADB in connection with the project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB 
to audit and examine the records and accounts of the EAs, as well as all contractors, suppliers, 
consultants,  and  other  service  providers  as  they  relate  to  the  Project.  Individuals/  entities  on 
ADB’s anticorruption debarment list are ineligible to participate in ADB- financed activity and may 
not  be  awarded  any  contracts  under  the  project.38  The  project  design  and  implementation 
arrangements  provide  for  mitigation  of  corruption  risks.  Risks  associated  with  project 
management, including procurement and disbursement, will be mitigated by the engagement of 
PISC to advise and assist in the procurement of goods and services, and the engagement of other 
consultants.  The  overall  project  will  establish  and  operate  a  website  in  which  it  will  disclose 
implementation  progress;  bid  notifications  and  their  results;  and  provide  grievance  redress 
mechanism  against  any  corrupt  practice.  References  on  ADB's  Anticorruption  Policy  can  be 
accessed through the following link: http://www.adb.org/Integrity/.

XI. 
ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISM 
160.  People  who  are,  or may  in the future  be,  adversely  affected  by the  project  may  submit 
complaints  to  ADB’s  Accountability  Mechanism.  The  Accountability  Mechanism  provides  an 
independent forum and process whereby people adversely affected by ADB-assisted projects can 
voice,  and  seek  a  resolution  of  their  problems,  as  well  as  report  alleged  violations  of  ADB’s 
operational  policies  and  procedures.  Before  submitting  a  complaint  to  the  Accountability 
Mechanism, affected people should make an effort in good faith to solve their problems by working 
with  the  concerned  ADB  operations  department.  Only  after  doing  that,  and  if  they  are  still 
dissatisfied, should they approach the Accountability Mechanism.23

161.  All revisions and/or updates during the course of implementation should be retained in this 
section to provide a chronological history of changes to implemented arrangements recorded in 
the PAM, including revision to contract awards and disbursement s-curves.

a. 
General 
168.  The procedures to be followed for the procurement of goods, non-consulting services, and 
works under contracts awarded on the basis of National Competitive Bidding shall be those set 
forth  in:  (a)  Law  on  Procurement  No.  43/2013/QH13  dated  November  26,  2013  ("Law  on 
Procurement") and (b) Decree No.63/2014/ND-CP dated June 26, 2014 (collectively, "National 
Procurement Laws"). Whenever any procedure in the National Procurement Laws is inconsistent 
with  the  ADB  Procurement  Guidelines  (March  2013,  as  amended  from  time to  time),  the  ADB 
Procurement Guidelines shall prevail, amongst others on the following. 
b. 
Eligibility 
169.  The  eligibility  of  bidders  shall  be  defined  under  section  I  of  the  ADB  Procurement 
Guidelines; accordingly, no bidder or potential bidder should be declared ineligible for reasons 
other than those provided in section I of the ADB Procurement Guidelines, as amended from time 
to time. Conditions of bidders' participation shall be limited to those that are essential to ensure 
bidders' capability to fulfill the contract in question. Foreign bidders shall be eligible to participate 
under the same conditions as national bidders. Foreign bidders shall not be asked or required to 
form joint ventures with, or be subcontractors to, national bidders in order to submit a bid. 
170.  A  firm  declared  ineligible  by  ADB  cannot  participate  in  bidding  for  an  ADB-financed 
contract during the period of time determined by ADB. 
171.  A bidder shall not have a conflict of interest, which term shall be defined in accordance 
with section  1 of  ADB  Procurement Guidelines. Any  bidder found to  have a conflict  of  interest 
shall be ineligible for contract award. 
172.  Government-owned enterprises in the Borrower's country shall be eligible to participate 
as a bidder only if they can establish that they are legally and financially autonomous, operate 
under commercial law and are not dependent agencies of the Borrower or Sub-Borrower. 
173.  National sanction lists may only be applied with approval of ADB. 
c. 
Preference 
174.  No preference of any kind shall be given to domestic bidders over foreign bidders or for 
domestically manufactured goods over foreign manufactured goods. Unless otherwise stated in 
the applicable financing agreement, preferences among domestic bidders set forth in Article 14(3) 
of the Law on Procurement shall not be applied. 
d. 
Bidding Procedure 
175.  Single  stage-single  envelope  shall  be  the  default  bidding  procedure  and  application  of 
other bidding procedures shall require ADB's prior approval. 
e. 
Time for Bid Preparation 
176.  The  time  allowed  for  the  preparation  and  submission  of  bids  for  large  and/or  complex 
packages shall not be less than thirty (30) days from the date of the invitation to bid or the date of 
112  
availability of the bidding documents, whichever is later. 
f. 
Standard bidding documents 
177.  The Borrower's standard bidding documents, acceptable to ADB, shall be used. Bidders 
shall be allowed to submit bids by hand or by mail/ courier. 
g.

(vi) 
(vii) 
Bids  shall  be  opened  in  public,  immediately  after  the  deadline  for 
submission of bids, regardless of the number of bids received. 
Except  with  prior  approval  of  ADB,  merit  points  shall  not  be  used  in  bid 
evaluation. 
No price adjustments shall be made for evaluation purposes in accordance 
with Article 117(6) of Decree 63 when unit rates offered by the bidder are 
determined to be abnormally low. 
Bidders shall be given commercially reasonable time period to respond to 
clarification requests. 
Bidders  shall  not  be  eliminated  from  detailed  evaluation  on  the  basis  of 
minor, non-substantial deviations3. 
Except  with  the  prior  approval  of  ADB,  negotiations  contemplated  under 
paragraphs 7 and 8 of Article 117 of Decree No. 63/2014/ND-CP shall not 
take place with any bidder prior to contract award. 
A  bidder  shall  not  be  required,  as  a  condition  for  award  of  contract,  to 
undertake obligations not specified in the bidding documents or otherwise 
to modify the bid as originally submitted. 
h. 
Rejection of All Bids and Rebidding 
(i) 
(ii) 
No bid shall be rejected on the basis of a comparison with the Procuring 
Entity's estimate or budget ceiling without ADB's prior concurrence. 
All  bids  shall  not  be  rejected  and  new  bids  solicited  without  ADB's  prior 
approval.

Output 3: Agribusiness Service Provider   
a. 
Background 
203.  The purpose of Output 3: Agricultural Value Chain Infrastructure for Lang Son province 
is  to  assist  the  development  of  Lang  Son’s  horticultural  sector  using  an  agribusiness  value 
chain approach.  
204.  Although the horticultural sector is an important economic contributor to the Lang son 
economy,  it  is  weakly  developed  and  the  main  commodities  exhibit  low  levels  of 
commercialization. The sector’s potential for growth is severely constrained by weak industry 
coordination and a lack of a comprehensive development strategy. Sector development plans 
remain production based and these fails to address a number of constraining factors, including 
market  failure.  The  sector  is  characterized  by  commodities  that  are  grown  by  many  small 
holders on small areas, have low output volumes, and with weakly formed value chains with 
products  sold  into  lower  value  markets.  The  value  chains  businesses  have  limited  financial 
resources  and  access  to  investment  capital  is  a  major  constraint.  The  Lang  Son  provincial 
government has a piecemeal approach to support, and this is weakly coordinated across the 
departments with horticultural sector responsibilities.  
205.  Horticultural  sector  development  is  also  constrained  by  the  small  scale  of  product 
groups. Only star anise has small to medium sized commercial businesses, but even these 
businesses  do  not  have  the  financial  resources  to  fund  their  own  development.  Successful 
product development requires a mix of support measures that will enable the small immature 
product industries, and their value chains, to become more commercial and market orientated. 
Overcoming the constraint of small product industry size and developing competitive export 
product value chains is the major strategic challenge that the Lang Son horticultural industry 
139 
faces. The prospect of the small Lang Son horticultural product industries growing into stable 
and profitable export value chains is unlikely without a coordinated sector wide approach and 
a significant commitment to building strong market led strategies. 
b. 
Project Investment  
206.  The Project investment will address the need for coordinating the small, fragmented 
and disjointed structure of the existing horticulture sector and the associated market failure. 
Support  for  the  establishment  of  a  Horticultural  Sector  Industry  Organization  (working  title 
HortLangSon) is a key feature of the Project investment.  HortLangSon will be the institutional 
basis for initiating and sustaining commercial market focused product groups and value chain 
development and growth.   
207.  HortLangSon will be an industry organization that represents the private sector and will 
lead and coordinate the development  of the  Lang  Son  horticultural  sector. It  is  expected  to 
support  small  industry  groups  to  grow  into  a  larger  grouping  thus  creating  a  critical  mass 
sufficient to promote market led commercial horticulture with an emphasis on value creation 
within  Lang  Son  Province.  The  industry  support  will  recognize  the  ethnic  diversity  of  the 
stakeholders, and the important role played by women in production, business and marketing 
activities. 
208.  HortLangSon’s  role  and  functions  are  intended  to  add  value  to  the  existing  State 
management  responsibilities  of  the  various  government  departments  through  providing  an 
overall strategic coordination and vision at a value chain scale. The functions will not compete 
or overlap. HortLangSon will provide a focal point for coordinated input by the various State 
and non-state management agencies into horticulture sector development.  
c. 
Implementation Support Challenge 
209.  Successful  development  of  HortLangSon 
requires  specialist  agribusiness 
implementation  and  contract  management  support.  Unfortunately,  there  is  a  dearth  of 
horticulture sector agribusiness expertise in Viet Nam.  The national and provincial government 
agencies do not have the required agribusiness capacity to advise and assist the development 
of HorLangSon. The government agencies also lack experience to plan and manage inclusive 
growth programs, especially to where women are actively involved in value chain activities.  A 
suitably  experienced  specialist  Agribusiness  Implementation  and  Contract  Management 
service  provider  is  required  to  assist  with  the  establishment  of  HortLangSon  and  to  get  it 
operational. 
d.

Design Structure and Activities 
256.  Output 3 will contribute to the BIIG 1 Impact of closer economic connectivity enhancing 
the subregional competitiveness of the Four North Eastern Provinces27. This will be achieved 
through  a  coordinated  industry  led  business  and  market  focused  strategy  for  improved 
horticultural  sector  economic  performance  that  will  lead  to  increased  inclusive  economic 
growth  in  Lang  Son  province.  Establishment  of  a  Horticultural  Industry  Sector  Organization 
(known as HortLangSon) is the strategic Output 3 design feature to build sustainability through 
modifying  incentives  into  marketing  business  opportunities.  HortLangSon  will  provide  the 
coordination and leadership role for the development of the Lang Son horticultural sector. It is 
intended that HortLangSon will be developed into a permanent industry organisation that will 
promote investment and value addition for horticultural sector members. 
257.  HortLangSon’s  sector  role  will  feature:  market  driven  product  value  chains  aimed  at 
added  value  “export”  markets,  encourage  investment  in  sector  industries,  prioritise  quality 
assurance,  achieve  strong  business  relationships  between  value  chain  actors,  and  where 
income for all actors, including women and men farmers, is increased.  
258.  HortLangSon will consist of: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
Board of Directors that will consist of leading horticultural sector members and 
senior government appointees; 
Secretariat that will support the board and manage HortLangSon operations; 
Service delivery units that will deliver the core sector support and development 
functions. 
259.  The project will contract an Implementation and Contract Supervision Service Provider 
to provide the Secretariat services and develop service delivery units.    
260.  Once established and operational HortLangSon will initiate the development of its core 
functions and assist the development of product value chains. The first two value chains to be 
assisted by the project are planned to be star anise and safe vegetables.  
261.  Core HortLangSon functions will include: 
(i) 
(ii) 
horticultural sector coordination by providing Product Groups with a platform to 
build their small sector industries; 
achieve  cost  effectiveness  from  shared  common  services  that  support  value 
chain development; 
(iii)  market knowledge and information;  
(iv) 
(v) 
(vi) 
product quality assurance to meet international and trade standards;  
export-trade linkages development, and; 
outreach and education.  
262.  HortLangSon will adopt a value chain development will enhance inclusive growth along 
the  chain  and  provide  increased  economic  opportunities  for  ethnic  minorities  and  women 
empowering their participation in the sector and the wider economy.  
263.  The Output 3 Design Matrix is shown in Appendix 1 and this provides more detail on 
the  Output  3  components  and  activities.  Figure  8  below  provides  an  outline  of  the 
establishment of HortLangSon. 
27 The four provinces are Cao Bang, Bac Kan, Ha Giang and Lang Son 
Figure 8: Stages in Establishment of HortLangSon 
175 
264.  The  PPC  with  assistance  from  the  Horticultural  Sector  Transformation  Group  will 
appoint the HortLangSon Interim Board.  Once the HortLangSon Service provider is procured 
and contracted (by the PMU) the Horticultural Sector Strategic Plan (HSSP) will be prepared 
and the Service Provider will assist the PMU with the establishment of HortLangSon.   
265.  Once  HortlangSon  has  been  established  the  Service  Provider  will  commence  the 
implementation of the HSSP that will include the formation of the priority Product Groups and 
the preparation of the Product group development plans. HortLangSon will develop its range 
of value chains services and implement the Enterprise Viability Gap Grant and Producer Group 
grant program.

266.  The product development plans and the prioritized market and actions will define the 
scope of services and investment to be provided to the respective value chains – see Figure

276.  The PMU Deputy Director will be the main operational contact for the Service Provider 
and  the  PMU  Agricultural  Specialist  will  facilitate  the  agreed  operational  linkages  with  the 
horticultural sector and Lang Son departments. The high proportion of the women involved the 
horticultural  sectors  means  that  the  Gender  Specialist  will  have  an  important  role  that  will 
include  both  implementation  support  (working  with  HortLangSon),  as  well  as  monitoring  to 
ensure compliance. 
D. 
HortLangSon Role and Functions 
277.  Background:  The  rationale  for  forming  HortLangSon  is  further  described  here  as  it 
provides  a  background  for  all  Output  3  implementers  about  the  HortLangSon  role  and 
functions. 
278.  HortLangSon’s role consists of the following strategic activities: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
(v) 
prepare a strategy for the sector’s growth and development;  
engage  with  private  sector  organization’s  and  members  and  government 
departments to plan and implement the sector strategy;  
initiate and implement a program of sector enhancement activities that includes 
assisting value chain development;  
identify and provide a platform for horticultural Product groups to access cost 
effective services; 
prioritize product quality assurance and standards for export, food safety, trade 
185 
relationships and sector member education; 
(vi)  manage and deliver a program of business, marketing and production advice 
(vii) 
and support;  
ensure that sector development interventions actively and equitably target, and 
are inclusive of, ethnic minorities and women; and,  
(viii)  act  as  a  Secretariat  to  represent  Product  groups  that  include  sector  agri-
enterprises, farmers and other members.  
The  Vision  for  the  Horticultural  Industry  Sector  Organization  is  to  achieve  the 
following outcomes: 
Identify and proactively market investment opportunities;  
•  Coordinated and coherent strategy for the sector’s development; 
•  Market, trade and other services provided to sector members;  
•  Facilitate investors and investors into the Lang Son Horticultural Sector; 
• 
•  Sector product groups involved in sector planning and development; 
•  GoV agencies with a coordinated service focused approach to sector support; 
•  Competitive market led value chains for selected products developed; 
• 
Inclusive growth for the sector and its members, including women and men farmers.  
186  
279.  HortLangSon’s  structure  will  consist  of  a  governance  board  and  secretariat  that  will 
support the board and manage the core roles and functions as summarized in Figure 5 below: 
Figure 12: HortLangSon Structure 
280.  Establishment of HortLangSon will be managed by the PMU and implemented by the 
Service Provider. Once appointed the Service Provider will provide advice and support to the 
PMU  and  PPC  over  HortLangSon  development  (see  Section  IV  Output  3  Implementation). 
Over the life of the Project the aim is for HortLangSon to: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
become a fully functional and viable horticultural industry sector organization;   
be established as an association with the horticultural sector Product groups as 
the members; 
lead  a  market  focused  approach  to  sector  development  with  strong  Product 
groups and modern value chains; 
develop its core business, marketing, export and trade and quality assurance 
services that will be available to sector members 
281. 
In the early stages of HortLangSon the province will be responsible for the operational 
costs  -  through  the  project.  It  is  envisaged  that  as  the  Product  groups  develop  and  have 
increased financial  resources from  the  higher  prices for their  products  that  they  will  start to 
contribute to the operations costs through Product group levies, and payment for some of the 
HortLangSon services.  
282.  The Service Provider will assist with the legal establishment of HortLangSon including 
the constitution and articles of association in compliance with the national law. Establishment 
tasks  also  involve  preparing  the  governance  arrangements,  functional  responsibilities, 
operational guidelines, and scope of work. The Service Provider will also lead the preparation 
of the first HortLangSon business plan.          
283.  HortLangSon Governance: for the first three years, will be through an Interim Board 
consisting of eight members: 
(i) 
Five horticulture  private sector members  will  be appointed  by the  PPC to the 
Interim board; 
             Board Secretariat Industry Development, Assistance  Core Sector Services for Products and Value Chain Development Output 3 Implementation (over project life)     
187 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
At least two (2) of the private sector members must be women; 
Three  Government  of  Viet  Nam (GoV)  representatives,  one from  each  of  the 
following departments: DOIT, DARD and DOST;  
At least one (1) of the GoV agencies members must be a woman; 
284.  The PMU Director will the Interim Board Chairperson, and will report to the PPC. The 
Interim  Board  will  as  part  of  defining  HortLangSon  establishment  will  also  define  board 
succession for incorporation into the HortLangSon articles of association within the first two 
years.  After  three  years  of  HortLangSon’s  operation  the  Interim  Board  will  transition  to  an 
Elected Board of Directors through a succession plan based on the agreed operational policies 
at the Annual General Meeting. The province will continue to have three members appointed 
by the PPC, one of whom will be the PMU Director. 
285.  To  ensure  governance  continuity  in  the  newly  formed  organization  the  articles  will 
include the requirement that there will be a rotation of the private sector members of the board.  
Three of the appointed private sector members will retire, but will be eligible for election at the 
Annual General Meeting. Two of the interim board members will continue as members for first 
five - year term. The Interim Board will vote to determine the two members that will continue 
for three more years. From the second five - year term election onwards all private sector board 
members will complete their terms, but may be eligible for re-election depending upon their 
length of tenure (see below).   
286.  By  default,  the  tenure  of  the  board members  will  be  limited  to  two  five  -  year  terms 
unless the Board itself deems otherwise and the subsequent Annual General Meeting votes 
their support of the proposal for an extended term of the board members. At the stage that the 
product  groups  assume  full  financial  responsibility  for  HortLangSon  the  PPC  will  be 
represented by one voting board member, and three non-voting members.  
287.  HortLangSon’s functions and tasks will be implemented through a Secretariat that will 
be  responsible for  the  organization’s  operations.  For  the  first  three  years  of  the  Project  the 
Secretariat role will be undertaken by the contracted Implementation Supervision and Contract 
Management Service Provider.  The Service Provider will be responsible for: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
(v) 
(vi) 
Development of the HortLangSon Secretariat role and establish the institutional 
basis for its effective operations;  
Specify and operationalise core services including marketing, trade and logistic 
services, quality assurance and sector advocacy; 
Implement  the  project  investment  activities  to  facilitate  horticultural  sector 
development e.g. Competitive grants;  
Assist Product value chain development commencing with the star anise and 
vegetable value chains;  
Establish the range of services that HortLangSon will provide to the sector: of 
technical, production, business, quality assurance, trade and information, and 
marketing services for sector Product value chain development; 
Support developing a transition plan for the transfer of some current government 
services to HortLangSon on a user pays basis (based upon prior approval of 
the PPC).  
(vii)  Review the options for building a quality assessment labelling and traceability 
program for Lang Son products  
288.  HortLangSon’s strategic role in the horticultural sector development will involve a close 
working relationship with the PPC. Increasing horticultural sector investment is a priority for 
the PPC and HortLangSon will ensure that there is close alignment between the sector strategy 
and the province’s development strategy and plans.  Once HortLangSon is operational it will 
work in combination with the PPC and DPI to promote horticultural sector investment from both 
188  
within and outside the province. 
Implementation  Management  -  Once  appointed  the  Service  Provider  will  be 
289. 
responsible for the implementation of Output 3. This will consist of two main task areas: 
(i) 
(ii) 
HortLangSon establishment, develop its sector industry role, and get the core 
functions operational;  
Implement the Output 3 investment and business development, marketing and 
production technical support program. 
290.  The Service Provider will be responsible to the PPC through the PMU for implementing 
the Output 3 activities. These Output 3 activities are outlined in the Output 3 Design Matrix 
(Appendix 1 of this Manual) and Service Provider terms of reference (Appendix 3) describe in 
detail the tasks for each of the Service Provider experts. Main Service Provider implementation 
management tasks are presented in Table 56 below and there is a more detailed description 
of Service Provider activity implementation tasks in Section IV Output 3 Implementation.

E. 
Role of Lang Son Provincial Departments, Districts and Communes   
292.  Provincial departments will not have a direct implementation role. They will, however, 
have an important role in performing their state management function to support horticultural 
sector development. Output 3 design recognizes their role the development of the horticultural 
sector. The provincial departments are also represented upon the Lang Son BIIG 1 Project 
Steering Committee. Government regulations do not permit the Lang Son departments to be 
funded by  the  project. This  includes  any  extension,  training  and  research activities that  are 
linked to the Output 3 activities.  All the of the various department’s services and activities must 
be funded through their annual budget.  
293.  Departments should ensure that they include any proposed Output 3 support services 
in their annual plan and budget, and the PMU will be responsible for nearing that this occurs.  
192  
294.  The  development  of  HotLangSon  as  Lang  Son’s  horticultural  sector  industry 
organization requires that a close working relationship is established between HortLangSon 
and  the  key  departments  involved  in  the  horticultural  sector.  A  Horticultural  Sector 
Transformation  Group  will  be  formed  to  achieve  a  high  degree  of  synergy  for  sector 
development  between  the  departments  and  HortLangSon.    The  purpose  of  the  Sector 
Transformation  Group  is  the  strategic  integration  of  the  functions  and  activities  of  the 
departments  and  HortLangSon  to  achieve  a  coordinated  approach  to  sector  development. 
Sector Transformation Group membership will consist of the leaders of the departments, the 
Lang  Son  Business  Association,  the  HortLangSon  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  the  PMU 
Director will chair the group. The Sector Transformation Group will meet twice yearly (October 
and March). The October meeting will focus on coordination and integrated planning for the 
upcoming year, while the March meeting will be to ensure integration of activities.  Terms of 
reference for the Sector Transformation Group are shown in Appendix 4.  
295.  An  overview  of  coordination  between  the  departments,  districts,  project  units  and 
HortLangSon is shown in Figure 13.   
296.  Although the Departments will have a limited direct implementation responsibility their 
contribution to Output 3 through their statement management functions is important. Over the 
life of Output 3 the departments will develop a close working relationship with HortLangSon 
that will establish the basis for their sector roles after the project is completed. The following 
short  sections  outline  the  current  involvement  of  the  main  departments  in  the  horticultural 
sector and present the main areas where it is expected that the departments will contribute to 
the Output 3 and coordinate with HortLangSon for sector development.  
297.  The mechanism for planning and coordination role will be: 
•  Sector  Transformation  Group  –  strategy  coordination,  planning  and 
implementation overview; 
•  The role of the districts and communes in Output 3 support is also described in this 
section.

used  concurrently  with  any  market  development  funding  provided  by  DOIT,  or  any  other 
provincial department. The approach that will be followed by HortLangSon is to coordinate with 
DOIT over horticultural sector marketing to ensure that there is no overlap of activities. This 
will be achieved through the Output 3 Coordination Group.

326.  The PMU/DPI Lang Son will use advance action to recruit a service provider by preparing 
expression of interest (EOI) and request for proposals (RFP) prior to loan signing.  
327.  The  service  provider  will  be  a  national  agribusiness  service  company  that  has  a  track 
record in agribusiness value chain support and with direct experience in international marketing 
202  
of  Vietnamese  products,  market  research  and  quality  control,  logistics  and  trade  and  logistic 
services that are linked to developing value chain linkages for inclusiveness of small producers, 
women and local service providers within Lang Son province. Government-owned enterprises in 
the borrower’s country may participate as a bidder only if they can establish that they (i) are legally 
and  financially  autonomous,  (ii)  operate  under  commercial  law  and  (iii)  are  not  dependent 
agencies of the borrower or sub-borrower.  
328.  The Service provider will report directly to the PMU until the board of Governor/Directors 
for  HortLangSon  is  established.  Once  established  the  DPI/PMU  Project Director  will  sit  on  the 
Board and the service provider will take guidance from the HortLangSon Board whilst reporting 
to the Project Director. 
329.  Annual work plans will be required from the service provider with defined milestones for 
the following activities: 
(i) 
Establishing  HortLangSon  –  to  work  with  a  stakeholder  groups  comprising 
industry  leaders from the private  and  public  sector  in Lang  Son.  Activities will 
include  
(a) board and governance establishment, 
(b) strategic plan with supporting business model and operation guidelines,  
(c) executive and operational establishment 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
(v) 
Industry  and  subsector  market  and  quality  assessments  –  these  will  be 
conducted  by  the  service  provider  working  with  commodity  groups  with  an 
agreed memorandum of understanding signed between HortLangSon (Board), 
the agribusiness service provider, and the respective commodity associations. 
All market information will be held by both the association and HortLang Son and 
will be accessible by the public-sector board members for use in their service 
functions.   
Quality  assurance  systems  will  be  defined  by  the  service  provider  for  each 
subsector based on the market assessments conducted. 
Value  chain  financing  and  support  program  –  the  proposed  systems  will  be 
defined  with  supporting  operational  manuals,  clear  systems  for  promoting 
applications, clear criteria with proposed outlines for submitting applications and 
the  required  supporting  documentation,  transparent  review  and  assessment 
processes for the applicants for competitive grant awards, an approval process 
where DPI and PPC validate recommendations but are not directly involved in 
the review process, monitoring and reporting systems. The service provider will 
establish  these  systems  being  guided  by  the  criteria  included  herein  and 
agreements between the ADB and the respective EAs. ADB will have the right 
to prior review of all procedures and financing awards.  
Producer linkages will be formed both horizontally through producer groups and 
vertically through supply linkage requirement for both enterprises and producer 
groups  to  access  project  financing.  Groups  will  receive  support  in  preparing 
business  plan  application  and  the  adoption  of  quality  assurance  and  crop 
planning systems to enable supply agreement to be developed.  
330.  Once appointed the Service Provider will undertake inception tasks that include inception 
visits to main sector agencies, agri-enterprise and to the districts. During these visits the Service 
Provider  will  take  the  opportunity  to  create  awareness  about  Output  3,  the  establishment  of 
203 
HortLangSon  and  its  horticultural  sector  development  role.  The  awareness  is  an  important 
foundation  leading  to  the  next  activity  establishment  of  HortLangSon,  the  strategic  planning 
exercise, including the HortLangSon business plan. The Service Provider will complete six week 
inception period and the output will be: 
331.  Draft Inception Report –submitted to PMU for approval.

332.  Formation  of  the  Horticultural  Sector  Transformation  Group  will  provide  a  high  level 
strategic  input  to  the  development  of  HortLangSon.  The  Sector  Transformation  Group  will  be 
responsible  to  the  PPC  to  oversee  and  guide  the  establishment  of  HortLangSon  including  the 
appointment of the Interim Board (see terms of reference in Appendix 4). Subsequently the Sector 
Transformation Group will ensure that the strategies and plans for the sector’s development align 
with the PPC policies. The Sector Transformation Group will be formed in the first month of the 
project  and  will  work  closely  with  the  PMU  and  Service  Provider  (once  appointed)  to  get 
HortLangSon established and get the key initial activities underway – the HSSP being a priority.   
333.  Appointment of the interim HortLangSon board will involve consultation with the main agri-
enterprises active in the horticultural sector and supporting service sectors including finance and 
credit.  Sector members will be encouraged to nominate candidates. HortLang Son will facilitate 
the board search process that will involve a profiling exercise whereby the characteristics required 
in a board member are defined. The Service Provider will develop a shortlist of suitable candidates 
with the PMU, the Sector Transformation Group, and the PPC will be responsible for making the 
appointments.  
Involving  the  horticultural  sector  members  in  the  establishment  of  HortLangSon  is 
334. 
essential. This will be a challenging task at the start of the project as HortLangSon will represent 
the  whole  sector:  farmer  producers,  small  and  bigger  traders,  processors,  marketers,  service 
204  
providers, and retailers. The Service Provider will need to work closely with the private sector and 
the  public  sector:  DARD,  DOST,  Women’s  Union,  Farmer’s  Union,  and  DOIT  and  utilize  their 
network of sector contacts in order to establish the connection with the whole sector. The DPCs 
and their agricultural service units will also need to be involved.  
335. 
It is recognized that some sector members will have limited governance experience and 
the  Service  Provider  will  mentor  the  interim  HortLangSon  board.    An  Output  3  feature  is  the 
governance accelerator program that will initially focus upon the women and men members of the 
HortLangSon  Interim  Board  (the  governance  accelerator  for  women  is  included  as  part  of  the 
GAP).  The  governance  accelerator  program  will  be  further  developed  for  Product  Groups  and 
also  for  the  leadership  of  the  Producer  Groups.  The  governance  accelerator  program  will  be 
developed and implemented by the Service Provider in conjunction with the Lang Son Business 
Association.  The  purpose  being  to  develop  the  Business  Association’s  training  capacity  and 
portfolio of courses that will enable them to play a much bigger role in sector business capacity 
development in the future.    
336.  The  HortLangSon  Secretariat  will  be  initially  staffed  for  the  first  three  years  by  the 
Implementation and Contract Supervision Service Provider. The Service Provider Team Leader 
will be the interim HortLangSon Chief Executive Officer and will fill this position for the first three 
years of the project. It is intended the HortLangSon will start to recruit staff from year 2 of the 
project.  
337.  The mid-term review will assess the status of HortLangSon and will consult with the PMU 
and  PPC  about  the  contracting  of  HortLangSon  staff  including  a  Chief  Executive  Officer.  One 
staffing option that will be considered is the secondment of public sector personnel for a minimum 
period of 18 months. The Service Provider would mentor these staff and if they perform well then 
they  may  be  offered  a  permanent  position  in  the  HortLangSon  Secretariat  requiring  them  to 
transition out of the public sector.   
338.  HortLangSon  has  not  been formed  to take  over  the  role and functions  of the  provincial 
departments. HortLangSon will be a sector industry organization that represents the private sector 
members of the horticultural industry. HortLangSon’s core functions will be complementary to the 
functions of the Lang Son departments. This will require a partnership between HortLangSon and 
the departments.  
339.  The partnership approach will be activated through a Horticultural Sector Transformation 
Group (see Section III and terms of reference in Appendix 4) that will consist of the departments 
and HortLangSon. The Horticultural Sector Transformation Group will be a high level body and 
will consist of the heads of the main departments, the HortLangSon Chief Executive Officer and 
be  chaired  by  PPC  Vice  Chairperson  responsible  for  the  project.  Ensuring  that  there  are 
consistent  policies  and  that  provincial  resources  are  effectively  and  efficiently  applied  for 
horticultural sector development will be one role for the Horticultural Sector Transformation Group. 
3. 
Activity 3.1.3 Horticulture Sector Strategic Planning 
340.  The  horticultural  sector  strategic  planning:  HSSP  exercise  will  is  a critical  task  that  will 
provide the foundation for sector development under Output 3. The Service Provider will prepare 
the  HSSP  that  will  include  a  market  assessment  for  the  main  Lang  Son  sector  commodities. 
Preparation of the HortLangSon business plan will be undertaken in parallel to the HSSP.  
341.  The rationale for this Activity is that a strategic review of the Lang Son horticultural sector 
205 
is required before any market assessment can be made and the HortLangSon business plan can 
be  prepared.  The  HSSP  provides  a  major  opportunity  for  engagement  across  the  horticulture 
sector, and to ensure that the members start to have high level of “ownership” of HortLangSon 
and the plans for the sector’s development.

342.  The HSSP will build on an analysis of the horticultural sector and its current situation as 
well as market opportunities. A key focus of the plan will be to assess the needs of a modern 
market led horticultural sector.  The design approach features moving from Product supply models 
to product based value chains and the strategy development must also assess each product, their 
markets  and  potential  actors  for  moving  into  value  chains,  and  determine  their  potential  for 
development. Market assessments are essential for defining marketing strategies for the sector 
and for the main products. Project funded activities are limited to horticultural products with clearly 
defined market needs, standards and clear options for accessing these markets, The strategic 
planning exercise must: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
the  overall  strategic  approach 
for  Lang  Son  horticultural  sector 
Define 
development; 
Assess the main sector commodities and prioritise these based upon their market 
prospects,  production  methodologies,  agri-enterprise  facilities  and  value  adding 
equipment, and the potential for modern value chain development; 
Identify  (and  confirm)  the  role  and  key  functions  for  HortLangSon,  and  present 
these in the HortLangSon business plan; 
(iv)  Outline the role of provincial government in policy development to enable sector 
growth and development; 
Define  the  roles  of  departments  and  other  agencies  to  facilitate  sector 
(v) 
206  
development. 
343.  The purpose of the market assessment is two-fold: (i) scope the market potential for the 
most significant horticultural crops grown in Lang Son, and; (ii) confirm the market potential for 
the  first  value  chain  activities:  star  anise  and  safe  vegetables.  For  both  star  anise  and  safe 
vegetables this is a stop/go exercise and if the market assessment does not justify the proposed 
Output 3 investment then either (i) a reduced investment may be proposed, or (ii) a replacement 
Product value chain will be selected. Other key features of the sector strategic review will be: 
(i) 
(ii) 
Initial ranking of Product value chains for investment support by the project; 
An agreement with the Sector Transformation Group for the five Product Groups 
to be assisted by the project. 
344.  The  Lang  Son  PPC  is  a  key  stakeholder  in  the  strategic  plan  and  must  be  actively 
consulted in its preparation.  The PPC has number of objectives that need to incorporated in the 
plan and these include: 
(i) 
(ii) 
Increased  processing  and  value  adding  in  the  province  to  increase  employment 
and generate more income; 
Encouraging outside investment in the horticultural sector. 
345.  The strategic plan must align with the 2016-2020 provincial Socio-Economic Development 
Plan horticultural sector priorities.  
346.  Outputs from Activity 3.1.3 will be: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
Strategic Plan for the Horticultural Sector; 
Market Assessment; 
HortLangSon Business Plan. 
347.  The  HortLangSon  board  will  receive  the  HSSP,  Market  Assessment  and  the  Business 
Plan  and  it  will  be  submitted  to  the  PMU,  and  the  PPC  for  final  approval.  Following  the  PPC 
approval decision it will be widely communicated to all sector members and will be publicly notified 
on the PMU, HortLangSon and departmental websites (Activity 3.1.9). 
4. 
Activity 3.1.4 HortLangSon Secretariat Establishment 
348.  Establishment  of  HortLangSon  will  be  initiated  through  the  appointment  of  the  Interim 
Board and preparation of the legal basis for HortLangSon (Activity 3.1.2 above). Following the 
preparation of the HSSP and the HortLangSon business plan the Service Provider will commence 
to  develop  HortLangSon  Secretariat.  Once  the  Secretariat  is  established  and  operational  the 
Service Provider will commence to develop the HortLangSon sector services (see Figures 8 and 
9).  Development  of  the  main  services  is  described  below  under  Activities  3.1.6,  3.1.7,  3.1.8, 
3.1.98, and 3.1.10.

Activity 3.1.5 Product Groups Formed and Development Plans Prepared    
349.  Formation of the Product Groups is a cornerstone of the horticultural sector’s development 
as a means for developing coordination amongst smaller producers and enterprises. They will be 
the constituent members of HortLangSon the services provided by HortLangSon will support their 
development into modern value chain businesses. It is proposed that there will be five Product 
Groups  formed  over  the  first  three  years  but  these  need  to  be  confirmed  by  the  HSSP.  The 
Agricultural Producer Groups and Market Linkages expert, with the support of the Team Leader, 
will  lead  the  formation  of  the  Product  Groups.  The  role  and  function  of  the  groups,  and  their 
formation is outlined in Section V. 
350.  Product Group formation will provide the platform for development of the product value 
chains.  Once  the  product  groups  are  formed  they  will  be  assisted  by  the  Service  Provider  to 
prepare their strategy and an action plan for their product value chain development. Star anise 
(once  confirmed  by  the  HSSP)  will  be  first  product  value  chain  that  the  Service  Provider  will 
support. Safe vegetables will be second. It emphasized that the Product Groups must be inclusive 
of all product sector members – from producers to processors, retailers, and service providers.  
Each  Product  Group  will  be  assisted  to  prepare  their  sector  development  strategy  and  plan. 
Product sector planning must address the needs of the all the sectors and the whole value chain. 
351.  Product  value  chain  development  will  be  facilitated  through  the  Competitive  Grants 
(Activity 3.1.6) especially the Viability Gap Grants for Enterprises, and also the Producer Group 
grants (see Section V for more information on the operation of the Competitive grants). Several 
other activities will also support the initial and ongoing development of the Product value chains. 
The  HortLangSon  service  functions  especially  in  Trade  and  Market  Information,  and  Quality 
Assurance and Compliance, as well business planning, will be available to assist all value chain 
members. Service Provider and HortLangSon support services will be available for all Product 
group members, this includes agri-enterprises that do not have viability gap grants.

Activity 3.1.6 Competitive Grants- Viability Gap Grants  
209 
353.  HortLangSon through the Service Provider will implement the grants procedures including 
the formalization of the procedures to be used, defining the administration of the grant proposal, 
grant evaluation and grant award process and seek the PPC approval of such processes.  The 
PMU will manage the approval process and contracting. Approval of all Viability Gap Grants for 
Enterprises over $50,000 will be evaluated by a committee comprising HortLangSon, PMU and 
the Service Provider. The HortLangSon Board will formally submit a recommendation to the PPC 
for ratification (see Section VI Competitive Grants). 
354.  Grant eligibility conditions are shown in Appendix 2 of this Manual. These conditions will 
form  the  basis  of  the  final  grant  regulations  that  will  be  prepared  by  the  Service  Provider  and 
endorsed by the PMU. The Service Provider will use the experience of the International Fund for 
Agricultural  Development  (IFAD)  and  their  grant  procedures  and  documents  to  inform  the 
preparation of the Output 3 grant program. 
355.  Grant awareness is a vital task and will need a comprehensive awareness program in the 
first 18 months of Output 3. Awareness will be part of the Product group and value chain planning 
and  development  in  Activity  3.1.7.  The  awareness  program  must  ensure  that  all  value  chains 
members are aware of the Viability Gap grants and that they apply to small as well as the bigger 
agri-enterprises. Further these grants will require evidence of inclusiveness of smaller or more 
remote producers in the value chain. There will also be support provided to some grant applicants 
in  the  preparation  of  their  business  plans  which  will  be  the  core  documents  for  their  grant 
applications.  Particular  emphasis must  be given  to supporting women entrepreneurs  with their 
business plans and applications. Under the smaller Viability Gap Grants for enterprises, women 
entrepreneurs  will  be  encouraged  and  supported  to  apply  for  grants.  Women  entrepreneurs 
include: 
(i) 
(ii) 
women that own and operate small district based processing and trader operations, 
and;  
commune  women  who  want  to  develop  small  businesses  to  add  value  to 
horticultural products produced in their communes.  
356.  The Service Provider will need  to work with the PMU Gender specialist and the district 
Women’s Union with these grants for smaller agri-enterprise development. 
357.  Competitive  grants  also  include  the  Producer  Groups  grants  through  the  block  grant 
mechanism. Details about the Producer Group Grants are in Section VI.  
358.  Following  the  awarding of grants the grantees  will  be  provided  with regular  advice and 
assistance by the Service Provider to implement their business plans.

359.  Disbursement  of  funds  to  successful  grant  applications  will  be  based  on  the  enterprise 
conducting  its  own  procurement  with  its  51%  contribution  used  to  cashflow  and  secure  any 
purchases.29  Once  purchases  are  completed,  procurement  documentation  including  supplier 
invoices,  statements  and supporting product  documentation  will  be  used to  support  an  invoice 
from the enterprise to BIIG1 PMU within DPI. The invoice and supporting documentation will be 
forwarded to the Service Provider who with assistance from the PMU will conduct a verification of 
purchase and installation through a field visit and site inspection.  
360.  The  inspection  will  reconcile  the  proposed  investment  items  within  the  business  plan 
viability  grant  proposal  with  the  actual  purchases  made  with  supporting  documentation,  and 
verifying  that  conditionalities  relating  to  inclusivity  through  value  chain  linkages  have  been 
implemented.  Compliance  with  project  environmental  safeguard  policies  must  also  be  verified 
during  the  site  visit.    Once  confirmed,  the  service  provider  will  make  a  recommendation  for 
payment that will be forwarded to the PMU by the HortLangSon Board of Directors.  
361.  The PMU will action the payment based solely on the verification report. One received the 
PMU will process the invoice in full within the currently monthly transactions.  
362.  The  PMU  will  retain  all  original  documentation  and  use  this  as  part  of  its  record  for 
reimbursement of the advance account using ADB Statement of Expense mechanism. 
29 For grants under $30,000 the business contribution is 20%.

Activity 3.1.7 Trade, Markets and Quality Information 
363.  Output  3  features  a  market  led  approach  to  Product  value  chain  development.  Lack  of 
market and trade information contributes to the viability gap that the horticultural sector members 
face  in  the  growth  and  development  of  their  businesses  and  modern  value  chains.    Providing 
trade and market logistics information to sector members will be one of the core HortLangSon 
functions that will be developed in response. Following the preparation of the sector strategic plan 
the  Service  Provider  will  commence  developing  the  core  HortLangSon  service  functions. 
Development  of  the  service  functions  of  Trade  and  Market  data  and  Quality  Assurance  and 
Compliance systems (Activity 3.1.8- see below) will be coordinated.  Trade and market logistics 
information services will be led by the Market and Trade Logistics expert. The initial emphasis will 
be upon trade and market data for the priority five products identified in the sector strategic plan, 
that will include star anise and safe vegetables.   
364.  Development of the trade and market data services function will be coordinated with the 
DOIT, and must not duplicate the systems and data services that the DOIT has in place. The aim 
will be to develop a market and trade information platform for sector members and this should be 
integrated with the DOIT information system.

Activity 3.1.8 Quality Assurance and Compliance Systems Established 
365.  Quality assurance systems that ensure that the horticultural products meet national and 
international  standards  are  required  for  Lang  Son  to  develop  a  strong  “export”  industry  that  is 
aligned to the markets being targeted. Implementing this activity will involve HortLangSon working 
closely with DARD, DOST and DOIT. All of these departments have made contributions to quality 
assurance systems that some agri-enterprises have initiated. A well-coordinated market linked 
approach is required that enables the products to comply with the highest standards demanded 
by national retail and export markets. It is proposed that the United States of America Food and 
Drug  Administration  act  of  2011  standards  be  set  as  the  benchmark.  HortLangSon,  with  the 
212  
departments, will need to develop a roadmap to achieve this and adopt these standards to those 
required by the target markets. There is some traceability expertise developed in Viet Nam and 
this should be integrated with the quality assurance systems. There are two Service Provider staff 
that  will  lead the quality assurance  development: Quality  Assurance  and Compliance  Systems 
expert, and Post-Harvest Systems and Value Chain expert. As mentioned above the development 
of  Quality  Assurance  systems  will  occur  in  coordination  with  the  trade  and  market  information 
service function. 
366.  Star  anise  will  be  the  first  product  value  chain  to  develop  improved  quality  assurance 
systems for export markets, including traceability. This is to reinforce the market led approach 
under  Output  3  where  star  anise  development  is  an  exemplar.  The  experience  and  lessons 
learned from the star anise development will be applied to the other Product value chains. The 
underlying theme for star anise development is “value not volume” and to be able to compete with 
the Chinese processors on the basis of quality in high value markets. One of the challenges is to 
develop  a  Lang  Son  star  anise  quality  strategy  that  features  natural  production  advantages  of 
Lang Son. This may involve the rationalization of the use of the GI, and Lang Son “trade mark”. 
However,  the  priority  is  to  be  able  to  provide  clear  quality  assurance  to  buyers  and  where 
necessary the ability support this through product traceability.

Activity 3.1.9 Sector Outreach and Education 
367.  Sector  outreach  will  be  the  first  activity  initiated  as  communications  with  the  sector 
members is a necessary foundation for successful implementation of Output 3. The Information 
Systems and Outreach expert and the Team Leader will prepare and lead the implementation of 
the outreach plan. Outreach, however, will be the responsibility of all the Service Provider team 
members  and  they  all  will  contribute  to  creating  an  awareness  of  Output  3  across  the  sector, 
targeted  at  all  sector  members.  BIIG  1  is  an  inclusive  project  and  Output  3  gender  activities 
features the active involvement of women in horticultural sector development that includes the 
213 
farmer producer level, smaller agri-enterprises in the districts and also the larger agri-enterprises. 
Therefore,  the  outreach  programs  must  ensure  that  it  reaches  all  stakeholders,  especially  the 
women farmers and small business operators as well as poorer smallholders. Output 3 design 
and the GAP framework highlights the use of best practice communications methods for working 
with  ethnic  minorities  and  women  and  use  of  techniques  for  low  literacy  people.  The  Service 
Provider  will  ensure  that  its  staff  have  a  high  level  of  competence  in  these  methods  and 
techniques, and that the counterpart staff: district extension staff etc., are also trained in these 
methods and techniques.     
368.  The sector education role refers to education in the widest sense and involves training, 
and HortLangSon delivering an ongoing program to the sector members where they learn about 
what a market led horticultural sector development approach involves. The HortLangSon outreach 
program  will  provide  a  regular  series  of  communications  activities  that  will  ensure  all  sector 
members are made aware of want is involved in a more commercial horticulture sector including 
export  market  requirements,  quality  assurance,  postharvest  management  and  other  modern 
value chain features.  
369.  Training will be delivered based upon formally assessed needs. Developing capacity will 
be  a  big  challenge  for  the  Service  Provider  as  Output  3  introduces  a  whole  new  commercial 
market led development paradigm to Lang Son’s horticultural sector. The focus of the training and 
education program is to develop institutional capacity in both the private and government sectors 
that will meet the evolving needs of an export orientated horticultural sector. The training spectrum 
will be wide and encompass business, marketing and trade, technical production, quality systems, 
leadership and governance.  Training will be more focused in main areas: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
Building the capacity of leading sector members in governance and management 
of sector  organisations –  HortLangSon  and  Product groups. Training for  women 
sector members in governance is the one prescribed training topic included in the 
design (as part of the GAP).   
Star  anise  and  safe  vegetable  Product  value  chain  members  including  the 
Producer Groups – The training spectrum will be wide and encompass business, 
marketing  and  trade,  technical  production,  quality  systems,  farmer  group 
leadership; 
Product  groups  members  i.e.  other  than  star  anise  and  safe  vegetable  Product 
groups in such topics as marketing and trade, quality management etc.; 
Department and district staff –to enhance their sector support roles in such aspects 
as quality assurance, modern production methods etc. 
370.  The  sector  outreach  program  must  be  initiated  once  the  Service  Provider  commences, 
and  will  evolve  as the  outreach  and education  needs are  better  identified.  Main Outreach  and 
Education tasks for the first 18 months are presented in Table 66 below.

performance 
371.  The  aim  of  the  activity  is  to  develop  an  online  system  to  provide  better  data  about  the 
horticultural sector’s production and financial performance. Activity 3.1.10 design and implement 
system  to  monitor  and  assess  sector  performance  should  not  be  confused  with  the  project’s 
PPMS.  Currently  there  is  some  data gathered  by  provincial  departments  on  production  areas, 
output and economic performance, but this does not provide adequate information to plan and 
guide  the  sector’s  development.  For  instance,  there  is  little  information  about  the  quantities  of 
horticultural  crops  that  are  sold  through  the  border  gates  to  China.  DARD,  DOIT,  and  the 
provincial Government Statistics Office will be the main partners in the execution of this activity.   
372.  HortLangSon will develop a coordinated online information system that complements, and 
includes (as much as possible) the data gathered by the Lang Son departments – it must not be 
developed a parallel project only system. The intention is for the provincial departments to learn 
how  to  better  use  the  sector  data  for  planning  and  advise  the  PPC  on  sector  development  in 
partnership  with  HortLangSon.  Data  from  the  Output  3  system  will  be  made  available  to  the 
provincial departments. Using sector data for strategy and planning will be one of the key roles of 
the Sector Transformation group, and used to advise the PPC.

Output 3.2 Star Anise Value Chain Development 
373.  The star anise sub sector was identified by the PPTA design mission as the first Product 
group and value chain to be assisted under Output 3. The PPTA proposal needs to be confirmed 
by  the  horticultural  sector  strategy  exercise  and  associated  market  assessment.  The  market 
assessment must confirm that there are sound market prospects for the star anise products and 
that it is feasible to develop these with the assistance from the project.  It is expected that the 
horticultural sector strategy exercise will confirm the PPTA proposal. But if the proposal to develop 
the star anise sector is assessed as not a viable option then the HortLangSon board and the PMU 
will need to decide the replacement Product and value chain that will be developed. The Service 
Provider will make the recommendation to the board and the PMU. 
374.  All the Output 3 investments will be undertaken under the various Output 3.1 activities. 
The direct investments that support the star anise value chain development are 3.1.6 Competitive 
Grants  (see  above,  and  Section  IV).  The  grants  are  available  for  the  larger  star  anise  agri-
enterprises involved in processing and marketing, smaller star anise agri-enterprises that collect 
and  aggregate,  and  process  star  anise.  The  grants  will  also  assist  the  Star  Anise  Producer 
Groups. Development of the Star Anise Association into a wider functioning Product Group that 
will represent all sector members will facilitated by HortLangSon (Activity 3.1.5).  
1. 
Output 3.2.1: Prepare Plan for Star Anise Value Chain Development  
375.  Star  anise  value  chain  development  must  be  based  around  a  balanced  approach  that 
includes dialogue with the star anise sector members including farmers, and the small and larger 
agri-enterprises. This will be achieved through the star anise Product Group that will be formed 
through  Activity  3.1.4  Product  Groups.  The  development  of  the  Star  Anise  Association  into  a 
product group that is more representative of the whole Lang Son star anise sector will provide the 
basis  for  dialogue  with  the  members,  and  ensure  that  the  contribute  to  the  star  anise  sector 
development.

376.  Preparation of the star anise development plan will be built upon a detailed market and 
trade  assessment  and  the  horticultural  sector  strategic  plan,  and  address  the  issues  that  are 
identified by the star anise Product Group members. There must be wide consultation with all the 
value  chain  members.  Consultation  will  be  achieved  through  the  district  level  Product  Group 
committees,  and  with  assistance  from  the  Lang  Son  Business  Association  network.  Once  the 
Product Groups are formed and registered they will be members of the Business Association. The 
Star Anise Product action plan will define the main actions that will be undertaken. Many of the 
actions will be connected to the Output 3 activities, but there some actions that the Product Group 
may initiate and lead themselves e.g. raising policy issues with provincial departments, or with 
districts. One of the roles of the Service Provider and HortLangSon is to empower the Product 
Group to take increasing responsibility for dealing with star anise industry issues and to provide 
access via the transformation group. The star anise sector development plan and the associated 
action plan  will  be  endorsed  by the  HortLangSon  board. The  plan  will  also be  shared  with the 
Transformation  Group,  the  departments,  and  other  key  stakeholders.  It  is  emphasized  that 
Product Group ownership of the plan is vital and the members use the plan as the basis for the 
development of their business activities.      
377.  Star  anise Product  value  chain development  involves several  activities and there  are  a 
number of different agencies involved. Figure 15 below presents the main stages in the star anise 
value chain and shows:

Implement the Star Anise Value Chain Development Plan 
378.  The  Service Provider  will  be responsible for  the  implementation of the  star  anise  value 
chain  development  plan,  through  the  action.  Development  and  action  plan  implementation  is 
presented the  manual  under two separate  activities:  Activity  3.2.2 for  the  agri-enterprises,  and 
Activity 3.2.3 for the Producer Groups.  
379.  The Competitive grant program is the investment driver for the implementation of the plan. 
It is up to the individual agri-enterprises to make the decision as to whether they will apply for the 
Viability Gap for Enterprises Grants. The other driver for the value chain planning development is 
the provision of business, marketing and technical production support for the sector members by 
HortLangSon, initially delivered by the Service Provider. 
380.  Star anise agri-enterprise will be made aware of the Viability Gap Grants for Enterprises 
(Competitive grants) through the awareness program (Activity 3.1.9) and through Product Group 
activities (3.1.5). Output 3 encourages the wide use of Competitive grants and it is important to 
highlight that Viability Gap grants are not just for the bigger agri-enterprises. The PPTA design 
identified that there are a number of small district based star anise traders and processers that 
have the potential for growth and development. Output 3 will also encourage the development of 
small commune based star anise businesses, especially businesses that are managed by women. 
Commune  members  do  not  need  to  be  members  of  the  Producer  Groups  to  be  eligible  for 
business development support. But they will need to be members of the star anise Product group.

Output: 3.2.3 Star Anise Producer Group Value Chain Development 
381.  The  star  anise  development  and  action  plan  implementation  linked  to  the  star  anise 
producer  groups  is  outlined  in  this  sub  section.  Farmer  membership  of  the  star  anise  Product 
group provides the basis for building the business relationship between the Producer Groups, the 
agri-enterprise and other star anise value chain members: traders, retailers etc. 
382. 
It is proposed that star anise producer groups formed in Year 1 will be based  upon the 
SNV Spice of Life groups in Yen Phuc and Binh Phuc communes in Van Quan district. During 
inception, the Service Provider will assess the potential participation of Yen Phuc and Binh Phuc 
groups. The leaders from the Van Quan producer groups (once confirmed by the Service Provider 
at Inception) will participate in the preparation of the star anise sector development plan.  
383.  To be eligible for project support the producer groups must have a business relationship 
that is consistent with the Product Group’s development plan. It is a condition of the project that 
the producer groups must have an established market relationship with star anise processor or 
marketer. If the producer group does not have an existing established relationship, then a formal 
supply agreement must be formalised. The star anise sector development will consider the issues 
that affect the viability of the Lang Son industry and propose actions that will strengthen business 
relationship  between  the  producers,  traders,  processors  and  marketers.  Developing  and 
strengthening  the  business  relationships  between  the  producer  groups  and  Viet  Nam  agri-
enterprises is a critical part of the Lang Son horticultural sector development strategy.   
384.  Although it is the existing Producer Groups that will be assisted first consideration will be 
219 
given  to  other  star  anise  farmers  joining  the  groups.  This  will  need  to  be  considered  by  the 
Commune  People’s  Committee  in  each  commune,  HortLangSon  and  the  PMU.  The  Service 
Provider will assess the question of Producer Group membership at inception and, if required, 
develop a suitable mechanism for any new group members to join existing groups and be eligible 
for grant funds.   
385.  Assistance through the Producer Group grants (block grants) is the driver for the producer 
group development. Groups will apply for a grant and this will involve the preparation of a business 
plan for each producer group. An outline of the business plan requirements is shown on Section 
VI,  and  will  be  aligned with  the  overall  star  anise development  plan.  Each business  plan  must 
include marketing plan that will define the group’s market relationship with the Lang Son based 
star anise business. Preparation of the business plan for each Producer Group will supported by 
the Service Provider Agricultural Producer Groups and Market Linkages expert.

386.  HortLangSon,  initially  through  the  Service  Provider,  will  have  a  program  of  regular 
assistance to the agri-enterprises that have received grants, and also to the Producer Groups. 
Performance of the agri-enterprises and the Producer Groups will be monitored against the action 
and  the  business  plans.  This  will  be  achieved  through  the  quarterly  reports  and  a  program  of 
regular field visits. Support will be provided on a regular and proactive basis.  
387.  Regular meetings of the provincial and district star anise Product Group committees will 
be  held  that  will  provide  feedback  on  the  star  anise  development  plan  and  action  plan 
performance. The meetings will also provide the opportunity for members to raise issues.  
388.  Once the core HortLangSon services are developed all members of the Star Anise Product 
220  
Group will be eligible for a wider range of assistance. This includes agri-enterprises that have not 
received  Output  3  grants  –  the  only  requirement  being  that  they  must  be  a  Product  Group 
member.  Core  service  such  as  market  and  trade  information,  post-harvest  requirements  and 
quality information will be made available to all Product Group members.

Output 3.3 Safe Vegetable Value Chain Development 
389.  The PPTA proposal for safe vegetable value chain development needs to be confirmed 
by  the  HSSP  and  associated  market  assessment  before  it  proceeds.  The  market  assessment 
must confirm that there are sound market prospects for safe vegetable and that it is feasible to 
develop these with the assistance from the project.  It is expected that the HSSP will confirm the 
PPTA proposal. But if the proposal to develop the safe vegetable value chain is considered not a 
viable option then the Service Provider, HortLangSon board and the PMU will need to decide the 
replacement product value chain that will be developed.  
390.  One  of  the  Service  Provider  Inception  tasks  will  be  to  identify  and  confirm  the  safe 
vegetable  farmers  that  will  form  the  safe  vegetable  producer  groups.  The  most  commercial 
vegetable farmers operate around the Lang Son city area and it is these farmers who may provide 
the best opportunity to initiate the development of a scalable safe vegetable sector in Lang Son.  
The Lang Son city safe vegetable farmers have quite well established market linkages but they 
lack the production volume to develop regular market connections with Hanoi retailers.   
391.  All the Output 3 investments will be undertaken under the various Output 3.1 activities. 
The  direct  investments  that  support  the  safe  vegetable  value  chain  development  are  3.1.6 
Competitive  Grants  (see  above  in Section III  A).  The  safe  vegetable value  chain development 
may  involve only  a limited  number  of agri-enterprises  and  most  of the  investment  and  support 
activities will be for the safe vegetables Producer Groups and their connection with safe vegetable 
retailers. Involving the safe vegetable retailers in the safe vegetable value chain development and 
Safe Vegetable Product Group is essential. 
392.  Preparation of the safe vegetables development plan will be built upon the horticultural 
sector strategic plan, and address the issues that are identified by the Safe Vegetables Product 
Group  members.  There  must  be  wide  consultation  with  all  the  value  chain  members  that  are 
221 
shown  in  Figure  9.  The  Safe  Vegetables  Action  Plan  will  define  the  main  actions  that  will  be 
undertaken.  Many  of  the  actions  will  be  connected  to  the  Output  3  activities,  but  there  some 
actions that  the  Safe  Vegetables  Product  Group  may  initiate  and  lead themselves  e.g.  raising 
policy issues with provincial departments, or with districts. One of the roles of the HortLangSon 
Service Provider is to empower the Product group to take increasing responsibility for dealing with 
star anise industry issues.  The Safe Vegetables Sector Development Pan and the associated 
action plan will be endorsed by the HortLangSon board.   
393.  Safe  vegetable  value  chain  development  involves  several  activities  and  there  are  a 
number  of  different  agencies  involved.  Figure  9  below  presents  the  main  stages  in  the  safe 
vegetable value chain and shows:

1. 
Development  
394.  Safe  Vegetable  value  chain  development  planning  will  be  through  the  Safe  Vegetable 
Product Group formed under Activity 3.1.5.  Preparation of the safe vegetables development plan 
will  be  built  upon  the  horticultural  sector  strategic  plan  and  involve  dialogue  with  the  safe 
vegetable  sector  members  that  include  farmers,  and  any  agri-enterprises  involved  with  safe 
vegetable  value  adding  activities  with  an  input  by  provincial  departments  and  any  service 
providers. The formation of the safe vegetables Product group may take some time as there is no 
formal vegetable sector structure and organization established yet in Lang Son.  The Lang Son 
vegetable  sector  is  dominated  by  a  high  number  of  small  vegetable  producers  spread  over  a 
number of districts. The DOIT has an active involvement with some safe vegetable groups and 
their marketing activities and will be a key partner in developing the Product Group and some of 
the safe vegetable Producer Groups.  
395.  The  safe  vegetables  product  action  plan  will  define  the  main  actions  that  will  be 
undertaken.  Many  of  the  actions  will  be  connected  to  the  Output  3  activities,  but  there  some 
actions that the Product Group may initiate and lead themselves e.g. raising policy issues with 
provincial departments, or with districts. One of the roles of the Service Provider and HortLangSon 
is to empower the Product Group to take increasing responsibility for dealing with safe vegetable 
issues.    The  safe  vegetables  sector  development  plan  and  the  associated  action  plan  will  be 
endorsed by the HortLangSon board.  
396.  Women  undertake  a  high  proportion  of  the  vegetable  production  and  marketing  tasks. 
Consequently, the awareness program and the following sector consultations must ensure that 
women  vegetable  farmers  are  fully  and  actively  involved.  Communications  with  the  women 
vegetable farmers during consultants also needs to ensure that ethnic languages are used and 
literacy constraints are taken into consideration.

Activity 3.3.2. Implement the Safe Vegetables Value Chain Development Plan 
397.  The  Service  Provider  will  be  responsible  for  the  implementation  of  the  safe  vegetables 
value chain development plan, based upon an action plan. The Competitive grant program will be 
a main driver for the implementation of the plan, Safe vegetable Producer Groups will utilise the 
producer group grants (block grants), and there may also be some agri-enterprises that will seek 
to apply for viability gap grants. Value adding in the safe vegetable value chain is encouraged 
and this includes commune level services by small entrepreneurs.  The other driver for the safe 
vegetables value chain plan development is the provision of business, marketing and technical 
support for the sector members by HortLangSon. 
398.  Safe vegetable retailers are important safe vegetable value chain members, as are the 
traders involved in purchasing and transport of safe vegetable to markets. Formation of the safe 
vegetables Product Group, and the subsequent preparation of the safe vegetable development 
plan, must involve all members of the value chain, including the safe vegetable retailers. Many of 
the safe vegetable retailers will be based in Hanoi, and some suitable mechanism will be needed 
to get them engaged in the Product Group.    
399.  Safe vegetable sector members will be made aware of the Competitive grants through the 
awareness  program  (Activity  3.1.9)  and  through  Product  Group  activities  (3.1.5).  Output  3 
encourages the use of Competitive grants at different stages in the value chain. This includes the 
development  of  small  district  and  commune  based  safe  vegetable  value  adding  businesses, 
especially  businesses  that  are  managed  by  women.  In  the  commune  meetings  to  promote 
awareness of the safe vegetable value chain development the opportunity for project support for 
small businesses associated with value adding for safe vegetables must be featured.

be assisted by the HortLangSon Service Provider experts and their field staff. Market linkages 
with  safe  vegetable  retailers  will  be  one  of  the  challenges  for  the  viable  development  of  the 
producer  groups.  A  marketing  agreement  between  the  producer  group  and  one  or  more  safe 
vegetable retailers is required as prior condition for producer group grant approval.

401.  HortLangSon will have a program of regular assistance to the Producer Groups and any 
safe  vegetable  agri-enterprises.  This  included  any  small  businesses  that  have  been  awarded 
grants. The PPTA has observed that the Tu Xuyen commune farmers have limited commercial 
safe vegetable production and marketing experience and will require a high level of support over 
the first two years.   Performance of the safe vegetable Producer Groups will be closely monitored 
through a program of field visits and the groups’ quarterly reports. HortLangSon will have field 
staff based in the districts that will work with the groups as well as the District Extension Station 
and Commune Extension Workers. 
402.  Regular meetings of the provincial and district safe vegetables Product Group committees 
will be held that will provide feedback on the safe vegetables development plan and action plan 
performance. The meetings will also provide the opportunity for members to raise issues.

403.  Once the core HortLangSon services are developed all members of the safe vegetables 
Product Group will be eligible for assistance. This includes safe vegetable production groups that 
have  not  received  Output  3  grants.  Core  service  such  as  market  and  trade  information,  post-
harvest requirements and quality information will be made available to all safe vegetable Product 
Group members (must be Product Group members). Some of the existing safe vegetable Product 
Groups may only need assistance with marketing connections, and post-harvest management.

Other Product Value Chain Development 
404.  Development of other Product value chains will commence during Year 4 of the project. 
The horticulture sector strategic plan will identify the potential commodities that will be developed 
in Year 4 and this will be confirmed at the mid-term review.   
405.  As the project evolves HortLangSon will develop its core functions and provide a range of 
support to members of all the Product Groups. It is highlighted that over the first two to three years 
of  the  project  that  HortLangSon  will  not  just  assist  the  star  anise and safe vegetables product 
value chains members. Widening and deepening the HortLangSon assistance to the horticultural 
sector, through the Product Group structure, is a main Output 3 objective. Value chain members 
must  be  members  of  Product  Groups  to  be  eligible  for  direct  project  assistance.  This  sector 
assistance will commence once HortLangSon becomes established, and its core function services 
become operational. 
V. 
Product Groups and Producer Groups  
406.  Section V Product Groups and Producer Groups is aimed at the staff in the provincial and

Contents of this section 
407.  Chapter V describes the main implementation and operational tasks associated with: 
(i) 
(ii) 
Product Groups; 
Producer Groups.  
B. 
Product Groups 
408.  Background:  Product  Groups  will  be  formed  to  represent  the  producers  and  agri-
enterprises associated with each of the main commodities in the horticultural sector. The Product 
Groups have an important role in Output 3 and the horticultural sector development. The group 
will be inclusive of all product sector members: producers, processors, traders, service providers 
and retailers, with a particular emphasis upon women members.  
409.  Each  Product  group  will  be  the  platform  and  framework  for  the  development  of  their 
product sector. Once the horticultural sector strategy is completed the main Product Groups will 
assisted by the HortLangSon Service Provider to prepare their Product development plans. Star 
anise will be the first to prepare their Product Group development, and safe vegetables will be the 
second. It is proposed that there will be three more Product groups formed with project support 
and  these  will  be  determined  during  the  horticultural  sector  strategic  planning  exercise.  The 
Service  Provider  Inception  Mission  will  assess  the  number  of  Product  Groups  to  be  formed.   
Formation of more Product Groups will be considered at mid-term. 
410.  The role of the Product Group is to provide the forum for the group members to meet and 
work  together  to  develop  a  collective  approach  (for  all  Product  value  chain  members)  to  the 
development of their product sector. The Product Group will provide the platform for members to 
work together on the development of coordinated approaches to Product business and marketing, 
and other issues that impact upon their Product. Only Product Group members will be eligible for 
assistance from the project. 
411.  Preparation  of  the  product  sector  development  plan  will  form  the  basis  for  cooperative 
efforts by the Product group members. Sector development plan preparation will be informed by 
the horticultural sector strategic plan but will address issues directly related to the Product. The 
Sector development plan will enable the members to better identify business opportunities and 
how to access project support in a coordinated manner to capitalise upon these opportunities. 
The sector agri-enterprises and producer group business plans will reflect these opportunities and 
form the basis for the competitive grant applications by the Product Group members.   
412.  Each  Product  group  will  be  aligned  with  HortLangSon  through  a  Memorandum  of 
Understanding,  and  be  assisted  by  the  HortLangSon  Secretariat.  Through  HortLangSon  the 
Product Groups can raise issues with departments and also PPC. They will also be able to access 
the range of service provided by HortLangSon. Horticultural sector members must be a member 
of a Product Group to be eligible for direct support from the project. 
413.  Formation of the Product Groups will be through the following process: 
(i) 
Awareness program – the HortLangSon Service Provider will promote awareness 
227 
about the Product Groups and their role during the inception phase and preparation 
of the horticultural sector strategic plan; 
District  level  awareness  meetings  will  be  conducted.  These  will  be  community 
based and located in communes that are the dominant producers of the product. 
The HortLangSon Service Provider will facilitate these meetings in partnership with 
the district agencies; 
After the awareness program there will be a second round of district meetings that 
will elect up to ten (10) Product group representatives for each district. Each district 
will  be  represented  in  proportion  to  their  level  of  production  of  the  Product  –
HortLangSon will set these levels for each district; 
Criteria  will  be  set  by  HortLangSon  for  the  election  of  the  Product  Group 
representatives from each district. There must be a balance of farmer producers, 
traders and collectors, and agri-enterprises (processors and marketers);  
District  representatives  will  elect  a  provincial  product  committee  that  will  be 
responsible for the Product Group functions. The committee with consist of up to 
12 members that are representative of the Product sector structure. Note:  It is an 
Output 3 requirement that at least 50% of the Product Group representatives are 
women at both district and provincial levels. An initial GAP target is for 10% of the 
provincial Product group leadership to be women. It is also an Output 3 requirement 
that  the  farmers  are  represented  by  bona  fide  farmers  (elected  by  groups  of 
farmers) and not by members of the Farmer’s Union and Women’s Union; 
HortLangSon  will  prepare  guidelines  for  the  membership  of  each  product 
committee and its terms of reference; 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
(v) 
(vi) 
(vii)  HortLangSon will act as the secretariat for each Product Group;  
(viii)  Once  each  Product  Group  is  formed  it  will  become  a  registered  member  of  the

Lang Son Business Association; 
The  PMU,  in consultation  with  the  PPC,  will  appoint  up to three  (3) government 
staff as ex-officio provincial committee members for each Product Group. These 
staff  will  be  from  DOIT,  DARD  and  DOST  respectively,  and  their  roles  will  be 
advisory only. The Product Groups have been formed to give the product sector 
members a greater role in their sector and encourage their empowerment. Thus, 
the department role must be one of guidance and advice.  
414.  Once the provincial Product committee is selected HortLangSon will commence to assist 
the Product Group to develop its vision and sector development plan and the associated Product 
group action plan.  The sector development plan will define the outcomes and targets that Product 
Group wants to achieve, and how these are to be achieved. Preparation of the sector development 
plan will involve district level consultation with the district Product Group representatives.   The 
Product sector plan must be approved by the HortLangSon board. It will also be shared with the 
departments, districts and other sector stakeholders and displayed on the HortLangSon website.  
415.  Financial: Formation and operations of the Product groups will be through HortLangSon. 
The  business  plan  will  present  the  case  for  annual  funding  and  the  HortLangSon  board  will 
approve this annually up to a limit of $10,000 per annum. The primary use of the grants funds is 
to assist the Product Group to facilitate activities that enable them to respond to issues impacting 
upon their Product sector and to take collective action. Conditions of the grant state that grant 
funds: 
(i) 
(ii) 
must  only  be  used  for  group  operational  activities  –  meetings,  workshops  and 
associated consumables etc.; 
cannot  not  be  used  for  wages  or  salaries  for  group  committee  members,  or  for 
228  
business  development  and  marketing  activities.  HortLangSon  will  provide 
secretarial  services  and  any  business  and  marketing  activities  will  be  funded 
through the agri-enterprises, marketing and Producer Group grants. 
416.  HortLangSon will assist the Product Group to form an executive committee and to get it 
operational. It is an Output 3 condition that at least 50% of the executive committee members 
must be women. 
417.  Product Groups will submit quarterly reports via HortLangSon board. Continuation of the 
annual group budget and workplan will be subject to the following: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
Achieving the performance outputs and targets in the business plan; 
Providing timely quarterly reports that include accurate financial records; 
Annual workplan and budget provided to HortLangSon board by 30 October each 
year.  
418.  The first business plan will include the plan for the utilization of the up to $10,000 funding 
for  the  first  year  of  the  Product  group  operations.  The  HortLangSon  board  will  review  the  first 
annual plan and approval will be based upon the recommendation of the Service Provider;  
(i) 
(ii) 
The Product Group will subsequently prepare an annual plan for each year (due 
by 30 October of the year prior to the budget year) of the project that presents their 
annual operational plan (outputs and activities) and the utilization of the product 
grant funds; 
Approval of each annual plan of up to $10,000 budget will be by the HortLangSon 
board.  
419.  Reporting:  Quarterly  reports  will  be  provided  to  the  HortLangSon  board  that  presents 
progress against outputs and activities in the annual plan, any issues arising, and features. The 
report  will  append minutes of all meetings,  and will  also include a financial  statement  showing 
utilization of the grant. 
C. 
Producer Groups  
1. 
Background  
420.  Producer Groups will be formed as part of the Output 3 business development model, and 
will be members of the Product Groups described above. It is expected that the Producer Groups 
will evolve into profitable, self-reliant and resilient commercial groups of farmers groups over the 
life  of  the  project,  and  will  continue  as  commercial  production  groups  after  the  project  is 
completed. Group membership will provide the opportunity for farmers with small land areas and 
low volume of produce to be connected with modern value chains that supply high value markets. 
Through the Producer Group business model the farmers are able to develop stronger market 
relationships, produce better quality products and increase their product prices. Their business 
relationships  will  be  strengthened  through  the  member  of  the  Product  Group.  The  group 
mechanism also increases the efficiency of the delivery of project services to the farmer group 
members. 
421.  The main implementation tasks associated with the Producer Groups and the agencies 
responsible for these tasks are presented in the table below.

422.  Producer  Groups  will  consist  of  new  groups,  as  well  as groups  that  have  been  formed 
under other projects. Regardless of whether new groups will be formed or existing groups will be 
included the following procedures must be followed. 
423.  All  commune members  made  aware  of  the  Project’s Output  3  activities,  what  Output  3 
involves and the reasons for the formation of the Producer Groups.  
424.  Groups will be either new groups or existing groups. In the first three years there will be 
only safe vegetables and star anise groups formed. Safe vegetable groups will be either new or 
existing groups,  and the first star  anise groups will  be  formed  based  upon  the  existing groups 
from the SNV Spice of Life project. This will, however, be confirmed during Inception.  
425.  Where new groups are to be formed commune members will express their interest in being 
a group member. The decision on group membership will be made by the Commune Peoples’ 
Committee with guidance from HortLangSon Service Provider. For the new vegetable groups that 
are formed: 
At least 50% of the members must be women;  
A woman must be either the leader or deputy leader of the group; 
The members must have previous vegetable production experience; 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv)  Group  members  will  be  required to be members  of  the  safe vegetables  Product 
group; 
Their land areas must be contiguous, and; 
(v) 
(vi)  Members must formally commit to the group regulations. 
426.  For existing groups the members will be given the opportunity to decide if they wish to 
participate in Output 3. 
427.  The groups to be eligible for Output 3 support must be aligned to HortLangSon through 
membership of their respective Product Groups.  
3. 
Group regulations 
428.  Producer Group regulations will be mix of core Output 3 regulations and regulations that 
230  
the  Producer  Group  members  propose  and  agree  upon.  Producer  Group  formation  will  be 
managed by the Commune Coordination Group (see Section III C Communes) and overseen by 
HortLangSon. The core Output 3 regulations are: 
(i) 
(ii) 
Be a formal business entity either collaborative group (commune registered) or a 
registered cooperative; 
Group members all agree upon their business and marketing plan and have at least 
one supply agreement with a processor or retailer for supply of product (it is not 
required to have a formal contract); 
(iii)  Management  of  the  group’s  assets,  funds  and  equipment  including  the  assets 
(iv) 
(v) 
(vi) 
provided by the project; 
Compliance  with  the  project’s  regulations  over  financial  management,  financial 
reporting and procurement;  
The  group  must  have  a  bank  account  that  is  verified  by  Commune  Peoples’ 
Committee, and bank account records are included in group’s quarterly reports;    
At least 50% of the group’s members must be women, and a woman must be the 
leader or deputy leader of the group. 
429.  Financial  management  includes how  the group will  manage  working capital  on  either  a 
group or individual member basis. The group regulation document is an official, signed contract 
between group members. It includes agreement for:  
(i) 
(ii) 
Purpose of the group and group composition – this must commit to working as a 
business group;  
Principles for group operations including production, management, marketing and 
accounting;  
(iii)  Management and ownership of group property including cash and equipment, and;  
Rights  and  responsibilities  of  group  members,  group  leaders  and  group 
(iv) 
secretaries. 
4. 
Note:  
It  is  not  a  project  requirement  that  each  Producer  Group  becomes  a  registered 
430. 
cooperative. The size of the groups will vary and for some of the smaller groups there will be no 
financial, marketing  and operational  advantages for  them  to  become  a  registered  cooperative. 
Producer  Groups,  however,  must  be  a  registered  legal  entity  to  be  eligible  for  block  grant 
assistance. Registration may be with the Commune Peoples’ Committee as a collaborative group 
(To Hop Tac).  
5. 
Functional business group.  
431. 
It is common in Viet Nam for farmer groups to be formed so that the members can access 
resources and that subsequently the group does not develop into a functional business operation. 
The group’s business plan is to provide the basis for the group business operations and must be 
followed. If the Producer Group does not function as a business group after it is established it will 
not be eligible for further project support and will be required to return assets provided through 
the project. 
VI. 
Competitive Grants  
432.  Section VI Competitive Grants is an important section aimed at the staff in the provincial 
and  district  agencies,  units  and  departments  and  the  communes  that  will  be  involved  in  the 
competitive grant program implementation including: 
231 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
(v) 
PMU; 
HortLangSon Service Provider; 
Product Groups – especially agri-enterprises; 
Commune Peoples Committee; 
Producer Group leaders and members.

Contents of this Section 
433.  Chapter VI describes the main conditions and implementation tasks associated with: 
(i) 
(ii) 
Viability Gap Grants for Enterprises (includes marketing and innovation grants);  
Producer Group grants. 
B. 
Background: 
434.  Modernization of the  Lang  Son  horticultural  sector  is  constrained by  the limited  access 
that  sector  agri-enterprises  and  farmers  have  to  funds  to  invest  in  the  development  of  their 
businesses.  The  purpose  of  the  Competitive  Grant  program  is  to  assist  agri-enterprises  and 
farmer groups with their access to investment funds and thus address the viability gaps that they 
face.    Competitive  grants  will  be  available  for  enterprise  modernization,  for  small  scale  post-
harvest  enterprises  to  establish  basic  infrastructure  and  systems  for  aggregation,  first  step 
processing  and  quality  assurance.  Market  development  grants  will  also  be  available  for  agri-
enterprises, as will grants for innovations. Producer Groups will also be assisted through block 
grants to build horizontal coordination in the sub-sector and that connects the groups with modern 
value chains. 
435.  Product  groups  formed  for  the  main  horticultural  commodities  and  will  provide  the 
framework for connecting the members within each Product group and developing coordinated 
value chain business activities. Each Product group will prepare their own sector development 
plan that will involve all sector members. Through the use of funds from the Competitive grants, 
and the input of their own funds, the agri-enterprises and producer groups will invest to develop 
the  quality  of  their  products  to  export  to  high  quality  markets.  Modern  value  chains  will  be 
developed that will features high connectivity between producer, traders, processing, retailers and 
other chain members. 
436.  The two categories of competitive grants are summarised in Table 77 below.

C. 
Viability Gap Grant Implementation 
437.  The HortLangSon Service Provider will be responsible to the PMU for the implementation 
of all the Competitive Grants stages – see Figure 17. This will involve the following tasks: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
Finalise the regulations for each of the separate grant programs based upon the 
Grant Eligibility Criteria (Appendix 2 of this Manual) and have these approved by 
the PMU and the ADB;  
Prepare  the  documents  for  grant  applications  –  these  will  be  informed  by  the 
experience of the IFAD grants schemes in neighboring provinces of Bac Kan, Ha 
Giang and Cao Bang. This includes the evaluation criteria for each of the grants;  
Prepare  a  plan  and  timetable  for  the  implementation  of  the  grants.  The  Service 
Provider will advertise enterprise grant availability, conditions and terms, along with 
scope of interest each year from project years 2 through 4. Some grants may be 
awarded after year 4 depending upon implementation and disbursement progress. 
Applications will be made once per annum, unless otherwise agreed by the Board 
of Directors for HortLang Son, the PMU and ADB – this agreement must be sought 
prior to any change; 
(v) 
(iv)  Organise an ongoing awareness program for horticultural sector members about 
the  grant  schemes.  The  awareness  program  must  ensure  that  the  target  sector 
members  are  informed  of  the  grant  schemes,  ensure  they  know  that  this  is  a 
competitive grant scheme and what the criteria are. This includes women farmers 
and women owners of small to medium sized agri-enterprises; 
The  awareness  program  must  also  ensure  that  the  producer  groups  know  and 
understand that the producer group grants are for the development of the producer 
group’s farming business. The producer group must commit to becoming a farm 
production  business  that  has  a  formal  business  relationship  with  traders  and 
retailers;    
Provide  a program  of  support for grant  applicants  to  prepare  their  business and 
marketing plans (see below for more information); 
Form  and  train  the  members  of  the  proposed  evaluation  task  force,  finalise 
(vii) 
(vi) 
evaluation  criteria  and  scoring  systems,  provide  a  timeline  and  performance 
standards for evaluations; 
233 
(ix) 
(viii)  Coordinate  the  evaluation  of  the  grant  applications.  HortLangSon  will  complete 
Due  Diligence  of  the  agri-enterprises  associated  with  each  application.  The  due 
diligence reports for the Multi Product sector level grants and agri-enterpise viability 
grants must be reviewed by the HortLangSon board and given no objection by the 
PPC. For the other grants the PMU will be responsible for no objection based upon 
the due diligence report assessment;      
Notify  the  successful  applicants  and  commence a  program  to  support  with  their 
business development investment activities. Where any application is not approved 
HortLangSon will discuss with the applicants the reasons why the application was 
not approved. Assistance may be provided to assist to revise the application for 
resubmission – this will be based upon the recommendations of the HortLangSon 
board and PMU;  
Monitor business and market plan implementation and provide support and advice 
as required.

438.  Formulation of the evaluation criteria will take into consideration several factors: 
(i) 
For the Viability Gap Grants for Multi Commodities and Agri-Enterprises the PPC 
wishes  to  encourage  investment  from  business  partners  outside  of  Lang  Son 
province – this can include overseas investors. Where local agri-enterprises can 
demonstrate  that  they  have  an  outside  investor(s)  this  will  strengthen  their 
business case; 
234  
(ii) 
(iii) 
Small district based agri-enterprises managed by women will be encouraged – this 
is consistent with the project’s inclusivity theme;   
Contributions  in  cash  and  kind  from  Producer  Groups  will  also  be  taken  into 
consideration in the approval of the block grants. 
D. 
Viability Gap Grants for Enterprises 
439.  Viability Gap Grants for Enterprises consist of two main categories. The first category is 
Strategic Multi-Product or Sector level grant that are aimed at agri-enterprise investment in multi-
use  facilities  to  service  the  horticultural  sector.  Lang  Son’s  horticultural  sector  has  several 
products that all have short seasons e.g. custard apples and litchi. There are no packhouses and 
cool  stores  for  these  products  that  can  extend  the  marketing  season  and  enable  sorting  and 
packing for higher value markets. The aim of the Strategic Multi-Product or Sector level grant is 
to encourage investment in multi-use facilities. 
440.  Viability Gap Grants for Enterprises is the second category and these grants are aimed at 
assisting agri-businesses that want to invest in the development of their businesses. There are 
three main gaps “areas” that the Viability Gap Grants for Enterprises will address: (i) investment 
in  facilities  and  equipment  for  processing  and  drying;  (ii)  market  development,  and;  (iii) 
innovations to enhance product quality and development new products.    
441.  Facilities and Equipment: investment in facilities and processing equipment that will assist 
to overcome the major constraints that limit connectivity with higher value markets. Better facilities 
and  processing  equipment  will  lead  to  better  product  processing,  increased  value  adding, 
introduce and apply quality assurance and post-harvest technologies. These are all required to 
develop modern value chains and connect with high value markets. 
442.  Marketing and market development: to assist the agri-enterprises develop export markets 
for their products. The marketing grants will enable the agri-enterprises to initiate a two  - year 
market develop program where they can market their products at international fairs and to retailers 
and consumers in export markets. Market development grants are not exclusively for overseas 
markets and may also be used to develop high vale markets within Viet Nam.   
443.  Combined and coordinated marketing featuring Lang Sons unique characteristics is one 
of the concepts that underpins the formation of HortLangSon. All the Lang Son agri-enterprise are 
small  as  compared  to  their  international  competitors  and  HortLangSon  will  lead  a  coordinated 
approach  through  the  Product  Groups  to  the  marketing  of  Lang  Son’s  horticultural  produce.  
HortLangSon  will  encourage  and  assist  the  Product  Group  enterprises  to  prepare  joint 
applications for market development activities. This will also involve DOIT as the project evolves. 
Coordination between the DOIT and the Output 3 market development support for the horticultural 
sector is critical to ensure synergies and efficient use of funds.  
444.  Applied innovation development: Encouraging innovation in the horticultural sector value 
chains is considered to be important for sector development. Therefore, the Viability Gap Grants 
for Enterprises will include innovation. The aim of the innovation component is to encourage the 
agri-enterprises  to  contract  research  to  develop  new  products,  and  enhance  their  processing 
(value adding) capacity.

under commercial law, and are not dependent agencies of the borrower or sub-
borrower.

Reporting 
456.  Each successful viability gap grant applicant will be required to submit quarterly reports to 
HortLangSon who will incorporate the relevant points into the overall Output 3 Quarterly Progress 
report. These reports by successful viability gap grant applicants will be required to be provided 
until the grant has been formally liquidated by the business as per project procedures. The reports 
will be based upon the Quarterly Progress Report format and highlight implementation progress, 
issues and solutions, as well as financial progress. HortLangSon will prepare the report template, 
and may also provide assistance with the preparation of the initial reports. 
E. 
Producer Group Block Grants 
457.  Background:  Grants  provided  to  the  Producer  Groups  will  be  through  a  block  grant 
mechanism. The rationale for using block grants is that they provide flexibility for the Producer 
Group  to  decide  upon  their  business  investment  priorities  and  plan  the  best  use  of  the  funds 
provided to develop their farming and business operations. This encourages the Producer Groups 
242  
to make market based decisions, and develop their group into a commercial self-reliant production 
and marketing business.  
458.  Block grant eligibility criteria and conditions are shown in Appendix 2 of this Manual. For 
the  first  Producer  Groups  to  be  formed:  star  anise  and  safe  vegetables,  the  details  of  the 
respective funding packages are also included in Appendix 2 of this Manual. Block grant funding 
packages  for  the  subsequent  Producer  Groups  (that  are  expected  to  be  formed  from  year  3 
onwards) these will be developed by HortLangSon for approval by the PMU. 
459.  Main conditions associated with the block grants for the Producer Groups: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
(v) 
Must be a registered entity; 
Business plan will detail the expenditure upon the eligible items; 
Each group once it is registered must have a bank account; 
Each producer group, and all of it members, must be Product Groups members; 
A  formal  or  established  market  relationship  with  other  Product  Group  members 
must exist. 
460.  HortlangSon  will,  in  consultation  with  the  PMU,  develop  and  revise  (if  necessary)  the 
conditions  for  the  subsequent  groups  based  upon  the  experience  of  the  star  anise  and  safe 
vegetables  groups.    The  block  grant  mechanism  has  been  used  to  provide  flexibility  in  the 
planning of the grant investments. Each group will have differing land areas, topographic features, 
road or track access, and distance to other resources such as water. The production priorities for 
each group may also differ and some may wish to undertake value adding activities. Investment 
will be driven by each group’s business plan and is not conditional upon being included in the 
commune’s New Rural Development plan.     
461.  Funding  and  Investment  categories:  Funding  ceilings  for  all  Producer  Groups  will  be 
$50,000.  Where  groups  have  less  than  ten  members  the  funding  ceiling  will  be  $5,000  per 
member (one household equates to one group member). The Producer Groups will utilise these 
funds on the eligible items listed in the Table 80 below. Each group will prepare their own business 
plan and investment cost estimates. The HortLangSon Service Provider will evaluate the business 
plans  and  determine  their  feasibility  and  viability.  The  amount  of  grants  funds  allocated  to the 
producer group will be decided as part of the business plan evaluation. The HortLangSon Board 
will endorse the Producer Group Business and Investment plan application for approval by the 
PMU.

1. 
Producer Group Business plan  
462.  Each  Producer  Group  will  be  required  to  prepare  a  business  plan  that  will  present  the 
group’s plan for the development of their farming group business. The business plan must reflect 
the Product development plan (for the Product group that the producer group is a member of). It 
is recognized that the Producer Groups lack the expertise to prepare their business plans and 
they will be assisted by Service Provider staff in this task. The business plan will be the basis for 
approval of the project’s financial support for the Producer Group.  Once the Producer Group has 
been formed and registered (as either a formal collaborative group or as a cooperative) the group 
will be assisted to prepare their business plan. 
(i) 
(ii) 
Preparation  of  the  group’s  business  plan  must  be  done  in  participative  and 
inclusive manner that involves all group members;  
The  group’s  business  plan  will  present  the  business  case  for  the  Output  3 
investment in each group through the block grant mechanism.  
463.  Output 3 features a market led approach to value chain development and each group’s 
business plan must be prepared for a five year period and include the following elements: 
(i) 
(ii) 
Consistent with the Product group development plan and explain how the producer 
group will establish its business connections with the other Product group member 
agri-enterprises, including marketing agreements; 
Market  analysis  for  the  group’s  product  that  presents  an  assessment  of  market 
opportunities, market trends and market risks;  
(iii)  Marketing  plan  including  any  formal  market  agreements  and  identification  of 
(iv) 
(v) 
potential marketing arrangements with processors or retailers;  
Production plan that describes the product(s), the production areas and expected 
output;  
Financial analysis that presents the net gross margin per crop per land unit, the 
annual income per land unit and the annual income per group, and per member; 
(vi)  Group  investment  plan  including  both  the  project  investments  through  the  block 
grant and also any investment by the group members either financial (cash) or in-
kind. Please Note: the group’s financial plan must demonstrate how the group will 
manage their working capital to ensure that there are adequate funds available to 
fund  the  inputs  required  for  each  successive  production  cycle.  The  group’s 
business plan must show that the group members will have adequate funds for the 
inputs required for the second production cycle; 
(vii)  Be consistent with the project’s inclusive approach and ensure that the Output 3 
GAP  actions  and  targets  are  addressed  and  that  there  is  compliance  with  the 
project’s social safeguards regulations;   
(viii)  Risk assessment that identifies the main risks and a feasible mitigation plan; 
(ix) 
Identify  any  environmental  issues  and  ensure  compliance  with  the  project’s 
environmental safeguards regulations – especially safe use of agro-chemicals; 
Implementation plan and schedule that details the implementation arrangements, 
timing of the investment activities, and procurement plan. 
(x) 
245 
464.  Evaluation of the Producer Group business plan will be based upon: 
Degree of alignment with the Product Group development plan; 
Technical production proposal feasibility; 
Sound market analysis;  
Financial profitability over a five year period – including funding of working capital;  
Viability gap financing i.e. the block grant is justified;  
Feasible risk mitigation plan;   
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
(v) 
(vi) 
(vii)  Compliance with project environmental regulations. 
465.  HortLangSon will prepare the template for the Producer Group business plan and will be 
responsible for the evaluation of Producer Group grants. The HortLangSon Service Provider will 
prepare evaluation guidelines that will be approved by the PMU and ADB.  
2. 
Producer Group contracts  
466.  Following approval of the block grant the PMU will formalize the grant contract between: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
Producer Group executive with supporting signatures of all members;  
Lang Son DPI (as Project Owner), and;  
HortLangSon Board of Directors.  
467.  HortLangSon will assist the PMU with the preparation of the contract instruments.   
3. 
Financial  
468.  Producer Groups must follow  ADB  procurement shopping  procedures. This  is  a simple 
process that entails group obtaining three (3) documented equivalent quotes, and the selection 
of  the  lowest  cost  supplier.  HortLangSon  (Financing  and  Grant  expert)  will  provide  support  to 
each group with the procurement. The following procedures will apply: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
(v) 
(vi) 
(vii) 
An initial advance (up to 20%) will be provided based on the provision of the three 
(3) quotations for each category of expenses;  
The advance will be paid to the group’s bank account;  
There will be a final payment of the balance (80%) based upon completion of the 
works with a verification report provided by the HLS /PMU team;  
All supporting documentation for the procurement including invoices, statements 
and receipts are required to be submitted to HortLangSon before the final payment 
is processed;  
HortLangSon  will  inspect  the  equipment  procured  and  the  works  to  ensure  that 
they meet the appropriate standards;  
Following the inspection HortLangSon will provide a recommendation for payment 
along with the reimbursement claim to the PMU;   
The PMU will review the claim and make final payment to the group’s bank account 
from the project’s advance account.

A. 
Contents of this Section 
471.  Chapter VI describes the main implementation tasks associated with 
(i) 
(ii) 
Gender policies 
GAP targets and actions 
472.  Background: Design of Output 3 has an inclusive approach that features enhancing the 
role  of  women  in  project  activities  and  ensuring  that  they  equitable  access  to  the  project 
resources. Women play a prominent role in Lang Son’s horticultural sector in both farm production 
and  also  in  the  agri-enterprises. Output  3  will  strengthen  the role of  women  at  all  levels  in the 
sector including in the governance of Product groups and HortLangSon. The Gender Action Plan 
(GAP) outlines the Output 3 gender actions and targets.  
473.  HortLangSon and other associated agencies will follow a gender mainstreaming approach 
to the implementation of Output 3. This approach will ensure that women are actively involved in 
all of the Output 3 activities. The HortLangSon Service Provider will be responsible for ensuring 
that  the  gender  mainstreaming  approach  in  the  implementation  of  the  Output  3  activities  is 
followed. 
474. 
It must  be  noted that  while the  Lang  Son  PMU  has  a Social  Safeguards/Gender  Focal 
Point it is NOT the role of the Gender Focal Point to lead gender implementation in Output 3. The 
Gender Focal Point role will be advised on gender and support the HortLangSon Service Provider 
with  the  gender  main  streaming  work.  The  Loan  Implementation  Consultant  (LIC)  will  have  a 
Gender Adviser who will assist the PMU Gender Focal Point and advise the Service Provider on 
implementation  of  the  effective  gender  mainstreaming  approach  and  will  also  provide  some 
gender training.   
475.  Output 3 contains some gender innovations and that will require the HortLangSon Service 
Provider, the Gender Focal Point and the LIC Gender Adviser to work closely on. These include: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
Governance  Accelerator  program  that  targets  women  and  will  provide  potential 
women  leaders  with  training  to  prepare  them  for  governance  roles  in  Product 
Groups and on the HortLangSon board; 
Producer Group leadership training for women; 
Business and market plan preparation training and mentoring for women involved 
in managing agri-enterprises; 
248  
(iv) 
Field  services  staff  (both  men  and  women)  training  in  methods  of  working  with 
women  and  ethnic  minority  farmers,  including  women  with  low  numeracy  and 
literacy.   
476.  These gender innovations are important to increasing the active participation of women in 
all the Output 3 activities and successful development of the horticultural sector. HortLangSon 
(with some PMU support through the Gender Focal Point) will be responsible for ensuring that 
the  gender  targets  for  sector  development  in  the  GAP  are  complied  with.  These  targets  are 
summarized below in Table 82.

The Women’s Union network in the districts and communes will be a main partner 
for information dissemination;  
Formation of the Product Groups to ensure that women are actively involved, as 
members and in the leadership; 
Formation of the Producer Groups to ensure that women are actively involved, as 
members, and in group leadership; 
(v)  Women agri-enterprise owners and managers are informed of the Output 3 grant 
program (viability gaps and marketing) and able to access assistance to prepare 
business and marketing plans; 
(vi)  Women involved in agri-enterprises (members of the Product Groups) are made 
aware  of  the  governance  accelerator  training  program  and  participate  in  the 
program; 
(vii)  Women  members  of  Producer  Groups  actively  participate  in  the  group  leader 
training courses; 
(viii)  Ensure that technical training course delivery occurs at times that enable women 
to attend. 
VIII.  Performance Monitoring and Reporting

Performance Monitoring 
481.  Performance monitoring of the project will be achieved through the Project Performance 
Monitoring System (PPMS). The Lang Son PMU M&E staff member, under the direction of the 
PMU Director, will be responsible for developing and maintaining the Lang Son PPMS and report 
updated  progress  on  a  quarterly  basis.  The  PPMS  will  include  the  Output  3  performance 
monitoring  there  will  be  four  kinds  of  monitoring:  (i)  implementation  progress  monitoring;  (ii) 
safeguard monitoring; (iii) benefit monitoring and evaluation; and (iv) GAP monitoring.  The PPMS 
Output 3 monitoring will include: 
(i) 
(ii) 
DMF Output 3 indicators; 
GAP Output 3 targets.  
482.  PPMS development and maintenance for Output 3 will also involve the input of the Gender 
Focal  Point,  Agricultural  specialist,  Social  and  Environmental  Safeguards  specialists,  as  well 
HortLangSon. Note: Finalisation of the Output 3 part of the PPMS should be not completed until 
the  HortLangSon  Service  Provider  has  had  the  opportunity  to  contribute.  Development  of  the 
Output 3 part of the PPMS should be completed by December 2018. 
483.  Development  of  the  Output  3  PPMS  section  will  incorporate  additional  indicators  and 
targets  to  supplement  the  DMF  indicators  and  GAP  targets.  These  additional  indicators  and 
targets will be based upon activities in the Output 3 design matrix (Appendix 1). For each of the 
Output 3 sub project data sets will be gathered at the commencement of the sub project and their 
activities e.g. formation of a Producer Group. The main tasks to be completed and responsibilities 
will be as shown in Table 84 below.

analysis of the data for the Quarterly Progress Reports. Responsibilities for the gathering of the 
Output 3 field data are shown in Table 85 below.

486.  HortLangSon  field  staff  will  be  responsible  for  data  gathering  once  value  chain 
implementation commences but will progressively pass over the data gathering responsibility to 
the  Producer  Group  under  the  supervision  of  the  Commune  Coordination  Group.  This  is 
consistent with the Output 3 objective of the Producer Groups becoming commercial self-reliant 
entities. 
1. 
Reporting 
487.  Lang Son as the coordination PMU is required to provide an Annual Workplan Report and 
also  a Quarterly  Progress  Reports  to the  ADB.  Because  Output  3  features  horticultural  sector 
development it differs to the other outputs and the content of reporting will be different to the other 
outputs. Reporting requirements for the project are outlined in the PAM Chapter XI Section C. 
488.  The PMU is responsible for managing Output 3 Annual and Quarterly reporting tasks and 
submission of the final reports to the ADB. Reporting tasks will be delegated to the HortLangSon 
Service Provider and to the PMU staff. 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
The PMU Director will set deadlines for the completion of the reports that ensure 
the reports met the reporting timetable required by the ADB;  
The PMU Director will formalize the HortLangSon reporting responsibilities once 
the Service Provider is contracted. 
The PMU will prepare templates for the Annual Report and the Quarterly Report 
based upon the indicative table of contents in PAM’s Annex E.   
489.  HortLangSon will prepare the relevant Output 3 sections for the Annual Report. These are: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
Progress achieved by Output 3: this will be based upon the DMF indicators, and 
the GAP indicators (there is some overlap between the two sets of indicators); 
Main implementation issues and how any issues affecting implementation are to 
be solved (solutions); 
Updated Output 3 Implementation plan. 
252  
490.  Note: the PMU will need to report upon the updated procurement plan. Once the PPMS 
is established and operational additional data (to the DMF and GAP measures) will be available 
for inclusion in the Annual report. 
491.  HortLangSon will also prepare the relevant Output 3 sections for the Quarterly Progress 
Report. The format for the Quarterly report will follow the Annual report and include: 
(i) 
(ii) 
Implementation  progress  against  the  annual  implementation  plan  and  indicators 
included in the PPMS; 
Implementation issues and actions required to respond to the issues. 
492.  Several indicators (especially the DMF indicators) will not be achieved until later stages of 
the project and therefore the emphasis in the quarterly reporting will be upon the more immediate 
implementation  indicators  and  targets  in  the  PPMS.  HortLangSon  should submit the  Quarterly 
Report to the PMU within 10 working days following the end of the Quarter being reported upon. 
493.  Note:  For both the Annual and Quarterly reports HortLangSon will coordinate with the 
PMU  M&E staff member over reporting implementation progress based upon the PPMS, DMF 
and  the  GAP  indicators.    Similarly,  the  Gender  Focal  Point  will  contribute  to  GAP  indicator 
progress  reporting.  Other  PMU  staff  will  also  contribute  to  the  preparation  of  the  Annual  and 
Quarterly Progress Reports based upon their Output 3 responsibilities: Agriculture specialist and 
the Social and Environmental safeguards specialists.

SUMMARY 
510.  The  Basic  Infrastructure  for  Inclusive  Growth  Projects  will  be  implemented  in  eight 
provinces in the north-eastern and north-central sub-regions of Vietnam (BIIG-1 and BIIG-2, 
respectively).32  They  are  to  be  executed  by  each  Provincial  People’s  Committee  (PPC)  as 
Executing  Agency,  with  their  respective  Departments  of  Investment  and  Planning  (DPI) 
designated  as  project  owners.  The  expected  outcome 
improved  subregional 
competitiveness  through  increased  productivity,  services  delivery,  and  movement  of  goods 
and people.  
is 
511.  Using  ADB’s  sector  project  modality,  representative  subprojects  from  the  range  of 
different  types  of  infrastructure  were  selected  during  project  preparation  to  establish  the 
feasibility  of  proposed  investments  using  a  preliminary  design  and  cost  estimate.  The 
feasibility test includes an assessment of climate risk and vulnerability of the representative 
subprojects. 
512.  The  climate  risk  assessment  identified  the  roads  and  bridges  as  vulnerable 
infrastructure elements due to increased flood risk. The assessment recommends that detailed 
engineering designs incorporate increased flooding risk due to climate change.  The following 
report describes an approach for including climate change in the detailed design of roads and 
associated structures. 
513.  These guidelines serve two purposes. First, they provide background understanding 
on the rationale for re-assessing design flood levels to consider climate change impacts based 
on climate modeling projections. Second, described here are steps to guide DED practitioners 
in adjusting design flood levels. 
514.  Government road design standards specify the estimation of design flood levels based 
on a frequency of occurrence (return period). These are set according to the road category 
and type of structure, both of which reflect local site conditions and forecast traffic volumes. 
The  estimated  design  flood  level  then  determines  the  road  embankment  elevations,  road 
drainage provisions, and vertical clearance of bridge decks.  
515.  The following guidelines do not change the existing national standards. The objective, 
rather, is to provide a cost-effective option to adjust design flood levels using existing design 
frequencies and hydrological formulas— by moving historical climate records in setting input 
parameters to the formulas and models to using projected climate records inclusive of climate 
change. Scientific climate change projections need to be factored into the design process.  
516.  Climate modeling data for the RCP 8.5 scenario is used for deriving the climate change 
projections.33 This scenario represents the most conservative34 assumptions on limiting future 
global greenhouse gas emissions. RCP scenarios diverge in their projected atmospheric CO2 
concentrations  beginning  about  2040s.  For  the  proposed  BIIG-1  and  BIIG-2  infrastructure 
design economic life is up to the mid 2030’s, for which projected climate change should be 
consistent  across  RCP  scenarios.  However,  a  review  of  projected  data  found  some 
inconsistency  in  the  RCP  4.5  scenario  data  relative  to  the  other  scenarios.  Taking  this 
32 BIIG-1 covers four North-Eastern provinces of Bac Kan, Cao Bang, Ha Giang and Lang Son; BIIG-2 covers four 
North-Central provinces of Ha Tinh, Nghe An, Quang Binh, and Quang Tri. 
33  Representative  Concentration  Pathways  (RCPs)  reflect  the  degree  to  which  GHG  emissions  are  actively 
mitigated, stabilized or increased. The four RCP scenarios are identified by their total “radiative forcing”, which 
is  the  difference  between  solar  energy  absorbed  by  the  Earth  and  the  energy  radiated  back  to  space.  It  is 
measured in watts per square meter (W/m2) projected in year 2100 relative to 1750.   
34  Conservative  in  the  sense  that  this  scenario  assumes  there  may  not  be  much  success  in  curtailing  global 
greenhouse gas emissions over the coming decades. 
275 
inconsistency into account, and considering the risk mitigation objective of the guidelines, the 
RCP 8.5 climate change projections were applied.  
517.  Projections  indicate  that  future  rainfall  intensities  are  likely  to  increase.  In  the  BIIG 
provinces,  model-derived  projections  indicate  significant  increases  in  extreme  rainfall 
especially for BIIG1 provinces.  The risk of relying on unadjusted historical rainfall for design 
purposes  is  that  the  structures  would  likely  be  under-designed  and  vulnerable  to  frequent 
disruption  and  damage  during  operation.  Managing  this  risk  is  now  a  priority  in  the 
Government’s transport sector policy framework.  
518.  Design  rainfall  adjustments  presented  in  part  one  of  these  guidelines  are  for  road 
component structures with design frequencies set at a return period of 25 years or less. For 
larger structures with design frequencies involving 50 or 100-year return periods (e.g., large 
bridges), adjustments are necessary though this may require different estimation approaches 
involving more complex hydrodynamic modelling solutions. An approach for dealing with such 
structures will be added as Part 2 of these guidelines for inclusion in the BIIG1 and 2 Project 
Administration Manual. 
519.  The two most important sets of national standards relevant to the engineering design 
of roads and bridges are TCVN 4054:2005 and TCVN 9845:2013. The former applies to the 
design  of  roads  and  highways  in  general,  including  new  construction  and  rehabilitation  of 
existing roads. Its scope also includes both urban roads and rural roads. The most important 
aspect of this standard is that it specifies the design frequency (return period) to be used in 
estimating design flood levels, depending on the road classification and the type of component 
structure.   
520.  TCVN 9845:2013, on the other hand, specifies procedures and formulas for hydrologic 
calculations used to determine the level of road embankments, drainage specifications and 
clearance of bridges above the design flood level. The formulas are based on the one-day 
maximum rainfall  intensity.  After  the  design frequency  for  a  structure  has  been  determined 
with reference to TCVN 4054:2005, the hydrologic calculations based on that frequency are 
done with reference to formulas specified in TCVN 9845:2013.  
521.  These guidelines develop, for the required design frequency levels up to P4 specified 
in the national standard, estimates of daily maximum rainfall for the historical baseline and for 
the period to 2035 that uses climate change projections. This data is then applied to generate 
the expected flood levels and design requirements Steps for carrying out such adjustment are 
described in the guidelines. The framework is shown below. 
522.  Statistical modeling using extreme value analysis was applied to derive design rainfall 
adjustment  factors  for  each  BIIG  province.  The  frequency  analysis  used  the  Generalized 
Extreme Value (GEV) probability distribution function, which showed the best fit to the data for 
the BIIG provinces.

276  
523.  Following the method above, annual one-day maximum rainfall data  were extracted 
from the climate model baseline35 simulation and the climate projection for each province. The 
one-day maximum rainfall estimated at various frequency levels (using the fitted probability 
distribution) were compared between the two periods. For any given design frequency, rainfall 
values corresponding to the modeled baseline and the projection period were then used to 
calculate percentage changes (adjustment factors). The results then used to adjust the actual 
historical rainfall values derived from observation data applicable to a specific subproject site. 
Adjustment factors derived for each province are provided in the guidelines.   
524.  To illustrate use of the guidelines, adjusted extreme daily rainfalls were applied to three 
representative subprojects to assess the extent of modification required—that is, to compare 
with the  unadjusted  conventional  design using  only  historical  rainfall  data. The  cases  were 
selected to represent the range of road categories and terrain among the BIIG subprojects. 
The impact on the design of using one-day maximum rainfall adjusted for climate change are 
summarized below:  
•  An increase of 0.81 to 0.87 meter in water elevation at 5 small bridge locations for the 
Dinh Son – Anh Son mountain road in Nghe An province. The dimensions of 6 of the 
25 culvert locations were increased based on the adjusted design flows. For example, 
at a stream located at Km2+759 the flow increased from 5.17 to 7.37 m3/sec, with the 
dimensions of the proposed slab culvert increasing from 150 x 150 cm to 200 x 200 
cm.  
•  For the Bao Ninh – Hai Ninh coastal road in Quang Binh province, the P4 design flows 
at two culvert sections increase by around 34% after adjusting the P4 value derived 
from  historical  record.  The  flood  water  elevations  increased  by  0.5  to  0.6  meter, 
requiring both an increase of culvert size and a need to raise the height of the road 
embankment. 
525.  For the Boc Bo - Bang Thanh - Son Lo Road in Bac Kan province, the design flood 
flow  at  4  small  bridge  locations  increased  by  36%  to  119%.  Flood  water  elevations  at  P4 
frequency increased by 0.2 to 2.26 meters after adjustment. 
35  The  term  “baseline  climate”  is  used  to  refer  to  the  modeling  simulation  of  the  past  climate,  while  the  term 
“historical climate” is used to refer to the real climate as observed in the past by monitoring stations.

Background 
INTRODUCTION 
526.  The two Basic Infrastructure for Inclusive Growth (BIIG) Sector Projects include BIIG-
1 in four north-eastern provinces (Bac Kan, Cao Bang, Ha Giang and Lang Son) and BIIG-2 
in four north-central provinces (Ha Tinh, Nghe An, Quang Binh and Quang Tri). The Projects’ 
Executing  Agency  will  be  the  Provincial  People’s  Committee  with  their  Departments  of 
Investment and Planning (DPI) designated Project Owners.  
527.  The  projects’  expected  outcome  is  to  enhance  opportunities  for  inclusive  economic 
growth  through  improved  transport  infrastructure  (roads  and  bridges),  improved  services 
(water supply, agricultural productivity), and professionally managed provincial infrastructure. 
Using  ADB’s  sector  project  modality,  representative  subprojects  were used to  assess  each 
Project’s  feasibility  during  project  preparation.  A  climate  risk  and  vulnerability  assessment 
(CRVA) examined the likely effects of climate change on the representative subprojects based 
on their preliminary engineering designs.36 Findings identify roads and their structures such 
as bridges to be the most vulnerable due to projected increased intensity of rainfall leading to 
increased flood water levels.  
528.  Climate change is not explicitly included in Vietnam’s engineering design standards for 
roads and bridges. The standards include hydrologic calculations of the design flood levels 
that are then used to inform the design. The existing standards provide engineering formulas 
wherein  rainfall  intensity  is  a  key  input  that  can  potentially  be  adjusted  for  climate  change 
impacts  on  flood  levels.  The  following  guidelines  provide  an  approach  and  estimates  for 
adjusting the design rainfall intensity at various frequencies or return periods corresponding 
to the road classification and type of structure. 
529.  Design flood levels, determined from hydrologic calculations based on peak rainfall, 
are used for the technical specifications of road component structures including drainage and 
bridges.  The  one-day  maximum  rainfall  is  used  as  a  key  determinant  of  flood  levels  for  a 
specified  frequency  of  occurrence  (i.e.,  equivalent  to  return  period).  The  frequency  of 
occurrence is specified in Government regulation TCVN 4054:2005 for differing categories of 
roads and for differing bridges sizes. The design flood levels are then used to determine road 
level/elevation,  road  drainage  provisions,  and  vertical  clearance  of  bridge  decks  above  the 
floodwater  level.  Currently  historical  daily  maximum  rainfall  data  is  applied  to  estimate  the 
design flood levels for each frequency or return period specified.   
530.  Overall,  climate  change  scenarios  future  extreme  rainfall  events  are  projected  to 
increase in magnitude for any specified frequency or return-period.37  Reliance on historical 
rainfall and past flood events will therefore increasingly underestimate future flood levels. The 
risk of using solely historical data for engineering design purposes to estimate flood levels is 
that  the  resultant  structures  may  be  increasingly  vulnerable  to  recurrent  damage  or  the 
increased potential for some structures to fail.  
531.  These  guidelines  provide  a  method  for  reducing  these  risks  by  applying  climate 
change-adjusted rainfall projections within the hydrological formulas used to estimate future 
(frequency-based) peak flows and flood levels. The underlying set of design standards do not

durability?  (ii)  how  are  these  critical  climate  parameters  projected  to  change  over  the  project  life?  (iii)  are 
existing/similar  assets  already  being  affected  by  increasing  climate  variability  and  extremes?  (iv)  what  non-
climate factors aggravate or mitigate climate change impacts (v) how vulnerable is the infrastructure?  (vi) what 
measures should be incorporated in the detailed design of the subproject?

expected by mid-century. 
a. 
Purpose and scope of guidelines 
532.  The  following  report  serves  two  purposes.  The  first  part  provides  the  rationale  for 
adjusting  design  flood  estimates  based  on  climate  modeling  projections  produced  by 
MoNRE.38 The second part describe steps that DED practitioners can apply to adjust design 
flood  levels  for  climate  change  based  on  design  frequencies  and  hydrological  formulas 
specified in existing national standards.  
533.  Annex A presents the climate modeling for Viet Nam, and Annex B summarizes the 
projections for Vietnam. Annex C presents formulas specified for estimating the design flood. 
Annex D gives details on the extreme value analysis method used to derive rainfall adjustment 
factors.  Annex  F  gives  results  of  recalculating  the  engineering  specifications  of  road 
component  structures  using  climate  change-adjusted  rainfall  applied  to  3  case  study 
subprojects. Annex G gives an overview of hydrological modeling, which is suited to designing 
structures requiring more extreme design frequencies (e.g., P1). 
534.  The  guidelines  apply  current  government  standards  which  stipulate  the  design 
frequencies,  depending  on  the  road  category  and  type  of  component  structure,39  for 
hydrological parameters (flood volume, water level and water velocity) used to determine the 
road  embankment  level,  drainage  system  provisions,  bridge  clearances  and  structural 
supports, and allowable overflow depths on spillway crossings. 
535.  The objective of the guidelines is to provide a cost-effective means for adjusting design 
flood  levels  using  existing  design  frequencies  and  hydrological  formulas  using  forward 
projections rather than solely relying on historical climate records.  
536.  The scope of the design rainfall adjustment factors recommended in these guidelines 
is for road structures with design frequency levels set at a return period of 25 years or less 
(P4 to P10). For larger structures with design frequencies involving return periods of 50 years 
(P2) or 100 years (P1), such as large bridges, adjustments are necessary though this may 
require  different  estimation  approaches  involving  more  complex  hydrodynamic  modeling 
solutions or comparative analysis using similar watersheds.40  
Projected climate change in BIIG-1 and BIIG-2 provinces 
a. 
Climate change modeling approach 
537.  The following section describes the climate change modeling studies used to obtain 
climate change projections at province level. Additional technical details are provided in Annex 
A. The rainfall adjustment factors provided in these guidelines are derived from analysis of 
model-generated climate change projections.  
538.  Global  climate  change  models  (GCMs)  use  greenhouse  gas  emission  scenarios  to 
project  climate  change  in  the  medium  to  long  term.  These  scenarios  define  alternative 
38 For brevity, only a summary of climate change projections is presented in the guidelines. Details are found in the 
CRVA report for each sub-region. 
39 The notation Px (e.g., P4) refers to an extreme weather event with x% probability of being equaled or exceeded 
in  any  one  year.  The  corresponding  return  period  or  recurrence  interval  is  the  reciprocal  of  the  exceedance 
probability. 
40 A future addition to the guidelines is planned to include adjustment for medium and large bridges, including use 
of appropriate hydro-dynamic models. An overview of such models is given in Annex G.

greenhouse  gas  (GHG)  emission  levels  with  typically  four  CO2  atmospheric  concentration 
trajectories  reported  for  climate  change  policy  known  as  Representative  Concentration 
Pathways (RCPs). The projections from RCPs are then used as inputs to GCMs in generating 
climate  change  projections.  GCMs  simulate  the  processes  and  feedback  loops  between 
components  of  the  climate  system  at  global  scale.  GCMs  typically  model  at  low  spatial 
resolutions (more than 200 km) due to computing requirements. 41   
539.  The differing climate research institutions that develop and run these climate models 
use differing assumptions of the global climate system, resulting in differing climate projections 
for  the  same  RCP  scenario  between  models.  The  extent  of  agreement  of  the  projected 
direction and magnitude of climate change across multiple models is considered indicative of 
the “robustness of projections”. 
540.  Global  climate  models  continue  to  be  improved  and  increasingly  are  capable  of 
producing higher resolution projections42. Currently existing GCM outputs remain unreliable at 
sub-regional levels or below. Locations with rugged topography and elevation differences that 
strongly influence climate, as in the case of BIIG-1 north-eastern provinces, limit the direct use 
of existing GCM outputs.  To increase the reliability of climate change impact assessments at 
sub-regional or provincial scale, higher-resolution climate change projections are needed to 
transform GCM output into local or regional projections. 
541.  Downscaling  or  “regionalization”  produces  higher-resolution  climate  projections 
derived  from  low-resolution  GCM  outputs  at  a  scale  of  50  km  or  less.  Such  downscaling 
provides a more precise representation of the effects of local geographic features, such as 
mountain topographies – increasing their applicability and reliability for local planning. 
542.  Dynamical and statistical downscaling methods are used. In dynamical downscaling, 
a  regional  climate  model  (e.g.,  PRECIS43)  is  run  for  a  delineated  sub-region  in  which  the 
boundary  conditions  are  derived  from  a  parent  GCM.  In  statistical  downscaling,  analysis  is 
based  on  statistical  properties  of  the  historical  climate  at  observation  stations  that  are 
correlated  with  gridded  coarse-scale  GCM  baseline  projections.  (Refer  to  Appendix  A  for 
additional explanation on downscaling methods).

Viet Nam Climate Change Projections  
543.  Outputs  from  five  regional  climate  models  have  been  used  by  MoNRE’s  Institute  of 
Meteorology,  Hydrology  and  Environment  (IMHEN)  to  develop  downscaled  climate  change 
projections for Vietnam.44  Each of the five regional climate models used input data from the 
output of one or more low resolution or “parent” GCMs. Among the five regional climate models 
studied by MoNRE,45 the output of the PRECIS regional climate model is considered the most 
reliable and was run using data from the CNRM-CM5, GFDL-CM3 and HadGEM2-ES GCM 
41 A primer on how climate models work, based on expert consensus, is available at the website of the US National 
Research  Council's  Board  on  Atmospheric  Sciences  and  Climate:  http://nas-sites.org/climate-
change/climatemodeling. For a more technical description, refer to Chapter 9 of the IPCC’s Assessment Report 
No. 5 (2013): Evaluation of Climate Models. 
42  Improvements  in  climate modelling are  heavily  reliant on  the  computing  power  provided  by  supercomputers, 
such as the Earth Simulator in Japan.   
43 PRECIS was developed at the UK Met Office Hadley C enter with the purpose of enabling users in developing 
countries to easily produce detailed climate projections for any chosen region of the world.

Hanoi, 2016. The summary report is in English; the full report in Vietnamese. Details of MoNRE’s 2016 climate 
change database and how it was set up are described in Annex A, which also provides a guide on interpreting 
the scenarios and modeling outputs. 
45 Referring to page 39 of the MoNRE climate change full report indicated that the results of rainfall calculations 
show differences between the models for climatic regions of Vietnam, and that the PRECIS model gave results 
that were judged more reliable compared with the other models.

models.  The  regional  climate  models  produced  three  sets  of  high-resolution  climate 
projections under each particular regional climate model. 
544.  For these guidelines, the output from the three GCMs downscaled using PRECIS are 
used  to  generate  forecasts  of  future  daily  maximum  rainfall  at  various  frequencies  under 
climate  change  conditions.  These  projections  relative  to  the  current  baseline  climate 
conditions are used to develop the adjustment factors.  
545.  MoNRE’s database on downscaled climate projections for Viet Nam used two of the 
four RCP CO2 concentration scenarios, namely: RCP 4.5 representing a CO2 concentration 
pathway  based  on  moderate  levels  of  GHG  emissions  mitigation,  and  RCP  8.5  which 
represents the pathway without effective mitigation of future GHG emissions resulting in strong 
warming by the end of century.  
546. 
In terms of projected atmospheric CO2 concentrations, the RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios 
differ little up to 2040. Thereafter, their projections diverge as emission levels under RCP 4.5 
assumptions  stabilize,  emission  levels  under  RCP  8.5  continue  to  increase.  Given  that  the 
purpose is to mitigate risk of climate change by ensuring that infrastructure engineering design 
is resilient, these guidelines apply climate projections derived from RCP 8.5. 
547.  Data  for  each  of  the  BIIG-1  and  BIIG-2  provinces  from  the  downscaled  model 
projections for the annual maximum daily rainfall covering the (i) baseline (1986 to 2005), (ii) 
early  century  (2016  to  2035),  and (iii)  mid-century  (2046  to  2065). These  were  used in the 
climate risk and vulnerability assessments up to mid-century for the two BIIG projects.  
548.  The  need  for  climate  change  risk  adjustment  is  demonstrated  for  the  BIIG1  and  2 
project provinces with the projected daily maximum rainfall compared to the current baselines 
rainfall levels – see Table 86. The annual daily maximum rainfall within the average of three

550.  The  considerable  differences  between  provinces  for  projected  change  in  rainfall 
intensity  support  the  recommendations  from  a  recent  hydrological  study  (Doan  Thi  Noi, 
201647) that question the use of the 18 climate sub-regions48 specified in TCVN 9845:2013. 
The use of a limited number of climate sub-regions results removes the significant variance 
between provinces leading to design bias. 
Viet Nam engineering design standards 
a. 
Government-mandated engineering standards  
551.  The transport sector Climate Change Action Plan for the period 2016 to 2020, prepared 
by  the  Ministry  of  Transport  (MoT,  2015)  aims  to  continually  assess  the  impact  of  climate 
change  on  the  country’s  transportation  system;  identify  suitable  adaptation  measures  for 
transport construction works; and mobilize international resources to support the application 
the solutions to mitigate and adapt to climate change.  In support of this plan, the MoT has 
issued supporting decisions to clarify objectives and pave the way for climate change impacts 
be addressed through improved road standards and specifications.49 To date, no road-specific 
engineering design guidelines for climate change resilience have been issued.   
552. 
In  Vietnam,  the  Ministry  of  Science  and  Technology  (MoST)  is  responsible  for 
reviewing and approving national standards for application in various sectors. There are also 
sector-specific national standards, referred to as branch standards, such as those issued by 
MoT for the design of roads and bridges. Development of national standards is carried out by 
committees  and  working groups  composed  of  technical  experts  and  standards  developers. 
After  undergoing  a  series  of  draft  preparation  and  review  by  stakeholders,  the  Ministry  of 
Science and Technology exercises final authority to approve and issue the standard. 
553.  The two national standards relevant to the engineering design of roads and bridges 
are TCVN 4054:200550 and TCVN 9845:2013. The former applies to the design of roads and 
highways, including new construction and rehabilitation of existing roads. Its scope includes 
both  urban  and  rural  roads.  Roads  are  categorized  into  classes  based  on  expected  traffic 
volumes.51  The  standard  specifies  the  design  frequency  (or  return  period)  to  be  used  in 
estimating  design  flood  levels,  depending  on  the  classification  of  the  road  and  the  type  of 
structures associated with it – see Table 87.  
554.  TCVN  9845:2013,  specifies  procedures  and  formulas  for  hydrologic  calculations, 
which  for  roads  are  used  to  determine  road  embankment  elevations,  road  drainage 
specifications and clearance of bridges above the design flood level. TCVN 9845:2013 is a 
consolidation of previous ministerial branch standards dealing with hydrologic calculations for

Scientific methodology to compute designed flood for transportation infrastructure in the northeast mountainous 
region of Viet Nam”. Water Resources University, Hanoi Viet Nam.  
48 There are 18 climate subregions covering Viet Nam, as defined by MoNRE. 
49  MoT  Decision  No.  1456  /  QD-BGTVT  of  11  May  2016  clarified  that  the  specific  objective  is  to  integrate  the 
implementation of measures to improve resilience to climate change in transport investment projects, which is 
to be pursued in parallel with expanding the country’s transport infrastructure. 
50 The coding of a national standard consists of three fields: the first field shows the letter code indicating the type 
of standard (for example, national standards are assigned the code TCVN). The second field contains a number 
that identifies the standard in the order of issuances, and the last field indicates the year when the standard was 
approved. 
51 The previous version of TCVN 4054 (2005) was issued in 1998. This standard was developed by a Technical 
Subcommittee  on  Highway  Transportation  Works  based  on  MoT’s  recommendations.  The  standard  was 
approved by the General Department of Standard, Metrology and Quality Control of the MoST, which officially 
issued it.

water-based infrastructure, including those previously issued by the MoT pertaining to roads 
and bridges (e.g., 22 TCN 272-05 for bridges).   
555.  A  key  parameter  specified  under  TCVN  4054:2005  is  the  frequency  of  the  one-day 
maximum rainfall, where Px represents the probability “x” with which an event is equaled or 
exceeded in any one year, and is equal to the reciprocal of the return period in years. The 
specified Px frequency level determines the magnitude of the design rainfall, which is used to 
determine the design flood level calculated using hydrologic formulas as provided in TCVN 
9845:2013.  The  Px  frequency  levels  are  set  according  to  the  road  category  and  type  of 
component structure – see Table 87. 
556.  The  guidelines  use  a  projected  maximum  daily  rainfall  level  for  the  required  Px 
frequency specified in the national standard. The procedure for such adjustment is explained 
in Section IV below. 
557.  After the Px frequency for a structure has been determined with reference to TCVN 
4054:2005, the hydrologic calculations based on that Px frequency use formulas specified in 
TCVN 9845:2013. To illustrate, under TCVN 9845:2013, the design water discharge at any 
given road location, e.g., a small bridge, is estimated using the formula below, in which the 
parameter Xnp represents the one-day maximum rainfall amount at the Px frequency specified 
for the type of structure and classification of road. 
558.  Definitions  of  the  other  parameters  in the  formula  above,  including  other  hydrologic 
formulas that depend on the Px parameter, are shown in Appendix C. These formulas were 
applied to three representative BIIG subprojects (details shown in Appendix F) as case studies 
to demonstrate the effect of adjusting the design rainfall intensity for projected climate change.  
The  guidelines  use  a  projected  maximum  daily  rainfall  level  for  the  required  Px  frequency 
specified in the national standard. The procedure for such adjustment is explained in Section 
IV below.

559.  Under certain conditions the Px design frequencies in Table 87 can be adjusted. These 
conditions  are  identified  as:  (i)  technical  difficulties  in  complying  with  the  standard,  the 
calculated frequencies may be relaxed (e.g., from P4 to P5) subject to approval by relevant 
authorities, although these are not identified, and (ii) if, during field investigation or surveying, 
historic maximum flood water levels are found to be  higher than the flood levels calculated 
through frequency analysis, the historic flood water is to be used, especially for designing large 
bridges.  No  opportunity  is  provided to adjust the design frequencies for  financial  budget  or 
cost constraints. 
560.  Further  adjustment  is  available  for  category  5  roads  only.  For  category  5  the  road 
elevation may allow the road to be overtopped. This applies to crossings53 over a wide and flat 
river bed with shallow depth, over waterways where water is not fast-flowing, and at localized 
depressions. Such “submersible” road sections can be combined with culverts (usually box-
type)  to  allow  water  to  pass  underneath  and  reduce  water  depth  over  the  crossing.  The 
maximum permissible water depth above the top of submersible road sections are specified 
in terms of expected water velocity at the crossing and the type of vehicle – see Table 88.

Climate resilient planning and design challenges  
b. 
561.  Design  engineers  in  Vietnam  are  aware  of  climate  change  issues,  but  they  find  it 
difficult to incorporate climate change effects for a variety of reasons: a lack of measured flow 
and flood level data for the vast majority of rivers, difficulty in accessing projections data on 
daily maximum rainfall or flood levels, the additional costs incurred by local design consultants 
that  are  not  reflected  in  the  detailed  design  cost  norms  followed  in  the  sector,  and  the 
perceived uncertainty surrounding the considerable range of projections derived from different 
climate change models and scenarios. 
562.  The future magnitude of rainfall change remains uncertain,54 however, the direction of 
change  (that  of  increasing  rainfall  intensity)  appears  unequivocal.  While  available  climate 
models do not reliably predict rainfall extremes at local (site-level) scale, the scientific basis 
for intensifying extremes is well-established and there is consensus among climate models for 
increased rainfall intensity. 
563.  The  guidelines  provide  an  affordable  procedure  to  incorporate  climate  risk  into  the 
design  of  site-specific  infrastructure.  The  guidelines  are  presented  in  two  Parts.  Part  One 
presents the recommended approach for small structures or roads categories 3, 4, and 5 the 
require P4 and P10 frequency for estimation of flood levels. Part Two provides guidelines for 
structures requiring P1 and P2 frequency levels in the estimation of flood and flow rates.  
53 Also referred to as “spillway” crossings in the subproject feasibility studies. 
54 Change in rainfall intensity, in particular, cannot be predicted with precision and accuracy at sub-regional scale, 
but always within a range of uncertainty. 
284  
Frequency analysis for adjusting the design rainfall 
a. 
Extreme value analysis method 
564.  Extreme value analysis (EVA) provides a method for the analysis of rare events that 
lie  in  the  tails  of  probability  distributions.  EVA  estimates  the  probability  of  events  that  are 
more extreme than may have previously been observed. The following section presents the 
use of this analysis to estimate projected daily maximum rainfall adjustments for a P4 rainfall 
intensity  that  is  applied  in  the  TCVN  engineering  design  formulas  to  estimate  design  flood 
levels  for  basic  structures  (road  embankments,  drainage  system,  spillway-crossings,  and 
small bridges) associated with road categories 3, 4 and 5.  
565.  Rainfall  intensity-frequency-duration  (IFD)  relationships  are  currently  derived  from 
historical rainfall records and assume future rainfall will mirror the statistical characteristics of 
the  historical  rainfall  record.  Climate  modeling  projections  invalidate  this  assumption  with 
climate  change  suggesting  historical  rainfall  IFD  relationships  are  likely  to  be  increasingly 
unreliable predictors of future flood levels.  
566.  As explained in Annex D, extreme value analysis used a Generalized Extreme Value 
(GEV) probability distribution function that provided the best fit to data according to statistical 
tests using the BIIG datasets. Annex D also explains the underlying theory and procedure for 
fitting statistical models based on extreme value analysis. For these guidelines, the analysis 
used  modeled  rainfall  data—specifically,  the  climate  models  and  climate  change  scenario 
explained above. 
567.  The  random  variable  used  for  the  extreme  value  analysis  was  the  annual  one-day 
maximum rainfall data extracted from the climate model baseline55 simulation (1986-2005) and 
the climate projection for 2016-2035 based on RCP8.5. Daily maximum rainfall at a range of 
frequency  levels  derived  from  the  GEV  probability  distribution  function  were  compared 
between  the  two  periods.  For  a  given  Px  frequency  level,  values  corresponding  to  the 
maximum daily rainfall in the modeled baseline period and in the projected period were used 
to calculate percentage adjustments. The percentage adjustments are used to adjust values 
derived from conventional frequency analysis of historical rainfall data for the site – see Figure 
18. The steps are further explained below, and results for each province are tabulated and 
charted in Appendix E. 
Figure 18. Procedure flow chart for deriving design rainfall adjustment 
55 In these guidelines, the term “baseline climate” is used to refer to the modeling simulation of the past climate, 
while  the  term  “historical  climate”  is  used  to  refer  to  the  real  climate  as  observed  in  the  past  by  monitoring 
stations. A climate model’s predictive ability is fine-tuned by adjusting its baseline simulation so that it matches 
the historical climate as much as possible.

568.  The Px notation used in the TCVN standards represents the probability  of an event 
being equaled or exceeded in any one year. The theoretical return period is the reciprocal of 
that probability.  For example, a 25-year event has a 1/25=0.04 or 4% chance of being equaled 
or exceeded in any year, denoted by P4. 
569.  A 25-year event does not mean that it will happen regularly every 25 years, or only 
once in 25 years. Even though the term "return period" connotes a fixed interval, it is not. In 
any given 25-year period, a P4 or 25-year event may occur once, twice, more, or not at all, 
and each outcome has a probability that can be computed.56  
570.  Ten  or  more  years  of  data  are  ideally  required  to  perform  a  frequency  analysis  for 
determining return periods that can be supported statistically. A longer time series increases 
the  reliability  of  the  frequency  analysis  and  provides  more  confidence  in  the  results.  The 
extreme value (frequency) analysis for developing these guidelines used a 20-year time series 
for each time block.  
c. 
Proposed climate risk adjustment factor  
571.  Percentage adjustments  recommended in these guidelines  are  applied  to  the  Basic 
Infrastructure for Inclusive Growth Sector Project (I) and (ii) provinces. Annex E presents the 
estimated change between the baseline and projected future one-day maximum rainfall under 
RCP 8.5. Each province-level assessment is presented in one graph comparing five datasets 
- one for the baseline, one for of the three PRECIS model simulations projecting rainfall, and 
one being the average across the three projections. The proposed adjustment factor is the 
percentage change (increase) between the baseline and the average of the three modeling 
projections.  
572.  Table 8989 (BIIG-1) and  
Table 9090 (BIIG-2) present the percentage adjustment factors for one-day maximum rainfall 
across a range of Px frequency levels.57 A feature of the datasets is significant differences in 
the level of adjustment between provinces highlighting the importance of downscaling climate 
change projections for a province rather than the 18 climatic zones used in the TCVN standard.  
573. 
In summary,  P4 frequency  specified  in TCVN  4054:2005 for the type  of structure  is 
used  in  the  TCVN  9845:2013  hydrological  formulas  using  one-day  maximum  rainfall  as 
parameter  to  determine  the  design  flood  level,  which  is  in  turn  used  to  design  the  road 
embankments, assess drainage system requirements, and estimate vertical clearances above 
the design flood level for small bridges.58 The recommended adjustments are in terms of the 
percentage increases to be applied to the P4 rainfall amounts derived from actual/historical 
rainfall data for the site. 
Table 89. Computed percentage increase relative to baseline 1-day maximum rainfall 
(BIIG-1) 
56 The probability P that one or more events occurring during any period (n) will exceed a given threshold can be 
expressed, using the binomial distribution, as P = 1 – (1 – 1/T)n, where T is the threshold return period (e.g. 50-
yr), and n is the number of years for the period being examined. Using this equation, there is approximately a 
63% chance of one or more 100-year events occurring in any 100-year period. Using the equation, we can also 
calculate that the probability of a 100-year flood occurring during a 25-year period (say, the project life) is 22%. 
57 Note that these values are derived from climate model data which use grid point values that are assumed to 
represent area averages. They should not be expected to closely match station-based climate data collected at 
specific sites (point values). However, their statistical properties (mean, variance) are expected to be similar. 
58 Note that the setting of the spillway top elevations for submersible crossings over shallow streams is based on 
P10 design frequency.

574.  Beyond  P4,  that  is,  for  very  low  frequency  events  (P1  and  P2)  used  for  designing 
medium to large bridges, the computed percentage adjustments shown in Tables 89 and 90 
may  be  unreliable.  The  sites  of  medium  to  large  bridges  typically  involve  relatively  large 
drainage basin areas for which the relationship between Px rainfall and Px flood level may be 
weak. 59  
Steps for adjusting design of structures requiring P4 to P10 frequency 
A. 
Applying the guidelines 
575.  A  step-wise  implementation  of  the  guidelines  is  presented  below  for  adjusting  the 
historically  derived  rainfall  data  for  input  to  hydrological  formulas  specified  in  TCVN 
9845:2013,  specifically  for  structures  that  are  required  to  be  designed  with  P4  rainfall 
frequency. 
•  Determine from TCVN 4054:2005 the applicable Px design frequency level for the road 
category  and  component  structure  being  designed—specifically,  identify  those 
components requiring a P4 (or higher, e.g., P10) design frequency. 
•  From the subproject site’s historical record of rainfall, assemble a time series of 1-day 
maximum rainfall (in mm/day) for a minimum of 10-years. In general, the return period 
being projected should not be more than about two times the length or duration of the 
time series data. 
•  Complete a data quality and verification check of the historical rainfall data to identify 
gaps  and  outliers.  The  data  set  needs  to  be  fully  populated  if  the  fitted  probability 
distribution  function  is  to  be  robust.  The  sensitive  nature  of  the  distribution  to  the 
completeness  of  the  time  series  often  requires  decisions  regarding  the  inclusion  or 
non-inclusion of outliers.60  
59  There  is  also  no  significant  correlation  found  between  the  time  series  pairs  of  annual  maximum  rainfall  and 
maximum  river  flow/level  in  the  historical  data  for  large  (gauged)  basins  in  the  BIIG  provinces.  Incongruent 
correlations of maximum rainfall and runoff can be expected where the basin is large, as earlier explained. In 
any case, P1 and P2 design flows/levels that apply to bridges that traverse rivers draining large basins are not 
customarily  determined  using  empirical  rainfall-runoff  formulas,  unlike  for  small  basins  in  which  the  use  of 
empirical formulas to relate (P4) peak rainfall to peak flow is applicable. 
60 Another approach is to calculate the P4 values with and without the outliers to assess the differences. 
287 
•  Check for any “jumps”, or “outliers” outside gradual shifts in data values that may be 
caused by (non-climate) factors like station relocation, and changes in instrumentation 
or observation practices.61  
•  Calculate  the  Px  daily  maximum  rainfall  by  conducting  an  extreme  value  frequency 
analysis62  of  the  historical  data—that  is,  calculate  the  value  corresponding  to  the 
required  Px  frequency  level  which  serves  as  the  historical  reference  value  (that  is, 
based  on  the  existing  climate)  and  which  needs  to  be  adjusted  for  climate  change 
impact.  
•  Calculate  the  adjustment  factor  being  the  percentage  increase  in  daily  maximum 
rainfall for a given rainfall frequency as the change between the projected time period 
(specified as the economic life of the infrastructure) and the baseline data set. 
•  Adjust the historical reference value above using the percentage adjustment factor for 
the province in which the planned subproject is located (Table 89 and  
•  Table 90). To adjust the baseline value, simply add the adjustment factor (as percent 
increase in decimal) from the tables. 
             Adjusted design rainfall = (Historical reference value) x (1 + adjustment factor63) 
•  Use the adjusted one-day maximum rainfall (corresponding the specified Px frequency 
level) as input to the hydrological formula in TCVN 9845:2013 to estimate the climate 
change-adjusted design flood level.  
•  Use the adjusted design flood level in the setting the technical specifications for the 
structure being designed. 
B. 
An application of the guidelines to selected BIIG-1 and BIIG-2 subprojects 
576.  As a case study to highlight the impact of the P4 adjustment the estimated adjustment 
factor was applied to three BIIG1 and 2 representative road subprojects. These roads are all 
under  categories  4  and  5.  Adjustment  factors  for  the  one-day  maximum  rainfall  parameter 
were applied in the hydrologic formulas specified in TCVN 9845:2013 to assess the impact on 
the engineering specifications for the road embankments, drainage systems and small bridges 
that are subject to P4 design frequency, as specified in TCVN 4054:2005. Adjustments to the 
P1 and P2 structures (medium and large bridges) were not calculated. 
577.  The case-subprojects are summarized in  
Table 9191.

Twenty-one km of existing rural road  will be upgraded to  category 5 mountain 
road meeting TCVN 4054-05 standards: 6.5 m road base width, 3.5 m surface 
width, and 1 m hard shoulder each side. Pavement is 3.5 cm asphalt, with 15 cm 
base  and  18  cm  sub-base.  The  road  cuts  through  the  slopes  of  hills  with 
interweaving rock and soil formations. Six small slab bridges (6 m long) are to be 
upgraded, and 2 new medium-size bridges (33 m and 48 m) are to be constructed 
along the route. The P4 adjustment factor for this subproject was an increase of 
62% above the historical baseline value of the one-day maximum rainfall (Table 
89).

The existing 8-km asphalt road is badly degraded due to traffic volume and the 
axle weight of trucks. The traffic forecast indicates the need for a higher category 
61 This test is for so-called “stationarity” or time homogeneity. A non-stationary process has a variable variance and 
a  mean  that  does  not  return  to  a  long-run  mean  over  time,  whereas  a  stationary  process  reverts  around  a 
constant long-term mean and has a constant variance independent of time. Such changes are easy to identify 
by plotting the time series data and using a Excel built-in function to detect trend, if any. 
62 Refer to Annex D, Section B, for the extreme value frequency analysis procedure using the Generalized Extreme 
Value probability distribution function and the equations used to estimate parameters.

IV road design and the project owner has agreed to apply this during the DED. 
The route passes through some densely populated sections, agricultural fields 
and flat lands. There are 3 existing bridges plus a causeway that will be replaced 
with  a  bridge.  Longitudinal  and  cross  gradients  are  not  high,  and  the  existing 
subgrade has been assessed as suitable. Surfacing will be with asphalt concrete. 
The P4 adjustment factor for this subproject was an increase of 38% above the 
historical baseline value of the one-day maximum rainfall (Table 90). 
The  existing  coastal  road  is  unpaved.  The  road  is  to  be  improved  to  support 
tourism access. Upgrading to category 5 plain road involves widening to 7.5 m, 
adding 2 layers of base (14 cm) and sub-base (16 cm), and surfacing with 7 cm 
of  asphalt  concrete.  When  finished,  the  10.6  km  road  will  have  a  road-top 
elevation ranging from 4.1 to 9.9 m above mean sea level. A new 600-m section 
will provide a commune bypass is to be constructed at the southern end of the 
alignment.  Two  spillway-culvert  crossings  will  be  replaced.  Twenty-eight  new 
culverts are proposed in addition to the 15 existing culverts. The P4 adjustment 
factor for this subproject was an increase of 26% above the historical baseline 
value of the one-day maximum rainfall (Table 90). 
578.  The detailed results of applying the climate change-adjusted P4 design rainfall to the 
cases  above  are  presented  in  Appendix  F.  The  following  case  summaries  highlight  the 
important changes that result from the climate change-adjusted P4 one-day maximum rainfall 
parameter. 
579.  For the Boc Bo - Bang Thanh - Son Lo Road in Bac Kan Province, the design flood 
flow at four small bridge locations was increased by 36% to 119%. Flood water elevations at 
P4 frequency increased by 0.20 to 2.26 meters after adjustment, which will require raising the 
elevation of the road embankment at the corresponding sections. The changes in key design 
parameters of the four small bridges are shown in Table 92.

580.  The recalculation of P4 flood water levels at five flood prone sections along the Dinh 
Son – Anh Son mountain road in Nghe An province resulted in an increase of 0.81 to 0.87 
meter in water elevations. The results for the sections examined are shown in Table 93. At the 
small bridge location in Dong Dau (Km2+108.26), the calculated peak flow increased from 89 
m3/s to 102 m3/s. Calculated floodwater level there at P4 frequency increased from 16.1 m 
using historical data to 16.9 m under RCP 8.5 climate change scenario. The corresponding 
design aperture of the bridge increased from 10.0 m to 12.3 m.

581.  At the Nghe An road subproject, the dimensions of the culverts at 25 locations were 
recalculated with results showing an increase in required culvert sizes at 6 of the 25 locations. 
For example, the calculated design flows at a stream located at Km2+759 increased from 5.17 
to 7.37 m3/sec, resulting in sizing up the dimensions of the slab culvert from 150 x 150 cm to 
200 x 200 cm.  
582.  For the Bao Ninh – Hai Ninh coastal road, the P4 design flows at two culvert sections 
increased by around 34% after applying the P4 climate change adjustment. The flood water 
elevations increased by 0.5 to 0.6 meter, which imply a need to correspondingly raise the level 
of  the  road  embankment  to  provide  adequate  freeboard.  The  flow  velocities  at  these  two 
culvert locations increased by around 10%, indicating need to strengthen the culvert aprons 
and wing walls. 
290  
  Additional DED guidelines for climate resilience 
583.  As  discussed  above,  preliminary  engineering specifications for the road subprojects 
(and associated bridges), which were assessed to be the most vulnerable to climate change 
impact and which account for 75 to 80% of the project investment cost, need to be re-assessed 
during  DED  to  check  for  robustness  to  higher  design  floods,  based  on  hydro-climate 
projections derived from modeling. This adjustment is deemed as the most important climate 
resilience measure for the project. 
584.  Other road structure vulnerabilities were identified in the climate risk and vulnerability 
assessments done earlier for BIIG-1 and BIIG-2 which examined representative subprojects 
to identify specific concerns and corresponding response measures.  
585.  The  most  important  of these  concerns  were found  to  be: (i)  culvert  placements  and 
their fortification against increased water flows, (ii) road foundation strength and provisions to 
prevent water ingress and consequent structural deformation that would eventually extend to 
the  surface  pavement, (iii)  slope  stabilization  for cut  sections  and  road  embankment sides, 
and (iv) provision of proper end-outfalls for lateral ditches. These concerns are related directly 
or indirectly to a critical climate change indicator identified in the CRVA—that of significantly 
increased future rainfall intensity as projected by models. 
586.  Another critical climate change indicator identified in the CRVA is increased heat wave 
duration. Climate modeling projections indicate longer durations of very hot weather (above 
350C), which is likely to have an impact on the required operating stiffness of flexible/asphalt 
pavements, and consequently their durability and resistance to deformation. 
587.  A list of other road component structures found vulnerable to climate change impact, 
including recommended measures to be taken during DED is provided in Table 94.

588.  The  existing  standard—in  particular  TCVN  4054:2005  and  the  technical  branch 
standards referenced there—already specify measures for road construction that address the 
concerns above. These measures have been applied in the preliminary engineering design of 
representative  subprojects.  However,  those  preliminary  designs  were  carried  out  without 
detailed  information  on  the  projected  changes  in  critical  climate  parameters,  notably  the 
intensity  of  rainfall  which  is  a  key  input  to  the  engineering  formulas  used  in  designing 
structures. As such, the preliminary designs need to be adjusted, as illustrated in the three 
subproject  cases  described  above.  Also,  the  engineering  safety  measures  specified  in  the 
standard that are relevant to climate resilience are only generally described; they would need 
to be elaborated or enhanced during the detailed engineering design work itself. 
589. 
Items that need to be addressed more closely during the DED to incorporate climate 
change risk, with reference to the existing standard and to the critical climate parameters that 
need to be adjusted in applying the engineering guidelines and formulas, are explained below. 
590.  Culvert  placements.  Strengthened  culvert  foundations  are  important  in  view  of 
increased water volumes and velocities associated with intensified future rainfall projected by 
climate models (see, for example, Table 61 on the Bac Kan subproject case).  Fortification of 
culvert  sections  in  contact  with  fast-flowing  water  will  be  important,  particularly  their 
foundation,  aprons  and  wing  walls.  TCVN  4054:2005  specifies  various  engineering 
safeguards for constructing culverts (e.g., provision of drop water structures or chutes below 
the culverts at steep locations; see Section 9), which are adequate as long as the calculated 
water  flow  volumes  and  water  velocities  are  adjusted  for  higher  rainfall  intensities.  Design 
enhancement options include extended culvert aprons with anchor toes to prevent scouring 
and weakening of the culvert bedding and the area surrounding the culvert placement. 
591.  The existing TCVN requirements for culverts specify minimum size at 0.75 m diameter. 
However, it is recommended that the DED examine feasibility of increasing the culvert sizes 
to at least 1 meter in flood-prone sections with high silt and debris loads, not just to discharge 
water more quickly but to also facilitate cleaning and removal of soil deposits and debris. 
292  
592.  Road foundations. The structural requirements and engineering safeguard measures 
identified  in  TCVN  4054:2005  (plus  the  referenced  branch  standards  in  22TCN  171  and 
22TCN 262) for designing road embankments under different soil and geologic conditions are 
adequate as long as the design flood water levels are properly adjusted for climate change.64 
The standard also provides for measures to stabilize sections with high embankment slopes 
for protection from scouring. Runoff calculations to estimate erosion rates, and for assessing 
slope  stability,  should  take  into  account  increased  rainfall  intensities  (in  addition  to  soil 
characteristics and other parameters). For critical slopes identified, additional measures to be 
considered  during  DED  may  involve  reinforcing  critical  sections,  supporting  with  retaining 
structures  or  landslide  guard  walls,  and  reforming  cut  areas  with  surface  soil  layer  and 
vegetation cover.  
593.  Soil  types  suitable  as  subgrade  fill  for  road  embankments,  including  the  minimum 
clearance  between  the  subgrade  level  and  the  surrounding  standing  water  level  (or  water 
table)  are  specified  in  Table  22  of  TCVN  4054:2005.  The  specifications  depend  on  the 
estimated length of consecutive days to which the structure is exposed to high water level, 
which is likely to increase with climate change and should be accounted for during the DED. 
594.  Slope stabilization. The standard provides various structural measures for stabilizing 
embankment slopes and road-cut to protect from erosion and risk of collapse (refer also to 
22TCN  262).  Additional  or  complementary  measures  to  reduce  infiltration,  enhance  slope 
drainage  and  integrity,  including  the  use  of  plants  should  be  considered  during  the  DED. 
Appropriate  measures  that  been  field  tested  and  evaluated  for  effectiveness  should  be 
applied.65  
595.  Lateral ditches. These should be checked during DED for proper provision of discharge 
outlets at their ends to prevent the ditches from concentrating runoff water that may penetrate 
through  cracks  and  saturate  the  road  foundation,  which  leads  to  weakening  and  reflected 
deformation and cracks on the road surface.66 Section 9.1 of TCVN 4054:2005 on planning of 
road  drainage  facilities  does  not  specifically  address  such  measure,  and  this  should  be 
brought to the attention of the DED teams. 
596.  Asphalt  pavements.  Specifications  on  flexible  pavements  are  specified  in  branch 
standard 22TCN 211 which dates back to 1993 (and as referenced by TCVN 4054:2005). The 
DED should re-assess the sensitivity of the asphalt stiffness to temperatures projected to be 
higher than those recorded in the past. Potential problems that should be examined during 
DED include migration of liquid asphalt under prolonged hot weather. Heat wave duration, as 
indicated by the number of consecutive days with temperature exceeding 35°C, is projected 
by climate models to increase. 
597.  The  quality  of  asphalt  material  used  in  road  construction  and  maintenance  is  an 
important resilience measure. The detailed engineering design of flexible pavements should 
incorporate developments in asphalt technology to check for modified binders that improve 
the performance of asphalt under increasingly hot weather.  
64 As specified in TCVN 4054:2005 (Section 7.3.2), the design elevation of  the pavement edge of road sections 
running along riverbanks, approaches to small bridges, culverts, and flooded fields must be at least 0.50m higher 
than the flood water level at the design frequency specified for the type of structure.

Infrastructure in Northern Viet Nam, May 2017. Four demonstration sites in Northern Vietnam provinces were 
set up in this study: two sites on riverside slope management (in Son La and Bac Kan); and two roadside slope 
management (in Son La and Thai Nguyen). 
66 Traffic loading is the most important factor influencing pavement performance, and the effect is compounded if 
the foundation becomes saturated because it then loses its ability to adequately support traffic loads, leading to 
premature pavement failure. 
293 
598.  Branch  standard  22TCN  334:2005  (as  referenced  by  TCVN  4054:2005)  provides 
technical  specifications  for  construction  of  macadam  foundations  in  highway  pavement 
structures. For asphalt roads, the DED should further check measures for proper base and 
sub-base compaction and moisture conditions during road construction. The quality of gravel 
materials including thickness of the layers to ensure durable performance should be checked 
and,  if  necessary,  adjusted  for  projected  increased  exposure  to  surrounding  water  or  high 
water tables (in addition to traffic loads). 
599.  Concrete  pavements.  Based  on  follow-on  geological  survey  work  during  DED, 
concrete  pavement  should  be  considered  in  low-lying  areas  where  the  road  structure  is 
vulnerable to water penetration due to more frequent flooding associated with changing rainfall 
regimes.  
600.  Coastal structures. The river port infrastructure subproject in BIIG-2 should be checked 
for adequate clearance of vital components (e.g., the port’s generators) above water level that 
will likely be higher than levels indicated in frequency analysis of past data on maximum tide 
and surge levels. 
601. 
Irrigation water use efficiency. For the irrigation subprojects, resilience to future water 
scarcity  requires thinking  beyond  new  water  supply  measures.  DED  should combine  water 
supply  measures  with provisions  for  increased  efficiency  in water  use.  Numerous  technical 
innovations and management measures are available that can improve the efficiency of water 
use for irrigated agriculture (e.g., lining of canals to reduce seepage, irrigation scheduling to 
prevent farmers from over-irrigating, and improved rice planting and irrigation methods through 
use of the system of rice intensification or SRI67, among others). 
602.  Shifting to high-value crops—such as safe vegetables, herbs and spices--that are less 
water-intensive than traditional rice farming, which is already planned to be promoted under 
the subproject, should also be considered as a climate resilience measure in the design of 
cropping systems for agricultural development subprojects.  
603.  Water supply catchments should be provided with adequate natural vegetation cover 
to protect from projected future increase in both rainfall intensity and erosivity. Measures to 
reduce stream erosion—such as through bio-engineering measures that use combinations of 
live plants and inert structures, and also through construction of check dams and sediment 
basins—should be considered in the DED to prevent reservoirs from prematurely filling with 
sediment.  
67  SRI  is  based  on  four  management  principles  that  interact  with  each  other:  (i)  early,  quick  and  healthy  plant 
establishment; (ii) reduced plant density; (iii) improved soil conditions through enrichment with organic matter; 
and (iv) reduced and controlled water application.

APPENDIX A: CLIMATE MODELING 
A. 
Climate change modeling 
604.  Assessing  exposure to climate  change  hazards depends  on  predicting the  direction 
and  magnitude  of  climate  change.  Climate  change  projections  are  based  on  plausible 
scenarios for possible future greenhouse gas emissions as driven by population, technology 
and socio-economic factors. Several climate groups develop models as a means of informing 
climate change policy options and providing information on risks arising from climate change. 
Each model uses different assumptions both in terms of the scope of the underlying physics, 
datasets, and relationships of variables, and as a result often generate differing projections. 
This reflects the inherent uncertainty that prevails in both knowledge of climate variables and 
in the pathways through which Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emission levels will be defined. Such 
uncertainty  positions  climate  change  model  outputs  as  possible  scenarios,  as  opposed  to 
definitive predictors of future climate.68   
605.  The  increasing  importance  of  climate  change  has  led  to  significant  advances  in 
scientific understanding resulting in increased complexity of climate modeling techniques to 
reduce  or  understand  future  climate  projections.  The  challenge,  however,  is  that  climate 
projections are mostly globally defined, reflecting the global circulation models that underpin 
climate science -- yet the actions required to mitigate GHG emissions and adapt to climate 
change impacts are mostly local. The scale differences between these remain a significant 
challenge increasing the uncertainty of local level information.  
606.  Managing  uncertainty  is  a  priority  in  the  ongoing  development  of  climate  change 
science. Models are selected that reflect a study region’s dominant climate features, especially 
for  climate  parameters  that  are  expected  to  have  the  most  impact.  Assessing  uncertainty 
involves characterizing the range of probable outcomes examined either through multiple runs 
of the same model under different initial conditions, or through using multiple models i.e., an 
ensemble of models. An ensemble enables produces multiple projections that can be used to 
develop a probability distribution that in turn can be used to quantify the likelihood of climate 
change outcomes.69  
607.  When  the  projection  from  several  models  are  combined,  the  resultant  average  has 
often  been found to  be a better  correlate of  actual  observations, than for the  output  of  any 
individual model as it includes “more information”. Nonetheless, climate model projections are 
all driven by assumptions and need to be interpreted with caution considering the underlying 
uncertainty.70

Assessment Report. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Cambridge University Press. 
69  Likelihood  levels in  terms  of  percentiles  are derived  from climate change projections  that  draw  from multiple 
models, that is, the multiple model results are aggregated using percentile ranking. The 10th percentile value, 
for example, means that 90% of the models predict values equal to or higher than that percentile value. At the 
other end, the 90th percentile value means that 10% of the models predict values equal to or higher than that 
value. Hence, one can say that there is an 80% likelihood that the actual value falls between the 10th and 90th 
percentile values.

National  Research  Council's  Board  on  Atmospheric  Sciences  and  Climate:  http://nas-sites.org/climate-
change/climatemodeling. For a more technical description, refer to Chapter 9 of the IPCC’s Assessment Report 
No. 5 (2013): Evaluation of Climate Models.

B. 
Greenhouse Gas Emission Scenarios 
608.  Future  GHG  emissions  and  CO2  concentration  scenarios  used  in  climate  change 
modeling are defined by the Inter-Governmental Panel of Climate Change (IPCC). After 2007, 
the IPCC produced so-called “Representative Concentration Pathways” (RCPs) scenarios to 
provide  flexibility  in  exploring  the  influence  of  policy  choices,  specifically  regarding  cuts  in 
greenhouse gas emissions. The RCPs are identified by their total radiative forcing, measured 
in watts per square meter (W/m2) in 2100 relative to 1750.71  Essentially, the RCP’s describe 
the  degree  to  which  GHG  emissions  are  actively  mitigated,  stabilized  or  increased  and the 
resultant atmospheric CO2 concentrations.72  
609.  The four RCP scenarios span the range of plausible radiative forcing values, from 2.6 
to 8.5 W/m2. One scenario (RCP2.6) leads to a very low forcing level, two medium stabilization 
scenarios  (RCP4.5  and  RCP6)  and  one  high  emission  scenario  (RCP8.5).73   Note  that  the 
RCPs were independently developed by different climate modeling groups that used different 
mathematical  representations  of  the  climate  system  and  are,  strictly  speaking,  not  directly 
comparable. 
610. 
In the latest IPCC (fifth) Assessment Report (2013), the RCP scenarios were used to 
generate  projections  to  reflect  the  likely  outcomes  of  differing  global  policy  choices  for 
mitigating GHG emissions.  Table 95 shows the associated radiative forcing of each scenario, 
the projected atmospheric CO2 concentration, and the corresponding representative climate 
policy.

          RCP = representative concentration pathway, CO2 = carbon dioxide, W = watts, m2 = square meter  
611.  Note that there is no preferred single climate change scenario for use in climate change 
impact studies. The IPCC does not give recommendations on which RCP scenario is more 
likely to materialize, and there are no weightings applied to the RCPs. Hence, no conclusions 
are made in climate change studies about the most probable future scenario outcome. Rather, 
a  range  of  scenarios  representing  high  and  low  CO2  concentration  levels  (sometimes 
described as pessimistic and optimistic scenarios) are included in climate change simulations 
to test the “robustness” of adaptation measures.  
71 Radiative forcing is the additional energy taken up by the climate system due to enhanced greenhouse effect. It 
measures the difference in the balance of energy that enters the atmosphere and the amount that is returned to 
space (compared to the pre-industrial baseline). 
72 The word “representative” signifies that each RCP represents a larger set of scenarios compatible with the range 
of emission scenarios found in the scientific literature. The term “concentration pathway” means that these RCPs 
are  not  fully  integrated  scenarios  yet,  but  instead  are  internally  consistent  sets  of  emission  trajectories  and 
corresponding radiative forcing. The results are used in subsequent phases of modeling to explore impact of 
socio-economic and policy choices. The use of the word “concentration” also means that CO2 concentrations 
are used as the primary product of the RCPs, which serve as input to more fully integrated climate models. Unlike 
the previous generation of scenarios—the SRES scenarios--no fixed sets of assumptions relating to population 
growth, economic development, or technology are associated with any RCP. 
73 Note, by way of perspective, that the global net effect of human activities since 1750 has been estimated as 
being equivalent to a radiative forcing of 0.6 to 2.4 W/m2. 
297 
612.  Within the context of climate risk to infrastructure, and specifically rural roads and water 
supply schemes, the economic life of proposed infrastructure is relatively short reflecting the 
category of road, and the expected traffic forecast and as well as expected traffic growth. Most 
BIIG-1 and BIIG-2 road infrastructure has an economic life of 12 to 15 years. Thus, the relevant 
projections are up to mid-2030s. 
613.  Up to the mid-2030s, the climate change risk to the road infrastructure are expected to 
be  relatively  consistent  across  all four  RCP  scenarios,  since  up  to  about  the  mid-2030s  all 
RCP scenarios have relatively similar projected atmospheric CO2 concentrations – see Figure 
19. 
614.  By  mid-century  (circa  2050)  the  4  RCP  scenarios  indicate  increasing  divergence  in 
atmospheric  CO2  concentrations  and  the  commensurate  divergence  in  climate  projections.  
This is explained by the fact that prior to 2040, projected changes in global climate are largely 
driven by the warming that is already “in the pipeline”, that is, the atmospheric concentrations 
faced is already largely known based on past emissions of greenhouse gases and as such 
the uncertainty introduced from future GHG atmospheric concentration is limited. In contrast, 
warming after mid-century is strongly dependent on the future levels of GHG emissions that 
will be determined by still uncertain global policy actions. 
Figure 19. Projected CO2 concentration under various RCPs  
Source: IPCC (2013); also showed are projections from the earlier set of SRES scenarios. 
615. 
In terms of atmospheric CO2 concentrations, the two RCP scenarios of interest (RCP 
4.5  which  represents  moderate  warming  trajectory,  and  RCP  8.5  which  represents  strong 
warming)  do  not  actually  differ  much  up  to  about  2040s.  But  thereafter,  CO2  concentration 
levels  under  RCP  4.5  peak  and  stabilize,  whereas  RCP  8.5 keeps rising.  Since  we're  only 
projecting up to 2030s for BIIG planning, the two scenarios are relatively similar in terms of 
GHG emissions. As such the choice of RCP will have little impact and, after a data quality 
review, the RCP 8.5 scenario was considered more reliable. 
616.  For purposes of deriving adjustment factors for extreme rainfall to guide the detailed 
engineering design  of  BIIG  infrastructure  subprojects  (at  P4 frequency),  it  is recommended 
that RCP 8.5 associated with a higher projected atmospheric GHG concentration by 2030s be 
adopted. This RCP represents the most conservative outlook on global management of GHG 
298  
emissions.74  Nevertheless, for the profiling of climate change in the eight project provinces 
presented in Appendix B, projections derived from both RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios are 
provided.  
C. 
Regional downscaling methods 
617.  Global Climate Models produce projections at very large scale with coarse projections 
that are informative in the terms of overall global risk but provide limited information at lower 
levels  of  aggregation  such  as  national,  provincial  or  local  level.  With  the  need  to  mitigate 
climate change risk, increasingly local-level actions are required. To inform such programs it 
is  necessary  to  provide  projections  at  lower  scales  by  “downscaling”  from  global  model 
projections. Downscaling is used to take information generated at larger scales and to use this 
to make local projections.  
The  National  Center  for  Atmospheric  Research  (USA)  defines  two  main 
approaches to downscaling of climate information as dynamical and statistical.  
Dynamical  downscaling  requires  running  high-resolution  climate  models  on  a 
regional  sub-domain,  using  observational  data  or  lower-resolution  climate  model 
output as a boundary condition.  These models use physical principles to reproduce 
local climates, but are computationally intensive.   
Statistical downscaling is a two-step process consisting of i) the development of 
statistical relationships between local climate variables (e.g., surface air temperature 
and  precipitation)  and  large-scale  predictors  (e.g.,  pressure  fields),  and  ii)  the 
application of such relationships to the output of global climate model experiments to 
simulate local climate characteristics in the future.

In dynamical downscaling high-resolution simulation models extrapolate from the GCM 
618. 
to regional or local levels. A regional climate model (e.g., PRECIS) is applied to a delineated 
area in which the boundary conditions are generated or “driven” by a parent GCM. Dynamical 
downscaling is based on physical laws with the advantage of being able to produce a large 
variety  of  climate  variables.   The  disadvantage  of this  method  is computational  complexity, 
which limits the number of GCMs that can be downscaled. 
619.  Statistical  downscaling,  on  the  other  hand,  uses  statistical  methods  to  define  the 
relationships between data at the larger scale and then use these relationships to transform 
GCM  outputs  to  local  scale.  Since  it  is  not  dependent  on  specifying  complex  physical 
relationships, statistical downscaling is not as computationally demanding.75 However, it can 
only generate a smaller set of climate variables. 
620.  Downscaled climate projections are adjusted to match the statistical properties of the 
observed climate—a process known as “bias correction.”  This correction is done so that the 
climate simulation for the historical period statistically matches the actual observations. The 
correction factor derived is then applied to the future projections from the climate model.76  
74  “Conservative”  regarding  what  can  be  done  to  reduce  global  GHG  emissions,  still  faced  with  difficulties  to 
effectively address the threat (e.g., US pullout from the Paris climate accord). 
75  Several  statistical  approaches  can  be  used  for  downscaling  including  limited  area  modelling,  stochastic 
modelling, pattern based weather approaches and regression analysis. The least computationally demanding of 
these, regression is generally preferred. 
76 The climate modeling cells used by MoNRE to represent the provinces were selected to overlap with the locations 
of Class-1 hydrometeorological stations; this enables bias-correction to be done on the baseline modeling data 
with reference to historical observations.

621.  Regional Climate Models were used by MoNRE’s Institute of Meteorology, Hydrology 
and Environment, with support from CSIRO/AusAid, to produce high-resolution projections of 
climate change for Vietnam using nine GCMs from the latest set of global models endorsed 
by the IPCC, namely:  NorESM1-M, CNRM-CM5, GFDL-CM3, HadGEM2-ES, ACCESS1-0, 
MPI-ESM-LR, NCARSST, HadGEM2-SST and GFDL-SST. 
622.  Dynamical downscaling of the nine GCMs using five Regional Climate Models, namely: 
(i) the  AGCM/MRI  model from  Japan  Meteorological  Agency (JMA), (ii) the  PRECIS model

from  ICTP  –  Italy,  and  (v)  the  clWRF  model  from  Santander  Meteorology  Group  –  Spain 
provides provincial level forecasts. There were 16 computational cases (model-runs) in total. 
Statistical  methods  were  applied  for  bias-correction  of  the  model  baseline  outputs  with 
reference to observed data. See Table 96.

TCVN/TCN-specified  frequencies,  only  data  from  the  downscaling  of  three  GCMs  using 
PRECIS were used, namely: CNRM-CM5, GFDL-CM3 and HadGEM2-ES (as shown in Table

APPENDIX B: PROJECTED CLIMATE CHANGE IN PROJECT PROVINCES78 
A. 
Increase in temperature 
625.  According to MoNRE, average annual temperatures throughout the country increased 
by  0.62°C  from  1958  to  2014,  at  an  average  of  approximately  0.1°C  per  decade.  Extreme 
temperatures are projected to increase in all climate zones. The number of hot days (maximum 
temperatures exceeding 35°C) show increasing trends in most of the country.  
626.  Under  Scenario  RCP  8.5  the  projected  average  temperature  increase  in  BIIG-1 
provinces  is  1.1°C  and  2.2°C,  for  early  and  mid-century,  respectively.  For  BIIG-2,  the 
corresponding average increase is 0.9°C and 1.9°C, respectively. 
627.  Although changes in average temperature increases are modest, the projected change 
in extreme temperatures  is  more  significant.  Heat  wave occurrence, (defined  as  number  of 
consecutive  days  with  maximum  temperatures  exceeding  35°C),  is  projected  to  increase 
across all the BIIG provinces. For temperature, changes projected from 8 downscaled GCMs 
using data obtained from MoNRE are summarized in Table 97.79

Increase in rainfall intensity 
628.  Across  Viet  Nam rainfall  is  projected  to  increase.  Under  RCP  4.5,  by  early  century, 
annual  rainfall  is  projected  to  increase  by  5 to  10%  relative  to  1986-2005.  By  mid-century, 
rainfall would increase 5 to 15% overall. Under RCP 8.5, the projected increase is of roughly 
the same magnitude. Projected change in 1-day and 5-day maximum rainfall are higher than 
annual changes, increasing by 10 to 70% relative to 1986-2005. 
629.  For BIIG-1 provinces, observations from inland stations during 1961 to 2010 indicate 
a slight decreasing trend in annual rainfall. In BIIG-2 corresponding station observations show 
almost no change in annual rainfall. But future rainfall is generally projected to increase in all 
project  provinces.  In  terms  of  percentage  change  relative  to  reference  period  (1986-2005), 
mean values derived from climate modeling are shown in Table 98.80  
78 Additional information on climate change projections for BIIG-1 and BIIG-2 are provided in the Climate Risk and 
Vulnerability Assessment report for each subregion. 
79 The eight GCMs were: CCAM-CCSM4, CCAM-CNRM-CM5, CCAM-GFDL-CM3, CCAM-NorESM1-M, clWRF-
NorESM1-M,  PRECIS-CNRM-CM5,  PRECIS-GFDL-CM3,  PRECIS-HadGEM2-ES.  Three  regional  climate 
models were used to downscale these eight GCMs: CCAM, cIWRF and PRECIS. CCAM was used on 4 GCMs; 
cIWRF was used on 1 GCM; and PRECIS was used on 3 GCMs. 
80 The ranges of projections with reference to 10% and 90% percentile values (i.e., 80% confidence interval) are 
shown in the CRVA reports for BIIG-1 and BIIG-2.

*Colored values for RCP 4.5 appear incongruent for BIIG-1; the projected mid-century values are lower than for early-century, 
even as the projected annual rainfall is projected to increase as shown in Table 12. Modeled baseline values refer to period 
1986-2005, averaged from 3 climate models. 
C.  Sea level rise 
631.  Sea levels at coastal monitoring stations of Vietnam rose by about 2.45 mm/yr during 
the period 1960-2014. From 1993 to 2014, the rate of SLR had increased to 3.34 mm/yr. The 
largest increase in average sea level  was found along the central coast at 4 mm/yr. Under 
RCP 4.5, the average sea level rise for coastal areas nationally is projected to be about 22 cm 
by mid-century while under RCP 8.5, the projected average SLR is 25 cm.82 
81 Of the 5 regional climate models used by  MoNRE to downscale various global climate models, PRECIS was 
noted to be the most reliable according to the Ministry’s 2016 Report on  Climate Change and Sea Level Rise 
Scenarios  for  Vietnam  (page  39,  full  report  in  Vietnamese).  In  this  PPTA  study,  data  from  the  PRECIS 
downscaling of 3 GCMs were used: CNRM-CM5, GFDL-CM3 and HadGEM2-ES. The tabulated values are the 
average from the 3 downscaled GCMs. Among these GCMs, MoNRE informants indicated that CNRM-CM5 was 
the most “stable” (i.e., the variability of the projections is not too wide compared to the other 2 GCMs). This GCM 
was used to set the baseline for the extreme value frequency analysis of maximum one-day rainfall projections 
shown in Annex E. 
82 With 80% of models predicting in the range of 14 to 32 cm and 17 to 35 cm, respectively.

regions from Hon Dau near Hai Phong in the north to Deo Hai Van near Da Nang to the south.

633.  Storm surge is a rise in sea level due to the impact of typhoons or tropical depressions. 
In the coastal area between Nghe An and Ha Tinh, the observed highest storm surge was 400 
cm. MoNRE has estimated that the highest storm surge in this coastal stretch is likely to be 
450 cm. Between Quang Binh and Hue, the highest observed storm surge was 300 cm, and 
MoNRE’s estimate of the highest possible surge that can occur along this coast is 350 cm.

APPENIX C: HYDROLOGICAL COMPUTATION FORMULAS 
634.  For  traffic  structures,  the  calculation  of  flood  characteristics  is  specified  in  legacy 
documents  and  guidance  documents  over  the  past  years.  For  example,  the  standard  on 
“calculation of  design hydrological  characteristics”  - QP.TL.  C-6-77  has  been  applied  since 
1977.  In  1996  the  calculation  of  flood  characteristics  was  improved  based  on  the  branch 
standard  22-TCN  220-1995.  Currently,  these  legacy  regulations  and  standards  has  been 
consolidated in a national standard, TCVN 9845:2013. 
635.  Specifications  for  the  design  flood  frequency  to  be  used  for  various  transportation 
works are stipulated in TCVN 4054:2005 and TCVN 5729:2012. However, TCVN 5729:2012 
applies  only  to  expressway  projects.  TCVN  4054:2005  is  the  most  relevant  to  the  road 
classifications under BIIG-1 and BIIG-2. For hydraulic calculations related to bridge works, the 
MoT branch standard 22TCN 272:2005 is still applied, even as the specifications there have 
been incorporated in the more recent national standard, TCVN 9845:2013. 
636.  To  calculate  the  flood  characteristics,  various  parameters  are  used  including  the 
watershed area, watershed morphology, characteristics of soils and rocks, vegetation cover 
in  the  watershed,  and  the  rainfall  intensity  corresponding  to  a  frequency  or  return  period 
specified for the structure’s design flood level (as specified in TCVN 4054:2005). 
637. 
In brief, the calculation of the flood characteristics for traffic structures is conducted as 
follows:  based  on  TCVN  4050-2005,  determine  which  flood  frequency  is  applicable  for  the 
category of road and the type of component structure. Then apply the formula to estimate the 
design  flood  level,  as  specified  in  TCVN  9845:2013.  Use  the  one-day  maximum  rainfall 
corresponding to the design flood frequency specified for the structure. 
638.  TCVN 9845:2013 specifies the methodology for calculating flood flow characteristics 
caused by heavy rain for small structures on rivers that are not impacted by the tide and not 
associated with mud/rock flows. According to this standard, the calculation of the design flood 
peak for a given watershed can be based on one of the following formulas: 
•  For a watershed with area smaller than 100 km2, it is possible to use the “Limited 
Strength” formula. 
•  For a watershed with area exceeding 100 km2, it is possible to use the “Discount” 
formula. 
•  In  addition  to  using  the  formulas  above  for  medium  and  large  watersheds,  it  is 
advised to compare the calculated results with other methods such as modeling of 
the river section and other approaches (Section 5.1 TCVN 9845-2013, Page 10).

In addition, TCVN 9845:2013 also specify the tasks and calculation contents of other 
parameters such as design water level, discharge distribution, and flow velocity in rivers and 
streams, and design aperture. These calculations indirectly relate to the maximum daily rainfall 
via design flood peak discharge.

APPENDIX D: STATISTICAL MODELING USING EXTREME VALUE ANALYSIS 
A. 
Extreme Value Theory 
647.  Changes  in  extreme  events  is  assessed  using  extreme  value  theory  to  calculate 
extreme quantiles (depicted by the cumulative distribution function) for different periods, both 
past and future. Specifically, the theory is used to estimate the intensity and frequency of rare 
events  that  lie  far  in  the  tails  of  the  probability  distribution.  The  most  common  approach 
involves fitting a statistical model to the annual extreme values in the time series data.  
648.  The application of this classic theory assumes that the time series being analyzed is 
“stationary”, that is, the statistical parameters (mean and variance) are constant for the time 
series.83  In  using  projected  climate  data  that  cover  several  periods  (e.g.,  baseline,  early 
century, mid-century) it is assumed that the time series is stationary within any one period. As 
such the periods being assessed need to be sufficiently spaced to provide detectable changes 
in  statistical  parameters  across  periods.  For  the  purpose  of  climate  change  impacts  the 
MoNRE  databases  use a  baseline  time  series  covering  1986-2005;  early-century  period  of 
2016-2035; and mid-century of 2046-2065. 
649.  Extreme value analysis (EVA) requires putting together a sample of extreme values 
obtained by selecting the maximum value observed in each time block (e.g., year or season). 
Statistical tests confirm that the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution is appropriate 
for block maximum values.84 
650.  This  analysis  procedure  can  be  applied  to  both  modeled  climate  data  and  actual 
historical data on selected climate parameters, in this case one-day maximum rainfall. 
651.  Theoretically, although very long period return values can be calculated from the fitted 
probability distribution (say, for 100-year return period), the confidence that can be placed in 
the  results  is  low  if  the  length  of  the  return  period  is  substantially  greater  than  the  period 
covered by the sample of extremes (in our case, 20 years). Estimating return levels for very 
long  return  periods  is  prone  to  large  sampling  errors  and  potentially  large  biases  due  to 
uncertainty  about  of  the  actual  shape  of  the  tails  of  the  probability  distribution.  Generally, 
confidence in return levels decreases rapidly when the period is more than about two times 
the length of the time series data.85 
652.  Statistical  extreme  value  analysis  comes  with  uncertainty—in  this  case,  associated 
with the estimation of the statistical model parameters.86 Thus, on top of the climate modeling 
uncertainty described earlier, statistical modeling of extreme events derived from the climate 
modeling results creates an additional layer of uncertainty.  
B. 
Fitting of Probability Distribution 
653. 
Identifying  the  best-fitted  probability  distribution  to  an  extreme  value  time  series 
involves  applying  goodness-of-fit  tests.  These  tests  measure  the  compatibility  of  the  time 
83 It also assumes that the statistical parameters are “homogenous” or unchanging over the area of interest. 
84 Another method using “peaks over threshold” (POT) values to assemble data on exceedances above a specified 
threshold. For this method, a generalized Pareto distribution is generally found to be the best-fitting statistical 
distribution function.  
85  World  Meteorological  Organization.  Guidelines  on  Analysis  of  extremes  in  a  changing  climate  in  support  of 
informed decisions for adaptation. WMO Climate Data and Monitoring WCDMP-No. 72, 2009. 
86 Uncertainty may be related to the statistical techniques, but depend particularly on the sample series length for 
extremes  analysis.  The  fitted  probability  distribution  is  also  very  sensitive  to  inclusion  or  exclusion  of  outlier 
values. 
307 
series with the theoretical probability distribution function, i.e., to test if a sample of data came 
from a population with a specific probability distribution. 
654.  To  construct  the  statistical  model  for  the  one-day  maximum  rainfall,  we  fitted  10 
probability distributions to samples of time series derived from the climate modeling data on 
one-day  annual  maximum  rainfalls.  The  Kolmogorov-Smirnov  and  Anderson-Darling  tests 
were used along with the chi-square test at 0.01 level of significance to identify the best-fitting 
probability distribution.87  The candidate distributions were ranked from (highest) 1 to 10 based 
on lowest t-statistic value. The probability distribution with consistent high ranking using the 
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was selected. 
655.  The  Generalized  Extreme  Value  distribution  represents  the  best  fit  to  data.    The 
goodness-of-fit test served to validate the recommended statistical model in the literature on 
extreme value analysis. Then we applied this model to calculate exceedance probabilities and 
corresponding return periods. 
656.  The  GEV  distribution  is  a  three-parameter  model  with  the  following  probability 
distribution  function,  where  z=(x-μ)/σ,  and  k,  σ,  μ  are  the  shape,  scale  and  location 
parameters,  respectively.  The  scale  must  be  positive  (sigma>0),  whereas  the  shape  and 
location can take on any real value. 
657.  The range of definition of the GEV probability distribution depends on the value of the 
shape parameter k: 
658.  The parameters of the GEV probability distribution function are estimated from the time 
series (e.g., a 20-year record of annual maximum daily rainfall).88  Estimated GEV parameters 
are applied to generate, first, the probability density function using the formula above—and 
from it, the cumulative distribution function. The cumulative distribution function is then used 
to calculate the annual exceedance probabilities and corresponding return periods.89 The latter 
refers to the probability that an event is equaled or exceeded in any single year. The return 
period is the reciprocal of the exceedance probability. 
659.  After  estimating  the  parameters  of  the  GEV  probability  distribution,  the  probabilistic 
model was used to compare the return period of baseline and future extreme rainfall. 
660.  Theoretically, although very long period return values can be calculated from the fitted 
probability distribution (say, for 100-year return period), the confidence that can be placed in 
87 The Anderson-Darling test is just a modification of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test. It gives more weight to 
the distribution tails than does the K-S test. We placed more weight on the result of the K-S test in selecting the 
best-fitting distribution. 
88 Open source statistical modeling packages are available to automate fitting of probability distribution functions, 
such as the programming language R (www.r-project.org). Commercial packages are also available, such as 
EasyFit (www.mathwave.com), which can be linked to MS Excel. 
89 The exceedance probability is 1 minus the cumulative probability at any given point (x) in the distribution. 
308  
the  results  is  low  if  the  length  of  the  return  period  is  substantially  greater  than  the  period 
covered by the sample of extremes (in our case, 20 years). Estimating return levels for very 
long  return  periods  is  prone  to  large  sampling  errors  and  potentially  large  biases  due  to 
uncertainty  about  of  the  actual  shape  of  the  tails  of  the  probability  distribution.  Generally, 
confidence in return levels decreases rapidly when the period is more than about two times 
the length of the time series data.90 
661.  As  with  climate  modeling  uncertainty,  statistical  extreme  value  analysis  comes  with 
uncertainty—in this case, associated with the estimation of the statistical model parameters.91 
Thus,  on  top  of  the  climate  modeling  uncertainty  described  earlier,  statistical  modeling  of 
extreme  events  derived  from  the  climate  modeling  results  creates  an  additional  layer  of 
uncertainty.  It  is  important  to  recognize  this  propagation  of  uncertainty  throughout  the 
modeling process in interpreting findings.

involves  applying  goodness-of-fit  tests.  These  tests  measure  the  compatibility  of  the  time 
series with the theoretical probability distribution function, i.e., to test if a sample of data came 
from a population with a specific probability distribution. 
663.  To  construct  the  statistical  model  for  the  one-day  maximum  rainfall,  we  fitted  10 
probability distributions to samples of time series derived from the climate modeling data on 
one-day  annual  maximum  rainfalls.  The  Kolmogorov-Smirnov  and  Anderson-Darling  tests 
were used at 0.01 level of significance to identify the best-fitting probability distribution.92 The 
candidate distributions were ranked from (highest) 1 to 10 based on lowest t-statistic value. 
The  probability  distribution  with consistent  high  ranking using the  Kolmogorov-Smirnov  test 
was selected. A sample goodness-of-fit test results for a time series data set (baseline CNRM 
model run for Bac Kan) is shown below.

91 Uncertainty may be related to the statistical techniques, but depend particularly on the sample series length for 
extremes  analysis.  The  fitted  probability  distribution  is  also  very  sensitive  to  inclusion  or  exclusion  of  outlier 
values. 
92 The Anderson-Darling test is just a modification of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test. It gives more weight to 
the distribution tails than does the K-S test. We placed more weight on the result of the K-S test in selecting the 
best-fitting distribution.

APPENDIX G: APPROACH USING HYDRO-DYNAMIC MODELING 
666.  For structural components that require P1 and P2 estimates, such as for medium to large 
bridges, combined application of climate change modeling and hydrological modeling is a suitable 
approach. 
667.  Projections of daily rainfall and relevant atmospheric conditions (e.g., temperature, relative 
humidity) obtained from regional/downscaled climate models can be used as climatic time series 
inputs to hydrologic models to assess future change in flood levels. That is, hydrologic modeling 
results can be compared between simulations using baseline/historical rainfall data and that using 
projected climate data.  
668.  Hydrologic models are available, such as the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and 
Hydrologic Engineering Center - Hydrologic Modeling System (HEC-HMS). These are designed to 
simulate the  complete  hydrologic  processes  of watershed  systems.  Data  input  are grouped into 
five categories: topography, land use, soil, land use management and climate. 
669.  Essentially, a hydrologic model is first calibrated for the subject basin using historical data. 
Then climatic input data (representing a range of modeling results) are fed to the calibrated model 
to assess effects on future river flows (in particular, peak flows used for designing structures) and 
other hydrologic parameters if relevant to the engineering design (e.g., sediment discharge). The 
climate input data, in gridded format, can be obtained from MoNRE.94  
670.  Basin-scale  hydrologic  modeling  requires  gridded  daily  precipitation,  maximum  and 
minimum  temperatures,  and  wind  magnitude  as  input  to  simulate  similarly  gridded  daily  “state 
variables” such as runoff. Resulting gridded runoffs are then hydraulically routed to the basin outlet 
or  a  specified  location  (e.g.,  bridge  site).  Use  of  multiple  climate  modeling  outputs  to  feed  the 
hydrologic model allows the assessment of uncertainty around, say, a mean or median projection, 
providing quantitative information for risk-based decision making. 
671. 
Impacts  of  potential  climate  change  on  streamflow  can  be  evaluated  by  comparing 
simulations using the rainfall data derived from GCMs (e.g., covering 2016-2035, applicable to the 
operating  life  of  BIIG-1  and  BIIG-2  infrastructure  subprojects).95  The  streamflow  projections  are 
then compared with the baseline runs of the model (using both observed historical rainfall data and 
baseline data generated by models) to assess the significance of change. 
672.  An advantage of using integrated models (e.g., SWAT and HEC-HMS) for climate impact 
analysis of streamflow is that these models can also be used to examine climate change effects on 
other  factors  of  change,  such  as  land  use  change.  Changes  in  vegetation  cover  and  basin 
alterations  due  to  population  growth  or  development  activities  (e.g.,  establishment  of  tree 
plantations) can then be considered in projecting future streamflow. 
673.  A common problem with the use of regional climate modeling outputs directly in hydrological 
impact studies is that the simulated rainfall often exhibits biases.96 Bias correction is often required 
to  bring  model-simulated  baseline  rainfall  in  line  with  the  historical  observations.  Such  bias 
94 Climate modeling data, at daily scale, can also be downloaded from existing data distribution centers, such as the one 
maintained by the World Climate Research Program (WCRP) for the CMIP3 and CMIP5 generation of global climate 
models (http://cmip-pcmdi.llnl.gov/cmip5/data_portal.html). 
95 If there is an adequate number of rainfall time series inputs, the streamflow projections can be presented as percentile 
values to bound the range of uncertainty. 
96 Modeling biases can arise from the internal physics used in the model or from the errors in lateral boundary conditions. 
326  
correction  has  been  applied  to  the  entire  time  series  of  rainfall  in  MoNRE’s  climate  change 
database. 
674.  Essentially, for the design of bridges (specifically, to determine the design vertical clearance 
from the P1 or P2 flood), the modeling sequence and steps are: 
•  First, set up a basin-scale hydrological model and calibrate/validate it using observed hydro-
meteorological data.  
•  Second, use results from a high-resolution climate model (e.g., downscaled for the basin 
from a global climate model to determine climate projections for the basin over the analysis 
period (e.g., reference historical period versus operating period of planned infrastructure, 
say,  up  to  2030s).  Outputs  generated  from  the  climate  model  (e.g.  temperature, 
precipitation) are used as input to the hydrological model. 
•  Third,  use  a  hydraulic  routing  model  to  convert  projected  basin  runoff  (flow  volumes) 
generated by the hydrologic model to flooding depth at various points in the river network. 
For example, the Hydrologic Engineering Center – River Analysis System (HEC-RAS, which 
is  often  used  in  conjunction  with  HEC-HMS)  is  a  computer  program  for  modeling  water 
flowing  through  open  channels  and  computing  water  surface  profiles.  HEC-RAS  is 
particularly applicable for bridge and culvert design and analysis, embankment design, as 
well as river modification studies.97  
675.  An  example  of  this  approach  is  reported  for  a  recent  study  that  investigated  possible 
impacts  of climate  change  on future floods  in  the  VuGia  -ThuBon  river  basin in central  Vietnam 
using a multi-model climate ensemble.98 An ensemble of regional climate projections derived from 
different  combinations  of  global  and  regional  climate  models  in  combination  with  different 
greenhouse gas emission scenarios were used.99  
676.  Climate data were used as input to a basin water balance model (WaSIM-ETH) to reproduce 
discharge data at Nong Son station. Annual maximum discharges were extracted from the modeled 
daily series for the reference period (1980-1999) and future periods (2011-30, 2031-50, and 2080-
99) for use in subsequent extreme value frequency analyses. To derive flood frequency curves for 
the four time periods, the Generalized Extreme Value probability distribution was fitted to the data. 
677.  Adjusted return periods were calculated based on the delta change method. In this method, 
the  observed  extreme  values  were  adjusted  using  the  derived  values  from  the  hydrological 
simulations, which in turn were fed by future climate projections.  
678.  The study calculated, on average, an increase for the P1 (or 100-year return period) flood 
magnitude of 4%, 65%, and 94% for 2011-30, 2031-50, and 2080-99, respectively, relative to the 
baseline. However, there was a large spread in the simulated peak flood magnitudes derived from 
97 If water allocation, say for water supply or irrigation development, is the purpose of the analysis, an alternative third 
model could be a water accounting model (e.g., WEAP, which stands for Water Evaluation and Planning system). Such 
models can be used to assess the impacts of climate change on water resource availability and water balance in the 
basin. Results of the hydrological modeling (i.e., projections in river flow), in conjunction with projected water demands, 
are used as input to the water accounting model. The model calculates a mass balance of flow sequentially down a 
river system, making allowance for abstractions and inflows. It can be used to simulate alternative scenarios comprising 
different development and management options.

the  different  models.  Nevertheless,  there  was  agreement  among  the  models  towards  increased 
future  peak  flows.  Due  to  the  obtained  large  spread  of  simulated  peak  flood  magnitudes,  the 
investigators stressed the need for combined climate and hydrological simulations. They also noted 
that  wide  spread  in  model-projected  flood  magnitudes  remains  a  crucial  problem  for  decision 
makers in applying climate change impact assessments, as demonstrated in this case.

vulnerability  assessment  was  by  carried  out  and findings  reported  in  2015. The  project  involves 
proposed construction of two large bridges in the Mekong Delta (across the Han River and the Tien 
River) that would be linked by a 24-km connecting road and 26 small bridges. Thirteen structural 
components of the project were examined for climate risk and vulnerability--including bridges, road 
embankments and road drainage structures.  
680.  For this Mekong delta infrastructure project, the most critical climate change impact—as in 
the case also of BIIG-1 and BIIG-2--was found to be the likely changes in design flood elevations. 
The climate risk assessment used rainfall projections from 6 GCMs that were run under two SRES 
scenarios  (A1B  and  B2),  which  were  used  as  input  to  a  hydraulic  model  for  the  Mekong  delta. 
Modeling results showed that, over a 100-year period, the increase in water level at P1 frequency 
on the floodplain induced by climate change would reach 0.6 m, while the increase in flood water 
level at the Cao Lanh bridge site across the Tien River was estimated to reach 0.7 m. Based on 
these findings, the ICEM  study  recommended that the  design  height  of the road  embankments, 
including the approach embankments to the bridges, be raised by 0.6 m.
