Background and Rationale 
I. 
PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
Located  in  the  northwest  of  the  People’s  Republic  of  China  (PRC),  Xinjiang  Uygur 
1. 
Autonomous Region (XUAR)  is a remote region linking the PRC to Central Asia. Despite recent 
economic  development  due  to  the  expansion  of  agriculture  and  extractive  industries,  XUAR 
remains one of the poorest and least-developed regions in the PRC. In 2013, XUAR’s average 
urban per capita disposable income was the second lowest in the PRC, at CNY19,874.1 XUAR 
is  one  of  the  less-developed  western  regions  targeted  for  accelerated  socioeconomic 
development  and  poverty  reduction  by  the  preferential  policies under the National  Strategy for 
Development of the West. XUAR has a large ethnic minority population: the Uygur account for 
45.73% of the total population and other ethnic minority groups for 14.77%. The regional capital, 
Urumqi, with a population of 3.1 million, and the populated urban centers in the northern part of 
the region are the main industrial hubs. They are also the primary points of public infrastructure 
investment and private sector activities. On the other hand, investments in the southern part of 
XUAR,  mainly  constituted  of  mountains  and  desert  areas,  lag  behind.  The  development  of  an 
arc-shaped urban and transport corridor between the southern piedmont of Tianshan Mountain 
and the northern rim of Taklamakan Desert is an opportunity to achieve a more balanced level 
of development across the region. 
2. 
Five oases cities exist along highway A314 and the national railway, each with an urban 
population  between  300,000  and  700,000.  Over  time,  agricultural  expansion,  poorly  managed 
urbanization,  and  extractive  industries  have  degraded  the  local  environment,  decreasing  the 
sustainability  of  these  cities.  These  cities  are  the  only  urban  centers  capable  of  clustering 
economic activities in the southern part of the region. 
3. 
Akesu  is  a  medium-sized  city  in  southern  XUAR  established  as  an  oasis  town  on  the 
historic  Silk  Road.  In  2013,  its  poverty  incidence  was  5.45%  for  the  urban  population,  and 
12.3%  for  the  rural  population.  Akesu  has  a  higher  poverty  rate  than  regional  and  national 
averages.  The  city  has  expanded  in  recent  years  following  (i)  economic  growth  in  agricultural 
production, (ii) exploration and processing of oil and gas, and (iii) regional and intercity transport 
improvements. The urban population grew from 422,470 in 2005 to 509,200 in 2013, reaching 
an urbanization rate of 61.2%, while the built-up area expanded from 27 square kilometers (km2) 
to 46.5 km2 over the same period. Although the burgeoning city benefits from a good economic 
outlook,  inadequate  infrastructure  investment  in  existing  areas  and  environmental  degradation 
are contributing to a poorer quality of life. 
4. 
 Akesu’s  long-term  sustainable  development  requires  socially  and  environmentally 
responsible  management  of  its  urbanization.  It  urgently  needs  to  tackle  its  significant 
deficiencies  in  urban  infrastructure  and  services;2 as  current  access  to  water,  sanitation,  and 
heating  in  Akesu  is  low  and  variable.  Meanwhile,  poor  land  use  and  waste  management 
practices  threaten  environmental  conditions  in  Akesu’s  rivers  and  wetlands.  While  improved 
services will reduce the negative impact of urbanization on the environment in Akesu, additional 
measures are needed to rehabilitate and preserve the water resources for the city and the larger 
watershed. The Akesu Duolang wetlands, located within the ecological conservation zone of the 
pilot  Xinjiang  Akesu  Duolang  River  National  Wetland  Park,  provide  important  ecosystem 
services.  These  include  groundwater  replenishment,  flood  retention,  sediment  and  nutrient 
1  2013 statistical bulletins of socioeconomic development in the PRC and XUAR. 
2  The direct project areas cover 31 km2 in central Akesu. 
1 
removal,  micro-climate  regulation,  cultural  services,  and  biodiversity  conservation. 3  The 
rehabilitation  of  these  wetlands  will  enhance  the  National  Wetland  Park  network  in  the  PRC, 
provide  a  demonstration  of  wise  wetland  use  as  promoted  by  the  Ramsar  Convention,  and 
contribute to improved water resources management within the Tarim River Basin. 4 
5. 
 The  proposed  project  aims  to  improve  municipal  services  in  the  project  area 
significantly:  (i)  the  households  with  connection  to  piped  urban  water  supply  would  increase 
from 52.6%  to 88.6%, (ii) the households with sewerage connections would increase from 8.0% 
to 66.6%, (iii) the area with access to central heating would increase from 12.7% to 87.0%, and 
(iv) the households covered by solid waste management would increase from 18.7% to 100%. 
The  urban  road  component  is  aligned  with  the  Comprehensive Transportation  Planning  of  the 
Urban Center  Area  of  Akesu (2013–2030)  to improve conditions  and  connectivity  of  the  urban 
road network in Akesu for all users on arterial, secondary, collector, and lane-scale roads.5 The 
peri-urban  communities  targeted  for  improvement  under  the  residential  alley  component  are 
inhabited  mostly  by  ethnic  minorities.  The 
large 
environmental  impacts,  including  interception  of  some  21,600  cubic  meters  of  currently 
uncollected wastewater, reducing contamination of the Akesu water resources.6 
improvement  of  services  will  have 
6. 
 Strategic  fit.  The  project  is  consistent  with  the  PRC’s  Twelfth  Five-Year  Plan  (2010–
2015), and these urbanization policies, priorities, and agendas will continue into the Thirteenth 
Five-Year  Plan.  The  project  supports  environmentally  sustainable  and  inclusive  economic 
growth,  which  is  a  key  priority  of  ADB’s  Strategy  2020  as  well  as  the  Midterm  Review  of 
Strategy  2020. 7  It  is  in  line  with  ADB’s  PRC  country  partnership  strategy,  2011–2015  for 
inclusive  and  environmentally  sustainable  growth. 8  It  also  conforms  to  (i)  ADB’s  Water 
Operational Plan, as the project encourages water and wastewater management, and wetland 
and biodiversity protection; (ii) ADB’s Urban Operational Plan, which fosters competitive, green, 
and  inclusive  cities  by  promoting  connectivity,  road  safety,  waste  management,  and  urban 
sanitation;  and (iii)  ADB’s  Sustainable Transport Initiative Operational  Plan  by  supporting  road 
safety and social sustainability.9 The project also supports the PRC’s new urbanization plan by 
supporting  environmentally  sustainable  urban  development.  That  plan  aims  to  (i)  improve  the 
urban  services  of  small  towns  and  (ii)  establish  harmonious  and  pleasant  living  conditions  in 
cities  with  improved  infrastructure,  public  services,  and  environment.10 Finally,  the  project  will 
also support the PRC's National Wetland Conservation Program (2004–2030).11

5  While  there  are  no  current  plans  to  create  new  mass  transit  networks  in  Akesu,  the  urban  road  component 
supports existing bus networks and maintains adequate space for future development of rapid transit. 
6  This will result in an estimated reduction of 9,280 tons per year of chemical oxygen demand, 39 tons per year of 
total phosphorus, and 32 tons per year of total nitrogen.

7. 
This is the fifth project of the strategic urban sector partnership between XUAR and ADB. 
ADB’s value addition can be seen in the optimization of project design, reduction of resettlement 
impacts and costs, as well as the incorporation of lessons and special features. 
8. 
 Incorporation of lessons. The project design incorporates lessons from previous ADB-
financed  urban  development  projects,  emphasizing  holistic  urban  development  approaches  to 
support  the  development  of  livable  cities  with  universal  access. 12  The  project  focuses  on 
improving access to urban water supply, sewerage, and heating services in existing urban areas 
rather  than  the  establishment  of  new  districts.  The  project  has  been  informed  by  the  lessons 
from  ADB’s  water  and  wastewater  tariff  studies,  which  developed  the  National  Guidelines  on 
Water Tariffs.13 Akesu, being in an ethnic minority and poverty area, is currently exempted from 
the  1998  National  Regulation  for  Urban  Water  Tariff  Management.  The  project  will,  however, 
promote cost-recovery and progressive tariffs in line with national standards through institutional 
strengthening  and  capacity  building.14 The  project  will  follow  the  reduce,  reuse,  recycle  (3R) 
principles adopted in previous ADB projects in XUAR.15 
9. 
 Special  features.  In  line  with  the  integrated  nature  of  the  project,  several  special 
features have been developed and are supported by capacity building. First, two “living street” 
pilots  will  be  designed  in  low-income,  ethnic  minority  communities  of  Akesu,  aiming  to  create 
social and shared spaces where people can meet and children can play safely by reducing the 
speed and dominance of motorized transport in these areas. The pilot locations will be selected 
in  a  participatory  process  with  affected  communities.  Second,  the  road  component  will  be 
supported  by  urban  traffic  planning  with  an  emphasis  on  nonmotorized  traffic,  including  the 
preparation  of  a  human-centered  urban  transport  master  plan  for  the  city  of  Akesu,  and  the 
design and implementation of a public education program on traffic safety. Third, the project will 
contribute  to  the  development  of  a  citywide  solid  waste  management  road  map,  with  defined 
short-, medium-,  and  long-term targets,  including  support  to the  development  of  a  3R-oriented 
integrated  solid  waste  management  plan.  Finally,  the  wetland  rehabilitation  component  will 
include  guidance  on  preparing  and  implementing  a  detailed  wetland  management  plan, 
including  biodiversity  monitoring plan,  water source protection  survey  and protection  plan,  and 
public  education  for  biodiversity  protection.  Knowledge  sharing  on  these  initiatives  will  be 
promoted through the production and dissemination of related knowledge products.

Outputs 
11. 
 The project will take a strategic and holistic approach to urban development where the 
inadequate  and  outdated  urban  services  and  degraded  ecosystems  have  constrained  the 
opportunities  for  the  city  to  develop  in  an  environmentally  sustainable  and  socially  inclusive 
manner. The project interventions are expected to produce three primary outputs. 
 Output  1:  Urban  infrastructure  and  services  improved.  This  comprises  of  six 
12. 
components  with  inclusive  employment  opportunities:  (i)  about  75  kilometers  (km)  of  urban 
roads  constructed  or  upgraded—19  roads  upgraded,  two  new  roads  built,  alleys  upgraded  in 
four  ethnically  concentrated,  peri-urban  communities,  and  two  pilot  “living  streets”  developed; 
about  162  bus  stops,  19  km  of  separated  motorized  and  nonmotorized  lanes,  one  pedestrian 
overpass,  and  two  new  bridges  constructed;  associated  traffic  signals,  street  lights,  and  utility 
pipelines built or upgraded, plus landscaping; (ii) public park and green spaces upgraded, and a 
tree nursery established; (iii) about 38 km of urban water supply pipes laid; (iv) about 78 km of 
urban  sewerage  infrastructure  constructed;  (v)  about  44  km  of  central  heating  pipelines  and 
associated heat exchange stations built; and (vi) street cleaning, waste collection, transportation 
equipment and vehicles procured, and one waste transfer station constructed. 
 Output 2: Akesu Duolang wetland rehabilitated and protected. Interventions toward 
13.

COSTS AND FINANCING 
A.  Project Investment Plan 
The  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $250.99  million.  Loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed 
1. 
according to ADB’s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2015, as amended from time to time), and 
subject to the provisions of the Loan Agreement. 
Table 1: Project Investment Plan 
 a  Includes  taxes  and  duties  estimated  at  $11.95  million,  to  be  financed  from  government  resources  and  Asian 
Development Bank (ADB) loan resources. The amount of taxes and duties to be financed by ADB is based on the 
principles that (i) the amount of taxes and duties financed by the ADB loan does not represent an excessive share 
of the project, (ii) the taxes and duties apply only to ADB-financed expenditures, and (iii) the financing of taxes and 
duties is relevant to the project success. 
b  In July 2014 prices and an exchange rate of $1 = CNY6.15. 
c  Physical  contingencies  computed  using  4.7%  on  base  cost.  Price  contingencies  computed  using  foreign  cost 
escalation factors of 1.25% for 2015, 2.52% for 2016, and 3.95% for 2017; and local currency escalation factors of 
2.80% for 2015, 5.88% for 2016, and 9.09% for 2017. 
d  Includes interest and commitment charges. Interest during construction for  ordinary capital resources loan(s) has 
been computed at the 5-year US dollar fixed swap rate plus an effective contractual spread of 0.5% and maturity 
premium of 0.1%. Commitment charges for an ordinary capital resources loan are 0.15% per year to be charged on 
the undisbursed loan amount. 
Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. 
B.  Financing Plan 
2. 
 The  government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $150  million  from  ADB’s  ordinary  capital 
resources  to  help finance  the  project.  The  loan will  have  (i)  a  26-year  term,  including  a grace 
period of 5 years; will follow the straight-line method; (ii) an annual interest rate determined in 
accordance  with  ADB’s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility;  (iii)  a 
commitment  charge  of  0.15%  per  year  on  undisbursed  funds;  and  (iv)  such  other  terms  and 
conditions  as  are  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  project  agreements.  The  average  maturity  is 
15.75 years, and the maturity premium payable to ADB is 0.10% per annum. The ADB loan will 
cover  civil  works,  equipment,  engineering  installation,  project  management  and  capacity 
building,  and  financing  charges  during  construction.  The  ADB  loan  will  also finance  taxes  and 
duties  included  in  the  base  cost.  The  financing  charges  during  construction  are  estimated  at 
$5.85 million; of which $3 million will be financed through ADB loan as capitalized interest and 
charges.  The  loan  will  finance  59.76%  of  the  total  project  cost  and  the  Akesu  Municipal 
Government (AMG) will finance the remaining 40.24% (Table 2). 
3. 
The  People’s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  is  the  borrower  of  the  loan  and  will  relend  the 
entire loan to the Government of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, which will onlend the loan 
proceeds to the Akesu prefecture government, which in turn will onlend to the AMG on the same 
terms and conditions as those for the ADB loan. The AMG will bear the foreign exchange and 
13 
interest rate variation risks in proportion to the loan amount it receives. The PRC, XUARG, and 
AMG have assured ADB that counterpart funding will be provided in a timely manner, including 
any additional counterpart funding required for any shortfall of funds or cost overruns.

 a  Includes  taxes  and  duties  estimated  at  $11.95  million,  to  be  financed  from  government  resources  and  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  loan  resources.  The 
amount  of  taxes  and  duties  to  be  financed  by  ADB  is  based  on  the  principles  that  (i)  the  amount  of  taxes  and  duties  financed  by  the  ADB  loan  does  not 
represent  an  excessive  share  of  the  project,  (ii)  the  taxes  and  duties  apply  only  to  ADB-financed  expenditures,  and  (iii)  the  financing  of  taxes  and  duties  is 
relevant to the project success. 
b  In July 2014 prices and an exchange rate of $1 = CNY6.15. 
c  Physical contingencies computed using 4.7% on base cost. Price contingencies computed using foreign cost escalation factors of 1.25% for 2015, 2.52% for 
2016, and 3.95% for 2017; and local currency escalation factors of 2.80% for 2015, 5.88% for 2016, and 9.09% for 2017. 
d  Includes interest and commitment charges. Interest during construction for  ordinary capital resources loan(s) has been computed at the 5-year US dollar fixed 
swap rate plus an effective contractual spread of  0.5% and maturity premium of 0.1%.  Commitment charges for an ordinary capital resources loan are 0.15% 
per year to be charged on the undisbursed loan amount.

FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT 
A.  Financial Management Assessment 
The  financial  management  assessment  was  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB’s 
1. 
Guidelines  for  the  Financial  Management  and  Analysis  of  Projects 1 to  assess  the  financial 
management  capacity  of  Akesu  municipal  government  (AMG);  including  the  flow  of  funds 
arrangements,  staffing,  accounting  policies  and  procedures,  internal  and  external  auditing 
arrangements,  reporting  and  monitoring,  and  financial  information  systems.  The  assessment 
concluded  that  AMG  is  inexperienced  in  managing  projects  funded  by  international  financial 
institutions. The overall financial management risk-rating of the project is “moderate”, although, 
the  risk  can  be  mitigated  by  adequate  preparatory  project  training.  The  identified  risks  in 
financial management will be closely monitored during project implementation. The assessment 
indicated  that  (i)  there  are  established  accounting  and  financial  management  policies  and 
procedures in the PRC, which are strictly followed by AMG; and (ii) they have sound accounting 
and financial management capability and are experienced in managing large projects. Xinjiang 
Uygur  Autonomous  Region  Finance  Department  (XFD),  which  will  operate  and  administer  the 
imprest account, is experienced in administering ADB and other foreign-financed projects. The 
number  of  staff  in  the  agencies  is  adequate  for  current  day-to-day  activities.  Training  will  be 
provided to XFD staff on ADB guidelines for project implementation especially on procurement, 
disbursement and financial management.  
Understanding  of,  and  adherence  to,  ADB’s  financial  management  policies  and 
2. 
procedures  and  strengthened 
internal  audit  system  can  be  enhanced  during  project 
implementation. AMG is required to maintain a separate project account which is in line with the 
PRC’s  accounting  standards  and  these  are  subject  to  independent  external  audit  by  qualified 
commercial  or  government  auditors.  It  was  agreed  that  the  Akesu  project  management  office 
(APMO) will strengthen its financial management capability to manage the project, including (i) 
finalizing  organizational  arrangements;  (ii)  setting  up  clear  institutional  arrangements  and 
strengthen  coordination  mechanism;  (iii)  completing  staff  recruitment  to fill  identified  positions; 
(iv)  undertaking  more  training,  particularly  on  ADB  policy  and  procedures;  and  (v)  seeking 
external financial management assistance as needed. 
B.  Disbursement 
1. 
Disbursement  Arrangements  for  Asian  Development  Bank  {and  Asian 
Development Bank-administered Co-financier} Funds 
The loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with Loan Disbursement Handbook 
1. 
(2015, as amended from time to time), and detailed arrangements agreed upon between the 
government and ADB.2 
4. 
As  the  implementing  agency,  the  AMG  will  be  responsible  for  all  disbursement 
arrangements,  including  (i)  preparing  disbursement  projections,  (ii)  requesting  budgetary 
allocations  for  counterpart  funds,  (iii)  collecting  supporting  documents,  and  (iv)  preparing  and 
sending  withdrawal  applications  to  ADB  through  XFD.  At  the  end  of  each  year,  realistic 
projections of contract awards / commitments and disbursement for the next year will be made 
for  an  assessment  and  projection  of  ADB  funds.  The  APMO  will  be  responsible  for  preparing

disbursement projections each year. 
5. 
Reimbursement,  commitment,  and  imprest  fund  procedures  may  be  used  to  withdraw 
funds from the loan account. To expedite the flow of funds and simplify document processing, 
the  statement  of  expenditures  (SOE)  procedure  may  be  used  to  reimburse,  replenish,  and 
liquidate  eligible  expenditures  for  any  individual  payment  not  exceeding  $200,000  equivalent. 
Payments  exceeding  this  ceiling  will  be  reimbursed,  replenished,  and  liquidated  based  on  the 
full documentation process. SOE records should be maintained and made readily available for 
review  by  ADB’s  disbursement  and  review  mission,  or  upon  ADB’s  request  for  submission  of 
supporting documents on a sampling basis and for independent audit.3 
6. 
To facilitate project implementation and funds flow, XFD on behalf of XUARG will, upon 
loan  effectiveness,  establish  the  imprest  account  at  a  commercial  bank  acceptable  to  ADB. 
Expenditures  not  using  the  imprest  account  may  use  other  disbursement  procedures  such  as 
commitment and reimbursement. 
Currency of the imprest account will be in US dollar. The imprest account is to be used 
7. 
exclusively for ADB’s share of eligible expenditures. XUARG, through XFD who established the 
imprest account in its name, is accountable and responsible for proper use of advances to the 
imprest account.4 The government may request for initial and additional advances to the imprest 
account based on 6 months estimated expenditures to be financed through the imprest account. 
The  imprest  account  will  be  established,  managed,  and  liquidated  in  accordance  with  ADB’s 
Loan Disbursement Handbook and detailed arrangements agreed by the government and ADB. 
ADB’s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  describes  which  supporting  documents  should  be 
submitted  to  ADB  and  which  should  be  retained  by  the  government  for  liquidation  and 
replenishment of an imprest account. 
8. 
Before  the  submission  of  the  first  withdrawal  application,  AMG,  through  APMO,  should 
submit to ADB sufficient evidence of the authority of the person(s) who will sign the withdrawal 
applications on behalf of the government, together with the authenticated specimen signatures 
of  each  authorized  person.  The  minimum  value  per  withdrawal  application  is  $100,000 
equivalent. Individual payments below this amount should be paid from the imprest account or 
by AMG, and subsequently claimed to ADB through reimbursement, unless otherwise accepted 
by ADB. 
9. 
For  the  counterpart  funds,  AMG  will  allocate  the  designated  funding  for  the  project  as 
specified  in  the  project  agreement.  Counterpart  funds  from  the  government  will  be  disbursed 
and  liquidated  by  the  implementing  agencies  to  contractors  and  service  providers.  The 
disbursement process will follow this process: (i) according to the progress of the contract, the 
implementing  agencies  will  submit  disbursement  request  to  APMO;  and  (ii)  once  approved, 
counterpart funds will be disbursed from the finance department of AMG if appropriate.

D.  Auditing and Public Disclosure 
11. 
AMG  will  cause  the  detailed  consolidated  project  financial  statements  to  be  audited  in 
accordance with International Standards on Auditing and the Government Auditing Standards of 
the  PRC  (where  these  are  consistent  with  International  Standards  on  Auditing),  by  an  auditor 
acceptable  to  ADB.  The  audited  project  financial  statement  will  be  submitted  in  the  English 
language to ADB within 6 months of the end of the financial year by the AMG. 
The  annual  audit  report  for  the  project  will  include  an  audit  management  letter 6 and 
12. 
auditor’s opinions which cover (i) whether the project financial statements present a true and fair 
view or are presented fairly, in all material respects, in accordance with the applicable financial 
reporting  framework;  (ii)  whether  loan  and  grant  proceeds  were  used  only  for  the  purposes  of 
the project or not; (iii) the level of compliance for each financial covenant contained in the legal 
agreements  for  the  project;  (iv)  use  of  the  imprest  fund  procedure;  and  (v)  use  of  the  SOE 
procedure certifying to the eligibility of those expenditures claimed under SOE procedures, and 
proper  use  of  the  SOE and imprest  procedures in accordance  with ADB’s  Loan  Disbursement 
Handbook and the project documents. 
13. 
Compliance  with  financial  reporting  and  auditing  requirements  will  be  monitored  by 
review  missions  and  during  normal  program  supervision,  and  followed  up  regularly  with  all 
concerned, including the external auditor. 
14. 
The government, XUARG, and AMG have been made aware of ADB’s policy on delayed 
submission, and the requirements for satisfactory and acceptable quality of the audited project 
financial  statements.  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  require  a  change  in  the  auditor  (in  a  manner 
consistent with the constitution of the borrower), or for additional support to be provided to the 
auditor, if the audits required are not conducted in a manner satisfactory to ADB, or if the audits 
are  substantially  delayed.  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  verify  the  project's  financial  accounts  to 
confirm  that  the  share  of  ADB’s  financing  is  used  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  policies  and 
procedures. 
15. 
Public  disclosure  of  the  audited  project  financial  statements  will  be  guided  by  ADB’s 
Public  Communications  Policy  (2011). 7  ADB  will  disclose  the  audited  project  financial 
statements and the opinion of the auditors on the project financial statements within 30 days of 
receipt by posting them on ADB’s website. The management letter will not be disclosed. 
5  Applicable  laws,  regulations  and  guidelines  include  (i)  The  Accounting  Law  of  the  PRC  (2000);  (ii)  State-owned 
Construction  Enterprise  Accounting  Control  Regulations;  (iii)  Capital  Construction  Financial  Control  Regulations; 
and (iv) Accounting Methods for Projects Financed by the World Bank. 
6  A management letter means formal communications from the auditor to the client management in accordance with 
the  International  Standard  on  Auditing  265  (communicating  deficiencies  in  internal  control  to  those  charged  with 
governance  and  management),  which  is  not  required  to  be  provided  separately  as  it  is  equivalent  to  the  Audit 
Findings and Recommendations prepared by the Project auditor and submitted to ADB.

PROCUREMENT AND CONSULTING SERVICES 
A. 
Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing 
All  advance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  will  be  undertaken  in  conformity  with 
1. 
ADB’s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2015,  as  amended from  time to time)1  and  Guidelines  on  the 
Use  of  Consultants  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  2  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank 
(ADB).  Advance  contracting  was  approved  on  23  January  2015  and  approval  of  retroactive 
financing was approved in ADB’s management review meeting in March 2015. The issuance of 
invitations  to  bid  under  advance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  will  be  subject  to  ADB 
approval.  It  was  explained  to  the  borrower,  Akesu  municipal  government  (AMG)  as  the 
implementing agency, as well as the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Government (XUARG) 
as  the  executing  agency,  that  (i)  advance  contracting  includes  the  advertisement,  bidding 
documents,  evaluation  of bids and up  to the  recommendation  of  contract  awards;  and, that  all 
steps  will  require  ADB’s  no  objection;  (ii)  approval  of  advance  contracting  and  retroactive 
financing  does  not  commit  ADB  to  finance  the  project;  and  (iii)  where  advance  contracting  is 
approved,  ADB's  approval  must  be  sought  for  the  draft  bidding  documents  before  they  are 
issued. 
2. 
To expedite project implementation, the government requested ADB to approve advance 
contracting,  which includes the  recruitment  of consultants  and procurement  of  civil  works;  and 
the request for retroactive financing of eligible expenditures for consulting services, civil works, 
and equipment procurement. 
Advance contracting. Advance contracting will include (i) tendering, bid evaluation, and 
3. 
award of contracts for civil works and equipment contract packages up to the recommendation 
of  contract  award;  and  (ii)  recruitment  of  consultants.  The  issuance  of  invitations  to  bid  and 
bidding  documents  under  advance  procurement  action  will  be  subject  to  ADB  approval.  The 
four  civil  works  contract  packages  (all  NCB),  six 
advance  contracting  will 
goods/equipment contract packages (four NCB and two shopping) and two consulting services 
contract packages (one QCBS and one ICS). 
include 
4. 
Retroactive financing. The government was informed that as a general rule, retroactive 
financing is permitted only if (i) it is specifically agreed by ADB and the Borrower; (ii) the goods, 
works,  services,  and  consultants  for  which  it  is  requested  are  procured  in  accordance  with 
ADB’s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time) and ADB’s Guidelines on 
the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time); (iii) the amount to be retroactively 
financed does not exceed 20% of the loan amount; and (iv) the expenditures must have been 
incurred  before  effectiveness  of  the  relevant  loan  but,  generally,  no  earlier  than  12  months 
before signing of the Loan Agreement. In either instance, detailed assessments (due diligence) 
on each retroactive financing proposal must demonstrate that (a) the expenditures incurred are 
genuine,  reasonable,  and  material  to  getting  the  project  off  the  ground;  and  (b)  they  were 
incurred for proper reasons, in a transparent manner over a reasonable period of time.

B.  Procurement of Goods, Works, and Consulting Services 
5. 
All  procurement  of  goods  and  works  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB’s 
Procurement  Guidelines  (2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  International  competitive 
bidding  (ICB)  will  be  used  for  civil  works  contracts  estimated  to  cost  $40  million  and  above. 
National competitive bidding (NCB) will be used for civil works contracts estimated to cost over 
$100,000  equivalent  up  to  below  $40  million.  For  goods  and  equipment,  ICB  will  be  used  for 
values  exceeding  $10  million,  while  NCB  will  be  used  for  goods  and  equipment  from  over 
$100,000  to  below  $10  million  equivalent.  For  NCB,  the  first  draft  English  language  of  the 
procurement  documents  (bidding  documents,  and  draft  contract)  should be  submitted for  ADB 
approval regardless of the estimated contract amount. Subsequent procurements are subject to 
post review. All ICB contracts are subject to prior review. Prior review and approval of ADB of 
the procurement documents (prequalification, bidding, contract) is required.  
6. 
A  procurement  plan  indicating  threshold  and  review  procedures,  goods,  works,  and 
consulting service contract packages and national competitive bidding guidelines is in  Section 
C. 
7. 
All consultants financed by ADB will be recruited according to ADB’s Guidelines on the 
Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time [footnote 2]). The terms of reference 
for  loan  implementation  consulting  services  and  start-up  consulting  service  are  detailed  in 
Section  D.  An  estimated  102  person-months  (16  international  and  86  national)  of  consulting 
services  are  required  to  (i)  facilitate  project  management  and  implementation,  (ii)  provide 
capacity building and institutional strengthening, and (iii) conduct external monitoring.

National Competitive Bidding 
13. 
The  Borrower’s  Law  of  Tendering  and  Bidding  of  the  People’s  Republic  of  China 
promulgated by Order No. 21 of the President of the People’s Republic of China on August 30, 
1999, are subject to the following clarifications required for compliance with the Guidelines: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
(v) 
(vi) 
(vii) 
All invitations to prequalify or to bid shall be advertised in the national press, or 
official  gazette,  or  a  free  and  open  access  website  in  the  Borrower’s  country. 
Such  advertisement  shall  be  made  in  sufficient  time  for  prospective  bidders  to 
obtain  prequalification  or  bidding  documents  and  prepare  and  submit  their 
responses.  In  any  event,  a minimum  preparation  period  of  thirty  (30)  days  shall 
be given. The preparation period shall count (a) from the date of advertisement, 
or  (b)  when the  documents  are  available for  issue,  whichever  date is  later. The 
advertisement  and  the  prequalification  and  bidding  documents  shall  specify  the 
deadline for such submission. 
Qualification  requirements  of  bidders  and  the  method  of  evaluating  the 
qualification of each bidder shall be specified in detail in the bidding documents, 
and  in  the  prequalification  documents  if  the  bidding  is  preceded  by  a 
prequalification process. 
If  bidding  is  preceded  by  a  prequalification  process,  all  bidders  that  meet  the 
qualification  criteria  set  out  in  the  prequalification  document  shall  be  allowed  to 
bid and there shall be no limit on the number of pre-qualified bidders. 
All  bidders  shall  be  required  to  provide  a  performance  security  in  an  amount 
sufficient to protect the Borrower/Project Executing Agency in case of breach of 
contract by the contractor, and the bidding documents shall specify the required 
form and amount of such performance security. 
Bidders shall be allowed to submit bids by mail or by hand. 
All bids shall be opened in public; all bidders shall be afforded an opportunity to 
be  present  (either  in  person  or  through  their  representatives)  at  the  time  of  bid 
opening, but bidders shall not be required to be present at the bid opening. 
All  bid  evaluation  criteria  shall  be  disclosed  in  the  bidding  documents  and 
quantified in monetary terns or expressed in the form of pass/fail requirements. 
(ix) 
(viii)  No  bid  may  be  rejected  solely  on  the  basis  that  the  bid  price  falls  outside  any 
standard contract estimate, or margin or bracket of average bids established by 
the Borrower/Project Executing Agency. 
Each contract shall be awarded to the lowest evaluated responsive bidder, that is, 
the bidder who meets the appropriate standards of capability and resources and 
whose bid has been determined (a) to be substantially responsive to the bidding 
documents  and  (b)  to  offer  the  lowest  evaluated  cost.  The  winning  bidder  shall 
not  be  required,  as  a  condition  of  award,  to  undertake  responsibilities  for  work 
not  stipulated  in  the  bidding  documents  or  otherwise  to  modify  the  bid  as 
originally submitted. 
Each  contract  financed  with  the  proceeds  of  the  Loan  shall  provide  that  the 
suppliers  and  contractors  shall  permit  ADB,  at  its  request,  to  inspect  their 
accounts  and  records  relating  to  the  performance  of  the  contract  and  to  have 
said accounts and records audited by auditors appointed by ADB. 
Government  owned  enterprises  in  the  Borrower’s  country  may  be  permitted  to 
bid if they can establish that they (a) are legally and financially autonomous, (b) 
operate  under  commercial  law  and  (c)  are  not  a  dependent  agency  of  the 
Borrower/Project Executing Agency. 
(xi) 
(x) 
(xii)  Re-bidding  shall  not  be  allowed  solely  because  the  number  of  bids  is  less  than 
three.

SAFEGUARDS 
A.  Environment 
Domestic  environmental 
impact  statement  and  consolidated  project 
1. 
initial 
environment  examination. The project is classified as Category B following ADB’s Safeguard 
Policy Statement (SPS, 2009). Screening of the components for domestic review and approval 
authorities  was  undertaken  at  the  initial  stages  of  domestic  environmental  impact  assessment 
(EIA)  process.  One  domestic  environment  impact  statement  (EIS)  has  been  prepared  for  all 
seven investment subcomponents by a qualified local institute in accordance with the PRC Law 
on  Environmental  Impact  Assessment  (2003)  using  methodologies  and  standards  consistent 
with  relevant  guidelines  established  by  the  Ministry  of  Environmental  Protection  and  Xinjiang 
Uygur  Autonomous  Region  (XUAR)  laws  and  regulations.  The  EIS  has  been  reviewed  by  a 
panel  of  10  national  experts,  and  approved  by  the  XUAR  Environment  Protection  Department 
on 25 November 2014. An initial environment examination (IEE) has been prepared by the AMG 
with assistance from project preparatory TA consultants and disclosed on the ADB website on 
25  February  2015.1 The  IEE  concludes  that  anticipated  impacts  will  be  localized,  short–term, 
and  reversible,  and  that  these  can  be  effectively  mitigated  through  application  of  good 
construction practices defined in the environmental management plan (EMP). The EMP defines 
mitigation measures, monitoring requirements, and institutional responsibilities to ensure proper 
environmental management throughout the project construction and operation.  
2. 
Anticipated impacts. Scoping was undertaken during the initial stages of the domestic 
EIA process. The potential impacts and risks were identified during the scoping exercise which 
drew  from  information  disclosures  and  consultations  with  key  stakeholders  ranging  from  the 
responsible  and  supervisory  government  agencies  to  members  of  the  local  communities. 
Environmental impacts are anticipated, but these are of a temporary nature and are covered by 
stringent  site  management  and  procedural  provisions  in  the  EMP.  During  preliminary  and 
detailed design stages, a number of environmental support provisions need to be put in place, 
including  (i)  an  analysis  of  sediment  quality  within  the  areas  of  the  wetland  to  be  dredged,  to 
confirm the assumed absence of contamination; (ii) a review of the construction drawings of the 
wetland component by the wetland and environment specialists of the LIC and ADB, to evaluate 
soundness of design and the extent of potential impacts from the final design; (iii) selection of 
quiet and efficient powered mechanical equipment (for construction) and pumps (for operation); 
(iv)  training  for  the  members  of  the  environment  management  group  of  the  APMO  to  ensure 
they understand well and can fully supervise the EMP; and (v) an asbestos risk assessment for 
the 28 small boilers to be decommissioned. 
3. 
During  construction,  dust,  noise,  and  temporary  traffic  disturbance  generated  by  road 
rehabilitation  activities  will  be  a  nuisance  to  nearby  residents.  Temporary  traffic  management 
plans  will  be  developed  and  implemented  in  coordination  with  local  traffic  police  and  in 
consultation  with  affected  communities.  All  new  roads  will  be  developed  with  safe  and 
adequately wide footpaths, fully segregated non-motorized lanes, and public transport facilities.2 
The  recreation  of  a  more  naturally  functioning  wetland  ecosystem  will  require  significant 
construction  activities,  involving  sediment  dredging  and  earthwork.  This  will  have  a  temporary 
impact  on  existing  wetland  functions  (biodiversity  and  habitats,  water  quality).  However,  these 
functions are expected to be significantly enhanced after project completion, with an estimated 
1  Initial Environmental Examination, including the EMP, is accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2.

57 
increase of the wetland’s total annual ecosystem services value by $1.1 million as a result of the 
project.3 The project will also have significant pollution abatement benefits.4  
4. 
During  operation,  major  potential  impacts  will  include  air,  noise,  and  solid  waste 
pollution—from  operation  of  the  project  roads;  noise  pollution—from  water  and  wastewater 
pump  stations  of  the  urban  water  supply,  sewerage,  and  central  heating  networks;  and  air, 
water,  noise,  solid waste pollution for the  operation  of the  other  project facilities (e.g.,  wetland 
science education center), and their possible effects on the protected species and their habitats. 
The  capacity  building  component  of  the  project  will  have  a  significant  role  in  addressing 
operational impacts and risks. The Akesu Forest Bureau will be provided with capacity building 
in  wetland  management  and  monitoring,  biodiversity  and  habitat  surveys.  The  construction 
bureau and the Akesu traffic and sanitation authorities will receive technical advice and support 
in  the  preparation  of  a  citywide  non-motorized  transport  management  plan  and  solid  waste 
management  plan,  and  in  the  preparation  of  traffic  safety  and  waste  reduction,  reuse,  and 
recycling (3R) awareness programs. 
Environmental  management  plan  implementation  responsibilities.  Institutional 
5. 
responsibilities in EMP implementation and supervision are defined and included in the project 
EMP. The XUARG as the executing agency will have the overall accountability for compliance 
with national and ADB environmental safeguard requirements. The  AMG, as the implementing 
agency,  will  be  accountable for  ensuring the  implementation  of  the  EMP,  including  inspection, 
monitoring,  public  participation,  grievance  redress,  reporting,  and  necessary  corrective 
measures.  The  APMO  will  assume  day-to-day  responsibility  for  supervising  implementation  of 
the  EMP.  In  the  design  stage,  the  APMO  will  pass  the  EMP  to  the  design  institute  for 
incorporating mitigation measures into the detailed designs. The EMP will be updated at the end 
of the detailed design by the APMO, submitted to ADB for clearance and disclosure, and finally 
be  passed  to  the  construction  contractors.  To  ensure  that  contractors  comply  with  the  EMP’s 
provisions, the international tendering agency, under the supervision of the APMO, will prepare 
and provide the following specification clauses for incorporation into the bidding procedures (i) a 
list of environmental management requirements to be budgeted by the bidders in their proposals, 
(ii) environmental clauses for contractual terms and conditions, and (iii) full  IEE, including EMP 
for  compliance.  The  APMO  will  also  handle  any  disputes  arising  from  noncompliance  with the 
EMP through the environment GRM. 
6. 
The  APMO  will  establish  an  environmental  management  group  (EMG)  staffed  with two 
trained  and  qualified  fulltime  environmental  specialists  (to  be  seconded  by  the  Akesu 
Environment  Protection  Bureau  (AEPB),  with  assistance  from  the  project  management  and 
capacity  building  consultants,  to  undertake  environmental  management  activities  including  (i) 
updating the EMP after detailed design and ensuring its effective implementation; (ii) reviewing 
and  approving  site-EMPs  developed  by  contractors,  supervising  their  environmental  activities 
the  environmental 
and  compliance  with 
management  companies  and/or  consultants,  including  the  external  environmental  monitoring 
the  site-EMP;  (iii)  recruiting  and  supervising 
3  The restored wetland biotope will provide regulating services (including water storage, supply and treatment; micro-
climate  regulation),  supporting  services  (biodiversity  maintenance  by  providing  resting,  nesting,  feeding  and 
breeding habitats for wildlife including migratory water birds), and cultural services (including research, education 
and recreation). 
4  29.3  million  liters  of  fuel  can  be  saved  per  year  from  the  improved  road  conditions,  resulting  in  the  reduction  of 
carbon dioxide emission by 215,000 tons per year. The use of waste heat from a combined heat and power plant to 
supply the district heating network will result in the closure of 28 low-efficient and high-polluting small boilers that 
will reduce coal use by 25,900 tons per year,  resulting in significant emission reduction in terms of  sulfur dioxide 
(173 tons), nitrogen oxide (1,559 tons), and carbon dioxide (64,000 tons).

station (EMS); (iv) inspecting, monitoring, and evaluating implementation of mitigation measures; 
(v)  establishing the grievance redress  mechanism (GRM)  and handling public  complaints;  and 
(vi) coordinating with other municipal agencies and ADB on all relevant environmental matters. 
The EMG will also implement training programs for contractors, conduct regular site visits and 
undertake inspections of the compliance of the contractors with the environmental management 
provisions in the contracts.  
7. 
The AMG will recruit a loan implementation consultant (LIC), including international and 
national  environment  specialists  through  international  competitive  bidding.  The  consultant  will 
assist  the  AMG  and  APMO  to  update  the  EMP,  establish  an  environment  management  and 
monitoring system at project level on the basis of the updated EMP and this PAM, supervise the 
compliance  with  ADB  safeguard  policies  and  PRC  environmental  protection  laws  and 
regulations,  and  ensure  that  the  environmental  reporting  requirements  are  met.  The  terms  of 
reference  for  the  environment  specialists  are  listed  in  Section  D  of  Chapter  VI.  Monitoring 
responsibilities and procedures are further discussed in Section B of Chapter IX. 
for 
Construction  contractors  and  construction  supervision  companies.  Construction 
8. 
contractors  will  be  responsible 
implementing  relevant  mitigation  measures  during 
construction  under  the  supervision  of  the  CSCs  and  APMO.  Contractors  will  develop  site-
specific EMPs based on the updated project EMP. CSCs will be contracted by the APMO. The 
CSCs  will  be  responsible  for  supervising  construction  progress  and  quality,  including  EMP 
implementation  on  construction sites.  Each  CSC  will  assign  one EHS staff  to  (i)  supervise the 
contractor’s  EMP  implementation  performance;  and  (ii)  prepare the  contractor’s  environmental 
management performance section in monthly project progress reports submitted to the APMO. 
9. 
Environmental  monitoring  station.  The  APMO  will  contract  the  Akesu  municipal 
environment  monitoring  station  at  project  city/county  level  to  conduct  periodic  environmental 
quality  monitoring  during  construction  and  operation  in  accordance  with  the  monitoring  plan 
included in the EMP. 
10. 
Grievance redress mechanism. Environment safeguards related grievances may occur 
during  construction  and  operation  of  the  project.  APMO  will  establish  an  environmental  GRM, 
coordinated by the EMG and under the guidance of the AEPB, which will follow the procedure 
and  timeframe  defined  in  the  EMP.  APMO  and  ADB  will  be  informed  on,  and  involved  in,  the 
grievance  resolution  process.  The  LIC  will  provide  training  on  the  GRM  to  ensure  that 
responsibilities and procedures are clear.  
11. 
Environmental training will be essential for the APMO and contractors to implement the 
EMP.  The  APMO  will  be  responsible  for  organizing  training  programs,  to  be  facilitated  by  the 
LIC and with resource persons from relevant agencies, which will cover (i) environmental laws, 
regulations,  and policies;  (ii)  implementing mitigation  measures; (iii)  operating  and  maintaining 
project  facilities;  (iv)  environmental  monitoring  and  supervision;  (v)  public  participation  and 
grievance redress; and (vi) documentation and reporting.  
B. 
Involuntary Resettlement 
12. 
Land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  The  project  is  classified  by  ADB  as  category  A  for 
involuntary resettlement. One resettlement plan was prepared, following the ADB’s SPS, 2009. 
In  order  to  avoid  or  minimize  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  there  was  close  consultation 
with  the  local  government  officials  and  affected  communities  during  the  preliminary  and 
feasibility  study  as  well  as  preliminary  design  stages  for  the  optimal  and  proper  engineering 
59 
schemes of the project. Based on the impact survey among seven components of output 1 and 
output  2  ,  the  urban  road  network  improvement  component,  and  the    wetland  rehabilitation 
output have larger land acquisition and resettlement impacts. According to the survey, a total of 
184 households with 790 persons  will  be  affected  by  land acquisition  and resettlement for  the 
project.  They  include  176  households  with  740  persons  to  be  affected  by  permanent  land 
acquisition,  21  households  with  120  persons  by  residential  house  demolishment,  and  13 
households  with  70  persons  affected  by  both  land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  In  total, 
1,502.93 mu (100.2 ha) of land will be affected permanently, including 825.13 mu (55 ha) state-
owned land, and 677.8 mu (45.19 ha) of collective-owned land. Of the total acquired collective-
owned land, 66.5% (450.6 mu or 30 ha) are cultivated land. Along with land acquisition, a total 
of  5,655  m2  of  residential  structures  will  be  demolished.  Of  the  total  affected  people,  43 
households  with  130  persons  are  vulnerable  groups.  They  include  37  households  under 
minimum  living  security  line,  four  households  with  disable members,  and  two  households  with 
living alone elderly. All of them are ethnic minorities. 
13. 
For the urban road network component, a total of 54.8 mu of land areas will be acquired 
from  two  villages  in  Yiganqi  Township  and  two  resident  committees  in  Hongqiao  Street 
Administration  Office.  A  total  of  36  households  with  180  persons  by  permanent  acquisition  of 
collective land; relocate 18 households with 108 persons due to the demolishment of residential 
structures. Of the total affected people, 11 households with 31 persons are vulnerable groups. 
In total,  54.8 mu  of  collective rural  land will  be  acquired  permanently,  including  27.2  mu (1.81 
ha) of housing plots, and 27.6 mu (1.84 ha) of farmland. 12.13 mu of public park land by Akesu 
Housing  and  Urban-Rural  Construction  Bureau  and  Akesu  City  Landscaping  Management 
Office  will  be  occupied.  A  total  of  4,855  m2  of  residential  structures  will  be  demolished.  Due 
diligence has been conducted for the  component, and it was identified that no remaining issues 
was left for the land acquisition and resettlement. 
14. 
For  the  wetland  rehabilitation  component,  a  total  of  1,436  mu  of  land  areas  will  be 
required, which include 813 mu of stated owned wetland park developed by Akesu City Water 
Resources  Bureau,  which  will  be  transferred  from  Akesu  City  Water  Resources  Bureau  to 
Akesu  City  Forest  Bureau,  and  623  mu  of  rural  land  areas,  which  will  be  acquired,  affecting 
three villages from Yiganqi Township. They include Bageqi, Yingbage, and Saikepaqi villages. A 
total of 140 households or 560 persons will be affected by permanent acquisition of 423 mu of 
farmland and 200 mu of fish pond. Of the total affected people, 32 households, or 99 persons 
are  vulnerable  groups.  Along  with  land  acquisition,  about  800  m2  of  structures  will  be 
demolished, affecting three households from Bageqi Village. 
15. 
The  compensation  of  the  permanent  land  acquisition  is  based  on  (i)  the  Land 
Administration Law of PRC, amended in 2004, Document 28: State Council Decision to Deepen 
Reform  and  Strictly  Enforce  Land  Administration  in  October  2004;  (ii)  Urban  House 
Demolishment Management Regulations of PRC, Property Law of PRC 2007; (iii) Department of

to comply with ADB’s SPS, 2009.  
16. 
Based  on  the  consultations  with  local  governments  and  those  affected,  and  general 
practice  in  Akesu  City,  the  resettlement  principles  established  for  the  project  are  (i)  land 
acquisition  and  involuntary  resettlement  should  be  avoided  or  minimized  where  feasible  by 
developing  and  comparing  a  series  of  design  alternatives;  (ii)  compensation  and  entitlements 
provided must be adequate to allow those affected to at least maintain their pre-project standard 
of  living,  with  the  prospect  of  improvement;  (iii)  land  temporarily  occupied  and  the  period  for 
disruption are to be kept to a minimum; (iv) all the people affected, legal and illegal, are to be 
taken  into  consideration  and  accounted  for;  (v)  resettlement  plan  should  be  prepared  and 
implemented  in  accordance  with  state  land  rehabilitation  policy,  national  economic  and  social 
development  plans,  and  ADB’s  SPS  2009;  (vi)  all  those  affected  will  be  adequately  informed 
about eligibility, compensation rates and standards, livelihood and income restoration plans, and 
project  timing;  (vii)  resettlement  plan  should  be  coordinated  with  such  things  as  regional 
development, economic development, and environmental protection; (viii) practical and feasible 
measures  should  be  formulated  to  restore  the  affected  items;  (ix)  a  preferential  policy  and 
assistance  will  be  provided  to  vulnerable  groups  in  such  things  as employment;  and (x)  close 
monitoring and timely actions will be carried out to identify and resolve any problems. 
17. 
Resettlement  and  livelihood  restoration.  The  resettlement  strategy  encompasses  (i) 
the replacement of housing, and (ii) the restoration of livelihoods and income. For people losing 
land,  cash  compensation  will  be  paid  to  the  affected  people  to  be  used  for  tertiary  industry 
development. For people losing housing, they will receive “cash compensation” or “replacement 
houses  in  the  resettlement  sites”.  With  cash  compensation,  the  resettled  residents  could 
purchase  resettlement  houses  or  commercial  houses  in  the  resettlement  sites  or  other  places 
they prefer. All the relocated households will also receive a relocation allowance. Assistance will 
be provided to find available housing close to their original homes, if that is the preference of the 
APs.  The  APMO  will  provide  necessary  assistance  for  relocation  during  resettlement 
implementation. 
18. 
The measures for economic rehabilitation include (i) providing technical skill training and 
employment opportunities to the affected persons, especially for the job requiring large amount 
of labor forces; (ii) development of service industry, such as clothing shop, grocery store, food 
catering  service,  hairdressing  salon,  dry  cleaning,  motorcycle  transportation  service  in  urban 
districts,  taxi  service,  hotel  service,  tourism  business,  and  other  businesses;  (iii)  provision  of 
social insurance; and (iv) providing employment opportunities generated by the construction and 
operation  of  the  project.  Technical  training  will  be  provided  to  the  affected  people  to  increase 
their skills. The workers for the closure of the 26 small coal-burning boilers will be re-employed 
within  the  existing  work  places  for  managing  new  heat  exchange  stations  or  assigned  to 
different positions within the same work units. For seasonal workers they will be allocated with 
temporary security or maintenance jobs in the same work units. The APMO will ensure that no 
job  will  be  lost.  The  re-employment  plan  for  the  closure  of  26  small  coal-burning  boilers  is 
included  in  the  resettlement  plan  as  part  of  the  due  diligence  report.  For  vulnerable  groups, 
attention  and  assistance  will  be given  to their  special  needs  and  expectations. The  APMO  will 
supervise implementation to ensure these vulnerable persons receive adequate compensation, 
livelihood and income restoration, housing arrangement, special fund, and MLG, and assistance 
to restore their living conditions and incomes. 
Information  disclosure,  public  participation,  and  grievance  redress.  The  people 
19. 
affected have been notified about the key elements of the resettlement plan, which is based on 
the measurement survey. On various occasions during measurement, social economic survey, 
61 
meetings  organized  by  village  committee  and  resident  committees,  and  other  participants 
between  May  and  July  2014,  people  affected  have  participated  in  the  planning  and  concerns 
have been integrated into the resettlement plan. AMG has especially established Akesu House 
Demolition  Command  Office  (AHDCO).  Through  the  village  and  residents  committees’ 
meetings,  and  visits  to  the  affected  households,  the  compensation  rates  and  resettlement 
issues  have  been  consulted,  their  feedback  and  comments  have  been  addressed,  and  the 
common opinions have been reached. All of their concerned issues and comments have been 
integrated  into  the  resettlement  plan.  More  consultation  meetings  will  be  held  in  future.  The 
resettlement  information  booklet  was  distributed  to  affected  community  and  households  in 
November 2014. One resettlement plan was prepared, following ADB’s SPS, 2009 and posted 
on  the  ADB  website  on  27  February  2015.  The  resettlement  plan  approved  by  AMG  will  be 
redistributed to production group, village committee and resident committees by February 2015 
to anyone wishing to consult the document at the village committee and/or resident committee 
offices.  The  APMO  will  be  responsible  for  supervising  implementation,  continuing  public 
consultation,  monitoring  progress  and  responding  to  grievances.  The  grievance  redress 
procedures  are  well  established  and  explanations  are  included  in  the  resettlement  plan  and 
resettlement information booklets. 
20. 
The grievance redress procedure has been established to solve resettlement issues that 
may  arise.  It  consists  of  four  stages.  The  four  stages  channels  include  (i)  affected  villages  or 
residential  committees;  (ii)  affected  township or sub-district governments;  (iii)  Akesu City  Land 
Resources Bureau and Akesu City House Demolition Office; and (iv) APMO or public complaint 
office of AMG. The stages of grievance redress mechanism are elaborated below: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
Stage  1:  If  any  of  the  affected  people  are  aggrieved  by  any  aspect  of  the  land 
acquisition  and  resettlement,  he  and/or  she  can  state  his  and/or  her  grievance 
and  appeal  to  the  village  committee  and/or  resident  committee  or  in  oral  or  in 
written  form.  If  an  oral  appeal  is  made,  the  village  committee  and/or  resident 
committee  will  record  it  on  paper  and  process  it.  The  village  committee  and/or 
resident committee  will  make decision  on  or  resolve it  in  2  weeks. The affected 
people will be informed of the result via written notice. 
Stage  2:  If  the  aggrieved  affected  people  are  dissatisfied  with  the  decision  in 
Stage  1,  he  and/or  she  can  appeal  to  the  township  government  office/street 
administration  office  after  receiving  the  decision;  the  township  government 
office/street  administration  office  will  reach  a  decision  in  2  weeks.  The  affected 
people will be informed of the result via written notice. 
Stage 3: If the aggrieved affected people are still dissatisfied with the decision of 
the  township  government  office,  he  and/or  she  will  appeal  to  Akesu  Land 
Resource Bureau (ALRB) or Akesu House Demolition Command Office (AHDCO) 
after  receiving  the  decision.  Affected  people  could  come  to  ALRB  or  AHDCO 
directly if he or she chooses to do so. The ALRB or AHDCO will reach a decision 
in two weeks. The affected people will be informed of the result via written notice. 
Stage 4: If the aggrieved affected people are till dissatisfied with the decision of 
the  ALRB  or  AHDCO,  he  and/or  she  will  appeal  to  APMO  after  receiving  the 
decision. The APMO will reach a decision in 2 weeks. The affected people will be 
informed of the result via written notice. 
21. 
Displaced  persons  may  file  an  appeal  on  any  aspect  of  resettlement,  including 
compensation  rates,  etc.  The  above  means  of  appeal,  and  the  names,  locations,  persons 
responsible, and telephone numbers of the appeal accepting agencies will be communicated to 
the displaced persons at a meeting, through an announcement or the resettlement information 
booklet,  so that  the  displaced  persons  know  their  right  of  appeal.  Mass media  will  be  used  to 
62 
strengthen publicity  and reporting,  and  the  resettlement  organization will  share comments  and 
suggestions on resettlement from all parties concerned. All agencies will accept grievances and 
appeals from the affected persons for free, and costs so reasonably incurred will be disbursed 
from  the  contingency  costs.  During  the  whole  design  and  construction  period  of  the  project, 
these appeal procedures will remain effective to ensure that the affected persons can use them 
to address relevant issues. Affected persons can also submit complaints to ADB which will be 
handled by the project team. If an affected person is still not satisfied and believes he/she has 
been  harmed  due  to  non-compliance  with  ADB  policy,  s/he  may  submit  a  complaint  to  ADB’s 
Accountability Mechanism.5 
22. 
Institutional  arrangements.  The  AMG  has  especially  established  Akesu  House 
Demolition Command Office (AHDCO), and will arrange 10 to 20 staff to be responsible for the 
LAR  implementation  activities,  and  drawing  staff  from  relevant  departments  directly  under  the 
municipal  government.  The  AHDCO  will  work  closely  with  village  committee  and/or  resident 
committee,  township  government,  land  resources  department,  and  resettlement  plan  design 
institute,  who  are  mainly  responsible 
the  project  planning, 
implementation, financial account, and LAR supervision. The training of the APMO and AHDCO 
staff, and relevant organizations will be conducted by the entrusted independent monitoring and 
evaluation agency. 
the  coordination  of 
for 
Cost  estimates  and implementation  schedule. The cost estimate for land acquisition 
23. 
and  resettlement  is  CNY143.6  million  or  $23.14  million  at  the  prices  of  2014,  including 
compensation  for  permanent  land  acquisition,  residential  house  demolishment,  ground 
attachments,  relocation  allowances,  relevant  land  taxes,  M&E,  other  costs,  and  contingency. 
The land acquisition and resettlement activities will start in April 2015 and will be completed in 
December  2019.  Construction  will  not  take  place  before  the  affected  people  are  fully 
compensated  and  relocated,  and  all  arrangements  are  made  to  commence  the  livelihood 
rehabilitation activities and the affected people are registered for these. 
24.  Monitoring  and  evaluation.  Internal  and  external  monitoring  of  the  resettlement  plan 
implementation  will  be  conducted  semiannually  to  ensure  successful  implementation  of  the 
resettlement plan. The internal supervision and monitoring will be conducted by the APMO and 
AHDCO  to  ensure  the  resettlement  activities  to  be  implemented  according  to  the  resettlement 
plan. The external monitoring and evaluation will be conducted by an independent resettlement 
monitoring  agency,  and  they  are  responsible  for  the  submission  of  the  semiannual  monitoring 
and  evaluation  reports  to  the  executing  agency,  implementing  agency,  APMO,  and  ADB.  The 
first monitoring report will be submitted by the end of July 2015.

The project is classified by ADB category B for the indigenous peoples safeguard. Ethnic 
25. 
minorities  constitute  46.4%  and  53.8%  of  the  population  in  the  direct  and  indirect  area 
respectively in Akesu. Although the urban communities are ethnically mixed, some aspects such 
as  cultural,  religious,  and  linguistic  differences  are  maintained.  All  households  in  the  urban 
areas will  benefit from the  new  and upgraded  infrastructure  services in road,  public  parks  and 
green  space,  waste  and  wastewater,  central  heating,  solid  waste  management,  and 
rehabilitated  Akesu  Duolang  wetlands.  The  subcomponent  on  community  lanes  upgrading 
targets  five  peri-urban  communities  that  are  inhabited  mostly  by  ethnic  minorities,  particularly 
the Uygur. 
An  ethnic  minority  development  plan  (EMDP) 6  has  been  prepared  to  facilitate  the 
26. 
inclusion  of  ethnic  minority  people  in  all  project  activities  and  to  protect  them  from  any 
disadvantages  that  language  barriers  may  create  with  respect  to  employment  by  project 
contractors. The EMDP also includes measures to ensure that their customs and beliefs will be 
respected throughout implementation. Ethnic minorities will not be adversely affected, except for 
724  Uygur  minority  persons  from  172  households  for  resettlement  and  104  persons  from  18 
households  for  residential  house  demolition.  Appropriate  livelihood  restoration  measures 
associated with resettlement are incorporated in the resettlement plan. 
27. 
Key  issues  addressed  in  the  EMDP  ensure  (i)  that  affected  ethnic  minority  people  are 
effectively  involved  in planning,  implementation, and monitoring of the  project;  (ii)  that  impacts 
and risks potentially affecting ethnic minority people are mitigated; and (iii) that ethnic minority 
people  will  benefit  from  such  positive  impacts  as  temporary  job  creation.  The  EMDP  includes 
measures  to  mitigate  potential  social  risks  and  to  enhance  project  benefits,  particularly  for 
women and the poor. The project will support (i) the targets set for the contractors with respect 
to the  employment  of  ethnic  minorities  (45%),  including  females;  (ii)  measures  to facilitate  the 
effective  inclusion  of  ethnic  minorities  (at  least  50%)  in  project  activities  through  the  public 
participation  and  awareness,  by  removing  potential  language  and  cultural  barriers  to  such 
participation;  and  (iii)  measures  to  reduce  the  risk  of  unintentional  offence  being  caused  to

ethnic  minority  communities  during  project  implementation.  The  resettlement  plans  provide  for 
special  training  to  assist  ethnic  minorities  affected  by  land  acquisition  or  resettlement. 
Implementation and monitoring of the EMDP is included in the loan assurances and design and 
monitoring  framework.  The  plan  also  includes  the  Akesu  municipal  government  financed 
enhancement  program  for  the  ethnic  minorities  to  increase  their  skills,  employment  and 
entrepreneurship in the three priorities of skill training and knowledge improvement, provision of 
employment opportunities, and access to small loan program. 
The actions to be implemented under the EMDP are for the most part to be included as 
28. 
part  of  the  project’s  administrative  budget.  Where  local  government  agencies  collaborate  with 
actions in the EMDP, the local government administrative budgets will cover the costs of local 
government staffing and other related costs. Each project operation agency (POA) will nominate 
at least one person  responsible for overseeing the implementation of the EMDP, the social and 
gender  action  plan,  and  to  coordinate  the  social  monitoring.  AMG  will  provide  support  as 
necessary, as will the community offices, the county centers for disease control (CDC) and the 
labor bureaus. An external monitoring agency to provide independent monitoring and evaluation 
of the EMDP has been included in the overall project budget. 
29. 
Prior to the commencement of any component, the APMO will ensure that briefings on 
ADB’s  policies  with  respect to ethnic minorities, and on the  EMDP,  are provided both for  their 
own  members,  and  for  POAs.  The  ethnic  and  religious  affairs  bureaus  (ERABs)  will  assist  in 
these  briefings.  Contractors,  their  supervisors,  and  workers  will  also  be  required  to  undergo 
briefings  on  local  ethnic  minority  customs  and  beliefs,  and  to  ensure  that  no  offence  to  ethnic 
minority beliefs or customs occurs during construction. The national social safeguards specialist 
in  the  loan  implementation  consulting  services  will  support  EMDP  implementation  and 
monitoring. The project ethnic minority development plan endorsed by the government has been 
disclosed  on  3  March  2015  in  Chinese,  Uyghur,  and  Kazakh  languages  to  ethnic  minority 
people targeted  by  the project. The  ethnic minority  development  plan  has also  been  uploaded 
on the ADB website. Detailed monitoring and reporting arrangements are included in the PAM 
and the project agreement.

VIII.  GENDER AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS 
A.  Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy 
This section describes the required actions for gender and social dimensions, other than 
1. 
social  safeguards.  A  social,  poverty,  and  gender  analysis  was  undertaken  in  accordance 
guidelines  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank.  The  analysis  collected  information to  assist  in  the 
design of the project by identifying the poor, examining causes of poverty, and recommending 
poverty reduction measures within the scope of the project. 
2. 
Key issues. XUAR covers almost one-sixth of the total area of the PRC, but only about 
1.6%  of  the  country’s  total  population.  XUAR  has  a  large  ethnic  minority  population,  with  the 
Uygur  accounting  for  45.73%  and  other  ethnic  minority  groups  for  14.77%.  It  is  one  of  the  12 
less-developed  provinces  and  autonomous  regions  targeted  by  the  national  government’s 
“Western  Development  Strategy”  for  accelerated  socioeconomic  development  and  poverty 
reduction. In 2012, it ranked at 28th out of 31 regions in terms of per capita annual disposable 
income of urban households at CNY17,921, and 22nd in terms of per capita annual net income 
of rural households at CNY6,394. In 2013, the poverty incidence rate in Akesu City was 5.45% 
for  the  urban  population,  and  12.3%  for  the  rural  population.  There  are  a  total  of  58  poverty 
villages  in  the  city,  of  which  two  are  XUAR  designated  poverty  villages.  Ayikule  is  Akesu 
prefecture designated poverty township with 21 poverty villages. As the economic and cultural 
center for Akesu prefecture, Akesu City has expanded rapidly, with its urban population growing 
from 422,470 in 2005 to 509,200 in 2013, reaching an urbanization rate of 61.2%, and the built-
up  area  expanding  from  27  square  kilometer  (km2)  in  2005  to  46.5  km2  in  2013.  The 
urbanization rate is expected to surpass 64% by 2015.1 Although Akesu City is a poor area, it 
also has big potential for fast growth.  However, lack of basic urban infrastructure services and 
degraded  environment  as  well  as lack  of  jobs for  the  poor  are the key  impediments  to growth 
and poverty reduction in the city. Currently in the project areas of Akesu City, access to water, 
sanitation  and  heating  is  low  and  variable.  The  percentage of  households  connected  to  piped 
urban  water  supply  account  for  52.6%,  the  percentage  of  households  with  sewerage 
connections  account  for  8.0%,  the  percentage  of  households  with  access  to  central  heating 
account for 12.7%, and the percentage of households disposing their garbage into garbage bins 
and  then  collected  by  the  environment  sanitation  bureau  account  for  16.7%,  and  collected  by 
the environmental sanitation bureau through house-to-house account for only 2.0%. The project 
will  improve  mobility  and  accessibility,  sanitation  and  public  health,  livelihoods  and  the  overall 
quality of life for the people of Akesu City, and will enable sustained economic growth, industrial 
and tourism development, urbanization, and environmental improvement for Akesu City. 
3. 
The  project  will  directly  benefit  263,830  people,  of  which  122,420  or  46.4%  are  ethnic 
minorities, and 44,320 people or 16.8% are poor. The project will create 12,130 person-years of 
direct  and  31,510  person-years  of  indirect  employment  opportunities  during  the  project 
construction  phase,  including  a  target  for  about  45%  employment  for  women,  50%  ethnic 
minorities,  and  20%  poor.  It  will  generate  2,760  direct  jobs  and  7,180  indirect  jobs  during  the 
project operation phase. The XUARG and AMG have assured that employment priorities will be 
given  to  vulnerable  groups,  including  women,  the  poor,  and  ethnic  minorities.  To  ensure  the 
positive benefits of transport and road safety, water and sanitation, and wetland and biodiversity 
protection interventions, public awareness and education in “living street” concept  and human-
centered traffic  system,  urban  sanitation,  community-based  3Rs,  and  wetland  and  biodiversity

protection  will  be  conducted  during  the  course  of  the  project  supported  by  the  loan 
implementation  consulting  services.  These  programs  will  particularly  address  the  needs  and 
risks for women and children from increased transport demand and environmental degradation. 
Social  and  gender  indicators  will  be  included  in  the  project  performance  management  system 
(PPMS), and appropriate consultant inputs for implementation and monitoring of both plans are 
included in the supervision consultant package. 
4. 
Design  features.  The  project  design  directly  responds  to  issues  raised  by  the  poverty 
and social analysis, related to basic urban infrastructure. Key design features include (i) setting 
employment targets for women, ethnic minorities, and the poor in construction and operations; 
(ii)  strengthening  public  participation  and  consultation  in  decision-making  related  to  public 
hearings for urban water supply and sanitation, heating supply, and solid waste  management; 
(iii)  targeting  beneficiary  ethnic  minority  people  through  skills  and  employment  enhancement 
programs  funded  by  the  local  government;  (iv)  more  focus  on  providing  public  education  and 
pilot programs on “living street” concept, human-centered traffic system, integrated solid waste 
management,  and  wetland  management  and  biodiversity  protection.  In  addition,  it  ensures  (i) 
protection of labor that will be employed on project works, and (ii) mitigation of HIV/AIDS, drug 
and  human  trafficking.  The  EMDP  and  SGAP  outlined  actions  to  ensure mitigation  of  adverse 
impacts and increase positive impacts of the project. Implementation and monitoring of SGAP is 
included in the loan assurances. 
B. 
Social and Gender Action Plan 
The social and gender action plan (SGAP)2 has been prepared for the project. It sets out 
5. 
activities (i) for the mitigation of adverse impacts and risks identified in the course of the poverty 
and social analysis of the project, and (ii) to help maximize the benefits to be derived from the 
project.  Actions  include  (i)  targets  for  employment  of  local  labor,  women,  the  poor  and  ethnic 
minorities  during  construction  and  operation;  (ii)  public  awareness  program  on  construction 
safety  and  labor  law;  (iii)  measures  to  reduce  potential  risks,  such  as,  HIV/AIDS,  sexual 
harassment,  drugs  and  human  trafficking,  health  protection;  (iv)  public  participation  and 
education  in  wetland  management  and  biodiversity  protection;  (v)  public  awareness  and 
education  for  urban  road  network  and  associated  infrastructures,  public  and  street  parks,  and 
solid  waste  management,  and  (vi)  public  hearing  for  water,  heating  supply  and  solid  waste 
management.

The  project  is  categorized  by  ADB  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming  (EGM).  The 
6. 
project will have significant benefits for women to reduce the energy, time, and effort spent by 
women  on  these  activities,  allowing  them  greater  participation  in  income-generating  activities, 
family entertainment, or leisure. Women strongly support the project across all subcomponents, 
and they  perceive that the  project  will  improve their  quality  of  life and  create employment  and 
income opportunities for them. The SGAP will help to ensure (i) increased women’s participation 
in the project, including a target for at least 45% employment for women and 20% for the poor; 
(ii) participation and gender sensitive trainings on public road safety and integrated solid waste 
management programs with up to 50% female participation; (iii) participation in capacity building 
activities; and (iv) appropriate gender targets, indicators and sex-disaggregated data for project 
monitoring and evaluation. A national social development specialist with gender experiences will

be provided under the capacity development component to ensure the effective implementation 
of the SGAP (see Table 1). An assurance for implementation of the SGAP has been included. 
7. 
To address the risk of spread of HIV/AIDS, the project requires (i) inclusion of clauses on 
HIV/AIDS  and  other  communicable  disease  into  contract  bidding  documents;  (ii)  conduct  of 
public  health  and  HIV/AIDS  prevention  education 
the  civil  works  contractors;  (iii) 
establishment  of  health  measures  for  construction  workers  (e.g.,  setting  up  a  temporary 
infirmary, using local medical resources); and (iv) conduct of diverse publicity activities on HIV/ 
AIDS (e.g., brochures, posters and picture albums).

Labor  issues.  Core  labor  standards  will  be  implemented.  Civil  works  contracts  will 
stipulate priorities to (i) employ local people for works, (ii) ensure equal opportunities for women 
and men, (iii) pay equal wages for work of equal value, (iv) pay women’s wages directly to them, 
(v)  not  employ  children  or  forced  labor,  and  (vi)  ensure  that  all  contracted  labor  have  written 
contracts.  Specific  targets  for  employment  have  been  included  in  the  SGAP.  Construction 
workers  from  the  local  communities  will  be  trained  on  sanitation  knowledge  campaigns  and 
training,  and  capacity  building  will  be  undertaken  to  protect  their  legal  labor  rights.  AMG  will 
monitor  contractors’  compliance  with  these  project  assurances  in  conjunction  with  the  Human 
Resources and Social Security Bureau, and Civil Affairs Bureau. 
AMG is responsible for the implementation of the SGAP. Under the project management

consulting services, a social safeguard specialist will be engaged to support  APMO director to 
implement, monitor, and report on progress of the  resettlement plan, EMDP, SGAP, and other 
social aspects. They will be monitored semiannually and reported via periodic progress reports.

D.  Monitoring 
1. 
Project Performance Monitoring 
The  project  performance  management  system  (PPMS)  indicators,  their  relevance,  and 
1. 
monitoring  practicalities  will  be  discussed  with  XPMO,  APMO,  POAs;  other  relevant  AMG 
agencies and project beneficiaries during project implementation.  Disaggregated baseline data 
for  output  and  outcome  indicators  gathered  during  project  processing  will  be  updated  and 
reported through the periodic progress reports of the APMO and after each ADB review mission. 
These periodic reports will provide information necessary to update ADB's project performance 
reporting  system.1  At  the  start  of  project  implementation,  APMO,  with  support  from  the  loan 
implementation consulting services, will develop integrated PPMS procedures to systematically 
generate data on the inputs and outputs of the components, as well as the indicators to be used 
to  measure  the  project’s  impact  and  outcome  taking  into  account  the  components’  scope. 
APMO  will  be  responsible  for  monitoring  and  reporting  on  project  performance.  The  basis  for 
performance  monitoring  will  be  the  design  and  monitoring  framework,  which  identifies 
performance  targets  for  the  impact,  outcomes,  and  outputs  of  the  project.  By  collecting  data 
from  sources  identified  in  the  DMF,  APMO  will  be  able  to  report  on  an  annual  basis  the 
performance  of  the  project.  Specific  reporting  requirements  will  be  set  out  in  the  agreement 
between ADB and the government. APMO will collect the data, calculate the indicators, analyze 
the  results,  and  prepare  a  brief  report  describing  the  extent  to  which  the  project  is  generating 
the intended outputs and outcomes, as well as the overall impact on Akesu City. The relevance 
and  practicability  of  data  collection  for  indicators  was  confirmed  with  APMO.  Meanwhile,  the 
agreed  socioeconomic  and  environmental  indicators  to  be  used  will  be  further  enhanced  to 
measure project impacts. APMO agreed and confirmed that they will (i) refine and integrate the 
PPMS framework at the start of project implementation; (ii) confirm that targets are achievable; 
(iii) develop recording, monitoring, and reporting arrangements; and (iv) establish systems and 
procedures no later than 6 months after project inception. 
2. 
Once  the  project  is  started,  a  procurement  review  for  effective  implementation  (PREI) 
will be considered at the midterm review stage to revisit the procurement capacity assessment 
(Attachment 2 to this PAM). 
2. 
Compliance Monitoring 
AMG, with assistance of the project implementation consultants will conduct compliance 
3. 
monitoring,  and  submit  reports  and  information  to  ADB  concerning  (i)  the  use  of  the  loan 
proceeds, (ii) project implementation, (iii) implementing agencies’ project performance, and (iv) 
compliance with loan and project covenants. These reports will include (i) semiannual progress 
reports  on  project  implementation,  and  (ii)  a  project  completion  report,  which  should  be 
1   ADB's  project  performance  reporting  system  is  available  at  http://www.adb.org/Documents/Slideshows/PPMS/ 
default.asp?p=evaltool 
80 
submitted  not  later  than  three  months  after  the  completion  of  the  project  facilities.  The 
compliance  status  of  loan  and  project  covenants  will  be  reported  and  assessed  through 
semiannual progress report. ADB review missions will verify the status. 
3. 
Safeguards Monitoring 
a. 
Environment 
4. 
Environment  safeguards  monitoring  will  include  (i)  project  readiness  monitoring,  to  be 
conducted by the loan implementation environment consultant (LIEC); (ii) environmental impact 
monitoring,  to  be  conducted  by  a  licensed  entity;  and  (iii)  EMP  compliance  verification  during 
project  implementation  and  the  first  year  of  project  operation,  to  be  conducted  by  APMO  and 
LIEC. Monitoring and reporting arrangements defined for this project are described below. 
5. 
Assessment  of  project  readiness.  Before  construction,  the  LIEC  will  assess  the 
project’s  readiness  in  terms  of  environmental  management  based  on  a  set  of  indicators  and 
report  it  to  the  ADB  and  APMO.  This  assessment  will  demonstrate  that  environmental 
commitments are being carried out and environmental management systems are in place before 
construction starts, or suggest corrective actions to ensure that all requirements are met. 
6. 
Environmental  impact  monitoring.  During construction, regular environmental impact 
monitoring  will  be  conducted  by  the  Akesu  Environmental  Monitoring  Station  (AEMS), 
contracted  by  APMO.  In  addition,  construction  supervision  consultants  will  be  required  to 
conduct frequent internal noise and air quality monitoring around construction sites and to report 
monitoring  results  in  the  framework  of  their  quarterly  progress  reports  to  APMO.  During 
operation, the APMO will contract the AEMS to conduct environmental impact monitoring during 
the  first  year  of  operation.  Monitoring  will  also  be  periodically  conducted  by  the  local 
environmental  authorities  in  the  framework  of  their  legal  mandate  to  check  compliance  with 
applicable  environmental  regulations.  They  will  be  responsible  for  undertaking  regular  and 
random environmental monitoring and inspection activities before, during, and after construction 
as well as in the event of emergencies. 
7. 
Environmental  management  plan  compliance  verification  and  reporting.  The 
environmental management plan (EMP) compliance monitoring will be undertaken by the APMO, 
with support of LIEC. APMO will report to ADB the project’s adherence to the EMP, information 
on  project  implementation,  environmental  performance  of  the  contactors,  and  environmental 
compliance  through  the  semiannual  project  progress  reports  and  annual  EMP  progress  and 
monitoring  reports.  Semiannual  progress  reports  by  APMO  to  ADB  will  include  a  summary  of 
EMP implementation progress. The LIEC will support the APMO in developing the annual EMP 
progress  and monitoring  reports. The  reports  should confirm the  project’s  compliance with the 
EMP,  and  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  requirements  in  the  People’s  Republic  of 
China  (PRC),  and  identify  any  environment  related  implementation  issues  and  necessary 
corrective  actions,  and  reflect  these  in  a  corrective  action  plan.  The  performance  of  the 
contractors  will  also  be  reported  on  with  respect  to  environmental  protection  and  impact 
mitigation.  The  operation  and  performance  of  the  project  grievance  redress  mechanism, 
environmental institutional strengthening and training, and compliance with all covenants under 
the project will also be included in the report. 
81 
Environmental  acceptance  monitoring  and  reporting.  Within  3  months  after  each 
8. 
component completion, or no later than 1 year with permission of the Akesu EPB, environmental 
acceptance  monitoring  and  audit  reports  of  completion  of  each  subcomponent  shall  be  (i) 
prepared  by  a  licensed  environmental  monitoring  institute  in  accordance  with  the  PRC 
Regulation  on  Project  Completion  Environmental  Audit  (Ministry  of  Environmental  Protection, 
2001),  (ii)  reviewed  for  approval  of  the  official  commencement  of  individual  component 
operation  by  environmental  authorities,  and  (iii)  included  in  the  EMR  submitted  to  ADB.  The 
environmental acceptance reports of the component completions will indicate the timing, extent, 
effectiveness  of  completed  mitigation  and  of  maintenance,  and  the  needs  for  additional 
mitigation measures and monitoring during operations. 
b. 
Resettlement 
9. 
Internal and external monitoring of resettlement plan implementation will be conducted. 
Monitoring  methodologies  are  specified  in  the  resettlement  plan.  The  project  management 
consulting  service  will  carry  out  internal  supervision  and  monitoring  and  reporting  to  ensure 
compliance  with  the  provisions  of  the  resettlement  plan.  APMO  and  the  loan  implementation 
consulting services will agree to a set of supervision milestones with ADB, to ensure timely and 
effective  implementation  of  resettlement  activities.  An  independent  agency  under  contract  to 
APMO  will  implement  the  external  monitoring  and  evaluation.  The  budget  for  external 
resettlement  monitoring  has  been  included  in  the  loan  implementation  consulting  services. 
Semiannual external monitoring reports will be forwarded directly to ADB. 
c. 
Ethnic Minority Development Plan

to  ensure 
4. 
Social and Gender Action Plan Monitoring 
11.  Monitoring  of  the  social  and  gender  action  plan  (SGAP)  will  be  incorporated  into  the 
PPMS. Clear targets and indicators have been established and some indicators, such as those 
on employment, are also captured in the DMF. Assistance will be provided for the executing and 
implementing agencies by the resettlement and social development consultant who will help to 
set  up  effective  monitoring  systems  and  work  with  the  focal  points  in  the  executing  and 
implementing  agencies  to  ensure  implementation  of  the  SGAP.  The  SGAP  will  be  monitored 
semiannually  and  reported  via  the  periodic  project  progress  reports  and  during  ADB  review 
missions. 
E. 
Evaluation and Reporting 
12. 
ADB, XUARG, and AMG will undertake annual review missions to evaluate the progress 
of  project  implementation.  ADB,  XUARG,  and  AMG  will  undertake  a  comprehensive  midterm 
review  2  years  after  the  start  of  project  implementation  to  have  a  detailed  evaluation  of  the 
scope, implementation arrangements, safeguard, SGAP, achievement of scheduled targets, and

Involuntary resettlement. All of the affected households (street committees and villages, 
leaders  and  town  and  township,  and  district  governments)  were  involved  in the  project  impact 
and  socioeconomic  survey.  Through  meetings,  interviews,  focus  group  discussions,  public 
consultation  workshops,  and  community  consultation  meetings;  local  representatives  have 
participated  in  the  planning  and  concerns  have  been  integrated  into  the  resettlement  plan. 
Before  implementation,  APMO  will  further  discuss  and  consult  with  the  affected  persons’ 
representatives the impacts on local communities and the detailed compensation plan to ensure 
affected  persons’  interests  are  protected  and  to  provide  employment  opportunities  for  the 
affected  persons’  livelihoods  as  a  result  of  project  implementation.  APMO  will  disclose  the 
resettlement  plan  in the offices  as  well  as the  community  offices  and  to affected  people  in the 
local  language.  The  resettlement  plan  is  also  posted  on  the  ADB  website.  Resettlement 
information booklets were distributed to affected households. This guideline contains information 
85 
such  as  the  affected  project  area,  proposed  land  acquisition  and  relocation  implementation 
progress  and  procedure,  compensation  standards  for  land  acquisition,  relocation  assistance, 
and  livelihood  restoration  strategy.  APMO  will  establish  a  resettlement  unit  for  supervision  of 
implementation,  continued  public  consultation,  monitoring  of  progress,  and  response  to 
grievances. The grievance redress procedures will be established and explanations have been 
included in the resettlement information booklets. 
20. 
Ethnic minority, and social and gender action plan. Consultations with communities 
have taken place and will continue at different points in the preparation and  implementation of 
the  EMDP  and SGAP  within the  project,  and  will  be  designed not  only  to  inform  people about 
the  component  or  specific  activities  related  to  its  preparation  and  implementation,  but  also  to 
enable  people  in  the  community  to  ask  questions,  make  suggestions,  state  preferences,  and 
express concerns. Special attention will be paid to the participation of women, ethnic minorities, 
and any  other  vulnerable groups,  such  as  the  poor. The  PMO  and  implementing agencies  will 
disclose  the  EMDP  in  the  offices  as  well  as  the  community  offices  and  to  ethnic  minority 
beneficiaries in the local language. The EMDP is available on the ADB website.  EMDP  will be 
monitored  and  reported  semiannually  and  verified  by  external  resettlement  and  social 
monitoring  consultant.  Disclosure  of  social  monitoring  reports  to  affected  people  will  be 
undertaken during project implementation. 
SGAP indicators will be monitored and reported semiannually and verified by an external 
21. 
resettlement  and  social monitor.  As  part  of the SGAP, the  project  will  include extensive public 
awareness and outreach program on (i) “living streets” concept, which will be piloted in selected 
residential  alleys  in  low-income,  ethnic  minority  communities  of  Akesu,  whereby  suitable 
community streets (to be identified in a participatory process with affected communities) will be 
designed  as  a  social  and  shared  space  where  people  can  meet,  and  where children  can  play 
safely,  aiming  to  reduce  both  the  speed  and  dominance  of  motorized  transport;  (ii)  human-
centered  traffic  system  that  will  take  into  account  road  safety,  non-motorized  transport,  and 
integration  of  public  transport  system.  A  traffic  safety  awareness  campaigns  with  schools, 
drivers  association,  and  communities  will  be  supported  to  enhance  safety  awareness;  (iii) 
wetland  rehabilitation  to  strengthen  existing  wetland  functions  through  establishment  of  a 
wetland  management  and  monitoring  system,  including  an  education  and  research  center  to 
inform  the  public  on  the  wetland’s  ecosystem  services  and  protection  importance;  and  (iv)  a 
citywide  solid  waste  management  and  introducing  the  concept  of  the  3R  principle.  Public 
hearings  will  be  held  for  any  proposed  adjustments  in  transportation,  urban  water  supply, 
wastewater,  solid  waste,  and  central  heating  tariff  attended  with  adequate  representation  of 
poor, women, and ethnic minorities.

ANTICORRUPTION POLICY 
1. 
ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its  agents,  any  violations  of  the 
Anticorruption Policy relating to the project.1 All contracts financed by ADB shall include provisions 
specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of the executing agency 
and  all  project  contractors,  suppliers,  consultants,  and  other  service  providers.  Individuals  and/or 
entities on ADB’s anticorruption debarment list are ineligible to participate in ADB-financed activity 
and may not be awarded any contracts under the project.2 
2. 
To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  are  included  in  the  projects  and  loan 
agreements,  and  the  bidding  documents  for  the  project.  ADB’s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as 
amended to  date)  will  be  explained  to  and  discussed  with  AMG  and XUARG.  Consistent  with  its 
commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to 
investigate  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to the  project. 
To address the risks on governance and corruption related to procurement of civil works, relevant 
provisions  of  ADB’s  Anticorruption  Policy  will  be  included  in  the  loan  agreement  and  the  bidding 
documents  for  the  project.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in  connection  with  the 
project  will  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and 
accounts of AMG, XUARG, and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers 
as  they  relate  to  the  project.  XUARG  and  AMG  has  indicated  its  commitment  to  promote  good 
governance  and  establish  a  corruption-free  environment  under  the  project.  Further  to  this,  a 
number  of  good  governance  and  anticorruption  provisions  have  been  included  in  the  loan  and 
project agreements. 
XUARG and AMG will comply with ADB’s Anticorruption Policy. XUARG and AMG agree (i) 
3. 
that  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive 
practices  relating  to  the  project;  and  (ii)  to  cooperate  fully  with,  and  to  require  contractors  and 
suppliers  to  cooperate  fully  with,  any  such  investigation  and  to  extend  all  necessary  assistance, 
including  providing  access  to  all  relevant  books  and  records,  as  may  be  necessary  for  the 
satisfactory completion of any such investigation. 
4. 
XUARG and AMG will (i) conduct periodic inspections on the contractors’ activities related 
to  fund  withdrawals  and  settlements;  and  (ii)  ensure  that  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in 
connection with the project include relevant provisions of ADB’s Anticorruption Policy in all bidding 
documents  for  the  project  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and 
accounts  of  XPMO  and  APMO,  and  all  the  contractors,  suppliers,  consultants,  and  other  service 
providers as they relate to the project. 
5. 
XUARG  and  AMG  will  also  (i)  involve  the  agencies  responsible  for  oversight  of  each 
implementing  agency  in  bidding  and  construction  to  enhance  construction  quality  control  and 
supervise effective work; (ii) introduce a dual-signing system in which each works contract winner 
also signs an anticorruption agreement with the employer; (iii) periodically inspect the contractors’ 
activities  related  to  fund  withdrawals  and  settlements;  (iv)  require  the  loan  implementation 
consulting services to support APMO and four implementing agencies to ensure good governance, 
accountability,  and  transparency  in  project  operations;  and  (v)  in  consultation  with  relevant 
ministries  at  the  central  level,  update  rules  and  regulations  on  corporate  governance  and 
anticorruption to enhance the transparency of the operations of AMG and APMO.

XI. 
ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISM 
1. 
People who  are,  or may  in the future  be,  adversely  affected  by the  project  may  submit 
complaints  to  ADB’s  Accountability  Mechanism.  The  Accountability  Mechanism  provides  an 
independent  forum  and  process  whereby  people  adversely  affected  by  ADB-assisted  projects 
can voice, and seek a resolution of their problems, as well as report alleged violations of ADB’s 
operational  policies  and  procedures.  Before  submitting  a  complaint  to  the  Accountability 
Mechanism, affected people should make a good faith effort to solve their problems by working 
with  the  concerned  ADB  operations  department.  Only  after  doing  that,  and  if  they  are  still 
dissatisfied, they should approach the Accountability Mechanism.1

ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PLAN 
A. 
Objectives 
This  Environmental  Management  Plan  (EMP)  is  developed  for  the  Xinjiang  Akesu 
1. 
Integrated  Urban  Development  and  Environmental  Improvement  Project  (the  Project)  and 
defines  all  potential  impacts  of  the  Project  components  and  the  mitigation  and  protection 
measures  with  the  objective  of  avoiding  or  reducing  these  impacts  to  acceptable  levels.  The 
EMP also defines the institutional arrangements and mechanisms, the roles and responsibilities 
of different institutions, procedures and budgets for implementation of the EMP. The EMP seeks 
to  ensure  continuously  improving  environmental  protection  activities  during  preconstruction, 
construction, and operation in order to prevent, reduce, or mitigate adverse impacts and risks. 
The  EMP  draws  on  the  findings  of  the  project  IEE,  the  domestic  EIS  report,  PPTA  and  ADB 
review mission discussions and agreements with the relevant government agencies. 
2. 
Relevant  parts  of  the  EMP  will  be  incorporated  into  the  construction,  operation,  and 
management  of  each  sub-component.  Environmental  monitoring  will  be  carried  out  and  the 
results will be used to evaluate the extent and severity of actual environmental impacts against 
the  predicted  impacts  and  the  performance  of  the  environmental  protection  measures  or 
compliance with related rules and regulations.

contract  construction  supervision  companies  (CSCs),  environmental  supervision  companies 
(ESCs),  the  Akesu  Environmental  Monitoring  Station  (AEMS)  and  loan  implementation 
consultant  (LIC).  The  AEMS  will  conduct  environmental  impact  monitoring  during  construction 
and  operation  and  assess  project  compliance  with  the  PRC’s  environmental  standards  and 
regulations. With support from the LIC, the APMO will prepare and submit annual environment 
monitoring reports to ADB and XPMO annually for review, approval and disclosure. APMO will 
also establish the city-level Grievance Redress Mechanisms (GRM) with a dedicated Grievance 
Redress Officer (GRO). 
8. 
Environmental  Management  Group  (EMG).  The  environmental  management  unit 
(EMG)  within  the  APMO,  with  two  staff  members,  will  coordinate  and  supervise  the 
implementation of the EMP. More specifically, the EMG will take charge of (i) coordinating the 
implementation  of  the  EMP  and  developing  implementation  details,  including  reviewing  and 
approving  site-EMPs  developed  by  contractors;  (ii)  supervising  the  implementation  of  mitigation 
measures during construction; (iii) coordinating construction supervision companies (CSCs) and 
environmental  supervision  companies  (ESCs);  (iv)  incorporating  environmental  management, 
monitoring, and mitigation measures into the construction and operation management plans; (v) 
reporting  on  the  EMP  performance  to  the  APMO;  and  (vi)  responding  to  any  adverse  impact 
beyond those foreseen in the EIS report and the IEE. APMO will also be supported by the loan 
implementation  consultant  (LIC).  In  the  design  stage,  the  EMG  /  APMO  will  update  the  EMP, 
and pass it to design institutes to incorporate mitigation measures in the detailed designs. The 
EMP will then be passed on to construction contractors through the bidding process. To ensure 
that  the  contractors  comply  with the  EMP’s  provisions, the  APMO,  with the  help  and  technical 
support of the LIC, will prepare and provide the following specification clauses for incorporation 
into  the  bidding  procedures:  (i)  a  list  of  environmental  management  requirements  to  be 
budgeted by the bidders in their proposals; (ii) environmental clauses for contractual terms and 
conditions; and (iii) major items in domestic EIS report, the project IEE and the EMP.  
9. 
and 
Construction  Contractors,  Construction  Supervision  Companies 
Environmental  Supervision  Companies.  Construction  contractors,  CSCs  and  ESCs 
contracted by the APMO will be responsible for the daily inspection, monitoring, and evaluation 
of  mitigation  measures’  implementation.  Construction  contractors  will  be  responsible  for 
implementing  the  mitigation  measures  during  construction  under  supervision  of  the  EMG  / 
APMO. In their bids, contractors will be required to respond to the environmental management 
requirements defined in the EMP. Each contractor will be required to develop site-specific EMPs 
and  will  assign  a  person  responsible  for  environment,  health  and  safety  (Onsite  environment 
engineer,  OEE).  After  project  completion,  environmental  management  responsibilities  will  be 
handed over to OEs. During the operational phase, the APMO will supervise the environmental 
management  and  implementation  of  mitigation  measures  by  the  subproject  OEs.  The  cost  of 
mitigation measures in this phase will be borne by the relevant OEs, which have been identified 
for each project component. 
10. 
Loan  Implementation  Consultant  (LIC).  The  Loan  Implementation  Consultants  (LIC) 
will be contracted by the APMO to provide assistance during the pre-construction, construction 
and initial operational periods. The LIC should be recruited through advance contracting so that 
the  LIC  can  assist  in  the  important  pre-construction  activities  listed  in  the  EMP.  The  LIC  will 
advise  the  APMO  /  EMG  and  contractors  on  all  aspects  of  environmental  management  and 
monitoring  for  the  Project.  The  LIC  will  (i)  assist  the  APMO  to  design  the  PPMS  in  terms  of 
environmental  management,  and  assess  project  readiness  based  on  the  indicators  defined  in 
Table  A1.3;  (ii)  assist  APMO  to  establish  the  GRM,  including  training  to  GRM  access  points, 
and update the EMP and environmental monitoring program; (iii)  advise the EMG in reviewing 
A1-4 
Appendix 1 
the site-specific EMPs prepared by contractors; (iv) review internal and external environmental 
monitoring reports; (v) prepare the annual environmental monitoring report to ADB  and XPMO 
on behalf of APMO; (vi) provide training to APMO, EMG, contractors and OEs on environmental 
management implementation and monitoring and assist in the preparation of training materials; 
(viii) identify any environment- related implementation issues and necessary corrective actions 
and reflect these in a corrective action plan; and (x) undertake site visits as required. In addition, 
prior  to  mid-term  review  mission,  the  LIC  will  provide  support  to  APMO  in  organizing  public 
meetings in the project city/towns to present and discuss EMP implementation progress, solicit 
community  opinions  and  concerns,  and  agree  on  required  corrective  actions.  Prior  to  project 
completion  report,  the  LIC  will  organize  surveys  in  the  project  city/town  to  assess  community 
satisfaction with project implementation, project outputs, and EMP implementation performance, 
and document the results in the project completion report (PCR).  
C. 
Summary of Potential Impacts and Mitigation Measures 
11. 
Table  A1.2 summarizes the potential impacts and environment safeguard issues of the 
subcomponents  during  pre-construction,  construction  and  operation  as  identified  by  the 
environmental impact assessments and set out in this IEE, as well as corresponding mitigation 
measures  designated  to  minimize  those  impacts  and  address  these  issues.  These  have  been 
integrated into a consolidated EMP and environmental monitoring plan in this chapter covering 
all subproject sectors and settings. 
12. 
The  following  mitigation  measures  will  be  incorporated  into  tender  documents, 
construction  contracts,  and  site-specific  EMPs  (to  be  prepared  by  contractors).  The 
effectiveness  of  these  measures  will  be  carefully  watched  via  environmental  monitoring  and 
supervision to determine whether to continue them or to make improvements.

Environmental Monitoring and Inspection 
14. 
An  environmental  monitoring  program  is  presented  in  Table  A1.4.  This  program 
considers  the  scope  of  monitoring,  environmental  media,  monitoring  parameters,  time  and 
frequency, implementing and supervising agencies. The monitoring will follow the methodology 
provided in the national standard methods for monitoring pollutants. Other associated standards 
are  national  environmental  quality  standards  and  pollutant  discharge/emission  standards. 
Environmental  safeguard  monitoring  will  be  coordinated  by 
the 
environmental management group (EMG).  
the  APMO 
through 
15. 
Internal monitoring. Internal inspections will be undertaken on a daily basis to oversee 
the implementation of the EMP and monitor the actual environmental impacts that will occur. It 
A1-21 
Appendix 1 
will  be  conducted  by the  OEE,  the  CSC  and  ESC,  and  EMG. The  internal  monitoring  will  also 
cover  non-quantitative  parameters  such  as  solid  waste  management  and  soil  erosion  control, 
and it will be carried out through visual inspections. Results will be reported through the CSCs’ 
monthly reports to the APMO.  
16. 
External  (physical)  monitoring.  The  APMO  will  contract  the  Akesu  environmental 
monitoring  station  (AEMS)  to  undertake  the  external  environmental  monitoring  program, 
including  field  sampling,  lab  analysis  and  reporting,  in  compliance  with  the  monitoring  plan 
defined in the EMP (Table A1.4). External environmental monitoring reports will be prepared on 
a quarterly basis by the AEMS and will be used by the LIC to prepare the annual environment 
monitoring reports (EMRs) which will be submitted to the AMG, XPMO and ADB. 
PRC Laws and Regulations Compliance Monitoring and Inspection. The AEPB will 
17. 
be  responsible  to  commissioning  regular  and  random  compliance  monitoring  and  inspection 
before,  during,  and after  construction,  as well  as in the event  of  emergencies. If  abnormalities 
are found, the AEPB will impose a fine and issue a notice of rectification with a specific deadline, 
in accordance with PRC laws and regulations. 
18. 
EMP  compliance  monitoring.  The  EMG,  with  the  support  of  the  LIC,  will  conduct 
regular  site  visits,  monitor  and  assess  overall  project  activities  under  the  project  design  and 
monitoring framework,  including  environmental  targets,  review  and  clear  site-EMPs  developed 
by  contractors,  review  the  contractors’  performance  and  compliance  with  the  site  EMPs, 
supervise  the  work  of  the  EMS,  and    report  to  ADB  and  XPMO  the  progress  of  the  EMP, 
information  on  project  implementation,  environmental  performance  of  the  contactors,  and 
environmental  compliance  through  the  semi-annual  project  progress  reports  and  annual 
environmental monitoring reports. The progress reports on the EMP will pay particular attention 
to  consultation  and  participation,  and  to  public  and  worker  safety  and  health.  The  annual 
environment monitoring report will follow the structure defined in the EMP. 
19. 
Environmental  Acceptance  Monitoring  and  Audit.  Moreover,  within  3  months  after 
each  subcomponent  completion,  or  no  later  than  1  year  with  permission  from  the  responsible 
environmental  authorities,  environmental  acceptance  monitoring  and  audit  reports  will  be  (i) 
prepared by a qualified environmental institute in accordance with the MEP Guideline on Project 
Completion Environmental Audit (2001); (ii) reviewed for approval by environmental authorities 
who  has  given  the  approval  to  the  domestic  EIS  (i.e.,  XEPD),  and  (iii)  finally  submitted  to the 
ADB. 
Environmental  Monitoring  during  Project  Operations.  During  operation, 
20. 
the 
operating entities (OEs) will conduct regular monitoring in accordance with their O&M plans, to 
be  developed  in  assistance  with  the  LIC.  Ambient  environmental  monitoring  in  relation  to  the 
subcomponents will be incorporated into the regular ambient environmental monitoring program 
of AEPB and its AEMS. The monitoring will cover water quality, air quality and acoustic quality. 
Air quality and noise monitoring will cover the residential areas along the road alignments, with 
special attention to the sensitive spots. Water quality monitoring will include the wetlands, rivers 
and  canals.  Biodiversity  monitoring  in  the  Akesu-Duolang  wetlands,  as  established  during 
project  implementation,  will  continue  during  project  operation  under  the  lead  of  the  Duolang 
Wetland Management Station, Akesu Forestry Bureau.  
Environmental  monitoring,  including  the  environmental  benefits  monitoring,  will  be 
21. 
incorporated  into  the  Project  Performance  management  System  (PPMS).  The  APMO  with 
assistance  from  the  LIC  will  be  responsible  for  analyzing  and  consolidating  the  data  through 
A1-22 
Appendix 1 
their management information system. The PPMS will be designed to allow adequate flexibility 
to  adopt  remedial  actions  regarding  project  design,  schedules,  activities,  and  development 
impacts. At the beginning of the project, the APMO and LIC will develop comprehensive PPMS 
procedures  to  systematically  generate  data  on  inputs  and  outputs  of  the  project  components 
and  agree  on  environmental  and  related  social  economic  indicators  to  be  used  to  measure 
project  impacts.  The  APMO,  with  assistance  from  the  LIC,  will  refine  the  PPMS  framework, 
confirm  achievable  goals,  firm  up  monitoring  and  recording  arrangements,  and  establish 
systems and procedures no later than 6 months after loan effectiveness.

EMP Implementation Costs 
25. 
The  cost  for  environmental  management  and  impact  mitigation  measures  are  listed 
against  line  items  in  the  EMP  matrix  (Table  A1.2).  Environmental  monitoring  costs  are  also 
included  in  the  monitoring  plan  (Table  A1.5).  These  are  to  be  included  in  the  construction 
contracts  and  counterpart  budgets.  APMO  will  pay  for  external  monitoring  carried  out  by  the 
Akesu environment monitoring station AEMS). During implementation, the cost required can be 
adjusted based on actual requirements. If there are unpredictable environmental impacts found 
during the implementation of the environmental monitoring, the Project IEE and EMP should be 
updated in a timely manner and mitigation measures will be put forward to reduce the impacts to 
acceptable levels. 
Internal monitoring costs will be borne by the contractors during construction and by the 
26. 
OEs during operation. Before implementing a monitoring plan, the APMO and EMG, supported 
by  the  LIC,  will  present  a  more  detailed  breakdown  of  the  estimated  budget.  During  sub-
component implementation, the budgets will be adjusted based on actual requirements. 
27. 
Contractors will bear the costs for all mitigation measures during construction, which will 
be  included  in  the  tender  and  contract  documents.  The  OEs  will  bear  the  costs  related  to 
mitigation measures during operation. The Project as a whole will bear the costs for training and 
the Loan Implementation Consultant (LIC). 
G. 
Consultation, Participation and Information Disclosure 
28. 
Consultation  during  Project  Preparation.  Meaningful  consultation  was  conducted 
during project preparation. The consultation process and its outcome are described in Chapter 
VI  of  this  IEE.  Direct  public  participation  was  conducted  as  an  ongoing  element  in  the 
development  of  the  sub-components.  These  activities  were  carried  out  by  the  LDIs  in  the 
preparation  of  the  FSR  and  EIS  and  by  the  Technical  Assistance  (TA)  Consultants  following 
PRC  National  Environmental Impact  Assessments  Technical Guidelines and ADB’s  Safeguard 
Policy Statement (2009). 
29. 
Future  Consultation  Plan. Future plans for public involvement during detailed design, 
construction and operation phases were developed during project preparation.  Affected people 
will be consulted and informed through site visits and informal interviews by the APMO (through 
the EMG), with support of the LIC. Public meetings will be organized by the APMO prior to mid-
term mission to present and discuss EMP implementation progress, solicit community opinions 
and concerns, and agree on required corrective actions. The LIC will, prior to project completion 
report,  organize  surveys  in  the  project  affected  areas  to  assess  community  satisfaction  with 
project implementation, project outputs, and EMP implementation performance. The results will 
be documented in the project completion report (PCR).  
30. 
Information  Disclosure.  The  project’s  environmental  information  will  be  disclosed  as 
follows:  (i)  the  project IEE  is  disclosed at  www.adb.org; (ii)  the  Chinese EIS  was disclosed on 
the website of the XUAR Environment Protection Department; and (iii) the annual environment 
monitoring reports will be disclosed at www.adb.org and on the website of the AMG.

Institutional Strengthening and Training 
31.  Main  institutional  strengthening  measures for environmental  management  include (i) 
the  establishment  of  the  Environment  Management  Group  (EMG)  within  the  APMO;  (ii)  the 
contracting  of  a  loan  implementation  consultant  (LIC),  including  one  international  and  one 
national  environment  specialist  as  well  as  experts  in  wetland  management,  biodiversity 
monitoring,  traffic  safety,  etc,  to  support  EMP  implementation  and  provide  training;  (iii)  the 
contracting  of  the  Akesu  environment  monitoring  station  (AEMS)  for 
the  conduct  of 
environmental  impact  monitoring;  and  (iv)  the  procurement  of  construction  supervision 
companies (CSCs). In addition, the following institutional strengthening measures are included: 
32. 
Capacity  building.  To  ensure  effective  implementation  of  the  EMP  and  project 
sustainability, a capacity building component was included in the project. The main purpose of 
the capacity building component is to enhance the capacity of the AMG, APMO and the OEs to 
implement  and  operate  the  project  facilities.  The  scope  will  focus  on  the  following  areas:  (1) 
living  streets  (pilot);  (2)  planning  of  slow-traffic  system,  solid  waste  management,  wetland

33. 
Training.  The  LIC and other  consultants  hired for  the  Project  will  offer EMP  and other 
trainings  that  is  specific  to  their  roles  for  the  project.  Major  training  emphases  will  be  (i)  to 
ensure  that  contractors  are  well  versed  in  environmentally  sound  practices  and  are  able  to 
undertake all construction with the appropriate environmental safeguards; and (ii) to ensure that 
all  staff  at  all  levels  are  trained  in  appropriate  work  practices  for  wetland  management.  The 
provisional training plan is provided in Table A1.7. During the inception phase of the consulting 
service the LIC will conduct a training needs assessment (TNA) and update and refine the plan 
as  needed.  The  training  plan  will  be  revised  on  an  annual  basis  and  disclosed  through  the 
annual environment monitoring report. Funding of this training is included in the Project budget. 
The  estimated  incremental  costs  for  the  institutional  strengthening  and  training  are  shown  in

Mechanisms for Feedback and Adjustment 
37. 
The EMP is a live document. The need to update and adjust the EMP will be reviewed 
when  there  are  design  changes,  changes  in  construction  methods  and  program,  unfavorable 
environmental  monitoring  results  or  inappropriate  monitoring  locations,  and  ineffective  or 
inadequate mitigation measures. Based on environmental monitoring and reporting systems in 
place, the APMO (under the supervision of XPMO and with the support of the LIC) shall assess 
whether  further  mitigation  measures  are  required  as  corrective  action,  or  improvement  in 
environmental management practices are required. APMO will inform ADB and XPMO promptly 
on any changes to the project and needed adjustments to the EMP. The updated EMP will be 
submitted  to  ADB  for  review  and  approval,  and  will  be  disclosed  on  the  project  website.  The 
feedback and adjustment mechanism is presented in Figure A1.1.
