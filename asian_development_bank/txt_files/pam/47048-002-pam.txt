PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
A. 
Rationale 
Located in the upper Qing River basin (a major tributary of the Yangtze River), the Enshi 
1. 
Tujia  and  Miao  Autonomous  Prefecture  (ETMAP)  has  an  ethnically  diverse  population  of  4.01 
million. Because of its mountainous terrain and lack of connectivity, ETMAP’s per capita income 
in 2012 was only CNY10,327, which was about half of the provincial level; the poverty incidence 
is 40% in rural areas. The ETMAP includes two cities at district level—Enshi and Lichuan—and 
six  counties,  which  are  all  designated  as  national  poverty  areas.  In  addition  to  poverty,  water 
quality deterioration, riverbank erosion, and recurrent flooding are key factors undermining living 
standards and sustainable economic development in the ETMAP. 
2. 
The Qing River is the primary water supply for Enshi and Lichuan and their surrounding 
rural  populations.  Since  the  1990s,  the  water  quality  of  the  Qing  River  and  its  tributaries  has 
deteriorated. Monitoring data show that water quality in 45% of all cross sections is class IV, V, 
or  below, meaning  it  is unfit for  human  consumption.1 Water  pollution  is most  serious  in  Enshi 
and Lichuan, resulting in odor and eutrophication. Continuing deterioration of the water quality 
poses  a  public  health  threat  for  local  residents,  who  rely  on  the  river  for  their  water  use.  In 
addition, 
threatens  Qing  River  riparian  and  aquatic 
ecosystems, and limits opportunities for ecological diversity and tourism-related recreation.   
the  degraded  water  environment 
3. 
The  major  sources  of  pollution  are  untreated  domestic  wastewater,  unregulated  runoff, 
and  inadequately  treated  industrial  effluent.  As  a  result  of  prolonged  underinvestment, 
wastewater collection and treatment facilities in Enshi and Lichuan are seriously deficient. Less 
than 60% of wastewater from Enshi and Lichuan is collected and treated because of the lack of 
treatment capacity, aging pipelines, and incomplete coverage of wastewater collection systems. 
This  problem  will  become  increasingly  serious  with  economic  development  and  rapid 
urbanization,  as  projected  in  the  master  plans  for  Enshi  and  Lichuan.  Further,  there  are  no 
facilities  for  collection  and  treatment  of  domestic  wastewater  and  solid  waste  in  rural  areas 
along the Qing River and its tributaries. 
Upstream  of  Enshi  and  Lichuan,  the  Qing  River  watershed  is  mountainous  with  high 
4. 
seasonal rainfall and rapid runoff. This, combined with inadequate flood management facilities, 
results in regular flooding. Following national flood management standards, flood management 
facilities in Enshi and Lichuan should provide protection against 20-year floods in the short term 
and  50-year  floods  in  the  long  term.  The  existing  facilities  only  provide  protection  against  a 
maximum of 4-year floods. There are some revetments along the banks within Enshi and a mid-
sized  multipurpose  reservoir  on  the  upper  Qing  River.  However,  there  are  virtually  no 
revetments  or  other  flood  control  measures  along  the  Qing  River  and  its  tributaries  flowing 
through  Lichuan.  Since  the  1950s,  at  least  nine  major  floods  have  occurred,  resulting  in 
significant loss of lives and property. There has also been severe riverbank erosion as a result 
of high-intensity rainfall, loss of vegetation, and lack of revetment works. This has caused heavy 
siltation of the river and blockage in urban sections of the Qing River and its tributaries, which 
further exacerbates flood risk and water pollution. 
1  Class  IV  is  suitable  for  general  industrial  water  supply  and  recreational  use  involving  no  direct  human  contact. 
Class V is suitable for agricultural water supply and general landscaping use. Below class V is unsuitable for any 
use (PRC Environmental Water Quality Standard GB3838-2002).

Lack  of  integrated  water  resource  management  in  the  Qing  River  basin  hinders  a 
5. 
coordinated  and  effective  response  by  planning,  pollution  control,  and  flood  management 
authorities  to  improve  water  quality  and  reduce  flooding.  Weak  interagency  coordination  and 
lack  of  monitoring  and  enforcement  capacity  have  resulted  in  ineffective  management  of 
nonpoint  source  pollution  from  rural  and  urban  sources.  Important  rural  sources  include 
discharges  of  domestic  waste  from  unsewered  rural  households,  agricultural  runoff,  animal 
waste  discharges,  and  erosion  of  riverbanks  during  high-flow  conditions.  In  urban  areas, 
unregulated runoff along the riverbanks also contributes to nonpoint pollution, including garbage 
dumped along the riverbanks and inflow of wastewater due to leaks, clogging, and misalignment 
of wastewater pipes. While the river embankment is a critical flood management facility, proper 
maintenance of the banks would also help reduce nonpoint pollution. 
Guided  by  both  the  national  western  region  development  strategy  and  the  Hubei 
6. 
provincial 12th Five-Year Plan (2011–2015), the Enshi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture 
Government  (ETMAPG)  is  committed  to  reducing  poverty,  improving  the  water  quality  of  Qing 
River, and advancing the ecological rehabilitation of the river and lakes. The ETMAP is covered 
under  the  Water  Pollution  Control  Plan  for  the  Three  Gorges  Reservoir  Area  and  the  Upper 
Reaches,  which  is  one  of  the  national  priorities  for  water  pollution  control.  The  provincial 
government  has  formulated  and  approved  the  Qing  River  Basin  Pollution  Prevention  and 
Control  Master  Plan  (2010–2020)  and  the  ETMAPG  has  prepared  the  Qing  River  Near-Term 
Flood Control Master Plan (2013–2015),2 which was approved in 2012 by the Ministry of Water 
Resources. To implement and complement components of these plans, the ETMAPG requested 
that the Asian Development Bank (ADB) provide financial and technical support for water quality 
improvement and flood management in Enshi and Lichuan. 
7. 
With  support  from  the  central  and  provincial  governments,  the  ETMAPG  has  taken the 
following steps to implement the master plans: (i) incorporate water quality improvement goals 
in performance evaluation of local governments; and (ii) implement more than 30 projects with a 
total  investment  of  CNY8  billion  for  sewage  network  improvement,  solid-waste  management, 
nonpoint source pollution reduction, river rehabilitation, and soil erosion control in 2014.

The project is consistent with the priorities of ADB’s country partnership strategy, 2011–
2015 for the PRC;3 the comprehensive reform agenda announced at the Third Plenary Session 
of  the  18th  Communist  Party  of  China  Central  Committee;4 the  strategic  priorities  of  ADB’s 
Midterm  Review  of  Strategy  2020, 5 and  the  Water  Operational  Plan. 6  Environmental 
sustainability  is  one  of  the  three  strategic  pillars  of  the  country  partnership  strategy.  The 
comprehensive reform agenda announced at the third plenum emphasized the need for better

a Includes taxes and duties to be financed from government and the ADB loan. The following principles were followed 
in  determining  the  amount  of  taxes  and  duties  to  be  financed  by  ADB:  (i)  the  amount  is  within  reasonable  country 
thresholds; (ii) the amount represents 3.5% of base cost, not an excessive share of the project investment plan; (iii) 
taxes and duties only to ADB-financed expenditures; and (iv) the financing of the taxes and duties is relevant to the 
success of the project.  
b In November 2019 prices.  
c Physical contingencies computed at 8.0% for all expenditure categories. Price contingencies are calculated at 4% in 
2016–2021 and thereafter.  
c Includes interest during construction and commitment charges. Interest for the ADB loan has been computed at the 
3-year US Dollar fixed swap rate plus an ADB spread of 0.5% and a maturity premium of 0.1%. Commitment charges 
for the ADB loan are 0.15% per year to be charged on the undisbursed loan amount.  
Note: Numbers may not sum precisely because of rounding.

20. 
The  government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $100  million  from  ADB’s  ordinary  capital 
resources  to  help  finance  the  project.  The  loan  will  have  a  25-year  term,  including  a  grace 
period  of  5  years;  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  London 
interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year; 
and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  loan  and  project  agreements.  The 
government has requested that the repayment will follow the straight line repayment option and 
that the repayment dates are expected to be 1 March and 1 September in each year. Based on 
the  requested  loan  terms  and  the  repayment  option,  the  average  loan  maturity  is  15.25  years 
and  the  maturity  premium  payable  to  ADB  is  0.1%.  The  ADB  loan  will  also  finance  taxes  and 
duties for eligible ADB-financed expenditures, and transportation and insurance costs included 
in the base cost for ensuring smooth project implementation. The loan will finance 45.70% of the 
project cost, including civil works, equipment and materials, and institutional strengthening. The 
Enshi  city  government  (ECG)  will  finance  36.42%  of  the  project  cost  and  the  LCG  17.88% 
17 
through  counterpart  funds  (Table  2).  Counterpart  funds  will  finance  some  civil  works,  land 
acquisition  and  resettlement,  survey,  design,  and  supervision  and  monitoring.    The  loan 
commitment or ADB's share of contract award is about $53 million, while about $33.59 million 
has  been  disbursed  by  ADB  to  the  designated  account  under  Hubei  Provincial  Finance 
Department as of the end of 2019.

The  government  has  requested  a  repayment  schedule  based  on  a  straight  line  loan 
format and that the repayment dates will extend from 2020 to 2040. Based on the above loan 
terms and these repayment option and dates, the average loan maturity is 15.25 years and the 
maturity premium payable to ADB is 0.1% per annum.  
The government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under 
22. 
ADB’s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility  on  the  basis  of  these  terms  and  conditions,  and  (ii)  an 
undertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not made in reliance on 
any communication or advice from ADB.

V. 
FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT 
A.  Financial Management Assessment 
23. 
The  financial  management  assessment  (FMA)  was  carried  out  in  2014  in  accordance 
with  ADB’s  Guidelines  for  the  Financial  Management  and  Analysis  of  Projects.  Below  is  a 
summary of the financial analysis.  
24. 
The  Enshi  Tujia  and  Miao  Autonomous  Prefecture  Government  (ETMAPG),  the 
executing agency, has extensive experience in the preparation and implementation of projects 
funded  by  the  World  Bank  and  foreign  governments.  A  new  prefecture  project  management 
office  (PMO)  has  been  established  within  the  Enshi  Prefecture  Development  and  Reform 
Commission.  It  is  responsible,  on  behalf  of  the  ETMAPG,  for  daily  coordination  and 
management  of  project  preparation  and  implementation.  The  Enshi  Prefecture  Finance 
Department  (EPFD)  will  be  responsible,  on  behalf  of  the  ETMAPG,  for  the  financial 
management  of  the  project.  The  Enshi  Urban  Construction  and  Investment  Co.  Ltd.  (EUCIC) 
and  the  Lichuan  Liangli  Urban  Construction  and  Development  Co.  Ltd.  (LLUCDC)  are  the 
implementing agencies of the project responsible for the implementation of the subcomponents 
in Enshi and Lichuan cities respectively. They are stated-owned companies. 
The FMA assessed the financial management capacity of EPFD, EUCIC, and LLUCDC. 
25. 
The  assessment  included  review  of  fund-flow  arrangements,  staffing,  accounting  policies  and 
procedures, internal and external auditing arrangements, reporting and monitoring, and financial 
information systems. 
26. 
EPFD  has  adequate  financial  staff,  accounting  policies  and  procedures,  internal  and 
external  controls,  audit arrangements,  and  reporting  system.  It has  experience  on World  Bank 
and foreign government projects, but no experience on ADB projects yet.   
27. 
LLUCDC  and  EUCIC  have  sound  financial  management  systems  which  can  meet  the 
minimum  financial  management  requirements  for  their  current  activities  though  they  have  no 
experience  yet  on  the  financial  management  of  foreign-funded  projects.  External  financial 
management  assistance  is  proposed  to  help  EUCIC  implement  needed  improvements  in  its 
budget management system.  
28. 
The  executing  and  implementing  agencies  have  agreed  to  strengthen  their  financial 
management capability to manage the project, including (i) undertaking training, particularly on 
ADB  policy  and  procedural  requirements  including  procurement,  disbursement,  and  project 
management; and (ii) seeking external financial management assistance as needed.    
29. 
The overall financial management risk-rating of the project, before considering mitigating 
measures,  is  moderate.  The  identified  financial  management  risks  will  be  closely  monitored 
during project implementation.  
B.  Disbursement 
30. 
The  Loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  Loan  Disbursement 
Handbook  (2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time),11 and  detailed  arrangements  agreed  upon 
between the Government and ADB. 
11  
Available at: http://www.adb.org/documents/loan-disbursement-handbook. 
26 
The  implementing  agencies  will  be  responsible  for  all  disbursement  arrangements  for 
31. 
expenditures  related  to  the  implementation  of  subcomponents  in  Enshi  and  Lichuan  cities, 
including  (i)  preparing  disbursement  projections,  (ii)  requesting  budgetary  allocations  for 
counterpart  funds,  (iii)  collecting  supporting  documents,  and  (iv)  preparing  withdrawal 
applications that will be submitted to ADB by HPG. 
32. 
Direct  payment  procedure  will  generally  be  used  for  large  civil  works,  equipment 
contracts,  and  consulting  services  contracts.  Reimbursement  procedures  will  also  be  used  as 
appropriate  when  the  government  initially  funds  ADB  eligible  expenditures  from  its  budget 
allocation or its own resources. The statement of expenditure (SOE) procedure will be used. 
33. 
Each  year,  ETMAPG  will  ensure  ECG  and  LCG  allocate  the  necessary  amount  of 
counterpart  funding  and  disburse  it  upon  request  from  the  implementing  agencies.  For  ADB’s 
loan proceeds, withdrawal applications to ADB will be prepared by the PMO with assistance of 
the  implementing  agencies.  At  the  end  of  each  year,  realistic  projections  of  contract 
awards/commitments  and  disbursement  for  the  following  calendar  year  will  be  made  for  an 
assessment  and  projection  of  ADB  funds  required  to  cover  contract  awards/commitments  and 
disbursements  for  ongoing  loans.  The  PMO  will  be  responsible  for  preparing  contract 
award/commitment and disbursement projections each year. 
An  imprest  account  will  be  set  up  for  the  project  by  the  Hubei  Provincial  Finance 
34. 
Department (HPFD) in a commercial bank acceptable to ADB after the loan becomes effective. 
HPFD  will  be  responsible  for  the  management,  monitoring,  and  reconciliation  of  the  imprest 
account. For every liquidation and replenishment request of the imprest account, the borrower 
will furnish to ADB (i) the statement of account (bank statement) where the imprest account is 
maintained;  and  (ii)  the  imprest  account  reconciliation  statement  reconciling  the  above 
mentioned bank statement against the executing agency’s records. Follow the format provided 
in Appendix 10C of ADB’s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2015, as amended from time to time). 
The  bank  charges  in  the  operation  of  the  imprest  account  may  be  financed  from  the  loan 
proceeds. The total outstanding advance to the imprest account should not exceed the estimate 
of  ADB’s  share  of  expenditures  to  be  paid  through  the  imprest  account  for  the  forthcoming  6 
months.  The  executing  agency  may  request  for  initial  and  additional  advances  to  the  imprest 
account  based  on  an  estimate  of  expenditure  sheet  available  in  Appendix  10B  of  the  ADB’s 
Loan Disbursement Handbook (2015, as amended from time to time), setting out the estimated 
expenditures to be financed through the account for the forthcoming 6 months, and submission 
of  evidence  satisfactory  to  ADB  that  the  imprest  account  has  been  duly  opened.  Supporting 
documents  should  be  submitted  to  ADB  or  retained  by  the  executing  and  implementing 
agencies  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2015,  as  amended  from 
time to time) when liquidating or replenishing the imprest account. 
To  expedite  funds  flow  and  simplify  the  documentation  process,  the  SOE12 procedure 
35. 
will  be  used  for  liquidation  and  replenishment  of  the  imprest  account  and  reimbursement  of 
eligible  expenditures  not  exceeding  $200,000  per  individual  payment.  Payments  in  excess  of 
the  SOE  ceiling  will  be  reimbursed,  liquidated,  or  replenished  based  on  full  supporting 
documentation  process.  SOE  records  should  be  maintained  and  made  readily  available  for 
review  by  ADB's  disbursement  and  review  missions  or  upon  ADB's  request  for  submission  of 
supporting documents on a sampling basis, and for independent audit.

36. 
Before  the  submission  of  the  first  withdrawal  application,  HPG,  through  the  HPFD  and 
prefectural PMO, should submit to ADB sufficient evidence of the authority of the person(s) who 
will sign the withdrawal applications on behalf of HPG, together with the authenticated specimen 
signatures  of  each  authorized  person.  The  minimum  value  per  withdrawal  application  is 
$100,000 equivalent. The PMO will consolidate claims to meet this limit for reimbursement and 
imprest  account  claims.  Individual  payments  below  this  amount  should  be  paid  (i)  by  the 
executing  agency  or  implementing  agencies  and  subsequently  claimed  to  ADB  through 
reimbursement;  or  (ii)  from  the  imprest  account,  and  subsequently  claimed  to  ADB  through 
reimbursement or liquidation/replenishment, unless otherwise accepted by ADB. ADB reserves 
the right not to accept withdrawal applications below the minimum amount.  
For  the  counterpart  funds,  the  implementing  agencies  will  allocate  the  designated 
37. 
funding for the project as specified in the loan and project agreements. Counterpart funds from 
the  government  will  be  disbursed  and  liquidated  by  the  implementing  agencies  to  contractors 
and  service  providers.  The  disbursement  process  will  follow  this  process:  (i)  according  to  the 
progress  of  the  contract,  the  implementing  agencies  will  submit  disbursement  request  to  the 
respective PMO; and (ii) once approved, counterpart funds will be disbursed from the respective 
municipal finance bureau. 
C.  Accounting  
38. 
The  ETMAPG  and  the  implementing  agencies  will  maintain,  or  cause  to  maintain, 
separate  books  and  records  by  funding  source  for  all  expenditures  incurred  on  the  project. 
Consolidated  project  financial  statements  will  be  prepared  annually  by  ETMAPG  through  the 
prefectural  PMO  in  accordance  with  the  government’s  accounting  laws  and  regulations,  which 
are consistent with international accounting principles and practices.13 
D.  Auditing and Public Disclosure  
39. 
The  ETMAPG  and  the  implementing  agencies  will  cause  the  detailed  consolidated 
project  financial  statements  to  be  audited  in  accordance  with  International  Standards  on 
Auditing and the Government Auditing Standards of the PRC (where these are consistent with 
International  Standards  on  Auditing),  by  an  auditor  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  audited 
consolidated  project  financial  statements  will  be  submitted  in  the  English  language  to  ADB 
within six months of the end of the fiscal year by the prefectural PMO. 
The  annual  audit  report  for  the  project  will  include  an  audit  management  letter14 and 
40. 
auditor’s opinions which cover (i) whether the project financial statements present a true and fair 
view or are presented fairly, in all material respects, in accordance with the applicable financial 
reporting framework; (ii) whether loan proceeds were used only for the purposes of the project 
or not; (iii) the level of compliance for each financial covenant contained in the loan and project 
agreements  for  the  project;  (iv)  use  of  the  imprest  fund  procedure;  and  (v)  use  of  the  SOE 
procedure  certifying to  the  eligibility  of  those  expenditures  claimed  under  SOE  procedure,  and 
13  Applicable  laws,  regulations  and  guidelines  include:  (i)  the  Accounting  Law  of  the  PRC  (2000);  (ii)  State-owned 
Construction  Enterprise  Accounting  Control  Regulations;  (iii)  Capital  Construction  Financial  Control  Regulations; 
and (iv) Accounting Methods of Projects Financed by the World Bank. 
14  A  management  letter  means  formal  communications  from  the  auditor  the  client  management  in  accordance  with 
the  International  Standard  on  Auditing  265  (communicating  deficiencies  in  internal  control  to  those  charged  with 
governance  and  management),  which  is  not  required  to  be  provided  separately  as  it  is  equivalent  to  the  Audit 
Findings and Recommendations prepared by the Project auditor and submitted to ADB. 
28 
proper  use  of  the  SOE and  imprest  procedures in  accordance  with  ADB’s  Loan  Disbursement 
Handbook (2015, as amended from time to time) and other project documents. 
41. 
Compliance  with  financial  reporting  and  auditing  requirements  will  be  monitored  by 
review  missions  and  during  normal  program  supervision,  and  followed  up  regularly  with  all 
concerned, including the external auditor. 
42. 
The borrower, HPG, and ETMAPG have been made aware of ADB’s policy on delayed 
submission, and the requirements for satisfactory and acceptable quality of the audited project 
financial  statements.15 ADB  reserves  the  right  to  require  a  change  in  the  auditor  (in  a  manner 
consistent with the constitution of the borrower), or for additional support to be provided to the 
auditor, if the audits required are not conducted in a manner satisfactory to ADB, or if the audits 
are  substantially  delayed.  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  verify  the  project's  financial  accounts  to 
confirm  that  the  share  of  ADB’s  financing  is  used  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  policies  and 
procedures. 
Public  disclosure  of  the  project  financial  statements,  including  the  audit  report  on  the 
43. 
project  financial  statements,  will  be  guided  by  ADB’s  Public  Communications  Policy  (2011).16 
After  review,  ADB  will  disclose  the  financial  statements  for  the  project  and  the  opinion  of  the 
auditors on the financial statements within 30 days of the date of their receipt by posting them 
on ADB’s website. The Audit Management Letter will not be disclosed. 
15  ADB policy on delayed submission of audited project financial statements: 
- 
When  audited  project  financial  statements  are  not  received  by  the  due  date,  ADB  will  write  to  the  executing 
agency  advising  that  (i)  the  audit documents  are  overdue; and  (ii) if  they  are  not  received  within  the next  six 
months, requests for new contract awards and disbursement such as new replenishment of imprest accounts, 
processing of new reimbursement, and issuance of new commitment letters will not be processed. 
When audited project financial statements have not been received within six months after the due date, ADB 
will withhold processing of requests for new contract awards and disbursement such as new replenishment of 
imprest  accounts,  processing  of  new  reimbursement  and  issuance  of  new  commitment  letters.  ADB  will  (i) 
inform  the  executing  agency  of  ADB’s  actions;  and  (ii)  advise  that  the  loan  may  be  suspended  if  the  audit 
documents are not received within the next six months. 
When audited project financial statements have not been received within 12 months after the due date, ADB 
may suspend the loan.

VI. 
PROCUREMENT AND CONSULTING SERVICES 
A.  Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing 
44. 
The  ETMAPG  has  requested  advance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  to  enable 
early  commencement  of  procurement  of  civil  works,  goods,  and  services.  The  details  of 
activities to be financed and their justifications will be set out in a written request to ADB. The 
ETMAP has been advised that retroactive financing may only apply to up to 20% of the amount 
of  the  ADB  loan  in  respect  for  expenditures  incurred  before  loan  effectiveness,  but  not  earlier 
than  12  months  before  the  signing  of  the  loan  and  project  agreements.  Approval  of  advance 
contracting and retroactive financing does not commit ADB to financing the project. All advance 
contracting  and  retroactive  financing  will  be  undertaken  in  conformity  with  ADB’s  Procurement 
Guidelines 17  (2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  ADB’s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of 
Consultants18 (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  issuance  of  invitations  to  bid  under 
advance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  will  be  subject  to  ADB  approval  and  advance 
contracting  should  follow  ADB’s  review  and  approval  procedures  relating  to  procurement  and 
consulting services. 
B.  Procurement of Goods, Works and Consulting Services 
45. 
All  procurement  of  goods  and  works  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB’s 
Procurement  Guidelines  (2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  International  competitive 
bidding  (ICB)  will  be  used  for  civil  works  contracts  estimated  to  cost  $20  million  and  above. 
National competitive bidding (NCB) will be used for civil works contracts estimated to cost over 
$200,000  equivalent  up  to  $20  million.  For  goods  and  equipment,  ICB  will  be  used  for  values 
exceeding $5 million, while NCB will be used for goods and equipment from over $100,000 to 
below  $5  million  equivalent.  For  NCB,  the  first  draft  English  language  of  the  procurement 
documents  (prequalification,  bidding  documents,  and  draft  contract)  should  be  submitted  for 
ADB  approval  regardless  of  the  estimated  contract  amount.  Subsequent  procurements  are 
subject to post review. All ICB contracts are subject to prior review. Prior review and approval of 
ADB of the procurement documents (prequalification, bidding, contract) is required. 
A  procurement  plan  indicating  goods,  works,  and  consulting  service  contract  packages 
46. 
and expected contract preparation and implementation timeline is in subsection C. 
All consultants financed by ADB will be recruited according to ADB’s Guidelines on the 
47. 
Use  of  Consultants  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).19 An  estimated  187  person-months 
(27  person-months  international,  160  person-months  national)  of  consulting  services  are 
required  to:  (i)  facilitate  project  implementation  and  institutional  strengthening  support  (quality 
and  cost-based  selection),  (ii)  conduct  resettlement  and  social  monitoring  (consultant’s 
qualifications  selection),  (iii)  advise  on  initial  project  implementation  support  including  project 
management  and  procurement  (individual  consultant  selection),  and  (iv)  provide  guidance  on 
strengthening non-structural measures for Qing River integrated management (quality and cost-

SAFEGUARDS 
A.  Environment 
53. 
Environment due diligence. The project is classified as category A for environment. An 
environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  and  environmental  management  plan  (EMP)  were 
prepared  and  disclosed  on  the  ADB  website  on  26  November  2014. The  EIA  incorporates  the 
results  of  the  domestic  environmental  impact  assessment  (DEIA)  approved  by  the  Hubei 
Provincial  Department  of  Environmental  Protection  in  November  2014. The  EIA  complies  with 
ADB’s policies and requirements including ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). The EIA 
concludes that the project’s anticipated environmental impacts can be mitigated through full and 
effective implementation of the EMP, which forms part of the PAM (Attachment 5). 
54. 
EMP. The project EIA and EMP, not the domestic EIA, forms the basis of the official loan 
agreement  between  ADB  and  ETMAPG.  The  EMP  is  the  key  document  to  be  used  by  the 
ETMAPG  and  contractors  to  manage  and  report  on  the  environmental  impacts  of  project 
construction  and  operation.  The  EMP  defines  the  mitigation  measures,  monitoring  program, 
grievance redress mechanism (GRM), public consultation plan, and roles and responsibilities for 
the  project  agencies.  The  ETMAPG, 
the  PMO,  holds  final  responsibility  for 
implementation and compliance with the EMP. The ETMAPG and implementing agencies will be 
responsible for ensuring the project is designed, constructed, decommissioned, and operated in 
accordance  with:  (i)  the  national  and  local  government  environmental,  health  and  safety  laws, 
regulations, procedures, and guidelines; (ii) ADB’s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009); and (iii) 
the  EMP.  A  full-time  environmental  officer  has  been  assigned  in  the  PMO  to  coordinate 
implementation  of  the  EMP.  The  effectiveness  of  the  mitigation  measures  will  be  evaluated 
through  environmental  inspections  and  monitoring.  The  loan  implementation  environment 
consultants will support the PMO and contractors to implement the EMP. 
through 
55. 
EMP  update  and  bidding  documents.  In  the  design  stage  the  ETMAPG  will  forward 
the  EMP  to:  (i)  the  design  institutes  for  incorporating  mitigation  measures  into  the  detailed 
technical  designs; (ii)  the  wetland  specialist,  who  will  design  the  fauna habitat features for the 
embankments  and  constructed  wetlands.  The  EMP  will  be  updated  at  the  end  of  the  detailed 
design,  as  needed,  reviewed  by  ADB,  and  re-posted  on  the  ADB  website.  To  ensure  that 
contractors  comply    with    the    EMP,  the  PMO  will    prepare    and    provide  the  following  for 
incorporation  into the bidding documents: (i) a list of environmental  management requirements  
to  be  budgeted by bidders in their proposals, (ii) environmental  clauses for contractual terms  
and    conditions,  and  (iii)  the  updated  EMP.  The  contractors  and  supervision  companies  will 
incorporate the EMP mitigation measures in their construction plans and will also be responsible 
for  preparation  of  Site  Environmental  Management  and  Supervision  Plan,  as  well  as  internal 
impact  monitoring  will  be 
environmental  monitoring  during  construction.  Environmental 
conducted by the Environment Monitoring Stations, contracted by the ETMAPG. Assurances for 
environmental  safeguards  have  been  prepared  and  are  included  in  the  loan  and  project 
agreements. During project implementation, related trainings will be conducted by implementing 
agencies, wetland and greenhouse (GHG) specialists.  
56. 
Environmental  benefits.  The  project  will  result  in  environmental  benefits  including:  (i) 
improvement in water quality of the Qing River in the project area from Class V to above Class 
IV; (i) reduction in flood risk frequency from 1 in 4 years recurrence to 1 in 20 years, to benefit 
about  70,900  households;  (iii)  100%  completion  of  the  wastewater  treatment  targets  of  Enshi 
and  Lichuan  cities;  (iv)  improved  sewage  coverage  for  about  40,000  households;  (v)  overall 
43 
improved  management  of  water  resources  in  the  ETMAPG,  through  the  project  non-structural 
and structural measures.  
57. 
Potential  impacts.  Dredging  will  result  in  temporary  damage  of  in-channel  and 
riverbank  habitats,  elevated  levels  of  suspended  solids,  limited  clearance  of  vegetation,  and 
localized  impacts  to  aquatic  invertebrates,  fish,  and  possibly  other  fauna.  Other  construction 
impacts include localized air pollution, noise and vibration, fugitive dust, soil erosion, solid waste 
disposal,  interference  with  traffic  and  municipal  facilities,  and  occupational  and  community 
health  and  safety.  Potential  operational  impacts  include  odor  and  GHG  emissions  from  the 
wastewater  treatment  plants  (WWTPs),  lack  of  maintenance  of  project  structures,  and  higher 
flow  velocities  in  the  Qing  River.  Potential  cumulative  and/or  induced  impacts,  including  the 
effects  of  climate  change,  have  been  assessed.  Design  and  mitigation  measures  for  the 
potential impacts have been developed. For the dredging and embankments, this includes the 
use  of  specialized  machinery,  timing  of  dredging,  fauna  habitat  designs,  use  of  native  plant 
species  for  habitats,  and  post-construction  monitoring  of  sediments,  flow  velocity,  and  aquatic 
invertebrates. For the WWTPs, safe distances to residences have been modeled to avoid odor 
impacts. A GHG specialist will work with the WWTPs to minimize GHG emissions. Training will 
be  given  for  maintenance  of  the  new  structures.  Community  teams  will  be  established  to 
strengthen  solid  waste  disposal  and  environmental  and  flood  risk  awareness.  Impacts  will  be 
avoided  and/or mitigated  through  implementation  of the  EMP.  The  EIA  concludes  that  full  and 
effective implementation of the EMP, together with the prescribed capacity training, will result in 
minor residual impacts that are within the limits of the PRC standards defined in the EMP. 
58. 
Public  consultation  and  GRM.  Information  disclosure  and  two  rounds  of  public 
consultations  were  conducted during the  EIA  in accordance  with  the  PRC  Guideline  on  Public 
Consultation  in  EIA  (2006)  and  ADB’s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  Public  concerns 
about air and water pollution were documented and have been addressed in the project design. 
A project-specific GRM has been established to receive and manage any community concerns 
which  may  arise  due  to  the  project.  The  PMO  is  the  lead  agency  that  will  have  final 
responsibility  for  management,  implementation  and  reporting  of  the  GRM.  The  PMO 
Environmental  and  Social  Officers  will  coordinate  the  GRM  and:  (i)  instruct  the  implementing 
agencies, local environmental protection bureaus, and contractors on their responsibilities in the 
GRM;  (ii)  establish  a  simple  registry  system,  to  document  and  track  grievances  received 
(including forms to record complaints and how they have been resolved); (iii) report on progress 
of  the  GRM  in  the  quarterly  project  progress  reports  and  the  semi-annual  environmental  and 
resettlement  monitoring  and  progress  reports  to  ADB;  and  (iv)  arrange  future  public 
roles  and

the  PMO,  implementing agencies,  contractors,  and  construction  and  supervision  companies  in 
accordance  with  the  training  plan  in  the  EMP  (Attachment  5),  to  ensure  adequate  institutional 
capacity in managing the environmental impacts. The training will include: (i) implementation of 
the  EMP  for  mitigation,  monitoring,  and  reporting;  (ii)  management  and  maintenance  of  the 
constructed wetlands and fauna habitats of the embankments; (iiii) improved WWTP operations 
to reduce GHG emissions; (iv) inclusion of the EMP in project tenders and review of bids; and 
(v)  implementation  of  the  GRM,  including  access  points,  roles,  and  responsibilities  for  project 
agencies. 
44 
Budget.  The  ETMAPG  shall  make  available,  and  cause  the  implementing  agencies  to 
60. 
make available, the necessary budgetary and human resources to fully implement the EMP. If 
any unanticipated environmental risks and impacts arise during construction or operation of the 
project  that  were  not  considered  in  the  EIA  and/or  EMP,  the  ETMAPG,  through  the 
implementing agencies, should promptly inform ADB in writing of the occurrence of such risks or 
impacts, with detailed description of the event and the proposed action plan for incorporation in 
the updated EMP. The estimated budget for the EMP is in Table A1.8 of the EMP. 
B.  Resettlement 
61. 
The  project  is  classified  as  Category  A  for  involuntary  resettlement  due  to  significant 
land  acquisition  and  resettlement  impacts.  ETMAPG,  with  the  support  of  a  local  institute, 
prepared  two  resettlement  plans  according  to  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  The 
resettlement  planning  and  implementation  is  designed  to  ensure  that  the  affected  persons 
(APs)20 will be better off or at least not worst off as a result of the project. 
Land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  Enshi  Subproject：The  resettlement  impacts  of 
62. 
this subproject mainly include permanent collective rural land acquisition, permanent acquisition 
of state-owned land and rural house demolition. 671.4 mu of land will be permanently occupied 
in the project, including 662.183 mu of collective land and 9.217 mu state-owned land; 546.2 mu 
of  land  will  be  temporarily  occupied.  Total  654  HHs  with  2,653  persons  will  be  affected  by 
permanent land acquisition. Total 4,255.52m2 of rural house will be demolished, affecting 8 HHs 
with  26  persons.  In total,  662  HHs  with  2,679  persons  will  be  affected  by  land  acquisition  and 
house  demolition.  After  the  adjustment,  land  acquisition  decreased  by  19.7  mu,  house 
demolition decreased by 2,223 square meters, affecting 45 fewer households with 189 people. 
Lichuan Subproject ：607.395 mu of land will be permanently occupied by the project, including 
497.8 mu  of  collective  land,  109.6  mu  of  state-owned  land.  454  mu  of  land  will  be temporarily 
occupied. 661 HHs with 2797 persons will be only affected by land acquisition; 50 HHs with 175 
persons will be only affected by temporary land acquisition. 11 HHs with 30 persons will be only 
affected by house demolition, and 1541 m2 of rural dwelling houses will be demolished. After the 
project adjustment, the land acquisition is reduced by 56 mu. The number of APs is reduced by 
65. and the number of AHs affected by house demolition is reduced by 4. 
63. 
The  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  compensation  standards  will  follow  the  Land 
Administration Law of the People’s Republic of China (2004), Decision of the State Council on 
Deepening  the  Reform and  Rigidly  Enforcing  Land  Administration  (SC  [2004]  No.28)  (October 
21, 2004), and other applicable guidelines. They will also be based on local policies regarding 
land  acquisition  and  resettlement  (LAR)  in  Hubei  Province,  Enshi  Prefecture,  and  ADB’s 
Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  HPG  and  ETMAPG  will  provide  necessary  assistance  for 
house construction and relocation during resettlement implementation. 
64. 
All  affected  people  are  eligible  to  compensation  and  assistance.  The  cut-off  date  for 
eligible  resettlement  entitlement  of  the  project  was  on  30  June  2014.  Compensation  for 
acquisition of collectively-owned land includes land compensation, resettlement subsidy, social 
20 ADB’s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) trigger for involuntary resettlement changed the terminology of “affected 
persons” which are defined as persons who are physically and/or economically displaced as a result of involuntary 
acquisition  of  land  or  voluntary  restrictions  on  land  use  or  on  access  to  legally  designated  parks  and  protected 
areas.  In  the  PRC,  although  the  resettlement  plans  maintain  the  original  terminology  of  “affected  persons”,  the 
definition is equivalent to ADB’s definition of “displaced persons”. 
45 
security fund, young crop compensation and ground attachment compensation. Compensation 
for occupation of state-owned land for paid use will be made based on the benchmark land price 
published by ETMAPG for the respective areas. Compensation on rural residential houses to be 
relocated  will  be  made  based  on  the  house  replacement  price  determined  by  appraisal.  The 
affected  households  will  be  entitled  to participate  in  the  process  of  choosing  appraisal  agency 
and decline the appraisal result. Meanwhile, the property-exchange house will be another option 
for the APs to choose, if they prefer.  
Resettlement  and  income  restoration.  The  key  actions  of  economic  restoration  will 
65. 
include:  monetary  compensation,  uniform  resettlement  houses,  temporary  living  subsidies  for 
displaced  persons,  social  security  funds  provided  by  local  security  system  for  all  eligible 
persons.  The  skill  training  (including  employment  at  non-agricultural  positions,  project 
employments, non-monetary supports, etc.) is also provided for APs.  
66. 
Institutional  arrangements.  The  PMO  will  assume  the  overall  responsibility  for  the 
implementation of LAR, including the planning, implementation, financing, and reporting of LAR. 
LMC  will  take  the  primary  responsibility  of  the  resettlement  consultation,  implementation,  and 
timely delivery of entitlements. To ensure smooth implementation, the staff in charge of LAR will 
undertake  training  on  resettlement  implementation  organized  by  the  PMO.  The  resettlement 
implementation  schedule  has  been  prepared  based  on  the  preparation  and  construction 
timetable.  The  resettlement  plans  will  be  updated  based  on  the  final  design  and  detailed 
measurement  survey,  disclosed  to  affected  persons,  and  submitted  to  ADB  for  review  and 
approval prior to the award of civil works contract. 
67. 
For  Enshi  City,  the  total  budget  for  the  completed  part  of  land  acquisition  and 
resettlement is CNY 57,718 million. In Daishui River, the new resettlement plan budget for the 
uncompleted part is CNY22.3282 million. The total budget is CNY 80.046 million.  For Lichuan 
City, the total budget is CNY 64.731million. 
68. 
Grievance  redress  mechanism.  A  grievance  redress  mechanism  (GRM)  has  been 
developed in compliance with ADB’s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) requirement to address 
environmental,  health,  safety,  and  social  concerns  associated  with  project  construction, 
operation, land acquisition, and leasing arrangements. The details of the GRM, including a time-
bound flow chart of procedures, are included in the resettlement plans.  
69. 
Displaced  persons  may  file  an  appeal  on  any  aspect  of  resettlement,  including 
compensation  rates,  etc.  The  above  means  of  appeal,  and  the  names,  locations,  persons 
responsible and telephone numbers of the appeal accepting agencies will be communicated to 
the displaced persons at a meeting, through an announcement or the resettlement information 
booklet,  so  that  the  displaced  persons  know  their  right  of  appeal.  Mass  media  will  be  used  to 
strengthen  publicity  and  reporting,  and  comments  and  suggestions  on  resettlement  from  all 
parties  concerned  will  be  shared  by  the  resettlement  organization.  All  agencies  will  accept 
grievances and appeals from the affected people for free, and costs so reasonably incurred will 
be disbursed from the contingency costs. During the whole design and construction periods of 
the  project,  these  appeal  procedures  will  remain  effective  to  ensure  that  the  affected  persons 
can use them to address relevant issues. Affected persons can also submit complaints to ADB 
which will be handled by the project team. If an affected person is still not satisfied and believes 
46 
he/she has been harmed due to non-compliance with ADB policy, s/he may submit a complaint 
to ADB’s Accountability Mechanism.21 
70.  Monitoring.  A  detailed plan  for  both the  internal  and  external  monitoring  is  included  in 
the  resettlement  plans.  PMO  will  submit  an  internal  monitoring  report  through  semiannual 
project  monitoring  report  to  ADB.  Furthermore,  PMO  will  employ  an  external  resettlement 
monitoring institute or firm to establish an independent external monitoring organization in order 
to deliver an independent and unbiased external monitoring report. A baseline study of affected 
persons will be completed for each resettlement plan before the LAR begins and the report will 
be submitted in September 2015. After that and until project completion, semiannual monitoring 
reports will be prepared and submitted for ADB’s review during resettlement implementation and 
annually  for  two  years  after  completion  of  resettlement.  The  implementation  plan  of  the 
resettlement plans are summarized in the table below. 
Pursuant to ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement (2009),22 ADB funds may not be applied 
71. 
to the activities described on the ADB Prohibited Investment Activities List set forth at Appendix 
5 of the Safeguard Policy Statement.

C.  Ethnic Minorities 
72. 
The project is categorized as B for the Indigenous Peoples Safeguard. Ethnic minorities 
make  up  about  43.9%  of  the  population  of  ETMAP.  The  social  assessment  found  they  are 
economically  and  socially  integrated  and  will  benefit  equally  from  the  project  activities  as  the 
mainstream population in ETMAP. The Ethnic Minority Development Plan (EMDP) assures that 
ethnic  minorities  will  be  targeted  by  non-structural  measures  in  urban  areas  to  benefit  from 
project  improvements,  and  benefit  from  job  opportunities  created  under  the  project.  In  rural 
areas,  Tujia  and  Miao  villages  will  be  targeted  as  benefiting  communities  of  the  wastewater 
collection system and non-structural measures. The project will not have any negative impacts 
on the dignity, human rights, traditional lands or culture of ethnic minorities. An estimated 40% 
of  persons  affected  by  land  acquisition  are  considered  ethnic  minorities.  Impacts  on  those 
persons  will  be  separately  recorded  in  the  resettlement  and  EMDP monitoring, to  ensure  their 
restoration of livelihood.

VIII.  GENDER AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS 
A.  Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy 
This section describes the required actions for gender and social dimensions, other than 
73. 
social  safeguards.  A  social,  poverty  and  gender  analysis  was  undertaken  in  accordance  with 
ADB  guidelines.  The  analysis  collected  information  to  assist  in  the  design  of  the  project  by 
identifying  the  poor,  examining  causes  of  poverty  and  recommending  poverty  reduction 
measures within the scope of the project. 
74. 
The  project  will  directly  benefit  about  70,900  households  for  improved  flood  protection 
and 40,000 households for wastewater collection and treatment, of whom approximately 6% are 
poor.  The  project  will  create  about  6,300  full-time  jobs  during  the  construction  period  and  105 
during the operation stage. Employment targets for vulnerable groups and women are included 
in  the  design  and  monitoring  framework  and  loan  assurances.  Better  flood  management  and 
expansion of sewage collection and wastewater treatment system will improve public health. A 
social  action  plan  (SAP)  and  a  gender  action  plan  (GAP)  have  been  prepared  and  will  be 
implemented by the PMO in collaboration with other stakeholders during project implementation. 
The  project  will  not  only  improve  the  urban  environment,  but  also  raise  public  awareness  on 
water  conservation,  solid  waste  management,  flood  risk  and  preparedness  and  thereby  help 
sustain socioeconomic development in Enshi. 
B.  Gender Development and Gender Action Plan 
The  project  is  categorized  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  Women  focus  group 
75. 
discussions found that environmental improvements are anticipated to have a significant gender 
impact, with reduced time burdens and costs for healthcare, preparation for floods, and clean-up 
after floods; and with overall improvement of surroundings. The project will also create women’s 
employment  opportunities.  A  GAP  has  been  prepared  to  ensure  that  women  are  kept  fully 
informed  and  consulted  throughout  the  project.  Gender  specific  indicators  have  also  been 
included  in  the  project’s  design  and  monitoring  framework.  The  GAP  includes  measures  to 
address gender concerns in all project components and capacity development, which include (i) 
ensuring  the  effective  inclusion  of  women  in  all  project  activities;  and  (ii)  ensuring,  as  far  as 
possible,  that  the  targets  set  for  the  employment  of  women  are  met,  and  that  the  work 
conditions  of  and  pay  for  men  and  women  are  equitable.  Resettlement  plan  measures  will 
mitigate  any  possible  negative  impacts  of  the  project  on  women  due  to  land  acquisition  and 
resettlement impacts. See table 1 for the GAP. 
76. 
The GAP includes provisions to ensure that staff of the PMO and implementing agencies 
is  fully  briefed  on  gender  in  development  and  the  GAP,  at  the  commencement  of  project 
implementation. The staff responsible for social safeguards and gender will work with women’s 
federations,  contractors,  and  community  office  staff  to  facilitate  the  participation  of  women  in 
opportunities for physical works; and, ensure that all PRC labor laws and core labor standards 
are respected. The staff will also ensure (i) gender disaggregated baseline and survey data will 
be  collected,  (ii)  the  GAP  is  implemented,  monitored,  and  reported  to  ADB  through  quarterly 
project  progress  reports.  Social  development  specialists  engaged  for  project  management 
support  will  mentor  the  staff  as  necessary,  and  facilitate  achievement  of  the  project’s  gender 
and  development  objectives.  The  GAP  will  be  monitored  during  ADB  review  missions  and 
supervision will be supported by ADB’s social development specialist. 
53 
C.  Social Action Plan 
77. 
A  Social  Action  Plan  (SAP)  has  been  prepared  in  order  to  facilitate  continued 
consultation and participation of communities in the project, as well as ensure that labor rights 
and entitlements are observed and that the needs of poor households are considered. 
78.  Measures  in  the  SAP  place  a  particular  emphasis  on  establishing  community 
environmental  supervision  and  flood  management  teams  (CESFMTs)  to  raise  environmental 
awareness of residents, eliminate improper disposal of solid waste, and promote awareness of 
early flood warning and response in pilot communities in Enshi and Lichuan.  It is important that 
these are not just educational campaigns, but involve behavioral change advocacy.  
79. 
Under guidance of the consultants, the CESFMTs’ activities will include: 
(i)  development of methods of publicizing status of water quality using language and 
formats that the public can understand; 
(ii)  improvement of solid waste disposal so it does not end up in or alongside rivers and 
channels (relocation of neighborhood garbage disposal sites, development of 
community-funded garbage collection and disposal systems, cooperation with the 
local environmental service office for provision of large disposal bins and more 
frequent garbage collection, public awareness raising, community enforcement, etc.); 
and 
(iii) development and publication of flood warning, evacuation, and emergency response 
procedures for the community. 
80. 
The  SAP  also  indicates  that  civil  works  contracts  will  stipulate  (i)  that  local  people  will 
receive priority with respect to employment, (ii) that equal wages will be paid for work of equal 
value, and that women’s wages will be paid directly to them, (iii) that no child or forced labor will 
be employed, and (iv) that all employees will be provided with a written contract in accordance 
with the format prescribed by Chinese national law.

B.  Monitoring  
A. 
Project performance monitoring  
The  project  performance  management  system  (PPMS)  indicators,  their  relevance,  and 
81. 
monitoring  practicalities  will  be  discussed  with  the  executing  agency,  implementing  agencies 
and project beneficiaries during project implementation. Disaggregated baseline data for output 
and  outcome  indicators  gathered  during  project  processing  will  be  updated  and  reported 
through  the  quarterly  progress  reports  of  the  project  management  office  and  after  each  ADB 
review  mission.  These  quarterly  reports  will  provide  information  necessary  to  update  ADB's 
project  performance  reporting  system.25 At  the  start  of  project  implementation,  the  PMO  and 
implementing  agencies,  with  the  project  implementation  consulting  services,  will  develop 
integrated  PPMS  procedures  to  generate  data  systematically  on  the  inputs  and  outputs  of  the 
components, as well as the indicators to be used to measure the project’s impact and outcome 
taking  into  account  the  components’  scope.  The  PMO  will  be  responsible  for  monitoring  and 
reporting on project performance. The basis for performance monitoring will be the design and 
monitoring  framework,  which  identifies  performance  targets  for  the  impact,  outcomes,  and 
outputs of the project. By collecting data from the sources identified in the DMF, the PMO will be 
able  to  report  on  an  annual  basis  the  performance  of  the  project.  Specific  reporting 
requirements will be set out in the agreement between ADB and the Government. The PMO will 
collect  the  data,  calculate  the  indicators,  analyze  the  results,  and  prepare  a  brief  report 
describing the extent to which the project is generating the intended outputs and outcomes, as 
well  as  the  overall  impact  on  ETMAP.  The  relevance  and  practicability  of  data  collection  for 
indicators was confirmed with the PMO and the implementing agencies. Meanwhile, the agreed 
socioeconomic  and  environmental  indicators  to  be  used  will  be  further  enhanced  to  measure 
project impacts. The PMO and the implementing agencies agreed and confirmed that they will 
(i) refine  and  integrate the  PPMS framework  at the  start of  project  implementation;  (ii) confirm 
that targets are achievable; (iii) develop recording, monitoring, and reporting arrangements; and 
(iv) establish systems and procedures no later than six months after project inception. 
B. 
Compliance monitoring 
The  ETMAPG,  with  assistance  of  Enshi  City  and  Lichuan  City  governments, 
82. 
implementing  agencies  and  the  project  management  consultants,  will  conduct  compliance 
monitoring, and submit reports and information to ADB concerning the use of the loan proceeds, 
project  implementation,  implementing  agencies’  project  implementation  performance,  and 
compliance  of  loan  and  project  covenants.  These  reports  will  include  (i)  quarterly  progress 
reports  on  project  implementation;  and  (ii)  a  project  completion  report,  which  should  be 
submitted  not  later  than  three  months  after  the  completion  of  the  project  facilities.  The 
compliance  status  of  loan  and  project  covenants  will  be  reported  and  assessed  through 
quarterly progress report. ADB review missions will verify status. 
C. 
Safeguards monitoring 
a. 
Environment 
83. 
Three  types  of  environment  safeguard  monitoring  will  be  conducted  under  the  EMP: 
compliance  monitoring;  internal  monitoring;  and,  external  monitoring.  The  environmental 
25 ADB’s project performance reporting system is available at: 
http://www.adb.org/Documents/Slideshows/PPMS/default.asp?p=evaltool 
68 
monitoring  program,  including  roles,  responsibilities,  monitoring  frequency  and  variables,  is 
described  in  Section  E  of  the  EMP.  ADB  and  the  PMO  will  monitor  the  status  of  EMP 
implementation 
through:  (i)  PMO  quarterly  project  progress  reports  and  semi-annual 
environmental  progress  reports  to  ADB;  (ii)  reports  by  the  loan  implementation  environment 
consultant to PMO and ADB; and (iii) review missions. EMP implementation will be coordinated 
by  the  PMO  Environment  Officer,  supported  by  the  PMO,  project  municipal  and  county 
environmental  protection  bureaus,  and  loan  implementation  environment  consultant, to  ensure 
overall compliance of all relevant agencies with the EMP. 
84. 
Compliance  monitoring  –  documents  procedural  compliance  of  the  project  with  the 
EMP,  including  all  required  tasks  of  mitigation,  monitoring,  and  reporting.  To  be  conducted  by 
the loan implementation environment consultant. 
85. 
Internal  monitoring  –  the  management  of  construction  activities  and  quantitative 
measurement  of  selected  environmental  variables.  To  be  conducted  by  the  implementing 
agencies  and  construction  contractors.  During  construction,  the  monitoring  will  include  air 
quality  and  noise  at  construction  sites  and  the  discharge  water  quality,  odor  and  treated 
sediment  quality  at  dredge  spoil  treatment  sites.  During  operations,  internal  monitoring  will 
include the quality of treated wastewater and sludge from the wastewater treatment plants and 
the progress of embankment and wetland landscaping. 
86. 
External  monitoring  –  the  quantitative  measurement  of  selected  environmental 
variables  at  and  near  construction  sites  to  ensure  compliance  with  regulatory  standards. 
External monitoring covers many of the same parameters as the internal monitoring, acting as a 
verification of the results by the implementing agencies and contractors. External monitoring will 
monitor  the  re-establishment  of  the  aquatic  habitat  after  river  works.  To  be  conducted  by  the 
Enshi  and  Lichuan  environment  monitoring  stations  for  dust,  noise,  odor,  dredge  spoil,  and 
surface  water  quality  and  flow,  and  the  Wuhan  environment  monitoring  station  for  aquatic 
invertebrates, and surface water quality and flow (the latter in the operational phase).

environment  consultant  will  assess  the  readiness  of  the  PMO  and  implementing  agencies  for 
environmental management, based on a set of indicators (Table A1.3 in the EMP) and report to 
ADB  and  PMO.  This  assessment  will  demonstrate  that  environmental  commitments  are  being 
met  and  environmental  management  systems  are  in  place  before  construction  starts,  and/or 
suggest corrective actions to ensure that all requirements are met.

Environmental  acceptance  reporting.  Following  the  PRC  Regulation  on  Project 
Completion Environmental Audit (MEP, 2001), within three months after the completion of major 
components,  an  environmental  acceptance  report  for  each  shall  be  prepared  by  a  licensed 
environmental  monitoring  institute.  The  report  will  be  reviewed  and  approved  by  the  Enshi 
Prefecture environment protection bureau and reported to ADB. The environmental acceptance 
reports of the component completions will indicate the timing, extent, effectiveness of completed 
mitigation and of maintenance, and the needs for additional mitigation measures and monitoring 
during operations. 
b. 
Resettlement and ethnic minorities 
Internal and external monitoring of resettlement plan implementation will be conducted. 
89. 
Monitoring methodologies  are  specified  in  the resettlement  plans.  The  Enshi  City  Government 
(ECG) and Lichuan City Government (LCG) will carry out internal supervision and monitoring to 
69 
ensure  compliance  with  the  provisions  of  the  resettlement  plans  and  submit  internal 
resettlement  monitoring  reports  semiannually  during  project  implementation,  to  be  submitted 
together  with  the  regular  project  monitoring  report.  The  PPMS  includes  indicators  on 
resettlement  plan  monitoring,  and  the  required  frequency.  The  PMO,  ECG,  and  LCG  have 
agreed  to  a  set  of  supervision  milestones  with  ADB,  to  ensure  timely  and  effective 
implementation of resettlement activities. An external monitoring agency acceptable to ADB will 
be engaged by ECG and LCG prior to commencement of resettlement plan implementation and 
land  acquisition.  The  external  monitoring  agency  will  prepare  pre-resettlement  plan 
implementation baseline surveys and reports, and implement external monitoring and evaluation 
of  resettlement  plan  implementation.  Semiannual  external  monitoring  reports  will  be  prepared 
and  submitted  to  ADB  during  RP  implementation,  and  annual  evaluation  reports  will  be 
forwarded directly to both the PMO and ADB for two years after conclusion of resettlement plan 
implementation.  Both  implementing  units  will  be  responsible  to  prepare  and  submit  a 
resettlement completion report to ADB. 
90.  Monitoring  of  the  ethnic  minority  development  plan  (EMDP)  implementation  will  be 
conducted  by  the  PMO.  Monitoring  methodologies  are  specified  in  the  EMDP.  ECG  and  LCG 
will carry out internal supervision and monitoring to ensure compliance with the provisions of the 
EMDP  and submit  ethnic  minority  development monitoring  reports  semiannually  during  project 
implementation.  The  PMO,  ECG,  and  LCG  have  agreed  to  ensure  timely  and  effective 
implementation of the EMDP.  
D. 
Gender and social action plans 
91.  Monitoring  indicators  for  the  GAP  and  SAP  have  been  incorporated  into  the  PPMS. 
Clear  targets  and  indicators  have  been  established  and  some  indicators,  such  as  those  on 
employment,  are  also  captured  in  the  design  and  monitoring  framework.  The  regular  project 
progress  reports  to  ADB  will  include,  at  least  semi-annually,  reporting  on  all  the  indicators 
included  in  the  GAP.  Assistance  will  be  provided  for  the  executing  agency  and  implementing 
agencies by the resettlement and social development consultant who will help to set up effective 
monitoring systems and work with the focal points in the ETMAPG and implementing agencies 
to ensure implementation and monitoring of the GAP and SAP. 
C.  Evaluation 
ADB, ETMAPG, and implementing agencies will undertake a semiannual review mission 
92. 
to evaluate the progress of project implementation. ADB, ETMAPG, and implementing agencies 
will  undertake  a  comprehensive  midterm  review  two  years  after  the  start  of  project 
implementation  to  have  a  detailed  evaluation  of  the  scope,  implementation  arrangements, 
resettlement, achievement of scheduled targets, and progress on the agenda for policy reform 
and  capacity  building  measures.  Feedback  from  the  PPMS  activities  will  be  analyzed.  Within 
three  months  of  physical  completion  of  the  project,  the  PMO  will  submit  a  project  completion 
report to ADB.26

E.  Stakeholder Communication Strategy  
96. 
Project  information  will  be  communicated  through  public  consultation,  information 
disclosure  mechanism  in  ADB’s  and  government’s  website,  meetings,  interviews,  focus  group 
discussions,  and  community  consultation meetings,  in  accordance  with ADB’s  requirements  of 
public  communication  policy.  Main  stakeholders  are  the  different  government  agencies, 
beneficiaries,  displaced  persons,  and  participants  in  the  project  implementation.  Stakeholder 
82 
communication is part of the resettlement plans, environmental management plan, EMDP, SAP 
and the GAP and will be monitored accordingly.  
97. 
Environment.  Meaningful  consultation,  participation  and  information  disclosure  was 
conducted  during  project  preparation.  Information  disclosure  and  public  consultation  included 
newspaper disclosure; informal communication with key stakeholders, including residents, local 
authorities  and  sector  specific  institutions  and  authorities;  questionnaire  surveys;  and  wider 
stakeholder  meetings  attended  by  affected  people  and  other  concerned  stakeholders.  A  GRM 
has  been  defined  to  prevent  and  address  community  concerns,  reduce  risks,  and  assist  the 
project in maximizing environmental and social benefits.  
98. 
Involuntary  resettlement  and  ethnic  minorities.  All  of  the  affected  households  and 
towns/townships,  leaders  and  town  and  township  governments  will  be  involved  in  the  project 
resettlement  baseline  survey.  Through  meetings,  interviews,  focus  group  discussions,  public 
consultation  workshops,  and  community  consultation  meetings,  local  representatives  have 
participated in the planning and concerns have been integrated into the resettlement plans and 
EMDP. Before implementation, the PMO, implementing agencies and other relevant leaders will 
further  discuss  and  consult  with  the  affected  persons’  representatives  the  impacts  on  every 
town/township  and  the  detailed  compensation  plan  to  ensure  affected  persons’  interests  are 
protected  and  to  provide  employment  opportunities  for  the  affected  persons’  livelihoods  as  a 
result  of  project  implementation.  The  PMO  and  implementing  agencies  will  disclose  the 
resettlement plans and EMDP in the offices and to affected people. The resettlement plans and 
EMDP  will  also  be  posted  on  the  ADB  website.  Resettlement  information  booklets  were 
distributed  to  affected  households.  This  guideline  contains  information  such  as  the  affected 
project area, proposed land acquisition and relocation implementation progress and procedure, 
compensation  standards  for  land  acquisition,  relocation  assistance,  and  livelihood  restoration 
strategy. Each implementing agency will establish a project resettlement unit for supervision of 
implementation,  continued  public  consultation,  monitoring  of  progress,  and  response  to 
grievances. The grievance redress procedures will be established and explanations have been 
included in the resettlement information booklets. 
99. 
During project implementation, consultations with minority people affected by the project 
will  be  conducted.  During  the  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  phase,  all  affected  minority 
people  and  villages  will  be  provided  the  opportunity  to  review  and  consult  the  final 
compensation  packages  before  signing  compensation  agreements.  The  agreed  compensation 
rates  and  rehabilitation  measures  will  be  disclosed  in  the  area  affected  by  the  project  and  be 
supervised by the affected people. Relocated minority households will have a choice of cash or 
an  in-kind  rehabilitation  option.  For  landless  farmers,  a  training  needs  assessment  will  be 
carried  out  by  the  local  government.  Beyond  resettlement,  ethnic  minority  villages  have  been 
consulted  during  the  project  design  period  about  their  participation  in  non-structural  measures 
and  nonpoint  source  pollution  pilot  activities.  Ethnic  minority  will  participate  in  CESFMT  and 
other  community  awareness  programs.  Their  participation  is  essential  for  those  activities,  and 
they will be further consulted about who participates, and the activities to be piloted. 
100.  GAP and SAP. Public disclosure of all project documents will be undertaken through the 
implementing  agencies  and  on  the  ADB  website  including  the  project  data  sheet,  DMF,  EIA, 
resettlement plans, EMDP, and RRP. Disclosure of social and environmental monitoring reports 
will be undertaken during project implementation. 
101.  Consultations with communities have taken place and will continue at different points in

environmental impacts and defines mitigation measures and monitoring requirements for the 
design,  construction,  and  operational  stages  of  the  project.  It  also  defines  the  institutional 
arrangements and mechanisms, roles and responsibilities of different institutions, and costs 
for EMP implementation. The EMP seeks to avoid, reduce, and/or mitigate adverse impacts 
and risks. The EMP is based on the findings of the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) 
and domestic environmental assessment report. 
It  summarizes 
2. 
The  EIA  and  EMP  have  been  disclosed  on  the  ADB  public  website  (www.adb.org) 
since November 2014 and are also included in the Project Administration Manual (PAM). The 
EMP  will  be  included  as  a  separate  annex  in  all  bidding  and  contract  documents.  The 
contractors  will  be  informed  of  their  obligations  to  implement  the  EMP,  and  to  provide  for 
EMP implementation costs in their bids for project works. 
The EMP includes a monitoring program. Monitoring results will be used to evaluate: 
3. 
(i) the extent and severity of actual environmental impacts against the predicted impacts; (ii) 
the  performance  of  the  environmental  protection  measures  and  compliance  with  relevant 
laws and regulations; (iii) trends of impacts; and (iv) overall effectiveness of the EMP.

C.  Summary of Potential Impacts and Mitigation Measures 
11. 
Potential  environmental  issues  and  impacts  during  the  project  pre-construction, 
construction and operation phases, and corresponding mitigation measures, are summarized 
in Table A1.2. These measures were developed jointly by the PMO, design institute (DI), EIA 
Institute and PPTA team during the project preparation phase. The domestic EIA provided a 
list  and  costs  for  mitigation  and  environmental  measures,  and  these  have  been  adapted  to 
the  more  detailed  itemization  included  in  Table  A1.2.  The  costs  total  for  mitigation  and 
management measures in the domestic EIA have been retained in this EMP.

E.  Monitoring and Reporting 
13. 
Three types of project monitoring will be conducted under the EMP.  
(i)  Internal monitoring. To be conducted by the IAs and their contractors. 
(ii) External monitoring. To be conducted by the EMS of Enshi and Lichuan Cities. 
(iii)Compliance monitoring. To be conducted by the LIEC. 
14. 
Internal  environmental  monitoring  includes  the  monitoring  of  air  quality  and  noise  at 
all  construction  sites  as  well  as  the  quality  of  discharged  water,  odor  and  treated  sediment 
quality  at  dredge  spoil  treatment  sites.  During  operations,  internal  monitoring  will  cover 
quality of treated wastewater and sludge from the WWTPs and the progress of embankment 
and wetland landscaping. External monitoring (i) covers many of the same parameters and is 
a verification of the internal monitoring, (ii) also measures effects at sensitive receptors and 
ecosystems, and (iii) will monitor the re-establishment of the aquatic habitat after river works. 
Compliance monitoring is independent evaluation of the overall progress of the entire EMP – 
see Para. 17.

Table  A1.4  shows  the  environmental  monitoring  program  designed  for  this  project, 
15. 
defining  the scope,  location,  parameter,  duration  and  frequency,  and  responsible  agencies, 
for  monitoring  during  the  construction  and  operational  stages.  Monitoring  needs  were 
identified  in  the  environmental  assessment  and  also  reflect  the  requirements  of  national 
regulatory standards. Monitoring costs are estimates based on the experience of the PPTA 
team  and  PMO  from  other  projects  in  Hubei  Province  and  elsewhere  in  the  PRC.  These 
costs were discussed and agreed by the PMO and PPTA team during loan processing. ADB 
will  oversee  project  compliance  on  the  basis  of  the  semi-annual  environmental  monitoring 
reports provided by the PMO and site visits as required.   
16. 
The  results  of  the  environmental  monitoring  will  be  compared  with  relevant  PRC 
performance  standards  in  Table  A1.5.  Non-compliance  with  these  standards  will  be 
highlighted  in  the  monitoring  reports.  Monitoring  results  will  be  submitted  to  the  PMO  and 
then  reported  by  the  PMO  to  ADB  in  semi-annual  environmental  monitoring  reports 
(prepared with the support of the LIEC – Table A1.6).

Compliance  evaluation.  Independent  evaluation  of  the  compliance  with  EMP 
measures  will  be  undertaken  by  the  LIEC.  The  PMO  will  report  the  LIEC’s  independent 
evaluation to ADB on the project’s adherence to the EMP, along with information on project 
implementation,  environmental  performance  of 
the  contractors,  and  environmental 
compliance  through  quarterly  project  progress  reports  and  semi-annual  environmental 
monitoring reports (Table A.6). The LIEC will support the PMO in developing the semi-annual 
environmental  monitoring  reports.  The  reports  should  identify  any  environment  related 
implementation  issues  and  necessary  corrective  actions,  and  reflect  these  in  a  corrective 
action  plan.  Operation  and  performance  of  the  project  GRM,  environmental  institutional 
strengthening and training, and compliance with all covenants under the project will also be 
included in the report. 
18. 
Environmental  acceptance  reporting.  Following  the  PRC  Regulation  on  Project 
Completion  Environmental  Audit  (MEP,  2001),  within  three  months  after  the  completion  of 
major  components,  an  environmental  acceptance  report  for  each  shall  be  prepared  by  a 
licensed environmental monitoring institute. The report will be reviewed and approved by the 
Enshi  Prefecture  EPB  and  reported  to  ADB  (Table  A1.6).  The  environmental  acceptance 
reports  of  the  component  completions  will  indicate  the  timing,  extent,  effectiveness  of 
completed mitigation and of maintenance, and the needs for additional mitigation measures 
and monitoring during operations.

G.  Grievance Redress Mechanism 
28. 
A Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM) has been established as part of the project 
EMP to receive and manage any public environmental and/or social issues which may arise 
due to  the  Project.  The PMO  will ensure  that potentially  affected  communities  are  informed 
about  the  GRM  at  an  early  stage  of  the  project.  During  the  project  preparation  phase,  the 
IAs, PMO and ETMAP EPB personnel received training on the GRM from the PPTA team. 
29. 
The  PMO  is  the  lead  agency  responsible  for  overall  management,  implementation, 
and  reporting of the GRM.  The  PMO Environment and  Social  Officers  coordinate  the  GRM 
and:  (i)  instruct  the  IAs and  contractors  on  their  responsibilities in  the  GRM;  (ii)  establish  a 
simple registry system, to document and track grievances received (including forms to record 
complaints and how they have been resolved); and (iii) report on progress of the GRM in the 
semi-annual environmental monitoring and progress reports to ADB.  
13 
Appendix 5 
30. 
Each IA has assigned a member of staff, who is responsible for implementation of the 
GRM and other relevant aspects of the EMP. Tasks include keeping a record of complaints. 
At  least  two  months  before  construction  commences,  these  contacts  will  be  publicized  at 
each  IA  construction  site  and  forwarded  to  local  village  committees  to  ensure  that  entry 
points to the GRM are well known.  
31.  GRM  readiness  procedures  prior  to  start  of  construction. To be successful and 
reduce the likelihood of public concerns, the following measures will be implemented before 
any construction:  
1)  On-site  procedures:  (i)  all  contractors  and  work  staff  will  be  briefed  by  the  PMO  on 
the  GRM.  Contractors  and  workers  will  be  instructed  to  be  courteous  to  local 
residents and, in the event they are approached by the general public with an issue, 
to  immediately  halt  their work  and report  the issue  to  the foreman;  (ii)  at  least  one 
sign  will  be  erected  at  each  construction  site  providing  the  public  with  updated 
project information, the GRM process, and contact names and details for the GRM 
entry points.  
2)  Non-project  agencies:  Prior  to  project  construction,  the  PMO  and  will  notify  all 
relevant  agencies  about  the  project  and  GRM,  so  that  if  these  agencies  receive 
complaints,  they  know  to  contact  the  PMO  and  follow  up  as  necessary.  This  will 
include, but not be limited to, local EPBs, the local courts, and police.  
32. 
The procedure and timeframe for the GRM is shown in Figure A1.1 and is as follows.  
Stage  1  (maximum  10  working  days):  Affected  persons  can  submit  a  written  or  oral 
complaint to the contractors or IAs. Complaints received by any other institutions will be 
referred back to the IA for action. The IA will notify the PMO of the complaint within two 
days. The PMO will enter the complaint in the Complaints Register.  
The contractor, in consultation with the IA, attempts to resolve the issue directly with the 
affected  person.  Within  five  working  days  of  receiving  the  complaint,  the  agency  will 
provide  clear  advice  to  the  affected  person  on  the  proposed  corrective  action  and  by 
when it will be taken. The corrective action will be implemented not later than 10 working 
days from receipt of the complaint. The PMO will enter the resolution in the Complaints 
Register. 
If  quick  corrective  action  is  not  possible,  or  the  IA  is  unsure  how  to  proceed,  or  the 
complainant  is  not  satisfied  by  the  initial  corrective  action,  then  the  complaint  will  be 
referred to the PMO for Stage 2. 
Stage  2 (maximum  5  working  days): For complaints not resolved in Stage 1, Stage 2 
is initiated. The PMO Environment Officer, contractor, and IA will meet with the affected 
person and together discuss the issue and identify possible solutions. At the meeting, a 
possible  solution  will  be  agreed  upon.  The  contractor  or  IA,  as  appropriate,  will 
implement the agreed solution and report the outcome to the PMO.  
Stage  3  (maximum  10  working  days): If Stage 2 is unsuccessful (i.e. no solution can 
be identified or the affected person is not satisfied with the proposed solution) the PMO 
will  convene  a  stakeholders  meeting  and  involve  the  Project  Leading  Group  to  ensure 
that any needed inputs from other project agencies are coordinated. The workshop will 
identify  a  solution  acceptable  to  all.  The  agreed  solution  will  be  implemented  and  a 
report on the outcome provided to the PMO. 
The above steps relate to the construction phase where most complaints will be directed 
in  the  first  instance  to  the  contractor  or  IA.  During  initial  operations,  complaints  will  be 
14 
Appendix 5 
received by the operations and maintenance (O&M) units of the facilities. 
PMO  will  inform  ADB  of  all  complaints  and  actions  under  the  GRM  and  include  all 
relevant documents in its progress reports to ADB. 
Any costs incurred to receive, document, and address grievances will be paid by the 
33. 
PMO.  The  grievance  procedures  will  remain  valid  throughout  the  duration  of  project 
construction and the first two years of project operation. 
The  tracking  and  documenting  of  grievance  resolutions  by  the  PMO  will  include  the 
34. 
following  elements:  (i) tracking  forms and  procedures for  gathering  information from  project 
personnel  and  complainant(s);  (ii)  regular  updating  of  the  GRM  database  by  the  PMO 
Environment  and  Social Officers;  (iii)  processes for  informing  stakeholders  about the status 
of  a  case;  and  (iv)  a  simple  but  effective  filing  system,  so  that  data  can  be  retrieved  for 
reporting purposes, including reports to ADB. 
35. 
No part of the project GRM affects the existing rights of affected persons to take their 
complaints  to the  courts.  Also,  at  any time  in  this  process,  an  affected  person  may contact 
ADB (East Asia Department) directly, including the ADB Resident Mission in the PRC. 
36. 
If  the  above  steps  are  unsuccessful,  people  adversely  affected  by  the  project  may 
submit  complaints  to  ADB’s  Accountability  Mechanism.  The  Accountability  Mechanism 
provides  an  independent  forum  and  process  whereby  people  adversely  affected  by  ADB-
assisted projects can voice, and seek a resolution of their problems, as well as report alleged 
violations of ADB‘s operational policies and procedures. Before submitting a complaint to the 
Accountability  Mechanism,  affected  people  should  make  a  good  faith  effort  to  solve  their 
problems by working with the concerned ADB operations department (in this case, the ADB 
East  Asia  Department).  Only  after  doing  that,  and  if  they  are  still  dissatisfied,  should  they 
approach the Accountability Mechanism.32

H.  Cost Estimates 
37. 
This  section  provides  an  estimate  of  the  cost  of  implementing  the  EMP.  The  cost 
comprises  three  categories:  mitigation  measures  (Table  A1.2);  environmental  monitoring 
(Table A1.4); and, training (Table A1.6). Refer to Tables A1.2, A1.4 and A1.6 for more details 
of each item. Costs are presented for the construction and operational phases of the project 
over five  years.  The costs  do not  include: (i)  detailed design  revisions  and  adjustments; (ii) 
Items  3.1-3.3  and  3.5-3.7  in  Table  A1.2,  which  are  operating  costs  of  the  wastewater 
treatment  plants  (WWTPs);  and  (iii)  the  salaries  of  PMO  environment  staff.  Costs  for  the 
mitigation measures are based on estimates in the domestic EIA and the experience of the 
PPTA team and PMO in other projects. Costs for the monitoring and training are estimates 
based on the experience of the PPTA team in similar projects and discussed with the PMO. 
38. 
The  total  estimated  cost  is  CNY4.8  million  over  five  years  (Table  A1.8).  It  is 
anticipated that about CNY2.4 million (51%) will be paid through the construction contractors, 
CNY1.8  million  (37%)  paid  by  the  PMO,  and  CNY0.77  million  (11%)  from  the  ADB  loan 
consultant services. The remaining costs would be paid by the Implementing Agencies. Total 
costs are small given the large scale of the project and when spread over five years.
