1.  The  project  administration  manual  (PAM)  describes  the  essential  administrative  and  management 
requirements to implement the project on time, within budget, and in accordance with the policies and 
procedures  of  the  government  and  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  The  PAM  should  include 
references  to  all  available  templates  and  instructions  either  through  linkages  to  relevant  URLs  or 
directly incorporated in the PAM. 
2.  The Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) is wholly responsible for the implementation of 
this ADB-financed project, as agreed jointly between the borrower and ADB, and in accordance with 
the  policies  and  procedures  of  the  government  and  ADB.  ADB  staff  is  responsible  for  supporting 
implementation  including  compliance  by  BWDB  of  their  obligations  and  responsibilities  for  project 
implementation in accordance with ADB’s policies and procedures. 
3.  At loan negotiations, the borrower and ADB agreed to the PAM and ensured consistency with the loan 
agreement. Such agreement is reflected in the minutes of the loan negotiations. In the event of any 
discrepancy  or  contradiction  between  the  PAM  and  the  loan  agreement,  the  provisions  of  the  loan 
agreement shall prevail. 
4.  After  ADB  Board  approval  of  the  project's  report  and  recommendations  of  the  President  (RRP), 
changes in implementation arrangements are subject to agreement and approval pursuant to relevant 
government and ADB administrative procedures (including the Project Administration Instructions) and 
upon such approval, they will be subsequently incorporated in the PAM.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
1. 
The Irrigation Management Improvement Project is designed to realize the full production 
potential  of  large-scale  irrigation  schemes  in  Bangladesh.  It  will  address  the  recurrent  lack  of 
sustainable management, operation, and maintenance (MOM) and increase water productivity by 
transferring  MOM  schemes  to  private  operators  and  introducing  innovative  infrastructure 
modernization. The project will focus on modernizing the Muhuri Irrigation Project (MIP) in Feni 
district. It will also finance a feasibility study and detailed design for modernizing the Ganges–
Kobadak  Irrigation  Project  (GKIP)  in  Khulna  division  and the  Teesta  Barrage  Irrigation  Project 
(TBIP) in Rangpur division. The additional financing is required to cover cost overruns associated 
with the ongoing project,1 the performance of which is on track.2 
The primary sources of water in Bangladesh are local rainfall amounting to about 250 cubic 
2. 
kilometers (km3) annually and the trans-boundary inflows amounting to about 1,000 km3 annually, 
derived mainly from the Brahmaputra, Ganges, and Meghna Rivers. Bangladesh occupies only 
8% of the total drainage area of these rivers but is located at their downstream end. The result is 
an abundant excess of surface water during the summer monsoon months and water shortfalls in 
the  winter  dry months.  The  impossibility  of  developing  dams’ facilities prevents flow  regulation 
throughout the year. Despite being scarce, water is not well managed. There is minimal attention 
to water use efficiency and equitable allocation. Many farmers rely on groundwater to supplement 
the limited and irregular surface water supplies. However, in many parts, the use of groundwater 
is  significantly  constrained by  arsenic  contamination  and  aquifer  limitations.  Consequently,  the 
minimum flows required to meet total dry season demands are less than what is available from 
surface  and  groundwater.  This  is  aggravated  by  the  increasing  competition  for  water  among 
sectors  including  agriculture,  domestic  and  industrial  water  use,  navigation,  fisheries,  and 
conservation of natural eco-habitats. Possible changes in temperature and rainfall patterns due 
to global warming may also modify crop water requirements and water availability, and adversely 
widen the current gap between supply and demand. 
3. 
Performance  of  irrigated  agriculture  and  large  irrigation  schemes.  In  Bangladesh, 
31.5%  of  the  population  was  living  below  poverty  line  in  2010.  Although  agriculture’s  share  of 
gross domestic product has declined, it is the primary economic sector in rural areas and provides 
63% of rural employment. Bangladesh has a net cultivable area of around 8 million hectares (ha). 
About 5.3 million ha were irrigated in 2011–2012. The total rice production in Bangladesh in 2010–
2011 was 33.5 million metric tons with 56% of the total being produced during the dry season.3 
Productivity of irrigated agriculture remains chronically low; paddy yields during the past 10 years 
average  at  3.6  tons  per  hectare  (t/ha).4  The  low  land  productivity  is  attributable  to  unreliable 
irrigation  supply,  inadequate  agriculture  extension  services  and  poor  access  to  farm  inputs, 
markets and agricultural credit services. Around 550,000 ha or 11% of the total irrigated area is 
1  Cost overruns resulted from  (i) higher bid price than cost estimate at project preparation; (ii)  increase in contract 
quantities; (iii) additional provisions and (iv) SDR depreciation against the US Dollar. 
2   ADB. 2014. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to the People’s 
Republic  of  Bangladesh  for  the  Irrigation  Management Improvement  Project.  Manila,  ADB  approved  the  ongoing 
project  on  30  June  2014  for  a  $46  million  loan  from  concessional  ordinary  capital  resources,  equivalent  to  SDR 
29,551,000. The loan agreement was signed on 14 August 2014 and declared effective on 16 September 2014. The 
project  is  being  implemented  over 7.8 years  including  a 1.5-year extension approved  on 2  November  2018.  The 
physical closing date is extended to 30 June 2023 (financial closing on 31 December 2023).

under large irrigation schemes.5 However, only 46% of this area is currently irrigated during the 
dry season. 
4. 
A major weakness that continues to plague the productivity of large irrigation schemes is 
the lack of efficient and sustainable MOM. In 2012, the average level of MOM cost recovery from 
the  beneficiaries  for  three  large  scale  irrigation  projects,  MIP,  GKIP  and  TBIP,  was  24%.  The 
highest  recovery  was  for  MIP  with  63%  while  TBP  was  at  18%  and  GKIP  at  0.26%.  As  a 
consequence,  the  infrastructure  of  these  schemes  is  degraded  and  needs  rehabilitation  and 
modernization.  Other  reasons  include  inadequate  Government  financing;6  lack  of  beneficiary 
empowerment and engagement in MOM; and limited capacity of public agency resulting in weak 
service delivery. Specific issues are the: (i) inadequacy of budget7 to support system MOM; (ii) 
lack of distinction between annual, periodic or emergency maintenance of a system; and (iii) poor 
cost recovery from the water management groups.  
5. 
During the past 30 years, substantial efforts were made to improve irrigation MOM through 
introduction of participatory irrigation management (PIM). In Bangladesh, PIM proved generally 
successful on small and medium schemes, but it has yielded limited results on large schemes. 
The variable performance of PIM in improving irrigation MOM is internationally documented and 
private  sector  participation  through  public  private  partnership  (PPP)  is  seen  as  an  alternative 
approach.8  It  has  demonstrated  promising  results  in  few  developing  countries  such  as  Brazil, 
Morocco and Ethiopia but is still to be developed in Asia. In 2009, the Asian Development Bank 
(ADB)  provided  a  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  the  Bangladesh  Water  Development  Board 
(BWDB)  to  examine  alternative  approaches  of  service  delivery  agreements  and  management 
arrangements including PPP for sustainable irrigation MOM in large irrigation schemes. The TA 
proposed a conceptual framework for engaging a third-party operator to address the shortcomings 
in MOM of MIP. It established the basis for the social and economic feasibility of the approach 
and confirmed farmer’s willingness to pay. 
The National Water Policy, adopted by the government in 1999, sets out a comprehensive 
6. 
framework for the water sector in general, and for large surface water irrigation schemes including 
a strategic vision comprising private irrigation MOM through leasing, concession, or management 
contracts.  The  government  has  well  established  an  advanced  policy,  legal,  institutional,  and 
planning frameworks for the water sector in Bangladesh. These provide a suitable environment 
for driving the necessary reforms in the sector. The Water Act that was promulgated in May 2013 
further revised and consolidated existing laws that govern the ownership, utilization, and financial 
management of water. 
7. 
The  Sixth  Five  Year  Plan,  2011–2015  recognizes  the  need  to  raise  agricultural 
productivity,  foster  crop  diversification,  and  boost  public  spending  on  rural  infrastructure.9 
The Plan also presents a strategic direction for medium and large-scale surface water irrigation. 
At its highest level, the strategy focuses on modernization and improved management of existing 
irrigation  systems  and  expansion  of  the  irrigation  areas.  To  reduce  public  costs  in  sustainably 
operating these schemes and to improve delivery service, the strategy encourages use of PPP 
5   Large irrigation schemes have command areas of 2,000 hectares or more. 
6  Government of Bangladesh fund provided for maintenance only meet about 50% of requirements for the 3 schemes. 
7  For 2009–2010, budget was $126,000 against a demand of $710,000 and irrigation service charge was $12,000 
against target of $430,000. 
8   Participatory Irrigation Management (PIM) has been used as the primary method of achieving Irrigation Management 
Transfer (IMT) so the terms IMT and PIM are used interchangeably.

wherever  appropriate.  As  part  of  an  overall  investment  program  for  the  water  sector,  the 
government  has  approved  an  investment  plan  to  rehabilitate  and  modernize  all  large  surface 
water irrigation schemes at an estimated total cost of $745 million. The project will support the 
implementation of the program by modernizing the infrastructure and MOM of the MIP including 
transfer  of  the  MOM  to  private  sector.  The  project  will  also  finance  the  preparation  of  the 
modernization strategy including feasibility studies and detail designs of the GKIP and TBIP. 
8. 
The MIP construction was completed in 1986. The design enabled dry season irrigation 
as  well  as  supplemental  wet  season  irrigation  by  constructing  the  Feni  Closure  Dam  and 
Regulator to create a reservoir downstream of the confluence of the Feni, Muhuri and Kalidash-
Pahalia  rivers.  The  backwaters  from  the  barrage  enter  the  natural  channels  (khals)  and  canal 
network by gravity. From there it was to be lifted to irrigate the fields by about 800 low-lift diesel 
pumps. The project was to increase the dry season rice area from about 6,000 ha to 20,000 ha. 
Initially, farmers experienced major improvement in production and were able to cultivate much 
larger areas with rice; however, siltation of the reservoir and khals due to lack of maintenance 
and reduction of river runoff in the river has reduced the benefit over the years. The area irrigated 
in dry season shrunk to 11,300 ha. Increase in diesel cost combined with low efficiency of the 
pumps  and  decrease  in  rice  price  further  contribute  to  discourage  farmers  from  cultivating. 
Opportunities  to  substantially  increase  water  use  efficiency  and  reduce  pumping  cost  through 
innovative  design  modernization  and  improved  MOM  were  identified  during  the  project 
preparatory technical assistance and will be supported by the project. 
The project impact will be sustained high growth in irrigated agriculture. The outcome will 
9. 
be increased productivity and sustainability of MIP.10 
10. 
The project has three outputs comprising:11 
11.  Output  1:  Performance-based  irrigation  management  and  agriculture  support 
services  established.  This  output  will  include  contracting  private  irrigation  management 
operators under 5 years performance-based management contracts. This “Construction phase” 
irrigation  management  operators  (C-IMO)  will  supervise  modernization  works,  establish 
sustainable MOM and provide agricultural support services in MIP. Efficient management systems 
will be adopted to maximize water use efficiencies and develop sustainable and reliable irrigation 
service  delivery.  Viable  and  effective  operations  and  maintenance  (O&M)  cost  recovery 
mechanisms  will  be  setup  to  achieve  100  %  cost  recovery.  The  objective  will  be  to bring MIP 
scheme to the level of profitability and sustainability required for enabling the recruitment of a long 
term “management phase” irrigation management operator (M-IMO) through a PPP modality.12 
The project will also support the preparation of the long-term PPP transaction. 
12.  Output 2: Irrigation system infrastructure rehabilitated and modernized. This output 
will include physical rehabilitation and modernization of irrigation infrastructure including (i) repair 
of  about  373  km  of  canals  and  17  km  of  coastal  embankments  with  ancillary  facilities;  (ii) 
development of about 18,000 ha of modern and highly efficient piped water distribution system to 
improve  timely  water  access  and reduce  water  losses;  (iii)  provision  of  prepaid card  meters  to 
10 The updated design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. 
11 Upon approval of the additional financing loan to the project, project’s outputs will be reduced to two. Output 3 of the 
original design  and  monitoring  framework  has  been  reclassified  as Project Management Activities  in line  with  the 
Guidelines  for  Preparing  and  Using  a  Design  and  Monitoring  Framework:  Sovereign  Operations  and  Technical 
Assistance (2020) (see Section IX of the PAM).

Committee  will  have  two  permanent  agenda  items:  review  safeguard  compliance,  and  review 
project  impacts  in  terms  of  metrics  that  include  amongst  others:  poverty  and  gender.  These 
agenda  items  will  require  a  monitoring  unit  to  prepare  submissions  to  the  Project  steering 
Committee. The steering committee will meet at least twice per year.

Project Organization Structure  
19. 
The  Executing  Agency  is  BWDB.  A  Project  Director,  with  the  rank  of  at  least 
superintending engineer, will be appointed for the duration of the project. The Project Director will 
be  responsible  for  the  overall  management  of  the  project  and  will  manage  the  Project 
Management  Unit  and  authorize  payments.  He  or  she  will  report  directly  to  BWDB  additional 
Director General Planning. 
The  Project  Director  will  be  supported  by  the  IMIP  support  services  based  on  seven 
20. 
support units: accounts, administration, procurement, PPP, Planning and Design, Safeguards and 
Communications and Strategy Building. The core of the project management will be managed by 
the Dhaka central office however supported by frequent field visits to engage with the field staff 
as  well  as  stakeholders.  All  procurement,  payments  as  well  as  planning  and  design  will  be 
managed by the support units based in Dhaka. 
21. 
A Project implementation unit (PIU) will be established in MIP. A PIU Director with the rank 
of  Executing  Engineer  will  be  appointed.  He  or  she  will  be  in  charge  of  supervising  MIP 
modernization in the field including the activities currently managed by the Government as well 
as the investments and OM activities of the project. The PIU Director will be based in the field but 
will  make  frequent  visits  to  the  PMU  in  Dhaka.  The  PIU  would  incorporate  the  staff  of  the 
superintending  engineer's  office  in  Muhuri.  Thirty  staff  would  be  formally  assigned  to  the  PIU 
under  the  PIU  director. For  the  Teesta Barrage and  the GK  irrigation  projects,  a small  Design 
Support Unit will be set up under the direction of an Executive Engineer Design to be based at 
each project site. Coordination and support will be provided by the Project Directors of the two 
projects on a part time basis.  
22. 
The development of capacity in the management of PPP is a key requirement. A PPP unit 
will be established to support the IMIP Project Director, the unit will comprise of one person from 
Government with appropriate knowledge in tendering, contract management, negotiating, legal, 
and communication and preferably private public partnerships. The unit will work closely with the 
procurement unit and will be responsible for tender documents and will be active in the bidding 
process during the engagement of the IMOs. The unit will also be a party to the PPP contract 
negotiations between the Project management phase IMO (M-IMO) and construction phase and 
management  phase  IMOs  of  GKIP  and  TBP  and  BWDB  and  will,  in  the  longer  term,  be 
responsible  for  monitoring  and  managing  the  PPP  contract.  The  PPP  unit  will  participate  and 
support  the  Implementation  Coordination  Committee  in  C-IMO  and  M-IMO  performance 
evaluation  and review  and will  maintain linkages  to the  PPP  Office  under  the  Prime  Minister's 
Office. It is expected that PPP Office in the Prime Minister's office will be able to provide specialist 
PPP support as and when requested by BWDB. BWDB will consult with the PPP  Office in the 
prime minister's office and prepare a MOU to identify and implement appropriate support actions. 
Support to establish and develop the PPP unit will be provided by the PMDC. 
23. 
Positions outside the PMU: As the PPP lease contract will continue after the completion 
of the IMIP project it will be necessary to appoint a PPP officer outside the PMU and under the 
procurement cell funded from the establishment budget. The PPP officer will be appointed one 
years prior to the start of the Muhuri lease contract. A monitoring cell will be established to provide 
independent verification of the performance of various stakeholders as well as assessing impacts 
associated  with  investment  objectives.  There  is  an  existing  monitoring  division  within  BWDB 
under the Chief Monitoring who reports to BWDB's Director General.  The IMIP monitoring cell 
will be situated under the Chief Monitoring. The monitoring cell will monitor the project progress 
against the outputs and targets set out in the Design and Monitoring Framework (DMF). 
11 
The  staff  for  the  PMU  will  be  assigned  on  deputation  or  given  additional  charge  from 
24. 
BWDB or other Government Departments. If staff are not available from the Government, they 
will  be  recruited from the private  sector for the period  of  the  project.  The  PMU  staffing  as  of  1 
November 2020 is shown in the table below.13

Implementation  Coordination  Committee.  To  facilitate  implementation  of  the  MIP 
modernization, an Implementation Coordination Committee (ICC) will be established. The ICC will 
be  under  the  leadership  of  the  BWDB  Zonal  Chief  Engineer.  Members  of  the  ICC  will  include 
representatives from the offices of the Deputy Commissioner, the Water Users Federation, Water 
13 
User Associations, the Rural Electrification Board, Department of Agriculture Extension, and law 
enforcement. The IMO will also be a member of the ICC and will act as the member secretary. 
The  ICC  will  deal  with  field  implementation  issues  that  arise  related  to  conflicts,  safeguards, 
security, and more generally concerns about the performance of the implementing parties and 
will meet four times per year at a location close to MIP. The PMU with the support of the PMDC 
will be responsible for the establishment of the ICC. 
26. 
The  Water  Management  Organizations  (WMOs),  WUG,  WMA,  and  WMF  will  play  a 
supporting and guiding role in close coordination with the ICC. The role of the WMOs will include; 
(i) to support feedback and monitoring  of the operation and management of the projects through 
the ICC; (ii) liaising with farmers and the ICC; (iii) implementing independent monitoring function 
of the management activities including construction, operation and physical maintenance work; 
and (iv) supporting and dealing with the complaints and grievances in coordination with ICC; more 
serious  complaints  would  be  referred  to  the  ICC  who  would  meet  every  3  months;  additional 
special meetings can be organized as necessary. 
Independent Panel of Experts (PoE). An independent panel of experts will be recruited 
27. 
and engaged by ADB,14 to (a) review the performance of the C-IMO thus far and assess whether 
the  Project  is  ready  to  have  its  long-term  MOM  transferred  to  the  M-IMO  in  accordance  with 
paragraph  9,  Schedule  4  of  the  ongoing  loan’s  Project  Agreement;  and–if  not–  (b)  advise  on 
measures to remedy the deficiencies in the proposed plan or propose alternative approaches to 
ensure that the sustainable development objectives envisaged under the Project are achieved. 
BWDB  shall  assist  the PoE  by providing  any  data  and support  that  the  panel  may reasonably 
require.  BWDB  shall  endorse  the  conclusions  and  recommendations  issued  by  the  panel  and 
commit to their effective implementation. 
28. 
If the independent PoE recommends that the long-term MOM of all or part of the project 
facilities  be  transferred  to  an  M-IMO  upon  expiry  of  the  management  contract  of  the  C-IMO, 
BWDB shall transfer the responsibility for such MOM activities to the M-IMO pursuant to a long-
term  lease,  concession  or  other  PPP  modality  in  a  manner  that  (a)  allocates  risks  and 
responsibilities  among  the  stakeholders  in  accordance  with  sound  international  practice;  (b) 
includes a transparent, objective and comprehensive water service tariff regulation mechanism 
that is aimed at cost recovery and provides for a reasonable return on equity for the M-IMO; and 
(c)  provides  the  M-IMO  with  the  operational  autonomy  to  effectively  manage  its  operations,  to 
meet the requirements for operation and maintenance cost recovery and preserve its business 
interests, through collection of water service charges or other cost recovery/income generating 
activities. 
14 BWDB shall review the short-list of candidates and send its concurrence to ADB on a non-objection basis.

COSTS AND FINANCING 
29. 
The  cost  of  the  project  is  at  $68.1  million,  inclusive  of  taxes  and  duties,  and  financing 
charges during implementation (Table 4 ). Financing for the overall project will come from an ADB 
loan,  government  contribution,  and  farmer  contribution  (Table  4).  Farmers  in  the  project  will 
contribute $4.4 million for the operation and maintenance (O&M) cost of level 2 and 3 irrigation 
infrastructure and equipment; this farmers’ contribution will be paid via a levy issued by the M-
IMO. Farmers’ contributions will include an upfront payment towards the OM to not exceed $0.15 
million, which is equivalent to $9/ha. Farmers’ contribution of $4.4 million is designed to develop 
a  sense  of  ownership  by  farmers  of  the  pipeline  distribution  systems.  The  government  will 
contribute $8.7 million; this includes payment to BWDB for the rehabilitation and O&M of MIP level 
1 irrigation infrastructure. Both ADB loans will have a term of 25 years, including a grace period 
of  5  years,  with  an  interest  rate  of  2%  throughout  the  loan  period,  and  such  other  terms  and 
conditions set forth in the loan and project agreements.

A. 
Cost Estimates Preparation and Revisions 
30. 
For  the  additional  financing,  estimates  for  the  extension  of  costs  for  the  construction 
contracts, and for the extension of costs for the C-IMO were prepared by BWDB and reviewed by 
ADB.  Cost  estimates  for  financing  charges  during  implementation  were  prepared  by  ADB  in 
consultation  with  BWDB.  The  cost  estimate  model  was  prepared  using  Microsoft  Excel.  It  is 
available  with  the  ADB  project  team  and  the  PMU.  During  implementation,  the  PMU  will  be 
responsible  for  updating  cost  estimates  from  the  model.  Revisions  to  planned  withdrawal 
allocations will require prior approval from ADB.

FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT  
A. 
Financial Management Assessment 
The financial management assessment (FMA) was conducted in June-November 2020, in 
32. 
accordance with ADB’s Guidelines.15 The purpose of the FMA is to ensure that adequate financial 
management  arrangements  are  in  place  for  the  project.  The  FMA  considered  the  financial 
management  capacity  of  the  BWDB  including  funds-flow  arrangements,  governance,  staffing, 
budgeting,  accounting  and  financial  reporting  systems,  internal  control  procedures,  financial 
information  systems,  and  internal  and  external  auditing  arrangements.  In  addition,  the  FMA 
reviewed the financial management performance of the ongoing project.  
The FMA found that BWDB has adequate financial management capacity to: (i) record the 
33. 
required financial transactions, (ii) provide reliable annual financial statements and audit reports 
in a timely manner, (iii) safeguard the financial assets and (iv) manage the advance fund and the 
statement of expenditure (SOE) procedures. As part of the ongoing project, all audited project 
financial  statements  (APFS)  have  been  unqualified  and  submitted  to  ADB  in  a  timely  manner. 
However, the assessed pre-mitigation financial management risk is substantial mainly because 
of the following: (i) BWDB’s internal audit function may not have the capacity to audit the project 
regularly, (ii) there is scope for improving project level financial reporting, and (iii) receipts and 
payments under the ABD financing are captured using manual accounting systems. 
34. 
These risks will be mitigated by the following: (i) providing continuous training in ADB’s 
financial reporting and audit requirements, (ii) requiring more comprehensive financial information 
to  be  submitted  as  part  of  quarterly  progress  reports,  (iii)  including  detailed  instructions  and 
reporting  templates  in  the  PAM,  and  iv)  adopting  an  accounting  software  at  the  PMU  level  to 
record receipts and payments under ADB financing. Moreover, as per the established practice, 
BWDB, through its PMU, will maintain separate books of account for the project in accordance 
with accounting standards acceptable to ADB and the project financial statement will be audited 
annually by an independent auditor acceptable to ADB in accordance with International Standards 
on Auditing. The detailed financial management risks and mitigations measures are provided in

Disbursement arrangements 
1. 
Disbursement Arrangements for ADB Funds 
The ADB original loan and additional loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with 
36. 
ADB’s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time),16  and  detailed 
arrangements agreed upon between the government and ADB. The PMU will be responsible for 
(i)  collecting  and  retaining  supporting  documents,  and  (ii)  preparing  and  sending  withdrawal 
applications to ADB. Online training for project staff on disbursement policies and procedures is 
available. PMU staff are encouraged to avail of this training to help ensure efficient disbursement 
and fiduciary control.  
ADB’s  disbursement  procedures  including  direct payment, reimbursement,  commitment

and/or advance fund procedure) may be used for withdrawal of project funds: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
Direct  payment  procedure  will  be  used  for  foreign  currency  payments  to 
contractors, suppliers and consultants; 
Reimbursement  will  be  used  for  any  eligible  payments  pre-financed  by  the 
government, including all expenditures financed under retroactive financing; 
Advance fund (liquidation or replenishment) procedures will be mainly utilized for 
payments  to  contractors,  suppliers,  or  service  providers  when  government  pre-
financing is not feasible; and  
Under  the  commitment  procedure,  ADB,  at  the  borrower's  request,  provides  an 
irrevocable undertaking to reimburse a commercial bank for payments made or to 
be made to a supplier against a letter of credit financed from the loan account. 
38. 
Advance fund procedure.  Two separate  advance  accounts  are to be  established and 
maintained by BWDB with the Bangladesh Bank for the ADB original loan and the ADB additional 
financing loan. The currency of the advance accounts is the United States dollar. In addition, two 
sub-accounts,  one  for  the  ADB  original  loan  and  one  for  the  ADB  additional  financing  loan,  in 
Bangladesh  Taka  will  be  established  in  a  commercial  bank  and  maintained  by  BWDB.  The 
advance accounts and the sub-accounts are to be used exclusively for ADB’s share of eligible 
expenditures. BWDB is accountable and responsible for proper use of advances to the advance 
accounts including advances to any sub-accounts. 
39. 
The total outstanding advance to the advance accounts should not exceed the estimate 
of  ADB’s  share of  expenditures to  be  paid through the  advance  account for  the  forthcoming 6 
months. BWDB may request for initial and additional advances to the advance account based on 
an estimate of expenditure sheet17 setting out the estimated expenditures to be financed through 
the accounts for the forthcoming 6 months. Supporting documents should be submitted to ADB 
or  retained  by  BWDB  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2017,  as 
amended from time to time) when liquidating or replenishing the advance account. 
Statement  of  expenditure  (SOE)  procedure.18  The  SOE  procedure  may  be  used  for

31 
ceiling  of  the  SOE  procedure  is  equivalent  to  $100,000  per  individual  payment.  Supporting 
documents and records for the expenditures claimed under SOE should be maintained and made 
readily available for review by ADB's disbursement and review missions, upon ADB's request for 
submission  of  supporting  documents  on  a  sampling  basis,  and  for  independent  audit. 
Reimbursement and liquidation for individual payments in excess of the SOE ceiling should be 
supported by full documentation when submitting the withdrawal application to ADB. 
41. 
Before the submission of the first withdrawal application, the borrower should submit to 
ADB sufficient evidence of the authority of the persons who will sign the withdrawal applications 
on behalf of the borrower, together with the authenticated specimen signatures of each authorized 
person.  The  minimum  value  per  withdrawal  application  is  stipulated  in  the  ADB’s  Loan 
Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time). Individual payments should be 
paid (i) by BWDB and subsequently claimed to ADB through reimbursement, or (ii) through the 
advance  fund  procedure,  unless  otherwise  accepted  by  ADB.  The  borrower  should  ensure 
sufficient category and contract balances before requesting disbursements. Use of ADB’s Client 
Portal for Disbursements (CPD) system19 is mandatory for submission of withdrawal applications 
to ADB. 
2. 
Disbursement Arrangements for Counterpart Funds 
The  government  counterpart  funds  will  be  sufficiently  allocated  in  the  budget  annually.  
42. 
BWDB  will  be  responsible  for  preparing  the  budget  and  requesting  budgetary  allocations  for 
counterpart funds to the Ministry of Finance.  The government will provide counterpart fund as 
well as ADB’s reimbursable fund to the project as per financing and disbursement percentage. All 
disbursements under government financing will be carried out in accordance with regulations of 
Government  of  Bangladesh.  BWDB  shall  open  and  maintain  the  separate  account  for 
government’s counterpart funds. 
For the disbursement of fund from the government, the MOWR will send the fund release 
43. 
proposal received from BWDB to the Finance Division of MOF for their concurrence before fund 
is  ultimately  deposited  into  a  Central  Account  of  the  BWDB.  For  the  project,  the  regional 
accounting center  office will  be  established  in the PMU  and  all  payment issued from the  PMU 
RAC regional accounting center office. 
44. 
To ensure sufficient knowledge in ADB’s  financial management requirements, including 
procedures and related systems, BWDB will ensure that each PMU financial and accounts staff 
assigned to the project undertake the following actions within the first three months working with 
the project: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
Become aware of the ADB and national anticorruption policy and whistle blowing 
mechanisms; 
Master  loan/grant  agreement  including  the  loan  covenants  and  the  relevant 
sections  of  the  Project  Administration  Manual,  as  well  as  the  ADB  loan 
disbursement handbook; and 
Obtain user/reader rights (as required) to ADBs systems including: CPD and the 
Loans and Grants information Service (LFIS).   
19 The CPD facilitates online submission of withdrawal applications to ADB, resulting in faster disbursement. The forms 
to be completed by the Borrower are available online at https://www.adb.org/documents/client-portal-disbursements-
guide. 
32 
In addition, the PMU should on a yearly basis liaise with ADB to take advantage of other 
45. 
financial management resources and training events organized by ADB, especially in the first 2 
years of project implementation.20 
C. 
Accounting 
46. 
BWDB  through  its  PMU  will  maintain,  or  cause  to  be  maintained,  separate  books  and 
records by funding source (ADB original loan, ADB additional loan, the government, etc) for all 
expenditures incurred on the project in accordance with International Public Sector Accounting 
Standards–  cash  basis  of  accounting  or  national  equivalents  prescribed  by  the  Government’s 
accounting  laws  and regulations.  Consolidated  project  financial statements  (of the original loan 
and additional financing) will be prepared in accordance with government's accounting laws and 
regulations  which  are  consistent  with  international  accounting  principles  and  practices: 
Accordingly, the consolidated project financial statement will include at least the following:

progress. The variance analysis will pay particular attention to: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
significant deviations from the budgeted engineer’s estimates; 
Significant deviations between financial and physical progress;  
Significant delays on (planned vs. reported) physical and/or financial progress, and 
Inconsistent and/or delayed progress reporting. 
Any significant variances, delays or deviations etc. shall be promptly followed-up on and 
53. 
explained in the financial reports. 
34 
Periodic Reconciliations. To ensure the correctness and completeness of the project’s 
54. 
books of accounts and financial reports, BWDB through its PMU shall conduct:  
(i) 
(ii) 
Monthly reconciliations of the advance account, its subaccount as well as district 
subaccounts; and,  
Quarterly reconciliation of the project book of accounts, and ADB’s disbursement 
data available in Loan Financial Information Services (LFIS) - website.   
Any discrepancies and/or reconciliation items will be followed up on to ensure these are 
55. 
resolved in a prompt manner and that there are no misstatements in the financial reports. The 
differences between amounts claimed and the amounts disbursed will be disclosed and explained 
in the WA register to be included in the financial reports.  
D. 
Auditing and Public Disclosure 
56. 
BWDB will cause the consolidated project financial statements, including the original loan 
and the additional loan, to be audited in accordance with International Standards on Auditing by 
an independent auditor acceptable to ADB.21 The audited project financial statements together 
with the auditor’s opinion will be presented in the English language to ADB within 6 months from 
the end of the fiscal year by BWDB. BWDB through its PMU will ensure that total amount in APFS 
will reconcile with amounts disbursed by ADB during the respective fiscal year. 
57. 
The audit report for the project financial statements will include a management letter and 
auditor’s opinions, which cover (i) whether the project financial statements present an accurate 
and fair view or are presented fairly, in all material respects, in accordance with the applicable 
financial  reporting  standards;  and (ii)  whether  the proceeds  of the  loan were  used  only for the 
purpose  of  the  project.  The  management  letter  will  include  from  the  second  year  onwards,  a 
follow-up on previous years audit observations. In case the auditor does not issue a management 
letter, the auditor must issue a written confirmation that no internal control issues were identified 
as part of the audit. 
58. 
Compliance with financial reporting and auditing requirements will be monitored by review 
missions and during normal program supervision, and followed up regularly with all concerned, 
including the external auditor. 
59. 
The  government  and  BWDB  have  been  made  aware  of  ADB’s  approach  to  delayed 
submission, and the requirements for satisfactory and acceptable quality of the audited project 
financial  statements.22  ADB  reserves  the right to  require a  change in the auditor  (in a manner 
21 It is expected that the project financial statement will be audited by Foreign Aided Projects Audit Directorate (FAPAD) 
under the Comptroller and Auditor General of Bangladesh. 
22 ADB’s approach and procedures regarding delayed submission of audited project financial statements:  
(i)  When audited  project  financial  statements  are  not  received by  the due date,  ADB  will  write  to the  executing 
agency advising that (a) the audit documents are overdue; and (b) if they are not received within the next 6 
months, requests for new contract awards and disbursement such as new replenishment of advance accounts, 
processing of new reimbursement, and issuance of new commitment letters will not be processed. 
(ii)  When audited project financial statements are not received within 6 months after the due date, ADB will withhold 
processing  of  requests  for  new  contract  awards  and  disbursement  such  as  new  replenishment  of  advance 
accounts, processing of new reimbursement, and issuance of new commitment letters. ADB will (a) inform the 
executing agency of ADB’s actions; and (b) advise that the loan may be suspended if the audit documents are 
not received within the next 6 months. 
(iii)  When  audited  project  financial  statements  are  not  received  within  12  months  after  the  due  date,  ADB  may 
suspend the loan. 
35 
consistent with the constitution of the borrower), or for additional support to be provided to the 
auditor, if the audits required are not conducted in a manner satisfactory to ADB, or if the audits 
are  substantially  delayed.  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  verify  the  project's  financial  accounts  to 
confirm  that  the  share  of  ADB’s  financing  is  used  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  policies  and 
procedures. 
60. 
Public  disclosure  of  APFS,  including  the  auditor’s  opinion  on  the  project  financial 
statements, will be guided by ADB’s Access to Information Policy 2018.23 After the review, ADB 
will disclose APFS and the opinion of the auditors on the project financial statements no later than 
14  days  of  ADB’s  confirmation  of  their  acceptability  by  posting  them  on  ADB’s  website.  The 
management letter, additional auditor’s opinions, and audited entity financial statements will not 
be disclosed. 
61. 
A formal request for the project to be included in the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor 
General (OCAG) and Foreign-Aided Project Audit Directorate (FAPAD) audit schedule should be 
sent through the ERD to OCAG/FAPAD office. This request is best sent when the loan and project 
agreements  are  signed,  and  the  request  should  include  a  copy  of  the  loan  and  project 
agreements,  and  any  other  relevant  documents.  OCAG/FAPAD  would  then  advise  the 
appropriate field office to include the project in its audit schedule. 
In addition, to ensure that audited financial statements are submitted on a timely basis, 
62. 
BWDB through the PMU should submit its project financial statements for audit to OCAG/FAPAD 
within  3 months  from  the  close  of  the  financial  year.  PMU  shall  be  responsible  for  the  Project 
financial statements. By 1st of October of each year, OCAG/FAPAD should receive the unaudited 
financial statements. It will then take 3 months to complete the audit and issue an opinion no later 
than  6  months  from  the  end  of  the  financial  year.  A  statement  of  audit  needs  is  provided  in 
Appendix 4. 
E. 
Loan Closure  
In  order  ensure  a  timely  closure  of  the  ADB  loan  accounts  and  to  comply  with  ADBs 
63. 
requirements, BWDB will through its PMU ensure that the following measures are undertaken: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
(v) 
(vi) 
All ADB financed expenditures are incurred before or by the loan closing date; 
All  withdrawal  applications  including  liquidations  of  the  advance  account  are 
submitted to ADB preferably by the loan closing date but in no case later the end 
of the winding up period; that is, within four months after the end of the loan closing 
date; 
Any unutilized advances are refunded to ADB within two months after the end of 
the winding up period;  
The final project financial statements (PFS) are prepared in a timely manner. The 
final  PFS  is  to  include  a  reconciliation  of  the  project  account  and  the  ADB 
disbursement  records  for  the  fiscal  year  and  cumulatively  from  inception.  Any 
differences must be disclosed and explained; 
All past external audit observations have been duly addressed; 
The  final  project  financial  statements  are  audited  by  independent  auditors  as 
agreed with  ADB  and  the  Audited  Project  Financial  Statements  (APFS) and the 
management letter are submitted to ADB as soon as possible after the loan closing

VI. 
PROCUREMENT AND CONSULTING SERVICES 
A. 
Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing 
All  advance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  will  be  undertaken  in  conformity  with 
64. 
ADB’s  Procurement  Guidelines  (February  2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  (ADB’s 
Procurement Guidelines) and ADB’s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended 
from time to time).24 The issuance of invitations to bid under advance contracting and retroactive 
financing will be subject to ADB approval. The borrower and the BWDB have been advised that 
approval of advance contracting and retroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance the 
Project. 
Except  as  otherwise  agreed  with  ADB,  the  expenditures  incurred  for  equipment,  civil 
65. 
works, and consulting services will be eligible for retroactive financing, provided that these are 
incurred before the effectiveness of the related loan agreement, but not earlier than 12 months 
preceding the signing of the related loan agreement, and as long as they do not exceed an amount 
of 20% of the individual loan.  
66. 
The additional financing will not use advance contracting and retroactive financing. 
B. 
Procurement of Goods, Works, and Consulting Services 
67. 
A procurement capacity assessment was undertaken by the PPTA procurement experts 
in  mid-2013  for  BWDB  and  concluded  that  BWDB  had  already  substantial  experience  with 
external aided project procurement including with ADB. However recommendations were made 
to  enhance  BWDB  staff  and  private  sector  staff  capacity  including  training  on  (i)  civil  works 
technical  specification  and  consultant  TORs  preparation,  (ii)  tender  proceedings  including 
development  of  procurement  plan  up  to  evaluation  and  approval  processes,  (iii)  contract 
administration  and  management  particularly  focusing  on  contract  variations  and  settlement  of 
claims  and  disputes,  adjudication  and  arbitration,  (iv)  private  sector  skill  development  on  bid 
submissions, understanding of contract conditions. In addition, recommendations were made to 
strengthen  the  existing  BWDB  procurement  unit  and  ensure  it  is  supported  by  adequate  staff 
number and regular training budget. 
All  procurement  of  goods  and  works  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB’s 
68. 
Procurement Guidelines. 
In the ongoing project, procurement packages for civil works were split into nine packages. 
69. 
All the procurement for works packages were ICB. 
In the additional financing, no procurement is required. The additional financing will extend 
70. 
the existing civil works contracts and the existing consulting services C-IMO. 
All consultants were recruited according to ADB’s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. 
71. 
There are two consultancy packages under the ongoing Project.

C. 
Procurement Plan 
The  updated  procurement  plan  for  the  overall  project  (ongoing  loan  and  additional 
72. 
financing) is in Appendix 2 and has been prepared based on the ADB generic templates.  
D.  
Consultant's Terms of Reference 
Detailed Terms of Reference for the project’s two consultancy packages are in APPENDIX 
73. 
3. These two consultancy packages have already been awarded. 
74. 
Project  Management,  Planning  and  Design:  A  Project  Management  and  Design 
Consultant (PMDC) is engaged to support the PMU. The PMDC will support the PMU in a range 
of tasks including: 
(i) 
(ii) 
Designing and supporting the procurement of the MIP civil works not included in 
the advance packages. 
Preparing feasibility studies, designs, and the bid documents for GKIP and TBIP 
modernization. 
Support and supervise the Irrigation Management Operator, 
(iii) 
(iv)  Monitoring construction and related activities (construction supervision would be

Designing  and  conducting  training  related  to  managing  PPP  contracts,  project 
management, and other technical areas as required. 
Preparing  a  review  of  the  progress  of  the  Muhuri  C-IMO  and  support  the 
preparation  of  bidding  documents  for  the  2nd  stage  lease  contract  MOM  for 
Muhuri. 
75.  Muhuri Irrigation Management Operator. A “construction phase” Irrigation Management 
Operator (C-IMO) is engaged by MIP; this will be the Muhuri Irrigation Management Operator. 
76. 
The IMO will be located and operate within or near their project areas. The role of the IMO 
will be to develop and implement MOM of the completed works after completion of modernization 
and rehabilitation. During the development stage the C-IMO will also implement field level design 
of  the  piped  irrigation  systems  and  upgrading  of  electricity  as  well  as  being  responsible  for 
construction  supervision  of  the  investment  works.  It  is  envisaged  that  the  IMO  would  seek  to 
engage  some  BWDB  technical  staff  with  interest  and  appropriate  qualifications  and  skills  to 
continue  to  work  within the  respective  systems.  For  the  system  modernization  stage,  which  is 
proposed  to  have  5-year  duration,  the  C-IMO  would  be  contracted  through  a  management 
contract by the PMU. During this period, the C- IMO will:

SAFEGUARDS 
77. 
Environment.  An  Initial  Environment  Examination  (IEE)  was  prepared  for  the  ongoing 
project and includes an Environmental Management Plan which describes mitigation measures 
to be adopted during design, construction, and operation of MIP. PIU will update the IEE including 
the  Environmental  Management  Plan  (EMP)  to  include  the  substation  to  comply  with  the 
Environmental  Conservation  Act  1995  and  ADB  SPS  2009  and  disclose  them  on  BWDB’s 
website. 
78. 
Involuntary Resettlement. The ongoing project has identified some resettlement impacts 
that  have  minimal  livelihood  implications.  Any  resettlement  impacts  will  be  mitigated  through 
resettlement plan preparation and implementation in accordance with  the SPS and the agreed 
resettlement framework for the project. The resettlement plan will be reviewed and disclosed by 
PMU and ADB. No civil works resulting in involuntary resettlement impacts will commence prior 
to implementation of the resettlement plan.  
Indigenous Peoples. There are no indigenous peoples within the meaning of ADB SPS 
79. 
in the project areas, as such there are no indigenous peoples impacts foreseen to be addressed 
during the overall project implementation. 
Institutional  Arrangements.  A  safeguards  cell  will  be  established  in  the  PMU.  The 
80. 
safeguards cell will be responsible to oversee overall monitoring and verification of environment 
and resettlement activities of the IMIP. Three counterpart personnel with relevant experience will 
be assigned to the safeguards cell as the environmental, social safeguard and gender focal which 
will  have  responsibility  for  ensuring  compliance  of  the  safeguards  requirements  including  (i) 
environment, (ii) resettlement and (iii) gender. 
81. 
The MIP PIU Director will assume primary responsibility for the safeguards assessments 
as well as implementation of RP and EMP for their respective components. Two safeguards focal 
officers will be assigned to the project team under the PIU Director for environment and social 
safeguards, respectively. The duties of the safeguards focal officers will include: (i) oversight of 
construction contractors for monitoring and implementing mitigation measures; (ii) preparing and 
implementing environment policy guidelines and environmental good practices; (iii)  preparation 
and implementation of resettlement plan; (iv) ensure consultation, grievance redress and other 
mitigation measures are implemented according to the guideline of Resettlement Framework; (v) 
liaising with the environmental agencies and seeking their help to solve the environment-related 
issues of project implementation; (vi) providing awareness training on environmental and social 
issues  related  to  irrigation  modernization  under  the  IMIP;  (vii)  preparation  of  environmental 
monitoring  reports  once a year  for  the  IEE  and (viii)  semi-annual social monitoring  reports  (as 
required by ADB). 
82. 
In addition, the safeguards focal officers with assistance from the safeguards consultants 
engaged by the PMDC will: (ii) update the environmental assessment and prepare site-specific 
EMP based on detailed designs; (iii) ensure the EMP is included in bidding documents and civil 
works contracts; (iv) provide oversight on environmental management aspects of the project and 
ensure  EMPs  are  implemented  by  the  contractors;  (v)  assess  social  safeguards  impacts 
according to final design and updated documentation, resettlement plan and mitigation measures 
as required; (vi) facilitate and ensure contractors comply with all government rules and regulations 
regarding permits as well as any other  relevant approvals required for works; (vii) supervise and 
provide guidance to the contractors to properly carry out implementation occupation health and 
safety,  and  COVID-19  health  and  safety  plan;  (viii)  conduct  site  visits,  review,  monitor  and 
40 
evaluate  the  effectiveness  with  which  the  EMP  and  RP  are  implemented,  and  recommend 
necessary  corrective  actions  to  be  taken  as  necessary;  (ix)  review  and  consolidate  periodic 
environmental  monitoring  reports  submit  by 
the  contractor,  (x)  prepare  semi-annual 
environmental Monitoring Report (EMR) and Social Monitoring Report (SMR) and submit to ADB; 
(xi) ensure timely disclosure of final safeguards assessments in locations and forms accessible 
to the public; (xii) take corrective actions when necessary to ensure no environmental or social 
safeguards impacts; (xiii) facilitate in conducting ongoing consultation with the community during 
implementation  of  the  project;  and  (xiv)  conduct  environmental  safeguard  training  program  for 
PIU  and  BWDB  officials,  and  (xv)  establish  a  grievance  redress  mechanism  and  ensure  it  is 
operated satisfactorily.  
83. 
The C-IMO will be responsible to monitor and supervise implementation of EMP on works 
contracts in the irrigation systems managed by the C-IMO. During operations of these schemes 
the C-IMO will be responsible to implement any activities identified in the EMP.  
84. 
Consultation  and  Grievance  Redress  Mechanism.  Meaningful  consultation  will  be 
conducted  with  affected  persons,  host  communities,  and  other  stakeholders  in  areas  with 
involuntary  resettlement  impacts.  Such  consultation  is  an  ongoing  process,  providing  timely 
disclosure  of  relevant  information  in  a  language  understandable  to  the  affected  persons, 
undertaken free of intimidation, responsive and incorporates relevant views of affected persons 
into  decision  making.  A  grievance  redress  mechanism,  which  is  transparent,  understandable, 
responsive, and readily accessible, will be established to receive and facilitate the resolution of 
the affected persons concerns and grievances about physical and economic displacement and 
other  project  impacts,  particularly  on  vulnerable  groups.  The  grievance  redress  mechanism 
should not impede access to the country’s judicial and administrative remedies.  
85. 
Prohibited investment activities: Pursuant to the SPS, ADB funds may not be applied 
to the activities described on the ADB Prohibited Investment Activities List set forth at Appendix 
5 of the SPS. 
41 
VIII.  GENDER AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS 
86. 
The  Project  has  been  categorized  as  a  gender  mainstreamed  project  (effective  gender 
mainstreaming). The project components have been designed to ensure involvement and benefits 
for women as well as reduction of gender inequality. A Gender Action Plan (GAP) as described 
below has been prepared integrating action areas, targets and indicators for gender equality and 
women’s benefits within the various components of the project. There are quotas for women’s 
participation  in  consultation  and  trainings  as  well  as  acting  as  pump  operators  and  water  unit 
vendors in the project areas. Given the ground reality, where the local women in the area strictly 
observe  “purdah”  which  does  not  allow  them  to  work  outside  their  home  especially  with  men 
outside the family.  Any social interactions with men are even more challenging. Most of the GAP 
activities such as working as pump operators, water unit vendor and daily laborers require working 
outside  the  home  with  men  who  are  nor  family  members.  Especially  the  pumps  are  mostly 
installed  in  the  distant  areas  from  villages/localities  and  are  operated  during  the  night.  Thus, 
despite  many  consultations  and  meetings  with  families  and  the  community,  to  encourage 
women’s participation in project activities, the current project could not achieve the targets of 30% 
women’s participation in the design of agriculture support services and cost recovery activities, 
10% women as pump operators, selection of 20% women as water unit vendors and 5% women’s 
involvement  in  unskilled  works,  and  at  least  30%  women’s  membership  in  labor  contracting 
society and 30% work allocation for women groups. Therefore, the targets have been reduced to 
10% women’s participation, 2% women pump operators and 5% women as water unit vendors, 
respectively. Similarly, labor contracting society work provision and the target of inclusion of 20% 
poor and socially excluded groups in the labouring works have been dropped from the GAP and 
the DMF, respectively. A gender consultant was recruited during feasibility studies preparation of 
GKIP and TBIP and ensured women’s active participation in consultation. A focal point on gender 
and development is deployed in the PMU and one IMO staff engaged to support implementation, 
monitoring  and  regular  reporting  of  GAP.  All  relevant  staff  will  be  sensitized  on  gender  and 
development  and  GAP  implementation  to  build  institutional  capacity  of  BWDB  on  gender  and 
social development. The PMU will ensure establishing the MIS system with sex-disaggregated 
data collection, gender-based analysis, and review and reporting on the implementation of the 
GAP  within  all  reports  including  the  project  quarterly  progress  report  (QPR).  The  GAP 
implementation,  including  the  challenges  encountered  during  project’s  implementation,  will  be 
evaluated at project completion. 
87. 
A separate Stakeholder Consultation Strategy has been prepared for the project to provide 
methodology and processes for continued consultations with various stakeholders particularly the 
poor and vulnerable groups during project implementation. Local communities will be involved in 
consultations  for  project  planning,  implementation  and  for  any  safeguard  issues  with  special 
attention given to include the poor and female headed households. Orientation on STI including 
HIV  and  other  safety  measures  will  be  provided  to  the  contractors  and  laborers  in  package 
training.  
88. 
BWDB will ensure implementation of the GAP and Stakeholder Consultation Strategy and 
will be supported by the PMU and the PIU team. The deployed staff from PMU assigned as the 
gender  focal  will  provide  support  in  monitoring  and  reporting  on  gender  and  social  aspects  in 
close coordination with the PMU and the PIUs. Adequate budget is allocated to implement these 
strategies.  
The  project  in  its  broad-based  objectives  will  address  gender  issues  in  the  following

Note: For indicators linked to the project’s design and monitoring framework, please refer to Appendix 1 of the PAM to 
see the indicator baseline at start of project (2013). 
a Technology substitution and socioeconomic and cultural conditions in the project area with male-out migration to the 
Middle East and women’s unwillingness to avail of the unskilled labor opportunities provided in the Project led the EA 
to request a revision of selected gender-related indicators/targets.  The ADB appreciates the strong rationale for this 
request and confirms this is not a reflection of the agency’s lack of commitment but its inability to deliver, based on 
the rationale provided. 
b The proxy baseline is 15.16%, as obtained from the Statistical Yearbook of Bangladesh  -2010 (the last published 
one), published by the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics on the work force participation rate of females in Feni district. 
Besides, most households in the project area have men living in the Middle East working as migrant workers. This 
indicates that the households are relatively well off and given the prevailing conservative culture, women are neither 
interested nor encouraged to work outside their homes. 
c Other livelihood skills include, but are not limited to, duck rearing, poultry, fish cultivation, homestead gardening etc.   
d The project area of greater Noakhali, including Feni District, is a culturally conservative area with strict religious values 
and  practices.  As  such,  women’s  active  participation  in  the  project  was  discouraged  and  often  prohibited  by  their 
families and communities. The women in the area strictly observe purdah, which does not allow them to work outside 
their  home,  especially  with  men  outside  the  family.  This  reality  and  the  challenges  it  caused  to  implementation  is 
recorded in the aide memoire of the May 2017 and January 2018 project review missions. To respond to this reality, 
some indicators related to labor and hiring were reduced in the additional financing

PERFORMANCE MONITORING, EVALUATION, REPORTING AND 
COMMUNICATION 
A. 
Project Design and Monitoring Framework 
91. 
The  updated  design  and  monitoring  framework  (DMF)  is  in  Appendix  1.  The  DMF  has 
been  retrofitted  to  align  with  ADB’s  latest  Guidelines  for  Preparing  and  Using  a  Design  and 
Monitoring Framework: Sovereign Operations and Technical Assistance (2020). Output 3 of the 
original DMF was reclassified as project management activities. 
B. 
Monitoring 
Project performance monitoring. Within 6 months of loan effectiveness BWDB with the 
92. 
support of the PMDC will establish a Monitoring Cell for the Project. The Monitoring Cell will be 
established to provide independent verification of the performance of various stakeholders as well 
as assessing impacts associated with investment objectives. The monitoring cell will be linked to 
the existing monitoring division within BWDB under the Chief Monitoring who reports to BWDB's 
Director General. The monitoring cell will monitor the project progress against the outputs and 
targets  set  out  in  the  DMF.  The  monitoring  cell  with  support  of  the  PMDC  consultants  will, 
establish  a  project  performance  monitoring  system  in  line  with  the  targets,  indicators, 
assumptions, and risks described in the DMF. The monitoring cell will consolidate the results and 
prepare  the  quarterly  progress  reports  and  an  annual  report  which  will  include  the  required 
indicators  and  provide  information  necessary  to  update  ADB's  project  performance  reporting 
system. 
93. 
Compliance Monitoring. The status of compliance with loan covenants, including policy, 
legal,  financial,  economic,  environmental,  and  others,  will  be  monitored  and  reported  by  PMU 
through the quarterly progress reports, which will be consolidated and submitted by the PMO to 
ADB. The results will be reviewed in detail during ADB's review missions. In particular, the status 
of  the  implementation  of  safeguard  measures  described  in  EMP  and  RP,  as  well  as 
implementation of measures described in SPRSS and GAP, will be monitored and reported by 
the PIU in quarterly project progress reports.  
94. 
Safeguard Monitoring. Within 6 months of loan effectiveness BWDB with the support of 
the PMDC will establish a Safeguards Cell for the Project. The Safeguards Cell will be established 
to  provide  independent  verification  of  the  project  safeguards  including  the  environmental 
management plan (EMP), resettlement plan (RP), and gender and social dimensions monitoring 
including the gender action plan (GAP). The monitoring cell will be linked to the existing monitoring 
division within BWDB under the Chief Monitoring who reports to BWDB's Director General. 
The  safeguards  cell  which  will  be  staffed  by  three  Government  officers  (environment, 
95. 
resettlement  and  social  dimensions  and  gender)  with  support  of  the  PMDC  consultants  will, 
establish a project performance monitoring system in line with the targets, indicators, assumptions 
and risks described in the IEE, RP, and GAP. The monitoring cell will consolidate the results and 
prepare  the  quarterly  progress  reports  and  an  annual  report  which  will  include  the  required 
indicators and provide information necessary to compliance with safeguards. 
96. 
It  is  proposed  that  an  independent  third-party  consultant  or  institute  is  engaged  to 
implement safeguards monitoring. Data will be collected from the Irrigation Management Operator 
as well as the Implementing NGO who will be implementing the resettlement as well supported 
by direct collection of data to ensure adequate verification. 
45 
The  status  of  the  implementation  of  the  safeguards  including  the  initial  environmental 
97. 
examination IEE/EMP and social dimensions including RP and GAP will be discussed at each 
ADB  review  mission  and  integrated  into  semi-annual  reports  for  IEE/EMP,  RP,  and  GAP 
implementation. These will be prepared by the safeguards cell with support from consultant and 
sent  to  the  PMU  to  be  forwarded  to  the  ADB.  PMU  will  ensure  submission  of  semi-annual 
Environmental  Monitoring  Report  (EMR)  and  Social  Safeguards  Monitoring  Report  (SMR)  for 
ADB’s review and endorsement within 1 month from the end of the reporting period. 
C. 
Evaluation 
98.  Within  24  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  ADB  will  conduct  a  mid-term  review  to  identify 
problems  and  constraints  encountered  and  suggest  measures  to  address  them,  including 
appropriateness  of  scope,  design,  implementation  arrangements,  schedule  of  activities  and 
compliance with safeguard and other covenants. 
D. 
Reporting 
99. 
The PMU will provide ADB with (i) quarterly progress reports in a format consistent with 
ADB's  project  performance  reporting  system;  (ii)  consolidated  annual  reports  including  (a) 
progress achieved by output as measured through each indicator's performance targets, (b) key 
implementation issues and solutions; (c) updated procurement plan; (d) semi-annual safeguards 
monitoring  reports;  annually  for  environment  and  semi-annual  for  resettlement;  (e)  quarterly 
monitoring  report  on  implementing  the  GAP  and  (f)  updated  implementation  plan  for  next  12 
months; and (iii) a project completion report within six months of physical completion of the project. 
To ensure projects continue to be both viable and sustainable, project financial statements and 
the executing agency AFSs, together with the associated auditor's report, should be adequately 
reviewed.  
E. 
Stakeholder Communication Strategy 
100.  The project will maximize transparency by communicating relevant project information to 
stakeholders  in  various  means.  The  PMU  will  set  up  a  website  within  two  months  of  loan 
effectiveness  and  disclose  all  key  project-related  information,  including  the  scope,  cost,  and 
financial and institutional arrangements of the project, project safeguard reports such as IEE, GAP 
and project progress such as procurement, contract award and disbursement. The PMO will also 
fully disclose through the website and its information center relevant project-related information, 
such as subproject cost, cost-sharing arrangement, contractor's name, contract price, progress 
of  construction,  financial  status  of  municipalities,  through  public  briefings,  bulletin  boards, 
municipal  annual  reports,  etc.  All  information  should  be  sex-disaggregated  as  applicable.  The 
safeguard documents will also be disclosed in ADB website.  
101.  Participation is an important aspect of the project. Public awareness programs for gender, 
social, and infrastructure subproject related measures will be implemented by the PMU supported 
by PMDC  during  the  planning  and  design  of  TBP  and  GKIP  and the  project  C-IMO  during the 
implementation  stages.  The  PMU  with  the  support  of  the  PMDC  working  with  the  C-IMO  will 
prepare a consultation awareness and participation plan (CAPP) within six months of loan signing. 
The CAPP will be used to guide consultation and awareness building activities under the project 
to  be  conducted  in  parallel  with  physical  investment  activities.  The  GAP  and  CAPP  plans  will 
ensure sufficient consultation and participation with beneficiaries, including women, the poor and 
vulnerable groups. 
46 
1. 
Information Disclosure 
102.  The  Stakeholders  Communication  Strategy  implementation  will  engage  and  inform 
relevant  IMIP  stakeholders  and  sectors  with  timely,  accurate,  and  comprehensive  information 
shared among stakeholders. Such information sharing will help to build consensus and ensure 
continuous  stakeholder  support  throughout  the  Project.  The  stakeholder  Engagement  and 
Communication  Strategy  (SE&C)  is  to  significantly  increase  stakeholder  and  community 
awareness of the Project strategy, proposals activities and outputs in order to improve stakeholder 
engagement  and  to  develop  greater  community  support  for  the  project  proposals  and  the 
decision-making process. The guidelines for SE&C will include: 
(i) 
(ii) 
Clarify the objectives and goals of engagement and evaluate the appropriateness 
of techniques.  
Understand related processes and be clear about how the engagement fits in with 
official decision-making processes.  
(iii)  Manage  information  in  an  accessible  way  without  using  complex  concepts  or 
(iv) 
(v) 
(vi) 
(vii) 
jargon.  
Support the development of capacity in understanding and applying the research 
concepts.  
Ensure  transparent  identification  of  stakeholder  groups  and  invitations  to  be 
involved.  
Build trust with and between participants for the long term.  
Allocate  sufficient  time  to  develop  process,  build  partnerships  and  strengthen 
networks.  
(viii)  Encourage feedback and ensure flexibility to adapt to that feedback.  
103.  Stakeholder  Engagement  and  Communication  Objectives.  The  main  stakeholder 
engagement and communication objectives include:  
104.  Awareness.  The  PPTA  has  implemented  an  intensive  program  of  communication  and 
awareness however it is assessed that the majority of farmers and other stakeholders do know 
about the proposed project do not know the detail of the project components. Stakeholders are 
somewhat disappointed in the delays in the project start for the MIP but also in TBIP and GKIP. 
The  following  aspects  need  to  be  addressed  to  attain  the  awareness  among  the  different 
stakeholders including women of the project. 
105.  Awareness 
•  To  raise  overall  awareness  of  the  project,  its  intent,  activities  and  outputs  including 
opportunity for women employment and women development activities. 
•  To promote the benefits and positive aspects of the project.  
•  To raise awareness of the linkages between the MIP and other related projects.  
•  To ensure stakeholders are aware of the project and how to be involved.  
•  Attitude: 
•  To reduce communications risks by encouraging a positive view of the project.  
•  To manage expectations of what the project can and can’t deliver.  
106.  Behaviors:  
•  To encourage public demonstrations of support for the project.  
•  To encourage key stakeholders to engage in project activities.  
47 
•  To  provide  tools  for  project  partners  and  collaborators  to  communicate  the  project 
intent, activities and outputs.  
107.  The SE&C will be based on a strategic approach including: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
(v) 
(vi) 
Building direct, positive relationships wherever possible  
Utilizing  media  and  stakeholder  networks  where  direct  relationships  are  not 
possible  
Building strong linkages between MIP and other relevant projects 
Facilitating information sharing and information sharing networks  
Demonstrating how MIP is contributing to a broad range and societal goals  
Using a matrix of communication tools in a sustained program  
108.  There  are  three  distinct  approaches  to  communication  that  can  be  used  for  successful 
implementation of the campaign for the implementation of the MIP as well as the planning and 
design activities for the GKIP and TBP: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
Behaviour  change  communication:  This  approach  addresses  the  knowledge, 
attitudes,  behaviour  and  skills  of  individuals,  families  and  communities  as  they 
relate to specific program goals. Within a participatory communication framework, 
individuals and communities gain knowledge, appreciation and skills that motivate 
them to develop positive and healthy behaviour and practices.  
Communication for social mobilization: This approach moves beyond the individual 
behaviour  change  communication 
to  a  more  comprehensive  model  of 
communication.  It  provides  an  opportunity  for  greater  levels  of  community 
participation  in  social  change.  It  involves  planned  actions  to  reach,  influence, 
enable, and involve key segments of the community in order to collectively create 
an environment that will affect positive behaviour and bring about desired social 
change. Segments include influential groups or individuals as well as formal and 
informal  leaders  among  those  who  will  directly  benefit  from  the  desired  social 
change. 
Communication for advocacy: It is an organized attempt to influence the political 
climate, policy and program decisions, public perceptions of social norms, funding 
decisions, and strengthen the voices of communities and societies for social and 
policy change.  
109.  Planning and research is required to ensure the message reaches the key stakeholders 
with optimum impact and frequency.  
110.  Experience has shown that the communication plan and activities must be targeted to the 
proposed  requirements  of  behavioral  and  social  change;  experience  has  shown  that 
communication activities are more successful when consistent messages are conveyed through 
a  mix  of  channels  and  tools,  specially  combining  the  community  media  (interpersonal 
communication) with mass media programs:  
(i) 
Community-based communication. A range of communication activities can be 
carried  out  using  participatory  and  interpersonal  communication  tools.  The 
success of this communication requires the active involvement of the participants 
in  the  communication  development  process.  Informal  discussion  meeting  and 
workshop with the stakeholders are proposed. Interpersonal communication tools 
and  community  media  like  folk  media,  theatre,  folk  songs,  and  festivals.  The 
48 
success of this communication requires the active involvement of the participants 
in  the  communication  development  process.  Activities  suggested  include  farmer 
group discussions, courtyard meetings and group discussions. 
Mass media campaign. The mass media can be a strong source of information 
for  raising  awareness,  building  knowledge,  and  influencing  public  opinion.  The 
following  devices  can  be  used  National  and  local  level  seminar/workshop, 
Electronic  media  -Radio,  Television,  video, 
internet.  Print  media  -
Newspapers,  newsletters,  fact  sheets,  handouts,  posters, research  findings and 
reports.  
Participative  Planning  and  Design:  Farm  level  design  will  be  done  in 
participative  approaches  including  briefing  meetings  and  walk  through  with 
farmers.

2. 
Phases of Communication and Engagement Strategy and Outputs 
111. 
It  is  proposed  that  both  the  PMDC  and  the  C-IMO  implement  a  focused  program  of 
stakeholder  engagement,  communication,  and  awareness  during  the  Project.  The  PMDC  will 
focus  on  the  development  of  participative  planning  and  design  for  the  GKIP  and  TBP 
modernization;  while  the  C-IMO  develops  a  highly  focused  campaign  to  engage  with  farmers, 
WMO's and other stakeholders to implement the new initiatives for OM as well as the programs 
of agricultural support. 
112.  Planning the program: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
Planning and design of the approach: this will be done in Month 3 based on an 
assessment  of  the  communication  work  implemented  under  the  PPTA  together 
with consultation with Government and Non-Government stakeholders to assess 
current levels of knowledge and awareness of the project objectives. 
Communication  and  engagement  with  selected  stakeholders  to  support  the 
preparation of the project design. 
Upscaled communication and awareness to the wider stakeholders  
Monitoring  and  response  to  provide  feedback  on  the  response  to  the  proposed 
project proposals. 
113.  The proposed communication and engagement program for the PMDC is summarized in 
Table 21 below. This program is designed to inform the stakeholders of the IMIP and to engage 
with stakeholder to support the project planning and design for TBP and the GKIP.

ANTICORRUPTION POLICY 
115.  ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any violations of the 
Anticorruption  Policy  relating  to  the  Project.25  All  contracts  financed  by  ADB  shall  include 
provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the 
executing agency and all Project contractors, suppliers, consultants and other service providers. 
Individuals/entities  on  ADB’s  anticorruption  debarment  list  are  ineligible  to  participate  in  ADB-
financed activity and may not be awarded any contracts under the Project. 
116.  To support these efforts, relevant provisions are included in the financing agreements and 
the  bidding  documents  for  the  Project.  Risks  associated  with  project  management,  including 
procurement and disbursement, will be mitigated by (i) providing consulting inputs to advise and 
assist in the procurement of goods and services; (ii) requiring that civil work contracts include a 
condition that contractors adhere to ADB’s Anticorruption Policy (1998, 29 amended, from time to 
time); (iii) the PMU periodically inspecting the contractors fund withdrawals and settlements; and 
(iv) reporting on project activities and implementation on the website to foster transparency and 
timely awarding of contracts.  
117.  The government will ensure that (i) BWDB conducts periodic monitoring inspections on all 
contractors’ activities related to fund withdrawals and settlements; and (ii) all contracts financed 
by ADB in connection with the project include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and 
examine the records and accounts of BWDB and all contractors, suppliers, consultants and other 
service providers as they relate to the project.

XI. 
ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISM 
118.  People who  are,  or  may  in  the  future  be,  adversely  affected  by the  project may submit 
complaints  to  ADB’s  Accountability  Mechanism.  The  Accountability  Mechanism  provides  an 
independent forum and process whereby people adversely affected by ADB-assisted projects can 
voice,  and  seek  a  resolution  of  their  problems,  as  well  as  report  alleged  violations  of  ADB’s 
operational  policies  and  procedures.  Before  submitting  a  complaint  to  the  Accountability 
Mechanism, affected people should make a good faith effort to solve their problems by working 
with  the  concerned  ADB  operations  department.  Only  after  doing  that,  and  if  they  are  still 
dissatisfied, should they approach the Accountability Mechanism.26

b  The impact statement of the ongoing loan remains aligned with Government of Bangladesh. 2020. Eighth Five-Year

c  For secondary (Level 2) and tertiary (level 3) drainage and irrigation networks, efficient irrigation management (i.e. 
buried-piped and metered water distribution system, leading to less water consumption while increasing crop yield) 
will be provided by the long-term performance-based operator. 
d  Examples of more productive irrigated agriculture methods: system of rice intensification method, alternate wetting 
and  drying  technique,  better  control  of  fertilizer,  use  of  hybrids,  pest  control,  crop  diversification,  and  use  of  drip 
irrigation. 
e  After completion of the topographic survey and detailed reconnaissance, it was realized that the modernization of 
the Muhuri Irrigation Project command area could be extended to 18,000 ha (850 schemes) instead of the 17,000 ha 
(800 schemes) estimated during the project preparation. 
f  The project area of greater Noakhali, including Feni district, is a culturally conservative area with strict religious values 
and practices. As such, women’s active participation in the project was discouraged and often prohibited by their 
families and communities. The women in the area strictly observe purdah, which does not allow them to work outside 
their home, especially with men outside the family. This situation and the challenges it caused to implementation is 
recorded in the aide-mémoire of the May 2017 and January 2018 project review missions. To respond to this situation, 
some indicators related to labor and hiring were reduced in the additional financing. 
g  Output  3  of  the  ongoing  loan’s  original  design  and  monitoring  framework  has  been  reclassified  as  “project 
management  activities"  in  line  with  ADB.  2020.  Guidelines  for  Preparing  and  Using  a  Design  and  Monitoring 
Framework: Sovereign Operations and Technical Assistance. Manila. 
h  As of 6 April 2021, the ADB loan, which was denominated in special drawing rights, was reduced from $46.0 million 
to  around $41.5 million because of the depreciation of the special drawing right against the dollar. Combined adjusted 
original loan and additional financing amounts to $55.0 million.

TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR MUHURI IRRIGATION MANAGEMENT OPERATOR 
(C-IMO) 
A. 
Introduction 
1. 
The Muhuri Irrigation Project (MIP) is located in the middle of the Southeastern Region of 
Bangladesh adjacent to the coastal belt of the Bay of Bengal.7 It has an approximate a total area 
of  about  43,900  ha  and  covers  the  four  Upazilas  of  FeniSadar,  Sonagazi,  Chagalnaiya  and 
ParsuramUpazilas under Feni District, and the MirsaraiUpazila of Chattogram District. The Muhuri 
project (MIP) overlaps with the Muhuri-Kahua Irrigation Project (MKIP) which was developed in 
the 1990s. The area of MuhuriKahua outside the original Muhuri has a total area of about 21,700 
ha and is contiguous with MIP. Both schemes rely on the same water supply and hence will be 
considered combined under IMIP and referred to as the Muhuri Irrigation Project (MIP) (Figure 1). 
The scope of this service will cover the extended areas incorporating both projects with a gross 
area of around 65,000ha with a cultivated area of around 38,500 ha. A summary of their total, 
settled, cultivated and commanded areas is shown in Table 1.

Topographic relief of the project area is generally low lying with ground elevations varying 
from 8m PWD in the north to 4m PWD in the south; and 5.3m in the west to 6m PWD in the east. 
The area comprises smooth, broad ridges and basins which are underlain by silty-soil deposits. 
Land types classified according to seasonal depth of flooding are shown in Table 2 which shows 
about 70% of the area floods to a depth of 0.9 m of more during the Kharif season.

3. 
Geologically,  MIP  comprises  parts  of  the  physiographic  unit  of  Meghna  Esturine  Flood 
Plain, Chittagong Coastal Plain, and the Northern and Eastern Hills. The area has the following 
soil characteristics: 
(i) 
Old Meghna Estuarine Flood plain: Silt-loam soils predominate on highlands and 
silty-clay to clay in lowlands. Non-calcareous Dark Grey Flood plain soils are the 
only  general  type  of  the  area.  Organic  matter  content  of  the  soils  is  moderate, 
7 Between latitudes 22°45´N to 23°09´N and longitudes 91°21´Eto 91°35´E 
Appendix 3 
 87 
(ii) 
moisture holding capacity is medium. Topsoils are moderately acidic but sub soils 
neutral in reaction. General fertility level is medium. 
Chittagong Coastal Plain: Non-calcareous Grey Floodplain Soils, Non-calcareous 
Alluvium and acid sulphate soils are the major components of general soil types of 
the area. Generally, the fertility level of soils is medium. Organic matter content is 
low to moderate. 
4. 
Based  on  sample  surveys,  landholdings  comprise:  (i)  37%  are  landless  or  functionally 
landless  with  less  than  0.2  ha  of  landholdings;  (ii)  47%  have  small  or  marginal  land  holdings 
ranging from 0.2 ha to 1.0 ha; (iii) 13% have medium landholdings ranging from 1 ha to 3 ha; and 
(iv) 3% have large landholdings greater than 3 ha.8 
5. 
The MIP area experiences three seasons: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
Southwest Monsoon, usually starting in May and lasting until October. Almost 90% 
of  the  total  annual  rainfall  occurs  during  this  period,  when  temperatures  and 
relative humidity are high. 
Northeast Monsoon, usually lasting from November to March. This is the dry, cold 
season but occasionally rainfall occurs. 
Hot Season, usually a short period that extends from about late March to May. The 
highest daily temperatures generally occur at this time and, owing to cloud burst 
events,  flash  floods  often  occur  from  the  rivers  flowing  from  the  Tripura  Hills 
located in the eastern region. 
6. 
MIP  has  a  three  tiered  system:  (i)  the  Level  1  primary  system  comprises  the  coastal 
embankment, main regulator structures, the Feni Reservoir and the Feni, Muhuri and Kalidash-
Pahaliamain river channels; (ii) the Level 2 secondary system comprises the khals; and (iii) the 
Level 3 tertiary system comprises the low lift pumps (LLPs) and farm distribution systems. The 
embankment and regulator raise water levels in the upstream rivers which in-turn flood the khals. 
LLPs are positioned along the khals and raise the water from the khal into the farm distribution 
systems, each servicing command areas ranging from 5 ha to 40 ha. In addition to irrigation, the 
Level 1 system also manages the risk of both river and tidal flooding.

B. 
Main Issues Affecting MIP Productivity 
MIP  has  lost  productivity,  in  terms  of  irrigated  area  and  cropping  intensities,  owing  to 
7. 
limited access to water and poor drainage. The main causes are complex and include:  
(i) 
(ii) 
Major siltation in the khals and rivers which: (a) limits sufficient irrigation water in 
the khals from reaching the LLPs; and (b) restricts drainage from flowing back to 
the rivers.  
Significant reduction in Feni Reservoir storage due to siltation. The original reservoir 
storage was about 32Mm3 but this has reduced to about 7Mm3. The current overall 
storage in reservoir, rivers and khals is 54Mm3 of which 18Mm3 is live storage. 
Appendix 3 
 89 
(iii) 
There  are  large  annual  climatic  variations  which  are  affecting  water  availability. 
Delayed  planting  due  to  cold  winters  and  slow  mobilisation  of  the  pumps  are 
delaying  the  planting  dates  of  boro  rice  and  putting  additional  pressure  on  the 
scarce water resources during February and March which coincide with the lowest 
river flows. 
(iv)  The low prices of rice and high prices of inputs including pumping has resulted in 
(v) 
many farmers not planting rice.  
Pump operators find it too expensive to provide water to plots located far from the 
pumps and most of the irrigated land is a nucleus around each pump. 
(vi)  There  is  a  significant  drop  in  the  number  of  operational  pumps  and  the  irrigated 
areas. Pump inventories in 2013 show there are only about 440 operational pumps 
from an original 800 pumps. The irrigated area from surface water based on 2013 
satellite imagery is estimated to be 11,300 ha in MIP (including the Muhuri-Kahua 
area) reduced by 50% from the original target of 23,000ha. 
8. 
Other issues include deterioration of the coastal embankment and associate’s structures 
which are causing salinity intrusion and impediments to drainage as well as risk from sea water 
inundation during high sea level periods. 
C. 
Planned MIP Infrastructure Investments 
9. 
In the framework of the IMIP an investment plan is designed to increase the productivity 
and  long-term  sustainability  of  the  MIP.  The  investments  have  been  targeted  to  improve  the 
irrigation performance and cost recovery and include: 
(i) 
(ii) 
Repair  of  the  coastal  embankment  and  associated  structures  to  prevent  saline 
intrusion and ingress of sea water during storms. 
Repair  of  10  existing  flow  control  structures  including  the  main  Regulator  and 
provision of 8 new small water/ flood control structures. 
(iii)  Excavation of about 3.8 million m3 from the 460km of khals to provide full access to 
irrigation water for all irrigation water users and to improve drainage. 
(iv)  Upgrading and modernization of the Level 3 system including: (a) the replacement 
of  existing  (mostly  diesel)  pumps  with  electric  pumps;  (b)  replacement  of  the 
existing open canals with buried PVC pipe distribution system; and (c) installation 
of a prepaid meter system to allow water allocations to be based on a volumetric 
basis and ensure full and transparent payment and accounting. 
(v)  Upgrading and expansion of the local electrical distribution system to energize all 
new pumps to reduce operation costs and allow for the introduction of prepaid card 
meters  and  control  systems.  Four  pilot  solar  power  pumping  units  will  also  be 
installed to irrigate 60ha. 
(vi)  Provision of the prepaid card meters and control systems. 
(vii)  Repair of BWDB office space for use by BWDB and the IMO.  
10. 
The investment to modernize the tertiary (farmer) distribution system forms about 40% of 
the investment and is designed to increase the water efficiencies to maximize the irrigable area, 
as  well  as  reduce  operation  and  maintenance  (OM)  costs.  The  prepaid  metering  and  piped 
distribution will enable provision of on-demand water to farmers throughout the year. It will open 
opportunities for farmers to increase cropping intensities, support crop diversification and facilitate 
collection of water charges. The use of low-pressure pipes offers the best to solution to meeting 
the needs of water and power efficiencies.  
90 
Appendix 3 
All the existing diesel pumps will be replaced with electric pumps to reduce the operating 
11. 
costs and improve efficiencies. For about 60 ha (4 schemes), provision of solar panels will also 
be installed as pilots to demonstrate the potential for supplementary electric power.  
To  advance  project  preparedness  and  allow  construction  activities  to  begin  during  the 
12. 
IMO’s first year of operation, detailed designs of new Level 3 systems have been prepared and 
approved by the government. These cover about 2,000 ha of MIP, including a 60ha pilot with solar 
pumping as well the preparation of designs for the earthworks (khal excavation and repairs to the 
coastal embankment). 
D. 
Planned Pre-paid Smartcard Pump Operation and Revenue Collection System 
Prepaid  smartcard  meter  and  control  systems  offer  a  highly  efficient  and  transparent 
13. 
collection of service fees from farmers.  The system also allows the farmers to pay based on the 
volume of water received which has shown to result in significant water use reduction over current 
systems that charge on seasonal payments per area basis. Prepaid meter have been tested and 
are  proving  very  effective  under  the  Barind  Multipurpose  Development  Authority  Project.9  In 
conjunction with a buried pipe tertiary distribution system, this modernized system is expected to 
result in the following: (i) water use efficiency gains; (ii) flexible on-demand irrigation supply to 
farmers; (iii) 100% financial cost recovery from users (farmers) according to amount of water each 
uses; and (iv) elimination of possible "rent seeking" from pump owners and operators, corruption, 
or loss of project funds. These in turn will enable: (i) considerable expansion in cropped area; (ii) 
reduced pumping volumes and costs; (iii) a variety of crops to be cultivated with different planting 
dates, crop durations and irrigation water requirements, to suit individual farmers; (iv) improved 
crop yields arising the individual farmers being able to control timing and amounts of irrigations; 
and (v) sustainable funding for operation and maintenance. 
E. 
Planned MIP Management Arrangements 
14. 
The MOM of the Level 1 will remain with the BWDB; although there is some discussion 
that  the  OM  of  some  minor  structures  (including  minor  sluice  gates  in  the  coastal  and  river 
embankment) might be assigned to the IMO.This transfer of the responsibility will however not 
occur during the stage 1 management contract. 
15. 
Under the IMIP it has been agreed that the MOM of Levels 2 and 3 will be assigned to the 
IMO. The IMO will be contracted by BWDB in two stages: (i) Stage 1 IMO will be a performance-
based management  contract  for  Years  1  to  5 (inclusive)  during  which  the IMO  will  design  and 
supervise construction of the investment works while also managing, operating and maintaining 
Levels 2 and 3 of the project; and (ii) Stage 2 IMO will be a 15 year lease contract for years 6 to 
21 (inclusive) to undertake MOM of Level 2 and 3 of the project. The Stage 1 IMO will be financed 
by  IMIP  according  to  the  terms  of  the  contract,  whereas  the  Stage  2 IMO  should  be  financed 
solely from water tariff revenues. During Stage 1 there will be an independent review of the IMO 
arrangements and terms of reference (TOR) for Stage 2 will be prepared with support from PMDC. 
The present TOR applies to the Stage 1 IMO only. 
16. 
The stage 1 IMO will be a private company or consortium contracted by BWDB through 
international  competitive  bidding  based  on  a  two-envelope  technical  and  financial  offer.  The 
contract will be for a five-year period. During this period, the IMO will be responsible for MIP’s 
9   http://www.bmda.gov.bd/ 
Appendix 3 
 91 
MOM (Levels 2 and 3) and will include the establishment and management of efficient revenue 
collecting  through  the  prepaid  meter  systems.  The  IMO  would  also  be  responsible  for:  (i)  the 
design for tertiary level infrastructure (LLPs with prepaid smartcard systems and water distribution 
system),  (ii)  supervision  of  construction  of  all  the  investment  contracts  (including  those  for  the 
Level 1 system that will be designed by the PMDC); and (iii) the development of pilot agricultural 
demonstrations and pilot cost recovery activities. All MIP assets will remain in the ownership of 
the  Government.  A  summary  of  the  design  and  construction  supervision  responsibilities  are 
summarised in Table 3 below.

The Water Management Organizations (WUG, WMA and WMF) will play a supporting and 
guiding role for the IMO through the Implementation Coordination Committee (ICC) as shown in 
Figure 2. The ICC would meet quarterly. The costs including honorarium of the ICC would be paid 
through the ISC fund.

Financing of Operation and Maintenance 
The  recovery  of  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  costs  at  MIP  will  be  via  irrigation 
18. 
charges  levied through  the  prepaid meters.    The  irrigation charge  will  be  based  on  a tariff  per 
cubic meter (m3) pumped measured against the volume of water pumped by each farmer. The 
financial analysis incorporates an evaluation of the current and future O&M costs at 2013 prices. 
The current costs of O&M are estimated to be USD26/ha for Level 1, USD20/ha for Level 2, and 
for Level 3 USD99/ha for electric pumps and USD137/ha for the diesel pumps. The estimated 
future costs of O&M for Levels 2 and 3 under Stage 2 (year 7 onwards) are summarised in Table 
4 below10. 
10  Under  Stage  1,  a  construction-phase  IMO  will  be  recruited  through  a  5-year  performance-based  management 
contract to supervise the modernization works and bring the scheme to the required level of efficiency and profitability. 
Under Stage 2, a management-phase IMO will be contracted for 15 years through a public private partnership.

The estimated annual volume of water pumped is around 200 million m3 mainly to meet 
the requirements of 17,000 ha of boro rice at a water requirement of 11,600 m3/ha. It is anticipated 
that additional pumped irrigation would take place outside the boro season, but this has not been 
included in the estimates. To meet the needs of full O&M cost recovery for Levels 2 and 3 requires 
an annual revenue of USD2.1 million (Tk168 million) per year which requires the water tariff to be 
set at USD10.55 per 1,000 m3 based on 200 million m3 pumped per year.  
20. 
A comparison of current levels of charging and the estimated future costs of O&M is in 
Table 5.  The full  O&M cost recovery tariff  is  equivalent  to  USD124/ha,  equal  to approximately 
90% of the current water charge for diesel pumps (USD138/ha) and 25% higher than the charge 
for electric pumps (USD99/ha).

Farmers have reported difficulty in meeting current water charges due to the low price of 
rice. The new irrigation system will improve opportunities to increase crop returns. While keeping 
tariffs  low  may  seem  desirable,  an  underfunded  IMO  will  not  deliver  an  adequate  service.  In 
theory,  keeping  the  tariff  below  the  full  cost  recovery  level  can  be  compensated  by  periodic 
government transfer. In practice however, budgetary allocations are very often subverted resulting 
in operators not being able to meet their operational obligations. A strategy of self-financing of the 
IMOs was adopted. Alternative and supplementary cost recovery mechanisms will be investigated 
and piloted by the IMO during the first stage of MIP development including the lease of land and 
water assets, agricultural services, and royalties from sand abstraction. 
94 
Appendix 3 
During Stage 1 the IMO staffing and administration costs would be paid for by the loan 
22. 
with no linkage to the irrigation charges. This will allow the IMO to operate and establish the O&M 
systems independent of revenue. However, six months’ operational revenue will be built up during 
Stage 1 to as a fund for Stage 2 to cover, for instance, the requirements of deferred maintenance 
and renewals. The irrigation service charge (ISC) is currently USD3.25/ha (Tk260/ha) which is 
about 2% of the cost of the O&M of levels 2 and 3. It is proposed that out of the ISC, the IMO 
would be paid a fee of 20% for collection, 50% would support Level 2 and 3 maintenance costs, 
and the remaining 30% would be split between the water users’ association (WUA) and BWDB. 
The  costs  of  the  Implementation  Coordination  Committee  (ICC)  would  be  paid  from  BWDB's 
share.  
23. 
Based on an analysis of 2013 prices it is recommended that initial water charge is set at 
USD9.00 (Tk720) per '000 m3, which is 15% less than the requirement for full O&M cost recovery.  
This will have to be adjusted annually incorporating escalation especially with respect to electricity 
tariffs. Future adjustments to the irrigation tariff would be determined by BWDB working in close 
liaison with the IMO and the ICC. By year 6, however, the tariff should be at an adequate level to 
meet the needs of full O&M cost recovery. The IMO will be working in Stage 1 to support increased 
crop  productivity  as  well  as  investigating  alternative  and  supplementary  opportunities  for  cost 
recovery. For Stage 2 the level of the irrigation tariff can be incorporated into the evaluation of 
bids for MIP operation. This provides a clear incentive for the IMO to reduce costs and establish 
supplementary cost recovery mechanisms. 
24. 
For  Level  1  infrastructure,  current  annual  maintenance  costs  are  estimated  at  USD0.5 
million (Tk40 million), excluding BWDB costs estimated at USD0.3 million (Tk24 million) per year. 
Current government allocations are sufficient to meet these requirements. The estimated overall 
O&M  budgets  for  MIP  are  shown  in  Table  6.  Under  the  project  BWDB  will  transfer  the 
responsibility  for  Level  2  O&M  to  the  IMO  and  BWDB  allocations  for  Level  2  O&M  will  be 
transferred to Level 1. With this reallocation of resources and recent increases in O&M funding it 
is  estimated  that  government  funding  would  be  sufficient  to  meet  the  requirements  of  Level  1 
O&M.

SCOPE OF SERVICES 
G. 
Introduction 
The  IMO  will  be  engaged  under  a  Management  Services  Contract  for  the  provision  of 
25. 
services for design, construction supervision, MOM, and agricultural support services for MIP. A 
general schedule of the following activities is shown in Figure 2: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
Activity 1: Establishment of efficient and sustainable MOM of Level 2 and 3 
infrastructures on rehabilitated areas. 
Activity 2: Construction supervision of MIP investment works. 
Activity 3: Participatory design of the Level 3 distribution systems. 
Activity 4: Agricultural support services, pilot cost recovery activities, and 
implementation of training and awareness programmes. 
Figure 3: Activity planning during over the contract time 
26.  Given the importance of all aspects of the contract in the long-term sustainability of the 
provision of irrigation services for MIP, bidders should submit as part of their technical proposal a 
detailed  plan  showing  their  proposed  approach  to  the  integration  of  the  four  activities,  an 
appreciation of the key issues involved, and their approach to staffing and project management. 
The  services  and  outputs  of  the  IMO  are  described  in  detail  below.  Any  urgent  tasks  evolved 
during contract period and not mentioned in the TOR should be accomplished by the IMO if it is 
in accordance with the Contract.

(vii) 
Establishing transparent and open systems of financial management through an 
Escrow11 bank account for the project which would be used for collected revenue 
and payment of pump operations including pump operators, payment of electricity 
and telecom tariffs, and seed money for financing the IMO in Stage 2. 
The  water  tariff  will  incorporate  the  collection  of  the  irrigation  service  charge.  A 
portion  of  the  ISC  currently  levied  at  USD3.25/ha  will  be  paid  to  BWDB,  the 
Implementation Coordination Committee (ICC) and to the WUAs. The allocation of 
the ISC funds will be decided by the ICC. 
(viii)  Preparation of an annual report and work plan, preparation of quarterly progress 
reports showing revenues and disbursements. 
(x) 
(ix)  Maintaining  a  professional  approach  to  undertaking  all  tasks  and  keeping  the 
highest possible level of cooperation and relationship with water users and other 
stakeholders. 
Selecting  and  contracting  individual  pump  operators.  The  IMO  will  prepare  a 
standard form of contract for engaging all pump operators which will be amended 
and updated as necessary on a collective basis. Selection will be based on their 
skills, attitude and experience. The experience of existing pump operators will be 
taken into account. 
For OM works funded by revenue engage for small works or service contracts as 
required.  Procurement will follow government and ADB Procurement Guidelines 
(2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  ADB’s  Guidelines  for  the  Use  of 
Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). 
(xi) 
(xii)  Monitoring, developing and maintaining a water resources management plan for 
the  project  area  that  includes  surface  and  ground  water.  The  plans  will  be 
developed  in  coordination  with  the  PMDC  consultants  who  will  undertake 
hydrological and hydro-geological studies for MIP and he IMO will be responsible 
to  apply  the  outputs  of  the  technical  studies  and  engage  with  stakeholders  to 
develop  long-term  sustainable  management  including  balancing  and  optimising 
the available water resources with the cropping systems. The management plan 
will  include;  (i)  working with  BWDB  hydrology  unit to  improve  the  quality  of  flow 
measurement  (budget  has  been  allocated  to  the  PMU  to  procure  ADCP  flow 
measurement  equipment);  (ii)  to  apply  the  outputs  of  the  PMDC  hydrological 
studies to improve the operation procedures for the MIP including the operation of 
the  main  barrage  gates;  (iii)  applying  rainfall  and  flow  monitoring  information 
provide  annual  forecasting  information  to  farmers  of  likely  dry  season  flow 
conditions which can be applied to improve  crop planning; (iv) apply the outputs 
of the hydrological studies to develop mechanisms for farmers better fit cropping 
to  the  water  availabilities,  these  could  include  adjusting  the  water  tariffs  during 
certain  months  to  encourage/discourage  water  use;  (v)  develop  improved 
assessments of trends of river flows and engage with farmers to adapt cropping 
patterns  to  meet  possible  future  water  shortages;  (vi)  based  on  the  hydro-
geological  assessments  by  the  PMDC  improve  the  conjunctive  management  of 
surface and groundwater in the MIP. 
Liaise with the Rural Electrification Board (REB) and PalliBidyutSamity (PBS) to 
ensure the best quality of service is made available for irrigation including reducing 
wherever  possible  power  cuts  especially  during  the  periods  of  peak  irrigation 
requirements and the sensitive periods of crop growth. The provision of power for

 97 
the MIP will be based on a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the 
BWDB and the REB; the MOU will be signed in early 2014. 
(xiv)  Supporting the farmers to manage pumping to meet the needs of crops within the 
constraints  of  electrical  power  outages.  Mitigation  measures  to  meet  power 
shortages will include; (i) the optimum use of the two pumps to be provided at each 
location. (for each irrigation unit, two pumps will be provided-the main pump will 
meet  the  peak  irrigation  requirements  based  on  24  hours  electricity  supply,  a 
second  booster  pump  will  provide  additional  capacity  to  allow  the  peak  water 
requirements  to  be  met  within  16hours  of  power  per  day  which  is  the  current 
average  power  availability);  (ii)  organising  some  staggering  of  the  peak 
requirements  especially  land  preparation  in  case  of  severe  shortages;  (iii) 
preparation  of  emergency  contingency  plans  in  case  of  very  severe  power  cuts 
including  the  use  of  farmer  owned  portable  pumps,  existing  diesel  pumps  and 
tubewells; payments for emergency supplies would be paid for through the water 
charges, the details to be agreed with farmer pump owners.        
(xvi) 
(xv)  Ensuring environmental, social and gender safeguard compliances are maintained 
during implementation of investment works and regulation MOM activities. 
In  coordination  with  the  PMDC  develop  an  Project  Monitoring  and  Evaluation 
System (PME) including the necessary management information systems (MIS) to 
meet the needs of project management.  The PME would include, among other 
things: (i) GIS spatial database of infrastructure, assets and landholdings;(ii) time-
series  database  of  operational  data  including  rainfall,  water  levels  and  flows 
throughout  the  Level  1  to  3  system  including  pump  flows;(iii)  records  of 
maintenance  needs  and  actions  detailed  by their  nature,  type,  and  location;  (iv) 
record of all tariff and ISC revenues collected; (v) records of all OM expenses; and 
(vi) records of crops, yields and marketed surpluses based on the monitoring of a 
representative  sample  of  farmers  and  other  sampling  methods;  and  (vi)  cost 
recovery. 
(xvii)  Preparing  OM  Manuals  to  meet  all  OM  needs  and  procedures  based  on  an 
assessment of requirements as well as lessons learnt during the initial four years. 
The  manuals  will  be  the  key  documents  to  support  the  bidding  process  for  the 
Stage 2 IMO. Three manuals will be prepared: (i) scheme operational manual; (ii) 
scheme maintenance manual; and (iii) a scheme administration manual. 
b. 
Management of the Operation and Maintenance of Level 2 and 3 
The IMO will be required manage, operate and maintain the Level 2 and 3 infrastructures 
28. 
including: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii)  Maintenance of the pipe distribution systems. 
(iv)  Maintenance of the khals and other secondary infrastructure.  
OM of the LLPs and smart card metering system. 
Management of revenue collection using the smartcard metering systems. 
29. 
There are an estimated 450km of khal within the overall MIP project area, most but not all 
will be re-excavated under the project. The selection of priority khal for maintenance will be a key 
task of the IMO; optimising and efficient use of the limited maintenance funds will be essential.  
Priority will be given to ensuring access to irrigation water for the 17,000ha development area; 
other requirements will be to maintain adequate drainage capacity. The secondary infrastructure 
will be limited to the small structures (small hydraulic structures, bridges and protection works on 
the secondary and tertiary water courses currently owned by the BWDB (excluding the main river 
and coastal embankments). The IMO will also play an important role in controlling other structures 
98 
Appendix 3 
erected  or  to  be  erected  in  the  khal  waterways;  this  includes  structures  built  by  various 
government  departments  as  well  as  privately  owned  structures.  Special  action  is  required  for 
structures that are encroaching into the canal hydraulic section and are obstructing the irrigation 
flows  and/or  drainage  flows.  The  IMO  will  liaise  with  BWDB  and  the  local  government 
organizations  to  ensure  appropriate  design  of  new  infrastructure  and  removal  of  structures 
affecting the hydraulic flow. 
30. 
The estimated OM requirements for the Level 2 and 3 systems are summarized in Table 
7. The IMO will establish an escrow account for all the revenues and OM expenditures including 
the collection and allocation of the irrigation service charges (ISC). The IMO will be responsible 
for the technical and financial management for the operation and maintenance of the level 2 and 
level  3  irrigation  facilities.  The  IMO  Project  Manager  and  the  Deputy  Project  Manager  will  be 
signatories to the escrow account. The revenue for the OM will be derived from the cost recovery 
for  the  OM  derived  from  the  water  revenues  from  the  smart  card  systems  as  well  other 
supplementary revenue systems to be established. The allocation of funds for OM must follow 
the approved Annual Work Plan and would follow the administration procedures defined in the 
Project  Management  and  Administration  Manual.  The  payments  for  OM  work  will  include:  (i) 
electricity payments; (ii) pump operator fees; (iii) smartcard vendor fees; (iv) maintenance of the 
Level  2  and  3 irrigation  systems;  and  (v)  other  miscellaneous  payments  relating  to  the  field 
activities. During stage 1 all the operational costs of the IMO including staff costs, transport, office 
costs, training and meetings would be paid through the IMO contract. The IMO will be required to 
prepare  independently  audited  accounts  which  will  incorporated  into  the  annual  report  to  be 
prepared  by  30th  of  June  each  year  and  presented  to  the  Annual  General  Meeting  of 
Implementation Coordination Committee.

Activity 2: Construction Supervision of MIP Investment Works 
a. 
Scope of services 
The  construction  contracts  for  the  MIP  rehabilitation  will  be  let  by  BWDB  through  the 
39. 
nominated Project Director who will act as the "Employer". The BWDB will appoint the IMO as the 
resident engineer with full responsibilities for the supervision of the construction contracts under 
the IMIP. The General Manager of the Irrigation Management Operator, or the Deputy General 
Manager in the absence of the General Manager will be the nominated “ ResidentEngineer". 
40. 
The  IMO  will  be  responsible  for  the  supervision  of  construction  of  all  the  investment 
contracts under IMIP (including the coastal embankment, khal excavation, rehabilitation and new 
structures,  pipe  distribution/pumps/prepaid  meters,  upgrading  of  the  electricity  network, 
rehabilitation of offices).  The proposed works for MIP are summarised in Table 8below. Payments 
would be made by BWDB based on progress certificates by the IMO. The IMO staff supported 
surveyors will develop a very high level of supervision to international ISO or equivalent standards 
which can form a model for future supervision under the IMIP. The construction time schedule is 
as shown in Figure 4.

Activity 3: Participatory Design of the Level 3 Distribution Systems 
a. 
Scope of services 
45. 
The  IMO  is  responsible  for  preparing  the  detailed  engineering  design,  bill  of  quantities 
(BOQ), engineering cost estimates, specifications and contract bidding documents for the Level 
3 distribution  systems  for the  remaining  15,000ha  which includes: (i) the  LLPs  and associated 
civil structures; (ii) the buried pipe distribution network including storage tanks, pressure risers, 
106 
Appendix 3 
and outlet valves and associated civil structures; (iii) expansion and necessary upgrading of the 
electricity distribution network; and (iv) installation of the smartcard prepaid meters and control 
systems. The designs should generally follow the design criteria for the advance designs already 
prepared for the initial 2,000ha. Upgrading of the electricity will require following the requirements 
and  specifications  of  the  Rural  Electrification  Board  (REB).  The  IMO  will  prepare  the  layout 
designs of the distribution systems with participation of the farmers, landowners, local water user 
associations, ICC and local communities. The participatory approach to be followed by the IMO 
during  the  design  consultation  process  will  be  firstly  agreed  with  ICC  and  BWDB.  A  tentative 
schedule for the design and implementation of Level 3 works is shown in Figure 4 which shows 
the  design  and  implementation  of  investment  works  taking  a  phased  approach  with  the  initial 
2,000 ha systems being implemented in the first year followed by three phases of participatory 
design and implementation of 5,000ha units of investment works. The preparation of the tender 
documents and the tendering will be implemented by the PMU with the support of the PMDC.

The design process will generally follow: 
(i) 
Review of existing data and reports made available to the consultant including: (a) 
available topographical information and digital elevation models; (b) layout map of 
MIP showing the reservoir, rivers, khal, roads, etc., and boundaries of project area; 
(c) design criteria for the buried pipe system including cropping patterns, and crop 
water requirements and design duties; and (d) specifications and a blank (sample) 
Bill of Quantities. 
Identification of pumped systems for about 15,000 ha (net) irrigation based on the 
current  layout  of  pumps  and  farm  distribution  systems  in  consultation  with  the 
farmers and needs for improvements. The number of systems will depend on their 
size but is likely to be about 600 assuming an average of 25ha/system. Selection 
of the schemes to be taken up for investment will include a technical assessment 
of the viabilities including; avoiding areas where there is risk of flood damage, good 
soils, avoiding schemes where khal siltation will be very problematic, minimising 
the  costs  of  the  electrical  interconnections,  minimising  the  length  of  pipelines, 
avoiding high pumping lifts etc.. 
Organise and undertake consultations with farmers, landowners, land holders, ICC 
and  WUAs,  including  detailed  stakeholders’  identification  for  consultations, 
providing  awareness  campaigns,  organising  meetings,  and  signing  of 
Memorandum  of  Understanding  (MOU)  for  every  system  for  which  detailed 
designs  are  prepared.  On  signing  of  the  MOU’s,  each  farmer  must  commit  to 
making an upfront payment of BTK1, 500 prior to construction of the buried pipe 
systems. Payment would be made at the time of mobilisation of the contractor to 
the IMO who will deposit the payments into the escrow account. 
Preparing  detailed  engineering  designs  of  each  distribution  system  including 
preparation  of  drawings,  bill  of  quantities,  and  cost  estimates 
that  are 
disaggregated for each scheme. Drawings shall be done showing for: (a) layouts 
of  the  khal,  pumps  and  pipe  systems;  (b)  long  sections  for  systems;  (c)  all  for 
associated  civil  structures;  and  (d)  all  associated  electro  and  mechanical 
equipment. However, except for the header tank and any other one-off structures, 
all drawings should be standardised as much as possible. 
Assessment  of  required  electric  power  supply  and  LLP  requirements  including 
pump and motor capacity, control systems, and power and energy requirements

Activity 4: Agricultural Support Services, Pilot Cost Recovery Activities, and 
Implementation of Training and Awareness Programs 
a. 
Scope of services 
48. 
Provisional  sums  have  been  allocated  to  support  this  work  and  the  IMO  is  required  to 
arrange the engagement of appropriate organizations to implement Activity 4 as sub-contractors. 
Agricultural  Support  Services  are  a  responsibility  of  the  IMO  with  the  objective  of 
49. 
enabling  small  farmers  to  take  up  more  efficient  water  use,  crop  diversification  through 
sustainable  practices,  and  developing  opportunities  for  commercial  farming  and  agribusiness. 
The intention is for IMO to offer a nucleus of localised self-financing support services either directly 
or by interacting and engaging with existing government and non-government organizations. Pilot 
programs  will  be  established  for  MIP  under  the  Project  to  assess  viabilities  and  response 
agriculture support programs before up-scaling under the next phase IMO. 
The  objective  of  the  agricultural  services  is  to  directly  involve  the  IMO  in  agriculture 
50. 
extension services and providing technical support to farmers. The IMO will be required to prepare 
an annual training plan which, on approval by PMU, will be implemented by the IMO. The training 
will focus on, among other things: optimizing water use, expanding the service area, promoting 
and  facilitating crop  diversification,  and  increasing  cropping  intensity.  The result  of the training 
should raise farmer incomes and therefore their ability to pay the ISC and for irrigation services. 
The  training  program  will  be  implemented  using  both  in-house  training  capacities  of  the  IMO, 
BWDB  and  DOA  as  well  as  subcontracting  to  local,  regional  and  national  qualified  training 
institutes and individual specialists. 
51. 
Development of Pilot Cost Recovery Activities: Opportunities for increasing the cost 
recovery  of  providing  irrigation  services,  over  and  above  revenue  from  water  charges,  will  be 
explored to minimize the burden on farmers as well as minimize or avoid the need for Government 
subsidies. There are various opportunities that can be researched including, but not limited to: 
leasing of BWDB land assets; leasing of areas within the khal, rivers and reservoir for fisheries 
including  stocking;  royalties  from  sand  abstraction;  and  agriculture  support  enterprises.  Their 
concepts  and  viabilities  will  be  studied  by  the  IMO  and  presented  to  BWDB  and  ICC  for 
endorsement.  The most promising,  viable  and  sustainable opportunities would be  taken  up  as 
pilots by the IMO. A provisional sum within the IMO contract has been allocated to support this 
work.  
52. 
Awareness and Training: The need for a strong program of awareness, communication 
and engagement with stakeholders has been identified as a key role for the IMO. This component 
is  designed to  provide  continued  support for the  stakeholders  including BWDB,  Department  of 
Agriculture, Local Government, Water Management Organizations, ICC, and most important the 
farmers  to  achieve  the  targets  described  in  the  project  design.  The  roles  of  these  supporting 
organizations are critical and how the stakeholders can work most effectively with the IMO is an 
essential requirement. Selected and focused training will be provided by the IMP and will include 
a  mix  of  informal  on-the-job  training  and  formal  institutional  training  to  key  stakeholders.  The 
mechanisms to establish and develop effective engagement with the project stakeholder will form 
a key part of the IMOs responsibilities as part of the awareness and training program. The IMO 
will prepare and submit an awareness and training plan to the PMU, which on their approval, will 
be implemented under the IMO. It is anticipated that training and awareness would be a mix of; 
(i) activities implemented directly by the IMO staff without additional cost, (ii) direct engagement 
of individuals or procurement of materials to support the training which would be reimbursed at 
Appendix 3 
 109 
cost; (iii) subcontracted to third party organizations and (iv) establishment and development of 
training financed through commercial organizations. 
53. 
The  training  plan  and  program  must  develop  new  initiatives  to  ensure  the  long-term 
sustainability  of  training,  including  initiatives  to  reduce  the  dependencies  on  project  funded 
training.  The outline requirements for communication and awareness are described in the Project 
Administration Manual (PAM). 
b. 
Tasks Required for Bid Submission 
54. 
A methodology and program of work for undertaking these activities will be submitted as 
part of the bid submission. The Bidder will provide the method it will adopt to identify and carry 
out or subcontract: (i) agricultural support services; (ii) training and awareness programs including 
initiatives  to  effectively  engage  with  the  stakeholders  aligned  with  the  Project  communication 
strategy; (iii) pilot cost recovery activities; and (iv) capacity building and capacity strengthening 
programs of the main stakeholders. The Bidder will provide an outline work program and staffing 
schedule. 
DELIVERABLES 
The deliverables of the IMO contract will be in two parts: (i) reporting deliverables; and (ii) 
55. 
project deliverables. 
A.

efficient  water  use  and  improved  cropping  through  sustainable 
practices and developing opportunities for commercial farming. 
The fund will be used to support farmer training, crop demonstrations 
in close coordination with the Department of Extension and BWDB.  
Opportunities for increasing the cost recovery of providing irrigation 
services,  over  and  above  revenue  from  water  charges,  will  be 
explored to  minimize the burden  on farmers as well  as minimize or 
avoid the need for Government subsidies. Concepts and viabilities will

To build on the existing skills of the BWDB staff or other Government 
staff at MIP.  BWDB or other agencies should allow appropriate skilled 
personnel to provide services to the IMO on 'lien39' with remuneration 
of the staff to be paid by the IMO as per the organizations own salary 
structure.    The  period  of  lien  would  be  guided  by  the  government's 
existing rules.  
The IMO would review the qualifications and experience of potential 
staff and prepare proposals for secondment. Recruitment of the staff 
on lien would be initiated at the time of mobilization of the IMO and 
would be outside the bidding process. Bidders would however present 
proposals  in  their  bid  how  the  staff  on  lien  could  be  effectively 
incorporated into the IMO. The IMO would have the rights whether or 
not to accept any Government staff on lien and also has the right to 
terminate the lien agreement for any person assigned to the IMO by 
providing  30  days’  notice.  The  provisional  sum  would  used  to  pay 
seconded staff salaries. 
D. 
ADDITIONAL REMUNERATION 
In addition to the remuneration paid according to the standard ADB time-based contract, 
78. 
the IMO will also receive management fee and performance-based bonus payments.

remuneration package would be provided by the new/host organization. 
124 
Appendix 3 
1.  Management Fees 
79. 
The  IMO  may  charge  a  management  fee  of  up  to  5%  of  the  total  value  of  additional 
procurement activities as listed in Table 13. The management fees will be presented as a part of 
the Bidder’s financial proposal. The estimated value of additional procurement is USD1,788,000. 
80. 
The  IMO  will  manage  the  project  Water  Revenue  and  OM  Expenditure  Account.  The 
following routine payments will be made solely from revenue collected from the irrigation service 
tariffs: (i) electricity tariffs; (ii) pump operator fees; (iii) smartcard vendor fees; (iv) maintenance of 
the  Level  2  and  3  distribution  system;  and  (v)  and  other  miscellaneous field  expenditures.  No 
management fee will be payable for these activities. The IMO management costs including staff 
costs,  office  costs,  training,  transport  will  all  be  paid  under  the IMO  contract  and  not  from  the 
Water Revenue and OM Expenditure Account. 
81. 
The consultant shall maintain two accounts; (i) a consultants account that will be related 
to  all  payments  in  relation  to  the  contract  with  the  BWDB  for  the  C-IMO  for  Muhuri  Irrigation 
Project; (ii)  an  escrow  account  which  will  be maintained for  all  the  operation  and  maintenance 
costs relating to level 2 and 3 and will be paid for from revenue from water tariffs and other cost 
recovery sources.  
The consultant will be responsible for meeting the cost of items for the consultants account 
82. 
whether or not the consultant’s remuneration is sufficient to cover the cost, or whether or not the 
cost was anticipated, and whether or not the consultant has the funds available. 
The escrow account will be funded by payments made in advance by the farmers through 
83. 
the prepaid meters to meet the cost of operation and maintenance of the level 2 and 3 irrigation. 
The general manager and the deputy general manager will be the only authorized signatories to 
this account. The consultant will work with the BWDB and the Water User Associations to ensure 
the tariff is set at an appropriate level to meet the OM costs. The tariff would be reviewed annually 
and endorsed by the BWDB and the WUAs through the Implementation Coordination Committee. 
The consultant would not have any financial liability for any shortfall of the funds in the escrow 
account. The exception to this would be if it is shown that the consultant had used the escrow 
account without authorization for any personal gain or for expenditures outside the approved work 
plan or authorized amendments to the annual work plan.  
2.  Performance Based Remuneration 
a. 
Basis of Remuneration 
84. 
To enhance the delivery of the IMO‘s outputs and the outcome of the project, additional 
payments will be paid to the IMO if key milestones or Key performance indicators (KPI) are met. 
The objective of the performance-based remuneration is to support the serious engagement of 
the  IMO  as  a  stakeholder  in  the  MIP  and  shares  some  of  the  benefit  of  achieving  the  project 
targets according to the time schedule. Table 14 presents the Performance Targets and Criterion 
Values. 
Payments  will  be  triggered  based  on  the  measurement  of  milestones/KPI  as  described 
85. 
below:  
(i)  The  performance-based  remuneration  will  not  exceed 
the  equivalent  of 
USD250,000 over the period of the contract. 
Appendix 3 
 125 
(ii)  Only in exceptional circumstances will he performance-based remuneration in any 
one  contract  year  exceed  the  equivalent  of  USD50,000  (the  Maximum  Annual 
Performance Remuneration [APR]). 
(iii) The actual amount paid to the IMO shall be determined by the extent by which the 
IMO achieves the performance criteria set out in the performance indicator tables 
and  by  the  application  of  the  calculations  set  out  in  the  performance  procedure 
notes for the applicable contract year.  
(iv) The  performance-based  remuneration  would  be  assessed  at  the  end  of  every 
contract year. 
(v)  All  the  activities  of  the  IMO  are  to  varying  degrees  influenced  by  externalities 
outside the control of the IMO. The payments of the KPIs have been designed to 
be 
triggered  when  selected  key  project  deliverables  are  achieved.  Key 
management  tasks  of  the  IMO  include  working  with  the  various  stakeholders  to 
take  a  lead  role  in  ensuring  that  the  various  the  outputs  defined  in  the  project 
design targets are met according to the schedule. 
(vi) The milestones/KPIs have been carefully selected and designed so that they can 
be easily verified; they also include a mix of more complex deliverables which are 
influenced  by  external  factors  as  well  as  ones  with  less  external  influence.  
Criterion  values  have  been  set  to  allow  for  some  level  of  delays  or  unforeseen 
circumstances. 
(vii) Appropriate  weightings  have  been  assigned  to  each  milestone/KPI  to  reflect  its 
importance.   
(viii) 
If the amount of the Annual Performance Remuneration (APR) is equal or 
less than zero, the IMO shall neither receive nor pay any amount to the EA for the 
applicable contract year.  
(ix) Except  in  exceptional  circumstances ( such  as  delays  very  substantially outside 
the control of the IMO) whereas judged by the EA if the IMO fails to achieve the 
maximum annual performance remuneration in any one year the shortfall will not 
be available to the IMO in subsequent contract years.  
(x)  The milestones/KPIs and the performance values would be discussed and agreed 
during  the  contract  negotiations.  Although  the  KPIs  would  not  change  some 
refinements to the measurement can be considered during the project period.  
b. 
Method  for  Calculating  Performance  Based  Remuneration  in  Each 
Contract Year 
86. 
The basis of calculating the Performance Based Remuneration shall be as follows. 
Annual 
Remuneration 
payable = 
Performance 
(APR) 
3.5-  Composite  Score  X 
      2.5 
Maximum 
Performance 
Remuneration 
Annual 
126 
Appendix 3 
87. 
The composite score for each contract year shall be as follows. 
Composite Score = 
Total of All Weighted Scores for the Performance Criteria 
Where: 
(i)  The weighted score for each performance criterion equals the indicator weight x indicator value. 
(ii)  The performance indicator value is measured from 'Excellent' to 'Poor' with corresponding values as 
set out in Table 10. The raw scores range from 1 for excellent to 5 for poor. For simplicity 9raw scores 
are considered 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5 and 5. 
(iii) If the actual performance is in between the performance standards for two indicator  values, then the 
score for that performance shall be rounded to the nearest 0.5.  
(iv) A composite score of 3.5 (between good and fair) is the cut off for performance remuneration, a score 
of above 3.5 results a zero-composite score  
(v)  A composite score 'excellent' would have a composite score of 1 and would qualify for the full maximum 
annual performance remuneration.

88. 
Table15.  The  Maximum  Annual  Performance  Remuneration  is  USD50,000.  Then  the  annual 
performance remuneration payable to the IMO in respect of the sample year is calculated as: 
Annual Performance Remuneration Payable= (3.5-2.975)/2.5 x USD50,000 
=USD10,500 
89. 
The annual performance remuneration will be assessed as part of the annual report to be 
submitted by the IMO at the end of June each year. The end of June corresponds with financial 
year as well as the end of the Rabi period.

APPENDIX 4: INDICATIVE STATEMENT OF AUDIT NEEDS 
A. 
Background 
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Government of Bangladesh (GOB) have 
1. 
entered  into  a  Loan  and  additional  Loan  Agreement  whereby,  ADB  shall  provide  (i)  a  loan 
equivalent to $41.5 million and (ii) additional financing loan of $13.5 million for the purpose 
of financing civil works, materials, equipment, consulting services and project management. 
The GOB shall contribute about $8.7 million against these funding. The project will be carried 
out  through  the  Bangladesh  Water  Development  Board  (BWDB)  through  its  PMU.  BWDB 
shall maintain separate books of account for the project including all receipts from the ADB 
loan and additional loan and GOB as all project expenditure is financed out of ADB loan and 
additional loan proceeds as well as GOB counterpart contribution.  
B. 
Financial Reporting and Audit Requirements 
BWDB  will  prepare  consolidated  project  financial  statements  on  a  cash  basis  of 
2. 
accounting, in accordance with its Financial Administrative Regulations (FAR). This shall not be 
construed to refer to the financial statements of BWDB as a whole.  
3. 
The  audit  of  the  project  financial  statements  shall  be  carried  out  by  the  Foreign-Aided 
Project  Audit  Directorate  (FAPAD)  within  the  Office  of  the  Comptroller  and  Auditor  General  of 
Bangladesh  (OCAG)  in  accordance  with  OCAG’s  Audit  Manual  and,  as  supplemented  by  this 
Statement of Audit needs. The auditor will review that the funds received from all sources and 
expenditures  incurred  by  BWDB  during  the  reporting  period  are  as  per  agreed  terms  and 
conditions.  
4. 
BWDB will submit to ADB audited project financial statements for each fiscal year, within 
6  months  of  the  end  of  the  fiscal  year  in  English.  A  complete  set  of  audited  project  financial 
statements includes: 
(i) 
Audit report including separate Audit opinions on the following:  
whether the project financial statements present an accurate and fair view 
or  are  presented  fairly,  in  all  material  respects,  in  accordance  with  the 
applicable financial reporting standards; and 
whether the proceeds of the loan and additional loan were used only for 
the purpose of the project. 
(ii) 
Project financial statements consisting of the following: 
Statement of Cash Receipts and Payments 
Statement of Budget vs. Actuals 
Statement of Disbursement by Financing Source 
Statement  of  Disbursement  Claimed  Under  Statement  of  Expenditure 
(SOE) Procedure 
Statement of Imprest/Advance account 
summary of accounting policies and explanatory notes 
(iii) 
A management letter. 
To support timely submission, unaudited project financial statements should be submitted 
5. 
to the OCAG/FAPAD for audit within 3 months of the end of the fiscal year.  
134 
Appendix 4 
C. 
Specific Audit Needs 
6. 
The audit would cover the entire Project, i.e., covering all sources of funds including ADB 
loan, ADB additional loan and the GOB and all application of funds incurred by BWDB as part of 
the  project.  The  audit  scope  will  also  include  Direct  Payments  made  by  ADB  to  suppliers, 
contractors a service provider (DPs). 
7. 
The  Project  Director  shall  provide  all  pertinent  information  to  the  Auditors  including 
preservation and use of resources procured and its reflection in the project accounts, so as to 
facilitate  comprehensive  audit  coverage.  The  audits  should  be  carried  out  annually  from 
commencement of the Project. The audit for the first year should also cover transactions, which 
occurred from the commencement of the project, i.e. till the end of the fiscal year. In case the 
period is less than 6 months, GOB may agree with ADB to provide APFS from the commencement 
of the Project to the end of the subsequent fiscal year. 
8. 
The auditor will provide assurance as to whether the project financial statements present 
a  true  and  fair  view  of  the  receipts  and  expenditures,  or  are  presented  fairly,  in  all  material 
respects, in accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework. The auditor will also 
provide a separate opinion on whether the proceeds of the loan and additional loan were used 
only for the purpose of the project. 
9. 
In  addition,  ADB  will  also  require  an  assessment  by  the  auditors  of  compliance  with 
provisions  of  the  financing  agreement  with  ADB,  especially  those  relating  to  accounting  and 
financial  matters.  Positive  assurance  should  be  provided  in  accordance  with  International 
Standard of Supreme Audit Institutions – 4100 on Compliance Audit. An audit opinion shall be 
provided that will inter alia include verification that:  
i. 
All  funds,  including  counterpart  funds,  have  been  used  in  accordance  with  the 
conditions  of  the  loan  agreements,  with  due  regard  to  economy  and  efficiency, 
and only for the purposes for which the funds were provided; 
ii.  With  respect  to  SOEs,  (a)  adequate  supporting  documentation  has  been 
maintained to support claims to ADB for reimbursement of expenditures incurred; 
and (b) except for ineligible expenditures as detailed in the audit observations, if 
any, appended to this audit report, expenditures are eligible for financing under 
the Loan Agreement; 
The  Imprest  Account  gives  a  true  and  fair  view  of  the  receipts  collected  and 
payments made during the year ended [insert date], and (ii) these receipts, and 
payments  support  the  Imprest  Account  Liquidation/  replenishments  during  the 
year. 
iii. 
ADB would expect that the auditors should advise a calendar for discussion/review of audit 
10. 
observations (particularly any serious matters) through tri-partite meetings and review meetings 
to  facilitate  executive  follow-up  on  audit  observations  and  recommendations.  Moreover,  ADB 
would need a review of actions taken on the recommendations presented in the previous audit 
report on the progress made. 
D. 
Project Financial Statements (PFSs) 
The consolidated Project Financial Statement (PFSs) shall be prepared in accordance with 
11. 
international accounting best principles and practices as well as government's accounting laws and 
regulations. These should include:

BWDB. 
13. 
Project  Financial  Statements  shall  provide  sufficient  level  of  detail  to  identify  types  of 
expenditures  as  identified  in  the  allocation  table  of  the  Loan  Agreement;  namely  civil  works, 
consulting services, training, equipment, etc. 
14. 
Draft  template  for  the  project  Financial  Statements  have  been  included  in  the  project 
administration manual (PAM) to facilitate compliance with ADB’s requirements. Please note that 
any financial statement template is a working draft, which may require adjustment based on the 
actual activities of the Project. 
E. 
Management Letter 
In  addition  to  the  audit  report,  ADB  will  require  a  separate  management  letter.  The 
15. 
management letter should specifically: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
(v) 
Give  comments  and  observations  on  the  notes  to  the  accounts,  accounting 
records, systems, and internal controls that were examined during the course of 
the audit; 
Identify  specific  deficiencies  and  areas  of  weakness  in  systems  and  internal 
controls  and  make  recommendations  for  their  improvement  including  MOE 
response to the identified deficiencies; 
Communicate  matters  that  have  come  to  attention  during  the  audit  which  might 
have a significant impact on the implementation of the Project; and 
Bring  to  GOB  and  ADB  attention  any  other  matters  that  the  auditor  considers 
pertinent.

•   When audited project financial statements are not received by the due date, ADB will write to the executing agency 
advising  that  (i)  the  audit  documents  are  overdue;  and  (ii)  if  they  are  not  received  within  the  next  six  months, 
requests for new contract awards and disbursement such as new replenishment of imprest accounts, processing 
of new reimbursement, and issuance of new commitment letters will not be processed.

withhold processing of requests for new contract awards and disbursement such as new replenishment of imprest 
accounts,  processing  of  new  reimbursement  and  issuance  of  new  commitment  letters.  ADB  will  (i)  inform  the 
executing agency of ADB’s actions; and (ii) advise that the loan may be suspended if the audit documents are not
