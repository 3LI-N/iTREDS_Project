1.  The  project  administration  manual  (PAM)  describes  the  essential  administrative  and 
management requirements to implement the project on time, within budget, and in accordance 
with the government and the Asian Development Bank’s (ADB) policies and procedures. The 
PAM  should  include  references  to  all  available  templates  and  instructions  either  through 
linkages to relevant URLs or directly incorporated in the PAM. 
2.  The Zixing City Government (ZCG), the executing agency; and the Zixing City Urban and Rural 
Environmental Protection Investment and Financing Center (ZIFC), the implementing agency, 
are wholly responsible for the implementation of  the ADB-financed projects, as agreed jointly 
between  the  borrower  and  ADB,  and  in  accordance  with  the  government’s  and  ADB  policies 
and procedures. The ADB staff is responsible to support implementation, including compliance 
by  ZCG  and  ZIFC  of  their  obligations  and  responsibilities  for  project  implementation,  in 
accordance with ADB policies and procedures. 
3.  At  loan  negotiations,  the  borrower  and  ADB  shall  agree  to  the  PAM  and  ensure  consistency 
with  the  loan  agreement.  Such  agreement  shall  be  reflected  in  the  minutes  of  the  loan 
negotiations. In the event of any discrepancy or contradiction between the PAM and the  loan 
agreement, the provisions of the loan agreement shall prevail. 
4.  After  the  ADB  Board  approval  of  the  project’s  report  and  recommendations  of  the  President, 
changes in implementation arrangements are subject to agreement and approval pursuant to 
relevant government  and ADB  administrative  procedures  (including the  project  administration 
instructions) and upon such approval they will be subsequently incorporated in the PAM.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
One  of  the  greatest  challenges  facing  water  management  in  the  People’s  Republic  of 
1. 
China (PRC) relates to freshwater lakes, as many of them are severely polluted. Since the mid-
1990s,  the Government of  the  PRC  has  made substantial  efforts  to  address the  problem,  with 
emphasis  on  three  lakes—Chao,  Dianchi,  and  Tai  lakes—but  the  water  quality  of  these  lakes 
has not improved significantly. The government realized the importance of pollution prevention 
in  lakes  by  drawing  lessons  from  the  rehabilitation  of  polluted  lakes,  including  the  Chao, 
Dianchi, and Tai lakes, which were rehabilitated at very high cost. Experience has shown that it 
is very difficult and ineffective to restore water quality in large lakes once they are polluted.  
2. 
Located  in  south  Hunan  Province,  Dongjiang  Lake  is  a  reservoir  formed  after  the 
construction  of  Dongjiang  Dam  in  1986  on  the  Leishui  River,  a  tributary  of  the  Xiang  River. 
Dongjiang  Lake  is  a  multipurpose  reservoir  for  hydropower,  flood  control,  water  supply,  and 
irrigation.  It  has  a  surface  area  of  160  square kilometers  (km2)  and  a  total  storage  capacity  of 
about 8.12 billion cubic meters (m3). The catchment area of the Dongjiang Lake is 4,719 km2.   
the  government’s  eco-compensation  policy 
3. 
The  government’s  priority  is  to  protect  the  water  resources  of  Dongjiang  Lake  from 
pollution.  Dongjiang  Lake  has  been  selected  as  one  of  five  river  basins  for  nationwide  pilot 
testing  of 
the  Asian 
Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  provided  continuous  support  since  2009.  Dongjiang  Lake  was 
prioritized  for  support  in  the  National  Plan  for  Relatively  Good-Quality  Lake  Ecological  and 
Environmental  Protection,  2013–2020,  jointly  released  by  the  Ministry  of  Environmental 
Protection, the Ministry of Finance, and the National Development and Reform Commission.  
framework, 
to  which 
4. 
Dongjiang  Lake  is  a  strategic  water  source  for  supporting  resource-saving  and 
environment-friendly social development in Hunan Province. Maintaining healthy environmental 
services  in  Dongjiang  Lake  is  vital  to  achieving  sustainable  development  of  the  Xiang  River 
basin, one of the major regions of the government’s Yangtze River Economic Belt Initiative. The 
Xiang  River  basin  is  home  to  about  40  million  people  and  accounts  for  over  70%  of  Hunan 
Province’s  total  gross  domestic  production.  In  addition  to  supplying  water  to  Chenzhou 
Municipality  and  Zixing  City,  Dongjiang  Lake  serves  as  a  backup  water  source  for  Hunan 
Province’s  major  cities  of  Changsha,  Xiangtan,  and  Zhuzhou  in  the  Xiang  River  basin  to 
improve the water security of 13 million people in these cities. The lake’s large storage capacity 
greatly improves flood and drought management for the downstream cities and navigation of the 
downstream Xiang River. It also helps dilute water pollution in the downstream of Xiang River by 
releasing water.   
Hunan  Provincial  Government 
local  governments  have  prioritized 
(HPG)  and 
5. 
environmental  protection  of  Dongjiang  Lake.  Protection  zones  have  been  established  in  the 
Dongjiang Lake basin in accordance with the provincial-approved Dongjiang Lake Basin Water 
Environmental  Protection  Regulation  (2002).  The  regulation 
the 
development  of  the  basin  and  restricts  various  activities  in  different  protection  zones  that  may 
cause adverse impact on the water environment. Since 2002, HPG and local governments have 
invested  nearly  CNY1  billion  in  protection  of  the  lake,  including  closure  of  mines,  removal  of 
cage  fishing,  ship  renovation  and  improvement,  and  job  training  for  nonfarming  opportunities. 
Continued  efforts  by  HPG,  local  governments,  and  local  people  help  maintain  the  good  water 
quality of the lake to meet national standards for drinking water sources.   
imposes  controls  on 
2 
However,  heavy  agricultural  activities  and  growing  urbanization  in  the  lake  basin  have 
6. 
posed greater risks of water pollution in the lake. The water quality of Dongjiang Lake has been 
deteriorating  since  the  1990s  as  a  result  of  agricultural  nonpoint  source  pollution,  inadequate 
wastewater  treatment  facilities,  lack  of  solid  waste  management,  and  significant  soil  erosion 
around the lake. The trophic state index for Dongjiang Lake was 25.8 in 1991 and 29.5 in 2010.1 
Although the 2010 trophic state index is acceptable for drinking purposes, the value in 2010 was 
significantly  higher  than  in  1991.  A  review  of  15  monitoring  stations  from  1991  to  2010  has 
shown that Dongjiang Lake is generally in the oligotrophic to mesotrophic conditions. However, 
among the  15  locations,  water quality  in 12  locations  was poorer  in 2010  than  in 1991. Water 
quality fluctuations are random and without a significant seasonal pattern or synchronization, so 
the pollution challenges are not likely from a single source. 
Point and nonpoint source pollution. Agriculture is the major source of pollution in the 
7. 
lake  catchment,  accounting  for  about  48%  of  the  total  pollutants.  Other  sources  include 
domestic wastewater (25%), industry (14%), water transportation (9%), and tourism (4%). Every 
year,  the  pollutants  discharged  into  the  Dongjiang  Lake  area  contain  9,038  tons  of  chemical 
oxygen  demand,  1,741  tons  of  ammonia,  and  363  tons  of  total  phosphorus.  Only  a  few 
townships  have  wastewater  treatment  facilities,  and  the  wastewater  from  most  townships  and 
villages scattered around the lake is directly discharged to the streams that drain to the lake.   
Solid waste collection and treatment facilities for townships and villages have yet  to be 
8. 
established in the basin. As the population increases, garbage production also rises. Only a few 
villages have household trash collectors or collection bins in designated locations. Furthermore, 
public  collection  tanks  are  often  not  emptied  on  time  and  overflow  of  rubbish  is  common. 
Consequently,  garbage  is  discarded  on  roadsides  and  open  spaces  around  houses.  This  not 
only has an adverse visual impact on the surrounding environment, but also seriously threatens 
the  health  of  local  villagers.  Because  of  the  lack  of  transfer  and  disposal,  rubbish  has  been 
stacked on unused land. Some villages burn their rubbish, causing significant adverse impacts 
to the surrounding environment and the living conditions of local residents.  
9. 
Inadequate  water  supply  facilities.  A  large  number  of  residents,  particularly  rural 
communities in Zixing City, do not have access to piped water supply, although they are close to 
the lake. They use water drawn from various sources without proper treatment. This is not only 
a burden for  the residents,  but  also  exposes them  to  health risks  and,  in turn,  affects  the  lake 
water  quality.  The  existing  water  treatment  plants  in  the  towns  of  Zixing  City  use  surrounding 
small-scale  water  reservoirs  and  mountain  springs  or  rivers  as  water  sources,  but  these  are 
subject  to  seasonal  changes  and  weak  self-purification  capacity  during  drought.  The  villages 
beyond  the  service  area  of  existing  water  supply  plants  are  served  by  small-scale  temporary 
water  supplies,  which  have  lower  safety  standards.  Most  rural  residents  drink  well  water  or 
stream  water  of  poor  sanitary  quality,  especially  during  rainy  seasons  when  wells  are  often 
flooded,  seriously  polluted,  and  of  extremely  turbid  water  quality.  Furthermore,  some  rural 
villages are located within high-fluorine and high-arsenic areas.  
10. 
Low  flood  protection  level.  With  the  large  flood  storage  capacity  of  Dongjiang  Lake, 
the downstream of the lake has been protected from major floods. However, the flood protection 
of  the  upstream  and  surrounding  areas  of  the  lake  is  low,  with  capacity  only  against  flood 
recurrence of about 2 years. The rivers have been frequently impacted by floods over the years, 
resulting  in  river  blockage  and  bank  erosion  that  reduce  flood  discharge  capacity.  Most  of  the 
1  The trophic state index is a measure of how much nutrient, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, is in a lake or other 
body of water. A lake can be put into one of three possible classes: oligotrophic, mesotrophic, or eutrophic. 
3 
rivers  do  not  have  bank  protection,  which  results  in  erosion  of  neighboring  farmland  during 
floods  and  causes  sedimentation  in  the  rivers.  Frequent  floods  have  brought  extreme  impacts 
on  the  lives  and  production  of  the  riparian  villagers.  Farmers  particularly  suffer  from  loss  of 
properties,  farmlands,  or  even  life.  For  example,  a  severe  flood  in  July  2006  caused 
142 casualties, 2,563 collapsed houses, and 200 hectares (ha) of damaged farmland.  
11. 
Soil erosion and ecosystem. Limited livelihood and employment opportunities and lack 
of arable land result in the conversion of slopes for farming by local communities. In the areas 
around  Dongjiang  Lake,  soil  erosion  is  intensifying  and  occurrence  of  natural  disasters  is 
increasing.  Soil  erosion  in  the  project  area  covers  1,087  km2  and  average  annual  soil  erosion 
reaches  4 million  tons,  causing  river  siltation  in  some  sections  of  the  rivers  and  even  forming 
sand deltas at some river estuaries to Dongjiang Lake. The 55,000 ha of national and provincial 
public  forest  around  the  lake  area  greatly  contribute  to  water  and  soil  conservation.  However, 
fires  and  pest  disasters  often  occur  because  of  the  low  quality  of  the  forest,  and  the  eco-
efficiency  of  the  forest  is  relatively  low.  The  lake  areas  are  abundant  with  bamboo  resources, 
and can be a major source of income for local residents while protecting the environment.  
12. 
Inadequate  institutional  coordination  and  capacity.  Dongjiang  Lake  basin  covers 
Zixing City and the counties of Guidong, Rucheng, and Yizhang in Chenzhou Municipality. The 
Dongjiang  Lake  environmental  protection  bureau  was  established  under  the  Chenzhou 
Municipal  Government  in  2003  to  coordinate  environmental  protection  in  the  basin.  However, 
the  bureau  does  not  have  (i)  adequate  tools  and  capacity  for  coordinating  and  monitoring 
environmental  protection  activities  in  the  entire  basin,  or  (ii)  an  ecological  and  environmental 
monitoring  and  management  information  system.  It  needs  to  be  empowered  with  adequate 
human  and financial  resources to assume  responsibility  for  environmental  management  of  the 
entire lake basin.  
Strategic  fit.  The  project  is  consistent  with  the  government’s  goal  of  building  a 
13. 
through  regionally  balanced  and  environmentally 
harmonious  and  prosperous  society 
sustainable  growth.  The  project  supports  the  government’s  Yangtze  River  Economic  Belt 
Initiative  to  construct  an ecological  ecosystem  corridor  along the  river  by improving  watershed 
management, water pollution control and prevention, and ecological rehabilitation.2 It conforms 
to the strategic priorities of ADB’s Midterm Review of Strategy 2020,3 and the Water Operational 
Plan,  2011–2020  to  increase  coverage  and  improve  services  for  water  supply  and  sanitation, 
and promote integrated water resources management (IWRM).4 
Lessons.  The  project  design  has  incorporated  lessons  from  previous  ADB-financed 
14. 
projects  and  policy-oriented  studies  on  IWRM,  environmental  and  ecosystem  improvement, 
wetland and lake management, and urban–rural integration in the PRC. Major lessons include 
(i)  an  integrated  approach  of  structural  and  nonstructural  measures  to  water  resources 
for 
management;  (ii)  wide  community  participation  and 
environmental  improvement;  (iii)  linking  environmental  protection  with  livelihood  opportunities; 
(iv)  coordinated  management  of  urban–rural  planning,  and  management  of  resources  and 
services  to  facilitate  integration  and  linkage  to  infrastructure;  (v)  an  institutional  and  cost 
recovery  mechanism  for  effective  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  of  the  facilities;  and 
(vi) eco-compensation as an effective tool for maintaining environmental services.

Innovation  and  special  features.  The  project  is  expected  to  scale  up  and/or 
15. 
demonstrate the following good practices in the PRC: (i) IWRM and comprehensive monitoring, 
(ii)  environmental  protection  linked  with  livelihood  improvement,  and  (iii)  eco-compensation.  In 
addition,  during  project  preparation,  policy  dialogue  was  conducted  and  recommendations 
provided for revising the Dongjiang Lake Basin Water Environmental Protection Regulation.5  
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
Integrated  water  resources  management.  Under  the  IWRM  framework,  the 
project  attempts  to  coordinate  and  integrate  the  structural  and  nonstructural 
measures  in  a  manner  that  ensures  their  consistency  and  results  in  synergies 
where the total impact is greater than the sum of the individual actions. To meet 
the  water  quality  targets  as  requested  in  the  national  good  water  quality  lake 
program, pollutants discharged into the lake have to be reduced. The project will 
take a holistic approach to tackling these challenges by preventing different types 
of  pollution  sources,  and 
land  degradation  and  soil  erosion,  with  a 
comprehensive  environmental  monitoring  system  to  support  integrated  lake 
management.  
Linking  environmental  protection with  livelihood  opportunities.  The project 
will not only maintain environmental and ecological services to the local residents 
and the downstream Changsha–Zhuzhou–Xiangtan city cluster, but also improve 
local  farmers’  income  by  directly  supporting  livelihood  opportunities,  such  as 
bamboo  forest  development,  fish  stocking,  and  technical  and  vocational 
education and training in alternative livelihood activities for 30,000 rural residents 
around the lake. Without such benefits, the willingness of local farmers to comply 
with environmental regulations around the lake would not be fully effective.  
Eco-compensation.  Dongjiang  Lake  performs  crucial  watershed  functions  for 
Hunan  Province.  An  eco-compensation  pilot  scheme  will  be  tested  under  the 
project to compensate those responsible for the collection and treatment of solid 
waste  and  sewage,  and  engagement  of  greener  agricultural  production,  by 
setting  up  an  eco-compensation  fund  to  be  raised  from  tourist  entry  fees.  HPG 
and  Zixing  City  Government  (ZCG)  also  agreed 
to  explore  more  eco-
compensation  schemes  for  better  protection  of  Dongjiang  Lake  during  project 
implementation.  
B.

IV. 
COSTS AND FINANCING 
26. 
The  government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $130  million  from  ADB’s  ordinary  capital 
resources  to  help  finance  the  project.  The  loan  will  have  a  25-year  term,  including  a  grace 
period  of  5  years,  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  London 
interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility,7 a commitment charge of 0.15% per year 
(the interest and other charges during construction to be capitalized in the loan), and such other 
terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. 
The  ADB  loan  will  finance  49.6%  of  the  project  cost,  including  civil  works,  goods, 
27. 
consulting services, training, and taxes and duties for eligible ADB-financed expenditures.8 ZCG 
will finance $109.6 million (41.8%); and the farmer beneficiaries will finance $22.5 million (8.6%) 
of  the  project  cost,  including  civil  works,  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  (LAR)  cost, 
environmental  monitoring  cost,  design  and  supervision  cost,  and  contingencies.  The  farmer 
beneficiaries’ contributions refer to the farmers’ share for subprojects relating to nonpoint source 
pollution,  green  and  organic 
fertilizers  and  ecosystem  management  with  community 
participation.  Farmer  beneficiaries  will  contribute  their  share  of  cash  for  buying  materials  from 
the  suppliers  for  the  nonpoint  source  pollution,  and  green  and  organic  fertilizers  components; 
and their share of labor for ecosystem management with community participation. The national 
government is the borrower of the loan and will relend the entire loan to HPG, which will onlend 
the loan proceeds to ZCG on the same terms and conditions as those for the ADB loan. ZCG 
will bear the foreign exchange and interest rate variation risks. 
A. 
Cost Estimates Preparation and Revisions  
Preparation.  The  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (PPTA)  consultants  worked 
28. 
closely  with  the  design  institutes  for  preparing  the  cost  estimates  following  the  national 
government’s  guidelines  on  preparing  the  cost  estimates  and  ADB’s  guide  note  on  Preparing 
and Presenting Cost Estimates for Projects and Programs Financed by the Asian Development 
Bank.  The  electronic  file  in  Microsoft  excel  format  was  retained  at  the  project  management 
office (PMO) under ZCG and by the ADB project officer.  
29. 
Revisions.  The  PMO,  with  the  assistance  of  the  design  institutes,  will  revise  the  cost 
estimates  under  the  guidance  of  the  ADB  project  officer  during  implementation  based  on  the 
request  for  project  cost  reallocation  and  ADB’s  subsequent  approval.  During  the  midterm 
review, the project cost will be re-estimated and compared with the project cost at appraisal.  
B. 
Cost Categories 
30. 
Cost categories are as follows: 
Category

Notes: (i) ADB loan funds will be paid from the HPFD imprest account to ZCG and ZIFC through pass-through 
accounts; and 
(ii) Farmer beneficiaries under agriculture nonpoint source pollution, green and organic fertilizers, and 
ecosystem  management  with  community  participation  will  contribute  cash  for  buying  materials  from 
suppliers  for  the  first  two  components  and  their  share  of  labor  for  ecosystem  management  with 
community participation; while farmers will also receive payment for their labors paid by the ADB loan 
proceeds.  Farmers  will  buy  materials  from  the  implementing  agency’s  selected  qualified  suppliers  in 
their  locality  and pay  their shares  to  the  suppliers. For the labor  payment,  the  project implementation 
unit  (Zixing  City  Forestry  Bureau)  will  verify  the  areas  of  the  tree or  bamboo  planting by  each  farmer 
household with the assistance from the village committees concerned; and each farmer household will 
be  paid  (loan  share)  through  bank  card  transfer  based  on  the  areas,  multiplying  the  unit  cost  after 
verification. This will be done through community participation procurement (via community participation 
agreement), and the ADB loan proceeds will be paid to the farmers from the imprest account based on 
provisions of the community participation agreement.

FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT 
A. 
Financial Management Assessment 
The  financial  management  assessment  (FMA) 9  was  conducted  in  January  2015  in 
33. 
accordance with ADB’s Guidelines for the Financial Management and Analysis of Projects10 and 
the Financial Due Diligence—A Methodology Note.11 The FMA considered the capacity of ZCG, 
the executing agency; and the Zixing City Urban and Rural Environmental Protection Investment 
and  Financing  Center  (ZIFC),  the  implementing  agency,  on  funds  flow  arrangements,  staffing, 
accounting  and  financial  reporting  systems,  financial  information  systems,  and  internal  and 
external  auditing  arrangements  (footnote  9).  The  FMA  found  that  (i)  ZCG  and  ZIFC  has 
adequate  and  qualified  staff  for  operating  and  administering  the  project  account,  and  (ii)  its 
internal control and audit will be mitigated through capacity building and close monitoring during 
project  implementation  (footnote  9).  ZIFC  is  relatively  new  entity  established  in  2014  with  no 
internal  audit  unit,  and  staff  increase  may  be  required  to  meet  project  implementation  needs. 
Based on the FMA, the financial management risks identified are ZCG’s and ZIFC’s unfamiliarity 
with ADB’s financial management policies and procedures (footnote 9). It is concluded that the 
overall pre-mitigation financial management risk of ZCG and ZIFC is moderate.  Both ZCG and 
ZIFC  have  agreed  to  implement  an  action  plan  as  key  measure  to  address  the  deficiencies. 
With mitigating measures, these financial management arrangements are deemed adequate.  
34. 
The financial management action plan is summarized below: 
(i) 
To  conduct  regular  training  on  ADB’s  disbursement  procedures,  and  project 
accounting  and  financial  reporting  requirements.  The  training  budget  has  been 
included in the project cost. During the PPTA implementation, on-the-job training 
was provided by the PPTA consultant. 
To  provide  implementation  consulting  services  to  the  ZCG  and  ZIFC  staff  on 
financial  management.  The  financial  management  specialist  with  6  person-
months  of  inputs  has  been  included  in  the  implementation  consulting  services 
package.  
Separate accounts to be maintained for all project outputs financed by ADB and 
the national government, and to be audited by an independent external auditor; 
Annual  project  accounts  and  underlying  working  papers  timely  prepared  for  the 
annual financial statement audit; 
Prompt reporting to project stakeholders after the end of each accounting period; 
Compliance  with  loan  covenants  monitored,  including  submission  of  audited 
project accounts; and 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
(v) 
(vi) 
(vii)  Regular  back-up  of  all  accounting  systems  and  appropriate  security  measures 
over back-up data to be put in place.

policies  and  procedures  is  available  at  http://wpqr4.adb.org/disbursement_  elearning.  Project 
staff  will  be  encouraged  to  avail  of  this  training  to  help  ensure  efficient  disbursement  and 
fiduciary control. 
Direct payment, reimbursement, commitment, and imprest fund procedures may be used 
36. 
to withdraw funds from the loan account. To expedite the flow of funds and simplify document 
processing,  the  statement  of  expenditure  (SOE)  procedure  may  be  used  to  reimburse, 
replenish,  and  liquidate  eligible  expenditures  for  any  individual  payment  not  exceeding 
$500,000. 
37. 
An  imprest  account  in  US  dollar  will  be  set  up  for  the  project  by  the  Hunan  Provincial 
Finance  Department  (HPFD)  in  a  commercial  bank  acceptable  to  ADB.  HPFD  will  be 
responsible  for  management,  monitoring,  and  reconciliation  of  the  imprest  account.  The  total 
outstanding advance to the imprest account should not exceed the estimate of ADB’s share of 
expenditures  to  be  paid  through  the  imprest  account  for  the  forthcoming  6  months.  The 
executing agency may request for initial and additional advances to the imprest account based 
on  an  estimate  of  expenditure  sheet  available  in  Appendixes  9B  and  9C  of  ADB’s  Loan 
Disbursement  Handbook  (2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time),  setting  out  the  estimated 
expenditures to be financed through the account for the forthcoming 6 months; and submission 
of  evidence  satisfactory to ADB that the  imprest account  has  been  duly opened  (footnote  12). 
Supporting  documents  should  be  submitted  to  ADB  or  retained  by  the  executing  and 
implementing  agencies  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2015,  as 
amended from time to time) when liquidating or replenishing the imprest account (footnote 12). 
Statement  of  expenditure  procedure. 13  The  SOE  procedure  may  be  used  for 
38. 
reimbursement  of  eligible  expenditures  or  liquidation  of  advances  to  the  imprest  account.  The 
ceiling of the SOE procedure is the equivalent of $500,000 per individual payment. Supporting 
documents  and  records  for  the  expenditures  claimed  under  the  SOE  procedure  should  be 
maintained and made readily available for review by ADB’s disbursement and review missions, 
upon  ADB’s  request  for  submission  of  supporting  documents  on  a  sampling  basis,  and  for 
independent audit. Reimbursement and liquidation of individual payments in excess of the SOE 
ceiling should be supported by full documentation when submitting the withdrawal application to 
ADB. 
39. 
Before the  submission  of  the first  withdrawal  application,  HPFD  through  the  Ministry  of 
Finance should submit to ADB sufficient evidence of the authority of the person(s) who will sign 
the withdrawal applications on behalf of the borrower, together with the authenticated specimen 
signatures  of  each  authorized  person.  The  minimum  value  per  withdrawal  application  is 
$100,000 equivalent. Individual payments below this amount should be paid (i) by the borrower 
and  subsequently  claimed  from  ADB  through  reimbursement,  or  (ii)  through  the  imprest  fund 
procedure, unless otherwise accepted by ADB.  
2. 
Disbursement Arrangements for Counterpart Fund 
The PMO, in coordination with ZIFC, will prepare disbursement projections and request 
40. 
budget  allocations  from  ZCG  for  counterpart  funds.  ZCG  will  allocate  the  counterpart  from  its 
budget  resources  in  line  with  its  budget  regulations  and  procedures.  ZCG  may  also  obtain

financial  support  from  the  provincial  and  national  governments  through  various  environmental 
and water resources improvement programs.  
3. 
Accounting 
41. 
HPG and ZCG, as the case may be, will cause ZIFC to, (i) maintain separate accounts 
and  records  by  funding  source  for  all  expenditures  incurred  on  the  project  following  the 
equivalent  national  accounting  standards;  and  (ii)  prepare  annual  financial  statements  for  the 
project in accordance with the national government’s accounting laws and regulations which are 
consistent with international accounting principles and practices. 
4. 
Auditing and Public Disclosure 
42. 
HPG and ZCG, as the case may be, will cause ZIFC to, have the detailed consolidated 
project financial statements audited in accordance with the International Standards on Auditing 
and  with  the  national  government’s  audit  regulations,  by  an  independent  auditor  whose 
qualification,  experience  and  terms  of  references  are  acceptable  to  ADB,  in  accordance  with 
international  standards for  auditing  or  the  national  equivalent  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  audited 
project financial statements together with the auditor’s opinion will be presented to ADB by ZCG 
in the English language within 6 months from the end of the fiscal year.  
43. 
The  audit  report  for  the  project  accounts  will  include  an  audit  management  letter  and 
auditor’s opinions which cover (i) whether the project financial statements present a true and fair 
view or are presented fairly, in all material respects, in accordance with the applicable financial 
reporting framework; (ii) whether  the  proceeds of  the  loan  were  used  only  for  the  purposes  of 
the  project;  (iii)  the  level  of  compliance  for  each  financial  covenant  contained  in  the  legal 
agreements for the project; (iv) use of the imprest fund procedure; and (v) the use of the SOE 
procedure certifying to the eligibility of those expenditures claimed under SOE procedures, and 
proper  use  of  the  SOE and imprest  procedures in  accordance  with ADB’s  Loan  Disbursement 
Handbook and the project documents (footnote 12). 
44. 
Compliance  with  financial  reporting  and  auditing  requirements  will  be  monitored  by 
review  missions  and  during  normal  program  supervision;  and  followed  up  regularly  with  all 
concerned, including the external auditor.  
45. 
The  national  government,  HPG,  ZCG,  and  ZIFC  have  been  made  aware  of  ADB’s 
approach to delayed submission, and the requirements for satisfactory and acceptable quality of 
the  audited  project  financial  statements.14 ADB  reserves  the  right  to  require  a  change  in  the 
auditor (in a manner consistent with the constitution of the borrower), or for additional support to 
be provided to the auditor, if the audits required are not conducted in a manner satisfactory to 
14 ADB’s approach and procedures regarding delayed submission of audited project financial statements:  
  When audited project financial statements are not received by the due date, ADB will write to the executing agency 
advising  that  (i)  the  audit  documents  are  overdue;  and  (ii)  if  they  are  not  received  within  the  next  6  months, 
requests for new contract awards and disbursement such as new replenishment of imprest accounts, processing 
of new reimbursement, and issuance of new commitment letters will not be processed. 
  When audited project financial statements are not received within 6 months after the due date, ADB will withhold 
processing  of  requests  for  new  contract  awards  and  disbursement  such  as  new  replenishment  of  imprest 
accounts,  processing  of  new  reimbursement,  and  issuance  of  new  commitment  letters.  ADB  will  (i)  inform  the 
executing agency of ADB’s actions; and (ii) advise that the loan may be suspended if the audit documents are 
not received within the next 6 months. 
  When audited project financial statements are not received within 12 months after the due date, ADB may suspend 
the loan. 
31 
ADB,  or  if  the  audits  are  substantially  delayed.  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  verify  the  project’s 
financial accounts to confirm that the share of ADB’s financing is used in accordance with ADB 
policies and procedures. 
Public  disclosure  of  the  audited  project  financial  statements,  including  the  auditor’s

opinion  on  the  project  financial  statements,  will  be  guided  by  ADB’s  Public  Communications 
Policy  (2011).15 After  review,  ADB  will  disclose  the  annual  audited  financial  statements  for  the 
project and the opinion of the auditors on the financial statements within 30 days of the date of 
their receipt by posting them on the ADB website. The management letter, additional auditor’s 
opinions, and audited entity financial statements will not be disclosed.16

VI. 
PROCUREMENT AND CONSULTING SERVICES 
A. 
Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing 
All  advance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  will  be  undertaken  in  conformity  with 
47. 
ADB’s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time)17 and the Guidelines on 
the  Use  of Consultants  (2013, as  amended from  time  to time).18 The  issuance  of  invitations  to 
bid under advance contracting and retroactive financing will be subject to ADB’s approval. The 
borrower,  ZCG,  and  ZIFC  have  been  advised  that  approval  of  advance  contracting  and 
retroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance the project. 
48. 
Advance  contracting.  The  contracts  to  be  included  under  advance  contracting  and 
retroactive financing were tentatively identified and indicated in the procurement plan, which will 
be  finalized  during  loan  negotiations.  Contracts  for  retroactive  financing  are  listed  as  (i)  six 
WWTPs  and  sewer  networks;  (ii)  village  wastewater  treatment  facilities  and  sewer  pipes  in 
Chukou, Dongping, Lianping, Longxi, Qingjiang, and Qingyao towns; and (iii) seven solid waste 
transfer  stations  and  associated  facilities.  As  cited  in  the  previous  paragraph,  approval  of 
advance contracting does not commit ADB to finance the project. 
49. 
Retroactive  financing.  The  national  government  and  ZCG  have  been  advised  that 
retroactive financing may only apply to up to 20% of the amount of the ADB loan in respect for 
expenditures incurred before loan effectiveness, but not earlier than 12 months before the date 
of the loan and project agreements. 
B. 
Procurement of Goods, Works, and Consulting Services 
50. 
All  procurement  to be financed  under the  ADB  loan  will  be  carried  out following  ADB’s 
Procurement Guidelines. Contracts for civil works valued at $20 million or above and contracts 
for  goods  and  related  services  valued  at  $5  million  or  above  will  be  procured  through 
international  competitive  bidding  procedures.  Contracts  for  civil  works  valued  at  below  $20 
million but at $200,000 or over, and contracts for goods and related services valued below $5 
million  but  at  $100,000    or  over  will  be  procured  through  national  competitive  bidding  (NCB) 
procedures.  NCB  will  be  undertaken  following  the  PRC’s  Tendering  and  Bidding  Law  (1999), 
subject  to modifications agreed  with  ADB.19 Contract  packages for  civil  works  valued  at  $200, 
000 or less and goods valued at $100,000 or less will be awarded through shopping procedure. 
Community  participation  will  be  applied  for  the  afforestation  and  bamboo  subprojects  under 
integrated ecosystem rehabilitation and management output.  
An  18-month  procurement  plan,  indicating  threshold  and  review  procedures,  goods, 
51. 
works, and consulting service contract packages and NCB guidelines, is in Section C. 
52. 
All consultants financed by ADB will be recruited according to ADB’s Guidelines on the 
Use  of  Consultants. 20  An  estimated  162  person-months  (26  international,  136  national)  of 
institutional 
consulting  services  are  required  to  (i)  facilitate  project  management  and

National  Competitive  Bidding  (NCB)  issued  by  the  Ministry  of  Finance  in  January  2012  and  enforced  on  1  June 
2012 will be used as model NCB documents.

a. 
Procurement, Consulting Methods, and Thresholds 
53. 
Except  as  ADB  may  otherwise  agree,  the  following  thresholds  shall  apply  to 
procurement of goods and works. Community participation in procurement is proposed to carry 
out  the  afforestation  and  bamboo  subprojects  under  Output  4:  Establishment  of  integrated 
ecosystem  rehabilitation  and  management.  The  current  nine  packages  were  based  on  the 
nature  of  works  and/or  activities,  such  as  tree  planting  for  rocky  desert  rehabilitation;  forest 
upgrading and protection; fire-prevention forest belt; forest pest prevention; and bamboo forest 
upgrading  (further  broken  down  into  five  packages,  each  in  5  years).  The  subprojects  will 
involve  a  total  of  65,699  households;  and  the  farmers  will  be  organized  by  the  Zixing  City 
Forestry  Bureau,  with  assistance  of  village  committees,  to  carry  out  the  works,  including 
seedlings, land preparation, planting, watering, fertilizer application, and maintenance for initial 
3 years. The Zixing Forest Bureau will then verify the areas planted or improved; and then, ZIFC 
will pay the farmers (cost per unit of area planted) through bank transfers.

is  classified  as  category  A 
Due  diligence.  The  project 
for  environment.  An 
62. 
environmental impact assessment (EIA) and an EMP has been prepared and disclosed on the 
ADB  website  on  27  April  2015. 26  The  EIA  incorporates  the  results  of  the  domestic 
environmental,  soil,  and  water  assessments  approved  by  the  Hunan  Provincial  Department  of 
Environmental  Protection  in  May  2015.  The  EIA  complies  with  the  ADB  policies  and 
requirements,  including  ADB’s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (SPS,  2009).27 The  EIA  concludes 
that the project’s anticipated environmental impacts can be mitigated through full and effective 
implementation of the EMP. 
63. 
Environmental  management  plan.  The  project  EIA  and  EMP,  not  the  domestic 
environmental  assessments,  forms  the  basis  of  the  official  loan  agreement  between  ADB  and 
ZCG.  The  EMP  is  the  key  document  to  be  used  by  ZCG  and  the  contractors  to  manage  and 
report on the environmental impacts of project construction and operation. The EMP defines the 
mitigation  measures,  monitoring  program,  grievance  redress  mechanism  (GRM),  public 
consultation  plan,  and  roles  and  responsibilities  for  the  project  agencies.  ZCG,  through  the 
PMO,  holds  final  responsibility  for  implementation  and  compliance  with  the  EMP.  ZCG  and 
ZIFC,  the  implementing  agency,  will  be  responsible  for  ensuring  the  project  is  designed, 
constructed,  decommissioned,  and  operated  in  accordance  with  (i)  the  national  and  local 
government environmental, health, and safety laws, regulations, procedures, and guidelines; (ii) 
ADB’s SPS; and (iii) the EMP. A full-time environmental officer has been assigned in the PMO 
to coordinate implementation of the EMP. The effectiveness of the mitigation measures will be 
evaluated  through  environmental  inspections  and  monitoring.  The  loan  implementation 
environment  consultants  (LIECs)  will  support  the  PMO  and  contractors  in  implementing  the 
EMP. 
64. 
Environmental management plan update and the bidding documents. In the design 
stage,  ZCG  will  forward  the  EMP  to  (i)  the  design  institutes  for  incorporating  mitigation 
measures into the detailed technical designs; and (ii) the wetland specialist who will design the 
fauna  habitat  features  for  the  embankments  and  constructed  wetlands.  The  EMP  will  be 
updated at the end of the detailed design, as needed; reviewed by ADB; and re-posted on the 
ADB  website. To ensure that contractors comply  with  the  EMP, the PMO  will  prepare  and  
provide  the  following  for  incorporation  into  the  bidding  documents:  (i)  a  list  of  environmental  
management  requirements    to    be    budgeted  by  bidders  in  their  proposals,  (ii)  environmental  
clauses for contractual terms  and  conditions, and (iii) the updated EMP. The contractors and 
the construction supervision companies (CSCs) will incorporate the EMP mitigation measures in 
their construction plans and will also be responsible for internal environmental monitoring during 
construction.  Environmental  impact  monitoring  will  be  conducted  by  the  local  environmental 
monitoring  stations  contracted  by  ZCG.  Assurances  for  environmental  safeguards  have  been 
prepared and are included in the loan and project agreements. 
Potential impacts. Key construction-related risks during construction relate to dredging 
65. 
and  embankment  along  the  sections  of  the  five  major  rivers,  the  six  wastewater  treatment 
stations, the two water treatment plants, and the water transmission pipelines. Potential impacts 
and  measures  to  avoid,  minimize,  and  mitigate  these  are  described  in  the  EMP.  All  planned

project  activities  are  compatible  with  the  zoning  and  regulations  of  local  reserves,  and  the 
relevant  provincial  and  local  master  plans  and  regulations  for  Dongjiang  Lake.  All  relevant 
provincial  and  local  agencies,  including  the  environment,  water  resources,  and  forestry 
agencies, were involved in the development of the project activities.  
66. 
Dredging  and  embankment.  About  14.62  km  of  dredging  and  13.72  km  of 
embankments will be implemented along the sections of five major rivers. Some of these river 
sections  retain  relatively  natural  habitats,  steep-sided  forested  slopes,  and/or  levels  of  heavy 
metals in the soil or sediments which exceed the PRC standards. One of the rivers, Tian’eshan 
River,  is  located  in  a  forest  park.  Construction  risks  include  loss  and  damage  of  channel 
habitats, temporary elevated turbidity, and release of heavy metals. Mitigation measures include 
seasonal  timing  (dredging  will  only  be  conducted  from  September  to  February,  the  time  of 
lowest water levels), on-site sediment sampling prior to any works, closely controlled dredging 
and sediment removal (in short, staged sections of river), on-site support by a wetland specialist 
who will also design the embankment habitat features, and disposal of dredge material at sites 
close  to  the  river (i.e.,  within  the same  area  to  avoid contaminating  other  regions). With  these 
measures,  net  impacts  are  anticipated  to  be  minimal.  Aquatic  communities  are  anticipated  to 
recolonize  the  river  sections  from  intact  sections  upstream.  No  in-channel  structures  will  be 
constructed  (such  structures  might  impede  the  movement  of  fish  or  other  aquatic  fauna  along 
the channels). 
67. 
Construction of new facilities. Construction activities will involve noise, dust, vibration, 
vegetation  removal,  protection  of  water  quality,  and  considerations  for  occupational  and 
community health and safety, and physical cultural values. These issues have been assessed. 
Mitigation measures are in the EMP.   
68. 
Key operation-related risks include (i) cumulative nutrient loading in rivers and Dongjiang 
Lake from the treated effluent discharged by the six WWTPs, (ii) air and noise emissions from 
plant operation, and (iii) lack of maintenance of project facilities. For nutrient loading, modeling 
was conducted to assess the risk that the combined effluent loads from the six WWTPs might 
affect  water  quality  and  exceed  the  required  standards.  Results  confirm  that  pollutants  will  be 
diluted  to  levels  which  are  considerably  lower  than  the  required  standard—within  100  meters 
downstream of the WWTPs—under conditions of low flow in the dry season. The four rivers are 
permanent  (limiting  the  risk  of  stagnation  and  eutrophication),  and  none  are  used  for  drinking 
water supply. Risks to communities and aquatic ecology are concluded to be low. Air and noise 
emissions  were  also  modeled  and  confirmed  to  meet  the  required  standards  at  the  plant 
boundaries.  For  project  O&M,  to  avoid  the  risk  of  new  project  structures  and  facilities  being 
poorly operated or falling into disrepair, (i) the project includes capacity building for maintenance 
of  all  project facilities;  and  (ii)  operational  plans  will  be  developed  as part  of the  project for  all 
facilities, which will include roles and responsibilities, schedules, and facility maintenance. 
69. 
Cumulative and indirect  impacts. The Dongjiang Lake basin is experiencing slow but 
steady  population  growth  and  incremental  rising  pressures  to  water  quality.  In  addition  to  the 
current project, ZCG is undertaking a range of other domestically funded programs to manage 
the  lake  resources  as  well  as  promote  development. In  conjunction  with  these,  the  project  will 
help achieve 100% of the targets in the Dongjiang Lake Ecological Implementation Plan, 2012–
2015. Dongjiang Lake is also a pilot lake under the PRC’s “One Lake, One Strategy” program. 
Under  the  program,  the  national  government  will  address  remaining  water  pollution  sources 
which  are  not  being  addressed  under  the  current  project  (e.g.,  mining  in  upstream  counties). 
These activities, combined with the project, aim to improve the water quality throughout the lake 
to Grade II of the PRC’s surface water quality standard or better compared to current Grade III. 
47 
Public  consultation  and  grievance  redress  mechanism.  Information  disclosure  and 
70. 
two rounds of public consultations were conducted during the EIA in accordance with the PRC’s 
Guideline on Public Consultation in EIA (2006) and ADB’s SPS. Public concerns about air and 
water  pollution  were  documented  and  have  been  addressed  in  the  project  design.  During 
construction, the project will continue to seek public consultation and raise awareness of project 
activities,  especially  those  which  may  impact  the  public  such  as  noise  or  dust.  The  project 
implementation  units 
for  public  participation  during  project 
implementation.  They  will  be  supported  by  the  PMO’s  environment  and  social  safeguards 
officers. 
(PIUs)  are 
responsible 
71. 
A  project-specific  GRM  has  been  established  to  receive  and  manage  any  community 
concerns  which  may  arise  due to the  project. The PMO  is  the  lead agency  that  will  have final 
responsibility  for  management,  implementation,  and  reporting  of  the  GRM.  The  PMO’s 
environment and social safeguards officers will (i) coordinate the GRM; and instruct local EPBs, 
and  contractors  on  their  responsibilities  in  the  GRM;  (ii)  establish  a  simple  registry  system  to 
document  and  track  grievances  received  (including  forms  to  record  complaints  and  how  they 
have been resolved); (iii) report on progress of the GRM in the quarterly project progress reports 
and  the  semiannual  environmental  and  resettlement  monitoring  and  progress  reports  to  ADB; 
and  (iv)  arrange  future  public  consultations  for  the  project.  The  GRM  procedures,  reporting 
timelines,  roles  and  responsibilities  of  all  agencies,  and  the  GRM  contact  persons  in  each 
project participating enterprise are described in Section G of the EMP.  
72. 
Capacity  building.  The  project  agencies  are  without  previous  experience  with  ADB-
funded  projects  or  safeguard  requirements.  To  ensure  effective  implementation  of  the  EMP,  a 
capacity  building  program  will  be  implemented  on  (i)  the  EMP,  including  the  mitigation 
measures,  monitoring,  and  reporting;  and  (ii)  sustainable  integrated  watershed  management. 
Training will be provided by the Hunan Provincial Department of Environmental Protection, the 
Chenzhou Municipal and Zixing City EPBs, and the LIECs. Trainees will include the CSCs, the 
PIUs, the PMO, the implementing agencies, the contractors, and the water resources bureaus. 
The  PMO  will  arrange  and  coordinate  the  training  programs  supported  by  the  LIECs.  The 
training program is in Table EMP-6 of the EMP (Annex 1). 
Budget. ZCG shall make available, and cause ZIFC, the implementing agency, to make 
73. 
available  the  necessary  budget  and  human  resources  to  fully  implement  the  EMP.  If  any 
unanticipated  environmental  risks  and  impacts  arise  during  construction  or  operation  of  the 
project  that  were  not  considered  in  the  EIA  and/or  EMP,  ZCG,  through  the  ZIFC  or  the 
implementing agency, should promptly inform ADB in writing of the occurrence of such risks or 
impacts, with detailed description of the event and the proposed action plan for incorporation in 
the updated EMP. The total estimated cost for EMP implementation is about CNY15.943 million 
($2,571,452) for 5-year construction (Table EMP-8 in the EMP, Annex 1). The estimated cost for 
the  PMO  is  CNY754,000  (4.7%),  and  for  the  contractors  is  about  CNY14,594,000  (91.5%). 
About  CNY595,000  (3.7%)  will  be  paid  from  the  ADB  loan  for  consulting  services.  Remaining 
costs  will  be  paid  by  ZCG.  Overall,  the  cost  of  EMP  implementation  is  small  given  the  large 
scale of the project and when spread over 5 years. 
74. 
Climate  change.  A climate risk vulnerability assessment was conducted to identify the 
threat  that  climate  change  presents  to  project  viability,  assuming  a  design  life  of  30-40  years. 
The  assessment  found  that  mean  annual  temperature  will  increase,  annual  precipitation  will 
remain the same or slightly decrease, and evapotranspiration will increase. Projected in-flows to 
Dongjiang  Lake  for  2015–2030  remain  similar  to  the  baseline  period  of  1971–2000.  Declining 
seasonal  flows  could  reduce  the  efficiency  of  the  constructed  water  pipelines  and  treatment 
48 
rates  of the  wastewater and  water  treatment  plants,  while altered storm intensity  could impact 
the  rivers.  Initial  climate  risk  during  project  concept  stage  was  medium,  while  the  climate  risk 
vulnerability assessment found the risk to be low and adaptation measures were included in the 
project design. 
Pursuant to ADB’s SPS, ADB funds may not be applied to the activities described on the 
75. 
ADB Prohibited Investment Activities List set forth at Appendix 5 of the SPS.  
B. 
Resettlement 
76. 
The project is classified as category A for involuntary resettlement due to significant LAR 
impacts. ZCG, with the support of a local institute, prepared the resettlement plan according to 
ADB’s  SPS.  The  resettlement  planning  and  implementation  is  designed  to  ensure  that  the 
affected persons will be better off or at least not worst off as a result of the project, and support 
to  the  displaced  poor  and  other  vulnerable  groups,  including  women  to  at  least  national 
minimum standards.  
Land  acquisition  and  resettlement. The table below summarizes the LAR impacts. A 
77. 
total of 189.06 ha (2,835.84 mu) of land will be occupied permanently for the project, including 
12.28  ha  (184.22  mu)  of  collective  land  and  176.77  ha  (2,651.62  mu)  of  state-owned  land.  In 
addition,  some  65.29  ha  (979.40  mu)  of  land  will  be  occupied  temporarily.  The  project  will 
demolish 1,539.1 square meters (m2) of housing. It will affect 573 people, 284 of them will lose 
more  than  10%  of  their  productive  assets  and/or  be  physically  displaced.  Seven  households 
need  to  be  relocated.  ZCG,  with  the  assistance  of  consultants  engaged  under  the  PPTA, 
prepared a resettlement plan in line with ADB’s SPS and related laws and regulations of HPG, 
the  Chenzhou  Municipal  Government,  and  the  national  government.  ZCG  has  endorsed  the 
resettlement  plan  and  disclosed  the  relevant  information  to  the  affected  people.  The 
resettlement plan was also disclosed on the ADB website on 2 July 2015. ZCG will fully finance 
CNY23.1448 million (including resettlement contingency) of LAR costs. ZCG has experience in 
conducting LAR for foreign-funded projects and has the capacity to implement the resettlement 
plan for this project 
78. 
The  LAR  compensation  standards  will  follow  the  Land  Administration  Law  of  the 
People’s Republic of China (2004); the Decision of the State Council on Deepening the Reform 
and  Rigidly  Enforcing  Land  Administration  (SC  [2004]  No.28),  (21  October  2004);  and  other 
applicable  guidelines.  They  will  also  be  based  on  local  policies  regarding  LAR  in  Hunan 
Province,  Chenzhou  Municipality,  Zixing  City,  and  ADB’s  SPS.  HPG  and  ZCG  will  provide 
necessary assistance for house construction and relocation during resettlement implementation. 
79. 
Resettlement  and  income  restoration.  To  minimize  project  impacts  and  promote 
income  restoration,  detailed  livelihood  restoration  and  resettlement  programs  have  been 
developed;  and  included  in  the  draft  resettlement  plan  based  on  the  results  of  the 
socioeconomic survey for resettlement, and by reference to successful resettlement experience 
from  local  similar  projects.  The  income  restoration  measures  for  the  households  affected  by 
land  acquisition 
include  cash  compensation,  agricultural  development,  nonagricultural 
employment,  skills  training,  social  security,  etc.  The  resettlement  modes  for  the  households 
affected by house demolishing include self-demolition and self-reconstruction, and resettlement 
in  centrally  built  apartments.  Only  seven  households  affected  by  house  demolition  will  need 
resettlement  housing.  Six  households  have  chosen  self-demolition  and  self-reconstruction 
based  on  affordability,  where  housing  land  compensation  is  paid  to  the  village  group,  new 
housing land is provided by the village group to each affected households for free, and township 
government is responsible for the three supplies and one leveling. The other affected household 
49 
has chosen resettlement in centrally built apartments, where two housing sizes (108 m2 and 81 
m2) and two structures (two or three households per building) are available, to be constructed by 
the  government,  and  purchased  at  the  cost  price  of  CNY638/m2.  The  LAR  impacts  are 
summarized in Table 6. 
80. 
Institutional arrangements. ZCG is the executing agency of the project, and the Zixing 
City PMO is the management and coordinating agency. ZIFC is the implementing agency; and 
the  Zixing  Land  Acquisition  and  House  Demolition  Affairs  Center  is  responsible  for  the  LAR 
implementation,  including  impact  verification;  consultation  with  the  affected  persons;  raising 
funds  and  payment  of  compensation fees; and implementation  of resettlement measures. The 
township  and/or  subdistrict  resettlement  offices,  and  the  village  committees  will  actively 
participate  in  the  implementation  of  the  resettlement  plan.  The  PMO  and  ZIFC  will  organize 
training or capacity building on the compensation and resettlement. The resettlement plan also 
includes a training program to strengthen the capacity of the staff of resettlement offices at all 
levels. The resettlement implementation schedule has been prepared based on the preparation 
and  construction  timetable.  The  resettlement  plans  will  be  updated  based  on  the  final  design 
and  detailed  measurement  survey,  disclosed  to  affected  persons,  and  submitted  to  ADB  for 
review and approval prior to awarding of civil works contract. 
81. 
Cost. The total estimated resettlement cost is CNY23.1448 million (accounting for 1.4% 
of  the  total  project  cost),  including  basic  land  acquisition  and  house  demolition  costs  of 
CNY10.9502 million or 47.31% of the budget; and other costs (including resettlement planning 
costs, staff training costs, land acquisition taxes, supporting fund for vulnerable groups, etc.) of 
CNY10.5522 million or 45.59% of total costs; and contingencies of CNY1.6424 million or 7.1% 
of total costs. The estimation of resettlement cost is shown in Table 7.

C. 
Ethnic Minorities 
84. 
The project is categorized as B for the indigenous peoples according to ADB’s SPS (and 
safeguard requirement 2). The Yao people are the major ethnic minority group inhabiting in few 
villages  within  four  townships  in  the  project’s  service  areas:  (i)  Huangcao,  (ii)  Lianping,  (iii) 
Longxi,  and  (iv)  Qingjiang.  The  household  survey  reveals  that  the  Yao  people  consider 
themselves as Chinese. Consultations with the Yao villagers show that the Yao people are well 
integrated in the villages; speak the same language; and practice the same cultural practices as 
that of the Han, and have assimilated the culture of the Han. However, they affirm that most of 
their children no longer speak the unique dialect of the Yao people, especially if they migrate out 
of  the  villages  to  work  in  other  parts  of  the  country.  The  majority  of  the  Yao  people  also  no 
longer  practice  the  culture  that  is  distinct  in  their  own  ethnic  group.  The  children  of  the  Yao 
people attend the same school with other Chinese children. 
85. 
The project will not have any significant, direct, and adverse impact on the Yao villagers 
(i.e.,  some  construction  disturbance  but  without  LAR  impacts.  The  project  will  provide  them 
direct  and  indirect  benefits,  such  as  livelihood  opportunities  in  bamboo  upgrade,  wetland 
protection, improved sanitation, flood prevention, livelihood training, and tourism  activities. The 
upgrading of bamboo forests in Lianping Township will benefit the Yao people, but they will face 
increasing competition for other locations that have lower transport costs. Also, tourism activities 
should be culturally appropriate, such as the eco-tourism in Huangcao Town, Longxing Village, 
and  adjacent  villages.  The  Yao  households  should  be  supported  to  develop  such  tourism 
services and avoid being exploited by outsiders. 
86. 
The Yao culture in village around Dongjiang Lake faces threats due to the (i) small size 
of  scattered  Yao  communities  in  a  Han  dominated  area,  (ii)  limited  resources  that  they  are 
permitted  to  develop  for  their  livelihood,  (iii)  high  transport  due  to  their  remoteness;  (iv)  lower 
levels of education also due to their remoteness; and (v) lack of education in the Yao language. 
A  draft  EMDP  has  been  prepared  to  ensure  that  the  Yao  minority  people  are  able  to 
87. 
participate and benefit directly from the project, and that any negative impacts that might affect 
them  are either avoided  or  mitigated.  Adequate provisions  to enhance  economic  conditions of 
the Yao villagers have been integrated into the project design. An action plan is given in Table 9 
of the EMDP. The EMDP fully complies with the requirements of relevant laws, regulations, and 
policies of the national government, HPG, ZCG, and ADB’s SPS. The EMDP was also disclosed 
on the ADB website on 2 July 2015 (footnote 22). 
Institutional  arrangements. The PMO will be responsible for implementing the EMDP 
88. 
with  the  assistance  from  the  social  development  and  gender  consultant,  who  will  be  hired  by 
ZCG  or  the  executing  agency  during  project  implementation. The  consultant  shall  also  ensure 
that the EMDP and other plans (i.e., SDAP, GAP, and the communication plan) are implemented 
in a timely manner. The PMO has appointed a social safeguards officer who was already trained 
or  given  orientation  on  the  important  functions  to  be  performed,  and  ADB’s  SPS.  During  the 
training conducted on 18 March 2015, the Zixing City Ethnic Minority and Religious Affairs Office 
and  its  township  offices  will  provide  support  to  coordinate,  advise,  and  review  the  EMDP 
implementation  progress.  Implementation  arrangements  for  the  EMDP  are  integrated  into  the 
specific project activities. Other key agencies for implementation include the Zixing City Forestry 
Bureau,  the  Industrial  Workers  Training  Office,  the  All  China  Women’s  Federation,  and  other 
concerned  agencies,  in  coordination  with  the  township  heads  and  the  Yao  village  leaders  or 
cadres  who  shall  be  the  focal  persons  to  facilitate  linkages  at  the  village  level.  In  Lianping 
Township,  the  concerned  agencies,  including  the  Zixing  City  Ethnic  Minority  and  Religious 
Affairs Office, will review progress of the bamboo upgrading component at the four Yao villages.

VIII.  GENDER AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS 
91. 
This section describes the required actions for gender and social dimensions, other than 
social  safeguards.  A  social,  poverty,  and  gender  analysis  was  undertaken  in  accordance  with 
ADB’s  policies  on  Gender  and  Development  in  ADB  Operations  (Operations  Manual  Section 
C2)  and  on  Incorporation  of  Social  Dimensions  into  ADB  Operations  (Operations  Manual 
Section C3). The analysis collected relevant information to assist in the design of the project by 
identifying  the  poor,  examining  causes  of  poverty,  and  recommending  poverty  reduction 
measures within the project scope. 
A. 
Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy 
flood  risk, 
92. 
Poverty  and  social  analysis  was  undertaken  in  accordance  with  the  ADB  guidelines. 
Rising  inequality  is  a  major  concern  for  the  national  government.  The  main  determinant  of 
widening inequality has been the growing income gap between rural and urban areas as well as 
within  cities.  According  to  the  Zixing  City  Poverty  Alleviation  Office,  the  poverty  rate  in  the 
project  area  is  9.8%.  The  project  areas  cover  a  total  of  13  townships  and  183  villages.  The 
project will directly benefit 78,325 households from improved pollution control, enhanced water 
supply,  reduced 
integrated  management  of  ecosystem  and  strengthened 
environmental  and  project  management  capacity.  The  major  impact  of  the  project  will  be 
sustainable economic development among the households who will be benefited by the project. 
The implementation of the project components and activities are expected to reduce pollution of 
the  Dongjiang  Lake  and  surrounding  watershed  by  improving  solid  waste  and  wastewater 
management. Providing adequate water and safe drinking water to households will improve the 
health  conditions  and  prevent  spread  of  water-borne  diseases  and  related  illnesses.  Other 
project  components  will  also  increase  agricultural  production;  improve  the  environment  or 
ecosystem;  and  increase  public  awareness  on  improved  health,  sanitation,  and  environmental 
protection. Eco-compensation and livelihood training activities under the project are essential to 
increase household income. The survey also shows that 49% of the households get water from 
springs and only 36% have piped water. More than 50% of households, especially in the rural 
areas, are still using the traditional type of toilets without septic tanks. 
93. 
About  3,410  jobs  will  be  needed  during  construction  or  civil  works,  of  which  852  jobs 
(25%  of  labor)  will  be  given  to  women.  A  total  of  about  1,360  permanent  jobs  will  be  needed 
during  operation,  of  which  544  jobs  (40%)  will  be  given  to  women.  Employment  targets  for 
vulnerable groups and women are included in the design and monitoring framework (DMF) and 
loan  assurances.  This  will  provide  the  local  people,  including  women,  ethnic  minority,  and 
affected persons a fair opportunity to have jobs generated by the project.  
94. 
The  local  people,  including  women,  will  also  have  the  opportunity  to  participate  in 
capacity  building  and/or  public  awareness  campaign  on  improved  health  and  sanitation, 
environmental  protection,  and  livelihood  training  that  will  be  conducted  during  project 
implementation,  of  which  40%  of  the  total  participants  are  women.  The  livelihood  training  will 
provide  the  local  people,  including  women,  ethnic  minority,  and  affected  persons,  the 
opportunity  to  increase  income;  and  have  sustainable  or  long-term  livelihood.  During  the 
baseline  survey  and  stakeholders  consultations,  the  local  people  suggested  livelihood  training 
for both agricultural- and nonagricultural-related jobs such as bamboo planting, bamboo crafts, 
food  processing  (bamboo  shoots,  fish,  fruits,  tea,  vegetables,  etc.),  livestock  raising,  poultry 
raising, cultural tourism or eco-tourism services, restaurant services, and boat repair. A total of 
30,000 local people will be benefited by the livelihood training. 
57 
B. 
Gender Development and Gender Action Plan 
95. 
The  project  has  been  designed  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  Women  in  focus 
group discussions found that environmental improvements are anticipated to have a significant 
gender impact, with reduced time burdens and costs for healthcare, preparation for floods, and 
clean-up after floods; and with overall improvement of surroundings. The project will also create 
women’s employment opportunities. A GAP has been prepared to ensure that women are kept 
fully  informed;  engaged  throughout  the  project  cycle;  and  participate  in  activities,  such  as 
training,  public  awareness,  public  hearings  on  setting  tariffs  for  improved  water  system,  and 
solid waste and wastewater treatment, employment during construction (civil works) and project 
operations, public consultations, and other activities. Gender-specific indicators have also been 
included in the project’s DMF. The GAP includes measures addressing gender concerns in all 
project components and capacity development, such as (i) ensuring that there will be sufficient 
project  management  support  consultants  with  appropriate  awareness  of  gender  issues  to 
effectively  oversee  the  implementation  and  monitoring  of  the  GAP;  (ii)  ensuring  the  effective 
inclusion of women in all project activities; and (iii) ensuring, as far as possible, that the targets 
set for the employment of women are met; and that the work conditions of and pay for men and 
women are equitable. Resettlement plan measures will mitigate any possible negative impacts 
of the project on women due to the LAR impacts. Table 9 shows the GAP. 
The  GAP  includes  provisions  to  ensure  that  the  staff  of  the  PMO  and  ZIFC  are  fully 
96. 
briefed  on  gender  and  development,  and  the  GAP  at  the  commencement  of  project 
implementation.  The  staff  responsible  for  social  safeguards  and  gender  will  (i)  work  with 
women’s  federations,  contractors,  and  community  office  staff  to  facilitate  the  participation  of 
women in opportunities for physical works; and (ii) ensure that all PRC labor laws and standards 
are respected. The staff will also ensure that (i) the gender-disaggregated baseline and survey 
data  will  be  collected;  (ii)  the  GAP  is  implemented,  monitored,  and  reported  to  ADB  through 
quarterly project progress reports. The social development and gender specialists engaged for 
project  management  support  will  mentor  the  staff,  as  necessary;  and  facilitate  achievement  of 
the project’s gender and development objectives. The GAP will be monitored during ADB review 
missions, and supervision will be supported by ADB’s social development specialists. 
C. 
Social Development Action Plan 
97. 
A  SDAP  has  been  prepared to facilitate  continued  consultation  and  participation  (C&P) 
of  communities  in  the  project,  and  ensure  that  the  local  people  in  the  affected  villages  are 
mobilized  and  engaged  in  the  entire  project  cycle.  The  SDAP  also  includes  specific  activities 
and  target  indicators  to  ensure  that  (i)  the  local  people,  including  women,  will  be  benefited  by 
the  project  in  terms  of  training,  public  awareness,  employment  during  construction  in  some 
project  components,  and  participation  in  public  hearings  to  set  the  tariff  for  improved  water 
supply  system,  and  the  solid  waste  and/or  wastewater  treatment  system;  and  (ii)  labor  rights 
and  entitlements  are  observed,  and  the  needs  of  poor  households  are  considered.  Table  10 
shows the SDAP.  
58 
Core labor standard in accordance with the PRC laws will need to be followed for works 
98. 
contracts  under  the  projects,  including  community  labor.  The  SDAP  also  indicates  that  civil 
works  contracts  will  stipulate  that  (i)  the  local  people  will  receive  priority  with  respect  to 
employment; (ii) equal wages will be paid for work of equal value, and that women’s wages will 
be paid directly to them; (iii) no child or forced labor will be employed; and (iv) all employees will 
be  provided  with  a  written  contract  in  accordance  with  the  format  prescribed  by  the  PRC’s 
national  law.  The  implementation  of  the  GAP  and  SDAP  will  be  supported  by  the  community 
C&P plan (Section IX.E).

Monitoring  
99. 
Project  performance  monitoring.  To  monitor  the  progress  of  the  project  in  achieving 
the planned outcome and outputs, the PMO will establish and maintain the PPMS which will be 
designed  to  permit  adequate  flexibility  to  adopt  remedial  action  regarding  project  design, 
schedules, activities, and development impacts. At the start of project implementation, the PMO 
and  ZIFC  will  develop  integrated  PPMS  procedures  to  generate  data  systematically  on  the 
inputs  and  outputs  of  the  components,  as  well  as  the  indicators  to  be  used  to  measure  the 
project’s  impact  and  outcome  taking  into  account  the  components’  scope.  The  PMO  will  be 
responsible  for  monitoring  and  reporting  on  project  performance.  The  basis  for  performance 
monitoring will be the DMF,  which identifies performance targets for the impact, outcome, and 
outputs of the project. 
100.  Disaggregated baseline data for output and outcome indicators gathered during project 
processing  will  be  updated  and  reported  quarterly  through  the  PMO’s  semiannual  progress 
reports  and  after  each  ADB  review  mission.  These  quarterly  progress  reports  will  provide 
information  necessary  to  update  ADB’s  PPMS  (footnote  21).  The  PMO  will  collect  the  data, 
calculate the indicators, analyze the results, and prepare a brief report describing the extent to 
which the project is generating the intended outputs and outcome, as well as the overall impact 
on  Dongjiang  Lake’s  environment  and  water  quality.  The  relevance  and  practicability  of  data 
collection for indicators was confirmed with the PMO and ZIFC. The agreed socioeconomic and 
environmental  indicators  to be  used will  be  further  enhanced to measure  project  impacts.  The 
PMO and ZIFC agreed and confirmed that they will (i) refine and integrate the PPMS framework 
at  the  start  of  project  implementation;  (ii)  confirm  that  targets  are  achievable;  (iii)  develop 
recording, monitoring,  and  reporting arrangements;  and  (iv)  establish systems  and  procedures 
no later than 6 months after project inception. 
101.  Compliance monitoring. During project implementation, ADB and the PMO will closely 
monitor the  compliance of  all  the covenants  under the  project  and  will  take  necessary remedy 
actions for any noncompliance. The compliance status will be reported in the quarterly progress 
report by the PMO and will be reviewed during project review missions. Compliance monitoring 
will also be undertaken by (i) the environment officer, supported by the PMO and the Zixing City 
EPB  to  ensure  overall  compliance  of  all  relevant  agencies  with  the  EMP,  and  (ii)  the  PMO’s 
social  safeguards  officer  to  ensure  overall  compliance  with  the  relevant  social,  gender,  and 
resettlement plans. Semiannual environmental monitoring reports will be prepared by the PMO’s 
environment  officer;  and  after  review  by  the  implementing  agencies,  the  municipal  and  city 
EPBs, and the PMO, the report will then be submitted by the PMO to ADB. 
71 
102.  Environmental  monitoring.  The  project  will  undertake  two  types  of  environmental 
monitoring: internal and external. Internal monitoring will comprise monitoring and inspection by 
the  CSCs,  the  PIUs,  the  PMO,  ZIFC,  and  the  contractors.  The  PMO’s  environment  officer, 
supported  by  the  LIEC,  will  be  responsible  for  internal  inspection  and  overall  compliance  with 
the  EMP  throughout  the  project  until  project  completion.  The  PMO’s  environment  officer,  the 
LIEC,  and  the  Zixing  City  EPB  will  advise  and  supervise  the  CSCs,  the  PIUs,  and  the 
contractors  to  ensure  that  the  environmental  mitigation  measures  defined  in  the  EMP  are 
properly  implemented. The  LIEC  will  be  responsible for  verifying  the  EMP  implementation  and 
the environmental monitoring information prepared by the PMO and the implementing agencies. 
In  verifying,  the  LIEC  may  conduct  their  own  investigation  by  visiting  the  project  sites,  taking 
samples,  and/or  conducting  site  inspections. The  LIEC  will  discuss  the  verification results  with 
the PMO and the implementing agencies, suggest corrective actions, and reflect findings in their 
EMP implementation and environmental monitoring verification reports.  
103.  The  results  of  environmental  inspection  and  monitoring  will  be  used  to  assess  (i)  the 
extent  and  severity  of  actual  environmental  impacts  against  predicted  impacts;  (ii)  the 
effectiveness  of  the  EMP  mitigation  measures;  (iii)  compliance  with  environmental  standards 
and regulations; (iv) trends in impacts; (v) overall effectiveness of the EMP implementation; and 
(vi)  the  need  for  additional  mitigation  measures  and  corrective  actions,  if  noncompliance  is 
observed. 
104.  Within  3  months  after  each  subproject  completion,  or  no  later  than  1  year  with 
permission  of  the  local  EPBs,  environmental  acceptance  monitoring  and  audit  reports  of  each 
subproject  completion  shall  be  (i)  prepared  by  a  licensed  environmental  monitoring  institute  in 
accordance  with  the  PRC’s  Guideline  on  Project  Completion  Environmental  Audit  (2001),  (ii) 
reviewed  for  approval  of  the  official  commencement  of  individual  subproject  operation  by 
environmental  authorities,  and  (iii)  finally  reported to  ADB  through  the  annual  EMP  monitoring 
and progress reporting process.  
105.  Resettlement  monitoring.  Internal  and  external  monitoring  of  the  resettlement  plan 
implementation  will  be  conducted.  The  PMO  and  ZIFC  will  carry  out  internal  supervision  and 
monitoring  to  ensure  compliance  with  the  provisions  of  the  resettlement  plan,  and  submit 
internal  resettlement  monitoring  reports  semiannually  during  project  implementation,  to  be 
submitted together with the regular project monitoring report (footnote 24). The PMO and ZIFC 
will  also  employ  an  external  monitoring  institute  or  firm  to  conduct  external  monitoring.  The 
external  monitoring  agency  will  prepare  a  baseline  study,  and  implement  external  monitoring 
and evaluation of the resettlement plan implementation. Semiannual external monitoring reports 
will  be  prepared  and  submitted  to  ADB  during  resettlement  implementation;  and  annual 
evaluation  reports  will  be  forwarded  to  the  PMO  and  ADB  for  2  years  after  conclusion  of  the 
resettlement implementation.  
106.  Ethnic minority  development  plan monitoring. The implementation of the EMDP will 
be  monitored  and  reported  semiannually  to  ADB.  The  social  development  and  gender 
specialists, to be recruited under the loan financing, will work with the PMO and ZIFC to set up 
an appropriate monitoring system and assist with the preparation of reports. The PMO’s social 
safeguards  officer,  with  the  assistance  of  the  specialists,  will  coordinate  and  monitor  the 
implementation of the EMDP (footnote 22). 
107.  Gender action plan monitoring. This will be incorporated into the overall M&E plan for 
the project. The PMO and ZIFC will be responsible for establishing and coordinating  M&E. An 
ADB staff with expertise in gender issues will participate in the midterm review. The social and 
72 
gender  development  specialists  will  work  with  the  PMO  and  ZIFC  staff  to  create  a  detailed 
implementation  and  monitoring  plan  for  each  of  the  tasks  outlined,  help  to  complete  the  first 
GAP  implementation  report,  and  review  the  second  report  prepared  by  the  implementing 
agencies.  
C. 
Evaluation 
108. 
In  addition  to  regular  monitoring,  project  performance  will  be  reviewed  at  least  once  a 
year jointly by ADB, HPFD, and the national government. The review will assess implementation 
performance  and  achievement  of  project  outcomes  and  outputs,  assess  financial  progress, 
identify issues and constraints affecting implementation, and work out a time-bound action plan 
for their resolution. ADB, HPFD, and the national government will undertake a midterm review to 
assess implementation status and take appropriate measures—including modification of scope 
and  implementation  arrangements,  and  reallocation  of  loan  proceeds,  as  appropriate—to 
achieve the project impact and outcome.  Feedback from the PPMS activities will be analyzed. 
Within 3 months of physical completion of the project, the PMO will submit a project completion 
report  to  ADB  (footnote  25).  During  the  midterm  review,  a  procurement  review  for  effective 
implementation  shall  also  be  conducted  to  identify  risks  in  procurement  and  measures  for 
improved procurement performance. 
D. 
Reporting  
109.  The  PMO  will  provide  ADB  with  (i)  quarterly  project  progress  reports  in  a  format 
consistent with ADB’s PPMS (footnote 21); (ii) semiannual environmental monitoring report; (iii) 
semiannual resettlement monitoring report; (iv) audited accounts within 6 months of the end of 
each fiscal year; and (iv) a project completion report within 3 months of physical completion of 
the project (footnote 25). The PMO will also forward external resettlement M&E reports to ADB. 
The  PMO  will  report  to  ADB  the  implementation  progress  of  the  GAP  and  SDAP  through  the 
project progress reports. To ensure projects continue to be both viable and sustainable, project 
accounts  and the  executing  agency  audited  financial  statements,  together  with  the  associated 
auditor's report, should be adequately reviewed.

Stakeholder Communication Strategy  
111.  Project  information  will  be  communicated  through  public  consultation,  information 
disclosure mechanism  in  the  website  of  the  national  government  and  ADB  website,  meetings, 
interviews, focus group discussions, and community consultation meetings, in accordance with 
ADB’s  requirements  of  information  disclosure  policy.  Extensive  consultation  will  take  place  on 
aspects  of  infrastructure  design  and  design  of  nonstructural  measures,  such  as  awareness 
raising  campaigns  with  institutional  stakeholders,  beneficiaries,  and  affected  persons.  In  the 
consultative meetings, participants—including male, female, and poor and vulnerable residents, 
and  other  significant  stakeholders—will  be  consulted  about  concerns  or  complaints  raising 
mechanisms, information needs, and further consultation expectations. 
112.  Environment.  Extensive  consultation  was  carried  out  with  affected  people  and  other 
concerned stakeholders during project preparation. Direct public participation was conducted as 
an ongoing element in the development of the suboutputs. These activities were carried out by 
the implementing agencies in their preparation of the feasibility study reports and EIAs and by 
the  PPTA  consultants  following  the  PRC’s  National  Environmental  Impact  Assessments 
Technical  Guidelines  and  ADB’s  SPS.  Future  consultation  will  include  involvement  of  affected 
people  in  monitoring  impacts  and  mitigation  measures  during  construction  and  operation; 
evaluating environmental and economic benefits and social impacts; and interviewing the public 
after the project is completed. During construction, the affected people will be consulted through 
formal questionnaire surveys and informal interviews by the on-site environmental engineers of 
the construction contractors, the CSCs, and voluntary monitors of the local residents living in the 
74 
project areas, especially those around the construction sites. A project public complaints unit will 
be established in the PMO to coordinate the project GRM.  
113.  Resettlement. All affected villages and the directly affected households will be involved 
throughout  the  project  cycle,  starting  from  planning,  implementation,  and  M&E.  Through 
meetings,  interviews,  socioeconomic  surveys,  focus  group  discussions,  public  consultation 
workshops, and community consultation meetings, local representatives have participated in the 
planning, and concerns have been integrated into the resettlement plan. Before implementation, 
the  PMO  and  the  implementing  agencies  will  further  discuss  and  consult  with  the  affected 
persons’  representatives  on  potential  impacts  and  the  detailed  compensation  plan  to  ensure 
interests  are  protected  and  to  provide  employment  opportunities  for  the  affected  persons’ 
livelihoods  as  a  result  of  project  implementation.  The  PMO  and  ZIFC  will  disclose  the  final 
resettlement plan in relevant government offices and to affected people in local language. The 
draft  resettlement  plan  has  been  posted  on  the  ADB  website  and  disclosed  to  the  affected 
households.  The  respective  implementing  agency  will  establish  project  resettlement  units  for 
supervision  of  implementation,  particularly  of  the  temporary  land  acquisition,  continued  public 
consultation,  monitoring  of  progress,  and  response  to  grievances.  The  grievance  redress 
procedures  have  been  established  and  explanations  have  been  included  in  the  resettlement 
plan.  The  resettlement  plans  also  contain  a  public  consultation  schedule  and  detailed 
description of the progress. 
114.  Other  social  safeguard  and  dimensions. Consultations with communities have taken 
place  at  different  points  in  the  preparation  of  the  EMDP,  GAP,  and  SDAP  within  the 
components.  They  have  been  designed  not  only  to  inform  people  about  the  component  or 
specific activities related to its preparation and implementation, but also to enable people in the 
community  to  ask  questions,  make  suggestions,  state  preferences,  and  express  concerns. 
Further consultation will be conducted during EMDP, GAP, and SDAP implementation. Special 
attention will be paid to the participation of women and any other vulnerable groups, such as the 
poor. 
115.  Specifically,  the  purpose  of  the  community  C&P  plan  is  to  engage  the  project 
beneficiaries  and  other  affected  stakeholders  in  meaningful  consultation  and  decision-making 
process.  Informing  them  about  the  proposed  project,  and  consulting  them  on  various  issues 
related  prior  to  and/or  during  project  implementation  is  essential  to  achieve  proactive  and 
meaningful  people’s  participation.  The  stakeholders  identified  involved  the  following:  local 
government  authorities,  including  the  district,  city,  township,  and  village  leaders;  concerned 
government agencies; local people, including women, ethnic minorities, households affected by 
resettlement,  private  sector,  and/or  nongovernment  organizations,  and  farmers  collectives 
and/or  associations;  and  other  stakeholders  who  will  be  affected  or  may  have  interest  on  the 
proposed projects. The following table summarizes the community C&P plan.

users of water in the households. Lack of 
access to reliable and safe water, and 
poor health and sanitation result to 
increase in diseases adding to their 
domestic burden (i.e., fetching water, 
taking care of sick HH members, and 
other traditional roles). 
Women will have more time to attend to 
productive tasks, including economic 
activities.

X. 
ANTICORRUPTION POLICY  
116. 
ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any violations 
of the Anticorruption Policy relating to the project.28 All contracts financed by ADB shall include 
provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the 
executing agency and all project contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers. 
Individuals and/or entities on ADB’s anticorruption debarment list are ineligible to participate in 
an ADB-financed activity and may not be awarded any contracts under the project.29  
117.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  are  included  in  the  draft  loan  and  project 
agreements, and the bidding documents for the project. The project design and implementation 
arrangements provide for mitigating corruption risks. Risks associated with project management 
will  be  mitigated  by  (i)  training  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies’  staff  in  the 
procurement of civil  works, goods,  and services under the project; (ii) setting up a supervisory 
body  in  place  to  prevent  undue  interference  in  business  practices,  and  making  adequate 
resources  available  for  its  effective  operation;  and  (iii)  conducting  periodic  inspections  of 
contractors’  activities  relating  to  fund  withdrawals  and  settlements  by  the  executing  agency’s 
staff.  The  executing  and  implementing  agencies  shall  also  initiate  liaison  meetings  with  the 
Prosecutor’s  Office,  as  needed,  to  discuss  any  warnings  about,  or  information  on,  alleged 
corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the investment program. 
XI. 
ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISM 
118.  People who  are,  or may  in the future  be,  adversely  affected  by the  project  may  submit 
complaints  to  ADB’s  Accountability  Mechanism.  The  Accountability  Mechanism  provides  an 
independent  forum  and  process  whereby  people  adversely  affected  by  ADB-assisted  projects 
can voice, and seek a resolution of their problems, as well as report alleged violations of ADB’s 
operational  policies  and  procedures.  Before  submitting  a  complaint  to  the  Accountability 
Mechanism, affected people should make a good faith effort to solve their problems by working 
with  the  concerned  ADB  operations  department.  Only  after  doing  that,  and  if  they  are  still 
dissatisfied, should they approach the Accountability Mechanism.30

81 
ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PLAN  
FOR THE HUNAN DONGJIANG LAKE 
INTEGRATED ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION 
AND MANAGEMENT PROJECT 
People’s Republic of China 
Prepared by the Zixing City Government for the Asian Development Bank 
This  environmental  management  plan  is  a  document  of  the  borrower.  The  views  expressed 
herein  do  not  necessarily  represent  those  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank’s  (ADB)  Board  of 
Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature. Your attention is directed to 
the  “terms  of  use”  section  of  the  ADB  website  in  which  the  full  environmental  impact 
assessment is given. 
In  preparing  any  country  program  or  strategy,  financing  any  project,  or  by  making  any 
designation  of  or  reference  to  a  particular  territory  or  geographic  area  in  this  document,  ADB 
does not intend to make any judgments as to the legal or other status of any territory or area. 
82 
A. 
Objectives 
1. 
This environmental management plan (EMP) is for the Hunan Dongjiang Lake Integrated 
Environmental  Protection  and  Management  Project  in Zixing  City  of Hunan  Province,  People’s 
Republic of China (PRC). The EMP complies with the Safeguard Policy Statement (SPS, 2009) 
of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB);1 and  is  based  on  the  domestic  environmental  impact 
assessments (EIAs) prepared by the Guangdong Environmental Protection Engineering Design 
Institute (pollution control component), the Zhongnan Engineering Corporation Limited (urban–
rural  water  supply  and  river  course  rehabilitation  components),  and  the  Chenzhou  Municipal 
Environmental  Protection  Research  Institute  (ecosystem  rehabilitation  component)  and  the 
project EIA.2 
The  EMP  describes  the  roles  and  responsibilities  of  all  project  agencies  to  implement 
2. 
this plan; mitigation measures; inspection, monitoring, and reporting arrangements; training and 
institutional strengthening; grievance redress mechanism (GRM); and future public consultation.  
In  the  design  stage,  the  project  management  office  (PMO)  will  pass  this  EMP  to  the 
3. 
design institutes for  incorporating mitigation measures  into  the  detailed  designs. The  EMP  will 
be updated at the end of the detailed design, as needed. To ensure that bidders will respond to 
the  EMP’s  provisions,  the  PMO  and  local  project  implementation  units (PIUs)  will  prepare  and 
provide the following specification clauses for incorporation into the bidding documents: (i) a list 
of  environmental  management requirements to  be budgeted  by  the  bidders  in their  proposals; 
(ii)  environmental  clauses  for  contractual  terms  and  conditions;  and  (iii)  component  domestic 
EIAs and the project EIA, including the updated EMP for compliance (footnote 2). 
B. 
Organizations and their Responsibilities for Implementation of the Environmental 
Management Plan 
The  EMP 
implementation  arrangements  and 
responsibilities  of  government 
4. 
organizations are summarized in Table EMP-1. The Zixing City Government (ZCG) is the project 
executing agency (EA). The EA is responsible for communication with ADB, loan onlending and 
repayment,  as  well  as  supervision  and  guidance  of  the  Zixing  City  PMO  and  implementing 
agencies  (IAs)  during  the  project  implementation.  A  project  leading  group  (PLG)  has  been 
established,  chaired  by  the  mayor  and  comprises  senior  officials  from  relevant  government 
agencies, to facilitate inter-agency coordination, and resolve any institutional problems affecting 
project implementation at municipal level. 
The PMO will conduct daily management and coordination during project implementation 
5. 
on behalf of the PLG. 
The  Zixing  City  Urban  and  Rural  Environmental  Protection  Financing  Center  (ZIFC)  is 
6. 
the IA. Within the ZIFC, there are four functional departments: administration, finance, technical 
engineering, and contract management. ZIFC will (i) engage and supervise engineering design 
institutes,  tendering  company,  and  the  project  management  consulting  service  during  project 
implementation; and (ii) report on progress.

 Two  rounds  of  public  consultation  were  conducted  during  project  preparation  (Section 
VIII  of  the  EIA).  During  construction,  the  project  will  continue  to  seek  public  consultation  and 
raise  awareness  of  project  activities,  especially  those  which  may  impact  the  public,  such  as 
noise  or  dust.  The  project  public  consultation  plan  is  in  Table  EMP-7,  and  includes  public 
participation  in  evaluating  environmental  benefits  and  impacts.  The  PIUs  are  responsible  for 
public  participation  during  project  implementation.  They  will  be  supported  by  the  PMO 
environment and social officers and the loan implementation consultants.

Grievance Redress Mechanism 
The GRM has been established to receive and manage any public environmental and/or 
24. 
social issues which may arise due to the project. The PMO environment and social officers will 
coordinate the GRM. However, all project agencies and staff will be trained in the GRM and will 
take an active role in supporting these staff as and when necessary. 
25. 
At the PMO level, the PMO environment and social officers will establish a GRM tracking 
and documentation system, conduct daily coordination with the PIU officers, arrange meetings 
and  conduct  site  visits  as  necessary,  maintain the  overall  project GRM  database,  and  prepare 
the  reporting  inputs  for  progress  reports  to  ADB.  At  the  PIU  level,  the  environment  and  social 
officers  will  instruct  contractors  and  CSCs  on  the  GRM  procedures,  and  coordinate  with  the 
county  EPBs  and  other  government  divisions,  as  necessary.  The  PMO  and  PIU  staff  will  be 
trained and supported by the LIEC and the loan implementation social consultant (LISC).  
26. 
The  contact  persons  for  different  GRM  entry  points,  such  as  the  PMO  and  PIU 
environment  and  social  officers,  contractors,  operators  of  project  facilities  (OPFs),  and  county 
EPBs,  will  be  identified  prior  to  construction.  The  contact  details  for  the  entry  points  (phone 
numbers,  addresses,  e-mail  addresses)  will  be  publicly  disclosed  on  information  boards  at 
construction sites and on the websites of the PMO and county EPBs.  
27. 
Once  a  complaint  is  received  and  filed,  the  PMO  and  PIU  officers  will  identify  if 
complaints are eligible. Eligible complaints include those where (i) the complaint pertains to the 
project; and (ii) the issues arising in the complaint fall within the scope of environmental issues 
that  the  GRM  is  authorized  to  address.  Ineligible  complaints  include  those  where  (i)  the 
complaint is clearly not project-related; (ii) the nature of the issue is outside the mandate of the 
environmental GRM (such as issues related to resettlement, allegations of fraud, or corruption); 
and  (iii)  other  procedures  are  more  appropriate  to  address  the  issue.  Ineligible  complaints  will 
be recorded and passed to the relevant authorities, and the complainant will be informed of the 
decision and reasons for rejection. The procedure and timeframe for the GRM is as follows and 
also summarized in Figure EMP-1.

Stage  1  (5  days).  If  a  concern  arises  during  construction,  the  affected  person 
may submit a written or oral complaint to the contractor. Whenever possible, the 
contractor will resolve the issue directly with the affected person. The contractor 
shall  give  a  clear  reply  within  5  working  days.  The  contractor  will  keep  the  PIU 
fully informed at all stages. 
Stage 2 (5 days). If the issue cannot be resolved in Stage 1 after 5 days, the PIU 
and/or  PMO  will  take  over  responsibility.  Eligibility  of  the  complaint  will  be 
assessed and a recommended solution given to the complainant and contractors 
within  5  working  days.  If  the  solution  is  agreed  by  the  complainant,  the 
contractors  and/or  facility  operators  will  implement  the  solution  within  7  days. 
Written records will be made of all stages and outcomes. 
(iii) 
Stage 3 (10 days). If no solution can be identified by the PMO and/or PIU; and/or 
the complainant is not satisfied with the proposed solution, the PMO and/or PIU 
98 
will  organize  within  10  days  a  stakeholder  meeting  (including  the  complainant, 
contractor  and/or  operator  of  the  facility,  county  EPB,  PIU,  PMO).  A  solution 
acceptable to all shall be identified, including clear steps. The contractors (during 
construction) and facility operators (during operation) will immediately implement 
the agreed solution. Written records will be made of all stages and outcomes. 
28. 
The  GRM  does  not  affect  the  right  of  an  affected  person  to  submit  their  complaints  to 
any  agency  they  wish  to, for  example,  the  local village committee, community  leaders,  courts, 
the PMO, PIU, and/or ADB. 
29. 
The  PMO  and  PIUs  shall  bear  any  and  all  costs  of  implementing  the  GRM,  including 
meeting, travel,  and/or  accommodation  costs  of the  project  staff or  affected  person.  The GRM 
will  be  implemented  throughout  project  construction  and  at  least  the  first  year  of  operation  for 
each project facility. 
H. 
Cost Estimates 
This  section  provides  an  estimate  of  the  cost  of  EMP  implementation.  The  cost 
30. 
comprises three categories: mitigation measures (Table EMP-3); monitoring (Table EMP-4); and 
training (Table EMP-6). Costs are presented for the construction phase of 5 years; and the first 
year of operation, i.e., a total of 6 years. The costs do not include (i) detailed design revisions 
and adjustments; (ii) internal monitoring and/or inspection of solid wastes disposal, soil erosion 
and  re-vegetation,  and  occupational  health  and  safety  during  construction,  as  this  will  be 
included  in  the  construction  supervision  contracts;  and  (iii)  salaries  of  the  PMO  and  PIU  staff. 
Costs for mitigation measures and training are based on estimates in the domestic EIAs and/or 
the experience of the project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) team from other projects. 
All costs were discussed with the the EIA institute, the PMO, and IAs. 
31. 
The total estimated cost for EMP implementation is  CNY15.943 million (US$2,571,452) 
for 5-year construction (Table EMP-8). The estimated cost for the PMO is CNY 754,000 (4.7%) 
and  for  contractors  is  about  CNY14,594,000  (91.5%).  About  CNY595,000  (3.7%)  will  be  paid 
from  the  ADB  loan  consulting  services  and  remaining  costs  by  the  IAs.  Total  costs  are  small 
given the large scale of the project and when spread over 5 years.

I. 
Mechanisms for Feedback and Adjustment 
32. 
Based  on  environmental  inspection  and  monitoring  reports,  the  PMO  and  PIUs  shall 
decide,  in  consultation  with  the  LIEC,  whether  (i)  further  mitigation  measures  are  required  as 
corrective  actions,  or  (ii)  some  improvements  are  required  for  environmental  management 
practices. The effectiveness of mitigation measures and monitoring plans will be evaluated by a 
feedback  reporting  system.  Adjustment  to  the  EMP  will  be  made,  if  necessary.  The  PMO 
environment officers will play a critical role in the feedback and adjustment mechanism. 
33. 
If during inspection, substantial deviation from the EMP is observed or any changes are 
made to the project that may cause substantial adverse environmental impacts or increase the 
number of affected people, then the PMO and PIUs will immediately consult with ADB and form 
an  environmental  assessment  team  to  conduct  additional  environmental  assessment.  If 
necessary, further public consultation will be undertaken. The revised domestic EIAs and project 
EIA,  including this  EMP,  will  be  submitted  to  ADB for review,  appraisal, and  public  disclosure. 
The revised EMP will be passed to the contractors, CSCs, and OPFs for implementation.

APPENDIX 1: DRAFT TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR ENVIRONMENTAL POSITIONS 
I. 
PROJECT MANAGEMENT OFFICE ENVIRONMENT OFFICER 
A. 
Background 
1. 
Development  projects  supported  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  routinely 
include a project management office (PMO). The PMO is responsible for project implementation 
and comprises the provincial and/or municipal agencies involved in the project. Compliance with 
the  loan  and  project  agreements  includes  implementation  of  an  environmental  management 
plan  (EMP),  which  is  prepared  as  part  of  the  project  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA). 
The EMP is the critical guiding document to manage, monitor, and report upon potential project 
environmental impacts. Implementation of the EMP is a full-time task. For this reason, the PMO 
assigns  at  least  one  full-time  officer  for  this  role.  These  terms  of  reference  describe  the 
requirements for this officer. 
B. 
SCOPE AND DURATION OF WORK 
The officer will work on behalf of the PMO to implement the project EMP. The officer will 
2. 
report directly to the PMO. The position is for the entire project duration.
