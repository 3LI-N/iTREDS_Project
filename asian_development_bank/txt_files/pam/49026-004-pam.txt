Project Administration Manual Purpose and Process 
  The  project  administration  manual  (PAM)  describes  the  essential  administrative  and 
management requirements to implement the project on time, within budget, and in accordance 
with the policies and procedures of the government and Asian Development Bank (ADB). The 
PAM  should  include  references  to  all  available  templates  and  instructions  either  through 
linkages to relevant URLs or directly incorporated in the PAM. 
  The provincial people’s Committees of Binh Dinh and Quang Nam provinces as the executing 
agencies, and with the Binh Dinh Professional Project Management Unit for Agricultural and 
Rural  Development  Projects  and  Quang  Nam  Professional  Project  Management  Unit  for 
Transport  Construction  Works  as  implementing  agencies,  are  wholly  responsible  for  the 
implementation  of  ADB-financed  projects,  as  agreed  jointly  between the borrower  and  ADB, 
and in accordance with the policies and procedures of the government and ADB. ADB staff is 
responsible  for  supporting  implementation  including  compliance  by  the  executing  and 
implementing  agencies  of  their  obligations  and  responsibilities  for  project  implementation  in 
accordance with ADB’s policies and procedures. 
  At loan negotiations, the borrower and ADB shall agree to the PAM and ensure consistency 
with the loan and grant agreements. Such agreements shall be reflected in the minutes of the 
loan negotiations. In the event of any discrepancy or contradiction between the PAM and the 
loan and grant agreements, the provisions of the loan and grant agreements shall prevail. 
After ADB Board approval of the project's report and recommendations of the President (RRP), 
changes in implementation arrangements are subject to agreement and approval pursuant to 
relevant government and ADB administrative procedures (including the Project Administration 
Instructions) and upon such approval, they will be subsequently incorporated in the PAM. 
I. 
PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
1. 
The Climate Resilient Inclusive Infrastructure for Ethnic Minorities Project I (CRIEM I, the 
“project”) will improve will promote inclusive socioeconomic growth directly to 243,000 people of 
which 126,300 are ethnic minorities in Binh Dinh and Quang Nam provinces in the south-central 
coastal region by upgrading transport and water resource infrastructures and providing improved 
access to reliable weather and climate data. The two target provinces comprise 3.1 million people, 
of which 6% belong to ethnic minority communities (EMCs). EMCs are mostly concentrated in 
nine of the 29 districts and constitute an average of 45% of the population.1 
2. 
The project is aligned with the following impact: inclusive socioeconomic development of 
Binh Dinh and Quang Nam provinces accelerated. The project will have the following outcome: 
social and economic status and inclusiveness of ethnic minorities communities improved.  
3. 
The project outcome will be achieved through the following outputs:  
Output  1:  Climate-resilient  transport  infrastructure  improved.  The  project  will 
4. 
upgrade seven roads totaling about 121.8 kilometers (km) in seven project districts, with design 
standards  which  include  climate  resilience.2  The  upgraded  transport  links  will  enhance  the 
integration  of  remote  rural  production  sites  with  markets  and  processing  facilities,  including 
improving the freight movement of acacia and high value crops, thereby improving connectivity 
and mobility of EMCs. The enhanced transport network will also reduce travel time for road users 
and improve access to health, education, and market services, especially for women who suffer 
from time poverty. 
5. 
Output 2: Climate-resilient water resource infrastructure improved. This output will 
(i) construct RDWS to provide water to about 18,600 people through 115 km of piped networks in 
An  Lao  district  in  BDP;  (ii)  upgrade  an  existing  reservoir  to  support  117  hectares  of  irrigation 
command area with a more reliable and efficient water supply in Phuoc Son district in QNP; and 
(iii) construct cultural tourism infrastructure, including one river defense (3.6 km of embankment), 
visitor car parking, and solid waste collection in Tay Giang district in QNP, with a total population 
of 17,700 including 94% from EMCs. Activities under this output will benefit about 36,300 people 
improve  the  health  of  communities  by  reducing  the  risk  of  waterborne  diseases  and  will 
particularly benefit women by reducing the time they spend in water collection. 
6. 
Output 3: Data systems for climate risk management updated. This output will provide 
improved access to reliable weather and climate data in a timely and cost-effective manner. These 
data will help strengthen early warning systems, improve disaster response, and inform a wide 
range of decisions, including those related to the design of climate resilient infrastructure.3 High-
level online technology will be introduced to improve the capacity of the provincial governments 
to manage, collect, archive, and share data through client interfaces. 
7. 
The  project  preparation  follows  a  sector-project  approach  where  representative 
subprojects  are  prepared  for  the  key  outputs.  These  representative  subprojects  are  used  to 
1  The project districts in BDP are An Lao, Hoai Nhon, Van Canh, Vinh Thanh; and in QNP are Bac Tra My, Nam Tra 
My, Nam Giang, Phuc Son, and Tay Giang. 
2  The seven project districts are An Lao, Hoai Nhon, Van Canh, and Vinh Thanh districts in BDP; and Bac Tra My, 
Nam Giang, and Nam Tra My districts in QNP. 
3  The extent and type of investment will vary between the two project provinces, with consideration of the ongoing 
investments in QNP financed by the World Bank under the Dam Rehabilitation and Safety Project and by ADB under 
the  Urban  Environment  and  Climate  Change  Adaptation  Project,  which  is  developing  and  implementing  a  flood 
forecasting and warning system for Hoi An and Vu Gia-Thu Bon river basin. 
2 
establish the feasibility of proposed investments along with project due diligence undertaken by 
ADB transaction technical assistance (TRTA). 
8. 
A total of 11 shortlisted subprojects including seven for output 1 and four for output 2 are 
proposed for implementation (Tables 1 and 2). The ADB TRTA prepared two subproject feasibility 
studies  in  BDP,  one for each  output.  All  shortlisted  subprojects  were  visited  by the  TRTA  and 
screened for eligibility except for one riverbank protection subproject in Tay Giang district, QNP. 
This subproject relates to a government-funded flood protection program in this district, and its 
proposed  site  will  be  highly  modified  by  a  stream  dam  to  be  built  under  the  government  flood 
protection  program.  The  dam  will  affect  water  elevations,  water  velocities  which  need  to  be 
confirmed prior to detailed design procedures being contracted.

population  levels,  non-household  water  demand  and  non-revenue  water 
and operating margins. 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
11. 
For output 3, the project prioritizes investments to access the use of existing hydromet 
network data since there has been a very high density of field data stations in both provinces. 
Investment selection is based on data management systems for online storage and access for 
both clients and users, which are integrated with existing early warning systems, decision support 
models,  and  the  provision  of  flood  risk  assessments  to  road  network  infrastructure.  The  only 
technology to be used within the field data network is to develop site-based flood warning systems 
for infrastructure and associated communities (Appendix 1). 
12. 
The scope of investment is limited to: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
Client data server technology and supporting infrastructure;  
User interfaces; 
Risk assessment technologies; and 
Local site-based flood and water level monitoring with linked early warning systems 
for no more than 8–10 sites.  
6 
ADB will approve bidding and detailed design documents for each subproject only after  
13. 
all  compensation  entitlements  within  the  resettlement  and  ethnic  minority  development  plans 
(REMDPs)  are fully  settled.  No  works  undertaken  prior to  all  entitlements  being  settled  will  be 
financed by ADB.  
14. 
Subproject feasibility studies will be carried out in conformity with the above criteria. The 
feasibility  studies  will  be  undertaken  for  each  subproject  independently  and  will  include  a 
preliminary design based on 30% of the field site survey data points, an updated bill of quantity, 
completed  initial  environmental  examinations  (IEE)  and  resettlement  and  ethnic  minorities 
development  plans  (REMDP),  financial  and  economic  cost  assessment,  social  and  poverty 
assessment  for  monitoring  baselines  to  ensure  the  subproject  meets  all  relevant  ADB  and 
government  due  diligence  requirements  and  thresholds.  Only  subprojects  with  an  approved 
feasibility study will be eligible to proceed to DED process. A subproject short-list description is 
provided in Appendix 2.

all funds received for the implementation of the project. MOF will sign an on-lending agreement with 
each province.  
2. 
Executing Agency-– Project Owner  
The PPCs of BDP and QNP are the executing agencies. Each PPC shall assign one PPC 
17. 
member with a rank of Chairperson and/or Vice-Chairperson to assume overall responsibility for 
project  implementation  and  coordination.  For  key  project  activities  (i.e.,  REMDP,  procurement 
plan, consultants’ terms of reference (TOR), and bid evaluation reports), the Chairperson and/or 
Vice-Chairperson will be the approving authority. 
3. 
Implementing Agency 
18. 
Binh  Dinh  professional  project  management  unit  (PPMU)  for  agricultural  and  rural 
development projects (Decision No. 3337/QĐ-UBND dated 22 September 2016, in accordance 
with Law on Construction 2014) and Quang Nam PPMU of transport construction works (Decision 
1587/UBND-KTTH dated 26 March 2019) will be the implementing agencies. The implementing 
agencies  have  the  authority  and  delegated  responsibility  to  form  professional  project 
management units (PPMUs) and are legally required to do so within 30 days after loan signing. 
4. 
Professional Project Management Unit 
Each PPMU led by a Project Director will be directly accountable to the PPC. The structure 
19.

by  the  PPMUs.  They  shall  be  responsible  for  the  technical  aspects  of  the  feasibility  studies 
including the economic and financial analysis, all safeguard issues, land acquisition assessments 
required  for  preparing  the  IEEs  and  where  appropriate  REMDPs,  GAP,  poverty  and  social 
assessments,  and  inclusion  of  road  safety  and  climate  resilient  measures  in  accordance  with 
government standards. 
25. 
This will ensure that appropriate measures to (i) build and strengthen the inclusiveness of 
subprojects,  and  (ii)  mitigate  any  negative  social  impacts  including  special  measures  for  land 
acquisition,  compensation,  ethnic  minorities  specific  actions  as  required,  and  to  improve  the 
participation of women and other disadvantaged groups as beneficiaries. 
Upon completion of the subproject feasibility studies each PPMU shall use the consultant 
26. 
services provided through the LIC, to review the feasibility studies to ensure that: (i) appropriate 
technical  standards  are  incorporated  in  the  design  and  that  the  costs  applied  reflect  realistic 
market  estimates;  and  (ii)  ADB’s  and  the  government’s  social  and  environmental  safeguards 
requirements  are  duly  addressed.  The  review  will  be  completed  and  reported  prior  to  DED 
contracts are procured to ensure the invitation for bid is accurate.  
27. 
Once reviewed, the PPMUs will submit the feasibility studies to the PPCs for approval. 
ADB  will  review  all  feasibility  studies  and  associated  documents.  ADB’s  comments  will  be 
incorporated for safeguard compliance. Each executing agency will be ultimately responsible for 
the quality and compliance of their feasibility studies. 
All additional subproject feasibility studies for output 1 roads will include a traffic forecast 
28. 
derived from traffic counts of baseline traffic demand. The traffic forecasts will be presented in the 
summary  of  each  feasibility  study  for  the  economic  life  of  the  proposed  road  investment.  The 
technical design standard for the road engineering must be consistent with the assessed traffic 
demand  -  specified  in  daily  PCU  terms  according  to the  Viet  Nam  Design  Specification  TCVN 
4054 (Table 7). 
29.  Where  the road  traffic  forecast  spans  more  than one  PCU category  the  standard to  be 
applied will be based on the design category that is consistent with the traffic forecast at year 10 
of the projection. Where the indicated design category differs from the provincial master plan or 
the  proposed  subproject  design  standard  indicated  in  the  government  investment  policy,  the 
PPMU  and  PPC  will  confirm  the  design  standard  to  be  used  as  the  standard  indicated  by  the 
traffic forecast under regulation TCVN 4054. Technical standards for bridges will reflect the PCU 
for  a  30-year  projection  reflecting  the  expected  economic  life  of  such  structures.  All  technical 
design specifications will incorporate the impacts of climate change using RCP8.5 projections for 
early mid-century projections as reported by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment 
and ADB.   
21 
All output 1 subprojects are required to include full drainage options both horizontal and 
30. 
longitudinal for the entire section, exclusion of drainage as a cost saving strategy will result in the 
project being ineligible for ADB finance.  
31. 
implementing the proposed actions.  
Output  1  subproject  designs  will  include  a  road  safety  audit  and  investment  for 
32. 
The economic assessment of the subproject must reflect the same assumption and same 
traffic forecast data to ensure capital investment costs are consistent with the expected benefit 
streams. This requirement will remove bias of inflated economic internal rate of return estimates 
from  the  use  of  a  higher  traffic  forecast,  or  alternately,  applying  a  capital  investment  that  is 
insufficient  to  construct  the  category  of  road  required  by  the  traffic  forecast  and  the  estimated 
project economic benefits. ADB guidelines for the economic assessment of transport subprojects 
will be adhered too.

Where  the  indicated  design  category  differs  from  the  provincial  master  plan  or  the 
proposed subproject design standard indicated in the government investment policy, the PPMU 
and PPC will confirm the design standard to be used in compliance with the standard indicated 
by the traffic forecast under regulation TCXDVN 2007. If a subproject is designed according to a 
standard that differs from the traffic count it will be ineligible for ADB financing.  
ADB will confirm in writing to the PPMU and to file for each subproject feasibility study 
34. 
that the  road  subproject feasibility  assessment  has  a traffic forecast  that is  consistent  with the 
proposed construction design category, and the projected traffic benefits used in the economic 
assessment.  Where  there  is  inconsistency,  ADB  will  notify  the  executing  and  implementing 
agencies that the subproject feasibility is not accepted and is ineligible for ADB financing.

Fund Flow Diagram 
42. 
The  fund  flow  for  the  project  is  based  on  the  government  on-lending  the  OCR  loans 
according to a sub-loan agreement for each executing agency. Figure 3 outlines the various fund 
flow  pathways  and  their  linkage  to  reporting  information  flows.  These  will  cover  both  advance 
account  and  direct  payment  flows  where  ADB  settles  contractor  invoices  directly  to  their  bank 
accounts.  The  significant  risks,  for  example  occur  if  advance  account  replenishments  are  not 
finalized in a timely manner leading to a shortage of funds in the advance accounts managed by 
each PPMU. Counterpart funding will be the sole responsibility of each executing agency and will 
be managed by the Provincial Treasury and the respective PPMU. The PPCs will commit to a 
cashflow  projection  for  counterpart  funds  based  on  a  project  workplan  prepared  prior  to  loan 
effectiveness  by  each  PPMU  for  both  ADB  and  government  financial  resources.  The  timely 
release of funds from the Ministry of Planning and Investments to each province will be closely 
monitored by ADB. Delays identified will be reported within the following month to enable ADB 
and the Ministry of Planning and Investment to discuss remedial actions.

Financial Management Assessment 
V.  FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT 
The overall risk rating is assessed as moderate within the overall financial management 
43. 
assessment (FMA) – See FMA supplementary document, in the context of financial management 
arrangements to support a devolved approach, where the project financing (through MOF) will be 
on-lent to each of the two provinces, and each province is responsible for managing its respective 
work  program.  The  implementing  agencies  have  adequate  capacity  to  manage  the  advance 
account and use the statement of expenditure (SOE) procedures for this project. The FMA uses 
the  ADB  country  partnership  strategy  for  Viet  Nam  for  2016–2020,  the  completed  ADB  FMA 
questionnaires, one for each PPMUs tasked with the management of the respective provincial 
work program for the project, and other consultations.  
44. 
Oversight of the PPMUs is provided by the PPCs, however the day-to-day management 
responsibilities rest with the PPMUs. The assessed risk takes account of risks associated with 
the  entities  themselves,  as  well  as  project  risks  that  are  identified  based  on  experience  from 
current  official  development  assistance  (ODA)  projects.  The  FMA  considered  personnel  and 
capacity,  accounting  policies  and  procedures,  internal  controls,  financial  reporting,  and  audit, 
taking account of inherent risks and project risks. The overall risk rating is assessed as Moderate. 
The main financial management risks that need to be managed by the PPMUs are:  
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
Weaknesses in systems and procedures: 
(a) 
Lack  of  a  comprehensive  financial  management  manual  (FMM).  The 
existing FMMs are focused on disbursements, which leaves approximately 
50%  of  the  complete  financial  management  systems  and  procedures 
without formal guidance. 
(b)  Weak, or a complete lack of, complete accounting and financial reporting 
systems, mainly relating to inadequate accounting software especially for 
financial reporting. 
Limited capacity to implement the financial management systems and procedures 
due to a lack of overall experience with ADB or other ODA projects across both 
PPMUs compounded by the lack of the comprehensive FMM. 
Ensuring  effective  monitoring  and  oversight,  to  provide  assurance  that  financial 
management  systems  and  procedures  are  being  implemented  consistently  and 
correctly,  given  the  proposed  devolved  implementation  approach  (where  each 
PPMU  will  be  responsible  for  managing  its  own  work  program)  as  well  as  the 
varying levels of experience with ODA projects across the PPMUs. 
45. 
The PPMUs have a sound organizational structure as well as qualified and experienced 
financial management staff with a few relatively minor issues to address. This provides a sound 
foundation from which to address the financial management risks that were identified during the 
FMA. 
The  ADB’s  country  partnership  strategy  for  Viet  Nam  2016–2020  highlighted  issues 
46. 
relating to slow and inefficient project performance, and a key aspect of this relates to a lack of 
readiness at the start of projects. The FMA recommends measures to mitigate key FM risks, with 
these mitigation  measures  largely  being  undertaken  prior to  project  start  up,  as  part  of  project 
readiness,  to  improve  project  performance  from  the  start  of  the  project.  These  mitigation 
measures will be the responsibility of the PPMUs.

Disbursement Arrangements 
1.  
Disbursement Arrangements of ADB Loans and HLT Fund Grant Proceeds 
The ADB loans and HLT Fund grant proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB’s 
48. 
Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time), and detailed arrangements 
agreed upon between the government and ADB. Online training for project staff on disbursement 
policies and procedures is available.6 Project staff are encouraged to avail of this training to help 
ensure efficient disbursement and fiduciary control. 
49. 
Advance fund procedure. One advance account for each loan will be established by 
each PPMU. The currency of the advance account is the US Dollar. The advance accounts will 
be established at commercial banks nominated by each PPMU and communicated to ADB by the 
Borrower. The advance account is to be used exclusively for ADB’s share of eligible expenditures. 
The implementing agency, through PPMU, who administers the advance account is accountable 
and responsible for proper use of advances to the advance account. 
50. 
The total outstanding advance to the respective advance account should not exceed the 
estimate of ADB’s share of expenditures to be paid through the respective advance account for 
the  forthcoming  6  months.  The  PPMUs  may  request  for  initial  and  additional  advances  to  the 
advance  accounts  based  on  an  estimate  of  expenditure  sheet  setting  out  the  estimated 
expenditures  to  be  financed  through  the  accounts  for  the  forthcoming  6  months.  Supporting 
documents should be submitted to ADB or retained by the implementing agencies in accordance 
with ADB’s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time) when liquidating 
or replenishing the advance account. 
51. 
Statement  of  expenditure  procedure.  The  SOE  procedure  may  be  used  for 
reimbursement of eligible expenditures or liquidation of advances to the advance account. The 
ceiling  of  SOE  procedure  is  the  equivalent  of  $100,000  equivalent  per  individual  payment. 
Supporting  documents  and  records  for  the  expenditures  claimed  under  the  SOE  should  be 
maintained and made readily available for review by ADB's disbursement and review missions, 
upon  ADB's  request  for  submission  of  supporting  documents  on  a  sampling  basis,  and  for 
independent audit. Reimbursement and liquidation of individual payments in excess of the SOE 
ceiling should be supported by full documentation when submitting the withdrawal application to 
ADB. 
Before the submission of the first withdrawal application, the borrower should submit to 
52. 
ADB sufficient evidence of the authority of the persons who will sign the withdrawal applications 
6  Disbursement eLearning.  
38 
on  behalf  of  the  government,  together  with  the  authenticated  specimen  signatures  of  each 
authorized  person.  The  minimum  value  per  withdrawal  application  is  stipulated  in  the  Loan 
Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time). Individual payments below this 
amount should be paid (i) by the implementing agencies (the respective Department of Planning 
and  Investment)  and  subsequently  claimed  to  ADB  through  reimbursement,  or  (ii) through  the 
advance  fund  procedure,  unless  otherwise  accepted  by  ADB.  The  borrower  should  ensure 
sufficient category and contract balances before requesting disbursements. Use of ADB’s Client 
Portal  for  Disbursements7  system  is  encouraged  for  submission  of  withdrawal  applications  to 
ADB. 
53. 
No withdrawals shall be made from any of the loan and grant accounts for any province 
until the respective Subsidiary Loan Agreement (for on-lending from MOF to each province) and 
the respective Subsidiary Grant Agreement (for on-grant from MOF to each province), in form and 
substance  satisfactory  to  ADB,  has  been  duly  authorized  by,  and  executed  and  delivered  on 
behalf  of  MOF  and  the  concerned  province,  and  is  legally  binding  upon  the  parties  thereto  in 
accordance with its terms. 
2.  
Disbursement Arrangements for Counterpart Funds 
54. 
Counterpart financing estimated at $21.73 million will finance DEDs, support for social 
and  environmental  safeguard  documentation,  approval  procedures,  land  acquisition  and 
compensation costs, loan implementation consultants, independent audit, project management 
overheads,  taxes  and  duties,  and  financial  charges  during  implementation.  Concerning  cash 
contributions,  the  PPMUs  will  be  responsible  for  preparing  disbursement  projections  and  the 
PPCs will be responsible for including the necessary funds in their annual financing plans and 
allocating the funds following government regulations. 
55. 
Personnel and Capacity. The PPMU’s financial staff are permanent government staff, 
within legally defined PPMU structures for each province. All staff are qualified and experienced 
in accounting.  
56. 
Budgeting  System.  The  PPMUs  will  prepare  the  respective  annual  work  plans  and 
budgets – the work plans will be prepared by the PPMU technical division, and the budgets in 
conjunction with the PPMU finance division, for approval by the respective PPC. The work plans 
and budgets will be prepared in accordance with agreed templates and will integrate the physical 
and financial targets. The first work plan will be prepared for the whole life of the project and will 
then be updated based on the project administration manual projections and timelines, costs and 
defines the likely cashflows by quarter. These will be used as the basis for scheduling counterpart 
funds  to  ensure  resources  are  available  for  recruitment  of  loan  implementation  consultants, 
purchase of PPMU equipment sets, payment of tax on any ADB financed procurement, and most 
importantly the preparation of DED, safeguards documents for each procurement package, along 
with the associated finance for land acquisition and linked compensation obligations.  
57. 
Prior  to  loan  effectiveness  –  the  whole  of  life  project  work  plan  will  be  prepared  with  a

available in advance of requirement. 
C. 
Accounting Policies and Financial Reporting  
60. 
The Vietnamese accounting standards and applicable government regulations, including 
Circular 79/2019/TT-BTC, will be followed for the Project, with two additional requirements: (i) the 
following of international public sector standards in respect of the capturing and management of 
conflicts of interest, as well as the associated reporting of related party transactions; and (ii) the 
clear  and  standardized  basis  of  accounting  and  presentation  of  financial  statements,  where 
receipts  are  recognized  when  received  and  expenditures  are  recognized  when  incurred  –  this 
basis is appropriate for ODA projects with non-revenue earning entities, and will be made clear in 
the external audit TOR and audit reports. 
61. 
Separate  accounting  records  will  be  maintained  for  the  project  covering  all  project’s 
funding sources by each executing and implementing agency, with discrete recording of receipts 
and expenditures for each source of financing, and maintaining of the subsidiary ledgers, all within 
an  accounting  system  that  may  be  utilized  by  each  implementing  agency  for  ODA  projects  in 
general. 
62. 
Standardized financial reporting templates will be established for the project – firstly for 
the purposes of improved project management (monthly reporting), with these as the basis for 
reporting to ADB, to the PPCs, and for the audited financial statements for public disclosure. Each 
implementing  agency  will  report  separately,  and  there  will  be  no  consolidated  reports  for  the 
project as a whole. 
63. 
All  reports  and  supporting  documents  for  all  transactions  will  be  maintained  within  a 
records management system that provides a complete audit trail and will be stored and retained 
in accordance with government regulations, to be accessible by authorized users and available 
for audit inspection.  
The integration of activity-based accounting and financial reporting systems will enhance

The  progress  of  financial  management  time-bound  action  plan  (Table  24)  and 
65. 
compliance with financial reporting and auditing requirements will be monitored by ADB review 
missions and during normal program supervision.  
40 
D. 
Auditing and Public Disclosure 
66. 
Each executing agency will cause the detailed project financial statements to be audited 
in accordance with International Standards on Auditing by an independent auditor acceptable to 
ADB following the standard TOR in Appendix 3. The audited project financial statements together 
with  the  auditor’s  opinion  and  management  letter  will  be  presented  in  the  English  language  to 
ADB within 6 months from the end of the fiscal year by the executing agencies.  
The audit reports for the project financial statements will include a management letter 
67. 
and  auditor’s  opinions,  which  cover  (i) whether  the  project  financial  statements  present  an 
accurate  and  fair  view  or  are  presented  fairly,  in  all  material  respects,  in  accordance  with  the 
applicable financial reporting standards; and (ii) whether the proceeds of the loans and grant were 
used only for the purpose of the project.   
68. 
The government, including the PPCs and the implementing agencies, have been made 
aware  of  ADB’s  approach  to  delayed  submission,  and  the  requirements  for  satisfactory  and 
acceptable quality of the audited project financial statements. ADB reserves the right to require a 
change  in  the  auditor  (in  a  manner  consistent  with  the  constitution  of  the  borrower),  or  for 
additional  support  to  be  provided  to  the  auditor,  if  the  audits  required  are  not  conducted  in  a 
manner satisfactory to ADB, or if the audits are substantially delayed. ADB reserves the right to 
verify  the  project's  financial  accounts  to  confirm  that  the  share  of  ADB’s  financing  is  used  in 
accordance with ADB’s policies and procedures. 
69. 
Public disclosure of the audited project financial statements, including the auditor’s opinion 
on the project financial statements, will be guided by ADB’s Access to Information Policy (2018).  
After their review, ADB will disclose the audited project financial statements and the opinion of 
the auditors on the project financial statements no later than 14 days of ADB’s confirmation of 
their acceptability by posting them on ADB’s website. The public disclosure of the external audit 
reports,  with  audited  financial  statements,  will  be  under  one  project  banner.  The  management 
letter, additional auditor’s opinion will not be disclosed.  
70. 
Safeguard of assets. Inventory records of fixed assets are currently considered to be well 
managed and kept up-to-date and reconciled with control accounts of the implementing agencies 
periodically.  The  implementing  agencies  will  conduct  annual  physical  inventory  of  all  project 
assets, and all subproject assets will remain on the implementing agencies project registry until 
formally handed over to the appropriate asset managers on project completion with supporting 
documentation  that  will  be  included  in  the  scope  of  the  external  audit  and  in  project  progress 
reports where assets, receiving entity and date of transfer will be recorded. During construction 
and/or  installation  insurance  shall  be  the  responsibility  of  contractors  and  shall  cover  worker 
compensation for losses due to accidents apart from compensation for property. 
VI.  PROCUREMENT AND CONSULTING SERVICES 
A. 
Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing 
71. 
Neither  advance  contracting  nor  retroactive  financing  is  envisaged  under  the  project, 
however,  there  are  advance  actions  for  the  recruitment  of  consultants  for  (i)  LIC;  (ii)  detailed 
engineering  designs;  and  (iii)  construction  supervision  including  the  preparation  of  terms  of 
reference, request for proposals, and expression of interest prior to the loan signing.

Procurement Packaging and Scheduling 
73.  Works  contracts.  BDP  has  three  subprojects  to  upgrade  and  rehabilitate  roads  and 
bridges  and  one  subproject  to  build  rural  domestic  water  supply  system.  QNP  has  three 
subprojects  to  upgrade  and  rehabilitate  roads  and  bridges,  one  subproject  to  build  river 
revetments, and one subproject to upgrade irrigation and water supply system. 
To improve efficiency, economy and reduce interface problem, each road in the transport 
74. 
sub-projects will be packaged as one single package. 
75. 
Under output 2 in QNP, subproject no. 5 includes construction of one rural domestic water 
supply system and rehabilitation of one irrigation system, which are different in nature; therefore, 
it will be split into one package to build water supply system and one package to rehabilitate the 
irrigation system. 
76. 
Consulting  services.  The  project  includes  two  types  of  consulting  services,  (i) 
consultancy for establishment of client server system in BDP and design of flood risk assessment 
software in QNP, and (ii) construction supervision. The construction supervision for all civil works 
(include both works for output 1 and output 2) will be procured as one package for each province 
to help (i) reduce consulting recruitment transactions, (ii) attract reputable and large consulting 
firms due to the contract volume; and (iii) increase efficiency and achieve cost effectiveness. 
3. 
Procurement Method and Bidding Procedures  
For civil works packages, it is recommended to use national open competitive bidding, e-
77. 
procurement with single stage one envelope bidding procedures and post qualification. 
78. 
For consulting service, fixed budget selection with full-technical proposal is appropriate to 
recruit consultant for the establishment of client server system in BDP and design of flood risk 
assessment software in QNP given the need to recruit high quality consultant and the contract 
will be lump sum type. Construction supervision will be procured through quality- and cost-based 
selection (90:10) and contract is time-based. 
4. 
Specifications 
The civil works packages will be procured using conformance specifications due to nature 
79. 
of the works and the type of contract applied.  
80. 
A detailed TOR for the establishment of client server system and decision support in Binh 
Dinh and design of flood risk assessment software in Quang Nam (output 3) is in Appendix 1. For 
the construction supervision contracting an input-based TOR is provided in Appendix 4 to ensure 
a time based contract that retains all technical positions is maintained from proposal to contract 
award and for the completion of the assignment. 
5. 
Review Requirements 
81. 
Procurement  of  first  contract  for  goods  and  works,  valued  above  $5  million  by  each 
executing agency shall be subject to ADB’s prior review. Succeeding procurement of goods and 
works contracts will be subject to ADB’s post review (sampling) in which ADB reviews documents, 
decisions, and procurement processes, on a sample basis, after contract signing. 
Recruitment  of  all  consulting  service  packages  financed  by  ADB  are  subject  to  prior 
82. 
review.  
45 
6. 
Standstill Period 
83. 
Standstill period is proposed to apply in the procurement of goods and works to provide a 
credible  mechanism  for  addressing  bidding-related  complaints,  reduce  risks,  improve  fairness, 
transparency, and value for money for the project. 
7. 
Standard Bidding Documents and Contract Form 
84. 
The  harmonized  World Bank  and  ADB standard  bidding  documents  for procurement  of 
works and procurement of goods shall be used for works and goods packages following national 
open competitive bidding procedures. ADB standard consulting services documents will be used 
for selection of consulting services in the project.   
8. 
Pricing and Costing Method 
85. 
Admeasurement,  non-adjustable  price  contract  shall  be  used  for  works  contract  with 
duration  below  18  months.  Admeasurement,  adjustable  price  contract  shall  be  used  for  works 
contract with duration from 18 months and more. Lump-sum contract shall be used for design of 
data  management  and  decision  support  systems  to  use  climate  data  and  time-based  input 
contract  with  price  adjustment  is  used  for  construction  supervision  contracts  with  the  duration 
from 18 months and more.

Table 36 provides the detailed inputs proposed for construction supervision teams. The 
93. 
full allocation of the ADB financing limits the ability to add unallocated and also some of the key 
positions  in  these  two  contracts.  It  is  recommended  that  the  contracts  be  awarded  on  the 
evaluation  of  key  experts  in  charge  of  technical  review  of  site-based  engineering  works  for 
transport,  rural  domestic  water  supply,  or  irrigation.  The  non-key  experts  should  simply  be 
assessed on meeting the minimum requirements.

Environment 
VII.  SAFEGUARDS 
94. 
The  overall  project  is  classified  as  Category  B  for  environment  and  all  subprojects  are 
required to be category B or below. The project has an environmental assessment and review 
52 
framework (EARF). Initial environment examinations (IEEs) including environmental management 
plans  (EMPs)  have  been  prepared  for  the  representative  subprojects  and  will  be  updated  and 
approved by ADB to reflect any changes in the subproject during DED. These documents will be 
uploaded onto the ADB website before ADB staff review meeting. 
95. 
The processing of additional subprojects will include an IEE during the feasibility stage to 
be contracted and completed by the executing and implementing agencies. These will be guided 
by the EARF and are expected to be completed prior to bidding of respective civil works packages. 
Further the DED consultant will also be required to provide environmental safeguard input to the 
design process. The approved EMP will be integrated in the bidding and civil work contracts. A 
subproject construction linked EMP will be produced by the contractor prior to commencement of 
any works including site clearance, this CEMP will detail mitigation measures to be implemented 
in each construction package and will be submitted to PPMU for review. 
The  project  environment  management  system 
96. 
in  the  overall  project 
management  will  be  set  up  to  support  for  EMP  implementation  and  ensure  for  safeguard 
requirement  in  loan  covenant  to  be  complied.  The  progress  of  EMP  implementation  will  be 
monitored and integrated in the project quarterly report. The semiannual environment safeguard 
monitoring report during construction will be prepared by implementing agencies and submitted 
to ADB for review and uploaded on ADB’s website.  
integrated 
2. 
COVID-19 Risk Management 
97. 
At  the time  of  processing,  the  COVID-19  pandemic  is  present.  While  Viet  Nam  had  no 
active cases the risk of COVID-19 second wave or new transmission into Viet Nam remains. The 
EARF, he IEE and EMP for the two representative subprojects have detailed the requirements of 
each  IEE  and  CEMP  to  address  the  occupational  health  and  safety  risks  that  may  arise  from 
COVID-19 during implementation. The basis of this risk management is a COVID-19 Safety and 
Health Risk Management Plan that the contractor must prepare, resource and monitor. The plan 
will detail adequate measures for mitigating COVID-19 health risk in each construction work, e.g., 
detection,  prevention,  response,  and  personal  arrangement  the  COVID-19  Health  Risk 
Management Plan will form a part of the CEMP that is required prior to works commencement.  
3. 
Staffing  
98. 
Each  province  has  committed  $300,000  (excluding  consultant  and  or  staff  costs)  as 
counterpart  funding  for  the  implementation  of  the  environmental  safeguards  identified  for  the 
representative  subprojects  and  indicative  budgets  for  the  additional  subprojects  for  the  entire 
project.  
Each  PPMU  will  have  an  environmental  safeguards  staff/focal  point  who  will  also  be 
99. 
assisted  by  an  environmental  safeguards  consultant  from  the  loan  implementation  consultant 
team. Further the DED consultants will also be required to provide environmental safeguard inputs 
to  the  design  process.  The  PPMU  environment  safeguards  staff  will  work  closely  with 
environmental safeguards consultants as part of the DED team. The environmental consultant in 
the loan implementation consultant team and construction supervision consultants support each 
PPMU  to  assess,  monitor  and  supervise  the  CEMP  implementation,  and  ensure  environment 
compliance in each subproject. Semiannual environment monitoring report, during construction 
phase,  will  be  prepared  and  submitted  by  PPMU  to  ADB  for  review  and  uploading  on  ADB’s 
website. 
53 
4. 
Involuntary Resettlement 
100.  The overall project is classified as Category B for involuntary resettlement. All subprojects 
are  required  to  be  Category  B  or  C  for  involuntary  resettlement.  The  developments  and 
improvements under the subprojects will not trigger major resettlement impacts because most of 
the infrastructure will be improved within existing right of ways. 
101.  The executing and the implementing agencies and/or PPMUs will ensure that any impacts 
on involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples are carried out in accordance with the agreed 
REMDF and REMDPs, ADB’s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), and the Vietnamese laws and 
regulations  on  involuntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples.  In  case  of  discrepancies 
between  the  government’s  laws,  regulations,  and  procedures,  and  ADB’s  Safeguards  Policy 
Statement (2009), ADB’ Safeguards Policy Statement will apply. 
102.  As agreed between the PPCs and ADB, a combined REMDF has been prepared for each 
province. Two REMDPs have been prepared for two representative subprojects (one road and 
one  water  supply)  in  BDP  during the  project  preparation.  These  REMDPs  will  be  updated  and 
approved by ADB to reflect any changes in the subproject after completion of DEDs and based 
on results of the detailed measurement survey, public consultation and replacement cost survey. 
REMDP for any additional subproject included during project implementation will be prepared by 
PPMUs  following  guidance  of  the  REMDFs  and  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  for  approval  and 
disclosing before compensation plans approval and awarding civil works contracts. The PPMUs, 
Lan  Acquisition  and  Resettlement  (LAR)  Board  at  district  level,  and/or  Center  for  Land  Fund 
Development, the wards and/or communes, and relevant mass organizations will have primary 
responsibility  for  the  updating  and  implementation  of  the  REMDPs  with  the  support  of  the 
consultant.  As such  the capacity  of these  bodies  is  of  critical  importance  and  the  project must 
ensure  appropriate  capacity  building  assistance  in  the  form  of  information,  training,  and 
consultation and mentoring. 
103.  The executing agencies and the PPMUs shall ensure that a site possession notice to a 
civil works contract to commence construction activities for a subproject is issued only when the 
PPMUs  and  their  loan  implementation  consultants  have  officially  confirmed  in  writing  that 
compensation payment and/or allowances to affected people have been completed. 
104.  The  executing  agencies  shall  provide  timely  and  sufficiently  counterpart  funds  for  land 
acquisition, resettlement and monitoring activities specified in the agreed REMDPs, and will meet 
any unforeseen obligations more than the REMDPs budget estimate to satisfy social safeguard 
objectives. 
105.  PPMUs are responsible for internal monitoring with assistance from the LIC. PMUs will 
submit semi-annual internal monitoring reports to ADB. Final monitoring and evaluation need to 
be  conducted  after  completion  of  all  land  acquisition  activities  every  6  months  to  assess  (i) 
achievement  of  land  acquisition  objectives;  (ii)  changes  in  living  standards  and  livelihoods  of 
affected  people/ethnic  minority  people;  (iii)  restoration  of  the  economic  and  social  base  of  the 
affected people; (iv) effectiveness and sustainability of entitlements; and (v) the need for further 
support as required. All reports need to be submitted to ADB timely for review and disclose on 
ADB website. External resettlement agency is not required for this project because of insignificant 
impact  on  land  acquisition  unless  there  is  a  breach  to  full  and  final  compensation  prior  to  the 
commencement of works. 
54 
5. 
Indigenous Peoples 
106.  ADB’s  Indigenous  People’s  policy requires that  under  an  ADB  loan, the  borrower/client 
will undertake meaningful consultation with affected Indigenous Peoples, herein referred to in the 
Vietnamese context as “ethnic minorities” to ensure their informed participation in (i) designing, 
implementing, and monitoring measures to avoid adverse impacts on them or, when avoidance 
is not possible, to minimize, mitigate, and compensate for such effects; and (ii) tailoring project 
benefits that accrue to them in a culturally appropriate manner. Consultation will be carried out in 
a  manner  commensurate  with  the  impacts  on  affected  communities.  The  consultation  process 
and its results are documented and reflected in the REMDPs. 
107.  The overall project is classified as Category B for ethnic minorities and all representative 
and additional subprojects must be Category B. Since in many cases ethnic minorities form the 
overwhelming  majority  of  the  population  of  road  subproject  areas  and  since  the  project  is 
designed  to  provide  positive  impacts  for  these  groups,  measures  to  mitigate  negative  impacts 
have been incorporated in the subproject REMDPs and the procedures within the REMDF that 
the PPMUs apply in the processing of additional subprojects. 
108. 
Impacts  on  ethnic  minorities  in  the  project  areas  are  overwhelmingly  positive  since  the 
subprojects will be aimed at the overall economic and social improvement of the total population. 
The  project  will  not  cause  physical  displacement  from  traditional  or  customary  lands,  nor 
negatively  impact  the  identity,  culture,  or  customary  livelihood  system  of  ethnic  minorities. 
REMDPs will ensure the inclusion of ethnic minorities and their access to project benefits. The 
REMDP  also  includes  mitigation  measures  to  address  impacts  on  ethnic  minorities,  an 
institutional  capacity  development  program,  a  grievance  redress  mechanism,  and  compliance 
with ADB information disclosure and consultation requirements. 
109. 
Internal monitoring and progress reporting for indigenous peoples will be combined with 
resettlement land acquisition implementation and will be the responsibility of the PPMUs. At the 
local level, the CISB will provide support for monitoring on a regular basis. 
6. 
Prohibited Investment Activities 
110.  Pursuant to ADB’s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), ADB funds may not be applied to 
the activities described on the ADB Prohibited Investment Activities List set forth at Appendix 5 of 
the Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). 
VIII.  GENDER AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS 
111.  The project is classified as effective gender mainstreaming (EGM) at entry. The GAP will 
support  activities  to  reduce  inequalities  between  women  and  men  associated  with  access  to 
benefits  and  opportunities  and  social  risks  such  as  exposure  to  disease  and  road  safety.  The 
design features of the GAP are (i) promotion of equality of project benefits and opportunity-sharing 
between men and women; (ii) reduction in gender inequalities and social risks such as HIV/AIDs 
transmission prevention, human trafficking prevention and road safety; (iii) capacity development 
of  women,  including  those  from  ethnic  minorities  in  technical  topics,  including,    water  and 
sanitation,  eco-tourism, environment  protection for  safe  and  sustainable tourism,  and  irrigation 
water  control  technologies;  (iv)  increased representation  of  women  in  decision-making  and  (v) 
collection of sex-disaggregated data for benefit monitoring and evaluation. 
55 
112.  A gender analysis revealed that women have fewer opportunities than men to participate 
in public decision making, and less access to information, training, and employment, whilst having 
equal or better than access to education. The road subproject in output 1 directly benefits women 
along the route in terms of reduced time to move to cropping and plantation land, and increased 
reliability  in  year-round  connectivity  with  improved  mobility  to  access  services  and  markets. 
However, women and their children are vulnerable during construction because of HIV/AIDs and 
human trafficking risks due to contractors who may bring workers from outside to work on sites. 
Women and girls are also more vulnerable to road safety given their caregiver traditional roles in 
case of accident occur to them or family members. In output 2, women and girls are substantial 
beneficiaries due to reduced time needed for accessing and collecting water, and from personal 
health benefits of having reliable potable water available 24 hours a day within their households.  
113.  The GAP sets out expected actions and priorities for the inclusion of women throughout 
the project activities and within the economic opportunities that are being created. It is required 
that  employment  linked  to  the  climate  data  systems  be  based  on  gender  equality  and  where 
necessary a gender bias (female) will be applied to develop this equality in professional roles. 
114.  The gender action plan implementation arrangement. The GAP budget is estimated 
to be $160,000 for operational costs ($80,000 for each province’s GAP) plus the input from the 
social and gender LIC consultants. It will be financed from the counterpart fund.   
115.  The two PPMUs will be responsible for the GAP implementation, monitoring and reporting 
to  ADB.  The  two  PPMUs  will  collaborate  with  the  local  Women’s  Union  at  various  levels  to 
implement GAP’s activities and targets. Each PPMU will appoint a gender focal point and recruit 
social and gender consultants to provide technical support. The PPMUs will include GAP reporting 
in quarterly progress reports to government and ADB.

B. 
Monitoring 
1. 
 Project Performance Monitoring 
116.  Project progress and performance will be based on the indicators and targets shown in 
the design and monitoring framework. Five kinds of monitoring will be carried out including: (i) 
implementation  progress  monitoring;  (ii)  safeguard  monitoring;  (iii)  benefit  monitoring  and 
evaluation; (iv) GAP monitoring; and (v) loan agreement covenant monitoring. 
Implementation progress monitoring will be one of the main tasks of each PPMU that will 
117. 
be supported by each PPMU (and LIC benefit and monitoring evaluation consultant) monitoring 
and evaluation specialist and will be based on the detailed work planning schedules (Appendix 5) 
for  the  proposed  subproject  and  project  management  work  planning  template  and  the  overall 
project  implementation  schedule.  Collectively  these  will  be  consolidated  into  a  provincial 
executing agency wide project performance management system (PPMS). 
118.  The  provincial  PPMS  will  be  managed  by  the  PPMU  who  will  maintain  it  and  report 
updated progress on a quarterly basis with each province reporting directly to the PPC, MOF and 
ADB. 
119.  The PPMS will monitor the progress of activities in the province. The subproject feasibility 
studies  will  provide  a  baseline  dataset  for  each  subproject  that  will  define  (i)  activities,  (ii)  the 
implementation timelines and milestones, (iii) outputs delivery progress, (iv) final output, and (v) 
contribution  of  each  subproject  output  to  the  outcome  indicators.  The  PPMS  will  not  directly 
assess  the  contribution  to  the  project  impact.  PPMS  monitoring  activities  will  entail  periodic 
62 
monitoring  of  the  benefits  and  impacts  of  a  representative  number  of  selected  subprojects  as 
reported in quarterly reports. This will be undertaken by each PPMU monitoring and evaluation 
staff member. 
120.  Each subproject will have a completion report prepared by the construction supervision 
consultant that will include details of (i) output completed, (ii) output still in progress, (iii) road user 
data and forecasts based on traffic counts after road completion and within 6 months of project 
completion and the conversion of this data into PCU with a comparative assessment of measured 
PCU’s and the those projected at subproject design and feasibility approval. For Water supply the 
number of connections, sale of water data will also be compared to design forecasts. The PMU 
staff  will  collate  this  into  provincial  level  reports  for  the  project  performance  data  base  and 
reporting system that can be used for post evaluation purposes. 
2. 
Compliance Monitoring 
121.  The government and executing agencies have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for 
the project, which are set forth in the loan agreement including the following: 
(i) 
(ii) 
The  government  will  ensure  that  adequate  funds  are  allocated  for  the  periodic 
maintenance  of  infrastructure  developed  under  the  project  through  provincial 
budgets to maintain the infrastructure in functional order; and 
The  government  will  ensure  that  a  grievance redress mechanism  established  in 
REMDPs  for  affected  people  in  the  participating  districts  will  be  implemented 
effectively and satisfactorily. 
122.  ADB  will  monitor  compliance  with  all  covenants  throughout  implementation  via  regular 
review  missions,  quarterly  progress  reports  submitted  by  the  PPMUs  to  ADB,  and  review  of 
project accounts and procurement procedures. 
123.  Safeguards  monitoring  with  associated  grievance  redress  mechanisms  will  be 
developed to ensure that the required policies, procedures and plans for: (i) resettlement including 
land acquisition and compensation; (ii) ethnic minority people specific actions are implemented 
and  achieve  their  expected  outcomes  during  subproject  preparation,  implementation  and 
operation; and (iii) CEMP plan implementation. 
3. 
Gender and Social Dimensions Monitoring 
124.  PPMUs  will  report  to  ADB  quarterly,  which  will  include  GAP  reporting.  Data  will  be 
disaggregated by sex and where sensible8 ethnic minorities. Routine monitoring by the Project 
will  focus  on  assessing  progress  against  GAP  targets,  identifying  constraints  and  developing 
remedial actions to effectively address these. Monitoring results will be included in at least every 
second quarterly progress reports, and assessment/evaluations of the GAP will be an essential 
element of all reviews. 
C. 
Evaluation 
125.  ADB will conduct regular (at least twice per year) reviews throughout implementation of 
the project to assess implementation performance and achievement of outcomes and objectives, 
8   Where ethnic minorities account for more than 85% of the population the need to disaggregated is significantly 
reduced. 
63 
examine financial progress, and identify issues and constraints affecting the project and work out 
time-bound action plans for their resolution. 
126.  A midterm review will also be undertaken within 22 months from loan signing. This review 
will  include  a  comprehensive  evaluation  of  project  implementation  arrangements,  detailed 
evaluation of the scope and implementation process and progress of subprojects, feedback from 
the PPMS, performance of consultants, and possible reallocation of loan proceeds. During this 
more significant review, the effectiveness of project management arrangements will be a priority 
with remedial action will be instituted as required. 
127.  Within  12  months  of  physical  completion  of  the  project,  ADB  will  conduct  a  project 
completion mission to carry out a preliminary assessment of the success of the Project to achieve 
its physical, and socio-economic developmental objectives, as well as to review compliance with 
ADB requirements and loan covenants. 
D. 
Reporting 
1. 
Provincial Work Planning and Reporting 
128.  Reporting will be directly linked to the physical implementation progress of project annual 
work  plans,  budgets  and  forecasts  of  contract  awards  and  disbursements.  Work  plan  for  the 
following year will be developed by each PPMU no later than 45 days prior to the end of the fiscal 
year  with  a  mid-year  update  -  no  later  than  30  days  after  mid-year.  The  work  plans  will  be 
developed for each individual subproject with the first annual work plan within 45 days of loan 
signing.  
129.  Draft work plans will be developed prior to loan signing to enable preparation of advance 
funds to be planned and approved. A draft structure for subproject physical planning is included 
in Appendix 5 and will be linked into the ADB (VRM project detailed implementation plan-Excel 
spreadsheet) after loan negotiations. The individual subproject work plans will be consolidated 
and linked to the budgets for ADB and government funds in separate projections. Both the work 
plan and projections will be based on a life of project approach with progress reported against 
these  and  modifications  and  adaptation  to  plans  made  as  needed  but  no  less  than  every  six 
months.  
130.  The  Project  Director  is  solely  responsible  for  ensuring  work  plans  and  forecast  are 
developed and maintained on this timeline. In addition to the subproject work plan each PPMU 
will  also  derived  a  project  procurement  and  contract  award  schedule.  The  information  for  this 
schedule will be derived from the subproject workplan schedule and will develop a procurement 
and  contract  award  reporting  worksheet  that  clearly  identifies  progress  against  plans  and 
highlights on a quarterly basis any deviation from planned schedule timelines where the deviation 
exceeds  one  month  and  formal  PPMU  statement  on  the  cause  and  management  response  to 
address the delay is required. 
131.  The  PPMU  Project  Director  will  also  ensure  that  the  overall  progress  of  the  project 
implementation  and  management  are  clearly  scheduled  including  activities  such  as  Safeguard 
monitoring  reports,  compliance  reporting,  land  acquisition  and  compensation  achievement  and 
the achievement of outputs and how these are contributing to the project design and monitoring 
framework  indicators.  As  such  this  will  require  each  PPMU  to  establish  a  PPMS  that 
disaggregates  technical,  social  and  financial  data  within  each  subproject  and  captures  (i) 
baselines data from the feasibility study surveys, (ii) data on technical, safeguards and social from 
64 
the detailed design stage, (iii) subproject outputs and the effects on the number of beneficiaries, 
the nature of impacts etc. The different outputs require significantly different data sets that will 
need  to  be  stored  and  accessible  to  the  PPMU  for  project  completion  reporting  as  well  as 
implementation  reporting.  An  indicative  table  of  contents  for  the  progress  report  is  provided  in 
Appendix 6. 
2. 
Project Level Work Planning and Reporting 
132.  Each PPMU and executing agency will be responsible for the work planning and reporting 
in their province. The reporting required will include (i) quarterly and annual reports including (a) 
progress achieved by output as measured through the indicator’s performance targets, (b) key 
implementation  issues  and  solutions,  (c)  updated  procurement  plan,  and  (d)  updated 
implementation plan for the next 12 months; and (iii) a project completion report within 6 months 
of physical completion of the project. To ensure that projects will continue to be both viable and 
sustainable, project accounts and the executing agency audited financial statement together with 
the associated auditor’s report, should be adequately reviewed. 
133.  Each PPMU will ensure that the project milestones are monitored and reported to the PPC 
and ADB as required.  
(i) 
(ii) 
PPMU  annual  implementation  and  work  plans  are  presented  by  subproject  and 
output, including (a) annual budgets in the form of financial forecasts that define 
budget and cashflow requirements by source of funding, (b) annual projection of 
contract awards, and (c) projected disbursements. 
PPMU  conducts  project  annual  reviews  to:  (a)  review  the  project  progress  and 
achievements in the past year, (b) update status of subproject preparatory work for 
submission to ADB and PPC for approvals, (c) update procurement and contracting 
status,  (d)  update  implementation  program for the  following  year  including  carry 
over uncompleted activities, revise budget and financial projections by subproject, 
financial cashflows, and (f) revise contract award and disbursement projections. 
134.  Each PPMU’s annual work plan and financial projection is provided to ADB 8 weeks prior 
to the end of each project year. It also conducts an annual planning update meeting within one 
month of the mid-year point to:  
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
Review the quarterly report,  
Identify outstanding implementation issues and challenges, 
Identify  issues  or  bottlenecks  that  need  to  be  addressed  within  or  across  the 
provinces, and 
Prepare a report for ADB. 
E. 
Stakeholder Communication Strategy 
1. 
Consultation 
135.  The project is designed to improve the welfare of rural inhabitants in two project provinces 
through a series of investments aimed to improve transport, socioeconomic wellbeing linked to 
rural domestic water supplies, irrigation rehabilitation and upgrading, and flood protection works. 
136.  Project preparation has been conducted with stakeholder agencies in the government at 
provincial and district levels including the participating provinces with Department of Planning and 
65 
Investments,  Department  of  Transport,  Department  of  Agriculture  and  Rural  Development, 
Department of Industry and Trade, and Department of Finance officials, focusing on management 
arrangements  and  issues.  Requirements  for  ensuring  appropriate  levels  of  consultation  for 
subproject preparation and implementation have been reviewed and confirmed. Representative 
subproject  preparation  included  consultation  requirements  involving  documented  evidence  of 
inclusive  consultation  with  all  communities  in  the  subproject  area  and  participant  information 
including  numbers  of  women  and  men  disaggregated  by  ethnic  minority.  Subproject  socio-
economic/gender  surveys  that  identify  vulnerable  groups  to  provide  a  basis  for  specific 
consultation and participation mechanisms will be followed during implementation. 
137.  During implementation, the process of consultation will continue throughout the process 
for preparing and approving feasibility study for additional subprojects and the follow on DEDs for 
each subproject. The consultation seeks to provide community groups the opportunity to voice 
their  views  on  how  the  subproject  is  to  be  designed,  implemented,  and  operated.  In  addition, 
associated initiatives will be built into the design of each subproject to enhance the inclusiveness 
of  the  project  activities from  the  perspective  of  social  and economic  integration  of  less  well-off 
communities. 
2. 
Participation 
It  is  anticipated  that  the  community  will  be  mobilized  in  several  different  ways  during 
138. 
subproject  design,  implementation  and  operation.  During  subproject  design  and  preparation 
stages, community participation will consist primarily of their contribution through the consultation 
process,  field  survey  ad  focus  group  discussions  and  direct  consultation.  During  construction, 
there will be significant opportunities for active participation, particularly for the poor households 
who will benefit from the subproject through opportunities to participate in paid employment for 
unskilled workers and through connectivity and increased mobility to markets and wider services 
and to access reliable safe water for domestic consumption and irrigation purposes.  
139.  These participation options will be encouraged through the bidding documents which will 
require contractors to investigate the option of local employment whenever possible. 
3. 
Awareness 
140. 
Information  about  the  project  and  the  subprojects,  including  the  objectives,  potential 
environmental  impact,  implementation  arrangements,  resettlement  and  compensation  matters, 
gender  issues,  issues  of  concerns  for  ethnic  minorities  will  be  provided  to  beneficiaries. 
Information will be provided through village meetings, pamphlets, and other announcements in 
both Vietnamese language and the language(s) of the communities whenever appropriate. The 
community will be fully informed of issues such as their right to participate in the subprojects and 
to be compensated for any loss of property including productive land and/or assets as well as 
gender equity and other relevant policies. Separate meetings and discussions will be arranged 
with  the  people  who  are  directly  affected  by  land  acquisition  and/or  resettlement  issues.  The 
community and particularly the affected households will be provided with detailed guidance and 
procedures regarding resettlement and compensation.

X.  ANTICORRUPTION POLICY 
142.  ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any violations of the 
Anticorruption Policy relating to the project.9 All contracts financed by ADB shall include provisions 
specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  executing 
agency and all project contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers. Individuals 
and/or entities on ADB’s anticorruption debarment list are ineligible to participate in ADB-financed 
activity and may not be awarded any contracts under the project. 
143.  To support these efforts, relevant provisions are included in the loan and grant agreements 
and the bidding documents for the project. All contracts financed by ADB shall include provisions 
specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of the executing, and 
implementing  agencies,  as  well  as  all  contractors,  suppliers,  consultants,  and  other  service 
providers  as  they  relate  to  the  project.  Individuals  and/or  entities  on  ADB’s  anticorruption 
debarment list are ineligible to participate in ADB- financed activity and may not be awarded any 
contracts under the project. 
144. 
The project design and implementation arrangements provide for mitigation of corruption 
risks. Risks associated with project management, including procurement and disbursement, will 
be  mitigated  by  the  engagement  of  LIC  to  advise  and  assist  in the  procurement  of  goods  and 
services, and the engagement of other consultants. The overall project will establish and operate 
a website in which it will disclose implementation progress; bid notifications and their results; and 
provide  grievance  redress  mechanism  against  any  corrupt  practice.  References  on  ADB’s 
Anticorruption Policy can be accessed through the following link: http://www.adb.org/Integrity/. 
XI.  ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISM 
145.  People  who  are,  or may  in the  future  be,  adversely  affected  by the  project  may  submit 
complaints  to  ADB’s  Accountability  Mechanism.  The  Accountability  Mechanism  provides  an 
independent forum and process whereby people adversely affected by ADB-assisted projects can 
voice,  and  seek  a  resolution  of  their  problems,  as  well  as  report  alleged  violations  of  ADB’s 
operational  policies  and  procedures.  Before  submitting  a  complaint  to  the  Accountability 
Mechanism, affected people should make an effort in good faith to solve their problems by working 
with  the  concerned  ADB  operations  department.  Only  after  doing  that,  and  if  they  are  still 
dissatisfied, should they approach the Accountability Mechanism.28.10 
XII.  RECORD OF CHANGES TO THE PROJECT ADMINISTRATION MANUAL 
146.  All revisions and/or updates during implementation should be retained in this section to 
provide a chronological history of changes to implemented arrangements recorded in the project 
administration manual, including revision to contract awards and disbursement s-curves.

TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR OUTPUT 3 CONSULTING SERVICES  
I. 
OVERVIEW 
Output 3 seeks to reduce the risks and the associated costs that are incurred by Binh 
1. 
Dinh and Quang Nam provinces due to their high levels of exposure, hazard and vulnerability to 
extreme weather events and the impact of climate change. The climate of the project provinces 
is characterized by heterogeneity within the hydrological cycle of the coastal provinces with wide 
extremes  ranging  from  drought  to  floods  over  extended  periods  of  the  year  that  result  in  the 
Central Coastal Provinces recording the highest annual mortality rates due to disasters caused 
by natural hazards. The project will invest in technology that provides increased access and a 
broader set of application tools that use climate data. This will include technology to aggregate 
and  archive  climate  data  including  integration  of  multiple  sources  and  with  downstream 
applications  such  as  early  warning  and  decision  support  systems.  The  rationale  for  output  3 
focuses on the use of existing information and knowledge to support decision making rather than 
simply increasing the density of the hydromet network.  
2. 
Viet  Nam  continues  to  transition  towards  integrated  water  resources  management 
(IWRM) systems from policy through to operation of infrastructure, allocation of water, and the 
management of water during periods of excess and scarcity.1 IWRM relies on moving from data 
capture to one of understanding data, building capacity for predictive outcomes, assessment of 
trade-offs through time and space. The success of IWRM requires informed decision making that 
is reliable, yet this is a major obstacle in Viet Nam where IWRM has struggled to gain traction due 
to (i) a perceived lack of need – there is no scarcity or excess of water, (ii) data for decision making 
is often incomplete or inaccessible denying decision makers the ability to respond to increasing 
impact of climate risk resulting in the cost of extreme events being higher than necessary, and 
(iii) the lack of capacity, skills within an appropriate institutional arrangement. Effective IWRM is 
data intensive that requires access to both quality and timely data.  
3. 
The changing availability of water requires a wider context within which water-based 
decision  making  is  undertaken.  Urbanization,  industrialization,  food  safety  and  processing,  are 
creating  new  demands  on  water  resources  both  in  terms  of  required  volumes  and  required 
qualities that often compete with each other. The changes and growth in water demand along 
with the underlying heterogeneity of the hydrological cycles increasingly necessitate more active 
management.  
Decision making relating to water resource management is a function of the underlying 
4. 
hydrological heterogeneity especially within the land-based phase of the water cycle.2 One limiting 
factor to successful IWRM is the ability to understand the dynamics of the hydrological system in 
both  the  short  and  medium/long  run  and  the  ability  to  monitor  and  model  these  changes, 
something  that  climate  change  adds  additional  complexity  to.  Without  this  monitoring,  the 
understanding  of  the  underlying  causes  of  variability  within  a  changing  hydrological  system  is 
increasingly inadequate and the risks of decisions across a range of management requirements 
has become increasingly costly.

  Appendix 1 
If IWRM is to be effective, there will need to be greater commonality in the understanding 
5. 
of choices regarding the allocation of resources and the management of water resources through 
time and space. This consensus is a prerequisite for society members to buy into an acceptable 
balance of costs and benefits amongst the competing uses. The shared understanding requires 
information and more importantly the knowledge of water availability and the hydrologic variability 
through a range of time and space constraints. 
6. 
The growing range of climate data users include urban and rural planners, infrastructure 
planners, water resource managers, operators of key hydrologically linked infrastructure including 
hydro-power  reservoir  and  run  of  river  systems,  irrigation  and  drinking  water  reservoirs,  flood 
water management infrastructure and transport infrastructure, the finance and insurance sector. 
The  need  for  increased  resilience  reflects  the  changing  scarcity  and  excess  balances  in  the 
hydrological  systems  as  well  as the  high  investment  cost  of  upgrading or maintaining  physical 
assets to ensure their resilience within the economy.  
7. 
The management and or underwriting of hydrological risk is critical for personal asset 
and enterprise investment along with the emergence of the need for the financial sector to reflect 
these risks in their on-lending to households and businesses and for the emergence of insurance 
products that seek to share this risk between investors and through time.  
The purpose of the provincial hydrological monitoring systems should reflect the need 
8. 
for  knowledge  and  information  by  all  potential  uses  and  beneficiaries  as  opposed  to  simply 
adopting a “more data capture” focus that continues to drive the sector. Both provinces have a 
hydromet network for data capture however the use of this data remains limited and as such the 
information available for decision makers is inadequate, or inaccessible, for the implementation 
and  management  of  a  IWRM  approach.  Current  hydromet  networks  are  no  longer  a  single 
institutional network but an increasingly multilayered – multiple institutions operate an often-linked 
and  in  some  cases  overlapping  set  of  networks  with  data  rarely  shared  between  network 
operators. Some networks provide little more than a data archive. The quality of the data archive 
within and across networks is highly variable reflecting past and ongoing operational capacity and 
priorities assigned to the network by investors, owners or custodians.  
Additional investment into increasing network density should respond to knowledge and 
9. 
information needs and how these will be provided rather than simply adding increased density of 
stations. Consequently, as a result of the changing complexity in institutional arrangement and in 
the  demand  for  knowledge  the  use  of  network  data  is  prioritized  and  will  increasingly  requires 
integration within and across available networks.  
10. 
The  high  priority  for  the  use  of  data  and  information  has  arisen  from  disaster  risk 
management following significant climate-related events such as floods and storms that resulted 
in the highest annual death rates, high incidence of injuries, and extensive loss of personal and 
public assets. Equally insidious is the growing risk arising from water shortages on rural water 
supplies, drought induced crop losses and deterioration of water quality during the dry season.  
The data within the existing hydromet networks can be used to inform the likelihood the 
11. 
scale and impact of flood risks, the probability of flood events, that in combination with weather 
forecasts  provides  a  critical  element  in  early  warning  systems  that  enable  people  to  protect 
themselves  and  their  assets.    Far  less  obvious  is  the  role  of  this  data  in  the  planning  and 
engineering – in selecting the location and design of structures and infrastructure where historical 
exceedance frequencies are used to increase resilience to hydrological variation. More recently 
the additional variance arising from more extreme events within climate change projections has 
Appendix 1 
77 
been integrated into the historic exceedance frequencies to ensure resilience of infrastructure for 
the economic life of the investment (ADB, 2018). Further integration of climate change projections 
is an increasing priority for both project provinces.  
Currently the networks have been used to develop models from some of the gauged and 
12. 
measured data points with the models of floods, and storm impacts tested. Most of these models 
are then used to predict impacts over a larger geographic scale. Where models have a proven 
reliability in predicting or representing extreme events these models can be applied across a wider 
landscape  where  the  meterological  records  is  linked  to  a  lower  density  data  network.  Reliable 
models enable engineering and planning decisions to incorporate increased resilience of climate 
events which in turn reduces the future operation and maintenance costs of the assets.    
The quality of model representation to the non-gauged areas is determined by the quality 
13. 
of both the model and the data being derived from the hydromet network. Most model applications 
are  limited  to  being  able  to  access  small  parts  of  the  multi-layered  and  owned  networks  that 
include differing Provincial Agencies, private sector or quasi state owned enterprises that manage 
irrigation or hydro-reservoirs, the national agencies that hold data for primary national network 
and its integration with national and regional weather and storm forecasting services.  The impact 
of constrained access is to reduce the value of the network, reduce the value of the modelling 
and increase the uncertainty of model outcomes resulting is less reliable output to inform decision 
makers.  
14. 
Any investment in network expansion has to balance the needs for increased density of 
data capture vis a vis the needs for better access to available data so that the quality of information 
and knowledge can be increased and supplied. Once the quality is increased the ability to enter 
into cost recovery management systems is far more viable which in turn simply strengthens the 
quality of both data and models using the data.  
Investment to increase the density of network data stations needs to consider user needs 
15. 
as a determinant of how additional investment is applied and where it is needed.  Given the lag 
in developing a usable and reliable data set from a new site that requires sufficient duration of 
record (usually 20 years) - a more important short-term investment is to ensure that existing data 
across the total network is available and applied within the many models that currently exist or 
that may be developed as more data access to secured.  
16. 
Data point quality is dependent on accuracy, reliability, timeliness, and the duration of 
the data point operation. The duration of record is a contributor to most of Viet Nam’s failure within 
the  existing  networks,  where  donors,  academics  and  government  have  invested  in  additional 
stations that after one or two years are abandoned, or only operated in a sporadic manner. The 
institutional arrangement is a critical factor in the duration of the recorded data and is a part of the 
determinant  of  data  quality  and  the  related  ability  to  recover  the  cost  of  data  collection  and 
management.  
17. 
Currently  both  Project  Provinces  are  supporting  a  range  of  Government,  ODA  (WB8, 
ADB Green Cities, and bilateral programs) providing additional resources for network expansion 
along  with  minor  advancement  in  modelling  and  use  of  limited  data  subsets.  The  ADB 
Development and Implementation of Flood Forecasting and Warning System for Hoi An and Vu 
Gia-Thu Bon River Basin is the improvement of the forecasting and warning services as well as 
the response capacity of the government and society to reduce the impact of meteorologically 
induced  natural  hazards  in  the  Vu  Gia-Thu  Bon  river  basin  area  of  Quang  Nam  Province 
investment  has  adopted  a  wider  response  by  adopting  an  information  needs  based  approach. 
78 
  Appendix 1 
This grant funded initiative concluded that the existing basic networks were more than sufficient 
to  support  a  very  detailed  modelling  framework  of  floods,  drought,  and  land  slide  projection 
models.  
The WMO provides guidelines for the minimum densities of stations with a network. For 
18. 
the project provinces these densities would require rainfall gauging station densities of 1 per 250 
or 2500sqkm in the mountainous districts and 1 per 5,750sq km in the hills and plains. For stream 
flow recoding the minimum densities recommended are 1 per 1,000sq km in the mountains and 
1 per 1,875 square km in the hill and plain districts. Coastal areas require even lower densities.  
Table A1.1: Minimum Network Densities – WMO 2008 
19. 
More  recently  –  Table  A1.2,  2019  modelling  recommended  standards  that  were 
elaborated for more difficult conditions however the basic density recommendations are similar to 
WMO, 2008. 
Table A1.2: Network Density recommendations 3 
Appendix 1 
79 
20.  Within the two CRIEM 1 provinces the current network density for rain gauge stations is 1 
per 156 km2 in Binh Dinh and 1 per 101 km2 in Quang Nam whilst flow gauging densities in Binh 
Dinh are 1 per 685 km2 and for Quang Nam 1 per 402 km2 – see table 3. The basic networks are 
more than adequate for meeting the minimum needs of users provided access to the full range of 
networks in each province is accessible and the quality of data is confirmed and maintained going 
forward. Within each network there maybe strategic gaps that warrant new sites however these 
should be determined by the envisaged needs of those that the data is being collected for. Here 
the  model  developers  and  model  operators  along  with  the  monitoring  of  hydrological  systems 
need to inform and prioritize such gaps.

  Appendix 1 
The CRIEM 1 investment rationale is to invest in modern technology that supports data 
21. 
access and processing that supports the needs of users rather than the continued increased in 
network density that has resulted in redundancy and declining quality of data sets.4  
1. 
Background 
II. 
BINH DINH PROVINCE 
Binh Dinh is one of the South Central Coastal provinces with the highest vulnerability and 
22. 
associated  disaster  costs  arising  from  disasters  caused  by  natural  hazards,  that  are  primarily 
flood events along the 3 major river basins being (i) Lai Giang, (ii) La Tinh, (iii) Kon-Ha Thanh.  
2. 
Existing Systems 
23. 
The data on Binh Dinh overall networks remains unclear. The number and types of stations 
reported vary. VRM recruited ADB staff consultant reported that the existing network comprised 
of the following: 
(i) 
Basic Network all owned by Viet Nam Meterology and hydrological Administration 
(VHMA) 
a.  3 Metrological weather stations – manual 
b.  7 Hydrological stations – manual  
c.  1 Oceanic station  
d.  52 rainfall gauge stations 
i.  6 old stations 
ii.  2 new stations 
iii.  45 Con River basin stations – all manual 
(ii) 
Specialized network – owned by the PPC 
a.  11 auto water level stations 
b.  44 automated rain gauges 
The TRTA has been provided a list of stations that are being installed during 2020. This 
24. 
includes: 
(i) 
Automated rain gauge stations  
a.  5 from the Community Disaster Prevention Fund of Government  
b.  25 from the World Bank 8 – Dam Safety project 
c.  7 from the Binh Dinh Hydromet Station   
Automated Water and flood level gauges 
a.  16 from World Bank 8 Dam Safety project. 
(ii) 
25. 
Assuming that the two lists are independent with no overlap the scale of the current public 
sector hydromet station network is presented in Table 4 which clearly indicates the adequacy of 
the province hydromet networks. As such the CRIEM -1 investment is targeting investment into 
data management, and information technology that reduces the cost of the network but moves to 
support access and use of data systems. 
4   This finding is consistent with the ADB 2019 TA 8171 for Hoi Anh flood forecasting where the inventory of networks, 
data points and use of such data also coincided with the Quang Nam PPC request that any increase in network 
density be supported for operation and maintenance costs which the public sector struggled to deliver.

In addition, to the data collection stations in table 1 the wider hydromet inventory for the 
26. 
province includes: 
(i) 
Hydromet flood models (all use MIKE 11 platform) for all river basins (except the 
La Tinh) including: 
a.  Kon – Ha Thanh River Basin (2017) 
b.  Kon River Basin (2019) 
c.  Lai Giang River Basin (2016) 
d.  Lai Giang River Basin Upgrade for An Du Beach project (2019-2020 –ongoing)  
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
Early Warning systems – there are currently two early warning systems that have 
been developed one is automated through SMS – both are based on water level 
status  reporting  with  no  automated  flood  model  early  warning  system.  These 
include GIZ supported systems for 4 automated water level recording stations, and 
CBLS  (with  support  of  Rockerfeller  Foundation)  for  3  automated  water  and  rain 
guage stations 
Risk and impact assessment tools linked to the hydraulic models for flooding have 
been developed for the Kon-Ha Thanh River basin 
Sea level rise model based on MIKE11 was developed post the 2015 Storm and 
Typhoon season.  
3. 
Investment Priorities  
1. 
Client Data Access Systems 
27. 
The proposed use of HLTF grant funding is to establish a modern customized technology 
based data access and information system that supports the growing diversity users for climate 
based  data  and  forecasts.  The  proposed  system  seeks  to  enhance  data  archive  to  enable 
increased development of both information and knowledge related to climate risk through enabling 
users from a range of sectors to access reliable and consistent data sets.  
82 
  Appendix 1 
The proposed investment will support the establishment of a client – server system to be 
28. 
hosted by the Quy Nhon Hydromet Station on behalf of the Provincial Peoples Committee by the 
Provincial Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control, Search and Rescue.  
The  client  server  system  will  provide  an  online  (and  possibly  cloud-based)  system  that 
29. 
archives  data  online  that  is  exchanged  or  accessed  digitally  with  clients.  Typically,  the  server 
receives, captures, stores and processes data whilst the client accesses the data to transform it 
into visual or similar layers for decision support purposes using simulations, modelling, and spatial 
GIS layers.

Clients to be connected will be identified by the Provincial Committee with a minimum of 
four clients in other agencies, in addition, the Provincial DoT and its PPMU will be established 
and supported as a client while the Provincial Joint Stock Company for rural water supply will be 
offered the option of becoming a client user. All clients will have on-line connectivity with the data 
archive and the option of accessing client information systems such as flood forecasting, flood 
impact mapping and storm events.  For the DoT and its PPMU this will include the development 
of flood risk impacts for the road networks and based on these impact assessments additional 
site-based warning systems will be provided for up to 8 sites.  In return the flow and water level 
stations  within  these  systems  will  be  required  to  connect  into  the  data  archive  and  provide 
integration with the disaster relief procedures of the province.

2. 
Indicative Hardware and Software Specifications  
31. 
All hardware and software will be finalized within a detailed design and supply agreement 
that will require the design to maximize compatibility for its integration with the hydromet networks 
and the range of early warning and decision support tools currently developed – see above. Within 
Binh Dinh (and most provinces within the coastal region) the predominant software platforms are 
linked to the DELFT related software platforms for hydraulic modelling, flood mapping etc. with 
the current models operating on MIKE11. The key design complexity is to ensure that the wide 
range of sources and data types can be managed within the Client Server interfaces. As such 
hardware specifications need to include the range of communication protocols for input data and 
protocols for external communication or transmission of data. Looking forward a core element in 
the  client  server  arrangement  is  the  requirement  of  internet  speeds  in  excess  of  50Mbps  and 
ideally 100Mbps or above.

Indicative Costings 
32. 
A total investment cost of $1 million is estimated based on the expected costs detailed in 
the Table below of which the central data hub based on the client and user server interfaces is 
estimated  at  $800,000  including  customization  of  existing  decision  support  and  forecasting 
models with the client server system and historical data population of the data archive – see Table 
6  for  equipment  bill  of  quantity  and  cost  estimate  and  table  7  for  proposed  installation  and 
customization for operators.  
Appendix 1

The  additional  $200,000  will  support  modernization  of  the  flood  warning  and  flow  level 
33. 
network based on the road network and local community high risk sites identified by DOT through 
the use of flood mapping model outputs it will access through the client interface – see table 8. IT 
is envisaged that these sites will procure locally manufactured flood warning systems that include 
water  flow,  water  level  recording  stations,  downstream  early  Warning  systems,  and  data  and 
message transmission systems. The final scope of these will be determined during the detailed 
design, and will need reflect the priorities from flood risk mapping, vulnerable communities and 
the likely installations under the World Bank 8 – Dam safety initiative.

Development  of  decision  support  models  and  their  applications  will  build  on  existing 
knowledge obtained through the Quang Nam provincial program financed under ADB TA 8171 
and especially will need consideration of the linkages and integration of the Provincial system with 
the  regional  hydromet  center  in  Tam  Ky.  The  Client  Server  and  its  integration  with  decision 
support  systems  and  early  warning  systems  will  use  a  software  supplier  technical  assistance 
contractor  whose  terms  of  reference  will  include  the  development  of  sufficient  capacity  and 
experience to be able to maintain and extend the geographic coverage of these tools as well as 
the capacity to apply the decision support tools by the targeted user groups.  
36. 
The nature of the software systems needs to reflect the existing systems, hardware and 
capacity  as  well  as  the  wider  sector  throughout  the  central  region  and  national  levels.  These 
requirements  and  directions  are  mostly  influenced  by  the  predominant  software  platforms  for 
managing  data,  early  warning  using  real  time  interface  and  supporting  decisions  support 
requirements relating to flood risks.

Procurement  will  involve  a  firm  contractor  as  per  the  eligibility  and  terms  of  reference 
37. 
appended  to  this  document.  Procurement  will  apply  Fixed  Budget  Selection  with  eligible  firms 
providing  technical  proposals  for  specified  deliverables  within  a  fixed  budget  of  $1.0  million  – 
excluding tax. 
38. 
The proposed procurement reflects the ADB Procurement Guidelines for post July 2017 
under  “Appendix  4:  Special  Considerations  for  Procurement  of  Information  Technology”  that 
indicate the importance of moving from the run based procurement systems applied to goods and 
services and more generic consulting services or where off the shelf operational systems can be 
procured to the “Procurement for Innovation” in guidance (Para A4.11 to A4.22) where a mode 
direct and partnered approach to procurement is recommended to achieve the Value for Money 
(VFM) principles required by ADB Procurement Policy.  
39. 
The hydromet sector in Viet Nam clearly demonstrates the loss of value of money through 
competitive  procurement  where  lower  priced  solutions  have  been  contracted  using  multiple 
systems that are not integrated, expand the range of operational capabilities and skills required 
beyond the available set of skills, and fail to be maintained leading to substantial redundancy of 
investment and low outcome value.  
40. 
A  key  element  in  achieving  VFM  from  High  Technology  in  the  IT  sector  is  to  focus  on 
outcome-based procedures and not compliance rule-based procurement procedures Para A4,12 
point (iv) and to ensure specified technology are consistent with the current systems whilst also 
being the most up to date option suitable for the proposed outcomes that do not deviate from the 
requirements.  
To empower the PPC and the CRIEM PPMU, the contract will be negotiated on the basis 
41. 
of the terms of reference that prioritize issues such as: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
(v) 
fit with existing infrastructure being supported by ADB TA 8171- and specifically 
the choice of proposed and agreed software upgrades, access systems which are 
to be fully compatible with the current use of MIKE based systems  
fit with the existing processes and protocols relating to the Provincial Data Archive 
and  client  Server  –  User  Server  interfaces  and  the  linked  early  warning  and 
decisions support systems  
reflect global best practice and integration options for wider application in Viet Nam  
the proposers’ share of global market for hydromet and applied hydromet software  
the  support  for  the  software  and  the  models  being  an  integral  partner  in  their 
development  and  the  capacity  of  their  technical  partner  in  Viet  Nam  with  the 
ongoing  relationships  ensuring  access  to  technical  support  and  guidance  from 
those with direct local knowledge of the systems. 
42. 
It  is  proposed  that  the  consortia  be  requested  to  develop  a  technical  proposal  with 
supporting workplan that is agreed in advance with the Client and ADB. The proposal will include 
the usual consultant budget items of fees and out of project expenses with all software, hardware, 
data and equipment purchases being identified as “provisional sums that once final specification, 
quantities and costs are known will be approved by the IA. All provision amounts identified will 
need  to  clearly  state  each  system  including  the  scope  of  modelling  in  terms  of  geographic 
boundaries, grid sizes, and the range of parameters to be modelled in either 1D or 2D systems, 
the scale and scope of risk simulation and visualization software and supporting hardware.

Implementation Arrangement  
43. 
The  Binh  Dinh  PPMU  (CRIEM)  will  be  responsible  for  implementing  output  three 
procurement  and  will  coordinate  with  Binh  Dinh  Provincial  Hydro-Meteorological  Centre  (BD 
PHC). The proposed ToR will be reviewed and agreed in principle by the (i) BD PHC, (ii) Provincial 
Committee  for  Natural  Disaster  Prevention  and  Control,  Search  and  Rescue,  and  (iii)  Water 
Resource and Flood Control Department of DARD and the PPC (EA) for final ratification. 
 Immediately on loan signing the TOR will be submitted by the IA for EA approval. An EOI 
44. 
will be called for through the ADB CMS with the responsive parties being screened against the 
eligibility criteria (see TORs) with eligible firms being short listed. There is a distinct probability 
that the number of eligible firms may be less than 3. Short listed firms will then need to provide 
the technical methodology that responds to the terms of reference and against which all eligible 
proposals will be evaluated. The technical proposal and workplan will be submitted to the IA, who 
will  in  turn  summit this  to  the  EA  and  other  stakeholders  including  the  Provincial  Procurement 
Committee for approval. Once the technical proposal is finalized and approved the consortia will 
be  requested  to  submit  direct  to  the  IA  (copied  to  ADB)  their  financial  proposal  for  contract 
negotiation. Contract award will be undertaken by the IA/ BD PPMU.

Deliverable  2:  Specifications  and  detailed  costing  for  the  development, 
operationalisation  and  capacity  development  of  a  Provincial  Climate  Data 
Hub 
The proposed investment will support the establishment of a client – server system to be 
49. 
hosted by the Quy Nhon Hydromet Station on behalf of the Provincial Peoples Committee by the 
Provincial Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control, Search and Rescue.  The client 
–  server  system  will  support  online  (possibly  cloud-  based)  system that captures  and  archives 
data with the capacity for client and user groups to digitally exchange or access.   
50. 
The  data  archive  will  include  both  observational  data  from  the  national  and  provincial 
hydromet  stations,  private  enterprise  managed  and  operated  stations  –  mostly  linked  to  hydro 
energy reservoir management, dam safety and reservoir management systems under MARD and 
observation  records  imported  from  overseas  for  events  such  as  typhoons,  ENSO  and  climate 
change. The archive will also capture and archive forecasting data systems National Rain and 
Weather stations including rain radar, Regional Provincial Rain and Weather, and Typhoon and 
Depression tracks. 
51. 
The data hub will link directly with early warning systems through real time data systems 
that  automatically  update  models  and  trigger  communication  and  warning  systems  as  well  as 
provide  interactive  links  with  decision  support  systems  for  stand-alone  planning  tools,  climate 
adjusted hydraulic modellings, reservoir management, flood risk impact modelling etc.   
Appendix 1 
95 
The data hub will be the server that receives, captures, stores and processes data whilst 
52. 
the  client  accesses  the  data  to  transform  it  into  visual  or  similar  layers  for  decision  support 
purposes using simulations, modelling, and spatial GIS layers.   
The clients to be connected will be identified during deliverable 1 and will be confirmed by 
53. 
the Provincial Peoples Committee but the minimum requirement will be 4 users in other agencies 
that include (i) the Provincial DoT, (ii) the DoT Professional Project Management Unit, and (iii) the 
Provincial Joint Stock Company for rural water supply will be offered the option of becoming a 
client user. All client-users will have on-line connectivity with the data archive and the option of 
accessing client information systems such as flood forecasting, flood impact mapping and storm 
events.   
The data hub proposal will include detailed technical specifications for hardware, software, 
54. 
and decision support systems. The proposal must demonstrate digital and associated modelling 
systems  with  seamless  integration  for  access  to  use  data.  Digital  compatibility  must  be 
demonstrated  between  field  data  collection,  imported  data  systems,  data  transmission,  data 
archive and storage and the linked use such as decision support models. For client and users, 
the contractor will identify customized needs and ensure that these are fully reflected in the IT 
design and architecture and supporting software systems.  
55.  The  data  hub  proposal  will  include  the  (i)  hardware  requirements,  (ii)  supporting 
infrastructure for hardware, (iii) software and internet/communication technologies with detailed 
specifications  for  managing  the  data  archive,  (iv)  client  user  interface  technologies  and  digital 
platforms/systems, (v) existing decision support system interfaces, and (vi) proposed interfaces 
for  flood  risk  impact  assessments.  The  proposal  will  provide  a  detailed  bill  of  quantities  with 
supporting  technical  specifications  for  all  items  to  be  procured  and  supplied  by  the  contractor 
through the use of provisional amounts within their contract as such the contractor will be required 
to specify in detail the items and expected costs of supply installation and operational support.   
56.  The  compatibility  of  proposed  hardware  and  software  with  the  main  decision  support 
models  with  a minimum of  data transformation  or manipulation  will  be  essential.  In this regard 
existing river and coastal flooding projection and mapping hydraulic models are critical tools for 
the priority climate risks faced by the Province. As such the type of software for such models will 
inform the choice of software and systems. The successful contractor will need to be a licensed 
reseller or owner of such software platforms.    
57.  The design complexity will need to address the wide range of sources and data types can 
be managed within the Client Server and user interfaces. As such hardware specifications need 
to  include  the  range  of  communication  protocols  for  input  data  and  protocols  for  external 
communication  or  transmission  of  data.  Looking  forward  a  core  element  in  the  client  server 
arrangement is the requirement of internet speeds in excess of 50Mbps and ideally 100Mbps or 
above. 
58. 
The breakout of hardware and software items and their specification for the Client server 
will be responsibility of the contractor. These will include licensing and subscription costs for the 
data hub and an operation and maintenance support service not exceeding three years.  
59. 
The proposal will include professional time to complete deliverables 1 and 2 broken out 
by position/skill set and with each position linked to a staff member with supporting biodata, level 
of input and detail of home and field time inputs.   
96 
  Appendix 1 
The contractor will be required to provide a detailed proposal for the client server to the 
60. 
CRIEM-1 PPMU for Binh Dinh within 6 weeks of mobilization. The PPMU will seek comments on 
the proposal from technical departments within the Province and any other significant stakeholder 
and present these to the contractor with 60 days. The contract will then submit a final proposal 
with a detailed implementation and staffing schedule and revised cost estimate for the Data hub 
and  client  and  user  interfaces.  Over  the  fixed  budget  deliverables  1  and  2  have  an  indicative 
budget of $780,000 to $820,000. 
3. 
Deliverable 3: Establishment of an Operational Provincial Climate Data Hub 
61. 
Based on the approved data hub proposal, the contractor will procure all hardware, supply 
software and ensure its customisation and operational capacity. The systems will be established 
with the data archive populated and linked with the range of data sources agreed. The contractor 
will ensure operational capability through the provision of training and operational mentoring of 
designated staff and ensure all software licensing and subscriptions are secured and in place. 
Once established the data hub and its operation will be handed over under the technical service 
agreed with the PPC.  
4. 
Deliverable  4:    Application  Development  for  Road  Flood  Risk  Impact 
Assessment for High Vulnerability Road Sections  
62. 
For the DoT and its PPMU the proposal will include a pilot flood risk impacts for high risk 
sections of District road networks with the impact assessments identifying the need for site based 
warning systems – the contract will support installation and training in operation for up to 6 sites 
based on available resources.  All flow and water level stations within the hydrologically linked 
systems will be required to connect into the data archive and be available for informing the risk 
assessment that will be integrated with Provincial systems for disaster relief.  
The contractor will develop and test a decision support for assessing flood impact risks 
63. 
within  the  road  transport  network  and  then  provide  site-based  flood  early  warning  systems  for 
these sections. The deliverable seeks to demonstrate to the DoT and its engineering contractors 
how  to  assess  flood  risk  impacts  on  road  sections,  options  for  road  network  planning  and 
engineering design to mitigate or manage the risks and to support small scale local early warning 
systems to reduce the cost of such floods on local communities.  The scale of input will reflect the 
residual budget available after the data hub as agreed and as such the final deliverable 4 proposal 
will be included with the revised deliverable proposal as described in paragraph 12 above.  
64. 
Deliverable 3 will support knowledge development for flood warning and flood risk decision 
support  in  the  road  and  linked  local  community  for  high  risk  sites  that  will  be  identified  in 
conjunction with DOT. The identification will use flood mapping tools that are linked to the client 
interface.  Once the flood risk impact assessment for a t least two sites is complete – future options 
for  road  network  planning,  road  network  upgrades  can  be  undertaken  by  the  DoT  and  their 
engineering teams. Whilst the risk to the transport network and associated communities will not 
be mitigated it is proposed that localized site based early warning systems be provided (these are 
available on the local market) and that these will be linked to the client server forecasting models. 
The contractor will procure locally manufactured flood warning systems that include water flow, 
water  level  recording  stations,  downstream  early  warning  systems,  and  data  and  message 
transmission systems. The final scope of these will be determined during the detailed design, and 
will need to reflect the priorities from flood risk mapping, vulnerable communities and the likely 
installations under the World Bank 8 – Dam Rehabilitation and Safety Improvement Project for 
Vietnam. 
IV. 
QUANG NAM PROVINCE 
65. 
Quang  Nam  is  one  of  the  South  Central  Coastal  Region  Provinces  and  within  the 
region the province reports the highest level vulnerability and associated disaster costs arising 
from disasters that are primarily flood events.  
Appendix 1

A. 
Existing Systems 
1. 
Regional Hydromet services 
A Regional Meteorological and Hydrological Center is stationed in Da Nang as part of the 
66. 
Vietnam Meteorological and Hydrological Administration (VMHA) network involved in forecasting. 
The organization consists of 90 staff members, of which 16 staff members under the Forecasting 
Department. The regional station provides a second tier presence of the National Administration 
and  is  linked  nationally. Currently  the most  extensive  hydro-met  surface  monitoring  network  in 
Quang Nam is owned by the Da Nang Regional Hydro-Meteorological Service Centre (RHMS) as 
a  regional  unit  of  VMHA.  This  network  consists  of  rain  gauges,  weather  stations,  river  water 
level/flow stations and one coastal water level station. Some of the roles of the center include the 
following. 
a. 
Forecasting system 
The RCHMF runs (similar to the NCHMF) its own river flood forecasting models, also based 
67. 
on NAM, MIKE 11 and reservoir routing using Excel macros. The RCHMF forecasts are on a higher 
level of detail, compared to the NCHMF models. But similar as the NCHMF, model simulations take 
rather long (order of hours), despite that the installed servers are quite moderate. 
68.  Model output parameters from the RCHMF forecasts are (similar as the NCHMF): 
(i) 
(ii) 
Water levels at key locations. 
Flood maps based on a catalogue approach (no real-time flooding maps available). 
2. 
Provincial Systems  
The  data  on  Quang  Nam  is  far  clearer  although  the  number  reported  by  the.  VRM 
69. 
Recruited ADB staff consultant seems to differ widely from the numbers reported by the ADB TA 
– 8171 team.  
The  TRTA  has  been  identified  a  list  of  stations from the  ongoing  ADB-PPTA  8171-VIE 
70. 
“Urban Environment and Climate Change Adaptation” plus an additional list from the PPMU that 
are not fully consistent. The overall indicative scale and scope of the provincial hydromet network 
is presented in table 4 that clearly indicates that at an aggregate level the network density is far 
and  above  both  the  government  and  the  WMO  guidelines.  This  is  consistent  with  the  findings 
reported for the Inception stage of ADB-TA 8171-Vie that thee hydromet data was more than 
sufficient  for  the  purposes  of  modelling  hydraulic  flows  and  events.  Note  however  this 
needs  to  include  the  catchments  and  reservoirs  systems  operated  by  hydro-electric  operating 
enterprises.  
71. 
As a consequence ADB CRIEM will not continue to add to the density of the Provincial 
Hydromet  Network,  rather  it  will  seek  to  extend  access  to  the  data  and  decision  support  tools 
98 
  Appendix 1 
whilst  also  supporting  the  use  of  updated  technology  for  modelling  2-d  aspects  of  floods, 
establishing  flood  visualisation  and  impact  assessment  technologies  that  will  provide  the  next 
generation of modelling and decision support tools for climate risk management.

The ADB TA-8171 inception report identifies a different number of rain gauge stations in 
the Province. This report identifies 20 rain gauge stations as part of the VHMA operated through 
the  regional  HMA  office  in  Da  Nang,  with  a  further  44  stations  operated  by  the  Quang  Nam 
Province, 15 by the QN Joint Stock Irrigation Company, 22 by Hydroelectric enterprises and 7 by 
Da Nang City. This list does not include the additional 20 stations to be installed under the WB 8 
– Dam Safety Project or the additional 30 that are funded but yet to be installed.   
73. 
In addition, to the stations in table 4 - the wider inventory for the province hydromet assets 
includes a number of modelling and simulation assets for floods and flows – see table 10 below, 
and wider hydromet analytics linked to a range of more specific issues.

Proposed Investment  
1. 
Rationale 
77.  With ADB TA-8171 already resourced for the development of data archive, client-server 
and user interfaces, and updated flood early warning systems as well as the strengthening of the 
hydromet data network through to a completion date of March 2021. During this period the WB 8 
-  Dam  Safety  Project  will  support  strengthening  of  the  hydro  met  network  linked  to  dam  and 
reservoir management.  
78. 
CRIEM  will  target  the  follow-on  from  the  above  ADB  TA  -  8171  investment  in  terms  of 
building systems to manage climate risk. The High-Level Technology Fund will be used to procure 
software platforms for the development of risk assessments linked to flood inundation.  
79. 
The  project  will  procure  and  develop  additional  software  modules  for  the  spatial 
visualization of risk assessment and the characterization of these risks based on the output from 
the  hydraulic  and  flood  modelling  developed  by  ADB  TA  –  8171.  The  flood  models  are  being 
developed as part of the Provincial Early Warning Systems and the associated Decision Support 
Systems (see Figure 1) that will be linked in real time to the data archive. CRIEM will add the risk 
assessment capability to broaden the use of data and to increase the value of the models to a 
wider range of applications that will increasingly reflect the risk to civil society and the risk profiles 
associated  with  the  expanding  private  sector  investment.  The  output  of  the  investment  is  to 
establish  the  technology  and  application  of  technology  and  applications  for  two  risk  impact 
assessments. These include: (i) a risk assessment of DoT managed infrastructure that will target 
vulnerable infrastructure which will also include the application and integration of climate change 
risks to transport infrastructure as reported in ADB TRTA1 and use of the TRTA findings in the 
Knowledge Product produced by ADB2. The key purpose of this risk assessment is to provide 
input  to  transport  network  upgrading  investment  planning,  detailed  design  considerations  and 
decisions,  operational  management  and  traffic  safety  considerations  for  high  flood  risk  road 
sections, and maintenance planning trade-off decision making. The outcome from this part of the 
investment is to target significant increases in road network climate resilience, and (ii) a climate 
risk assessment for high flood vulnerability and exposure area being linked to future urban growth, 
tourism and commercial development and or industrial developments.  
80. 
The Project will support the procurement of risk simulation and visualization software that 
is integrated with the decision support tools for flood modelling and early warning systems. The 
risk simulation and visualization software will derive information from the decision support tools

developed under ADB TA 8171. The contractor will work closely with the respective sector and 
environmental agencies to develop hazard data layers and the supporting spatial data sets for 
the inventory of assets and infrastructure.  
The ADB TA: 8171 flood modelling will be updated to reflect the increased complexity of 
81. 
decision support. CRIEM will seek to enhance the flood modelling through updating digital terrain 
models  onto  a  finer  grid  specification  especially  for  highly  complex  terrains,  topography  and 
surface infrastructure – such as urban and tourist commercial real estate. An key requirement for 
flood  warning  and  risk  assessments  is  the  need  to  develop  increase  certainty  and  knowledge 
about flood water flows – in terms of direction, extent, depth and velocity of water. The coupling 
of  the  1D  flood  models  with  an  enhanced  2D  modelling  capacity  is  a  natural  progression  for 
climate risk management and vastly improves the utility and value (economic and commercial) of 
the  hydromet  data  set.  Specifically,  CRIEM  will  provide  a  modern  technology  solution  for  an 
updated Digital Elevation model for two priorities that include built infrastructure and then support 
capacity  development  and  mentoring  for  the  production  of  improved  flood  mapping.  Once 
complete  the  flood  maps  would  be  an  addition  data  and  input  source  to  the  risk  assessment 
visualization and simulation models also supported by CRIEM.  
82. 
The  third  expected  output  from  the  enhanced  risk  assessment  of  DoT  and  built 
infrastructure will be the demonstration for up to 10 sites flood risk monitoring, flood advanced 
and  early  warning  systems  for  owners  of  at-risk  assets  including  public  infrastructure,  and  the 
transmission  and  integration  of  such  data  into  the  provincial  data  archive,  the  early  warning 
communication systems linked to mass media and telecommunication/mobile phone systems.  
An  essential  element  of  the  CRIEM  investment  will  be  the  integration  within  the 
83. 
Provincial  hydromet  network  and  supporting  Client  Server  systems.    As  such  the  CRIEM  will 
include as a condition that the high level technology fund ensures the DoT and its PPMU have an 
operational user interface to the Data Archive, early warning system, and decision support tools 
being installed under ADB TA 8171.   
84. 
The proposed risk assessment and visualization tools will procure the related software 
platforms that are fully compatible and wherever possible automatically connected or integrated 
with the wider hydromet data and modelling tools. Software compatibility will be a prerequisite for 
all software procured including support ARC GIS capability, risk simulation and the interactive risk 
visualization platforms. It is envisaged that the current predominance of MIKE 11 software will be 
retained and that an expanded and updated MIKE software and supporting risk software will form 
the basis of the CRIEM support. This will include the capabilities of: 
(i) 
(ii) 
MIKE  –  Flood  –  primarily  a  1  D  model  for  in  channel  flows  under  a  range  of 
meterological events, and a 2 D model for overland flow based on either single or 
flexible grid model assumptions.  
MIKE - Hydro – Rivers – linked to real time flood forecasts with data from MIKE 
hydrodynamic  model  and  the  additional  capacity  to  understand  and  model 
overland  flows  (2-D) soil  and  land type  water  infiltration,  Evapotranspiration  and 
ground water linkages.  
(iii)  MIKE –URBAN with linked ARC GIS and MIKE 21 – a 2D model 
(iv) 
The  combination  of  MIKE  Hydro  and  MIKE  URBAN  +ARCGIS  will  provide  the 
inputs for the identification of climate risk assessment along with other GIS data 
layers  including  built  infrastructure,  population  projections,  and  sea  level 
rise/climate change 
104 
  Appendix 1 
Some hardware may be required to support the simulation and visualization of risks to the 
85. 
user interfaces. 
86. 
The concurrent development of enhanced flood modelling using MIKE Hydro and MIKE 
Urban will also require a significant investment in an updated Digital Elevation Model. THE DEM 
update  will  be  financed  for  CRIEM  demonstration  and  pilot  areas  only  and  will  also  seek  to 
demonstrate the use of modern technology for establishing the DEM grid. 
2. 
Cost Estimate  
The total indicative costing is $1 million USD exclusive of taxes of $100,000 that will be 
87. 
financed by the PPC.  
3. 
Procurement  
88. 
Development  of  decision  support  models  and  their  applications  will  build  on  existing 
knowledge obtained through the Quang Nam Provincial Program financed under ADB TA 8171 
and especially will need consideration of the linkages and integration of the Provincial system with 
the regional hydromet center in Tam Ky. Specifically linkages and integration with the client server 
and  associated  decision  support  and  early  warning  systems.  The  terms  of  reference  include 
developing  sufficient  local  capacity  and  experience  to  be  able  to  maintain  and  extend  the 
geographic coverage of these tools as well as the capacity to apply the decision support tools by 
the targeted user groups.  
The nature of the software systems needs to reflect the existing systems, hardware and 
89. 
capacity  as  well  as  the  wider  sector  throughout  the  central  region  and  national  levels.  These 
requirements  and  directions  are  mostly  influenced  by  the  predominant  software  platforms  for 
managing  data,  early  warning  using  real  time  interface  and  supporting  decisions  support 
requirements relating to flood risks.  
90. 
Procurement  will  involve  a  firm  contractor  as  per  the  eligibility  and  terms  of  references 
appended  to  this  document.  Procurement  will  apply  Fixed  Budget  Selection  with  eligible  firms 
providing  technical  proposals  for  specified  deliverables  within  a  fixed  budget  of  $1.0  million  – 
excluding tax. 
91. 
The proposed procurement reflects the ADB Procurement Guidelines for post July 2017 
under  “Appendix  4:  Special  Considerations  for  Procurement  of  Information  Technology”  that 
indicate the importance of moving from the run based procurement systems applied to goods and 
services and more generic consulting services or where off the shelf operational systems can be 
procured to the “Procurement for Innovation” in guidance (Para A4.11 to A4.22) where a mode 
direct and partnered approach to procurement is recommended to achieve the Value for Money 
(VFM) principles required by ADB Procurement Policy.  
92. 
The hydromet sector in Viet Nam clearly demonstrates the loss of value of money through 
competitive  procurement  where  lower  priced  solutions  have  been  contracted  using  multiple 
systems that are not integrated, expand the range of operational capabilities and skills required 
beyond the available set of skills, and fail to be maintained leading to substantial redundancy of 
investment and low outcome value.  
93. 
A  key  element  in  achieving  VFM  from  High  Technology  in  the  IT  sector  is  to  focus  on 
outcome based procedures and not compliance rule-based procurement procedures Para A4,12

point (iv) and to ensure specified technology are consistent with the current systems whilst also 
being the most up to date option suitable for the proposed outcomes that do not deviate from the 
requirements.  
In the proposed HLTF grant procurement the existing presence in the sector and the wider 
94. 
relationship with the national and regional will minimize the exploitation of information asymmetry 
that will exist by the need to customize the tools and software into models that represent local 
flood catchments.   
To empower the PPC and the CRIEM PPMU, the contract will be negotiated on the basis

the choice of proposed and agreed software upgrades, access systems which are 
to be fully compatible with the current use of MIKE based systems,

and  client  Server  –  User  Server  interfaces  and  the  linked  early  warning  and

ongoing  relationships  ensuring  access  to  technical  support  and  guidance  from 
those with direct local knowledge of the systems. 
96. 
A service provider will be procured according to the procedures and terms of reference 
outlined  below.  The  procurement  methods  will  be  fixed-based  selection  with  eligible  bidders 
requested to develop a technical proposal with supporting workplan that is agreed with the Client 
and ADB. The proposal will include the usual consultant budget items of fees and out of project 
expenses  with  all  software,  hardware,  data  and  equipment  purchases  being  identified  as 
“provisional sums that once final specification, quantities and costs are known will be approved 
by  the  IA.  All  provision  amounts  identified  will  need  to  clearly  state  each  system  including  the 
scope of modelling in terms of geographic boundaries, grid sizes, and the range of parameters to 
be modelled in either 1D or 2D systems, the scale and scope of risk simulation and visualization 
software and supporting hardware.  
4. 
Implementation Arrangement  
97. 
The  Quang  Nam  PPMU  (CRIEM)  will  be  responsible  for  implementing  output  three 
procurement and will coordinate with Quang Nam Provincial Hydro-Meteorological Service Centre 
(QN  PHSC)  to  confirm  the  arrangements  and  to  ensure  timely  contracting  of  the  existing 
Consortia. The proposed ToR will be reviewed and agreed in principle by the (i) QN PHSC, (ii) 
Provincial Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control, Search and Rescue, Tam Ky 
who have the lead role in the Decision Support Services under ADB TA 8171, (iii) and the EA 
prior to loan signing.  
98. 
Immediately on loan signing the TOR will be submitted by the IA for EA approval. An EOI 
will be called for through the ADB CMS with the responsive parties being screened against the 
eligibility criteria (see TORs) with eligible firms being short listed. There is a distinct probability 
that the number of eligible firms may be less than 3. Short listed firms will provide the technical 
methodology that responds to the terms of reference and against which all eligible proposals will 
106 
  Appendix 1 
be evaluated. The technical proposal and workplan will be submitted to the IA, who will in turn 
summit this to the EA and other stakeholders including the Provincial Procurement Committee for 
approval. Once the technical proposal is finalized and approved the consortia will be requested 
to submit direct to the IA (copied to ADB) their financial proposal for contract negotiation. Contract 
award will be undertaken by the IA/ BD PPMU. The key milestone or performance target for the 
contract award will be in the fourth quarter 2021 to ensure continuity of work – extended delays 
beyond the second quarter of 2022 will trigger the cancelation of the HLTF grant to Quang Nam. 
V. 
TERMS OF REFERENCE – OUTPUT 3 QUANG NAM 
A. 
Background  
Quang Nam Province is currently implementing through ADB TA-8171 the development 
99. 
of data archive, client-server and user interfaces, and updated flood early warning systems as 
well as the strengthening of the hydromet data network through to a completion date of March 
2021. During this period the WB 8 - Dam Safety Project will support strengthening of the hydromet 
network linked to dam and reservoir management.  
100.  CRIEM  1  will  support  “the  next  stage”  of  climate  data  use  building  on  ADB  TA  -  8171 
investment by building systems to manage climate risk. The High-Level Technology Fund will be 
used  to  procure  software  platforms  for  the  development  of  risk  assessments  linked  to  flood 
innundation. 
101.  The project will establish operational capacity in climate risk impact assessment through 
provision  of  software  modules  for  the  spatial  visualization  of  risk  assessment  and  the 
characterization  of  these  risks  based  on  the  output  from  the  hydraulic  and  flood  modelling 
developed  by  ADB  TA  –  8171  and  establishing  operational  capacity  including  data  populated 
customization and human resource development and mentoring.  
102.  Flood models are being developed as part of the Provincial Early Warning Systems and 
the associated Decision Support Systems that are linked in real time to the Provincial data hub 
and data archive. CRIEM-1 will add the risk assessment capability to broaden the use of data and 
to increase the value of the models to a wider range of applications that will increasingly reflect 
the  risk  to  civil  society  and  the  risk  profiles  associated  with  the  expanding  private  sector 
investment.  
103.  The  purpose  of  the  investment  is  to  establish  the  technology  and  application  of  the 
technology  and  as  such  CRIEM  output  will  target  two  application  of  risk  impact  assessment. 
These  include:  (i)  a  risk  assessment  of  DoT  managed  infrastructure  that  will  target  vulnerable 
infrastructure  which  will  also  include  the  application  and  integration  of  climate  change  risks  to 
transport infrastructure as reported in ADB TRTA3 and use of the TRTA findings in the Knowledge 
Product produced by ADB4.

104.  The  key  output  of  risk  assessment  is  to  provide  input  to  transport  network  upgrading 
investment planning, detailed design considerations and decisions, operational management and 
traffic safety considerations for high flood risk road sections, and maintenance planning trade-off 
decision making. The outcome from this part of the investment is to target significant increases in 
road network climate resilience. The second focus will be on developing and completing a climate 
risk assessment for a high flood vulnerability and exposure area linked to future urban growth, 
tourism and commercial development and or industrial developments. 
105.  The  required  contracted  deliverables  are  described  below  and  the  contractors  will  be 
required to provide a detailed methodology for determination of the technical specifications, bill of 
quantities  and  installation  with  supporting  capacity  development  for  each  deliverable.  The

Contractual Deliverables  
108.  The contractor will submit a report to the PPC on priority provincial needs for the archive, 
integration  and  storage  and  provision  of  digital  access  to  potential  users  of  climate  data  and 
models. The proposal will require provincial agreement on priorities (deliverable 1) and approval 
of a detailed design and implementation contract for establishing the data hub (deliverable 2) that 
will  be  informed  by  provincial  assessment  of  current  climate  data  collection  and  management 
systems,  data  use  and  decision  support,  and  climate  risk  assessment  and  communication 
systems. Once the data hub is operational (deliverable 3), within the fixed budget of $1 million 
(net of all taxes) the residual investment will be used to pilot flood risk impact assessment decision 
support  with  associated  site  based  early  warning  technology  recently  developed  in  Viet  Nam 
(deliverable 4). A minimum of 15 percent of total investment will be applied to deliverable 4.  
109.  The Project will support the procurement of risk simulation and visualization software that 
is integrated with the decision support tools for flood modelling and early warning systems. The 
risk simulation and visualization software will derive information from the decision support tools 
developed under ADB TA 8171. Deliverable one will conduct a review of existing flood damage 
and flood information systems and consult with Provincial officials to identify priority and medium 
term  needs  for  flood  risk  management  that  will  then  be  confirmed  and  officially  ratified  by  the 
Provincial Peoples Committee (PPC). Deliverable two will use the ratified priority needs to prepare 
a  design  concept  for  the  proposed  risk  impact  assessments  that  will  define  the  hardware  and 
software  requirement,  data  linkages  and  access,  risk  assessment  tools  including  inundation 
mapping, risk visualization and characterization of site and system wide data. The proposal will 
be presented to the Quang Nam PPC for technical review, revision by the contractor and approval 
by  the  QN  PPC.  Deliverable  three  will  procure,  install,  customize  and  establish  operational 
capacity  of  the  approved  concept  design  while  Deliverable  four  will  provide  two  case  study 
applications  of  flood  risk  impact  assessment  as  capacity  building  programs  for  (i)  the  road 
transport  sector  led  by  the  Provincial  DoT,  and  (ii)  urban  and  tourism  destination  sector 
development.

Risk Impact Assessment Technology linked to the Provincial Climate Data 
Hub 
110.  The proposed investment will support the establishment of a client – server system to be 
hosted  by  the Quang  Nam  Provincial  Data  Hub with  access to  each  of the  priority  institutional 
actors  on  behalf  of  the  Provincial  Peoples  Committee  by  the  Provincial  Committee  for  Natural 
Disaster Prevention and Control, Search and Rescue.   
111.  The ADB TA: 8171 flood modelling will be further strengthened to reflect the increased 
complexity  of  decision  support.  CRIEM-1  will  seek  to  enhance  the  flood  modelling  through 
updating digital terrain models onto a finer grid specification especially for highly complex terrains, 
topography and surface infrastructure – such as urban and tourist commercial real estate. A key 
requirement for flood warning and risk assessments is the need to develop increase certainty and 
knowledge about flood water flows – in terms of direction, extent, depth and velocity of water. The 
coupling of the 1D flood models with an enhanced 2D modelling capacity is a natural progression 
for climate risk management and vastly improves the utility and value (economic and commercial) 
of  the  hydromet  data  set.  Specifically  the  contractor  will  review  the  needs  and  recommend  a 
modern  technology  solution  for  an  updated  Digital  Elevation  model  for  the  two  proposed  case 
study  priorities that  will  include  built  infrastructure  and  then  support capacity  development  and 
mentoring for the production of improved flood mapping. Once complete the flood maps would be 
an addition data layer to the risk assessment visualization and simulation models also supported 
by CRIEM.  
112.  An essential element will be the integration within the Provincial hydromet network and 
supporting Client Server systems.  As such the contractor will be required as part of the CRIEM 
loan assurance that the DoT and its PPMU have an operational user interface to the Data Archive, 
early warning system,  and decision support tools being installed under ADB TA 8171.   
113.  The proposed risk assessment and visualization tools will use software platforms that will 
be  compatible  and  wherever  possible  automatically  connected  or  integrated  with  the  wider 
hydromet data and modelling tools within the Provincial Data hub. Software compatibility will be 
a prerequisite for all software procured including support GIS capability, risk simulation and the 
interactive risk visualization platforms. It is envisaged that the current predominance of MIKE 11 
software will be retained and that an expanded to support integrated risk software. This may will 
require consideration of the different options being offered through: 
(i) 
(ii) 
MIKE  –  Flood  –  primarily  a  1  D  model  for  in  channel  flows  under  a  range  of 
meterological events, and a 2 D model for overland flow based on either single or 
flexible grid model assumptions.  
MIKE - Hydro – Rivers – linked to real time flood forecasts with data from MIKE 
hydrodynamic  model  and  the  additional  capacity  to  understand  and  model 
overland  flows  (2-D) soil  and  land type  water  infiltration,  Evapotranspiration  and 
ground water linkages.  
(iii)  MIKE – URBAN with linked ARC GIS or MIKE 21 – a 2D model 
(iv) 
The  combination  of  MIKE  Hydro  and  MIKE  URBAN  +ARCGIS  will  provide  the 
inputs for the identification of climate risk assessment along with other GIS data 
layers  including  built  infrastructure,  population  projections,  and  sea  level 
rise/climate change 
114.  Some hardware may be required to support the simulation and visualization of risks to the 
user interfaces and the contractor will identify these needs and ensure it is included in the proposal 
112 
  Appendix 1 
along  with  technical  specifications  that  will  support  the  software  proposed  for  the  foreseeable 
future. 
115.  The concurrent development of enhanced flood modelling using MIKE Hydro and MIKE 
Urban will likely require a significant investment in an updated Digital Elevation Model. As such 
updated DEM will be financed demonstration and pilot areas only and will seek to demonstrate 
the use of modern technology for improving the DEM grid and establish competence for this work 
to continue as required. As such these activities will need to be included in the proposal 
116.  The  current  development  of  the  Provincial  data  hub  will  link  directly  with  early  warning 
systems  through  real  time  data  systems  that  automatically  update  models  and  trigger 
communication  and  warning  systems  as  well  as  provide  interactive  links  with  decision  support 
systems  for  stand-alone  planning  tools,  climate  adjusted  hydraulic  modellings,  reservoir 
management, flood risk impact modelling  etc.   The  contractor  will  need  to  ensure that the  risk 
assessment tools can link to these systems in both directions and if and where beneficial become 
fully integrated. 
117.  The proposal will include the (i) hardware requirements, (ii) supporting infrastructure for 
hardware, (iii) software and internet/communication technologies with detailed specifications for 
managing  any  additional  data,  (iv)  integration  through  the  client  user  interface  systems,  (v) 
decision support system interfaces, and (vi) interfaces for producing on request site based flood 
risk impact assessments.  
118.  The  proposal  will  provide  a  detailed  bill  of  quantities  with  supporting  technical 
specifications  for  all  items  to  be  procured  and  supplied  by  the  contractor  through  the  use  of 
provisional amounts within their contract as such the contractor will be required to specify in detail 
the items and expected costs of supply installation and operational support.   
119.  The design complexity will need to address the wide range of sources and data types can 
be managed within the client server and user interfaces. As such hardware specifications need 
to  include  the  range  of  communication  protocols  for  input  data  and  protocols  for  external 
communication or transmission of data.  
120.  The breakout of hardware and software items and their specification for the Client server 
will be responsibility of the contractor. These will include licensing and subscription costs for the 
data hub and an operation and maintenance support service not exceeding three years.  
121.  The  proposal  will  include  professional  time  to  complete  all  deliverables  broken  out  by 
position/skill set and with each position linked to a staff member with supporting biodata, level of 
input and detail of home and field time inputs.   
122.  The contractor will be required to provide a detailed proposal to the CRIEM-1 PPMU for 
Quang Nam within 6 weeks of mobilization. The PPMU will seek comments on the proposal from 
technical departments within the Province and any other significant stakeholder and present these 
to  the  contractor  with  60  days.  The  contract  will  then  submit  a  final  proposal  with  a  detailed 
implementation and staffing schedule and revised cost estimate for the Data hub and client and 
user interfaces.  
Appendix 1 
113 
3. 
Deliverable 3: Establishment of an Operational Provincial Climate Data Hub 
123.  Based on the approved data hub proposal, the contractor will procure all hardware, supply 
software and ensure its customisation and operational capacity. The systems will be established 
with the historic data populated and linked with the range of data sources agreed. The contractor 
will  establish  the  updated  DEM  grids  for  the  two  proposed  demonstrations.  The  contractor  will 
also ensure operational capability through the provision of training and operational mentoring of 
designated staff and ensure all software licensing and subscriptions are secured and in place. 
Once the risk assessment software and data systems and its operation is established the systems 
will be handed over under the technical service agreed with the PPC.  
4. 
Deliverable 4:  Demonstration of Flood Risk Impact Application - Two Pilots 
for  (i)  High  Vulnerability  District  Road  Sections  and  (ii)  an  Urban  and/or 
Tourism Destination  
(i) 
Application  (1)  –  Road  Flood  Risk  Assessment  and  Early  Warning 
Systems  
124.  For  the  DoT  and  its  PPMU  the  proposal  will  include  conducting  a  flood  risk  impact 
assessment for preselected section of the district road network within the CRIEM 1 Districts that 
face high vulnerability from flood events or upstream flood waters.  The scopes of these network 
sections will be defined in consultation with the DoT, district officials and the PPMU and should 
incorporate  source  of  flood  water,  transmission  channels  including  downstream  impacted 
communities  and  the  extent  of  flood  inundation.  The  risk  impact  assessment  will  require  an 
updated DEM with the required grid specification, detailed road inventories including structures, 
drainage systems and road cross section with elevations. For each of the high priority and agreed 
sites a proposed flood risk assessment program will be detailed under Deliverable 2 to ensure 
budget adequacy and political support through the PPC.  
125.  The expected output will be a completed risk assessment with impacts on the transport 
and  associated  infrastructure  identified,  assessed  and  communicated  using  visualization, 
mapping and wider community dialogue.  A significant aspect of the impact assessment will be 
the integration of climate change projections and the inclusion of the climate change impact on 
road  networks  through  the  inclusion  of  the  climate  change  adjustment  from  extreme  event 
analysis into the flood inundation models as recommended by ADB5,6. These models will then be 
used as input for updated and project inundation and flood events using the Flood mapping and 
risk management software.  
126.  The outcome from the impact assessment will be DoT staff and local design engineers 
with the knowledge and data systems to more fully represent and respond to flood risks within the 
District  road  network  through  alignment  plans  and  adjustment,  drainage  and  structure  design, 
road elevations and through the provision of road safety through the installation of localized early 
flood warning systems that alert road users, whilst also enabling local communities to protect their 
personal and community assets. The contract will support the installation and training in operation 
for up to 10 sites based on resource availability and needs outlined in Deliverable 2.

127.  The  contractor  will  supply,  customise,  and  test  a  decision  support  for  assessing  flood 
impact risks within the road transport network and then provide site-based flood early warning 
systems for these sections. The deliverable seeks to demonstrate to the DoT and its engineering 
contractors how to assess flood risk impacts on road sections, options for road network planning 
and  engineering  design  to  mitigate  or  manage  the  risks  and to  support small  scale  local  early 
warning systems to reduce the cost of such floods on local communities.  The scale of input will 
reflect the residual budget available after the data hub as agreed and as such the final deliverable 
4 proposal will be included with the revised deliverable proposal under deliverable 2.  
128.  Deliverable 3 will support knowledge development for flood warning and flood risk decision 
support  in  the  road  and  linked  local  community  for  high  risk  sites  that  will  be  identified  in 
conjunction  with  DOT.  The  flood  risk  and  impact  tools  will  be  linked  to  the  client  and  user 
interfaces to make them more widely available to planners and design engineers.  Once the flood 
risk  impact  assessment  is  complete  –  future  options  for  road  network  planning,  road  network 
upgrades  can  be  undertaken  by  the  DoT  and  their  engineering  teams.  Whilst  the  risk  to  the 
transport network and associated communities will not be mitigated it is proposed that localized 
site based early warning systems be provided (these are available on the local market) and that 
these  will  be  linked  to  the  client  server  forecasting  models.  The  contractor  will  procure  locally 
manufactured  flood  warning  systems  that  include  water  flow,  water  level  recording  stations, 
downstream  early  warning  systems,  and  data  and  message  transmission  systems.  The  final 
scope of these will be determined during the detailed design and will need to reflect the priorities 
from flood risk mapping, vulnerable communities and the likely installations under the World Bank 
8 – Dam Rehabilitation and Safety Improvement Project for Vietnam. 
(ii) 
Application  Two:  Flood  risk  Impact  assessment  for  a  defined 
Urban/Tourism Destination Area 
129.  One site will be identified to demonstrate the application of flood risk assessment to local 
officials,  planners  and  infrastructure  design  and maintenance  teams.  The  site  will  be  identified 
within Deliverable 2 if there is sufficient budget to do so. The costly aspect of this case study is to 
establish a detailed DEM grid that can support a 2D flood model at sufficient precision for urban 
environments.  The  complexity  of  this  part  will  require  the  PMU/PPC  to  engage  with  multiple 
sectors and different administrations. Guidance for the priority should be informed by Provincial 
Socio-Economic Development priorities but should also reflect the required complexity to ensure 
an achievable output. Deliverable 2 will establish this and the ratified proposal will be the basis 
for the implementation of this part of Deliverable 4.  
130.  The outputs will include the updated DEM grid, supporting software and digital systems 
for  risk  characterization,  assessment  and  mitigation  including  mapping  visualization  and 
interactive spatial modelling. A flood risk impact report and supporting knowledge products will be 
provided along with a set of mitigation strategies that will be presented to the PPC in a forum to 
be structured by the contractor and agreed by the PPC/PPMU of CRIEM 1.  
131.  The contractor will be required to specify all equipment, software, data sets, the DEM and 
supporting field costs to undertake the flood risk assessment as part of the Output 2 Deliverable 
– Proposal budget.

PROJECT OVERVIEW 
The Climate Resilient Inclusive Infrastructure for Ethnic Minorities Project 1 (CRIEM1) is 
1. 
aligned with the following impact: inclusive socioeconomic development of Binh Dinh and Quang 
Nam  Provinces  accelerated.1  CRIEM1  will  have  the  following  outcome:  social  and  economic 
status and inclusiveness of ethnic minorities communities improved. 
2. 
Output  1:  Climate  resilient  transport  infrastructure  improved.  The  project  will  upgrade 
seven  district  and  commune  roads  totaling  about  121.8  kilometers  (km),  which  will  improve 
connectivity and mobility of EMCs within the seven districts with a total population of 206,700 of 
which  an  average  of  48%  belong  to  EMCs.  The  climate-resilient  transport  links  will  integrate 
remote rural production into market chains and processing facilities. Freight movement of acacia 
and high value crops will be improved. The effort of EMCs to dependably reach essential services 
including health, education, and markets will be reduced. The overall transport network will be 
much more efficient, reducing travel time for road users and especially improving access to health, 
education, and market services especially for women who already suffer from time poverty. 
3. 
Output  2:  Climate  resilient  water  resource  infrastructure  improved.  This  output  will 
construct, upgrade, rehabilitate, or stabilize: (i) RDWSs to provide water to approximately 18,600 
people  through  115  km of  piped  networks;  (ii)  an  existing  reservoir to  support  117  hectares  of 
irrigation command area with more reliable and efficient water supply; and (iii) cultural tourism 
infrastructure including one river defense - 3.6 km of embankment, visitor car parking and solid 
waste collection in district’s communities with a total population of 17,700 of which 94% are from 
EMCs.  Activities  under  this  output  will  benefit  about  36,300  people  and  improve  communities’ 
health by reducing the risk of water borne diseases and will particularly benefit women by reducing 
their time for water collection.

minimum  environmental  flows  based  on  the  P4  drought  year  within  the 
historical rainfall record; and 
The  capacity  of  water  supply  schemes  will  be  based  on  projected 
population  levels,  non-household  water  demand  and  non-revenue  water 
and operating margins. 
For output 3 - Climate Risk Management Data Systems, CRIEM1 prioritizes investments 
9. 
to upgrade the access and use of existing hydro-met network data since there has been a very 
high  density  of  field  data  stations  in  both  provinces.  Investment  selection  is  based  on  data 
management  systems  for  online  storage  and  access  for  both  clients  and  users,  which  are 
integrated  with  existing  early  warning  systems,  decision  support  models,  and  the  provision  of 
flood risk assessments to road network infrastructure. The only technology to be used within the 
field data network is to develop site-based flood warning systems for infrastructure and associated 
communities.  The  scope  of  investment  is  limited  to:  (i)  client  data  server  technology  and 
supporting infrastructure; (ii) user interfaces; and (iii) risk assessment technologies. Local site-
based flood and water level monitoring with linked early warning systems for no more than 8 – 10 
sites.

III. 
CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AND MONITORING GUIDELINE 
A. 
General 
11.  Works quality and contractor performance are key contributors to the success of the works 
programs under both output 1 and 2 as  the quality assurance of works construction and works 
practices will define the effectiveness of project outputs as well as the long run efficacy in terms 
of affordable operations and maintenance cost. In short, civil works built to technical standards 
that are fit for purpose are significantly easier to sustain.  
The following guideline will be applied during the implementation of construction contracts 
12. 
by the contractor and supervising personnel and will form part of the increased focus on contract 
management.  Management of the construction contracts aim to ensure the works are completed 
in  compliance  with  the  technical  specifications,  environmental  management  plans  and  social 
safeguard requirements of the CRIEM-1 investment. 
13. 
  Construction Supervision is to be undertaken by a contractor recruited using ADB CMS 
systems using QCBS with a 90:10 technical financial weighting and financed by ADB. However, 
the contractor represents the PPMU and as such accountability for construction supervision sits 
clearly with the PPMU/IA.  
14. 
The structuring of the construction supervision contract will seek to incentivise (i) presence 
at all sites, (ii) supervision outputs in terms of subproject reporting to the PPMU on progress, (iii) 
clear understanding of the CEMP requirement and how these are addressed, (iv) ensuring the 
provisions and requirements of the approved REMDP are fully applied in a timely and effective 
manner – including the requirement to ensure no works commence prior to full and final payment 
of all compensation within a subproject.  
15. 
Contract  payment  milestones  and  invoices  will  only  be  processed  if  all  reporting, 
supporting evidence and documentation is available.  Where this is not the case the contractor 
will incur substantial delays and the additional costs will be borne by the respective contactor. 
16. 
The guideline is not a technical manual as it is assumed that all parties to the contract and 
personnel  assigned  to  undertake  the  various  tasks  and  duties  during  implementation  are 
appropriately qualified and experienced for executing their responsibilities and are trained in the 
procedures and requirements of the project to be awarded the contract. 
138 
  Appendix 4 
Instances  where  an  assigned  or  contracted  personnel  does  not  have  the  requisite 
17. 
qualification or performance, experience or motivation it is the duty of their superiors to provide 
the necessary support so as they are able to undertake their tasks in compliance with the required 
standards at their own costs or request approval for their replacement.  
18.  Within the loan implementation consultants and the PPMU technical engineering staff that 
are experienced in the full range of sector works (primarily roads and water resources) will provide 
oversight and technical review of the construction works supervision and their outputs. The CS 
contractor will be required to provide full and open access to these staff or LIC personnel at any 
time that a site is open and operational.  
19. 
A  national  construction  supervision  consultant  will  provide  mentoring  and  on-time 
supervision  of  the  Provincial  construction  supervisors  work  and  performance.  Any  shortfalls  in 
inputs, quality of supervision or reporting will be raised with the Director of the PPMU. All such 
matters will be assigned to the project record and reported in both monthly and quarterly reports 
to the ADB.  
B. 
Meetings and Site Records 
All  formal  meetings  between  the  project  and  the  contractor  must  be  documented  with 
20. 
minutes prepared. Copies are to be maintained by the PPMU and by the contractor.  
21. 
All site visits and inspections must be recorded in the site register (record book) which is 
to be maintained at every site. Photographs, by mobile phone, must also be taken at all stages of 
construction especially during mandatory technical inspections and where any defective works, 
environmental or social issues are observed.         
22. 
To  facilitate  implementation  the  contactor’s representative  assigned  to  attend  meetings 
and site inspections must be authorized to make decisions on behalf of contractor on issues that 
are  brought  up  during  the  meetings  and  inspections.  Similarly,  the  assigned  site  supervisor(s) 
must  be  authorised  to  make  timely  decisions  (in  consultation  with  appropriate  persons  as 
necessary) on the day to day implementation issues.

E. 
Works supervision 
27. 
Under CRIEM - 1, the role of the construction site supervisor is paramount as they must 
not only work in close liaison with the contractor on technical aspects but also will assume overall 
responsibility for day to day monitoring of the environmental and social safeguards applicable to 
the scheme. This will involve familiarising himself / herself with the scope of works, conditions of 
contract,  technical  specifications,  environmental  management  plan  (EMP),  social  safeguards 
requirements  (LARP  /  DDR),  and  Gender  Action  Plan  (GAP)  for  the  scheme  prior  to 
commencement  of  the  works  and  then  liaising  closely  with  the  contractor  and  communities  to 
check  and  report  compliance  during  implementation.  Check  lists  for  regular  recording  of  site 
observations are attached (Annexes 2 – 4).   The construction supervisor will also need to work 
closely with the PPMU Social Safeguards focal point on a no-decline request basis.      
In addition to the assigned site supervisor who is responsible for the day to day supervision 
28. 
and quality control, the works will be inspected at least twice per month during the construction 
period  by  a  senior  engineer  /  supervisor  from  the  PPMU  who  will  provide  quality  assurance 
assessments. These checks are to ensure the day to day monitoring, reporting and follow-up of 
issues  are  being  undertaken,  technical  standards  are  being  met  (test  reports  inspected), 
environmental  and  social  safeguards  are  being  complied  with  and  appropriate  actions  and 
mitigation are being undertaken in a timely manner. In addition spot inspections, measurements 
and  audits  of  recorded  quantities  will  be  undertaken  as  will  materials  supply  and  delivery 
documents. All materials used on site must be legal and hence require traceability and proof of 
source.         
29. 
These  visits  are  to  be  a  mix  of  unannounced  and  prearranged  inspections  with  the 
inspector  being  accompanied  by the site supervisor, contractor’s representative,  village  liaison 
person (for at least the prearranged visits) and other villager representatives as necessary during 
the walkover surveys. The site record book which is to be kept at the project site at all times during 
the construction period is inspected and countersigned by the senior engineer / supervisor.  A 
quality  assurance  inspection  visit  should  be  scheduled  immediately  before  the  monthly  PPMU 
meeting.  
F. 
Monthly meeting  
30. 
The PPMU will be fully briefed on works progress with decisions on actions to address 
any outstanding issues taken at the monthly project meeting. Where matters are in dispute, both 
the project site supervisor and the contractor (or contractor’s representative) are to be given the 
opportunity to present their views. This meeting is also the forum at which changes and variation 
orders are presented and ratified. 
31. 
The items to be discussed with respect to the works contract are:  
(i) 
Time schedule 
  Progress and revision of the time schedule if necessary 
Appendix 4 
141 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
(v) 
Quality and quantity control. 
  Checks of quality and quantity test results and documents 
  Findings from spot audits 
  General observations of site management and environment   
Problems encountered  
  Reported issues and actions taken / yet to be taken 
  Other observed issues or issues raised by villagers during visit 
  Actions to be taken to resolve reported or observed issues   
Variation orders and changes during the month 
  Ratification of changes and variation orders that have been issued  
  Discussion and decisions on new or pending issues  
Payments  
  Approval  of  payment  request  documents  (The  payment  requests  to  be 
prepared  by  the  contractor  as  per  supporting  documents  confirmed  by  site 
supervisor and certified by senior inspector)  
(vi) 
Planned work activities in next month 
32. 
clear understanding by all participants.   
Use of photos to illustrate points discussed during the meeting is important to ensure 
G. 
Contract Variations 
33. 
Variation  orders  are  required  where  additions  or  deductions  to  the  works  quantities, 
changes  in  specified  materials  or  adjustments  in  technical  methods  increase  or  decrease  the 
contract sum. During the course of the construction, the site supervisor (in consultation with the 
design  engineer,  senior  supervisor  or  LIC  technical  advisor  as  appropriate)  may  instruct  the 
contractor to make any necessary variation of the quantity, quality or form of the works described 
in  the  specifications  and/or  shown  on  the  drawings  without  invalidating  the  contract.  This 
instruction will be done in writing as a Variation Order.  
34. 
Note: As per Govt regulations, Variation Orders are not permitted to exceed 15 % of the 
total  original  contract  value.    A  standard  physical  contingency  of  10%  of  original  contract  sum 
should  be  included  within  the  contract  under  the  CRIEMP  which  can  be  utilised  for  Variation 
Orders to facilitate changes to this level without the need to seeking approval for a revised budget 
which often leads to delays.      
Variations  are  most  commonly  applied  to  increase  or  decrease  of  quantities  already 
35. 
included  in  the  Bill  of  Quantity.  The  PPMU  may  approve  a  twenty  percent  (20%)  increase  or 
decrease in an item of work without entitling the contractor to claim an adjustment in item rates. 
The site supervisor must provide justification for additional work with the request certified by the 
senior  engineer  /  supervisor.  Comments  and  recommendations,  if  any,  with  respect  these 
variations must be retained in the contract file. 
36. 
For variations exceeding 20% of listed quantities or when introducing items not included 
in  the  Bill  of Quantities, the  contractor  has the right to  request  an  increase  or  decrease  in  the 
current contract unit price and to negotiate the unit price for new items, As for all variations, the 
site supervisor must provide justification for the additional works with the request certified by the 
senior  engineer  /  supervisor  and  comments  and  recommendations,  if  any,  with  respect  these 
variations must be retained in the contract file.  
142 
  Appendix 4 
A  copy  of  all  approved  variations  should  be  provided  to  the  contract  file  in  the  PPMU.  
37. 
Where there are increases in the contract sum, the revised contact sum must be updated on the 
Provincial Contract Register and advised to ADB to adjust the PCSS.  
H. 
Filing system 
38. 
A copy of the contract drawings, specifications and bills of quantities is to be kept on site 
along  with  the  site  register  (record  book)  at  all  times  for  reference  by  the  contractor  and  site 
supervisor. In addition, copies of the technical, environmental and social safeguard check lists 
are to be on site for completion during inspections. On completion of inspections, digital copies 
are to be made of the completed site forms and sent to the PPMU for review by the senior engineer 
/ supervisor before filing in the main contract file held in the project office.     
39. 
The following filing structure is recommended:  
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
Contract documents 
Letter  of  Acceptance,  Contract  Agreement,  Bank  Guarantees,  Contractor’s 
Workplan etc. 
Payment documents 
  Payment requests and payment certificates 
  Handing-over inspection forms, defects liability inspection forms 
  Letters to and from the contractor 
  Minutes of meetings 
(iv)  Materials testing results 
(v) 
(vi) 
Site records (copies of register and checklists) 
Photographs  
I. 
Works completion inspection  
40. 
The  contractor  is  to  advise  the  PPMU  in  writing  when  the  construction  works  are 
completed and the subproject is ready for commissioning. Within seven calendar days of receiving 
notice the PPMU will arrange a “contract works completion inspection” involving the contractor, 
site  supervisor  and  appropriate  technical  specialists  (i.e.  civil,  bridge,  road  engineers,  etc)  as 
necessary. Village representatives will also be invited to accompany the inspection team.  
41. 
This inspection shall involve:  
(i) 
(ii) 
Walk-over visual inspection of the works, and  
Check  of  supporting  documents  (site  register,  test  reports,  materials  verification 
statements, etc) submitted to confirm that the works fulfil the contract requirements  
Any  works  found  to  be  outstanding,  areas  where  additional  works  are  considered 
42. 
necessary and / or any defects identified are to be noted.  
If  the  PPMU  arranged  inspection  team  and  the  contractor  agree  that  the  works  are 
43. 
completed  (save  for  the  minor  pending  or  additional  works  noted),  and  there  is  no  reason  to 
prevent the infrastructure being used for the intended purpose, then the PPIT inspection team will 
recommend  that  Contract  Works  Completion  Certificate  be  issued.  The  defects  liability  period 
(normally  12  months)  will  commence  from  the  date  of  issue  of  this  Certificate.  A  list  of  the 
outstanding works which must be completed during the defects liability period is agreed with the 
Appendix 4 
143 
contractor.  During  the  defects  liability  period,  the  Contractor  also  remains  responsible  for 
maintaining the works and therefore a maintenance schedule should also be agreed.    
44. 
depending on the payment schedule agreed in the Contract.    
At this stage typically up to 80 to 90% payment of Contract Sum is made to the contractor, 
J. 
Commissioning 
During  the  defects  liability  period  and  before  final  acceptance  (and  final  payment),  the 
45. 
infrastructure must be commissioned. Commissioning tests must therefore take place for water 
resources subprojects that test delivery rates pressures and related issues. Testing during the 
wet season based on simulating wet season operation is NOT acceptable. 
46. 
The commissioning must be organised by the contractor assisted by the PPMU staff and 
the in the case of output 2 water users. The PPMU must prepare an appropriate schedule to be 
followed and advise the users in advance to participate in witnessing the event.  Testing should 
be  of  sufficient  duration  to  identify  any  infrastructure  and/or  management  issue.  Any  issues 
identified must be clearly recorded, remedial actions determined and appropriately addressed by 
the contractor (if deemed his responsibility) or by the PPMU (if deemed project responsibility). In 
either  case,  the  Final  Completion  Certificate  (and  final  payment)  can  only  be  issued  once  all 
defects are rectified and scheme commissioned.  
47. 
It is important to note that under CRIEMP-1, final acceptance and final contract payment 
is  only  made  once  the  infrastructure  is  proven  to  be  fully  functioning  with  all  water  users  can 
receive water as per the approved design.   
K. 
Final inspection 
This final inspection is carried out at the end of the defects liability period once all defects 
48. 
have been reported as rectified by the Contractor and commissioning is completed. As for the 
contract works completion inspection, within seven calendar days of receiving notice the PPMU 
will arrange a final inspection involving the contractor, site supervisor and appropriate technical 
specialists (i.e. civil, bridge, road engineers, etc) as necessary. Village representatives will also 
be invited to accompany the inspection team.  
49. 
This  inspection  will  undertake  a  walk-over  visual  inspection  of  the  rectified  works,  and 
again  check  supporting  documents  submitted  to  confirm  that  the  works  fulfil  the  contract 
requirements.  
50. 
If the PPMU inspection team and the contractor agree that the works are completed and 
in  the  case  of  the  irrigation  scheme  it  is  fully  operational,  then  the  PPMU  inspection  team  will 
recommend that Final Completion Certificate be issued. At this stage the balance contract amount 
and any retention monies will be paid and infrastructure handed over to the agency or organisation 
responsible for its ongoing O&M. 
L. 
Subproject handover 
51. 
After the Final Completion Certificate is issued, responsibility for the O&M of the irrigation 
and associated infrastructure constructed under the sub-project is formally “handed over” to the 
respective agencies or entity. At this stage a ceremony will be conducted to formalise the event.  
144 
  Appendix 4 
However, the “hand-over” process actually starts 12 months earlier once the construction 
52. 
is completed and the scheme can be operated. It continues during the commissioning phase when 
water users participate in the testing and by the end of the first year they will have observed and 
be familiar with its operation. During this year the respective receiving entity will be confirmed.  
Appendix 4
