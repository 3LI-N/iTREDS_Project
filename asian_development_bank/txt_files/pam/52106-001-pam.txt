Project Administration Manual Purpose and Process 
The  project  administration  manual  (PAM)  describes  the  essential  administrative  and 
management requirements to implement the project on time, within budget, and in accordance 
with the policies and procedures of the government and Asian Development Bank (ADB). The 
PAM should include references to all available templates and instructions either through linkages 
to relevant URLs or directly incorporated in the PAM. 
The  executing  agency,  Committee  of  Emergency  Situations  and  Civil  Defense  under  the 
Government  of  Tajikistan  (CESCD);  and  the  implementing  agency  -  project  implementation 
group (PIG) are wholly responsible for the implementation of ADB financed projects, as agreed 
jointly between the borrower and ADB, and in accordance with the policies and procedures of 
the  government  and  ADB.  ADB  staff  is  responsible  for  supporting  implementation  including 
compliance  by  the  CESCD  and  PIG  of  their  obligations  and  responsibilities  for  project 
implementation in accordance with ADB’s policies and procedures. 
At grant negotiations, the borrower and ADB shall agree to the PAM and ensure consistency 
with  the  grant  agreements.1  Such  agreement  shall  be  reflected  in  the  minutes  of  the  grant 
negotiations. In the event of any discrepancy or contradiction between the PAM and the grant 
agreement, the provisions of the grant agreement shall prevail. 
After ADB Board approval of the project's report and recommendations of the President (RRP), 
changes in implementation arrangements are subject to agreement and approval pursuant to 
relevant government and ADB administrative procedures (including the Project Administration 
Instructions) and upon such approval, they will be subsequently incorporated in the PAM. 
1 These include the loan, grant, and TA Agreements, and the Project Agreement. 
A.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
1. 
The Government of the Republic of Tajikistan has requested ADB assistance for a long 
term  and  sustainable  solution  to  effectively  manage  the  expected  increased  severity  and 
frequency of disasters triggered by natural hazards in Tajikistan. The project will (i) support efforts 
of the government in mainstreaming disaster risk management (DRM) in development planning, 
and (ii) lay a foundation for establishing a sustainable institutional and financial mechanism that 
enables Tajikistan to effectively deal with disasters in the long-term.     
B. 
Impact and Outcome 
2. 
The  impact  of  the  project  will  be  Tajikistan’s resilience to disasters  enhanced,  aligned 
with  (i)  National  Development  Strategy  2016–2030  and  Midterm  Development  Program  2016–
20202;  (ii)  ADB’s  Country  Partnership  Strategy  for  Tajikistan  2016–20203;  and  (iii)  National 
Disaster  Management  Strategy.4  The  project  will  have  following  outcome:  reduced  economic 
losses of Tajikistan due to natural hazards.    
C. 
Outputs 
3. 
Output 1: DRM mainstreamed in government institutions. The project will prepare and 
implement an institutional strengthening plan for the CESCD. The plan will clearly articulate the 
roles of various departments and divisions of the CESCD in pre- and post-disaster information 
management,  planning and implementation,  and  their relationship  with sector  and geographic, 
provincial,  and  district  agencies—preventing  overlap  or  duplication.  The  plan  will  incorporate 
capacity  building  for  gender-responsive  DRM.  The  project  will  review  the  legal  framework 
including all existing DRM-related legislation and will prepare new draft legislation to provide a 
single,  comprehensive  law  on  DRM,  if  required.  The  project  will  also  prepare  a  5-year 
business/operational  plan  (2021–2025)  for  the  CESCD  for  disaster  risk  reduction  and  post-
disaster management, including the monitoring framework and facilitation to be extended to the 
sector ministries and agencies. The project will support establishing dedicated units/focal points 
in  core  sectors  (water,  energy,  transport,  health,  education,  environment,  and  agriculture)  to 
integrate and mainstream DRM and climate change in the respective sector strategies under the 
overall guidance of the CESCD. The project will also provide training to the staff from the core 
sectors and CESCD on institutional aspects of DRM.  
Output 2: Capacity to manage natural hazards and minimize losses strengthened. 
4. 
The project will do disaster risk modeling and prepare hazard and disaster risk maps of different 
return  periods  and  a  digital  atlas,  inventory  of  assets  at  risk,  and  comprehensive  national  risk 
profile by carrying out a multi-hazard vulnerability and risk assessment leading to identification of 
areas  of  high,  medium,  low,  and  no  risk.  It  shall  carry  out  assessment  of  existing  hazard  and 
disaster modeling, mapping, exposure database/registers, and vulnerability analyses (including

from an engineering basis), followed by (i) analyses needed to fill existing gaps and their intended 
purposes;  (ii)  steps  to  engage  and  train  national  and  local  stakeholders  in  these  analyses, 
modeling, and assessments, establishing a sustainable disaster risk information system; and (iii) 
the  establishment  of  accessible,  sustainable  data  platforms,  supporting  use  of  the  data  by  all 
relevant  stakeholders  in  the  form  of  a  national  DMIS  to  be  developed  in  the  CESCD,  with  an 
appropriate data recording, transmittal, collection, analysis, and dissemination mechanism. The 
DMIS will also include gender and other social indicators such as sex, age, ability, and income 
and poverty levels. The project will establish an early warning system to enable the CESCD to 
issue timely warnings to local authorities, communities, and other stakeholders covering disasters 
such as floods, droughts, avalanches, and mudflows. IT shall prepare national, regional, district, 
and sectoral DRM plans. The plans will also outline the implementation mechanism and standard 
operating procedures, focusing on women, children, and people with disabilities. The project will 
provide DRM-related training to officials of the CESCD and key sector ministries and agencies 
responsible for social and economic infrastructure and natural resource management. It shall also 
prepare and implement a capacity building plan for community-based DRM in the districts and 
cities  at  high  risk,  with  a  focus  on  women,  children,  and  people  with  disabilities.  A  DRM 
awareness-raising program for educational institutions will also be designed and implemented in 
the districts and cities at high risk. The project will also carry out dam-break analysis and flood 
modeling of Sarez Lake to identify the areas, population, and public and private properties and 
assets at risk; estimate the magnitude of potential damages; and identify structural measures to 
address the issues identified by the analysis. Based on the analysis, upgrading and expanding of 
monitoring  and  early  warning facilities  at  Sarez Lake  and in the  areas  at  risk  will  be  done.  An 
inventory of glaciers will be prepared to identify areas at risk of glacial lake outburst flooding. 
Output  3:    Road  map  for  investments  and  sustainable  financing  developed.  The 
5. 
project  will  prepare  A  9-year  investment  plan  (2022–2030)  for  DRM.5  The  risk  modeling  work 
supported  under  output  2  will  be  used  for  risk-informed  identification  and  prioritization  of 
investments in the plan. A study will be carried out to explore sustainable financing options for 
DRR, preparedness, and response; and propose recommendations for establishing a sustainable 
financing mechanism.

FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT 
A. 
Financial Management Assessment 
The  country  public  financial  management  (PFM)  system  was  assessed  by  reviewing  a 
27. 
public expenditure and financial accountability (PEFA) assessment completed in November 2012. 
This  financial  management  assessment  (FMA)  report  has  been  conducted  in  May  2018  with 
reference to the Guidelines for the Financial Management and Analysis of Projects11, Financial 
Due Diligence: A Methodology Note12, and Financial Management Technical Guidance Note13. It 
incorporates  the  financial  management  internal  control  and  risk  management  assessment 
required  by  the  ADB’s  Guidelines  and may  need  to  be  amended  further  to  reflect  subsequent 
developments and agreements during the project implementation. This FMA preparatory activities 
included reviewing documents, interviewing staff of government agency and other stakeholders, 
and completed with inputs from other references through desk studies completed in May 2018.  
28. 
This  FMA  focus  on  accountability,  transparency  and  the  capacity  of  the  CESCD    and 
covers  (i)  financial  information  systems,  and  internal  and  external  auditing  arrangements;  (ii) 
funds-flow arrangements; (iii) staffing; (iv) accounting and financial reporting; and (v) independent 
audit.  Based  on  the  assessment,  the  key  financial  management  risks  identified  are  lack  of 
experience of EA in implementing ADB assisted projects, setting up of PIG with qualified staff and 
need for extensive training to be given to PIG on ADB’s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, 
amended from time to time)14. It is concluded that the overall pre-mitigation financial management

risk  of  the  EA  is  ‘moderate’.  The  use  of  advance  fund  and  Statement  of  Expenditures  (SOE) 
procedures are proposed, the EA has adequate capacity and power to manage advance fund and 
SOE procedures although some improvements and capacity building will be needed. The EA has 
agreed to implement an action plan as key measures to address the deficiencies. The financial 
management action plan is provided in Table 13. 
19 
Weakness 
The  EA  has  no  experience  in 
implementing  ADB 
financed 
projects. 
However,  PIG  has  not  been 
formed yet and the experience 
and skills of PIG staff needs to 
be assured. 
The EA’s Financial Accountant 
is experienced and familiar with 
the  Financial  Management 
Procedure.  However,  he  has 
not yet received any training on 
ADB  Financial  Management 
procedure  and  ADB’s  Loan 
Disbursement 
Handbook 
(2017,  as  amended  from  time 
to time).

Disbursement 
Disbursement Arrangements for ADB {and ADB-administered cofinancier} Funds 
The  grant  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  Loan  Disbursement 
29. 
Handbook and detailed arrangements agreed upon between the government and ADB. The Loan 
Disbursement Handbook describes the procedures and provides standard forms for withdrawal 
of funds. Online training for project staff on disbursement policies and procedures is available at: 
http://wpqr4.adb.org/disbursement_ e-learning. The project staffs are encouraged to avail of this 
training to help ensure efficient disbursement and fiduciary control. 
30. 
Direct payments.  Payments for goods, the project implementation consultants, and other 
payments, which either are in large amount or should be made in US dollars, will be made by 
direct payment from ADB to the contractors, upon receipt of PIG’s withdrawal application / direct 
payment  request,  along  with  necessary  supporting  documents.  Payments  for  goods  suppliers 
may be made either by direct payment from ADB. Withdrawal applications will be prepared by the 
PIG.  PIG,  assisted  by  project  implementation  consultants,  will  prepare  contract  awards  and 
disbursement projections, request budgetary allocations for counterpart funds, collect supporting 
documents, and prepare and send withdrawal applications to ADB. 
31. 
Advance  account.  The  EA  will  establish  an  advance  account  promptly  after  grant 
effectiveness at a commercial bank acceptable to ADB15. The currency of the advance account 
is the US dollar. The advance account is to be used exclusively for the ADB’s share of eligible 
15 The bank charges incurred in the operation of the advance account may be financed from the grant proceeds. 
20 
expenditures.  The  EA  and  its  PIG  who  administers  the  advance  account  is  accountable  and 
responsible  for  proper  use  of  advances  to  the  advance  account.  The  EA  through  its  PIG  will 
manage the advance account, which have a sufficient capacity to administer it.  The initial and 
additional  advances  to  the  advance  account  may  be  requested  based  on  6 months  estimated 
expenditures  to  be  financed  through  the  advance  account.  The  advance  account  will  be 
established, managed, and liquidated in accordance with ADB’s Loan Disbursement Handbook 
and  detailed  arrangements  agreed  by  the  government  and  ADB.  ADB’s  Loan  Disbursement 
Handbook describes what supporting documents should be submitted to ADB and which should 
be retained by the government for liquidation and replenishment of an advance account.  
32. 
The total outstanding advance to the advance account should not exceed the estimate of 
ADB’s  share  of  expenditures  to  be  paid  through  the  advance  account  for  the  forthcoming  6 
months. The EA may request for initial and additional advances to the advance account based on 
an Estimate of Expenditure Sheet16 setting out the estimated expenditures to be financed through 
the account for the forthcoming 6 months. Supporting documents should be submitted to ADB or 
retained by the CESCD in accordance with ADB’s Loan Disbursement Handbook when liquidating 
or replenishing the advance account.  
Statement of expenditure procedure.17  The statement of expenditure (SOE) procedure 
33. 
will be used for reimbursement of eligible expenditures or liquidation of advances to the advance 
account.18 The ceiling of the SOE procedure is the equivalent of $100,000 per individual payment. 
Supporting  documents  and  records  for  the  expenditures  claimed  under  the  SOE  should  be 
maintained and made readily available for review by ADB's disbursement and review missions, 
upon  ADB's  request  for  submission  of  supporting  documents  on  a  sampling  basis,  and  for 
independent audit. Reimbursement and liquidation of individual payments in excess of the SOE 
ceiling should be supported by full documentation when submitting the withdrawal application to 
ADB.  
Authorized signatories. Before the submission of the first withdrawal application (WA), 
34. 
the EA should submit to ADB sufficient evidence of the authority of the person(s) who will sign 
the WAs  on  behalf  of the government, together with  the  authenticated specimen  signatures  of 
each  authorized  person.  The  minimum  value  per  WA  is  stipulated  in  the  Loan  Disbursement 
Handbook.  Individual  payments  below  such  amount  should  be  paid  (i)  by  the  EA  and 
subsequently claimed to ADB through reimbursement, or (ii) through the advance fund procedure, 
unless otherwise accepted by ADB. The borrower should ensure sufficient category and contract 
balances before requesting disbursements. Use of ADB’s Client Portal for Disbursements (CPD)19 
system is encouraged for submission of WAs to ADB. For direct payments, the contractors and 
consultants will submit their invoices or interim payment certificates as appropriate to EA who will 
process  them  and  send  with  the  required  withdrawal  applications  to  ADB.  The  EA  will  be 
responsible for (i) preparing disbursement projections, (ii) collecting supporting documents, and 
(iii) preparing and sending WAs to ADB.   
16  Estimate  of  expenditure  sheet  is  available  in  Appendix  8A  of  ADB’s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2017,  as 
amended from time to time). 
17 SOE forms are available in Appendix 7B and 7D of ADB’s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from 
time to time). 
18 The EA has adequate capacity and suitable to manage SOE procedure. 
19 The CPD facilitates online submission of WA to ADB, resulting in faster disbursement. The forms to be completed 
by the Borrower are available online at https://www.adb.org/documents/client-portal-disbursements-guide.    
21 
Following to ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) (SPS),20 ADB funds may not be 
35. 
applied  to the  activities described  on the  ADB  Prohibited  Investment  Activities List  set forth at 
Appendix 5 of the SPS. All financial institutions will ensure that their investments  are following 
applicable  national  laws  and  regulations  and  will  apply  the  prohibited  investment  activities  list 
(Appendix 5) to subprojects financed by ADB. 
36. 
No withdrawal shall be made from the grant account until an appropriate legislation has 
been  passed  to  provide  exemption  from  taxes  and  duties  on  project  expenditures  or  the 
government has made budgetary allocation to the EA for the costs of such taxes and duties.  
C. 
Accounting 
The EA through PIG will maintain separate books and records by funding source for all 
37. 
expenditures  incurred  on  the  project.  The  EA  will  prepare  consolidated  project  financial 
statements  in  accordance  with  the  government’s  accounting  laws  and  regulations  which  are 
consistent with international accounting principles and practices. 
D. 
 Auditing and Public Disclosure 
38. 
The EA through PIG will cause the detailed consolidated project financial statements to 
be  audited  in  accordance  with  International  Standards  on  Auditing  and  with  the  government's 
audit  regulations,  by  an  independent  auditor  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  audited  project  financial 
statements will be submitted in the English language to ADB within six months of the end of the 
fiscal year by the PIG. 
39. 
The annual audit report for the project accounts will include an audit management letter 
and audit opinions which cover (i) whether the project financial statements present a true and fair 
view or are presented fairly, in all material respects, in accordance with the applicable financial 
reporting framework; (ii) whether loan and grant proceeds were used only for the purposes of the 
project  or  not;  (iii)  the  level  of  compliance  for  each  financial  covenant  contained  in  the  legal 
agreements  for  the  project;  (iv)  use  of  the  advance  fund  procedure;  and  (v)  the  use  of  the 
statement of expenditure procedure certifying to the eligibility of those expenditures claimed under 
SOE procedures, and proper use of the SOE and advance procedures in accordance with ADB’s 
Loan Disbursement Handbook and the project documents.  
40. 
Compliance with financial reporting and auditing requirements will be monitored by review 
missions and during normal program supervision, and followed up regularly with all concerned, 
including the external auditor.   
41. 
The EA and its PIG have been made aware of ADB’s approach to delayed submission, 
and  the  requirements  for  satisfactory  and  acceptable  quality  of  the  audited  project  financial 
statements.21 ADB reserves the right to require a change in the auditor (in a manner consistent 
20 Available at: http://www.adb.org/documents/safeguard-policy-statement?ref=site/safeguards/main. 
21 ADB approach and procedures regarding delayed submission of audited project financial statements:   
• When audited project financial statements are not received by the due date, ADB will write to the executing agency 
advising that (i) the audit documents are overdue; and (ii) if they are not received within the next six months, requests 
for  new  contract  awards  and disbursement  such  as  new  replenishment  of  advance  accounts, processing  of  new 
reimbursement, and issuance of new commitment letters will not be processed.  
•  When  audited  project  financial  statements  have  not  been  received  within  6  months  after  the  due  date,  ADB  will 
withhold processing of requests for new contract awards and disbursement such as new replenishment of advance 
accounts,  processing  of  new  reimbursement,  and  issuance  of  new  commitment  letters.  ADB  will  (i)  inform  the 
22 
with the constitution of the borrower), or for additional support to be provided to the auditor, if the 
audits required are not conducted in a manner satisfactory to ADB, or if the audits are substantially 
delayed. ADB reserves the right to verify the project's financial accounts to confirm that the share 
of ADB’s financing is used in accordance with ADB’s policies and procedures. 
42. 
Public  disclosure  of  the  project  financial  statements,  including  the  audit  report  on  the 
project financial statements, will be guided by ADB’s Public Communications Policy (2011)22. After 
review, ADB will disclose the project financial statements for the project and the opinion of the 
auditors on the financial statements within 30 days of the date of their receipt by posting them on 
ADB’s website. The audit management letter will not be disclosed. 
VI. 
PROCUREMENT AND CONSULTING SERVICES 
A. 
Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing 
All advance contracting will be undertaken in conformity with ADB’s Procurement Policy 
43. 
and Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers: Goods, Works, Nonconsulting and Consulting 
Services (2017, amended from time to time)23. The issuance of invitations to bid under advance 
contracting will be subject to ADB approval. The borrower, EA and PIG have been advised that 
approval of advance contracting does not commit ADB to finance the project. Advance contracting 
actions will be completed before approval of the project for recruitment of PIC services to mobilize 
them immediately after the grant is declared effective, to avoid start up implementation delays. 
The government has been advised that (i) approval of advance contracting does not commit ADB 
to finance the project; and (ii) the issuance of invitations to bid under advance contracting will be 
subject to ADB approval. 
44.  Retroactive financing. Will not be used. 
 The  consulting  services  will  be  required  for  carrying  out  required  assessments  and 
45. 
studies, and support implementation of the activities to deliver the designed outputs. The project 
implementation consultants (PIC) will also support in financial management, implementation of 
gender  action  plan,  procurement  of  goods/equipment  and  machinery,  and  monitoring  of  the 
project.   
B. 
Procurement of Goods, Works, and Consulting Services 
All procurement of goods will be undertaken in accordance with ADBs Procurement Policy 
46. 
and Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers: Goods, Works, Nonconsulting and Consulting 
Services. 
 Open  competitive  bidding  (OCB)  procurement  method  will  apply  to (i)  goods  contracts 
47. 
valued  at  least  $2.0  million  with  international  advertisements;  (ii)  goods  contracts  valued  from 
$100,001  and  $1,999,999  with  national  advertisements  (Box  1  below);  and  (iii)  services  ─  the

23 
single-stage, one-envelope bidding procedure. Requests for quotations will be sought for goods 
and services valued up to $100,000. The bidding documents will be prepared for all procurement 
packages and request for proposals (RFPs) for the two consultancy packages. 
All consultants and nongovernment organizations (NGOs) will be recruited according to 
48. 
Procurement  Policy  and  Procurement  Regulations  for  ADB  Borrowers:  Goods,  Works, 
Nonconsulting  and  Consulting  Services.  The  terms  of  reference  for  all  consulting  services  are

The PIG will be directly responsible for procuring goods and services. The PIG will recruit 
the  construction  supervision  consultants  through  quality-and  cost-based  selection  method 
(90:10). 
50. 
ADB  and  the  government  reviewed  the  public  procurement  laws  of  the  government  to 
ensure consistency with the ADB’s Procurement Policy and Procurement Regulations for ADB’s 
Borrowers: Goods, Works, Nonconsulting and Consulting Services. The additional requirements 
for OCB with national advertisement are described in Box 1.

3.  Registration and Sanctioning. Registration is acceptable under the following conditions: 
(i)  Bidding shall not be restricted to pre-registered firms under the national registration system, and 
such registrations shall not be a condition for the submission of bids in the bidding process. 
(ii)  National sanction lists or blacklists may be applied only with prior approval of ADB. 
4.  Prequalification.  Prequalification  is  discouraged  for  OCB-National.  When  used,  particularly  for 
goods contracts, an individual prequalification exercise is acceptable for each contract as is the use of 
a registration system (or approved standing list) of contractors based  on criteria such as experience, 
financial  capacity,  and  technical  capacity.  Foreign  bidders  from  eligible  countries  must,  however,  be 
allowed to register and to bid without unreasonable cost or additional requirements. 
5.  Advertising.  The  posting  of  OCB-National  specific  notices  for  contracts  valued  at  less  than  $1 
million on ADBs website is not required but is highly recommended. 
6.  Preferences.  The  following  shall  be  observed:  (i)  No  preference  of  any  kind  shall  be  given  to 
domestic bidders or for domestically manufactured goods; and (ii) foreign suppliers and contractors from 
ADB member countries shall be allowed to bid, without registration, licensing, and other government 
authorizations,  leaving  compliance  with  these  requirements  for  after  award  and  before  signing  of

of Tajikistan shall be eligible to participate only if they can establish that they are legally and financially 
24 
autonomous, operate under commercial law, and are not a dependent agency of the procuring entity, 
or the EA or PIG. 
8.  Rejection of Bids and Rebidding. Bids shall not be subjected to a test for unrealistic rates. No 
lowest evaluated and substantially responsive bid shall be rejected on the basis of comparison to rates, 
including but not limited to market, historical, or agency established rates, without prior approval of ADB. 
9.  Bids shall not be rejected, and new bids solicited without the ADB’s prior concurrence. 
10. Price Negotiations. Price negotiation shall be allowed only where the price offered by the lowest 
evaluated and substantially responsive bidder substantially exceeds costs estimates. Approval of ADB 
is required prior to any negotiation of prices. 
C.  Bidding Documents 
11. Acceptable  Bidding  Documents.  Procuring  entities  shall  use  standard  bidding  documents 
acceptable to ADB for the Procurement of Goods, Works and Consulting Services, based ideally on the 
standard bidding documents issued by ADB. 
12. Bid Security. Where required, bid security shall be  in the form of a certified cheque, a letter of 
credit or a bank guarantee from a reputable bank. 
13. ADB Policy Clauses. A provision shall be included in all OCB-National works and goods contracts 
financed by ADB requiring suppliers and contractors to permit ADB to inspect their accounts and records 
and other documents relating to the bid submission and the performance of the contract, and to have 
them audited by auditors appointed by ADB. 
14. A provision shall be included in all bidding documents for OCB-National works and goods contracts 
financed  by  ADB  stating  that  the  Borrower  shall  reject  a  proposal  for  award  if  it  determines  that  the 
bidder  recommended  for  award  has,  directly  or  through  an  agent,  engaged  in  corrupt,  fraudulent, 
collusive, coercive or obstructive practices in competing for the contract in question. 
15. A provision shall be included in all bidding documents for OCB-National works and goods contracts 
financed by ADB stating that ADB will declare a firm or individual ineligible, either indefinitely or for a 
stated period, to be awarded a contract financed by ADB, if it at any time determines that the firm or 
individual  has,  directly  or  through  an  agent,  engaged  in  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  coercive  or 
obstructive practices or any integrity violation in competing for, or in executing, ADB-financed contract. 
C. 
Procurement Plan 
51. 
An 18-month procurement plan indicating thresholds and review procedures, goods and 
consulting service contract packages is in Table 14, which will be updated with the approval of 
EA/PIG, in agreement with ADB, as part of the annual planning process or as required during the 
implementation.  The  procurement  plan  also  includes  (i)  goods  contracts  for  equipment  and

SAFEGUARDS 
Social. The project is classified as category C under ADB’s Safeguard Policy Statement 
56. 
(2009, as amended to date) for indigenous peoples and involuntary resettlement as no civil works 
or  economic  displacements  (no  indigenous  peoples  living  in  the  project  area)  are  envisaged. 
Therefore,  no  negative social  impacts  on  involuntary  resettlement  and indigenous  peoples are 
expected.  
57. 
Environmental aspect.  The project remains as category C for environmental impacts as 
no adverse impacts and environmental risks are anticipated due to absence of civil works under 
the project.  
58. 
Poverty  and  Social:  The  outputs  of  the  project  include  early  warning  system,  so  will 
strengthen  disaster  resilience  across  Tajikistan,  particularly  in  high  risk  areas  and  among 
vulnerable  population.  The  mainstreaming  work  on  DRM  and  related  strategies  will  include 
components targeting poor and vulnerable people in disaster prone areas. The project will benefit 
all segments of the society.  
59. 
 Prohibited  investment  activities.  Pursuant  to  ADB’s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement 
(2009),  ADB  funds  may  not  be  applied  to  the  activities  described  on  the  ADB  Prohibited 
Investment Activities List set forth at Appendix 5 of the Safeguard Policy Statement (2009).  
VIII. 
 GENDER AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS 
60. 
The project is categorized as “effective gender mainstreaming”. The key gender impacts 
of the project will include: (i)  institutionalizing women’s participation in the institutional plan and 
29 
business plan for the CESCD as well as sectoral strategies; (ii) developing gender-inclusive DMIS 
that includes gender and other social indicators; (iii) integration of  social factor as sex, age, ability, 
and income/poverty level into hazard maps and inventory of assets at risk, national risk profile, 
multi-hazard vulnerability and risk assessments; (iv) increasing the awareness of girls on disaster 
risk  management;  (v)  capacity-building  of  female  staff  of  the  CESCD  and  other  sector 
departments and ministries/agencies on risk-informed development training. The gender action 
plan (GAP) of the project is in Table 16. The cost for implementing the GAP is incorporated in the 
cost allocation for each output. The PIG will monitor and report GAP implementation with support 
of a gender consultants.

(i)  re-establish  the  working  relationships  among  ADB,  EA  and  PIG;  (ii)  reconfirm  the  project 
implementation schedule, and contract awards and disbursement projections; and (iii) finalize the 
detailed disbursement arrangements, particularly with regards to the PIG’s advance account.  
68. 
 Review missions.  ADB will field semi-annual review missions to check overall project 
implementation,  including  the  progress  against  the  project  outcome  and  outputs,  covenant 
compliance,  safeguards,  gender  and  social  dimensions,  and  utilization  of  both  ADB  and 
counterpart funds. The project implementation schedule will also be updated as necessary.  
 Midterm review mission. ADB will field a midterm review mission within three years after 
69. 
grant effectiveness to primarily assess whether the project outcome is still likely to be achieved, 
as well as the contract awards and disbursement projections. 
Project completion review mission. ADB, with the borrower, EA, PIC and PIG, will field 
70. 
a  project  completion  review  mission  to  primarily  evaluate  whether  the  project  outcome  was 
achieved, and assess the performance of ADB, borrower, EA, PIG, PIC and suppliers. The PIG 
will submit its project completion report to ADB within six months of project completion. ADB will 
also prepare and disclose its own project completion report. 
D.

ANTICORRUPTION POLICY 
74. 
ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any violations of the 
Anticorruption  Policy  relating  to  the  project.26  All  contracts  financed  by  ADB  shall  include 
provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the 
executing agency and all project contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers. 
Individuals and/or entities on ADB’s anticorruption debarment list are ineligible to participate in 
ADB-financed activity and may not be awarded any contracts under the project.27  
75. 
To support these efforts, relevant provisions are included in the loan agreement, project 
agreement and the bidding documents for the project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB 
in  connection  with  the  project  will  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and 
examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  executing  agency  and  all  contractors,  suppliers, 
consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the project. 
XI. 
ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISM 
76. 
People who  are,  or may  in the future  be,  adversely  affected  by the  project  may  submit 
complaints  to  ADB’s  Accountability  Mechanism.  The  Accountability  Mechanism  provides  an 
independent forum and process whereby people adversely affected by ADB-assisted projects can 
voice,  and  seek  a  resolution  of  their  problems,  as  well  as  report  alleged  violations  of  ADB’s 
operational  policies  and  procedures.  Before  submitting  a  complaint  to  the  Accountability 
Mechanism, affected people should make an effort in good faith to solve their problems by working 
with  the  concerned  ADB  operations  department.    Only  after  doing  that,  and  if  they  are  still 
dissatisfied, should they approach the Accountability Mechanism.28

A. 
BACKGROUND 
The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  is  providing  support  to  the  Government  of  the 
Republic of Tajikistan for a long term and sustainable solution to effectively manage the expected 
increased severity and frequency of disasters caused by natural hazards in Tajikistan. 
The project will enhance the institutional capacity of ministries and line agencies for coping 
with  natural  hazards,  such  as  earthquakes,  landslides,  mud  flows,  avalanches,  floods  and 
droughts to minimize the loss to human, property, and social and economic infrastructure. The 
project will carry out multi-hazard vulnerability and risk assessment across the country; prepare 
hazard maps; identify areas of high risk; prepare national, regional, and sector wise DRM plans; 
strengthen  the  CESCD  and  other  ministries/agencies  through  provision  of  capacity  building 
measures, trainings, and equipment.  
B.  OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE OF THE PROJECT 
The project’s outcome and impact are aligned with ADB’s programs for Tajikistan and the 
government’s  development  strategy  and  its  strategic  objectives.  The  project  impact  will  be 
Tajikistan’s resilience to disasters enhanced, and the outcome will be reduced socio-economic 
vulnerability of Tajikistan to natural hazards.   
The project has been designed to: (i) support efforts of the government in mainstreaming 
disaster  risk  management  (DRM)  in  development  planning,  and  (ii)  lay  a  foundation  for 
establishing  a  sustainable  institutional  and  financial  mechanism  that  enables  Tajikistan  to 
effectively deal with disasters in the long-term. The project has three interrelated outputs:         (i) 
DRM  mainstreamed  in  government  institutions;  (ii)  strengthened  capacity  to  manage  natural 
hazards  and  minimize  losses;  and  (iii)  road  map  for  investments  and  sustainable  financing 
developed.  The  outputs  will  be  implemented  at  the  national  level  with  specific  interventions 
covering Sarez lake and communities downstream. More information on the project is available 
at URL. 
II. 
DETAILED TERMS OF REFERENCE 
The  aim  of  this  assignment  is  to  support  the  first  output  of  the  project  to  mainstream 
disaster  risk  management  in  government  institutions  that  includes  the  following  key  activities: 
Institutional strengthening plan for CESCD will be prepared and implemented. The plan will have 
clearly articulated role of various departments and divisions of CESCD in pre and post disaster 
Appendix 1          40 
information management, planning and implementation, and their relationship with sectoral and 
geographic,  provincial  and  district  agencies,  ensuring there is  no  overlap  and duplication.  The 
plan  will  incorporate  capacity  building  for  gender-responsive  DRM.  A  review  of  the  legal 
framework  including  all  existing  DRM-related  legislation  will  be  undertaken  and  new  draft 
legislation providing a single, comprehensive law on disaster risk management will be prepared, 
if required. A 5-year business/operational plan (2021–2025) for the CESCD for  pre-disaster risk 
management  and  post-disaster  risk  management  will  be  prepared,  including  the  monitoring 
framework  and  facilitation  to  be  extended  to  the  sectoral  ministries/institutions.  Dedicated 
units/focal points in core sectors (water, energy, transport, health, education,  environment and 
agriculture)  will  be  established  to  integrate  and  mainstream  DRM  and  climate  change  in  the 
respective sector strategies under overall guidance of CESCD.  
In this context, the executing agency of the project, the Committee of Emergency Situation 
and Civil Defence (CESCD) intends to hire services of a consultancy firm or joint ventures for a 
period  of  30  months  to  undertake  the  assignment  in  Tajikistan  on  three  levels,  i.e.,  national, 
regional and district level. The assignment is expected to achieve the following sub-outputs; 
i.  Carry out a national, provincial/regional and district level diagnosis of how DRM and 
climate change is institutionally anchored in country system, to identify broad gaps 
in  the  institutional  arrangement  required  for  effective  pre  and  post-disaster  risk 
management. This includes review and consultations to undertake the institutional 
analysis of the CESCD and based on this clearly articulate the optimal role of the 
CESCD  in  pre  and  post  disaster  information  management,  planning  and 
implementation. This should include clearly defining optimal mandate and role of 
the CESCD including all its departments and divisions in pre and post- disaster risk 
management  and  their  relationship  with  sectoral  and  geographic  (provincial  and 
district)  entities  in  pre  and  post  disaster  situations.  Based  on  this  develop  a 
restructuring proposal and a proposal to enhance capacity of the CESCD and its 
regional and district level committees in Tajikistan in line with the restructuring.  The 
proposal for capacity development will include training in line with their proposed 
roles in the restructuring plans and revised roles and related processes (including 
revision of planning, approval, monitoring and reporting process), including support 
for revising and improving these processes; 
ii. 
In-depth  review  of  the  legal  framework  underpinning  DRM  and  to  identify  and 
propose changes in the legal frameworks and decrees of the government according 
to the revised mandate and role of the CESCD and related restructuring proposal, 
if required; 
iii.  Develop strategic 5-year business plan of DRM for the CESCD for its restructured 
departments and divisions for pre- risk reduction (including preparedness) and ex-
post  disaster  response  and  planning,  including  the  related  monitoring  framework 
and the facilitation that the CESCD will extend to the sectoral departments; 
iv.  Review the current role of sector departments in DRM and develop a proposal for 
institutionally-anchoring  DRM  and  climate  change  in  the  sectoral  ministries  by 
defining sectoral department’s optimal roles in pre- and post DRM and related to 
Appendix 1          41 
this develop a proposal to establish dedicated nodes (focal points) in all core sectors 
(water, energy, transport, health, education, forestry and agricultures) impacted by 
disasters  and  climate  change  along  with  staff  capacities  and  resource 
requirements; 
v.  Develop a proposal for strengthening and capacity building of sectoral nodes (focal 
points) and their respective departments for DRM mainstreaming.  The proposal for 
capacity  development  will  include  training  in  line  with  their  proposed  roles  in the 
restructuring plans and revised roles and related processes (including revision of 
planning,  approval,  monitoring  and  reporting  process).  The  consultants  will  also 
facilitate  and  guide  the  implementation  of  the  sector  strengthening  proposal 
(capacity  building)  and  related  revisions  in  the  policy,  strategies,  systems  and 
procedures of the respective sectors. 
vi. 
The consultants will also organize international and in-country trainings for staff of 
CESCD and focals of relevant ministeries on technical aspects of DRM with support 
of Package-2 consultants. Budget for trainings is provided in provisional sums.

TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR PACKAGE 2: STRENGTHENING CAPACITY TO 
MANAGE NATURAL HAZARDS AND MINIMIZE LOSSES 
I. 
INTRODUCTION 
These  Terms  of  Reference  (TOR)  provide  specific  details  of  the  project  which  are 
relevant to the assignment, implementation arrangements, and objectives of the consultancy. 
The TOR also provides specific details on the scope of the consultancy and the composition, 
roles and responsibilities of the consulting team. 
A. 
BACKGROUND 
ADB is providing an assistance to the Government of Tajikistan in the generation and 
application of risk information, including a national disaster management information system; 
an integrated multi-hazard early warning system; and training of officials from the CESCD, 
and key sector ministries/institutions responsible for social and economic infrastructure and 
natural  resource  management.  Community-based  DRM  and  awareness  raising  through 
educational institutions will also be supported under the project.  
B. 
OBJECTIVE  
The project’s outcome and impact are aligned with ADB’s programs for Tajikistan and 
the Government’s development strategy and its strategic objectives.29 The project impact will 
29  One  of  the  stated  objectives  of  the  National  Disaster  Risk  Management  Strategy  (2010  –  2015)  is  the 
“integration of disaster risk reduction into all development activities of the Republic of Tajikistan.” This national 
strategy  also  clearly articulates  the  need  and  priority  for  pre-disaster  risk  reduction  and preparedness,  also 
articulating what needs to be done but not explicitly how or with what resources. 
Appendix 1          52 
be  Tajikistan’s  resilience  to  disasters  enhanced,  and  the  outcome  will  be  reduced  socio-
economic vulnerability of Tajikistan to natural hazards.   
The  project  has  been  designed  to:  (i)  support  efforts  of  the  government  in 
mainstreaming  disaster  risk  management  (DRM)  in  development  planning,  and  (ii)  lay  a 
foundation for establishing a sustainable institutional and financial mechanism that enables 
Tajikistan to effectively deal with disasters in the long-term. The project has three interrelated 
outputs:  (i)  DRM  mainstreamed  in  government  institutions;  (ii)  strengthened  capacity  to 
manage  natural  hazards  and  minimize  losses;  and  (iii)  road  map  for  investments  and 
sustainable financing developed. The outputs will be implemented at the national level with 
specific interventions covering Sarez lake and communities downstream. More information 
on the project is available at URL. 
The primary objective of the services to be provided by an international firm(s) are to 
strengthen  the  capacity  of  CESCD  and  selected  entities  to  manage  natural  hazards  and 
minimize losses. 
II.  DETAILED TERMS OF REFERENCE AND SCOPE OF WORK 
The international firm(s) will be responsible for implementing outputs 2 and 3 of the 
project, outlined below: 
i.  Output  2:  Strengthened  capacity  to  manage  natural  hazards  and  minimize 
losses.  Hazard and disaster risk maps of different return periods and digital ATLAS, 
inventory of assets at risk, and a comprehensive national risk profile will be prepared 
by carrying out multi-hazard vulnerability and risk assessment and using probabilistic 
disaster  modelling  approach.  Areas  of  high,  medium,  low,  and  no  risk  will  be 
identified.  An  assessment  of  existing  hazard  and  disaster  modelling,  mapping, 
from  an 
exposure  database/registers  and  vulnerability  analyses  (including 
engineering basis) will be done, followed by (i) analyses needed to fill existing gaps 
and  their  intended  purposes;  (ii)  steps  to  engage  and  train  national  and  local 
stakeholders in these analyses/modelling/assessments, leaving behind a sustainable 
disaster risk information system; and (iii) the establishment of accessible, sustainable 
data platforms, supporting use of the data by all relevant stakeholders in the form of 
national  disaster  management  information  system  (DMIS)  that  will  be  developed 
within CESCD  with appropriate data recording, transmittal, collection, analysis and 
dissemination mechanism. DMIS will also include gender and other social indicators 
such as sex, age, ability, and income/poverty levels. An early warning system will be 
established  to  enable  CESCD  to  issue  timely  warnings  to  the  local  authorities, 
communities and other stakeholders covering preferably all kind of disasters such as 
floods, droughts, avalanches, mudflows and earthquakes. National, regional, district, 
and sectoral DRM plans will be prepared. The plans will also outline implementation 
mechanism  and  standard  operating  procedures,  specifically  focusing  on  women, 
children and people with special needs. DRM related training will be provided to the 
officials of CESCD and key sector ministries/institutions that are responsible for social 
and economic infrastructure and natural resource management. A capacity building 
plan for community-based DRM will be prepared and implemented in the districts and 
cities  at  high  risk,  with  specific  focus  on  women,  children  and  people  with  special 
needs.  A  DRM  awareness  raising  program  for  educational  institutions  will  also  be 
designed and implemented in the districts and cities at high risk. Dam-break analysis 
and flood modeling of Sarez lake will be done to identify the areas, population, and 
Appendix 1          53 
public and private properties/assets at risk, estimate magnitude of potential damages, 
and  identify  structural  measures  to  address  the  issues  identified  by  the  analysis. 
Based  on  the  analysis,  upgrading  and  expanding  of  monitoring  and  early  warning 
facilities at Sarez lake and in the areas at risk will be done. An inventory of glaciers 
will be prepared to identify areas at risk of glacial lakes outburst flooding. 
ii.  Output 3: Roadmap for investments and sustainable financing developed.   
An investment plan for 9-year (2022 – 2030) for DRM will be prepared.30 It shall also 
carry  out  a  study  for  sustainable  financing  options  for  disaster  risk  reduction, 
preparedness  and  response;  and  propose  recommendations  for  establishing  a 
sustainable financing mechanism. 
The work should begin with an assessment of existing hazard and disaster modelling, 
mapping,  exposure  database/register  and  vulnerability  analyses  (including  from  an 
engineering bases) and to then develop and implement a masterplan focusing on (i) analyses 
needed to fill existing gaps and their intended purposes; (ii) steps to engage and train national 
and  local  stakeholders  in  these  analyses/modeling/assessments,  leaving  behind  a 
sustainable  disaster  risk  information  system;  and  (iii)  the  establishment  of  accessible, 
sustainable data [platforms, supporting use of data by all relevant stakeholders. The scope 
is arranged in the following four sets of activities: 
i. 
ii. 
iii. 
iv. 
Set  1  –  risk  information:  a  comprehensive  national  risk  profile  comprising  multi-
hazard vulnerability and risk assessments and hazard maps, identifying areas of high, 
medium and low risk; a national disaster management information system; national, 
regional and sector-based disaster response plans; inventory of assets at risk; and 
inventory of glaciers and areas at risk of glacial lakes outburst flooding.  
Set 2 – early warning: an integrated multi-hazard early warning system; dam break 
analysis  of  Sarez  lake  with  flood  modeling  and  updated/expanded  early  warning 
system. 
Set  3  –  training  and  awareness  raising:  a  community-based  DRM  program 
designed and implemented for selected districts/cities at high risk; training for officials 
from the CESCD and selected sectors, based on a training need assessment; and 
awareness  raising  through  educational  institutions  in  selected  districts  and  cities. 
Building  up  of 
for  disaster  risk 
assessment/modelling to enable national entities to sustain and update the work. 
local  capacity  (technical  and 
institutional) 
Set 4 – investment plan: an investment plan for 9 years (2022-2030) prioritizing the 
nature  of  interventions  and  investments  in  various  sectors,  geographic  locations, 
resources required, and implementation strategies; a study on financing options for 
disaster  risk  reduction,  preparedness  and  response;  and  recommendations  for 
establishing a financing mechanism.  
To implement the above-mentioned activities, the international firm(s) will: 
30 Investment plan period is aligned with the ending year of the national disaster management strategy 2018-
2030. 
Appendix 1          54 
i. 
Set  1:  develop  a  comprehensive  national  risk  profile  by  assessing  existing 
(climate/hazard)  risk  information;  standardizing  risk  information  visualization;  and 
designing  a  set  of  core  products  to  support  risk-informed  decision  making  in  both 
development planning and disaster planning. The scope of the profile will include: 
The methodology used will include hazard profiling and mapping, characterizing the 
hazards  in  terms  of  its  spatial  distribution,  frequency  and  intensity  by  using  probabilistic 
disaster modelling approach. Seven major hazards prevalent in Tajikistan, namely, floods, 
earthquakes,  droughts,  landslides,  avalanches,  hailstorms,  and  glacial  lake  outburst  flood 
(GLOF) will be covered. Specific hazard intensity maps are to be produced per hazard. The 
hazard maps will identify the hazard-prone areas, describe the physical characteristics of the 
hazards and characterize the hazards in terms of: 
-  Description 
-  Severity (intensity) 
-  Magnitude (potential size of impact area) 
-  Probability/frequency of occurrence 
-  Hazard zone (location/extent of impact area) 
The proposed mapping parameters are: scale 1:100,000 or 1: 200,000; return period 
classes: low, medium, high (5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 250, 500, 1,000, 2,500, 5,000 years); and 
hazard intensity classification (to be determined).  
Plausible scenarios for each hazard will be prepared, considering the intensity of the 
hazardous event,  the  vulnerability  of  elements  at  risk  to  that  event  intensity,  and the time 
frame of risk  assessment.  Accurate  estimations of  potentially  at-risk  populations  and sub-
populations will be undertaken as part of the exposure analysis (quantification of risk) in a 
GIS environment, and vulnerability assessments based on the targeted elements at risk and 
context. A vulnerability Index will also be set.  
An 
integrated  national  disaster  management 
that 
systematically  collects,  manages,  analyzes  and  disseminates  disaster  information  will  be 
designed, based on an assessment of users’ needs and requirements for hazard and risk 
information  system 
Appendix 1          55 
information,  including  a  review  of  existing  data  and  information  available  across  relevant 
entities. The system will include hazard event data (magnitude, intensity, chain of events); 
damage,  loss,  impact  data  (by  location,  event,  sector  and  element);  exposure  data 
(population, infrastructure, economic); and thematic data (poverty, gender, etc.). The system 
will have the capacity to support modeling and dynamic risk analysis and mapping. 
National,  regional  and  sector-based  disaster  risk  management  plans  will  be 
developed based on the requirements of relevant users and availability of data. The planning 
methodology  will  align  to  the  existing  planning  processes  at  national,  regional  and  sector 
levels in Tajikistan. The plans will not be standalone, but rather integrated within the existing 
planning and budgeting architecture.  
An  inventory  of  glaciers  will  be  undertaken  following  a  desk  review  of  existing 
contributions in this field. The dynamic inventory parameters will include geographic location, 
area, length, orientation, elevation, and classification. The imagery, maps and datasets will 
be included in the disaster management information system. Consider use of ICIMOD glacier 
lake database and methodology, which includes part of Amu Darya river basin. 
An inventory of the assets at risk will be prepared based on the nature, severity and 
spatial  distribution  of  hazards  across  the  country.  The  consultants  will  develop  the 
methodology and scope of the inventory and seek approval of that from the CESCD. The 
sustainability of the inventory will be considered.  
ii. 
Set 2: design an integrated multi-hazard early warning system based on a thorough 
review  of  existing  early  warning  systems  and  approaches,  and  the  policy  and 
institutional  context.  Previous  initiatives  no  longer  operational,  if  any,  and  good 
practices, gaps, challenges and lessons will be assessed. An analysis of operational, 
financial,  and  capacity  limitations  and  gaps  at  administrative  (national  and  sub-
national) and community levels is to be undertaken and will include an assessment 
of potential limitations in the utilization and maintenance of core technologies. The 
system will identify opportunities to build on existing investments, domestically and 
regionally.  The  development  of  an  integrated  early  warning  system  will  include 
identifying the focus hazard(s), early warning of products, broad overview of disaster 
monitoring  mechanisms  and  warning  dissemination  mechanisms,  key  government 
and other partners and their roles, funding requirements, and measures to address 
potential technical and institutional challenges to its development and operation will 
be  outlined,  with  linkages  to  the  national  risk  profile  and  disaster  management 
information  system.  The  system  will  identify  immediate,  medium  and  long-term 
actions needed and will be linked to the investment plan (set 4), where appropriate.  
A dam break analysis of Sarez lake with revised flood modeling and updated early 
warning system will be undertaken. The 2005 World Bank supported assessment will be the 
baseline of this work. Three-dimensional dam-break and river flow simulation models will be 
used for evaluation of safety of population and assets from Sarez dam break. All possible 
seismic and climatic scenarios will be tested to optimize the needed early warning system. 
Digital  and  hard  copies  of  flood-plain  maps  (1:50,000  scale)  will  be  prepared  for  various 
scenarios and return periods. For each scenario/return period inventory of the assets and 
population will be prepared. Subsequently, upgradation/extension of lake monitoring system 
Appendix 1          56 
and  early  warning  system  will  be  designed  by  identifying  the  equioments/instruments  and 
their  specifications.  Cost  estimates  will  be  done  and  bidding  document  will  be  prepared. 
Client will be supported in procurement of the supply and installation contract. 
iii. 
Set  3:  design  and  implement  a  community-based  DRM  (CBDRM)  program  for 
selected districts/cities at high risk, and develop training and awareness materials, 
based on the comprehensive national risk profile and drawing on the risk information 
emanating  from  the  disaster  management  information  system,  in  consultation  with 
non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Training and awareness materials will be 
developed for selected localities (high risk district and cities) to support CBDRM and 
educational  institutions  and  implemented  in  a  phased  manner.  CBDRM  and 
awareness raising in educational institutions will be outsourced to NGO(s). Selected 
consulting firm(s) will recruit NGO(s) for CBDRM and awareness raising campaign in 
educational  institutions  in  high  risk  districts  and  cities  in  accordance  with  ADB’s 
Procurement  Policy  and  Procurement  Regulations  for  ADB  Borrowers:  Goods, 
Works, Nonconsulting and Consulting Services (2017, amended from time to time), 
budget for that is in Provisional Sums. Training of staff from CESCD and other sector 
ministries/agencies will be also be conducted to transfer the expertise related to the 
work  carried  out  by  consultants.  Training  will  cover  disaster  risk  in  the  context  of 
Tajikistan,  risk-informed  planning  and  budgeting,  disaster  management  and 
emergency planning, use of DMIS and early warning system, and related topics etc.      
iv. 
Set 4: design a detailed 9-year investment plan (2022-2030) with the government to 
identify  priority  interventions  and  investments  across  key  sectors  and  geographic 
locations in relation to DRM and resilience building. The plan will include indicative 
costings and be supported by a corresponding implementation strategy. The plan will 
draw  on  a  study  to  be  undertaken  on  financing  options,  in  consultation  with 
government  and  development  partners.  Recommendations  on  a 
financing 
mechanism will also be prepared.  
Throughout the delivery of these activities, the international firm(s) will: 
i. 
Ensure close synergy with similar ongoing initiatives of the government (e.g. various 
GIS-related  initiatives  in  different  government  agencies)  and  other  development 
partners, such as the World Bank (e.g. Strengthening Critical Infrastructure against 
Natural Hazards and Central Asia Hydrometeorology Modernization projects); UNDP 
(Strengthening  Disaster  Risk  Reduction  &  Response  Capacities  project);  France, 
Germany, Japan, Russia and Switzerland. 
ii.
