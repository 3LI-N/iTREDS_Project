Project Administration Manual Purpose and Process 
1.  The  project  administration  manual  (PAM)  describes  the  essential  administrative  and 
management requirements to implement the project on time, within budget, and in accordance 
with  the  policies  and  procedures  of  the  Government  of  Mongolia  (the  government)  and  the 
Asian Development Bank (ADB). The PAM should include references to all available templates 
and instructions either through linkages to relevant URLs or directly incorporated in the PAM. 
2.  The Ministry of Environment and Tourism (MET), as the executing agency; MET’s Department 
of  Protected  Area  Management  (for  the  Khuvsgul  subproject)  and  Department  of  Tourism 
Policy  Coordination  (for  the  Khentii  subproject)  as  the  implementing  agencies;  and,  the 
Ministry  of  Finance,  are  wholly  responsible  for  the  implementation  of  the  project,  as  agreed 
jointly between the loan recipient and ADB, and in accordance with the government and ADB’s 
policies  and  procedures.  ADB  staff  is  responsible  to  support  implementation  including 
compliance  by  MET,  Department  of  Protected  Area  Management,  Department  of  Tourism 
Policy Coordination, and Ministry of Finance of their obligations and responsibilities for project 
implementation in accordance with ADB’s policies and procedures. 
At  loan  negotiations,  the  borrower  and  ADB  shall  agree  to  the  PAM  and  ensure  consistency 
with  the  two  loan  agreements  for  the  project  (one  each  respectively  for  the  regular  loan  and 
concessional loan). Such agreement shall be reflected in the minutes of the loan negotiations. 
In the event of any discrepancy or contradiction between the PAM and the loan agreements, 
the provisions of the loan agreements shall prevail. 
3.  After ADB Board approval of the project’s report and recommendations of the President (RRP), 
changes in implementation arrangements are subject to agreement and approval pursuant to 
the  government  and  ADB  administrative  procedures  (including  the  project  administration 
instructions) and upon such approval they will be subsequently incorporated in the PAM.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
1. 
The  project  will  help  transform  two  national  parks  in  Khuvsgul  and  Khentii  aimags 
(provinces) as models for economically inclusive tourism and conservation in the protected area 
network,  by  improving  park  infrastructure,  sanitation,  and  capacity  to  manage  tourism  growth 
sustainably.1 About 11,009 residents are expected to benefit from the project outputs, which are 
designed  to  achieve  tourism-related  income  for  communities,  protection  of  natural  capital,  and 
climate-resilient facilities; and which scale up from previous grant projects in each park. 
A. 
Rationale 
2. 
Tourism is the largest and fastest growing sector of the global economy. Ecotourism, a major 
subsector,2 comprises up to 20% of global tourism and is a major contributor to rural income and the 
financing  of  protected  areas  in  many  countries.3 Mongolia  has  a  small  but  rapidly  growing  tourism 
sector. In 2017, tourism comprised 11.4% of Mongolia’s gross domestic product (GDP), generating 
$1.2 billion, 10.4% of total employment, and 121,500 jobs. By 2028, tourism is forecast to comprise 
11.0% ($2.1 billion) of GDP and provide 149,000 jobs. International visitor arrivals totaled 471,239 in 
2017  and  are  forecast  to  increase  to  1  million  by  2028.4 Developing  the  tourism  sector  is  a  high 
national  priority  to  diversify  the  economy  and  create  jobs,  especially  under  Mongolia’s  current 
economic  difficulties. The government’s  plans to  expand tourism focus on ecotourism  in protected 
areas, which encompass 21% of Mongolia’s area and are targeted to reach 30% by 2030. 
3. 
Mongolia  ranks  low  in  the  Travel  and  Tourism  Competitiveness  Index  (in  2017,  Mongolia 
was  ranked  102  out  of  136  countries  evaluated).  Challenges  include  low  service  standards, 
inadequate infrastructure, and a short tourism season due to harsh winters. Most protected areas 
are underfunded and located in remote regions of high poverty. Tourism, if unmanaged, may also 
result  in  ecological  and  cultural  impacts  and  provide  few  local  benefits. To  address  these  issues, 
the  government  has  initiated  the  National  Program  on  Tourism  Development,  2016–2030,  which 
aims  to  establish  Mongolia  as  a  global  destination  for  nomadic  culture.5 The  program  outlines  a 
phased  approach  for  tourism  development  that  focuses  initially  on  protected  areas  in  northern, 
central, and eastern Mongolia. It prioritizes investments in visitor facilities, transport and sanitation 
infrastructure,  and  community-based  products  and  services.  Five  sites  are  listed  to  pilot  and 
catalyze ecotourism development, two of which are designated the highest priority: Khuvsgul Lake 
National Park (KLNP) in Khuvsgul Aimag and Onon-Balj National Park (OBNP) in Khentii Aimag.6 
4. 
The KLNP (1.18 million hectares) and OBNP (0.42 million hectares) are the largest national 
parks in northern and eastern Mongolia. Khuvsgul Lake in the KLNP is Mongolia’s largest freshwater 
resource.7 The OBNP is the documented birthplace of Chinggis Khaan, a historical leader revered in 
Mongolia. Both parks support global biodiversity values, small populations with high poverty rates,8

Assistance to Mongolia for the Sustainable Tourism Development Project. Manila). 
2  Ecotourism  is  defined  as  “responsible  travel  to  natural  areas  that  conserves  the  environment,  sustains  the  well-
being  of  local  people,  and  involves  interpretation  and  education”.  The  International  Ecotourism  Society.  What  is

6  The other three sites are the Orkhon Valley National Park, Ugii Nuur Ramsar site, and Tuv Aimag (central Mongolia). 
Sites were selected based on high ecological and/or cultural values, poverty, and increasing visitor numbers.

8  Khuvsgul and Khentii  aimags exhibit high levels of poverty. In 2017, GDP per capita was $1,567 (Khuvsgul) and 
$1,842 (Khentii) versus a national mean of $3,591; and unemployment was 8.5% (Khuvsgul) and 10.1% (Khentii)

and transboundary river basins with the Russian Federation. Despite these similarities, the parks are 
at very different stages of tourism development. In 2017, the KLNP received about 89,000 visitors 
and  the  OBNP  received  about  20,400  visitors.9 Improved  road  and  air  access  to  the  KLNP  was 
established in 2010. Since then, visitor numbers have increased rapidly, and the park has become a 
major national tourism destination. Growth has been unplanned and has resulted in severe seasonal 
congestion, damage to natural resources, and few community benefits. In contrast, the OBNP has 
limited  road  and  no  air  access,  but  a  road  to  the  park  will  be  constructed  in  2021  as  part  of 
government efforts in regional tourism. Without planning, this may result in rapid increases in visitor 
numbers and similar impacts as at the KLNP.10 The KLNP and OBNP reflect many of the challenges 
faced in developing sustainable tourism in Mongolia’s protected areas, which require a focus on four 
key areas, as follows.  
Limited inclusive planning and  community  benefits. Few KLNP and OBNP residents 
5. 
derive income from tourism, and most tour camp employees are external workers.11 This is due to 
several linked factors. At the institutional level, livelihood and tourism targets are not included in 
the soum (county) development plans for either park. Residents face unique planning restrictions 
due to park regulations, yet soum and park management plans are not integrated. Khankh soum 
in the KLNP lacks any development plan but is the only soum in Mongolia located entirely within 
a  protected  area.  At  both  parks,  the  issuance  of  licenses  for  tour  camps  is  not  based  on 
systematic  procedures  or  social  and  environmental  standards.  This  has  favored  external 
operators, which have greater access to finance and external markets. Most residents have low 
capacity and capital to produce quality goods (e.g., handicrafts) or services (e.g., food supplies, 
guiding). Institutional support to promote local products and train residents is also limited. 
Insufficient  enabling  infrastructure.  Public  infrastructure  in  the  KLNP  and  OBNP  is 
6. 
limited or outdated. This impacts park management and the visitor experience. At the KLNP, the 
closest  area  to  the  provincial  capital  (Murun)  for  public  access  is  a  road  along  the  shore  of 
Khuvsgul  Lake.  This  supports  the  park’s  highest  numbers  of  tour  camps,  visitors,  and  vehicle 
activity.  The  road  is  unsealed  and  lacks  barriers,  signs,  or  car  parks.  Access  is  uncontrolled. 
Sections of lake shoreline are damaged from vehicle activity, and dust generated by vehicles is a 
significant  source  of  lake  pollution.  The  OBNP  has  few  visitor  facilities,  roads,  or  car  parks,  yet 
tourism growth is expected (footnote 11) and requires infrastructure planning. Neither park has a 
visitor center, which hinders fee collection, reduces the visitor’s sense of “destination,” and limits 
the  opportunity  to  inform  visitors  about  park  regulations  and  community  goods  and  services. 
Public trails are in poor condition, reducing visitor satisfaction and creating safety risks. 
Inadequate  waste  management. The KLNP and OBNP have no organized systems for 
7. 
waste  collection  or  treatment.  Public  toilets  are  mostly  unlined  pits,  and  sewage  seeps  into  the 
soil and waterbodies. Landfill sites are present at each park, but are shallow, unlined excavations 
versus  a  national  rate  of  7.5%.  The  KLNP  and  OBNP  are  located  in  10  soums  (counties),  with  poverty  rates  of 
36%–44%. In 2017, the total population in both parks was 36,573, of which about 25% was in three towns: Khatgal 
(3,195), Khankh (2,783) in the KLNP, and Dadal (3,006) in the OBNP. National Statistical Office. 2018.  Mongolian 
Statistical Yearbook 2017. Ulaanbaatar. 
9  From 2009 to 2017, visitor numbers rose by 572% in the KLNP and 528% in the OBNP (mean annual increases of 
38% and 32% respectively). Most arrivals (99%) are from June to August, according to visitor logbooks. 
10 Growth  projections  indicate  that,  by  2038,  annual  visitor  numbers  may  have  increased  to  about  161,000  at  the 
KLNP and 136,000 at the OBNP. Sector Assessment (Summary): Multisector (Agriculture, Natural Resources, and 
Rural Development; and Industry and Trade) (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). 
11 Tourism-related  income  is  defined  as  any  income-generating  activity  linked  with  tourism  goods  and/or  services, 
e.g., guides,  handicrafts,  food  suppliers,  and  camp  employees.  In  2018,  13.3%  (2,650)  of  KLNP  residents  and 
7.5% (1,249) of OBNP residents derived income from tourism. Sixty-three tour camps (50 in the KLNP and 13 in 
the OBNP) operated at the parks, with a total of 503 employees, of which 56% (283) employees were from other 
aimags. 
3 
with limited management. Projections based on population and tourism growth indicate that solid 
waste  generation  will  increase  by  over  290%  by  about  2038  (footnote  11).  At  the  KLNP,  the 
pristine quality of Khuvsgul Lake is threatened by sewage disposal, dust (para. 6), and litter. For 
both parks, poor sanitation is a key factor contributing to reduced visitor satisfaction. To address 
these  issues,  traditional  infrastructure  solutions  need  to  be  combined  with  small,  decentralized 
methods tailored to local conditions and seasonal changes in visitor numbers. 
8. 
Inadequate  park  management. The  KLNP  and  OBNP  administrations are  underfunded 
and  have  limited  equipment  and  resources.  Entry  fees,  tourism  concessions,  and  central 
government  funding  are  key  revenue  sources  for  both  parks,  yet  ticket  collection  booths  are 
poorly located and campsites are not well managed, resulting in a loss of revenue. Park staff do 
not  have  the  training  to  plan  for  and  manage  tourism  growth.  Both  parks  have  management 
plans,  yet  these focus  on  biodiversity  conservation  and  do  not  provide  guidelines  or  targets  for 
livelihoods,  tourism,  sanitation,  and  the  management  of  park  revenue  streams.  The  impact  of 
climate  change  is  a  cross-cutting  issue that  affects  many management  issues  at  the  KLNP  and 
OBNP.  Increasing  temperatures,  extreme  rainfall  events,  and  overgrazing  contribute  to  soil 
exposure,  permafrost  damage,  algal  blooms,  and  tree  dieback,  in  a  continuous  cycle  that  also 
increases fire risk.  
initiatives  and  strengthened  park  management.  Key 
9. 
Government  and  donor  efforts  are  addressing  some  of  these  issues.  Grant  projects 
funded by  the  Japan  Fund for  Poverty  Reduction (JFPR)  have been  implemented  at  the  OBNP 
(2008–2013)  and  KLNP  (2016–2019),  benefiting  more  than  4,000  residents  through  small 
business 
the 
establishment  of  community  revolving  funds  (for  income  diversification),  a  tourism  council  (to 
facilitate  tourism  planning),  community  waste  management  teams  (CWMT)  (litter  control),  and 
sustainable  financing  arrangements  to  maintain  the  revolving  funds  and  pay  team  salaries 
through campsite and public toilet entry fees.12 Civil society organizations and other donors have 
provided  support  for  park  equipment,  ranger  training,  litter  collection,  and  livelihoods.  These 
measures  have  been  small  in  scale  yet  provide  a  strong  platform  to  scale  up  and  achieve  a 
holistic approach for conservation and development at the KLNP and OBNP. Continued focus on 
these two parks is a priority to (i) leverage previous efforts; (ii) establish a new focus on tourism 
management, tailored to each park; (iii) for the OBNP, manage the opportunities and risks posed 
by pending road construction; and (iv) complement donor efforts in other protected areas.13

Strategic  fit.  The  project  is  aligned  with  Mongolia’s  National  Program  on  Tourism 
Development,  2016–2030  (footnote  6)  which  prioritizes  the  KLNP  and  OBNP  for  ecotourism 
development.  It  also  supports  the  country  partnership  strategy  for  Mongolia,  2017–2020  of  the 
Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  for  income  diversification  and  sustainable  tourism  in  wilderness 
areas,  and  is  listed  in  the  country  operations  business  plan  for  2019–2021;  and  ADB’s  Strategy 
2030 operational priorities A (reducing poverty), C (climate resilience, environmental sustainability), 
and  G  (regional  cooperation  and  integration).14 The  project  leverages  two  JFPR  grants  (footnote 
13) and is a timely response by ADB to support Mongolia’s growing tourism sector.

the  OBNP,  the  JFPR-supported  mechanisms  established  in  2008  to  2010  were  reviewed  and  remain  largely 
operational.

Lessons.  The  project  designs  reflect  the  experience  gained  from  the  JFPR  grants  at  the 
11. 
KLNP  and  OBNP;  and  incorporate  best-practice  lessons  for  ecotourism,  sanitation,  and 
infrastructure  by  ADB,  civil  society  organizations,  and  other  donors:  (i)  a  multisector  design  that 
addresses the linked issues of livelihoods, tourism, waste, and conservation, tailored to the different 
tourism  scenarios  at  each  park;  (ii)  transport  and  waste  management  designs,  which  combine 
structural and nonstructural measures; (iii) infrastructure designed for climate resilience, durability, 
and  cost-effectiveness;  (iv)  the  management  of  park  revenue  streams;  and  (v)  capacity  building, 
which builds on the grant trainings, focusing on the lead role of women for local tourism initiatives.15  
B. 
Impact and Outcome 
12. 
The  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  sustainable  economic  growth  and 
environmental improvement in Khuvsgul and Khentii aimags achieved (footnote 6). The project will 
have the following outcome: sustainable and inclusive tourism in the KLNP and OBNP developed.  
C. 
Outputs 
Output 1: Inclusive planning and capacity for community-based tourism enhanced. 
13. 
This  output  will  strengthen  the  institutional  framework  for  tourism  planning  and  increase  the 
number  of  local  beneficiaries  from  tourism.  The  project  will  (i)  revise  the  development  plans  for 
the  three  largest  settlements  at  the  KLNP  and  OBNP  to  include  livelihood  targets,  natural 
resource  use,  and  spatial  planning  for  about  9,000  residents,  based  on  growth  projections  and 
compatibility  with  park  management;  (ii)  establish  tourism  concession  manuals  and  an 
ecotourism  certification  program  for  each  park,  to  embed  social  and  gender  targets  and 
environmental  standards  in  the  concession  process,  strengthen  links  with  local  goods  and 
services, and provide a stable business framework for 63 tour camp operators and more than 500 
employees; (iii) strengthen the KLNP tourism council (para. 10) and replicate this at the OBNP to 
guide  tourism  planning;  (iv) install  information  facilities  in  the  Khuvsgul  Aimag  capital  (the 
gateway for most visitors to the KLNP) to promote KLNP products and services; and (v) build on 
the  previous  community  and gender  initiatives  by  providing  vocational  training  for  small  tourism 
businesses and service providers, and installing 11 women-led tourist markets, as outlets for the 
JFPR-trained  vendors.  About  10,500  residents  (50%  women)—one-third  of  the  population 
(footnote 9)—will benefit from tour camp jobs and/or new or expanded business opportunities. 
14. 
Output 2: Enabling infrastructure for tourism constructed. At the KLNP, the project will 
(i) upgrade 37.9 kilometers (km) of unsealed roads; (ii) construct eight small car parks (linked with 
the women-led tourist markets; output 1); and (iii) improve traffic control and safety, focusing on the 
sites  subject  to  the  highest  seasonal  congestion,  unregulated  public  access,  and  vehicle-induced 
pollution. At the OBNP, the project will (i) construct a tourism center, the Chinggis Khaan Tourism 
Complex  (CKTC);  (ii)  establish  supporting  infrastructure,  comprising  ticket  collection  booths, 
information signs, and three car parks; and (iii) upgrade a short access road (2.6 km), and extend 
(by 4.5 km) the soum power line, to the CKTC site. The CKTC will catalyze and strengthen tourism 
development for the OBNP. It will be managed by a state-owned company, which will have a key 
mandate  to  (i)  promote  community-led  tourism  at  the  OBNP;  and  (ii)  develop  low-impact  tourism 
activities based on heritage, education, and conservation values. It will prioritize local employment 
and community goods and services and work closely with the OBNP tourism council (output 1) for 
tourism  planning.  For  both  parks,  the  project  facilities  will  support  the  efficient  management  and

Output  3:  Waste  management  improved.  Output  3  will  (i)  facilitate  the  installation  of 
low-cost  and  gender-sensitive  toilet  systems  at  about  102  tour  camps,  campsites,  and  project-
funded car parks. The project will replicate successful JFPR-funded toilet designs, procedures for 
operation and  maintenance  (O&M),  and CWMTs,  including  sustainable financing for  the  CWMT 
salaries  (para.  9);  and  scale  these  up  at  the  KLNP  and  OBNP;  (ii)  construct  three  wastewater 
treatment plants (WWTPs); and (iii) upgrade three landfill sites, for a total new capacity of 72,500 
cubic meters, and develop new procedures for recycling and waste management. The cumulative 
benefits  of  the  grant  and  loan-funded  interventions  will  provide  improved  hygiene  conditions  for 
more than 9,000 residents (about 50% women) and 290,000 visitors per year at both parks.   
16. 
Output  4:  Park  management  strengthened.  Output  4  will  (i)  construct  a  KLNP 
headquarters  and  visitor  center,  two fee  collection  stations,  and  a  road  control  station.  This  will 
improve revenue collection, strengthen the visitor experience, promote local goods and services, 
and improve protection of  the  park’s  core zone and wilderness  values;  (ii)  rehabilitate  15 km  of 
public  trails  subject  to  high  seasonal  use;  (iii)  revise  the  KLNP  and  OBNP  management  plans 
with the project measures, including O&M costs and financing sources for the project facilities;16 
(iv) prepare  a  4-year  action  plan  for  each  park,  to  guide  the  implementation  of  the  revised 
management  plans;  and  (v)  train  park  and  soum  government  staff  (about  40%  women)  to 
implement  the  revised  plans.  The  officially  endorsed  plans,  together  with  the  new  soum 
development plans (output 1), will provide the first comprehensive guidance for central and local 
government  to  manage tourism,  conservation,  and  development  at  the  KLNP  and  OBNP.  They 
will align with provincial tourism plans and contribute to regional tourism development targets. 
17. 
Promoting  innovation,  knowledge,  and  value  added  by  ADB  assistance. This will be 
the first loan project for Mongolia to focus on tourism and protected area management. The designs 
scale  up  from  measures  established  under  two  JFPR  grants  and  other  donor  efforts,  and  match 
these  with  physical  investments  and  institutional  planning.  Key  features  include  (i) piloting  of  the 
first tourism concession manuals and eco-certification program for protected areas in Mongolia; (ii) 
the  introduction  of  international  standards  for  the  construction  and  operation  of  rural  landfills;  (iii) 
adaptation  measures  to  address  adverse  climate  change  impacts,  including  climate-resilient  road 
designs  and  incorporation  of  climate  resilience  in  the  revised  park  management  and  soum 
development plans; (iv) infrastructure designs based on growth projections and cost efficiency; and 
(v)  cross-cutting  links  between  each  output,  including  the  integrated  siting  of  roads,  car  parks, 
public  toilets,  and  tourist  markets.  Lessons  learned  will  be  disseminated  as  part  of  the  project 
stakeholder  communication  strategy  (para.  98).17 The  designs  are  consistent  with  best  practice 
principles for sustainable tourism in protected areas.18 
18. 
The details of each output and subcomponents are summarized in Appendix 1.  
16 O&M  costs for  the  project  facilities have  been  established. Project  revenue  streams  and O&M  financing sources 
include income from the tourism concessions (output 1) and entry fees for the parks, visitor centers, public toilets, 
and  campsites  (outputs  2–4). Opportunities  for  public–private  partnerships  to  manage  the WWTPs,  landfills,  and 
visitor centers will be assessed during implementation.

III. 
PROJECT MANAGEMENT ARRANGEMENTS 
A. 
Project Implementation Organization – Roles and Responsibilities 
The Ministry of Environment and Tourism (MET) is the executing agency responsible for 
19. 
overall project implementation. MET’s Department of Protected Area Management (DPAM) will 
be the implementing agency for the Khuvsgul subproject. MET’s Department of Tourism Policy 
Coordination (DTPC) will be the implementing agency for the Khentii subproject. Guidance and 
sector coordination will be through a national project steering committee (PSC). The PSC will be 
chaired  by  the  State  Secretary  of  MET  and  will  meet  at  least  twice  a  year  during  project 
implementation. The PSC will be represented at the daily level by a technical working group of 
technical  officers  from  each  PSC  agency.  The  technical  working  group  will  assist  the 
implementing agencies for regular coordination between line agencies.  
20. 
A project implementation unit (PIU) will be established, with one central office, at MET in 
Ulaanbaatar, and two field offices, at the headquarters of the KLNP Administration (in Khatgal 
Town, Khuvsgul aimag) and OBNP Administration (in Dadal soum, Khentii aimag). The PIU will 
be  responsible  for  daily  project  management,  including  accounting,  procurement,  training, 
monitoring,  and  reporting.  The  PIU  will  be  chaired  by  the  Director  General  of  DPAM,  in  close 
coordination with the Director General of DTPC. The executing and implementing agencies lack 
the  personnel  and  resources  needed  to  fully  implement  the  project,  and  the  PIU  staff  will 
comprise consultants recruited for the administrative and technical tasks. 
21. 
Once the PIU structure is approved by MOF, MET will finalize and acquire no objection 
from  ADB  on  the  TOR  of  the  PIU  staff,  and  publicly  announce  the  vacancies  through  local 
newspapers  as  well  MET  website.  Project  implementation  arrangements,  including  the 
establishment  of  the  PSC,  selection  and  hiring  of  the  PIU  staff,  reporting,  and  other  relevant 
arrangements,  will  comply  with  Mongolia’s  Regulation  on  Utilization  of  Proceeds  of  Foreign 
Implementation,  Administration,  Financing,  Monitoring  and 
Loans  of 
Evaluation of Projects and Programs Funded by Such Proceeds, approved under the Order of 
the Minister of Finance and other relevant regulations approved and amended from time to time, 
provided  they  do  not  conflict  with  the  provisions  of  the  loan  agreements, 19  this  project 
administration manual or ADB policies. 
the  Government; 
22. 
The  MET  will  assume  overall  responsibility  for  the  project  implementation,  including 
authorization  of  the  PIU  staff  contracts  (with  contracting  of  the  PIU  procurement  and  financial 
specialists  to  be  undertaken  by  MOF  upon  request  by  MET).  The  Director  Generals  of  DPAM 
and DTPC  will  together be responsible for the  annual  review  of  PIU  staff performance,  overall 
project  reporting,  and/or  other  management  issues,  and  will  coordinate  closely  throughout 
project implementation.

IV. 
COSTS AND FINANCING 
The project is estimated to cost $38.4 million, including taxes and duties of $3.4 million. 
24. 
The major expenditure item is civil works.  
25. 
The government has requested a regular loan of $19 million and a concessional loan of 
$19 million from ADB’s ordinary capital resources to help finance the project. The regular loan 
will  have  a  26-year  term,  including  5-year  grace  period;  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in 
accordance  with  ADB’s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility;  a 
commitment charge of 0.15% per year (the interest and other charges during implementation to 
be  capitalized  in  the  loan);  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan 
agreement.  Based  on  the  straight-line  method,  the  average  maturity  is  15.75  years,  and  the 
maturity premium payable to ADB is 0.10% per year. The concessional loan will have a 25-year 
term,  including  5-year  grace  period  and  an  annual  interest  rate  of  2.0%,  with  no  maturity 
premium or commitment charge; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan 
agreement.20 
26. 
ADB  will  finance  the  expenditures  in  relation  to  civil  works,  equipment,  materials, 
consulting services, training, and taxes and duties. The government will finance taxes and duties. 
No  land  acquisition  costs  apply.  All  PIU  staff  and  national  consultant  salaries  are  inclusive  of 
personal  income  taxes;  such  personnel  are  responsible  for  fulfilling  their  Mongolian  tax 
obligations. Salaries for international consultants and resource persons who are required to pay 
tax on their income earned in Mongolia are  inclusive of relevant taxes, i.e. the project will pay 
the  relevant  tax;  the  treaties  for  the  avoidance  of  double  taxation  will  need  to  be  checked  to 
determine  whether  income  taxes  need  to  be  paid  by  the  international  consultants  or  not.  The 
government has assured ADB that it will provide additional funding for any shortfall of funds or 
cost overruns to ensure the success of the project. 
Climate adaptation finance (ADB financing only) is estimated as $5.5 million. Details are 
27. 
in the climate change assessment.21 
A. 
Cost Estimates Preparation and Revisions 
28. 
Preparation. Cost estimates were prepared during the project preparation in compliance 
with ADB’s Guidelines on Preparing and Presenting Cost Estimates for Projects and Programs 
Financed by ADB. Costs were prepared in a participatory process between DPAM and DTPC, 
the Ministry of Finance (MOF), and the transaction technical assistance consultants, under the 
guidance of the ADB project team. Costing was conducted using government costing standards, 
cost information from the site investigations, and market analysis of similar projects in Mongolia.  
Revision.  The  project  cost  estimates  (Tables  4–8)  will  be  reviewed  during 
29. 
implementation (including during detailed design) and updated as necessary, considering actual 
contract prices and actual expenditures. The PIU, on behalf of the executing and implementing 
agencies,  will  prepare  any  proposed  cost  revisions.  The  executing  agency  will  submit  any 
proposed  cost  revisions,  together  with  a  request  for  reallocation,  to  MOF  and  ADB  for  review 
and endorsement.  If the  revision  is  endorsed, the PIU  will  revise the  cost  estimates  under the 
guidance of ADB project officer. 
20 The terms and conditions of the two loans are set forth in the draft loan agreements.

Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors).

B. 
Key Assumptions 
30. 
The following key assumptions underpin the cost estimates and financing plan: 
(i)  Exchange rate: MNT 2,408.49 = $1.00 (as of 8 June 2018). 
(ii)  Price contingencies based  on  expected  cumulative inflation  over  the  implementation 
period are as follows:

FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT 
A. 
Financial Management Assessment 
A financial management assessment (FMA)  was conducted between  May and October 
31. 
2017  of  MET’s  DPAM,  DTPC,  and  Financial  Division;  the  KLNP  Administration  and  OBNP 
Administration under  DPAM;  and,  the  finance  departments  of  the  Khuvsgul  and  Khentii  aimag 
governments.  The  FMA  was  conducted  in  accordance  with  ADB  guidelines,22 including  use  of 
the  ADB  Financial  Management  Assessment  Questionnaire  and  interviews  with  government 
personnel  in  each  agency. The  FMA focused  on fund flow  arrangements,  staffing,  accounting, 
financial  reporting  systems,  financial  information  systems,  and  internal  and  external  auditing 
arrangements.  The  assessment  was  supplemented  by  information  from  a  previous  FMA 
conducted by ADB of DPAM, in 2015, for a previous ADB-funded project,23 and, a key review on 
public financial management in Mongolia.24  
32. 
The  pre-mitigation  risk  for  financial  management  of  the  project  was  assessed  to  be 
substantial.  Inherent  risks  concern  the  volatility  of  the  national  economy,  which  is  currently 
narrowly based on the minerals sector, and weaknesses in fiscal management. These risks are 
being addressed by the government with coordinated assistance from the donor community, in 
parallel  with  efforts  to  diversify  the  economic  base through  support  to  agriculture  and  tourism. 
Project-specific risks comprise relatively limited financial management capacity of the executing 
and  implementing  agencies  (due  to  the  small  size  of  MET’s  Financial  Division)  and  weak 
internal auditing functions within the implementing agencies.   
A  financial  management  action  plan  has  been  prepared  to  address  these  risks  (Table 
33. 
10).  The  plan  includes  the  following  mitigation  measures:  (i)  a  qualified  accountant  and  a 
procurement  officer  will  be  recruited  in  the  PIU  to  manage  accounts  and  procurement, 
respectively; (ii) financial management software acceptable to ADB will be used for the project, 
supported by maintenance of hardcopy ledgers and records; (iii) training in ADB disbursement 
requirements and procedures; and (iv) regular review and/or updating of the action plan during 
project  implementation,  to  ensure  the  project  responds  dynamically  to  risks.  These  tasks  are 
included  in  the  terms  of  reference  for  the  project  accountant.  MET’s  Financial  Division  will 
provide  financial  oversight  to  DPAM  and  DTPC,  working  closely  with  the  PIU  accountant;  and 
ADB will provide intermittent financial training and mentorship to DPAM and DTPC, as needed. 
Overall,  based  on  the  findings  of  the  FMA,  and  the  corrective  actions  in  the  financial 
management  action  plan,  MET  is  assessed  to  have  sufficient  capacity  to  manage  the  project 
financial  management  procedures,  including  the  advance  accounts  and  statements  of 
expenditures,  based  on  experience  and  familiarity  in  implementing  ADB  and  other  donor 
projects.

Disbursement 
1. 
Disbursement Arrangements for ADB 
34. 
The  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Loan  Disbursement 
Handbook  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time),25 and  detailed  arrangements  agreed  upon 
between ADB and the government. Online training for project staff on disbursement policies and 
procedures  is  available.26 Project  staff  are  encouraged  to  avail  of  this  training  to  help  ensure 
efficient disbursement and fiduciary control. 
35. 
Advance  fund procedure. Two separate advance accounts for the project (one for the 
regular  loan  and  one  for  the  concessional  loan)  will  be  established  in  a  commercial  bank  or 
Treasury Single Account (TSA) at MOF. The currency of the advance accounts  will be the US 
dollar.27 The ADB loan proceeds will be paid into the advance accounts, which will be operated 
by  the  executing  agency,  the  MET.  The  advance  accounts  will  be  used  exclusively  for  ADB’s 
share  of  eligible  expenditures.  DPAM,  with  the  support  of  the  PIU,  will  be  responsible  for  the 
management, monitoring, and reconciliation of the advance accounts. The PIU will process the 
invoices of contractors and will generate requests for replenishments of the advance accounts 
25 The handbook is available electronically from the ADB website (https://www.adb.org/documents/loan-
disbursement-handbook) 
26 Disbursement elearning: http://wpqr4.adb.org/disbursement_elearning 
27 Currently,  MOF  is  working  to  establish  foreign  currency  accounts  under  the  TSA.  Once  this  arrangement  is  in 
place, all USD accounts will be transferred  to TSA upon consultation with ADB. Until this is  introduced, advance 
accounts will be established under a commercial bank. 
28 
and provide detailed reporting of all financial flows. Two local currency (MNT) accounts (one for 
the regular loan and one for the concessional loan) will also be established for the project. Both 
local currency accounts will be held under the TSA at MOF. The local currency accounts will be 
maintained  by  the  PIU  on  behalf  of  MET  and  will  be  for  daily  expenditures  including  for 
payments to contractors, suppliers, consultants. MET’s DPAM and DTPC will ensure that every 
liquidation  and  replenishment  from  the  project  accounts  is  supported  by  documentation  in 
accordance  with  ADB’s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2017,  as  amended from  time  to  time). 
Co-signing  responsibilities  are  as  follows:  (i)  withdrawal  applications  submitted  to  ADB  will  be 
co-signed  by  MOF  and  MET;  (ii)  expenditures  in  US$  paid  from  the  advance  accounts  will  be 
co-signed  by  the  Director-General,  DPAM  and  PIU  coordinator;  and  (iii)  transfer  of  loan 
proceeds from the advance accounts to the local currency accounts, and, expenditures in MNT 
paid from the local currency accounts, will be co-signed by the Director-General, DPAM and PIU 
coordinator.  
36. 
The total outstanding advance to the advance accounts will not exceed the estimate of 
ADB’s  share  of  expenditures  to  be  paid  through  the  advance  accounts  for  the  forthcoming  6 
months. MET and MOF may request for initial and additional advances to the advance accounts 
based  on  an  estimate  of  expenditure  sheet 28 setting  out  the  estimated  expenditures  to  be 
financed  through  the  account  for  the  forthcoming  6  months.  Supporting  documents  will  be 
submitted  to  ADB  or  retained  by  DPAM  and  the  PIU  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  Loan 
Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time) when liquidating or replenishing 
the advance accounts. 
Statement  of  expenditure  procedure  (SOE).29 The  SOE  procedure  may  be  used  for 
37. 
reimbursement  of  eligible  expenditures  or  liquidation  of  advances  to  the  advance  accounts. 
Supporting  documents  and  records  for  the  expenditures  claimed  under  the  SOE  should  be 
maintained and made readily available for review by ADB's disbursement and review missions, 
upon  ADB's  request  for  submission  of  supporting  documents  on  a  sampling  basis,  and  for 
independent audit. 
38. 
Before  the  submission  of  the  first  withdrawal  application,  MET  and  MOF  will  submit  to 
ADB  sufficient  evidence  of  the  authority  of  the  person(s)  who  will  sign  the  withdrawal 
applications on behalf of the government, together with the authenticated specimen signatures 
of  each  authorized  person.  The  minimum  value  per  withdrawal  application  is  stipulated  in  the 
Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Individual  payments 
below  such  amount  should  be  paid  (i)  by  the  MET  and  subsequently  claimed  to  ADB  through 
reimbursement, or (ii) through the advance fund procedure, unless otherwise accepted by ADB. 
The  borrower  should  ensure  sufficient  category  and  contract  balances  before  requesting 
disbursements.  Use  of  ADB’s  Client  Portal  for  Disbursements  system  is  encouraged  for 
submission of withdrawal applications to ADB.30 
39. 
Condition for withdrawal from the loan accounts. No withdrawals will be made from 
the  loan  accounts  until  the  PIU  has  been  established  and  has  engaged  a  qualified  project 
coordinator, financial specialist and procurement specialist. 
28  Estimate  of  Expenditure  sheet  is  available  in  Appendix  8A  of  ADB’s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2017,  as 
amended from time to time). 
29  SOE forms are available in Appendix 7B and 7D of ADB’s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from 
time to time). 
30  The  Client  Portal  for  Disbursements  system  facilitates  online  submission  of  withdrawal  applications  to  ADB, 
resulting  in  faster  disbursement.  The  forms  to  be  completed  by  the  Borrower  are  available  online  at 
https://www.adb.org/documents/client-portal-disbursements-guide. 
29 
2. 
Disbursement Arrangements for Counterpart Fund 
40. 
Government  counterpart  contributions  to  the  project  are  in-kind  only  comprising 
exemption of selected taxes and duties,  and,  the  work time  of government  personnel. The  tax 
and custom duties exemptions will be accounted and recorded by the PIU, to properly account 
for  the  government  counterpart  financing  for  the  project.  The  amounts  exempted  will  be 
recorded as part of the cost of the assets purchased and/or services contracted. 
3. 
Accounting 
41.  MET, through the PIU, will maintain separate books and records by funding source for all 
expenditures  incurred  on  the  project  following  the  International  Public  Sector  Accounting 
Standard.  MET,  through  the  PIU,  will  prepare  consolidated  project  financial  statements  on 
accrual basis in accordance with the government's accounting laws and regulations, which are 
consistent  with  international  accounting  principles  and  practices.  Reports  to  MOF  will  be 
prepared monthly and quarterly. 
4. 
Auditing and Public Disclosure 
42.  MET, through the PIU, will cause the  detailed consolidated project financial statements 
to  be  audited  in  accordance  with  International  Standards  on  Auditing  or  equivalent  national 
standards,  by  an  independent  auditor  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  audited  project  financial 
statements together with the auditor’s opinion will be presented in the English language to ADB 
within  6  months  from  the  end  of  the  fiscal  year  by  MET.  This  procedure  will  complement  and 
extend existing domestic procedures for auditing, which comprises an external audit by MOF of 
all ministries (including MET) financial accounts every two years, and MOF annual training to all 
ministry accounting staff. MOF has agreed to ensure that project accounts are subject to annual 
audit. 
43. 
The audit report for the project financial statements will include a management letter and 
auditor’s opinions, which cover (i) whether the project financial statements present an accurate 
and fair view or are presented fairly, in all material respects, in accordance with the applicable 
financial  reporting  standards;  (ii)  whether  the  proceeds  of  the  loans  were  used  only  for  the 
purpose(s) of the project; and (iii) whether the borrower or executing agency was in compliance 
with the financial covenants contained in the legal agreements (where applicable). 
The MET, through the PIU, will cause the company that owns and operates the CKTC to 
44. 
provide  the  annual  financial  statements  prepared  in  accordance  with  financial  reporting 
standards  and  audited  annually  by  independent  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  audited 
financial statements together with the auditor’s opinion will be presented in English language to 
ADB within 1 month after their approval by the relevant authority. 
45. 
Compliance  with  financial  reporting  and  auditing  requirements  will  be  monitored  by 
review  missions  and  during  normal  program  supervision,  and  followed  up  regularly  with  all 
concerned, including the external auditor. 
46.  MET and MOF have been made aware of ADB’s approach to delayed submission, and 
the  requirements  for  satisfactory  and  acceptable  quality  of  the  audited  project  financial 
statements.31 ADB reserves the right to require a change in the auditor (in a manner consistent 
31 ADB’s approach and procedures regarding delayed submission of audited project financial statements:  
30 
with the  constitution of the  borrower),  or for  additional  support to be  provided to the  auditor,  if 
the  audits  required  are  not  conducted  in  a  manner  satisfactory  to  ADB,  or  if  the  audits  are 
substantially delayed. ADB reserves the right to verify the project's financial accounts to confirm 
that the share of ADB’s financing is used in accordance with ADB’s policies and procedures.  
47. 
Public disclosure of the audited project financial statements, including the audit report on 
the project financial statements and auditor’s opinion on the project financial statements, will be 
guided  by  ADB’s  Access  to  Information  Policy  and  Article  IV,  Section  4.02  (b).32 After  review, 
ADB will disclose the audited project financial statements and the opinion of the auditors on the 
project financial statements by posting them on ADB’s website no later than 14 days after ADB’s 
confirmation  of  their  acceptability.  The  management  letter,  additional  auditor’s  opinions,  and 
audited entity financial statements will not be disclosed.33  
(i)  When  audited  project  financial  statements  are  not  received  by  the  due  date,  ADB  will  write  to  the  executing 
agency  advising  that  (a)  the  audit  documents  are  overdue;  and  (b)  if  they  are  not  received  within  the  next  6 
months, requests for new contract awards and disbursement such as new replenishment of advance accounts, 
processing of new reimbursement, and issuance of new commitment letters will not be processed. 
(ii)  When audited project financial statements are not received within 6 months after the due date, ADB will withhold 
processing  of  requests  for  new  contract  awards  and  disbursement  such  as  new  replenishment  of  advance 
accounts, processing of new reimbursement, and issuance of new commitment letters. ADB will (a) inform the 
executing agency of ADB’s actions; and (b) advise that the loans may be suspended if the audit documents are 
not received within the next 6 months. 
When audited project financial statements are not received within 12 months after the due date, ADB may suspend 
the loans.

PROCUREMENT AND CONSULTING SERVICES 
48. 
Procurement  risk  assessment.  All  procurement  and  consultant  recruitment  for  the 
project  will  be  implemented  by  DPAM  and  DTPC,  through  the  PIU.  A  procurement  risk 
assessment was conducted for DPAM and DTPC, in accordance with the ADB’s Guidance Note 
on Strategic Procurement Planning. In accordance with ADB’s new procurement framework, the 
procurement  risk  assessment  included  a  market  assessment  to  understand  and  assess  the 
availability  of  potential  qualified  bidders  to  supply  works,  goods  and  services  for  the  project 
components. The overall project procurement risk is moderate. The main weaknesses identified 
include:  (i)  limited  experience  by  MET  with  requirements  for  procurement  by  international 
donors;  and  (ii)  lack  of  procedures  in  place  for  procurement  management  and  project 
implementation. 
49.  Mitigation  measures  have  been  applied  to  address  these  risks  and  include:  (i)  the 
inclusion  of  a  qualified  procurement  specialist  as  part  of  the  PIU,  who  will  lead  the  project 
procurement in close cooperation with MET and ADB; (ii) on-the-job training to MET personnel 
during  project  implementation,  to  be  conducted  by  the  PIU  procurement  specialist  and  ADB. 
This  will  supplement  the  preliminary  training  provided  to  staff  of  MET’s  DPAM,  DTPC,  and 
Financial  Division  during  project  preparation,  which  included  ADB  procedures for  procurement 
of goods, works and consulting services; and (iii) prior review for most packages (Section VI.B). 
A. 
Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing 
50. 
The  government  cannot  take  advantage  of  advance  contracting  and/or  retroactive 
financing  due  to  restrictions  under  national  law,  that  do  not  allow  budgets  to  be  committed  to 
projects which are not yet ratified by Parliament. Advance procurement actions will be applied to 
begin  recruitment  of  the  PIU  coordinator,  financial  specialist,  and  procurement  specialist, 
including  advertisement  and  proposal  evaluation,  as  the  project  has  been  ratified  under  a 
the  Government  and  ADB.  Any  advance 
financing 
procurement actions will be undertaken at the Borrower’s own risk. The loan proceeds may only 
be used to fund eligible expenditures incurred after effectiveness of the loan agreements.

B. 
Procurement of Goods, Works, and Consulting Services 
51. 
All  procurement  of  goods  and  works,  and  consulting  services,  will  follow  ADB’s 
Procurement  Policy  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  Procurement  Regulations  for 
ADB  Borrowers  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).34 Open  competitive  bidding  (OCB)  will 
be used to procure the project goods and works. 
52. 
The  procurement  plan  comprises  a  total  of  30  packages  with  51  contracts:  two  OCB 
packages  for  works  for  international  advertisement;  four  OCB  packages  for  works  for  national 
advertisement;  two  goods  packages  (with  a  total  of  nine  contracts)  for  requests  for  quotation 
(previously “shopping”); one community participation package (with a total of 15 contracts); four 
consulting services packages through quality- and cost-based selection; two consulting services 
packages  through  consultants’  qualifications  selection;  and,  15  packages  for  individual 
consultants  (competitive  for  individual  consultant;  previously  “individual  consultant  selection”). 
The  two  packages  for  international  advertisement  reflect:  (i)  the  results  of  the  market

32 
assessment,  which  indicated  the  interest  of  foreign  bidders  for  similar  works  in  previous 
projects; and (ii) the unique nature and design requirements of the CKTC. 
53. 
Twenty-four packages are for ADB’s prior review and six are for post review (sampling). 
ADB review of packages will include assessment of the invitations for bids, bidding documents, 
bid evaluation reports, and draft negotiated contracts. Prequalification of bidders is not required 
for any of the packages. For the packages subject to ADB’s post review (sampling), the reviews 
may be conducted at each reimbursement cycle, when a series of withdrawal applications are 
received,  or  as  part  of  project  review  missions  by  ADB  or  its  consultants.  Alternatively,  the 
reviews  may  be  organized  as  distinct  post  review  missions  on  a  regular  basis.  The  Borrower 
must  retain  all  documentation  with  respect  to  each  contract  where  post  review  was  adopted 
during  project  implementation  and  for  at  least  one  year  after  the  project  closing  date.35 The 
relevant  sections  of  ADB’s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  will  be 
included in all procurement documents and contracts.36 
54. 
Before the  start  of  any  procurement,  ADB  and  the  government  will  review  the  national 
public  procurement  laws  to  ensure  consistency  with  ADB’s  Procurement  Policy  (2017,  as 
amended  from  time  to  time)  and  Procurement  Regulations  for  ADB  Borrowers  (2017,  as 
amended from time to time).

The procurement assessment examined potential for attracting enough qualified bidders. It was 
concluded that only two works packages would require international advertising to attract 
enough qualified bidders. All the other open competitive bidding packages can therefore be 
advertised nationally. 
The procurement assessment examined potential for attracting enough qualified bidders. There 
are only two goods packages for the project, each for relatively small amounts, which will be 
procured based on minimum of three quotes per package.

a. 
Open Competitive Bidding for National Advertisement 
Regulation and Reference Documents 
58. 
The procedures to be followed for national competitive bidding shall be those set forth in 
the  Public  Procurement  Law  of  Mongolia  of  1  December  2005,  effective  1  February  2006,  as 
amended  on  February  2007, July  2009,  February,  June and  December 2011,  2014,  2016  and 
2017 (hereinafter referred to as PPLM), with the clarifications and modifications described in the 
following  paragraphs  required  for  compliance  with  the  provisions  of  ADB's  Procurement 
Guidelines. 
b. 
Procurement Procedures 
59. 
Eligibility. The eligibility of bidders shall be as defined under paragraphs 1.14 to 1.18 of 
the  Procurement  Regulations  for  ADB  Borrowers,  as  amended  from  time  to  time;  accordingly, 
no bidder or potential bidder should be declared ineligible for reasons other than those provided 
in  the  Procurement  Regulations  for  ADB  Borrowers.  Government-owned  enterprises  in 
Mongolia  shall  be  eligible  for  project  only  if  they  can  establish  that  they:  (i)  are  legally  and 
financially  autonomous;  (ii)  operate  under  the  principles  of  commercial  law;  and  (iii)  are  not 
dependent  agencies  of  the  Borrower,  Beneficiary,  Recipient  Executing  Agency  and/or  the 
Implementing Agency.  
Participation of foreign bidders. International bidders from eligible countries of ADB shall 
60. 
be allowed to participate in local procurement and may not be denied participation due to nationality.  
Preferences.  No  domestic  preference  shall  be  given  for  domestic  bidders  and  for 
61. 
domestically manufactured goods.  
62. 
Prequalification  and  registration.  Prequalification  is  discouraged  for  procurement 
contracts using OCB for national advertisement. When used, particularly for works contracts, an 
individual prequalification exercise is acceptable for each contract as is the use of a registration 
system (or approved standing list) of contractors based on criteria such as experience, financial 
capacity,  and  technical  capacity.  Foreign  bidders  from  eligible  countries  must,  however,  be 
allowed to register and to bid without unreasonable cost or additional requirements. 
63. 
Rejection  of  all  bids  and  rebidding.  All bids shall not be rejected, or new bids invited 
without  ADB's  prior  written  concurrence.  No  bid  shall  be  rejected  merely  on  the  basis  of  a 
comparison  with  the  estimated  cost  or  budget  ceiling  without  ADB's  prior  written  concurrence 
(with specific reference to Article 30 of the PPLM).  
37 
Bidding Documents  
c. 
Use  of  bidding  documents.  National Standard Bidding Documents Goods and Works 
64. 
that have been approved for procurement in ADB-financed projects shall be used.  
Language. Bidding documents may be prepared in Mongolian language, but a copy of 
65. 
the bidding documents must be made available in English and submitted to ADB for review. 
66. 
Bid  validity.  Bidders  shall  be  requested  to  extend  the  validity  of  their  bids  only  under 
exceptional  circumstances  and  the  Executing  or  Implementing  Agency,  as  the  case  may  be, 
shall  communicate  such  request  for  extension  to  all  bidders  before  the  date  of  expiry  of  their 
bids.  When  the  procurement  is  subject  to  ADB's  prior  review,  the  Executing  or  Implementing 
Agency,  as  the  case  may  be,  shall  obtain  in  a  timely  manner  the  prior  written  concurrence  of 
ADB for the extension of the bid validity period.  
d. 
Bid Evaluation  
Evaluation  and  qualification  criteria,  and  submission  requirements,  to  be  used  in  each 
67. 
bidding activity shall be clearly specified in the bidding documents. The evaluation of bids shall 
be done in strict adherence to the criteria specified in the bidding documents.  
Negotiations  with  bidders  shall  not  be  undertaken  before  award  of  contract,  except  as 
68. 
provided in Paragraph 90 of ADB's 2017 Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers. A bidder 
shall  not  be  required,  as  a  condition  for  award,  to  undertake  obligations  not  specified  in  the 
bidding documents or otherwise to modify its bid as originally submitted.  
69. 
At the same time that notification on award of contract is given to the successful bidder, 
the  results  of  the  bid  evaluation  shall  be  posted  on  a  well-known  freely  accessible  website 
(namely  www.tender.gov.mn)  identifying the  bid and  lot  numbers  and providing  information  on 
the: (i) name of each bidder that submitted a bid; (ii) bid prices as read out at bid opening; (iii) 
names of bidders whose bids were rejected and the reasons for their rejection; and (iv) name of 
the winning bidder, and the price it offered, as well as the duration and summary scope of the 
contract  awarded.  The  Executing  Agency  or  Implementing  Agency,  as  the  case  may  be,  shall 
respond in writing to unsuccessful bidders who seek explanations on the grounds on which their 
bids were not selected.  
e. 
ADB Policy Clauses  
70. 
Each  contract  financed  with  the  proceeds  of  the  loans  shall  provide  that  the  suppliers 
and contractors shall permit ADB, at its request, to inspect their accounts and records relating to 
the  performance  of  the  contract  and  to  have  said  accounts  and  records  audited  by  auditors 
appointed  by  ADB.  A  provision  shall  be  included  in  all  bidding  documents  for  the  OCB  works 
and goods contracts financed by ADB, stating that the borrower shall reject a proposal for award 
if  it  determines  that  the  bidder  recommended  for  award  has,  directly  or  through  an  agent, 
38 
engaged in corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, coercive, or obstructive practices in competing for the 
contract in question. A provision shall be included in all bidding documents for the OCB works 
and  goods  contracts  financed  by  ADB,  stating  that  ADB  will  declare  a  firm  or  individual 
ineligible, either indefinitely or for a stated period, to be awarded a contract financed by ADB, if 
it at any time determines that the firm or individual has, directly or through an agent, engaged in 
corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  coercive,  or  obstructive  practices;  or  any  integrity  violation  in 
competing for, or in executing, the ADB-financed contract.

A. 
Environment 
VII. 
SAFEGUARDS 
Environment  due  diligence.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  B  for  environment. 
72. 
The initial environmental examination (IEE), including an environmental management plan, was 
prepared  and  disclosed  on  the  ADB  website.  The  IEE  concluded  that  full  and  effective 
implementation of the project environmental management plan (EMP), together with the training 
and  project  assurances,  will  minimize  the  environmental  risks  of  the  project  and  achieve 
compliance with the policy and regulatory standards applied in this project environmental impact 
assessment.  
Environmental Management Plan. The project EMP (Appendix 3) is to be implemented 
73. 
in all phases of the project: design, pre-construction, construction, and operation. The EMP is to 
ensure  project  compliance  with  Mongolia’s  environmental  laws  and  ADB’s  Safeguard  Policy 
Statement  (2009).  The  EMP  describes:  the  roles  and  responsibilities  of  project  agencies  to 
implement the  EMP;  anticipated  impacts  and  mitigation measures;  inspection, monitoring,  and 
reporting arrangements; training and institutional strengthening; grievance redress mechanism; 
and future public consultation. In the engineering design stage, MET, through the PIU, will pass 
the  EMP  to  the  firms  contracted  to  prepare  the  detailed  engineering  designs  for  the  project 
facilities. The EMP will be updated at the end of the detailed design, as needed. To ensure that 
bidders  will  respond  to  the  EMP’s  provisions,  MET,  through  the  PIU,  will  prepare  and  provide 
the specification clauses for incorporation into the bidding documents: (i) a list of environmental 
management  requirements  to  be  budgeted  by  the  bidders  in  their  bids;  (ii)  environmental 
clauses for contractual terms and conditions; and (iii) the project IEE and updated EMP. 
74. 
Capacity building. MET has limited experience with ADB-funded projects or safeguard 
requirements. During the project design phase, on-the-job training on EMP implementation was 
conducted,  including  roles  and  responsibilities  of  contractors  and  construction  supervision 
companies  for  EMP  implementation,  the  project  impacts  and  mitigation  measures.  During 
implementation, a capacity building program will be implemented on: (i) the EMP, including the 
mitigation  measures,  monitoring,  and  reporting;  (ii)  incorporation  of  the  EMP  into  bidding 
documents; (iii) ecological management for the KLNP and OBNP; and (iv) sanitation and solid 
waste management. Training will be provided by the PIU team, especially the PIU specialists for 
environment  safeguards,  social  safeguards,  protected  area  management,  and  waste 
management.  Trainees  will  be  the  KLNP  and  OBNP  administrations,  contractors,  contractors 
and construction supervision companies, and soum government agencies. The PIU will arrange 
the  training  programs,  supported  by  the  KLNP  and  OBNP  administrations  and  soum 
government agencies. 
Grievance  redress  mechanism.  A  project  grievance  redress  mechanism  (GRM)  has 
75. 
been  developed  in  compliance  with  ADB’s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (SPS)  (2009) 
requirement  to  address  environmental,  health,  safety,  and  social  concerns  associated  with 
project.  The  GRM  is  designed  to  achieve  the  following  objectives:  (i)  provide  channels  of 
communication for local communities to raise concerns about environmental and social-related 
grievances which might result from the project; (ii) prevent and mitigate adverse environmental 
and  social  impacts  to  communities  caused  by  project  construction  and  operation;  and  (iii) 
contribute  to  cooperation  between  the  project  agencies  and  communities.  Public  grievances 
related to the project components to be addressed by the GRM may include damage to public 
roads, interruption of public services, dust emissions, noise, soil erosion, inappropriate disposal 
of  waste  materials,  and  safety  for  the  general  public  and  construction  workers.  The  GRM  is 
40 
accessible to all members of the communities, including women, youth, minorities and poverty-
stricken residents. Multiple points of entry are available, including face-to-face meetings, written 
complaints,  telephone  conversations,  e-mail,  and  social  media.  The  details  of  the  GRM, 
including a time-bound flow chart of procedures, are included in the project EMP. 
B. 
Involuntary Resettlement 
76. 
The project is categorized as C for involuntary resettlement. The project is not expected 
to  involve  land  acquisition,  economic  or  physical  displacement,  or  involuntary  restrictions  on 
land use or on access to protected areas. All civil works and activities will be implemented within 
the existing sites or on state-owned lands. A due diligence report confirming the category C on 
involuntary resettlement was prepared during the project preparation phase. The findings will be 
reconfirmed during the detailed design phase. 
C. 
Indigenous Peoples 
The  project  is  categorized  as  C  for  indigenous  peoples.  The  project  is  not  expected  to 
77. 
impact  communities  of  indigenous  peoples  that  would  trigger  ADB  SPS  requirements  on 
indigenous peoples. Khuvsgul aimag supports the largest population of a minority ethnic group, 
the Dukha ("reindeer people", also known as "Tsaatan" in Mongolian), whose current population 
in  Mongolia  is  estimated  at  between  200–400  persons.  The  main  settlements  of  this  ethnic 
group are located over 50 kilometers northwest of the KLNP. In the OBNP, there are no ethnic 
minority  groups  who  qualify  to  be  indigenous  people  in  accordance  with  the  definition  of  such 
people in SPS (2009). Due diligence reports confirming the category C on indigenous peoples 
were prepared during the project preparation phase. The findings will be reconfirmed during the 
detailed design phase.  
D. 
Public Consultation, Participation, and Stakeholder Communication 
78. 
Public  consultation  and  participation  during  project  implementation  are  particularly 
important  for  this  project,  as  the  project  locations  are  of  high  cultural  importance  in  Mongolia. 
CSOs supporting livelihoods and/or natural resources management are active at the KLNP and 
OBNP  and  there  is  also  frequent  media  coverage  of  these  parks.  During  project  preparation, 
consultations were held with communities at the proposed project sites, as well as national and 
international CSOs, tour operators, and soum government agencies, to discuss the designs and 
safeguards. To ensure continued consultation and participation during project implementation, a 
consultation and participation plan (CPP; Appendix 4) and stakeholder communication strategy 
(SCS; Appendix 5) have been prepared. 
79. 
The  CPP  and  SCS  emphasize  consultation,  and  dissemination  of  project  progress, 
throughout  implementation.  The  implementing  agencies  and  PIU  will  facilitate  and  implement 
consultations with communities in the project areas, and other key stakeholders such as CSOs, 
during preparation of the detailed designs, before and during construction, and operation of the 
project  facilities.  The  CPP  is  based  on  the  principles  of  meaningful  consultation,  including 
involvement  of  women, 
inclusive-  and  culturally-respectful  approaches,  prioritizing 
vulnerable  groups  (including  rural  herders),  unemployed  people,  single-parent  households, 
disabled persons, and the poor. Whenever needed, consultation methods will be tailored to the 
specific  situations  of  the  target  groups  e.g.  interviews  with  herder  households,  meetings  with 
women’s  councils  and  youth  representatives,  household  visits  to  disabled  persons,  focused 
group  discussions,  and  collective  planning  workshops.  Concerns  and  suggestions  raised  by 
stakeholders  and  measures  to  address  these  will  be  documented  in  the  project  reports  and 
the 
41 
incorporated as part of the appropriate mitigation measures. Documentary proof of consultations 
(e.g., attendance sheets, minutes of meetings, experts' records, photographs) shall be included 
in  the  documentation.  The  CPP  also  includes  introduction  and  use  of  the  project  GRM,  and 
procedures to document the project consultations. 
80. 
The SCS focuses on the timely and effective dissemination of project activities, findings, 
and results, to stakeholders within and outside the project sites, including decision makers and 
other donors and protected area managers. 
81. 
The PIU is responsible for ensuring that all consultation and disclosure documentation is 
properly  and  systematically  kept  as  part  of  the  project  records.  The  PIU  shall  make  relevant 
project disclosure documents available in a form, language, and at a location in which they can 
be  easily  accessed  by  all  stakeholders  including  residents.  The  results  of  environmental  and 
social  monitoring  reports  will  be  included  in  the  project  semi-annual  progress  reports  to  ADB, 
which will be posted on ADB’s website.

VIII.  GENDER AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS 
A. 
Poverty Reduction and Social Development 
A key project objective is to maximize local benefits from the tourism sector, through the 
83. 
creation  of  diversified  opportunities  for  stable  income  generation,  prioritizing  the  local 
population,  particularly  women,  the  poor,  and  other  vulnerable  groups  (herders,  disabled 
persons, and single parent-headed households); as well as through the environmentally-friendly 
infrastructure improvements that will benefit both the local communities and the tourism sector. 
84. 
The  project  has  been  designed  for  inclusive  and  sustainable  tourism  development, 
concentrating on the creation and distribution of equitable benefits to residents. The project will 
enhance  tourism  benefits  for  communities  in  the  soums  in  and  around  KLNP  and  OBNP  by: 
promoting  favorable  conditions  for  establishing  and  strengthening  local  tourism  products  and 
services; providing focused training for specific products and services and skills, building on the 
JFPR-supported  trainings;  prioritizing  links  between  the  communities  and  tour  operators;  and, 
strengthening and expanding the existing local value chains for tourism goods and services, to 
expand  markets  and  employment  opportunities.  The  project  designs  for  social  benefits  build 
upon and utilize the JFPR-supported initiatives, especially the community-based organizations, 
local  tourism  councils,  buffer  zone  councils,  CWMTs,  and  community  revolving  funds 
established under the grants; and training for income diversification. 
85. 
Poverty  and  social  analyses,  and  tourism  value  chain  studies,  were  conducted  during 
project  preparation.  The  designs  incorporate  measures  that  target  women,  the  poor,  and 
vulnerable groups. A social and gender action plan (SGAP) has been prepared (Table 10) and 
comprises  measurable  actions  and  indicators  under  each  output  to  ensure  that  residents 
participate in and benefit from the project. The PIU Social, Gender and Civil Society Specialist 
will facilitate and coordinate implementation of the SGAP.    
B. 
Gender 
86. 
The  project  is  classified  “effective  gender  mainstreaming”  under  ADB’s  project  gender 
classification  system.  The  designs  emphasize  establishing  and/or  expanding  livelihood 
opportunities for women, and greater participation in decision-making, leadership, and business 
creation. The SGAP (Table 11) provides design targets to ensure that women benefit from the 
project  through  capacity  building,  tourism-related  opportunities,  and  direct  roles  in  the 
community-based tourism planning and management.

B. 
Monitoring 
87. 
Project  performance  monitoring.  A  project  performance  monitoring  system  will  be 
established for the  project.37 The  design  and  monitoring framework  (DMF;  Section  IX.A) forms 
the  basis  for  monitoring  the  project  progress.  During  project  implementation,  the  project 
performance  monitoring  system,  through  the  project  performance  report,  will  monitor  the 
likelihood that key milestone dates for activities, outputs, outcome, and impact will be achieved. 
For  the  impact,  measured  5  years  after  project  completion,  this  will  be  assessed  indirectly 
through  monitoring  assumptions  and  risks.  The  DMF  will  be  reviewed  during  the  project 
implementation  and  if  needed,  adjusted  to  reflect  changing  circumstances  and  project 
environments  so  that  the  project  outcome  can  be  achieved.  Following  project  completion,  the 
project is subject to an assessment of the outcome along with recommendations for enhancing 
and  sustaining  the  outcome.  A  project  completion  report  will  also  include  a  preliminary 
assessment of the impact. The project impact, outcome, outputs, and targets and indicators can 
be seen in the DMF. 
37  ADB’s  project  performance  monitoring  system  is  a  coherent  and  results-based  approach  to  project  planning,  performance 
monitoring, and evaluation of results. The project performance monitoring system comprises five components: (i) DMF; (ii) project 
performance report; (iii) loan recipient’s monitoring and evaluation (at the central and executing and implementing agency levels); 
(iv) project completion report; and (v) project performance evaluation report, and where appropriate, impact evaluation studies. 
The  DMF  provides  the  basis  upon  which  the  PPMS  operates.  It  does  this  by  establishing  quantified,  time-bound  targets  and 
measurable indicators, and by identifying key risks and assumptions that are used to monitor and evaluate performance in the 
PPR, PCR, and PPER. 
49 
The  PIU  will  monitor  project  implementation  through  reports  prepared  by  the  PIU  staff 
88. 
based  on  daily  project  implementation,  site  visits,  and  feedback  from  the  executing  and 
implementing agencies, project steering committee, beneficiaries, and other stakeholders. ADB 
will  monitor  project  performance  in  five  aspects,  i.e.,  technical,  procurement,  disbursement, 
financial  management,  and  safeguards,  through  the  executing  agency’s  quarterly  progress 
reports  (prepared  by  the  PIU  and  endorsed  by  the  executing  agency),  and  ADB  review 
missions.  
Compliance  monitoring.  The  PIU  on  behalf  of  the  executing  agency  will  monitor 
89. 
compliance with covenants stipulated in the loan agreements. ADB will monitor the compliance 
status  through  the  executing  agency’s  quarterly  progress  reports,  ADB  review  missions;  and 
take necessary remedial measures for any non-compliance. 
90. 
Environmental safeguards monitoring. The PIU will monitor the implementation of the 
EMP,  including  the  grievance  redress  mechanism  and  include  progress  as  part  of  the  overall 
reporting  to  the  PIU.  PIU  team  members  will  screen,  monitor,  and  report  the  activities  under 
their coordination against the EMP, and these tasks are included in the PIU terms of reference. 
Progress reporting will be: (i) semi-annual, during construction and implementation of the EMP; 
and (ii) annual, during operation of the project facilities until issuance of the project completion 
report. In the event of any environmental incidents, accidents, or complaints, the implementing 
agencies  and  PIU  will  immediately report  these to  the  executing agency  and ADB. If required, 
corrective actions will be developed and agreed upon between the executing and implementing 
agencies, PIU, ADB and other relevant agencies.  
Social  safeguards  monitoring.  No  involuntary  resettlement  impacts  are  expected 
91. 
under  the  project.  The  project  is  also  not  expected  to  impact  indigenous  peoples  that  would 
trigger  ADB  SPS  requirements.  The  PIU  will  monitor  and  further  confirm  the  project’s  social 
safeguard  categories  and  due  diligence  assessment  after  the  detailed  design.  Findings  of 
further due diligence and monitoring will be included in the project’s quarterly progress reports.  
Gender  and  social  dimensions  monitoring.38 The  project  outcome  and  outputs  are 
92. 
intended to achieve inclusive livelihood benefits for the communities in the project area. The PIU 
Social, Gender and Civil Society Specialist will monitor and record implementation of the SGAP, 
including  sex-disaggregated  data  and  information  on  achievements  against  the  targets  on 
social,  gender,  and  participatory  aspects  of  the  project  implementation.  Monitoring  and 
evaluation results of the SGAP will be incorporated into the project quarterly progress reports. 
The PIU specialist will work closely with the project stakeholders during the monitoring.  
C. 
Evaluation 
Project  performance  will  be  regularly  monitored and  rated  through  ADB’s  e-Operations 
93. 
project implementation module. ADB’s overall loan implementation rating will be made based on 
five performance  indicators: technical,  procurement,  disbursement, financial  management,  and 
safeguards  (Section  IX.B).  Such  rating  will  be  updated  semi-annually  based  on  executing 
agency’s quarterly project progress reports and/or ADB review missions.

50 
ADB  will  conduct  an  inception  mission  when the  loans  become  effective.  ADB  and  the 
94. 
government  will  jointly  field  review  missions  of  the  project  at  least  once  a  year.  The  missions 
will:  (i)  review  overall  implementation  of  the  project  and  update,  in  consultation  with  the 
executing  agency,  the  project  implementation  schedule;  (ii)  examine  existing  and  potential 
implementation problems, and find out measures with the executing agency to resolve them; (iii) 
review  progress  in  procurement  and  disbursement;  (iv)  review  the  loan  recipient's  compliance 
with  loan  covenants  and,  where  there  is  any  noncompliance  or  delay,  discuss  proposed 
remedial measures; and (v) assess the likelihood of attaining the project’s outcome. 
95. 
ADB  and  the government  will  undertake a midterm  review  at  the  beginning  of the  third 
year  of  project  implementation,  to  assess  implementation  status  and  take  appropriate 
measures—including modification of scope and implementation arrangements, and reallocation 
of loan proceeds, as appropriate—to achieve the project’s outcomes and impact.  
96. 
A final ADB review mission will take place within 6 months after physical completion of 
the  project.  This  mission  will:  (i)  assess  project  performance  against  targets  and  benchmarks 
including  any  revision(s)  as  agreed  during  the  midterm  review;  (ii)  identify  any  incomplete 
activities,  or  unused  project  funds;  and  (iii)  determine  the  project  satisfactory  rating.  A  project 
completion  report  will  be  prepared,  in  cooperation  with  the  government.  In  case  the  project  is 
selected  as  a  sample for  performance  evaluation  reporting, the  project will  be  subject to more 
detailed  performance  evaluation  and  impact  assessment  about  3  or  more  years  after 
completion.  
D. 
Reporting 
97.  MET  will  provide  ADB  with:  (i)  quarterly  progress  reports  in  a  format  consistent  with 
ADB’s  project  performance  reporting  system,  including  (a)  progress  achieved  by  output  as 
measured  through  the  indicator’s  performance  targets,  (b)  key  implementation  issues  and 
solutions,  (c)  updated  procurement  plan,  and  (d)  updated  implementation  plan  for  the  next  12 
months;  and  (ii)  a  project  completion  report  within  6  months  of  physical  completion  of  the 
project.  To  ensure  that  the  project  will  continue  to  be  viable  and  sustainable,  the  project 
accounts and audited financial statements together with the associated auditor’s report, should 
be adequately reviewed. 
E. 
Stakeholder Communication Strategy 
A SCS has been prepared for the project (Appendix 5). The KLNP and OBNP have high 
98. 
cultural importance in Mongolia. The KLNP is revered as the “Blue Pearl” and “Mother Ocean”, 
and  the  OBNP  is  the  birthplace  of  Chinggis  Khaan,  a  revered  historical  military  leader.  Both 
parks  are  high-profile  areas  and  subject  to  frequent  media  coverage  as  well  as  increasing 
government  and  private  sector  attention  for  tourism.  The  project  will  implement  stakeholder 
participation and communication, especially with local communities, CSOs, tour operators, and 
guest house owners. The SCS prescribes timely and inclusive dissemination of project progress 
and  the  opportunity  for  feedback  from  stakeholders.  The  SCS  focuses  on  three  objectives:  (i) 
effective  communication  with  the  project  stakeholders  in  the  KLNP  and  OBNP,  to  achieve 
informed  and  supportive  engagement;  (ii)  project  visibility  and  media  to  ensure  public  and 
political  awareness  of  and  support  for  the  project;  and  (iii)  coordination  and  alignment  of  the 
project  activities  with  other  donor  programs  at  the  KLNP  and  OBNP  and  for  protected  area 
management and tourism in Mongolia. 
51 
X.  ANTICORRUPTION POLICY 
99. 
ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any violations of the 
Anticorruption  Policy  relating  to  the  project. 39  All  contracts  financed  by  ADB  shall  include 
provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the 
executing  agency  and  all  project  contractors,  suppliers,  consultants,  and  other  service 
providers.  Individuals  and/or  entities  on  ADB’s  anticorruption  debarment  list  are  ineligible  to 
participate in ADB-financed activity and may not be awarded any contracts under the project.40 
100.  To support these efforts, relevant provisions are included in the loan agreements and the 
bidding documents for the project.  
XI.  ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISM 
101.  People who  are,  or may  in the future  be,  adversely  affected  by the  project  may  submit 
complaints  to  ADB’s  Accountability  Mechanism.  The  Accountability  Mechanism  provides  an 
independent  forum  and  process  whereby  people  adversely  affected  by  ADB-assisted  project 
can voice, and seek a resolution of their problems, as well as report alleged violations of ADB’s 
operational  policies  and  procedures.  Before  submitting  a  complaint  to  the  Accountability 
Mechanism,  affected  people  should  make  an  effort  in  good  faith  to  solve  their  problems  by 
working with the  concerned ADB  operations  department. Only  after  doing  that,  and  if they  are 
still dissatisfied, should they approach the Accountability Mechanism.41  
XII.  RECORD OF CHANGES TO THE PROJECT ADMINISTRATION MANUAL 
102.  All revisions and/or updates during course of implementation should be retained in this 
Section to provide a chronological history of changes to implemented arrangements recorded in 
the  project  administration  manual,  including  revision  to  contract  awards  and  disbursement  s-
curves.

APPENDIX 3. ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PLAN 
A. 
Objectives 
This environmental management plan (EMP) is for the Khuvsgul and Khentii subprojects 
1. 
of the Sustainable Tourism Development project (hereafter referred to as the project). The EMP 
is to be implemented in all phases of each subproject – design, pre-construction, construction, 
and  operation.  The  EMP  is  to  ensure  project  compliance  with  Mongolia’s  environmental  laws 
and  the  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (SPS,  2009)  of the  Asian  Development  Bank (ADB). The 
EMP  describes:  the  roles  and  responsibilities  of  relevant  institutions  for  EMP  implementation; 
potential impacts and the measures to mitigate them; environmental monitoring and inspection; 
institutional  strengthening  and  training;  inspection,  monitoring,  and  reporting  arrangements; 
grievance redress mechanism (GRM); and, future public consultation. 
2. 
During  preparation  of  the  detailed  engineering  designs  (after  loan  effectiveness),  the 
project implementation unit (PIU), acting on behalf of the executing and implementing agencies, 
will  pass  this  EMP  to  the  engineering  design  institutes  for  incorporation  of  the  mitigation 
measures  into  the  detailed  designs.  If  necessary,  the  EMP  will  be  updated  at  the  end  of  the 
detailed design, to reflect any significant changes as compared with the designs agreed in the 
project documents between the Government of Mongolia and ADB. To ensure that bidders will 
respond  to  the  EMP’s  provisions,  the  PIU  will  prepare  and  provide  the  following  specification 
clauses  for  incorporation  into  the  bidding  documents:  (i)  a  list  of  environmental  management 
requirements  to  be  budgeted  by  the  bidders  in  their  proposals,  (ii)  environmental  clauses  for 
contractual  terms  and  conditions,  and  (iii)  the  domestic  General  EIA  (GEIA)  and  Detailed  EIA 
(DEIA), and the project initial environmental examination (IEE), including the updated EMP, for 
compliance. 
B. 
Organizations and their Responsibilities for EMP Implementation 
3. 
MET  is  the  executing  agency  responsible  for  overall  project  implementation.  The 
implementing  agencies  are  MET’s  Department  of  Protected  Area  Management  (DPAM) 
(Khuvsgul  subproject)  and  Department  of  Tourism  Policy  Coordination  (DTPC)  (Khentii 
subproject). Each department will be supported by the Khuvsgul Lake National Park (KLNP) and 
Onon-Balj  National  Park 
(OBNP)  administrations  and  Khuvsgul  and  Khentii  Aimag 
governments.  
Guidance and sector coordination will be through the project steering committee (PSC) 
4. 
and technical working group (TWG) to be established during loan effectiveness. The PSC and 
TWG will build on the previous PSC and TWG that operated for the project preparation phase. 
The  committee  will  include  representatives  from  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF),  Ministry  of 
Roads  and  Transport,  Ministry  of  Construction  and  Urban  Development,  Ministry  of  Power, 
Khuvsgul  and  Khentii  Aimag  governments,  and  other  relevant  agencies.  The  committee  will 
meet  at  least  twice  a  year.  The  TWG  will  represent  the  committee  at  the  daily  level  for 
coordination between line agencies. 
5. 
A PIU will be established, with a central office at MET (Ulaanbaatar) and a field office for 
each  subproject:  in the  aimag  centers,  Murun (Khuvsgul  subproject)  and  Öndörkhaan  (Khentii 
subproject).  The  PIU  staff  will  comprise  consultants,  who  will  be  responsible  for  project 
implementation,  including  accounting,  procurement,  training,  preparation  and  dissemination  of 
knowledge products, monitoring, and reporting. The PIU will be chaired by the Director General 
of  DPAM.  The  PIU  will  be  responsible  for  the  implementation  of  the  Khuvsgul  and  Khentii 
90 
subprojects under the project, with close coordination and oversight from the DPAM and DTPC.

Potential Impacts and Mitigation Measures 
Table EMP-2 summarizes the potential impacts of the subproject subcomponents during 
7. 
project  preparation,  design,  construction  and  operation,  and  the  mitigation  measures.  The 
mitigation measures will be incorporated into detailed design, bidding documents, construction 
contracts  and  operational  management  manuals,  by  the  design  institutes  (during  detailed 
design) and contractors (during construction), under the supervision of the PIU and PSCs. The 
effectiveness  of  the  measures  will  be  evaluated  based  on  environmental  inspections  and 
monitoring to determine whether they should be continued, improved or adjusted.

Training, Awareness Raising and Capacity Building 
9. 
MET,  the  KLNP  and  OBNP  administrations,  and  the  Khuvsgul  and  Khentii  Aimag  and 
soum  governments  have  some  experience  with  ADB-funded  projects,  including  through  the 
implementation of two grants (MON-9183 and MON-9125; see IEE Section II). However, none 
of  these  agencies  have  experience  of  a  large-scale  loan  project  and  associated  safeguard 
management. To ensure effective implementation of the EMP, a capacity building program will 
be  implemented.  Training  will  focus  on  the  mitigation  measures,  monitoring,  and  reporting 
requirements in this EMP, and will be conducted by the PIU environment and social safeguard 
specialists,  with  facilitation  and  support  from  the  MET  project  environment  and  social  officers, 
aimag and soum environmental inspectors, and the General Agency for Specialized Inspection 
and  its  local  (aimag  and  soum)  inspectors.  Trainees  will  include  MET,  DPAM  and  DTPC, 
contractors, CSCs, and soum environment, water, and forestry officials.  
10. 
The  PIU  will  organize  the  trainings  for  both  subprojects.  The  training  shall  include,  but 
not  be  limited to:  (i) coordination  with the  PIU  procurement  specialist for inclusion  of the  EMP 
and  other  relevant  environmental  clauses  in  the  bidding  documents  for  the  project  works;  (ii) 
minimizing waste at source; (iii) respecting and protecting wildlife at site; (iv) proper handling of 
the  waste;  (v)  occupational  health  and  safety  measures  during  work  and  emergency 
preparedness  in  case  of  incidents;  (vi)  establishment  and  implementation  of  the  GRM;  (vii) 
implementation of the mitigation and monitoring measures; and, (vi) reporting.

Grievance Redress Mechanism 
11. 
A  project  grievance  is  defined  as  an  actual  or  perceived  project-related  problem  that 
results  in  a  complaint  by  an  affected  person.  The  PIU  will  work  proactively  toward  preventing 
grievances through the implementation of mitigation measures and community consultations. To 
address any complaints that do arise, this project grievance redress mechanism (GRM) will be 
established.  The  GRM  is  a  simple  and  time-based  process  for  receiving,  recording,  and 
addressing project-related grievances transparently and quickly. The GRM will be accessible to 
diverse members of the local communities, including more vulnerable groups such as women, 
youth and elderly.  Multiple points  of  entry,  including face-to-face meetings,  written complaints, 
telephone  calls,  or  e-mail,  will  be  available.  Opportunities  for  confidentiality  and  privacy  for 
complainants  will  be  honored  where  requested.  The  GRM  does  not  impede  or  replace  legal 
procedures and Mongolia’s judicial system. 
In Mongolia, residents' complaints or concerns are generally communicated taken to the 
12. 
bagh (village) or soum representatives, and this system has been integrated into the GRM. 
13. 
The  PIU  environment  officer  and  social  officer  will  be  the  lead  coordinators  for  GRM 
implementation. All project agencies and staff will be trained in the GRM and will take an active 
role in supporting  these staff  as  and when necessary. The  PIU  environment  officer  and social 
officer will establish a GRM tracking and documentation system, instruct all project agencies in 
the  GRM  procedures,  conduct  daily  coordination  with  project  agencies,  arrange meetings  and 
conduct  site  visits  as  necessary,  maintain the  overall  project  GRM  database,  and  prepare the 
reporting  inputs for  progress reports to ADB. In each  project  soum  and bagh,  the government 
will nominate a focal person for the GRM. The names and contact details of the PIU, soum and 
bagh focal points will be disseminated to the project agencies and communities. Upon receiving 
any  complaints,  the  bagh  and  soum  focal  points  will  immediately  inform  the  PIU  environment 
and/or social officer.   
14. 
Once  a  complaint  is  received  and  filed,  the  MET  and  PIU  officers  will  identify  if 
complaints are eligible. Eligible complaints include those where (i) the complaint pertains to the 
106 
project; and (ii) the issues arising in the complaint fall within the scope of environmental issues 
that  the  GRM  is  authorized  to  address.  Ineligible  complaints  include  those  where:  (i)  the 
complaint is clearly not project-related; (ii) the nature of the issue is outside the mandate of the 
environmental GRM  (such  as  allegations  of fraud or  corruption);  and  (iii)  other  procedures  are 
more appropriate to address the issue. Ineligible complaints will be recorded and passed to the 
relevant  authorities  and  the  complainant  will  be  informed  of  the  decision  and  reasons  for 
rejection. The procedure and timeframe for the GRM is as follows; and see Figure EMP-1.  
•  Stage  1  (5  working  days):  If  a  concern  arises,  the  affected  person  may  resolve  the 
issue directly with the contractor or make the complaint known to the soum or bagh focal 
point, other local authorities, park administrations, PIU, or any level of authority they are 
comfortable  with.  Whenever  possible,  the  contractor  will  resolve  the  issue  directly  with 
the affected person. The issue shall be immediately reported to the PIU. 
•  Stage  2  (5 working  days): If the issue cannot be resolved in Stage 1, after five days, 
the  PIU  will  take  over  responsibility  in  close  coordination  with  the  soum  and/or  bagh 
focal point. The eligibility of the complaint will be assessed, and a recommended solution 
given  to  the  complainant  and  contractors  within five  (5)  working  days.  If  the  solution  is 
agreed  by  the  complainant,  the  contractors  and/or  facility  operators  will  implement  the 
solution within seven days. Written records will be made of all stages and outcomes. 
•  Stage  3  (10  working  days):  If  no  solution  can  be  identified  in  Stage  2  and/or  the 
complainant is not satisfied with the proposed solution, the PIU and soum and/or bagh 
focal  points  will  organize,  within  ten  (10)  days,  a  stakeholder  meeting  (including  the 
complainant, contractor and/or operator of the facility, and local government agencies). 
A  solution  acceptable  to  all  shall  be  identified  including  clear  steps.  The  contractors 
(during construction) and facility operators (during operation) will immediately implement 
the agreed solution. Written records will be made of all stages and outcomes. 
15. 
The  executing  and/or  implementing  agencies  shall  bear  any  and  all  costs  of 
implementing  the  GRM,  including  meeting,  travel,  and/or  accommodation  costs  of  the 
government  staff  or  affected  person.  The  GRM  will  be  implemented  throughout  project 
construction and at least the first year of operation for each project facility. The PIU will include 
any grievances, steps taken, and results, within the semi-annual reports to ADB. 
Accountability  mechanism.  ADB  implements  an  “accountability  mechanism”  as  a 
16. 
forum where people adversely affected by ADB-assisted projects can voice and seek solutions 
to  their  problems  and  report  alleged  noncompliance  of  ADB's  operational  policies  and 
procedures. The policy is available at: http://www.adb.org/documents/accountabilitymechanism-
policy-2012. The mechanism is designed to: (i) enhance ADB's development effectiveness and 
project  quality;  (ii)  be  responsive  to  the  concerns  of  project-affected  people  and  fair  to  all 
stakeholders;  (iii)  reflect  the  highest  professional  and  technical  standards  in  its  staffing  and 
operations;  (iv)  be  as  independent  and  transparent  as  possible;  and  (v)  be  cost-effective, 
efficient,  and  complementary  to  the  other  supervision,  audit,  quality  control,  and  evaluation 
systems  at  ADB.  The  mechanism  provides  two  approaches  to  which  affected  persons  may 
apply: (i) review of perceived grievances and complaints, which is undertaken by ADB’s Office 
of  Special  Project  Facilitator  (OSPF);  and  (ii)  review  of  whether  non-compliance  with  ADB’s 
policies has occurred, which is undertaken by ADB’s Compliance Review Panel. 
17. 
The  PIU,  in  its  trainings  and  consultations,  shall  inform  project  stakeholders  about  the 
Accountability  Mechanism.  As  far  as  possible,  attempts  should  first  be  made  to  resolve  any 
grievances through the project GRM, before applying to the Accountability Mechanism.

Public Consultation and Awareness Raising 
18. 
Public  consultations  were  conducted  during  project  preparation  and  will  continue 
throughout the project implementation. The public consultations will raise awareness of project 
activities,  especially  those  which  may  impact  the  public  such  as  noise  or  dust.  A  public 
consultation  plan  is  in  Table  EMP-6.  This  includes  public  participation  in  evaluating 
environmental  benefits  and  impacts.  The  PIU  environment  officer  and  social  officer  are 
responsible for  facilitating the  public  consultations,  with  support  from  all  project  agencies.  The 
(CPP)  and  stakeholder 
the  consultation  and  participation  plan 
plan  complements 
communication strategy (SCS) for the overall project (see project administration manual).

Cost Estimates 
19. 
This  section  provides  an  estimate  of  the  cost  of  EMP  implementation.  The  cost 
comprises three categories: mitigation measures, monitoring, and training (Table EMP-6). Costs 
are  for  the  construction  phase  of  five  years  and  the  first  year  of  operation,  i.e.  a  total  of  six 
years. The costs do not include: (i) detailed design revisions and adjustments; and (ii) salaries 
of government and PIU staff. Costs are based on the experience of the TRTA team from other 
projects  in  Mongolia  and  in  other  countries.  The  total  estimated  cost  is  $78,720  (including 
surveys, travels, sampling analyses, trainings) for five years of construction phase and the first 
year of operation. The EMP costs have been incorporated into the overall project budget. Most 
costs relate to implementation of the EMP mitigation and monitoring measures and will be paid 
through the contracts with the works contractors and construction supervision companies.

Mechanisms for Feedback and Adjustment 
Based  on  the  established  project  environmental  monitoring  and  reporting  systems,  the 
20. 
EA,  IAs,  and  PIU  shall  assess  whether  further  mitigation  measures  are  required  as  corrective 
actions, and/or whether improvement in environmental management practices are required. The 
effectiveness  of  mitigation  measures  and  monitoring  plans  will  be  evaluated  by  a  feedback 
reporting system. The PIU will play a critical role in the feedback and adjustment mechanism. If 
the PIU identifies a substantial deviation from the EMP, or if any changes are made to the scope 
of  the  subprojects  that  may  cause  significant  adverse  environmental  impacts  or  increase  the 
number of affected people, then the PIU shall immediately consult MET and ADB for feedback 
and/or approval to update the EMP. If necessary, further public consultations will be undertaken. 
The  revised  domestic  EIAs  and  project  IEE,  including  this  EMP,  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  for 
review,  appraisal,  and  public  disclosure.  The  revised  EMP  will  be  passed  to  the  contractors, 
CSCs and operators of the project facilities for implementation. 
111 
APPENDIX 4. CONSULTATION AND PARTICIPATION PLAN 
A. 
Introduction and Objectives 
The  aim  of  this  consultation  and  participation  plan  (CPP)  is  to  help  ensure  that 
1. 
meaningful  stakeholder  consultation  occurs  during  project  implementation.  The  CPP  is  based 
on  stakeholder  consultations  conducted  during  project  preparation  and  is  consistent  with  the 
consultation  tasks  outlined  in  the  project  environment  management  plan  (EMP;  Appendix  3). 
Although  the  need  for  stakeholder  consultation  during  project  implementation  is  already 
captured  within  the  EMP,  the  project  sites  have  significant  ecological  and  cultural  values,  are 
supported  by  a  range  of  local  and  international  CSOs  for  livelihoods  and  natural  resources 
management  and  are  subject  to  public  and  media  interest.  The  CPP  provides  guidance  for 
meaningful  stakeholder  engagement  i.e.  consultation  that  is:  ongoing  throughout  the  project 
cycle;  involves  all  relevant  stakeholder  groups;  is  transparent,  inclusive,  equitable,  and 
respectful;  provides  timely  information  to  stakeholders  and  which  is  provided  in  appropriate 
format  and  manner;  ensures confidentiality  where appropriate;  and,  systematically  documents, 
and disclosed, as needed.   
The  objectives  of  the  CPP  are  to:  (i)  provide  a  systematic  basis  for  consultation  of 
2. 
stakeholder  groups  and 
to  participate  during  project 
implementation;  (ii)  provide  time-bound  activities  and  budget;  and,  (iii)  identify  institutions  and 
people responsible for implementation of consultation and participation activities.  
to  create  a  platform

Stakeholder Consultation during Project Preparation 
3. 
Stakeholders  for  the  project  areas  comprise  about  five  categories:  government,  civil 
society  organizations,  donor-funded  projects,  private  enterprise,  and  communities.  During 
project  preparation,  about  1,018  stakeholders  were  consulted  (Table  1;  Annexes  1  and  2). 
These consultations, and stakeholder assessments, provide the basis for the CPP.

Methods applied for stakeholder consultation during project preparation included public 
meetings,  focused  group  discussions,  and  key  informant  interviews.  These  methods  will  be 
applied  during  project  implementation,  as  well  the  use  of  public  media  for  provision  of 
information  prior  to  consultation  events  and  also  information  disclosure  e.g.  TV,  radio,  social 
media, text messages, newspapers and other printed materials.1  
1   According to the poverty and social analysis, 95% of residents in the 10 soums of the KLNP and OBNP possess 
mobile phones; 6% have radios; 90% have a television; and 13% have computers.

households,  single  men,  the  elderly,  disabled,  sick,  and/or  poor)  with,  as  far  as  possible,  a 
balanced  representation  of  men  and  women.  Assess  on  a  case  by  case  basis  whether  it  the 
consultation  would  be  more  effective  with,  or  without,  government  representation;  and  in  the 
event that government does not participate, follow up to ensure relevant agencies are informed 
of the consultation outcomes. 
9. 
Meaningful  means  seeking  feedback  from  participants,  involving  them  in  decision
