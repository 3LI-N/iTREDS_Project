Project Administration Manual Purpose and Process 
The  project  administration  manual  (PAM)  describes  the  essential  administrative  and 
management requirements to implement the project on time, within budget, and in accordance 
with the policies and procedures of the government and Asian Development Bank (ADB). The 
PAM includes references to all available templates and instructions either through linkages to 
relevant URLs or directly incorporated in the PAM. 
The  Provincial  People’s  Committees  (PPCs)  of  four  north  central  provinces1  which  are  the 
executing agencies (EAs), and their Provincial Departments of Planning and Investment (DPIs) 
which  are  the  implementing  agencies  (IAs)  or  project  owners  are  wholly  responsible  for  the 
implementation of ADB-financed projects, as agreed jointly between the borrower and ADB, and 
in  accordance  with  the  policies  and  procedures  of  the  government  and  ADB.  ADB  staff  is 
responsible  for  supporting  implementation  including  compliance  by  PPCs  and  DPIs  of  their 
obligations and responsibilities for project implementation in accordance with ADB’s policies and 
procedures. 
At loan negotiations, the borrower and ADB shall agree to the PAM and ensure consistency with 
the loan agreement. Such agreement shall be reflected in the minutes of the loan negotiations. 
In the event of any discrepancy or contradiction between the PAM and the loan agreement, the 
provisions of the loan agreement shall prevail. 
After ADB Board approval of the project's report and recommendations of the President (RRP), 
changes in implementation arrangements are subject to agreement and approval pursuant to 
relevant government and ADB administrative procedures (including the Project Administration 
Instructions) and upon such approval, they will be subsequently incorporated in the PAM.

I. 
PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
1. 
The project will improve service delivery in Ha Tinh, Nghe An, Quang Binh, and Quang Tri 
provinces, through which it will accelerate Socio-economic development of NCPs in accordance 
with  the  Provincial  Socio-economic  Development  Plans  through  2020,  with  a  vision  to  2030 
(Provincial SEDP) and the Master Plan on Socio-economic Development of Viet Nam’s Central 
Northern and Coastal Region through to 2020 (Master Plan). 
The proposed project will (i) rehabilitate and upgrade provincial road and district roads in 
2. 
the  four  north  central  provinces  (NCPs);  (ii)  support  productive  and  business  infrastructure 
including  water  supply  networks,  sea  and  river  protection  and  drainage works  with  associated 
river  transport  infrastructure,  and  supporting  flood  and  irrigation  command  areas;  and  (iii) 
establish  a  decentralized  public  asset  management  processes  for  road,  water  supply  and 
irrigation infrastructure.2 
3. 
Following  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)’s  sector  modality,  the  project  will  be 
implemented in approximately 32 subprojects for outputs 1 and 2. Feasibility studies (FS) have 
been prepared for the four representative subprojects – demonstrating subproject viability, and 
consequently  overall  project  feasibility.  Criteria  for  the  eligibility,  election,  prioritization  and 
preparation of additional subprojects have been agreed. A long list of additional subprojects has 
been identified, and the NCPs and ADB will carry out field screening to agree upon their inclusion 
in the project. 
Impact and Outcome 
4. 
The project is aligned to the following impact: socio-economic development of Ha Tinh, 
Nghe An, Quang Binh, and Quang Tri Provinces accelerated. The outcome will be service delivery 
in NCPs improved.  
Outputs 
5. 
Output  1:  Transport  infrastructure  improved  through  upgrading  and  constructing 
around 214 km of district roads, which will improve connectivity and transport access to more than 
900,000 beneficiaries. The roads will integrate rural productive or remote areas with the areas 
driving economic growth. Traffic calming measures, to reduce velocities at critical road sections, 
such  as  schools  and  hospitals,  will  be  included  in  road  design,  as  well  as safety  programs for 
vulnerable road users.  
6. 
Output 2: Productive infrastructure for business development improved will benefit 
340,000 people, by the construction, upgrading, rehabilitation or stabilizing with climate resilient 
measures  of  (i)  two  rural  domestic  water  supply  (RDWS)  schemes  that  will  provide  water  to 
households,  that  are  currently  consuming  ground  water  contaminated  with  naturally  occurring 
heavy metals; (ii) coastal defences to protect lives, public and private property, and businesses 
from  extreme  weather,  aggravated  by  climate  change,  by  upgrading  sea  and  river  defences, 
including  dykes,  embankments  and  canals;  (iii)  one  river  port  upgraded  to  enhance  fish 
processing  and  improve  tourism  logistics;  and  (iv)  a  reservoir  that  provides  irrigation  and 
agricultural  support  infrastructure  to  enhance  production  such  as  the  lining  of  canals  and 
improving rural access. 
2  ADB provided project preparatory technical assistance for preparing the Basic Infrastructure for Inclusive Growth in 
Northeast Provinces Sector Project (TA-8957-VIE). 
3 
Output 3: Decentralized public asset management processes established to support 
7. 
the implementation of the decentralized public asset management program which is one pillar of 
ADB’s support for the public finance management program. The four NCPs will select, procure 
and  operate  asset  management  systems  which  are  in  line  with  the  decentralized  public  asset 
management program for (i) roads; (ii) RDWS schemes; and (iii) irrigation. These processes will 
minimize  life  cycle  costs  and  enable  the  transition  to  efficient  operation  and  maintenance  of 
provincial  assets  and  include  indicators  and  tools  to  allow  monitoring  of  annual  maintenance 
budgets and their funding, and improve value for money decisions. 
Subprojects  
8. 
The  following  table  presents  the  number  of  candidate  subprojects  identified  during  the 
project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (PPTA).  Not  all  additional  subprojects  will  be 
implemented as not all will be found feasible. It is estimated that overall 24 subprojects will be 
implemented.

Subproject Implementation Procedures 
25. 
Subproject Implementation (see Annex 4 for a detailed breakout of all steps involved in 
the implementation of subprojects (both representative and additional) will include the following 
steps:  
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
(v) 
Preparation of subproject feasibility studies, including associated: (a) safeguards 
including IEEs, EMPs, REMDPs; (b) GAP; (c) preliminary engineering designs and 
supporting  bill  of  quantities  and  detailed  cost  estimates;  (d)  financial  (where 
required) and economic assessments. The subproject FSs will follow the example 
of the FSs of representative subproject(s) as agreed between the government and 
ADB; 
PMU conduct technical review and consultant updates; 
PMU/DPI submission of the FS for approval by PPCs; 
Implementation plan prepared; 
ADB conduct review of FS for ADB safeguard compliance, and adherence to the 
agreed upon FS structure;  
FS and supporting implementation plan submitted to PPC for approval;  
(vi) 
(vii)  Detailed designs contracted; 
(viii)  Preparation of DEDs; 
(ix) 
(x) 
(xi) 
(xii)  Commissioning, training and handover. 
Approval of Detailed Designs by PPC after technical review; 
Tendering for civil works;  
Construction, including technical and safeguard supervision and monitoring; and 
FS for additional subprojects will be prepared by the consultants recruited by the PMUs. 
26. 
They shall be responsible for the technical aspects of the FS including the economic and financial 
analysis, all social and safeguard issues and land acquisition assessments required for preparing 
the  IEEs  as  required  and  where  appropriate  RPs/REMDPs,  GAP,  and  Poverty  and  Social 
Assessments,  and  inclusion  of  road  safety  and  climate  resilient  measures  in  accordance  with 
government standard(s).   
27. 
This will ensure that appropriate measures to (i) build and strengthen the inclusiveness of 
subprojects, and (ii) to mitigate any negative social impacts including special measures for land 
acquisition, compensation, ethnic minorities specific actions if required, and special measures to 
improve the participation of women and other disadvantaged groups as beneficiaries are taken.  
21 
28. 
Each PMU upon completion of the FS that are not covered under PPTA or PPSSF, shall 
use the consultant services provided through the loan implementation consultant (LIC), recruited 
using counterpart funds by each province, to review the FS to ensure that: (i) appropriate technical 
standards  are  incorporated  in  the  design  and  that  the  costs  applied  reflect  realistic  market 
estimates;  and  (ii)  ADB’s  and  the  Government’s  social  and  environmental  safeguards 
requirements are duly addressed. Once reviewed, the PMU will inform the project owner - DPI of 
the feasibility's acceptance. DPI will then submit the FS to the PPC for approval. ADB will review 
all  FS  and  associated  documents.  ADB’s  comments  will  be  incorporated  for  safeguard 
compliance. Ultimate responsibility for FS compliance rests with each EA. 
29. 
All  additional  subproject  FS  for  plain,  rural  and  mountainous  roads  will  include  a  traffic 
forecast  derived  from  traffic  counts  of  baseline  traffic  demand.  The  traffic  forecasts  will  be 
presented  in the  summary  of  each  feasibility  study  for  the  economic  life  of  the  proposed road 
investment. The technical design standard for the road engineering must be consistent with the 
assessed  traffic  demand  -  specified  in  daily  PCU  terms  according  to  the  Viet  Nam  Design 
Specification TCVN 4054 – see table 4.   
30.  Where  the road  traffic forecast  spans  more  than one  PCU category  the  standard to  be 
applied will be based on the design category that is consistent with the traffic forecast at year 10 
of the projection.  Where the indicated design category differs from the Provincial master plan or 
the proposed subproject design standard indicated in the Government Investment Proposal (IP) 
the PMU/PPC will confirm the design standard to be used as the standard indicated by the traffic 
forecast under regulation TCVN 4054. 
31. 
The economic assessment of the subproject must utilize the same traffic forecast data to 
ensure  capital  investment  costs  are  consistent  with  the  expected  benefit  streams.  This 
requirement will remove bias of inflated EIRR estimates from the use of a higher traffic forecast, 
or alternately, applying a capital investment that is insufficient to construct the category of road 
required by the traffic forecast and the estimated project economic benefits.

33. 
All  additional  subproject  feasibility  studies for  city  and  urban roads  will  include  a  traffic 
forecast  derived  from  traffic  counts  of  baseline  traffic  demand.  The  traffic  forecasts  will  be 
presented  in the  summary  of  each  feasibility  study  for  the  economic  life  of  the  proposed road 
investment. The technical design standard for the road engineering must be consistent with the 
assessed  traffic  demand  -  specified  in  hourly  PCU  terms  according  to  the  Viet  Nam  Design 
Specification TCXDVN  2007 – see table 5.   
34.  Where  the road  traffic forecast  spans  more  than one PCU category  the  standard to  be 
applied will be based on the design category that is consistent with the traffic forecast at year 10 
of the projection.  Where the indicated design category differs from the Provincial master plan or 
the proposed subproject design standard indicated in the Government Investment Proposal (IP) 
the PMU/PPC will confirm the design standard to be used as the standard indicated by the traffic 
forecast under regulation TCXDVN  2007. 
35. 
The  economic  assessment  of  the  subproject  must  utilize  the  same traffic  forecast  data 
used  to  establish  the  design  construction  category  to  ensure  capital  investment  costs  are 
consistent with the expected benefit streams.  This requirement will remove bias from increasing 
benefits from the use of a higher traffic forecast, or alternately, applying a capital investment that 
is insufficient to construct the category of road required by the traffic forecast and the estimated 
project economic benefits.  
36. 
ADB will confirm with a formal note to file for each subproject feasibility study that the road 
subproject  feasibility  assessment  has  a  traffic  forecast  that  is  consistent  with  the  proposed 
construction design category, and the projected traffic benefits used in the economic assessment.  
37.  Where there is inconsistency the ADB will notify the PMU/DPI that the subproject feasibility 
is not accepted and the subproject is ineligible for ADB financing.

FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT 
Financial Management Assessment 
The overall financial management assessment (FMA) is presented in the context of ADB’s 
62. 
sector  modality  for  the  Project.  The  financial  assessment  uses  the  detail  of  representative 
subproject feasibility6 as well as the proposed financial structure and management of the overall 
project.  
63. 
The    main financial  management  risks  that  need  to  be  managed  by  the  EAs,  IAs,  and 
PMUs  are:  (i)  implementation  risk  -  lack  of  familiarity  with  ADB  sector  project  subproject 
processing  procedures,  delayed  feasibility  and  subproject  preparation  leading  to  potential 
eligibility  and cost escalation  issues,  weak  understanding and  adherence to  ADB  procurement 
procedures,  unfamiliar  and  weak  skills  set relating  to financial  management  and disbursement 
procedures and requirements leading to prolonged project implementation, project management 
unit incentives to prolong implementation to maintain the PMU as an institution outside the usual 
sector  structures,    (ii)  compliance  risk  -  lack  of  familiarity  with  ADB  financial  management 
requirements,  particularly  on  accounting,  reporting  and  auditing,  which  may  delay  project 
reporting and derail identification of issues on the use of loan proceeds, (iii) financing risk – some 
EAs have indicated relatively higher levels of counterpart funds without clear implementation cost 
structures that may delay approvals for counterpart fund amounts and the subsequent transfer of 
counterpart funds to the PMU, a lack of awareness of the cash flow of counterpart funds which 
are  required  proportionately  more  during  the  first  two  years  of  implementation  for  project 
implementation, and (iv) operational risk - inadequate experience in the range of subprojects to 
be implemented that will impact project progress, an acceptance of lower quality standards as 
price escalation is experienced in order to maintain optimistic physical targets,  limited ability to 
maintain project assets after project completion. 
The  identified  financial  management  risks  to  be  closely  monitored  during  project

deployment in appropriate financial management positions and that all of these position will be 
assigned  full  time to  PMU  roles  with  a  written  confirmation  that  the  staff member  is  no  longer 
allowed to undertake DPI or EA based tasks; (iii) ensuring each PMUs have access to English 
language  support  that  is  capable  of  interpretation,  and  translation  of  technical  writing  into  the 
standard required for submission documents; (iv) developing methodologies for managing cost 
escalation risks; (v) the need to monitor the risk of lags in foreign exchange movement that erode 
forecast  currency  devaluation  under  public-private  partnership  (PPP)  cost  estimation 
assumptions resulting financing shortfalls; and (vi) of undertaking more training, particularly on 
ADB  policy  and  procedures  so  that  the  EAs  and  IAs  will  have  adequate  administrative  and 
accounting capacity to prepare and maintain proper SOE records and make them readily available 
for examination. 
Risk Analysis 
66. 
The  risk  assessment  considered  the  staffing,  internal  control,  accounting  and reporting 
policies and procedures, and auditing standards and arrangements of the EA and IAs. The overall 
financial management risk-rating of the project before considering mitigating measures is high. 
1.  
Inherent Risk 
67. 
Inherent  risk  is  the  susceptibility  of the  project financial  management  system  to factors 
arising  from  the  environment  in  which  it  operates,  such  as  country  rules  and  regulations  and 
project management entities and the political economy of their working environment.

2.  
Control Risk 
68. 
Control  risk  is  the  risk  that  the  project’s  accounting  and  internal  control  framework  are 
inadequate to ensure project funds are used appropriately and efficiently for the purpose intended, 
and that the use of funds is properly recorded and reported with supporting documentation.

Project financial management policies and procedures are

however the relationship of these to the PMUs remains 
unproven.  
Staffing of the PMU financial management team needs to 
be clearly identified as full time roles with staff only 
engaged in BIIG activities and with advanced academic 
and professional experience 
Each of the project IAs will adopt the accepted accounting 
principles as specified by the Ministry of Finance. The IA 
PMUs will set up a separate project accounting system

ADB loans are on-lent to each EA. Each EA will repay the 
portion made available to it through budget allocation whilst 
the State will repay the portion made available to the EAs 
under respective on-lending agreements. The EAs will 
assume the foreign exchange and interest rate variation 
risks. The concessional loan will have a repayment period 
of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years while the 
ordinary loan will have a repayment period of 25 years, 
including a grace period of 6 years. Each PMU will open its 
own advance accounts to manage the loan proceeds in line 
with the requirements in the Loan Agreement. Timely 
release of loan proceeds to each province will be required 
through loan covenant. 
The required quantum of CF required in the first 2 years is 
significant and if these are delayed or constrained the 
subproject DED and subsequent works contracts will be 
delayed resulting in (i) significant price escalation, (ii) 
reduced availability of financing leading to either fewer 
subprojects or lower quality works. 
The necessity for provinces to avoid budget deficits any 
provincial level deficit will result in delayed availability or 
release of approved counterpart funds causing additional 
delays. 
PMU staffing is a mix of existing government civil servants 
with lifetime employment and adequately qualified and 
contracted staff positions that are yet to be filled. No 
province has experience in acting as a loan EA and 
therefore lack previous experience in financial 
management, familiarity with ADB loan management 
policies and procedures/ procedures and training on ADB 
loan management policies and procedures including 
procurement, disbursement and repayment policy need to 
be provided to enhance the professional capacity of 
relevant staff before implementing the project. Contracted 
staff and implementation support consultant are included in 
the design along with DPI and PMU participation in ADB in-
country training and awareness programs prior to loan 
effectiveness 
All IAs have internal audit training and undergo an internal 
audit annual, however these fail to meet international 
standards. The Project will be included in all internal audit 
procedures and reporting

provide an additional control point to ensure data is

The EA and IAs will use stand-alone computerized 
accounting systems which produce financial statements 
automatically. Further each PMU will have a work planning 
and budgeting system based on ADBs (VRM) Project 
administration work books that links to the annual budget, 
disbursement and physical completion records to form the 
basis of the PPMS

Addressing the issues raised in the risk evaluation, the level of training and understanding 
required  within  the  project  implementation  process  was  identified  as  varying  by  province.  The 
exact extent required is difficult to determine when not all PMUs are in place and the respective 
staff  not  engaged.  An  initial  part  of  capacity  building  under  the  project  is  a  Training  Needs 
Assessment (TNA) from which a training plan could be developed. The TNA would be directed at 
DOF and PMUs as well as for recipient line ministries. The initial training and capacity building 
plan is presented in Table 48 below and needs to be financed from local counterpart funds under 
Decree 16 provisions.

The GOV is the borrower of the ADB loan for financing the Basic Infrastructure for Inclusive 
70. 
Growth  in  the  North  Central  Provinces  Sector  Project.  On  behalf  of  the  borrower,  Ministry  of 
Finance  (MOF)  will  relend  a  portion  of  the  proceeds  of  the  ADB  loans7  to  the  four  Executing 
Agencies being Ha Tinh PPC, Nghe An PPC, Quang Binh PPC, and Quang Tri PPC while the 
balance will be made available to the EAs through budget allocation. The repayment period of the 
COL loan is 25 years including a grace period of 5 years while the repayment period of the OCR 
loan  is  25  years  including  a  grace  period  of  6  years.  Repayment  of  on-lent  funds  will  be 
undertaken within domestic procedures and agreements with the Government of Viet Nam solely 
responsible for the repayments to ADB. 
71. 
Each  Project  Management  Unit  will  open  two  advance  accounts  to  manage  the  loan 
proceeds in line with the requirements in the Loan Agreement. No subaccounts are necessary. 
Reimbursement of expenses will involve each PMU/IA submitting its own withdrawal applications 
and supporting documentation direct to ADB. 
Counterpart  funding  will  be  the  sole  responsibility  of  each  Provincial  PPC  and  will  be

are available during implementation. It is expected that staff will need training to familiarize with 
ADB project-related disbursement guidelines and procedures, project accounting requirements, 
project  and  contract  management,  financial  monitoring  and  report  preparation.  Additionally, 
somebody with English capability will be needed to support the finance teams, especially at the 
early  stage  of  project  implementation  and  with  capacity  to  provide  technical  translation  to  a 
standard for ADB document submission. Current expertise in English for some provinces while 
sufficient for oral translation needs further strengthening so that possible delays to procurement 
and contracting procedures are to be avoided. 
74. 
Key risks relate to the timing of the formation of the final PMUs and the subsequent staffing 
of these. The PMUs can legally be formed up to 30 days after loan signing with individual staff 
position filled by this time. Currently, (i) positions within the PMU are proposed only, (ii) positions 
within the proposed PMU are indicated to be either seconded DPI staff or contracted positions 
however  this  may  change  on  the  formal  establishment  of  the  PMUs,  iii)  the  individuals  to  fill 
positions are unknown and as such the capability of staff is largely unknowable, (iv) the EAs and 
Project Owners may choose to modify the structures and also the nature of each position resulting 
in fewer full time contracted positions that are substituted for part time DPI seconded staff. The 
experience in Viet Nam PMU operation is that without full time staff PMU and project performance 
is significantly and adversely affected.

disbursement and fiduciary control. 
76. 
Advance  fund  procedure.  8  advance  accounts  (2  for  each  EA)  will  be  established  at 
commercial banks nominated by SBV and acceptable to ADB  and maintained by each Project 
Owner as assigned by each PPC (EA). The Project Owner (IA) will be the DPI who will form a 
PMU  that  will  in  turn  establish  the  Provincial  Advance  account.  The  currency  of  the  advance 
accounts  is  USD.  Each  advance  account  is  to  be  used  exclusively  for  ADB’s  share  of  eligible 
expenditures  with  COL  and  OCR  loan  resources  being  managed  in  separate  accounts.  The 
Project  Owner  on  behalf  of  the  PPC  that  established  the  advance  account  in  its  name  is 
accountable and responsible for proper use of advances to the advance account.   
77. 
The total outstanding advance to the advance accounts should not exceed the estimate 
of  ADB’s  share  of  expenditures  to  be  paid  through  the  respective  advance  account  for  the 
forthcoming 6 months. The DPI/PMU on behalf of the PPC may request for initial and additional 
advances to the advance accounts based on an Estimate of Expenditure Sheet setting out the 
estimated  expenditures  to  be  financed  through  the  accounts  for  the  forthcoming  6  months.9 
Supporting documents should be submitted to ADB or retained by the PPC and their delegated 
Project Owner (IA) in accordance with ADB’s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended 
from time to time) when liquidating or replenishing the advance accounts.

this amount should be paid (i) by the Project Owner being the respective DPI and subsequently 
claimed  to  ADB  through  reimbursement,  or  (ii)  through  the  advance  fund  procedure,  unless 
otherwise accepted by ADB. 
80. 
No withdrawals shall be made from the Loan Account for any province until the respective 
Subsidiary Loan Agreement, in form and substance satisfactory to ADB, has been duly authorized 
by, and executed and delivered on behalf of, the Borrower (or its authorized government entity) 
and the concerned Project Province, and is legally binding upon the parties thereto in accordance 
with its terms.11\.  
Accounting Policies and Financial Reporting 
81. 
Each IAs/PMU will adopt accounting methods required by MOF to establish a separate 
set of project accounts and records by funding source for all expenditures incurred on the project. 
Subsidiary ledgers will be maintained to facilitate reconciliation of accounts with the general ledger 
and  bank records.  All reports  and  supporting  documents  on  all  transactions  will  be  stored  and 
retained on a semi-permanent basis and will be accessible by authorized users, and are available 
for audit inspection. The IA will prepare individual project financial statements and submit to the 
EA for monitoring and each EA will submit their accounting records to the ADB via the Project 
Coordination Unit in Quang Tri for consolidation and reporting. 
The EAs through the IAs/PMUs will maintain, or cause to be maintained, separate books 
82. 
and records by funding source for all expenditures incurred on the project. Annual project financial 
statements will be prepared following modified cash-based accounting system in accordance with 
the  government's  accounting  laws  and  regulations,  specifically  Circular  No.195/2012/TT-BTC 
under the Vietnamese Accounting Standards (VAS). 
Financial reporting follows the recent State Budget Law12 which covers the responsibilities 
83. 
including the duties of state agencies, revenue sources and spending authority, preparation of 
budget  estimates,  and  on  budgetary  execution,  along  with  details  on  accounting,  auditing  and 
disclosure requirements.  
Budgeting System 
84. 
The financial departments of EA and IAs are responsible for summarizing the preliminary 
budgets and make an overall annual budget for approval by the Project Owner on behalf of the 
10  SOE forms are available in Appendix 7B, ADB’s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to 
time). 
11 Disbursement conditions for specific category/subcategory are set out in the Loan Agreement. 
12 State Budget Law Decision No. 224/QD-BTC, dated January 30, 2013. 
69 
EA (the respective PPC). 
85. 
Detailed  project  budgets  will  be  formulated  by  each  PMU  under  the  oversight  of  the 
financial  management  team,  with  input  from  the  procurement  expert,  technical  staff  with  input 
from  relevant  departments  but the  accounting staff  needs to make  sure the  costs  are  incurred 
within budget. The project budgets will be prepared annually by each IA and their PMU based on 
the work planning templates provided in the PAM and will include physical and financial targets. 
Prior  to  loan  effectiveness  -  a  whole  of  life  project  work  plan  will  be  prepared  with  a 
86. 
supporting budget by project output, subproject, expenditure items, and disbursement category. 
This  work  plan  and  supporting  budget  will  be  continually  applied  for  ongoing  planning  and 
reporting  by  the  PMU  and  monitoring  by  each  IA.  Budget  monitoring  reports  will  present  a 
comparison  between  budgeted  and  actual  amounts,  and  highlight  budget  variances  with  each 
PMU  Project  Director  responsible  for  identifying  and  auctioning  remedial  actions  to  recover  or 
reschedule  activities  that  are  delayed  or  incomplete.  The  Project  Coordination  Unit  within  the 
Quang  Tri  Province  PMU  will  provide  the  consolidation  of  planning,  budgeting  and  progress 
records across all four EAs and report this to ADB. 
 Safeguard of Assets 
Subsidiary records of fixed assets and stocks are currently considered to be well managed 
87. 
and kept up-to-date and reconciled with control accounts of the IA periodically. The EA and IAs 
will conduct annual physical inventory of all project assets and all subproject assets will remain 
on the PMU registry until formally handed over to asset managers on completion with supporting 
documentation  that  will  be  included  in  the  scope  of  the  external  audit  and  in  Project  progress 
reports where assets, receiving entity and date of transfer will be recorded. During construction / 
installation  insurance  shall  be  the  responsibility  of  contractors  and  shall  cover  worker 
compensation for losses due to accidents apart from compensation for property.  
Auditing and Public Disclosure 
88. 
Each  of  the  PPCs  through  the  DPI/PMUs  will  cause  the  detailed  project  financial 
statements  to  be  audited  in  accordance  with  International  Standards  on  Auditing  by  an 
independent auditor acceptable to ADB. The audited project financial statements together with 
the auditor’s opinion and management letter will be presented in the English language to ADB 
within 6 months from the end of the fiscal year by PPCs through the DPI/PMUs.  
89. 
The audit report for the project financial statements will include a management letter and 
auditor’s opinions, which cover (i) whether the project financial statements present an accurate 
and fair view or are presented fairly, in all material respects, in accordance with the applicable 
financial  reporting  standards;  (ii)  whether  the  proceeds  of  the  loan  were  used  only  for  the 
purpose(s) of the project; and (iii) whether the borrower or executing agency was in compliance 
with the financial covenants contained in the legal agreements (where applicable). 
Compliance with financial reporting and auditing requirements will be monitored by review 
90. 
missions and during normal program supervision, and followed up regularly with all concerned, 
including the external auditor.  
The  government,  the  PPCs  and  DPI/PMU’s  are  aware  of  ADB’s  approach  to  delayed 
91. 
submission, and the requirements for satisfactory and acceptable quality of the audited project 
70 
financial  statements.13  ADB  reserves the right to  require  a change in the auditor  (in a manner 
consistent with the constitution of the borrower), or for additional support to be provided to the 
auditor, if the audits required are not conducted in a manner satisfactory to ADB, or if the audits 
are  substantially  delayed.  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  verify  the  project's  financial  accounts  to 
confirm  that  the  share  of  ADB’s  financing  is  used  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  policies  and 
procedures.  
92. 
Public disclosure of the audited project financial statements, including the auditor’s opinion 
on the project financial statements, will be guided by ADB’s Public Communications Policy 2011.14  
After the review, ADB will disclose the audited project financial statements and the opinion of the 
auditors on the project financial statements no later than 14 days of ADB’s confirmation of their 
acceptability  by  posting  them  on  ADB’s  website.  The  management  letter,  additional  auditor’s 
opinions, and audited entity financial statements will not be disclosed.15 
Reporting and Monitoring 
The  project  financial  reports  will  be  prepared  using  existing  Public  Sector  budget 
93. 
accounting software systems and are submitted on a monthly, quarterly and annual basis. The 
reports  will  highlight  the  physical  and  financial  progress  of  projects  being  undertaken  in 
comparison  with  the  proposed  annual  work  plan  and  budgets  established  prior  to  end  of  the 
previous  year.  Reports  will  be  produced  for  each  subproject,  each  IA/EA  and  for  the  overall 
project.  During project implementation, financial reports will be prepared and submitted to  the 
DPI and the PPC of each province and to ADB as quarterly progress reports for individual outputs. 
The financial report will be used for monitoring progress of project implementation and compare 
actual  expenditure  with  budgeted  and  programmed  allocations.  The  Project  Coordination  Unit 
Quang Tri will consolidate each EA reports into a project level report, however it should be noted 
to avoid cash flow  constraints  and delays  each EA  will  submit  their financial  and procurement 
approval requests and their financial withdrawal applications direct to ADB with the record of these 
shared  with  the  coordination  unit.  As  such,  the  coordination  unit  will  not  be  involved  with  the 
presentation of procurement approvals, or withdrawal applications. 
Information Systems 
94. 
A computerized accounting system will be used by each PMU for the accounting records, 
payment financial statement including balance sheet, income statement and cash flow statement. 
The financial reports are generated by the computer system rather than by manual. The financial 
data  and  the  operational  information  have  not  been  inter-connected  in  the  system,  and 
reconciliations are realized by regular manual checks. 
13 ADB’s approach and procedures regarding delayed submission of audited project financial statements:  
(i)  When audited project financial statements are not received by the due date, ADB will write to the executing 
agency advising that (a) the audit documents are overdue; and (b) if they are not received within the next 6 
months, requests for new contract awards and disbursement such as new replenishment of advance accounts, 
processing of new reimbursement, and issuance of new commitment letters will not be processed. 
(ii)  When  audited  project  financial  statements  are  not  received  within  6  months  after  the  due  date,  ADB  will 
withhold processing of requests for new contract awards and  disbursement such as new replenishment of 
advance accounts, processing of new reimbursement and issuance of new commitment letters. ADB will (a) 
inform the executing agency of ADB’s actions; and (b) advise that the loan may be suspended if the audit 
documents are not received within the next 6 months. 
(iii)  When audited project financial statements  are not received within 12 months after the due date, ADB may 
suspend the loan.

95. 
A key source of information will be the ADB VRM project administration workbooks that 
provide  subproject  and  overall  project  level  work  plans,  budgets,  cash  flow  timelines,  contract 
award schedules and disbursement projections. The workbooks will form the basis of a Provincial 
level PPMS that will interface with the project accounting systems to report physical and financial 
progress against agreed quarterly reporting indicators. 
96. 
Existing accounting software systems of the EAs and IAs are sufficient for supporting the 
project  information  system  and  for  generating  project  reports  required  for  both  external  and 
internal  use.  In  addition,  all  current  staff  in  the  IAs  are  familiar  with  these  systems,  although 
supplementary training in reporting requirements for the ADB financed project will be provided. 
Systems and procedures for regular back-ups of all accounting systems and appropriate security 
measures over backed-up data are in place.

capacities.  It  illustrates  that  skills  in  the general financial management  practices such  as book 
keeping, statutory reporting, and project budgeting and costing are sufficiently acquired. They are 
good  at  the  computerized  accounting  system  and  payment  processing,  project  budgeting  and 
costing.  Internal  auditing,  project  modelling  and  evaluation,  management  accounting  and 
reporting need some enhancement at average.

PROCUREMENT AND CONSULTING SERVICES 
Advance Contracting 
All advance contracting will be undertaken in conformity with ADB Procurement Guidelines 
98. 
(2015, as amended from time to time) and ADB’s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as 
amended from time to time). The issuance of invitations to bid under advance contracting will be 
subject to ADB approval. The borrower, the four NCP PPC’s, and DPI/PMU’s have been advised 
that approval of advance contracting does not commit ADB to finance the project. 
99. 
Advance actions include (i) the ranking of consultants’ proposals prior to loan signing; (ii) 
recruitment of loan implementation consultants, (iii) preparation of detailed design including terms 
of reference, request for proposals, expression of interest, for DED consulting services; and (iv) 
formation of a procurement evaluation committee to evaluate proposals; and (v) contract signing 
after loan signing.  
Procurement of Goods, Works, and Consulting Services 
100.  All procurement of goods and works financed by ADB loan proceeds will be undertaken in 
accordance with ADB’s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time). Those 
contracts procured using National Competitive Bidding (NCB) will follow the national procurement 
laws, subject to the modifications described in the NCB Annex attached to the Procurement Plan. 
Procurement  of  goods  will  use  International  Competitive  Bidding  (ICB)  procedures  if  over  $2 
million,  NCB  if  $2  million  or  less,  shopping  if  less  than  $100,000.  Civil  works  will  use  ICB 
procedures if over $10 million with exceptions,16,NCB if $10 million or less, shopping if less than 
$100,000.  
101.  Before  the  start  of  any  procurement,  ADB  and  the  government  will  review  the  public 
procurement  laws  of  the  central  and  state  governments  to  ensure  consistency  with  ADB’s 
Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time).  
102.  All consultants financed by ADB loan proceeds will be recruited in accordance with ADB’s 
Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).17  The  terms  of 
reference for all consulting services are detailed in Section D. 
103.  Construction  supervision  contracts  –  one  per  EA,  will  comprise  national  input  for  road, 
structures,  bridge  and  water  supply  engineering  inputs.  The  four  packages  will  be  contracted 
using Quality and Cost-Based Selection (QCBS). 
104.  Project  audit  service  contracts  –  one  per  EA,  will  be  recruited  as  a  single  package  by 
Quang Tri PMU on behalf of other three provinces. The package will be contracted using Fixed 
Budget Selection (FBS).

Environment 
VII. 
SAFEGUARDS 
107.  The  overall  project  is  classified  as  Category  B  for  environment  and  all  subproject  are 
required to be category B or below. The project has an environmental assessment and review 
framework  (EARF).  Initial  environment  examinations  including  environmental  management 
plans  (EMP)  have  been  prepared  for  the  representative  subprojects  and  will  be  updated  and 
approved by ADB to reflect any changes in the subproject during DED. These documents will be 
uploaded onto the ADB website before ADB staff review meeting (SRM). 
108.  The processing of additional subprojects will include an initial environmental examination 
during the feasibility  stage  to  be  contracted  and  completed  by  the  EAs and IAs. These  will  be 
guided  by  the  EARF  and  are  expected  to  be  completed  prior  to  loan  signing  and  or  loan 
effectiveness. Further the detailed engineering design consultant will also be required to provide 
environmental safeguard input to the design process. The approved EMP will be integrated in the 
bidding and civil work contracts. Site EMP in detailing mitigation measure implementation in each 
construction package will be prepared by respective contractor and submitted to PMU for review. 
Each Province has committed counterpart funding for the implementation of the environmental 
safeguards identified for the representative subprojects and indicative budgets for the additional 
subprojects.  
109.  Each  PMU  will  have  an  environmental  safeguards  staff/focal  point  who  will  also  be 
assisted  by  an  environmental  safeguards  consultant  who  is  part  time  within  the  loan 
implementation  consultant  team.  Further  the  DED  consultants  will  also  be  required  to  provide 
environmental safeguard input to the design process. The PMU environment safeguards staff will 
work closely with environment consultants that form part of the successful  DED team, and the 
environmental  consultant  in  the  loan  implementation  consultant  team,  as  well  construction 
supervision  consultants  for  supporting  each  PMU  to  assess,  monitor  and  supervise  the  EMP 
implementation,  and  ensure  environment  compliance 
in  each  subproject.  Semi-annual 
environment monitoring report, during construction phase, will be prepared and submitted by PMU 
to ADB for review and uploading on ADB’s website. 
Involuntary Resettlement 
110.  The  overall  project  is  classified  as  Category  B  for  involuntary  resettlement.  The 
developments  and  improvements  under  the  subprojects  will  not  trigger  major  resettlement 
impacts because most of the infrastructure will be improved within existing right of ways (ROWs). 
An assessment and full census of impacted households along the length of the subproject ROW 
was conducted, based on the center-line and preliminary designs for the representative roads, 
and a resettlement framework and resettlement plans were prepared in accordance with national 
legal requirements and ADB’s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). 
111.  There  were  no  subprojects  with significant  involuntary resettlement  (IR Cat  A)  impacts. 
Primary  points  of  concern  will  be  minor  land  acquisition  and  compensation  for  roadside  trees, 
crops, or small structures that may be affected within the ROW. The PPCs and ADB have agreed 
on a combined resettlement and ethnic minorities development framework (REMDF). Minor 
land acquisition, compensation, allowances, operation and administration, surveys, monitoring, 
and reporting will be financed from government counterpart funds. The internal monitor will ensure 
that  the  resettlement  process  and  impacts  is  evaluated  properly  and  reported  to  ADB  semi-
annually through the EAs. 
76 
112.  Public consultation and information disclosure was undertaken during the preparation of 
resettlement and ethnic minorities development plans (REMDP), including affected persons 
and the public associated with the representative subprojects. The consultation and information-
sharing process will be continued throughout project implementation. The main features of the 
resettlement  concerns-project  impacts,  asset  valuation,  entitlements,  and  compensation 
provisions-were disclosed to project-affected people during consultative meetings. 
113.  The REMDF has been prepared and will be implemented by the PMUs’ who have a social 
and resettlement staff positions for social safeguard. For the processing of subprojects both the 
FS and detailed designs will be supported by the requirement from REMDP and social safeguard 
input to the detailed design processes. Additional budgets have been included in the Government 
counterpart contribution for the implementation of the Gender Action Plan and the requirements 
of the REMDF.  
114.  For the representative subprojects (3 road, and 1 water supply) the following has been 
prepared: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
(v) 
(vi) 
Engineering preliminary designs established the center lines and right of way for 
all  roads and the  alignment  of  all  intakes,  pumping and treatment  stations  and 
distribution network for the water supply schemes 
Based on the engineering survey and cadastral data surveys were conducted to 
enable the quantification of resettlement impacts and baseline data for the draft 
REMDPs.  They  include  the  inventory  of  losses  (IOL)  to  estimate  resettlement 
impacts  and  a  socioeconomic  survey  to  assess  pre-project  living  standards  of 
affected households as well as likely social impacts resulting from land acquisition 
on them; 
Public consultations with stakeholders comprising of government entities, private 
sector interests and affected households. Meaningful consultations will continue 
during the updating and implementation of the REMDPs during and on completion 
of the detailed designs and their approval. The draft and updated REMDPs have 
been  disclosed  to  affected  households  and  their  communities  based  on  the 
preliminary feasibility design documents; 
The  final  REMDPs  for  all  representative  subprojects  will  be  disclosed  prior  to 
project approval of the detailed designs. The fundamental objective of the project 
resettlement  policy  is  to  replace  and  compensate  lost  assets  based  on  the 
principle of replacement cost. Compensation and various forms of assistance will 
be  provided.  Once  land acquisition  is  completed,  income restoration  measures 
will be implemented in a way that will ensure that standards of living of the project 
affected persons are at least restored to their pre-project levels, and that those in 
the  category  of  vulnerable  groups  (i.e.,  poor  households.)  are  assisted  to  help 
improve their socioeconomic status; 
The REMDPs will be updated upon loan effectiveness, endorsed by the EAs and 
submitted  to  the  ADB  for  review  and  concurrence.  The  updated  REMDPs  will 
require  further  detailed  studies  (including  detailed  measurement  survey  and 
replacement  cost  survey)  and  additional  consultation.  Principal  aspects  to  be 
updated  in  the  REMDPs  are  resettlement  impacts  based  on  DMS;  census  of 
affected  people;  entitlement  matrix;  and  replacement  costs  and  details  of 
consultations and disclosure; and 
The  PMUs,  LAR  Board  at  district  level,  and/or  Center  for  Land  Fund 
relevant  mass  organizations 
Development, 
the  wards/communes,  and 
(particularly the Vietnam Women’s Union (WUs)) will have primary responsibility 
for  the  updating  and  implementation  of  the  REMDPs  with  the  support  of  the 
consultant. As such the capacity of these bodies is of critical importance and the 
project  must  ensure  appropriate  capacity  building  assistance  in  the  form  of 
information, training, and consultation and mentoring. 
77 
115.  The EAs/IAs and the PMUs will ensure that any involuntary resettlement is carried out in 
accordance  with  the  agreed  REMDPs,  ADB’s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  and  the 
Vietnamese laws and regulations on involuntary resettlement. In case of discrepancies between 
the  government’s  laws,  regulations,  and  procedures,  and  ADB’s  Safeguards  Policy  Statement 
(2009), ADB’ Safeguards Policy Statement will apply. 
116.  The EAs/IAs and the PMUs will ensure that the REMDPs agreed between the EAs and 
ADB will be updated following completion of detailed designs based on detailed measurement 
survey;  census  of  affected  people;  entitlement  matrix;  replacement  costs  and  details  of 
consultations and will be submitted to ADB for review and concurrence before awarding bid of 
civil works. 
117.  The EA will engage the services of a qualified appraiser to carry out the replacement cost 
survey for land and non-land assets, and submit the replacement cost survey report to the PPCs 
and PMUs for review and approval. 
118.  The  PMUs  and  LAR  Board  at  district  level  the  wards/communes  and  relevant  mass 
organizations  (particularly  the  WUs)  will  have  primary  responsibility  for  the  updating  and 
implementation of the REMDPs with the support of the Loan Implementation Consultant.  
119.  The  EAs/IAS  and the  PMUs  shall  ensure  that  a  site  possession  notice to  a  civil  works 
contract  to  commence construction  activities for a specific  section  or  subproject  is  issued  only 
when the resettlement specialist of the PMU has officially confirmed in writing that (i) payment 
has been fully disbursed to the displaced persons and rehabilitation measures are in place for 
that  specific  section  as  per  updated  REMDPs  agreed  between  the  EAs  and  ADB;  (ii)  already 
compensated APs for that specific section have been cleared the area in a timely manner; and 
(iii) that the specific section is free from any encumbrances. 
120.  The  EAs  shall  timely  and  sufficiently  provide  counterpart  funds  for  land  acquisition, 
resettlement  and  monitoring  activities  specified  in  the  agreed  REMDPs,  and  will  meet  any 
unforeseen obligations more than the REMDPs budget estimate to satisfy resettlement objectives. 
121.  PMUs are responsible for internal monitoring with assistance from the loan implementation 
consultants. PMUs will submit semi-annual internal monitoring reports to ADB. Final monitoring 
and  evaluation  need  to  be  conducted  after  completion  of  all  land  acquisition  activities  every  6 
months to assess (i) achievement of land acquisition objectives; (ii) changes in living standards 
and  livelihoods;  (iii)  restoration  of  the  economic  and  social  base  of  the  affected  people;  (iv) 
effectiveness and sustainability of entitlements; and (v) the need for further support as required. 
Findings monitoring reports will be submitted to ADB and PMU. External resettlement agency is 
not required for this project because of insignificant impact on land acquisition. 
Indigenous peoples 
122.  ADB’s  Indigenous  People’s  policy  requires that  under  an  ADB  loan, the  borrower/client 
will undertake meaningful consultation with affected Indigenous Peoples, herein referred to in the 
78 
Vietnamese context as “Ethnic Minorities” to ensure their informed participation in (i) designing, 
implementing, and monitoring measures to avoid adverse impacts on them or, when avoidance 
is not possible, to minimize, mitigate, and compensate for such effects; and (ii) tailoring project 
benefits that accrue to them in a culturally appropriate manner. Consultation will be carried out in 
a  manner  commensurate  with  the  impacts  on  affected  communities.  The  consultation  process 
and its results are documented and reflected in the REMDF. 
123.  The overall project is classified as Category B for Ethnic Minorities and all representative 
and additional subprojects must be Category B. Since in many cases ethnic minorities form the 
overwhelming  majority  of  the  population  of  road  subproject  areas  and  since  the  project  is 
designed to  provide  positive  impacts  for  these  groups,  measures  to  mitigate  negative  impacts 
have been incorporated in the subproject REMDPs and the procedures within the REMDF that 
the PMUs apply in the processing of additional subprojects. 
124. 
Impacts  on  ethnic  minorities  in  the  project  areas  are  overwhelmingly  positive  since  the 
subprojects will be aimed at the overall economic and social improvement of the total population. 
The  project  will  not  cause  physical  displacement  from  traditional  or  customary  lands,  nor 
negatively  impact  the  identity,  culture,  or  customary  livelihood  system  of  ethnic  minorities. 
REMDPs will ensure the inclusion of ethnic minorities and their access to project benefits. The 
REMDP  also  includes  mitigation  measures  to  address  impacts  on  ethnic  minorities,  an 
institutional  capacity  development  program,  a  grievance  redress  mechanism,  and  compliance 
with ADB information disclosure and consultation requirements. 
Internal monitoring and progress reporting will be the responsibility of the PMUs. At the 
125. 
local level, the CISB will provide support for monitoring on a regular basis. 
126.  Prohibited  investment  activities.  Pursuant  to  ADB’s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement 
(2009),  ADB  funds  may  not  be  applied  to  the  activities  described  on  the  ADB  Prohibited 
Investment Activities List set forth at Appendix 5 of the Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). 
Road Safety Dimensions 
Road Safety Objectives and Strategy 
127.  The improvements in subproject roads to a smoother riding road quality, may encourage 
higher speeds, that may in turn increase rate and severity of crashes on these roads. In some 
rural areas, the paved roads may also change the road environment, as all vulnerable road users 
feel less safe with increased traffic speeds. For all subprojects, road safety assessments in line 
with government procedures will be made to minimize rate/severity of crashes over the long-term 
and to demonstrate good practice road safety interventions to the PMU. 
Road Safety Action Plan (RSAP) 
128.  Experts  from  ADB  technical  assistance  program  will  provide  the  following  support  to 
improve road safety related to the Output 1 subproject investments: 
(i) 
will hold training sessions in each of the four NCPs on incorporating road safety 
measures into subproject DEDs, including how to cost such measures. The trainees will 
include PMU road staff and local design consultants; 
(ii) 
upon request will review road subproject DEDs. 
129.  The PMUs will work with the Provincial and District Road Safety Committees and related 
entities  at  the  Commune  levels  to  coordinate  and  implement  associated  capacity  building 
activities and to raise local awareness of road safety issues due to road improvements in  their 
communities.  Implementation  of  the  RSAP  will  be  overseen  by  the  PMUs.  Budget  for  all  non-
engineering road safety activities will be through counterpart funding. 
130.  All roads will at a minimum have appropriate traffic calming and control measures at all 
schools  and  kindergartens,  health  clinics  and  hospitals,  market  and  high  intensity  traffic  areas 
and administrative centres.

VIII.  GENDER AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS 
Gender Objectives and Strategy 
131.  The project is classified as Effective Gender Mainstreaming (EGM). The objective of the 
GAP is to reduce inequalities between women and men associated with access to benefits and 
opportunities and social risks such as exposure to disease and road safety. A gender analysis 
revealed that women have fewer opportunities than men to participate in public decision making, 
and less access to information, training, and employment, especially during the low agricultural 
season. The agricultural value chain subprojects and enterprise values subprojects, are likely to 
enable women to participate and benefit in the improved economic opportunities associated with 
agriculture value chains and the road connections to markets. The design features of the GAP 
are (i) promotion of equality of project benefits and opportunity-sharing between men and women; 
(ii) reduction in gender inequalities and social risks such as HIV/AIDs transmission prevention, 
human trafficking prevention and road safety; (iii) training of women, including those from ethnic 
minorities on technical topics, including tourism service deliveries; (iv) increased representation 
of  women  in  decision-making  bodies  and  (v)  collection  of  sex-disaggregated  data  for  benefit 
monitoring and evaluation. 
132.  A  Gender  Action  Plan  has  been  developed  that  will  also  be  applied  at  the  subproject 
implementation  level  and  will  be  the  responsibility  of  the  gender  focal  point  in  the  PMU  with 
support from a gender consultant in the loan implementation consultant team. 
Budget and Implementation Arrangements 
133.  The GAP implementation budget is estimated [Financing Table] for operational costs plus 
the input from the gender LIC consultants. The four Provincial People's Committees (PPCs) will 
be the EAs and their Departments of Planning and Investment (DPIs) as project owners will be 
the  implementing  agencies  (IAs)  responsible  for  implementing  and  monitoring  the  GAP  with 
support  from  the  safeguards  social/gender  specialist.  The  PMUs  will  (i)  assign  a  gender  focal 
point and (ii) will incorporate GAP monitoring in their quarterly progress reports, (using the ADB 
GAP Progress Report template) to government and ADB. The PMUs will also assign a gender 
focal point among PMUs staff to be responsible for GAP implementation, monitoring and reporting 
to  ADB.  The  IAs  will  recruit  national  gender  consultant(s)  (6  person-month  inputs/province)  to 
support PMUs in preparing GAPs for the additional subprojects, implementing and reporting on 
GAP implementation and capacity building for IAs on Gender mainstreaming. 
134.  The PMUs will work with the relevant provincial, district and commune agencies (Vietnam 
Women's Union, Agriculture extension agencies, Committee for Ethnic Minority Affairs and NGOs, 
etc.)  to  implement  and  coordinate  training,  capacity  building,  and  HIV/AIDs  awareness  raising 
and road safety activities. 
135. 
Implementation of GAP will be overseen by each Provincial Steering Committee. Budget 
for  GAP  implementation  is  provided through counterpart funding  including training for  capacity 
building and gender activities at subproject level.

Monitoring  
1.  Project performance monitoring.  
136.  Project progress and performance will be based on the indicators and targets shown in 
the  DMF.  Five  kinds  of  monitoring  will  be  carried  out  including:  (i)  implementation  progress 
monitoring; (ii) safeguard monitoring; (iii) benefit monitoring and evaluation; (iv) GAP monitoring; 
and (v) loan agreement covenant monitoring. 
137. 
Implementation progress monitoring will be one of the main tasks of each PMU that 
will  be  supported  by  each  PMU  monitoring  and  evaluation  specialist  and  will  be  based  on  the 
detailed  work  planning  schedules  –  see  Annex  4  for  the  proposed  subproject  and  project 
management  work  planning  template  and  the  overall  project  implementation  schedule. 
Collectively these will be consolidated into a provincial EA and Project wide PPMS.  
138.  The Provincial PPMS will be managed by the PMU who will maintain it and report updated 
progress  on  a  quarterly  basis.  The  consolidated  project  PPMS  will  be  managed  by  the  BIIG2 
Coordination Unit attached to the Quang Tri Province.  
139.  The project performance monitoring system (PPMS) will monitor the progress of activities 
in the province. To augment information collected during the PPTA and the subproject feasibility 
studies  will  provide  a  baseline  dataset  for  each  subproject  that  will  define  (i)  activities,  (ii)  the 
implementation timelines and milestones, (iii) outputs delivery progress, (iv) final output, and (v) 
contribution  of  each  subproject  output  to  the  outcome  indicators.  The  PPMS  will  not  directly 
assess  the  contribution  to  the  project  impact.  PPMS  monitoring  activities  will  entail  periodic 
monitoring  of  the  benefits  and  impacts  of  a  representative  number  of  selected  subprojects  as 
reported  in  quarterly  reports.  This  will  be  undertaken  by  each  PPC-PMU  monitoring  and 
evaluation staff member.  
140.  Each subproject will have a completion report prepared by the construction supervision 
consultant that will include details of (i) output completed, (ii) output still in progress, (iii) road user 
data and forecasts based on traffic counts after road completion and within 6 months of Project 
completion and the conversion of this data into PCU with a comparative assessment of measured 
PCU’s and the those projected at subproject design and feasibility approval. For Water supply the 
number of connections, sale of water data will also be compared to design forecasts. The PMU 
staff will collate this into provincial level reports and the BIIG1 coordination unit will consolidate 
these into an overall Project Performance data base and reporting system that can be used for 
post evaluation purposes. 
2.  Compliance monitoring.  
141.  The  government  and  EAs  have  agreed  with  ADB  on  certain  covenants  for  the  project, 
which are set forth in the loan agreement including the following: 
(i) 
(ii) 
The government will ensure that adequate funds are allocated for the periodic 
maintenance  of  infrastructure  developed  under  the  project  through  provincial 
budgets to maintain the infrastructure in functional order; and 
The government will ensure that a grievance redress mechanism established in 
RPs/REMDPs for affected people in the participating districts will be implemented 
effectively and satisfactorily. 
87 
142.  ADB  will  monitor  compliance  with  all  covenants  throughout  implementation  via  regular 
review missions, quarterly progress reports submitted by the PMUs through the Secretariat, and 
review of project accounts and procurement procedures. 
143.  Safeguards  monitoring.  Safeguards  monitoring  with  associated  grievance  redress 
mechanisms will be developed to ensure that the required policies, procedures and plans for: (i) 
resettlement  including  land  acquisition  and  compensation;  (ii)  ethnic  minority  people  specific 
actions  are  implemented  and  achieve  their  expected  outcomes  during  subproject  preparation, 
implementation and operation; and (iii) EMP plan implementation. 
3.  Gender and social dimensions monitoring.   
144.  PMUs will report to ADB regularly. Data will be disaggregated by sex and where sensible19  
ethnic minorities. Routine monitoring by the Project will focus on assessing progress against GAP 
targets,  identifying  constraints  and  developing  remedial  actions  to  effectively  address  these. 
Monitoring  results  will  be  included  in  at  least  every  second  quarterly  progress  reports,  and 
assessment/evaluations of the GAP will be an essential element of all reviews. 
4.  Road Safety Monitoring 
145.  The  implementation  of  the  road  safety  awareness  plan  and  the  implementation  of  the 
measures will be reported in the detailed design documentation and quarterly progress reports. 
Evaluation 
146.  ADB will conduct regular (at least twice per year) reviews throughout implementation of 
the project to assess implementation performance and achievement of outcomes and objectives, 
examine financial progress, and identify issues and constraints affecting the project and work out 
time-bound action plans for their resolution. 
147.  A  midterm  review  will  also  be  undertaken  from  18  months  to  24  months  from  loan 
effectiveness.  This  review  will  include  a  comprehensive  evaluation  of  project  implementation 
arrangements,  detailed  evaluation  of  the  scope  and  implementation  process  and  progress  of 
subprojects, feedback from the PPMS, performance of consultants, and possible reallocation of 
loan  proceeds.  During  this  more  significant  review,  the  effectiveness  of  project  management 
arrangements will be a priority with remedial action will be instituted as required. 
148.  Within  12  months  of  physical  completion  of  the  project,  ADB  will  conduct  a  project 
completion mission to carry out a preliminary assessment of the success of the Project to achieve 
its physical, and socio-economic developmental objectives, as well as to review compliance with 
ADB requirements and loan covenants. 
Reporting  
1.  Provincial Work Planning and Reporting  
149.  Reporting will be directly linked to the physical implementation progress of project annual 
work plans, budgets and forecasts of contract awards and disbursements. Work planning will be 
19 Where  Ethnic  minorities  account  for  more  than  85%  of  the  population  the  need  to  disaggregated  is  significantly 
reduced  
88 
developed by each PMU no later than 45 days prior to the end of the fiscal year with a mid-year 
update no later than 30 days after mid-year. The work plans will be developed for each individual 
subproject with the first annual work plan within 45 days of Project start up. Draft work plans will 
be  developed  prior  to  loan  signing  to  enable  preparation  of  advance  funds  to  be  planned  and 
approved.  A  draft structure for subproject  physical  planning  is  included in  Annex  4  and  will  be 
linked into the ADB (Viet Nam Resident Mission PDIP excel work book) after loan negotiations. 
The individual subproject work plans will be consolidated and linked to the budgets for ADB and 
Government Funds in separate projections. Both the work plan and projections will be based on 
a life of project approach with progress reported against these and modifications and adaptation 
to plans made on an as needed basis but no less than six monthly. The Project Director is solely 
responsible for ensuring work plans and forecast are developed and maintained on this time line.  
In addition  to  the  subproject  work  plan  each  PMU  will  also derived  a project  procurement  and 
contract award schedule. The information for this schedule will be derived from the subproject 
workplan schedule and will develop a procurement and contract award reporting worksheet that 
clearly identifies progress against plans and highlights on a quarterly basis any deviation from 
planned schedule timelines where the deviation exceeds one month and formal PMU statement 
on the cause and management response to address the delay is required.  
150.  The  PMU  Project  Director  will  also  ensure  that  the  overall  progress  of  the  project 
implementation  and management  are  clearly  scheduled  including  activities  such  as Safeguard 
monitoring reports,  compliance reporting,  land acquisition  and  compensation achievement  and 
the achievement of outputs and how these are contributing to the project DMF indicators – see 
Table  22  below.  As  such  this  will  require  each  PMU  to  establish  a  Project  Performance 
Management  System  that  disaggregates  technical,  social  and  financial  data  within  each 
subproject and captures (i) baselines data from the feasibility study surveys, (ii) data on technical, 
safeguards and social from the detailed design stage, (iii) subproject outputs and the effects on 
the number of beneficiaries, the nature of impacts etc. The different outputs require significantly 
different data sets that will need to be stored and accessible to the PMU for project completion 
reporting  as  well  as  implementation  reporting.  An  indicative  table  of  contents  for  the  progress 
report is provided in Annex 5. 
2.  Project Level Work Planning and Reporting  
151.  As  coordinating  Province  the  Quang  Tri  DPI/PMU  will  provide  ADB  with  (i)  quarterly 
progress  reports  in  a  format  consistent  with  ADB's  project  performance  reporting  system; 
(ii) consolidated annual reports including (a) progress achieved by output as measured through 
the  indicator's  performance  targets,  (b)  key  implementation  issues  and  solutions,  (c)  updated 
procurement plan, and (d) updated implementation plan for the next 12 months; and (iii) a project 
completion report within 6 months of physical completion of the project. To ensure that projects 
will continue to be both viable and sustainable, project accounts and the executing agency audited 
financial statement together with the associated auditor's report, should be adequately reviewed.  
152.  Each  Provincial  DPI/PMU  will  ensure  that  the  required  information  and  milestones  are 
achieved through a Memorandum of Understanding agreed between the four EA’s that details the 
annual timing for the preparation and Provincial approval of: 
(i) 
Each Provinces annual implementation and work plans presented by subproject, output 
and for the overall province, including  
a.  supporting  annual  budgets  in  the  form  of  financial  forecasts  that  define 
budget and cashflow requirements by source of funding,  
b.  annual projection of contract awards and  
c.  projected disbursements 
(ii) 
Timing of a joint provincial project performance and planning meeting supported by the 
BIIG2 co-ordination unit in Quang Tri that presents: 
89 
a.  A review of progress and achievement in the past year 
b.  An updated status of subproject preparatory work for submission to ADB 
and PPC for approvals 
c.  An updated procurement and contracting status 
d.  An updated implementation program for the following year including carry 
over activities that were not completed 
e.  Revised budget and financial projections by subproject, financial cashflows 
f.  Revised contract award and disbursement projections  
g.  The  preparation  of  a  consolidated  work  plan  and  financial  projection  for 
ADB  8  weeks  prior  to  the  end  of  each  Project  year,  timing  of  a  joint 
provincial  project  performance  and  planning  meeting  every  three  month, 
and planning update meeting within one month of the mid-year point that: 
i.  Review  the  consolidated  quarterly  report  prepared  by  the  BIIG2 
coordination report 
ii.  Identifies outstanding implementation issues and challenges 
iii.  Identifies issues or bottlenecks that need to be addressed within or

iv.  Prepares a report for ADB and the respective PPCs 
Stakeholder Communication Strategy  
1. 
Consultation 
153.  The  project  is  designed  to  improve  the  welfare  of  rural  inhabitants  in  the  four  Project 
Provinces through a series of investments aimed to improve transport, socio-economic wellbeing 
and agricultural value chains. 
154.  Project preparation has been conducted with stakeholder agencies in the government at 
national, provincial and district levels including MPI, MOF, SBV and Ministry of Natural Resources 
and Environment (MONRE). Meetings have also been held in the participating provinces with DPI, 
DOT,  DARD,  DOIT  and  DOF  officials,  focusing  on  management  arrangements  and  issues. 
Requirements  for  ensuring  appropriate  levels  of  consultation  for  subproject  preparation  and 
implementation  have  been  reviewed  and  confirmed.  Representative  subproject  preparation 
included consultation requirements involving documented evidence of inclusive consultation with 
all communities in the subproject area and participant information on numbers of women and men 
by ethnic minority. Subproject socio-economic/gender surveys that identify vulnerable groups to 
provide  a  basis  for  specific  consultation  and  participation  mechanisms  will  be  followed  during 
implementation. 
155.  During implementation, the process of consultation will continue throughout the process 
for  preparing  and  approving  FS  for  additional  subprojects  and  the  follow  on  DEDs  for  each 
subproject. The consultation  seeks  to  provide  community groups the  opportunity  to  voice their 
views on how the subproject is to be designed, implemented and operated. In addition, associated 
initiatives  will  be  built  into  the  design  of  each  subproject  to  enhance  the  inclusiveness  of  the 
90 
project  activities  from  the  perspective  of  social  and  economic  integration  of  less  well-off 
communities. 
2. 
Participation 
156. 
It  is  anticipated  that  the  community  will  be  mobilized  in  several  different  ways  during 
subproject  design,  implementation  and  operation.  During  subproject  design  and  preparation 
stages, community participation will consist primarily of their contribution through the consultation 
process,  field  survey  ad  focus  group  discussions  and  direct  consultation.  During  construction, 
there will be significant opportunities for active participation, particularly for the poor households 
who will benefit from the subproject through opportunities to participate in paid employment for 
unskilled workers and through the linkages to producers to value chain enterprises and markets. 
This  will  be  encouraged  through  (i)  the  bidding  documents  which  will  require  contractors  to 
investigate  the  option  of  local  employment  whenever  possible,  and  (ii) through  the  terms  of 
reference  for  the  value  chain  service  provider,  the  criteria  for  accessing  producer  group  and 
enterprise grants. 
3. 
Awareness 
157. 
Information  about  the  project  and  the  subprojects,  including  the  objectives,  potential 
environmental  impact,  implementation  arrangements,  resettlement  and  compensation  matters, 
gender  issues,  issues  of  concerns  for  ethnic  minorities  will  be  provided  to  beneficiaries. 
Information will be provided through village meetings, pamphlets, and other announcements in 
both Vietnamese language and the language(s) of the communities whenever appropriate. The 
community will be fully informed of issues such as their right to participate in the subprojects and 
to be compensated for any loss of property including productive land and/or assets as well as 
gender equity and other relevant policies. Separate meetings and discussions will be arranged 
with  the  people  who  are  directly  affected  by  land  acquisition  and/or  resettlement  issues.  The 
community and particularly the affected households will be provided with detailed guidance and 
procedures regarding resettlement and compensation.

X.  ANTICORRUPTION POLICY 
159.  ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any violations of 
the Anticorruption Policy relating to the project.20 All contracts financed by ADB shall include 
provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of the 
executing  agency  and  all  project  contractors,  suppliers,  consultants,  and  other  service 
providers. Individuals and/or entities on ADB’s anticorruption debarment list are ineligible to 
participate in ADB-financed activity and may not be awarded any contracts under the project. 
160.  To support these efforts, relevant provisions are included in the loan agreement and 
the bidding documents for the project. All contracts financed by ADB shall include provisions 
specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of the EAs, as well 
as  all  contractors,  suppliers,  consultants,  and  other  service  providers  as  they  relate  to  the 
Project. Individuals/ entities on ADB’s anticorruption debarment list are ineligible to participate 
in ADB- financed activity and may not be awarded any contracts under the project.38  
161.  The  project  design  and  implementation  arrangements  provide  for  mitigation  of 
corruption  risks.  Risks  associated  with  project  management,  including  procurement  and 
disbursement,  will  be  mitigated  by  the  engagement  of  LIC  to  advise  and  assist  in  the 
procurement  of goods  and  services,  and  the  engagement  of  other  consultants. The  overall 
project will establish and operate a website in which it will disclose implementation progress; 
bid  notifications  and  their  results;  and  provide  grievance  redress  mechanism  against  any 
corrupt  practice.  References  on  ADB's  Anticorruption  Policy  can  be  accessed  through  the 
following link: http://www.adb.org/Integrity/. 
20 Anticorruption Policy: http://www.adb.org/Documents/Policies/Anticorruption-Integrity/Policies-Strategies.pdf 
100 
XI.  ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISM 
162.  People who are, or may in the future be, adversely affected by the project may submit 
complaints to ADB’s Accountability Mechanism. The Accountability Mechanism provides an 
independent forum and process whereby people adversely affected by ADB-assisted projects 
can voice, and seek a resolution of their problems, as well as report alleged violations of ADB’s 
operational  policies  and  procedures.  Before  submitting  a  complaint  to  the  Accountability 
Mechanism, affected people should make an effort in good faith to solve their problems by 
working with the concerned ADB operations department. Only after doing that, and if they are 
still dissatisfied, should they approach the Accountability Mechanism.21 
21 Accountability Mechanism. http://www.adb.org/Accountability-Mechanism/default.asp.  
XII.  RECORD OF CHANGES TO THE PROJECT ADMINISTRATION MANUAL 
163.  All revisions and/or updates during implementation should be retained in this section 
to provide a chronological history of changes to implemented arrangements recorded in the 
PAM, including revision to contract awards and disbursement s-curves.

1. 
General 
170.  The procedures to be followed for the procurement of goods, non-consulting services, 
and  works  under  contracts  awarded  on  the  basis  of  National  Competitive  Bidding  shall  be 
112 
those set forth in: (a) Law on Procurement No. 43/2013/QH13 dated November 26, 2013 ("Law 
on  Procurement")  and  (b)  Decree  No.63/2014/ND-CP  dated  June  26,  2014  (collectively, 
"National Procurement Laws"). Whenever any procedure in the National Procurement Laws 
is inconsistent with the ADB Procurement Guidelines (March 2013, as amended from time to 
time), the ADB Procurement Guidelines shall prevail, amongst others on the following. 
2. 
Eligibility 
171.  The  eligibility  of  bidders  shall  be  defined  under  section  I  of  the  ADB  Procurement 
Guidelines; accordingly, no bidder or potential bidder should be declared ineligible for reasons 
other than those provided in section I of the ADB Procurement Guidelines, as amended from 
time to time. Conditions of bidders' participation shall be limited to those that are essential to 
ensure bidders' capability to fulfil the contract in question. Foreign bidders shall be eligible to 
participate under the same conditions as national bidders. Foreign bidders shall not be asked 
or required to form joint ventures with, or be subcontractors to, national bidders  to submit a 
bid. 
172.  A firm  declared  ineligible by  ADB  cannot  participate in bidding for  an  ADB-financed 
contract during the period determined by ADB. 
173.  A bidder shall not have a conflict of interest, which term shall be defined in accordance 
with section 1 of ADB Procurement Guidelines.1 Any bidder found to have a conflict of interest 
shall be ineligible for contract award. 
174.  Government-owned enterprises in the Borrower's country shall be eligible to participate 
as a bidder only if they can establish that they are legally and financially autonomous, operate 
under commercial law and are not dependent agencies of the Borrower or Sub-Borrower. 
National sanction lists may only be applied with approval of ADB. 
3. 
Preference 
175.  No preference of any kind shall be given to domestic bidders over foreign bidders or 
for  domestically  manufactured  goods  over  foreign  manufactured  goods.  Unless  otherwise 
stated in the applicable financing agreement, preferences among domestic bidders set forth 
in Article 14(3) of the Law on Procurement shall not be applied. 
4. 
Bidding Procedure 
176.  Single stage-single envelope shall be the default bidding procedure and application of 
other bidding procedures shall require ADB's prior approval. 
5. 
Time for Bid Preparation 
177.  The time allowed for the preparation and submission of bids for large and/or complex 
packages shall not be less than thirty (30) days from the date of the invitation to bid or the date 
of availability of the bidding documents, whichever is later. 
6. 
Standard bidding documents 
178.  The  Borrower's  standard  bidding  documents,  acceptable  to  ADB,  shall  be  used. 
Bidders shall be allowed to submit bids by hand or by mail/ courier. 
7. 
Bid Opening and Evaluation 
113 
(i)  Bids shall  be  opened  in public,  immediately  after  the  deadline for  submission  of  bids, 
regardless of the number of bids received. 
(ii)  Except with prior approval of ADB, merit points shall not be used in bid evaluation. 
(iii)  No price adjustments shall be made for evaluation purposes in accordance with Article 
117(6)  of  Decree  63  when  unit  rates  offered  by  the  bidder  are  determined  to  be 
abnormally low. 
(iv)  Bidders shall be given commercially reasonable time period to respond to clarification 
requests. 
(v)  Bidders  shall  not  be  eliminated  from  detailed  evaluation  on  the  basis  of  minor,  non-
substantial deviations3. 
(vi)  Except with the prior approval of ADB, negotiations contemplated under paragraphs 7 
and 8 of Article 117 of Decree No. 63/2014/ND-CP shall not take place with any bidder 
prior to contract award. 
(vii)  A  bidder  shall  not  be  required,  as  a  condition  for  award  of  contract,  to  undertake 
obligations  not  specified  in  the  bidding  documents  or  otherwise  to  modify  the  bid  as 
originally submitted. 
8. 
Rejection of All Bids and Rebidding 
(i)  No bid shall be rejected on the basis of a comparison with the Procuring Entity's estimate 
or budget ceiling without ADB's prior concurrence. 
(ii)  All bids shall not be rejected and new bids solicited without ADB's prior approval. 
9. 
Publication of the Award of Contract and Debriefing. 
(i) 
For contracts subject to prior review, within 2 weeks of receiving ADB's "No—objection 
to the recommendation of contract award, the borrower shall publish in the Government 
Public Procurement Gazette, or well-known and freely-accessible website the results of 
the  bid  evaluation,  identifying  the  bid  and  lot  numbers,  and  providing  information  on: 
i) name of each bidder who submitted a bid; ii) bid prices as read out at bid opening; 
iii) name and evaluated prices of each bid that was evaluated; iv) name of bidders whose 
bids were rejected and the reasons for their rejection; and v) name of the winning bidder, 
and  the  price  it  offered,  as  well  as  the  duration  and  summary  scope  of  the  contract 
awarded. 
(ii)  For contracts subject to post review, the procuring entity shall publish the bid evaluation 
(iii) 
results no later than the date of contract award. 
In the publication of the bid evaluation results, the Borrower shall specify that any bidder 
who wishes to ascertain the grounds on which its bid was not selected, may request an

SUMMARY 
224.  The  Basic  Infrastructure  for  Inclusive  Growth  Projects  will  be  implemented  in  eight 
provinces in the north-eastern and north-central sub-regions of Vietnam (BIIG-1 and BIIG-2, 
respectively).22  They  are  to  be  executed  by  each  Provincial  People’s  Committee  (PPC)  as 
Executing  Agency,  with  their  respective  Departments  of  Investment  and  Planning  (DPI) 
designated  as  project  owners.  The  expected  outcome 
improved  subregional 
competitiveness  through  increased  productivity,  services  delivery,  and  movement  of  goods 
and people.  
is 
225.  Using  ADB’s  sector  project  modality,  representative  subprojects  from  the  range  of 
different  types  of  infrastructure  were  selected  during  project  preparation  to  establish  the 
feasibility  of  proposed  investments  using  a  preliminary  design  and  cost  estimate.  The 
feasibility test includes an assessment of climate risk and vulnerability of the representative 
subprojects. 
226.  The  climate  risk  assessment  identified  the  roads  and  bridges  as  vulnerable 
infrastructure elements due to increased flood risk. The assessment recommends that detailed 
engineering designs incorporate increased flooding risk due to climate change.  The following 
report describes an approach for including climate change in the detailed design of roads and 
associated structures. 
227.  These guidelines serve two purposes. First, they provide background understanding 
on the rationale for re-assessing design flood levels to consider climate change impacts based 
on climate modeling projections. Second, described here are steps to guide DED practitioners 
in adjusting design flood levels. 
228.  Government road design standards specify the estimation of design flood levels based 
on a frequency of occurrence (return period). These are set according to the road category 
and type of structure, both of which reflect local site conditions and forecast traffic volumes. 
The  estimated  design  flood  level  then  determines  the  road  embankment  elevations,  road 
drainage provisions, and vertical clearance of bridge decks.  
229.  The following guidelines do not change the existing national standards. The objective, 
rather, is to provide a cost-effective option to adjust design flood levels using existing design 
frequencies and hydrological formulas— by moving historical climate records in setting input 
parameters to the formulas and models to using projected climate records inclusive of climate 
change. Scientific climate change projections need to be factored into the design process.  
230.  Climate modeling data for the RCP 8.5 scenario is used for deriving the climate change 
projections.23 This scenario represents the most conservative24 assumptions on limiting future 
global greenhouse gas emissions. RCP scenarios diverge in their projected atmospheric CO2 
concentrations  beginning  about  2040s.  For  the  proposed  BIIG-1  and  BIIG-2  infrastructure 
design economic life is up to the mid 2030’s, for which projected climate change should be 
consistent  across  RCP  scenarios.  However,  a  review  of  projected  data  found  some 
inconsistency  in  the  RCP  4.5  scenario  data  relative  to  the  other  scenarios.  Taking  this 
22 BIIG-1 covers four North-Eastern provinces of Bac Kan, Cao Bang, Ha Giang and Lang Son; BIIG-2 covers four 
North-Central provinces of Ha Tinh, Nghe An, Quang Binh, and Quang Tri. 
23  Representative  Concentration  Pathways  (RCPs)  reflect  the  degree  to  which  GHG  emissions  are  actively 
mitigated, stabilized or increased. The four RCP scenarios are identified by their total “radiative forcing”, which 
is  the  difference  between  solar  energy  absorbed  by  the  Earth  and  the  energy  radiated  back  to  space.  It  is 
measured in watts per square meter (W/m2) projected in year 2100 relative to 1750.   
24  Conservative  in  the  sense  that  this  scenario  assumes  there  may  not  be  much  success  in  curtailing  global 
greenhouse gas emissions over the coming decades. 
146 
inconsistency into account, and considering the risk mitigation objective of the guidelines, the 
RCP 8.5 climate change projections were applied.  
231.  Projections  indicate  that  future  rainfall  intensities  are  likely  to  increase.  In  the  BIIG 
provinces,  model-derived  projections  indicate  significant  increases  in  extreme  rainfall 
especially for BIIG1 provinces.  The risk of relying on unadjusted historical rainfall for design 
purposes  is  that  the  structures  would  likely  be  under-designed  and  vulnerable  to  frequent 
disruption  and  damage  during  operation.  Managing  this  risk  is  now  a  priority  in  the 
Government’s transport sector policy framework.  
232.  Design  rainfall  adjustments  presented  in  part  one  of  these  guidelines  are  for  road 
component structures with design frequencies set at a return period of 25 years or less. For 
larger structures with design frequencies involving 50 or 100-year return periods (e.g., large 
bridges), adjustments are necessary though this may require different estimation approaches 
involving more complex hydrodynamic modelling solutions. An approach for dealing with such 
structures will be added as Part 2 of these guidelines for inclusion in the BIIG1 and 2 Project 
Administration Manual. 
233.  The two most important sets of national standards relevant to the engineering design 
of roads and bridges are TCVN 4054:2005 and TCVN 9845:2013. The former applies to the 
design  of  roads  and  highways  in  general,  including  new  construction  and  rehabilitation  of 
existing roads. Its scope also includes both urban roads and rural roads. The most important 
aspect of this standard is that it specifies the design frequency (return period) to be used in 
estimating design flood levels, depending on the road classification and the type of component 
structure.   
234.  TCVN 9845:2013, on the other hand, specifies procedures and formulas for hydrologic 
calculations used to determine the level of road embankments, drainage specifications and 
clearance of bridges above the design flood level. The formulas are based on the one-day 
maximum rainfall  intensity.  After  the  design frequency  for  a  structure  has  been  determined 
with reference to TCVN 4054:2005, the hydrologic calculations based on that frequency are 
done with reference to formulas specified in TCVN 9845:2013.  
235.  These guidelines develop, for the required design frequency levels up to P4 specified 
in the national standard, estimates of daily maximum rainfall for the historical baseline and for 
the period to 2035 that uses climate change projections. This data is then applied to generate 
the expected flood levels and design requirements Steps for carrying out such adjustment are 
described in the guidelines. The framework is shown below. 
236.  Statistical modeling using extreme value analysis was applied to derive design rainfall 
adjustment  factors  for  each  BIIG  province.  The  frequency  analysis  used  the  Generalized 
Extreme Value (GEV) probability distribution function, which showed the best fit to the data for 
the BIIG provinces.

147 
237.  Following the method above, annual one-day maximum rainfall data  were extracted 
from the climate model baseline25 simulation and the climate projection for each province. The 
one-day maximum rainfall estimated at various frequency levels (using the fitted probability 
distribution) were compared between the two periods. For any given design frequency, rainfall 
values corresponding to the modeled baseline and the projection period were then used to 
calculate percentage changes (adjustment factors). The results then used to adjust the actual 
historical rainfall values derived from observation data applicable to a specific subproject site. 
Adjustment factors derived for each province are provided in the guidelines.   
238.  To illustrate use of the guidelines, adjusted extreme daily rainfalls were applied to three 
representative subprojects to assess the extent of modification required—that is, to compare 
with the  unadjusted  conventional  design using  only  historical  rainfall  data. The  cases  were 
selected to represent the range of road categories and terrain among the BIIG subprojects. 
The impact on the design of using one-day maximum rainfall adjusted for climate change are 
summarized below:  
  An increase of 0.81 to 0.87 meter in water elevation at 5 small bridge locations for the 
Dinh Son – Anh Son mountain road in Nghe An province. The dimensions of 6 of the 
25 culvert locations were increased based on the adjusted design flows. For example, 
at a stream located at Km2+759 the flow increased from 5.17 to 7.37 m3/sec, with the 
dimensions of the proposed slab culvert increasing from 150 x 150 cm to 200 x 200 
cm.  
  For the Bao Ninh – Hai Ninh coastal road in Quang Binh province, the P4 design flows 
at two culvert sections increase by around 34% after adjusting the P4 value derived 
from  historical  record.  The  flood  water  elevations  increased  by  0.5  to  0.6  meter, 
requiring both an increase of culvert size and a need to raise the height of the road 
embankment. 
239.  For the Boc Bo - Bang Thanh - Son Lo Road in Bac Kan province, the design flood 
flow  at  4  small  bridge  locations  increased  by  36%  to  119%.  Flood  water  elevations  at  P4 
frequency increased by 0.2 to 2.26 meters after adjustment. 
25  The  term  “baseline  climate”  is  used  to  refer  to  the  modeling  simulation  of  the  past  climate,  while  the  term 
“historical climate” is used to refer to the real climate as observed in the past by monitoring stations.

A. 
Background 
INTRODUCTION 
240.  The two Basic Infrastructure for Inclusive Growth (BIIG) Sector Projects include BIIG-
1 in four north-eastern provinces (Bac Kan, Cao Bang, Ha Giang and Lang Son) and BIIG-2 
in four north-central provinces (Ha Tinh, Nghe An, Quang Binh and Quang Tri). The Projects’ 
Executing  Agency  will  be  the  Provincial  People’s  Committee  with  their  Departments  of 
Investment and Planning (DPI) designated Project Owners.  
241.  The  projects’  expected  outcome  is  to  enhance  opportunities  for  inclusive  economic 
growth  through  improved  transport  infrastructure  (roads  and  bridges),  improved  services 
(water supply, agricultural productivity), and professionally managed provincial infrastructure. 
Using  ADB’s  sector  project  modality,  representative  subprojects  were used to  assess  each 
Project’s  feasibility  during  project  preparation.  A  climate  risk  and  vulnerability  assessment 
(CRVA) examined the likely effects of climate change on the representative subprojects based 
on their preliminary engineering designs.26 Findings identify roads and their structures such 
as bridges to be the most vulnerable due to projected increased intensity of rainfall leading to 
increased flood water levels.  
242.  Climate change is not explicitly included in Vietnam’s engineering design standards for 
roads and bridges. The standards include hydrologic calculations of the design flood levels 
that are then used to inform the design. The existing standards provide engineering formulas 
wherein  rainfall  intensity  is  a  key  input  that  can  potentially  be  adjusted  for  climate  change 
impacts  on  flood  levels.  The  following  guidelines  provide  an  approach  and  estimates  for 
adjusting the design rainfall intensity at various frequencies or return periods corresponding 
to the road classification and type of structure. 
243.  Design flood levels, determined from hydrologic calculations based on peak rainfall, 
are used for the technical specifications of road component structures including drainage and 
bridges.  The  one-day  maximum  rainfall  is  used  as  a  key  determinant  of  flood  levels  for  a 
specified  frequency  of  occurrence  (i.e.,  equivalent  to  return  period).  The  frequency  of 
occurrence is specified in Government regulation TCVN 4054:2005 for differing categories of 
roads and for differing bridges sizes. The design flood levels are then used to determine road 
level/elevation,  road  drainage  provisions,  and  vertical  clearance  of  bridge  decks  above  the 
floodwater  level.  Currently  historical  daily  maximum  rainfall  data  is  applied  to  estimate  the 
design flood levels for each frequency or return period specified.   
244.  Overall,  climate  change  scenarios  future  extreme  rainfall  events  are  projected  to 
increase in magnitude for any specified frequency or return-period.27  Reliance on historical 
rainfall and past flood events will therefore increasingly underestimate future flood levels. The 
risk of using solely historical data for engineering design purposes to estimate flood levels is 
that  the  resultant  structures  may  be  increasingly  vulnerable  to  recurrent  damage  or  the 
increased potential for some structures to fail.  
245.  These  guidelines  provide  a  method  for  reducing  these  risks  by  applying  climate 
change-adjusted rainfall projections within the hydrological formulas used to estimate future 
(frequency-based) peak flows and flood levels. The underlying set of design standards do not 
26  The  CRVA  was  framed  to  answer:  (i)  what  climate  parameters  are  critical  to  infrastructure  performance  and 
durability?  (ii)  how  are  these  critical  climate  parameters  projected  to  change  over  the  project  life?  (iii)  are 
existing/similar  assets  already  being  affected  by  increasing  climate  variability  and  extremes?  (iv)  what  non-
climate factors aggravate or mitigate climate change impacts (v) how vulnerable is the infrastructure?  (vi) what 
measures should be incorporated in the detailed design of the subproject? 
27  An  equivalent  statement  is  that  the  frequency  or  return  period  will  be  shorter  for  any  given  extreme  rainfall 
magnitude.

require change the guidelines simply adjust the required input data to maximum daily rainfall 
expected by mid-century. 
B. 
Purpose and scope of guidelines 
246.  The  following  report  serves  two  purposes.  The  first  part  provides  the  rationale  for 
adjusting  design  flood  estimates  based  on  climate  modeling  projections  produced  by 
MoNRE.28 The second part describe steps that DED practitioners can apply to adjust design 
flood  levels  for  climate  change  based  on  design  frequencies  and  hydrological  formulas 
specified in existing national standards.  
247.  Annex A presents the climate modeling for Viet Nam, and Annex B summarizes the 
projections for Vietnam. Annex C presents formulas specified for estimating the design flood. 
Annex D gives details on the extreme value analysis method used to derive rainfall adjustment 
factors.  Annex  F  gives  results  of  recalculating  the  engineering  specifications  of  road 
component  structures  using  climate  change-adjusted  rainfall  applied  to  3  case  study 
subprojects. Annex G gives an overview of hydrological modeling, which is suited to designing 
structures requiring more extreme design frequencies (e.g., P1). 
248.  The  guidelines  apply  current  government  standards  which  stipulate  the  design 
frequencies,  depending  on  the  road  category  and  type  of  component  structure,29  for 
hydrological parameters (flood volume, water level and water velocity) used to determine the 
road  embankment  level,  drainage  system  provisions,  bridge  clearances  and  structural 
supports, and allowable overflow depths on spillway crossings. 
249.  The objective of the guidelines is to provide a cost-effective means for adjusting design 
flood  levels  using  existing  design  frequencies  and  hydrological  formulas  using  forward 
projections rather than solely relying on historical climate records.  
250.  The scope of the design rainfall adjustment factors recommended in these guidelines 
is for road structures with design frequency levels set at a return period of 25 years or less 
(P4 to P10). For larger structures with design frequencies involving return periods of 50 years 
(P2) or 100 years (P1), such as large bridges, adjustments are necessary though this may 
require  different  estimation  approaches  involving  more  complex  hydrodynamic  modeling 
solutions or comparative analysis using similar watersheds.30  
Projected climate change in BIIG-1 and BIIG-2 provinces 
A. 
Climate change modeling approach 
251.  The following section describes the climate change modeling studies used to obtain 
climate change projections at province level. Additional technical details are provided in Annex 
A. The rainfall adjustment factors provided in these guidelines are derived  from analysis of 
model-generated climate change projections.  
252.  Global  climate  change  models  (GCMs)  use  greenhouse  gas  emission  scenarios  to 
project  climate  change  in  the  medium  to  long  term.  These  scenarios  define  alternative 
greenhouse  gas  (GHG)  emission  levels  with  typically  four  CO2  atmospheric  concentration 
28 For brevity, only a summary of climate change projections is presented in the guidelines. Details are found in the 
CRVA report for each sub-region. 
29 The notation Px (e.g., P4) refers to an extreme weather event with x% probability of being equaled or exceeded 
in  any  one  year.  The  corresponding  return  period  or  recurrence  interval  is  the  reciprocal  of  the  exceedance 
probability. 
30 A future addition to the guidelines is planned to include adjustment for medium and large bridges, including use 
of appropriate hydro-dynamic models. An overview of such models is given in Annex G.

trajectories  reported  for  climate  change  policy  known  as  Representative  Concentration 
Pathways (RCPs). The projections from RCPs are then used as inputs to GCMs in generating 
climate  change  projections.  GCMs  simulate  the  processes  and  feedback  loops  between 
components  of  the  climate  system  at  global  scale.  GCMs  typically  model  at  low  spatial 
resolutions (more than 200 km) due to computing requirements. 31   
253.  The differing climate research institutions that develop and run these climate models 
use differing assumptions of the global climate system, resulting in differing climate projections 
for  the  same  RCP  scenario  between  models.  The  extent  of  agreement  of  the  projected 
direction and magnitude of climate change across multiple models is considered indicative of 
the “robustness of projections”. 
254.  Global  climate  models  continue  to  be  improved  and  increasingly  are  capable  of 
producing higher resolution projections32. Currently existing GCM outputs remain unreliable at 
sub-regional levels or below. Locations with rugged topography and elevation differences that 
strongly influence climate, as in the case of BIIG-1 north-eastern provinces, limit the direct use 
of existing GCM outputs.  To increase the reliability of climate change impact assessments at 
sub-regional or provincial scale, higher-resolution climate change projections are needed to 
transform GCM output into local or regional projections. 
255.  Downscaling  or  “regionalization”  produces  higher-resolution  climate  projections 
derived  from  low-resolution  GCM  outputs  at  a  scale  of  50  km  or  less.  Such  downscaling 
provides a more precise representation of the effects of local geographic features, such as 
mountain topographies – increasing their applicability and reliability for local planning. 
256.  Dynamical and statistical downscaling methods are used. In dynamical downscaling, 
a  regional  climate  model  (e.g.,  PRECIS33)  is  run  for  a  delineated  sub-region  in  which  the 
boundary  conditions  are  derived  from  a  parent  GCM.  In  statistical  downscaling,  analysis  is 
based  on  statistical  properties  of  the  historical  climate  at  observation  stations  that  are 
correlated  with  gridded  coarse-scale  GCM  baseline  projections.  (Refer  to  Appendix  A  for 
additional explanation on downscaling methods). 
B. 
Viet Nam Climate Change Projections  
257.  Outputs  from  five  regional  climate  models  have  been  used  by  MoNRE’s  Institute  of 
Meteorology,  Hydrology  and  Environment  (IMHEN)  to  develop  downscaled  climate  change 
projections for Vietnam.34  Each of the five regional climate models used input data from the 
output of one or more low resolution or “parent” GCMs. Among the five regional climate models 
studied by MoNRE,35 the output of the PRECIS regional climate model is considered the most 
reliable and was run using data from the CNRM-CM5, GFDL-CM3 and HadGEM2-ES GCM 
31 A primer on how climate models work, based on expert consensus, is available at the website of the US National 
Research  Council's  Board  on  Atmospheric  Sciences  and  Climate:  http://nas-sites.org/climate-
change/climatemodeling. For a more technical description, refer to Chapter 9 of the IPCC’s Assessment Report 
No. 5 (2013): Evaluation of Climate Models. 
32  Improvements  in  climate modelling are  heavily  reliant on  the  computing  power  provided  by  supercomputers, 
such as the Earth Simulator in Japan.   
33 PRECIS was developed at the UK Met Office Hadley C enter with the purpose of enabling users in developing 
countries to easily produce detailed climate projections for any chosen region of the world.

Hanoi, 2016. The summary report is in English; the full report in Vietnamese. Details of MoNRE’s 2016 climate 
change database and how it was set up are described in Annex A, which also provides a guide on interpreting 
the scenarios and modeling outputs. 
35 Referring to page 39 of the MoNRE climate change full report indicated that the results of rainfall calculations 
show differences between the models for climatic regions of Vietnam, and that the PRECIS model gave results 
that were judged more reliable compared with the other models. 
151 
models.  The  regional  climate  models  produced  three  sets  of  high-resolution  climate 
projections under each particular regional climate model. 
258.  For these guidelines, the output from the three GCMs downscaled using PRECIS are 
used  to  generate  forecasts  of  future  daily  maximum  rainfall  at  various  frequencies  under 
climate  change  conditions.  These  projections  relative  to  the  current  baseline  climate 
conditions are used to develop the adjustment factors.  
259.  MoNRE’s database on downscaled climate projections for Viet Nam used two of the 
four RCP CO2 concentration scenarios, namely: RCP 4.5 representing a CO2 concentration 
pathway  based  on  moderate  levels  of  GHG  emissions  mitigation,  and  RCP  8.5  which 
represents the pathway without effective mitigation of future GHG emissions resulting in strong 
warming by the end of century.  
260. 
In terms of projected atmospheric CO2 concentrations, the RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios 
differ little up to 2040. Thereafter, their projections diverge as emission levels under RCP 4.5 
assumptions  stabilize,  emission  levels  under  RCP  8.5  continue  to  increase.  Given  that  the 
purpose is to mitigate risk of climate change by ensuring that infrastructure engineering design 
is resilient, these guidelines apply climate projections derived from RCP 8.5. 
261.  Data  for  each  of  the  BIIG-1  and  BIIG-2  provinces  from  the  downscaled  model 
projections for the annual maximum daily rainfall covering the (i) baseline (1986 to 2005), (ii) 
early  century  (2016  to  2035),  and (iii)  mid-century  (2046  to  2065). These  were  used in the 
climate risk and vulnerability assessments up to mid-century for the two BIIG projects.  
262.  The  need  for  climate  change  risk  adjustment  is  demonstrated  for  the  BIIG1  and  2 
project provinces with the projected daily maximum rainfall compared to the current baselines 
rainfall levels – see Table 54. The annual daily maximum rainfall within the average of three 
PRECIS-downscaled  GCMs36  under  the  RCP  8.5  scenario to  increase  in all  provinces  with 
more intense wet season rainfall.

263.  For these guidelines, the applicable period of analysis corresponds the economic life 
of  BIIG-1  and  BIIG-2  road  infrastructure  subprojects,  which  is  up  to  the  mid-2030’s. 
Specifically,  one-day  maximum  rainfall  adjustment  factors  are  derived  to  adjust  baseline 
maximum  one  day  rainfall  for  input  to  the  design  rainfall  intensity  in  the  TCVN-specified 
hydrological formulas for estimating design flood levels.  
36 A modeling run refers to a downscaling application of PRECIS to a global climate model. In this study, PRECIS 
was used to downscale 3 GCMs:  CNRM-CM5,  GFDL-CM3  and HadGEM2-ES. The tabulated values are the 
average from the three modeling runs. 
152 
264.  The  considerable  differences  between  provinces  for  projected  change  in  rainfall 
intensity  support  the  recommendations  from  a  recent  hydrological  study  (Doan  Thi  Noi, 
201637) that question the use of the 18 climate sub-regions38 specified in TCVN 9845:2013. 
The use of a limited number of climate sub-regions results removes the significant variance 
between provinces leading to design bias. 
Vietnam engineering design standards 
A. 
Government-mandated engineering standards  
265.  The transport sector Climate Change Action Plan for the period 2016 to 2020, prepared 
by  the  Ministry  of  Transport  (MoT,  2015)  aims  to  continually  assess  the  impact  of  climate 
change  on  the  country’s  transportation  system;  identify  suitable  adaptation  measures  for 
transport construction works; and mobilize international resources to support the application 
the solutions to mitigate and adapt to climate change.  In support of this plan, the MoT has 
issued supporting decisions to clarify objectives and pave the way for climate change impacts 
be addressed through improved road standards and specifications.39 To date, no road-specific 
engineering design guidelines for climate change resilience have been issued.   
266. 
In  Vietnam,  the  Ministry  of  Science  and  Technology  (MoST)  is  responsible  for 
reviewing and approving national standards for application in various sectors. There are also 
sector-specific national standards, referred to as branch standards, such as those issued by 
MoT for the design of roads and bridges. Development of national standards is carried out by 
committees  and  working groups  composed  of  technical  experts  and  standards  developers. 
After  undergoing  a  series  of  draft  preparation  and  review  by  stakeholders,  the  Ministry  of 
Science and Technology exercises final authority to approve and issue the standard. 
267.  The two national standards relevant to the engineering design of roads and bridges 
are TCVN 4054:200540 and TCVN 9845:2013. The former applies to the design of roads and 
highways, including new construction and rehabilitation of existing roads. Its scope includes 
both  urban  and  rural  roads.  Roads  are  categorized  into  classes  based  on  expected  traffic 
volumes.41  The  standard  specifies  the  design  frequency  (or  return  period)  to  be  used  in 
estimating  design  flood  levels,  depending  on  the  classification  of  the  road  and  the  type  of 
structures associated with it – see Table 2.  
268.  TCVN  9845:2013,  specifies  procedures  and  formulas  for  hydrologic  calculations, 
which  for  roads  are  used  to  determine  road  embankment  elevations,  road  drainage 
specifications and clearance of bridges above the design flood level. TCVN 9845:2013 is a 
consolidation of previous ministerial branch standards dealing with hydrologic calculations for

and bridges (e.g., 22 TCN 272-05 for bridges).

38 There are 18 climate subregions covering Viet Nam, as defined by MoNRE. 
39  MoT  Decision  No.  1456  /  QD-BGTVT  of  11  May  2016  clarified  that  the  specific  objective  is  to  integrate  the 
implementation of measures to improve resilience to climate change in transport investment projects, which is 
to be pursued in parallel with expanding the country’s transport infrastructure. 
40 The coding of a national standard consists of three fields: the first field shows the letter code indicating the type 
of standard (for example, national standards are assigned the code TCVN). The second field contains a number 
that identifies the standard in the order of issuances, and the last field indicates the year when the standard was 
approved. 
41 The previous version of TCVN 4054 (2005) was issued in 1998. This standard was developed by a Technical 
Subcommittee  on  Highway  Transportation  Works  based  on  MoT’s  recommendations.  The  standard  was 
approved by the General Department of Standard, Metrology and Quality Control of the MoST, which officially 
issued it.

269.  A  key  parameter  specified  under  TCVN  4054:2005  is  the  frequency  of  the  one-day 
maximum rainfall, where Px represents the probability “x” with which an event is equaled or 
exceeded in any one year, and is equal to the reciprocal of the return period in years. The 
specified Px frequency level determines the magnitude of the design rainfall, which is used to 
determine the design flood level calculated using hydrologic formulas as provided in TCVN 
9845:2013.  The  Px  frequency  levels  are  set  according  to  the  road  category  and  type  of 
component structure – see Table 55. 
270.  The  guidelines  use  a  projected  maximum  daily  rainfall  level  for  the  required  Px 
frequency specified in the national standard. The procedure for such adjustment is explained 
in Section IV below. 
271.  After the Px frequency for a structure has been determined with reference to TCVN 
4054:2005, the hydrologic calculations based on that Px frequency use formulas specified in 
TCVN 9845:2013. To illustrate, under TCVN 9845:2013, the design water discharge at any 
given road location, e.g., a small bridge, is estimated using the formula below, in which the 
parameter Xnp represents the one-day maximum rainfall amount at the Px frequency specified 
for the type of structure and classification of road. 
272.  Definitions  of  the  other  parameters  in the  formula  above,  including  other  hydrologic 
formulas that depend on the Px parameter, are shown in Appendix C. These formulas were 
applied to three representative BIIG subprojects (details shown in Appendix F) as case studies 
to demonstrate the effect of adjusting the design rainfall intensity for projected climate change.  
The  guidelines  use  a  projected  maximum  daily  rainfall  level  for  the  required  Px  frequency 
specified in the national standard. The procedure for such adjustment is explained in Section 
IV below.

273.  Under certain conditions the Px design frequencies in Table 55 can be adjusted. These 
conditions  are  identified  as:  (i)  technical  difficulties  in  complying  with  the  standard,  the 
calculated frequencies may be relaxed (e.g., from P4 to P5) subject to approval by relevant 
authorities, although these are not identified, and (ii) if, during field investigation or surveying, 
42 Large bridges are those with drainage aperture (or opening) exceeding 100 meters. Medium bridges are those 
with aperture between 25 to 100 meters. And small bridges are those with less than 25 meters aperture.

historic maximum flood water levels are found to be  higher than the flood levels calculated 
through frequency analysis, the historic flood water is to be used, especially for designing large 
bridges.  No  opportunity  is  provided to adjust the design frequencies for  financial  budget  or 
cost constraints. 
274.  Further  adjustment  is  available  for  category  5  roads  only.  For  category  5  the  road 
elevation may allow the road to be overtopped. This applies to crossings43 over a wide and flat 
river bed with shallow depth, over waterways where water is not fast-flowing, and at localized 
depressions. Such “submersible” road sections can be combined with culverts (usually box-
type)  to  allow  water  to  pass  underneath  and  reduce  water  depth  over  the  crossing.  The 
maximum permissible water depth above the top of submersible road sections are specified 
in terms of expected water velocity at the crossing and the type of vehicle – see Table 56.

Climate resilient planning and design challenges  
275.  Design  engineers  in  Vietnam  are  aware  of  climate  change  issues,  but  they  find  it 
difficult to incorporate climate change effects for a variety of reasons: a lack of measured flow 
and flood level data for the vast majority of rivers, difficulty in accessing projections data on 
daily maximum rainfall or flood levels, the additional costs incurred by local design consultants 
that  are  not  reflected  in  the  detailed  design  cost  norms  followed  in  the  sector,  and  the 
perceived uncertainty surrounding the considerable range of projections derived from different 
climate change models and scenarios. 
276.  The future magnitude of rainfall change remains uncertain,44 however, the direction of 
change  (that  of  increasing  rainfall  intensity)  appears  unequivocal.  While  available  climate 
models do not reliably predict rainfall extremes at local (site-level) scale, the scientific basis 
for intensifying extremes is well-established and there is consensus among climate models for 
increased rainfall intensity. 
277.  The  guidelines  provide  an  affordable  procedure  to  incorporate  climate  risk  into  the 
design  of  site-specific  infrastructure.  The  guidelines  are  presented  in  two  Parts.  Part  One 
presents the recommended approach for small structures or roads categories 3, 4, and 5 the 
require P4 and P10 frequency for estimation of flood levels. Part Two provides guidelines for 
structures requiring P1 and P2 frequency levels in the estimation of flood and flow rates.  
43 Also referred to as “spillway” crossings in the subproject feasibility studies. 
44 Change in rainfall intensity, in particular, cannot be predicted with precision and accuracy at sub-regional scale, 
but always within a range of uncertainty. 
155 
Frequency analysis for adjusting the design rainfall 
A. 
Extreme value analysis method 
278.  Extreme value analysis (EVA) provides a method for the analysis of rare events that 
lie  in  the  tails  of  probability  distributions.  EVA  estimates  the  probability  of  events  that  are 
more extreme than may have previously been observed. The following section presents the 
use of this analysis to estimate projected daily maximum rainfall adjustments for a P4 rainfall 
intensity  that  is  applied  in  the  TCVN  engineering  design  formulas  to  estimate  design  flood 
levels  for  basic  structures  (road  embankments,  drainage  system,  spillway-crossings,  and 
small bridges) associated with road categories 3, 4 and 5.  
279.  Rainfall  intensity-frequency-duration  (IFD)  relationships  are  currently  derived  from 
historical rainfall records and assume future rainfall will mirror the statistical characteristics of 
the  historical  rainfall  record.  Climate  modeling  projections  invalidate  this  assumption  with 
climate  change  suggesting  historical  rainfall  IFD  relationships  are  likely  to  be  increasingly 
unreliable predictors of future flood levels.  
280.  As explained in Annex D, extreme value analysis used a Generalized Extreme Value 
(GEV) probability distribution function that provided the best fit to data according to statistical 
tests using the BIIG datasets. Annex D also explains the underlying theory and procedure for 
fitting statistical models based on extreme value analysis. For these guidelines, the analysis 
used  modeled  rainfall  data—specifically,  the  climate  models  and  climate  change  scenario 
explained above. 
281.  The  random  variable  used  for  the  extreme  value  analysis  was  the  annual  one-day 
maximum rainfall data extracted from the climate model baseline45 simulation (1986-2005) and 
the climate projection for 2016-2035 based on RCP8.5. Daily maximum rainfall at a range of 
frequency  levels  derived  from  the  GEV  probability  distribution  function  were  compared 
between  the  two  periods.  For  a  given  Px  frequency  level,  values  corresponding  to  the 
maximum daily rainfall in the modeled baseline period and in the projected period were used 
to calculate percentage adjustments. The percentage adjustments are used to adjust values 
derived from conventional frequency analysis of historical rainfall data for the site – see Figure 
8.  The  steps  are  further  explained  below,  and  results  for  each  province  are  tabulated  and 
charted in Appendix E. 
Figure 8. Procedure flow chart for deriving design rainfall adjustment 
45 In these guidelines, the term “baseline climate” is used to refer to the modeling simulation of the past climate, 
while  the  term  “historical  climate”  is  used  to  refer  to  the  real  climate  as  observed  in  the  past  by  monitoring 
stations. A climate model’s predictive ability is fine-tuned by adjusting its baseline simulation so that it matches 
the historical climate as much as possible.

B. 
Note on Interpreting frequency probability and return periods 
282.  The Px notation used in the TCVN standards represents the probability  of an event 
being equaled or exceeded in any one year. The theoretical return period is the reciprocal of 
that probability.  For example, a 25-year event has a 1/25=0.04 or 4% chance of being equaled 
or exceeded in any year, denoted by P4. 
283.  A 25-year event does not mean that it will happen regularly every 25 years, or only 
once in 25 years. Even though the term "return period" connotes a fixed interval, it is not. In 
any given 25-year period, a P4 or 25-year event may occur once, twice, more, or not at all, 
and each outcome has a probability that can be computed.46  
284.  Ten  or  more  years  of  data  are  ideally  required  to  perform  a  frequency  analysis  for 
determining return periods that can be supported statistically. A longer time series increases 
the  reliability  of  the  frequency  analysis  and  provides  more  confidence  in  the  results.  The 
extreme value (frequency) analysis for developing these guidelines used a 20-year time series 
for each time block.  
C. 
Proposed climate risk adjustment factor  
285.  Percentage adjustments  recommended in these guidelines  are  applied  to  the  Basic 
Infrastructure for Inclusive Growth Sector Project (I) and (ii) provinces. Annex E presents the 
estimated change between the baseline and projected future one-day maximum rainfall under 
RCP 8.5. Each province-level assessment is presented in one graph comparing five datasets 
- one for the baseline, one for of the three PRECIS model simulations projecting rainfall, and 
one being the average across the three projections. The proposed adjustment factor is the 
percentage change (increase) between the baseline and the average of the three modeling 
projections.  
286. 
46 The probability P that one or more events occurring during any period (n) will exceed a given threshold can be 
expressed, using the binomial distribution, as P = 1 – (1 – 1/T)n, where T is the threshold return period (e.g. 50-
yr), and n is the number of years for the period being examined. Using this equation, there is approximately a 
63% chance of one or more 100-year events occurring in any 100-year period. Using the equation, we can also 
calculate that the probability of a 100-year flood occurring during a 25-year period (say, the project life) is 22%. 
157 
Table 5757 (BIIG-1) and  
Table 5858 (BIIG-2) present the percentage adjustment factors for one-day maximum rainfall 
across a range of Px frequency levels.47 A feature of the datasets is significant differences in 
the level of adjustment between provinces highlighting the importance of downscaling climate 
change projections for a province rather than the 18 climatic zones used in the TCVN standard.  
287. 
In summary,  P4 frequency  specified  in TCVN  4054:2005 for the type  of structure  is 
used  in  the  TCVN  9845:2013  hydrological  formulas  using  one-day  maximum  rainfall  as 
parameter  to  determine  the  design  flood  level,  which  is  in  turn  used  to  design  the  road 
embankments, assess drainage system requirements, and estimate vertical clearances above 
the design flood level for small bridges.48 The recommended adjustments are in terms of the 
percentage increases to be applied to the P4 rainfall amounts derived from actual/historical 
rainfall data for the site. 
47 Note that these values are derived from climate model data which use grid point values that are assumed to 
represent area averages. They should not be expected to closely match station-based climate data collected at 
specific sites (point values). However, their statistical properties (mean, variance) are expected to be similar. 
48 Note that the setting of the spillway top elevations for submersible crossings over shallow streams is based on 
P10 design frequency.

288.  Beyond  P4,  that  is,  for  very  low  frequency  events  (P1  and  P2)  used  for  designing 
medium to large bridges, the computed percentage adjustments shown in Tables 57 and 58 
may  be  unreliable.  The  sites  of  medium  to  large  bridges  typically  involve  relatively  large 
drainage basin areas for which the relationship between Px rainfall and Px flood level may be 
weak. 49  
Steps for adjusting design of structures requiring P4 to P10 frequency 
A. 
Applying the guidelines 
289.  A  step-wise  implementation  of  the  guidelines  is  presented  below  for  adjusting  the 
historically  derived  rainfall  data  for  input  to  hydrological  formulas  specified  in  TCVN 
9845:2013,  specifically  for  structures  that  are  required  to  be  designed  with  P4  rainfall 
frequency. 
  Determine from TCVN 4054:2005 the applicable Px design frequency level for the road 
category  and  component  structure  being  designed—specifically,  identify  those 
components requiring a P4 (or higher, e.g., P10) design frequency. 
  From the subproject site’s historical record of rainfall, assemble a time series of 1-day 
maximum rainfall (in mm/day) for a minimum of 10-years. In general, the return period 
being projected should not be more than about two times the length or duration of the 
time series data. 
  Complete a data quality and verification check of the historical rainfall data to identify 
gaps  and  outliers.  The  data  set  needs  to  be  fully  populated  if  the  fitted  probability 
distribution  function  is  to  be  robust.  The  sensitive  nature  of  the  distribution  to  the 
completeness  of  the  time  series  often  requires  decisions  regarding  the  inclusion  or 
non-inclusion of outliers.50  
49  There  is  also  no  significant  correlation  found  between  the  time  series  pairs  of  annual  maximum  rainfall  and 
maximum  river  flow/level  in  the  historical  data  for  large  (gauged)  basins  in  the  BIIG  provinces.  Incongruent 
correlations of maximum rainfall and runoff can be expected where the basin is large, as earlier explained. In 
any case, P1 and P2 design flows/levels that apply to bridges that traverse rivers draining large basins are not 
customarily  determined  using  empirical  rainfall-runoff  formulas,  unlike  for  small  basins  in  which  the  use  of 
empirical formulas to relate (P4) peak rainfall to peak flow is applicable. 
50 Another approach is to calculate the P4 values with and without the outliers to assess the differences. 
159 
  Check for any “jumps”, or “outliers” outside gradual shifts in data values that may be 
caused by (non-climate) factors like station relocation, and changes in instrumentation 
or observation practices.51  
  Calculate  the  Px  daily  maximum  rainfall  by  conducting  an  extreme  value  frequency 
analysis52  of  the  historical  data—that  is,  calculate  the  value  corresponding  to  the 
required  Px  frequency  level  which  serves  as  the  historical  reference  value  (that  is, 
based  on  the  existing  climate)  and  which  needs  to  be  adjusted  for  climate  change 
impact.  
  Calculate  the  adjustment  factor  being  the  percentage  increase  in  daily  maximum 
rainfall for a given rainfall frequency as the change between the projected time period 
(specified as the economic life of the infrastructure) and the baseline data set. 
  Adjust the historical reference value above using the percentage adjustment factor for 
the province in which the planned subproject is located ( 
51 This test is for so-called “stationarity” or time homogeneity. A non-stationary process has a variable variance and 
a  mean  that  does  not  return  to  a  long-run  mean  over  time,  whereas  a  stationary  process  reverts  around  a 
constant long-term mean and has a constant variance independent of time. Such changes are easy to identify 
by plotting the time series data and using a Excel built-in function to detect trend, if any. 
52 Refer to Annex D, Section B, for the extreme value frequency analysis procedure using the Generalized Extreme 
Value probability distribution function and the equations used to estimate parameters. 
160 
  Table 57 and  
  Table 58). To adjust the baseline value, simply add the adjustment factor (as percent 
increase in decimal) from the tables. 
             Adjusted design rainfall = (Historical reference value) x (1 + adjustment factor53) 
  Use the adjusted one-day maximum rainfall (corresponding the specified Px frequency 
level) as input to the hydrological formula in TCVN 9845:2013 to estimate the climate 
change-adjusted design flood level.  
  Use the adjusted design flood level in the setting the technical specifications for the 
structure being designed. 
B. 
An application of the guidelines to selected BIIG-1 and BIIG-2 subprojects 
290.  As a case study to highlight the impact of the P4 adjustment the estimated adjustment 
factor was applied to three BIIG1 and 2 representative road subprojects. These roads are all 
under  categories  4  and  5.  Adjustment  factors  for  the  one-day  maximum  rainfall  parameter 
were applied in the hydrologic formulas specified in TCVN 9845:2013 to assess the impact on 
the engineering specifications for the road embankments, drainage systems and small bridges 
that are subject to P4 design frequency, as specified in TCVN 4054:2005. Adjustments to the 
P1 and P2 structures (medium and large bridges) were not calculated. 
291.  The case-subprojects are summarized in  
Table 5959.

Features 
Twenty-one km of existing rural road  will be upgraded to  category 5 mountain 
road meeting TCVN 4054-05 standards: 6.5 m road base width, 3.5 m surface 
width, and 1 m hard shoulder each side. Pavement is 3.5 cm asphalt, with 15 cm 
base  and  18  cm  sub-base.  The  road  cuts  through  the  slopes  of  hills  with 
interweaving rock and soil formations. Six small slab bridges (6 m long) are to be 
upgraded, and 2 new medium-size bridges (33 m and 48 m) are to be constructed 
along the route. The P4 adjustment factor for this subproject was an increase of 
62% above the historical baseline value of the one-day maximum rainfall (Table 
57). 
The existing 8-km asphalt road is badly degraded due to traffic volume and the 
axle weight of trucks. The traffic forecast indicates the need for a higher category 
IV road design and the project owner has agreed to apply this during the DED. 
The route passes through some densely populated sections, agricultural fields 
and flat lands. There are 3 existing bridges plus a causeway that will be replaced 
with  a  bridge.  Longitudinal  and  cross  gradients  are  not  high,  and  the  existing 
subgrade has been assessed as suitable. Surfacing will be with asphalt concrete. 
The P4 adjustment factor for this subproject was an increase of 38% above the 
historical baseline value of the one-day maximum rainfall (Table 58). 
The  existing  coastal  road  is  unpaved.  The  road  is  to  be  improved  to  support 
tourism access. Upgrading to category 5 plain road involves widening to 7.5 m, 
adding 2 layers of base (14 cm) and sub-base (16 cm), and surfacing with 7 cm 
of  asphalt  concrete.  When  finished,  the  10.6  km  road  will  have  a  road-top 
elevation ranging from 4.1 to 9.9 m above mean sea level. A new 600-m section 
will provide a commune bypass is to be constructed at the southern end of the 
alignment.  Two  spillway-culvert  crossings  will  be  replaced.  Twenty-eight  new 
culverts are proposed in addition to the 15 existing culverts. The P4 adjustment 
factor for this subproject was an increase of 26% above the historical baseline 
value of the one-day maximum rainfall (Table 58). 
53 Use the decimal value of the percentage increases shown in Tables 4 and 5.

292.  The detailed results of applying the climate change-adjusted P4 design rainfall to the 
cases  above  are  presented  in  Appendix  F.    The  following  case  summaries  highlight  the 
important changes that result from the climate change-adjusted P4 one-day maximum rainfall 
parameter. 
293.  For the Boc Bo - Bang Thanh - Son Lo Road in Bac Kan Province, the design flood 
flow at four small bridge locations was increased by 36% to 119%. Flood water elevations at 
P4 frequency increased by 0.20 to 2.26 meters after adjustment, which will require raising the 
elevation of the road embankment at the corresponding sections. The changes in key design 
parameters of the four small bridges are shown in Table 60.

294.  The recalculation of P4 flood water levels at five flood prone sections along the Dinh 
Son – Anh Son mountain road in Nghe An province resulted in an increase of 0.81 to 0.87 
meter in water elevations. The results for the sections examined are shown in Table 61. At the 
small bridge location in Dong Dau (Km2+108.26), the calculated peak flow increased from 89 
m3/s to 102 m3/s. Calculated floodwater level there at P4 frequency increased from 16.1 m 
using historical data to 16.9 m under RCP 8.5 climate change scenario. The corresponding 
design aperture of the bridge increased from 10.0 m to 12.3 m.

295.  At the Nghe An road subproject, the dimensions of the culverts at 25 locations were 
recalculated with results showing an increase in required culvert sizes at 6 of the 25 locations. 
For example, the calculated design flows at a stream located at Km2+759 increased from 5.17 
to 7.37 m3/sec, resulting in sizing up the dimensions of the slab culvert from 150 x 150 cm to 
200 x 200 cm.  
296.  For the Bao Ninh – Hai Ninh coastal road, the P4 design flows at two culvert sections 
increased by around 34% after applying the P4 climate change adjustment. The flood water 
elevations increased by 0.5 to 0.6 meter, which imply a need to correspondingly raise the level 
of  the  road  embankment  to  provide  adequate  freeboard.  The  flow  velocities  at  these  two 
culvert locations increased by around 10%, indicating need to strengthen the culvert aprons 
and wing walls. 
163 
  Additional DED guidelines for climate resilience 
297.  As  discussed  above,  preliminary  engineering specifications for the road subprojects 
(and associated bridges), which were assessed to be the most vulnerable to climate change 
impact and which account for 75 to 80% of the project investment cost, need to be re-assessed 
during  DED  to  check  for  robustness  to  higher  design  floods,  based  on  hydro-climate 
projections derived from modeling. This adjustment is deemed as the most important climate 
resilience measure for the project. 
298.  Other road structure vulnerabilities were identified in the climate risk and vulnerability 
assessments done earlier for BIIG-1 and BIIG-2 which examined representative subprojects 
to identify specific concerns and corresponding response measures.  
299.  The  most  important  of these  concerns  were found  to  be: (i)  culvert  placements  and 
their fortification against increased water flows, (ii) road foundation strength and provisions to 
prevent water ingress and consequent structural deformation that would eventually extend to 
the  surface  pavement, (iii)  slope  stabilization  for cut  sections  and  road  embankment sides, 
and (iv) provision of proper end-outfalls for lateral ditches. These concerns are related directly 
or indirectly to a critical climate change indicator identified in the CRVA—that of significantly 
increased future rainfall intensity as projected by models. 
300.  Another critical climate change indicator identified in the CRVA is increased heat wave 
duration. Climate modeling projections indicate longer durations of very hot weather (above 
35oC), which is likely to have an impact on the required operating stiffness of flexible/asphalt 
pavements, and consequently their durability and resistance to deformation. 
301.  A list of other road component structures found vulnerable to climate change impact, 
including recommended measures to be taken during DED is provided in Table 62.

302.  The  existing  standard—in  particular  TCVN  4054:2005  and  the  technical  branch 
standards referenced there—already specify measures for road construction that address the 
concerns above. These measures have been applied in the preliminary engineering design of 
representative  subprojects.  However,  those  preliminary  designs  were  carried  out  without 
detailed  information  on  the  projected  changes  in  critical  climate  parameters,  notably  the 
intensity  of  rainfall  which  is  a  key  input  to  the  engineering  formulas  used  in  designing 
structures. As such, the preliminary designs need to be adjusted, as illustrated in the three 
subproject  cases  described  above.  Also,  the  engineering  safety  measures  specified  in  the 
standard that are relevant to climate resilience are only generally described; they would need 
to be elaborated or enhanced during the detailed engineering design work itself. 
303. 
Items that need to be addressed more closely during the DED to incorporate climate 
change risk, with reference to the existing standard and to the critical climate parameters that 
need to be adjusted in applying the engineering guidelines and formulas, are explained below. 
304.  Culvert  placements.  Strengthened  culvert  foundations  are  important  in  view  of 
increased water volumes and velocities associated with intensified future rainfall projected by 
climate models (see, for example, Table 61 on the Bac Kan subproject case).  Fortification of 
culvert  sections  in  contact  with  fast-flowing  water  will  be  important,  particularly  their 
foundation,  aprons  and  wing  walls.  TCVN  4054:2005  specifies  various  engineering 
safeguards for constructing culverts (e.g., provision of drop water structures or chutes below 
the culverts at steep locations; see Section 9), which are adequate as long as the calculated 
water  flow  volumes  and  water  velocities  are  adjusted  for  higher  rainfall  intensities.  Design 
enhancement options include extended culvert aprons with anchor toes to prevent scouring 
and weakening of the culvert bedding and the area surrounding the culvert placement. 
305.  The existing TCVN requirements for culverts specify minimum size at 0.75 m diameter. 
However, it is recommended that the DED examine feasibility of increasing the culvert sizes 
to at least 1 meter in flood-prone sections with high silt and debris loads, not just to discharge 
water more quickly but to also facilitate cleaning and removal of soil deposits and debris. 
165 
306.  Road foundations. The structural requirements and engineering safeguard measures 
identified  in  TCVN  4054:2005  (plus  the  referenced  branch  standards  in  22TCN  171  and 
22TCN 262) for designing road embankments under different soil and geologic conditions are 
adequate as long as the design flood water levels are properly adjusted for climate change.54 
The standard also provides for measures to stabilize sections with high embankment slopes 
for protection from scouring. Runoff calculations to estimate erosion rates, and for assessing 
slope  stability,  should  take  into  account  increased  rainfall  intensities  (in  addition  to  soil 
characteristics and other parameters). For critical slopes identified, additional measures to be 
considered  during  DED  may  involve  reinforcing  critical  sections,  supporting  with  retaining 
structures  or  landslide  guard  walls,  and  reforming  cut  areas  with  surface  soil  layer  and 
vegetation cover.  
307.  Soil  types  suitable  as  subgrade  fill  for  road  embankments,  including  the  minimum 
clearance  between  the  subgrade  level  and  the  surrounding  standing  water  level  (or  water 
table)  are  specified  in  Table  22  of  TCVN  4054:2005.  The  specifications  depend  on  the 
estimated length of consecutive days to which the structure is exposed to high water level, 
which is likely to increase with climate change and should be accounted for during the DED. 
308.  Slope stabilization. The standard provides various structural measures for stabilizing 
embankment slopes and road-cut to protect from erosion and risk of collapse (refer also to 
22TCN  262).  Additional  or  complementary  measures  to  reduce  infiltration,  enhance  slope 
drainage  and  integrity,  including  the  use  of  plants  should  be  considered  during  the  DED. 
Appropriate  measures  that  been  field  tested  and  evaluated  for  effectiveness  should  be 
applied.55  
309.  Lateral  ditches.    These  should  be  checked  during  DED  for  proper  provision  of 
discharge outlets at their ends to prevent the ditches from concentrating runoff water that may 
penetrate  through  cracks  and  saturate  the road foundation,  which  leads  to  weakening  and 
reflected deformation and cracks on the road surface.56 Section 9.1 of TCVN 4054:2005 on 
planning  of  road  drainage  facilities  does  not  specifically  address  such  measure,  and  this 
should be brought to the attention of the DED teams. 
310.  Asphalt  pavements.  Specifications  on  flexible  pavements  are  specified  in  branch 
standard 22TCN 211 which dates back to 1993 (and as referenced by TCVN 4054:2005). The 
DED should re-assess the sensitivity of the asphalt stiffness to temperatures projected to be 
higher than those recorded in the past. Potential problems that should be examined during 
DED include migration of liquid asphalt under prolonged hot weather. Heat wave duration, as 
indicated by the number of consecutive days with temperature exceeding 35°C, is projected 
by climate models to increase. 
311.  The  quality  of  asphalt  material  used  in  road  construction  and  maintenance  is  an 
important resilience measure. The detailed engineering design of flexible pavements should 
incorporate developments in asphalt technology to check for modified binders that improve 
the performance of asphalt under increasingly hot weather.  
54 As specified in TCVN 4054:2005 (Section 7.3.2), the design elevation of  the pavement edge of road sections 
running along riverbanks, approaches to small bridges, culverts, and flooded fields must be at least 0.50m higher 
than the flood water level at the design frequency specified for the type of structure.

Case  studies  from  the  Northern  mountainous  region.  ADB  CDTA  on  Promoting  Climate  Resilient  Rural 
Infrastructure in Northern Viet Nam, May 2017. Four demonstration sites in Northern Vietnam provinces were 
set up in this study: two sites on riverside slope management (in Son La and Bac Kan); and two roadside slope 
management (in Son La and Thai Nguyen). 
56 Traffic loading is the most important factor influencing pavement performance, and the effect is compounded if 
the foundation becomes saturated because it then loses its ability to adequately support traffic loads, leading to 
premature pavement failure. 
166 
312.  Branch  standard  22TCN  334:2005  (as  referenced  by  TCVN  4054:2005)  provides 
technical  specifications  for  construction  of  macadam  foundations  in  highway  pavement 
structures. For asphalt roads, the DED should further check measures for proper base and 
sub-base compaction and moisture conditions during road construction. The quality of gravel 
materials including thickness of the layers to ensure durable performance should be checked 
and,  if  necessary,  adjusted  for  projected  increased  exposure  to  surrounding  water  or  high 
water tables (in addition to traffic loads). 
313.  Concrete  pavements.  Based  on  follow-on  geological  survey  work  during  DED, 
concrete  pavement  should  be  considered  in  low-lying  areas  where  the  road  structure  is 
vulnerable to water penetration due to more frequent flooding associated with changing rainfall 
regimes.  
314.  Coastal structures. The river port infrastructure subproject in BIIG-2 should be checked 
for adequate clearance of vital components (e.g., the port’s generators) above water level that 
will likely be higher than levels indicated in frequency analysis of past data on maximum tide 
and surge levels. 
315. 
Irrigation water use efficiency. For the irrigation subprojects, resilience to future water 
scarcity  requires thinking  beyond  new  water  supply  measures.  DED  should combine  water 
supply  measures  with provisions  for  increased  efficiency  in water  use.  Numerous  technical 
innovations and management measures are available that can improve the efficiency of water 
use for irrigated agriculture (e.g., lining of canals to reduce seepage, irrigation scheduling to 
prevent farmers from over-irrigating, and improved rice planting and irrigation methods through 
use of the system of rice intensification or SRI57, among others). 
316.  Shifting to high-value crops—such as safe vegetables, herbs and spices--that are less 
water-intensive than traditional rice farming, which is already planned to be promoted under 
the subproject, should also be considered as a climate resilience measure in the design of 
cropping systems for agricultural development subprojects.  
317.  Water supply catchments should be provided with adequate natural vegetation cover 
to protect from projected future increase in both rainfall intensity and erosivity. Measures to 
reduce stream erosion—such as through bio-engineering measures that use combinations of 
live plants and inert structures, and also through construction of check dams and sediment 
basins—should be considered in the DED to prevent reservoirs from prematurely filling with 
sediment.  
57  SRI  is  based  on  four  management  principles  that  interact  with  each  other:  (i)  early,  quick  and  healthy  plant 
establishment; (ii) reduced plant density; (iii) improved soil conditions through enrichment with organic matter; 
and (iv) reduced and controlled water application.

APPENDIX A: CLIMATE MODELING 
A. 
Climate change modeling 
318.  Assessing  exposure to climate  change  hazards depends  on  predicting the  direction 
and  magnitude  of  climate  change.  Climate  change  projections  are  based  on  plausible 
scenarios for possible future greenhouse gas emissions as driven by population, technology 
and socio-economic factors. Several climate groups develop models as a means of informing 
climate change policy options and providing information on risks arising from climate change. 
Each model uses different assumptions both in terms of the scope of the underlying physics, 
datasets, and relationships of variables, and as a result often generate differing projections. 
This reflects the inherent uncertainty that prevails in both knowledge of climate variables and 
in the pathways through which Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emission levels will be defined. Such 
uncertainty  positions  climate  change  model  outputs  as  possible  scenarios,  as  opposed  to 
definitive predictors of future climate.58   
319.  The  increasing  importance  of  climate  change  has  led  to  significant  advances  in 
scientific understanding resulting in increased complexity of climate modeling techniques to 
reduce  or  understand  future  climate  projections.  The  challenge,  however,  is  that  climate 
projections are mostly globally defined, reflecting the global circulation models that underpin 
climate science -- yet the actions required to mitigate GHG emissions and adapt to climate 
change impacts are mostly local. The scale differences between these remain a significant 
challenge increasing the uncertainty of local level information.  
320.  Managing  uncertainty  is  a  priority  in  the  ongoing  development  of  climate  change 
science. Models are selected that reflect a study region’s dominant climate features, especially 
for  climate  parameters  that  are  expected  to  have  the  most  impact.  Assessing  uncertainty 
involves characterizing the range of probable outcomes examined either through multiple runs 
of the same model under different initial conditions, or through using multiple models i.e., an 
ensemble of models. An ensemble enables produces multiple projections that can be used to 
develop a probability distribution that in turn can be used to quantify the likelihood of climate 
change outcomes.59  
321.  When  the  projection  from  several  models  are  combined,  the  resultant  average  has 
often  been found to  be a better  correlate of  actual  observations, than for the  output  of  any 
individual model as it includes “more information”. Nonetheless, climate model projections are 
all driven by assumptions and need to be interpreted with caution considering the underlying 
uncertainty.60

Assessment Report. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Cambridge University Press. 
59  Likelihood  levels in  terms  of  percentiles  are derived  from climate change projections  that  draw  from multiple 
models, that is, the multiple model results are aggregated using percentile ranking. The 10th percentile value, 
for example, means that 90% of the models predict values equal to or higher than that percentile value. At the 
other end, the 90th percentile value means that 10% of the models predict values equal to or higher than that 
value. Hence, one can say that there is an 80% likelihood that the actual value falls between the 10th and 90th 
percentile values. 
60 A primer on how climate models work and how projections are interpreted is available at the website of the US 
National  Research  Council's  Board  on  Atmospheric  Sciences  and  Climate:  http://nas-sites.org/climate-
change/climatemodeling. For a more technical description, refer to Chapter 9 of the IPCC’s Assessment Report 
No. 5 (2013): Evaluation of Climate Models.

B. 
Greenhouse Gas Emission Scenarios 
322.  Future  GHG  emissions  and  CO2  concentration  scenarios  used  in  climate  change 
modeling are defined by the Inter-Governmental Panel of Climate Change (IPCC). After 2007, 
the IPCC produced so-called “Representative Concentration Pathways” (RCPs) scenarios to 
provide  flexibility  in  exploring  the  influence  of  policy  choices,  specifically  regarding  cuts  in 
greenhouse gas emissions. The RCPs are identified by their total radiative forcing, measured 
in watts per square meter (W/m2) in 2100 relative to 1750.61  Essentially, the RCP’s describe 
the  degree  to  which  GHG  emissions  are  actively  mitigated,  stabilized  or  increased  and the 
resultant atmospheric CO2 concentrations.62  
323.  The four RCP scenarios span the range of plausible radiative forcing values, from 2.6 
to 8.5 W/m2. One scenario (RCP2.6) leads to a very low forcing level, two medium stabilization 
scenarios  (RCP4.5  and  RCP6)  and  one  high  emission  scenario  (RCP8.5).63   Note  that  the 
RCPs were independently developed by different climate modeling groups that used different 
mathematical  representations  of  the  climate  system  and  are,  strictly  speaking,  not  directly

In the latest IPCC (fifth) Assessment Report (2013), the RCP scenarios were used to 
generate  projections  to  reflect  the  likely  outcomes  of  differing  global  policy  choices  for 
mitigating GHG emissions.  Table 63 shows the associated radiative forcing of each scenario, 
the projected atmospheric CO2 concentration, and the corresponding representative climate 
policy.

          RCP = representative concentration pathway, CO2 = carbon dioxide, W = watts, m2 = square meter  
325.  Note that there is no preferred single climate change scenario for use in climate change 
impact studies. The IPCC does not give recommendations on which RCP scenario is more 
likely to materialize, and there are no weightings applied to the RCPs. Hence, no conclusions 
are made in climate change studies about the most probable future scenario outcome. Rather, 
a  range  of  scenarios  representing  high  and  low  CO2  concentration  levels  (sometimes 
described as pessimistic and optimistic scenarios) are included in climate change simulations 
to test the “robustness” of adaptation measures.  
61 Radiative forcing is the additional energy taken up by the climate system due to enhanced greenhouse effect. It 
measures the difference in the balance of energy that enters the atmosphere and the amount that is returned to 
space (compared to the pre-industrial baseline). 
62 The word “representative” signifies that each RCP represents a larger set of scenarios compatible with the range 
of emission scenarios found in the scientific literature. The term “concentration pathway” means that these RCPs 
are  not  fully  integrated  scenarios  yet,  but  instead  are  internally  consistent  sets  of  emission  trajectories  and 
corresponding radiative forcing. The results are used in subsequent phases of modeling to explore impact of 
socio-economic and policy choices. The use of the word “concentration” also means that CO2 concentrations 
are used as the primary product of the RCPs, which serve as input to more fully integrated climate models. Unlike 
the previous generation of scenarios—the SRES scenarios--no fixed sets of assumptions relating to population 
growth, economic development, or technology are associated with any RCP. 
63 Note, by way of perspective, that the global net effect of human activities since 1750 has been estimated as 
being equivalent to a radiative forcing of 0.6 to 2.4 W/m2.

326.  Within the context of climate risk to infrastructure, and specifically rural roads and water 
supply schemes, the economic life of proposed infrastructure is relatively short reflecting the 
category of road, and the expected traffic forecast and as well as expected traffic growth. Most 
BIIG-1 and BIIG-2 road infrastructure has an economic life of 12 to 15 years. Thus, the relevant 
projections are up to mid-2030s. 
327.  Up to the mid-2030s, the climate change risk to the road infrastructure are expected to 
be  relatively  consistent  across  all four  RCP  scenarios,  since  up  to  about  the  mid-2030s  all 
RCP scenarios have relatively similar projected atmospheric CO2 concentrations – see Figure 
1. 
328.  By  mid-century  (circa  2050)  the  4  RCP  scenarios  indicate  increasing  divergence  in 
atmospheric  CO2  concentrations  and  the  commensurate  divergence  in  climate  projections.  
This is explained by the fact that prior to 2040, projected changes in global climate are largely 
driven by the warming that is already “in the pipeline”, that is, the atmospheric concentrations 
faced is already largely known based on past emissions of greenhouse gases and as such 
the uncertainty introduced from future GHG atmospheric concentration is limited. In contrast, 
warming after mid-century is strongly dependent on the future levels of GHG emissions that 
will be determined by still uncertain global policy actions. 
Figure 9. Projected CO2 concentration under various RCPs  
Source: IPCC (2013); also showed are projections from the earlier set of SRES scenarios. 
329. 
In terms of atmospheric CO2 concentrations, the two RCP scenarios of interest (RCP 
4.5  which  represents  moderate  warming  trajectory,  and  RCP  8.5  which  represents  strong 
warming)  do  not  actually  differ  much  up  to  about  2040s.  But  thereafter,  CO2  concentration 
levels  under  RCP  4.5  peak  and  stabilize,  whereas  RCP  8.5 keeps rising.  Since  we're  only 
projecting up to 2030s for BIIG planning, the two scenarios are relatively similar in terms of 
GHG emissions. As such the choice of RCP will have little impact and, after a data quality 
review, the RCP 8.5 scenario was considered more reliable. 
330.  For purposes of deriving adjustment factors for extreme rainfall to guide the detailed 
engineering design  of  BIIG  infrastructure  subprojects  (at  P4 frequency),  it  is recommended 
that RCP 8.5 associated with a higher projected atmospheric GHG concentration by 2030s be 
adopted. This RCP represents the most conservative outlook on global management of GHG 
171 
emissions.64  Nevertheless, for the profiling of climate change in the eight project provinces 
presented in Appendix B, projections derived from both RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios are 
provided.  
C. 
Regional downscaling methods 
331.  Global Climate Models produce projections at very large scale with coarse projections 
that are informative in the terms of overall global risk but provide limited information at lower 
levels  of  aggregation  such  as  national,  provincial  or  local  level.  With  the  need  to  mitigate 
climate change risk, increasingly local-level actions are required. To inform such programs it 
is  necessary  to  provide  projections  at  lower  scales  by  “downscaling”  from  global  model 
projections. Downscaling is used to take information generated at larger scales and to use this 
to make local projections.  
The  National  Center  for  Atmospheric  Research  (USA)  defines  two  main 
approaches to downscaling of climate information as dynamical and statistical.  
Dynamical  downscaling  requires  running  high-resolution  climate  models  on  a 
regional  sub-domain,  using  observational  data  or  lower-resolution  climate  model 
output as a boundary condition.  These models use physical principles to reproduce 
local climates, but are computationally intensive.   
Statistical downscaling is a two-step process consisting of i) the development of 
statistical relationships between local climate variables (e.g., surface air temperature 
and  precipitation)  and  large-scale  predictors  (e.g.,  pressure  fields),  and  ii)  the 
application of such relationships to the output of global climate model experiments to 
simulate local climate characteristics in the future. 
Source: https://gisclimatechange.ucar.edu 
In dynamical downscaling high-resolution simulation models extrapolate from the GCM 
332. 
to regional or local levels. A regional climate model (e.g., PRECIS) is applied to a delineated 
area in which the boundary conditions are generated or “driven” by a parent GCM. Dynamical 
downscaling is based on physical laws with the advantage of being able to produce a large 
variety  of  climate  variables.   The  disadvantage  of this  method  is computational  complexity, 
which limits the number of GCMs that can be downscaled. 
333.  Statistical  downscaling,  on  the  other  hand,  uses  statistical  methods  to  define  the 
relationships between data at the larger scale and then use these relationships to transform 
GCM  outputs  to  local  scale.  Since  it  is  not  dependent  on  specifying  complex  physical 
relationships, statistical downscaling is not as computationally demanding.65 However, it can 
only generate a smaller set of climate variables. 
334.  Downscaled climate projections are adjusted to match the statistical properties of the 
observed climate—a process known as “bias correction.”  This correction is done so that the 
climate simulation for the historical period statistically matches the actual observations. The 
correction factor derived is then applied to the future projections from the climate model.66  
64  “Conservative”  regarding  what  can  be  done  to  reduce  global  GHG  emissions,  still  faced  with  difficulties  to 
effectively address the threat (e.g., US pullout from the Paris climate accord). 
65  Several  statistical  approaches  can  be  used  for  downscaling  including  limited  area  modelling,  stochastic 
modelling, pattern based weather approaches and regression analysis. The least computationally demanding of 
these, regression is generally preferred. 
66 The climate modeling cells used by MoNRE to represent the provinces were selected to overlap with the locations 
of Class-1 hydrometeorological stations; this enables bias-correction to be done on the baseline modeling data 
with reference to historical observations.

335.  Regional Climate Models were used by MoNRE’s Institute of Meteorology, Hydrology 
and Environment, with support from CSIRO/AusAid, to produce high-resolution projections of 
climate change for Vietnam using nine GCMs from the latest set of global models endorsed 
by the IPCC, namely:  NorESM1-M, CNRM-CM5, GFDL-CM3, HadGEM2-ES, ACCESS1-0, 
MPI-ESM-LR, NCARSST, HadGEM2-SST and GFDL-SST.

from  ICTP  –  Italy,  and  (v)  the  clWRF  model  from  Santander  Meteorology  Group  –  Spain 
provides provincial level forecasts. There were 16 computational cases (model-runs) in total. 
Statistical  methods  were  applied  for  bias-correction  of  the  model  baseline  outputs  with 
reference to observed data. See Table 64.

APPENDIX B: PROJECTED CLIMATE CHANGE IN PROJECT PROVINCES68 
A. 
Increase in temperature 
339.  According to MoNRE, average annual temperatures throughout the country increased 
by  0.62°C  from  1958  to  2014,  at  an  average  of  approximately  0.1°C  per  decade.  Extreme 
temperatures are projected to increase in all climate zones. The number of hot days (maximum 
temperatures exceeding 35°C) show increasing trends in most of the country.  
340.  Under  Scenario  RCP  8.5  the  projected  average  temperature  increase  in  BIIG-1 
provinces  is  1.1°C  and  2.2°C,  for  early  and  mid-century,  respectively.  For  BIIG-2,  the 
corresponding average increase is 0.9°C and 1.9°C, respectively. 
341.  Although changes in average temperature increases are modest, the projected change 
in extreme temperatures  is  more  significant.  Heat  wave occurrence, (defined as  number  of 
consecutive  days  with  maximum  temperatures  exceeding  35°C),  is  projected  to  increase 
across all the BIIG provinces. For temperature, changes projected from 8 downscaled GCMs 
using data obtained from MoNRE are summarized in Table 65.69

Increase in rainfall intensity 
342.  Across  Viet  Nam rainfall  is  projected  to increase.  Under  RCP  4.5,  by  early  century, 
annual  rainfall  is  projected  to  increase  by  5 to  10%  relative  to  1986-2005.  By  mid-century, 
rainfall would increase 5 to 15% overall. Under RCP 8.5, the projected increase is of roughly 
the same magnitude. Projected change in 1-day and 5-day maximum rainfall are higher than 
annual changes, increasing by 10 to 70% relative to 1986-2005. 
343.  For BIIG-1 provinces, observations from inland stations during 1961 to 2010 indicate 
a slight decreasing trend in annual rainfall. In BIIG-2 corresponding station observations show 
almost no change in annual rainfall. But future rainfall is generally projected to increase in all 
project  provinces.  In  terms  of  percentage  change  relative  to  reference  period  (1986-2005), 
mean values derived from climate modeling are shown in Table 66.70  
68 Additional information on climate change projections for BIIG-1 and BIIG-2 are provided in the Climate Risk and 
Vulnerability Assessment report for each subregion. 
69 The eight GCMs were: CCAM-CCSM4, CCAM-CNRM-CM5, CCAM-GFDL-CM3, CCAM-NorESM1-M, clWRF-
NorESM1-M,  PRECIS-CNRM-CM5,  PRECIS-GFDL-CM3,  PRECIS-HadGEM2-ES.  Three  regional  climate 
models were used to downscale these eight GCMs: CCAM, cIWRF and PRECIS. CCAM was used on 4 GCMs; 
cIWRF was used on 1 GCM; and PRECIS was used on 3 GCMs. 
70 The ranges of projections with reference to 10% and 90% percentile values (i.e., 80% confidence interval) are 
shown in the CRVA reports for BIIG-1 and BIIG-2.

during  occurrences  of  typhoons  predicted  to  become  stronger.  Percentage  changes  in  the

*Colored values for RCP 4.5 appear incongruent for BIIG-1; the projected mid-century values are lower than for early-century, 
even as the projected annual rainfall is projected to increase as shown in Table 12. Modeled baseline values refer to period 
1986-2005, averaged from 3 climate models. 
C.  Sea level rise 
345.  Sea levels at coastal monitoring stations of Vietnam rose by about 2.45 mm/yr during 
the period 1960-2014. From 1993 to 2014, the rate of SLR had increased to 3.34 mm/yr. The 
largest increase in average sea level  was found along the central coast at 4 mm/yr. Under 
RCP 4.5, the average sea level rise for coastal areas nationally is projected to be about 22 cm 
by mid-century while under RCP 8.5, the projected average SLR is 25 cm.72 
71 Of the 5 regional climate models used by  MoNRE to downscale various global climate models, PRECIS was 
noted to be the most reliable according to the Ministry’s 2016 Report on Climate Change and Sea Level Rise 
Scenarios  for  Vietnam  (page  39,  full  report  in  Vietnamese).  In  this  PPTA  study,  data  from  the  PRECIS 
downscaling of 3 GCMs were used: CNRM-CM5, GFDL-CM3 and HadGEM2-ES. The tabulated values are the 
average from the 3 downscaled GCMs. Among these GCMs, MoNRE informants indicated that CNRM-CM5 was 
the most “stable” (i.e., the variability of the projections is not too wide compared to the other 2 GCMs). This GCM 
was used to set the baseline for the extreme value frequency analysis of maximum one-day rainfall projections 
shown in Annex E. 
72 With 80% of models predicting in the range of 14 to 32 cm and 17 to 35 cm, respectively.

regions from Hon Dau near Hai Phong in the north to Deo Hai Van near Danang to the south.

347.  Storm surge is a rise in sea level due to the impact of typhoons or tropical depressions. 
In the coastal area between Nghe An and Ha Tinh, the observed highest storm surge was 400 
cm. MoNRE has estimated that the highest storm surge in this coastal stretch is likely to be 
450 cm. Between Quang Binh and Hue, the highest observed storm surge was 300 cm, and 
MoNRE’s estimate of the highest possible surge that can occur along this coast is 350 cm.

APPENDIX C: HYDROLOGICAL COMPUTATION FORMULAS 
348.  For  traffic  structures,  the  calculation  of  flood  characteristics  is  specified  in  legacy 
documents  and  guidance  documents  over  the  past  years.  For  example,  the  standard  on 
“calculation of  design hydrological  characteristics”  - QP.TL.  C-6-77  has  been  applied  since 
1977.  In  1996  the  calculation  of  flood  characteristics  was  improved  based  on  the  branch 
standard  22-TCN  220-1995.  Currently,  these  legacy  regulations  and  standards  has  been 
consolidated in a national standard, TCVN 9845:2013. 
349.  Specifications  for  the  design  flood  frequency  to  be  used  for  various  transportation 
works are stipulated in TCVN 4054:2005 and TCVN 5729:2012. However, TCVN 5729:2012 
applies  only  to  expressway  projects.  TCVN  4054:2005  is  the  most  relevant  to  the  road 
classifications under BIIG-1 and BIIG-2. For hydraulic calculations related to bridge works, the 
MoT branch standard 22TCN 272:2005 is still applied, even as the specifications there have 
been incorporated in the more recent national standard, TCVN 9845:2013. 
350.  To  calculate  the  flood  characteristics,  various  parameters  are  used  including  the 
watershed area, watershed morphology, characteristics of soils and rocks, vegetation cover 
in  the  watershed,  and  the  rainfall  intensity  corresponding  to  a  frequency  or  return  period 
specified for the structure’s design flood level (as specified in TCVN 4054:2005). 
351. 
In brief, the calculation of the flood characteristics for traffic structures is conducted as 
follows:  based  on  TCVN  4050-2005,  determine  which  flood  frequency  is  applicable  for  the 
category of road and the type of component structure. Then apply the formula to estimate the 
design  flood  level,  as  specified  in  TCVN  9845:2013.  Use  the  one-day  maximum  rainfall 
corresponding to the design flood frequency specified for the structure. 
352.  TCVN 9845:2013 specifies the methodology for calculating flood flow characteristics 
caused by heavy rain for small structures on rivers that are not impacted by the tide and not 
associated with mud/rock flows. According to this standard, the calculation of the design flood 
peak for a given watershed can be based on one of the following formulas: 
  For a watershed with area smaller than 100 km2, it is possible to use the “Limited 
Strength” formula. 
  For a watershed with area exceeding 100 km2, it is possible to use the “Discount” 
formula. 
  In  addition  to  using  the  formulas  above  for  medium  and  large  watersheds,  it  is 
advised to compare the calculated results with other methods such as modeling of 
the river section and other approaches (Section 5.1 TCVN 9845-2013, Page 10).

APPENDIX D: STATISTICAL MODELING USING EXTREME VALUE ANALYSIS 
A. 
Extreme Value Theory 
361.  Changes  in  extreme  events  is  assessed  using  extreme  value  theory  to  calculate 
extreme quantiles (depicted by the cumulative distribution function) for different periods, both 
past and future. Specifically, the theory is used to estimate the intensity and frequency of rare 
events  that  lie  far  in  the  tails  of  the  probability  distribution.  The  most  common  approach 
involves fitting a statistical model to the annual extreme values in the time series data.  
362.  The application of this classic theory assumes that the time series being analyzed is 
“stationary”, that is, the statistical parameters (mean and variance) are constant for the time 
series.73  In  using  projected  climate  data  that  cover  several  periods  (e.g.,  baseline,  early 
century, mid-century) it is assumed that the time series is stationary within any one period. As 
such the periods being assessed need to be sufficiently spaced to provide detectable changes 
in  statistical  parameters  across  periods.  For  the  purpose  of  climate  change  impacts  the 
MoNRE  databases  use a  baseline  time  series  covering  1986-2005;  early-century  period  of 
2016-2035; and mid-century of 2046-2065. 
363.  Extreme value analysis (EVA) requires putting together a sample of extreme values 
obtained by selecting the maximum value observed in each time block (e.g., year or season). 
Statistical tests confirm that the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution is appropriate 
for block maximum values.74 
364.  This  analysis  procedure  can  be  applied  to  both  modeled  climate  data  and  actual 
historical data on selected climate parameters, in this case one-day maximum rainfall. 
365.  Theoretically, although very long period return values can be calculated from the fitted 
probability distribution (say, for 100-year return period), the confidence that can be placed in 
the  results  is  low  if  the  length  of  the  return  period  is  substantially  greater  than  the  period 
covered by the sample of extremes (in our case, 20 years). Estimating return levels for very 
long  return  periods  is  prone  to  large  sampling  errors  and  potentially  large  biases  due  to 
uncertainty  about  of  the  actual  shape  of  the  tails  of  the  probability  distribution.  Generally, 
confidence in return levels decreases rapidly when the period is more than about two times 
the length of the time series data.75 
366.  Statistical  extreme  value  analysis  comes  with  uncertainty—in  this  case,  associated 
with the estimation of the statistical model parameters.76 Thus, on top of the climate modeling 
uncertainty described earlier, statistical modeling of extreme events derived from the climate 
modeling results creates an additional layer of uncertainty.  
B. 
Fitting of Probability Distribution 
367. 
Identifying  the  best-fitted  probability  distribution  to  an  extreme  value  time  series 
involves  applying  goodness-of-fit  tests.  These  tests  measure  the  compatibility  of  the  time 
73 It also assumes that the statistical parameters are “homogenous” or unchanging over the area of interest. 
74 Another method using “peaks over threshold” (POT) values to assemble data on exceedances above a specified 
threshold. For this method, a generalized Pareto distribution is generally found to be the best-fitting statistical 
distribution function.

informed decisions for adaptation. WMO Climate Data and Monitoring WCDMP-No. 72, 2009. 
76 Uncertainty may be related to the statistical techniques, but depend particularly on the sample series length for 
extremes  analysis.  The  fitted  probability  distribution  is  also  very  sensitive  to  inclusion  or  exclusion  of  outlier 
values.

series with the theoretical probability distribution function, i.e., to test if a sample of data came 
from a population with a specific probability distribution. 
368.  To  construct  the  statistical  model  for  the  one-day  maximum  rainfall,  we  fitted  10 
probability distributions to samples of time series derived from the climate modeling data on 
one-day  annual  maximum  rainfalls.  The  Kolmogorov-Smirnov  and  Anderson-Darling  tests 
were used along with the chi-square test at 0.01 level of significance to identify the best-fitting 
probability distribution.77  The candidate distributions were ranked from (highest) 1 to 10 based 
on lowest t-statistic value. The probability distribution with consistent high ranking using the 
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was selected. 
369.  The  Generalized  Extreme  Value  distribution  represents  the  best  fit  to  data.    The 
goodness-of-fit test served to validate the recommended statistical model in the literature on 
extreme value analysis. Then we applied this model to calculate exceedance probabilities and 
corresponding return periods. 
370.  The  GEV  distribution  is  a  three-parameter  model  with  the  following  probability 
distribution  function,  where  z=(x-μ)/σ,  and  k,  σ,  μ  are  the  shape,  scale  and  location 
parameters,  respectively.  The  scale  must  be  positive  (sigma>0),  whereas  the  shape  and 
location can take on any real value. 
371.  The range of definition of the GEV probability distribution depends on the value of the 
shape parameter k: 
372.  The parameters of the GEV probability distribution function are estimated from the time 
series (e.g., a 20-year record of annual maximum daily rainfall).78  Estimated GEV parameters 
are applied to generate, first, the probability density function using the formula above—and 
from it, the cumulative distribution function. The cumulative distribution function is then used 
to calculate the annual exceedance probabilities and corresponding return periods.79 The latter 
refers to the probability that an event is equaled or exceeded in any single year. The return 
period is the reciprocal of the exceedance probability. 
373.  After  estimating  the  parameters  of  the  GEV  probability  distribution,  the  probabilistic 
model was used to compare the return period of baseline and future extreme rainfall. 
374.  Theoretically, although very long period return values can be calculated from the fitted 
probability distribution (say, for 100-year return period), the confidence that can be placed in 
the  results  is  low  if  the  length  of  the  return  period  is  substantially  greater  than  the  period 
77 The Anderson-Darling test is just a modification of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test. It gives more weight to 
the distribution tails than does the K-S test. We placed more weight on the result of the K-S test in selecting the 
best-fitting distribution. 
78 Open source statistical modeling packages are available to automate fitting of probability distribution functions, 
such as the programming language R (www.r-project.org). Commercial packages are also available, such as 
EasyFit (www.mathwave.com), which can be linked to MS Excel. 
79 The exceedance probability is 1 minus the cumulative probability at any given point (x) in the distribution.

covered by the sample of extremes (in our case, 20 years). Estimating return levels for very 
long  return  periods  is  prone  to  large  sampling  errors  and  potentially  large  biases  due  to 
uncertainty  about  of  the  actual  shape  of  the  tails  of  the  probability  distribution.  Generally, 
confidence in return levels decreases rapidly when the period is more than about two times 
the length of the time series data.80 
375.  As  with  climate  modeling  uncertainty,  statistical  extreme  value  analysis  comes  with 
uncertainty—in this case, associated with the estimation of the statistical model parameters.81 
Thus,  on  top  of  the  climate  modeling  uncertainty  described  earlier,  statistical  modeling  of 
extreme  events  derived  from  the  climate  modeling  results  creates  an  additional  layer  of 
uncertainty.  It  is  important  to  recognize  this  propagation  of  uncertainty  throughout  the 
modeling process in interpreting findings. 
376. 
Identifying  the  best-fitted  probability  distribution  to  an  extreme  value  time  series 
involves  applying  goodness-of-fit  tests.  These  tests  measure  the  compatibility  of  the  time 
series with the theoretical probability distribution function, i.e., to test if a sample of data came 
from a population with a specific probability distribution. 
377.  To  construct  the  statistical  model  for  the  one-day  maximum  rainfall,  we  fitted  10 
probability distributions to samples of time series derived from the climate modeling data on

candidate distributions were ranked from (highest) 1 to 10 based on lowest t-statistic value. 
The  probability  distribution  with consistent  high  ranking using the  Kolmogorov-Smirnov  test 
was selected. A sample goodness-of-fit test results for a time series data set (baseline CNRM 
model run for Bac Kan) is shown below.

APPENDIX G: APPROACH USING HYDRO-DYNAMIC MODELING 
380.  For structural components that require P1 and P2 estimates, such as for medium to large 
bridges, combined application of climate change modeling and hydrological modeling is a suitable 
approach. 
381.  Projections of daily rainfall and relevant atmospheric conditions (e.g., temperature, relative 
humidity) obtained from regional/downscaled climate models can be used as climatic time series 
inputs to hydrologic models to assess future change in flood levels. That is, hydrologic modeling 
results can be compared between simulations using baseline/historical rainfall data and that using 
projected climate data.  
382.  Hydrologic models are available, such as the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) 
and  Hydrologic  Engineering  Center  -  Hydrologic  Modeling  System  (HEC-HMS).  These  are 
designed to simulate the complete hydrologic processes of watershed systems. Data input are 
grouped into five categories: topography, land use, soil, land use management and climate. 
383.  Essentially, a hydrologic model is first calibrated for the subject basin using historical data. 
Then climatic input data (representing a range of modeling results) are fed to the calibrated model 
to assess effects on future river flows (in particular, peak flows used for designing structures) and 
other hydrologic parameters if relevant to the engineering design (e.g., sediment discharge). The 
climate input data, in gridded format, can be obtained from MoNRE.84  
384.  Basin-scale  hydrologic  modeling  requires  gridded  daily  precipitation,  maximum  and 
minimum  temperatures,  and  wind  magnitude  as  input  to  simulate  similarly  gridded  daily  “state 
variables”  such  as  runoff.  Resulting  gridded  runoffs  are  then  hydraulically  routed  to  the  basin 
outlet or a specified location (e.g., bridge site). Use of multiple climate modeling outputs to feed 
the  hydrologic  model  allows  the  assessment  of  uncertainty  around,  say,  a  mean  or  median 
projection, providing quantitative information for risk-based decision making. 
385. 
Impacts  of  potential  climate  change  on  streamflow  can  be  evaluated  by  comparing 
simulations using the rainfall data derived from GCMs (e.g., covering 2016-2035, applicable to 
the operating life of BIIG-1 and BIIG-2 infrastructure subprojects).85 The streamflow projections 
are then compared  with the  baseline runs  of  the model  (using  both observed  historical  rainfall 
data and baseline data generated by models) to assess the significance of change. 
386.  An advantage of using integrated models (e.g., SWAT and HEC-HMS) for climate impact 
analysis of streamflow is that these models can also be used to examine climate change effects 
on  other factors  of  change,  such as  land use  change.  Changes  in vegetation cover  and  basin 
alterations  due  to  population  growth  or  development  activities  (e.g.,  establishment  of  tree 
plantations) can then be considered in projecting future streamflow. 
387.  A  common  problem  with  the  use  of  regional  climate  modeling  outputs  directly  in 
hydrological impact studies is that the simulated rainfall often exhibits biases.86 Bias correction is 
84 Climate modeling data, at daily scale, can also be downloaded from existing data distribution centers, such as the 
one maintained by the World Climate Research Program (WCRP) for the CMIP3 and CMIP5 generation of global 
climate models (http://cmip-pcmdi.llnl.gov/cmip5/data_portal.html). 
85 If there is an adequate number of rainfall time series inputs, the streamflow projections can be presented as percentile 
values to bound the range of uncertainty. 
86  Modeling  biases  can  arise  from  the  internal  physics  used  in  the  model  or  from  the  errors  in  lateral  boundary 
conditions. 
199 
often required to bring model-simulated baseline rainfall in line with the historical observations. 
Such  bias  correction  has  been  applied  to  the  entire  time  series  of  rainfall  in  MoNRE’s  climate 
change database. 
388.  Essentially,  for  the  design  of  bridges  (specifically,  to  determine  the  design  vertical 
clearance from the P1 or P2 flood), the modeling sequence and steps are: 
  First,  set  up  a  basin-scale  hydrological  model  and  calibrate/validate  it  using  observed 
hydro-meteorological data.  
  Second, use results from a high-resolution climate model (e.g., downscaled for the basin 
from a global climate model to determine climate projections for the basin over the analysis 
period (e.g., reference historical period versus operating period of planned infrastructure, 
say,  up  to  2030s).    Outputs  generated  from  the  climate  model  (e.g.  temperature, 
precipitation) are used as input to the hydrological model. 
  Third,  use  a  hydraulic  routing  model  to  convert  projected  basin  runoff  (flow  volumes) 
generated by the hydrologic model to flooding depth at various points in the river network. 
For  example,  the  Hydrologic  Engineering  Center  –  River  Analysis  System  (HEC-RAS, 
which is often used in conjunction with HEC-HMS) is a computer program for modeling 
water flowing through open channels and computing water surface profiles. HEC-RAS is 
particularly applicable for bridge and culvert design and analysis, embankment design, as 
well as river modification studies.87  
389.  An  example  of  this  approach  is  reported  for  a  recent  study  that  investigated  possible 
impacts of climate change on future floods in the VuGia -ThuBon river basin in central Vietnam 
using a multi-model climate ensemble.88 An ensemble of regional climate projections derived from 
different  combinations  of  global  and  regional  climate  models  in  combination  with  different 
greenhouse gas emission scenarios were used.89  
390.  Climate  data  were  used  as  input  to  a  basin  water  balance  model  (WaSIM-ETH)  to 
reproduce discharge data at Nong Son station. Annual maximum discharges were extracted from 
the modeled daily series for the reference period (1980-1999) and future periods (2011-30, 2031-
50,  and  2080-99)  for  use  in  subsequent  extreme  value  frequency  analyses.  To  derive  flood 
frequency curves for the four time periods, the Generalized Extreme Value probability distribution 
was fitted to the data. 
391.  Adjusted  return  periods  were  calculated  based  on  the  delta  change  method.  In  this 
method,  the  observed  extreme  values  were  adjusted  using  the  derived  values  from  the 
hydrological simulations, which in turn were fed by future climate projections.  
392.  The study calculated, on average, an increase for the P1 (or 100-year return period) flood 
magnitude of 4%, 65%, and 94% for 2011-30, 2031-50, and 2080-99, respectively, relative to the 
87 If water allocation, say for water supply or irrigation development, is the purpose of the analysis, an alternative third 
model could be a water accounting model (e.g., WEAP, which stands for Water Evaluation and Planning system). 
Such models can be used to assess the impacts of climate change on water resource availability and water balance 
in the basin. Results of the hydrological modeling (i.e., projections in river flow), in conjunction with projected water 
demands, are used as input to the water accounting model. The model calculates a mass balance of flow sequentially 
down a river system, making allowance for abstractions and inflows. It can be used to simulate alternative scenarios 
comprising different development and management options.

baseline. However, there was a large spread in the simulated peak flood magnitudes derived from 
the different models. Nevertheless, there was agreement among the models towards increased 
future  peak  flows.  Due  to  the  obtained  large  spread  of  simulated  peak  flood  magnitudes,  the 
investigators  stressed  the  need  for  combined  climate  and  hydrological  simulations.  They  also 
noted  that  wide  spread  in  model-projected  flood  magnitudes  remains  a  crucial  problem  for 
decision makers in applying climate change impact assessments, as demonstrated in this case. 
In  another  case  involving  the  Mekong  Delta  Connectivity  Project,90  a  climate  risk  and

vulnerability assessment was by carried out and findings reported in 2015. The project involves 
proposed construction of two large bridges in the Mekong Delta (across the Han River and the 
Tien  River)  that  would  be  linked  by  a  24-km  connecting  road  and  26  small  bridges.  Thirteen 
structural components of the project were examined for climate risk and vulnerability--including 
bridges, road embankments and road drainage structures.  
394.  For this Mekong delta infrastructure project, the most critical climate change impact—as 
in  the  case  also  of  BIIG-1  and  BIIG-2--was  found  to  be  the  likely  changes  in  design  flood 
elevations.  The  climate  risk  assessment  used  rainfall  projections  from  6  GCMs  that  were  run 
under two SRES scenarios (A1B and B2), which were used as input to a hydraulic model for the 
Mekong delta. Modeling results showed that, over a 100-year period, the increase in water level 
at  P1  frequency  on  the  floodplain  induced  by  climate  change  would  reach  0.6  m,  while  the 
increase in flood water level at the Cao Lanh bridge site across the Tien River was estimated to 
reach 0.7 m. Based on these findings, the ICEM study recommended that the design height of 
the road embankments, including the approach embankments to the bridges, be raised by 0.6 m.
