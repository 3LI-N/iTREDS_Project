1.  The  project  administration  manual  (PAM)  describes  the  essential  administrative  and 
management requirements to implement the project on time, within budget, and in accordance 
with  the  Government  of  Mongolia  (government)  and  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) 
policies  and  procedures.  The  PAM  should  include  references  to  all  available  templates  and 
instructions either through linkages to relevant URLs or directly incorporated in the PAM. 
2.  The  Department  of  Protected  Areas  Management  (DPAM),  as  the  executing  agency,  the 
Khuvsgul Lake National Park (KLNP) Administration, as the implementing agency (both being 
under the Ministry of Environment, Green Development and Tourism; MEGDT) and Ministry of 
Finance (MOF), are wholly responsible for the implementation of the project, as agreed jointly 
between  the  grant  recipient  and  ADB,  and  in  accordance  with  the  government  and  ADB’s 
policies  and  procedures.  ADB  staff  is  responsible  to  support  implementation  including 
compliance  by  DPAM,  the  KLNP  Administration,  and  MOF  of  their  obligations  and 
responsibilities for project implementation in accordance with ADB’s policies and procedures. 
3.  At  grant  negotiations,  the  grant  recipient  and  ADB  shall  agree  to  the  PAM  and  ensure 
consistency with the grant agreement. Such agreement shall be reflected in the minutes of the 
grant negotiations. In the event of any discrepancy or contradiction between the PAM and the 
grant agreement, the provisions of the grant agreement shall prevail. 
4.  After ADB Board approval of the project’s report and recommendations of the President (RRP), 
changes in implementation arrangements are subject to agreement and approval pursuant to 
the  government  and  ADB  administrative  procedures  (including  the  project  administration 
instructions) and upon such approval they will be subsequently incorporated in the PAM.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
A. 
Rationale 
The Khuvsgul Lake National Park (KLNP) was established in 1992. It encompasses 
1. 
1.2 million hectares of forests and mountains that surround Khuvsgul Lake, which is one of 
the  world’s  most  important  reservoirs  of  freshwater.  The  lake  has  a  volume  of  380.7 cubic 
kilometers,  and  is  the  largest  freshwater  lake  in  Mongolia.  It  contains  70%  of  Mongolia’s 
freshwater and 1% of global freshwater.1 The water quality is high, and there are no dams. 
Khuvsgul  Lake  is  also  of  transboundary  importance  as  it  drains  via  the  country’s  largest 
river, the Selenge, into Baikal Lake in the Russian Federation. Most of the park’s population 
is located in two settlements, Khatgal (at the southern end of the lake) and Khankh (at the 
northern end).  Khatgal  is  the main  entry  point  to  the  park.  Khankh and the  park’s  northern 
area  can  be  accessed  only  via  an  unsealed  road  from  Khatgal,  or  from  the  Russian 
Federation.  The  park  borders  the  Russian  Federation  and  a  highway  extends  from  the 
nearest Russian City, Irkutsk, to Khankh. 
Khuvsgul  aimag  is  the  second-poorest  of  Mongolia’s  21  aimags.  In  2014,  (i)  gross 
2. 
domestic  product  per  capita  was  $2,008,  versus  a  national  mean  of  $3,920;  (ii)  the  mean 
annual  salary  was  $2,940  per  employee,  versus  a  national  mean  of  $5,363;  and  (iii) 
unemployment was 15.1%, versus a national rate of 7.9%.2 The KLNP is located within five 
soums (districts), four of which have the highest poverty rates in Mongolia. In 2014, the total 
population  of  the  five  soums  was  16,000  people,  including  3,093  (943  households)  in 
Khatgal and 2,648 (819 households) in Khankh. Human population densities in the park are 
low.  Poverty-stricken  households  account  for  43.4%  (410)  of  households  in  Khatgal,  and 
81.5%  (668)  of  those  in  Khankh, 3  while  herding  households  make  up  30.2%  (285)  of 
households in Khatgal, and 44.5% (365) of those in Khankh (footnote 2). 
The  KLNP  is  becoming  one  of  the  most  popular  tourism  destinations  in  Mongolia. 
3. 
Tourist numbers and facilities are expanding rapidly: between 2010 and 2014, annual tourist 
visits  to  the  KLNP  rose  from  11,000  to  60,000  as  a  result  of  improved  road  access  and 
reduced visa restrictions.4 No growth projections are available, but Khuvsgul aimag and the 
KLNP  are  targeted  as  a  key  region  for  the  development  of  tourism  and  associated 
infrastructure. 5  This  expansion  is  occurring  in  the  absence  of  planning.  There  is  no 
framework  for  coordination  among  the  key  KLNP  stakeholders—the  KLNP  Administration, 
communities,  and  tour  operators—nor  a  shared  vision,  targets,  or  codes  of  conduct  for 
tourism.  Vehicle  access  and  camping  are  uncontrolled  and  some  camps  are  unlicensed. 
Enforcement of park regulations by the KLNP Administration is an important but only partial 
solution  to  these  issues,  which  requires  the  active  support  of  other  stakeholders.6 Tourism 
presents  a  major  opportunity  to  support  local  livelihoods,  yet  few  residents  are  benefiting 
because  of  limited  capacity  and  resources  to  develop  tourism  goods  and  services. 
Constraints  include  a  lack  of  technical  and  marketing  skills  and  capital  to  produce  quality 
goods (e.g., handicrafts) and provide reliable supplies and services (e.g., food supplies and 
guiding).

Grazing of livestock in the area of the park has occurred for centuries and provides 
4. 
meat, wool, and dairy products for residents. Livestock grazing will continue to be a principal 
livelihood for many residents in the KLNP and buffer zone, especially those that graze their 
livestock  in  remote  areas  far  from  tourism-related  opportunities. 7  These  benefits  are 
declining  because  of  overgrazing,  caused  by  increasing  human  and  livestock  populations, 
and limited grazing lands. In 2014, there were about 62,160 livestock in the KLNP, including 
21,502  (35%)  goats  and  15,161  (24%)  sheep. 8  There  is  no  organized  management  of 
herding in the area, and herding families have limited capacity and resources to improve the 
sustainability of their practices and diversify their income. Overgrazing is also contributing to 
soil  exposure,  permafrost  melt,  tree  dieback,  and  conversion  of  forest  to  steppe,  in  a 
continuous cycle that also increases fire risk. 
Khuvsgul  Lake’s  largely  pristine  state  is  the  foundation  for  livelihoods  and  tourism, 
5. 
but  uncontrolled  sewage  and  litter  from  tourism  threaten  lake  water  quality.9 There  is  no 
organized  waste  management  system  in  the  KLNP.  Toilet  facilities  are  mostly  unlined  pits, 
and sewage seeps into soil and the lake. Resources for litter collection are inadequate and 
the  lake  already  contains  plastic  litter. 10 Traditional  solutions  involving  large-scale  waste 
management infrastructure are not appropriate for the KLNP, because of the fragile and very 
cold environment, limited value of flushing systems (water is frozen from November to June), 
and  location  in  a  protected  area. Waste  management  at the  KLNP  requires innovative and 
small-scale  methods  that  are  simple  and  cost-effective,  involve  communities,  can  be 
replicated locally, and minimize or avoid the use of water. Baseline data on pollution sources 
are required to guide waste management, but no waste assessment or extended monitoring 
have been conducted. 
The internal zoning of a protected area is a critical policy tool to support livelihoods.11 
6. 
At  the  KLNP,  the  current  zones  exhibit  inconsistencies  with  land  use.  Given  the  rapid 
increase  of  tourism  and  likely  expansion  of  associated  infrastructure,  a  best-practice 
approach  to  strengthen  the  park  zoning  would  provide  a  strong  basis  to  support 
communities, tourism, and conservation. Improved zoning could (i) support the residents of 
Khankh,  an  isolated  enclave  in  the  KLNP;  (ii)  support  herding  livelihoods;  (iii)  identify 
strategic  areas  for  tourism  and  future  investment;  (iv)  help  secure  the  water  quality  of  the 
lake; and (v) improve the sustainability of actions undertaken by the current project through 
long-term planning. 
7. 
Government  and  donor  initiatives  are  addressing  some  of  these  issues.  The  park’s 
first management plan was approved in 2014 and mentions tourism and waste management, 
but  provides  no  targets  or  actions.  Between  2013  and  2014,  a  river  basin  authority  and 
buffer  zone  councils  were  established,  yet  these  have  limited  training  and  funds.  A  small 
community  marketplace  for  tourist  products  was  constructed  in  2015  in  Khatgal.  Research 
on  natural  resources  has  been  conducted  in  the  KLNP  since  the  1950s.  Civil  society 
organizations  (CSOs)  have  provided  support  for  park  management,  ranger  training, 
sanitation,  and  green  education  programs.  The  need  to  support  community-based  tourism 
and  waste  management  in  the  KLNP  is  widely  acknowledged  by  the  government, 
communities, and tour operators. 
7  Mongolia’s Law on Buffer Zones broadly defines a buffer zone as the entirety of all soum lands surrounding a 
protected area. The current project will focus on communities within and immediately adjacent to the KLNP.

3 
At the national level, an integrated approach that balances livelihoods, tourism, waste 
8. 
management,  and  biodiversity  conservation  within  protected  areas  is  urgently  needed. 
Government efforts to expand tourism are centered on Mongolia’s unique wilderness values 
and large network of protected areas, which cover 18% of the country.12 These are generally 
located in poor regions with limited infrastructure, which presents challenges for maintaining 
ecological values, providing benefits to communities, and ensuring sustainable tourism. Few 
such models are available, although previous projects have confirmed the benefits of tourism 
for  communities  in  protected  areas. 13  For  improving  the  livelihoods  of  herding  families, 
previous  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  (JFPR)  projects  in  Mongolia  present  strong 
models for the current project,14 provided they are tailored to local conditions.15 
9. 
The  project  will  be  among  the  first  in  Mongolia  to  address  the  linked  issues  of 
livelihoods,  tourism,  and  waste  management  in  a  protected  area.  New  participatory 
mechanisms for the KLNP will be piloted, including co-management approaches for tourism 
and  waste  management,  and  community-led  revolving  funds  for  livelihood  improvement.16 
Measures have been designed to promote community ownership and entrepreneurship. For 
waste management,  toilet  systems  that  are  suitable for the  cold and fragile environment of 
the  KLNP  will  be  piloted.  The  project  is  strongly  oriented  toward  stakeholder  participation. 
Two  CSOs  active  in  the  park  will  be  members  of  the  project  steering  committee,  and  the 
project  will  coordinate  with  another  protected  area  program.17 The  potential  use  of  donor 
skills  and  resources  under  the  project  includes  (i)  an  ecotourism  training  program,  (ii) 
collaboration  with  Japan  tourism  associations,  and  (iii)  participation  by  Japan  International 
Cooperation Agency (JICA) volunteers.18 The project complements a new JFPR community 
forestry initiative elsewhere in Khuvsgul aimag.19 
10. 
By  integrating  poverty  reduction,  income  generation,  and  the  sustainable  use  of 
natural  resources,  the  project  will  directly  contribute  to  Mongolia’s  Action  Program,  2012–
2016, 20  Green  Development  Policy  2014, 21  and  Khuvsgul  aimag  Socio-Economic

The  project  provides  an  opportunity  to  facilitate  future  ADB  assistance  to  Khuvsgul  aimag, 
especially for the sustainable development of regional tourism. ADB is well placed to support 
the  project  through  its  institutional  experience  and  work  with  multiple  stakeholders  in 
Mongolia. 
B. 
Impact and Outcome 
The impacts will be (i) per capita income in five soums of Khuvsgul aimag increased, 
11. 
and  (ii)  management  of  natural  resources  in  the  KLNP  improved.  The  outcome  will  be 
livelihoods and sustainable tourism in five soums of the KLNP improved and integrated. 
C. 
Outputs 
The  project  will  have  three  outputs:  (i)  community-based  tourism  in  Khatgal  and 
12. 
Khankh  settlements  promoted,  (ii)  capacity

for  sustainable 
13. 
Output  1:  Community-based  tourism  in  Khatgal  and  Khankh  settlements 
promoted.  Output  1  will  (i)  establish  the  first  pilot  comanagement  tourism  group  for  the 
KLNP,  comprising  the  KLNP  Administration,  communities,  tour  operators,  and  soum 
governments;  (ii)  develop  a  stakeholder  vision,  targets,  and  codes  of  practice  for  tourism; 
and  (iii)  promote  and  strengthen  community-based  tourism,  including  household-scale 
enterprises such as guiding, handicrafts, and the provision of food supplies to guest houses. 
14. 
Output  2:  Capacity  for  sustainable  livestock  and  pasture  management  in  the 
Khuvsgul Lake National Park and buffer zone improved. Output 2 will (i) establish herder 
groups  among  the  herding  families  in  the  KLNP  and  buffer  zone;  (ii)  establish  herder 
management  plans  for  each  herder  group  that  are  tailored  to  local  conditions,  including 
optimal stocking densities and pasture management; and (iii) support income diversification 
for  herder  families,  especially  those  with  limited  opportunities  for  tourism-based  income. 
Output 2 will use scientific and traditional knowledge available for the KLNP to  support the 
herder management plans and improved grazing practices. 
15. 
Outputs  1  and  2  will  be  supported  through  a  combination  of  specialist  support, 
training,  and  the  establishment  of  five  community  revolving  funds  (one  per  project  soum). 
The funds  will  be  community-managed  and  support  household-scale  enterprises,  with  17% 
of the grant proceeds (an average of $100,000 or 4% per soum) channeled into the funds.26 
Funds  will  be  held  in  one  bank  account  per  soum.  The  project  will  provide  financing 
expertise, training, and initial capital for the first 4 years for the communities to develop and 
manage  the  funds,  including  the  establishment  of  fund  committees,  operating  procedures, 
and  repayment  terms  and  conditions.  Loans  will  be  limited  to  activities  compatible  with 
outputs  1  and  2,  the  KLNP  Management  Plan,  and  domestic  and  ADB  policies  and 
regulations.  The  interest  rate  applied  to  loans  will  be  low  and  reviewed  regularly.27 Interest 
repayments over the 4-year project duration will replenish the funds. The activity is aligned 
with  Mongolia’s  Law  on  Buffer  Zones,  which  provides  a  legal  framework  to  support 
communities in protected areas and buffer zones. 
16. 
Output  3:  Waste  management  around  Khuvsgul  Lake  strengthened.  Output  3 
will  (i)  implement  a  water  quality  monitoring  program  tailored  to  the  project  activities,

including a rapid assessment of threats to the water quality of Khuvsgul Lake; (ii) establish a 
pilot  community-led  waste  management  program,  including  waste  management  teams,  the 
installation of  low  environmental  impact  toilet facilities  and litter  bins,  and  the  phasing  in of 
public  campsite  fees  to  fund  team  salaries  and  facility  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M); 
and  (iii)  conduct  a  best-practice  review  on  the  internal  zoning  of  the  KLNP,  including 
scientific  and  traditional  knowledge  and  stakeholder  consultation,  to  identify  zones  that 
maximize benefits to livelihoods, tourism, and conservation. 
Project management. The executing and implementing agencies lack the personnel 
17. 
and  resources  needed  to  fully  implement  the  project.  The  grant  proceeds  will  also  (i) 
establish the administrative framework for the project, including a steering committee, project 
management  unit  (PMU),  and  project  implementation  unit  (PIU);  and  (ii)  finance  the 
specialist  support  and  PMU  and  PIU  operational  costs  required  to  implement  outputs  1–3. 
The  PMU  and  PIU  will  implement  the  project  on  behalf  of  the  executing  and  implementing

integrated  project  approach  for  livelihoods  and  sustainable  tourism,  and  to  develop  new 
initiatives in Khuvsgul aimag and/or elsewhere in Mongolia, will be identified through (i) the 
review of KLNP internal zoning, which will include multistakeholder discussions on land-use 
planning  and  sustainable  development  of  regional  tourism;  (ii)  the  development  of  new 
partnerships  during  the  project,  including  between  the  Khuvsgul  aimag  government,  the 
Ministry of Environment, Green Development and Tourism (MEGDT), and ADB; and (iii) the 
preparation  of  a  scale-up  strategy  and  investment  plan.  This  will  describe  post  project 
financing for O&M of the project facilities, replication of the project goods and services, and 
specific follow-up opportunities. 
19. 
Stakeholder  communication  and  dissemination  of  project  results.  Khuvsgul 
Lake is revered in Mongolia and is a high-profile area subject to frequent media coverage. A 
project  stakeholder  communication strategy  has  been  prepared  (Appendix  4). The  strategy 
describes target audiences and media approaches, including public events and workshops. 
These  activities  will  also  serve  to  promote  the  project  approach  and  distribute  relevant 
lessons.

IV. 
COSTS AND FINANCING 
20. 
The project will be funded by a $3 million grant from the JFPR of the Government of 
Japan.  Financial  conditions  for  the  grant  are  set  forth  in  the  draft  grant  agreement28 and 
Sections V.B–D of this project administration manual (PAM). 
A. 
Cost Estimates Preparation and Revisions 
21. 
Preparation.  The  project  cost  estimates  were  prepared  by  the  executing  and 
implementing  agencies, two  economic  and financial  consultants (one international  and one 
national)  funded  by  ADB,  and  ADB  project  team.  The  file  entitled  “MON  (48216)  Khuvsgul 
Lake  Costing  and  Budget”  in  MS  Excel  format  is  retained  at  the  Department  of  Protected 
Areas Management (DPAM) office and by ADB project officer. 
22. 
Revisions.  For  any  proposed  revisions  to  the  project  budget  during  project 
implementation,  the  Government  of  Mongolia  (GOM)  will  submit  a  request  for  project  cost 
reallocation  to  ADB  for  review  and  endorsement.  If  the  revision  is  endorsed,  the  PMU  will 
revise the cost estimates under the guidance of ADB project officer. 
B. 
Cost Categories 
23. 
Cost categories are as follows:

Description 
(i)  Vehicles for use by project staff and consultants; (ii) computers, printers, 
copiers; (iii) office furniture and cabinets; (iv) materials and services for co-
management  pilots;  (v)  materials  for  eco-toilet  units  and  litter  bins;  (vi) 
domestic  airfares;  (vii)  local  transport;  (viii)  project  office  operations;  (ix) 
project vehicle operations; (x) stakeholder communications 
(i)  Five  community  revolving  funds;  (ii)  tourism  co-management  group;  (iii) 
herder  groups  and  herder  council;  (iv)  community  waste  management 
teams–labor for maintaining eco-toilets, litter bins, campsites 
(i)  Training  for  communities  to  operate  the  revolving  funds,  (ii)  training  for 
tourism  livelihoods;  (iii)  training  for  herder  group  management;  and  (iv) 
training for grazing and agricultural processing livelihoods

assignments (water quality monitoring, eco-tourism training) 
(i)  Project  planning  and  team  meetings;  (ii)  per  diems  (iii)  in-kind 
contributions from central and local government 
Physical and price contingencies 
Goods  and  Services  include  one  car  and  four  motorbikes.  The  JFPR  2015 
24. 
Guidelines29 exclude funding of vehicles except with justification. There is strong justification 
for the project: (i) the project area is located a long distance from Ulaanbaatar; (ii) there will 
be  frequent  transport  of  project  staff  and  equipment  between  Ulaanbaatar  and  the  project 
area; (iii) the project is working across five soums and where there is little public transport – 
project vehicles will be critical for implementation; and (iv) vehicle rental over 4 years would 
be  more  expensive  than  purchase.  Upon  project  completion,  the  vehicles  will  be  handed 
over to the KLNP Administration for use at the KLNP.

The grant imprest account is held by the executing agency, the Department of Protected Areas 
Administration  (DPAM)  under  the  Ministry  of  Environment,  Green  Development  and  Tourism, 
and maintained by the project management unit (PMU). The imprest fund is used to pay for the 
project activities, including payments to consultants, contractors, and suppliers of goods and/or 
equipment. Withdrawal applications from the imprest account require the approval and signature 
of the Director General of the DPAM and PMU project manager. Funds for field expenditures will 
be  transferred  to  a  project  subaccount  held  by  the  implementing  agency,  the  KLNP 
Administration,  and  maintained  by  the  project  implementing  unit.  For  the  community  revolving 
funds under outputs 1 and 2, the funds will be transferred to five local bank accounts (one per 
soum)  to  be  established  by  the  community  fund  committees,  who  will  subsequently  be 
responsible for managing the revolving funds.

FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT 
A. 
Financial Management Assessment 
Financial management assessment (FMA) of the executing and implementing agencies 
28. 
was  conducted  in  March  and  April  2015  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  Financial  Management 
Assessment  Guidelines  and  Financial  Due  Diligence—A  Methodology  Note.  Assessment  of 
overall  pre-mitigation  financial  management  risk  is  based  on  the  definitions  provided  in  ADB’s 
Financial  Management  Technical  Guidance  Note—Financial  Management  Assessment  (May 
2015).  Staff  of  Ministry  of  Environment,  Green  Development  and  Tourism’s  (MEGDT)  DPAM 
and  Economic,  Financial  and  Planning  Division  (EFPD)  participated  in  the  FMA.  The  FMA 
considered  the  capacity  of  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies,  including  funds-flow 
arrangements,  staffing,  accounting  and  financial  reporting  systems,  financial  information 
systems, and internal and external auditing arrangements. 
29. 
The overall pre-mitigation financial management risk of the executing and implementing 
agencies  is  concluded  to  be  “moderate”  (defined  as  “likely  to  occur,  will  have  low  impact  if 
occurs”).31 This conclusion is based on: (i) the FMA indicates low in-house financial capacity by 
the EA and IA, hence even with the inclusion of a qualified accountant in the project team, it is 
likely  that  some  errors  in  project  financial  management  may  occur;  (ii)  such  risks  are  partly 
offset  by  support from  EFPD,  which provides  financial  guidance  and monitoring  to  all  MEGDT 
departments; and (iii) given the small size and budget of the project, it is likely that such errors 
will be quickly identified and corrected, with limited impact to project operations and viability. A 
ranking of moderate risk requires the preparation of a financial management action plan, which 
is presented in the following table. Terms of reference for the project accountant are described 
in Appendix 1.

Disbursement 
1. 
Disbursement Arrangements for ADB  
Project  imprest  account.  The  grant  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with 
30. 
ADB’s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). 32 After  grant 
effectiveness,  the  executing  agency  will  immediately  establish  an  imprest  account  for  the 
project.  The  imprest  account  will  be  denominated  in  US  dollars.  The  imprest  account  will  be 
used exclusively for ADB’s share of eligible expenditures (i.e. the JFPR funds) and according to 
the  financing  arrangements  described  in  this  PAM.  The  imprest  account  will  be  established  at 
the commercial bank in Ulaanbaatar, a state bank of the GOM. This bank is endorsed by MOF 
and is acceptable to ADB. 
31. 
Requests by the executing agency for initial advance and subsequent replenishments of 
the  imprest  account  will  be  supported  by  withdrawal  applications  to  ADB.  The  amounts  to  be 
requested  will  be  based  on  the  executing  agency’s  estimate of  ADB’s  share of  eligible project 
expenditures for up to, and not exceeding, the next 6 months, supported by a 6-month activity 
plan  and  estimate  of  expenditure  sheet.33 Subsequent  applications  for  account  replenishment 
will  be  accompanied  by  a  statement  of  expenditures34 or,  if  full  documentation  is  required,  a 
summary sheet,35 as well as the imprest account reconciliation statement.36 Liquidation by ADB 
of eligible expenditures is required before further replenishments of the imprest account can be 
endorsed.  The  withdrawal  application  will  be  prepared  in  the  currency  of  the  imprest  account 
i.e.,  US  dollars. Withdrawal  applications  will  be  co-signed  by  the  DPAM  Director  General  and 
MOF. 
32. 
Statement  of  expenditure  (SOE)  procedure.  The  SOE  procedure  will  be  used  for 
liquidation of advances to the imprest account and reimbursement of eligible expenditures. It will 
also  apply  for  individual  payments  not  exceeding  $10,000  to  ensure  speedy  project 
implementation. Payments in excess of the SOE ceiling will be liquidated or replenished based 
on  full  supporting  documentation  of  eligible  expenditures.  The  SOEs  will  be  signed  by  the 
DPAM  Director  General  and  manager  of  the  PMU.  Direct  payment  and  reimbursement 
procedures  will  be  used  for  eligible  project  expenditures  in  case  of  contracts  for  a  substantial 
amount.  All  supporting  documents  (including  receipts  for  expenditures)  should  be  retained  by 
the  executing  and  implementing  agencies  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  Loan  Disbursement 
Handbook (2015, as amended from time to time) and readily available for review upon request 
by ADB e.g., on a sampling basis, and for independent audit. 
33. 
During project implementation, the PMU accountant will assess the feasibility to remove 
the  ceiling  for  the  SOE  procedure  subject  to  ADB’s  endorsement,  in  line  with  ADB’s  Strategy 
2020 MTR Action Plan, and review and update the FMA as needed. 
34. 
Day-to-day  management  of  the  imprest  account  will  be  by  the  PMU  on  behalf  of  the 
executing agency, to facilitate local project expenditures. Withdrawal requests from the imprest 
account  will  require  co-signing  by  the  DPAM  Director  General  and  PMU  manager.  The 
executing agency will be kept informed by the PMU about all transactions and receive copies of

all  financial  statements  and  audit  reports.  Interest  earned  on  the  imprest  account,  net  of  bank 
charges,  can  be  used for  the  project,  subject  to ADB’s  approval  and  within the  approved  total 
amount  of  the  JFPR  grant.  Any  unused  interest  should  be  returned  to  the  JFPR  account 
maintained at ADB upon project completion and before closing of the JFPR account. To ensure 
the  PMU  has  sufficient  financial  management  capability  to  establish  adequate  accounting 
procedures and controls for the efficient operation of the imprest fund, the PMU staff team will 
recruit a qualified financial officer and a procurement officer.  
Project  subaccount.  The  implementing  agency  (KLNP  Administration)  will  establish  a 
35. 
project subaccount at a bank near its headquarters in Khatgal Village. The subaccount will be 
used  exclusively  for  ADB’s  share  of  eligible  expenditures  of  the  project.  Day-to-day 
management  of  the  subaccount  will  be  performed  by  the  project  implementing  unit  (PIU)  on 
behalf of the implementing agency, to facilitate local project expenditures. Withdrawal requests 
from the subaccount will require co-signing by the KLNP Director and PIU field coordinator. 
36. 
Pilot  community  revolving  funds.  For  the  five  pilot  community  revolving  funds  to  be 
established under outputs 1 and 2, the project will provide seed capital to each fund as follows: 
Khatgal  village  ($195,000),  Khankh  soum  ($100,000),  Chandmani-Ondor  soum  ($75,000), 
Renchinlkhumbe soum ($75,000) and Tsagaan-Uur soum ($75,000) (total $520,000). The funds 
will be held in one account per soum (i.e. five accounts) of a bank or other financial institutions 
acceptable to ADB. The accounts will be opened by the five community fund committees to be 
established  by  the  project.  These  committees  will  be  responsible  for  management  of  the 
revolving funds, including monitoring and reporting of financial transactions. The grant proceeds 
for  each  fund  will  be  transferred  in  tranches  (up  to  three  tranches  over  the  four  years  of  the 
project) pending the performance of the committees. The executing and implementing agencies 
and ADB will review the performance of the fund committees regularly in at least the first year of 
implementation,  followed  by  spot  checks  for  the  remainder  of  the  project,  pending  on  the 
performance  of  each  committee.  After  project  completion,  the  community  revolving  funds  will 
continue to be managed and maintained under the arrangements approved by ADB pursuant to 
the Grant Agreement.     
37. 
Before the submission of the first withdrawal applications from the imprest account and 
subaccount,  the  DPAM  and  MOF  should  submit  to  ADB  sufficient  evidence  of  the  authority  of 
the  person(s)  who  will  sign  the  withdrawal  applications,  together  with  the  authenticated

GOM, including the executing and implementing agencies, will provide in-kind support of 
office  space  for  the  PMU  and  PIU,  and  salaries  and  travel  costs  of  counterpart  staff.  These 
costs will be included in the annual budgets of the relevant GOM agencies. 
C. 
Accounting 
39. 
The PMU, on behalf of the executing agency, will maintain, or cause to be maintained, 
separate books and records by funding source for all expenditures incurred on the project. The 
25 
PMU, on behalf of the executing agency, will prepare consolidated project financial statements 
in  accordance  with  GOM's  accounting  laws  and  regulations  which  are  consistent  with 
international  accounting  principles  and  practices.  The  PMU  will  be  supported  in  these 
responsibilities  by  the  PIU,  which  will  collect,  document,  and  provide  records  of  field 
expenditures to the PMU.  
D. 
Auditing and Public Disclosure 
The PMU, on behalf of the executing agency, will cause the project imprest account to 
40. 
be audited in accordance with international standards on auditing and GOM’s audit regulations, 
by an independent auditor acceptable to ADB. The audited project financial statements together 
with the auditor’s opinion will be presented in English language to ADB within 6 months of the 
end of the fiscal year by the executing agency.  
41. 
The audit report for the project financial statements will include a management letter and 
auditor’s opinions which cover (i) whether the project financial statements present a true and fair 
view or are presented fairly, in all material respects, in accordance with the applicable financial 
reporting standards; (ii) whether the proceeds of the grant were used only for the purpose(s) of 
the project; (iii) the level of compliance with the financial conditions of the grant  agreement for 
the  project,  and  (iv)  proper  use  of  the  imprest  fund  and  SOE  procedures,  in  accordance  with 
ADB’s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  the  project 
documents. 
42. 
Compliance  with  financial  reporting  and  auditing  requirements  will  be  monitored  by 
review  missions  and  during  normal  program  supervision,  and  followed  up  regularly  with  all 
concerned, including the external auditor.  
43. 
The  government  and  executing  and  implementing  agencies  have  been  made  aware  of 
ADB’s  approach  to  delayed  submission,  and  the  requirements  for  satisfactory  and  acceptable 
quality of the audited project financial statements.37 ADB reserves the right to require a change 
in  the  auditor  (in  a  manner  consistent  with  the  constitution  of  the  grant  recipient),  or  for 
additional  support  to  be  provided  to  the  auditor,  if  the  audits  required  are  not  conducted  in  a 
manner satisfactory to ADB, or if the audits are substantially delayed. ADB reserves the right to 
verify  the  project’s  financial  accounts  to  confirm  that  the  share  of  ADB’s  financing  is  used  in 
accordance with ADB policies and procedures.  
Public  disclosure  of  the  audited  project  financial  statements,  including  the  auditor’s 
44. 
opinion  on  the  project  financial  statements,  will  be  guided  by  ADB’s  Public  Communications 
Policy  (2011).38 After  review,  ADB  will  disclose  the  audited  financial  statements  for  the  project 
and  the  opinion  of  the  auditors  on  the  financial  statements  no  later  than  14  days  of  ADB’s 
37  When audited project financial statements are not received by the due date, ADB will write to the executing agency 
advising  that  (i)  the  audit  documents  are  overdue;  and  (ii)  if  they  are  not  received  within  the  next  6  months, 
requests for new contract awards and disbursement such as new replenishment of imprest accounts, processing 
of new reimbursement, and issuance of new commitment letters will not be processed. 
(a)  When audited project financial statements have not been received within 6 months after the due date, ADB will 
withhold  processing  of  requests  for  new  contract  awards  and  disbursement  such  as  new  replenishment  of 
imprest  accounts,  processing  of  new  reimbursement,  and  issuance  of  new  commitment  letters.  ADB  will  (i) 
inform  the  executing  agency  of  ADB’s  actions,  and  (ii)  advise  that  the  grant  may  be  suspended  if  the  audit 
documents are not received within the next 6 months.  
(b)  When audited project financial statements have not been received within 12 months after the due date, ADB 
may suspend the grant.

The  PMU,  on  behalf  of  the  executing  agency,  will  be  responsible  for  procurement.  All 
45. 
procurement  financed  by  the  JFPR  grant  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB’s 
Procurement  Guidelines  (2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  Mongolia’s  Ministry  of 
Finance  (2014)  Procurement  Manual. The  selection  and  engagement  of contractors for  works, 
goods, and/or consulting services to be financed by the grant will be subject to ADB approval. 
The project procurement plan is in Section VI.B. The plan describes the thresholds and review 
procedures,  and  contract  packages  for  goods,  works,  and  consulting  services.  Any  necessary 
modifications or clarifications to the recipient procurement procedures will be documented in the 
procurement plan.  
46. 
The relevant sections of ADB’s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) will be 
included in all procurement documents and contracts. Before the start of any procurement, ADB 
and  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies  will  review  GOM’s  public  procurement  laws  to 
ensure consistency with ADB’s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time). 
47. 
The project is expected to require  3 person-months of one international consultant and 
487  person-months  of  16  national  consultants  for  project  implementation.  These  17  positions 
comprise  seven  administrative  staff  (PMU  manager,  PIU  field  coordinator,  Khankh  officer, 
implementation  specialist,  accountant,  procurement  specialist,  driver)  and  10  specialists.  The 
executing agency will engage all the consultants through individual consultant selection method, 
following  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). 
The consultants’ terms of reference are in Appendix 1.

The procedures to be followed for national competitive bidding shall be those set forth in 
the  Public  Procurement  Law  of  Mongolia  of  1  December  2005,  effective  1  February  2006,  as 
amended  on  6  February  2007  and  16  July  2009  (hereinafter  referred  to  as  PPLM),  with  the 
clarifications  and  modifications  described  in  the  following  paragraphs  required  for  compliance 
with the provisions of ADB's Procurement Guidelines. 
1.

7. 
The  Standard  Bidding  Documents  of  Mongolia  for  Goods  and Works  that  have 
been  approved  by  ADB  as  acceptable  for  ADB-financed  projects,  together  with 
ADB's clarifications and modifications thereto, shall be used.  
Government-owned  enterprises  in  Mongolia  shall  be  eligible  for  projects  only  if 
they  can  establish  that  they:  (i)  are  legally  and  financially  autonomous;  (ii) 
operate  under  the  principles  of  commercial  law;  and  (iii)  are  not  dependent 
agencies of the Executing Agency and/or the Implementing Agency. 
If a bid security is required, the bid security shall be in any of the following forms 
at the bidder's option: (i) a bank guarantee; or (ii) a cashier's or certified check. 
Bidders must be nationals of member countries of ADB, and offered Goods and 
Works  must  be  produced  in  and  supplied  from  member  countries  of  ADB.  
Bidders or potential bidders shall not be required to register with the taxation and 
other registration authorities of the government as a condition or requirement of 
bidding or award, leaving these requirements for after award and before signing 
of contract. 
Foreign  bidders from  eligible  countries  of  ADB shall  be  allowed  to  participate in 
bidding  under  the  same  conditions  as  local  bidders  and  without  any  domestic 
preference. 
Prequalification  shall  not  be  required,  except  in  the  case  of  large  or  complex 
works, and with prior written concurrence of ADB. 
Qualification  criteria  shall  be  clearly  specified  in  the  bidding  documents,  and  all 
criteria so specified shall be used to determine whether a bidder is qualified.  The 
evaluation  of  a  bidder's  qualifications  shall  only  take  into  account  the  bidder's 
capacity  and  resources  to  perform  the  contract,  in  particular  its  experience  and 
past  performance  on  similar  contracts,  capabilities  with  respect  to  personnel, 
equipment  and  construction  or  manufacturing  facilities,  and  financial  position.  
The  evaluation  of  the  bidder's  qualifications  shall  be  conducted  separately  from 
the technical and commercial evaluation of the bid. 
8. 
Evaluation and qualification criteria, and submission requirements, to be used in 
each  bidding  activity  shall  be  clearly  specified  in  the  bidding  documents.    The 
32

13. 
14. 
evaluation of bids shall be done in strict adherence to the criteria specified in the 
bidding documents. 
The  invitation  to  bid  and  the  bidding  documents  shall  be  prepared  in  the 
Mongolian language. If another language will be used, then such other language 
shall be English. 
Bidders  shall  be  requested  to  extend  the  validity  of  their  bids  only  under 
exceptional  circumstances  and  the  Executing  or  Implementing  Agency,  as  the 
case may be, shall communicate such request for extension to all bidders before 
the date of expiry of their bids. When the procurement is subject to ADB's prior 
review, the Executing or Implementing Agency, as the case may be, shall obtain 
in a timely manner the prior written concurrence of ADB for the extension of the 
bid validity period. 
All  bids  shall  not  be  rejected  or  new  bids  invited  without  ADB's  prior  written 
concurrence.  No bid shall be rejected merely on the basis of a comparison with 
the estimated cost or budget ceiling without ADB's prior written concurrence (with 
specific reference to Article 30 of the PPLM). 
Negotiations  with  bidders  shall  not  be  undertaken  before  award  of  contract, 
except  as  provided  in  Paragraph  2.63  of  ADB's  Procurement  Guidelines  (with 
specific reference to Article 30.2 of the PPLM).  A bidder shall not be required, as 
a  condition  for  award,  to  undertake  obligations  not  specified  in  the  bidding 
documents or otherwise to modify its bid as originally submitted. 
Bidding documents and contracts under national competitive bidding procedures 
financed  by  ADB  shall  include  a  provision  requiring  suppliers,  contractors  and 
consultants  to  permit  ADB  to  inspect  their  accounts  and  records  relating  to  the 
bid  submission  and  the  performance  of  the  contract  by  the  supplier,  contractor 
and/or  consultant,  as  the  case  may  be,  and  to  have  them  audited  by  auditors 
appointed by ADB, if so required by ADB. 
At the same time that notification on award of contract is given to the successful 
bidder,  the  results  of  the  bid  evaluation  shall  be  posted  on  a  well-known  freely 
accessible  website  (namely  Mongolia's  Ministry  of  Finance  e-procurement 
website:  www.e-procurement.mn)  identifying  the  bid  and  lot  numbers  and 
providing information on the: (i) name of each bidder that submitted a bid; (ii) bid 
prices as read out at bid opening; (iii) names of bidders whose bids were rejected 
and the reasons for their rejection; and (iv) name of the winning bidder, and the 
price  it  offered,  as  well  as  the  duration  and  summary  scope  of  the  contract 
awarded.  The Executing Agency or Implementing Agency, as the case may be, 
shall  respond  in  writing  to  unsuccessful  bidders  who  seek  explanations  on  the 
grounds on which their bids were not selected.

VII. 
SAFEGUARDS 
56. 
Environment. (General assessment procedures). The project is categorized as C 
for  environmental  safeguards.  Under  ADB’s  Safeguard Policy  Statement  (SPS,  2009),  only 
activities  likely  to  have  minimal  or  no  adverse  environmental  impacts  will  be  implemented 
under  the  project.  No  environmental  assessment  and  formal  procedure  is  required  for 
category  C  projects  although  environmental  implications  need  to  be  reviewed.  An 
environmental assessment and review framework (EARF) has been prepared and complies 
with ADB’s SPS (2009).43 The EARF includes an environmental management plan (EMP)44 
and  describes:  (i)  the  project,  its  components,  relevant  national  environmental  regulations, 
and  ADB  safeguard  requirements;  (ii)  anticipated  environmental  impacts  of  the  project 
activities;  (iii)  requirements  and  criteria  for  screening,  planning,  and  implementation  of 
activities,  especially  for  the  selection  and  operation  of  the  small-scale,  household  income 
diversification  to  be  supported  under  outputs  1  and  2,  and  environmental-friendly  toilet 
facilities  (eco-toilets)  under  output  3;  and  (iv)  meaningful  consultation  with  affected  people 
and  other  stakeholders,  and 
requirements.  Environmental 
assessment  and  reporting  documents  shall  follow  the  procedures  in  the  EARF.  These 
documents shall be endorsed by the executing and implementing agencies and submitted to 
ADB for final clearance. The EARF is described in Appendix 3.  
information  disclosure 
Consultation  and  public  disclosure.  In  accordance  with  ADB’s  SPS  (2009),  the 
57. 
implementing  agency  and  PIU  will  conduct  consultations  with  affected  people  and  other 
concerned  stakeholders,  including  civil  society,  as  necessary,  prior  to  the  installation  of 
project  facilities  and/or  project  activities.  The  consultation  process  shall  also  be  used  to 
introduce  and  discuss  the  project  grievance  redress  mechanism.  Any  concerns  raised  by 
stakeholders and measures to address these will be documented  in the project design and 
mitigation  measures.  Proof  of  consultations  (e.g.,  attendance  sheets,  minutes  of  meetings, 
and pictures) shall be included in the documentation. A template for consultation records is 
in the EARF.  
58. 
The  PMU  and  PIU  are  responsible  for  ensuring  that  all  environmental  assessment 
documentation  is  properly  and  systematically  kept  as  part  of  the  project  record.  The  PMU 
and  PIU  shall  make  these  documents  available  in  a  form,  language,  and  at  a  location  in 
which they can be easily accessed by all stakeholders including affected people. The results 
of  environmental  assessment  and  inspection  reports  will  be  included  in  the  project  semi-
annual progress reports to ADB, which will be posted on ADB’s website.  
59. 
Grievance  redress  mechanism.  The PIU and implementing agency shall establish 
and  maintain  a  grievance  redress  mechanism  (GRM)  to  receive  and facilitate  resolution of 
affected  peoples’  concerns,  complaints,  and  grievances  about  the  project’s  environmental 
and  social  performance. The GRM  will  address affected  people’s  concerns  and complaints 
promptly,  using  an  understandable  and  transparent  process  that  is  gender  responsive, 
culturally appropriate, and readily accessible, at no costs and without retribution. The GRM 
will  not  impede  access  to  Mongolia’s  judicial  or  administrative  remedies.  The  GRM  will  be 
introduced  during  consultation  with  community  and  made  publicly  available  and  accessible 
to the affected people prior and during to project implementation.  
60. 
Institutional  arrangements  and  responsibilities  for  the  EARF.  The  PIU  will  be 
responsible for implementation of the EARF, supported by the implementing agency (KLNP 
Administration) and other agencies as necessary e.g., MEGDT’s Department of Environment 
43  Disclosed on the ADB website in accordance with ADB’s Safeguard Policy Statement (SPS, 2009) disclosure 
requirements. ADB’s SPS is available in English and Mongolian language at: 
http://www.adb.org/documents/safeguard-policy-statement; and, http://www.adb.org/mn/documents/safeguard-
policy-statement 
44  To serve as a sample for contractors to prepare site-specific EMPs as needed. 
34 
and  Natural  Resources  Management.  Due  to  the  simple  nature  of  the  project  EARF  and 
presence  of  qualified  environmental  staff  within  the  MEGDT  and  KLNP  Administration,  no 
specialist  environmental  staff  will  be  recruited  in  the  PMU  or  PIU  to  implement  the  EARF. 
Each  PIU  specialist,  supported  by  the  PIU  project  field  coordinator,  other  team  members, 
and KLNP Administration, will be responsible for implementing the EARF for their respective 
project activities, as necessary. This requirement is included in the terms of reference for all 
relevant  project  team  members  (Appendix  1).  This  includes  the  EARF  procedures  for 
screening, consultation, and environmental inspection checklists.   
61. 
The executing agency will be responsible for compliance of the project with domestic 
regulatory  requirements.  In  the  event  that  a  general  environmental  impact  assessment 
(GEIA)  and  Detailed  EIA  are  required  (under  Mongolia’s  Law  on  Environmental  Impact 
Assessment  [1998,  revised  in  2012])  for  a  project  activity,  the  executing  agency,  not  the 
project, will be responsible for the provision and payment of any required specialist services 
and  costs.  MEGDT  has  advised  that  the  small-scale  activities  under  this  project,  designed 
for  environmental  benefit,  will  probably  not  require  a  GEIA.  This  will  be  confirmed  during 
project implementation during the detailed planning of individual activities.

Resettlement.  The  project  is  categorized  as  C  for  involuntary  resettlement.45 The 
63. 
project does not involve land acquisition, economic or physical displacement, or involuntary 
restrictions  on  land  use  or  on  access  to  protected  areas.  Instead,  the  project  promotes 
sustainable income diversification to address restrictions that have already been imposed.  
64. 
Indigenous  peoples.  The  project  is  categorized  as  C  for  indigenous  peoples. 
Khuvsgul  aimag  supports  Mongolia’s  only  population  of  the  Dukha  (“reindeer  people”),  an 
indigenous group. Their settlements are located over 50 kilometers west of the KLNP. A few 
families occasionally visit Khuvsgul Lake to sell souvenirs to tourists. They camp on access 
roads  away  from  settlements  and  do  not  stay  long,  partly  due  to  the  grazing  feed 
requirements  of  their  reindeer,  which  are  not  available  in  the  lake  area.  There  are  no 
permanent or regular seasonal settlements of the Dukha in the project area. The traditional 
winter and summer migration routes of the Dukha do not include the KLNP. The Dukha do 
not  practice  livestock  herding. The  project  will  not result  in impacts  to  the Dukha (see  also 
linked document 8: summary poverty social reduction strategy). 
Prohibited  activities.  Pursuant  to  the  SPS,  ADB  funds  may  not  be  applied  to

activities described in the Prohibited Investment Activities List in Appendix 5 of the SPS. All 
project  activities  will  also  comply  with  all  applicable  national  laws  and  regulations  and 
policies and plans, including the KLNP Management Plan (2014).

GENDER AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS 
66. 
Poverty  and  social  issues.  The  project  will  directly  benefit  poor  and  vulnerable 
groups,  and  ensure  inclusive  access  to  the  project  support,  as follows:  (i)  the  participatory 
design  of  the  project  activities  through  comprehensive  stakeholder  consultation  and 
mechanisms,  including  the  pilot  co-management  tourism  group  and  herder  groups;  (ii)  the 
45  Under ADB’s SPS, a proposed project is classified as (i) category A if it is likely to have significant involuntary 
resettlement; (ii) category B if it includes impacts not deemed significant; and category C if it has no impacts. 
A resettlement plan is required for categories A and B. No further action is required for category C. 
35 
inclusion of loan application criteria in the community revolving funds which emphasize the 
need to involve poor and/or vulnerable households; (iii) comprehensive training and outreach 
programs to access all KLNP residents, especially the poorest; (iv) training will be tailored to 
local conditions e.g. for residents far from tourism-related opportunities, training needs and 
opportunities  will  be  identified;  and  (v)  formation  of  herding  groups  and  participatory 
development of herder management plans.  
67. 
The  project  targets  livelihoods  at  the  household  level  across  the  project  area. 
Outputs  1  and  2  will  establish  or  strengthen  at  least  110  household  enterprises  in  tourism 
and/or  sustainable  use  of  natural  resources  in  up  to  five  soums  of  the  KLNP,  which  will 
benefit at least 330 households (over 900 residents). Output 3 will generate at least 45 new 
jobs through the establishment of the community waste management teams. Around 1,500 
residents  (10%  of  the  population  of  the  five  soums)  will  receive  capacity  development  and 
specialist support in income generation, eco-tourism development, rural financing, livestock 
management, agricultural processing, and/or waste management.  
The  project  focuses  on  existing  residents  and  does  not  involve  influx  of  workers. 
68. 
However,  the  tourism  sector  does  involve  a  large  influx  of  visitors  (including  foreigners) 
which  could  introduce  communicable  diseases.  Other  development  programs  are  more 
appropriate  to  raise  awareness  about  HIV/AIDS,  but  information  will  be  provided  to  all 
tourism operators. Contractors will be required to comply with local labor laws. 
69. 
Gender.  The  project  is  classified  “effective  gender  mainstreaming”  under  ADB’s 
project  gender  classification  system.  A  gender  action  plan  (GAP)  has  been  prepared  to 
ensure  that  women  benefit  from  the  project  through  training,  particularly  on  skills 
development,  and  directly  and  indirectly  generated  jobs  (see  table  below).  Women  are  an 
important  stakeholder  group  for  tourism  in  the  KLNP.  They  operate  many  of  the  guest 
houses and/or home stays, arrange some tourist activities (e.g., horse rides), make and sell 
handicraft  souvenirs,  and  organize  supply  of  goods  (e.g.,  meat,  dairy  and  vegetable 
products)  and  services  to  some  guest  houses.  The  project  design  emphasizes  a 
participatory  and  inclusive  approach  to  work  with  women  and  men,  poor  and  vulnerable 
households,  civil  society  organizations,  the  private  sector  (tourism  operators),  and  soum 
governments.  
70. 
The GAP sets targets for project participation, empowerment, capacity building, and 
livelihood  initiatives  for  women  and  the  poor.  The  GAP  comprises  10  actions  with  16 
indicators,  of  which  11  have quantitative targets (see table below).  Under  outputs  1  and 2, 
the  project  will  support  women’s  participation  in  decision-making,  training,  and  community-
based  initiatives.  Under  output  3,  participation  targets  for  women  are  included  for  the 
formation of the community waste management teams.

47 In 2014, “poor” households (as defined by the 2013 National Poverty Guidelines) comprised 410 (43.4%) of the 
943  households  in  Khatgal,  and  668  (81.5%)  of  the  819  households  in  Khankh  (National  Statistical  Office 
data).  The  GAP  target  comprises  40%  (n=164)  of  poor  households  in  Khatgal  and  in  Khankh  (n=267).  The 
target of 430 households is 24% (almost one-quarter) of the total number of households in Khatgal and Khankh 
combined. 
48 In 2014, there were about 3,343 adults (persons aged 18–60) in the KLNP, comprising 1,697 men (51%) and 
1,646 women (49%) (National Statistical Office data), a male:female ratio of about 1:1. About 750 households 
in  the  KLNP  are  herding  households.  Assuming  three  adults  per  household,  this  is  2,250  adult  herders,  of 
which about 1,147 are men and 1,103 are women. It is assumed for this target that at least 80% of all adult 
men (n=918) and women (n=882) in the herding families are involved in livestock-related livelihood activities, 
and that the remainder comprise people who are not or cannot be involved (e.g., due to handicaps) (there is no 
available  data  on  these  proportions).  It  is  assumed  that  at  least  60%  of  eligible  herding  women  (i.e.,  530  of 
882) will be herding group members. This equates to 30% of the total eligible men and women (1,800).

In  2014,  there  were  about  3,343  adults  (persons  aged  18–60)  in  the  KLNP,  comprising  1,697  men  (51%)  and 
1,646 women (49%) (National Statistical Office data), with a male:female ratio of about 1:1. About 750 households 
in  the  KLNP  are  herding  families.  Assuming  three  adults  per  household,  this  is  2,250  adult  herders.  A  training 
target of 50% is about 1,125 residents. The explanation of gender targets is in Section VIII Gender Action Plan of 
the Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). 
d  The waste management systems comprise 50 environmentally friendly toilet units and litter bins; community waste 
management  teams;  and  associated  team  training,  payment  systems,  and  operational  and  maintenance 
procedures. 
e  These initiatives will be led by the comanagement group and funded directly by the project grant, subject to review 
and approval by ADB. Examples are public open-day events on the tourism codes of practice, education materials 
on litter, and a community-led pilot to maintain tour boats to avoid water pollution.

B. 
Monitoring 
71. 
Project  performance  monitoring.  A  project  performance  monitoring  system  (PPMS) 
will  be  established  for  the  project.50 The  design  and  monitoring  framework  (DMF)  forms  the 
basis for monitoring the project progress. During project implementation, the PPMS, through the 
project  performance  report,  will  monitor  the  likelihood  that  key  milestone  dates  for  activities, 
outputs,  outcome,  and  impact  will  be  achieved.  For  the  impact,  measured  5  years  after 
50  ADB’s  PPMS  is  a  coherent  and  results-based  approach  to  project  planning,  performance  monitoring,  and 
evaluation  of  results.  The  PPMS  comprises  five components:  (i)  DMF;  (ii)  project  performance  report  (PPR);  (iii) 
grant recipient’s monitoring and evaluation (at the central, and executing and implementing agencies levels); (iv) 
project  completion  report  (PCR);  and  (v)  project  performance  evaluation  report  (PPER),  and  where  appropriate, 
impact  evaluation  studies.  The  DMF  provides  the  basis  upon  which  the  PPMS  operates.  It  does  this  by 
establishing  quantified,  time-bound  targets  and  measurable  indicators,  and  by  identifying  key  risks  and 
assumptions that are used to monitor and evaluate performance in the PPR, PCR, and PPER. 
41 
project  completion,  this  will  be  indirectly  through  monitoring  assumptions  and  risks.  The  DMF 
will  be  reviewed  during  the  project  implementation and  if  needed,  adjusted  to reflect  changing 
circumstances  and  project  environments  so  that  the  project  outcome  can  be  achieved. 
Following project completion, the project is subject to an assessment of the outcome along with 
recommendations  for  enhancing  and  sustaining  the  outcome.  A  project  completion  report  will 
also include a preliminary assessment of the impact. The project impact, outcome, outputs, 
and targets and indicators can be seen in the DMF. 
The  PMU  will  monitor  project  implementation  through  reports  from  the  PIU  as  well  as 
72. 
feedback  from  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies,  project  steering  committee,  project 
beneficiaries, and other stakeholders. ADB will monitor project performance in five aspects, i.e., 
technical,  procurement,  disbursement,  financial  management,  and  safeguards,  through  the 
executing  agency’s  semi-annual  progress  reports  (prepared  by  the  PMU  and  endorsed  by  the 
executing agency), day-to-day communication with the PMU, and ADB review missions.  
73. 
Compliance  monitoring.  The  PMU  on  behalf  of  the  executing  agency  will  monitor 
compliance with covenants stipulated in the grant agreement. ADB will monitor the compliance 
status through the executing agency’s semi-annual progress reports, day-to-day communication 
with the PMU, and ADB review missions; and take necessary remedial measures for any non-
compliance. 
74. 
Environmental  safeguards  monitoring.  During  implementation,  the  PIU  will  monitor 
the implementation of the EARF, including the grievance redress mechanism (Appendix 3) and 
include progress as part of the overall reporting to the PMU. PMU and PIU team members will 
be  required  to  screen,  monitor  and  report  the  activities  under  their  coordination  against  the 
EARF  and  this  is  included  in  their  terms  of  reference  (Appendix  1).  Progress  reporting  will  be 
semi-annual  and  submitted  as  part  of  the  overall  semi-annual  project  progress  reports.  In  the 
event  of  any  environmental  incidents,  accidents,  or  complaints,  the  implementing  agency  and 
PIU will immediately report these to the PMU, executing agency and ADB. If required, corrective 
actions will be developed and agreed upon between the executing and implementing agencies, 
PMU and PIU, and any other relevant agencies.  
Social  safeguards  monitoring.  The  project  outcome  and  outputs  are  intended  to 
75. 
achieve  inclusive  livelihood  benefits  for  the  communities  in  the  project  area.  No  involuntary 
resettlement impacts will occur due to the project. Small numbers of one indigenous group, the 
Dukha  (“reindeer  people”)  occasionally  visit  Khuvsgul  Lake.  The  project  will  not  impact  on  the 
Dukha which visit Khuvsgul Lake (Section VII). A summary poverty reduction and social strategy 
(SPRSS)  has  been  prepared  and  includes  the  need  to  adhere  to  core  labor  standards  and 
design  the  project  eco-tourism  activities  to  be  culturally  sensitive.  The  PIU  will  immediately 
inform  the  PMU,  implementing  and  executing  agencies,  and  ADB,  of  any  unanticipated  social 
safeguard concerns. 
Gender  and  social  dimensions  monitoring. 51 The  PMU,  with  assistance  from  the 
76. 
social  and gender  specialist,  will  record  sex-disaggregated  data  and  information  on the  social, 
gender,  and  participatory  aspects  of  the  project  during  the  project  activities.  Monitoring  and 
evaluation  of  the  GAP  will  be  incorporated  into  the  project  reporting.  The  social  and  gender

specialist  will  prepare  an  annual  report  on  GAP  implementation  and  progress,  and  will  work 
closely with the project communities.  
C. 
Evaluation 
77. 
Project  performance  will  be  regularly  monitored and  rated  through  ADB’s  e-Operations 
project  implementation  module.  ADB’s  overall  grant  implementation  rating  will  be  made based 
on  five  performance  indicators:  technical,  procurement,  disbursement,  financial  management, 
and  safeguards  (Section  IX.B).  Such  rating  will  be updated  semi-annually  based  on  executing 
agency’s semi-annual project progress reports and/or ADB review missions.  
78. 
ADB will conduct an inception mission when the grant becomes effective. ADB and the 
government will jointly field review missions of the project at least once a year. The missions will 
(i)  review  overall  implementation  of  the  project  and  update,  in  consultation  with  the  executing 
agency, the project implementation schedule; (ii) examine existing and potential implementation 
problems,  and  find  out  measures  with  the  executing  agency  to  resolve  them;  (iii)  review 
progress  in  procurement  and  disbursement;  (iv)  review  the  grant  recipient's  compliance  with 
grant  covenants  and,  where  there  is  any  noncompliance  or  delay,  discuss  proposed  remedial 
measures; and (v) assess the likelihood of attaining the project’s outcome. 
ADB  and  the government  will  undertake a midterm  review  at  the  beginning  of the  third 
79. 
year  of  project  implementation,  to  assess  implementation  status  and  take  appropriate 
measures—including modification of scope and implementation arrangements, and reallocation 
of grant proceeds, as appropriate—to achieve the project’s outcomes and impact.  
80. 
A final ADB review mission will take place within six months after physical completion of 
the  project.  This  mission  will:  (i)  assess  project  performance  against  targets  and  benchmarks 
including  any  revision(s)  as  agreed  during  the  midterm  review;  (ii)  identify  any  incomplete 
activities,  or  unused  project  funds;  and  (iii)  determine  the  project  satisfactory  rating.  A  project 
completion  report  will  be  prepared,  in  cooperation  with  the  government.  In  case  the  project  is 
selected as a sample of projects for project performance evaluation reporting, the project will be 
subject  to more  detailed  performance  evaluation  and  impact  assessment  about  three  or  more 
years after completion.  
D. 
Reporting 
The  PMU,  on  behalf  of  the  executing  agency,  will  provide  ADB  with:  (i)  semi-annual 
81. 
project progress reports in a format consistent with ADB's project performance reporting system; 
(ii) updated procurement plan; (iii) updated implementation plan for each 12 months; and (iv) a 
project  completion  report 52  within  six  months  of  physical  completion  of  the  project.  The 
completion  report  will  present  the government’s assessment  of  the  project’s  effectiveness and 
will take account of findings of the ADB’s final review. To ensure that the project continues to be 
viable and sustainable, project accounts and the executing agency audited financial statements, 
together with the associated auditor's report, should be adequately reviewed.  
82. 
The  PMU  shall  include the  results  of  implementing the  EARF, GAP  and SPRSS  in the 
semi-annual  reports  to  be  submitted  by  the  executing  agency  to  ADB.  This  shall  include 
progress with implementation of the environmental management plan (EMP), grievance redress

43 
mechanism,  site  inspection  checklists,  and  any  completion  forms  by  the  soum  environmental 
inspectors. 
83. 
Donor  visibility. All project reports, training programs, seminars, workshops, materials, 
and equipment financed by the JFPR grant will clearly indicate the funding from the Government 
of  Japan  (GOJ)  and  display  the  JFPR  and  Japan  Official  Development  Assistance  logos.53 All 
project press releases issued by ADB will refer to the financial contribution from the GOJ.  The 
GOM, including the executing and implementing agencies, are requested to ensure that JFPR-
financed  activities  are  well  covered  by  local  print,  electronic  and  social  media,  and  that  all 
related publicity materials, official notices, reports and publications explicitly acknowledge Japan 
as  the  source  of  funding  received.  The  executing  and  implementing  agencies,  and  PMU  and 
PIU will collect and maintain a database of high-resolution photographs of the project activities, 
for use in project communication activities and for provision to the GOM, ADB, and Embassy of 
Japan in Mongolia, which may use them for public awareness and visibility purposes. 
84. 
Dissemination of project results to the Government of Japan. The PMU will provide 
the executing agency and ADB with reporting materials on the project activities, including  high 
resolution photos, testimonials from project recipients and implementers, publications, and other 
knowledge products. In turn, the ADB project team will provide this information to ADB’s Office 
of  Co-Financing  Operations–Japan  team,  as  well  as  back-to-office  reports,  inception,  midterm 
review, and completion reports.54 
E. 
Stakeholder Communication Strategy 
A  stakeholder  communication  strategy  has  been prepared for  the  project (Appendix  4). 
85. 
Khuvsgul Lake is revered in Mongolia as the “blue pearl” and “mother ocean”. It is a high-profile 
area  subject  to  frequent  media  coverage  as  well  as  increasing  government  and  private  sector 
attention  for  tourism.  The  project  requires  stakeholder  participation  and  ownership,  especially 
from local communities, tour operators, and guest house owners. The communication strategy 
prescribes timely and inclusive dissemination of project progress and the opportunity for public 
feedback. The strategy focuses on three objectives: (i) effective communication with the project 
stakeholders in the KLNP, to achieve informed and supportive engagement; (ii) project visibility 
and  media;  and  (iii)  coordination  and  alignment  of  the  project  activities  with  other  donor 
programs  at  the  KLNP.  The  integrated  model  of  the  project  will  be  promoted,  including  to 
agencies  elsewhere  in  Mongolia.  Public  disclosure  of  project  documents  and  activities  will  be 
made available through a project website, to be established after project effectiveness, as well 
as other dissemination approaches. Donor visibility (Section IX.D) is part of these activities. 
X. 
ANTICORRUPTION POLICY 
ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any violations of the 
86. 
Anticorruption  Policy  relating  to  the  project. 55  All  contracts  financed  by  ADB  shall  include 
provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the 
executing  agency  and  all  project  contractors,  suppliers,  consultants,  and  other  service 
providers.  Individuals  and/or  entities  on  ADB’s  anticorruption  debarment  list  are  ineligible  to 
participate in ADB-financed activity and may not be awarded any contracts under the project.56

44 
87. 
To support these efforts, relevant provisions are included in the grant agreement and will 
be  included  in  the  procurement  documents  and  consultant  contracts  financed  by  the  grant. 
These  key  risks  and  mitigating  measures  were  discussed  and  agreed  between  ADB  and  the 
grant  recipient  during  grant  processing  as  per  the  Second  Governance  and  Anticorruption 
Action Plan.  
XI. 
ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISM 
88. 
People  who  are,  or may  in the future  be,  adversely  affected  by  the  project  may  submit 
complaints  to  ADB’s  Accountability  Mechanism.  The  Accountability  Mechanism  provides  an 
independent  forum  and  process  whereby  people  adversely  affected  by  ADB-assisted  projects 
can voice, and seek a resolution of their problems, as well as report alleged violations of ADB’s 
operational  policies  and  procedures.  Before  submitting  a  complaint  to  the  Accountability 
Mechanism, affected people should make a good faith effort to solve their problems by working 
with  the  concerned  ADB  operations  department.  Only  after  doing  that,  and  if  they  are  still 
dissatisfied, should they approach the Accountability Mechanism.57  
XII. 
RECORD OF PAM CHANGES 
All revisions and/or updates during course of implementation should be retained in this 
89. 
Section to provide a chronological history of changes to implemented arrangements recorded in 
the PAM.

relevant  stakeholders  (especially  CSOs),  to  design  and  implement  a  water  quality  monitoring 
program tailored to measuring the project impacts. The assignment will comprise a single lump-
sum contract to support all costs (including staff, resources, analyses, reporting,  and travel) to 
conduct the following.

Utilize the  results  of the  rapid  waste management  assessment to be  conducted 
by the project waste management specialists, and supplement their results with a 
rapid  field  sampling  survey  of  water  quality  at  key  sites  (e.g.  sections  of  lake 
shoreline adjacent to tour camps and higher densities of residential settlements); 
Based on the results of the assessments, design and implement a water quality 
monitoring program that is tailored to measure the effects of the current project, 
especially  output  3.2.  The  program  will  include  specific  monitoring  locations, 
sampling  frequency  (sufficient  to  provide  a  rigorous  baseline  against  which  to 
measure  project  efforts),  a  consistent  and  replicable  method  for  sampling  and 
analysis, key stakeholders, roles and responsibilities, and costs; 
The  program  will  also  be  designed  to  be  as  simple  and  low  cost  as  possible, 
based on likely capacity and resources after the grant ends. For this purpose, the 
firm will need to identify potential agencies that may take over the program after 
the project and assess their financial and technical capacity and resources (see 
also point ix); 
Establish a program database, in a format that is (i) accessible to the executing 
and  implementing  agencies,  (ii)  compatible  with  the  monitoring  databases  of 
IRIMHE,  and  (iii)  enables  statistical  analyses,  including  the  rapid  preparation  of 
summary statistics for reporting; 
Prepare a monitoring manual in Mongolian and English language that describes 
all aspects of the program and is a reference guide for all stakeholders; 
Assess the capacity of the Murun branch of IRIMHE, NUM, and/or other relevant 
agencies to take over the monitoring program upon completion of the project; 
Provide capacity building to the Murun branch of IRIMHE, KLNP Administration, 
and  NUM  students  in  water  quality  monitoring  tailored  to  the  program,  through 
training  sessions  and  involving  them  in  the  field  sampling,  analyses  and 
reporting;

complement the program; 
(ix)  With  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies,  prepare  a  clear  hand-over 
strategy  for  the  water  quality  monitoring  program.  This  will  include  costs, 
proposed  financing  source,  recommended  agency(s)  to  continue  the  program 
after project completion, and assessment of their existing technical and financial 
capacity and resources to continue to program; and, 
Submit  semi-annual  progress  reports  and  a  final  report,  including  the  program

DETERMINATION OF OVERALL GRANT IMPLEMENTATION RATING 
A. 
Introduction 
This  section  describes  how  the  performance  of  Asian  Development  Bank’s  (ADB) 
1. 
financed  and  administered  sovereign  projects  will  be  monitored  and  rated  using  the 
eOperations  project  implementation  module.  A  project  is  defined  by  its  unique  design  and 
monitoring  framework  (DMF),  regardless  of  the  number  of  its  financing  instruments  or 
sources.  The  eOperations  is  an  integrated  information  technology  solution  that  records 
country  and  project  level  information  from  concept  to  ex-post  evaluation.  The  eOperations 
produces uniform project-related documentation and customized reports based on data that 
automatically moves through the system along a project cycle. 
2. 
The DMF summarizes how, assuming risks do not eventuate and assumptions hold 
true,  approved  inputs  will  resource  activities  to  achieve  measurable outputs,  outcome,  and 
contribute to a sector level impact.  
B. 
Portfolio Performance Indicators and Rating  
3. 
The purpose of portfolio performance rating is to establish the implementation status 
of  each  project.  This  will  enable  executing  agency  project  managers  and  project  team 
leaders to identify implementation problems and design effective remedial measures to get 
the project back on-track. 
Projects  are  rated  using  the  following  five  performance  indicators.  These  indicators 
4. 
have equal weight. 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
Technical.  Are  problems,  if  any  (e.g.,  quality  standards,  key  project 
require 
implementation  arrangements,  cost  overruns 
conditions, 
additional financing, etc.) identified by external supervision consultants and/or 
review  mission  reports  being  addressed?  (Yes/No).  Where  more  than  one 
problem is being addressed, each problem is rated as either being addressed 
(Yes)  or  not  (No).  To  calculate  the  overall  technical  indicator  rating,  a  yes 
rating  is  given  a  value  of  1  and  a  no  rating  a  value  of  0.  The  sum  of  these 
ratings is divided by the total number of problems and the threshold levels in 
below Table 1 are applied to define the indicator status. 
that 
Procurement. The difference between the cumulative actual and the current 
projected contract award values starting at grant effectiveness over the life of 
the  project.  The  current  projected  contract  award  ‘S-curve’  is  shown  in 
Section IV.J. The actual contract award values are derived quarterly from the 
financial system. 
Disbursement. The difference between the cumulative actual and the current 
projected  disbursements  starting  at  grant  effectiveness  over  the  life  of  the 
project. The  current  projected  disbursement  ‘S-curve’  derived  from the  PAM 
(Section  IV.F).  The  actual  contract  award  values  are  derived  quarterly  from 
the  financial  system.  Disbursement  data  will  be  automatically  sourced  from 
the  loan and grant financial  information  systems  to  trigger the  application of 
formula related to disbursement. 
Appendix 2 
67 
(iv) 
Financial  management.  Compliance with audit and/or  accounts  covenants: 
Has an acceptable annual audit report been received on time? (Yes/No). The 
default  is  Yes  until  the  due  date  as  defined  in  the  grant  agreement.  If  the 
audited  project  accounts  and  agency  financial  statements  have  not  been 
uploaded, and the indicator status has not been updated on or before the due 
date,  then  compliance  will  be  rated  No.  An  audit  report  is  unacceptable  if 
either  partial  or  incomplete  audited  project  accounts  or  agency  financial 
statements  are  submitted,  or  only  unaudited  project  accounts  and  financial 
statements  are  submitted.  An  audit  report  qualification  need  not  imply 
unacceptability.  The  acceptability  of  an  audit  report  with  audit  qualifications 
will  be  assessed  by  an  ADB  financial  management  specialist  based  on  the 
nature  of  the  qualification.  (PAI  5.07  defines  the  parameters  of  an 
assessment of acceptability.) Their assessment will be recorded in the project 
performance  report.  Where  there  is  more  than  one  set  of  audited  project 
accounts  and  agency  financial  statements  the  rating  method  for  covenants 
described in below para. 5 will apply. 
(v) 
Safeguards. Compliance with safeguard covenants: (i) environment (yes/no) 
(ii) resettlement (yes/no) (iii) indigenous people (yes/no). The default for each 
covenant is yes. Use the rating method for covenants described in para. 5. 
field  under 
the  performance  and/or  covenants 
5. 
Covenants. The status of compliance of each grant covenant is assessed as either 
yes—the  covenant  is  being  or  has  been  implemented,  or  no—the  covenant  is  not  being 
implemented.  The  compliance 
tab 
automatically  reports  the  status  as  “not  yet  due”  based  on  the  recorded  due  date  for  a 
covenant.  For  rating  purposes,  from  the  time  of  project  approval,  whether  due  or  not,  the 
system  will  compute  a  default  position  that  a  covenant  is  being  complied  with  (yes). 
Covenants  are  categorized  in  the  project  performance  information  system  under  the 
following categories—audited accounts, safeguards, social, sector, financial, economic, and 
others.  Covenant  compliance  is  rated  by  category  by  applying  the  following  criteria:  (i) 
satisfactory  (green)—all  covenants  in  the  category  are  being  complied  with  (yes),  with  a 
maximum of one exception (no) allowed; (ii) partly satisfactory (amber)—a maximum of two 
covenants  in the  category  are  not  being  complied  with (no);  and (iii)  unsatisfactory  (red)—
three or more covenants in the category are not being complied with (no). 
Rating.  It  will  use  a  three-level  traffic  light  applied  to  each  indicator,  and  to  the

Project  rating.  The five indicator ratings are aggregated into a single project rating 
7. 
by generating an average rating score for the project. The following values will be assigned 
to  each  rating  green=1  point,  amber=0.5  point,  and  red=0  point.  The  assigned  values  for 
each of the five indicators are summed and divided by 5 to produce an overall project rating 
score between 0 and 1. Applying the percentage thresholds only, a project with a total rating 
score greater than  or  equal  to  0.9  is  on-track (green);  a project  with  a total  rating score  of 
0.70–0.89 is a potential problem (amber); and a project with a total rating score of less than 
0.69 is an actual problem (red), and is at-risk (see Table 1).

INTRODUCTION 
This  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework  (EARF)  is  for  MON  (48216) 
1. 
Integrated Livelihoods Improvement and Sustainable Tourism in Khuvsgul Lake National Park, a 
four-year  (2016–2019)  project  to  support  local  livelihoods  through  improved  capacity  for 
sustainable  tourism  and  subsistence  activities.  Under  the  Asian  Development  Bank’s  (ADB) 
Safeguard Policy Statement (SPS, 2009), the project is categorized as “C” for the environment 
i.e.,  it  is  anticipated  to  cause  minimal  or  no  adverse  environmental  impacts.  No  formal 
environmental  assessment  and  management  procedure  is  required  for  category  C  projects, 
although environmental implications need to be reviewed. This EARF reviews the environmental 
implications  of  the  project  and  provides  a  simple  framework  for  environmental  management, 
monitoring, and reporting. The EARF has been prepared in compliance with ADB’s SPS (2009) 
and in consideration of the Mongolian Law on Environmental Impact Assessment (2012). 
The  project  is  located  in  Khuvsgul  Lake  National  Park  (KLNP),  in  Khuvsgul  aimag 
2. 
(province), northern Mongolia. (i) per capita income in five soums of Khuvsgul aimag increased; 
and (ii) management of natural resources in the KLNP improved. The expected project outcome 
will be livelihoods and sustainable tourism in five soums of the KLNP improved and integrated. 
The  project  has  three  outputs:  (i)  community-based  tourism  in  Khatgal  and  Khankh 
settlements59 promoted;  (ii)  capacity  for  sustainable  livestock  and  pasture  management  in  the 
KLNP  and  buffer  zone  improved;  and  (iii)  waste  management  around  Khuvsgul  Lake 
strengthened. 
3. 
Output  1  will  (i)  establish  the  first  pilot  comanagement  tourism  group  for  the  KLNP, 
comprising the KLNP Administration, communities, tour operators, and soum governments; (ii) 
develop  a  stakeholder  vision,  targets,  and  codes  of  practice  for  tourism;  and  (iii)  promote  and 
strengthen  community-based  tourism,  including  household-scale  enterprises  such  as  guiding, 
handicrafts, and the provision of food supplies to guest houses. 
4. 
Output  2  will  (i)  establish  herder  groups  among  the  herding  families  in  the  KLNP  and 
buffer  zone;  (ii)  establish  herder  management  plans  for  each  herder  group  that  are  tailored  to 
local conditions, including optimal stocking densities and pasture management; and (iii) support 
income diversification for herder families, especially those with limited opportunities for tourism-
based  income. Output  2  will  use  scientific  and traditional knowledge available for the  KLNP to 
support the herder management plans and improved grazing practices. 
Outputs 1 and 2 will be supported through a combination of specialist support, training, 
5. 
and the establishment of five community revolving funds (one per project soum). The funds will 
be  community-managed  and  support  household-scale  enterprises,  with  17%  of  the  grant 
proceeds  (an  average  of  $100,000  or  4%  per  soum)  channeled  into the funds.60 Funds  will  be 
held  in  one  bank  account  per  soum.  The  project  will  provide  financing  expertise,  training,  and 
initial  capital  for  the  first  4  years  for  the  communities  to  develop  and  manage  the  funds, 
including  the  establishment  of  fund  committees,  operating  procedures,  and  repayment  terms 
and  conditions.  Loans  will  be  limited  to  activities  compatible  with  outputs  1  and  2,  the  KLNP 
Management Plan, and domestic and ADB policies and regulations. The interest rate applied to 
loans will be low and reviewed regularly.61 Interest repayments over the 4-year project duration 
59 These are the two largest settlements (total population 4,600 in 2013) in the KLNP. 
60  A range of grant disbursement mechanisms were assessed, including the use of bank loans and/or credit unions. 
61  The rate will be slightly lower than the government's policy lending rate.

will  replenish  the  funds.  The  activity  is  aligned  with  Mongolia’s  Law  on  Buffer  Zones,  which 
provides a legal framework to support communities in protected areas and buffer zones. 
6. 
Output  3  will  (i)  implement  a  water  quality  monitoring  program  tailored  to  the  project 
activities,  including  a  rapid  assessment  of  threats  to  the  water  quality  of  Khuvsgul  Lake;  (ii) 
establish  a  pilot  community-led  waste  management  program,  including  waste  management 
teams, the installation of low environmental impact toilet facilities and litter bins, and the phasing 
in of public campsite fees to fund team salaries and facility operation and maintenance (O&M); 
and  (iii)  conduct  a  best-practice  review  on  the  internal  zoning  of the  KLNP,  including  scientific 
and traditional knowledge and stakeholder consultation, to identify zones that maximize benefits 
to livelihoods, tourism, and conservation.

No major environmental impacts by the project are anticipated. The project will support 
small-scale,  household  enterprises,  including  the  provision  of  small  equipment.  The  only 
facilities  to  be  constructed  will  be  small-scale  eco-toilets,  located  in  existing  cleared  public 
areas. The EARF will guide the process of screening proposed community enterprises to ensure 
alignment  with  protected  area  laws  and  the  KLNP  management  plan,  and,  for  the  specific 
positioning  of  the  facilities  (to  be  identified  in  the  first  year  of  project  implementation).  The 
EARF: (i) describes the project and its outputs; (ii) assesses the potential environmental impacts 
of  the  project  activities;  (iii)  specifies  the  procedures  for  screening  and  categorization  of 
activities,  meaningful  consultation  with  stakeholders,  and  information  disclosure  requirements; 
and (iv) describes the institutional arrangements, and monitoring and reporting procedures.

ASSESSMENT OF LEGAL FRAMEWORK AND INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY 
A. 
Legal Framework of Mongolia 
Mongolia  has  enacted  a  comprehensive  policy  and  legal  framework  for  environmental 
9. 
assessment and management. It has policies, legislation, and strategies in place to manage the 
protected  estate,  satisfy  its  international  obligations,  and  to  protect  the  quality  of  the 
environment for the health and well-being of its citizens. The hierarchy of policies and legislative 
provisions  for  environmental  management  in  Mongolia  comprises  several  layers  ranging  from 
the constitution to international treaties, and to environment and resources protection laws. 
10. 
The  basic  principle  of  the  Mongolian  state  environmental  policy  is  that  economic 
development  must  be  in  harmony  with  the  extraction  and  utilization  of  natural  resources,  and 
that air, water, and soil pollution will be controlled. In April 1996, Mongolia’s National Council for 
Sustainable  Development  was  established  to  manage  and  organize  activities  related  to 
sustainable development in the country. The country’s strategy is designed for environmentally 
friendly,  economically  stable,  and  socially  wealthy  development,  which  emphasizes  people  as 
the determining factor for long-term sustainable development. 
74 
Appendix 3 
In  recognition  of  its  global  responsibilities,  Mongolia  has  acceded  to  a  number  of 
11. 
international  environmental  conventions  (Table  1).  Each  convention  places  obligations  on 
signatory  governments  ranging  from  the  provision  of  a  legislative  basis  for  implementation, 
adherence  to  the  requirements  and  conditions  of  each  convention,  monitoring  implementation 
performance on a regular basis, and reporting on a regular basis to the conference of parties.

Environmental  assessment  requirements  of  Mongolia.  The  environmental  impact 
assessment (EIA) requirements of Mongolia are regulated by the Law on Environmental Impact 
Assessment (1998, revised in 2012). The terms of the law apply to all new projects, as well as 
rehabilitation and expansion of existing industrial, service, or construction activities and projects 
that use natural resources. The purpose of the law is environmental protection, the prevention of 
ecological  imbalance,  the  regulation  of  natural  resource  use,  and  the  assessment  of 
the 
environmental 
implementation of projects. The EIA process in Mongolia is summarized in Figure 1.

There  are  two  types  of  EIAs  defined  under  the  Law  on  Environmental  Impact 
14. 
Assessment (2012), as follows. 
(i) 
(ii) 
General  EIA  (GEIA).  To  initiate  a  GEIA,  the  project  proponent  submits  to  the 
Ministry  of  Environment,  Green  Development  and  Tourism  (MEGDT)  or  aimag 
government a brief description of the project, including feasibility study, technical 
details,  drawings,  baseline  description of the  project  environment,  and  a written 
opinion of the soum governor. These documents form the basis of the GEIA and 
MEGDT’s  assessment,  which  will  have  one  of  three  conclusions:  (a)  project  is 
rejected due to non-conformity with national laws and/or the severity of impacts; 
(b)  project  may  proceed,  subject  to  specific  conditions,  and  (iii)  a  detailed  EIA 
(DEIA) is necessary. Assessment by MEGDT generally takes 14 working days.  
Detailed  EIA.  The  scope  of  the  DEIA  is  defined  in  MEGDT’s  response  for  the 
GEIA.  The  DEIA  is  prepared  by  an  accredited  national  entity.  The  DEIA  is 
submitted  by  the  project  proponent  to  MEGDT  and  aimag  government.  The 
reviewer(s) of the GEIA also review the DEIA, generally within 18 working days, 
and  present  the  findings  to  the  MEGDT.  Based  on  the  content  of  the  DEIA, 
reviewer  conclusions,  and  any  additional  comments  by  MEGDT  departments, 
MEGDT issues a decision on whether to approve or reject the project. 
15. 
The DEIA is required to contain the following chapters: (i) environmental baseline data; 
(ii)  analysis  of  extent  and  distribution  of  adverse  impacts;  (iii)  measures  to  minimize,  mitigate, 
and/or  avoid  impacts;  (iv)  alternative  methods  and  technology;  (v)  risk  assessment;  (vi) 
including 
environmental  management  plan  (EMP);  and  (vii)  stakeholder  consultations, 
potentially affected communities.

ADB Environmental Safeguard Requirements 
16. 
Safeguard Policy Statement (SPS). Environmental safeguards requirements, including 
EIA requirements, are defined in ADB’s SPS (2009).62 All projects funded by ADB must comply 
with the ADB’s SPS (2009) to ensure they are (i) environmentally sound; (ii) designed to operate 
in compliance with applicable domestic regulatory requirements; and (iii) are not likely to cause 
significant  environmental,  health,  or  safety  hazards.  The  SPS  promotes  international  good 
practice  as  reflected  in  internationally  recognized  standards  such  as  the  World  Bank  Group’s 
Environmental, Health and Safety Guidelines (2007).63 
III. 
ANTICIPATED ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS 
This  section  summarizes  the  potential  environmental  impacts  of  the  project,  based  on 
17. 
assessment of the planned activities under each output. 
Output  1:  Community-based  tourism 
18. 
in  Khatgal  and  Khankh  settlements 
promoted.  Activities  under  this  output  comprise  non-structural  measures  of  improving 
stakeholder coordination and co-management, strengthening tourism codes of practice for lake 
protection, and supporting small-scale household enterprises for local tourism. Local enterprises 
will  include  training  and  the  provision  of  small  equipment  or  gear  for  tourism  guiding, 
62 ADB’s  SPS  is  available  in  English  and  Mongolian  language  at:  http://www.adb.org/documents/safeguard-policy-

handicrafts,  and  improving  the  reliability  of  existing  supply  of  dairy,  meat,  and  vegetable 
products  to  guest  houses.  None  of  these  activities  involve  construction.  All  activities  will  be 
screened against the project criteria to avoid environmental impacts and ensure alignment with 
the KLNP management objectives (Section IV). No environmental impacts are anticipated. 
19. 
Output 2: Capacity for sustainable livestock and pasture management in the KLNP 
and  buffer  zone  improved.  Activities  under  this  output  comprise  non-structural  measures  of 
improving  the  sustainability  of  livestock  herding  and  pasture  management,  training,  and 
household-based income diversification, especially for poor families in the buffer zone. This will 
include  training  and  the  provision  of  small  equipment  e.g.  dairy  processing  units.  All  activities 
will  be  screened  against  the  project  criteria  to  avoid  environmental  impacts  and  ensure 
alignment  with  the  KLNP  management  objectives  (Section  IV).  No  environmental  impacts  are 
anticipated. 
20. 
Output  3:  Waste  management  around  Khuvsgul  Lake  strengthened.  This  output 
includes the  installation of  pilot  eco-toilets. The specific  number  and  location of these facilities 
will  be  identified  in  the  first  year  of  project  implementation.  All  facilities will  be:  (i)  small  toilets 
and septic tanks, installed in existing tourism lodges and camps, homes, and/or existing public 
toilet blocks; (ii) located in existing public areas which are already cleared and subject to regular 
human  activity;  (iii)  located  in  the  KLNP  Tourism  and  Limited  Use  Zones,  in  compliance  with 
Mongolia’s  Law  on  Special  Protected  Areas,  where  small-scale  facilities  and  human  activities 
are  permitted;  (iv)  non-flushing,  composting  systems  which  do  not  impose  new  pressures  on 
water resources; (v) constructed above ground, on a small sealed surface, to avoid infiltration of 
waste  products  to  soil  or  groundwater;  (vi)  made  of  pre-fabricated  materials  (e.g.,  toilet  seats) 
and/or locally sourced materials from nearby towns; (vii) independently operated, and which do 
not  require  the  construction  of  wastewater  pipeline  networks  or  treatment  plants;  (viii) 
maintained  by  the  tour  camp  operators  and/or  residents  according  to  clear  operating 
procedures,  including  recycling  of  the  sanitized  waste  products  and/or  disposal  in  the  existing 
soum  waste  center  (10  km  south  of  Khuvsgul  Lake);  and  (ix)  climate  resilient  due  to 
independence from the use of limited water resources, and, avoiding the mechanical impacts of 
freezing  and  thawing  by  being  located  above  subsurface  strata.  None  of  these  measures  will 
cause  environmental  impacts  to  the  KLNP.  All  are  aimed  at  reducing  existing  pollution  to  soil 
and water from inadequate waste disposal and management.  
21. 
In  summary,  (i)  the  project  does  not  involve  any  major  infrastructure  construction  or 
activities  which  could  generate  major  environmental  impacts,  especially  to  the  land,  soil,  and 
water resources of Khuvsgul Lake; (ii) project activities will comply with the KLNP Management 
Plan  and  Mongolia’s  Law  on  Special  Protected  Areas  and  Law  on  Buffer  Zones;  (iii)  the 
installation  of  eco-toilets,  and  small-scale  activities  proposed  during  implementation,  will  be 
subject to the procedures of this EARF; and (iv) the project emphasis is on local livelihoods. All 
activities  will  be  conducted  with  the  participatory  involvement  of  communities  and  other 
stakeholders.  
22. 
Environmental  benefits.  The  project  is  expected  to  achieve  environmental  benefits. 
Project  activities  contribute  to  the  conservation  objectives  of  the  KLNP  Management  Plan 
(2014) and Mongolia’s Law on Special Protected Areas and Law on Buffer Zones, by helping to 
improve  the  protection  and  management  of  land  and  water  resources  in  a  protected  area. 
Improved  stakeholder  coordination  and  community-based  tourism  will  increase  the  efficiency 
and sustainability of natural resource use in the park. Raising community capacity for livestock 
and  pasture  management  will  address  current  issues  of  over-grazing,  declining  grazing  land, 
and  associated  land  degradation.  Strengthening  local  capacity  for  waste  disposal  and 
Appendix 3 
79 
management  will  help  address  one  of  the  greatest  threats  to  the  KLNP,  pollution  of  Khuvsgul 
Lake and its surrounding lands and streams due to unmanaged sewage. The project emphasis 
on  stakeholder  collaboration  will  strengthen  park  management  by  the  park  administration, 
communities, and local government. 
IV. 
ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT FOR PROJECT ACTIVITIES 
23. 
The project is category C for environment and only activities likely to have minimal or no 
adverse environmental impacts will be implemented. No environmental assessment and formal 
procedure  is  required  for  category  C  projects  although  environmental  implications  need  to  be 
reviewed.  This  section  provides  a  simple  procedure  for  screening  of  small-scale,  household 
income  diversification  activities  (under  outputs  1  and  2)  and  installation  of  the  pilot  eco-toilet 
facilities  (under  output  3).  The  KLNP  Administration  (the  implementing  agency)  and  project 
implementation  unit (PIU)  (the  latter  under  the  project  management  unit, PMU)  will  have main 
responsibility to implement the EARF (Table 3). 
STEP 1: SCREENING OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS 
Step 1.1. Exclusion criteria. Activities which involve the following will not be supported 
24. 
by the project. 
(i) 
(ii) 
Involuntary resettlement, land acquisition, or influx of workers. 
Infrastructure  construction  and  major  civil  works,  including  major  earthworks, 
dams,  irrigation,  drainage  works,  roads,  land  clearance,  or  significant  heavy 
vehicle traffic. 
(iii) 
Exposure to hazardous waste. 
Installation of facilities within 200 meters of Khuvsgul Lake.64 
(iv) 
(v) 
Intensification of land (and pasture) use with resulting environmental degradation.

(xi) 
(xii) 
25. 
Step  1.2.  National  screening  requirements––GEIA.  MEGDT  has  advised  that  the 
small-scale project activities, which are intended to result in environmental benefits, probably do 
not  require  a  GEIA.  This  will  be  confirmed  at  the  stage  of  detailed  design.  The  implementing 
agency  and  PIU  will  submit  the  proposed  project  activities  and  designs  to  the  MEGDT 
Department  of  Protected  Areas  Management  (DPAM)  (the  executing  agency).  The  DPAM  will 
64  In compliance with the national standard MNS 6424: 2013 Eco-Tourism Development in Protected Areas. 
65 Category  A:  likely  to  have  significant  adverse  environmental  impacts  that  are  irreversible,  diverse,  or 
unprecedented.  These  impacts  may  affect  an  area  larger  than  the  sites  or  facilities  subject  to  physical  works. 
Category  B:  potential  adverse  environmental  impacts  are  less  adverse  than  those  of  category  A  projects.  These 
impacts  are  site-specific,  few  if  any  of  them  are  irreversible,  and  in  most  cases  mitigation  measures  can  be 
designed more readily than for category A projects (ADB Safeguard Policy Statement, 2009). 
80 
Appendix 3 
submit  the  designs  to  the  MEGDT  Department  of  Environment  and  Natural  Resources 
Management (DENR), which will assess whether a GEIA is required. If a GEIA is required, the 
DPAM will request DENR to conduct the GEIA. The DPAM will provide the following information: 
(i)  description  of  the  project  activity,  location  map,  and  designs;  (ii)  baseline  environmental 
description of the project area; (iii) written opinion of the soum governor regarding relevance of 
the activity to local development programs; and (iv) copy of relevant certificates of land tenure 
and  use.  The  DPAM  and  DENR,  not  the  PMU,  PIU,  or  project  grant,  will  be  responsible  for 
preparation and submission of these materials, including payment for any required specialists or 
costs. 
26. 
Step 1.3. ADB screening requirements. As a category C project, all planned activities, 
and  any  new  activities  that  may  be  identified  during  implementation,  must  comply  with  the 
exclusion  criteria  in  Step  1.1  and  meet  ADB’s  requirement  of  minimal  or  no  adverse  impacts. 
During preparation of the detailed designs for each activity, the PIU and PMU will provide a brief 
review  with  conclusions  to  the  DPAM  and  ADB  confirming  that  the  activities  conform  to  the 
scope of the project design and the reasons for why no environmental impacts are anticipated. 
STEP 2: PRE-CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES 
27. 
Step  2.1.  Environment management  plan.  A simple environmental management plan 
(EMP) has been prepared to mitigate any potential negative impacts and health and safety risks 
during  project  activities,  including  installation  of  the  pilot  eco-toilets  (Appendix  2).  The  EMP 
includes  basic  requirements  for  implementation  and  supervision  of  works.  It  requires  the 
contractor  and/or  community  member(s)  to  plan  for  the  activity,  including  work  schedule  and 
consultation  with  residents  and  other  stakeholders,  and  defines  prohibited  activities,  good 
environmental  and  housekeeping  practices,  occupational  health  and  safety  and  community 
health and safety requirements, and reporting and communication requirements. The EMP will 
be included in the tender documents and attached to each civil works contract. The contractors 
are required to follow these requirements. It is anticipated that most (if not all) of the eco-toilets 
will  be  piloted  by  local  residents  and  lodge  owners,  with local  hired  labor,  rather  than  external 
contractors. 
28. 
Step  2.2.  Preparation  of tender  documents  and  evaluation  of  bids. Civil works and 
equipment  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2015,  as 
amended from time to time). The PIU will incorporate this EARF including the EMP (Appendix 2) 
and  environmental  clauses  (Appendix  3)  as  specifications  in  the  tender  documents  for 
contractors.  The  PMU  will  assist  MEGDT  in  the  bid  evaluation  process  and  assessing 
compliance with the specifications (to be documented in a bid evaluation report).  
Step  2.3.  Preparation  of  contractor  site-EMPs.  After  contract  awarding  but  before 
29. 
construction commencement, each civil work contractor will develop a small site-EMP based on 
the  EMP,  additional  site  investigations,  and  consultation  with  residents.  If  new  environmental 
issues are identified, corresponding measures shall be defined in the site-EMP. The contractor 
shall  assign  the  site  manager  to  coordinate  site-EMP  implementation.  No  construction  shall 
commence without clearance of the site-EMP by the DPAM.  
30. 
Step  2.4.  Confirmation  of  project  readiness.  After  contract  award  but  before 
construction  commencement,  the  KLNP  Administration  and  PIU  shall  check  that:  (i)  the 
contractor  has  prepared  a  site-EMP  which  complies  with  the  EMP  and  contract  clauses 
Appendix 3 
81 
(Appendices 2 and 3) and appointed the site manager as coordinator; and (ii) the contractor has 
disclosed information to local residents about the civil works and site-EMP. 
31. 
Costs for the contractor and procurement of goods and works for installation of the eco-
toilets, and/or small equipment for small-scale household livelihood activities, will be supported 
by the project grant.  
STEP 3: CONSTRUCTION (E.G., INSTALLATION) PHASE ACTIVITIES 
32. 
Step  3.1.  Implementation  of  the  site-EMP.  During  construction,  the  contractor  has 
overall  responsibility  for  site-EMP  implementation.  The  contractor  will  cover  the  costs  for  any 
required  mitigation  measures.  The  contractor  will  consult  with  the  PIU,  KLNP  Administration, 
and  residents  as  necessary  so  that  stakeholders  are  informed  of  progress.  The  KLNP 
Administration and PIU will support the contractor with consultations (Table 3). 
33. 
Step  3.2.  Supervision, site inspections,  and  public  consultation. During installation 
of  facilities,  the  PIU  and  KLNP  Administration  will  conduct  regular  site  inspections  to  assess 
contractor compliance with the site-EMP. Inspections shall be at least twice a month, and follow 
the site inspection checklist for the project (Appendix 4). The PIU will fill out the checklist during 
these  inspections  and  submit  them  to  the  KLNP  Administration  and  PMU  as  part  of  the  semi-
annual progress reporting. In the event of any violations, accidents, or risks to the environment, 
the contractor will notify the KLNP Administration and PIU immediately.  Public consultation will 
mainly rely on informal discussions with residents, guest house operators, and soum officials.  
Step 3.3. Construction completion, audits, and reporting. At the end of construction, 
34. 
a completion audit will be conducted by the soum environment inspector to ensure the safety of 
each facility and conformity with the agreed design.  Given the low impact and minor nature of 
the civil works, inspections will be conducted as needed. The PIU will prepare a brief completion 
report for the activity, including a copy of the inspector’s certification of completion, and submit 
this with the project semi-annual reports. 
STEP 4: OPERATION PHASE 
35. 
The completed facilities and/or livelihood equipment will be operated and maintained by 
the  tour  camp  operators  and  residents  respectively,  according  to  operational  procedures  that 
will be designed by the relevant stakeholders with support from the PIU specialists. Composted 
waste  in the eco-toilets will  be  recycled  or transferred  by  sealed  container to  the  aimag  waste 
center. The KLNP Administration will conduct inspections of the facilities as needed. 
V. 
CONSULTATION, INFORMATION DISCLOSURE, AND GRIEVANCE REDRESS 
MECHANISM 
A. 
Consultation and Participation 
36.  Meaningful  public  consultation  and  participatory  planning  with  stakeholders  is  a  key 
approach for the  project  and is  embedded  in all  project  activities.  Meaningful  consultation  is  a 
process that (i)  begins early  in  the  project  preparation stage and is  carried  out  on  an  ongoing 
basis  throughout  the  project  cycle;  (ii)  provides  timely  disclosure  of  relevant  and  adequate 
information that is understandable and readily accessible to affected people; (iii) is undertaken 
in an  atmosphere free  of  intimidation or  coercion;  (iv)  is gender  inclusive  and responsive,  and 
82 
Appendix 3 
tailored to the needs of disadvantaged and vulnerable groups; and (v) enables the incorporation 
of  all  relevant  views  of  affected  people  and  other  stakeholders  into  decision  making,  such  as 
project design, mitigation measures, the sharing of development benefits and opportunities, and 
implementation issues. 
37. 
Consultations  and  meetings  will  be  led  by  the  pilot  co-management  group  to  be 
established under output 1, comprising community representatives, KLNP Administration, soum 
governments,  and  tour  operators.  Consultations  will  include  other  key  stakeholders  as 
necessary,  especially  civil  society  organizations  (CSOs),  will  be  culturally  sensitive,  and 
conducted  in  a  manner  commensurate  with  the  impacts  or  benefits  to  affected  communities. 
The  consultation  process  shall  also  be  used  to  introduce  and  discuss  the  project  grievance 
redress mechanism (GRM; Section V.C). 
38. 
Stakeholder consultations for the project shall be documented by the PIU and included 
in  the  project  progress  reports.  This  shall  include  details  of  any  project-related  environmental 
issues  and  concerns  raised  by  stakeholders  and  how  these  will  be  addressed  by  the  project. 
Proof  of  consultations  such  as  attendance  sheets,  minutes  of  meetings  and  pictures  shall  be 
included in the documentation. A sample template for the consultation record is in Appendix 5. 
B. 
Information Disclosure 
39. 
The PIU will be responsible for ensuring that: (i) all project public information, including 
results  of  consultations,  is  stored  as  part  of  the  project  record;  and  (ii)  are  made  available  to 
stakeholders, in a form, language and at a location in which they can be easily accessed by all 
stakeholders including affected people. 
C. 
Grievance Redress Mechanism 
The PIU shall establish and maintain the project GRM to receive and facilitate resolution 
40. 
of  any  environment-related  concerns  or  grievances  about  the  project.  The  GRM  will  address 
affected  people’s  issues  promptly,  using  an  understandable  and  transparent  process  that  is 
gender responsive, culturally  appropriate,  and readily  accessible to  all  stakeholders  at  no  cost 
and  without  retribution.  The  GRM  does  not  impede  access  to  the  national  legal  system.  All 
project  agencies  (Table  3)  will  be  aware  of  the  GRM  and  inform  the  PIU  of  any  complaints 
received.  The  GRM  will  be  introduced  during  community  consultations  and  made  publicly 
available to stakeholders throughout the project. In the event of a grievance issue, up to three 
stages will be implemented, as follows. 
(i) 
(ii) 
Stage 1 (maximum 7 days): If a concern arises during construction, the affected 
person  may  raise  the  issue  with  the  contractor,  KLNP  Administration,  PIU,  or 
community or soum representatives. All agencies will be aware of the GRM and 
will  be  requested  to  immediately  report  any  incidents  to  the  PIU.  If  the  issue  is 
resolved  directly  between  the  affected  person  and  contractor,  no  follow-up  is 
required. 
Stage 2 (maximum 7 days): If the issue is not resolved, the affected person can 
submit  an  oral  or  written  complaint  to  the  KLNP  Administration.  The  KLNP 
Administration  and  PIU  will  reply  within  one  week  and  keep  a  written  record  of 
the whole process. 
Appendix 3 
83 
(iii) 
Stage  3  (maximum  10  days):  If  the  issue  is  still  not  resolved,  the  PIU  will,  if 
agreed  by  the  affected  person,  arrange  a  meeting  with  MEGDT,  PIU,  and 
relevant  community  and  soum  representatives  to  identify  a  solution.  This 
meeting,  and  implementation  of  the  solution,  will  be  achieved  within  10  days.  If 
the  issue  still  cannot  be  resolved  it  will  be  referred  to  the  relevant  higher 
authorities. The PMU may report the process to ADB at any of Stages 1–3, but 
will do so immediately if Stage 3 is reached. 
VI. 
INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES 
41. 
Implementation  and  institutional  arrangements  for  the  project  agencies,  and  roles  and 
responsibilities,  are  summarized  in  Table  3.  MEGDT’s  DPAM  is  the  executing  agency.  The 
KLNP  Administration  (comprising  the  park  director  and  staff)  is  the  implementing  agency.  A 
steering committee, chaired by the  Director General of DPAM, will be established to guide the 
project  and  will  include  government  agencies,  CSOs,  and  community  representatives.  The 
DPAM  and  KLNP  Administration  will  be  supported  by  a  PMU  and  PIU,  based  in  Ulaanbaatar 
and  the  KLNP,  respectively,  which  will  comprise  a  team  of  individually  contracted  specialists. 
PMU and PIU staff costs will be supported by the project. 
42. 
The  PIU  will  be  responsible  for  implementation  of  the  EARF,  supported  by  the  KLNP 
Administration. The executing agency,  and other relevant MEGDT departments, especially the 
DENR, will provide support when needed (Table 3). Due to the simple nature of this EARF and 
presence  of  qualified  environmental  staff  within  the  MEGDT  and  KLNP  Administration,  no 
specialist environmental staff will be recruited in the PIU or PMU to implement this EARF. The 
requirement  for  application  of  this  EARF  to  all  project  activities  is  included  in  the  terms  of 
reference  for  all  PIU  team  members  (Appendix  1).  In  the  (unlikely)  event  a  GEIA  and  DEIA 
(Section  IV)  are required,  MEGDT,  not  the  project,  would  be  responsible for the  provision  and 
payment of any required specialist services and costs.

VII.  MONITORING AND REPORTING 
43.  Monitoring.  Due  to  the  minor  scope  of  works,  no  detailed  environmental  monitoring 
(e.g., water and air quality) will be implemented. Instead, an environmental supervision checklist 
(Appendix 3) will be used to monitor compliance of contractors with the site-EMPs. This will be 
complemented by the water quality monitoring program to be established by the project (under 
86 
Appendix 3 
output 3). The program will include sections of Khuvsgul Lake subject to point-source pollution 
from tour camps, including sites at which the eco-toilets will be piloted.  
44. 
Reporting.  The PIU will provide semi-annual project progress reports to the PMU. The 
PMU  will  review  and  compile  these,  and  provide  semi-annual  progress  reports  to  the  DPAM, 
project  steering  committee,  and  ADB.  These  progress  reports  will  document:  (i)  project 
implementation status; (ii) status of financial management; (iii) results of procurement for goods 
and  works;  (iv)  results  of  project  activities  (e.g.  training);  (v)  analysis  of  any  monitoring  data 
against  relevant  standards;  (vi)  implementation  of  the  EARF  (e.g.,  environmental  mitigation 
measures 
implemented,  construction  monitoring,  contractor  performance,  completion 
inspections,  any  incidents  or  complaints  received,  GRM  implementation,  and  what  corrective 
actions  were  undertaken).  Given  the  small  and  simple  scope  of  this  EARF,  separate 
environmental reports to ADB, and more frequent reporting (e.g., quarterly) is not required. 
45. 
Documentation  and  data  storage.  The  PIU  will  be  responsible  for  maintaining 
systematic and organized records for all project information, including environmental documents 
and reports.

Appendix 3 
ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PLAN (EMP) 
This  EMP  is  developed  for  the  Integrated  Livelihoods  Improvement  and  Sustainable 
1. 
Tourism  in  Khuvsgul  Lake  National  Park  project.  It  defines  the  basic  requirements  for 
implementation and supervision of minor civil works. The EMP requires the contractor to plan for 
construction, 
including  consultation  with  potentially  affected  stakeholders  e.g.  nearby 
communities. It also defines good environmental and housekeeping practices, occupational and 
community health and safety requirements, and communication requirements. The EMP will be 
included in the tender documents and will form part of all civil works contracts. Contractors are 
expected  to  follow  these  requirements  and  develop  site-specific  EMPs  (site-EMPs)  for 
implementing  these  measures.  The  contractors  will  be  made  aware  of  their  obligations  to 
comply with this EMP, and to budget EMP implementation costs in their bids.
