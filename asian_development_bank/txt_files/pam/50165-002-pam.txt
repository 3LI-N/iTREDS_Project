PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
1.  The project will construct river walls and raise ground levels that will protect Phuentsholing 
township from floods and riverbank erosion. It will also develop common infrastructure for 
about  66  hectares  (ha)  of  new  urban  land  for  safe  and  sustainable  expansion  of  human 
settlements and commercial activities. It will also support capacity development for improved 
flood risk management and delivery of urban services. 
2.  The project is aligned with the following impacts: (i) balanced and sustainable development 
of  human  settlements  ensured;1  and  (ii)  smart  growth  principles  applied  in  planning  and 
development.2  The  project  will  have  the  following  outcome:  Phuentsholing’s  urban  area 
protected  from  floods  and  expanded  with  improved  amenities  and  services.3  The  project 
outputs are:   
Output 1: Flood and erosion protection measures installed. The riverbank protection 
works  will  protect  Phuentsholing from flooding  and  erosion.  Specifically,  the  project  will 
(i) construct 4 kilometers (km) of erosion-resilient river walls to protect against 100-year 
probable flood; (ii) raise ground levels behind the new walls to reclaim at least 66 ha of 
flood-protected land for urban development; and (iii) establish and operationalize a flood 
early warning system and flood management plan in consultation with the community.  
Output 2: Municipal infrastructure constructed. The project will provide serviced plots 
of land by constructing common urban infrastructure comprising (i) about 10 km of roads 
with  footpaths,  landscaping,  and  streetlights,  which  are  planned  in  consultation  with 
women;  (ii)  modern  drinking  water  supply  and  distribution  systems,  and  wastewater 
collection and treatment systems that service the new township and adjoining areas; (iii) a 
resource recovery system for managing solid waste in both the new and old townships; 
and (iv) power distribution and telecommunication systems throughout the new township. 
The  plots  will  be  leased  to  residential  and  commercial  investors  as  prescribed  by  the 
Amochhu Development Master Plan, which emphasizes principles of sustainable urban 
design such as maximum walkability, greenery, and open spaces.  
Output 3: Township management systems installed. The project will (i) establish asset 
management systems, (ii) build the capacity of township staff to ensure sustainable and 
effective urban management, and (iii) initiate investor promotion activities.  
3.  The  project  will  develop  Zone  A  of  the  government’s  much  larger  Amochhu  Land 
Development and Township Project (ALDTP) which is divided into five zones: A to E. Zone 
D represents Kaileshwar Hill and is not included for development. The remaining four zones 
comprise developing Amochhu River riparian land that will ultimately require about 15 km of 
new  riverbank  protection  and  the  installation  of  about  464  ha  of  new  common  urban 
infrastructure  (roads,  water  supply,  waste  water  management,  municipal  solid  waste 
management,  power  and  telecommunications).  At  its  completion,  ALDTP  will  support 
habitation for up to 50,000 people. The allocation of land and riverbank protection for the 
ALDTP’s four development zones are shown in Table 1.

4.  Implementation  of  ALDTP  will  be  phased  in  relation  to  the  scale  and  demand  for 
development. The Phuentsholing Township Development Project (PTDP) is the first phase 
of  ALDTP  and  will  finance  ALDTP’s  Zone  A  and  support  the  preparation  of  subsequent 
zones that will be developed in the future under separate financing. 
5.  The project mainly comprises the following five works packages and six consulting packages 
as described in Section 3: 
(i)  CW-01: River training and land reclamation. This package includes construction 
of  river  training,  embankment  protection,  land  filling,  cross  drainage,  slope 
stabilization and river promenade finishing.  
(ii)  CW-02:  Common  urban  infrastructure.  This  package  includes  the  construction 
and 5 years operations and maintenance (O&M) of roads, footpaths, street lighting, 
drains,  water  supply  infrastructure,  sanitation  infrastructure,  and  solid  waste 
management sorting and transfer station.4 A supervisory control and data acquisition 
(SCADA) system will be installed at the water production facilities and bulk meters 
and at the sewage treatment plant, with the option to expand SCADA in the future to 
increasingly cover more assets linked into city management system. The package 
also includes landscaping and park development, and maintenance of greenery and 
the construction of CDCL’s office building5 within the new township. The contractor 
shall  provide  as-built  digital  drawings  of  all  new  assets.  The  contractor  shall  also 
prepare  an  O&M  manual  for  the  new  assets  and  provide  related  training  to 
Phuentsholing Thromde staff. 
(iii) CW-03:  Flood early warning system. This package will install a flow monitoring 
system  on  the  Amochhu  River  upstream  of  Phuentsholing  that  is  integrated  into 
Bhutan’s existing flood early warning system.  
(iv) CW-04: Power transmission infrastructure. This package includes the installation 
of  the  power  transmission  and  distribution  network  and  will  be  implemented  by 
Bhutan Power Corporation. It will be fully financed by the government.  
(v)  CW-05: ICT infrastructure. This package includes the installation of the information 
and  communications  technology  infrastructure  to  be  implemented  by  Bhutan 
Telecommunications. It will be fully financed by the government.

IV. 
COSTS AND FINANCING 
7.  The  cost  of  the  project  is  estimated  at  $63.00  million,  inclusive  of  taxes  and  duties,  and 
financing charges during implementation. The ADB grant will be used exclusively to finance 
civil  works.  The  ADB  loan  will  finance  (i)  part  of  the  civil  works  cost;  and  (ii)  the  cost  of 
consulting  services.  The  government  will  (i)  provide  exemptions  of  taxes  and  duties  on 
import  of  construction  materials,  plant  and  machinery,  and  capital  goods  forming  direct 
inputs  to  the  project,  and  (ii)  cover  financing  charges  on  the  ADB  loan  during 
implementation. The government will also ensure that DHI provides contributions equivalent 
to cover (i) remaining taxes and duties; (ii) salaries and running costs of PMU and PIU; (iii) 
part of the civil works costs; and (iv) training.

a   Includes taxes and duties of $0.13 million. Such amount does not represent an excessive share of the project cost. 
The government will finance taxes and duties of $0.13 million in the form of a cash contribution. The government will 
also  exempt  import  duties  on  civil  works  contracts  to  be  financed  by  the  project;  the  value  of  this  exemption  is 
estimated to be $2.43 million. 
b  In March 2017 prices. 
c   Physical contingencies computed at 10% for civil works and equipment. Price contingencies computed at average 
of 0.3%-1.5% on foreign exchange costs and 4.0%-5.0% on local currency costs; includes provision for  potential 
exchange rate fluctuation under the assumption of a purchasing power parity exchange rate. 
d   Includes interest and commitment charges. Interest during construction for the OCR loan has been computed at the 
applicable interest rate during the grace period (1.0% per annum). 
Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. 
8.  The government has requested (i) a concessional loan in an amount of $28.74 million from 
ADB’s ordinary capital resources, and (ii) a grant not exceeding $24.26 million from ADB’s 
Special Funds resources (Asian Development Fund), both to help finance part of the project. 
The concession loan will have a 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years; an interest 
rate of 1.0% per year during the grace period and 1.5% per year thereafter; and such other 
terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. The loan proceeds 
will  be  provided by  the  government to  DHI  as  a  subsidiary  loan.  The  subsidiary  loan  will 
have repayment terms of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, interest rate at 1% 
interest per annum during the grace period, and 2.55% thereafter. The grant will be provided 
as grant to DHI. 
9.  The summary financing plan is in Table 5. ADB will finance the expenditures in relation to 
civil works and consulting services.

A. 
Cost Estimates Preparation and Revisions  
10. Cost estimates were prepared by ADB in consultation with CDCL. Cost estimates for civil 
works and equipment were based on estimates prepared by the CDCL consultant, which 
were in turn based on the Bhutan Schedule of Rates for 2016. During implementation, the 
PIU  will  be  responsible  for  updating  cost  estimates,  subject  to  approval  by  the  PMU. 
Revisions to planned withdrawal allocations will require prior approval from ADB. 
B. 
Key Assumptions 
11. The following key assumptions underpin the cost estimates and financing plan:

FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT 
A. 
Financial Management Assessment 
13. The  financial  management  assessment  (FMA)  was  carried  out  from  September  2016  to 
January  2017  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  Guidelines  for  the  Financial  Management  and 
Analysis  of  Projects  and  the  Financial  Due  Diligence:  A  Methodology  Note.  The  FMA 
considered the capacity of CDCL including funds flow arrangements, staffing, accounting 
and  financial  reporting  systems,  financial  information  systems,  and  internal  and  external 
auditing  arrangements.  Based  on  the  assessment,  the  key  financial  management  risks 
identified are: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
Entity-Specific Risks: CDCL has no direct expertise in implementing ADB projects. 
Funds Flow Risk: potential delays in reconciliation of project account with advance 
accounts, resulting in delayed preparation of withdrawal applications. 
Internal Audit Risk: Internal Audit Section in CDCL is relatively new (set up in 2015) 
and small (one full-time employee) 
14. It is concluded that the overall pre-mitigation financial management risk of CDCL is low. DHI 
and  CDCL  have  agreed  to  implement  an  action  plan  as  key  measures  to  address  the 
deficiencies. The financial management action plan is provided in Table 7.

B. 
Disbursement 
1. 
Disbursement Arrangements for ADB Funds 
15. The  loan  and  grant  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  Loan 
Disbursement Handbook (2015, as amended from time to time), and detailed arrangements 
agreed  upon  between  the  government  and  ADB.  Online  training  for  project  staff  on 
disbursement policies and procedures is available.6 Project staff are encouraged to avail of 
this training to help ensure efficient disbursement and fiduciary control. 
16. Channeling  of  loan  and  grant  proceeds. The  proposed ADB  loan  and  grant  would  be 
channeled to the government in US Dollar, and the government will on-lend the loan and 
pass on the grant to DHI. The subsidiary loan will have a 32-year term, including an 8-year 
grace period. The subsidiary loan will have an interest rate at 1% during the grace period 
and 2.55% thereafter. The subsidiary loan will be provided in Ngultrum and the government 
will bear the exchange rate risk. DHI would provide funds from the ADB loan and grant, and 
from DHI equity, to CDCL for the project. 
17. Advance fund procedure. Separate advance accounts will be established and maintained 
by  the  Royal  Monetary  Authority  (RMA)  for  each  funding  source.  The  currency  of  the 
advance accounts is the US dollar. The advance accounts are to be used exclusively for 
ADB’s share of eligible expenditures. The advance funds will then be transferred to three 
project  sub-accounts  maintained  by  CDCL  at  the  Bank  of  Bhutan,  the  country’s  most 
reputable commercial  bank  (one  account for  loan  proceeds,  one for grant  proceeds,  and 
one for counterpart fund contributions). The RMA will establish the advance accounts in the 
Department  of  Macroeconomic  Affairs’  (DMEA’s)s  name,  and  DMEA  will  be  accountable 
and responsible for proper use of advances to the advance accounts including advances to 
the  project’s  sub-accounts.  The  project  sub-accounts  will  be  for  the  exclusive  use  of  the 
project,  and  receive  and  funds  from  ADB  and  the  government  through  DMEA,  following 
Bhutan’s  country  system,  which  is  well-established  and  robust.  DMEA  will  advise  the 
Department  of  Public  Account  (DPA)  for  the  release  of  funds  to  the  respective  project 
accounts. The  PMU  will  be  responsible for  monthly  reconciliation of  the project  accounts 
6   Disbursement eLearning. http://wpqr4.adb.org/disbursement_elearning  
23 
and provision of supporting documents for withdrawal applications to ADB for liquidation or 
replenishment  of  each  project  account.  DMEA  is  responsible for  the  reconciliation  of  the 
advance accounts with project accounts before submitting withdrawal applications to ADB. 
18. The total outstanding advance to each advance account should not exceed the estimate of 
ADB’s share of expenditures to be paid through the advance account for the forthcoming 
6 months. CDCL may request initial and additional advances to the advance  account based 
on an estimate of expenditure sheet setting out the estimated expenditures to be financed 
through  the  account  for  the  forthcoming  6 months.7  Supporting  documents  should  be 
submitted to ADB or retained by the borrower in accordance with ADB’s Loan Disbursement 
Handbook  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  when  liquidating  or  replenishing  the 
advance  account.   
19. Project  sub-accounts.  Three  separate  project  sub-accounts  will  be  established  and 
maintained  by  CDCL  for  each  funding  source.  The  project  sub-accounts  are  to  be  used 
exclusively  for  ADB’s  share  of  eligible  expenditures.  CDCL  shall  ensure  that  every 
liquidation  and  replenishment  of  each  project  sub-account  is  supported  by  sufficient 
documentation in accordance with ADB’s Loan Disbursement Handbook. 
20. Applicable  disbursement  procedures.  The  use  of  advance  account  procedures  have 
been  adopted  for  previous ADB-funded  projects  in  the  country,  following  the  established 
government  budget  and  fund  management  system,  with  which  the  Executing Agency  is 
familiar. 
21. Statement  of  expenditure  procedure.8  The  SOE  procedure  may  be  used 
for 
reimbursement  of  eligible  expenditures  or  liquidation  of  advances  to  the  advance 
account(s).  The ceiling of the SOE procedure is the equivalent of $100,000 per individual 
payment. Supporting documents and records for the expenditures claimed under the SOE 
should be  maintained and  made readily  available for  review  by  ADB's  disbursement  and 
review  missions,  upon  ADB's  request  for  submission  of  supporting  documents  on  a 
sampling  basis,  and  for  independent  audit.  Reimbursement  and  liquidation  of  individual 
payments  in excess of the  SOE  ceiling  should be  supported  by full  documentation  when 
submitting the withdrawal application to ADB.   
22. Before the submission of the first withdrawal application, the borrower should submit to ADB 
sufficient evidence of the authority of the person(s) who will sign the withdrawal applications 
on behalf of the government, together with the authenticated specimen signatures of each 
authorized person. The minimum value per withdrawal application is $100,000 equivalent. 
Individual payments below this amount should be paid through the advance fund procedure, 
unless  otherwise  accepted  by  ADB.  The  borrower  should  ensure  sufficient  category  and 
contract balances before requesting disbursements. 
23. Withdrawal  applications and  supporting  documents  will  demonstrate,  among  other  things 
that the goods, and/or services were produced in or from ADB members, and are eligible 
for ADB financing.

8  SOE forms are available in Appendix 7B and 7D of ADB’s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from    
time to time). 
24 
24. Government counterpart funds will be provided to PMU and PIU under CDCL, from DHI and 
kept  in  project  accounts  of  PMU  and  PIU.  PMU  and  PIU  will  prepare  the  disbursement 
projections  and  transmit  to  the  government,  to  earmark  the  required  funds for  budgeting 
purposes.  
25. CDCL will submit to ADB, annual contract awards and disbursement projections before the 
start of each calendar year using the ADB’s standard templates. CDCL is responsible for 
(i) requesting  budgetary  allocations  for  counterpart  funds;  (ii)  collecting  supporting 
documents for the project; and (iii) preparing and sending withdrawal applications to ADB. 
C. 
Accounting 
26. CDCL  will  maintain,  or  cause  to  be  maintained,  separate  books  and  records  by  funding 
source  for  all  expenditures  incurred  on  the  project  following  accrual-based  accounting 
following  the  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards.  CDCL  will  prepare  project 
financial statements in accordance with the government's accounting laws and regulations 
which are consistent with international accounting principles and practices. 
D. 
Auditing and Public Disclosure 
27. CDCL will cause the detailed project financial statements to be audited in accordance with 
International  Standards  on  Auditing,  by  an  independent  auditor  acceptable  to  ADB.  The 
audited project financial statements together with the auditor’s opinion will be presented in 
the English language to ADB within 6 months from the end of each fiscal year by CDCL.  
28. The audited entity financial statements, together with the auditor’s report and management 
letter, will be submitted in the English language to ADB within 1 month after their approval 
by the relevant authority. 
29. The audit report for the project financial statements will include a management letter  and 
auditor’s  opinions,  which  cover  (i)  whether  the  project  financial  statements  present  an 
accurate and fair view or are presented fairly, in all material respects, in accordance with 
the applicable financial reporting standards; (ii) whether the proceeds of the loan and grant 
were used only for the purpose(s) of the project; and (iii) whether the borrower or executing 
agency was in compliance with the financial covenants contained in the legal agreements 
(where applicable). 
30. Compliance with financial reporting and auditing requirements will be monitored by review 
missions  and  during  normal  program  supervision,  and  followed  up  regularly  with  all 
concerned, including the external auditor.  
31. The government,  DHI  and  CDCL have  been  made  aware  of  ADB’s  approach  to delayed 
submission,  and  the  requirements  for  satisfactory  and  acceptable  quality  of  the  audited 
project financial statements.9 ADB reserves the right to require a change in the auditor (in a 
9   ADB’s approach and procedures regarding delayed submission of audited project financial statements:  
(i)  When audited project financial  statements  are  not  received  by  the  due  date,  ADB  will  write  to  the  executing 
agency advising that (a) the audit documents are overdue; and (b) if they are not received within the next  6 
months, requests for new contract awards and disbursement such as new replenishment of advance accounts, 
processing of new reimbursement, and issuance of new commitment letters will not be processed. 
(ii)  When audited project financial statements are not received within 6 months after the due date, ADB will withhold 
processing  of  requests  for  new  contract  awards  and  disbursement  such  as  new  replenishment  of  advance 
accounts, processing of new reimbursement, and issuance of new commitment letters. ADB will (a) inform the 
25 
manner  consistent  with  the  constitution  of  the  borrower),  or  for  additional  support  to  be 
provided to the auditor, if the audits required are not conducted in a manner satisfactory to 
ADB, or if the audits are substantially delayed. ADB reserves the right to verify the project's 
financial accounts to confirm that the share of ADB’s financing is used in accordance with 
ADB’s policies and procedures.  
32. Public disclosure of the audited project financial statements, including the auditor’s opinion 
on the project financial statements, will be guided by ADB’s Public Communications Policy 
2011.10 After the review, ADB will disclose the audited project financial statements and the 
opinion of the auditors on the project financial statements no later than 14 days after ADB’s 
confirmation  of  their  acceptability  by  posting  them  on  ADB’s  website.  The  management 
letter,  additional  auditor’s  opinions,  and  audited  entity  financial  statements  will  not  be 
disclosed.11 
VI. 
PROCUREMENT AND CONSULTING SERVICES 
A. 
Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing 
33. All advance contracting and retroactive financing will be undertaken in conformity with ADB 
Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time) and ADB’s Guidelines on 
the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). The issuance of invitations 
to bid under advance contracting and retroactive financing will be subject to ADB approval. 
The borrower, DHI and CDCL have been advised that approval of advance contracting and 
retroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance the project. 
34. Advance  contracting.  The  works  and  services  packages  to  be  financed  by  the  project 
through advance contracting are (i) Civil works CW-01 (River training, cross drainage and 
land reclamation); and (ii) Consulting services CS-01 (Project Implementation Consultant). 
Eligible PMU and PIU setting up expenses (office equipment, vehicles, and personnel) may 
also be part of advance contracting and retroactive financing. Table 8 indicates the schedule 
for advance contracting, for CS-01 and CW-01, including status for each activity. 
35. Retroactive  financing.  Retroactive  financing  is  allowed  for  reimbursement  of  eligible 
expenses against civil works and consulting services up to a maximum amount equivalent 
to 20% of the total ADB loan and grant, incurred before loan effectiveness, but not more 
than 12 months before the signing of the loan agreement. 
executing agency of ADB’s actions; and (b) advise that the loan may be suspended if the audit documents are 
not received within the next 6 months. 
(iii) When  audited  project  financial  statements  are  not  received  within  12  months  after  the  due  date,  ADB  may

Procurement of Goods, Works, and Consulting Services 
36. All  procurement  of  goods  and  works  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB’s 
Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time).  
37. International  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  procedures  will  be  used  for  civil  works  contracts 
estimated to cost $3,000,000 or more, and goods contracts valued at $1,000,000 or higher. 
Shopping will be used for procurement of works and goods worth less than $100,000. 
38. When and if any national competitive bidding (NCB) is proposed, ADB and the government 
will review the public procurement laws of the government to ensure consistency with ADB’s 
Procurement  Guidelines  (2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time),  before  the  start  of  any 
procurement. Threshold for NCB shall be below that of ICB. Works by government-owned 
entities (for activities which are not suitable for competitive bidding) shall be done through 
force account method. Small service contracts (works considered non-competitive in nature 
i.e., excavation of small channels, earth shifting, turfing, tree planting and other misc. works 
in  the  project  area)  may  be  directly  contracted  as  per  ADB  guidelines  for  community 
participation in procurement for works, with a limit of $20,000 per package.    
C. 
Procurement Plan 
39. An 18-month procurement plan indicating threshold and review procedures, goods, works, 
and consulting service contract packages and national competitive bidding guidelines is in 
Appendix  F.  The  procurement  plan,  as  approved  by  ADB,  describes  all  procurement  of 
27 
goods  and  works  to  be  undertaken  by  the  project.  ADB  will  review  documents  and 
submissions  related  to  procurement  at  all  major  milestones  prior  to  proceeding  with  the 
procurement process. PMU will be supported by procurement specialist from the PPTA and 
PIC  in  bid  document  preparation  and  evaluation.  This  will  be  supplemented  by  regular 
training on procurement for PMU staff.  
D. 
Consultant's Terms of Reference 
40. All consultants will be recruited according to ADB’s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants 
(2013, as amended from time to time). An estimated 371 person-months (207 international, 
164  national)12  of  consulting  services  are  required  to  facilitate  project  management  and 
implementation. Three  consulting firms  will  be  engaged  using the quality-and cost-based 
selection (QCBS) method with a standard quality–cost ratio of 90:10. Individual consultants 
will be engaged using the individual consultant selection method. The terms of reference for 
the Project Implementation Consultant is in Appendix G-1. The outline terms of reference 
for:  (i) independent  environmental  monitoring  expert;  (ii)  urban  management  advisor;  (iii) 
township  management  capacity 
(iv)  sustainable 
investment  promotion  advisor; 
development; and (v) investor promotion and transaction advisory services are provided in 
Appendix G-2 to G-6 respectively. 
VII. 
SAFEGUARDS 
41. The  safeguard  category  for  environment  is  ‘A’,  for  involuntary  resettlement  ‘C’,  and  for 
indigenous peoples ‘C’.  Resettlement and indigenous peoples’ plans are not required.  
A. 
Environment 
institutional  arrangement 
42. The  environmental  management  plan  (EMP)  contained  in  the  EIA  report  is  the  strategic 
document  to  provide  direction  to  the  implementation  of  the  environmental  safeguards 
requirements of the Project. The EMP has been developed following basic environmental 
management  principals  and  it  outlines  the  main  environmental  impacts  of  the  project, 
proposed mitigations measures, and the proposed design mitigations to ensure inclusion in 
the  bidding  documents,  standard  construction  mitigation  measures,  monitoring  and  a 
proposed 
implementation  of  environmental 
management  during  the  construction  phase.    It  also  details  the  implementation 
arrangements  and  the  roles  and  responsibilities  of  each  of  the  main  stakeholders.  It 
discusses the grievance redress mechanism for community feedback and complaints and a 
summary  of  the  proposed  mitigation  and  monitoring  matrix  showing  how  the  contractor 
should  mitigate  the  identified  impact  and  reduce  risk.    The  mitigation  and  management

safeguards work under the project, including the following activities: (i) facilitate and confirm 
overall  compliance  with  Government  of  Bhutan  rules,  oversee  timely  preparation  and 
finalization  of  CEMP  by  contractors,  and  assist  in  obtaining  all  required  clearances  and 
environmental  permits  in  a  timely  manner  prior  to  construction;  (ii)  monitor  CEMP 
implementation by the contractors during construction including all mitigation measures and 
environmental parameters (air and water quality, noise, etc.) and taking corrective actions 
where  necessary;  (iii)  address  and  record  grievances  through  the  Grievance  Redress 
Mechanism in a timely manner, and taking quick corrective actions where necessary; (iv) 
ensure that all required environmental study (e.g. biodiversity studies on aquatic ecosystem 
and  elephant  social  behavior)  are  professionally  and  comprehensively  carried  out;  (v) 
ensure that all environmental quality monitoring required for the project are comprehensively 
done;  and  (vi)  review  monthly  environmental  monitoring  reports  submitted  to  PIU  by 
contractors  and  consultants,  and  preparing  and  submitting  semi-annual  environmental 
monitoring  reports  to  ADB  on  behalf  of  the  PMU.  All  semi-annual  monitoring  reports 
submitted  to  ADB  will  be  disclosed  on  ADB’s  website,  as  per  ADB  safeguards  and 
communication policies. 
29 
47. Project  Implementation  Consultant  (PIC)  The  PIC  will  support  PIU  in  design  review, 
construction  supervision  and  monitoring  and  evaluation.   The  role of  the PIC  safeguards 
team  is  to  oversee  overall  implementation  of  the  EMP  and  CEMP,  and  prepare  and 
implement ongoing ambient monitoring at the monitoring sites used for the completion of 
the EIA.  It will also advise the overall project engineer on  addressing environmental and 
social management issues.   
48. Contractors.  Contractors  play  a  critical  role  in  implementing  environmental  safeguards 
including the following activities: (i) prepare and obtain approval of the CEMP, based on the 
EIA/EMP and outline CEMP prepared during detailed designs and comply with ADB’s SPS 
2009 and the EMP. This will be done during the mobilization phase after contract award. 
The PIC environmental safeguards specialist will approve the CEMP on behalf of PIU before 
any construction work commences; (ii) carry out all environmental mitigation measures in 
the  approved  CEMPs  during  construction  including  regular  testing  and  monitoring  of 
environmental parameters outlined; (iii) address public grievances by taking quick corrective 
actions and reporting status of grievances and redress to PIU/PMU; (iv) undertake its own 
monitoring of project related impacts and prepare an environmental section of the monthly 
report  to  CDCL  environment  team  and  PIC;  (v)  the  contractor  is  responsible  for 
implementing  all  environmental,  health  and  safety  actions  included  in  the  CEMP  and 
relevant clauses in the bidding documents; and (vi) the contractor is required to assign an 
Environmental Safety Officer whose responsibilities will include: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Coordinating with the PIC during preparation and approval of the CEMP. 
Ensuring  that  the  contractor  engages  a  suitable  expert  as  a  resource  person  or 
organization  to  undertake  STIs/  HIV/  AIDS  briefings  and  awareness  raising 
amongst the contractor’s employees and neighboring communities with follow-up 
upon request. 
Coordinating with PIU and PIC in respect of community consultation. 
Participating in monitoring and coordinating with PIC to ensure that environmental 
management activities are reported as required.

permitting agencies such as the Department of Mining responsible for quarries. 
Assigning  a  Community  Liaison  Officer  (CLO)  who  would  coordinate  and 
communicate with the PIC as required, to facilitate consultation with the affected 
villages,  various  stakeholders,  and  ensuring  smooth  implementation  of  the 
subproject. 
49. Provision  will  be  made  in  the  bidding  documents  of  each  package  for  the  costs  of 
environmental management and monitoring including preparation of the CEMP. 
50. Phuentsholing  Thromde  and  Village  Communities:  The  Thromde and  Village  leaders 
and organizations will assist in arranging meetings, facilitating consultation and providing 
information  about  affected  communities  and  environmental  impacts  of  construction. 
Documentation  of  issues  that  arise  is  an  integral  part  of  the  internal  monitoring  report 
prepared by the Contractor.  The Consultation process will be set out and agreed with PIU 
for the preparation of the project CCP which will be prepared and implemented by the PIC 
social team. If issues arise during construction, the local communities can provide input and 
advice to the Contractor’s CLO or use the GRM directly for issues and grievances which 
have not been satisfactorily resolved.  
51. ADB Role: ADB's safeguard due diligence emphasizes planning, environmental and social 
30 
impact  assessments  and  safeguard  documentation.  Through  such  due  diligence  and 
review, ADB will confirm (i) that all key potential social and environmental impacts and risks 
of  a  project  are  identified;  (ii)  that  effective  measures  to  avoid,  minimize,  mitigate,  or 
compensate for the adverse impacts are incorporated into the safeguard plans and project 
design;  (iii)  that  the  borrower/client  understands  ADB’s  safeguard  policy  principles  and 
requirements  and  has  the  necessary  commitment  and  capacity  to  manage  the  risks 
adequately;  (iv)  that,  as  required,  the  role  of  third  parties  is  appropriately  defined  in  the 
safeguard  plans;  and  (v)  that  consultations  with  affected  people  are  conducted  in 
accordance with ADB's requirements.  
C. 
Grievance Redress Mechanism 
52. The project is required to have a mechanism to give avenue for peoples who affected by 
the project to submit their grievances and a mechanism for the project to resolve a grievance 
received from affected people. 
53. Two tier mechanisms will be adopted by the project. The first tier, will be in the field PIU 
level. Secretariat of GRM will be established in the PIU office, with PIC health and safety 
consultant  acting  as  the  secretary.  At  the  first  level  GRM,  the  team  called  as  Grievance 
Redress Committee will be established at the PIU level and consist of the PIU head as the 
lead of GRC, with the following permanent member: (i) the Environment Officer of PIU, and 
(ii)  the  PIC  consultants  (social  development,  environment,  and  health  and  safety),  (iii) 
representative of local leader, (iv) representative from District office, (v) representative from 
reputable  community  based  organization,  and  (vi)  members  on  call  basis  based  on  the 
nature of grievance representing relevant section of district office, contractor, and other PIU 
staff e.g. engineer.  There are four options of complaint/grievances received: (i) PIU office, 
(ii) Contractor office, (iii) local leader office, and (iv) Thromde office, and 1 GRM first level 
secretariat that will in the PIU office. The secretariat will actively check with other grievance 
receivers and record submitted grievance, date, concerns/ grievance type. The secretariat 
will call a regular meeting to invite all member, and conduct special meetings if receive any 
grievance.  The  secretariat  will  responsible  to  review  the  grievance,  identify  potential 
solutions, and call the meetings with relevant party. Meeting to resolve a grievance should 
involve the person who submit the grievance. The time to resolve the grievance at the first 
level will be maximum 14 days. If the first GRM level could not resolve the grievance it will 
go to second level/tier GRM. 
54. The second level/tier GRM will be led by the PMU head with member from PIU and relevant 
PMU staff, and relevant Department at the central government level, as well as reputable 
community-based organization. All grievance should be resolved at this level. The total time 
required will not be more than 30 days after PIU receiving the grievance. Depending on the 
severity  of  the  case,  an  additional  time  my  agreed  by  the  complainant  to  resolve  the 
grievances. The meeting to resolve a grievance will be held by  involving also the people 
who submit the grievance. 
55. The  PMU  will  develop  detail  a  standard  operation  procedure  for  GRM.  The  GRM  is  not 
replacing the court system, so complainants can still bring the complaint/grievance to the 
court while the Project grievance handling the complaint. 
D. 
Health and safety 
56. The project will be required to provide workers with a safe and healthy working environment, 
31 
taking  into  account  inherent  risks,  any  hazards  in  the  work  areas,  including  physical, 
chemical, biological, and radiological hazards. The SPS also requires that the government, 
through the implementing agency, will take steps to prevent accidents, injury, and disease 
arising from, associated with, or occurring during the course of work. ADB will review that 
the  PMU  and  PIU  ensures  that  the  project  adheres  to  government  health  and  safety 
requirements  and  employs  international  good  practices,  as  reflected  in  internationally 
recognized standards such as the World Bank Group’s Environmental Health and Safety 
Guidelines.
E. 
Prohibited investment activities  
57. Pursuant to ADB’s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), ADB funds may not be applied to 
the activities described in the ADB Prohibited Investment Activities List set forth in Appendix 
5 of the Safeguard Policy Statement (2009).  
VIII.  GENDER AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS 
58. A  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy  (SPRSS)  has  been  prepared.  The 
PMU/PIU  should  ensure  that  all  stakeholders’  consultation  meetings  invite  women  and 
women organizations as well as activists/organization concerns with the project especially 
of developing urban facilities and developing the flood early warning system. The PMU/PIU 
should also ensure that measures have been taken to raise public awareness of the risks of 
HIV/AIDS  and  other  sexually  transmitted  infections,  drug  and  human  trafficking.  The 
PMU/PIU  will  identify  important  parties  including  women  organizations  and  women  as 
individuals  to  be  key  agents  involved  with  preparing  and  implementing  the  flood  early 
warning  system,  and  ensure  these  parties  and  women  are  invited  to  all  trainings  and 
community  discussions.  The  civil  works  contractors  are  to  take  measures  to  protect 
construction workers from the risks of HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections, 
and for the testing and treatment of construction workers. Contract bidding documents to 
provide clauses designed to ensure that all civil works contractors comply with applicable 
labor laws, do not employ child labor, encourage the employment of the poor, particularly 
women, and do not offer different wages to men and women and has to provide equal pay 
for equal work. Dialogue and communication (both written and verbal) with stakeholders will 
be  carried  out  in  a  specific  and  culturally  sensitive  manner  and  in  local  languages,  and 
continue to conduct public consultations throughout project implementation to ensure that 
stakeholders  including  affected  people  aware  on  the  progress  project  achievement  and 
requirements. The quarterly progress report will also include a record of women participation 
in  all  consultation  meetings,  with  disaggregation  for  meetings  related  to  preparing  and 
implementing the FEWS and FMP.

COMMUNICATION 
A. 
Project Design and Monitoring Framework 
59. The design and monitoring framework (DMF) of the project is in Appendix A. 
B. 
Monitoring  
60. Both government and ADB have their own separate monitoring responsibilities. The extent 
of monitoring activities, including their scope and periodicity, will be commensurate with the 
32 
project’s risks and impacts. Governments, through the implementing agency, are required 
to implement safeguard measures and relevant safeguard plans, as provided in the legal 
agreements,  and 
implementation 
performance.  Monitoring  and  supervising  of  social  and  environmental  safeguards  is 
integrated into the project performance management system (PPMS). 
to  submit  periodic  monitoring  reports  on 
their 
61. Project  performance  monitoring. Within 12 months  of  loan  effectiveness, the  PMU  will 
establish  a  PPMS  using  the  targets,  indicators,  assumptions,  and  risks  in  the  DMF.  The 
PPMS  will  take  into  account  the  important  monitoring  parameters  in  addition  to  those 
included in the DMF. The baseline data corresponding to indicators and targets set out in 
the  DMF  and  PPMS  will  be  determined  from  the  detailed  design  reports.  Disaggregated 
baseline  data  for  output  and  outcome  indicators  gathered  will  be  updated  and  reported 
quarterly through the quarterly progress reports and after each ADB review mission. These 
quarterly reports will provide  information necessary to update ADB's project performance 
reporting  system.  Results  of  a  comprehensive  completion  survey  will  be  included  in  the 
project completion report. 
62. Compliance monitoring. PMU will monitor and ensure the compliance of loan covenants—
policy, legal, financial, economic, environmental, and others. All non-compliance issues, if 
any, will be updated in quarterly progress reports together with remedial actions. Each ADB 
review mission (at least two times a year) will also monitor the status of compliance with 
loan  assurances  and  raise  the  non-compliance  issues  with  DHI  and  agree  on  remedial 
actions. 
63. Safeguards  monitoring.  The  supervision,  quality  control  and  enforcement  of  contract 
provisions is the responsibility of the PMU/PIU Environment Team and the PIC (Engineer to 
the Contract). The responsibility for preparation and implementation of the CEMP is with the 
Contractor.  
64. The  PIC  is  responsible  for  the  preparation  and  implementation  of  ongoing  ambient 
environmental  quality  monitoring  using  the  same  or  a  sample  of  the  location  of  the 
monitoring sites used for the collection of baseline data in the EIA. 
65. On behalf of the NEC, it will also provide quality assurance and random auditing, in order to 
ensure that the agreed procedures are in place and being operated in a satisfactory manner 
and  in  accordance  with  the  national  environmental  regulations  and  specific  contract 
provisions.  If possible, personnel from the NEC will arrange to carry out these audits jointly 
at an agreed schedule.  
66. The  outcomes  of  the  monitoring  will  be  included  in  the  overall  safeguards  monitoring 
progress reports to be submitted to NEC. These will also be consolidated and submitted to 
ADB for disclosure on a semi-annual basis. 
67. For internal project related impact monitoring, a daily and/or weekly monitoring checklist will 
be required by the Contractor and a monthly report by the Contractor will incorporate these 
checklists.  Any  issues  relating  to  routine  compliance  and  reporting  of  any  incidents  / 
complaints that have occurred and the progress of their resolution. 
68. The CEMP for each package will detail the contents of the monthly environmental report 
which at a minimum will include: 
Routine non-compliances 
• 
33 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Checklists for monitoring of all sub plans of the CEMP. 
Reporting  status  for  implementation  of  each  CEMP  component/activity  and  each 
level of non-compliance and proposed contract enforcement 
Incident and complaint classification with required reporting timeframes and status 
of resolution 
Reporting of the results of regular community update / progress meetings including 
use of local labor (gender disaggregated) 
69. ADB will also monitor the project externally with an independent panel on an ongoing basis 
until a project completion report is issued. 
70. The monitoring reports will be prepared by the PIC safeguards specialists, with inputs from 
the contractors, where relevant. The status of safeguard implementation, issues, grievances 
received and resolved, and corrective actions are to be clearly reported to ADB. The PMU 
will  submit  separate  semi-annual  environmental  monitoring reports to  ADB,  which will  be 
disclosed on ADB’s website. The status of safeguards implementation will also be discussed 
at each ADB review mission and with necessary issues and agreed actions recorded in Aide 
Memoires. 
71. Gender  and  social  dimensions  monitoring.  Ensure  that  women  through  their  local 
community organizations are invited to the public consultations to provide inputs to take into 
account the needs of women especially in designing and planning of public facilities such 
as street lighting, public toilet, and recreation areas. Women from project areas should also 
participate in all training and outreach activities on HIV/STD, and also on hygienic training 
as part of development water supply and sanitation facilities. The PIU will conduct public 
awareness program on the opportunities for communities to work in the project, and will also 
urge the recruitment of women to work in the project if the required skills are met, and equal 
pay will be enforced. The bidding documents provide clauses designed to ensure that all 
civil works contractors comply with applicable labor laws; do not employ child labor or forced 
labor; encourage the employment of the poor, particularly women, with equal pay for equal 
work. 
C. 
Evaluation 
72. The DHI and ADB will jointly review the project at least twice a year. This includes (i) the 
performance  of  the  PMU,  PIU,  consultants  and  contractors;  (ii)  physical  progress  of  the 
project,  effectiveness  of  safeguards;  (iii)  compliance  with  loan  assurances;  and  (iv) 
assessment  of  operational  sustainability  in  technical  and  financial  terms,  including  land 
leasing and utility tariff determination. In addition to the regular loan reviews, the DHI and 
ADB  will  undertake  a  comprehensive  midterm  review  in  the  third  year  of  project 
implementation to identify problems and constraints encountered and suggest measures to 
address  them.  Specific  items  to  be  reviewed  will  include:  (i)  appropriateness  of  scope, 
design,  implementation  arrangements,  and  schedule  of  activities;  (ii)  assessment  of 
implementation progress against project indicators; (iii) capacity development of CDCL for 
ensuring  sustainability;  (iv)  compliance  with  safeguard measures;  (v)  extent  to  which  the 
activities to provide some gender benefits have been undertaken; (vi) lessons learned, good 
practices,  and  corrective  actions;  and  (vii)  changes  recommended.  Within  6  months  of 
physical completion of the Project PMU will submit a project completion report to ADB.13

D. 
Reporting  
73. CDCL, the implementing agency, will provide ADB with (i) quarterly progress reports in a 
format consistent with ADB's project performance reporting system; (ii) consolidated annual 
reports  including  (a)  progress  achieved  by  output  as  measured  through  the  indicator's 
performance targets, (b) key implementation issues and solutions, (c) updated procurement 
plan,  and  (d)  updated  implementation  plan  for  the  next  12  months;  (iii)  Environmental 
monitoring,  which  cover  report  on  progress  in  implementing  environmental  management 
plan,    monitoring  environmental  quality,  and  reporting  any  activities  related  with  effort  to 
address environmental concerns of the project, in semi-annual basis, starting after 6 months 
of  loan  effectiveness,    and  (iv)  a  project  completion  report  within  6  months  of  physical 
completion  of  the  project.  To  ensure  that  projects  will  continue  to  be  both  viable  and 
sustainable, project accounts and the executing agency audited financial statement together 
with the associated auditor's report should be adequately reviewed. 
E. 
Stakeholder Communication Strategy  
74. The PIU, supported by the PIC, will manage communications during implementation of the 
Project Phase 1 and preparation of Phase 2.  Main activities, amongst other will be to: 
i) 
Develop, implement and manage an effective public relations plan for promoting the 
benefits  of  the  Project  and  disseminating  information  to  associated  project 
stakeholders,  general  public  and  non-government  organizations  (NGOs)  on  how 
well  social  and  environmental  aspects  are  taken  care  of  and  what  benefits  are 
attributed to the poor community; 
Proactively organizing public relations events as required; 
ii) 
iii)  Developing  and  maintaining  a  Project  website  to  disseminate  information  and 
implementation progress, and also provide a feedback and communication system 
for stakeholders and general public; and 
iv)  Preparing a photographic and video diary of the construction works throughout the 
entire duration of the Project to show construction activities, progress, and interviews 
with DHI, PIU, PIC, contractors, government and Thromde staff, and stakeholders. 
It will be prepared to a high professional standard.

ANTICORRUPTION POLICY 
76. ADB  reserves the  right to investigate,  directly  or  through its  agents,  any  violations of  the 
Anticorruption  Policy  relating to the  project.14  All  contracts financed  by  ADB  shall  include 
provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of the 
executing  agency  and  all  project  contractors,  suppliers,  consultants,  and  other  service 
providers. Individuals and/or entities on ADB’s anticorruption debarment list are ineligible to 
participate  in  ADB-financed  activity  and  may  not  be  awarded  any  contracts  under  the 
project.15  
77. To support these efforts, relevant provisions are included in the loan and grant agreements 
and the bidding documents for the project.  
XI. 
ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISM 
78. People  who  are,  or  may  in  the  future  be,  adversely  affected  by  the  project  may  submit 
complaints to ADB’s Accountability Mechanism. The Accountability Mechanism provides an 
independent  forum  and  process  whereby  people  adversely  affected  by  ADB-assisted 
projects  can  voice,  and  seek  a  resolution  of  their  problems,  as  well  as  report  alleged 
violations of ADB’s operational policies and procedures. Before submitting a complaint to 
the Accountability Mechanism, affected people should make an effort in good faith to solve 
their problems by working with the concerned ADB operations department.  Only after doing 
that, and if they are still dissatisfied, should they approach the Accountability Mechanism.16 
79. The project will establish a Grievance Redress Mechanism to ensure greater accountability. 
Within  12  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  PMU  will  prepare  a  Grievance  Redress 
Mechanism, acceptable to ADB, and establish a special committee to receive and resolve 
complaints/grievances or act upon reports from stakeholders on misuse of funds and other

irregularities, including grievances due to resettlement. The special committee will (i) make 
public  of  the  existence  of  this  Grievance  Redress  Mechanism;  (ii)  review  and  address 
grievances of stakeholders of the project, in relation to either the project, any of the service 
providers,  or  any  person  responsible  for  carrying  out  any  aspect  of  the  project;  and 
(iii) proactively and constructively responding to them.

Appendix E 
PAM Appendix E: Strategic Action Plan for Sustainable Township Management 
Overview. One of the fundamental aspects of the project is to ensure high-quality municipal services in the new township to 
1. 
secure return on investment. It is envisaged that the developer, CDCL, will be responsible for operations and maintenance (O&M) of 
the township’s infrastructure through a Special Development Authority (‘the Authority’), and be the main service provider.17 However, 
CDCL shall have agreements with the Phuentsholing Thromde to specify roles and responsibilities, sharing of any facilities or services, 
and revenue sharing arrangements. 
2. 
The Authority shall function as an autonomous body appointed by the government. Among other things, it will be responsible 
for ensuring compliance with the planning regulations and procedural regulations. After preliminary review, the Authority would forward 
developer’s  applications to the  Phuentsholing Thromde  to  ensure  adherence to Common  Building  Regulations related  to  structural 
safety,  seismic  safety, fire  safety,  and  consistency  with Bhutanese  architecture guidelines,  etc. The Authority  would operate under 
special  development  control  regulations,  which  are  likely  to  differ  from  existing  regulations  largely  in  terms  of  setbacks  and  height 
controls, for example.18 
3. 
Implementation and monitoring. The proposed arrangement of a Development Authority and special planning area is new to 
Bhutan. There is still several policy, legal, financial, institutional and human resources issues to be resolved to clarify the institutional 
framework  for  the  township’s  management.  The  roadmap  below  was  agreed  in  principle  with  the  government  and  will  need  to  be 
updated from time to time. Its implementation and reporting on progress will be included as a loan covenant. ADB review missions 
shall monitor the implementation of the roadmap closely. The Roadmap includes timelines, responsibilities and sources of funding, 
where required, to support the achievement of each action.

3  Roles  and  responsibilities.  Define  and  agree  on  all  relevant 
agencies’  roles  and  responsibilities  for  all  aspects  of  township 
management  and  services  delivery;  and  identify  opportunities  for 
outsourcing and sharing facilities/services.

spaces,  emergency  services,  tax  collection,  enforcement  of  bylaws, 
city services (e.g. issuing identification cards), and others 
4 
Financial  flows.  Clarify  all  revenue  collection,  revenue-sharing 
arrangements/amounts  and  financial  flows  between  CDCL  and 
Phuentsholing  (i.e.  from fees,  land  tax,  property  tax,  building  permit 
fee,  etc.).  Determine  mechanism  and  process  for  periodic  review  of

BACKGROUND 
1.1 
Project Purpose 
These  terms  of  reference  (TOR)  outline  the  scope  of  works,  deliverables  and  work 
1. 
program  for  the  Program  Implementation  Consultant  (PIC).  The  PIC  will  be  responsible  for 
assisting Construction Development Corporation Limited (CDCL), a subsidiary company of Druk 
Holdings  and  Investment  Ltd. (DHI)  which is  a  Royal  Government  of  Bhutan  owned company, 
with implementing the Phuensholing Township Development Project (PTDP) (the “Project”). 
2. 
Bhutan’s annual urban population growth rate from 2000 to 2010 was 5.7%, the highest 
in  South  Asia.  This  rapid  growth  has  created  severe  pressure  on  existing  facilities  leading  to 
problems  of  water  shortages  and  under  capacity  sanitation  and  waste  disposal  facilities.  The 
Government  is  addressing  these  problems  with  urban  development  programs,  particularly  in 
Thimphu  and  Phuentsholing.  However  rural-urban  migration  continues  causing  encroachment 
onto either valuable irrigated agricultural land or unstable steep terrain. In Phuentsholing, recent 
expansion has encroached onto the unsafe riverbanks of the Amochhu River which threatens the 
city  from  floods  and  erosion.  The  government  desires  that  future  urban  growth  happens  in  a 
planned manner, and it be concentrated in proximity to established economic centres to have the 
highest potential for providing employment and economic growth opportunities. 
3. 
Phuentsholing  is  the  country’s  largest  commercial  and  industrial  hub  and  main  trading 
gateway with India. The city is also located on two trading corridors that have been developed 
under the framework of the South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation. The Government has 
a vision  to  develop  Phuentsholing  to  be  an  economically  vibrant,  ecologically  sustainable,  and 
energy  efficient  centre  that  will  support  economic  diversification,  employment  creation,  and 
income  generation.  There  is  strong  demand  for  an  expansion  of  Phuentsholing  with  the  new 
township because of the continuous high rate of rural-urban migration. Due to the limited space 
for housing, about 5,600 Bhutanese live nearby in Indian territory and commute daily across the 
border to work in Phuentsholing.   
4. 
The proposed PTDP is the first phase of the government’s larger development plan called 
“Amochhu Land Development and Township Project” (ALDTP) that will develop 464 hectares (ha) 
of riparian land near Phuentsholing Thromde (Municipality) located along both sides the Amochhu 
River on Bhutan’s south-western border with India. ALDTP will provide protection from floods and 
erosion,  and  construct  smart  urban  infrastructure  to allow  phased urban expansion.  A  modern 
township will be developed on sustainable principles of equity, liveability, and competitiveness, 
and it will be integrated into the fabric of the existing municipality and preserve Bhutan’s unique 
architectural  heritage.  The  project  will  also  protect  the  existing  and  new  town  from  floods  and 
riverbank erosion  which currently  threatens  lives and livelihoods  and disrupts  connectivity  with 
nearby communities.  
5. 
The  new  township development  also  provides  space for  public  services such  as  health 
facilities  and  schools,  and  commercial  businesses.  This  will  contribute  to  expansion  of  the 
country’s services sector and diversify the economy from heavy reliance on hydropower.

ALDTP is divided into five zones; A to E. of which PTDP will development Zone A onlyZone 
D represents Kaileshwar Hill and is not included in the project for development. The remaining 4 
zones  comprise  of  land  development  on  Amochhu  riparian  land  will  require  about  15km  of 
riverbank protection with new common urban infrastructure (roads, 2 bridges each of 340m span, 
water  supply,  waste  water  management,  municipal  solid  waste  management,  power  and 
telecommunications) to support habitation for up to 50,000 people.  The allocation of land and 
riverbank protection for the project’s four development zones is:

Implementation of the project will be phased in relation to the scale and demand for the 
development. Phase 1 will develop Zone A while subsequent phases will develop the remaining 
zones.  Phase  1  will  also  support  sustainable  township  management  capacity  development, 
investor promotion and transaction advisory services. Phase 1 is financed with the support of the 
Asian Development Bank (ADB), subject to ADB’s Board approval. 
1.3 
PTDP (Phase 1) Investment

A. 
Background 
A draft EIA has been prepared by the project preparation consultants which identifies the Zone C 
area as being within 1km of the Jaldapara National Park across the adjacent border with India. It 
is described as having an extensive range of flora and fauna such as Elephant, Indian Leopard, 
Rhino and many others. The land use inventory also shows extensive areas of similar and suitable 
habitat for such animals (more than 850 Ha of riverine grassland) within the proposed Zone C.  
There has  been  one  rapid  assessment  of one  week  conducted for  the  preparation  of the  draft 
EIA. There has also been very limited monitoring of water quality within the Zone C area. The 
area of zone C and Zone D exhibits characteristics of what the ADB describes as “natural habitat” 
- Land and water areas where the biological communities are formed largely by native plant and 
animal  species,  and  where  human  activity  has  not  essentially  modified  the  area’s  primary 
ecological functions.  
Given there is adequate time before Zone C is developed and the lack of information supplied in 
the  draft  EIA  for  this  area,  a  baseline  biodiversity  will  be  conducted  by  a  specialist  Local 
Biodiversity consultant reporting to the PIC. 
B. 
Issues 
The issues subject to further investigation include: 
•  Current elephant movement  pattern,  social  behavior,  including feeding, breeding,  roaming 
and its attachment factor to the project affected areas. 
•  Current  distribution  of  other  important  species  in  the  project  and  affected  areas.  These 
important species may include Indian Leopard, the Indian Rhino and Barking Deer, reptiles, 
amphibians, and avifauna especially species under critically endangered (CR) and vulnerable 
(V) category of IUCN such Bengal Florian  
•  Current distribution of important aquatic species and its breeding and spawning habitat. 
•  Habitat assessment especially Zone C which would support such species. 
• 
 human activities that may affect the ecological behavior, nice and habitat of these species. 
C. 
Activities 
• 
Identify  and  agree  with  PIU  the  baseline  biodiversity  study  boundary  which  recognizes 
relevant ecological relationships. 
Identify and agree with PIU on a three-year study design over two seasons per year. 
• 
•  With  PIU  oversight  conduct  the  necessary  Government  liaison  for  the  various  protocols 
required to carry out the study.

3-2.  Flood Management Consultancy 
Position titles: Flood Warning Specialist, Flood Management Specialist, 
Hydrologist/Hydraulic Engineer 
A. 
Background 
ADB  plans  to  support  the  Phuentsholing  Township  Development  Project  (PTDP)  in  Bhutan, 
aiming to  develop  66 hectares  of riparian  land  adjacent  to the  Amochhu  River  near  the  city  of 
Phuentsholing on Bhutan’s southwestern border with India. The project will provide protection to 
the  new  township  from  floods  and  erosion,  and  construct  smart  urban  infrastructure  to  allow 
phased urban expansion. The project will also protect the existing town of Phuentsholing from 
floods and riverbank erosion associated with the Amochhu26, which currently threatens lives and 
livelihoods and disrupts connectivity with nearby communities. 
The PTDP flood and bank protection works27 are designed to protect the new development from 
an Amochhu flood with an annual exceedance probability of 1% in any one year (referred to as 
the 1 in 100-year flood). Nonetheless, flooding of the new and existing towns by the Amochhu will 
still  be  possible,  with resulting risk to life and  property,  due  to floods that  are greater  than  the 
design event and/or due to inadequate in-river maintenance. In recognition of the residual risks, 
a Flood Early Warning System (FEWS) and a community-based Flood Management Plan (FMP) 
are included as part of the PTDP.  
A  Flood Warning Specialist,  Flood  Management Specialist  and Hydrologist/Hydraulic  Engineer 
are required to provide advisory services to CDCL on establishing the FEWS and FMP.  
B. 
Outline of the Concept 
The FEWS and FMP will broadly comprise the following components: 
•  Rainfall and water level sensors at selected locations. 
•  Data loggers for the rainfall and water level data. 
•  Satellite based transmission of the rainfall and water level data. 
•  Reception of the satellite transmissions at the DHMS control centre in Thimphu. 
•  A computer based system to monitor the status of the rainfall and water levels, with a 
range of alert levels. 
•  A flood forecasting model to be utilized when a trigger alert level is raised. 
•  Reception of the data, alert levels and flood forecasting results at Thromde operations 
centre in Phuentsholing. 
•  A  procedure for  warning  dissemination  via various media to reach  the  end  user  and 
26  Phuentsholing  is  exposed  to  flood  risk  from  a  number  of  sources.  There  is  existing  fluvial  flood  risk  due  to  the 
Amochhu itself, the Amochhu left bank tributaries (referred to as ‘cross drainage’) which drain across the Amochhu 
LAP, as well as the Omchhu which passes through the town, and pluvial flooding (local rainfall-runoff that exceeds 
the capacity of the local stormwater system). The annual exceedance probabilities and consequences of each flood 
source are different. The PTDP flood protection works will mitigate Amochhu-related flood risks in the existing town, 
provided certain conditions are met. No works are included in the  PTDP to mitigate the risks associated with the 
Omchhu or pluvial flooding.  
27  The cross-drainage works will be designed to have the same standard of flood protection, including a freeboard of 
1m. 
Appendix G  
95 
meet different needs of men and women. 
•  Procedures for action by the emergency services and the public. 
Development  of  the  FEWS  and  FMP  will  require  close  coordination  with  the  Department  of 
Disaster  Management  (DDM),  Department  of  Hydromet  Services  (DHMS)  and  Phuentsholing 
Thromde, amongst others. DDM has an overview role as set out in the Disaster Management Act 
of  Bhutan  2013.  DHMS  currently  provides  flood  early  warning  services  for  other  locations  in 
Bhutan  and  will  need  to  be  closely  involved  throughout  specification,  installation  and 
commissioning of the FEWS. Phuentsholing Thromde will be integral to the FMP execution and 
will host the operations centre in Phuentsholing. 
FEWS  equipment  (supply  and  install)  will  be  procured  by  CDCL  through  an  international 
competitive bidding process in accordance with ADB procedures as a goods package (ME-01). 
CDCL will retain ownership of the field, communications and control centre equipment. DHMS will 
enter into a services contract with CDCL to operate and maintain the FEWS.  
All data from the field equipment will be sent in quasi real-time to DHMS’s office in Thimphu where 
the flood forecasting will be carried out. All data from the control centre will be sent in quasi real-
time to a dedicated room (the operations centre) in Phuentsholing. The operations centre will be 
used to direct responses of the various agencies and stakeholders, in accordance with the FMP.  
C. 
Activities 
The activities, will include, but are not limited to: 
• 
review  available  information  related  to  PTDP,  DDM,  DHMS,  and  Phuentsholing 
Thromde, including site visits and meetings 
•  undertake  a  needs  assessment  of  the  FEWS  and  FMP.  This  should  include  a  GIS-
based geospatial risk assessment of the project area and Phuentsholing, culminating 
in  preparation  of  flood  hazard  maps28,  highlighting  existing  and  future29  levels  of 
exposure30 and vulnerability31. 
•  plan,  design  and  specify  the  FEWS  equipment32  in  close  consultation  with  DHMS, 
taking account of the risk mapping/assessment

equipment, communications equipment, and the equipment for the control centre and 
operations centre 
•  plan,  develop,  calibrate  and  operationalize  a  flood  forecasting  model  in  close 
consultation with DHMS 
28  Flood data for the Amochhu should utilise the 2D hydraulic model developed for CDCL by HCP. Flood data for the 
Omchhu will require hydrological and hydraulic modelling carried out as part of this task. 
29 Including population growth and climate change projections. 
30 Proximity to the river/source, water velocity, flood elevation. Highlight critical infrastructure and other public assets.
