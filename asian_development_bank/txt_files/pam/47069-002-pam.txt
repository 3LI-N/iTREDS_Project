management requirements to implement the project on time, within budget, and in accordance 
with  Government  and  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  policies  and  procedures.  The  PAM 
should include references to all available templates and instructions either through linkages to 
relevant URLs or directly incorporated in the PAM. 
2.  The Hebi City Government (HCG), as the executing agency, and Qibin District Government, Qi 
County  Government,  and  Xun  County  Government  as  the  implementing  agencies  are  wholly 
responsible for the implementation of the project, as agreed jointly between the borrower and 
ADB;  and  in  accordance  with  government  and  ADB  policies  and  procedures.  ADB  staff  is 
responsible  to  support  implementation  including  compliance  by  the  HCG  of  their  obligations 
and  responsibilities  for  project  implementation  in  accordance  with  ADB  policies  and 
procedures. 
3.  At  loan  negotiations  the  borrower  and  ADB  shall  agree  to  the  PAM  and  ensure  consistency 
with the loan and project agreements. Such agreements shall be reflected in the minutes of the 
loan negotiations. In the event of any discrepancy or contradiction between the PAM and the 
loan and project agreements, the provisions of the loan and project agreements shall prevail. 
4.  After ADB Board approval of the project's report and recommendations of the President (RRP), 
changes in implementation arrangements are subject to agreement and approval pursuant to 
relevant government and ADB administrative procedures (including the project administration 
instructions) and upon such approval they will be subsequently incorporated in the PAM.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
1. 
Rapid  economic  development  in  the  People’s  Republic  of  China  (PRC),  especially  of 
water  resources,  has  led  to  severe  degradation  of  ecosystems  and  the  decline  of  their 
fundamental  services  to  human  well-being.1  Deforestation  of  watersheds,  combined  with  point 
and  non-point  source  pollution,  have  led  to  increased  runoff,  higher  peak  flows,  downstream 
flooding, and poor water quality in many regions. This has resulted in loss of life and property 
and  has  required  costly  investments  for  large-scale  water  management  infrastructure  and 
reinforcement of river embankments.  
2. 
The  highest  environmental  agenda  of  the  PRC  at  present  is  to  attain  ‘ecological 
civilization’,  by  increasing  investments  in  restoration  of  ecosystems  and  environmental 
management.  Located  in  the  north  of  Henan  Province,  Hebi  City  has  a  total  population  of  1.6 
million  and  encompasses  83  kilometers  (km),  51%  of  the  entire  Qihe  River.  Originating  from 
Shanxi Province, the Qihe River flows into the Weihe River and then Hai River and finally into 
the Bohai Sea. The Qihe River basin in Hebi City has been selected as a national pilot project 
for  achieving  “Water  Ecological  Civilization”.    The  key  issues  affecting  the  ecological  integrity 
the Qihe River are introduced in the following paragraphs. 
Environmental  degradation  in  the  upper  Qihe  River  watershed.  Environmental 
3. 
conditions  along  the  river  have  deteriorated  due  to  intensive  economic  development  and 
increasing  human  populations  while  vegetation,  wetlands,  and  water  quality  along  the  Qihe 
River  have  declined  due  to  urbanization,  modification  of  the  river  hydrology,  habitat  loss  and 
deforestation,  livestock  grazing,  agriculture,  over-extraction  of  water,  and  non-point  source 
pollution. The 1,300 hectares (ha) of degraded hills within the scope of this project in the upper 
Qihe are almost completely barren of vegetation. A protected area covers part of the upper Qihe 
River,  the  pilot  Qihe  River  National  Wetland  Park  (NWP),  but  requires  habitat  restoration  and 
improved facilities and management.2  
4. 
Poor  flood  management  capacity.  Flood  control  capacity  of  the  mainstream  and 
tributaries  of  the  lower  Qihe  River  is  insufficient  due  to  siltation  and  the  poor  condition  of  old 
embankments. The flood control capacity of the lower Qihe River mainstream is only for a 1-in-
5-year  flood,  and  for  1-in-3-year  flood  in  the  tributaries  of  the  lower  Qihe  River.  In  Qi  County, 
and Qibin District, the tributaries and canals are heavily silted, congested with solid waste, and 
have degraded banks.  
5. 
Pollution from wastewater and solid waste. Surface water quality of the mainstream 
Qihe  River  and  canals  are  highly  polluted  and  exceeded  Class  III  and  Class  V,  respectively.3 
1   Ecosystem  services  are  the  direct  and  indirect  contributions  of  ecosystems  to  human  well-being.  They  support 
directly or indirectly our survival and quality of life. (http://biodiversity.europa.eu/topics/ecosystem-services) 
2   "Pilot"  refers  to  the  PRC  State  Forestry  Administration’s  practice  for  all  National  Wetland  Parks  prior  to  official 
designation,  which  only  occurs  after  the  assigned  management  agency  has  prepared  a  management  plan  and 
other relevant documentation for park management.  
3   In the People’s Republic of China (PRC), surface water quality and the use of surface water is regulated under the 
national Environmental Quality Standards for Surface Water Standard (GB 3838-2002), which grades quality and 
use  into  five  classes:  Class  I  (highest  quality)  -  drinking  water  sources  and  national  nature  reserves;  Class  II  - 
water  source  protection  areas,  and  habitats  of  rare  aquatic  organisms,  including  threatened  fish  and  fish  and 
shrimp spawning sites; Class III - suitable as a supply source for drinking water treatment and swimming; Class IV 
-  suitable  for  general  industrial  water  supply  and,  recreational  use  not  involving  direct  human  contact  with  the 
water; Class V - suitable only for agricultural water supply and general landscaping; and Class V+ (lowest quality) - 
unsuitable for any use. Each class is also defined by a range of water quality parameters. 
1 
Inadequate  facilities  for  wastewater  management  have  resulted  in  poor  water  quality  as  the 
three existing wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) that serve the project areas of Qibin District 
and  Qi  County  cannot  accommodate  the  increasing  volumes  of  wastewater.  The  city  sewage 
pipeline collection network currently covers 60% of the area in Qibin District and Qi County. As 
a  result,  untreated  wastewater  discharges  directly  to  the  lower  Qihe  River  mainstream  and 
tributaries.   
6. 
Poor  inter-sectoral  capacity  and  coordination  mechanisms  for  river  basin  and 
water resource management.  Numerous agencies are involved in management of Qihe River, 
yet  there  has  been  relatively  limited  inter-sectoral  coordination  for  integrated  water  resources 
management  (IWRM),  due  to  lack  of  mechanisms  for  information  sharing  and  monitoring 
capacity.  The  multi-sectoral  city-level  project  management  office  (PMO)  that  was  established 
during  the  project  preparation  phase  is  the  first  step  for  stronger  inter-sectoral  coordination. 
Continued  capacity  building  will  be  essential  to  supporting  IWRM,  including  a  management 
information  system,  and  ecological  monitoring  program,  to  guide  decision  making  among  the 
agencies for flood management, conservation, and other attributes.  
7. 
The  Hebi  City  Government  (HCG)  has  been  making  various  efforts  on  environmental 
improvement  and  ecological  conservation  in  the  Qihe  River  basin,  including  afforestation, 
WWTP construction and solid waste management. To address the issues described above, the 
HCG prepared various plans, including Master Plan for Hebi City Qihe  River Ecological Areas 
for 2010–2020 and Hebi City Urban Flood and Waterlogging Control Plan for 2011–2020.4 The 
HCG  requested  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to  provide  lending  support  to  implement 
environmental  improvement  and  ecological  conservation  in  and  around  Qihe  River  by 
integrating  key  activities  in  the  above-mentioned  plans  in  a  consistent  manner  and  to  support 
the city’s effort in implementation of this pilot initiative on ecological civilization, and therefore a 
demonstration project for other cities or provinces.5 
Strategic  fit.  The  project  contributes  to  the  PRC  Government’s  goal  of  building  a 
8. 
harmonious  and  prosperous  society 
through  regionally  balanced  and  environmentally 
sustainable growth and the decision of the Third Plenary Session of the 18th Central Committee 
of  the  Communist  Party  of  the  PRC  which  supports  eco-civilization  and  establishment  of  a 
system to protect ecological environment.6 The project also supports ADB’s strategic priorities of 
the Midterm Review of Strategy 2020,7 Environment Operational Directions, 2013–2020,8 Water 
Operational Plan, 2011–2020,9 and Urban Operational Plan, 2012–202010 to increase coverage 
and improved services for water supply and sanitation, and promote integrated water resources 
and river basin management. 
9. 
Lessons.  The  project  design  has  incorporated  lessons  from  other  initiatives  including 
previous  ADB-financed  projects  and  policy-oriented  studies  on  IWRM,  environmental  and 
ecosystem  improvement,  wetland  and  lake  management  and  restoration,  and  urban–rural 
integration in the PRC. Major lessons include the need for: (i) an integrated approach including 
4   These plans set targets for 2020, including flood control capacity of the lower Qihe River reach and its tributaries 
(to meet 1-in-20-year flood).

and  Qibin  District  from  a  1-in-3-year  to  a  1-in-5-year  flood  and  improve  the  overall  canal 
environmental  and  ecological  conditions,  through:  (i)  watercourse  widening  and  dredging;  (ii) 
riverbank  protection  with  embankment  and  vegetation;  and  (iii)  construction  of  supporting 
facilities including irrigation, bank-side walkways and landscaping. 
15. 
Output  3  will  support  improved  wastewater  and  solid  waste  management.  The  main 
sub-components  are  (i)  Qibin  District  wastewater  management,  (ii)  Qi  County  wastewater 
management, and (iii) solid waste management in both Qi County and Qibin District.  
16. 
Sub-component 3(i) will involve the installation of about 81.53 km storm water pipelines 
and  about  90.33  km  sanitary  sewers  in  Qibin  District.  Sub-component  3(ii)  includes:  (i) 
expanding  the  capacity  of  the  Qi  County WWTP  from  30,000  to  60,000 cubic  meters  per  day 
(m3/d);  (ii)  construction  of  132.49  km  storm  water  pipelines,  and  (iii)  installation  of  69.12  km 
sanitary sewers in Qi County.  Sub-component 3(iii) includes: (i) construction of 15 solid waste 
transfer stations and associated facilities with a designed handling capacity of 20 tons per day 
3 
(t/d) in Qi County; (ii) improvement of rural solid waste management in 13 riverside villages in 
the upper Qihe River and 20 villages in the lower Qihe River, including installation of bins, waste 
collection stations,  and garbage  transfer trucks; and  (iii)  piloting  public  awareness,  community 
participation, and training in solid waste management. 
Output 4 will support (i) establishment of a Qihe River Ecological  Monitoring Program; 
17. 
(ii)  development  of  a  Qihe  River  management  information  system  (MIS);  and  (iii)  training  and 
capacity  building  on  ecological  conservation,  river  restoration,  wastewater  management,  solid 
waste management, and project management and implementation.11  
18. 
The Qihe River Ecological Monitoring Program (subcomponent 4(i)) will support HCG to 
(a)  monitor  the  ecological  health  of  the  Qihe  River;  and  (b)  measure  progress  of  the  project 
activities  for  wetland  conservation  and  species  protection  in  the  pilot  Qihe  River  NWP. 
Subcomponent  4(ii),  the  MIS  will  provide  the  overarching  framework  for  integrated  basin 
monitoring  and  management,  including  flood  warning  and  forecast,  and  water  quality  and 
ecological monitoring.  
Innovation  and special  features. The  project  demonstrates  an  integrated  and holistic 
19. 
approach to ecosystem and water resources management in one of the most flood-prone and 
ecologically  sensitive  sections  of  a river  system.  The  integrated  approach  combines  structural 
and  non-structural  measures  to  the  differing  conditions  of  the  river  sections,  and  include  (i) 
wetland  protection  and  soil  erosion  reduction  in  the  upper  section,  (ii)  reduction  of  pollution 
loads from sewage and solid waste in the upper and middle sections, (iii) flood management in 
the  middle  and  lower  sections,  (iv)  capacity  building  of  community  ‘river  guards’,12  (v) 
establishment of community environmental monitors, and (vi) development of the MIS. As Hebi 
City has been selected as a national pilot city for “water ecological civilization”, and “pilot NWP”, 
this  project  offers  a  unique  opportunity  for  demonstration  of  a  successful  IWRM  model  and 
future replication.

IV. 
COSTS AND FINANCING 
The  project 
is  estimated 
20. 
including  physical  and  price 
contingencies  and  financial  charges  during  implementation.  The  government  has  requested  a 
loan of $150 million from ADB’s ordinary capital resources to help finance the project. The loan 
will  have  a  25-year  term,  including  (i)  a  grace  period  of  5  years,  (ii)  straight-line  repayment 
method, (iii) annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB’s London interbank offered 
to  cost  $325.4  million, 
15 
rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, (iv) commitment charge of 0.15% per year to be charged on 
the  undisbursed  loan  amount,  and  (v)  other  terms  and  conditions  set  in  the  loan  agreements. 
The average loan maturity is 15.25 years and the maturity premium payable to ADB is 0.1% per 
annum.  ADB’s  Controller’s  Department  will  provide  the  final  confirmation  and  issue  the  loan 
repayment  schedule  at  loan  negotiations.  Financial  charges  during  implementation  will  be 
capitalized. 
21. 
The  ADB  loan  will  finance  46.1%  of  the  project  cost,  including  civil  works,  goods,  and 
consulting services.  The Government of the PRC is the borrower of the loan and will make the 
loan available, through the Henan Provincial Government and  HCG, to the responsible county 
and  district  governments  on  the  same  terms  and  conditions  as  those  of  the  ADB  loan. 
Municipal,  county  and  district  governments  will  assume  the  foreign  exchange  and  interest 
variation  risks  of  the  ADB  loan,  including  contingencies.  The  HCG  has  assured  ADB  that 
counterpart  funding  will  be  provided  in  a  timely  manner,  including  any  counterpart  funding 
required for any shortfall of funds or cost overruns. 
A. 
Cost Estimates Preparation and Revisions 
22. 
Preparation.  The  cost  estimates  were  prepared  by  the  HCG  based  on  the  feasibility 
study  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  Guidelines  on  Preparing  and  Presenting  Cost  Estimates  for 
Projects and Programs Financed by ADB.13 
Revisions.    The  cost  estimates  may  be  updated  prior  to  approval  and  during  the 
23. 
implementation of the project. 
B. 
Assumptions 
24. 
The following assumptions underpin the cost estimates: 
a.  Exchange rate: CNY 6.2 = $1.0 (as of 2 August 2015) 
b.  Price contingencies based on expected inflation over the implementation period:

a    Includes  taxes  and  duties  of  $10.68  million,  $5.91  million  of  which  will  be  financed  by  government  counterpart 
funds,  and  $4.77  million  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  loan.  The  amount  of  taxes  and  duties  to  be 
financed by ADB is based on the principles that (i) the amount will be within the reasonable threshold identified 
during the country partnership strategy preparation process, (ii) the amount of taxes and duties financed by the 
ADB loan does not represent excessive share of the project, (iii) the taxes and duties apply only to ADB-financed 
expenditures, and (iv) the financing of taxes and duties is material and relevant to the success of the project. 
b  As of 2 August 2015. In 2015 prices. 
c  Physical contingencies computed at 10% of base costs. Price contingencies were computed using the escalation 
factors  published by  ADB  on local  and  foreign  components of  the  project  costs; includes provision  for  potential 
exchange rate fluctuation using the purchasing power parity of exchange rate concept. 
d   Includes interest and commitment charges. Interest during construction for the ADB loan has been computed at 
the  5-year  US  dollar  fixed  swap  rate  plus  a  spread  of  0.50%  and  a  maturity  premium  of  0.10%.  Commitment 
charge for the ADB loan is 0.15% per year to be charged on the undisbursed loan amount.

FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT 
A. 
Financial Management Assessment 
The  financial  management  assessment  (FMA)  was  conducted  in  July  2015  in 
25. 
accordance  with  ADB’s  Guidelines  for  the  Financial  Management  and  Analysis  of  Projects, 
Financial  Due  Diligence:  a  Methodology  Note,  and  Technical  Guidance  Note:  Financial 
Management Assessment. The FMA considered the financial management capacity of the nine 
Project  Implementation  Units  (PIU)  established  within  the  Qibin  District,  Qi  County  and  Xun 
County, and the Project Management Office (PMO) established within the  HCG, the executing 
agency.  The  assessment  covered  funds-flow  arrangements,  staffing,  accounting  and  financial 
reporting  systems,  internal  and  external  auditing  arrangements,  and  financial  information 
systems.  
26. 
The  assessment  identified  the  main  financial  management  risks  as:  (i)  implementation 
risk - lack of familiarity with ADB disbursement procedures and requirements which could delay 
project implementation, (ii) compliance risk - lack of familiarity with ADB financial management 
requirements,  particularly  on  accounting,  reporting,  and  auditing,  which  may  delay  project 
reporting  and  derail  identification  of  issues  on  the  use  of  loan  proceeds,  (iii)  financing  risk  – 
delays 
funding  which  could  delay  project 
implementation, and (iv) financial risk - inadequate wastewater and solid waste tariffs that could 
impact financial sustainability. The overall financial management risk rating of the project before 
considering  mitigating  measures  is  Medium.  The  identified  financial  management  risks  will  be 
closely  monitored  during  project  implementation.  The  financial  management  action  plan  is  as 
follows: 
inadequate  counterpart

Disbursement 
The  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  Loan  Disbursement 
27. 
Handbook  (2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time),  and  detailed  arrangements  agreed  upon 
between the government and ADB. Online training for project staff on disbursement policies and 
procedures  is  available  at:  http://wpqr4.adb.org/disbursement_elearning.  Project  staff 
is 
encouraged to avail of this training to help ensure efficient disbursement and fiduciary control. 
25 
Imprest fund procedure. To facilitate project implementation through timely release of 
28. 
loan proceeds, Henan Provincial Finance Department (HPFD) will establish an imprest account 
promptly after loan effectiveness at a commercial bank acceptable to ADB. The imprest account 
is  to  be  used  exclusively  for  the  ADB’s  share  of  eligible  expenditures.  The  currency  of  the 
imprest  account  will  be  US  dollar.  HPFD,  who  established  the  imprest  account  in  its  name,  is 
accountable  and  responsible  for  proper  use  of  advances  to  the  imprest  account.  The  total 
outstanding advance to the imprest account should not exceed the estimate of ADB’s share of 
expenditures to be paid through the imprest account for the forthcoming 6 months. HPFD may 
request  for  initial  and  additional  advances  to  the  imprest  account  based  on  an  Estimate  of 
Expenditure Sheet setting out the estimated expenditures to be financed through the account for 
the  forthcoming  6  months.  Supporting  documents  should  be  submitted  to  ADB  or  retained  by 
HPFD in accordance with ADB’s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2015, as amended from time 
to time) when liquidating or replenishing the imprest account. 
Statement  of  Expenditure  (SOE)  procedure.  The  SOE  procedure14  may  be  used  for 
29. 
reimbursement  of  eligible  expenditures  or  liquidation  of  advances  to  the  imprest  account.  The 
ceiling  of  the  SOE  procedure  is  the  equivalent  of  US$100,000  per  individual  payment.  
Supporting  documents  and  records  for  the  expenditures  claimed  under  the  SOE  should  be 
maintained and made readily available for review by ADB's disbursement and review missions, 
upon  ADB's  request  for  submission  of  supporting  documents  on  a  sampling  basis,  and  for 
independent audit. Reimbursement and liquidation of individual payments in excess of the SOE 
ceiling should be supported by full documentation when submitting the withdrawal application to 
ADB. 
The  minimum  value  per  withdrawal  application  is  US$100,000  equivalent.  Individual 
30. 
payments  below  this  amount  should  be  paid  by  the  HCG/implementing  agencies  and 
subsequently  claimed  from  ADB  (i)  through  reimbursement;  or  (ii)  from  the  imprest  account, 
unless otherwise accepted by ADB. 
31. 
No withdrawals shall be made from the loan account until the government has certified 
to  ADB  that  on-lending  agreement  and  project  implementation  agreement  have  been  duly 
executed and delivered between HCG and the local governments.  
C. 
Accounting 
32. 
The  HCG  will  maintain,  or  cause  to  be  maintained,  separate  books  and  records  by 
funding  source  for  all  expenditures  incurred  on  the  project  using  the  Accounting  Methods  for 
Projects  Financed  by  the  World  Bank  (reference  No.  2000  [13]).15  The  HCG  will  prepare 
consolidated project financial statements in accordance with the government's accounting laws 
and regulations, which are consistent with international accounting principles and practices. 
D. 
Auditing  
33. 
HCG  will  cause  the  detailed  consolidated  project  financial  statements  to  be  audited  in 
accordance with national auditing standards by an independent auditor acceptable to ADB. The 
14 SOE forms are available in Appendix 9B and 9C of ADB’s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2015, as amended from    
time to time). 
15 Accounting regulations issued by the Ministry of Finance for all foreign aid-funded projects. 
26 
audited project financial statements together with the auditors’ opinion  will be submitted in the 
English language to ADB within 6 months of the end of the fiscal year by the HCG. 
34. 
The annual audit report for the project accounts will include an audit management letter 
and  audit  opinions  which  cover  (i)  whether the project financial  statements  present  a true  and 
fair  view  or  are  presented  fairly,  in  all  material  respects,  in  accordance  with  the  applicable 
financial  reporting  framework;  (ii)  whether  loan  and  grant  proceeds  were  used  only  for  the 
purposes of the project or not; (iii) the level of compliance for each financial covenant contained 
in the legal agreements for the project; (iv) use of the imprest fund procedure; and (v) the use of 
the  SOE  procedure  certifying  to  the  eligibility  of  those  expenditures  claimed  under  SOE 
procedures, and proper use of the SOE and imprest procedures in accordance with ADB’s Loan 
Disbursement Handbook (2015, as amended from time to time) and the project documents. 
35. 
Compliance  with  financial  reporting  and  auditing  requirements  will  be  monitored  by 
review  missions  and  during  normal  program  supervision,  and  followed  up  regularly  with  all 
concerned, including the external auditor.  
36. 
The  government,  HCG,  and  the  implementing  agencies  have  been  made  aware  of 
ADB’s  approach  to  delayed  submission,  and  the  requirements  for  satisfactory  and  acceptable 
quality of the audited project financial statements. ADB reserves the right to require a change in 
the  auditor  (in  a  manner  consistent  with  the  constitution  of  the  borrower),  or  for  additional 
support  to  be  provided  to  the  auditor,  if  the  audits  required  are  not  conducted  in  a  manner 
satisfactory  to ADB,  or  if  the  audits  are  substantially  delayed.  ADB  reserves the  right to verify 
the  project's  financial  accounts  to  confirm  that  the  share  of  ADB’s  financing  is  used  in 
accordance with ADB’s policies and procedures.  
37. 
Public  disclosure  of  the  project  financial  statements,  including  the  audit  report  on  the 
project  financial  statements,  will  be  guided  by  ADB’s  Public  Communications  Policy  (2011). 
After review, ADB will disclose the project financial statements for the project and the opinion of 
the  auditors  on  the  financial  statements  within  30  days  of  the  date  of  their  receipt  by  posting 
them on ADB’s website. The Audit Management Letter will not be disclosed. 
VI. 
PROCUREMENT AND CONSULTING SERVICES 
38. 
A  project  procurement  risk  assessment  was  conducted  for  the  project,  in  accordance 
with  the  Guide  on  Assessing  Procurement  Risks  and  Determining  Project  Procurement 
Classification.  
39. 
Overall  project  procurement  risk  is  moderate.  Main  risks  identified  are  (i)  staff  of 
Engineering Department (established in the city PMO)  which will conduct all procurements and 
consultant  recruitments  for  the  project  do  not  have  experience  in  internationally-financed 
projects;  and  (ii)  there  are  some  discrepancies  between  HCG’s  and  ADB’s  procurement 
practices.  The  second  risk  was  mitigated  since  the  city  PMO  and  its  Engineering  Department 
committed to fulfill ADB’s requirements for all procurements and consultant recruitments for the 
project.  
40. 
To mitigate the first risk, training on ADB’s requirements for procurement and consultant 
recruitments was provided to the staff of Engineering Department during project preparation. To 
further mitigate the first risk, it is proposed that (i) Engineering Department, with support from an 
individual  procurement  consultant  and  a  procurement  agency,  prepare  manuals 
for 
procurements  and  consultant  recruitments  which  fulfil  ADB’s  requirements,  at  project  start-up; 
27 
(ii) the individual procurement consultant will provide the staff with training on procurement and 
consultant  recruitments,  at  project  start-up;  (iii)  a  procurement  specialist  of  the  project 
management  support  consultant  team  continue  such  training;  (iv)  the  consultants  and  the 
procurement  agency  help  the  staff  conduct  procurement  and  consultant  recruitments  for  the 
project;  (v)  ADB  continue  to  give  guidance  and  instructions  to  the  staff;  and  (vi)  ADB  closely 
monitor procurement and consultant recruitment activities. 
A. 
Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing 
41. 
All  advance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  should  be  undertaken  in  conformity 
with  ADB’s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  ADB’s 
Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). The issuance of 
invitations for bid under advance contracting and retroactive financing will be subject to ADB’s 
prior review and approval. The approval of advance contracting and retroactive financing does 
not commit ADB to subsequently approve the project or to finance the procurement costs.  
42. 
Advance contracting will be undertaken with the following conditions: 
(i)  Resettlement  plan  and  environment  management  plan  (EMP)  have  been  reviewed 
and cleared by ADB. 
(ii)  In  case  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  (LAR)  activities  commence  ahead  of 
approval of the resettlement plan, resettlement due diligence report (by an external 
monitor, confirming that the  resettlement plan implementation is in accordance with 
the  resettlement  plan  and  ADB  policies  and  procedures)  should  be  prepared  in 
addition to the resettlement plan itself. 
(iii)  All conditions precedent to contract award such as approval of finalized resettlement 
plan (and due diligence report) reflecting detailed measurement survey and approval 
of environmental impact assessment (EIA). 
43. 
The HCG was advised that retroactive financing may only apply up to the equivalent of 
20% of the total ADB loan, to cover eligible expenditures incurred for works, goods, consulting 
services, and training procured through advance contracting before loan effectiveness, but not 
more than 12 months before the signing of the loan agreement. 
44. 
Approval  of  advance  contracting  does  not  commit  ADB  to  finance  the  project.  The 
amount to be retroactively financed does not exceed 20% of the loan and will be incurred before 
loan  effectiveness  but  not  earlier  than  12  months  before  the  signing  of  the  related  legal 
agreement. 
45. 
All  procurement  of  goods  and  works  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB’s 
Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time)10  and the Procurement Reform - 
10 Point Action Plan and associated reforms. Before the start of any procurement, ADB and the 
government will review the public procurement laws of the central and provincial governments to 
ensure consistency with ADB’s Procurement Guidelines. 
B. 
Procurement of Goods, Works and Consulting Services 
1.  
ICB Procedures 
46. 
International competitive bidding (ICB) procedures will be used for civil works contracts 
estimated to cost $40 million equivalent or above and for goods valued at $3 million equivalent 
or more.  
28 
47. 
Unless otherwise specified, procurement under ICB procedures will use the single-stage 
one-envelope  modality.  Procurement  shall  use  the  latest  ADB  standard  bidding  documents 
which can be downloaded from ADB website.  
2.  
NCB Procedures 
48. 
National  competitive  bidding  (NCB)  will  be  used  for  civil  works  contracts  estimated  to 
cost over $100,000 equivalent up to below $40 million. While, NCB will be used for goods and 
equipment from over $100,000 to below $3 million, equivalent.   
49. 
For  procurement  under  NCB,  the  following  provisions  should  be  applied:  (i)  the 
advertisement  may  be  limited  to  the  national  press,  an  official  gazette  or  an  open  access 
website;  (ii)  bidding  shall  follow  the  standard  bidding  documents  issued  by  the  Ministry  of 
Finance  and  approved  by  ADB;  and  (iii)  bidding  documents  may  be  only  in  the  Chinese 
language, and CNY may be used for the purpose of bidding and payment. NCB contracts with 
cost of $500,000 or more for goods and $1,000,000 or more for works will also be advertised in 
Business Opportunities of ADB’s website. 
50. 
Shopping  will  be  allowed  for  contracts  valued  at  $100,000  equivalent  or  less  for  civil 
works and goods, respectively. The relevant sections of ADB’s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as 
amended to date) will be included in procurement documents and contracts. 
3. 
Community Participation  
The  procurement  method of  community  participation  will  be  adopted  for  Environmental 
51. 
Management  Mechanism,  considering  the  intensive  participation  will  be  employed  for  the 
implementation.  The  detailed  implementation  plan  needs  to  be  approved  by  ADB.  And  the 
threshold of $100,000 will be applied if any works or equipment procurement is involved. 
4.  
Consulting Services 
52. 
Project  management  consulting  services  and  capacity  development  services  will  be 
recruited  according  to  ADB’s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2013,  as  amended  from 
time to time).16 The Hebi PMO will be responsible for engaging consultants through quality- and 
cost-based selection (QCBS) for the project management and capacity development consulting 
service.17  
5. 
Thresholds for ADB Review 
53. 
For goods and works contracts estimated to cost $10 million or more, prior review of the 
following  documents  is  required:  invitation  for  bids,  bidding  documents,  bid  evaluation  report, 
draft  negotiated  contract,  signed  contract,  and  contract  variations.  ADB’s  no  objection  is 
required for each step of procurement. 
54. 
The  first  ICB  and  NCB  contracts  for  goods  and  works  will  be  for  ADB’s  prior  review 
irrespective of the estimated value. All contracts under advance contracting are subject to prior 
review. Approval of ADB of the procurement documents (prequalification, bidding, contract, etc.) 
is required. 
16
   Checklists  for  actions  required  to  contract  consultants  by  method  available  in  e-Handbook  on  Project 
Implementation at: http://www.adb.org/documents/handbooks/project-implementation

National Competitive Bidding 
The Borrower’s Law of Tendering and Bidding of the PRC promulgated by Order No. 21 
64. 
of  the  President  of  the  PRC  on  August  30,  1999,  are  subject  to  the  following  clarifications 
required for compliance with the Guidelines: 
(i)  All  invitations  to  prequalify  or  to  bid  shall  be  advertised  in  the  national  press,  or 
official gazette, or a free and open access website in the Borrower’s country. Such 
advertisement  shall  be  made  in  sufficient  time  for  prospective  bidders  to  obtain 
prequalification or bidding documents and prepare and submit their responses. In 
any  event,  a  minimum  preparation  period  of  30  days  shall  be  given.  The 
preparation period shall count (a) from the date of advertisement, or (b) when the 
documents are available for issue, whichever date is later. The advertisement and 
the  prequalification  and  bidding  documents  shall  specify  the  deadline  for  such 
submission; 
(ii)  Qualification requirements of bidders and the method of evaluating the qualification 
of  each  bidder  shall  be  specified  in  detail  in  the  bidding  documents,  and  in  the 
prequalification documents if the bidding is preceded by a prequalification process; 
If  bidding  is  preceded  by  a  prequalification  process,  all  bidders  that  meet  the 
qualification criteria set out in the prequalification document shall be allowed to bid 
and there shall be no limit on the number of prequalified bidders; 
(iii) 
(iv)  All  bidders  shall  be  required  to  provide  a  performance  security  in  an  amount 
sufficient  to  protect  the  borrower/project  executing  agency  in  case  of  breach  of 
contract  by  the  contractor,  and  the  bidding  documents  shall  specify  the  required 
form and amount of such performance security; 
(v)  Bidders shall be allowed to submit bids by mail or by hand; 
(vi)  All bids shall be opened in public; all bidders shall be afforded an opportunity to be 
present  (either  in  person  or  through  their  representatives)  at  the  time  of  bid 
opening, but bidders shall not be required to be present at the bid opening; 
(vii)  All  bid  evaluation  criteria  shall  be  disclosed  in  the  bidding  documents  and 
quantified in monetary terms or expressed in the form of pass/fail requirements; 
(viii)  No  bid  may  be  rejected  solely  on  the  basis  that  the  bid  price  falls  outside  any 
standard contract estimate, or margin or bracket of average bids established by the 
borrower/project executing agency; 
(ix)  Each contract shall be awarded to the lowest evaluated responsive bidder, that is, 
the  bidder  who  meets  the  appropriate  standards  of  capability  and  resources  and 
whose  bid  has  been  determined  (a)  to  be  substantially  responsive  to  the  bidding 
documents and (b) to offer the lowest evaluated cost. The winning bidder shall not 
be  required,  as  a  condition  of  award,  to  undertake  responsibilities  for  work  not 
stipulated  in  the  bidding  documents  or  otherwise  to  modify  the  bid  as  originally 
submitted; 
(x)  Each  contract  financed  with  the  proceeds  of  the  loan  shall  provide  that  the 
suppliers and contractors shall permit ADB, at its request, to inspect their accounts 
and records relating to the performance of the contract and to have said accounts 
and records audited by auditors appointed by ADB; 
(xi)  Government-owned enterprises in the borrower’s country may be permitted to bid if 
they can establish that they (a) are legally and financially autonomous, (b) operate 
under commercial law, and (c) are not a dependent agency of the borrower/project 
executing agency; and 
38 
(xii)  Rebidding  shall  not  be  allowed  solely  because  the  number  of  bids  is  less  than 
three (3).

Statement  (2009).  The  project  EIA  and  EMP  form  the  basis  of  the  official  loan  agreement 
between ADB and the executing agency. The executing agency, through the PMO, holds final 
responsibility for implementation and compliance with the EMP. The EMP will be implemented 
in  all  phases  of  the  project-design,  pre-construction,  construction,  and  operation.  The  EMP 
complies with the PRC’s environmental laws and ADB’s SPS. The EMP contains: (i) objectives; 
(ii) roles and responsibilities; (iii) mitigation measures; (iv) inspection, monitoring, and reporting 
arrangements;  (v)  training  and  institutional  strengthening;  (vi)  GRM;  (vii)  future  public 
consultation; and (viii) a feedback and adjustment mechanism.  
96. 
In  the  design  stage,  the  HPMO  will  pass  the  EMP  to  the  design  institutes  for 
incorporating mitigation measures into the detailed designs. The EMP will be updated at the end 
of the detailed design, as needed. To ensure that bidders will respond to the EMP’s provisions, 
the  HPMO  and  local  project  implementation  units  (PIU)  will  prepare  and  provide  the  following 
specification  clauses  for  incorporation  into  the  bidding  documents:  (i)  a  list  of  environmental 
management requirements to be budgeted by the bidders in their proposals; (ii) environmental 
clauses  for  contractual  terms  and  conditions;  and  (iii)  component  domestic  EIAs,  and  project 
EIA including updated EMP for compliance. 
97. 
Climate change. ADB’s preliminary climate risk screening indicated the project was at a 
high risk from climate change. A climate risk vulnerability assessment was conducted to identify 
the  threat  that  climate  change  presents  to  project  viability,  assuming  a  design  life  of  40–50 
years. Modeling indicates that between 2020 and 2070, mean annual temperatures will rise, the 
risk of extreme climate events will increase, and variability in precipitation will increase, causing 
53 
more rainy or dry days. This could cause flood damage to the project embankments, channels, 
and pipelines, excessive sediment deposition in the lower Qihe River and canals and the need 
for more channel maintenance, and higher mortality or disease of the planted vegetation due to 
altered temperatures or water availability. To accommodate these risks, project structures have 
to  PRC  flood  protection  standards  and  will  be  regularly  maintained, 
been  designed 
embankments  with  a  porous  design  have  been  selected,  a  flood  warning  system  will  be 
implemented, plant species for re-vegetation have been selected for suitability to the seasonally 
harsh  climate  and  local  soil  conditions,  and  training  will  be  given  in  IWRM  and  wetland 
management.  As  a  result,  flood  control  capacity  will  be  improved  from  a  1-in-3  to  1-in-5  year 
recurrence  interval  for  the  project  canals  and  the  1-in-20  year  capacity  for  the  Qihe  River 
mainstream will be secured. 
Anticipated impacts and mitigation measures during construction. Project works in 
98. 
the  pilot  NWP  will  cause  temporary  noise  and  visual  disturbance  which  may  result  in 
disturbance  to  migratory  and/or  nesting  waterbird  communities,  including  storks,  ducks  and 
geese,  minor  damage  to  aquatic  habitats,  fish,  and  aquatic  invertebrates  due  to  elevated 
sediment levels, and small-scale flow diversions during works. The river rehabilitation works will 
involve the  dredging  of about  4.18 million  cubic  meters  (m3)  of  excavation (excluding  dredged 
sediments)  from  the  project  canals  and  tributaries  (widening  and  blockage  removal  along  the 
channels) and embankments along the lower Qi. After use for back-fill, about 3.66 million m3 of 
spoil will require disposal. This will be disposed in 26 disposal sites, which comprise trenches, 
farmland, and uncultivated land and shrubbery areas of low ecological value. 
Dredging  of  waterways  will  produce  about  85,232 m3  dredged  sediments from  the four 
99. 
tributaries in Qi County and 18,050 m3 from the five canals in Qibin District. The canals in Qibin 
District are small and narrow, and in the dry season, flows are minimal and slow (<1 m3/s). Flow 
will be controlled by existing upstream sluice gates during dredging. Dredged sediment will be 
drained  and  used  as  soil  supply  for  project  component  1.1  (re-greening  of  barren  hills).  Solid 
waste (litter) will be transported to Caizhuang Landfill Site. Caizhuang Landfill is 10 km from the 
canals  and  has  receiving  capacity  of  530  t/d,  total  capacity  of  2.79  million  m3,  and  remaining 
operational  lifetime  (at  current  rates  of  landfill)  of  about  13  years.  For  the  four  canals  in  Qi 
County,  the  estimated  daily  dredged  amount  will  be  2,500  m3.  This  will  be  dried  by  belt 
dewatering machine then transported to Huangzhuang Quarry, east of Huangzhuang Village, Qi 
County.  The  quarry  was  formed  in the  1990s  to supply  earth and gravel  for  road construction 
and  is  no  longer  used. The quarry  comprises  a  large,  deep  pit. The  dredged  sediment  will  be 
disposed in this pit. The sediment quality is suitable for agriculture, and the site will be used by 
residents for agriculture after project completion. 
100.  For construction of the Qi County WWTP, solid waste transfer stations and installation of 
sewer  and storm  collection  pipelines  in Qi  County  and Qibin District,  construction  will  result  in 
temporary dust and noise disturbance to residents. Mitigation measures have been developed 
for all potential construction-related impacts and are included in the EMP. Overall the potential 
impacts are considered relatively low and manageable. 
101.  Anticipated  impacts  and  mitigation  measures  during  operation  phase.  Potential 
operational risks include: (i) impact of odor emissions from the Qi County WWTP to residents; 
(ii)  cumulative  effect  on  water  quality  in  Zhejing  canal  due  to  the  discharge  of  the  treated 
wastewater; and (iii) inadequate maintenance of project facilities, including river embankments, 
due to insufficient capacity and/or operating budget. For odor impacts, a buffer zone distance of 
100  meters  (m)  from  the WWTP  to  the  nearest  residents  has  been  established  and  complies 
with the PRC standard. For effluent quality, the Qi County WWTP will treat wastewater to Class 
54 
1A  of  the  PRC’s  Discharge  Standard  of  Pollutants  for  Municipal  Wastewater  Treatment  Plant, 
the  highest  possible  standard,  before  discharge  to  Zhejing  River.  Effluent  and  surface  water 
quality  monitoring  will  be  conducted  by  the  local  environment  protection  bureaus  (EPBs).  For 
maintenance of project facilities, roles and responsibilities for operation and maintenance have 
been largely defined. Embankments will be maintained by the river course management stations 
of the county/district Water Resources Bureaus, supported by riverguards, and the barren hills 
will be managed by the Qibin District Forestry Bureau. For the pilot NWP, the need to establish 
a management agency and management plan was identified during project preparation and has 
been  included  in the  design. The  project  will  provide  training for  agencies in the  management 
and maintenance for all activities, especially wetland management in the NWP.  
implementation  responsibilities.  The 
102.  EMP 
for  environmental 
management  and  supervision  during  the  various  stages  of  implementation  of  the  project  are 
defined in the EMP. HCG (through PMO) and the implementing agencies (through the PIUs) will 
assume  overall  responsibility  for  implementing,  supervising,  monitoring  and  reporting  on  the 
EMP.  The  EMP 
responsibilities  of  governmental 
organizations are summarized below.

103.  PMO environment officer. The PMO will have main EMP coordination responsibility. A 
full time environmental officer has been assigned in the HPMO to coordinate implementation of 
the  EMP.      The  officer  will:  (i)  ensure  that  environmental  management,  monitoring,  and 
mitigation  measures  are  incorporated  into  bidding  documents,  construction  contracts  and 
operation  management  plans;  (ii)  coordinate  the  project  level  GRM;  (iii)  on  behalf  of  PMO, 
prepare  semiannual  EMP  monitoring  and  progress  reports,  for  submission  to  ADB;  (iv) 
coordinate  the  training  and  consultation  plans  defined  in  the  EMP;  (v)  respond  to  any 
unforeseen adverse impacts beyond those mentioned in this EMP; and (vi) coordinate work with 
the PIU Environment Officers.  
104.  PIU environment officers. Each PIU will assign one full-time PIU Environment Officer 
to coordinate EMP at local level i.e. total of nine officers. These officers will: (i) implement the 
EMP  at  a  day-to-day  site  level;  (ii)  coordinate  the  recruitment  of  construction  supervision 
companies; (iii) act as local entry points to the GRM; (iv) report to the PIUs and PMO on EMP 
implementation progress; and (v) work closely with the PMO Environment and Social Officers to 
coordinate EMP work, including reporting and the GRM, across the project area. 
105.  Loan  implementation  environment  consultant.  A  LIEC  will  be  hired  under  the  loan 
implementation  consultant  services.  The  LIEC  will  advise  the  PMO,  PIUs,  contractors,  and 
construction  supervision  companies  on  all  aspects  of  environmental  management  and 
monitoring  for  the  project.  The  LIEC  will  (i)  assist  in  updating  the  EMP  and  environmental 
monitoring  program,  as  needed;  (ii)  supervise  the  implementation  of  the  mitigation  measures 
specified  in  the  EMP;  (iii)  train  the  PMO  and  PIUs  in  how  to  prepare  the  semiannual  EMP 
monitoring  and  progress  reports  to  ADB  and  during  the  early  stages  of  training,  lead  the 
preparation of these documents; (iv) provide training to the PMO, PIUs, and CSCs on the PRC’s 
environmental  laws,  regulations  and  policies,  ADB’s  SPS  (2009),  EMP  implementation,  and 
GRM in accordance with the training plan; (v) identify any environment-related implementation 
issues,  and  propose  necessary  corrective  actions;  and  (vi)  undertake  site  visits  for  EMP 
inspection as required.  
106.  Construction  Contractors  and  Construction  Supervision  Companies  (CSCs). 
Construction contractors will be responsible for implementing relevant EMP mitigation measures 
during construction, under the supervision of the CSCs and PIUs. Contractors will develop site-
specific EMPs on the basis of this project EMP. CSCs will be selected through the PRC bidding 
procedure by the PIUs. The CSCs will be responsible for supervising construction progress and 
quality,  and  EMP  implementation  on  construction  sites.  Each  CSC  shall  have  at  least  one 
environmental  engineer  on  each  construction  site  to:  (i)  supervise  the  contractor’s  EMP 
implementation  performance;  and  (ii)  prepare  the  contractor’s  environmental  management 
performance section in monthly project progress reports submitted to the PIUs and PMO. 
56 
Institutional strengthening, training. To ensure effective implementation of the EMP, 
107. 
the  capacity  of  PMO,  PIUs,  O&M  Units,  contractors,  CSCs,  and  local  bureaus  (especially 
forestry  and  water  resources)  will  be  strengthened.  The  project  will  implement  institutional 
capacity building, and training, as follows: 
(i)  Appointment of PMO and PIU Environment Officers and Social Officers; 
(ii)  Contracting  of  a  wetland  specialist  and  river  specialist  to  support  detailed  design 
and implementation; 
(iii)  Contracting of a LIEC to support the PMO and PIUs with EMP implementation and 
(iv) 
ensure compliance with ADB’s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009); and, 
Implementation  of  a  training  program  for  all  relevant  agencies.  Training  will  be 
facilitated by the loan implementation consultants, including the LIEC, wetland, and 
river specialists. 
108.  Grievance  redress  mechanism.  A  project-specific  grievance  redress  mechanism 
(GRM)  has  been  established  to  receive  and  manage  any  public  environmental  and/or  social 
issues which may arise due to the project. This complements the PRC’s national environmental 
complaint  hotline  (12369).  The  PMO  and  PIU  Environment  Officers  and  Social  Officers  will 
coordinate the GRM. All project agencies and staff will be trained in the GRM and will take an 
active role in supporting the GRM when necessary.  
109.  Pursuant to ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), ADB funds may not be applied to 
the activities described on the ADB Prohibited Investment Activities List set forth at Appendix 5 
of the Safeguard Policy Statement. 
B. 
Land Acquisition and Resettlement 
110. 
Introduction. The project is classified as Category A in terms of involuntary resettlement 
and thus all resettlement plans and subsequent updates or new resettlement plans will need to 
be  reviewed  and  cleared  by  ADB’s  Environment  and  Social  Safeguards  Division  (SDES)  in 
accordance with ADB’s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009).   
111.  Since the detailed measurement surveys (DMSs) have not been conducted, the current 
resettlement plans are consider drafts and will have to be updated and these final resettlement 
plans  will  need  to  resubmitted  to  ADB  for  approval.  These  update  will  be  based  on  the  final 
designs, census of affected persons and inventory of loses (land and fixed assets). The project 
implementing  agencies  (Qibin  District  Government,  Qi  County  Government,  and  Xun  County 
Government)  will  re-endorse  the  final  resettlement  plans  and  re-disclose  to  affected  villages. 
The construction contract for any civil works involving resettlement impacts will not be awarded 
until the relevant updated resettlement plan is approved by ADB. 
112.  Scope  of  Resettlement  Impacts.  In  order  to  avoid  or  minimize  the  impacts  of  LAR, 
consultations  were  conducted  with  the  local  government  departments,  village  committees  and 
affected persons during the preparation of the resettlement plans. Based on the latest FSR, the 
Project  will  affect  70  villages  in  16  towns,  townships  and  sub-districts  belonging  to  1  district 
(Qibin District) and 2 counties (Qi County and Xun County) in the project area.  
113.  The project will require a total area of 4,433.10 mu of land to be permanently occupied, 
including  acquisition  of  1,174.23  mu  collectively-owned  of  land,  leasing  of  1,959.28  mu 
57 
collectively-owned18  land,  and  occupation  of  1,299.59  mu  state-owned  land.  The  project  will 
temporarily  occupy  1,557.68  mu  of  land  in  total,  including  727.83  mu  collectively-owned  land 
and  829.85  mu  of  state-owned  land.  In  addition,  eight  rural  houses  and  two  small  businesses 
need to be demolished with a total area of 5,295.12 square meters (m2). The project will affect 
739  households  with  3,481  persons  permanently  and  515  households  with  2,253  persons 
temporarily,  totaling  1,254  households  with  5,734  persons.  The  land  loss  is  not  significant  for 
most  households  because  losses  are  scattered  across  70  villages  in  16  towns  or  townships. 
Only  65  households  with  283  people  will  be  significantly  affected.    The  project’s  resettlement 
impacts have been adequately assessed. 
114.  Resettlement  Policy  Framework  and  Compensation  Rates.  The  objective  of 
resettlement, according to both the PRC laws and regulations and ADB’s SPS, is to achieve at 
least  the  same  or  better  income,  livelihood  and  living  conditions.  Based  on  consultations  with 
the  HCG,  PMO,  implementing  agencies,  PIUs,  local  government  departments,  and  affected 
persons  as  well  as  the  practical  experiences  in  the  project  area,  the  following  principles  of 
resettlement are agreed for the project: 
(i)  Avoid or minimize resettlement, wherever feasible; 
(ii)  Compensation and entitlements provided to the affected persons will be adequate 
to at least maintain their “without project” standard of living, and have prospects of 
improvement; 
(iii)  All affected persons will be provided with resettlement assistance and granted fair 
compensation based on their title status;  
(iv)  Where  post-requisition  cultivated  land  per  capita  is  not  sufficient  to  maintain 
livelihood,  compensation  in  cash  or  kind  for  replacement  land  for  other  income-
generating activities will be provided for the affected persons;  
(v)  All  the  affected  persons  will  be  adequately  informed  on  eligibility,  compensation 
rates  and  standards,  livelihood  and  income  restoration  plans,  project  timing,  and 
will be involved in the resettlement plan implementation process;  
(vi)  No  land  requisition  will  take  place  unless  replacement  land  or  sufficient 
compensation for resettlement is given to the affected persons; 
(vii)  HCG,  PMO,  PIUs  and  an  independent/third  party  will  monitor  compensation  and 
resettlement operations; 
(viii)  Vulnerable groups will receive special assistance to ensure they are better off, so 
that the affected persons listed in the resettlement plan will have the opportunity to 
benefit from the project; 
(ix)  Resettlement plans will be integrated with the overall city/district planning; and 
(x)  The resettlement budget will adequately cover the full aspects of all compensation 
required. 
115.  The LAR compensation policies and standards will follow the Land Administration Law of 
the PRC (2004), Decision of the State Council on Deepening the Reform and Rigidly Enforcing 
Land  Administration  (SC  [2004]  No.28)  (October  21,  2004),  and  other  applicable  guidelines. 
They will also be based on local policies regarding LAR in Henan Province, and ADB’s SPS.  
116.  Compensation  for  acquisition  of  collectively-owned  land  includes  land  compensation, 
resettlement  subsidy,  young  crop  compensation  and  ground  attachment  compensation.  As 
practice in project area, it’s agreed that land compensation will be directly and fully paid to the 
18 The non-civil works of Wetland Park will lease collective-owned land through land use rights transfer system. 
58 
households affected by land acquisition without any amount retained by the village committee or 
group. After compensation, no land will be redistributed in the village or group; if some affected 
households  want  to  obtain  ore  land,  this  can  be  done  through  mutually  agreed  land  transfer. 
Compensation  for  houses,  young  crops,  trees  and  other  associated  facilities  and  impacts  of 
temporary land occupation is directly paid to the affected persons.  
117.  Compensation  for  rural  houses  will  be  made  according  to  the  principle  of  full 
replacement  cost.  All  the  affected  households  opted  to  exchange  their  compensation 
entitlement  for  resettlement  houses  provided  by  local  government  at  subsidized  rates.  The 
relocated  households  will  also  receive  (i)  subsidy  for  temporary  housing  during  the  6  to  12 
month  transition  period, (ii)  moving  allowance,  and (iii)  early  moving reward.  All  compensation 
will be provided in full prior to LAR implementation. 
118.  All affected people are eligible to receive compensation and assistance. The cut-off date 
for certification of such entitlement will be disclosed to all the affected persons immediately after 
it  is  determined  (usually  on  the  date  when the  land  acquisition  announcement  is  published by 
the  government  according  to  the  Land  Administration  Law).  Announcements  are  expected  by 
the end of 2015. 
119.  Resettlement and rehabilitation measures. An evaluation was conducted for the land 
losses  of  affected  villager  groups  and  households.  The  results  show  that  most  affected 
households are not significantly affected (i.e., loss more than 10% of their income source). For 
most,  cash  compensation  will  be  adequate  but  for  some  the  income  restoration  plan  will  be 
subject  to  further  negotiation  and  discussion  with  the  affected  persons,  with  the  findings  and 
results included in the final resettlement plans.  
120. 
In general, the income restoration options include:  
(i)  Agricultural  resettlement  actions.  This  mainly  include  increasing  land  output 
through  crop  improvement  and  land  improvement,  continuing  agricultural  growing 
activities through land transfer;  
(ii)  Non-agricultural  resettlement.  Surplus  labor  arising  from  land  acquisition,  in 
particular,  the  young  and  middle-aged  laborers,  will  be  resettled  through  labor 
transfer  and  reemployment.  Affected  persons  who  choose  to  run  their  own 
business will be provided with financial support in the form of micro-credit loan;  
(iii)  Training  of  agricultural  and  non-agricultural  skills    to  affected  persons  to  enable 
them to develop various skills of making a living; and  
(iv)  Endowment  insurance  provided  to  eligible  farmers  affected  by  land  acquisition  or 
rural-urban  social  welfare  insurance.  The  affected  persons  who  have  been 
engaged in the urban-rural integrated pension program can increase their pay cost 
level  after  they  receive  the  compensation  of  land  acquisition,  and  once  they  get 
employed  in  the  urban area,  they  are  eligible  to join  in  the  urban worker  pension 
program. 
121.  For  house  demolition  and  relocation,  the  eight  affected  households  will  receive 
compensation  entitlements  that  can  be  exchanged  to  purchase  the  resettlement  houses 
provided by  local government at subsidized prices and convenient locations. The resettlement 
building will have five stories and include resettlement houses with four types, namely 65 m2, 90 
m2, 120 m2 and 150 m2. The households affected by house demolition are eligible to purchase 
the resettlement area with the price of 420 CNY/m2 for 30 m2 per capita, and buy the extra area 
with  the  price  of  600  CNY/m2  for  10  m2  per  capita,  as  well  as  obtain  store  area  with  the  cost 
59 
price  of  1,200  CNY/m2  for  10  m2  per  capita.  The  2  affected  small  enterprises,  including  a 
chicken  farm  and  brick  factory  on  leased  land  from  farmers,  will  be  compensated  based  on 
appraised  value  and relocation  assistance. The local  government  will  also assist  the  owner  to 
lease new land to continue its business.  
122.  Resettlement  budget  and  financing  plan.  The  initial  LAR  budget  is  estimated  to  be 
CNY120.075  million.  The  detailed  budget  of  the  resettlement  fund  will  be  updated  upon  the 
finalization of the compensation costs and project design, and included in the final resettlement 
plans.  The  resettlement  fund  will  be  financed  and  paid  by  the  Qibin  District  Government,  Qi 
County Government, and Xun County Government as a part of the total project investment. A 
compensation  agreement  will  be  negotiated  and  entered  into  with  the  village/community 
committees and the affected households during the LAR implementation. On this basis, the final 
cost  will  be  further  updated.  The  local  governments  have  committed  to  timely  implement  the 
RPs, funded by counterpart funds.   
123. 
Institutional  arrangements. The  HCG  is  the  execution  agency  of  the  project  and has 
established  the  Project  Leading  Group  for  ADB-loan  Hebi  Qihe  River  Environmental 
Improvement  and  Ecological  Conservation  Project  (PLG)  to  be  wholly  responsible  for 
comprehensive planning and decision-making for the project. The local governments in related 
counties  and  districts  have  already  established  their  PLGs  for  the  subcomponents  in  their 
administration zone.  
124.  The  HCG  and related  local  governments  have designated  ADB-loan  PMOs  in different 
levels to be responsible for project preparation and management. PMOs will be responsible for 
managing and coordinating the resettlement activities, including payment of compensation. To 
be  specific,  the  Resettlement  and  Social  Affairs  Departments  under  PMOs  will  be  specifically 
responsible  for  preparing  and  managing  the  implementation  of  resettlement  plans,  financial 
payment and internal monitoring. Delegated by PMOs, land management bureaus in the related 
district and counties will be responsible for the specific implementation of LAR, while the towns, 
townships,  and  villages  in  the  project  area  will  provide  assistance  in  the  preparation  and 
implementation of resettlement plans. 
125.  To ensure smooth implementation, the staff in charge of LAR will undertake training on 
resettlement implementation organized by the Hebi PMO. A resettlement start-up consultant will 
provide  training  in  ADB’s  policy  requirements  and  will  assist  the  implementing  agencies  to 
update and finalize their resettlement plans. The resettlement plans will be (i) updated based on 
the final design, detailed measurement survey and census of affected persons, (ii) disclosed to 
affected persons, and (iii) submitted to ADB for review and approval prior to the award of civil 
works contract and commencement of land acquisition or house demolition. 
126.  The resettlement implementation schedule has been prepared based on the preparation 
and construction timetable. The schedule is quite ambitious with LAR implementation starting in 
Q4 2016. This means:  
The resettlement start-up consultant will need to be engaged by October 2015;  
(i) 
(ii)  The external resettlement monitor will need to be engaged by Q3 2016; and 
(iii)  Considerable  preparatory  and  implementation  work  will  need  to  be  carried  out  to 
ensure there is no delay to the planned construction schedules.  
127.  Grievance  Redress  Mechanism.  A  grievance  redress  mechanism  (GRM)  has  been 
developed in compliance with ADB’s SPS (2009) requirement to address environmental, health, 
60 
safety, and social concerns associated with project construction, operation, land acquisition, and 
leasing arrangements. The details of the GRM, including a time-bound flow chart of procedures, 
are  included  in  the  project  EMP  and  resettlement  plans;  the  complaint  channels  are  slightly 
different for environmental and resettlement issues, but the PMOs will maintain and integrated 
system to document, follow-up and reports on all cases.  
128.  Persons  affected  by  LAR,  including  land  transfer,  may  file  an  appeal  on  any  aspect  of 
resettlement,  including  compensation  rates,  etc.  The  means  of  appeal,  and  the  names, 
locations, persons responsible and telephone numbers of the appeal accepting agencies will be 
communicated  to  the  affected  persons  at  a  meeting,  through  an  announcement  or  the 
resettlement information booklet, so that the displaced persons know their right of appeal. Mass 
media  will  be  used  to  strengthen  publicity  and  reporting,  and  comments  and  suggestions  on 
resettlement  from  all  parties  concerned  will  be  shared  by  the  resettlement  organization.  All 
agencies  will  accept  grievances  and  appeals  from  the  affected  people  for  free,  and  costs  so 
reasonably incurred will be disbursed from the contingency costs.  
129.  During  the  design  and  implementation  periods  of  the  project,  these  appeal  procedures 
will remain effective to ensure that the affected people can use them to address relevant issues. 
Affected persons can also submit complaints to ADB  which will first be handled by the project 
team.  If  an  affected  person  is  still  not  satisfied  and  believes  he/she  has  been  harmed  due  to 
non-compliance  with  ADB  policy,  s/he  may  submit  a  complaint  to  ADB’s  Accountability 
Mechanism.19 
130.  Monitoring  and  Evaluation.  A  detailed  plan  for  both  the  internal  and  external 
monitoring  is  included  in  the  resettlement  plans.  PMO  will  include  a  summary  of  internal 
monitoring  in  the  quarterly  project  progress  reports  submitted  to  ADB.  Furthermore,  PMO  will 
employ an external resettlement monitoring institute or firm to monitor and evaluate resettlement 
progress and results. A baseline survey for a sample of affected persons will be completed for 
each resettlement plan before the LAR begins (i.e., before the end of Feb 2016). After that and 
until  project  completion,  semiannual  monitoring  reports  will  be  prepared  and  submitted  for 
ADB’s  review  during  resettlement  implementation  and annually  for  2  years  after  completion of 
resettlement.

VIII.  GENDER AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS 
131.  A poverty and social assessment (PSA) was undertaken during the project preparation 
phase in accordance with ADB guidelines on gender and social dimensions. The PSA included 
a  review  of  primary  data,  a  household  survey,  focus  group  discussions  and  key  informant 
interviews.  The  PSA  assisted  in  the  design  of  the  various  subcomponents  to  ensure  they  are 
social  inclusive and implemented  with a  high  degree  of  community  participation,  especially  for 
the barren hills greening, the wetland rehabilitation and the solid waste management.  
132.  The  project  has  opportunities  to  generate  part-time  and  full-time  employment  during 
construction  and  operation,  particularly  for  women  and  the  poor.  The  project  will  also  have 
public awareness campaigns to promote environmental protection. Communities can also play a 
proactive  role  in  spreading  awareness  and  monitoring  project  achievements,  many  of  which 
depend  upon  changing  peoples’  behaviors,  especially  in  villages.  Based  on  the  PSA,  SDAP, 
GAP,  stakeholder  communication  strategy  (Annex  3),  and  consultation  and  participation  plan 
(Annex  4)  have  been  formulated  and  agreed  by  the  PMO  and  implementing  agencies.  These 
actions  will  be  implemented,  progress  will  be  monitored  and  achievement  of  results  will  be 
measured  and  reported.  The  following  sections  provide  some  further  guidance  for  the 
implementing agencies. 
A. 
Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy 
133.  The project design includes a number of non-structural measures to support and ensure 
the  sustainability  of  the  new  infrastructure  for  environmental  protection,  flood  management, 
wastewater  management  and  solid  waste  management. The  project  areas covers  one district, 
two counties, 16 towns or townships, over 136 urban communities and villages, and will benefit 
an estimated 434,806 people including 138,499 (32.9%) urban residents and 296,307 (68.1%) 
rural  residents.  The  average  poverty  incidence  in  the  projects  area  is  about  5%;  the  project 
components will benefit about 1,326 poor households located in 12 poverty villages (11 in Qibin 
66 
District  and  1  in  Qi  County)  and  about  4,743  poor  urban  households  in  Qibin  Disrtrict  and  Qi 
County  that  currently  received  minimum  living  standard  subsidies  or  pensions.  For  the 
subcomponents  located  in  rural  areas,  they  is  good  potential  for  women  and  the  poor  to 
participate  in  projects  activities,  because  they  have  more  spare  time  and  seek  income 
generation opportunities that are close to their villages.  
134.  The  project  will  pose  few  adverse  impacts,  such  as  the  construction  disturbance  and 
some  LAR.  These  impacts  have  been  adequately  addressed  in  the  EMP  and  resettlement 
plans.  There  are  some  potential  risks  which  need  to  be  mitigated,  such  as  labor  issues  and 
communicable diseases,  but  these  are  considered as low  risks  because the  local  government 
has good policies and practices for labor standards and awareness on communicable disease. 
Nonetheless, the bidding documents include standard clauses for PIUs and project contractors 
to comply with the local regulations and to train their staff and contract workers so they are fully 
aware of such risks, local regulations and their entitlements. 
135.  The project has also conducted an affordability analysis for the provision of wastewater 
and solid waste services to urban and rural people. The analysis concluded that the connection 
fees and service tariffs are affordable for low income households and the very poor will receive 
subsidies to ensure universal access to improved sanitation. However, the willingness to pay in 
rural areas is still quite low, so awareness campaigns are planned to address this issue. Also, 
many  households  in  the  semi-urban  areas  do  not  have  sanitation  facilities  that  can  be 
connected  to  the  sewer  network.  So  many  households  may  continue  to  use  pit  latrines  and 
discharge wastewater into the street, which will then be collected by the combined drainage and 
sewer mains. 
B. 
Gender Action Plan 
136.  A  GAP  has  been  prepared  to  ensure  this  project  is  socially  inclusive  for  women  and 
measures  are  taken  to proactive  support  gender  mainstreaming.  As  concluded  from  the  PSA, 
this project has many opportunities to not only benefit women but also to raise their status and 
role  in  environmental  protection  and  improved  sanitary  condition  that  will  benefit  the  entire 
community.  Therefore,  ADB  has  categorized  this  project  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming 
(EGM)  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  Policy  on  Gender  and  Development  (1998)  which  adopted 
mainstreaming  as  a key  strategy  in promoting gender  equity. Women  can  either  be  employed 
full-time or earn additional income through part-time employment in construction and operation 
activities. To achieve these gender mainstreaming, actions have been formulated which will be 
implemented  by  the  PIUs  and  contractors.  Details  on  proposed  actions,  target  groups, 
implementing  agencies,  timing,  funding  source,  and  monitoring  indicators,  are  included  in  the 
GAP. 
137.  The PIUs will be assisted by the social, gender and community participation consultant 
(10 person-month of intermittent inputs over 4 years) to (i) implement the GAP, (ii) improve the 
GAP  as  needed  to  ensure  it  is  practical  and  effective,  and  (iii)  to  monitor  and  report  on  the 
progress  of  actions  and  the  achievement  or  the  results  and  targets.  Reports  will  be  prepared 
semiannually  and  will  be  appended  to  the  project  progress  reports  submitted  to  ADB.  The 
gender  targets  have  been  included  in  the  Design  and  Monitoring  Framework  (DMF)  which 
ensure the gender actions are closely monitored as part of the PPMS. Also, implementation of 
the GAP to achieve targeted outcomes is included in the loan assurances.

Social Development Action Plan 
138.  Similar  to  the  GAP,  the  SDAP  (Annex  1)  has  been  prepared  to  ensure  this  project  is 
socially  inclusive  for  the  poor  and  other  vulnerable  groups  (including  children,  the  elderly  and 
other  groups)  and  that  social  risks  are  prevented  or  adequately  mitigated.  Based  on  the  PSA 
results, actions have been formulated which will be implemented by the PIUs and contractors. 
Details on proposed actions, target groups, implementing agencies, timing, funding source, and 
monitoring indicators, are included in the SDAP.  
139.  The SDAP focuses on issues related to directly affected people, vulnerable people, and 
local social and agricultural development. The main actions can be grouped into three types: (i) 
for  structure  components  in  Outputs  1,  2  and  3,  the  project  benefits  enhancement  measures 
such as employment promotion and social risks mitigation measures such as pro-poor activities 
will be within the direct control of the implementing agencies; (ii) for non-structure components, 
public awareness activities and campaigns will be organized in the subproject areas each year, 
being the responsibility of  the HPMO, subproject PIUs and the implementing agencies; and (iii) 
for  capacity  building  components  in  Output  4,  training,  meetings,  consultations,  case  studies, 
workshops and seminars on decision making, ADB project management procedures,  technical 
design  and  implementation,  safeguard  supervision  and  monitoring,  implementation  of  LAR, 
public awareness and consultation capacity enhancement will be arranged by HPMO. There is 
also an activity to enable the Hui People in Nanguan Village in Xi County to contribute to public 
awareness and improved sanitation conditions.  
140.  The PIUs will be assisted by the social, gender and community participation consultant 
to (i) implement the SDAP, (ii) improve the SDAP as needed, and (iii) to monitor and report on 
the  progress  of  actions  and  the  achievement  or  the  results.  Reports  will  be  prepared 
semiannually  and  will  be  appended  to  the  project  progress  reports  submitted  to  ADB.  A 
combined social  and gender  report  may  be  prepared. Implementation  of the  SDAP  to  achieve 
expected results is included in the loan assurances. The SDAP is provided in Annex 1. 
141.  Details  on  proposed  actions,  target  groups,  implementing  agencies,  timing,  funding

Monitoring 
1. 
Project Performance Monitoring 
142.  At  the  beginning  of  the  project  implementation  stage,  the  Hebi  PMO  will  develop  a 
project  performance  management  system  (PPMS)  to  monitor  the  progress  of  the  project  in 
achieving  the  planned  outcome  and  outputs.   The PPMS  will  be  developed with assistance of 
the project implementation management consultant as one of its work tasks in accordance with 
ADB’s policy requirements, including baseline setting, operational data collection, data analysis, 
and reporting.  
143.  The  PPMS  will  adopt  indicators  relating  to  the  following  aspects  of  the  project:  (i) 
physical  progress  of  subproject  implementation;  (ii)  financial  progress,  (ii)  improvement  in 
ecological  conditions  of the  upper  Qihe  River  basin,  (iii)  improvement  in lower  Qihe  River  and 
tributary watercourses; (iv) improvement in wastewater collection and treatment in Qibin District 
and  Qi  County;  (v)  improvement  in  rural  and  urban  solid  waste  management  in  Qibin  District 
and  Qi  County;  (vi)  Results  of  capacity  development  program;  and  (vii)  social  and  poverty 
development.    The  PMO  will  assign  staff,  or  contract  consultants,  to  collect  baseline  and 
progress  data  at  the  requisite  time  intervals  to  be  used  in  the  PPMS.  The  PMO  will  be 
responsible  for  analyzing  and  consolidating  reported  data,  and  reporting  outcomes  to  ADB 
through semiannual progress reports. 
2. 
Compliance Monitoring 
144.  During project implementation, ADB and the PMO will closely monitor the compliance of 
all  the  covenants  under  the  project  and  will  take  necessary  remedial  actions  for  any 
noncompliance. The compliance status will be reported  in  the  semiannual  progress  report  by  
the PMO  and will  be  reviewed  during  project review missions. 
3. 
Legal Covenants 
145.  HCG  shall  ensure  that  in  the  event  of  (i)  any  change  in  ownership  or  control  of  the 
project  facilities;  or  (ii)  any  sale,  transfer,  or  assignment  of  the  shares  of  PIUs  is  anticipated, 
HCG will consult with ADB at least 6 months prior to the implementation of such change. HCG 
shall cause PIUs to further ensure that such changes are carried out in a lawful and transparent 
manner. 
4. 
Financial Covenants 
146.  Counterpart funding. The TA will request HCG to provide the details of the sources of 
the  counterpart  funding  as  well  as  provide  corresponding  commitment  letters.  The  total  cost 
includes physical and price contingencies, interest during construction. 
147.  Financial  management.  The  HCG  shalll  establish  and  maintain  sound  financial 
management systems in accordance with ADB’s Guidelines on the Financial Management and 
Analysis  of  Projects,  including  the  establishment  of  separate  project  accounts  and  the 
maintenance  of  minimum  balances  to  ensure  smooth  cash  flow  and  the  timely  settlement  of 
project construction liabilities and future debt servicing. 
75 
5. 
Governance and anticorruption 
148.  ADB’s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  were  explained  to  and 
discussed  with  the  HCG  and  implementing  agencies.  Specific  policy  requirements  and 
supplementary measures will be described in the project administration manual. 
6. 
Safeguards monitoring  
a)  
Environment 
149.  The  project  monitoring  program  focuses  on  the  environment  in  the  project  areas  of 
influence in the project counties and districts. The environmental monitoring program is in Table 
EMP-4  of  the  project  EMP,  including  parameters,  time  and  frequency,  implementing  and 
supervising agencies, and estimated costs. Three types of project environmental monitoring will 
be conducted under the EMP: (i) internal monitoring and supervision and reporting by CSCs and 
PIUs;  (ii)  EMP  implementation  monitoring  and  progress  reporting  by  the  LIEC;  and  (iii) 
compliance monitoring by local EMS. The monitoring program covers the scope of monitoring, 
parameters, time and frequency, implementing and supervising agencies, and estimated costs. 
Monitoring shall comply with the relevant national standards. 
Internal  monitoring  and  supervision  and  reporting  by  CSCs.  During  construction, 
150. 
the  CSCs  and  PIUs  will  be  responsible  for  conducting  internal  environmental  monitoring  in 
accordance with the monitoring and reporting plans. Supervision results will be reported through 
the CSC reports to the PIUs.  
151.  EMP  implementation  monitoring  and  progress  reporting.  The  LIEC  will  review 
project  progress  and  compliance  with  the  EMP  based  on  field  visits,  and  the  review  of  the 
environmental  monitoring  conducted  by  the  EMS.  The findings  of  the  LIEC  will  be  reported  to 
ADB through the semiannual EMP monitoring and progress reports. The reports will include (i) 
progress  made  in  EMP  implementation,  (ii)  overall  effectiveness  of  the  EMP  implementation 
(including  public  and  occupational  health  and  safety),  (iii)  environmental  monitoring  and 
compliance, (iv) institutional strengthening and training, (v) public consultation (including GRM), 
and  (vi)  any  problems  encountered  during  construction  and  operation,  and  the  relevant 
corrective  actions  undertaken.  The  LIEC  will  help  PMO  prepare  the  reports  and  submit  the 
English report to ADB for appraisal and disclosure.  
152.  Environmental  compliance  monitoring  by  local  EMS.  The  PIUs  in  each  county  or 
district will contract the local EMS to conduct environmental monitoring in accordance with the 
monitoring  program.  A  detailed  cost  estimate  will  be  provided  by  the  EMS  prior  to 
implementation.  Monitoring  will  be  conducted  during  construction  and operation  period,  until  a 
project  completion  report  (PCR)  is  issued.  Semiannual  monitoring  reports  will  be  prepared  by 
the EMSs and submitted to PMO and the PIUs.  
153.  Quality assurance (QA) /quality control (QC) for compliance monitoring. To ensure 
accuracy  of  the  monitoring,  the  QA/QC  procedures  will  be  conducted  in  accordance  with  the 
following regulations:  
(i)  Regulations  of  QA/AC  Management  for  Environmental  Monitoring  issued  by  the 
State Environmental Protection Administration in July 2006;  
(ii)  QA/QC Manual for Environmental Water Monitoring (Second edition), published by 
the State Environmental Monitoring Centre in 2001; and  
76 
(iii)  QA/QC  Manual 
for  Environmental  Air  Monitoring  published  by 
the  State 
Environmental Monitoring Centre in 2001. 
154.  Project  completion  environmental  audits.  Upon  completion  of  each  subproject, 
environmental  acceptance  monitoring  and  audit  reports  shall  be  (i)  prepared  by  a  licensed 
environmental  monitoring  institute  in  accordance  with  the  PRC’s  Guideline  on  Project 
Completion  Environmental  Audit  (2001),  (ii)  reviewed  for  approval  by  the  environmental 
authorities,  and  (iii)  reported  to  ADB  through  the  semiannual  progress  reports.  Subproject 
completion  reports  shall  be  finalized  within  3  months  after  each  subproject  completion,  or  no 
later than 1 year with permission of the local environment protection bureaus.  
b)  
Land Acquisition and Resettlement 
155.  The  PMO  will  submit  an  internal  monitoring  report  semiannually  to  ADB.  Furthermore, 
the  PMO  will  employ  an  external  resettlement  monitoring  institute  or  firm  to  establish  an 
independent  external  monitoring  organization  in  order  to  deliver  a  truly  independent  and 
unbiased  external  monitoring  report.  Internal  and  external  monitoring  of  resettlement  plan 
implementation  will  be  conducted.  Monitoring  methodologies  are  specified  in  the  resettlement 
plans.  A  detailed  plan  for  both  the  internal  and  external  monitoring  and  evaluation  (M&E)  is 
included  in  the  resettlement  plans.  The  PPMS  included  indicators  on  resettlement  plan 
monitoring, and the required frequencies.  
156.  An external monitoring agency acceptable to ADB will be engaged by January 2016 prior 
to commencement  of  land  acquisition. The  external  monitoring  agency will  prepare  a baseline 
study,  and  implement  external  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  resettlement plan  implementation. 
Semiannual  external  monitoring  reports  will  be  prepared  and  submitted  to  ADB  during 
resettlement  plan  implementation,  and  annual  evaluation  reports  will  be  forwarded  directly  to 
both the PMO and ADB for 2 years after conclusion of resettlement plan implementation. 
7. 
Gender and Social Dimensions Monitoring 
a)  
Gender Action Plan monitoring  
157.  Monitoring and evaluation of the gender action plan will be incorporated into the overall 
monitoring  and  evaluation  plan  for  the  project.  Monitoring  indicators  for  the  GAP  and  SDAP 
were  incorporated  into  the  PPMS.  The  implementing  agencies  will  be  responsible  for 
establishing and coordinating regular monitoring and evaluation.  
158.  ADB  staff  with  expertise  in  gender  issues  will  participate  in  the  midterm  review.  The 
social  and  gender  development  expert  will  work  with  PMO  and  implementing  agency  staff  to 
create  a  detailed  implementation  and  monitoring  plan  for  each  of  the  tasks  outlined,  help  to 
complete  the  first  gender  action  plan  implementation  progress  report,  and  review  the  second  
report  prepared  by  the  implementing  agencies.  The  firm  or  institute  which  engaged  to  as  the 
independent  external  resettlement  and  social  monitor  will  review  and provide  guidance  on  the 
semiannual implementation progress reports.  
159.  The regular project progress reports to ADB will include, at least semiannually, reporting 
on  those  indicators.  Assistance  will  be  provided  for  the  executing  agency  and  implementing 
agencies by the resettlement and social development consultant who will help to set up effective 
monitoring  systems  and  work  with  the  focal  points  and  implementing  agencies  to  ensure 
implementation  of  the  GAP,  and  SDAP.  The  project’s  social,  gender  and  community 
participation specialist will assist the PMO to collect data for qualitative  analysis to assess the 
77 
effectiveness of the GAP benefiting women beneficiaries at the project end. This will include an 
end-of-project survey of a small number of sample beneficiaries and/or focus group discussions 
(FGDs)  with  female  beneficiaries  to  obtain  qualitative  information  on  the  improvements  to 
women’s lives as a result of the project. Questions could include - Has your income improved? 
What  did  you  do  with  the  increased  funds  you  received?  How  has  your  life  improved?  Have 
there  been  strategic  changes in your  community  or  household relationships e.g., respect from 
your husband? Mother in-law etc.? 
b)  
Social Development Action Plan Monitoring 
160. 
It  is  proposed  that  comprehensive  monitoring  be  conducted  during  project  construction 
to ensure that the project fulfils its aims and objectives. The HPMO will be responsible for the 
monitoring and evaluation, and for reporting  SDAP progress and achievements to ADB during 
project implementation. The SDAP monitoring report will be part of the project progress report. 
The  social  and  gender  specialist  will  support  the  HPMO  to  prepare  the  monitoring  and 
evaluation report. 
C. 
Evaluation 
161. 
In  addition  to  regular  monitoring,  project  performance  will  be  reviewed  at  least  once  a 
year  jointly  by  ADB  and  HCG.  The  review  will  assess  implementation  performance  and 
achievement  of  project  outcomes  and  outputs,  assess  financial  progress,  identify  issues  and 
constraints affecting implementation, and work out a time-bound action plan for their resolution. 
ADB  and  HCG  will  undertake  a  midterm  review  to  assess  implementation  status  and  take 
appropriate measures - including modification of scope and implementation arrangements, and 
reallocation  of  loan  proceeds,  as  appropriate  -  to  achieve  the  project  impact  and  outcome. 
Within  3  months  of  physical  completion  of  the  project,  HCG  will  submit  a  project  completion 
report to ADB. 
D. 
Reporting 
162.  HCG  will  provide  ADB  with  (i)  quarterly  progress  reports  in  a  format  consistent  with 
ADB's  project  performance  reporting  system;  (ii)  consolidated  annual  reports  including  (a) 
progress achieved by output as measured through the indicator's performance targets, (b) key 
implementation  issues  and  solutions;  (c)  updated  procurement  plan  and  (d)  updated 
implementation plan for next 12 months; and (iii) a project completion report within 6 months of 
physical  completion  of  the  project.  To  ensure  projects  continue  to  be  both  viable  and 
sustainable,  project  accounts  and  the  executing  agency  AFSs,  together  with  the  associated 
auditor's report, should be adequately reviewed. 
163.  Within 6 months after project completion, the PMO will prepare, in coordination with the 
PIUs and HCG, and submit to ADB a PCR evaluating the performance of the PMO and PIUs; 
and summarizing the loan funds utilization, project implementation, attainment of project impact, 
outcome,  and outputs,  implementation experience,  project  performance,  actual  costs  incurred, 
benefits,  and  other  information  requested  by  ADB,  and  assessing  the  accomplishment  of  the 
purposes of the loan.   
E. 
Stakeholder Communication Strategy 
164.  Relevant project information, including implementation progress, will be disclosed in the 
ADB  website  and  at  the  PMO.  This  may  include  the  design  and  monitoring  framework,  the 
78 
environmental  assessment,  and  the  EMP.  Stakeholder  workshops  will  be  held  throughout 
project  implementation  to  encourage  key  stakeholders,  particularly  workers  and  residents  in 
project areas, to participate in achieving the project benefits and to make sure all stakeholders, 
including women, poor and other vulnerable groups, benefit from the project. 
165.  A Stakeholder Communication Strategy (SCS) has been prepared as required by ADB to 
ensure inclusiveness, transparency, and meaningful participation of concerned stakeholders for 
the  Henan  Hebi  River  Environmental  Improvement  and  Ecological  Conservation  Project.  It 
provides  an  agreed  communication  platform  for  key  stakeholders  particularly  between  the 
project’s  affected  groups  and  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies;  ensure  that  the 
stakeholders’ views and interests are fully integrated into the project design, implementation and 
operation.  Specifically,  the  SCS  could  help  in  ensuring  a  regular  flow  of  reliable  project 
information  and  inclusion  of  vulnerable  groups  in  the  distribution  of  project  benefits  during 
project  implementation  and  operation.  The  community  communication  strategy  matrix  outlines 
and/or  identifies key  messages,  means  of  communication,  and  timeline  of  delivery  for  various 
stakeholders during the project cycle. The SCS is provided in Annex 3. 
166.  A  Consultation  and  Participation  Plan  (C&PP)  has  been  prepared  for  the  concerned 
stakeholders  within  the  project  areas  as  required  by  ADB  to  ensure  social  inclusion.  The 
purpose  of  this  plan  is  to  engage  the  stakeholders  in  meaningful  consultation  and  decision-
making process; inform them about the project and consult them on various issues relevant to 
the  project/subcomponents  and  activities  during  project  design  and 
implementation. 
Consultation and participation serve venue for the key stakeholders (i.e., government agencies, 
project  beneficiaries,  women,  etc.)  to  be  informed  about  the  project,  clarify  and  express 
feedbacks,  issues  and  concerns,  and  suggestion;  learn  how  they  will  be  benefited  by  the 
projects;  participate  in  decision-making  and  take  action  and/or  be  involved  during  the  design, 
project implementation and operation/maintenance stages. The C&PP is provided in Annex 4.  
X. 
ANTICORRUPTION POLICY  
167.  ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any violations of the 
Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date)  relating to the project. All contracts financed 
by  ADB  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records 
and  accounts  of  the  executing  agency  and  all  project  contractors,  suppliers,  consultants  and 
other service providers. Individuals/entities on ADB’s anticorruption debarment list are ineligible 
to  participate  in  ADB-financed  activity  and  may  not  be  awarded  any  contracts  under  the 
project.23  
168.  To support these efforts, relevant provisions are included in the loan agreement and the 
bidding documents for the project. 
XI. 
ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISM 
169.  People  who are, or may in the future be, adversely affected by the project may submit 
complaints  to  ADB’s  Accountability  Mechanism.  The  Accountability  Mechanism  provides  an 
independent  forum  and  process  whereby  people  adversely  affected  by  ADB-assisted  projects 
can voice, and seek a resolution of their problems, as well as report alleged violations of ADB’s 
operational  policies  and  procedures.  Before  submitting  a  complaint  to  the  Accountability 
23  ADB's Integrity Office web site is available at: http://www.adb.org/integrity/unit.asp 
79 
Mechanism, affected people should make a good faith effort to solve their problems by working 
with  the  concerned  ADB  operations  department.  Only  after  doing  that,  and  if  they  are  still 
dissatisfied, should they approach the Accountability Mechanism.24 
XII.

herein  do  not  necessarily  represent  those  of  ADB's  Board  of  Directors,  Management,  or  staff, 
and may be preliminary in nature. Your attention is directed to the “terms of use” section of the 
ADB website in which the full environmental impact assessment is given. 
In  preparing  any  country  program  or  strategy,  financing  any  project,  or  by  making  any 
designation  of  or  reference  to  a  particular  territory  or  geographic  area  in  this  document,  the 
Asian Development Bank does not intend to make any judgments as to the legal or other status 
of any territory or area. 
84 
Annex 2 
A.  Objectives 
1. 
This  Environmental  Management  Plan  (EMP)  is  for  the  Henan  Hebi  Qihe  River 
Environmental  Improvement  and  Ecological  Conservation  Project  in  Hebi  City  of  Henan 
Province,  the  People’s  Republic  of  China  (PRC).  The  EMP  complies  with  the  Asian 
Development  Bank’s  (ADB)  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (SPS,  2009)  and  is  based  on  the 
domestic  Environmental  Impact  Assessments  (DEIAs)  prepared  by  Beijing  Zhonghuan 
Guohong  Environment  and  Resource  Technology  Limited  Company  and  project  EIA.  The 
EMP  describes:  roles  and  responsibilities  of  all  project  agencies  to  implement  this  EMP; 
mitigation  measures;  inspection,  monitoring,  and  reporting  arrangements;  training  and 
institutional  strengthening;  grievance  redress  mechanism  (GRM);  and 
future  public 
consultation.  
2. 
In  the  design  stage  the  PMO  will  pass  this  EMP  to  the  design  institutes  for 
incorporating mitigation measures into the detailed designs. The EMP will be updated at the 
end  of  the  detailed  design,  as  needed.  To  ensure  that  bidders  will  respond  to  the  EMP’s 
provisions, the PMO and local project implementation units (PIUs) will prepare and provide 
the  following  specification  clauses  for  incorporation  into  the  bidding  documents:  (i)  a  list  of 
environmental management requirements to be budgeted by the bidders in their proposals, 
(ii)  environmental  clauses for  contractual terms  and  conditions,  and (iii)  component  DEIAs, 
and project EIA including updated EMP for compliance. 
B.  Organizations and Their Responsibilities for EMP Implementation 
Hebi  City  Government  (HCG)  is  the  project  Executing  Agency  (EA).  A  Project 
3. 
Leading Group (PLG) and a Project Management Office (PMO) have been established in the 
HCG. The PLG is chaired by the executive vice mayor of HCG, with members from the Hebi 
City  Government,  Hebi  Finance  Bureau,  Hebi  Development  and  Reform  Commission,  and 
other  relevant  agencies.  The  PMO  is  located  in  the  Hebi  Finance  Bureau  and  comprises 
staff  and  representatives 
the  relevant  government  departments.  Qi  County 
Government, Qibin District Government  and Xun  County Government  will  be Implementing 
Agencies (IAs) 
from 
4. 
HCG (through PMO) and the IAs (through the PIUs) will assume overall responsibility 
for  implementing,  supervising,  monitoring  and  reporting  on  the  EMP.  Their  capacity  to 
implement the EMP, as well as the capacity of the PIUs to manage project facilities, will be 
strengthened through capacity building and training activities defined in the EMP.

Table  EMP-3  lists  the  potential  project  impacts  and  mitigation  measures  during  the 
pre-construction,  construction  and  operational  phases.  Those  that  will  be  permanently 
become  part  of  the  infrastructure  such  as  noise  reduction  materials  and  odor  removal 
facilities for the wastewater treatment plant will be included in the design of the facilities by 
the  contracted  design  institute.  The  costs  of  building  and  maintaining  these  systems  have 
already  been  included  in  the  infrastructure  construction  and  operating  costs  and  therefore 
will not be double-counted as part of the EMP costs. 
11. 
Those  mitigation  measures  that  are  temporary  measures  particularly  during  the 
construction  stage,  such  as  dust  suppression  by  watering  and  wheel  washing,  the  use  of 
quiet and low-powered mechanical equipment and temporary noise barriers will need to be 
included in the tender documents. Contractors will be required to include the EMP in their bid 
packages to satisfy the environmental contract clauses for implementing the EMP.

D.  Monitoring and Reporting 
12. 
Three types of project environmental monitoring will be conducted under the EMP: (i) 
internal  monitoring  and  supervision  and  reporting  by  CSCs  and  PIUs;  (ii)  EMP 
implementation  monitoring  and  progress  reporting  by  the  LIEC;  and  (iii)  compliance 
monitoring  by  local  EMS.  The  monitoring  program  (Table  EMP-4)  covers  the  scope  of 
monitoring,  parameters,  time  and  frequency,  implementing  and  supervising  agencies,  and 
estimated costs. Monitoring shall comply with the relevant national standards. 
13. 
Internal monitoring and supervision and reporting by CSCs. During construction, 
the  CSCs  and PIUs  will  be  responsible for  conducting internal  environmental  monitoring  in 
accordance with the monitoring and reporting plans (Tables EMP-4 and EMP-5). Supervision 
results will be reported through the CSC reports to the PIUs.  
14. 
EMP  implementation  monitoring  and  progress  reporting.  The  LIEC  will  review 
project  progress  and  compliance  with  the  EMP  based  on  field  visits,  and  the  review  of  the 
environmental monitoring conducted by the EMS. The findings of the LIEC will be reported to 
ADB through the semiannual EMP monitoring and progress reports. The reports will include 
(i)  progress  made 
the  EMP 
implementation  (including  public  and  occupational  health  and  safety),  (iii)  environmental 
training,  (v)  public 
monitoring  and  compliance,  (iv) 
consultation  (including  GRM),  and  (vi)  any  problems  encountered  during  construction  and 
operation, and the relevant corrective actions undertaken. The LIEC will help PMO prepare 
the reports and submit the English report to ADB for appraisal and disclosure.  
implementation,  (ii)  overall  effectiveness  of 
institutional  strengthening  and

15. 
Environmental compliance monitoring by local EMS. The PIUs in each county or 
district  will  contract the  local  EMS  to  conduct  environmental  monitoring  in accordance  with 
the monitoring program (Table EMP-4). A detailed cost estimate will be provided by the EMS 
prior  to  implementation.  Monitoring  will  be  conducted  during  construction  and  operation 
period, until a project completion report (PCR) is issued. Semiannual monitoring reports will 
be prepared by the EMSs and submitted to PMO and the PIUs.  
Project  completion  environmental  audits.  Upon  completion  of  each  subproject, 
16. 
environmental  acceptance  monitoring  and  audit  reports  shall  be  (i)  prepared  by  a  licensed 
environmental  monitoring  institute  in  accordance  with  the  PRC’s  Guideline  on  Project 
Completion  Environmental  Audit  (2001),  (ii)  reviewed  for  approval  by  the  environmental 
authorities,  and  (iii)  reported  to ADB  through  the  semiannual  progress  reports.  Subproject 
completion reports shall be finalized within 3 months after each subproject completion, or no 
later than 1 year with permission of the local environment protection bureaus.  
Quality  assurance  (QA)  /quality  control  (QC)  for  compliance  monitoring.  To 
17. 
ensure accuracy of the monitoring, QA/QC procedures will be conducted in accordance with 
the following regulations:  
i)  Regulations  of  QA/AC  Management  for  Environmental  Monitoring  issued  by  the 
State Environmental Protection Administration in July 2006;  
ii)  QA/QC  Manual  for  Environmental Water  Monitoring  (Second  edition),  published

19. 
The  project  agencies  have  no  previous  experience  with  ADB-funded  projects  or 
safeguard requirements. To ensure effective implementation of the EMP, the capacity of PMO, 
PIUs,  O&M  Units,  contractors,  CSCs,  and  local  bureaus  (especially  forestry  and  water 
resources)  will  be  strengthened. The  project  will  implement  institutional  capacity  building,  and 
training, as follows: 
98 
Annex 2 
(i)  Appointment of PMO and PIU Environment Officers and Social Officers; 
(ii)  Contracting of a wetland specialist and river specialist to support detailed design 
and implementation; 
(iii)  Contracting of a LIEC to support the PMO and PIUs with EMP implementation and 
ensure compliance with ADB’s Safeguard Policy Statement (SPS, 2009); and,

G.  Grievance Redress Mechanism 
21. 
A project-specific grievance redress mechanism (GRM) has been established to receive 
and manage any public environmental and/or social issues which may arise due to the project. 
This complements the  PRC’s  national  environmental  complaint  hotline  (12369). The  PMO  and 
PIU Environment Officers and Social Officers will coordinate the GRM. All project agencies and 
staff  will  be  trained  in  the  GRM  and  will  take  an  active  role  in  supporting  the  GRM  when 
necessary. 
At  the  PMO  level,  the  PMO  Environment  Officers  and  Social  Officers  will  establish  a 
22. 
GRM  tracking  and  documentation  system,  conduct  daily  coordination  with  the  PIU  officers, 
arrange  meetings  and  conduct  site  visits  as  necessary,  maintain  the  overall  project  GRM 
database,  and  prepare  the  reporting  inputs  for  progress  reports  to ADB. At  the  PIU  level,  the 
environment and social officers will instruct the contractors and CSCs on the GRM procedures, 
and coordinate with the county EPBs and other government divisions as necessary. PMO and 
PIU staff will be trained and supported by the LIEC.  
The  contact  persons  for  different  GRM  entry  points,  such  as  the  PMO  and  PIU 
23. 
Environmental  Officers  and  Social  Officers,  contractors,  operators  of  project  facilities  (OPFs), 
and county EPBs, will be identified prior to construction. The contact details for the entry points 
(phone numbers, addresses, e-mail addresses) will be publicly disclosed on information boards 
at construction sites and on the websites of the PMO and county EPBs.  
24. 
Once  a  complaint  is  received  and  filed,  the  PMO  and  PIU  officers  will  identify  if 
100 
Annex 2 
complaints are eligible. Eligible complaints include those where (i) the complaint pertains to the 
project; and (ii) the issues arising in the complaint fall within the scope of environmental issues 
that  the  GRM  is  authorized  to  address.  Ineligible  complaints  include  those  where:  (i)  the 
complaint is clearly not project-related; (ii) the nature of the issue is outside the mandate of the 
environmental GRM (such as issues related to resettlement, allegations of fraud or corruption); 
and  (iii)  other  procedures  are  more  appropriate  to  address  the  issue.  Ineligible  complaints  will 
be recorded and passed to the relevant authorities, and the complainant will be informed of the 
decision and reasons for rejection. The procedure and timeframe for the GRM is as follows and 
also summarized in Figure EMP-1.  
  Stage  1  (5  days):  If  a  concern  arises  during  construction,  the  affected  person  may 
submit  a  written  or  oral  complaint  to the  contractor. Whenever  possible,  the  contractor 
will resolve the issue directly with the affected person. The contractor shall give a clear 
reply  within  five  (5)  working  days. The  contractor  will  keep the  PIU fully  informed  at  all 
stages. 
  Stage  2  (5  days):  If  the  issue  cannot  be  resolved  in  Stage  1,  after  five  days,  the  PIU 
and/or PMO will take over responsibility. Eligibility of the complaint will be assessed and 
a recommended solution given to the complainant and contractors within five (5) working 
days.  If  the  solution  is  agreed  by  the  complainant,  the  contractors  and/or  facility 
operators will implement the solution within seven days. Written records will be made of 
all stages and outcomes. 
  Stage 3 (10  days):  If  no solution can  be  identified  by  the  PMO  and/or PIU,  and/or the 
complainant  is  not  satisfied  with  the  proposed  solution,  the  PMO  and/or  PIU  will 
organize,  within  ten  (10)  days,  a  stakeholder  meeting  (including  the  complainant, 
contractor and/or operator of the facility, county EPB, PIU, PMO). A solution acceptable 
to all shall be identified including clear steps. The contractors (during construction) and 
facility  operators  (during  operation)  will  immediately  implement  the  agreed  solution. 
Written records will be made of all stages and outcomes. 
25. 
The  GRM  does  not  affect  the  right  of  an  affected  person  to  submit  their  complaints  to 
any  agency  they  wish  to,  for  example  the  local  village  committee,  community  leaders,  courts, 
PMO, PIU, and/or Asian Development Bank. 
The  PMO  and  PIUs  shall  bear  any  and  all  costs  of  implementing  the  GRM,  including 
26. 
meeting, travel,  and/or  accommodation  costs  of the  project staff or  affected  person. The GRM 
will  be  implemented  throughout  project  construction  and  at  least  the  first  year  of  operation  for 
each project facility.

Based  on  environmental  inspection  and  monitoring  reports,  the  PMO  and  PIUs  shall 
decide,  in  consultation  with  the  LIEC,  whether  (i)  further  mitigation  measures  are  required  as 
corrective  actions,  or  (ii)  some  improvements  are  required  for  environmental  management 
practices. The effectiveness of mitigation measures and monitoring plans will be evaluated by a 
feedback  reporting  system.  Adjustment  to  the  EMP  will  be  made,  if  necessary.  The  PMO 
Environmental Officers will play a critical role in the feedback and adjustment mechanism. 
30. 
If during inspection, substantial deviation from the EMP is observed or any changes are 
made to the project that may cause substantial adverse environmental impacts or increase the 
number of affected people, then the PMO and PIUs will immediately consult with ADB and form 
an  environmental  assessment  team  to  conduct  additional  environmental  assessment.  If 
necessary, further public consultation will be undertaken. The revised domestic EIAs and project 
EIA,  including  this  EMP,  will  be  submitted  to  the  ADB  for  review,  appraisal,  and  public 
disclosure.  The  revised  EMP  will  be  passed  to  the  contractors,  CSCs  and  OPFs  for 
implementation.

26.  Working closely with the PMO and PIU environmental officers, design institutes, wetland 
ecologist  and  other  loan  implementation  consultants,  and  other  stakeholders  as  relevant,  the 
specialist will do the following.  
(i)  Clarify and establish the specific objectives of the long-term ecological monitoring 
program, including: (a) to measure the ecological health of the Qihe River in Hebi 
City; and (b) to measure progress of the project activities for wetland conservation 
and species protection in the pilot Qihe River National Wetland Park (NWP). 
Identify  the  specific  variables  to  be  monitored,  which  may  include:  (a)  within  the 
NWP  –  Qihe  River  Crucian  Carp,  Wild  Soybean,  migratory  waterbirds,  wetland 
vegetation restored by the project; (b) Qihe River in the entire project area – water 
quality, hydrology.  
(ii) 
(iii)  Describe existing HCG activities and arrangements for ecological and hydrological 
monitoring along the Qihe River, including within the NWP, including the locations 
of existing hydrological monitoring stations. 
(iv)  For  parameters  which are  already  subject  to some  monitoring  (e.g.  water  quality, 
hydrology),  assess  current  strengths,  weaknesses  and  opportunities.  If  existing 
arrangements  are  sufficient  for  the  program  objectives,  assess  and  facilitate  the 
integration of these into the program (or vice versa). 
(v)  For  new  and/or  existing  parameters,  develop  the  monitoring  methods,  frequency, 
training needs, and equipment. 
(vi)  Work with the wetland ecologist to identify and design the parameters for the NWP. 
(vii)  Design  the  monitoring  program  and  methods  for  each  parameter  to  be:  (a)  as 
simple as possible; and (b) requiring as little specialist equipment as possible. 
110 
Annex 2 
(viii)  Prepare field data collection template forms for each parameter. 
(ix)  Prepare  a  series  of  specific,  simple,  and  direct  questions  to  be  answered  by  the 
results  of  long-term  monitoring.  These  will  help  guide  implementing  agencies  to 
prepare progress reports based on the monitoring data. 
(x)  Work  with  the  HCG  agencies  that  are  developing  the  Qihe  River  Management 
Information System (MIS) to be established by the project, in order to: (a) ensure 
that data is collected in a format that can be entered into the MIS; and (b) develop 
simple pre-programmed questions or analyses to assist analyses and preparation 
of progress reports. 
(xi)  Prepare  a  user  manual  which  describes  all  steps  in  the  program,  including 
procedures  for  field  monitoring  of  each  parameter,  specific  agencies  assigned  to 
each  task,  roles  and  responsibilities,  data  collection,  data  entry  to  the  MIS,  data 
analyses, and the preparation of progress reports. 
(xii)  Pilot  the  monitoring  program  with  all  relevant  agencies,  including  data  collection, 
entry, analyses, and reporting. 
(xiii)  Support  the  implementation  of  at  least  the  first  six  months  of  the  monitoring 
program.  
(xiv)  For  all  tasks,  include stakeholder consultations  as  needed  to ensure  strong  inter-
agency support and participation for the program. 
(xv)  Deliverables:  (i)  a  final  report,  which  includes  (a)  final  draft  long-term  ecological 
monitoring  program,  (b)  user  manual,  (c)  description  of  all  activities,  lessons 
learned, and recommendation for follow-up. 
(xvi)  Timelines: the program and user manual shall be completed within the first year of 
project  implementation.  This  will  give  the  specialist  sufficient  time  to  lead  the 
piloting and at least first six months implementation of the program.

APPENDIX EMP-2. ECOLOGICAL MONITORING PROGRAM – GUIDING NOTES 
1. 
The  project  will  establish  a long-term  ecological  monitoring  program for the  Qihe  River 
within  Hebi  City,  including  the  pilot  Qihe  River  National  Wetland  Park  (NWP).  An  ecological 
monitoring specialist will be recruited as part of the loan implementation consulting services to 
support the design, piloting, and implementation of the program. The objectives of the program 
and  tasks  of  the  specialist  are  described  in  the  terms  of  reference  in  Appendix  EMP-1.  It  is 
anticipated  that  the  program  will  include  monitoring  of:  (i)  vegetation  restoration  in  the  barren 
hills and NWP by the project; (ii) population monitoring for a small number of threatened species 
e.g.    Qihe  River  Crucian  Carp,  Wild  Soybean,  and  key  communities  such  as  migratory 
waterbirds. This appendix provides guiding notes to assist the design of the program.  
Barren hills component. The 19 barren hills in the project have been divided into four 
2. 
types (see PPTA Supplementary Document 1). Monitoring could be conducted at one hill from 
each type, with two survey locations (one south facing and one north facing) identified at each 
hill.  Monitoring  could  be  conducted  two  times  every  year  (May  and  August)  during  the 
construction phase and once a year (August) in the operation phase. Fieldwork would comprise 
surveying a 20x30 m quadrat, including record of relative frequency/coverage of each species, 
measuring height and diameter of trees in the sampling area, and taking representative photos 
of different species. 
3. 
Wetland  restoration  component  in  the  pilot  NWP.  For  the  wetland  restoration 
component,  six  locations  (1x1  m)  are  suggested  for  monitoring:  two  for  aquatic  area,  two  for 
riparian buffer strips, and two for the river bank.  
4. 
Data could be recorded using a table similar to Table 1 below.

5. 
Migratory  waterbirds  along  the  Qihe  River,  including  the  pilot  NWP.  For  this 
program,  “waterbirds”  could  be  defined  as  ducks,  geese,  storks,  and  herons.  Point  counts 
should be conducted three times a year: once in the winter, once in the early summer, and once 
in  the  peak  autumn  migration  season.  Survey  route  should  follow  along  the  bank  of  the  Qihe 
River  (from  Panshitou  Reservoir  to  the  confluence  of  Qihe  River  with  Wei  river),  with  point 
counts  undertaken  approximately  5  km  apart.  Within  the  pilot  NWP,  point  counts  should  be 
selected at 1 km intervals. All  waterbirds heard or observed should be recorded at each point 
count location, as well as the following information: date, GPS location, weather condition, and 
habitat description. Any notable behavior (e.g., roosting, nesting) should also be recorded. 
Fish. Species and/or communities for monitoring should be selected. At the least, Qihe 
6. 
River  Crucian  Carp,  a  key  species  of  the  Qihe  River,  should  be  included  in  the  program. 
Monitoring  methods  will  need  to  be  tailored  to  the  species  and/or  communities  selected.  In 
general, the methods might include: (i) monitoring once a year (in the autumn) at three to five 
sampling sites in the upper, middle, and down-stream sections of the Qi; (ii) fish sampled could 
be by netting and/or non-lethal electro-fishing. Records should be made of the species, relative 
abundance and sex ratio of fish recorded; (iii) at each site, general habitat condition and water 
112 
quality  parameters  should  also  be  monitored,  including  temperature,  speed,  depth,  sediment 
type, dissolved oxygen, pH, water transparency, and electrical conductivity. Survey staff should 
carry  out  interviews  with  local  residents,  fishing  management  department,  and  fisherman  to 
collect the fishing data along the Qihe River.

7.  Aquatic  Invertebrates. Aquatic  invertebrates  could  be  sampled  at  the  same  12  locations 
described  shown  in  section  IV  of  this  report.  At  each  site,  it  is  suggested  two  hand  screen 
samples are collected. Kick samples (whereby an aquatic net is positioned in the water at arms' 
length  downstream  and  the  stream  bottom  is  disturbed  by  foot,  so  that  the  dislodged 
invertebrates  are  carried  into  the  net)  should  be  collected  from  fast-water  habitats.  Dip-net 
samples  (whereby  an  aquatic  net  is  pushed  through  vegetation  and  sediments)  should  be 
collected from  slow  water  habitats (especially  bank  areas).  Each kick-sample  should cover  an 
area of at least one square meter, and each dip-net sample should be taken from about 10-20m 
of pool and bank habitat. These four samples would be supplemented by “visual” collections for 
a period of 10-20 minutes per site. A total of at least 100 organisms is recommended, if fewer 
than  100  specimens  are  sampled,  additional  kick-net,  dip-net,  and  visual  samples  should  be 
taken. 
8.  The net contents are emptied into a pan of stream water. Larger rocks, sticks, and plants 
may be removed from the sample if invertebrates are first removed from them. The contents of 
the  pan are  poured into a sieve to remove smaller  organisms  and debris.  The  sample is  then 
transferred to a bottle and preserved by adding 95% ethyl alcohol. Samples can then be sorted 
in the laboratory, and specimens identified using a stereo-microscope. To maintain taxonomic-
level consistency, organisms should be identified to as lowest level as possible. Specimens too 
immature to identify with confidence to the taxonomic level in references should be discarded.

STAKEHOLDER COMMUNICATION STRATEGY 
A  Stakeholder  Communication  Strategy  (SCS)  is  required  by  ADB  to  ensure  inclusiveness, 
transparency, and meaningful participation1 of concerned stakeholders for the Henan Hebi River 
Environmental  Improvement  and  Ecological  Conservation  Project.  It  provides  an  agreed 
communication platform for key stakeholders particularly between the project’s affected groups 
and the executing and implementing agencies, ensure that the stakeholders’ views and interests 
are fully integrated into the project design, implementation and operation. Specifically, the SCS 
could help in ensuring a regular flow of reliable project information; and inclusion of vulnerable 
groups  in  the  distribution  of  project  benefits  during  project  implementation  and  operation.  The 
communication  strategy  matrix  outlines  and/or 
identifies  key  messages,  means  of 
communication, and timeline of delivery for various stakeholders during the project cycle.  
The SCS serves to inform and involve project beneficiaries and communities in relevant project 
activities,  enhance  government  agencies’  capacity  to  manage  the  project,  enhance  project 
benefits and mitigate negative impacts. It complements the Consultation and Participation Plan 
(C&PP) prepared for the project. Stakeholders could be engaged to participate through various 
types,  i.e.,  information  sharing  about  the  project,  consultations,  shared  decision  making, 
responsibility  or  control.  During  project  design  and  implementation  stage,  the  EA/PMO  will 
conduct  meetings  with  concerned  stakeholders,  public  awareness  campaign  on  solid  waste 
management and related subcomponents, capacity buildings and other methods.  
The  key  stakeholders  identified  for  the  project  include  the  following:  (i)  government  agencies 
responsible  for  project  design,  management  and  implementation  (i.e.,  HCG,  Qihe  River 
Ecological  Conservation  and  Construction  Office,  Planning  Bureau, Water  Resources  Bureau, 
Forestry Bureau, Environmental Protection Bureau, Qi County Government, Qibin District, Xun 
County,  Housing  and  Urban-Rural  Construction,  Women’s  Federation,  Poverty  Alleviation 
Office, etc.); (ii) project beneficiaries (including women, farmers, and other vulnerable groups); 
(iii)  community  leaders;  (iv)  private  sector  (including  NGOs,  community-based  organizations, 
business sector and local media that may have interest on the project.   
1  Meaningful participation is defined as a process that (i) begins early in the project preparation stage and is carried 
out  on  an  ongoing  basis  throughout  the  project  cycle;  (ii)  provides  timely  disclosure  of  relevant  and  adequate 
information that is understandable and readily accessible to affected people; (iii) is  undertaken in an atmosphere 
free of intimidation or coercion; (iv) is gender inclusive and responsive, and tailored to the needs of disadvantaged 
and  vulnerable  groups;  and  (v)  enables  the  incorporation  of  all  relevant  views  of  affected  people  and  other 
stakeholders  into  decision  making,  such  as  project  design,  mitigation  measures,  the  sharing  of  development 
benefits and opportunities, and implementation issues. ADB Safeguard Policy Statement 2009.

Annex 4 
CONSULTATION AND PARTICIPATION PLAN 
A. 
Rationale 
Consultation and Participation Plan (C&PP) for the concerned stakeholders within the project 
areas is required by ADB to ensure social inclusion. The purpose of this plan is to engage the 
stakeholders in meaningful consultation and decision-making process; inform them about the 
project  and  consult  them  on  various  issues  relevant  to  the  project/subcomponents  and 
activities during projet design and implementation. Consultation and participation serve venue 
for the key stakeholders (i.e., government agencies, project beneficiaries, women, etc.) to be 
informed  about  the  project,  clarify  and  express  feedbacks,  issues  and  concerns,  and 
suggestion;  learn  how  they  will  be  benefited  by  the  projects;  participate  in  decision-making 
and  take  action  and/or  be  involved  during  the  design,  project  implementation  and 
operation/maintenance stages. 
B. 
Objectives 
1. 
To ensure that key stakeholders are well-informed, consulted about the project, in all 
phases  of  project  cycle  (planning,  implementation  and  operation/maintenance),  enable them 
to  participate  in  decision  making  and  how  they  will  be  involved  or  contribute  to  integrated 
water resources management of the Qihe River Basin.  
2. 
To  increase  the  level  of  awareness  of  various  stakeholders  about  the  project  and 
subcomponents  (i.e.,  solid  waste  management,  wetland  management,  and  biodiversity 
protection, barren hill greening, greening along river banks, etc.). 
3. 
To  ensure  participation  among  the  local  people  and  work  harmoniously  with  the 
concerned implementing agencies and identify ways on how the communities will be benefited 
by the project/subcomponents, and ensure its sustainability.
