Project Administration Manual Purpose  
The  project  administration  manual  (PAM)  describes  the  essential  administrative  and 
management requirements to implement the project on time, within budget, and in accordance 
with the policies and procedures of the government and Asian Development Bank (ADB). The 
PAM includes references to all available templates and instructions either through linkages to 
relevant URLs or directly incorporated in the PAM. 
The Ministry of Finance (MOF), the Agency for Implementation of Projects in the Field of Agro-
industry  and  Food  Security  (AIFSA),  and  participating  financial  institutions  (PFIs)  are  wholly 
responsible  for  the  implementation  of  ADB-financed  projects,  as  agreed  jointly  between  the 
Government of Uzbekistan and ADB, and in accordance with the policies and procedures of the 
government  and  ADB.  ADB  staff  is  responsible  for  supporting  implementation  including 
compliance  by  MOF,  AIFSA,  and  PFIs  of  their  obligations  and  responsibilities  for  project 
implementation in accordance with ADB’s policies and procedures. 
2.  At loan negotiations, the Government of Uzbekistan and ADB shall agree to the PAM and ensure 
consistency  with  the  loan  and  project  agreements.  Such  agreement  shall  be  reflected  in  the 
minutes of the loan negotiations. In the event of any discrepancy or contradiction between the 
PAM and the loan and project agreements, the provisions of the loan and project agreements 
shall prevail. 
After ADB Board approval of the project's report and recommendations of the President (RRP), 
changes in implementation arrangements are subject to agreement and approval pursuant to 
relevant government and ADB administrative procedures (including the Project Administration 
Instructions) and upon such approval, they will be subsequently incorporated in the PAM.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
1. 
The proposed project will support the development of livestock value chains by increasing 
outreach  of  participating  financial  institutions  (PFIs)  to  livestock  farmers  and  entrepreneurs 
throughout the country. The project impact will be contribution of the agriculture sector to inclusive 
economic  growth,  income  and  employment  increased.  The  outcome  will  be  production  and 
marketing of livestock products increased. The project has two outputs as outlined below: 
(i)  Access to finance in the livestock subsector increased. The project will provide long-
term funds to PFIs to extend subloans to eligible subborrowers for capital investment. To 
be eligible, a subborrower must be a commercial entity registered under and compliant 
with Uzbek laws and regulations, must not be a PFI related party as defined by the Central 
Bank  of  Uzbekistan  (CBU),  and must  have  a maximum  total  asset  value of  $50  million 
equivalent at the time of the application for a subloan. Investment subprojects will include 
but not be limited to livestock production, processing, input supply, and service delivery. 
The project will improve access to market-based bank finance for producers, processing 
enterprises, input suppliers and service providers in the livestock value chain. As such, it 
will  help  increase  livestock  productivity  and  sustainability,  processing  capacity  and 
utilization, and marketing of inputs and livestock products. 
(ii)  Support services to the livestock  subsector improved. The project will facilitate the 
development of private sector veterinary practices to improve access to clinical veterinary 
services  and  animal  management  and  health  advice,  including  effective  use  of  anti-
microbial drugs. Specifically, the project will support the Institute of Veterinary Medicine 
(IVM)  based  in  Samarkand  province  to  (i)  develop  and  deliver  a  continuing  education 
program for veterinarians working in both public and private veterinary service provision; 
(ii) establish a veterinary association and upgrade an existing veterinary journal to further 
enhance  professionalism  and  effective  dissemination  of  veterinary  best  practices;  (iii) 
establish a model private veterinary practice under the auspices of IVM as a model for the 
development  of  private  veterinary  service  delivery  in  Uzbekistan;  and  (iv)  replicate  the 
model practice for at least six private veterinary practices in other areas of Uzbekistan. 
The project will also help develop capacity of PFIs in developing livestock lending policy 
and  procedures,  credit  products,  training  staff  in  livestock  sector  lending,  and 
implementing outreach strategy through increased client awareness of bank products and 
services and application procedures.

the  project 
for  monitoring 
implementation, 
2. 
The Agency for Implementation of Projects in the Field of Agro-industry and Food Security 
(AIFSA) will be the executing agency. A project management office (PMO) will be set up under 
the existing organization of AIFSA. The PMO will be provided with staff and operational costs and 
be  responsible 
training,  capacity 
development, and providing technical support to PFIs. To enhance capacity of the AIFSA, PMO 
staff will include in-house AIFSA staff and contracted experts to save the cost of engaging a large 
team  of consultants for project management  and to  ensure  efficient  utilization  of the  loan fund 
allocated to project management. The PMO will be responsible for (i) reviewing and monitoring 
subproject  implementation,  (ii)  overseeing  project  financial  audits,  and  (iii)  implementing 
veterinary services capacity development activities. AIFSA will recruit technical experts to support 
PFIs in developing livestock lending credit policy and procedures, credit products, and outreach 
strategy, and train PFI staff. A list of PMO staff is in Table 3. Each PFI will establish a project 
implementation unit (PIU) under its existing structure to oversee the implementation of the credit 
line activities at the respective PFI. The project organization chart is in Figure 1.

to any PFI not conforming with any of the specified criteria until such time that the PFI is able to 
satisfy the criteria. The PFI will be required to remedy any noncompliance with eligibility criteria 
within 6 months of default and, in any event, within the disbursement period of the project. Terms 
and conditions of the SLA will take precedence over eligibility criteria defined in this document. 
5. 
Potential PFIs will be assessed through a due diligence procedure in accordance with the 
requirements of ADB. During the detailed due diligence assessment, particular attention will be 
given to a PFI’s overall lending capabilities, and financial and loan portfolio performance. The PFI 
will  be  required to  have a  satisfactory financial  and management  structure,  a satisfactory  risk-
based capital adequacy, an acceptable asset quality and lending performance, adequate liquidity, 
and  the  organization,  management,  and  technical  staff  and  other  resources  required  for  the 
efficient operation of a financial institution.

Qualified Participating Financial Institutions 
17. 
The  following  ADB  eligibility  criteria  have  been  used  for  selection  of  PFIs:  (i)  financial 
soundness as evidenced by adequate capital, asset quality, liquidity, and profitability; (ii) adequate 
credit  and risk management  policies,  operating systems,  and  procedures;  (iii)  compliance with 
prudential  regulations,  including  exposure  limits;  (iv)  acceptable  corporate  and  financial 
governance  and  management  practices  including,  among  other  things,  transparent  financial 
13

accordance with parameters established by ADB. 
18. 
The  financial  analysis  of  PFIs  participating  in  the  Livestock  Value  Chain  Development 
Project  was  undertaken  as  part  of  a  broader  financial  due  diligence  that  included  financial 
management assessment and integrity due diligence. The analysis comprised a review of each 
PFI’s financial performance and an assessment of its compliance with Central Bank of Uzbekistan 
(CBU) prudential regulations and Asian Development Bank (ADB) loan covenants established for 
the Livestock Value Chain Development Project. PFI due diligence has considered current and 
potential credit lines and loan funds from ADB, and other major development partners.1  
19. 
Five  PFIs  were  selected:  Microcreditbank,  Qishloq  Qurilish  Bank  (QQB),  Turonbank, 
Uzpromstroybank, and Xalq Bank. Ipoteka Bank also expressed interest in participating but did 
not complete due diligence requirements in time for project processing. It will be considered for 
participation after project start-up. All selected PFIs satisfy ADB’s eligibility criteria for financial 
intermediaries under ADB’s Operations Manual Bank Policies (OM D6/BP) of 2003. 
1  Detailed  financial  due  diligence  and  financial  management  assessment  of  each  PFI  and  integrity  due  diligence 
reports are available upon request for ADB’s internal review purpose only.

COSTS AND FINANCING 
The  following  key  assumptions  underpin  the  cost  estimates  and  financing  plan:  (i) 
20. 
exchange rate:  UZS8,440  =  $1.00;  and  (ii)  price  contingencies  based  on  expected  cumulative 
inflation over the implementation period as in Table 4. It is important to note that most of the loan 
fund ($146 million out of the total $150 million) will be channeled to PFIs for onlending and hence 
this amount is subject to neither price nor physical contingencies.

FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT 
A. 
Financial Management Assessment 
A  financial  management  assessment  of  the  proposed  project  was  conducted  between 
22. 
December  2018  and  April  2019  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  Guidelines  for  the  Financial 
Management  and  Analysis  of  Projects,2  ADB’s  Financial  Due  Diligence: A  Methodology  Note,3 
ADB’s Technical Guidance Note on Financial Management Assessment,4 and ADB’s Technical 
Guidance  Note  on  Financial  Due  Diligence  for  Financial  Intermediaries.5  The  financial 
management assessment  covered the role of the AIFSA as the executing agency for the project 
and five PFIs as implementing agencies for the project (Microcreditbank, Qishloq Qurilish Bank 
[QQB], Turonbank, Uzpromstroybank, and Xalq Bank). 
23. 
Agency  for  Implementation  of  Projects  in  the  Field  of  Agro-industry  and  Food 
Security (AIFSA). Based on the assessment of AIFSA, there are no financial management risks 
that would undermine implementation of the project in respect of AIFSA’s proposed role in project 
management.  AIFSA  has  significant  experience  in  the  implementation  of  projects  financed  by 
ADB,  the  World  Bank,  and  other  international  financial  institutions.  The  financial  management 
arrangements in place for those projects are appropriate for the project. AIFSA is institutionally 
capable and familiar with projects of similar nature.  
24. 
Participating Financial Institutions. No key financial management risks exist in relation 
to the proposed PFIs that would undermine implementation of the project. Several of the PFIs 
have limitations in staffing in respect of accounting, internal audit, and risk management. Some 
PFIs also have other minor financial management limitations. However, these limitations have not 
adversely affected the implementation of other projects or the delivery of credit funds financed by 
the  government  or  international  financial  institutions.  No  specific  actions  to  address  the  PFIs’ 
financial management limitations prior to the withdrawal of funds by PFIs are recommended.  
25. 
It  is  concluded  that  while  the  overall  pre-mitigation  financial  management  risks  of  the 
AIFSA  and  PFIs  are  substantial,  AIFSA  and  all  selected  PFIs  have  adequate  experience  and 
capacity,  as  observed  in  the  implementation  of  the  ongoing  ADB-financed  Horticulture  Value 
Chain  Development  Project  and  its  additional  financing,  to  administer  advance  account 
procedures with the six (6) month-expenditure limit proposed and the statement of expenditure 
(SOE) procedures with no ceiling. Mitigating measures and  actions to address each PFI’s and 
AIFSA’s  financial  management  limitations  have  been  discussed  with  each  entity  involved  and 
included for time-bound compliance as outlined in Table 11.

Disbursement 
28. 
In  order  to  expedite  the  disbursement  process  for  the  proposed  project,  the  ADB’s 
Statement of Expenditure (SOE) procedures for financial intermediary loans will be applied. The 
advance fund processing sequence are described below and the fund flow diagram in Figure 2. 
Advance  Fund  Processing  Sequence.  The  following  disbursement  sequence  will  be 
PFI  prepares  the  first  six-month’s  disbursement  projections  (based  on  estimates  of 
market  demand for  potential  livestock-related  subloans) for  the  initial  6 months  after 
project start-up for ADB’s project division (CWER) endorsement. 
PFI  submits  a  withdrawal  application  for  initial  advance  after  confirming  that  all  the 
disbursement  conditions  have  been  met,  and  the  first  six-month’s  disbursement 
projections to AIFSA for checking and transmission to ADB. 
(iii)  ADB  reviews  the  withdrawal  application  and  makes  necessary  advance  to  PFI’s 
advance account.6 
(iv)  PFI submits the first three subloan applications to AIFSA for checking and forwarding 
(v) 
for review and approval by ADB’s project division. 
For  subsequent  six-month  periods,  (a)  PFI  disburses subloans using the fund  in the 
advance account; (b) PFI then submit documents (including list of disbursed subloans 
and  withdrawal  application)  to  AIFSA  for  checking  of  eligibility  (if  any  issues,  AIFSA 
clarifies with PFI); and (c) ADB reviews withdrawal and replenishes advance account 
as necessary. PFI is required to certify that all the eligibility criteria are met for liquidated 
subloans and AIFSA to confirm based on checking and regular monitoring. 
6  All selected PFIs are capable of (i) executing foreign exchange and local currency transactions; (ii) handling a large 
volume of transactions; and (iii) issuing detailed monthly bank statements promptly. Therefore, these PFIs can open 
separate accounts and/or sub-ledgers for ADB funds in their own accounting systems for the project purpose.

The ADB’s loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB’s Loan Disbursement 
30. 
Handbook  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time),7  and  detailed  arrangements  agreed  upon 
between the government and ADB. Online training for project staff on disbursement policies and 
procedures  is  available.8  Project  staff  are  encouraged  to  avail  of  this  training  to  help  ensure 
efficient disbursement and fiduciary control.  
31. 
The  PFIs  will  be  responsible  for  preparing  disbursement  projections,  collecting  and 
retaining  supporting  documents,  and  preparing  and  sending  the  list  of  approved  subloans and 
withdrawal applications to AIFSA. AIFSA will be responsible for checking and submitting the PFIs’ 
disbursement  projections  and  PFIs’  withdrawal  applications  to  ADB.  PFIs  will  submit  the  all 
withdrawal  applications  through  AIFSA.  In  addition,  AIFSA  will  be  responsible  for  preparing 
disbursement  projections  related  to  project  management  and  capacity  development  expenses, 
collecting  and  retaining  supporting  documents,  and  preparing  and  sending  withdrawal 
applications related to project management and capacity development expenses to ADB. 
32. 
PFIs will disburse subloans based on the six-month disbursement projections approved 
by ADB. PFIs are required to submit the first three subloan applications to AIFSA for checking 
and forwarding for ADB’s review and approval. Before submitting a PFI’s withdrawal application 
to ADB, AIFSA may request the respective PFI to provide a full set of documents for subloans 
already  approved  by  the  respective  PFI.  Within  7  working  days  from  receipt  of  subloan 
documents, AIFSA will check to ensure that such approved subloans meet all eligibility criteria 
set forth in the PAM. In case a subloan does not meet all eligibility criteria, AIFSA will request the 
respective PFI to (i) remove such an ineligible subloan from its list of subloans; (ii) make refund 
to the advance account, if disbursement is made from the advance account; and (iii) adjust the 
withdrawal application accordingly before AIFSA’s onward submission of the list of subloans and 
withdrawal application to ADB. AIFSA reserves the right to check all approved subloans and/or a 
specific number of approved subloans on a sample basis. 
Advance  fund  procedure.  ADB’s  advance  fund  and  SOE  procedures  will  be  used for 
33. 
disbursement  under  the  ADB’s  loan.9  AIFSA  and  each  PFI  will  open  one  US  dollar  advance 
account to facilitate disbursements. AIFSA and each PFI will establish an advance account in its 
name  and  shall  be  accountable  and  responsible  for  proper  use  of  advances  to  the  advance 
account. The outstanding advance to the advance account under AIFSA’s name will not exceed 
AIFSA’s  estimated  six-month  budget  required  for  project  management  expenses.  The 
outstanding advance to the respective advance account under each PFI’s name will not exceed 
each  PFI’s  estimated  six-month  budget  required  for  payments  to  be  made  to  eligible 
subborrowers. The request for initial and additional advances to the advance account should be 
accompanied  by  an  Estimate  of  Expenditure  Sheet  detailing  (i)  the  estimated  expenditure  for 
project management for the forthcoming six (6) months in the case of AIFSA, and (ii) the estimated 
subloans for the forthcoming six (6) months in the case of PFI. The ADB’s project division (CWER) 
responsible for  project  administration  will  review  the reasonableness of the  6-month  estimates 
provided by AIFSA and each PFI.

PERFORMANCE MONITORING, EVALUATION, REPORTING, AND 
COMMUNICATION 
A. 
Project Design and Monitoring Framework  
63. 
Key  monitoring  indicators  for  the  project  are  presented  in  the  design  and  monitoring 
framework (DMF) in Appendix 1 of the Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board 
of Directors. The AIFSA will established a project performance monitoring system by Q2 2020 to 
enable monitoring of detailed activities, output, outcome, and impact indicators. 
B. 
Monitoring and Reporting 
Project  performance  monitoring.  Each  PFI  will  be  required  to  include  in  its  quarterly 
64. 
progress reports information on its subloan portfolio: (i) name or type of loan product, (ii) borrower 
characteristics (male and female owned), (iii) loan tenor, (iv) interest rate, (v) repeat loan, new 
loan, (vi) classification by size, (vii) sector of activity, (viii) region, (ix) number of employees (male 
and female), and (x) loans approved and disbursed. The reporting template will be provided to 
the  AIFSA  and  PFIs  prior  to  the  inception  mission.  These  reports  will  be  ADB‘s  basis  for 
monitoring  and  updating  project  performance  and  measuring  the  development  impact  of  the 
project.  
65. 
Compliance monitoring. Compliance of the PFIs to project agreement covenants will be 
monitored through periodic ADB review missions, quarterly progress reports by the PFIs, random 
spot  checks  of  subloan  documents,  and  review  of  the  PFIs'  audited  financial  statements.  An 
environmental  specialist  will  be  recruited  by  the  PMO  (based  in  AIFSA)  to  help  monitor  PFIs’ 
training  and  assist  PFIs  in  ESMS  establishment  and  operations  including  the  preparation  of 
Annual Environmental and Social Performance Reports of the PFIs. 
Safeguards monitoring. Monitoring and reporting of the implementation of safeguards 
66. 
requirements and procedures within the established ESMS will be prepared by PFIs. The PFIs’ 
quarterly progress reports will include status of compliance with safeguards covenants. The PFIs 
will submit to AIFSA (the executing agency) annual environmental and social performance reports 
by the end of January every year. Based on the PFIs’ annual reports, AIFSA will submit to ADB 
annual Safeguard Monitoring reports by mid-February of the following calendar year.  
Gender  and  social  dimensions  monitoring.  PFIs  will  be  required  to  report  the  GAP

achievements in their quarterly progress reports.  
C. 
Evaluation 
ADB will conduct semiannual and midterm review missions to assess the progress of the 
68. 
project and review compliance with the loan agreement and project agreement covenants. The 
midterm  review  mission  will  undertake  a  comprehensive  review  of  the  project  design  and  the 
performance  of  the  project.  It  may  require  a  change  in  the  design  and  implementation 
arrangements.  Within  six  (6)  months  after  the  loan  closing  date,  MOF  will  submit  a  project 
completion report to ADB in a form acceptable to ADB.14

X. 
ANTICORRUPTION POLICY 
69. 
ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any violations of the 
Anticorruption  Policy  relating  to  the  project.15  All  contracts  financed  by  ADB  shall  include 
provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the 
executing agency and all project contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers. 
Individuals and/or entities on ADB’s anticorruption debarment list are ineligible to participate in 
ADB-financed  activity  and  may  not  be  awarded  any  contracts  under  the  project.16  To  support 
these efforts, relevant provisions will be included in the legal agreements.  
XI. 
ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISM 
People  who  are,  or may  in the future  be,  adversely  affected  by the  project  may  submit 
70. 
complaints  to  ADB’s  Accountability  Mechanism.  The  Accountability  Mechanism  provides  an 
independent forum and process whereby people adversely affected by ADB-assisted projects can 
voice,  and  seek  a  resolution  of  their  problems,  as  well  as  report  alleged  violations  of  ADB’s 
operational  policies  and  procedures.  Before  submitting  a  complaint  to  the  Accountability 
Mechanism, affected people should make an effort in good faith to solve their problems by working 
with  the  concerned  ADB  operations  department.  Only  after  doing  that,  and  if  they  are  still 
dissatisfied, should they approach the Accountability Mechanism.17
