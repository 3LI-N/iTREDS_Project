Project Administration Manual Purpose and Process 
1.  The  project  administration  manual  (PAM)  describes  the  essential  administrative  and 
management  requirements  to  implement  the  project  on  time,  within  budget,  and  in 
accordance with the policies and procedures of the government and Asian Development 
Bank (ADB). The PAM should include references to all available templates and instructions 
either through linkages to relevant URLs or directly incorporated in the PAM. 
2.  The  Guizhou  Provincial  Government  (GPG),  the  executing  agency,  and  Guizhou Water 
Resources Investment Company Limited (GWIC), Anlong county government (ACG), and 
Nayong county government (NCG), the implementing agencies, are wholly responsible for 
the implementation of ADB-financed projects, as agreed jointly between the borrower and 
ADB,  and in accordance  with  the  policies and  procedures  of the government  and ADB. 
ADB staff is responsible for supporting implementation including compliance by the GPG, 
ACG,  and  NCG  of  their  obligations  and  responsibilities  for  project  implementation  in 
accordance with ADB’s policies and procedures. 
3.  At loan negotiations, the borrower and ADB shall agree to the PAM and ensure consistency 
with the loan and project agreements. Such agreements shall be reflected in the minutes 
of the loan negotiations. In the event of any discrepancy or contradiction between the PAM 
and the loan and project agreements, the provisions of the loan and project agreements 
shall prevail. 
4.  After ADB Board approval of the project's report and recommendations of the President 
(RRP), changes in implementation arrangements are subject to agreement and approval 
pursuant to relevant government and ADB administrative procedures (including the Project 
Administration  Instructions)  and  upon  such  approval,  they  will  be  subsequently 
incorporated in the PAM.

Rationale

PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
Rocky desertification is characterized by vegetation degradation, soil erosion, and bedrock 
1. 
exposure.  It  occurs  in  various  countries  and  regions,  including  the  Mediterranean  and  Dinaric 
karst regions of the Balkan Peninsula as well as the southwest region of the People’s Republic of 
China (PRC) on a large scale.1 In the PRC, rocky desertification is one of the most serious land 
degradation problems in karst areas spreading in the southwest, which has a population of 220 
million  and  overlaps  the  Yangtze  River  Economic  Belt.  Karst  area  is  susceptible  to  rocky 
desertification because of the low soil formation rate and high permeability of limestone. Where 
arable flat land and water are limited, originally vegetated karst areas are cultivated by removing 
vegetation and planting rain-fed crops which are less effective for soil conservation. Soil erosion 
control is not conducted in most cultivation areas. Such repeated unsustainable cultivation has 
increased the rocky desertification areas. Climate change is expected to increase temperatures 
and  the  frequency  and  intensity  of  extreme  climatic  events,  including  storms.  This  could 
exacerbate rocky desertification by exposing the soil surface to warming and evaporation, and by 
causing  physical  damage  such  as  erosion.  Rocky  desertification  reduces  vegetation, soil,  land 
productivity, and arable lands; increases natural disasters such as landslides and debris flows; 
and deteriorates ecology,  increasing  vulnerability  to climate change  and deteriorating  people’s 
livelihoods. 
2. 
Guizhou is in the southwest PRC and has a population of 35 million, of which 36.1% is 
ethnic minority. Agriculture, forestry, and fishery account for 16.3% of Guizhou’s gross domestic 
product  (GDP)2—much  higher  than  the  PRC  average  of  9.2%.  Crop  production  is  the  most 
important agricultural activity (10.4% of Guizhou’s GDP and 64.0% of its agricultural, forestry, and 
fishery  products).  Guizhou’s  total  area  is  176,167  square  kilometers  (km2),  of  which  92.5%  is 
mountain or hilly area. It has 112,240 km2 of karst areas (63.7% of its total area). Guizhou is in 
the Yangtze River Economic Belt and is an important province to develop the southwest and far 
west regions. It has the biggest rocky desertification area in the PRC, at 30,237 km2 (17.2% of its 
total area and 25.2% of the total rocky desertification area in the PRC).3 
Water  is  necessary  to  change  unsustainable  land  use  and  restore  vegetation  in  rocky 
3. 
desertification areas. In the southwest PRC, including Guizhou, rainfall concentrates during the 
rainy season and becomes floodwater that cannot be used.4 Porous limestone formations cannot 
capture and store much rainfall. Much of the water drains into rivers quickly through numerous 
short creeks and streams that run deep in valleys, or through deep aquifers (groundwater rivers) 
in limestone layers.5 Although annual precipitation in Guizhou (1,273 millimeters) is much higher 
than the PRC average (622 millimeters), the amount of annual water supply per person (272 cubic 
meters  [m3]/person)  is  about  60%  of  the  PRC  average  (447  m3/person).  To  capture  sufficient 
1   Karst topography is a landscape formed from the dissolution of soluble rocks such as limestone. 
2   Guizhou’s GDP is CNY1,050.3 billion. The biggest contributor to Guizhou’s GDP is industry, but its contribution rate 
of 31.6% is lower than the PRC average of 34.3%. 
3   In  Anlong  and  Nayong  counties  where  the  project  will  be  implemented,  the  ratio  of  rocky  desertification  areas  is 
32.4% in Anlong and 25.4% in Nayong, which are much higher than the provincial ratio of 17.2%. 
4   Uneven seasonal  rainfall  in  Anlong  and  Nayong  is more  remarkable  than  in  the  whole  province.  In  2014,  annual 
precipitation concentrated during May–September was 84.0% in Anlong and 74.0% in Nayong. 
5   ADB’s flagship publication (ADB. 2012. Drying Up—What to Do about Droughts in the People’s Republic of China:  
With a Case Study from Guiyang Municipality, Guizhou Province. Manila) also indicated that only 33% of rainfall and 
runoff in Giuyang (capital city of Guizhou) can be captured and stored or kept in river flows because of its mountain 
terrain,  karst  deposits,  high  evaporation  from  stone  desertification,  and  rapid  drainage  out  of  Guiyang  through 
underground channels.

water and distribute it to users in karst areas, and to change unsustainable land use and restore 
vegetation in rocky desertification areas, water storage facilities are essential.6 
4. 
Guizhou  has  the  lowest  GDP  in  the  PRC  at  CNY26,444,  which  is  56.7%  of  the  PRC 
average. The rural poverty ratio in Guizhou (18.0%) is much higher than the national rate (7.2%).7 
The  poor  population  in  rocky  desertification  areas  accounts  for  50.2%  of  Guizhou’s  total  poor 
population. Rocky desertification is a main cause of the deterioration of livelihoods in Guizhou. 
Governments’ past activities. The central government issued the Planning Framework 
5. 
for  Integrated  Rocky  Desertification  Management  in  Karst  Areas  in  2008.8  Based  on  this 
framework,  different  levels  of  government  prepared  more  detailed  plans  to  address  rocky 
desertification, including the Guizhou Provincial Master Plan for Water Resources Development, 
Ecological  Improvement,  and  Rocky  Desertification  Management.9  Activities  under  this  master 
plan include the construction and rehabilitation of water storage and transfer facilities; integrated 
control  of  slope  land  farming;  improvement  of  irrigation  area  and  vegetation;  and  farmland 
development,  to  increase  water  supply,  irrigation  area,  and  forestry,  and  control  the  rocky 
desertification area. The main challenges that have emerged through past rocky desertification 
management  are:  (i)  since  unsustainable  land  use  by  local  people  is  the  main cause  of  rocky 
desertification, local people need to be involved in rocky desertification management to reduce 
the  driving  force  for  rocky  desertification  and  ensure  the  sustainability  of  rocky  desertification 
management; (ii) monitoring of rocky desertification should be conducted adequately, following 
methods  and  frequency  set  in  advance,  to  provide  an  accurate  baseline  and  assess  the 
effectiveness  of  rocky  desertification  management;  and  (iii)  local  governments’  finances  and 
capacities for rocky desertification management need to be strengthened. 
6. 
Strategic fit. The project will protect the ecological environment, improve water security, 
increase resilience to climate change, and improve people’s livelihoods. It is consistent with (i) the 
Thirteenth Five-Year Plan of the PRC, 2016–2020, which aims to realize “ecological civilization”;10 
(ii)  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  country  partnership strategy  for  the  PRC,  2016–2020, 
which  aims  to  improve  the  environment  and  manage  climate  change  by  realizing  ecological 
civilization;11  (iii)  ADB’s  Strategy  2020  and  the midterm review  of  the  strategy,  which focus  on 
environmentally  sustainable  growth  and  the  environment,  including  climate  change;12  and 
(iv) ADB’s Water Operational Plan, 2011–2020, which aims to increase efficiency and productivity 
in the delivery of water services.13 
6   The amounts of annual water supply per person from water storage facilities in Anlong (86 m3/person) and Nayong 
(52  m3/person)  are  much  smaller  than  the  amount  in  the  province  as  a  whole  (159  m3/person).  This  is  because 
Anlong and Nayong have insufficient water storage facilities (water storage capacities per person are 42 m3/person 
in  Anlong  and 39 m3/person in  Nayong  against  462  m3/person  in  the  whole province).  Some  70%–80%  of  water 
supply in Anlong and Nayong relies on unstable resources such as rainfall, stream, and groundwater. 
7   Anlong and Nayong are national poverty counties located in a national pilot area for poverty reduction. The poverty 
ratio in the project areas is 20.7% in Anlong and 20.6% in Nayong.

Lessons. Lessons from international institutes such as the United Nations Convention to 
Combat  Desertification14  and  ADB’s  previous  projects  have  been  incorporated  in  the  project 
design,  including  (i)  the  necessity  of  economic  incentives  for  land  users,  for  sustainable  land 
management;  (ii)  the  effectiveness  of  market-based  approaches  to  scale  up  sustainable  land 
management,  such  as  payment  for  ecosystem  services  based  on  cost–benefit  analysis; 
(iii) technologies to avoid water leakage from reservoirs in karst areas; (iv) the effectiveness of 
revegetation with community participation; (v) the need for a neutral third party with knowledge of 
eco-compensation to coordinate between affected people and beneficiaries to establish an eco-
compensation mechanism;15 and (vi) effective measures to disseminate demonstrated initiatives 
(e.g., workshops, publications, use of website, and cooperation with academic societies). 
B. 
Impact and Outcome 
8. 
The  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  (i)  livelihoods  of  people  living  in  rocky 
desertification  areas  improved  (footnote  9).  The  project  will  have  the  following  outcome:  rocky 
desertification area reduced.16 
C. 
Outputs 
Output 1: Water resources conserved. This output will include (i) construction of two 
9. 
reservoirs in Anlong and Nayong counties in Guizhou (with maximum water storage capacities of 
78.98 million m3 in Anlong and 14.69 million m3 in Nayong) and related water transfer facilities 
(canals, pipes, a pump station, a regulation pond, and terminal tanks);17 and (ii) establishment of 
water user associations for the reservoirs.18 Innovative technologies will be used to prevent water 
leakage and slope collapse of the reservoirs and to increase the efficiency of water transfer. The 
design maximum flood occurrence is 1 in 2,000 years for the dam and spillway in Anlong and 1 in 
1,000 years in Nayong.19 The two reservoirs will provide water for irrigation (46,980,000 m3/year, 
4,263 m3/hectare [ha]/year) and domestic use (44,710,000 m3/year, 493 m3/household/year). 
10. 
Output  2:  Environment,  ecology,  and  land  productivity  restored.  This  output  will 
include (i) revegetation; (ii) promotion of sustainable farming; and (iii) monitoring, policy reform, 
capacity development, and knowledge dissemination. 
11. 
Revegetation  will  reduce  existing  and  potential  rocky  desertification  by  planting  native 
trees  (including  fruit  trees)  effective  for  ecological  restoration,  soil  conservation,  and  climate 
resilience.  Local  people  with  land  use  rights  on  rocky  desertification  area  where  no  farming  is 
being  conducted will  conduct revegetation  in the area based  on  agreements  with the Guizhou 
Water  Resources  Investment  Company  Limited (GWIC)  using materials,  trees,  and  equipment 
14  United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification. http://www2.unccd.int/.  
15  To protect the water quality in a reservoir, people’s activities that pollute the reservoir are restricted and pollution 
reduction activities are promoted near the reservoir. People affected by such pollution reduction  measures can be 
adequately compensated by establishing an eco-compensation mechanism.  
16  The design and monitoring framework is in Table IX-1. 
17  Includes the construction of a 74.5-meter high rock-fill dam in Anlong and a 94.0-meter high concrete face rock-fill 
dam in Nayong. 
18 Water user associations contribute to efficient water use by operating irrigation facilities, allocating water to members, 
and providing instructions on water saving and advanced farming to members.  
19  The  design  maximum  flood  occurrence  is  the  flood  level  under  which  the  reservoir  can withhold  without  causing 
damage to the main structures. 
4 
provided  by  the  GWIC.20  The  planted  trees  and  income  from  the  trees  will  belong  to  the  local 
people, which will increase their motivation for revegetation. Consultants will train local people, 
supervise revegetation activities, and conduct monitoring.  
To change unsustainable farming (i.e., cultivation of low-value rain-fed crops without soil 
12. 
control)—which is the main cause of rocky desertification—to sustainable farming, the project will 
provide  local  farmers  with  incentives  to  adopt  sustainable  farming.  Sustainable  farming  pilot 
projects  will  include  the  construction  of  irrigation  facilities,  demonstration  of  water-saving 
technologies,  soil  erosion  control,  and  cultivation of  high-value  crops.  Local farmers  who  have 
land use rights on the pilot project areas will conduct sustainable farming based on agreements 
with  the  county  government.  The  county  government  will  construct  irrigation  facilities  and  soil 
erosion control structures and purchase necessary materials, equipment, and seedlings. Income 
from sustainable farming will belong to the local farmers. Consultants will train the local farmers, 
supervise the pilot projects, conduct monitoring, and promote sustainable farming (e.g., through 
onsite workshops, market surveys, and guidance to local farmers on sustainable farming). 
Other activities will include (i) monitoring of rocky desertification and the impact of climate 
13. 
change, (ii) establishment of eco-compensation mechanisms for the two reservoirs constructed 
under the project (footnote 15), (iii) protection of important revegetated areas; (iv) improvement 
of  governments’  existing  policies  and  regulations,  (v)  improvement  of  existing  microfinancing 
systems to promote sustainable farming, and (vi) dissemination of the project’s initiatives.  
14. 
Value added by ADB assistance. ADB will add value by introducing new technologies 
and  good  practices  in  project  design  and  implementation,  including  community  involvement. 
Specifically, the project will (i) introduce water-saving technologies; (ii) involve and benefit local 
people,  especially  women;  (iii)  introduce  climate  change  adaptation  measures;  and  (iv) 
disseminate  project  initiatives.  Innovative  technologies  to  prevent  water  leakage  and  increase 
water transfer efficiency will be used for the reservoirs and water transfer facilities, and a demand-
based  remote  water  allocation  system  will  be  demonstrated  in  the  sustainable  farming  pilot 
projects.  Revegetation and  sustainable farming pilot  projects  will  be  conducted,  involving  local 
people, to  reduce  unsustainable  land use and  ensure  the  sustainability  of rocky  desertification 
management activities. Revegetation, promotion of sustainable farming, and monitoring of rocky 
desertification areas and climate change impact will improve climate resilience; and the project 
design  has  considered  anticipated  climate  change  impacts  (adequate  reservoir  and  spillway 
capacities, 
for 
revegetation). Consulting services will help disseminate project initiatives.

COSTS AND FINANCING 
The  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $338.81  million.  The  major  expenditure  items  that 
18. 
constitute the project are civil works and land acquisition and resettlement. 
19. 
The government has requested a regular loan of $150 million from ADB’s ordinary capital 
resources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period 
of 5 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB’s London interbank offered 
rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year ($0.57 million to be 
capitalized in the loan); and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project 
agreements.  Based  on  the  straight-line  method,  the  average  maturity  is  15.25  years,  and  the 
maturity premium payable to ADB is 0.10% per year. 
20. 
ADB  will  finance  the  expenditures  in relation  to  civil  works,  goods,  consulting  services, 
capacity  development  activities,  interest  during  construction,  and  commitment  charge.  The 
government  will  finance  designing,  procurement  activities,  and  construction  supervision;  land 
acquisition and resettlement; civil works; environmental protection; and contingencies. 
21. 
Climate mitigation is estimated to cost $8.21 million and climate adaptation is estimated 
to cost $8.63 million. ADB will finance 88.9% of mitigation costs and 89.2% of adaptation costs.

FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT 
A. 
Financial Management Assessment 
25. 
The financial management assessment was conducted in 2016 in accordance with ADB’s 
Guidelines for the Financial Management and Analysis of Projects, the Financial Due Diligence: 
A Methodology Note, and the Technical Guidance Note: Financial Management Assessment. The 
financial management assessment considered the capacity of the GPG, ACG, and NCG, including 
funds-flow  arrangements,  staffing,  accounting  and  financial  reporting  systems,  financial 
information systems, and internal and external auditing arrangements. Based on the assessment, 
the  financial  management  risk  before  considering  mitigation  measures  is  moderate  mainly 
because of moderate inherent risk (low country-specific risks and moderate entity-specific risks); 
moderate control risk (low risks for implementing agencies, funds flow, external audit, reporting 
and monitoring, and information systems; and moderate risks for staffing and internal audit); and 
comparatively  high  level  of  financial  management  capacities  (high  capacities  for  financial 
accounting, entry treasury, statutory reporting, budgeting, and project budgeting and costing; and 
medium  capacities  for  management  accounting  and  reporting,  financial  modeling  and  project 
evaluation techniques, and internal control and audit). The GPG, ACG, and NCG have agreed to 
implement an action plan as key measures to address the deficiencies. The financial management 
action plan is provided in Table V-1. 
Table V-1: Financial Management Action Plan 
Action 
1. Training on ADB disbursement procedures and 
requirements 
2. Training on ADB financial management requirements, 
including accounting and auditing and foreign exchange and

B. 
Disbursement 
1. 
Disbursement Arrangements for ADB 
26. 
The  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  Loan  Disbursement 
Handbook  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time),  and  detailed  arrangements  agreed  upon 
between the government and ADB. Online training for project staff on disbursement policies and 
procedures is available.22 Project staff is encouraged to avail of this training to help ensure efficient 
disbursement and fiduciary control. 
27. 
The GWIC will be responsible for all disbursement arrangements for expenditures related 
to  re-vegetation,  climate  change  monitoring  equipment,  study  tours,  workshops,  and  other 
22  Disbursement eLearning. http://wpqr4.adb.org/disbursement_elearning  
27 
capacity  development  activities.  The  ACG  and  NCG  will  be  responsible  for  all  disbursement 
arrangements  for  expenditures  related  to  construction  of  Pingqiao  or  Pingshan  reservoirs  and 
related water transfer facilities and sustainable farming pilot projects. 
The GWIC, ACG, and NCG will prepare withdrawal applications and submit them to ADB 
28. 
through  GPFD.  At  the  end  of  each  year,  the  PMO  will  prepare  realistic  projections  of  contract 
awards and disbursements for the following year and submit them to ADB. 
29. 
Advance fund procedure. To facilitate project implementation through timely release of 
loan proceeds, the GPFD will establish an advance account promptly after loan effectiveness at 
a commercial bank. The advance account is to be used exclusively for the ADB’s share of eligible 
expenditures. The currency of the advance account will be US dollar. The GPFD, who established 
the advance account in its name, is accountable and responsible for proper use of advances to 
the advance account.  
30. 
The total outstanding advance to the advance account should not exceed the estimate of 
ADB’s  share  of  expenditures  to  be  paid  through  the  advance  account  for  the  forthcoming  6 
months. The GPFD may request for initial and additional advances to the advance account based 
on  an  Estimate  of  Expenditure  Sheet  setting  out  the  estimated  expenditures  to  be  financed 
through the account for the forthcoming 6 months.23 Supporting documents should be submitted 
to  ADB  or  retained  by  the  GPFD,  GWIC,  ACG  or  NCG  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  Loan 
Disbursement  Handbook  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time),24  and  other  detailed 
arrangements agreed by ADB and the government. The Loan Disbursement Handbook describes 
which supporting documents should be submitted to ADB and which should be retained by the 
government, for liquidation and replenishment of the advance account. 
31. 
Statement  of  Expenditure  (SOE)  procedure.  The  SOE  procedure  may  be  used  for 
reimbursement  of  eligible  expenditures  or  liquidation  of  advances  to  the  advance  account.25 
Supporting  documents  and  records  for  the  expenditures  claimed  under  the  SOE  should  be 
maintained and made readily available for review by ADB's disbursement and review missions, 
upon  ADB's  request  for  submission  of  supporting  documents  on  a  sampling  basis,  and  for 
independent audit. Reimbursement and liquidation of individual payments in excess of the SOE 
ceiling should be supported by full documentation when submitting the withdrawal application to 
ADB. 
32. 
Before the submission of the first withdrawal application, the GPG, through GPFD, should 
submit to ADB sufficient evidence of the authority of the person(s) who will sign the withdrawal 
applications  on  behalf  of  GPG,  together  with  the  authenticated  specimen  signatures  of  each 
authorized  person.  The  minimum  value  per  withdrawal  application  is  US$100,000  equivalent. 
Individual  payments  below  this  amount  should  be  paid  (i)  by  GWIC,  ACG,  and  NCG,  and 
subsequently claimed to ADB through reimbursement, or (ii) through the advance fund procedure, 
unless otherwise accepted by ADB. 
2. 
Disbursement Arrangements for Counterpart Fund 
33. 
GWIC, ACG, and NCG will timely provide counterpart funds for civil works; goods; design, 
procurement and supervision; land acquisition and resettlement; environmental protection; and 
23 Estimate of Expenditure Sheet is available in Appendix 8A of the Loan Disbursement Handbook (footnote 25). 
24  Loan Disbursement Handbook: http://www.adb.org/documents/loan-disbursement-handbook 
25  SOE forms are available in Appendix 7B of ADB’s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from    time to 
time). 
28 
contingencies as specified in the loan and project agreements. The GWIC, ACG, and NCG will 
disburse counterpart funds to  contractors,  suppliers,  service providers,  and  people  affected  by 
land acquisition and resettlement.  
C. 
Accounting 
34. 
GPG  will  maintain,  or  cause  to  be  maintained,  separate  books  and records  by  funding 
source  for  all  expenditures  incurred  on  the  project  following  Accounting  Methods  for  Projects 
Financed by the World Bank (reference No. 2000 [13]).26 GPG will prepare consolidated project 
financial statements in accordance with the government's accounting laws and regulations, which 
are consistent with international accounting principles and practices.

35. 
GPG  will  cause  the  detailed  consolidated  project  financial  statements  to  be  audited  in 
accordance with international standards on auditing and the PRC auditing standards (where these 
are consistent with international standards on auditing), by an independent auditor acceptable to 
ADB. The audited project financial statements together with the auditors’ opinion will be submitted 
in the English language to ADB within 6 months of the end of the fiscal year by GPG. 
The  audit  report  for  the  project  accounts  will  include  a  management  letter  and  audit 
36. 
opinions, which cover (i) whether the project financial statements present an accurate and fair 
view or are presented fairly, in all material respects, in accordance with the applicable financial 
reporting standards; (ii) whether the proceeds of the loan were used only for the purposes of the 
project;  and  (iii)  whether  the  borrower  or GPG  was in compliance with the financial  covenants 
contained in the legal agreements. 
37. 
Compliance with financial reporting and auditing requirements will be monitored by ADB 
review  missions  and  during  normal  program  supervision,  and  followed  up  regularly  with  all 
concerned, including the external auditor.  
38. 
GPG, ACG, and NCG have been made aware of ADB’s approach to delayed submission, 
and  the  requirements  for  satisfactory  and  acceptable  quality  of  the  audited  project  financial 
statements.27 ADB reserves the right to require a change in the auditor (in a manner consistent 
with the constitution of the borrower), or for additional support to be provided to the auditor, if the 
audits required are not conducted in a manner satisfactory to ADB, or if the audits are substantially 
delayed. ADB reserves the right to verify the project's financial accounts to confirm that the share 
of ADB’s financing is used in accordance with ADB’s policies and procedures.  
26  Accounting regulations issued by the Ministry of Finance for all foreign aid-funded projects. 
27 ADB’s approach and procedures regarding delayed submission of audited project financial statements:  
(i)  When audited project financial statements are not received by the due date, ADB will write to the executing 
agency advising that (a) the audit documents are overdue; and (b) if they are not received within the next 6 
months, requests for new contract awards and disbursement such as new replenishment of advance accounts, 
processing of new reimbursement, and issuance of new commitment letters will not be processed. 
(ii)  When  audited  project  financial  statements  are  not  received  within  6  months  after  the  due  date,  ADB  will 
withhold processing of requests for new contract awards and disbursement such as  new replenishment of 
advance  accounts, processing of new reimbursement, and issuance of new commitment letters. ADB will (a) 
inform the executing agency of ADB’s actions; and (b) advise that the loan may be suspended if the audit 
documents are not received within the next 6 months. 
(iii)  When audited project financial statements  are not received within 12 months after the due date, ADB may 
suspend the loan. 
Public disclosure of the audited project financial statements, including the auditor’s opinion 
39. 
on  the  project  financial  statements,  will  be  guided  by  ADB’s  Public  Communications  Policy 
(2011).28 After review, ADB will disclose the audited project financial statements for the opinion 
of the auditors on their acceptability by posting them on ADB’s website. The management letter, 
additional auditor’s opinions, and audited entity financial statements will not be disclosed.29

Environment 
VII. 
SAFEGUARDS 
impact  assessment  (EIA), 
71. 
Environment  due  diligence.  The  project  is  classified  by  ADB  as  category  A  for 
environment.  An  environmental 
including  an  environmental 
management plan (EMP), was prepared and disclosed on the ADB website.33 The EIA complies 
with  ADB’s  policies  and  requirements  including  ADB's  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009) 
(SPS).34  The  EIA  concludes  that  the  anticipated  environmental  impacts  of  the  project  can  be 
addressed through mitigation measures prescribed in the EMP. The EMP includes mitigation and 
monitoring  requirements  and  institutional  responsibilities  to  ensure  proper  environmental 
management throughout construction and operation. The EMP is in Appendix 1 of the PAM. 
72. 
Updating the EMP and inclusion in bidding documents. For preliminary and detailed 
designs, the PMO will forward the EMP to the design institutes for incorporating the mitigation 
measures into the designs. If any changes are made to the project design approved by ADB, the 
EMP needs to be updated as necessary. To ensure that bidders respond to the EMP provisions, 
the  PMO  and  PIUs  ensure  that  Pingqiao  Reservoir  Company  Limited  and  Pingshan  Reservoir 
Management  Office  will  prepare  and  provide  the  procurement  agency  with  the  following 
specification  clauses  for  incorporation  into  the  bidding  documents:  (i)  a  list  of  environmental 
management requirements to be budgeted by the bidders in their proposals, (ii) environmental 
clauses for contractual terms and conditions, and (iii) the updated EIA and EMP, and, the domestic 
EIAs. 
73. 
EMP implementation. The GPG, ACG, and NCG will be responsible for ensuring that the 
project will be designed, constructed, decommissioned, and operated in accordance with (i) the 
national and local government environmental, health, and safety laws, regulations, procedures, 
and guidelines; (ii) the SPS, and (iii) the EIA including the EMP. The GPG holds final responsibility 
for the implementation and compliance with the EMP. The GPG has assigned one full-time and 
qualified PMO environment officer who leads the coordination and implementation of the EMP. 
The ACG and NCG has each assigned one full-time and qualified PIU environment officer who 
supports the PMO environment officer and be responsible for the implementation of the EMP and 
related  daily  coordination  at  the  site  level.  Contractors  will  be  responsible  for  internal 
environmental  monitoring,  and  construction  supervision  consultants  will  be  responsible  for 
supervision during construction. Environmental impact monitoring will be conducted by the local 
environment monitoring agencies, contracted by the ACG and NCG. Roles and responsibilities to 
implement the EMP are defined in the EMP.  
74. 
An  individual  consultant  for  environment  will  be  recruited  for  project  implementation 
startup  support.  A  project  implementation  management  support  consulting  team  including  an 
environment  specialist  will  be  also  recruited. These  consultants  will  support  the  contractors  in 
implementing the EMP and the PMO and PIUs in monitoring the implementation of the EMP. 
75. 
Budget  requirements  for  the  EMP.  The  GPG,  ACG,  and  NCG  shall  make  available 
necessary  budgetary  and  human  resources  to  fully  implement  the  EMP.  If  any  unanticipated

environmental  risks  and  impacts  arise  during  construction  and/or  operation  that  were  not 
considered in the EIA, the GPG, ACG, and/or NCG, through the PMO, shall promptly inform ADB 
in writing of the occurrence of such risks or impacts, with detailed description and an action plan 
for incorporation in the EMP. 
76. 
Capacity building. The GWIC, AGC, and NCG have no previous experience with ADB-
funded projects or ADB’s safeguard requirements. To ensure effective implementation of the EMP, 
a capacity building program will be implemented on EMP implementation, supervision, reporting, 
and  the  grievance  redress  mechanism  (GRM).  Training  will  be  provided  by  the  individual 
consultant for environment for project implementation startup support, the environment specialist 
in the project management support consultant team, and other consultants in the team. Trainees 
will include the staff of the PMO, GWIC, ACG, and NCG; contractors; and construction supervision 
consultants. Training programs will cover adjustment and implementation of the EMP, GRM, and 
environmental risks of the project, mitigation measures, monitoring, and reporting.  
B. 
Involuntary Resettlement 
77. 
Land acquisition and resettlement.  The project is classified by ADB as category A for 
involuntary resettlement.  Resettlement plans (RPs) were prepared following the SPS. In order to 
avoid or minimize land acquisition and resettlement, there was close consultation with the officials 
of the ACG and NCG and affected communities during project preparation including the feasibility 
study and preliminary design stages for optimal and proper engineering schemes of the project. 
Based  on  the  impact  survey  among  four  construction  components,  there  are  two  components 
which will involve significant amount of land acquisition and resettlement. One is the construction 
of  Pingqiao  Reservoir  and  related  water  transfer  facilities  in  Anlong,  and  the  other  is  the 
construction of Pingshan Reservoir and related water transfer facilities in Nayong.   
78. 
According to the physical index survey, a total of 2,261 households with 7,980 persons will 
be affected by permanent land acquisition, out of which 3,190 persons in 678 households will be 
physically  relocated  and  resettled.  A  total  of  8,014.69  mu  (534.31  ha)  land  will  be  affected 
permanently, including 194.85 mu (12.99 ha) state land and 7,819.84 mu (521.32 ha) of collective 
land; 113,285.6 m2 of residential structures will be demolished; and 1,737.09 mu (115.81 ha) of 
collective land will be occupied temporarily.  
79. 
Due diligence has been conducted for the component for the restoration of environment, 
ecology, and land productivity in both counties, and it was identified that no land acquisition and 
resettlement will be involved. 
80. 
For the construction of Pingqiao Reservoir and related water transfer facilities, a total of 
6,208.29 mu (413.89 ha) of land areas will be acquired or occupied permanently (138.14 mu [9.21 
ha] state land and 6,070.15 mu [404.68 ha] collective land) from 17 villages in Getang, Puping, 
Sayu, and Haizi Townships and Xifeng Street Administration Office. A total of 1,979 households 
with 6,334 persons will be affected by permanent acquisition of collective land; out of which 2,743 
persons  in  583  rural  households  will  be  physically  displaced  and  require  relocation. A  total  of 
101,836.1 m2  of residential  structures  will  be  demolished. A total  of  1,036.47 mu (69.10  ha)  of 
collective land will be temporarily occupied. 
81. 
For the construction of Pingshan Reservoir and related water transfer facilities, a total of 
1,806.40 mu (120.43 ha) of land areas will be required, which include 56.71 mu (3.78 ha) of stated 
owned land and 1,749.69 mu (116.65 ha) of rural collective land, affecting 25 villages in Zongling, 
Yongxi, Shuguang, and Yangchang Townships. A total of 282 households with 901 persons will 
43 
be affected by permanent acquisition of collective land, and out of them 95 households with 447 
persons will also be affected by house demolition. A total of 11,449.5 m2 of residential structures 
will  be  demolished.  QA  total  of  700.62  mu  (46.71  ha)  of  collective  land  will  be  temporarily 
occupied. 
82. 
Laws and resettlement policies. Compensation for permanent land acquisition is based 
on the Land Administration Law of the PRC, amended in 2004; Rural Land Contract Law of the 
PRC  (1  March  2003);  State  Council’s  Decision  to  Deepen  Reform  and  Strictly  Enforce  Land 
Administration (21 October 2004); Instruction on Updating Land Acquisition Compensation and 
Resettlement  Policy  (3  November  2004);  Regulation  on  Land  Acquisition  Compensation  and 
Resettlement  for  the  Construction  of  Large-  and  Medium-Size  Hydropower Works  (2006);  and 
Opinions  of  the  State  Council  on  Improvement  of  Post-Resettlement  Support  Policies  for 
Reservoir-Induced Resettlement (2006). Meanwhile, the project will also adopt relevant policies 
on land acquisition and resettlement of the local governments including the ACG and NCG. The 
RPs were prepared to comply with the SPS.  
83. 
Based  on  the  consultations  with  local  governments  and  affected  persons  (APs),  and 
general practice in Anlong and Nayong, resettlement principles established for the project are (i) 
land acquisition and involuntary resettlement should be avoided or minimized where feasible by 
developing  and  comparing  a  series  of  design  alternatives;  (ii)  compensation  and  entitlements 
provided  must  be  adequate  to  allow  the APs  to  at  least  maintain  their  pre-project  standard  of 
living,  with  the  prospect  of  improvement;  (iii)  land  temporarily  occupied  and  the  period  for 
disruption  are to  be  kept  to  a  minimum;  (iv)  all  the APs,  legal  and  illegal,  are to  be  taken  into 
consideration and accounted for; (v)  RPs should be prepared and implemented in accordance 
with  state  land  rehabilitation  policy,  national  economic  and  social  development  plans,  and  the 
SPS;  (vi)  all  the  APs  will  be  adequately  informed  about  eligibility,  compensation  rates  and 
standards,  livelihood  and  income  restoration  plans,  and  project  timing;  (vii)  RPs  should  be 
coordinated  with  such 
things  as  regional  development,  economic  development,  and 
environmental protection; (viii) practical and feasible measures should be formulated to restore 
the affected items; (ix) a preferential policy and assistance will be provided to vulnerable groups 
in such things as employment; and (x) close monitoring and timely actions will be carried out to 
identify and resolve any problems. 
84. 
Resettlement Plans and Update. RPs were prepared following the SPS, and related laws 
and  regulations  of  the  PRC.  The  RPs  include  compensation,  resettlement,  and  rehabilitation 
measures  to  restore  living  standards  of  the APS.  The  RP  for  Anlong  is  based  on  a  detailed 
resettlement implementation plan and is deemed final. The RP for Nayong needs updating after 
a  detailed  resettlement  implementation  plan  is  prepared;  and  the  final  RP  will  need  to  be  re-
submitted to ADB for approval. The GPG and NCG will re-endorse the final RP and re-disclose it 
to affected villages. Any civil works involving resettlement impacts in Nayong will not start until the 
updated RP is approved by ADB. 
85. 
Resettlement and livelihood restoration.  The resettlement strategy encompasses (i) 
cash  or  cash  plus  house  plot  in  host  communities,  and  (ii)  the  restoration  of  livelihoods  and 
income. For people losing land, various livelihood rehabilitation strategies will be implemented to 
recover  the  livelihood  and  income  of  land  loss  farmers,  including  replacement  land,  cash 
compensation, pension and social insurance, employment opportunity generation, development 
of cultivation and livestock breeding, development of private-operated businesses, skill training, 
etc. A  post-resettlement support fund  will  be  provided to the  relocated  people  at  CNY  600 per 
resettler per year for 20 years. For people losing housing, they will receive cash compensation or 
cash plus house plot in the resettlement sites. With cash compensation, the resettled residents 
44 
could re-construct their houses in the resettlement sites or purchase houses in other places they 
prefer.  All  the  relocated  households  will  also  receive  a  relocation  allowance.  The  county 
resettlement offices and local governments will provide necessary assistance for relocation during 
resettlement implementation.  
86. 
For vulnerable groups, attention and assistance will be given to their special needs and 
expectations. The PIUs will supervise the implementation of the land acquisition and resettlement 
to ensure that these vulnerable persons receive adequate compensation, livelihood and income 
restoration,  housing  arrangement,  special  fund,  minimum  living  guarantee,  and  assistance  to 
restore their living conditions and incomes. 
87. 
Information disclosure, public participation, and grievance redress. The APs have 
been  and  will  be  further  notified  about  the  key  elements  of  the  RPs,  which  is  based  on  the 
measurement  survey.  On  various  occasions  during  measurement,  social  economic  survey, 
meetings  organized  by  village  committee  and  resident  committees,  and  other  consultations 
between  June  2010  and  August  2016;  the  APs  have  participated  in  the  planning  and  their 
concerns  have  been  integrated  into  the  RPs.  Through  the  village  and  residents  committees’ 
meetings, and visits to the affected households, the compensation rates and resettlement issues 
have  been  consulted,  their  feedback  and  comments  have  been  addressed,  and  the  common 
opinions have been reached. All of their concerned issues and comments have been integrated 
into  the  RPs.  More  consultation  meetings  will  be  held  in  future.  The  resettlement  information 
booklets have been distributed to the affected communities and households. The RPs have been 
redistributed  to  village  committees  and  resident  committees.  The  PIUs  will  be  responsible  for 
supervising implementation, continuing public consultation, monitoring progress, and responding 
to  grievances.  The  GRM  is  well  established  and  explanations  are  included  in  the  RPs  and 
resettlement information booklets. 
88. 
The GRM has been established to solve resettlement issues that may arise. It consists of 
four  stages. The four  stages  channels  include (i)  affected  village or  residential  committees; (ii) 
affected township government offices or street committee offices; (iii) the PIUs, ACG, and NCG; 
and (iv) county resettlement offices. The stages of the GRM are elaborated below: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
If 
is  verbal  discontent, 
Stage  1:  AP(s)  makes  a  verbal  or  written  dissatisfaction  to  the  village 
committee/resident  committee. 
the  village 
it 
committee/resident  committee  must  make  a  written  record.  The  village 
committee/resident committee makes a clear answer within two weeks. 
Stage  2:  If the  AP(s)  is not  satisfied  with the response  of  the  stage  1,  they  can 
complain  to  the  township  government  office  or  street  committee  office.  The 
township government office or street committee office must make a clear answer 
within two weeks. 
Stage 3: The AP(s) can appeal to the PIU, ACG, or NCG within one month after 
receiving the decision from stage 2. The PIU, ACG, or NCG makes a decision to 
deal with the appeal within three weeks. 
Stage 4: If the AP(s) is still dissatisfied for the reply from the PIU, ACG, or NCG, 
they  can  appeal  to  the  county  resettlement  office  within  one  month  after  they 
received the reply. The county resettlement office makes a reply within four weeks. 
If the AP(s) is still dissatisfied with the reply, they can appeal to the administrative 
arbitration. 
89. 
Alternatively and at any time, the AP(s) can appeal to the civil division of the people’s court 
according to the civil procedural law after receiving the reply from the county resettlement office. 
45 
The AP(s) is informed of the result via written notice. 
90. 
The APs also can express dissatisfaction to the external resettlement M&E agency, and 
the external resettlement M&E agency reports to the PIU. The AP(s) also can submit a complaint 
application to ADB to solve the problem. If the problem is still not resolved, and the AP(s) thinks 
that ADB has not performed according to corresponding policies and has caused harm, they can 
submit an appeal according to the ADB accountability mechanism.35 
91. 
Institutional arrangements. Each of the ACG and NCG will arrange over 40 staff to be 
responsible for the land acquisition and resettlement, drawing staff from relevant agencies directly 
under  the  county  government.  The  county  resettlement  office  is  mainly  responsible  for 
coordination for planning, implementation, financial account, and supervision of land acquisition 
and  resettlement,  and  will  work  closely  with  village  committees  and/or  resident  committees, 
township governments, land and resources administration bureau, and the design institute that 
prepared the RP. The external resettlement M&E agency will train staff of the PIU, ACG, NCG, 
county resettlement offices, and other relevant agencies. 
92. 
Cost estimates and implementation schedule.  The cost estimate for land acquisition 
and resettlement is CNY 611.08 million or $ 89.01 million, including costs for compensation for 
permanent  land  acquisition,  residential  house  demolition,  ground  attachments,  relocation 
allowances, construction of resettlement sites, relevant land taxes, other costs, and contingency. 
All  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  activities  will  be  completed  by  31  December  2020. 
Construction  will  not  take  place  before  the APs  are  fully  compensated  and  relocated,  and  all 
arrangements  are  made  to  commence  the  livelihood  rehabilitation  activities  and  the  APs  are 
registered for these. 
93.  Monitoring and evaluation.  Internal and external monitoring of the RP implementation 
will be conducted to ensure successful implementation of the RP. The internal supervision and 
monitoring  will  be  conducted  semiannually  by  the  PMO  and  PIUs  to  ensure  the  resettlement 
activities  are  implemented  according  to  the  RPs.  The  external  M&E  will  be  conducted 
semiannually during the implementation of land acquisition and resettlement and annually for two 
years after the completion of land acquisition and resettlement, by an external resettlement M&E 
agency, and it is responsible for the submission of M&E reports to the PMO, PIUs, and ADB.

C. 
Indigenous Peoples/Ethnic Minorities 
95. 
The project is classified by ADB as Category B on indigenous peoples according to the 
SPS.  The  project  area  includes  ethnic  minority  population,  which  constitutes  52%  of  project 
beneficiaries in Anlong and Nayong. While adverse impacts of land acquisition, resettlement, and 
civil works on ethnic minorities (as well as other population) have been addressed by RPs and 
EMP,  other  impacts  will  be  mostly  positive.  Ethnic  minority  and  social  development  plans 
(EMSDPs) have been prepared in line with the SPS and disclosed locally as well as posted on 
ADB website (footnote 33). EMSDPs include measures to ensure that ethnic minorities participate 
in  and  benefit  from  project  activities,  and  adverse  impacts  to  them  are  avoided  or  mitigated. 
EMSDP  Section  6  requires  that  continued  consultation,  participation  and  monitoring  will  take 
place during the project implementation; and EMSDP action plan Table 10-6 specifies relevant 
actions  and  targets  including  on  consultation  and  participation.  Further,  PAM  Section  E  on 
Stakeholder  Communication  Strategy  includes  information  disclosure  and  communication 
measures including for EMSDPs. The measures in Table VII-3 are consultation and participation 
activities for project implementation stage and methods of consultation and communications with 
project  stakeholders,  including  ethnic  minorities.  These  measures  are  based  on  the  EMSDP 
actions, etc. and will be implemented and monitored closely during the project implementation.

The GPG, ACG, and NCG will implement the EMSDPs with help of consultants. ADB loan 
will finance the costs for the consultants. The project will further strengthen the capacity of the 
GPG, ACG, and NCG through training and consultancy supports to implement the EMSDPs in 
line with ADB’s social safeguard requirements.  
97. 
Grievance  Redress  Mechanism. A  GRM  has  been  developed  in  compliance  with  the 
SPS’s requirements to address environmental, health, safety, and social concerns associated with 
construction, operation, and land acquisition arrangements under the project. The details of the 
GRM, including a time-bound flow chart of procedures, are included in the EMP and RPs. The 
complaint channels are slightly different for environmental and resettlement issues, but the PMO 
will maintain an integrated system to document, follow-up, and report on all cases.  
98. 
Prohibited investment activities. Pursuant to the SPS, ADB funds may not be applied 
to the activities described on the ADB Prohibited Investment Activities List set forth at Appendix 5 
of the SPS. This includes the production of, or trade in, tobacco (a crop widely grown in Anlong 
and Nayong). 
51 
VIII.  GENDER AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS 
A. 
Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy 
Poverty,  social,  and  gender  analyses  were  undertaken  and  adequate  measures  have 
99. 
been included in the project design to ensure that local people, including the poor, women, and 
ethnic minorities, benefit from the project. The project will provide significant poverty reduction 
and  socio-economic  development  benefits  for  local  farmers  and  residents.  A  total  of  718,950 
people  will  benefit  directly  from  improved  irrigation,  water  supply,  fruit  tree  plantation,  and 
sustainable farming. Significant portions of the beneficiaries comprise the poor (21%) and ethnic 
minorities (52%). Availability of water supply and irrigation after the project is expected to increase 
their income and living standards through increased agricultural productivity and other livelihood 
opportunities.  In  addition,  the  project  will  create  local  employment  opportunities  during 
construction and operation. Consultations have been undertaken with local communities during 
project  preparation,  and  consultations  will  be  continued  during  project  implementation. 
Households in the project area are not expected to have affordability issues since the share of 
their  income  spent  for  water  services  is  expected  to  be  below  the  benchmark  of  5%.  Key 
measures  to  address  possible  exclusion  of  the  poor  and  vulnerable  groups  include:  (i) 
representation of vulnerable groups, including women, ethnic minorities, and the poor in public 
hearings on tariff; and (ii) assessment of tariff proposals on their impact on the poor. The details 
are included in the Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy.36 
B. 
Gender 
100.  The  project  is  categorized  by  ADB  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  The  project  will 
provide significant benefits for women. Availability of water will save women’s time for collecting 
water and provide them with opportunities to participate in profitable economic activities such as 
cash crop cultivation and businesses. A gender action plan (GAP) has been prepared addressing 
gender issues identified during the social analysis; and it comprises specific measures for women, 
including:  (i)  their  involvement  in  design  and  implementation  of  project  activities;  (ii)  targeted 
employment and benefits for them during construction and operation; (iii) training and capacity 
building  for  women  beneficiaries;  and  (iv)  monitoring  of  the  GAP  including  collection  of  sex-
disaggregated data. The GPG, ACG, and NCG will implement and monitor the GAP and report 
the progress to ADB. The GAP is presented in the table below.

Monitoring 
1. 
Project Performance Monitoring 
101.  By loan effectiveness, the PMO will prepare a format of quarterly project progress reports 
acceptable to ADB; and make necessary arrangements for preparation of the reports, including a 
flow of data and information collection, responsibility definition of each of relevant agencies (PMO, 
PIU, GWIC, Pingqiao Reservoir Company Limited, Pingshan Reservoir Management Office, etc.), 
and reporting formats (from contractors to the PIUs, from consultants to the PMO, from the PIUs 
to the PMO, etc.). Quarterly project progress reports will include progress of the overall project 
and each component; status of consulting services and activities performed by each consultant; 
information  on  training,  workshops,  and  study  tours  conducted;  status  of  land  acquisition  and 
resettlement based on internal monitoring; status of the implementation of the EMSDPs and GAP; 
records  of  grievance  and  complaints;  project  performance  (achievement  of  each  performance 
indicator against the target); and particular issues. 
58 
102.  Promptly after physical completion of the project, but in any event not later than 6 months 
thereafter or such later date as ADB may agree for this purpose, the PMO will prepare and submit 
to ADB  a  project  completion  report,  in  such  form  and  in  such  detail  as ADB  shall  reasonably 
request,  on  the  implementation  and  evaluation  of  the  project,  including  project  description, 
evaluation of design and implementation, evaluation of performance, and overall assessment and 
recommendations. 
2. 
Compliance Monitoring 
103.  The  GPG  including  the  GWIC,  ACG,  NCG,  and  consultants  for  project  management 
support will closely monitor the compliance of all the covenants included in the loan and project 
agreements. The compliance status of the covenants will be reported through quarterly progress 
reports.  ADB  will  verify  the  compliance  by  reviewing  quarterly  project  progress  reports, 
communicating with the PMO, and/or conducting review missions. 
3. 
Safeguards, Gender, and Social Dimension Monitoring 
104.  Environment. Three types of monitoring will be conducted in accordance with the EMP: 
(i) internal monitoring, to be conducted by the PIUs and construction supervision consultants; (ii) 
external monitoring of air, water, noise and soil standards, to be conducted by local environment 
monitoring  agencies  contracted  by  the  ACG  or  NCG;  and  (iii)  compliance  monitoring,  to  be 
conducted by consultants (environment specialists) for project management support, to ensure 
the EMP is being implemented. The environmental monitoring program is in the EMP. Monitoring 
shall  comply  with  the  PRC  standards  for  environmental  monitoring.  ADB  will  oversee  the 
compliance on the basis of semiannual environmental monitoring reports provided by the PMO 
and review missions. 
105.  Environmental  acceptance  reporting.  Following  the  PRC  Regulation  on  Project 
Completion Environmental Audit (Ministry of Environmental Protection, 2001), within three months 
after the completion of major components, an environmental acceptance report for each shall be 
prepared  by  a  licensed  environmental  monitoring  institute.  The  report  will  be  reviewed  and 
approved  by  the  Guizhou  Provincial  Environmental  Protection  Department  and  Anlong  and 
Nayong  County  Environment  Protection  Bureaus,  and  reported  by  the  PMO  to  ADB.  The 
environmental acceptance reports of the component completions will indicate the timing, extent, 
effectiveness of completed mitigation and of maintenance, and the needs for additional mitigation 
measures and monitoring during operations. 
106.  Resettlement. Internal and external monitoring of RP implementation will be conducted. 
Monitoring  methodologies  are  specified  in  the  RPs.    The  PMO/PIUs  assisted  by  the  project 
management consulting service will carry out internal supervision and monitoring and reporting 
to ensure compliance with the provisions of the RPs. The, PMO, PIUs, and consultants for project 
management support will develop a set of supervision milestones in accordance with the RPs, to 
ensure  timely  and  effective  implementation  of  resettlement  activities. An  external  resettlement 
M&E  agency  will  implement  external  M&E  semiannually  during  the  implementation  of  land 
acquisition and resettlement and annually for two years after the completion of land acquisition 
and  resettlement.  The  cost  of  the  external  resettlement  M&E  will  be  funded  from  ADB  loan. 
External resettlement M&E reports will be forwarded directly to ADB. 
107.  Ethnic  Minority  and  Social  Development  Plans.  Monitoring  of  the  EMSDPs  will  be 
conducted  in  accordance  to  monitoring  and  reporting  methodologies  that  are  specified  in  the 
EMSDPs.  The  PMO  and  PIUs  will  carry  out  internal  supervision  and  monitoring  to  ensure 
59 
compliance with the provisions of the EMSDPs. The GPG including the PMO and the ACG and 
NCG  including  the  PIUs  have  agreed  to  ensure  timely  and  effective  implementation  of  the 
EMSDPs. The social and gender specialist in the project management support consultant team 
will support EMSDP implementation and monitoring, and the results will be included in semiannual 
social monitoring reports, which will be disclosed publicly, until the project completion. The PMOs 
will ensure that civil works contractors comply with applicable labor laws and core labor standards 
and  provide  relevant  training  to  their  workers.  The  PMO  will  prepare  and  submit  to ADB  an 
EMSDP completion report as a part of the project completion report.  
108.  Gender Action Plan. For monitoring of the GAP, clear targets and indicators have been 
established  in  the  GAP  and  some  indicators  are  also  included  in  the  design  and  monitoring 
framework. The social and gender specialist in the project management support consultant team 
will  assist  the  PMO  and  PIUs  in  setting  up  effective  monitoring  systems,  by  working  with  the 
resettlement and social officers of the PMO and PIUs, to ensure implementation of the GAP. The 
GAP will be monitored semiannually and reported through quarterly project progress reports and 
during ADB review missions. 
C. 
Evaluation 
109. 
In addition to regular monitoring, project progress and performance will be monitored at 
least  once  a  year  jointly  by  ADB  and  GPG  during  ADB  review  mission.  ADB  and  GPG  will 
undertake a midterm review in the mid-year of the project implementation period, to conduct a 
detailed evaluation of the project scope, implementation arrangements, progress of the overall 
project  and  each  component,  and  status  of  achieving  the  performance  targets,  recommend 
implementation 
in 
appropriate  measures 
arrangements, reallocation of loan proceeds, changes in ADB financing rations, and extension of 
the loan closing date. Promptly after physical completion of the project, but in any event not later 
than 6 months  thereafter  or  such  later  date as ADB  may  agree for this  purpose,  the  PMO  will 
prepare and submit to ADB a project completion report, in such form and in such detail as ADB 
shall reasonably request, on the implementation and evaluation of the project. 
the  project  scope  and/or 
including  changes 
D. 
Reporting  
110.  The GPG will provide ADB with (i) quarterly project progress reports in a format agreed by 
ADB;  (ii)  semiannual  environmental  monitoring  reports;  and  (iii)  a  project  completion  report 
promptly  after  physical  completion  of  the  project,  but  in  any  event  not  later  than  6  months 
thereafter or such later date as ADB may agree for this purpose. The GPG will also ensure that 
an external resettlement M&E agency will submit M&E reports to ADB (semiannually during the 
implementation  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  and  annually  for  two  years  after  the 
completion of land acquisition and resettlement). To ensure that project will continue to be both 
viable and sustainable, project accounts and the GPG’s audited financial statement together with 
the associated auditor's report, should be adequately reviewed. 
E. 
Stakeholder Communication Strategy  
111.  Project information will be disclosed through ADB’s and government’s websites, meetings, 
interviews, focus group discussions, and community consultation meetings, in accordance with 
requirements of ADB’s information disclosure policy. Main stakeholders are the different agencies 
of the GPG, ACG, and NCG, beneficiaries, APs, and participants in the project implementation. 
Stakeholder  communication  is  also  part  of  the  EMSDPs  and  the  GAP,  and  will  be  monitored 
accordingly. 
60 
112.  Environment.  Meaningful  consultation,  participation,  and  information  disclosure  were 
conducted for environmental impact assessment during project preparation, including information 
disclosure, questionnaire surveys, informal visits to villages and households in the project areas, 
and stakeholder meetings attended by representatives of the affected public and other concerned 
stakeholders.  Dialogue  will  be  maintained  with  communities  in  the  project  areas  throughout 
project implementation. Future consultations will be undertaken by the ACG and NCG, particularly 
environment  officers  of  the  PMO  and  PIUs,  via  questionnaire  surveys,  household  visits, 
workshops, and public hearings during construction. 
113. 
Involuntary  resettlement.   All  of  the  affected  households  were  involved  in  the  project 
impact and socioeconomic survey. Through meetings, interviews, focus group discussions, public 
consultation workshops, and community consultation meetings; local representatives participated 
in  the  planning,  and  their  concerns  have  been  integrated  into  the  RPs.  Before  project 
implementation,  the ACG  including  the  PIU  and  Pingqiao  Reservoir  Company  Limited  and  the 
NCG including the PIU and Pingshan Reservoir Management Office will further consult with the 
APs’  representatives  about  the  impacts  on  local  communities  and  the  detailed  compensation 
plans, to ensure APs’ interests are protected and to provide employment opportunities for the APs’ 
livelihoods as a result of project implementation. Both the ACG and NCG disclosed the RPs in 
their offices and the community offices, to the APs in the local languages. The RPs has also been 
posted on the ADB website (footnote 33). Resettlement information booklets were distributed to 
affected  households.  The  booklets  contain  information  such  as  the  affected  project  areas, 
implementation  progress  of  and  procedures  for  land  acquisition  and  relocation,  compensation 
standards for land acquisition and house demolition, relocation assistance, livelihood restoration 
strategy,  and  post-resettlement  support.  Each  PIU  includes  a  full-time  resettlement  and  social 
officer for supervision of implementation, continued public consultation, monitoring of progress, 
and  response  to  grievances.  The  grievance  redress  procedures  have  been  established  and 
explanations have been included in the resettlement information booklets. 
114.  Ethnic  minority  and  social  development  plans,  and  gender  action  plan.  
Consultations with communities were conducted and will be continued during the implementation 
of the EMSDPs and GAP, not only to inform people about project components or activities, but 
also  to  enable  people  to  ask  questions,  make  suggestions,  state  preferences,  and/or  express 
concerns. Special attention will be paid to the participation of women, ethnic minorities, and other 
vulnerable groups, such as the poor. The EMSDPs for Anlong and Nayong have been disclosed 
on ADB website (footnote 33). The implementation of the EMSDPs and GAP will be monitored, 
verified by the social and gender specialist in the project management support consultant team, 
and reported to ADB through quarterly project progress reports. Public hearings will be held for 
any proposed adjustments in water supply tariff with attendance of adequate representation of 
poor, women, and ethnic minorities. 
115.  Public Disclosure. ADB, the GPG including the PMO, and ACG and NCG including the 
PIUs will disclose relevant project information to the public and interested parties. This includes 
particularly the information regarding the overall project and environment and social safeguards. 
The information disclosure measures for different stakeholders are described in Table IX-2.

ANTICORRUPTION POLICY 
117.  ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any violations of the 
Anticorruption  Policy  relating  to  the  project.37  All  contracts  financed  by  ADB  shall  include 
provisions  specifying  the  right  of ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the 
executing agency and all project contractors, suppliers, consultants and other service providers. 
Individuals/entities  on ADB’s  anticorruption  debarment  list  are  ineligible  to  participate  in ADB-
financed activity and may not be awarded any contracts under the project.38  
118.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  are  included  in  the  loan  and  project 
agreements and the bidding documents for the project. 
XI. 
ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISM 
119.  People who  are,  or may  in the future  be,  adversely  affected  by  the  project may  submit 
complaints  to  ADB’s  Accountability  Mechanism.  The  Accountability  Mechanism  provides  an 
independent forum and process whereby people adversely affected by ADB-assisted projects can 
voice,  and  seek  a  resolution  of  their  problems,  as  well  as  report  alleged  violations  of ADB’s 
operational  policies  and  procedures.  Before  submitting  a  complaint  to  the  Accountability 
Mechanism, affected people should make a good faith effort to solve their problems by working 
with  the  concerned  ADB  operations  department.  Only  after  doing  that,  and  if  they  are  still 
dissatisfied, should they approach the Accountability Mechanism.39

Environment staff within PMO and the implementing agencies. The PMO  will have 
main EMP coordination responsibility. The PMO has designated two full time PMO environmental 
officers responsible for EMP implementation. The officers will: (i) coordinate the implementation 
of  mitigation  measures  during  project  design,  construction,  and  operation;  (ii)  ensure  that 
environmental management, monitoring, and mitigation measures are incorporated into bidding 
documents,  construction  contracts,  and  operation  management  plans;  (iii)  submit  semiannual 
EMP monitoring and progress reports to ADB; (iv) implement the GRM; and (v) respond to any 
unforeseen adverse impacts beyond those mentioned in the EMP. The officers will be technically 
supported by the national individual loan implementation environment consultant (LIEC). At the 
county  level,  the  PIU  of  each  implementing  agency  will  include  one  environment  officer.  This 
officer  will  be  responsible  for  daily  implementation  of  the  EMP,  working  closely  with  the  PMO 
environment  officer,  and  LIEC. TORs  for  PMO  and  PIU  environment  officers  are  in  Appendix 
EMP-1.

Mitigation measures 
 Avoid clearance of vegetation as far as possible:  
 1 – do not clear any vegetation until construction site boundaries are clearly demarcated; 
 2 – ensure contractors are aware of which sites are to be cleared and which are not; 
 3 – demarcate clear access routes in/out of construction sites. Prohibit off-road vehicle and 
worker access to minimize damage to vegetation that will not be cleared;  
 After  completion  of  construction,  immediately  re-vegetate  exposed  surfaces.  Utilize  only 
native species – seedlings and saplings. 
 For rapid stabilization of bare surfaces, if exotic species (e.g. fast-growing grasses) are to 
be used, only use sterilized seedlings which cannot propogate elsewhere.  
 For  the  7  existing  sites:  tombs  and  tombstones  will  be  relocated  by  the  owners,  with 
assistance of cultural relic bureaus; for the remaining sites, these will be fully documented 
by the bureau prior to inundation;  
 If  new  sites  are  unearthed  during  construction,  work  shall  be  stopped  immediately  and 
Anlong and Nayong cultural relics bureaus (CRBs) and the PIUs promptly notified. 
 Use coffer dams and temporary diversion channels to maintain continued water flow while 
works are conducted; 
 Prior to works, re-confirm the planned construction schedule and site EMP actions; 
 Inform residents at least two days before any planned water interruptions; 
 Assist residents if requested with community water storage during the interruption period; 
 Interruptions to water supply should not be longer than one (1) day; 
 In case of accidental interruption (e.g. damage of a pipeline), immediately inform affected 
communities and assist with water supply until the issue is resolved. 
 Prepare and implement a traffic control plan, for approval by the county traffic management 
administration before construction. To include scheduling or diverting construction traffic to 
avoid peak hours, regulating traffic at road crossings, selecting routes to reduce disturbance, 
reinstating roads, and opening them to traffic when construction is completed; 
 Plan  pipeline  construction  to  minimize  disturbances  to  utility  services.  Three-dimensional 
detection of underground facilities will be conducted before construction where appropriate. 
 Residents  and  businesses  will  be  informed  in  advance  through  media  and  information 
boards of the construction activities, dates and duration of expected disruption; 
 Signs  will  be  placed  at  construction  sites  informing  people  of  the  project  GRM,  potential 
dangers (e.g. moving vehicles, hazardous materials, excavations) and safety issues; 
 Communities will be notified in advance of blasting (see below – “Explosives”); 
 Heavy machinery will not be used at night; and, 
 All sites will be secured from unauthorized public access.  
 Prepare environmental, health and safety plan, which will include:  
 Clean and sufficient supply of fresh water for construction sites, camps, offices;  
 Sufficient latrines and garage receptacles at construction sites and work camps; 
 Provide safety clothing to workers as necessary (e.g. boots, helmets, gloves, goggles, ear 
protection) in accordance with health and safety regulations for workers; 
 Emergency  preparedness  and  response  plan  for  accidents.  Establish  emergency  phone 
links with township hospitals and maintain a first-aid base in each construction camp;

Mitigation measures 
 Establish  a  records  management  system  for  occupational  accidents,  diseases,  incidents. 
The records will be reviewed during compliance monitoring and audits; 
 Safety communication. Ensure that occupational health and safety matters are given a high 
degree of publicity to all persons on-site. Display posters prominently; 
 Explosives. All handling, storage and use of explosives  will comply with PRC regulations. 
These  include:  (i)  handling  of  explosives  will  only  by  qualified  personnel;  (ii)  storage  and 
maintenance  of  explosives  will  be  in  specific  and  approved  sites;  (iii)  procedures  will  be 
prepared for the applied use of explosives, including the planning, pre-site clearance, and 
post-site inspection before and after the use of explosives; 
 Train workers in basic sanitation, health, safety, and work hazards. Implement awareness 
and prevention program for HIV/AIDS and other diseases – target community and workers; 
 To  reduce  the  risk  of  water-borne  diseases,  including  from  mosquitos,  equipment  will  be 
regularly  checked  to  prevent  stagnant,  standing  water.  Water  storage  equipment  will  be 
covered.  Sediment  catchment  ponds  and  other  temporary,  exposed  water  bodies  for 
construction will be maintained with minimal vegetation in and around the sites, and will be 
drained immediately upon completion, to minimize the risk of mosquito breeding. 
 An independent expert panel was established by the Guizhou PMO in July 2016. The panel 
comprises three national dam safety engineers, whom are independent from the GPG, ACG, 
NCG, and design institutes. The panel will review the detailed engineering designs of the 
two dams, and during the project construction and operation phases, will convene at least 
twice a year to assess project progress and any issues. 
 As per PRC regulatory requirements, the preparation of the "flood emergency response plan" 
will begin upon the start of construction, and will be completed within one year; then the plan 
will be updated on an annual basis before the start of the flood season (May-October).

Environmental Monitoring, Inspection and Reporting 
12. 
Three types of project monitoring will be conducted under the EMP: (i) internal monitoring 
and  supervision  and  reporting  by  CSCs;  (ii)  EMP  implementation  monitoring  and  progress 
reporting; and (iii) environmental compliance monitoring by local EMS. 
13. 
The  project  monitoring  program  focuses  on  the  environment  in  the  project  areas  of 
influence  in  the  two  counties  (Table  EMP-4).  The  program  covers  the  scope  of  monitoring, 
monitoring  parameters,  time  and  frequency,  implementing  and  supervising  agencies,  and 
estimated  costs.  The  monitoring  shall  comply  with  the  methodology  provided  in  the  relevant 
national environmental monitoring standards. Other associated standards to be followed are the 
national environmental quality standards of air, surface water, groundwater and noise, and the 
pollutant discharge standards. 
14. 
Internal monitoring and supervision and reporting by CSCs. During construction, the 
CSCs will be responsible for conducting internal environmental monitoring in accordance with the 
monitoring plan (Table EMP-4). Supervision results will be reported through the CSC reports to 
the PIUs.  
15. 
EMP implementation monitoring and progress reporting. The LIEC will review project 
progress and compliance with the EMP based on field visits, and the review of the environmental 
monitoring conducted by the IEMA. The findings of the LIEC will be reported to ADB through the 
semiannual EMP monitoring and progress reports. The reports will include (i) progress made in 
EMP implementation, (ii) overall effectiveness of the EMP implementation (including public and 
occupational health and safety), (iii) environmental monitoring and compliance, (iv) institutional 
strengthening  and  training,  (v)  public  consultation  (including  GRM),  and  (vi)  any  problems 
encountered during construction and operation, and the relevant corrective actions undertaken. 
The LIEC will help PMO prepare the reports and submit the English report to ADB for appraisal 
and disclosure.  
16. 
Environmental compliance monitoring by IEMAs. The PIUs in each county will contract 
an IEMA to conduct environmental monitoring in accordance with the monitoring program (Tables 
EMP-4). A detailed cost breakdown will be finalized when the environmental monitoring program 
is updated at the start of each component implementation. Monitoring will be conducted during 
construction and operation period, until a PCR is issued. Semiannual monitoring reports will be 
prepared by the IEMAs and submitted to PMO and the PIUs.  
17. 
Project  completion  environmental  audits.  Upon  completion  of  each  subproject, 
environmental  acceptance  monitoring  and  audit  reports  shall  be  (i)  prepared  by  a  licensed 
environmental monitoring institute in accordance with the PRC’s Guideline on Project Completion 
Environmental Audit (2001), (ii) reviewed for approval of the official commencement of individual 
subproject  operation  by  environmental  authorities,  and  (iii)  finally  reported  to ADB  through  the 
semiannual  EMP  monitoring  and  progress  reporting  process.  These  subproject  completion 
reports shall be finalized within 3 months after each subproject completion, or no later than 1 year 
with permission of the local environment protection bureaus.  
18.  Quality assurance (QA) /quality control (QC) for compliance monitoring. To ensure 
accuracy of the monitoring, QA/QC procedures will be conducted in accordance with the following 
regulations:

Training and Capacity Building 
19. 
The  two  project  counties  have  no  previous  experience  with  ADB-funded  projects  or 
safeguard  requirements.  To  ensure  effective  implementation  of  the  EMP,  a  capacity  building 
program will be implemented on: (i) the EMP, including the mitigation measures, monitoring, and 
reporting;  (ii)  dam  safety  and  climate  change;  (iii)  sustainable  agriculture;  and  (iv)  sustainable 
integrated  watershed  management.  Training  will  be  conducted  by  the  LIEC,  Guizhou  EPD, 
Guizhou Agriculture  Department  and  county  EPBs.  Trainees  will  include  the  PMO,  IAs,  PIUs, 
contractors, CSCs, county water resource bureaus and county agriculture committees. The PMO 
will arrange and support the training programs, supported by the loan implementation consultants.

Grievance Redress Mechanism 
20. 
The PMO and PIU environment officers and social officers will be the lead coordinators for 
GRM implementation. All project agencies and staff will be trained in the GRM and will take an 
active role in supporting these staff as and when necessary.  
21. 
At  the  PMO  level,  the  PMO  environment  officer  and  social  officer  will  establish  a  GRM 
tracking  and  documentation  system,  conduct  daily  coordination  with  the  PIU  officers,  arrange 
meetings and conduct site visits as necessary, maintain the overall project GRM database, and 
prepare the reporting inputs for progress reports to ADB. At the PIU level, the environment officers 
and social officers will instruct contractors and construction supervision companies (CSCs) on the 
GRM  procedures,  and  coordinate  with  the  county  EPBs  and  other  government  divisions  as 
Appendix 1 of Linked Document 4: Project Administration Manual    
15 
necessary. PMO and PIU staff will be trained and supported by the LIEC and Loan Implementation 
Social Consultant (LISC). 
22. 
The  contact  persons  for  different  GRM  entry  points,  such  as  the  PMO  and  PIU 
Environmental and Social Officers, contractors, operators of project facilities, and county EPBs, 
will be identified prior to construction. The contact details for the entry points (phone numbers, 
addresses, e-mail addresses) will be publicly disclosed on information boards at construction sites 
and on the websites of the PMO and county EPBs.  
23.  Once a complaint is received and filed, the PMO and PIU officers will identify if complaints 
are eligible. Eligible complaints include those where (i) the complaint pertains to the project; and 
(ii) the issues arising in the complaint fall within the scope of environmental issues that the GRM 
is authorized to address. Ineligible complaints include those where: (i) the complaint is clearly not 
project-related; (ii) the nature of the issue is outside the mandate of the environmental GRM (such 
as issues related to resettlement, allegations of fraud or corruption); and (iii) other procedures are 
more appropriate to address the issue. Ineligible complaints will be recorded and passed to the 
relevant  authorities,  and  the  complainant  will  be  informed  of  the  decision  and  reasons  for 
rejection. The procedure and timeframe for the GRM is as follows, and also summarized in Figure 
EMP-1.  
  Stage  1  (5  working  days):  If  a  concern  arises  during  construction,  the  affected 
person may submit a written or oral complaint to the contractor. Whenever possible, 
the contractor will resolve the issue directly with the affected person. The contractor 
shall give a clear reply within five (5) working days. The contractor will keep the PIU 
fully informed at all stages. 
2. 
  Stage 2 (5 working days): If the issue cannot be resolved in Stage 1, after five days, 
the  PIU  and/or  PMO  will  take  over  responsibility.  Eligibility  of  the  complaint  will  be 
assessed  and  a  recommended  solution  given  to  the  complainant  and  contractors 
within  five  (5)  working  days.  If  the  solution  is  agreed  by  the  complainant,  the 
contractors  and/or  facility  operators  will  implement  the  solution  within  seven  days. 
Written records will be made of all stages and outcomes. 
  Stage 3 (10 working days): If no solution can be identified by the PMO and/or PIU, 
and/or the complainant is not satisfied with the proposed solution, the PMO and/or 
PIU  will  organize,  within  ten  (10)  days,  a  stakeholder  meeting  (including  the 
complainant,  contractor  and/or  operator  of  the  facility,  county  EPB,  PIU,  PMO).  A 
solution  acceptable  to  all  shall  be  identified  including  clear  steps.  The  contractors 
(during  construction)  and  facility  operators  (during  operation)  will  immediately 
implement  the  agreed  solution.  Written  records  will  be  made  of  all  stages  and 
outcomes. 
24. 
The GRM does not affect the right of an affected person to submit their complaints to any 
agency they wish to, for example the local village committee, community leaders, courts, PMO, 
PIU, and/or Asian Development Bank. 
25. 
The  PMO  and  PIUs  shall  bear  any  and  all  costs  of  implementing  the  GRM,  including 
meeting, travel, and/or accommodation costs of the project staff or affected person. The GRM will 
be implemented throughout project construction and at least the first year of operation for each 
project facility.

Public Consultation and Awareness Raising 
26. 
Two rounds of public consultation were conducted during project preparation (Section VII 
of the EIA). During construction, the project will continue to seek public consultation and raise 
awareness of project activities, especially those which may impact the public such as noise or 
dust. A public consultation plan is in Table EMP-6, and includes public participation in evaluating 
environmental  benefits  and  impacts.  The  PIUs  are  responsible  for  public  participation  during 
project implementation. They will be supported by the PMO Environment and Social Officers and 
the LIEC.

Cost Estimates 
27. 
This section provides an estimate of the cost of EMP implementation. The cost comprises 
three categories: mitigation measures (Tables EMP-2); monitoring (Table EMP-4); and training 
(Table EMP-5). Costs are presented for the construction phase of five years and the first year of 
operation,  i.e.  a  total  of  six  years.  The  costs  do  not  include:  (i)  detailed  design  revisions  and 
adjustments;  (ii)  internal  monitoring/inspection  of  solid  wastes  disposal,  soil  erosion  and  re-
vegetation,  occupational  health  and  safety  during  construction,  as  this  will  be  included  in  the 
construction supervision contracts; and (iii) salaries of PMO and PIU staff. Costs for mitigation 
measures  and  training  are  based  on  estimates  in  the  five  DEIAs  and/or  the  experience  of  the 
PPTA team from other projects. All costs were discussed with the EIA Institute, PMO and IAs. 
28. 
The total estimated cost is CNY66.66 million ($9.99 million) for five years of construction 
phase and the first year of operation, including CNY 32.14 million ($4.82 million) for the Pingqiao 
subproject and CNY 32.54 million ($5.18 million) for the Pingshan subproject (Table EMP-7). All 
EMP costs are incorporated into the overall project budget.

I. 
Mechanisms for Feedback and Adjustment 
29. 
Based  on  environmental  inspection  and  monitoring  reports,  the  PMO  and  PIUs  shall 
decide,  in  consultation  with  the  LIEC,  whether  (i)  further  mitigation  measures  are  required  as 
corrective  actions,  or  (ii)  some  improvements  are  required  for  environmental  management 
practices. The effectiveness of mitigation measures and monitoring plans will be evaluated by a 
feedback  reporting  system.  Adjustment  to  the  EMP  will  be  made,  if  necessary.  The  PMO 
Environmental Officers will play a critical role in the feedback and adjustment mechanism. 
Appendix 1 of Linked Document 4: Project Administration Manual    
19 
30. 
If during inspection, substantial deviation from the EMP is observed or any changes are 
made to the project that may cause substantial adverse environmental impacts or increase the 
number of affected people, then the PMO and PIUs will immediately consult with ADB and form 
an  environmental  assessment  team  to  conduct  additional  environmental  assessment.  If 
necessary, further public consultation will be undertaken. The revised domestic EIAs and project 
EIA, including this EMP, will be submitted to the ADB for review, appraisal, and public disclosure. 
The revised EMP will be passed to the contractors, CSCs and OPFs for implementation.
