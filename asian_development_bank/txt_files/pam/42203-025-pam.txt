Project Administration Manual Purpose and Process 
1.  The  project  administration  manual  (PAM)  describes  the  essential  administrative  and 
management  requirements  to  implement  the  project  on  time,  within  budget,  and  in 
accordance  with  the  Government  and  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  policies  and 
procedures.  The  PAM  should  include  references  to  all  available  templates  and  instructions 
either through linkages to relevant URLs or directly incorporated in the PAM. 
2.  The  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Forestry  (MAF)  and  the  provincial  agriculture  and  forestry 
offices  (PAFO)  are  wholly  responsible  for  the  implementation  of  ADB  financed  projects,  as 
agreed  jointly  between the  borrower  and  ADB,  and  in  accordance  with  the Government  and 
ADB’s policies and procedures. ADB staff is responsible to support implementation including 
compliance  by  MAF  and  PAFO  of  their  obligations  and  responsibilities  for  project 
implementation in accordance with ADB’s policies and procedures. 
3.  At  the  additional  financing  negotiations  the  borrower  and  ADB  shall  agree  to  the  PAM  and 
ensure  consistency  with  the  grant  agreement.  Such  agreement  shall  be  reflected  in  the 
minutes  of  the  additional  financing  negotiations.  In  the  event  of  any  discrepancy  or 
contradiction  between  the  PAM  and  the  Grant  Agreement,  the  provisions  of  the  Grant 
Agreement shall prevail. 
4.  After  ADB  Board  approval  of  the  project's  report  and  recommendations  of  the  President 
(RRP),  changes  in  implementation  arrangements  are  subject  to  agreement  and  approval 
pursuant  to  relevant  government  and  ADB  administrative  procedures  (including  the  Project 
Administration Instructions) and upon such approval they will be subsequently incorporated in 
the PAM.

Project Rationale, Location and Beneficiaries 
PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
The ongoing Northern Rural Infrastructure Development Sector Project (current project) 
1. 
is  enhancing  rural  inhabitants’  access  to  and  participation  in  the  market  economy  to  improve 
their  livelihoods  and  enhance  food  security.  It  supports  increased  production  in  those 
commodities having a comparative advantage within markets that are increasingly accessible to 
investments  by  ADB  and  other  development  partners  in  Greater  Mekong  Subregional  (GMS) 
transport  corridors  and  economic  integration.  The  highly  seasonal  nature  and  uncertainty  of 
rainfall (with the increasing impact from climate change) constrains agriculture yields and limits 
production options. Irrigated agriculture holds the key for removing the risk associated with rain-
fed agriculture, enhancing productivity and providing options for other potentially more profitable 
crops (such as dry season vegetables and melons).  
2. 
Strong positive impacts are already emerging in the current project  as demonstrated in 
the socio-economic impact studies carried out on three completed productive rural infrastructure 
(PRI)  subprojects.  The  PRI  subprojects  consist  of  improving  irrigation  schemes  as  well  as 
access within and around the schemes. This has increased the areas under cultivation for both 
rainy  and  dry  seasons,  with  significant  diversity  of  cropping  especially  during  the  dry  season. 
Water  user  groups  (WUG)  are  providing  the  backbone  for  sustainability  through  organized 
operation and maintenance (O&M) and are also evolving into producer groups able to negotiate 
production contracts with traders, and hence more commercially oriented agricultural practices. 
These developments have underpinned significant impacts including economic internal rates of 
return (EIRR) averaging 22% and an increase in average annual household income of $1,320.1  
The  current  project  is  performing well  as  recorded  in all  project  progress reports,2   and 
3. 
as  measured  by  ADB’s  five  performance  indicators.  Moreover,  review  missions  have 
determined that (i) the technical quality of construction of PRI is good, (ii) the executing agency 
has  the  expertise  needed  to  effectively  implement  ADB  financed  projects,  and  (iii)  significant 
benefits in excess of those originally predicted are already accruing.3  
As of  31 January 2017, project implementation progress was around 99.6% against the 
4. 
elapsed grant period of just over 91.4%.4 Cumulative contract awards and disbursements were 
$20.54  million  (89%)  and  $20.84  million  (91%),  respectively.  The  implementation  of  26  PRI 
subprojects  represents  the  bulk  of  the  current  project  investment,  and  all  of  which  have  been 
completed by June 2016.  
5. 
Moreover,  the  current  project  continues  to  be  compliant  with  all  grant  covenants  and 
safeguard  requirements.  The  annual  project  financial  statements  and  the  annual  audit  reports 
1  Project report - Socio-economic Impact Studies of: (i) Nam Dai Irrigation Subproject in Sing District, Luang-Namtha 
Province; (ii) Nam Haad Right Bank Irrigation Subproject in Pha Oudom District, Bokeo Province; and (iii) Nam Lan 
Irrigation  Subproject  in  Boun-Tai  District,  Phongsali  Province;  all  dated  September  2015,  and  available  in 
supplementary documents number 22, 23 and 24. 
2  The  aide  memoire  for  current  project’s  midterm  review  in  April  2014,  first  recorded  the  request  for  additional 
financing. 
3  The current project was ranked first in good project implementation practice in 2014 through the annual recognition 
award by the Lao PDR Ministry of Planning and Investment and ADB’s Lao Resident Mission. 
4  The  current  project  meets  the  criteria  for  well  performing  projects  as  per  ADB  Operations  Manual,  H5/OP 
Additional Financing, Section B, para 3. 
2 
have  been  completed  satisfactorily,  within  the  due  dates,  and  without  any  issues.  Safeguard 
measures have been consistently and satisfactorily implemented. 
The  additional  financing  will  be  used  to  scale  up  the  current  project’s  outputs. 5 The 
6. 
overall project (refers to the current project with additional financing): (i) will remain technically 
feasible,  economically  viable,  and  financially  sound;  (ii)  is  accorded  high  priority  by  the 
government;  (iii)  is  consistent  with  the  project’s  development  objectives,  and  (iv)  is  consistent 
with  the  current  country  partnership  strategy  (CPS).  The  overall  project  will  continue  to  use  a 
sector modality which has proven to be efficient and effective for organizing implementation.  
7. 
The  overall  project  will  be  carried  out  in  the  same  four  project  provinces  of  Bokeo, 
Louang-Namtha,  Oudomxai,  and  Phongsali.  Table  1  presents  the  geographic  location  of  the 
overall project.

B. 
Impact and Outcome  
8. 
The  impact  of  the  overall  project  will  be  improved  rural  household  incomes  in  the  four 
northern  provinces  of  Bokeo,  Louang-Namtha,  Oudomxai,  and  Phongsali.  This  remains 
unchanged from the current project and is aligned with the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry’s 
(MAF) Agricultural Development Strategy to 2025 and Vision to the year 2030. The outcome will 
be increased agricultural productivity in the four northern provinces of Bokeo, Louang-Namtha, 
Oudomxai,  and  Phongsali,  which  also  remains  unchanged.  The  geographic  coverage  will 
extend to Houn district in Oudomxai province, and Boun-Nua district in Phongsali province. 
C. 
Outputs  
The four main outputs included in the current project remain valid for the overall project, 
9. 
which are described below: 
10. 
Output 1: Production and Productivity Enhancing Rural Infrastructure Constructed 
and/or  Rehabilitated.  This  output  will  include  the  rehabilitation  and/or  construction  of  PRI, 
consisting  of  small  to  medium-scale gravity-fed  irrigation systems  and the rehabilitation and/or 
upgrading of rural access roads. Under the overall project, investment in PRI development will 
be expanded to Oudomxai province. Support for rural access roads under the overall project will 
consist of improvements to rural access in and around the irrigation schemes.  
5 The  project  meets  the  criteria  for  scaling  up  well-performing  projects  as  per  ADB  Operations  Manual,  H5/BP 
Additional Financing, Section C, para 29. 
3 
Twenty-six  PRI  subprojects  have  been  implemented  within  the  current  project  and 
11. 
another 22 PRI subprojects will be financed by the additional financing (AF), for a total of 48 PRI 
subprojects  that  will  be  implemented  under  the  overall  project.  Feasibility  studies  (FS)  have 
already  been  carried  out  for  two  representative  PRI  subprojects  (RSP)  during  AF  project 
preparation. Consultation and participation to enhance the local ownership is essential for long 
term sustainability of the schemes and shall be strongly implemented. 
In the  overall  project,  PRI  subprojects  will  be  strengthened  for  better  climate  resilience 
12. 
by the following measures: 
(i) 
In  many  cases 
Watershed  stabilization. 
the  upstream  watersheds  are 
deteriorating leading to both heavy but short water flow or early drying up of the 
streams.  The  watersheds  need  to  be  stabilized  so  that  stream  flow  can  be 
extended  as  long  as  possible  into  the  dry  season  and  to  preserve  and  protect 
aquatic ecosystems. The overall project will engage an international and national 
bioengineer to design measures to stabilize environs near the infrastructure and 
at  critical  areas  in  the  upstream  watersheds.  The  measures  will  be  included  in 
the  PRI  subproject  works  packages  to  be  carried  out  by  the  construction 
contractors. Please see output 2 for other actions to be taken. 
(ii)  Weir  Design.  In  terms  of  diversion  weir  design,  close  attention  will  be  paid  to 
achieving:  proper  depths  and  lengths  of  cutoff  walls,  wing  walls,  stilling  basin 
elevations  and  dimensions,  and  stronger  headwalls.  Moreover,  upstream  and 
downstream bank design and erosion protection, including properly placed riprap 
where necessary, will be included in the design. Furthermore, integrated into the 
weir design will be measures to enable aquatic life migration up and downstream. 
(iii) 
Emergency  failure  mechanisms.  The  construction  of  emergency  spillways  that 
allow  controlled  failure  to  occur,  to  protect  the  main  structures  during  extreme 
flows, will be included in the PRI subproject design as appropriate.  
13. 
Output  2:  Productivity  and  Impact  Enhancing  Initiatives  Adopted.  Initiatives  to 
enhance the impact and sustainability of investments in PRI will continue.  The activities will  be 
identified in a participatory and gender-sensitive manner from a menu of options developed  with 
the  respective  stakeholders  and  beneficiaries  including:  
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
Strengthening  technical  extension  services  to  PRI  subproject  beneficiaries, 
especially WUGs;  
Establishment  of  farmer  producer  groups  to  coordinate  supplies  of  agricultural 
produce  to  markets  and/or  processors;   
Support  for  contracted  agricultural  production  with  price  incentives  based  on 
quality;  and 
Initiatives  to  secure  tenure  and  access  to  land  for  sedentary  agricultural 
production  and  land  re-zoning  to  protect  the  health  of  watersheds  above 
rehabilitated  irrigation  schemes,  among  others.  
a. 
The  overall  project  will  carry  out  a  dissemination  program  so  that  the 
watershed, irrigation block and cadastral maps prepared under the project 
are  disseminated  to  the  key  stakeholders  at  the  levels  of:  farmer/WUG; 
district,  province  and  the  Department  of  Land  Use  Planning  and 
4 
b. 
c. 
Development within the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment’s 
(MONRE). 
The  maps  will  be  used  as  a  basis  for  designing  soil  and  water 
conservation  measures.  These  measures  will  include  extensive  use  of 
bio-engineering  to  stabilize  the  environs  around  the  irrigation  structures 
and at critical areas of the stream.  
The overall project will intensify efforts so that all farmers within all of the 
irrigation  subproject  command  areas  are  able  to  upgrade  their  land  title 
from  “user”  to  “owner”.  The  overall  project  will  engage  in  the  grant 
implementation  consultants  (GIC)  package  a  land  titling  coordinator  to 
support this objective.6 It will support provincial mobile land titling teams, 
including representatives from the provincial and district offices of Natural 
Resources and Environment (PONRE/DONRE) who will work through the 
provincial  project  office  (PPO)  and  district  coordination  office  (DCO) 
structures. 
14. 
Capacity  building  will  be  an integral requirement of all activities to ensure that women 
and vulnerable ethnic groups have the necessary skills to fully participate and benefit from these 
activities.   
15. 
Output 3: Capacities of National, Provincial and District Agencies Strengthened to 
Enable a Sector Development Approach. Under the current project, this output is addressing 
capacity  building  at  the  national  level  (within  MAF)  as  well  as  the  implementation  capacity  for 
staff  at  NPMO,  the  PPOs  and  the  DCOs.  Capacity  building  efforts  will  continue  under  the  AF 
principally at the district level, but will also address requirements of PPO in Oudomxai as a new 
recipient of PRI investment under the overall project. There are two updates to this output in the 
overall project:  
(i) 
(ii) 
The preparation of an irrigation subsector review (ISR), to provide MAF, ADB and 
other stakeholders, with a clear view and framework for future investment. 
The  current  project  activity  to  strengthen  the  monitoring  and  evaluation  section 
within the Department of Planning and Cooperation (DOPC) will not be continued 
in the overall project. Instead it will be carried out under the ADB financed L3198-
Northern Smallholder Livestock Commercialization Project.7 
Output  4:  Project  managed  and  subprojects  delivered  efficiently  and  effectively. 
16. 
Under  AF,  NPMO  will  continue to  manage the  overall  project  with  the  assistance  of the  PPOs 
within  the  provincial  agriculture  and  forestry  offices  (PAFO)  in  the  participating  provinces.  The 
AF  will  continue  to  provide  adequate  resource  for  operation  and  administration,  as  well  as 
consulting  services  for  implementation  support  and  technical  expertise,  needed  to  implement 
PRI subprojects and overall project management.  
6 The project implementation consultants were previously named as grant implementation consultant. Going forward 
all reference will be “project implementation consultants” for consistency

C. 
Technical Considerations 
1. 
Project Technical Framework 
The  overall  project  will  improve  critical  productive  rural  assets  focusing  on  irrigation  and 
17. 
rural access infrastructure. These assets have been identified and prioritized by the end-users and 
the relevant sector authorities through the provincial development planning process. The specific 
subprojects  have been pre-screened for  prima facie technical, financial and economic feasibility. 
General considerations for the detailed design of the assets include:  
(i) 
(ii) 
Affordably; 
Meeting the specific needs of the end-users; 
(iii)  Minimizing whole life cycle costs; 
(iv) 
(v) 
Optimizing  the  inputs  of  local  resources  including:  labor;  materials;  enterprises; 
and, knowledge; 
Being  within  the  realistic  envelope  of  the  existing  maintenance  capacities.  The 
assets will be demonstrated not to impose additional maintenance burdens that will 
be impossible to meet; and, 
(vi) 
Performing the intended purpose for the entire duration of their design life. 
18. 
At  the  outset,  the  project  will  establish  a  detailed  quality  assurance  framework.  The 
framework will consist of separate yet connected quality control and quality assessment activities 
that  will  ensure  the  entire  production  cycle  yields  assets  that  are  fit  for  their  intended  purpose. 
Particular  attention  will  be  paid  to  quality  control  during  the  construction  process  to  ensure 
adherence to design specifications.  
2. 
Irrigation Subprojects 
The  sustainability  of  irrigation  improvements  will  depend  upon  two  key  factors:  sound 
19. 
engineering and effective WUG management. The irrigation infrastructure designs will: 
(i) 
(ii) 
Incorporate  the  experience  gained  from  the  ADB  socio-economic  studies  of 
completed irrigation projects (2016); and 
Be  consistent  with  international  good  practice  such  as  that  described  by  the 
technical publications of United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization.  
The  designs  of  the  irrigation  systems  will  take  place  in  an  environment  with  three  key 
20. 
uncertainties in relation to estimating steam flow, including: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
Changing land use patterns in the upper watershed areas; 
Limited rainfall and stream flow hydraulic information; and 
Climate  change  altering  traditional  climate  and  rainfall  patterns  and  consequently 
stream flow characteristics. 
Engineering design will need to address this uncertain environment. Special measures will 
21. 
need to be considered such as: 
(i) 
Increasing the structural strength of the weirs against overturning and slippage; 
12 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
(v) 
(vi) 
Lengthening the side and bottom cutoffs against erosion and piping; 
Optimizing the weir crest and stilling basin design; 
Increasing the overall weir size; 
Providing additional emergency outlet facilities to pass flood flows; and, 
Upstream and downstream erosion protection using gabions and bio-engineering. 
The  successful  operation  and  maintenance  of  the  irrigation  systems  will  be  directly 
22. 
dependent upon the effectiveness of the WUG management. The WUGs shall operate according 
to the following principles: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
(v) 
(vi) 
Establish  membership  and  corresponding  rights  within  the  WUGs.  Generally  the 
members  of  WUGs  are  all  irrigation  scheme  beneficiaries  who  own  land  or  share 
crop in the command area of the scheme; 
Establish the management structure of the WUG and the division of responsibilities 
between the irrigation beneficiaries and the sector authorities. A WUG chief should 
be elected by secret vote held on an annual basis by the members. Other support 
management positions will be decided according to the local needs and conditions; 
The WUG chief is the executive responsible for: coordination between the members 
and  the  sector  authorities;  defined  activities  for  maintenance,  rehabilitation  and 
operation of the irrigation scheme; supervising and coordinating water allocation to 
individual farmers; and, settling disputes between the members; 
Establish equitable and transparent water distribution schedule and ensure that it is 
followed.  A  consensus  approach  should  be  taken  to  balance  the  objectives  of 
efficiency, equity, and local customs and practices; 
Establish transparent and equitable collection and management of water fees. Fees 
shall be assigned in direct proportion to benefit realized from the water use; 
Agree upon various initiatives to expand or alter the water distribution, such as the 
construction of additional tertiary canals; and, 
(vii)  Resolve through consensus any issue or problem concerned with the operation and 
maintenance of the irrigation scheme. 
3. 
Rural Access and Roads Subprojects 
23. 
Rural  access  improvements  will  be  prioritized  to  remove  the  most  critical  obstacles  to 
access  and  mobility  within  the  irrigation  schemes  and  to  and  from  the  local  village  and,  or,  the 
nearest  formal  level  of  the  transport  network.  The  road  improvements  will  follow  existing 
alignments  and  focus  on  simple  spot  improvements  and  shaping  of  the  road  surface.  Special 
attention will be focused on the design of sustainable road drainage (surface, side and cross) and 
the use of appropriate surfacing and paving options where needed.  
24. 
Drainage design will consider the impact of climate change which may result in rainfall and 
surface  water  movement  that  differs  from  traditional  experience.  To  counter  these  effects  cross 
drainage  structures  will  be  increased  in  size  and  structures  such  as  vented  and  unvented 
causeways  will  be  constructed.  Side  drains  will  be  concrete lined where  necessary  due to steep 
gradients. The input of the knowledge from the local population in the drainage design is critical. 
13 
Road  surfacing  and  pavement  design  will  be  based  upon  the  measured  strength  of  the 
25. 
existing  subgrade  and  longitudinal  gradient  in  comparison  with  current  and  projected  traffic 
loading.  Where  paving  is  needed  the  design  will  consider  a  variety  of  sub-base,  base  and 
surfacing options. The road pavements will be design for a minimum duration of eight years use 
before periodic maintenance is required.  
26. 
The maintenance will be the responsibility of the WUGs. The WUGs will be responsible for 
carrying out routine maintenance including drainage, embankment shape and other related tasks. 
Wherever possible, structures will be constructed to restrict traffic loading to legal limits.  
PROJECT MANAGEMENT ARRANGEMENTS 
A. 
Project Implementation Organizations – Roles and Responsibilities 
27. 
The  Ministry  of  Finance (MOF)  is  the  borrower’s representative accountable for  all funds 
received  for  the  implementation  of  the  overall  project.  The  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Forestry 
(MAF) is the executing agency (EA) for the overall project, which will fulfill its mandate through its 
Department  of  Planning  and  Cooperation  (DOPC).  DOPC  established  a  national  project 
management office (NPMO) for the current project. The NPMO mandate will be extended to cover 
the  overall  project.  Specifically,  it  will  be  responsible  for  project  coordination  and  management, 
including  financial  management  of  project  accounts,  procurement  of  goods  and  works, 
recruitment  of  consultants,  compliance  with  safeguard  requirements,  and  monitoring  and 
reporting. 
To ensure inter-agency cooperation at the national level, the national steering committee 
28. 
(NSC) established for the current project will continue its function through the overall project. NSC 
will continue to be chaired by a Vice Minister of MAF and will include representation from MOF, 
Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI), Ministry of Industry and Commerce (MOIC), Ministry of 
Public  Works  and  Transport  (MPWT),  Ministry  of  Foreign  Affairs  (MOFA),  Ministry  of  Natural 
Resources  and  Environment  (MONRE),  Lao  Women’s  Union  (LWU),  the  Committee  for  the 
Advancement  of  Women’s  Affairs  and  the  provincial  vice  governors  from  the  participating 
provinces.  NSC  will  meet  annually,  or  as  required,  to  review  overall  implementation  progress, 
approve  annual  work-plans  and  budgets,  and  provide  overall  policy  guidance.  The  NPMO  will 
provide secretariat services to NSC. 
29. 
In the participating provinces, the implementing agencies will be the provincial agriculture 
and  forestry  offices  (PAFOs).  The  provincial  project  offices  (PPOs)  established  in  each  PAFO 
under the current project will continue to function under the overall project and will be responsible 
for financial management at provincial level, coordination and management of implementation of 
PRI  subprojects  and  associated  initiatives.  An  additional  staff  will  be  assigned  to  PPO  from 
PONRE  to  oversee  land  use  planning  and  registration.  The  PPOs  will  also  coordinate  and 
supervise the work of the DCOs. 
30. 
The  provincial  steering  committees  (PSCs)  established  in  each  participating  province 
under  the  current  project  will  continue  to  function  to  ensure  inter-agency  coordination  at  the 
provincial level. Each PSC is chaired by a provincial vice governor with provincial representation 
reflecting  that  for  NSC,  but  will  also  include  governors  from  the  participating  districts.  PSC  will 
meet  annually  or  as  required  to  review  implementation  progress;  ensure  adequate  levels  of 
coordination between key agencies; approve provincial work-plans and budgets; and approve PRI 
subprojects  for  financing  under  the  overall  project.  PPOs  will  provide  secretariat  services  to  the 
PSCs. 
14 
To assist with the process of securing land tenure through land titling,  provincial mobile 
31. 
land titling teams will be established within the PPO/DCO implementation structure and led by a 
provincial  land  use  planning/land  registration  officer  assigned from  PONRE.  In  each district,  the 
provincial coordinator will be assisted by two district land registration officers assigned from each 
respective DONRE. These teams will be supported by a land use planning and land titling officer 
within GIC/NPMO. 
32. 
To assist in implementation at the district level, a DCO will be established  within the two 
new district agriculture and forestry offices (DAFO) participating in the overall project. DCOs will 
implement PRI subproject  activities at district  level. In particular,  with  support from PPO  and 
GIC/NPMO,  they  will  be  responsible  for  the  identification  of  associated  initiatives  during  PRI 
subproject  feasibility;  community  development  activities;  coordination  of  resettlement  activities; 
environment management activities; indigenous people  development activities; gender activities; 
land registration and titling; and monitoring and reporting on physical progress of implementation. 
The structures and staffing of each level are presented below.

maintenance; 
In  view  of  environmental  issues  and  the  potential  impact  rural  infrastructure 
development can have on protected areas, an additional criteria is proposed that 
will  specifically  exclude  subprojects  that  adjoin  or  pass  through  an  existing  or 
proposed protected area; 
The  benefits  from  each  subproject  must  be  independent  and  achieved  directly 
from  the  investment  under  consideration,  i.e.  not  dependent  on  subsequent 
adjoining subproject; and 
The  subproject  must  not  be  located  in  any  area  where  a  major  development, 
such  as  a  new  hydropower  scheme,  a  mine,  or  a  Special  Economic  Zone,  is 
planned.

The  subprojects  are  ranked  by  order  of priority  based  on  their  expected  contribution to 
the provincial socio economic development plan and the project objectives. The tentative list of 
candidate subprojects is in Supplementary Document 15.

Subproject Preparation and Approval 
36. 
Careful  planning  of  project  activities  requires  consideration  to  the  timing  of  the  rainy 
season  which  lasts  from  May  to  October  every  year.  During  that  period,  limited  if  any 
construction  activities  can  take  place  as  a  result  of  the  heavy  downpour  which  render  any 
earthwork impossible. The implementation of subprojects has been planned to be carried out in 
four  phases  taking  into  consideration  the  rainy  seasons  and  priority  of  subprojects.  The  first 
phase  will  comprise  the  two  representative  subprojects  for  which  the  feasibility  studies  have 
been  completed.  The  second  phase  will  comprise  approximately  seven  subprojects. 
Recruitment of national consultants for preparation of feasibility studies, detailed design, bidding 
documents  and  construction  supervision  will  begin  shortly  after  grant  effectiveness,  and 
construction is planned to begin in quarter IV 2018. The third phase will comprise another seven 
subprojects; with the construction planned in quarter IV 2019. The fourth phase will comprise all 
remaining subprojects and construction is expected to begin immediately after the rainy season 
in 2020. Eligible subprojects will undergo the following preparation steps: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
(v) 
(vi) 
Preparation  of  feasibility  study  -  including  studies  and  plans  for  social  and 
economic safeguards;

Preparation of bidding documentation; 
Tendering for construction works; and 
Construction of subproject infrastructures 
The  preparation  of  feasibility  studies,  detailed  design,  and  preparation  of  bidding 
37. 
documents  will  be  carried  out  by  national  consultants  to  be  recruited  by  the  NPMO  following 
consultants’  qualifications  selection  (CQS)  procedures.  The  NPMO  will  recruit  national  firms, 
likely one per province, to prepare feasibility studies, detailed design, bidding documents, and to 
carry  out  supervision  of  construction  for  each  phase  of  implementation  (total  approximately  7 
packages). 8 Feasibility  studies  including  social  and  environmental  safeguard  studies  will  be 
prepared following the model developed for the two representative subprojects. 
The  GIC,  will  provide  support  to  the  national  consultants  particularly  in  the  areas  of 
38. 
preparation of social and environmental safeguard studies and economic analysis. The GIC will 
also  assist  the  NPMO  in  the  review  of  feasibility  studies  and  social  and economic  safeguards 
studies, and will be responsible for the preparation of SIRs. Such unquantified benefits must be 
documented  to  justify  the eligibility  of  the  subproject for financing.  In  particular,  the  review  will 
ensure that the subprojects meet the following criteria:     
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
subproject  is  shown  to  be  technically  feasible  and  the  expected  benefits  have 
been clearly identified. If the estimated economic rate of return is below 12%, an 
EIRR  of  10%  is  acceptable  in  the  presence  of  substantial  level  of  benefits  that 
cannot be readily quantified; 
procurement  packages  have  been  clearly  identified  as  well  as  the  methods  of 
procurement,  cost  estimates  have  been  clearly  identified  and  recorded  and  all 
sources of funding have been identified and agreed/confirmed; 
the  relevant  subproject  investment  report  contains  a  detailed  financing  plan  for 
operation and maintenance, including: the operations company is specified, and 
both  a  sufficient  budget  amount  and  corresponding  source  of  funding  are 
8   Feasibility studies and detailed design for the two representative subprojects have already been prepared.

specified and agreed upon by the relevant project province and other concerned 
parties; 
public  hearings  on  the  subproject  proposal  have  been  held  in  concerned 
kumbans, and measures for future public consultation and supervision; 
a subproject is shown to have no major negative environmental or social impacts, 
and mitigation measures have been defined for minor impacts; 
a  subproject  is  shown  to  have  no  significant  resettlement  impacts,  and  if  such 
Subproject is categorized as Category B, a resettlement plan has been prepared 
in accordance with the Resettlement Framework, and the Beneficiary’s laws and 
regulations, and ADB’s Safeguard Policy Statement; and 
(vii)  where  necessary,  a  Resettlement  Plan  and  an  Ethnic Group  Development  Plan 
have been prepared. 
39. 
In case that a candidate subproject does not meet the criteria provided in paragraph 38 
above,  it  will  be  replaced  by  the  next  priority  candidate  subproject  for  the  respective  project 
province under the List of Eligible Subprojects (ANNEX A). If candidate subprojects not listed in 
the Annex A are to be considered, they will be examined and screened by MAF with the support 
from  an  independent  consultant  acceptable  to  both  ADB  (separately  recruited)  and  the 
government, and submitted to ADB for approval. 
3. 
Subproject Climate Resilient Measures 
40. 
Climate  instability  is  anticipated  and  a  number  of  countermeasures  will  be  taken, 
including  (i)  strengthening  the  weir  design  to  withstand  more  intense  stream  flows;  (ii) 
constructing  passages  to  reduce  stress  on  aquatic  life  by  enabling  aquatic  migration  up-  and 
downstream  of  the  weirs;  (iii)  concrete-lining  canals  to  the  extent  possible  for  more  efficient 
utilization  of  water;  (iv)  increasing  the  stability  of  the  PRI  and  the  health  of  the  watersheds 
through  soil  and  water  conservation  initiatives;  and  (v)  involving  WUGs  and  FPGs  in  the 
implementation of watershed management plans. 
41. 
Prior to ADB's clearance for proceeding with the implementation of each subproject, the 
NPMO will submit to ADB a Subproject Climate Resilience Measures Report (SCRMR) as part 
of feasibility study report. The SCRMR will detail the incremental actions taken against each of 
the above five identified countermeasures to be included in subproject design. The SCRMR will 
include  clear  information  on  the  engineering  design  modifications,  watershed  protection 
measures and the costs of the incremental investments.  
42. 
After  the  review  of  the  feasibility  studies  by  the  GIC  and  necessary  adjustment  as 
required, the GIC will prepare the SIR for the subproject. All safeguard studies and the SCRMR 
will  be  submitted  to  ADB  for  no-objection.  Upon  receiving  ADB’s  no-objection,  the  SIR  and 
related  feasibility  study  will  be  submitted  to  each  PPO  for  approval  of  the  PSC.  Following 
ratification  by  the  PSC,  and  no  objection  from  ADB  on  the  safeguard  studies,  the  feasibility 
study and SIR will be submitted to the NSC/PPC to authorize the allocation of project funds for 
the  preparation  of  the  next  stage  of  preparation.  The  diagram  below  shows  a  summary  work

Detailed Design of Subprojects 
43. 
Once  the feasibility  studies have been  approved by  the  NSC/PPC,  the  NPMO  will  give 
the  order to  proceed to the  national  consultants to  carry  out  surveys  and  detailed  engineering 
designs for civil works component. The DCO will assist in carrying out the surveys as necessary 
and the relevant line agencies will provide support to the national consultants as required. The 
detailed designs will be reviewed by the GIC and NPMO to ensure that the project design meets 
the  required  Lao  standards  and  specifications  for  its  type  of  infrastructure.  Once  endorsed  by 
32 
GIC and NPMO they will be submitted to NSC/PPC for approval. The diagram below shows a

Preparation of Bidding Document  
44. 
Once the detailed designs are approved, the NPMO will give the order to proceed to the 
national  consultants  to  prepare  bid  documents  following  national  competitive  bidding  (NCB) 
procedures.  The  bid  documents  will  be  prepared  based  on  ADB  standard  format  documents. 
The draft English language version of the procurement documents for the first two contracts will 
be  submitted  for  ADB  review  and  prior  approval  regardless  of  the  estimated  contract  amount. 
ADB-approved  procurement  documents  will  be  used  as  a  model  for  all  subsequent  NCB 
procurement  and  will  only  require  post  approval  of  ADB.  The  GIC  will  review  the  bidding 
documents before they are submitted to the NSC/PPC for approval. The diagram below shows

d. 
Construction Supervision 
Upon  mobilization  of  the  contractors,  the  NPMO  will  issue  an  order  to  proceed  to  the 
46. 
national  consulting  firm  to  carry  out  supervision  of  construction  works.  The  NPMO  will  also 
recruit safeguard monitoring entities to monitor the implementation of social and environmental 
safeguard measures identified in the Resettlement Plan (RP), the Environmental Management 
Plan  (EMP),  the  Gender  Action  Plan  (GAP)  and  the  Indigenous  Peoples  Plan  (IPP).  The 
monitoring entities will be recruited following CQS procedures. The DCO will provide assistance 
35 
and support to both the national consultants and the safeguard monitoring entities in supervision 
and monitoring of the implementation of the subprojects. 
e. 
Identification of Productivity- and Impact-Enhancing Initiatives 
47. 
The second component of the project includes support for associated initiatives that will 
enhance  the  impact  from,  and  sustainability  of  investments  in  rural  infrastructure.  These 
initiatives  will  be  identified  during  the  subproject  feasibility  studies,  based  on  consultation  with 
the  beneficiaries  and  various  stakeholders,  and will  become  an  integral part  of the subproject. 
The cost of associated initiatives will be included in the investment cost of each subproject. In 
principle the cost and benefits of the associated initiatives will be taken into consideration in the 
economic  analysis  of  each  subproject.  Each  subproject  may  have  one  or  more  associated 
initiatives, but each initiative must be closely linked to the proposed infrastructure improvement 
and  show  a  clear  correlation  to  the  project  objective  to  improve  agricultural  productivity  and 
market  efficiency.  The  GIC  will  assist  the  identification  and  implementation  of  associated 
initiatives in all four provinces as required. 
48. 
The associated initiatives will be selected based on the consultation with beneficiaries in 
accordance  with  Stakeholder  Communication  Strategy  (Consultation,  Participation,  and 
Awareness) developed in Section IX. E.of the PAM. A tentative list of the associated initiatives 
includes the following compulsory and optional productivity- and impact-enhancing initiatives for 
each type of infrastructure (see tables in the next page).

Train beneficiaries and selected DAFO staff in procedures for 
establishing WUGs outlining the roles and responsibilities for officials 
appointed to management positions therein. Training will cover essential 
steps needed but will also develop communications skills, ensure gender 
equity, address participation of disadvantaged households and be 
inclusive of all ethnic groups. 
Depending on the nature and complexity of structures, there will be a 
requirement for different levels of services and responsibilities in 
maintaining and operating the irrigation systems. To maintain their 
functioning, irrigation service fees must be set at realistic levels and need 
to be agreed to by all water users. Training will be provided in the 
considerations for setting and approaches for collecting and 
transparently managing irrigation service fees. 
While essentially simple to operate, there will remain issues of water 
management, gate management, water release, reservoir cleaning etc. 
that need to be programmed and agreed to by all beneficiaries. Practical 
training will ensure those responsible for these functions are fully 
competent.  All users need to understand and agree to water allocations 
so that downstream users have access to agreed water flows. 
Train villagers and village authorities in the establishment and operations 
of village maintenance committees outlining the roles and responsibilities 
for officials appointed to management positions therein. Training will 
cover essential steps needed but will also develop communications 
skills, ensure gender equity and address participation of disadvantaged 
and other ethnic groups within the village committee. 
Depending on the nature and complexity of alignments (including 
drainage structures and embankments) being rehabilitated, there will be 
a requirement for different levels of maintenance to keep the road in 
functional condition. Local resources – the primary beneficiaries will be 
expected to contribute labor in executing routine maintenance activities. 
The training will include the development of routine maintenance 
activities and the method for assigning responsibility for each section of 
the road to be rehabilitated together with the development of a

towards the rehabilitated irrigation scheme, to ensure the sustainable 
provision of environmental catchment services and to secure the 
investment. 
Will be conducted in the villages/ kumbans within the water catchment to 
translate catchment zoning into applicable and community based land 
and natural resource management including appropriate land use 
practices, to protect environment functions and to ensure sustainable 
livelihoods. 
Will be conducted for the land parcels within the rehabilitated or 
extended irrigation scheme to ensure land tenure security for involved 
villagers and to secure the investment. Land titles to be in both spouses’ 
names. 
Will be conducted in all villages in the water catchment, to raise 
awareness on environmental functions and biodiversity, but also on 
rights and responsibilities of villagers related to different land uses 
including forests.  
Enforcement of land-use plans 
and related regulation 
Will be conducted in all villages of the catchment after PLUP has been 
implemented and results were approved by authorities, to enforce

The  government  has  requested  a  grant  not  exceeding  $35.6  million  from  ADB’s  Special 
Funds resources as additional financing to help finance the overall project. The grant will fund PRI 
subprojects  (including  associated  initiatives),  capacity  building,  project  management  and 
consulting services, inclusive of the applicable taxes and  duties.10  The government will  finance 
the  equivalent  of  $2.0 million for salaries of full-time permanent counterpart staff, office space, 
land  acquisition  and  resettlement  costs,  and  the  clearing  of  unexploded  ordnance  and  land 
mines,  inclusive  of  applicable  taxes  and  duties.  The  government  will  make  the  grant  proceeds 
available to the EA and implementing agencies on a grant basis. The financing plan is presented 
in Table 5. 
9 No physical contingencies are provided in the civil works contracts of the current project. All the contract variations, 
when needed, are done within the contract amount. 
10 ADB  will  finance  taxes  and  duties  for  the  expenditure  items  it  covers,  operating  costs  (i.e.,  incremental  project 
management  costs  but  not  include  any  salaries  or  remuneration  other  than  travel  costs  and  daily  subsistence 
allowance for government officials who work for the project), transportation costs, and interest and bank charges 
related  to  the  imprest  account.  The  following  principles  were  followed  in  determining  taxes  and  duties  to  be 
financed  by  ADB:  (i)  the  amount  does  not  represent  an  excessive  share  of  the  project;  (ii)  the  taxes  and  duties 
apply  only  to  ADB-financed  expenditures;  (iii)  the  amount  is  within  the  thresholds  identified  during  the  country 
partnership strategy preparation process; and (iv) financing of taxes and duties is material and relevant to  project 
success.

A. 
Financial Management Assessment 
FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT 
52. 
The financial  management  assessment  (FMA)  was conducted  in accordance  with ADB 
guidelines.  The  FMA  covers  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Forestry  (MAF)  as  the  executing 
agency (EA) and the provincial agriculture and forestry office (PAFO) of participating provinces 
as the implementing agencies (IA). The objective of the assessment was to determine whether 
the entities implementing the project have acceptable financial management arrangements that 
can comply with ADB accounting and reporting requirements. The previous FMA for MAF and 
participating  PAFOs  was  completed  in  preparation  of  L3198-LAO:    Northern  Smallholder 
Livestock Commercialization Project (2014). 
53. 
According  to  the  latest  available  assessments  by  ADB  and  World  Bank,  the  overall 
fiduciary risk in the Lao PDR is considered high. This is due to insufficient transparency over the 
use of public finances and limited public access to government budget and financial information. 
In addition there is generally low awareness of modern practices of internal controls in the public 
sector. The financial management capacity of government staff at provincial and district levels is 
very  weak  and  needs  to  be  strengthened.  The  external  audit  oversight  function  by  the  State 
Audit Organization (SAO) also needs improvement. There is a lack of well-trained and qualified 
local  accountants  and  auditors  in  the  country.  There  is  reportedly  a  widely  held  public 
perception  that  the  government  is  not  committed  to  implementing  reforms,  despite  recent 
passage of laws and decrees aimed at strengthening public financial management. The level of 
corruption is perceived to be high according to investigations and survey results by international 
civil society and research organizations. 
54. 
At  the  country  level,  deficiencies  in  financial  management  systems  include:  (i)  weak 
public  financial  management  (PFM)  systems;  (ii)  a  shortage  of  personnel  with  adequate 
financial management skills; and (iii) the failure of procuring entities to follow PFM rules. At the 
project-specific  level,  potential  risks  include:  (i)  possible  inability  of  government  to  meet 
51 
counterpart  funding  obligations  due  to  budgetary  constraints;  (ii)  limited  procurement  capacity 
within the EA and IAs; (iii) potential for corruption as a result of weak procurement oversight; (iv) 
funds  may  not  reach  intended  beneficiaries  in  a  timely  manner;  (v)  project  accounting  and 
financial  reporting  will  not  meet  ADB  requirements;  (vi)  delays  in  the  submission  of  externally 
audited project accounts due to the heavy SAO workload; (vi) annual audits will not meet ADB 
requirements;  and  (vii)  inadequate  safeguard  of  accounting  data.  Without  risk  mitigation 
measures, the overall risk level for the project is assessed as high. 
The  MAF and participating  PAFOs  have  extensive experience in the  implementation  of 
55. 
externally funded projects, including those funded by ADB. Mitigating measures to address the 
shortcomings include: (i) existing national project management office (NPMO), provincial project 
offices  (PPO)  and  their  staff  under  the  current  project 12 will  be  used  in  the  overall  project; 
(existing  staff  are  experienced  and  familiar  with  ADB  accounting,  financial  reporting  and 
procurement requirements); (ii) existing project oversight bodies (i.e. the national and provincial 
project  steering  committees)  will  be  used;  (iii)  ADB  bidding,  procurement  and  disbursement 
guidelines  will  be  used;  (iv)  counterpart  funding  will  involve  mainly  in-kind  support  for 
government  counterpart  salaries  and  office  space,  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  costs; 
taxes  and  duties  will  be  financed  by  the  grant;  (v)  training  and  on-the-job  mentoring  of  new 
accounts staff on ADB project accounting and financial reporting by experienced accounts staff 
and  financial  management  consultants;  (vi)  funds  flow  arrangements  similar  to  the  current 
project,  which  have  been  tested  and  proven  successful,  will  be  used;  (vii)  accounting  policies 
consistent  with  International  Accounting  Standards  and  International  Financial  Reporting 
Standards  will  be  used;  (viii)  NPMO  will  recruit  an  external  auditor  whose  qualifications, 
experience  and  TOR  are  acceptable to  ADB;  annual  external  audit  will  be  in  accordance  with 
international  auditing  standards;  and  (ix)  regular  backups  of  all  financial  and  accounting  data 
and  appropriate  security  measures  over  backed-up  data  shall  be  in  place. With  risk  mitigation 
measures, the risk level for the overall project is assessed as low. 
B. 
Disbursement 
The  grant  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  Loan  Disbursement 
56. 
Handbook  (2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time),  and  detailed  arrangements  agreed  upon 
between the government and ADB. Online training for project staff on disbursement policies and 
procedures  is  available  at:    http://wpqr4.adb.org/disbursement_elearning.  Project  staff  are 
encouraged to avail of this training to help ensure efficient disbursement and fiduciary control. 
Disbursements  will  be  made  using  the  direct  payment  procedure,  reimbursement  and 
57. 
imprest  fund  procedure.  Disbursements  for  the  grant  shall  be  managed  through  separate 
imprest and sub-accounts which are separate from that of the current project's accounts. 
Imprest  Fund  Procedure.  To  ensure  the  timely  release  of  grant  proceeds  and  to 
58. 
expedite  project  implementation,  the  government  will,  immediately  upon  grant  effectiveness, 
open  and  maintain  an  imprest  account  at  the  Bank  of  Lao.  The  MOF  will  be  responsible  for 
establishing, managing, replenishing, and liquidating the imprest account. The imprest account 
will  be  in  US  dollar.  The  imprest  account  will  be  used  exclusively  for  ADB's  share  of  eligible 
expenditures. This will be used to meet national level project costs including consulting services 
contracts  and  PRI  subproject  works.  The  total  outstanding  advance  to  the  imprest  account 
should not exceed the estimate of ADB's share of expenditures to be paid through the imprest

account for the forthcoming six months. The imprest account will be replenished in accordance 
with  standard  procedures  outlined  in  the  ADB’s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2015,  as 
amended  from  time  to  time).  The  MOF,  who  established  the  imprest  account  in  its  name,  is 
accountable  and  responsible  for  proper  use  of  advances  to  the  imprest  account,  including 
advances to the sub-accounts. 
59. 
The  request  for  the  initial  and  additional  advances  to  the  imprest  account  should  be 
accompanied  by  an  estimate  of  expenditure  sheet13 setting  out  the  estimated  expenditures  for 
the  forthcoming  six  months  of  project  implementation.  Supporting  documents  for  every 
liquidation  and  replenishment  of  the  imprest  account,  are  (a)  Statement  of  Account  (Bank 
Statement) where the imprest account is maintained, and (b) the Imprest Account Reconciliation 
Statement (IARS) reconciling the above mentioned bank statement against the EA’s records.14 
60. 
Funds  in  the  imprest  account  will  be  used  to establish advances in  five  sub-accounts. 
Sub-accounts  will  be  established  in  a  commercial  bank  acceptable  to  ADB.  These  will  be 
opened and managed by NPMO and the four PPOs in the provinces of Bokeo, Luang Namtha, 
Oudomxai  and  Phongsali.  The  sub-accounts  are  to  be  used  exclusively  for  ADB's  share  of 
eligible expenditures. Sub-accounts are intended to provide cash resources for the operations of 
the  NPMO  and  PPOs, and will be liquidated and  replenished with the submission  of sufficient 
documents as  outlined  in ADB’s Loan Disbursement Handbook. 
Statement  of  Expenditures  Procedure  (SOE).15 The SOE procedure may be used for 
61. 
reimbursement  of  eligible  expenses  or  liquidation/replenishment  of  advances  to  the  imprest 
account.  All  supporting  documents  and  records  should  be  maintained  and  made  readily 
available  for  inspection  by  ADB's  disbursement  and  review  missions,  upon  ADB's  request  for 
submission of supporting documents on a sampling basis, and for independent audit. NPMO will 
be responsible for ensuring that SOEs are operated in accordance with ADB's requirement. 
Before the submission of the first withdrawal application, the MOF should submit to ADB 
62. 
sufficient evidence of the authority of the person(s) who will sign the withdrawal applications on 
behalf of the borrower, together with the authenticated specimen signatures of each authorized 
person.  The  minimum  value  per  withdrawal  application  is  US$100,000  equivalent;  individual 
payments below this amount should be paid (i) by the EA/IA and subsequently claimed to ADB 
through reimbursement, or  (ii)  through the  imprest fund procedure,  unless  otherwise accepted 
by ADB. 
C. 
Accounting  
63. 
The  NPMO and PPOs  will  maintain  separate  project  accounts  and  records  by  funding 
source  for  all  expenditures  incurred  on  the  project.  The  NPMO  will  prepare  project  financial 
statements  in  accordance  with  government  accounting  laws  and  regulations  which  are 
consistent with international accounting principles and practices.

D. 
Auditing and Public Disclosure 
64. 
The  NPMO  will  cause  the  detailed  consolidated  project  accounts  to  be  audited  in 
accordance  with  International  Standards  on  Auditing  by  an  independent  auditor  acceptable  to 
ADB. The audited accounts, together with the auditor's opinion, will be submitted in the English 
language to  ADB  within  6  months  of  the end  of the  fiscal  year  by  the  executing  agency.  The 
annual  audit  report  will  include  a  management  letter  and  auditor’s  opinions,  which  cover  (i) 
whether  the  project  financial  statements  present  an  accurate  and  fair  view  or  are  presented 
fairly, in all material respects, in accordance with the applicable financial reporting standards; (ii) 
whether  the  proceeds  of  the  grant  were  used  only  for  the  purpose(s)  of  the  project;  and  (iii) 
whether  the  borrower  or  executing  agency  was  in  compliance  with  the  financial  covenants 
contained in the grant agreement (where applicable).  
65. 
Compliance  with  financial  reporting  and  auditing  requirements  will  be  monitored  by 
review  missions  and  during  normal  program  supervision,  and  followed  up  regularly  with  all 
concerned, including the external auditor. 
66. 
The  government  and  the  NPMO  have  been  made  aware  of  ADB’s  policy  on  delayed 
submission,  and  the  requirements  for  satisfactory  and  acceptable  quality  of  the  audited 
accounts  (covering  failure  of  submitting  audited  accounts  and  financial  statements  by  the  due 
dates).  ADB reserves the right to require a change in the auditor (in a manner consistent with 
the  constitution  of  the  borrower),  or  for  additional  support  to  be  provided  to  the  auditor,  if  the 
audits  required  are  not  conducted  in  a  manner  satisfactory  to  ADB,  or  if  the  audits  are 
substantially delayed. ADB reserves the right to verify the project's financial accounts to confirm 
that the share of ADB’s financing is used in accordance with ADB’s policies and procedures. 
67. 
Public  disclosure  of  the  audited  project  financial  statements,  including  the  auditor’s 
opinion  on  the  project  financial  statements,  will  be  guided  by  ADB’s  Public  Communications 
Policy  2011.16 After  the  review,  ADB  will  disclose  the  audited  project  financial  statements  and 
the  opinion  of  the  auditors  on  the  project  financial  statements  no  later  than  14  days  of  ADB’s 
confirmation  of  their  acceptability  by  posting  them  on  ADB’s  website.  The  management  letter, 
additional auditor’s opinions, and audited entity financial statements will not be disclosed.17

PROCUREMENT AND CONSULTING SERVICES 
A. 
Advance Contracting  
All  advance  contracting  will  be  undertaken  in  conformity  with  ADB’s  Procurement 
68. 
Guidelines  (2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  ADB’s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of 
Consultants  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Any  issuance  of  invitation  to  bid  under 
advance  contracting  will  be  subject  to  ADB  approval.  The  borrower,  NPMO  and  PPOs  have 
been advised that approval of advance contracting does not commit ADB to finance the scope 
of works under the overall project. 
69. 
The overall project will continue to utilize the institutional and procurement arrangements 
already established under the current project, including the provision of key central, provincial, 
and district staff.  
70. 
The  project  management  has  been  supported  by  the  grant  implementation  consultants 
(GIC) through a firm recruited under the current project. The GIC are judged to have provided 
highly satisfactory services by the EA. The services needed to support the additional financing 
represent a natural continuation of the previous work carried out by the firm and the continuity of 
consulting  services  is  in the  overall  interest  of  project  implementation  and  enhances  economy 
and  efficiency.  Therefore  the  services  of  the  GIC  will  be  extended  to  cover  the  new  project 
scope, through a contract variation18 The NPMO will conduct advance action for the negotiation 
of  a  contract  variation  with  GIC.  It  is  anticipated  that  the  contract  variation  will  be  ready  for 
signing immediately upon effectiveness of the additional financing. 
71. 
The EA conducted advance action for the recruitment of the engineering consulting firm 
to  conduct  detailed  design  work,  bidding  and  bid  evaluation  for  the  civil  works  for  the  two 
representative  PRI  subprojects.  Contract  to  the  successful  engineering  design  firm  was 
awarded in September 2016. . 
B. 
Procurement of Goods, Works and Consulting Services 
All  procurement  of  goods  and  works  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB’s 
72. 
Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time).  
Civil work packages will comprise the rehabilitation and improvement of PRI located in 
73. 
the provinces of Bokeo, Luang-Namtha, Oudomxai and Phongsali. Packages for works valued 
at less than $3.0 million but more than $100,000 or equivalent shall be procured following NCB 
procedures described in Annex C. For works below $100,000 equivalent, shopping procedures 
may be followed. Packages for goods costing less than $1,000,000 equivalent but more than 
$100,000  shall  be  procured  through  NCB  procedures.  Smaller  packages  for  goods  valued  at 
less than $100,000 may be procured using shopping procedures. Smaller packages for goods 
valued at less than $10,000 may be procured using direct contracting procedures. 
74. 
Before  the  start  of  any  procurement,  ADB  and  the  government  will  review  the  public 
procurement  laws  of  the  central  and  state  governments  to  ensure  consistency  with  ADB’s 
Procurement Guidelines. 
18 GIC terms of reference are presented in Annex D. 
55 
The procurement capacity assessment (PCA) concludes that there is a low risk rating for 
75. 
the overall project. However, the PCA notes that the contractual arrangement for the civil works 
under the current project (Employer-Engineer-Contractor) leaves GIC with little scope to ensure 
quality control. The PCA recommends that provision will be made in the civil works contract for 
GIC  to  serve  as  the  employer’s  agent  in  overseeing  civil  works  construction  and  providing 
quality control. 
C. 
Procurement Plan 
The  procurement  plan  has  been  prepared 
76. 
in  accordance  with  ADB’s  generic 
procurement  template,  and  tailored  to  suit  the  country  specific  needs  as  assessed  and 
presented in the procurement capacity assessment. The project shall retain competent staff for 
all  procurement  and recruitment  functions  and  shall  consult  with  ADB  on  any  staff  changes  in 
this  regard.  A  complete  detailed  and  an  18-month  procurement  plan  indicating  threshold  and 
review  procedures,  goods,  works,  and  consulting  service  contract  packages  and  national 
competitive bidding guidelines is in Annex C. 
D. 
Consultant's Terms of Reference 
77. 
All consultants/organizations will be recruited according to ADB's Guidelines on the Use 
of  Consultants  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).19 The  project  will  require  a  number  of 
consulting services to assist NPMO, PPOs and DCOs, as follows: 
 
 
 
 
GIC will have a total input of 414 person-months, comprising 81 person-months 
of  international  expertise  and  333  person-months  of  national  expertise.  The 
following criteria will be observed in preparing the contract variation: (i) There will 
be minimal changes to the team composition; (ii) The rates to be used in the VO 
will be based on the original GIC contract rates; and (iii) No further extension to 
the new contract will be considered. 
Engineering  Consulting  Firm  (ECF)  will  be  recruited  through  consultants’ 
qualification  selection  (CQS)  procedures  to  assist  with  the  detailed  design, 
bidding and contract award, contract administration and construction supervision. 
It  is  anticipated  that  there  will  be  nine  (9)  consulting  packages  covering  the 
additional 22 PRI subprojects, with a total input of around 300 person-months of 
national expertise.  
impact  assessment  consultants  will  be  recruited  through  CQS 
Social 
procedures  to  assist  with  the  preparation  of  the  feasibility  studies  (FS).  It  is 
anticipated  that  three  (3)  consulting  packages  (one  package  for  each  of  the 
Phase II, Phase III, Phase IV) covering the additional 20 PRI subprojects will be 
recruited with a total input of around 75 person-months of national expertise.20  
An external safeguards monitor will also be recruited through CQS procedures 
to provide an independent and overall assessment of safeguard activities under 
the  project.  It  is  anticipated  that  there  will  be  one  package  covering  all  22  PRI 
subprojects, with a total input of around 40 person months of national expertise.  
19 Checklists  for  actions  required  to  contract  consultants  by  method  available  in  e-Handbook  on  Project    
Implementation at: http://www.adb.org/documents/handbooks/project-implementation/  
20  Social  impact  assessments  for  the  two  sample  subprojects  have  already  been  completed  under  the  PPTA 
(TA8882-LAO: Northern Rural Infrastructure Development Sector Project – Due Diligence of Additional Financing).  
56 
 
 
Financial  Auditor. The current project finances have been audited by the State 
Audit  Organization  (SAO).  The  cost  of  using  the  SAO  is  covered  by  the  project 
operating  budget.  It  is  expected  that  this  arrangement  will  continue  into  overall 
project. However, in the event the SAO is not available to provide this service a 
provision in the procurement plan has been made to recruit a qualified audit firm 
using one CQS package with an estimated input of 15 person months of national 
expertise. 
Provision  has  also  been  made  under  the  additional  financing for  the  conduct  of 
an  irrigation  subsector  review.  An  international  firm  will  be  recruited  in 
accordance  with  the  fixed  budget  selection  procedures  as  set  out  in  ADB’s 
Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. A total of around 14 person-months input 
will be required over a period of around six (6) months.

79. 
The  primary  focus  of  the  overall  project  is  to  improve  agriculture  productivity  and  forge 
linkages  with  local  and  international  markets  for  raw  and  processed  agricultural  goods  and 
capabilities to sustain it. This will be achieved mainly through improvements to existing PRI and by 
means  of  associated  initiatives that  will  facilitate improved  productivity  and benefit to smallholders 
support  to  community  based  organizations  such  as  producer  groups  and  WUGs.  Potential  PRI 
subprojects  have  been  pre-screened  to  ensure  conformity  with  project  criteria  which  include  strict 
adherence to safeguard regulations of ADB and the government, including environmental and social 
impact on the population in general and on vulnerable groups in particular. Criteria for selection of 
PRI  subprojects  virtually  eliminated  PRI  subprojects  with  potential  significant 
impact  on 
environment,  and  resettlement  and  land  compensation  matters.  Consideration  was  also  given 
during the PRI subproject selection process to ensure that women and vulnerable groups as well as 
ethnic  minorities  would  derive  significant  benefits  from  the  selected  PRI  subprojects  and  that  any 
potential negative impact could be mitigated. 
A. 
Resettlement 
80. 
Overall,  little  impact  is  anticipated  from  resettlement  since  PRI  subprojects  comprise 
rehabilitation  of  existing  infrastructure,  involving  existing  irrigation  systems  that  do  not  require 
significant  land  acquisition.  Furthermore,  PRI  subprojects  have  been  pre-screened  during  the 
preparation stage to ensure they do not entail significant resettlement. Only category B and C PRI 
subprojects will be eligible for financing under the overall project. 
81.  Most of the civil works will involve rehabilitation of existing irrigation facilities and construction 
work will be carried out primarily within the existing rights-of-way. The most likely resettlement issue 
will come from relocation of delivery canals to improve water utilization efficiency. In such cases, it is 
likely  that  alternative land  can  be  provided in a suitable location  to  the affected  persons  within the 
command area. There is provision in the resettlement framework to accept and formalize voluntary 
land  donations  for  scheme  improvements.  There  will  also  be  some  temporary  loss  of  production 
during  the  dry  season  requiring  compensation  but  as  the  purpose  of  most  small  scale  irrigation 
schemes  is  primarily  to complement  wet  season  water  supplies,  the  impact  during  the  dry  season 
when works will be undertaken will be minimal. Furthermore, the participation of local beneficiaries 
during  the  detailed  design  phase  will  minimize  the  impact  from  both  lost  production  and  land 
replacement. 
There may  be  a few  times  where  a pre-screened  PRI  subproject  is found  during the  FS  to 
82. 
present  more  significant  resettlement  issues  which  cannot  be  mitigated,  the  PRI   subproject  will 
be replaced by a new PRI which meets the eligibility criteria. In such a case, if a new PRI subproject 
is  proposed  which  was  not  included  in  the  list  of  eligible  PRI  subprojects,  pre-screening  will  be 
undertaken by a consultant acceptable to ADB to ensure its conformity with PRI subproject  eligibility 
criteria.  Any  voluntary  land  donation  or  minor  compensation  that  may  be  needed  will  be 
provided  in  accordance  with  resettlement  plans  prepared  for  each  PRI  subproject  based  upon 
the  guidelines  outlined  in  the  resettlement  framework  agreed  with  the  government  (linked 
document  12).  Qualified  safeguard  officers  will  be  appointed  in  each  PPO  to  ensure  conformity 
with  the  resettlement  plans  prepared  for  each  PRI  subproject  (as  appropriate).  They  will  be 
supported by independent safeguard monitoring entities that will be engaged by the NPMO. 
B. 
Environmental Impact 
83. 
An  environment  assessment  and  review  framework  has  been  agreed  with  the  government 
(linked  document  11)  which  has  been  used  to  prepare  initial  environmental  examination  and 
environmental management plan for the two RSPs. Based on these samples, and given the extent 
58 
through 
impacts 
that  cannot  be  mitigated 
of  PRI  subproject  pre-screening  that  has taken  place  during  preparation, there  is  little  likelihood  of 
having  significant  negative  environmental 
the 
implementation  of  EMPs.  For  irrigation  rehabilitation  and  development,  FS  will  assess  permissible 
quantities  of  water  offtake  during  the  dry  season  to  allow  sufficient  flows  to  maintain  the  riparian 
ecosystem and ensure there are adequate resources for downstream users. The introduction of land 
zoning  in  catchment  areas  of  reservoirs  will  minimize  inappropriate  land  use  activities  within  the 
catchment and reduce the risk of siltation of streams while assuring dry season flows. Environment 
“category A” PRI subprojects will be ineligible and will not be financed under the overall project. Any 
PRI  subproject  which  may  be  reclassified  under  category  A  for  environment  during  the  FS  will  be 
removed from the list of eligible PRI subprojects and will be replaced by a new PRI subproject which 
meets  the  eligibility  criteria.  In  such  a  case,  similar  to  resettlement,  if  a  new  PRI  subproject  is 
proposed  which  was  not  included  in  the  list  of  eligible  PRI  subprojects,  pre-screening  will  be 
undertaken by a consultant acceptable to ADB to ensure its conformity with PRI subproject eligibility 
criteria.  Support  in  the  preparation  of  consistent  and  well  thought  out  environmental  assessments 
and  management  plan  preparation  for  each  PRI  subproject  will  be  provided  at  national  and 
provincial levels. 
C. 
Ethnic Groups  
84. 
The ethnic group development framework has been developed for the overall project (linked 
document  13)  and  sets  out  the  requirements  for  pre-screening  of  PRI  subprojects  and  for 
processes  to  be  followed  in  the  preparation  of  each  of  the  PRI  subprojects.  The  analysis  found 
that  ethnic  groups  are  the  majority  population  in  participating  provinces  and  that  certain 
groups  have  significantly  higher  levels  of  poverty  and  associated  disadvantages.  The  main 
concerns  are  communication  difficulties,  particularly  for  women,  together  with  opportunity  to 
access  project  benefits.  Mitigation  measures  include  effective  consultation  requirements  and 
positive  discrimination  for  employment  during  the  construction  phase;  membership  of  committees; 
and capacity building for disadvantaged and vulnerable ethnic groups.  All monitoring and evaluation 
data will be disaggregated for the four major ethno-linguistic groups. 
85. 
The  overall  project  will  focus  on  rehabilitation  of  existing  irrigation  systems  and  roads  and 
therefore  will  not  be  involved  in  sequestration  of  any  land  that  could  be  considered  ‘ancestral 
domains’. Any lands that are required will be for infrastructure works and as these are rehabilitative 
works  areas  requirement  will  be  minimal  and  will  be  dealt  with  through  routine  resettlement 
procedures.  Pre-screening  procedures  for  each  PRI  subproject  have  eliminated  those  PRI 
subprojects that will result in negative impacts to ethnic groups.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
86. 
The  following  table  sets  out  the  specific  elements  to  be  addressed  in  each  ethnic  group 
development  plan  (EGDP)  and  it  should  be  noted  that  many  of  these  are  similar  to  those  in  the 
gender action plan (GAP) to support a combined GAP/EGDP, where appropriate.

  GENDER AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS 
87. 
The Eight National Socio-Economic Development Plan has a focus on inclusive growth 
in  rural  areas,  supporting  infrastructure  and  improved  natural  resource  management.  This 
strategy is reflected in the current Asian Development Bank (ADB) Country Partnership Strategy 
(CPS) 2012-2016. As described in the summary poverty reduction and social strategy (SPRSS, 
linked  document  9),  the  proposed  additional  financing  supports  increased  productivity  and 
commercialization  in  agriculture  by  addressing recognized  constraints, targeting improvements 
that  have  a  proven  positive  impact  on  productivity  and  addressing  the  disparity  between  rural 
and  urban  poverty.  It  will  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  through  geographic  and  sector 
targeting.  Bokeo,  Luang  Namtha,  Oudomxai,  and  Phongsali  have  prevalent  rural  poverty  but 
also  the  potential  to  increase  surplus  production.  They  are  strategically  located  for  trade  with 
neighboring countries that have current unmet demand for agricultural produce. 
88. 
The  overall  project  aims  to  improve  agriculture  productivity  in  four  northern  provinces 
through provision of infrastructure and associated initiatives. The overall project is classified as 
‘Effective Gender Mainstreaming’ under the ADB guidelines of March 2010. 
The  overall  project  can  provide  women

infrastructure that will increase productivity and incomes, improve mobility, empower women by 
creating opportunities to participate in decision-making, lessen women's work burdens and save

opportunity  sharing  between  men  and  women;  (ii)  systematic  approach  to  reduce  gender 
inequalities  in the  overall  project  areas;  (iii)  targeted  approach  for  women  of  ethnic  minorities; 
(iv) collection of gender disaggregated data including benefit monitoring and evaluation; and (v) 
increased representation of women in decision-making bodies at all levels. The gender-inclusive 
design elements are based on the principles and are in response to constraints faced by women 
as demonstrated in the social and gender analysis. Where appropriate, MAF gender targets are 
taken from the MAF Strategy to 2020 integrated (gender) strategy. The overview of the GAP is 
as follows:

Monitoring 
1. 
Project performance monitoring 
91. 
A  PBME  system  has  been  developed  and  implemented  by  NPMO  and  is  operating 
satisfactorily.  PBME  collects  information  at  PRI  subproject  level  to  identify  the  current  socio-
economic  conditions  of  target  beneficiaries  and  to  assess  the  impact  of  the  PRI  subprojects. 
PBME is based on measurable inputs, outputs and outcomes collected during baseline surveys 
and throughout project implementation. This system will continue under the overall project. 
2.

No.140/PM  dated  20  August  2002  and  guideline  paper  No.  018/PMO  of  10  January  2005, 
will  be  disaggregated  by  sex  and  age,  urban  and  rural  women,  and  women  of  ethnic 
groups.  Routine  monitoring  by  the  safeguard  monitoring  entity  to  be  recruited  under  the 
overall  project  will  focus  on  assessing  progress  and  compliance  with  GAPs,  identifying 
constraints  and  developing  remedial  actions  to  effectively  address  these.  Monitoring  results 
with be part of the semi-annual progress reports  and assessment/evaluations of the GAP will 
be an essential element of all reviews.

capacity  building  progress,  and  possible  reallocation  of  grant  proceeds.  During  this  more 
significant review, the impact from the  pro-poor initiatives  linked  to  infrastructure  development 
will  be  assessed  as  will  the  allocation  by  local  administrations  for  the  maintenance  of  the 
infrastructure  developed  under  the  overall  project.  Remedial  action  will  be  instituted  as 
required. 
98. 
Within  12  months  of  physical  completion  of  the  overall  project,  ADB  will  conduct  a 
project completion mission to carry out a preliminary assessment of the success of the Overall 
Project  to  achieve  its  physical,  and  socio-economic  developmental  objectives,  as  well  as  to 
review compliance with ADB requirements and grant covenants. 
D. 
Reporting 
99. 
NPMO  will  provide  ADB  with  (i)  quarterly  progress  reports  in  a  format  consistent with 
ADB's  project  performance  reporting  system;  (ii)  consolidated  annual  reports  including  (a) 
68 
progress  achieved  by  output  as  measured  through  the  DMF  indicator's  performance  targets, 
(b)  key  implementation  issues  and  solutions;  (c)  updated  procurement  plan  and  (d)  updated 
implementation  plan for next  12  months;  (iii)  semi-annual  Safeguards  Monitoring  Reports;  and 
(iv)  a  project  completion  report  within  six  months  of  physical  completion  of  the  project.  To 
ensure  PRI  subprojects continue to be  both viable  and sustainable,  project  accounts  and  the 
executing  agency  audited  financial  statements,  together  with  the  associated  auditor's  report, 
should be adequately reviewed. 
E. 
Stakeholder Communication Strategy 
1. 
Consultation 
100.  The  overall  project  is  designed  to  improve  the  welfare  of  rural  inhabitants  in  the  four 
participating provinces of Bokeo, Louang-Namtha, Oudomxai and Phongsali through a series of 
investments  in  PRI  aimed  to  improve  agriculture  productivity  and  market  efficiency  together 
with improved access to and use of materials, knowledge, production inputs and markets. 
Project preparation has been conducted with stakeholder agencies in the Government 
101. 
of Lao PDR at national, provincial and district levels including MAF, MPI and MONRE. Meetings 
have  also  been  held  in  the  participating  provinces  with  PAFO  and  DAFO  officials,  as  well  as 
WUGs  focusing  on  irrigation/water  management  arrangements  and  issues.  Requirements  for 
ensuring appropriate levels of consultation for  PRI subproject proposal preparation which were 
established for the current project have been reviewed and confirmed.

103.  During  implementation,  the  process  of  consultation  will  continue  throughout  the  FS 
and detailed design phase of each PRI subproject to afford community groups the opportunity to 
voice  their  views  on  how  the  PRI  subproject  is  to  be  designed,  implemented  and  operated. 
In  addition,  associated  initiatives  will  be  built  into  the  design  of  each  PRI  subproject  to 
enhance  the  impact  from  and  sustainability  of  investments  in  rural  infrastructure.  These 
associated  initiatives  will  be  identified  in  a  participatory  manner  from  a  menu  of  options 
developed  with  the  respective  stakeholders  and  beneficiaries  and  will  strengthen  community-
based organizations such as  the WUGs, the women’s unions, village mediation units, producers 
and marketing groups, and  input supply groups. 
2. 
Participation 
104. 
It is anticipated that the community will be mobilized in a number of different ways during 
PRI  subproject  design,  implementation  and  operation.  During  PRI  subproject  design  and 
preparation  stages,  community  participation  will  consist  primarily  of  their  contribution  through 
the  consultation  process.  During  construction,  there  will  be  significant  opportunities  for  active 
participation,  particularly  for  the  poor  households  who  will  benefit  from  the  PRI  subproject 
through provision of wage labor  to the contractors. This will be encouraged through the bidding 
documents which will request the contractors to investigate this option, whenever possible.  The 
community  will  also  be  required  to  participate  in  the  O&M  of  the  completed  infrastructure 
whenever possible through provision of labor or in some cases funds. 
69 
3. 
Awareness 
105. 
Information about the overall project and the PRI subprojects in particular, including the 
objectives,  potential  environmental  impact,  implementation  arrangements,  resettlement  and 
compensation matters, gender  issues,  issues  of concerns for  ethnic  groups  will  be  provided to 
beneficiaries.  Information  will  be  provided  through  village  meetings,  pamphlets,  and  other 
announcements  in  both  Lao  language  and  the  language(s)  of  the  communities  whenever 
appropriate.  The community  will be fully informed of issues such as their right to participate in 
the  PRI subprojects  and to  be  compensated for any  loss of  property  including  productive land 
and/or  assets  as  well  as  gender  equity  and  other  relevant  policies.  Separate  meetings  and 
discussions  will  be  arranged  with  the  people  who  are  directly  affected  by  land  acquisition 
and/or  resettlement  issues.  The  community  and  particularly  the  affected  households  will  be 
provided with detailed guidance and procedures regarding resettlement and compensation.

ANTICORRUPTION POLICY  
107.  Under the current project, ADB’s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was 
explained  to  and  discussed  with  MAF  and  Governor’s  offices  of  Bokeo,  Louang-Namtha, 
Oudomxai and Phongsali. The provisions of this policy have been reiterated to MAF under the 
overall  project.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and 
transparency ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any violations 
of the Anticorruption Policy relating to the project.21 All contracts financed by ADB shall include 
provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the 
executing agency and all project contractors, suppliers, consultants and other service providers. 
Individuals/entities  on  ADB’s  anticorruption  debarment  list  are  ineligible  to  participate  in  ADB- 
financed activity and may not be awarded any contracts under the overall project.22 
108.  To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB’s Anticorruption Policy are included 
in  the  grant  agreement  and  the  bidding  documents  for  the  overall  project.  In  particular,  all 
contracts  financed  by  ADB  in  connection  with  the  overall  project  shall  include  provisions 
specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of MAF, NPMO, the 
PPOs, and DCOs, as well as all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers 
as they relate to the overall project. Individuals/ entities on ADB’s anticorruption debarment list 
are  ineligible  to  participate  in  ADB-  financed  activity  and  may  not  be  awarded  any  contracts 
under  the  overall  project.23 The  project  design  and  implementation  arrangements  provide  for 
mitigation of corruption risks. Risks associated with project management, including procurement 
and  disbursement,  will  be  mitigated  by  the  engagement  of  GIC  to  advise  and  assist  in  the 
procurement  of  goods  and  services,  and  the  engagement  of  other  consultants.  The  overall 
project will continue to operate the website established under the current project or a subpage 
under  the  existing  MAF’s  website  in  which  it  will  disclose  implementation  progress;  bid 
notifications  and  their  results;  and  provide  grievance  redress  mechanism  against  any  corrupt 
practice. References on ADB's Anticorruption Policy can be accessed through the following link:

ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISM 
109.  People who  are,  or may  in the future  be,  adversely  affected  by the  overall  project  may 
submit complaints to ADB’s Accountability Mechanism. The accountability mechanism provides 
an  independent  forum  and  process  whereby  people  adversely  affected  by  ADB-assisted 
projects can voice, and seek a resolution of their problems, as well as report alleged violations 
of  ADB’s  operational  policies  and  procedures.  Before  submitting  a  complaint  to 
the 
accountability  mechanism,  affected  people  should  make  a  good  faith  effort  to  solve  their 
problems by working with the concerned ADB operations department.  Only after doing that, and 
if they are still dissatisfied, should they approach the accountability mechanism.24 
RECORD OF PAM CHANGES  
110.  All  revisions/updates  during  course  of  implementation  will  be  recorded  under  this 
chapter.  The  PAM  was  discussed  during  the  negotiation  for  additional  financing  held  in 
Vientiane, Lao PDR on 15 November 2016.

A. 
Introduction and Background 
1. 
The  aide  memoire  of  the  mid-term  review  for  the  G0235-LAO:  Northern  Rural 
Infrastructure  Development  Sector  Project  (the  current  project),  done  in  March-April  2014, 
explains  that  with  assistance  from  the  Food  and  Agriculture  Organization  (FAO)  a  monitoring 
and evaluation (M&E) program was established in February 2012 in the Department of Planning 
and  Cooperation  (DOPC)  under  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Forestry  (MAF).  A  program 
known as the  Project  Monitoring  Information  System  (ProMIS)  was developed  to facilitate  and 
manage  sector  M&E.  In  support  of  this  initiative,  Output  3  in  the  design  and  monitoring 
framework in the Project Administration Manual (PAM) for the Current project provides support 
for a monitoring and evaluation (M&E) section  to be established in DOPC by December 2012; 
the section was to have a sector-wide mandate. 
In a letter to ADB on 30 March 2015, DOPC requested that any further support for sector 
2. 
M&E  be  reduced  from  the  scope  of  the  current  project  and  transferred  elsewhere.  Whilst 
acknowledging  that  the  sector  M&E  system  needed  strengthening  in  the  technical  and 
operational areas, DOPC explained in the letter that it was proving to be difficult to provide such 
strengthening effectively under an implementation project with a geographically defined scope. 
It  was  suggested  that  the  support  should  be  provided  under  an  independent  sector-wide 
technical assistance. It was also argued that a sector activity such as this may lead to a loss of 
focus during implementation of the current project, which should focus more on specific project 
targets. 
3. 
On 9 April 2015, ADB responded by fax explaining that support to sector M&E was a key 
activity  needed  to  deliver  output  3,  and  suggesting  that  the  institutional  capacity  needs  of  this 
aspect  be  reviewed  under  S-PPTA  8882  for  additional  financing.  Accordingly,  this  brief  paper 
provides  an  analysis  of  the  institutional  framework  within  which  the  M&E  section  operates  its 
capacity,  and  the  suitability  of  supporting  a  sector-wide  activity  under  the  current  project.  It 
further explores any potential impact that the deletion of sector M&E might have on output 3. 
B. 
Institutional Framework 
4. 
In 2012, a Project Management Division (PMD) was established within DOPC through a 
Departmental  Agreement  (Organization  and  Functioning  of  the  Project  Management  Division). 
This  Agreement  was  made  pursuant  to  MAF  Agreement  1884/DOE,  9  August  2012 
(Organization  and  Functioning  of  DOPC)  and  Prime  Minister  Decree  262,  28  June  2012 
(Organization and Functioning of MAF). PMD began to function effectively around mid-2013. 
5. 
DOPC’s role is the management of research in the sector, promotion of M&E of projects 
implemented in the sector and assistance to the development of the sector. PMD is established 
as a  division  within DOPC,  and serves  as  Secretariat  to the  Director General. The  Agreement 
establishing  PMD….sets  up  the  location,  role,  functions,  mandate,  structure,  organization  and 
methods  of  work  as  a  reference  to  the  organization  and  functioning  of  PMD  aimed  at 
76 
implementing tasks to effectively and efficiently manage the implementation of ODA projects of 
the agriculture and forestry sector.  
6. 
Among  PMD’s  several  functions  is  the  centralized  management  of  M&E  for  the  sector, 
which  requires  it  to  coordinate  with  relevant  MAF  agencies  at  the  central  and  local  levels,  as 
well  as  international  agencies.  PMD  is  headed  by  a  Division  Director,  below  which  there  are 
three functional sections, each headed by a Deputy Director. Below each Deputy Director, there 
is  a  Section  Head  responsible  for  the  day-to-day  functions  of  their  respective  section.  Within 
each section, there are two units, as set out below: 
i) 
ii) 
iii) 
M&E Section for ODA projects.

Coordination and Support Unit.

Project Asset Control Unit. 
b. 
Management Information System Section (MIS).

7. 
PMD  has  an  authorized  staffing  level  of  14  personnel,  comprising  of  Division  Director 
(1),  Deputy  Division  Director  (3),  Unit  Heads  (3)  and  Unit  Staff  (3x2=6).  At  this  point,  11 
positions have been filled; the position for Deputy Division Director for MIS is vacant, as is one 
of the Unit staff positions for the M&E Unit. The main functions of the M&E Unit include: 
i) 
ii) 
iii) 
iv) 
Support, monitor and evaluate ODA projects; 
Develop MIS to monitor project implementation and reporting; 
Evaluate progress against plans for projects; and 
Coordinate with relevant agencies to monitor project indicators. 
C. 
M&E – Activities to date 
8. 
In 2010, ADB approved the current project which made provision for some $226,600 to 
provide  capacity  building  support  for  the  development  and  establishment  of  a  sector  M&E 
program. The support was to be provided under output 3: Capacities of National, Provincial and 
District  Agencies  Strengthened  to  Enable  a  Sector  Development  Approach.  National  level 
initiatives  were  to  support  the  government’s  policy  to establish a  central  project management 
for  sector  development,  which  was  to  include  support  for  the  nascent  M&E  Section  within 
DOPC,  as  well  as  provide  capacity  building  support  for  provincial  and  district  staff  for  the 
effective implementation of sector projects. 
9. 
Over  the  period  2012–2013,  FAO  provided  support  to  PMD  for  the  development  of  a 
proto-type  system  of  M&E  (ProMIS)  using  data  collected  from  the  three  targeted  provinces 
under  the  current  project  -  Bokeo,  Saravane  and  Vientiane  (two  districts  per  province).  It  is 
generally  recognized  that  significant  progress  was  made  during  the  two  years  development 
phase,  both  in  terms  of  the  system  development  as  well  the  setting  up  of  the  necessary 
institutional  operating  structure  at  the  three  requisite  levels,  i.e.  the  Province  and  District 
Agriculture  and  Forestry  Office  (PAFO/DAFO),  MAF  technical  departments  and  DOPC. 
Although MAF wish to adopt ProMIS for further roll-out in the future, it is widely recognized that 
77 
these institutional structures require considerable strengthening, as does PMD itself, especially 
since it needs to play a lead role. 
10. 
Following FAO assistance, PMD has developed an internal draft paper that proposes to 
address  the  capacity  concerns  of  the  institutional  structures  at  all  levels,  including  system 
refinement of the M&E system (ProMIS) and expansion of the pilots in the original district target 
areas to all districts in the provinces. PMD has estimated the cost of capacity building at around 
$700,000. 
11. 
By  the  midterm  review  of  the  current  project  (March-April  2014),  there  had  been  no 
significant support for sector M&E under output 3 of the project. The Aide Memoire of the mid-
term review noted this situation, and requested the current project to provide greater assistance 
to  PMD  to  build  its  capacity  in  M&E,  and  required  a  proposal  for  capacity  building  to  be 
submitted ADB for consideration. Training was subsequently provided for ProMIS in the current 
project’s provinces and districts in June and July 2014, as shown in the table below. By the time 
of  the  review  mission  (14-28  November  2014)  however,  there  was  considerable  concern 
growing within DOPC that sector-wide M&E activities were not appropriate under a project (the 
current  project)  with  specific  scope,  and  DOPC  considered  that  the  initiative  should  be 
transferred out of the current project. 
During  the  same  mission,  it  was  agreed  to  reallocate  some  $180,000  from  the  M&E 
12. 
category (07) to the consulting services category (04) in the grant financing plan, a sum which 
was  required  to  cover  the  cost  of  consulting  services  to  support  the  Grant  Implementation 
Consultant  in  preparation  for  the  additional  financing  for  NRI.  This  left  a  balance  of  around 
$29,450 in category (07) for sector M&E. At that point, it was agreed between the EA and ADB 
that one further round of ProMIS training should be provided using the balance of funds, which 
took  place  in  January  and  February  2015,  as  shown  in  the  table  below.  At  this  time,  of  the 
original  $226,600  allocated  for  M&E,  there  is  now  only  a  little  over  $14,000  remaining  in 
Category (07) for sector M&E activities.

13. 
On  30  March  2015,  DOPC  submitted  a  fax  to  ADB  advising  that  the  project’s 
achievement under category (07) had been mainly to establish a project M&E system up to that 
time. In the letter, the EA recognized that more support was needed to strengthen the system to 
monitor  sector  results,  but  should  not  be  pursued  any  further  under  the  current  project.  The 
reasons given were: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
The proposal to strengthen sector M&E was developed during the PPTA for  the 
current project, and circumstances had changed since that time; 
It  would  be  more  appropriate  to  strengthen  sector  M&E  under  a  more  focused 
technical assistance; and 
The current project needed to focus more on specific project targets, as indicated 
in the PAM.    
D. 
Findings 
78 
14.  Without  donor  support,  it  is  clear  that  PMD  can  only  sustain  a  very  limited  amount  of 
M&E activity and is not able to further increase its staffing levels due to budgetary constraints. 
The Project Administration Manual for the current project requires the M&E Unit in PMD to have 
a staff of at least ten (10) people by December 2012, whereas there is currently only one staff 
member  covering  the  activities  in  both  the  M&E  Unit  and  the  Coordination  and  Support  Unit. 
PMD has limited absorptive capacity at his stage. 
15.  Without  adequate  and  routine  budget  support  and  the  necessary  staffing  levels,  it  is 
difficult  to  see  how  any  relatively  short-term  capacity  building  effort  would  lead  to  any 
sustainable  and  effective  change  within  PMD  and  the  M&E  institutional  structure.  Any  donor-
funded capacity building effort needs to be carefully implemented at a pace consistent with the 
absorptive capacities of PMD and the other parts of the institutional structure at the national and 
local levels, whilst recognizing the limitations imposed by the actual budget levels. 
16. 
Although  a  sector-wide  approach  M&E  approach  is  a  commendable  objective,  it  is 
evident  that  it  is  not  making  any  significant  progress  under  the  current  project  structure.  One 
reason is that PMD is not a part of the project structure. Support for sector M&E needs to have 
PMD as the focal point of the implementation arrangements, and the support needs long-term 
institutional support. 
E. 
Conclusions and Recommendations 
17. 
Although it is clear to all stakeholders that the sector M&E system needs strengthening, 
as events have unfolded over the past several years, it is now clear that PMD and other parts of 
the M&E institutional structure have not been able to develop to a level anticipated by FAO or 
ADB  in  its  current  project.  This  report  agrees  with  DOPC  that  the  sector  M&E  support  under 
output 3 is no longer appropriate under the current project. It is recommended that it be deleted 
from  the  design  and  addressed  under  a  medium  to  long-term  TA  initiative,  with  a  very  clear 
focus  on  PMD,  and  implemented  at  a  rate  consistent  with  the  available  budget  and  staffing 
levels to ensure sustainability. It would be far more effective if PMD could be the implementing 
agency. 
18. 
It is considered that the deletion of sector-wide M&E support under output 3 will not be 
detrimental  to  the  project.  Support  for  sector-wide  M&E  is  only  one  initiative  under  a  more 
comprehensive capacity building effort under output 3 at both the central and local levels, all of 
which are evidently supported very effectively. It should be noted that the Current project has a 
very effective project-specific M&E system, which is well regarded by ADB staff at LRM. 
19. 
Although  there  are  no  longer  sufficient  funds  left  in  the  financing  plan  to  support  any 
significant  sector-wide  M&E  activities,  PMD’s  need  to  support  this  initiative  has  been  clearly 
expressed by its staff as well as staff of DOPC.

ANNEX D 
TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR CONSULTING SERVICES 
A. 
BACKGROUND 
Consultants  to  be  financed  from  the  Grant  include  (i)  the  Grant  Implementation 
1. 
Consultant  (GIC);  (ii)  Engineering  Consulting  Firm  (ECF)  to  assist  in  the  preparation  and 
supervision of PRI subproject civil works; (iii) Social Impact Assessment Consultants (SIA); (iv) 
External Safeguards Monitor (ESM); and (v) Irrigation Subsector Review Consultant (ISR). All 
consultants  and  institutes  will  be  selected  and  engaged  in  accordance  with  the  ADB’s 
Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. 
2. 
Since the project represents additional financing to the current project, every effort has 
been  made  to  maintain  existing  implementation  arrangements,  as  they  have  proven  to  be 
effective, as demonstrated by the  current project’s track record. Thus, the EA has requested, 
and  ADB  supports,  the  continuation  of  the  consulting  services  being  provided  by  the  current

Gender,  Ethnic  Group,  and  Community  Development  Specialists  -  (14  pm  International 
and 30 pm National) 
22. 
The safeguard requirements of ADB seek to ensure the poor and other disadvantaged 
groups  within  the  target  area  access  project  benefits.  This  will  require  specialist  expertise  in 
identifying  affected  groups  characteristics  and  needs  and  accommodating  these  needs 
wherever  feasible.  Given  the  large  proportion  of  ethnic  groups  among  the  target  population, 
measures will need to be taken to ensure these groups benefit from project interventions. The 
specialists  will  support  project  initiatives  in  community  development  including  gender  and 
indigenous  peoples’  activities.  One  of  the  major  targets  in  community  development  is  to 
formulate  a  water  user  group  (WUG)  in  each  PRI  subproject,  which  will  be  responsible  for 
O&M of irrigation facilities. The WUG should be further developed financially to be a water user 
association (WUA), which is officially certified by the district government under the Decree on 
the  Establishment  and  Operation  of  the  Water  Users  Associations  (No.1150/AF  in  2000). 
There will be capacity building in these areas that will also form part of the responsibilities of 
the  specialists.  The  specialists  will  assist  NPMO,  PPMOs  and  district  coordination  offices 
(DCOs)  in  developing  and  implementing  initiatives  to  assure  that  benefits  are  shared  by  all 
disadvantaged groups including the ethnic groups. In addition, there is scope to develop other 
associated  initiatives  that  will  target  women,  the  poor  and  ethnic  groups  that  require  further 
definition  during  preparation  of  PRI  subprojects  for  funding  under  the  proposed  Project.  The 
international  specialist  will  have  tertiary  qualifications  from  an  internationally  recognized 
institution  with  preferably  10  years  of  experience  in  the  South  East  Asian  environment.  
Preferably 3 years of experience will have been obtained in Lao PDR. The national specialist 
will  have  similar  qualifications  from  a  national  educational  institution  and  will  also  have 
preferably 10 years of experience in related fields on internationally funded projects.

F. 
IRRIGATION SUBSECTOR REVIEW CONSULTANT 
Background and Context 
Irrigation  development  has  been  a  vitally  important  and integral  part  of agricultural  and 
60. 
rural  development  programs  throughout  Lao  People’s  Democratic  Republic  (PDR).  Irrigated 
areas have increased from 0.17 million ha in 1995 to 0.41 million ha in 2011,  or about 14% of 
114 
the  agricultural  area.26 The  contribution  of  the  agriculture,  natural  resources,  and  environment 
(ANRE)  sector  has  decreased  from  about  29.5%  in  2011  to  only  27.7%  of  gross  domestic 
productin  2014;  with  the  majority  from  the  natural  resources  sector. 27  However,  continued 
investment  in  irrigated  agriculture  is  expected  as  reflected  in  the  8th  National  Socio-Economic 
Development Plan (NSEDP)28 for 2016-2020 and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) 
Agricultural  Development  Strategy  to  2025.29 These  include  plans  for  major  public  and  private 
sector  investments  for  the  7  largest  lowland  plains  and  12  upland  plains30 which  aim  to  bring 
315,000  ha  into  production  of  rice.  Lao  PDR  has  expanded  its  dry  season  irrigated  area  from 
less than 30,000 ha in the mid-1990s to almost 200,000 ha at present. 
As  noted  in  the  Asian  Development  Bank’s  (ADB)  Sector  Assessment, 31  significant 
61. 
public  and  private  sector  investments  in  irrigation  system  development  have  been  made  over 
the  past  25  years,  and  continue  to  be  implemented  throughout  the  country.  The  most  recent 
diagnostic review of the irrigation subsector was undertaken in 2007. The review made strong 
inroads into defining the challenges facing irrigation management transfer (IMT) and proposing 
means  to  create  new  models  for  addressing  these  challenges.  However,  since  2007,  new 
openings  have  emerged  brought  about  by  the  major  national  policy  developments  mentioned 
above,  combined  with  a  strengthening  of  the  regulatory  frameworks.  The  need  for  a  further 
irrigation  subsector  review  is  now  clear,  particularly  in  light  of  the  emphasis  on  rice  and  food 
commodity production, increasing productivity in the agriculture sector, and developing irrigation 
in  ten  high  priority  rice  producing  provinces  and  on  12  upland  plains,  in  the  8th  NSEDP  and 
MAF’s Agricultural Development Strategy to 2025. 
Scope of the Review 
62. 
The scope of the Lao PDR irrigation subsector review will include (i) assessment of the 
current  state  of  irrigated  agriculture  in  Lao  PDR;  (ii)  identification  of  strategies  for  sustainable 
intensification  of  agriculture  and  adaption  to  climate  change;  (iii)  opportunities  for  ecosystem 
assessment  to  be  included  in  design  and  management  of  irrigated  agricultural  systems  to 
maximize  ecosystem  services;  and  (iv)  priorities  for  modernization  of  irrigated  agriculture  and 
irrigation  services  in  Lao  PDR.  Specifically,  the  review  will  assess  how  the  new  policy 
environment would impact irrigation expansion, intensification of land and water resources use, 
and ecosystem functions. The review will evaluate how current and planned development within 
watersheds may  impact irrigation  performance and  the  trade-offs  between irrigated  production 
and other aspects of food production and food security in rural Lao PDR. 
The  review  will  update  the  findings  of  the  2007  irrigation  subsector  review 32  using

irrigation performance, agricultural production and household incomes; in addition to drawing on 
the ADB rapid assessment of community managed irrigation weirs in Lao PDR. The review will 
examine  the  performance  of  irrigation  subsector  institutions,  both  formal  and  informal,  as  a 
basis for recommendations for further development of these organizations. Analysis will include 
assessment  of  the  opportunities  and  constraints  associated  with  the  input-output  value  chain 
and emerging market opportunities for irrigated production. 
64. 
The  review  will  include  assessment  of  the  impact  of  weirs  and  other  irrigation 
infrastructure. These  are  now  recognized  to  pose  some  challenges for fish migration,  which  is 
believed  to  result  in  decreased  fish  catch.  The  review  will  assess  options  to  reduce  negative 
impacts  of  irrigation  development  on  fish  migration  including  through  literature  reviews  of  best 
practice  in the  region,  field  surveys  of  proposed  irrigation  developments  and  outline  design  of 
potential  interventions  to  mitigate  negative  impacts  of  water  management  infrastructure 
associated with irrigation on fish migration. The review will propose alternate interventions that 
can be operated by individual farmers or by communities for testing. 
The  review  will  also investigate  the trade-offs  typically  arising from  increased  irrigation, 
65. 
including  those  associated  with:  (i)  watershed  degradation-forest  clearing;  (ii)  land  use 
change/intensification;  (iii)  increased  agrochemical  use;  and (iv)  upstream–downstream  effects 
and potential for increased social conflict. 
Focal Issues 
66. 
The Lao PDR irrigation subsector review will include: 
(i) 
Assessment of the performance of investments in irrigated agriculture from 2000 
to 2015, including: 
a.  Performance  of  investment  projects  (relevance,  efficiency,  effectiveness, 
sustainability and economic performance); 
b.  Impact on household finances; 
c.  Contribution to food and nutrition security; 
d.  Sustainability of investment project outcomes; and 
e.  Irrigation  institutions,  participatory  management  and  Water  User  Group 
(WUG)  functioning  and  lessons  learnt,  assessment  of  the  effectiveness  of 
institutional developments (WUGs and informal institutional mechanisms) vis-
à-vis  alternate  arrangements.  This  will  also  include  the  following  issues:  (i) 
level  of  understanding  and  technical  capacity  of  agricultural  extension 
technicians and farmer-irrigators to effectively operate and maintain irrigation 
systems;  (ii)  economics  of  irrigation  systems,  i.e.,  the  return  on  investments 
from  rice  compared  to  other  high-value  crops;  (iii)  reasons  that  farmer-
irrigators  abandon irrigation  systems;  (iv)  effectiveness  of  training  of farmer-
irrigators on implementing technical guidelines related to on-farm and in-field 
water management. 
(ii)
