  PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
1. 
The  project  will  improve  rural  farmland  infrastructure  and  demonstrate  sustainable 
farming  practices  in  13  project  counties  of  Fujian  Province  to  reduce  land  and  environmental 
degradation.1  Sustainable  farming  systems  simultaneously  maintain  agricultural  productivity; 
enhance  the  natural  environment;  promote  more  efficient  use  of  key  inputs,  including  water, 
crop nutrients, pesticides, energy, land, and labor; and contribute to better ecosystem services.2 
1 
Agriculture  development  has  increased  productivity  yet  caused  high  levels  of  land 
2. 
degradation. In the People’s Republic of China (PRC), 70%-80% of croplands, forestlands, and 
grasslands  are  degraded.3  Major  problems  are  water  and  wind  erosion  of  soils,  reduced  soil 
fertility, over-exploited water resources, nonpoint source pollution, and deforestation. Driven by 
inefficient  irrigation,  overuse  of  chemical  fertilizers  and  pesticides,  improper  waste  treatment, 
and  poor  land  use  practices,  land  degradation  is  now  the  most  limiting  factor  to  agriculture 
production  and  poses  a  serious  threat  to  food  security,  rural  livelihoods,  and  rural  economic 
growth. Reduced agriculture productivity due to land degradation was $37.09 billion in the PRC 
or  about  1%  of  the  gross  domestic  product  in  2007 (footnote 3).  Yet  land degradation  can  be 
prevented  and  reversed  with  soil  conditions  improved  and  productivity  restored.  The  cost  of 
reversing 
is 
considerably lower than the loss caused by land degradation.  
land  degradation  and  applying  sustainable 
land  management  practices 
3. 
In  line  with  this  approach,  the  National  Agricultural  Sustainable  Development  Plan, 
2015–2030 focuses on tackling the major causes of degradation and promoting sustainable land 
and resource use.4 Key targets are to reduce chemical fertilizer and pesticide use, improve soil 
health,  control  soil  erosion,  and  promote  ecological,  featured,  and  high-efficiency  agriculture 
based on high-quality products and production systems. To achieve these targets, the focus is 
on investment in (i) water and soil resource protection,5 (ii) agricultural and rural environmental 
control,6 and (iii) ecological rehabilitation. To implement this plan, the government will pilot and 
demonstrate  sustainable  agricultural  production  practices  in  selected  provinces  based  on  the 
urgency  of  their  rehabilitation  needs.  Fujian  Province  has  been  designated  as  a  priority 
province. 
Fujian  Province  is  mostly  mountainous  and  supports  an  agrarian  rural  economy  that 
4. 
accounts for 75.9% of the output of the primary sector and supports 39.2% of the total provincial 
1   The  13  project  counties  are  Wuyishan,  Guangze,  Datian,  Youxi,  Ninghua,  Yongding,  Xinluo,  Pinghe,  Zhangpu 
(Hua'an),  Jiaocheng,  Zherong,  Dongqiao,  and  Fu'an.  These  counties  were  selected  based  on  demand  for 
sustainable  agriculture  practices  and  poverty  alleviation  priority  counties.  The  selection  criteria  and  process  are 
summarized  in  Annex  2  of  the  project  administration  manual  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in 
Appendix 2).

population  (14.81  million  people  living  in  rural  areas).7  Because  of  the  topography,  agriculture 
produces either perennial tree crops on sloping land or annual crops grown in the valley floor, 
such as tea, tea oil, pomelo, rice, Chinese pearl barley, and lotus.8 The difficult terrain and poor 
land  management  practices  have  caused  widespread  land  and  environmental  degradation, 
which  is  further  exacerbated  by  a  changing  climate  and  extreme  weather  conditions.  This 
makes agricultural production and rural livelihoods difficult to sustain. Per capita income in the 
rural areas of Fujian is CNY11,184, or only 36.3% of urban per capita income (CNY30,816)—
the  rural–urban  disparity.  Farmers  need  additional  support  to  have  a  viable  livelihood  option 
based on sustainable agriculture rather than turn to urban migration for an alternative livelihood. 
As  a leading  province  for  ecological  civilization,  Fujian  is  required  to manage  its  environment, 
safeguard  ecological  security,  adapt  to  climate  change,  improve  resource  conservation, 
undertake environmentally  friendly  development, and use  and manage more  sustainably  land, 
water, and other natural resources to provide sustainable livelihood opportunities.9 
5. 
Land degradation. Land resources in Fujian Province are limited, allowing an average 
of  0.058  hectares  (0.88  mu)  of  farmland  per  rural  person,  which  is  only  about  65%  of  the 
national  average.10  Moreover,  the  land  is  typically  of  poor  quality  and  low  crop  productivity–
78.1%  of  the  province’s  arable  land  is  rated  as  low  to  medium  quality  because  of  poor  soil 
health, high rates of soil erosion, and outdated agricultural infrastructure, all of which constrains 
production. The infrastructure also has low resilience to natural disasters. The narrow dirt roads 
are  not  suited  for  motorized  agricultural  traffic  and  are  inaccessible  during  the  rainy  season. 
Irrigation systems are generally old, made of earthen channels and ditches that are dilapidated 
by  sedimentation  or  otherwise  in  disrepair,  resulting  in  low  irrigation  efficiency  of  about  40%, 
lower  than the  national average.  Effective irrigation  in  the  dry  season  and  drainage  in  the  wet 
season  is  not  possible.  Efficient  and  productive  water  use  would  require  rehabilitation  and 
modernization of irrigation and drainage infrastructure. The soils erode easily, especially  when 
coupled  with  poor  land  management  practices  and  infrastructure  as  well  as  seasonal  high-
intensity rainfall. Loss of soil resources, reduced fertility, and poor soil condition make remedial 
actions imperative. These include proper field design with terraces, and irrigation and drainage 
canals  to minimize erosion,  and the  application  of  organic  matter  and fertilizers  to restore soil 
health, which in turn will restore degraded land resources and increase productivity. 
Polluting  and  unproductive  cropping  systems.  Inefficient  water  use,  overuse  of 
6. 
chemical fertilizers and pesticides, and lack of capacity among farmers are the main constraints 
to  crop  productivity.  In  2013,  total  fertilizer  and  pesticide  application  per  unit  area  in  Fujian 
Province  was  4.13  million  tons,  15%  higher  than  the  national  average.11  Limited  guidance  on 
proper  use  rates  caused  an  overuse  of  fertilizers  and  pesticides  leading  to  nonpoint  source 
pollution  and  soil  degradation,  reduced  profits  to  farmers,  and  increased  concerns  about  food 
safety.  Solving  this  problem  requires  (i)  precise  fertilizer  application  through  soil  and  water 
testing, improved soil and crop management, and use of organic fertilizers; (ii) capacity building

31  August  2016).The  province’s  gross  domestic  product  was  CNY2,405.58  billion  in  2014;  the  primary  sector’s 
contribution was 8.38% (CNY201.48 billion), to which the agriculture sector contributed CNY152.96 billion.  
8   Fujian Province is the biggest tea producer in the PRC, contributing 18.5% to national production.  Tea production 
reached 347,000 tons in 2013, involving 10% of the provincial population. 
9  According  to  the  PRC  government,  “ecological  civilization”  refers  to  achieving  harmony  between  growth,  people, 
and  nature,  requiring  people  to  respect,  protect,  and  maintain  a  harmonious  relationship  with  nature.  It  includes 
activities to mitigate ecological damage, relieve pressures on natural resources, and improve the balance between 
the environment and the economy.

of  farmers;  and  (iii)  the  promotion  of  organic,  green,  and  nonpolluting  products,  as  well  as 
institutional  interventions.  Water  use  efficiency  will  hinge  on  adequate  operation  and 
maintenance of irrigation systems, e.g., by setting up dedicated water user groups, water-saving 
irrigation techniques, and better agricultural water management practices.  
7. 
Agriculture is highly vulnerable to climate change. Coping with the significant variability 
of future climatic impacts  requires efficient water resource management, boosting the capacity 
of agricultural support institutions and related stakeholders, and improving the support services 
to farmers as well as building resilience into production systems and the ecosystem.     
8. 
Inefficient  smallholder  agriculture.  Smallholder  farmers  struggle  to  earn  a  decent 
income  from  farming,  which  causes  rural–urban  income  disparity  and  limits  socioeconomic 
development. Key hurdles are the large number of smallholder farmers, skilled labor shortage, 
and  the  lack  of  adequate  training  to  improve  farmers’  technical  knowledge  and  environmental 
awareness. Moreover, farmers do not always benefit from the adoption of sustainable practices 
because they lack access to quality-certification schemes that would boost recognition of their 
organic  or  green  produce. Fujian  Province  is  promoting  land  consolidation12  and  cooperation 
models13  to  establish  links  between  state-owned  enterprises  (SOEs),  private  enterprises, 
cooperatives,  and  farmers  as  a  means  to  organize  farmers,  facilitate  access  to  markets, 
increase large-scale purchasing of inputs at lower prices, and transfer knowledge and services 
to their members as a means to increase rural economic development. Cooperation models can 
provide  training  in  modern  agricultural  practices,  including  proper  fertilizer  and  pesticide 
applications, organic and green production practices, land management, and on-farm guidance. 
This  would  result 
in  better-quality  products,  product  certification,  and  greater  market 
competitiveness.14 However, concerns have emerged about the development, performance, and 
governance  of  SOE,  private  enterprises,  and  farmers’  cooperatives,  and  whether  benefits  are 
shared  equitably.  Additional  support  is  required  to  ensure  that  technical  and  management 
capacities  are  up  to  the  task  and  to  promote  equitable  and  inclusive  economic  and  rural 
livelihood development opportunities. 
 9. 
As the PRC strives to build an “ecological civilization,” managing the environment is of 
paramount  concern  as  is  improving  rural  livelihoods,  and  are  the  basis  for  sustainable 
agriculture  systems.  These  multifaceted  systems  will  be  piloted  in  Fujian  Province  to 
demonstrate  (i)  protection  of  arable  land  resources  and  optimal  development;  (ii)  enhanced 
agricultural productivity and promotion of sustainable utilization through efficient water use and 
less  environmental  pollution;  and  (iii)  cooperation  models  between  enterprises,  cooperatives, 
and farmers.      
10. 
Strategic  fit.  The  project  supports  the  government’s  overarching  strategic  goal  of 
building  a  harmonious  and  prosperous  society  through  regionally  balanced,  inclusive,  and 
environmentally sustainable growth. The project supports the National Agricultural Sustainable 
Development  Plan,  2015–2030  (footnote  4)  and  the  State  Council  No.  1  Document  (2016) 
promoting  agriculture reform  and modernization. The  project  is  in line  with the  priorities of  the

development, participation, and empowerment of farmers and farmer organizations for improved 
production  bases  and  equitable  benefit  sharing.  The  project  will  work  through  enterprises18  to 
help farmers organize themselves and apply new technologies, provide extension services, and 
open up access to markets. Lessons from the Fujian Soil Conservation and Rural Development 
I and II projects were also incorporated,19 which focused on soil conservation and value chain 
development  resulting  in  reduced  soil  erosion  and  specialized  agriculture  products  being 
promoted.  The  proposed  project  focuses  on  rehabilitation  of  already  degraded  land  by 
demonstrating  sustainable  land  development  and  rehabilitation  practices  and  by  implementing 
sustainable, climate-resilient farming practices. The capacity and knowledge gained from these 
projects  will  ensure  that  Fujian  Province  has  the  capacity  to  halt  degradation,  rehabilitate 
degraded  lands,  and  promote  sustainable  agriculture  development  that  brings  benefits  to 
farmers, stimulates the rural economy, and is climate-resilient. 
A. 
Impact and Outcome 
The  project  impact  will  be  reduced  land  and  environmental  degradation  and  improved 
12. 
rural livelihoods in Fujian Province. The project outcome will be long-term farmland productivity 
and better climate resilience. 
B. 
Outputs 
Output 1: Productive farmland established. This output will rehabilitate 63,700 mu of 
13. 
valley-floor  cropland  and  200,000  mu  of  sloping  land.  Valley-floor  improvements  will  comprise 
land  leveling  and development of farm  infrastructure,  such as roads that are  suited to tractors 
and  water-conserving  facilities  (25  kilometers  of  dikes  and  embankments  for  flood  prevention, 
drainage ditches, irrigation canals, and irrigation facilities), for cropping grains, vegetables, and 
lotus seeds. Rehabilitation of sloping land, which is used for growing tea, tea oil, and orchards, 
includes  the  repair  of  existing  terracing,  farm  infrastructure  such  as  tractor  roads,  and  water-
conserving facilities such as storage ponds, and spray and/or drip irrigation equipment.

Output  2:  Sustainable  farming  technology  and  practices  adopted.  This  output  will 
14. 
support  farmers  and  cooperatives  to  improve  access  to  resources  and  technology  through 
cooperation with SOEs and private enterprises and demonstrate improved and climate-resilient 
cropping  practices.  It  includes  the  provision  of  agricultural  equipment  and  materials  to 
implement  sustainable  farming  techniques  such  as  soil  conservation  (e.g.,  applying  organic 
fertilizer, implementing zero or low tillage, new crop varieties, and establishing tree plantations 
for  windbreaks  and  shade),  integrated  pest  management,  improved  cropping  practices  (e.g., 
intercropping and crop rotation), and equipment to test the quality of soil and water. The output 
will also assist the certification process for green and organic tea, and tea oil products. 
15. 
Output  3:  Institutional,  technical,  and  management  capacity  strengthened.  This 
output  includes  (i)  training  for  farmers’  cooperatives  on  cooperative  operation,  production 
technology,  and  marketing;  (ii) training  for  project  implementation  units  (PIUs)  and farmers  on 
good agricultural practices and technology, including certification of green and organic products; 
(iii)  establishment  and  capacity  development  of  farmland  infrastructure  management  and 
maintenance associations; and (iv) training on gender and development to ensure inclusion of 
women and the poor in project activities.   
16. 
Demonstration features. The project will demonstrate sustainable farming systems and 
practices  that  will  offer  a  range  of  productivity,  socioeconomic,  and  environmental  benefits  to 
farmers and to society in general—e.g., high and stable productivity and profitability, adaptation 
and  resilience  to  climate  change,  and  a  better  environment  and  less  degradation.  These 
systems  are  replicable  throughout  the  PRC  to  combat  land  and  soil  degradation.  Key 
demonstration features are: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
Private  sector–led  development.  Promotion  of  farmer–cooperative–enterprise 
cooperation models based on mutually beneficial mechanisms that allow farmers 
access to new technologies and practices combined with extension services and 
training,  better  infrastructure  and  market  access,  guaranteed  prices  for  their 
products,  and  improved  due  process  for  land  leasing  to  increase  the  scale  of 
farm  systems.  This  approach  is  promoted  by  the  government  to  supplement 
regular government services that cannot reach and benefit all farmers. 
Climate-resilient  agriculture.  The  project  (a)  applies  water  management 
practices  that  capture  and  store  water  for  irrigation,  offer  potential  for  energy, 
water,  and  money  savings,  and  boost  crop  yields  by  reducing  drought  impacts, 
maintaining soil health, and reducing runoff to minimize soil erosion and transfer 
of pollutants; (b) selects crops and varieties that are well adapted, high-yielding, 
and resistant to biotic and abiotic stresses; and (c) provides good-quality seeds 
and seedlings to ensure high-quality varieties.  
Integrated  pest  management.  The  project  applies  integrated  management  of 
pests, diseases, and weeds by using suitable physical and biological measures, 
and  selective  and  low-risk  pesticides.  This  will  reduce  the  use  of  chemical 
pesticides, environmental pollution, and improve product quality and food safety.  
Better  crop  nutrition  thanks  to  healthy  soils.  Healthy  soils  can  be  achieved 
through crop  rotations  and  by using  organic fertilizer  while minimizing  inorganic 
fertilizer.  The  project  will  provide  soil-testing  and  water-testing  equipment  to 
enable fertilizing  recommendations  based  on crop  and soil  needs,  and promote 
the  use  of  organic  matter  to  maintain,  improve,  and  rebuild  soils.  This  will 
improve  nutrient  supply,  water-retention,  soil  structure,  and  erosion  prevention.

Preparation.  The  cost  estimates  were  prepared  jointly  by  the  design  institutes, 
provincial  project  management  office  (PPMO),  and  ADB  with  assistance  from  the  project 
preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) consultant. The sources and basis for cost estimates 
were  reviewed  during  the  project  preparation  and  had  been  confirmed  by  related  parties.  The 
process was facilitated by a model in excel software which enabled easy updating or revision, if 
necessary. The model is maintained by both PPMO and ADB. 
20. 
Revisions.  Revision  of  cost  estimates  will  be  conducted  when  deemed  necessary 
during  implementation.  The  PPMO  will  be  responsible  in  proposing  and  drafting  the  revision 
which will be subject to ADB’s approval.

a  Includes  taxes  and  duties  of  $4.44  million  to  be  financed  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  loan, 
$0.85 million  from  the  participating  private  enterprises,  $3.09  million  from  state-owned  enterprises,  and 
$0.12 million from government resources. The estimated taxes and duties to be incurred under the project do not 
represent an excessive share of the project cost. 
b  In  mid-2015  prices.  Of  the  base  cost,  67.6%  will  finance  civil  works;  19.1%,  equipment  and  materials;  2.6%, 
research and development and training; 0.3%, consulting services; and 5.5%, project management and others. 
c    Physical  contingencies  computed  at  5%  for  all  expenditure  categories.  Price  contingencies  computed  based  on 
escalation  factors  at  2.4%  on  local  currency  costs  in  2017  and  2.5%  thereafter,  and  1.4%  on  foreign  exchange 
costs in 2017 and 1.5% thereafter. 
d  Includes interest and commitment charges. Interest during construction for ADB loan has been computed at the 5-
year  United  States  dollar  swap  rate  plus  a  spread  of  0.5%  and  an  average  loan  maturity  premium  of  0.1%. 
Commitment charges for an ADB loan are 0.15% per year to be charged on the undisbursed loan amount.

23. 
The Government of the PRC has requested a loan of $100 million from ADB’s ordinary 
capital  resources  to  help  finance  the  project.  The  loan  will  have  a  26-year  term,  including  a 
grace period of 5 years, an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB’s London 
interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, 
and  such  other  terms  and conditions  set forth  in  the  draft  loan and project  agreements.20  The 
Fujian Provincial Government (FPG) will bear the foreign exchange and interest rate risk of the 
loan.  FPG  will  in  turn  onlend  all  the  loan  proceeds  to  project  county  governments,  which  will 
make the  loan proceeds  available to nine  state-owned enterprises (SOEs)  on the  same terms 
and  conditions  as  those  of  the  ADB  loan  to  the  national  government,  and  to  10 participating 
private enterprises (PPEs) on the terms and conditions set in the relending agreement with the 
FPG,  which  will  be  the  same  other  than  the  amortization  period  of  no  more  than  15  years, 
including a grace period of 5 years.  
The ADB loan will finance 52.24% of the project costs, including civil works, goods, and 
24. 
taxes and duties for eligible ADB-financed expenditures. The FPG will make counterpart funds 
available for project management. The  SOEs and PPEs will finance their own costs related to 
research and development, training, project management, physical and price contingencies, and 
financing charges during implementation. 21 
20 The interest and commitment charges during implementation will not be capitalized in the loan. 
21 State-owned enterprises and PPEs will provide contributions from their own budgetary resources (no commercial 
bank loans).

Financial Management Assessment

  FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT 
25. 
The  financial  management  assessment  (FMA)  was  conducted  in  September  2015  in 
accordance  with  ADB’s  Guidelines  for  the  Financial  Management  and  Analysis  of  Projects, 
Financial  Due  Diligence:  a  Methodology  Note,  and  Technical  Guidance  Note:  Financial 
Management  Assessment.  The  FMA  considered  the  financial  management  capacity  of  the 
Fujian  Finance  Department  and  PPMO,  the  executing  agency,  and  the  13  CPMOs,  the 
implementing agency, as well as the 19 project implementation units. The assessment covered 
funds-flow  arrangements,  staffing,  accounting  and  financial  reporting  systems,  internal  and 
external auditing arrangements, and financial information systems. 
26. 
The  overall  financial  management  risk  rating  of  the  project  is  moderate.  FFD  has 
adequate  financial  staff,  accounting  policies  and  procedures,  internal  and  external  controls, 
audit arrangements, and reporting system. It has experience with World Bank and ADB projects. 
Additional training and support will still be required on ADB policies and procedures, including 
procurement, disbursement and project management. 
The  IAs  have  adequate  financial  management  systems  which  can  meet  the  minimum 
27. 
financial  management  requirements  for  their  current  activities.  The  IA’s  have  staff  in  the 
planning  and financial  department.  Eight  of the  13  CPMOs  have  experience with ADB  funded 
projects. Training and support will be required at the IA level on ADB policies and procedures, 
Implementation 
including  procurement,  disbursement  and  project  management.  Loan 
Consultants  (LICs)  recruited  by  the  PPMO  will  provide  financial  management  assistance,  in 
addition to assistance from the PPMO. 
The  assessment  identified  the  main  financial  management  risks  as:  (i)  implementation 
28. 
risk - lack of familiarity with ADB disbursement procedures and requirements which could delay 
project implementation, (ii) compliance risk - lack of familiarity with ADB financial management 
requirements,  particularly  on  accounting,  reporting,  and  auditing,  which  may  delay  project 
reporting and derail identification of issues on the use of loan proceeds, and (iii) financing risk – 
delays 
funding  which  could  delay  project 
implementation.

30. 
Handbook  (2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time),  and  detailed  arrangements  agreed  upon 
between the government and ADB. Online training for project staff on disbursement policies and 
procedures  is  available.22  Project  staff  are  encouraged  to  avail  of  this  training  to  help  ensure 
efficient disbursement and fiduciary control. 
Imprest fund procedure. An imprest account will be set up for the project by FFD in a 
31. 
commercial bank acceptable to ADB. FFD will be responsible for the management, monitoring, 
and reconciliation of the imprest account. The total outstanding advance to the imprest account 
will  not  exceed  the  estimate  of  ADB’s  share  of  expenditures  to  be  paid  through  the  imprest 
account  for  the  forthcoming  6  months.  The  executing  agency  may  request  for  initial  and 
additional advances to the imprest account based on an estimate of expenditure sheet available 
in Appendix 10B of ADB’s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2015, as amended from time to time), 
setting out the estimated expenditures to be financed through the account for the forthcoming 6 
months. Supporting documents will be submitted to ADB or retained by the PIUs in accordance 
with  ADB’s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  when 
liquidating or replenishing the imprest account. The currency of the imprest account is US dollar. 
Statement of expenditure procedure.23 The statement of expenditure procedure may 
32. 
be  used  for  reimbursement  of  eligible  expenditures  or  liquidation  of  advances  to  the  imprest 
account. The ceiling of the statement of expenditure procedure is the equivalent of US$200,000 
per individual payment.  Supporting documents and records for the expenditures claimed under 
the  statement  of  expenditure  should  be  maintained  and  made  readily  available  for  review  by 
ADB's  disbursement  and  review  missions,  upon  ADB's  request  for  submission  of  supporting 
documents on a sampling basis, and for independent audit. 24 Reimbursement and liquidation of 
individual  payments  in  excess  of  the  statement  of  expenditure  ceiling  should  be  supported  by 
full documentation when submitting the withdrawal application to ADB. 
Before the submission of the first withdrawal application, the borrower should submit to 
33. 
ADB  sufficient  evidence  of  the  authority  of  the  person(s)  who  will  sign  the  withdrawal 
applications on behalf of the government, together with the authenticated specimen signatures 
of  each  authorized  person.  The  minimum  value  per  withdrawal  application  is  US$100,000 
equivalent.  Individual  payments  below  this  amount  should  be  paid  (i)  by  the  FFD  and

subsequently  claimed  to  ADB  through  reimbursement,  or  (ii)  through  the  imprest  fund 
procedure, unless otherwise accepted by ADB.  
FFD  will  not  onlend  any  proceeds  of  the  ADB  loan  to PPEs  and  SOEs  until  they  have 
34. 
entered into an onlending agreements and project implementing agreements.  
2. 
Disbursement Arrangements for Counterpart Fund 
The  PPEs  will  use  their  own  resources  to  provide  counterpart  funds.  SOEs  are 
35. 
government  financed  enterprises  with  counterpart  funds  coming  from  SOE  and  county 
government  budget  allocations.  The  SOEs  and  PPEs  will  prepare  an  annual  financing  plan, 
based  from  the  procurement  plan  covering  an  18  month  period  of  contract  awards  and 
disbursements, SOEs and PPEs will provide counterpart funds accordingly. CPMOs will monitor 
SOE and PPE counterpart contribution and provide consolidated reports to the PPMO and ADB 
for their review. 
C. 
Accounting 
36. 
The  PPMO,  on  behalf  of  the  FPG,  will  maintain,  or  cause  to  be  maintained,  separate 
books and records by funding source for all expenditures incurred on the project by adopting the 
Accounting Methods for Projects Financed by the World Bank (reference No. 2000 [13]).25 The 
the 
PPMO  will  prepare  consolidated  project 
government's  accounting  laws  and  regulations  which  are  consistent  with  international 
accounting principles and practices.  
in  accordance  with 
financial  statements 
D. 
 Auditing and Public Disclosure 
37. 
PPMO,  on  behalf  of  FPG,  will  cause  the  10  PPEs  to  have  their  general  financial 
statements and the financial statements for the project audited annually by independent auditors 
whose qualifications, experience and terms of reference are acceptable to ADB, in accordance 
with  international  standards  for  auditing  or  the  national  equivalent  acceptable  to  ADB.  The 
audited project financial statements together with the auditors’ opinion  will be submitted in the 
English language to ADB within 6 months of the end of the fiscal year by the PPMO. 
38. 
The  annual  audit  report  for  the  project  will  include  an  audit  management  letter  and 
auditor’s  opinions,  which  cover  (i)  whether  the  project  financial  statements  present  a  true  and 
fair  view  or  are  presented  fairly,  in  all  material  respects,  in  accordance  with  the  applicable 
financial reporting framework; and (ii) whether loan proceeds were used only for the purposes of 
the project.  
39. 
Compliance  with  financial  reporting  and  auditing  requirements  will  be  monitored  by 
review  missions  and  during  normal  program  supervision,  and  followed  up  regularly  with  all 
concerned, including the external auditor. 
40. 
The executing agency, implementing agencies, and the PIUs have been made aware of 
ADB’s  policy  on  delayed  submission,26  and  the  requirements  for  satisfactory  and  acceptable 
25 Accounting regulations issued by the Ministry of Finance for all foreign aid-funded projects. 
26  When audited project financial statements are not received by the due date, ADB will write to the executing agency 
advising  that  (i)  the  audit  documents  are  overdue;  and  (ii)  if  they  are  not  received  within  the  next  6  months, 
requests for new contract awards and disbursement such as new replenishment of imprest accounts, processing of 
new reimbursement, and issuance of new commitment letters will not be processed. 
26 
quality of the audited project financial statements. ADB reserves the right to require a change in 
the  auditor  (in  a  manner  consistent  with  the  constitution  of  the  borrower),  or  for  additional 
support  to  be  provided  to  the  auditor,  if  the  audits  required  are  not  conducted  in  a  manner 
satisfactory  to  ADB,  or  if  the  audits  are  substantially  delayed.  ADB  reserves the  right to verify 
the  project's  financial  accounts  to  confirm  that  the  share  of  ADB’s  financing  is  used  in 
accordance with ADB’s policies and procedures. 
41. 
Public  disclosure  of  the  project  financial  statements,  including  the  audit  report  on  the 
project  financial  statements,  will  be  guided  by  ADB’s  Public  Communications  Policy  (2011).27 
After  review,  ADB  will  disclose  the  financial  statements  for  the  project  and  the  opinion  of  the 
auditors on the financial statements within 14 days of the date of their receipt by posting them 
on the ADB website. The audit management letter will not be disclosed.28 
E. 
Financial Performance of the Particpating Private Enterprises 
42. 
The ten PPEs shall submit audited entity financial statements in English to ADB within 6 
months  after  the  end  of  each  financial  year.  The  annual  audit  report  will  include  the  level  of 
compliance for each financial covenant contained in the loan and project agreements. FPG will 
submit to ADB a brief review of the PPEs' financial performance with key financial ratios as part 
of project progress reporting for the second quarter of every year during project implementation. 
The PPEs shall maintain a debt–equity ratio not exceeding 1.5 (60:40), a debt service coverage 
ratio  of  at  least  1.2,  and  a  current  ratio  of  at  least  1.0.  When  FPG  identifies  poor  financial 
performance  of  any  PPE,  the  PPMO  on  behalf  of  FPG,  shall  consult  with  ADB  regarding 
measures to be taken to resolve the problem, if deemed necessary. 
•  When audited project financial statements have not been received within 6 months after the due date, ADB will 
withhold  processing  of  requests  for  new  contract  awards  and  disbursement  such  as  new  replenishment  of 
imprest  accounts,  processing  of  new  reimbursement,  and  issuance  of  new  commitment  letters.  ADB  will  (i) 
inform  the  executing  agency  of  ADB’s  actions,  and  (ii)  advise  that  the  loan  may  be  suspended  if  the  audit 
documents are not received within the next 6 months.  
•  When  audited  project  financial  statements have  not been  received  within  12 months  after  the  due  date,  ADB 
may suspend the loan.

VI.
  PROCUREMENT AND CONSULTING SERVICES 
A. 
Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing 
All  advance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  will  be  undertaken  in  conformity  with 
43. 
ADB’s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  (ADB’s  Procurement 
Guidelines)29 and ADB’s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to 
time) (ADB’s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants).30 The issuance of invitations to bid under 
advance contracting and retroactive financing will be subject to ADB approval. It was explained 
to the executing agency, implementing agencies, and PIUs that (i) advance contracting includes 
the  advertisement,  bidding  documents,  (not  prequalification),  evaluation  of  bids  and  up  to  the 
recommendation  of  contracts  award,  and  that  all  steps  will  require  ADB’s  no  objection;    (ii) 
approval of advance contracting and retroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance the 
project; and (iii) where advance contracting is approved, ADB's approval must be sought for the 
draft prequalification and bidding documents before they are issued. 
Advance contracting. Advance contracting will include (i) tendering and bid evaluation 
44. 
for  civil  works  and  goods  contract  packages;  and  (ii)  awarding  of  contracts.  The  advance 
contracting includes 5 civil work contract packages and 3 goods supply contract packages.  
Retroactive  financing.  Under  retroactive  financing,  the  PIUs  would  implement  project 
45. 
activities using their own funds. The government was informed that as a general rule, retroactive 
financing  is  permitted  only  if  (i)  the  activities  are  required  to  be  part  of  the  detailed  project 
description and have been fully appraised by the ADB; (ii) the goods and  works, for which it is 
requested are on the basis of the approved procurement plan and are procured in accordance 
with  ADB’s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  ADB’s 
Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time); (iii) the amount to 
be retroactively financed does not exceed 20% of the loan amount; (iv) the due diligence on the 
proposed  contracts  for  advance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  on  engineering, 
environmental,  financial,  social  and  other  safeguard  requirements  has  completed  to  the 
satisfactory  of the  project  preparation  requirements;  and (v)  the  expenditures  must  have been 
incurred  before  the  loan  effectiveness  of  the  relevant  loan  but,  generally,  no  earlier  than  12 
months  before  signing  of  the  Loan  Agreement.  In  either  instance,  detailed  assessments  (due 
diligence)  on  each  retroactive  financing  proposal  must  demonstrate  that  (i)  the  expenditures 
incurred are genuine, reasonable, and material to getting the project off the ground; and (ii) they 
were  incurred  for  proper  reasons,  in  a  transparent  manner  over  a  reasonable  period  of  time. 
The  government  has  been  advised  that  approval  of  advance  contracting  and  retroactive 
financing does not commit ADB to finance the project. 
B. 
Procurement of Goods, Works, and Consulting Services 
All  procurement  of  goods  and  works  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB’s 
46. 
Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time).  
International competitive bidding (ICB) will be used for civil works contracts estimated to 
47. 
cost  $40  million  and  above.  National  competitive  bidding  (NCB)  will  be  used  for  civil  works 
contracts  estimated  to  cost  over  $200,000  equivalent  up  to  $40  million.  For  goods  and 
29  Available at: http://www.adb.org/Documents/Guidelines/Procurement/Guidelines-Procurement.pdf 
30  Available at: http://www.adb.org/Documents/Guidelines/Consulting/Guidelines-Consultants.pdf 
28 
equipment, ICB will be used for values exceeding $3 million, while NCB will be used for goods 
and  equipment  from  over  $100,000  to  below  $3  million  equivalent.  Contracts  for  goods  and 
works  estimated  to  cost  less  than  the  above  NCB  values  will  be  procured  using  shopping 
procedures. For ICB, all invitations for bids, bidding documents, bid evaluation reports, and draft 
negotiated  contracts  need  ADB’s  prior  review  and  approval. For  NCB,  invitations  for  bids, 
bidding  documents,  bid evaluation  reports,  and  draft  negotiated  contracts  for  the first  NCB  for 
civil works and the first NCB for goods regardless of the estimated contract amount need ADB’s 
prior  review  and  approval.  For  subsequent  NCB  packages,  invitations  for  bids,  bidding 
documents,  bid  evaluation  reports,  and  signed  contracts  provided  they  are  consistent  with 
previously approved documents will not require ADB’s prior review. However, such documents 
will be subject to post-review and must be submitted to ADB as soon as they are completed and 
issued,  but  no  later  than  one  month  after  their  issuance.  The  relevant  sections  of  ADB’s 
Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended from time to time)31 will be included in all procurement 
documents and contracts. 
48. 
Before  the  start  of  any  procurement,  ADB  and  the  government  will  review  the  public 
procurement  laws  of  the  central  and  state  governments  to  ensure  consistency  with  ADB’s 
Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time).  
49. 
An  18-month  procurement  plan  indicating  threshold  and  review  procedures,  goods, 
works, and consulting service contract packages and national competitive bidding guidelines is 
in Section C. 
All consultants will be recruited according to ADB’s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants 
50. 
(2013, as amended from time to time).32  
51. 
An estimated 62 person-months of consulting services during the whole implementation 
period  are  also  required  to  (i)  facilitate  project  management  and  implementation,  (ii)  provide 
capacity  building  and  institutional  strengthening,  and  (iii)  required  external  monitoring. 
Consulting services will be financed by the local counterpart funds, and the consultants are 
to be  engaged  through the government  procedures.  Loan Implementation Consultants (LIC), 
which  will  be  financed  by  FPG,  will  be  recruited  to  assist  the  PMO  in  managing  the  project 
implementation. The terms of reference of the LIC are in Annex 1.33  
C.

VII.
  SAFEGUARDS 
61. 
Prohibited  investment  activities.  Pursuant  to  ADB’s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement 
(2009),  ADB  funds  may  not  be  applied  to  the  activities  described  on  the  ADB  Prohibited 
Investment Activities List set forth at Appendix 5 of the Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). All 
financial institutions will ensure that their investments are in compliance with applicable national 
laws  and  regulations  and  will  apply  the  prohibited  investment  activities  list  (Appendix  5)  to 
subprojects financed by ADB. 
A. 
Environment 
62. 
Domestic  EIAs  and  consolidated  IEE.  The  project  is  classified  as  environmental 
category B. Environmental impact tables (EITs) were prepared for each of the subprojects and 
were reviewed and approved by the respective district/county environmental protection bureaus 
(EPBs).  The  methods  and  standards  applied  in  the  preparation  of  EITs  for  the  project 
components are in accordance with the guidelines of the Ministry of Environmental Protection, 
and also meet national and provincial laws and regulations. A consolidated initial environmental 
examination  (IEE),  including  an  environmental  management  plan  (EMP)  and  environmental 
monitoring  program,  was  prepared  which  complies  with  ADB’s  policies  and  requirements 
including ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). The IEE was disclosed in ADB website on 
February 2016.34 
63. 
Environmental  Management  Plan  (EMP).  An  EMP  has  been  developed  covering  all 
subprojects.  The  EMP  defines  all  potential  impacts  of  the  project  components,  mitigation

responsibilities, procedures and budgets for implementation of the environmental management. 
to  avoid  or  reduce 
levels,  and  defines 
to  acceptable 
these 
64. 
EMP Implementation Responsibilities. The FPG will have the overall accountability for 
the  overall  project  and  its  subprojects  for  ensuring  compliance  with  the  PRC’s  laws  and 
regulations  as  well  as  the  provisions  of  ADB’s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  As  the 
implementing  agencies,  each  municipal  government  will  be  accountable  for  ensuring  the 
implementation  of  the  environmental  management  plan  and  coordinating  the  environmental 
audit  and  monitoring  of  the  subproject(s)  in  the  respective  district/county.  The  district/county 
governments  (CPMOs)  will  be  responsible  for  ensuring  the  implementation  of  the  specific 
mitigation measures in cooperation with PIUs as prescribed in the EMP. 
The  PPMO,  through  the  environmental  officer,  and  in  coordination  with  the  Loan 
65. 
Implementation  Environmental  Consultant  (LIEC)  will  prepare  and  provide  the  following 
specification clauses for incorporation in the contract documents for project implementation: (i) 
environmental  management  requirements  to  be  budgeted  by  PIUs  and  their  construction 
contractors; (ii) environmental clauses for contractual terms and conditions; and (iii) the EMP. 
66. 
A  LIEC  will  be  contracted  by  the  PPMO  to  provide  assistance  during  the  pre-
construction,  construction  and  initial  operational  periods.  The  LIEC  should  be  contracted  as 
soon  as  possible  after  loan  approval  so  that  the  LIEC  can  assist  in  the  important  pre-
construction activities listed in the EMP.  The LIEC will advise the PMO, the CPMOs, and PIUs 
on  all  aspects  of  environmental  management  and  monitoring  for  the  Project.    The  LIEC  will 
34  http://www.adb.org/projects/documents/prc-fujian-farmland-sustainable-utilization-and-demonstration-project-iee 
59 
ensure  the  compliance  of  construction  and  initial  operation  activities  with  the  mitigation  and 
management measures in the EMP and report to the ADB. 
67. 
Each  PIU  will  be  responsible  for  (i)  implementing  the  EMP  and  developing  further 
implementation  details;  (ii)  supervising  their  staff  and contractors’  implementation  of  mitigation 
measures  during  construction;  (iii)  implementing  training  programs  for  construction  crews;  (iv) 
incorporating  environmental  management,  monitoring,  and  mitigation  measures 
into 
construction and operation management plans; (v) developing and implementing internal regular 
environmental  monitoring;  (vi)  redressing  public  grievances;  and (vii)  reporting  performance of 
the EMP to CPMOs. 
68. 
The  environment  performance  of  the  project  will  be  verified  by  external  environmental 
monitoring stations (EMS). The EMSs  will be contracted by the PIUs using proceeds from the 
counterpart funds. The EMSs will conduct the external monitoring of EMP implementation. The 
results will be forwarded to the CPMOs and to the EPBs at the district/county level, delegated 
by  provincial  EPD,  who  will  ensure  compliance  with  the  PRC  and  local  environmental 
regulations. 
69. 
Training.  Environmental  officers  in  PPMO,  and  CPMOs  will  receive  training  in 
environmental  management,  environmental  monitoring  and  supervision,  mitigation  planning, 
emergency  response,  environmental  policy-making,  and  other  environmental  management 
techniques.  PPMO  will  ensure  that  the  training  plan  defined  in  the  EMP  is  implemented.  The 
LIEC  will  facilitate  training.  The  scope  of  training  will  also  include  the  efficient  and  effective 
environmental monitoring at the project operation phase. 
70. 
EMP  Costs.  Cost  estimates  for  mitigation  measures,  environmental  monitoring,  and 
training in EMP procedures are estimated in the EMP. The PIUs will bear the internal monitoring 
costs as part of their implementation functions, and the cost of external monitoring by the EMSs. 
Before  implementing  a  monitoring  plan,  responsible  agencies  will  present  a  more  detailed 
breakdown of the estimated budget. During project implementation, the budgets will be adjusted 
based  on  actual  requirements.  PIUs  and  their  contractors  will  bear  the  costs  for  all  mitigation 
measures during construction, which will be included in the contract documents. The PIUs will 
also bear the costs related to mitigation measures during operation. 
B. 
Involuntary Resettlement 
The  project  will  not  require  land  expropriation  and  will  not  involve  residential  house 
71. 
demolition activities. That is because any activities involved  with land expropriation and house 
demolition were excluded from the project during the stage of pre-feasibility study review. Some 
farm  land  may  be  impacted  permanently  or  temporarily,  requiring  land  readjustment  and/or 
compensation within the village, during the construction of farming facilities. 
72. 
A Resettlement Framework (RF) has been prepared and agreed by ADB and the PPMO 
(i)  to  ensure  that  all  subprojects  comply  with  ADB  safeguard  objectives,  principles,  and 
requirements,  and  (ii)  to  provide  guidance  on  screening  and  categorization,  assessment, 
planning,  institutional  arrangements,  grievance  mechanism,  and  processes  to  be  followed  for 
subprojects that are prepared after Board approval. The results of subproject screening will be 
submitted  to  ADB  for  review  and  concurrence.  During  the  detail  design  stage,  if  there  are 
involuntary  resettlement  impacts,  detailed  impact  assessments  will  be  undertaken  and  a 
subproject  resettlement  plan  (RP)  will  be  prepared  in  conformity  with  the  RF  and  will  be 
submitted to ADB for review and approval prior to award of the related civil works. RPs will also 
60 
be disclosed to affected villages and posted on ADB website in accordance with ADB’s Public 
Communication Policy (2011). 
73. 
The  FPG/PPMO  will  have  the  overall  accountability  for  the  overall  project  and  its 
subprojects  for  ensuring  compliance  with  the  PRC’s  laws  and  regulations  as  well  as  the 
provisions  of  ADB’s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  As  the  implementing  agencies, 
municipal/county  governments  and  their  PMOs  (CPMOs)  will  be  responsible  for  ensuring 
screening resettlement impacts and preparation of subproject RPs based on the detailed design 
in accordance with the RF. 
74. 
The PPMO social officer supported by a resettlement consultant will provide necessary 
technical  support  and  guidance  to  the  CPMOs  and  coordinate  their  activities  on  resettlement. 
Each CPMO will be responsible for (i) implementing the RF, and RPs; (ii) supervising their staff; 
(iii) implementing training programs; (v) implementing internal regular monitoring; (vi) redressing 
public grievances; and (vii) reporting progress to PPMO. The PPMO will compile and submit the 
monitoring reports to ADB. The resettlement consultant’s TOR included in Annex 1. 
C. 
Land Use Rights Transfer Contracts and Land Cooperation Agreements 
75. 
The  total  land  rehabilitation  and  development  area  under  19  project  enterprises  is 
269,128.50  mu,  including:  (i)  5,098.50  mu  state-owned  land;  (ii)  37,536  mu  land  leased  by 
seven  PPEs  from  villages/farmers;  (iii)  70,314  mu  land  under  cooperation  arrangements  with 
villages/farmers by six PPEs and four SOEs; and (iv) 156,180 mu village land to be supported 
by  five  SOEs  as public  welfares. The  PPTA  has  undertaken  the  due diligence on  land leases 
and cooperation contracts and has concluded that these do not trigger IR.35 The due diligence 
has also concluded that legal procedures were followed, parties were informed and consulted, 
agreements  were  voluntary,  and farmers  will  benefit  from  land  rents,  jobs,  trainings  and  other 
benefits under the contracts. A few procedural deficiencies identified have been corrected and a 
follow-up action plan has been prepared. Although the IR safeguard is not triggered, there are 
still  concerns  related  to  the  implementation  of  land  transfer  contracts  and  benefit  sharing. 
Therefore,  an  independent  monitoring  agency  will  be  engaged  by  PPMO  to  continue  to  verify 
and  monitor 
the  project 
implementation up until project completion. Reports will be submitted to ADB and PPMO semi-
annually. 
these  contracts  and  agreements  during 
implementation  of 
D. 
Ethnic Minorities 
76. 
According  to  the  PPTA  survey,  none  of  the  19  ethnic  minority  townships  in  Fujian  are 
located in the 13 project counties. There are also no ethnic minority villages or ethnic minority 
populations in the 122 project villages and 51 towns/townships. Therefore, the project has been 
classified as C on Indigenous Peoples and no further action is required. 
E. 
Grievance Redress Mechanism. 
 A  grievance redress  mechanism  (GRM)  has  been  established to prevent  and address 
77. 
community concerns, reduce risks, and assist the project to maximize environmental and social 
benefits.  The  PPMO  will  act  as  head  office  for  the  GRM,  establishing  a  tracking  and 
35 The Due Diligence  Report on Land Use Rights Transfers and Cooperation Agreements  as supplementary linked 
document available on request. 
documentation system of complaints and responses. The CPMOs will operate the GRM at the 
local  level  through  their  Environment  and  Social  Officers.  The  CPMOs  will  ensure  that  all 
complaints  received  and  immediately  resolved  by  PIUs  are  reported,  and  that  more  difficult 
issues  are  referred  to  the  CPMO  for  coordinated  response.  The  CPMO  will  pass  all  GRM 
records to the PPMO.

VIII.   GENDER AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS 
78. 
Social  and  poverty  dimensions.  A  poverty  and  social  analysis  (PSA)  that  included  a 
household survey, community, and focus group discussions, and key informant interviews, was 
conducted  during  the  PPTA.  The  proposed  project  through  demonstration  of  sustainable 
utilization  of  farmland  resources  will  benefit  the  local  population  in  122  villages  in  51  project 
towns/townships.  The  contribution  to  poverty  alleviation  will  be  largely  due  to:  (i)  developing 
demonstration productive farmland including land leveling, soil improvement, access road, and 
irrigation systems, which will directly benefit about 16,397 households and 62,507 persons, and 
indirectly  benefit  the  remainder  of  the  rural  households  in  the  51  project  towns/townships;  (ii) 
promoting  modern  farming  practices  and  locally-adapted,  higher-yielding  varieties,  which  will 
increase  production  and  incomes  of  the  local  population;  (iii)  providing  training  and  technical 
support  to  beneficiary  villagers;  and  (iv)  generating  about  3,200  permanent  jobs  and  58,400 
temporary  unskilled  job  opportunities  during  construction  and  operation.36  In  addition,  indirect 
benefits  relating  to  promotion  of  more  sustainable  farming  practices  in  nearby  villages  will 
narrow the disparities in similar regions of Fujian Province. 
79. 
Gender dimension. The project is classified by ADB as effective gender mainstreaming 
and  anticipated  to  directly  benefit  about  26,826  women  from  their  involvement  in  on-farm 
activities  and  off-farm  based  waged  employment  opportunities  provided  by  the  PIUs.  Through 
the  social  survey,  it  was  found  that  since  more  men  go  out  for  work  during  the  off-peak  farm

in modern agricultural and farming technologies. 
Social  Development  and  Gender  action  plans.  The  gender  action  plan  (GAP,  Table 
80. 
IX.1)  and  the  social  development  action  plan  (SDAP,  Table  IX.2)  were  prepared jointly  by  the 
PMO  and  the  participating  local  governments,  with  the  assistance  of  the  PPTA  social  and 
gender specialists. The purpose of GAP and SDAP is to ensure that relevant gender and social 
issues  are  addressed  by  specific  actions/measures  during  the  project  implementation,  and 
implementation of these mitigates potential negative impacts and enhances project benefits for 
women, poor and other vulnerable people. The GAP and SDAP ensure suitable avenues will be 
available for participation of women, poor and vulnerable people and include realistic measures 
for maximizing their participation in local decision-making. Additionally, the GAP and SDAP put 
in  place  measures  to  mitigate  possible  negative  impacts  and  reduce  risks  of  the  project.  The 
tables below provide details of the GAP and SDAP, including specific actions, target indicators 
and  responsibilities.  The  costs  for  these  actions  are  included  in  the  Project  management 
budget.

Monitoring  
Project performance monitoring.37 To monitor the progress of the project in achieving 
81. 
the  planned  outcome  and  outputs,  the  PPMO  will  establish  a  project  performance  monitoring 
system (PPMS) before the project implementation starts (before the loan effectiveness), and will 
maintain  accordingly.  The  basis  for  project  performance  monitoring  and  reporting  will  be  the 
DMF, which identifies performance targets for the outcomes and outputs of the project. It will be 
designed  to  permit  adequate  flexibility  to  adopt  remedial  action  regarding  project  design, 
schedules,  activities,  and development  impacts. The  PPMS  will  cover  the following  aspects of 
the project implementation: (i) project physical and financial progress; (ii) progress and results of 
capacity  development;  (iii)  farmer  institutions  establishment;  (iv)  implementation  of  EMP;  (v) 
implementation of GAP, SDAP, RF; and (vi) compliance  with loan covenants (policy, financial, 
economic, sector, and others). The PPMO agreed and confirmed that they will (i) establish the 
PPMS  before  the  loan  effectiveness;  (ii)  recruit  the  LICs  before  the  loan  effectiveness  to 
facilitate the project start-up and provide consulting service as described in Annex 1; (iii) confirm 
that targets are achievable; and (iv) develop recording, monitoring and reporting arrangements. 
82.  With  inputs  from  the  MPMOs,  CPMOs,  PIUs,  and  other  stakeholders,  the  PPMO  will 
prepare  the  project  progress  report  quarterly.  Disaggregated  baseline  data  for  output  and 
outcome  indicators  gathered  during  project  preparation  will  be  updated  and  reported  in  the 
quarterly reports and after each ADB review mission. At the start of project implementation, the 
PPMO, MPMOs, CPMOs, PIUs and ADB will develop integrated PPMS procedures to generate 
data systematically on the inputs and outputs, as well as the indicators to be used to measure 
the project’s impact and outcome taking into account the project scope. 
83. 
Safeguards monitoring. Three types of project monitoring will be conducted under the 
EMP: (i) internal monitoring and supervision and reporting by each PIU; (ii) EMP implementation 
monitoring and progress reporting by the loan implementation environmental consultant (LIEC); 
and (iii) environmental compliance monitoring by local EMSs. 
84. 
The  project  monitoring  program  focuses  on  the  environment  in  the  project  areas  of 
influence in the 13 project counties (Tables A1.3a and A1.3b in the EMP). The program covers 
the  scope  of  monitoring,  monitoring  parameters,  time  and  frequency,  implementing  and 
supervising agencies, and estimated costs. The monitoring shall comply with the methodology 
provided 
relevant  national  environmental  monitoring  standards  and  national 
environmental quality standards of air, surface water, groundwater and noise, and the pollutant 
discharge standards (Table A1.4 in the EMP).

for conducting internal environmental monitoring in accordance with the monitoring plan (Table 
A1.3a in the EMP). Results will be reported through the PIU reports to the CPMOs. 
86. 
EMP  implementation  monitoring  and  progress  reporting.  The  LIEC  will  review 
project  progress  and  compliance  with  the  EMP  based  on  field  visits,  and  the  review  of  the 
environmental monitoring conducted by the EMS. The findings of the LIECs will be reported to 
ADB through the semiannual EMP monitoring and progress reports. The reports will include (i) 
progress  made  in  EMP  implementation,  (ii)  overall  effectiveness  of  the  EMP  implementation 
(including  public  and  occupational  health  and  safety),  (iii)  environmental  monitoring  and 
compliance, (iv) institutional strengthening and training, (v) public consultation (including GRM), 
and  (vi)  any  problems  encountered  during  construction  and  operation,  and  the  relevant 
corrective  actions  undertaken.  The  LIEC  will  help  PMO  prepare  the  reports  and  submit  the 
English report to ADB for appraisal and disclosure. 
87. 
Environmental compliance monitoring by local EMS. The PIUs in each city or county 
will contract the city or county EMS to conduct environmental monitoring in accordance with the 
monitoring  program  (Table  A1.3b  in  the  EMP).  A  detailed  cost  breakdown  will  be  provided  by 
the county environmental monitoring station (EMS) when the environmental monitoring program 
is updated at the start of each component implementation. Monitoring will be conducted during 
construction and operation period, until a PCR is issued. Semi-annual monitoring reports will be 
prepared by the EMSs and submitted to CPMOs and the PIUs. 
88. 
The environmental monitoring results will be compared with relevant PRC performance 
standards (Table A1.4 in the EMP). Non-compliance with these standards will be highlighted in 
the monitoring reports. Monitoring results will be submitted to the CPMOs and then reported by 
the PPMO to ADB in semi-annual environmental monitoring reports (prepared with the support 
of the LIEC; Table A1.5 in the EMP). 
Resettlement Monitoring. During the project implementation, the PPMO will submit to 
89. 
ADB  semi-annual  resettlement  monitoring  reports.  The  PPMO  will  conduct  internal  monitoring 
and engage an external monitor to  verify compliance and evaluate results. The external monitor 
will verify and monitor (i) LURT and cooperation contracts, (ii) internal land adjustments, and (iii) 
implementation of the resettlement framework (screening process) and subproject resettlement 
plans.  Assistance  will  be  provided  for  the  PPMO  and  CPMOs  by  the  social  consultant.  The 
reporting  requirements  are  included  in  the  Resettlement  Framework  and  will  be  specified  in 
each subproject resettlement plan.

In  particular,  the  activities  laid  out  in  the  GAP  and  SDAP  will  be  monitored,  and  sex-
disaggregated data on project activities collected. GAP and SDAP monitoring information will be 
included  in  the  semi-annual  social  monitoring  reports  and  will  describe  the  progress  on  GAP 
and  SDAP  implementation  against  the  targets.  The  format  of  social  monitoring  report  will  be 
finalized and agreed between ADB and the PPMO during the project inception.

91. 
In  addition  to  regular  monitoring,  project  performance  will  be  reviewed  at  least  once  a 
year  jointly  by  ADB  and  FPG.  The  review  will  assess  implementation  performance  and 
achievement  of  project  outcomes  and  outputs,  assess  financial  progress,  identify  issues  and 
constraints  affecting  implementation,  and  work  out  a  time-bound  action  plan  for  their  solution. 
ADB will undertake annual project reviews during the project period. Additionally, ADB and HPG 
will undertake a midterm review of the project in 2019, covering all institutional, administrative, 
financial, 
organizational, 
procurement,  and  other  relevant  aspects  that  may  have  an  impact  on  the  performance  of  the 
project  and  its  continuing  viability.  The  review  will  (i)  examine  the  progress  in  implementing 
project  outputs;  (ii)  evaluate  environment,  social,  and  poverty  impact;  (iii)  ensure  compliance 
with  assurances  in  the  loan  agreement;  and  (iv)  evaluate  effectiveness  of  the  procurement

Stakeholder Communication Strategy  
94. 
In  accordance  with  ADB's  Public  Communications  Policy  2011,  project  information  will 
be disseminated by way of public consultation, the Government and the ADB website disclosure 
mechanisms,  conferences,  interviews,  focus  group  discussions  and  community  consultation 
meetings, and communication. During the consultation meetings, CPMOs will provide necessary 
information such as grievance mechanism and other information to participants, including male, 
female, poor, vulnerable groups and other individuals. 
95. 
During preparation of SDAP, GAP, RF and EMP, consultation meetings were carried out 
at  different  times  and  locations,  not  only  to  introduce  specific  plan  contents,  but  also  to 
encourage villagers to voice their own opinions and suggestions, and their concerns; in addition, 
more consultation activities will be held during detailed design and project implementation with a 
focus on female, poor, and other vulnerable groups. The stakeholder communication strategy is 
provided in Table 14. 
Consultation  and  Participation  during  Project

Implementation.  To  ensure 
meaningful  participation  by  project  stakeholders  and  effective  implementation  of  project 
activities, 
include 
further  consultations  and  participation  will  be  undertaken.  This  will 
consultations  with  local  villages  on  detailed  scope  and  schedule  of  proposed  construction 
activities  and  detailed  discussions  on  terms  of  cooperation  between  enterprises  and  local 
villagers.  The  purpose  of  such  consultations  is  to  ensure  local  farmers  have  a  clear 
understanding  of the  proposed  project  activities and to obtain their  agreement for  carrying  out 
such activities. 
97. 
The following measures will be implemented to ensure the participation of farmers: 
Consultation  with  farmers  will  be  held  on  a  regular  basis.  This  is  to  understand  their

ANTICORRUPTION POLICY 
98. 
ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any violations of the 
Anticorruption  Policy  relating  to  the  Project.40  All  contracts  financed  by  ADB  shall  include 
provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the 
executing agency and all Project contractors, suppliers, consultants and other service providers. 
Individuals/entities  on  ADB’s  anticorruption  debarment  list  are  ineligible  to  participate  in  ADB-
financed activity and may not be awarded any contracts under the Project.41  
99. 
To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  are  included  in  the  loan  and  project 
agreement  and  the  bidding documents for the  Project.  The  project  design  and implementation 
arrangements provide for mitigating corruption risks. Risks associated with project management 
will  be  mitigated  by  (i)  training  of  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies’  staff  in  the 
procurement of civil works, goods, and services under the project; and (ii) periodic inspection of 
contractors’  activities  related  to  fund  withdrawals  and  settlements  by  the  executing  agency’s 
staff. 
XI. 
ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISM 
100.  People who are, or may in the future be, adversely affected by the project may submit 
complaints  to  ADB’s  Accountability  Mechanism.  The  Accountability  Mechanism  provides  an 
independent  forum  and  process  whereby  people  adversely  affected  by  ADB-assisted  projects 
can voice, and seek a resolution of their problems, as well as report alleged violations of ADB’s 
operational  policies  and  procedures.  Before  submitting  a  complaint  to  the  Accountability 
Mechanism, affected people should make a good faith effort to solve their problems by working 
with  the  concerned  ADB  operations  department.  Only  after  doing  that,  and  if  they  are  still 
dissatisfied, should they approach the Accountability Mechanism.42

ANNEX 2: SUBPROJECT SELECTION CRITERIA AND GUIDING PRINCIPLES 
A.  
Introduction 
The provincial project managent offices’ (PPMO) main focus on selection criteria relates 
1. 
to: (i) meeting essential requirements for government supporting policies in the midwest of the 
People’s  Republic  of  China  (PRC);  (ii)  continuing  to  focus  on,  and  involve,  key  soil  erosion-
prone counties, and poverty alleviation counties; and (iii) including integrated demonstration of 
sustainable  farmland  development,  modern  agriculture  development,  environmental  benefits, 
and poverty alleviation. 
2. 
Discussion  of  project  area  and  subproject  selection  criteria  started  between  Asian 
Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  PPMO  in  early  2014.  Following  project  preparatory  technical 
assistance (PPTA) commencement, selection criteria have been further discussed between the 
PPTA team, PPMO and the ADB team. A key conclusion was that selection criteria should be 
separated  into  selection  criteria,  which  would  be  used  to  select  participating  counties  and 
subprojects,  and  guiding  principles,  which  would  need  to  be  followed  to  ensure  sound 
subproject  design  and  implementation.  Selection  criteria  and  guiding  principles  are  outlined 
below. 
B.  
Selection Criteria 
i. 
Project County Selection Criteria 
3. 
Project counties should meet both the following poverty and technical criteria: 
(i)  Poverty criteria: Counties must be key provincial-level poverty alleviation counties and/or 
less developed counties eligible for the central government's support for the middle and 
western provinces in the PRC; 
(ii)  Priority  should  be  given  to  key  soil  erosion-prone  counties  with  demonstrable  erosion 
problems; and/or  
(iii) Counties  in  modern  agriculture  demonstration  zones  complying  with  ADB’s  project 
design which follows the principles of (a) sustainable development of agricultural land for 
economic  purposes;  (b)  emphasis  on  environment,  soil  and  water  resource  protection; 
and (c) ensuring there is opportunity to participate in equitable benefit sharing from the 
project  which  promotes  cooperation  between  farmer  households,  cooperatives  and 
project enterprises. 
ii. 
Subproject Selection Criteria 
Subproject  selection  criteria  comprise  those  related  to  site,  activities,  community’s 
4. 
acceptance, and participating project enterprises’ (PPE) requirements, in particular: 
(i)  Subprojects should avoid all ecologically sensitive areas, including protected areas (all 
types  of  national  and  provincial  reserves,  reservoirs,  etc.),  wetlands  protected  areas, 
water  resources  protection  areas,  documented  sites  for  rare  or  threatened  flora  and 
fauna (including nationally protected species), and rare, threatened, or restricted-range 
habitats. It is assumed that these areas are identified and clearly described by the local 
(county) government. In the event that such sites are only detected in the PPTA stage, 
PMO  and  ADB  would  also  review  the  need  to  remove  the  proposed  site  from  the 
project. 
84 
(ii)  Land with a slope of >25º should not be chosen for crop production. For these slopes, 
although  the  soil  and  water  conservation  law  indicates  that  planting  perennials  in 
combination  with  adequate  erosion  control  measures  is  allowed,  only  sites  that  have 
been used before should be considered for rehabilitation. Design of these sloping sites 
should be such that risk of failure (e.g. collapse of terrace walls) is minimal. Otherwise, 
the  area  will  be  kept  as  is,  or  improved  as  natural  forest  area  with  minimum 
disturbance.  
(iii)  Activities proposed for support by the project should focus on farmland preparation and 
its  related  infrastructure,  and  related  green  and  sustainable  production  activities. 
Activities that will not be supported by the project include investment for (a) processing, 
(b)  construction  of  new  reservoirs  (capacity  over  100,000  m3  and/or  dam  wall  height 
greater  than  15  meters),  and  (c)  civil  works  for  training  and/or  testing  centers.  Road 
construction  activities  should  be  classified  by  use,  size and road surface.  Selection of 
road construction activities to be supported by the project will be assessed on the need 
for, fit with the project objectives as well as economic and financial viability.   
(iv)  Subprojects  must  be  favorable  to  villagers  in  sharing  potential  benefits:  in  particular 
they  must  support  close  cooperation  among  PPEs  and  cooperatives/villagers,  with  an 
emphasis  on  land  areas  under  various  cooperative  management  arrangements 
between PPEs and village cooperatives. 
(v)  Subproject  PPEs  must  be  willing  to  invest  in  farmland  reclamation,  ecological 
construction with demonstration and technical piloting.  
(vi)  For  any  sub-projects  with  "associated  facilities"  (as  defined  by  ADB's  SPS),  those 
facilities will already have all relevant domestic environmental and/or social approvals. 
Associated facilities are facilities that are not funded as part of the project (funding may 
be  provided  separately  by  the  borrower/client  or  by  third  parties),  and  whose  viability 
and  existence  depend  exclusively  on  the  project  and  whose  goods  or  services  are 
essential for successful operation of the project, e.g. processing facilities. 
(vii)   Revenue-generating  PPEs  must  have  sufficient  collateral  to  match  requested  ADB 
financing. 
(viii) Revenue-generating PPEs must have adequate financial capacity for repayment based 
on key financial ratios, including a current and projected debt–equity ratio not exceeding 
1.5 (60:40), a debt service coverage ratio of at least 1.2, and a current ratio of at least 
1.0. 
(ix)  PPEs  must  have  clear  use  rights  of  land  without  disputes  and  contracts  meeting  the 
willingness of land rights entities. 
(x)  PPEs  must  have  stable  cooperation  mechanisms  between  the  lead  enterprise  and 
farmers through contracts/collaboration/ownership. 
(xi)  All  subprojects  should  meet 
financial  and  economic  viability  assessment 
requirements  (i.e.,  positive  net  present  value  or  internal  rate  of  return  higher  than  the 
cost of capital).

C.  
Technical Guiding Principles – Subprojects 
Technical guiding principles relate to those practices that are required to ensure that the 
5. 
subprojects meet the requirements for reduced soil erosion and sustainable farming systems, in 
particular: 
(i)  All activities for the modification of land use, including preparation for either cropland or 
forest plantation, should comply with strict regulations in order that exposure to erosive 
forces  is  kept  to  a  minimum.  Land  clearing  must  be  conducted  according  to  technical 
specifications  of  soil  and  water  conservation  for  slope  land.  Building  terraces  and  soil 
tillage  have  to  be  carried  out  along  contours  and  keeping  vegetation  between  contour 
terraces to prevent soil erosion.  
(ii)  In  the  choice  of  new  crops  or  new  farming  systems,  the  protection  of  the  soil  must  be 
ensured. For any new system or crop, the time and degree of exposure to erosive forces 
must  be  taken  into  consideration.  This  is  critical  for  crops  that  develop  slowly  or  form 
little canopy  (such  as onions)  or  farming/cultivation systems  where soil  has  to be  tilled 
intensively for seedbed preparation.  
(iii) Recommendations of fertilizer application (rates) based on local soil and crop conditions 
MUST be followed to avoid non-point source pollution. 
(iv) Subprojects  involving  transfer  of  contracted  land  must  not  include  either  land-lease 
arrangements  against  current  laws  and  regulations  concerning  land  or  land-lease 
arrangements  signed  by  village  officials  without  knowledge  and  consent  of  village 
members.  For  transfer  of  un-contracted  land,  village  representatives  meeting  records 
and signatures are required. 
(v)  Participating PPEs and farmer cooperatives must be committed to adopting international 
best-practices  for  soil  and  water  management  and  conservation  within  their  project 
designs.  
The selection of project counties and project participating enterprises in compliance with 
6. 
selection criteria are shown in Table 1 and Table 2.

Financial indicators are calculated from the PPEs’ financial statement (showing in the Remark). 
Negative debt service coverages of Fujian Jinxi Tea Co., Ltd, Fujian Houde Agro-forestry Ecological Co., Ltd and Fujian Farm Business Tea Co., Ltd are caused 
by interest earning of PIUs’ bank deposit which is more than its interest payment.  These 3 PIUs had no any liabilities in 2014.
