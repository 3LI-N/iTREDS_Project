Project Administration Manual Purpose and Process 
1.  The  project  administration  manual  (PAM)  describes  the  essential  administrative  and 
management requirements to implement the project on time, within budget, and in accordance 
with the policies and procedures of the government and Asian Development Bank (ADB). The 
PAM should include references to all available templates and instructions either through linkages 
to relevant URLs or directly incorporated in the PAM. 
2.  The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region (Xinjiang) Government as the executing agency, and 
Fukang  City  Government,  Hutubi  County  Government,  and  Qitai  County  Government  as 
implementing agencies, are wholly responsible for the implementation of ADB-financed projects, 
as  agreed  jointly  between  the  borrower  and  ADB,  and  in  accordance  with  the  policies  and 
procedures of the government and ADB. ADB staff is responsible for supporting implementation 
including  compliance  by  Xinjiang  Government  as  the  executing  agency,  and  Fukang  City 
Government,  Hutubi  County  Government,  and  Qitai  County  Government  as  implementing 
agencies of their obligations and responsibilities for project implementation in accordance with 
ADB’s policies and procedures. 
3.  At loan negotiations, the borrower and ADB shall agree to the PAM and ensure consistency with 
the loan agreement. Such agreement shall be reflected in the minutes of the loan negotiations. 
In the event of any discrepancy or contradiction between the PAM and the loan agreement, the 
provisions of the loan agreement shall prevail. 
4.  After  ADB  Board  approval  of  the  project's  report  and  recommendations  of  the  President 
(RRP),  changes  in  implementation  arrangements  are  subject  to  agreement  and  approval 
pursuant to relevant government and ADB administrative procedures (including the Project 
Administration Instructions) and upon such approval, they will be subsequently incorporated 
in the PAM. 
I. 
PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
Rationale 
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region (Xinjiang) is located on the northwestern frontier of 
1. 
the PRC. It shares borders with eight countries and lies on the ancient Silk Road. Xinjiang’s rapid 
rate of economic growth (9.8%) and urbanization since the early 1990s has improved the overall 
economic  well-being  of  its residents.1 Urumqi,  the  capital  city  of Xinjiang, serves as a  regional 
transportation  and  logistics  hub  between  the  PRC  and  Central  Asia.  The  value  of  Xinjiang’s 
international trade increased during 2001–2013 at an average annual rate of 25.7%.2 However, 
Xinjiang remains one of the PRC’s least developed regions, and as such has been a beneficiary 
of the National Strategy for Development of the Western Region.3 The region also suffers from 
poor industrial performance and low educational attainment among workers.4  
2. 
Changji covers an area of 73,140 square kilometers, and is situated on a narrow piedmont 
plain between the Tianshan mountain ranges in the south and the Gurbantunggut Desert in the 
north;  the  corridor  (40–80  kilometers  [km]  in  width)  contains  settlements,  agriculture,  and 
industries. Changji surrounds Urumqi; Changji City (seat of the prefecture) is located 30 km from 
Urumqi. Changji is located at the center of the Northern Tianshan economic zone, the Urumqi–
Changji–Shihezi  city  cluster,  and  the  Urumqi–Changji  economic  corridor.  This  location  gives 
Changji  an  important  role,  and  some  key  service  activities  provided  by  Urumqi  have  been 
relocated  to  Changji.  It  is  urbanizing  rapidly  reflecting  the  PRC’s  strategy  to  accelerate  the 
development of the western regions and its policy to promote regional economic cooperation with 
neighboring countries, but the Prefecture’s economic development is constrained by significant 
deficiencies  in  urban  infrastructure  and  environmental  management,  including  (i)  inadequate 
connectivity of Changji’s cities and towns to the major corridor, (ii) poor service-level solid waste 
management, (iii) rapid depletion of groundwater supplies, (iv) soil erosion caused by geologic 
and severe climatic conditions, and (v) weak urban management capacity. Changji’s favorable 
location  and  its  potential  for  economic growth  encourages  companies  and  industries to  locate 
there,  and  has  resulted  in  increased  pressure  on  the  environment  and  the  inadequate,  poorly 
performing urban infrastructure.  
Fukang  City  and  Hutubi  and  Qitai  counties  of  Changji,  located  in  the  Urumqi–Changji 
3. 
economic  corridor,  have  experienced  significant  economic  growth  during  1994–2014,  driven 
mainly by growth in urban-based secondary and tertiary sectors, and rural-based primary sector.5 
Consequently, an appropriate urbanization process—involving both physical and social aspects 
of  urbanization—is  needed  to  accommodate  the  rural–urban  shift  of  economic  activities.  An 
industrial demand analysis conducted during project preparation projected significant demand for 
employees  and  industrial  land  in  Fukang,  Hutubi,  and  Qitai.  However,  the  current  business 
environment and urban infrastructure facilities in Fukang, Hutubi, and Qitai are relatively weak. 
Many people living in the urban center, peripheries, and villages within the urban area—a large 
number  of  whom  are  rural  migrants—still  lack  access  to  safe  and  reliable  basic  urban

municipality. 
4  A 2014 labor market survey of Xinjiang indicated 71.8% of enterprises experienced difficulties finding appropriately 
skilled  workers;  69.0%  experienced  difficulties  in  recruitment,  including  30.1%  with  difficulties  in  recruiting 
technicians.  G. Wang, et al. 2014. Research on Workforce Demand and Supply in Enterprises. Xinjiang.  
5  Average  annual  GDP  growth  rates  in  Fukang, Hutubi, and Qitai   in  2004–2014 were 8.6%–9.1% in the primary 
sector, 13.7%–30.3% in the secondary sector, and 13.4%–15.3% in the tertiary sector.

infrastructure services. Establishment of a sound economic base and livable environment requires 
that Fukang, Hutubi, and Qitai respond to economic and social development challenges, and take 
advantage  of  the  economic  growth  opportunities  available  to  cities  and  towns  in  the  Urumqi–
Changji economic corridor. 
4. 
Value added by Asian Development Bank assistance. The Asian Development Bank 
(ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance involving rigorous  policy dialogue and 
engagement, and supported adoption by the government of a strategic, holistic, and integrated 
multisector people-centered urban development approach as compared to construction-focused 
approach  in  Changji.6 This  aligns  with  the  PRC’s  National  New-type  Urbanization  Plan,  2014–
2020 (NNUP),7 and ADB’s country partnership strategy for the PRC, 2016–2020.8 In addition to 
engineering solutions to address basic infrastructure needs and environmental issues, Changji 
recognized the importance of adding nonstructural components (as part of outputs 2, 4, and 5) to 
the  project  to  address  issues  including  the  needs  to  (i)  strengthen  urban  planning  capacity, 
introduce  people-centered approaches to  urban planning  and  development  consistent  with the 
PRC Government’s urbanization direction, and apply people-centered approaches during master 
plan  updates  that  may  be  undertaken  during  project  implementation;  (ii)  address  the  needs  of 
workers  and  employers  by  enhancing  the  quality  of  technical  and  vocational  education  and 
training; and (iii) improve solid waste management and raise environmental awareness by piloting 
waste reduction, reuse, and recycling in Xinjiang. The original project scope mainly focusing on 
roads  and  pipes  was  completely  transformed  by  ADB  intervention  into  strategic  multisector, 
people-centered  urbanization,  and  sustainable  approach.  A  climate  risk  and  vulnerability 
assessment (CRVA) was conducted confirming the project’s medium climate risk categorization. 
A list of design and engineering strategies that address the vulnerabilities identified in the CRVA 
has been incorporated into the design of project components.  
5. 
Development  prospects  in  the  project  areas  are  attracting  rural  migrants  to  industrial 
centers  in  search  of  employment  opportunities.  In  line  with  the  NNUP,  the  project  aims  to 
demonstrate a modern, innovative approach to urban–rural development that creates integrated, 
livable, green, and economically sustainable communities.9 In addition to physical infrastructure, 
the project’s integrated social infrastructure components seek to facilitate the transition of rural 
migrants to the urban environment by providing them with skills to take advantage of employment 
and income opportunities in emerging communities around the industrial zones. High economic 
growth  together  with  improved  business  and  living  environments  resulting  from  project 
investments  could  attract  additional  private  sector  investments,  with  spillover  effects  on  small 
cities and county towns along the strategic economic corridor, including Fukang, Hutubi, and Qitai. 
The experience in Changji could serve as a demonstration project for other small cities and towns 
in Xinjiang and the PRC. 
6  Initially, the government proposal included 67 new road segments of 137 km, which justification was identified to be 
inadequate to contribute to sustainable or resilient development, as they are widely dispersed, unconnected, and 
simply  fill  gaps  in  the  master  plans  to  expand  the  urban  areas  in  the  three  city  and  counties.  The  proposal  was 
reduced to 22 segments of 36.4 km, including both new and rehabilitated roads, that are assessed to be justifiable 
for ADB investment. Furthermore, ADB organized a New-type Urbanization workshop to engage with stakeholders 
to  share  information  on  how  Changji’s  project  proposal  for  ADB  investment  aligns  with  the  sustainable  urban 
development agenda of the PRC. This participatory workshop was in itself an innovation for Changji.

Strategic fit. The proposed project closely aligns with the (i) the PRC’s Thirteenth Five-
6. 
Year Plan, which aims to balance the development of rural and urban areas to facilitate inclusive 
urbanization and industrial transformation;10 (ii) the NNUP (footnote 7), which promotes people-
centered urbanization and development of small and medium-sized cities and towns; (iii) the ADB 
country  partnership  strategy  for  the  PRC,  2016–2020  (footnote  8),  with  strategic  priorities that 
include (a) integrated, green, inclusive, and competitive urban development, focusing on small 
and medium-sized cities in less-developed regions; (b) regional cooperation and integration; and 
(c)  managing  climate  change  and the  environment;  and (iv)  the  ADB  Urban  Operational  Plan, 
2012–2020, which supports green, competitive, and inclusive development.11

IV. 
COSTS AND FINANCING 
14. 
The government has requested a regular loan of $150 million from ADB’s ordinary capital 
resources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 26-year term, including a grace period 
of 5 years, an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB’s London interbank offered 
rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%  per  year  (the  interest  and 
other  charges  during  construction  to  be  capitalized  in  the  loan);  and  such  other  terms  and 
conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. Based on the straight-line method, 
the average maturity is 15.75 years and the maturity premium payable to ADB is 0.10% per year. 
ADB’s Controller’s Department will provide the final confirmation and issue the loan repayment 
schedule at loan negotiations. 
The ADB loan will finance 58.73% of the project cost, including works and engineering 
15. 
installation,  equipment  and  its  installation,  technical  and  vocational  education  and  training 
program, and capacity building and training and project management. The borrower of the loan 
is the PRC Government and will make the loan available, through the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous 
Region Government (XUARG), to Changji Hui Autonomous Prefecture Government (CHAPG) on 
the  same  terms  and  conditions  as  those  of  the  ADB  loan.  XUARG  will  assume  the  foreign 
exchange  and  interest  variation  risks  of  the  ADB  loan.  The  PRC,  XUARG,  and  CHAPG  have 
assured  ADB  that  counterpart  funding  will  be  provided  in  a  timely  manner,  and  any  additional 
counterpart  funding  required  for  any  shortfall  of  funds  or  cost  overruns  will  be  provided.  The 
Xinjiang  Uygur  Autonomous  Region  Finance  Department  (XUARFD)  will  open  an  imprest 
account, and CHAPG, Fukang City Government, Hutubi County Government, and Qitai County 
Government finance bureaus each will open their own dedicated project accounts in a commercial 
bank of their choosing. These accounts will be  used for local project funds. ADB funds will be 
retained by the XUARG for payment to contractors.

Preparation.  The  cost  estimates  were  prepared  based  on  the  feasibility  study  in 
accordance with ADB’s Guidelines on Preparing and Presenting Cost Estimates for Projects and 
Programs Financed by ADB.15 
17. 
Revisions.  The  cost  estimates  may  be  updated  prior  to  approval  and  during  the 
implementation  of the  project  particularly  in the procurement  plan  to  reflect the  actual  contract 
prices, contract variations, and updated cost estimates. 
B.

FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT 
A. 
Financial Management Assessment 
The  financial  management  assessment  was  conducted  in  accordance  with  Asian 
19. 
Development Bank (ADB)’s Guidelines for the Financial Management and Analysis of Projects 
(2005), Financial Due Diligence: a Methodology Note, and Technical Guidance Note: Financial 
Management  Assessment. 16  According  to  the  implementation  arrangement,  Xinjiang  Uygur 
Autonomous Region (Xinjiang) Government is the executing agency with the overall responsibility 
of planning and implementation of the project and its PMO is set in Xinjiang Housing and Urban–
Rural  Construction  Department.  There  are  three  implementing  agencies,  which  PMOs  are 
established in (i) Fukang City Housing and Urban-Rural Construction Bureau, (ii) Hutubi County 
Housing and Urban–Rural Construction Bureau, and (iii) Qitai County Housing and Urban–Rural 
Construction  Bureau  to  implement  the  seven  project  components.  The  assessment  covered 
funds-flow  arrangements,  staffing,  accounting  and  financial  reporting  systems,  internal  and 
external auditing arrangements, and financial information systems. The instrument used for the 
financial  management  assessment  questionnaire  with 
is  ADB’s  standard 
assessment 
consideration of the country partnership strategy. 
20. 
The  assessment  identified  the  main  financial  management  risks  as:  (i)  implementation 
risk—lack of familiarity with ADB disbursement procedures and requirements, which could delay 
project implementation; (ii) compliance risk—lack of familiarity with ADB financial management 
requirements,  particularly  on  accounting,  reporting,  and  auditing,  which  may  delay  project 
reporting and derail identification of issues on the use of loan proceeds; and (iii) financing risk—
funding,  which  could  delay  project 
delays 
implementation. Without continued national government subsidies, the poor financial condition of 
FCG, HCG, and QCG may affect the ability to pay the loan debt service after completion of the 
project. The overall financial management risk rating of the project before considering mitigating 
measures is moderate. The identified financial management risks will be closely monitored during 
project implementation. The financial management action plan is as follows:

B. 
Disbursement 
21. 
The  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  Loan  Disbursement 
Handbook  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time),17 and  detailed  arrangements  agreed  upon 
between the government and ADB. Online training for project staff on disbursement policies and 
procedures  is  available  at:  http://wpqr4.adb.org/disbursement_elearning.  Project  staff  are 
encouraged to avail of this training to help ensure efficient disbursement and fiduciary control. 
The  project  will  use  the  combination  of  direct  payment  by  ADB,  reimbursement,  and 
22. 
imprest fund procedures for disbursements of the loan. Responsibilities for different disbursement 
activities  can  be  summarized  as  follows:  (i)  the  Changji  PMO  will  prepare  project-level 
disbursement projections based on individual projections prepared by each implementing agency; 
(ii)  CHAPG  will  be  responsible  for  arranging  counterpart  financing  or  requesting  budgetary 
allocations  for  counterpart  funding,  as  appropriate;  (iii)  Fukang,  Hutubi,  and  Qitai  PMOs  will 
prepare  reimbursement  claims  and  supporting  documents,  which  will  then  be  forwarded  to 
Changji  PMO  for  review  and  endorsement  before  onward  transmission  to  XUARG;  and  (iv) 
XUARG is responsible for making payments from the imprest account (see next paragraph) and 
is  also  responsible  for  sending  loan  withdrawal  applications  to  ADB  to  initiate  either  imprest 
account replenishment or where appropriate, to request direct payments by ADB to consultants 
or suppliers. 
23. 
Imprest fund procedure. To facilitate project implementation through timely release of 
loan proceeds, Xinjiang Finance Department will establish an imprest account promptly after loan 
effectiveness at a commercial bank. The imprest account is to be used exclusively for the ADB’s 
share of eligible expenditures. The currency of the imprest account will be the US dollar. Xinjiang 
Finance  Department,  who  established  the  imprest  account  in  its  name,  is  accountable  and 
responsible for proper use of advances to the imprest account. The total outstanding advance to 
the imprest account should not exceed the estimate of ADB’s share of expenditures to be paid 
through the imprest account for the forthcoming 6 months. Xinjiang PMO may request for initial 
and  additional  advances  to  the  imprest  account  based  on  an  estimate  of  expenditure  sheet18 
setting out the estimated expenditures to be financed through the account for the forthcoming 6 
months.  Supporting  documents  should  be  submitted  to  ADB  or  retained  by  Xinjiang  PMO  in 
accordance  with  ADB’s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time) 
when liquidating and replenishing the imprest account. 
Statement of expenditure procedure. The statement of expenditure (SOE) procedure19 
24. 
may be used for reimbursement of eligible expenditures or liquidation of advances to the imprest 
account. The ceiling of the SOE procedure is the equivalent of $200,000 per individual payment. 
Supporting  documents  and  records  for  the  expenditures  claimed  under  SOE  should  be 
maintained and made readily available for review by ADB's disbursement and review missions, 
upon  ADB's  request  for  submission  of  supporting  documents  on  a  sampling  basis,  and  for 
independent audit. Reimbursement and liquidation of individual payments in excess of the SOE 
ceiling should be supported by full documentation when submitting the withdrawal application to 
ADB. 
17 The handbook is available electronically from the ADB website (https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/institutional-
document/33606/adb-loan-disbursement-handbook-2017.pdf)   
18 Estimate  of  Expenditure  sheet  is  available  in  Appendix  8A  of  ADB’s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2017,  as 
amended from time to time). 
19 SOE forms are available in Appendix 7B and 7D of ADB’s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from 
time to time). 
25 
Before the submission of the first withdrawal application, the Xinjiang PMO, on behalf of 
25. 
XUARG, should submit to ADB sufficient evidence of the authority of the person(s) who will sign 
the withdrawal applications on behalf of the borrower, together with the authenticated specimen 
signatures of each authorized person. The minimum value per withdrawal application is stipulated 
in the Loan Disbursement Handbook. Individual payments below such amount should be paid (i) 
by  the  XUARG  and  subsequently  claimed  to  ADB  through  reimbursement;  or  (ii)  through  the 
imprest fund procedure, unless otherwise accepted by ADB. 
For the counterpart funds, the implementing agencies will allocate the designated funding 
26. 
for the project as indicated in the project agreement. Counterpart funds from the government will 
be  disbursed  and  liquidated  by  the  PIUs  to  contractors,  suppliers,  and  service  providers.  The 
disbursement  procedures  follow  this  process:  (i)  a  project  implementing  agreement  will  be 
mutually signed between each PIU and the respective city or county government; (ii) the project 
implementing agreement will become effective; (iii) according to the progress of the contract, PIUs 
will submit disbursement request to the project management office of the respective city or county 
governments; and (iv) once approved, counterpart funds will be disbursed from the finance bureau 
of the respective city or county governments. 
C. 
Accounting 
Each implementing agency will prepare its own project accounts covering its respective 
27. 
components  of  the  project  that  it  implements  and  submit  them  to  the  Changji  PMO  after 
verification  by  the  concerned  local  finance  bureau.  Project  accounts  will  follow  the  prescribed 
government’s accounting laws and regulations. The Changji PMO will verify and consolidate the 
accounts of all the implementing agencies, and incorporate the expenses incurred by Changji and 
Xinjiang’s  PMOs for  the operation  of the  project.  An assurance  allowing  an  auditor  of  Xinjiang 
PMO  to  perform  an  audit  when  all  supporting  documents  are  likely  to  be  available  with  the 
implementing  agencies  will  be  included  in  the  Project  Agreement.  The  XUARG  will  maintain 
separate books and records by funding source for all expenditures incurred on the project. The 
XUARG  will  prepare  consolidated  project  financial  statements  in  accordance  with  the 
government's  accounting  laws  and  regulations,  and  financial  reporting  standards,  which  are 
consistent with international accounting principles and practices and are acceptable to ADB. 
D. 
Auditing and Public Disclosure 
XUARG will cause the detailed consolidated project financial statements20 to be audited 
28. 
in  accordance  with  International  Standards  on  Auditing  and  with  the  Government’s  national 
auditing  standards,  by  an  independent  auditor  acceptable  to  ADB. 21 XUARG  will  submit  the 
audited project financial statements in the English language to ADB within 6 months from the end 
of the fiscal year. 
29. 
The annual audit report for the project accounts will include an audit management letter 
and  auditor’s  opinions  which  cover  (i)  whether  the  project  financial  statements  present  an 
accurate  and  fair  view  or  are  presented  fairly,  in  all  material  respects,  in  accordance  with  the 
applicable  financial  reporting  standards;  (ii)  whether  loan  proceeds  were  used  only  for  the 
purposes  of  the  project  or  not;  and  (iii)  whether  the  financial  covenants  contained  in  the  legal 
agreements for the project was in compliance with the financial covenants contained in the legal 
agreements (where applicable). 
20 The consolidated project financial statements will be prepared using an accrual basis.

Compliance with financial reporting and auditing requirements will be monitored by ADB 
30. 
review  missions  and  during  normal  program  supervision,  and  followed  up  regularly  with  all 
concerned, including the external auditor. 
31. 
The XUARG and the implementing agencies have been made aware of ADB’s approach 
to delayed submission, and the requirements for satisfactory and acceptable quality of the audited 
project  financial  statements.22 ADB  reserves  the  right  to  require  a  change  in  the  auditor  (in  a 
manner consistent with the constitution of the borrower), or for additional support to be provided 
to the auditor, if the audits required are not conducted in a manner satisfactory to ADB, or if the 
audits are substantially delayed. ADB reserves the right to verify the project's financial accounts 
to  confirm  that  the  share  of  ADB’s  financing  is  used  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  policies  and 
procedures. 
32. 
Public disclosure of the audited project financial statements, including the auditor’s opinion 
on the audited project financial statements, will be guided by ADB’s Public Communications Policy 
2011.23 After the review, ADB will disclose the audited project financial statements for the project 
and the opinion of the auditors on the project financial statements no later than 14 calendar days 
of ADB’s confirmation of their acceptability by posting them on ADB’s website. The management 
letter, additional auditor’s opinions, and audited entity financial statements will not be disclosed.24 
22 ADB’s approach and procedures regarding delayed submission of audited project financial statements: 
(i)  When audited project financial statements are not received by the due date, ADB will write to the executing 
agency advising that (a) the audit documents are overdue; and (b) if they are not received within the next 6 
months, requests for new contract awards and disbursement such as new replenishment of imprest accounts, 
processing of new reimbursement, and issuance of new commitment letters will not be processed. 
(ii)  When  audited  project  financial  statements  are  not  received  within  6  months  after  the  due  date,  ADB  will 
withhold processing of requests for new contract awards and disbursement such as new replenishment of 
imprest accounts, processing of new reimbursement and issuance of new commitment letters. ADB will (a) 
inform the executing agency of ADB’s actions; and (b) advise that the loan may be suspended if the audit 
documents are not received within the next 6 months. 
(iii)  When audited project financial statements  are not received within 12 months after the due date, ADB may 
suspend the loan.

VI. 
PROCUREMENT AND CONSULTING SERVICES 
33. 
A project procurement risk assessment was conducted for the project, in accordance with 
ADB’s  Guide  on  Assessing  Procurement  Risks  and  Determining  Project  Procurement 
Classification.25 The overall project procurement risk is moderate. 
34. 
The  only  weakness  identified  is  that  though  the  XPMO  has  sufficient  experience  in 
managing  ADB-financed  projects,  the  local  city  or  county  level  PMOs  do  not  have  sufficient 
knowledge and experience in procurement for ADB-financed projects. 
35. 
These risks are being and will be mitigated as (i) the PMO has committed to fulfill ADB’s 
requirements  for  all  procurements  and  consultant  recruitments  for  the  project,  (ii)  ADB, 
procurement consultants, and a procurement agency conducted, are conducting, and will conduct 
capacity development, and (iii) procurement consultants and a procurement agency will provide 
support for procurement and consultant requirements. 
The  XPMO  and  CPMO  have  confirmed  that  during  project  implementation,  XPMO  will 
36. 
manage all the procurement activities with support from project implementation units (PIUs) under 
the  implementing  agencies.  A  procurement  capacity  assessment  (PCA),  therefore,  has  been 
conducted  to  assess  the  capacity  of  the  XPMO  and  the  PIUs  to  procure  goods,  works,  and 
consulting  services  under  the  project.  The  standard  procurement  capacity  questionnaire  was 
delivered. A project procurement risk assessment was conducted based on the review of regional 
procurement  practices  and  the  feedback  from  the  questionnaire  survey.  The  risk  category  is 
proposed to be moderate and the project procurement classification is Category B. 
37. 
The communications with the XPMO revealed that the XPMO has extensive procurement 
experience  with  ADB-funded  projects,  as  it  has  managed  several  previous  ADB  projects  in 
Xinjiang.  However,  the  implementing  agencies  and  PIUs  both  have  very  limited  ADB  project 
experience. Such risk can be effectively mitigated through a series of measures, such as (i) hiring 
of a qualified and experienced tendering agent to assist in the procurement activities, i.e., bidding 
documents  preparation,  advertisement,  bid  tendering,  etc.;  (ii)  early  engagement  of  a  start-up 
consultant  and  project  implementation  consultants  at  initial  stage  of  project  implementation  or 
before the tendering agent is mobilized; and (iii) provision of extensive training and support on 
ADB procurement policies and procedures. 
A. 
Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing 
38. 
All  advance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  will  be  undertaken  in  conformity  with 
ADB’s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time),26 and ADB’s Guidelines 
on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time).27 The issuance of invitations for 
bid  under  advance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  will  be  subject  to  ADB  approval.  The 
borrower, XUARG, and the implementing agencies have been advised that approval of advance 
contracting and retroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance the project. 
Advance contracting. Advance contracting applies to the consulting services contract for

County, windbreak shelterbelts near North Ring Road for Fukang City. Advance contracting will 
be undertaken with the following conditions: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
ADB  has  reviewed  and  cleared  the  resettlement  plan  and  the  environment 
management plan (EMP); 
In case land acquisition and resettlement activities commence ahead of approval 
of  the  resettlement  plan,  a  resettlement  due  diligence  report  (by  an  external 
monitor, confirming that the resettlement plan implementation is in accordance with 
the  resettlement  plan  and ADB  policies  and  procedures)  should  be  prepared  in 
addition to the resettlement plan itself; and 
All  conditions  precedent  to  contract  award,  such  as  approval  of  the  finalized 
resettlement  plan  (and  due  diligence  report)  reflecting  detailed  measurement 
survey  and  approval  of  project  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA),  are 
satisfied. 
40. 
Retroactive financing. XUARG was advised that retroactive financing may only apply up 
to the equivalent of 20% of the total ADB loan, to cover eligible expenditures incurred for works, 
goods, and consulting services procured through advance contracting before loan effectiveness, 
but not earlier than 12 months before the signing of the loan agreement. Retroactive financing 
applies to the consulting services contracts for the initial project implementation support. 
B. 
Procurement of Goods, Works, and Consulting Services 
41. 
All  procurement  of  goods  and  works  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB’s 
Procurement  Guidelines  and  the  Procurement  Reform–10  Point  Action  Plan  and  associated 
reforms. The relevant sections of ADB’s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) will be 
included in procurement documents and contracts. Before the start of any procurement ADB and 
the government will review the public procurement laws of the central and autonomous regional 
governments to ensure consistency with ADB’s Procurement Guidelines. 
1. 
International Competitive Bidding Method 
42. 
International  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  method  will  be  used  for  civil  works  contracts 
estimated to cost $40 million and above, while national competitive bidding (NCB) method will be 
used for civil works contracts estimated to cost less than $40 million in accordance with the PRC’s 
Tendering  and  Bidding  Law  (1999),  subject  to  modifications  agreed  upon  with  ADB  and 
incorporated in the NCB annex of the procurement plan. Major contracts for goods valued at   $3 
million and above will be procured through ADB’s ICB method, while smaller packages for goods 
valued at less than $3 million will be procured following NCB method. The shopping procurement 
method will be allowed for contracts valued at below $100,000 for civil works and below $100,000 
for goods. 
43. 
Unless otherwise specified, the  procurement  under ICB  procedures will  use  the  single-
stage  one-envelope  procedure.  Procurement  shall  use  the  latest  ADB  standard  bidding 
documents, which can be downloaded from the ADB website. 
44. 
For all contracts procured under ICB, prior review of the following documents is required: 
application for consulting services recruitment notice (CSRN), invitations for bids, invitations for 
prequalification, draft prequalification documents, draft bidding documents, and prequalification. 
Bid evaluation reports will be submitted to ADB for prior review and no objection. Use of ICB is 
subject to ADB’s Procurement Guidelines. 
29 
2. 
National Competitive Bidding Method 
45. 
NCB will be used for civil works contracts estimated to cost over $100,000 to below    $40 
million and for goods contracts from over $100,000 to below $3 million. Chinese Yuan (CNY) may 
be used for the purpose of bidding and payment. NCB contracts with estimated cost of $500,000 
or more for goods and $1 million or more for works may be advertised in Business Opportunities 
of ADB’s website. 
The first draft English language of the procurement documents (bidding documents and 
46. 
draft contract) should be submitted for ADB approval regardless of the estimated contract amount. 
The first NCB civil works contract and those higher than $10 million as well as the first NCB goods 
contract and those higher than $1 million are subject to prior review. 
47. 
Procurement for goods and works contracts with value of $10 million and below and goods 
contracts  with  value  of  $1  million  and  below  are  subject  to  post  review.  Documents  must  be 
recorded and submitted for post review no later than 1 month after they are awarded. 
48. 
For  procurement  under  NCB,  the  following  provisions  should  be  applied:  (i)  the 
advertisement may be limited to the national press, an official gazette or an open access website; 
(ii) bidding shall follow the standard bidding documents recently updated by Ministry of Finance 
(MOF)  in  2015  and  approved  by  ADB;  (iii)  bidding  documents  may  be  only  in  the  Chinese 
language. Procurement under NCB will be subject to the provisions of the NCB annex. 
49. 
For contracts under NCB and Shopping procedures (other than the first NCB civil works 
and goods contract discussed above, and the first shopping contract), post review modality will 
apply whereby, procurement documents are submitted for review while procurement can proceed 
without waiting for the outcome of ADB’s review. ADB-approved master bidding documents will 
be used as model for all subsequent NCB procurement financed by ADB for the project, and need 
not be subject to further review. 
3. 
Shopping 
The shopping procurement method will be allowed for contracts valued at $100,000 and 
50. 
below for civil works and goods, respectively. 
51. 
An 18-month procurement plan indicating threshold and review procedures, goods, works, 
and consulting service contract packages and national competitive bidding guidelines is in Section 
C. 
4. 
Consulting Services 
52. 
All  consultants  will  be  recruited  according  to  ADB’s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of 
Consultants.28 The terms of reference for all consulting services are detailed in Section D. Under 
the  ADB  loan,  an  estimated  total  of  201  person-months  (22  international  and  179  national)  of 
consulting services are required for (i) project management and institutional strengthening support 
(CS1); (ii) initial project implementation support (CS2); (iii) planning capacity development (CS3); 
(iv) TVET course development support (CS4); and (v) 3R Pilot Program (CS5). Consulting firms 
will  be  engaged  using  the  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  (QCBS)  method  with  a  standard 
28 Checklists for actions required to contract consultants by method available in e-Handbook on Project Implementation 
at: http://www.adb.org/documents/handbooks/project-implementation/ 
30 
quality-cost ratio of 90:10 using full technical proposal procedure for CS1 and simplified technical 
proposal procedure for CS3; consultants’ qualifications selection (CQS) method for CS4 and CS5; 
and individual consultant selection (ICS) method for CS2. 
Three  other  consulting  service  contracts  for  external  environmental  monitoring, 
53. 
resettlement  and  social  monitoring  and  project  performance  monitoring  will  utilize  domestic 
counterpart funding. 
C. 
Procurement Plan 
54. 
A  procurement  plan  indicating  procurement  or  selection  methods,  estimated  costs  of 
contracts, thresholds, and review procedures for goods, works, and consulting service contract 
packages has been prepared and summarized below. The procurement plan shall be executed 
in the manner in which ADB has approved it. The procurement plan shall be updated annually or 
as  needed  throughout  the  duration  of  the  project.  The  contract  packages  are  categorized  into 
three categories including goods, works, and consulting services. The works contracts are mainly 
in the areas of water supply, solid waste management, road etc., which are common in the PRC 
and in XUAR. Some of the equipment and materials are included in the works contracts to reduce 
contract  interfaces  and  minimize  the  contract  management  risks,  based  on  the  nature  of  the 
equipment and materials and their interaction with relevant works. Other equipment and materials 
that are independent of the civil  works are listed as goods contracts. The technical assistance 
and studies designed to strengthen the capacity of the PMO and implementing agencies during 
implementation and O&M of the project are packaged into consulting service contracts.

discuss the SWOT analysis, seek input on the conceptual design alternatives, 
and refine the design concepts into one preferred alternative that reflects local 
preferences towards improving urban conditions in the study area. 
  Prepare a concept design plan and implementation strategy for the study area 
including a master plan, sketches/design simulations to represent the design 
intentions,  preliminary  costs  to  undertake  necessary  public  investments  to 
increase urban densities, recommendations about development controls [floor 
area ratio (F.A.R.) and site coverages], and an implementation process with 
consideration on minimizing social impacts due to the proposed changes.

VII. 
SAFEGUARDS 
152.  Environmental safeguards categorization due diligence. The project is classified as 
category B for environment. An initial environmental examination (IEE) including environmental 
management plan (EMP) was prepared in compliance with ADB’s  Safeguard Policy Statement 
(SPS, 2009) and disclosed on the ADB website in March 2017.29 The IEE incorporates findings 
of the domestic feasibility studies, domestic environmental impact assessments (DEIAs), and the 
climate  risk  and  vulnerability  assessment  (CRVA)  and  Technical  Reports  conducted  in  the 
framework of the PPTA. The domestic safeguards documents were prepared in compliance with 
the  PRC  Law  on  Environmental  Impact  Assessment  (2003),  the  Technical  Guidelines  for 
Environmental  Impact  Assessment  (HJ/T2-93)  and  other  relevant  PRC  regulations  and 
guidelines. The Changji Environmental Protection Bureau has approved all domestic EIAs. The 
project IEE and EMP (not the DEIAs) form the basis of the official loan agreement between ADB 
and the executing agency. The executing agency, through the PMO, has final responsibility for 
implementation and compliance with the IEE and EMP. 
153.  Anticipated impacts and mitigation measures during construction. The IEE identifies 
potential  impacts  during  construction.  Construction  will  cause  no  loss  of  valuable  ecology  or 
physical cultural resources. Construction dust, noise, erosion, and local disruption to traffic and 
communities will be temporary and can be appropriately managed. Avoidance of impact through 
design and site management and mitigation measures through construction management have 
been  identified  for  each  impact  and  these  are  listed  in  the  project  EMP  for  the  attention  of 
contractors and PMO. In all cases, where the EMP requirements are strictly followed, construction 
impacts will be kept at acceptable levels. 
154.  Anticipated  impacts  and  mitigation  measures  during  operation.  In  operation,  the 
traffic volumes projected for project roads will not result in air pollution exceeding standards, but 
for  some  identified  locations  predicted  future  or  noise  levels  will  exceed  both  PRC  and  EHS 
standards.  Mitigation  measures  are  identified  in  the  IEE,  and  required  by  the  EMP,  for 
exceedances under and over 3 decibels. The sustainable use of water for irrigation of shelterbelts 
and windbreaks (Fukang City) has been checked against water availability. Safeguards against 
soil and groundwater contamination at the Qitai County landfill include partitioning to limit leachate 
production and a leachate treatment plant. The isolation of the landfill location will help minimize 
other  operational  impacts  of  noise,  dust,  and  odor  on  the  community.  The  proper  closure  and 
rehabilitation of the current landfill site in Qitai County will be an integral part of this development. 
155.  The rapid environmental assessment for the project, carried out during project planning 
by ADB, assigned the project a medium climate risk categorization. A climate risk and vulnerability 
assessment (CRVA) was prepared as a response to this risk. A list of design and engineering 
strategies  that  address  the  vulnerabilities  identified  in  the  CRVA  has  been  incorporated  into 
component designs. Indicative quantifications in these recommendations are taken from the sub-
regional projections for precipitation and temperatures. 
156.  Environmental  management  plan  (EMP) 
implementation  arrangements.  The 
responsibilities  for  environmental  management  and  supervision  during  the  various  stages  of 
implementation of the project are defined in the EMP. The EMP will be implemented in all phases 
of the project—design, pre-construction, construction, and operation. The EMP complies with the 
29 ADB. 2009. Safeguard Policy Statement. Manila. 
76 
PRC’s environmental laws and ADB’s SPS (2009). The EMP contains (i) objectives; (ii) roles and 
responsibilities; (iii) mitigation measures; (iv) inspection, monitoring, and reporting arrangements; 
(v)  training  and  institutional  strengthening;  (vi)  grievance  redress  mechanism  (GRM);  and  (vii) 
future public consultation. The EMP is included in this PAM as Appendix 1 and will be updated 
at the end of the detailed design. The EMP will also be included as a separate annex in all bidding 
and contract documents. The contractors will be made aware (through the PMO and the tendering 
agency) of their obligations to implement the EMP and to budget EMP implementation costs in 
their  proposals.  XUARG  (through the  PMO)  and  the  three  implementing agencies  will  assume 
overall responsibility for implementing, supervising, monitoring, and reporting on the EMP. Their 
capacity to implement the EMP, as well as the capacity of the operation and maintenance unit to 
manage  project  facilities,  will  be  strengthened  through  capacity  building  and  training  activities 
defined under project output 4 (capacity building) and the training plan in the EMP. The PMO and 
the  implementing  agencies  will  assign  qualified  staff  to  coordinate  and  monitor  EMP 
implementation. Environment management and sector specialists contracted by the PMO as part 
of the loan implementation consultant team will support these. 
157.  Project management office, environment specialist. The Changji PMO will have the 
overall  responsibility  delegated  by  the  EA  for  supervising  the  implementation  of  mitigation 
measures, coordinating the project level Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM) and reporting to 
ADB.  The  CPMO  will  appoint  an  environment  officer  (PMO-EO)  to  supervise  the  effective 
implementation of the EMP and to coordinate the GRM. Terms of reference for the PMO-EO are 
at Annex A. 
158.  To ensure that the contractors comply with the EMP provisions, the PMO-EO with the help 
and technical support of the Loan Implementation Environment Consultant (LIEC), will prepare 
and provide the following specification clauses for incorporation into the bidding procedures: (i) a 
list of environmental management and monitoring requirements to be budgeted by the bidders in 
their  proposals;  (ii)  environmental  clauses for  contractual  terms  and  conditions;  and  (iii)  in the 
EMP. In addition, the PMO-EO will assist in preparing the environmental sections for the project 
progress reports. 
159. 
Implementing  agencies.  Each  IA  with  civil  works  will  assign  one  environmental 
supervisor  from  the  implementing  agency  (IA-ES)  to  (i)  review  and  approve  contractors’  site 
management  plans;  (ii)  supervise  the  environmental  performance  of  the  component  PIUs;  (iii) 
participate in internal monitoring; (iv) act as a local entry point for the project grievance redress 
mechanism (GRM); and (v) submit quarterly inspection results to the contractors for information, 
and  to  the  implementing  agency  and  the  PMO  for  verification  and  confirmation.  Terms  of 
reference for the IA-ES positions are at Annex C. The IAs will also hire construction supervision 
companies (CSCs), which will support the IAs in supervising construction works. 
160.  Construction contractors will be responsible for implementing the mitigation measures 
during construction under supervision of the implementing agencies and the County and/or City 
PMOs. In their bids, contractors will be required to respond to the environmental management 
requirements defined in the EMP. Each contractor will be required to develop Site Management 
Plans and will assign a person responsible for environment, health and safety. The contractors, 
in collaboration with the IA-ESs, will undertake internal monitoring.

EMP and environmental monitoring program, as needed; (ii) supervise the implementation of the 
mitigation  measures  specified  in the  EMP;  (iii)  train  the  PMOs  and  IAs  on  how  to  prepare  the 
annual EMP monitoring and progress reports to ADB during the early stages of training, and lead 
the preparation of these documents; (iv) provide training to the CSCs, IAs, and PMOs, on PRC’s 
environmental laws, regulations, and policies, ADB’s SPS (2009), EMP implementation, and GRM 
in accordance with the training plan; (v) identify any environment related implementation issues, 
and propose necessary corrective actions; and (vi) undertake site visits for EMP inspection as 
required. 
162.  External  monitor.  An  External  Monitor  will  be  contracted  by  the  PMO  to  review  and 
evaluate the results of the contractors’ and operators’ internal monitoring and the results of the 
EMS monitoring against PRC standards. The External Monitor will report to the ADB separately 
from the PMO’s Environmental Monitoring Reports. 
163.  Contractor environmental specifications will be included in all civil works contracts. The 
contractor  environmental  specifications  (see  Appendix  2  to  EMP)  are  standard  environmental 
clauses  and  sub-clauses  that  are  applicable  to  all  general  infrastructure  construction.  The 
objective of these clauses is to reduce and manage all potential environmental impacts caused 
by the construction activities. These specifications will be included into the standard contractor 
specifications included in the contract between the implementing agency and the contractor. 
164.  Grievance redress mechanism. A project-specific GRM has been established to receive 
and manage any public environmental and/or social issues that may arise due to the project. The 
environment specialists in the PMO and implementing agency will coordinate the GRM. All project 
agencies and staff will be trained in the GRM and will take an active role in supporting the GRM 
when necessary. 
Land Acquisition and Resettlement 
165.  The  involuntary  resettlement  categorization  of  the  project  is  Category  A.  The  project 
covers Hutubi County, Fukang City, and Qitai County; and a Resettlement Plan for each county 
and/or  city  was  prepared  based  on  the  feasibility  study  report.  An  estimated  590  households 
(2,529 people) will be affected by land acquisition and house demolition, 21 house renters; and 
one enterprise with six (6) workers. The ethnic minority groups affected (Uygur, Hui, and Kazak) 
account  for  62%  (304  households  with  1,557  people)  of  the  total  affected  population.  About 
10,193  mu  (680  hectares  equivalent)  of  land,  mostly  (93%)  collective  cultivated  land,  will  be 
permanently acquired. About 199 house owners and 21 house renters will be required to relocate. 
The  cost  estimate  for  resettlement  for  all  the  sub-components  is  CNY316.01  million  ($45.80 
million equivalent). 
166.  The  Government  shall  ensure  that  (i)  the  Resettlement  Plans  agreed  between  the 
Government and ADB are updated based on preliminary design and submitted to ADB for review 
and  concurrence  prior  to  land  acquisition  and  house  demolition  activities  and  implemented  in 
accordance  with  applicable  Government  laws  and  regulations  and  ADB’s  Safeguard  Policy 
Statement; in case of any inconsistency between Government laws and ADB’s policy, the latter 
shall prevail; (ii) all affected persons are given adequate opportunity to participate in resettlement 
planning,  updating,  and  implementation;  (iii)  counterpart  funds  for  land  acquisition  and 
resettlement  activities  are  provided  according  to  the  budget  and  project  schedule;  (iv)  any 
additional costs in excess of the resettlement plan budget estimates are met within the project 
schedule; (v) all PMOs shall designate adequate staff and resources to supervise and monitor 
78 
updating  and  implementation  of  the  Resettlement  Plans  and  submit  semi-annual  internal 
monitoring reports to ADB; (vii) a functional and effective grievance mechanism is established; 
and (viii) the Government engages an external monitor acceptable to ADB to monitor progress 
and evaluate results of implementation of the updated resettlement plans and submit semi-annual 
external monitoring reports simultaneously to the PMOs and ADB. The XUARG shall not award 
any Works contract which involves involuntary resettlement impacts until XUARG has prepared 
and submitted to ADB the updated resettlement plans based on the project's preliminary design, 
and obtained ADB's clearance of such resettlement plans. 
167.  The PMOs shall not hand over a specific section of a contract to the civil works contractor 
until:  (i)  payment  of  compensation  has  been  fully  disbursed  to  the  affected  people  and 
rehabilitation measures are in place for that specific section as per the updated resettlement plan; 
(ii) affected people who were compensated for that specific section have vacated the site; and (iii) 
the specific section of the project is free from any encumbrances. 
Ethnic Minority Development Plan 
168.  The  project  is  classified  category  B  for  ADB’s  indigenous  peoples  safeguard.  In  2015, 
Changji  had  ethnic  minority  population  of  about  437,800  accounting  for  27.4%  of  the  total 
residents,  among  which  are  Hui  (8.8%),  Kazakh  (10.7%),  and  Uygur  (5.8%). Within  the  direct 
project  areas,  ethnic  minorities  comprise  over  27%  of  the  population.  Although  the  urban 
communities  are  ethnically  mixed,  some  aspects,  such  as  cultural,  religious,  and  linguistic 
differences,  are  maintained.  Ethnic  minorities  will  not  be  adversely  affected,  except  for  1,557 
persons who belong to ethnic minority groups affected by land acquisition. All households in the 
urban areas will benefit from the new and upgraded infrastructure services in roads, water and 
wastewater, heating, and solid waste management. 
169.  An ethnic minority development plan (EMDP) has been prepared to facilitate the inclusion 
of ethnic minority people in all project activities.30 The EMDP also includes measures to ensure 
that their  customs  and  beliefs  will  be  respected  throughout  project  construction and  operation. 
Key issues addressed in the EMDP ensure (i) that affected ethnic minority people are effectively 
involved  in  planning,  implementation,  and  monitoring  of  the  project;  (ii)  that  impacts  and  risks 
potentially affecting ethnic minority people are mitigated; and (iii) that ethnic minority people will 
benefit  in  an  inclusive  and  culturally  appropriate  manner.  The  EMDP  includes  measures  to 
mitigate  potential  social  risks  and  to  enhance  project  benefits,  particularly  for  women  and  the 
poor. The project will support (i) the targets set for the contractors with respect to the employment 
of ethnic minorities (10% skilled and unskilled jobs), including females; (ii) measures to facilitate 
the  effective  inclusion  of  ethnic  minorities  (25%)  in  project  activities  through  the  public 
participation and awareness, by removing potential cultural barriers to such participation; and (iii) 
measures to reduce the risk of unintentional offence being caused to ethnic minority communities 
during project construction and operation. Implementation and monitoring of the EMDP is included 
in the loan assurances. 
170.  The actions to be implemented under the EMDP are for the most part to be included as 
part  of  the  project’s  administrative  budget.  Where  local  government  agencies  collaborate  with 
actions in the EMDP, the local government administrative budgets will cover the costs of local 
government  staffing  and  other  related  costs.  Each  PIU  will  nominate  at  least  one  person 
responsible for overseeing the implementation of the EMDP  and SGAP, and to coordinate the 
social monitoring. The ethnic and religious affairs office in each county/city will provide support 
30 A summary of the Ethnic Minority Development Plan is accessible from the list of linked documents. 
79 
as necessary, as well as the community offices, the county/city centers for disease control, and 
the labor bureaus. 
171.  Prior  to  the  commencement  of  any  component,  the  CPMO  and  the  3  PMOs  (in  the  3 
counties/city) will ensure that briefings on ADB’s policies with respect to ethnic minorities, and on 
the EMDP, are provided both for their own members and the PIUs. The ethnic and religious affairs 
offices  will  assist  in  these  briefings.  Contractors,  their  supervisors,  and  workers  will  also  be 
required to undergo briefings on local ethnic minority customs and beliefs, and to ensure that no 
offense  to  ethnic  minority  beliefs  or  customs  occurs  during  construction.  The  national  social, 
gender  and  ethnic  minority  development  specialist  in  the  project  implementation  consulting 
services will support the EMDP and SGAP implementation and monitoring. The EMDP endorsed 
by  the  government  has  been  disclosed  to  ethnic  minority  people  targeted  by  the  project  and 
uploaded on the ADB website. Detailed monitoring and reporting arrangements are included in 
the Section IX.B and the project agreement. 
172.  Prohibited investment activities. Pursuant to ADB’s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), 
ADB  funds  may  not  be  applied  to  the  activities  described  on  the ADB  Prohibited  Investment 
Activities List set forth at Appendix 5 of the Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). 
80 
VIII. 
GENDER AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS 
173.  A  poverty  and  social  assessment  (PSA)  was undertaken  during the  project  preparation 
phase in accordance with ADB guidelines on gender and social dimensions. The PSA included a 
review  of  secondary  data,  a  household  survey,  focus  group  discussions  and  key  informant 
interviews.  The  PSA  assisted  in  the  design  of  the  various  subcomponents  to  ensure  they  are 
socially inclusive and implemented with a high degree of community participation, especially for 
the  local  people  including  women,  ethnic  minorities,  poor  and  other  vulnerable  persons  in  the 
project areas. 
174.  The  project  will  promote  the  sustainable  social  and  environmental  urban  and  rural 
development  of  Changji.  The  project  will  also have capacity  building/trainings  on TVET,  urban 
planning  (with  understanding  of  human  centered  development)  and  project  management; 
awareness  activities  on  public  traffic  safety,  solid  waste  management  including  3R,  ecological 
greening,  HIV/AIDS,  drugs  and  human  trafficking  prevention;  and  generate  temporary  and 
permanent  positions  for  both  skilled  and  unskilled  jobs  during  construction  and  operation, 
particularly for women, ethnic minorities and poor people. Based on the PSA, a SGAP has been 
formulated  and  agreed  by  the  CPMO  and  3  PMOs  (in  3  counties/city),  and  implementing 
agencies. These  actions  will  be  implemented,  progress will  be  monitored,  and achievement  of 
results will be measured and reported semi-annually. The following sections provide some further 
guidance for the implementing agencies. 
A. 
Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy 
175.  Changji had a total population of about 1.6 million with 492,137 households in 2015. The 
ethnic minorities comprise 27.4% of the total population. The major ethnic minority groups are 
Kazakh (10.7%), Hui (8.8%) and Uygur (5.8%). The project area has a total population of 573,819 
and  184,242  households  in  2015.  In  2015,  Changji  had  a  poor  population  of  26,218,  of  which 
15,863 are within the project city and counties.31 The project will contribute to poverty reduction 
by (i) expanding access of urban, rural, and peri-urban residents, including the poor to municipal 
services, (ii) improving public health and living conditions of local population, and (iii) supporting 
direct  and  indirect  employment  opportunities  with  an  enabling  investment  environment  and 
enhanced access to market. 
176.  The  project  has  a  direct  beneficiary  population of  304,159  in the  three  project  city  and 
counties, i.e., an urban population of 134,675 (44.3%) and rural population of 169,484 (55.7%). 
The project has an indirect beneficiary population of 269,660, i.e. an urban population of 131,055 
(48.6%) and a rural population of 138,605 (51.4%). 
177.  The project will generate 202 skilled and 910 unskilled jobs during construction and 64 
skilled  and  95  unskilled  jobs  during  operations.  The  executing  and  implementing  agencies 
provided assurance that the priority for employment will be vulnerable groups such as women, 
the poor and ethnic minorities. 
178.  Design features. The project design directly responds to issues raised by the poverty and 
social  analysis.  Key  design  features  include  (i)  setting  employment  targets  for  women,  ethnic 
minorities, and the poor during project construction and operation stage; (ii) strengthening public 
participation and consultation in decision-making related to project components during the project 
31 PRC, Xinjiang, and Changji (Fukang, Hutubi, and Qitai). 2015. Statistical annual reports; and website of the Ministry 
of Civil Affairs of China. 2015. 
81 
design  stage  and  implementation,  and  public  hearing  on  setting  water  tariff  should  the  local 
government decide to set tariff for improved water supply services; (iii) targeting women, the poor 
and  ethnic  minorities  through  livelihood  skills  training  under  TVET  schools;  and  (iv)  public 
awareness and training on solid waste management, including 3R, distribution of garbage bins 
etc.  The  EMDP  and  SGAP  outlined  actions  to  ensure  mitigation  of  adverse  impacts  and  for 
beneficiaries  to  maximize  benefits  or  positive  impacts  of  the  project.  In  addition,  it  ensures  (i) 
protection of labor that will be employed on project works by providing training or awareness for 
the contractors/sub-contractors and employees on core labor standards (i.e. equal pay for equal 
work, no child labor, equal job opportunities etc.), and (ii) mitigation of communicable diseases 
including HIV/AIDS and STI, and human trafficking awareness and prevention; (iii)  road safety 
awareness and prevention of road accidents in communities located near the project construction 
sites. The EMDP and SGAP outlined actions to ensure mitigation of adverse impacts and increase 
positive impacts of the project. Implementation and monitoring of the EMDP and SGAP is included 
in the loan assurances. 
B. 
Social and Gender Action Plan 
179.  The SGAP has been prepared for the project.32 The SGAP includes specific targets for 
women in employment during construction and operation, and participation that have been agreed 
by the PMOs and government agencies (i.e. WF, PAO, EMRAO etc.). The following measures 
are  included  in the  SGAP:  (i)  consultations  and  awareness  raising  on  solid  waste  /  sanitation, 
traffic and road safety, disease prevention and human trafficking prevention (at least 50% female); 
(ii)  job  opportunities  during  construction  (25%)  and  operation  stage  (30%);  (iii)  participation  in 
training on solid waste management including 3R in Qitai Secondary Vocational and Technical 
School (50%); (iv) participation in new short-term courses in Fukang Technician College (60%); 
open  education  and  skills  upgrading  (35%);  and  (v)  capacity  building  for  PMOs/implementing 
agencies (30%). Activities and target indicators included in the SGAP will be monitored through 
the  project  performance  management  system  and  project  progress  reports  on  a  semi-annual 
basis, and ADB supervision missions. 
180.  ADB categorizes the project as effective gender mainstreaming (EGM). The project will 
have significant benefits for women to reduce the energy, time, and effort spent by these activities, 
allowing  them  greater  participation  in  income-generating  activities,  family  entertainment,  or 
leisure. Women strongly support the project across all subcomponents, and they perceive that 
the project will improve their quality of life and create employment and income opportunities for 
them. The social, gender, and ethnic minority development specialist (national, 8 person-months) 
will be provided under the capacity development component to ensure effective implementation 
of the SGAP and EMDP. A loan assurance for implementation of the SGAP has been included. 
181.  To address the risk of spread of HIV/AIDS/STI, the project requires (i) inclusion of clauses 
on HIV/AIDS/STI and other communicable disease awareness for the contractors/sub-contractors 
and  employees  into  contract  bidding  documents;  (ii)  conduct  of  public  health  and  HIV/STI 
prevention education to the civil works’ contractors and labor force; (iii) establishment of health 
measures  for  construction  workers  (e.g.  setting  up  a  temporary  infirmary,  using  local  medical 
resources); and (iv) conduct of diverse publicity activities on HIV/AIDS (e.g. brochures, posters 
and leaflets). 
C. 
Other Social Aspects 
32 A SGAP has been prepared for this project and is presented in the PAM and assurances. 
82 
182.  As per the loan assurances, construction workers hired from the local communities will be 
trained  on  sanitation  knowledge  campaigns,  health  and  occupational  safety  measures  while 
working at the construction sites, and capacity building will be undertaken to protect their legal 
labor rights during construction or operations. 
183.  Labor issues. Core labor standards will be complied with based on national laws. Civil 
works  contracts  will  stipulate  priorities  to  (i)  employ  local  people  for  works,  (ii)  ensure  equal 
opportunities for women and men, (iii) pay equal wages for work of equal value, (iv) pay women’s 
wages  directly  to  them,  and  (v)  not  employ  children  or  forced  labor.  Specific  targets  for 
employment have been included in the EMDP and SGAP. CPMO in conjunction with the 3 PMOs 
(in the 3 counties/city) is responsible for coordinating activities and ensure the implementation of 
the SGAP and EMDP. CPMO will monitor contractors’ compliance with these project assurances 
in conjunction with the Human Resources and Social Security Bureau, and Civil Affairs Bureau. 
The CPMO shall assign or appoint 1 social / gender and ethnic minority development staff during 
project implementation to ensure timely and appropriate implementation of the SGAP and EMDP. 
The social development/gender and EM development specialist in the project consulting services 
will assist the coordinator in CPMO and social, gender and ethnic minority development staff (in 
the 3 PMOs). 
184.  Under  the  project management  consulting  services,  social, gender,  and  ethnic  minority 
development  specialist  (consultant)  will  be  engaged  to  support  CPMO  and  the  3  PMOs  to 
implement  the  EMDP,  SGAP  and  other  social  aspects.  They  will  be  monitored  internally  and 
reported to ADB via semi-annual progress reports.

B.  Monitoring 
1. 
Project Performance Monitoring 
185.  At the beginning of the project implementation stage, the Changji PMO will develop a project 
performance  management  system  (PPMS)  to  monitor  the  progress  of  the  project  in  achieving  the 
planned  outcome  and  outputs.  The  project  implementation  management  consultant  will  assist  in 
developing  the  PPMS  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  policy  requirements,  including  baseline  setting, 
operational data collection, data analysis, and reporting. 
186.  The  PPMS  will  adopt  indicators  relating  to  the  following  aspects  of  the  project:  (i)  physical 
progress of subproject implementation, and (ii) financial progress. The PMO will assign staff, or contract 
consultants, to collect baseline and progress data at the requisite time intervals to be used in the PPMS. 
The PMO will be responsible for analyzing and consolidating reported data, and reporting outcomes to 
ADB through semiannual progress reports. 
2. 
Compliance Monitoring 
187.  During project implementation, ADB and the PMO will closely monitor the compliance of all the 
covenants  under  the  project  and  will  take  necessary  remedial  actions  for  any  noncompliance.  The 
compliance status will be reported in the quarterly progress reports by the PMO and will be reviewed 
during project review missions. 
3. 
Legal Covenants 
188.  XUARG shall ensure that in the event of (i) any change in ownership or control of the project 
facilities; or (ii) any sale, transfer, or assignment of the shares of project implementation units (PIUs) is 
anticipated, XUARG will consult with ADB at least 6 months prior to the implementation of such change. 
XUARG shall cause PIUs to further ensure that such changes are carried out in a lawful and transparent 
manner. 
4. 
Financial Covenants 
189.  Counterpart funding. The XUARG shall provide the details of the sources of the counterpart 
funding as well as provide corresponding commitment letters. The total cost includes physical and price 
contingencies, and interest during construction. 
190.  Financial management. The XUARG shall establish and maintain sound financial management 
systems in accordance with ADB’s guidelines on the financial management and analysis of projects, 
including the establishment of separate project accounts and the maintenance of minimum balances to 
ensure  smooth cash  flow  and  the  timely  settlement  of  project  construction  liabilities  and  future  debt 
servicing.33

Safeguards monitoring 
a) 
Environment 
192.  Environment safeguards monitoring obligations are defined in the EMP and include (i) project 
readiness  monitoring,  to  be  conducted  by  the  PMO-EO  and  loan  implementation  environmental 
consultants  (LIEC);  (ii)  internal  monitoring,  to  be  conducted  by  the  PIUs,  construction  supervision 
companies  (CSCs)  and  contractors;  (iii)  external  environment  monitoring,  to  be  conducted  by  the 
Changji environmental monitoring station (EMS), contracted by the implementing agencies; (iv) EMP 
compliance monitoring during project implementation and the first year of project operation (or up to the 
date as further to be agreed with the ADB mission), to be conducted by the PMO-EO and LIEC; (v) 
regular monitoring by operation and maintenance units during operation of the project facilities under 
their responsibility; and (vi) monitoring and evaluation of the internal and EMS monitoring results by an 
External Monitor. Monitoring and reporting arrangements defined for this project are described below. 
193.  Assessment  of  project  readiness.  Before  construction,  the  LIEC  and  PMO-EO  will  assess 
project readiness in terms of environmental management based on a set of indicators defined in the 
EMP  and  report  it  to  the  ADB  and  PMO.  This  assessment  will  demonstrate  that  environmental 
commitments  are  being  carried  out  and  environmental  management  systems  are  in  place  before 
construction starts, or suggest corrective actions to ensure that all requirements are met. 
194. 
Internal  monitoring  and  supervision  and  reporting  by  construction  supervision 
companies. During construction, the PIUs, CSCs and contractors will be responsible for conducting 
internal environmental monitoring in accordance with the monitoring plan. Supervision results will be 
reported through  the  CSC  reports  to  the  implementing  agencies. Quarterly  reports  by  the IAs to the 
PMO will include a separate section on EMP implementation progress and environmental performance. 
195.  External monitoring by Changji environmental monitoring station. The IAs will contract the 
Changji  EMS  to  conduct  environmental  monitoring  in  accordance  with  the  monitoring  program.  The 
environmental monitoring system (EMS) will provide a detailed cost estimate prior to implementation. 
Monitoring will be conducted during construction and operation period, until a project completion report 
(PCR) is issued. Semiannual monitoring reports will be prepared by the EMS and submitted to PMO 
and the IAs. 
196.  Environmental management plan implementation compliance monitoring and progress 
reporting. The LIEC and PMO-EO will review project progress and compliance with the EMP based on 
field visits and the review of the progress reports from the IAs and environmental monitoring conducted 
by the EMS. The LIEC and PMO-EO will report EMP implementation progress and compliance along 
with  information  on  project  implementation,  environmental  performance  of  the  contractors,  and 
environmental  compliance  through  quarterly  project  progress  reports  and  annual  environmental 
monitoring  reports  (EMP  Table  A.8).  The  LIEC  will  support  the  PMO-EO  in  developing  the  annual 
environmental  monitoring  reports  (EMR).  The  reports  will 
identify  any  environment  related 
implementation issues and necessary corrective actions, and reflect these in a corrective action plan. 
Operation  and  performance  of  the  project  grievance  redress  mechanism,  environmental  institutional 
strengthening and training, and compliance with all covenants under the project will also be included in 
the report. An External Monitor will be contracted by the PMO to review and evaluate the results of the 
contractors’  and  operators’  internal  monitoring  and  the  results  of  the  EMS  monitoring  against  PRC 
standards.  The  External  Monitor  will  report  to  the  ADB  separately  from  the  PMO’s  Environmental 
Monitoring Reports. 
91 
197.  Project  acceptance.  Upon  completion,  environmental  acceptance  monitoring  shall  be  (i) 
prepared by a licensed environmental monitoring institute in accordance with the PRC’s Guidelines on 
Project  Completion  Environmental  Audit  (2001)  for  all  components  that  required  an  environmental 
impact assessments (EIA) or tabular EIA, (ii) reviewed for approval by the environmental authorities, 
and (iii) reported to ADB through the semiannual progress reports. Subproject completion reports shall 
be finalized within 3 months after each subproject completion, or no later than 1 year with permission 
of the local environment protection bureaus. 
b) 
Land Acquisition and Resettlement 
198.  Xinjiang PMO, with support from the project implementation consultant, will monitor resettlement 
plans  updating  and  implementation  and  submit  quarterly  monitoring  reports  to  ADB,  and  submit  the 
resettlement plan completion report to ADB. Xinjiang PMO will engage an external monitoring agency 
to carry out monitoring and evaluation of social safeguard compliance of the Project during and after 
resettlement implementation, and submit the external monitoring report semi-annually.  
c) 
Ethnic Minority Development Plan 
199. 
Internal  monitoring  of  the  ethnic  minority  development  plan  (EMDP)  will  be  conducted  semi-
annually.  Monitoring  and  reporting  methodologies  are  specified  in  the  EMDP.  Each  implementing 
agency will carry out internal supervision and monitoring to ensure compliance with the provisions of 
the EMDP.  The external monitor will also review the implementation progress of EMDP and report on 
compliance semi-annually. The CPMO will prepare and submit an EMDP completion report to ADB. 
7. 
Social and Gender Action Plan Monitoring 
200.  The PPMS will include monitoring of the social and gender action plan (SGAP). Clear targets 
and  indicators  have  been  established  and  some  indicators,  such  as  those  on  employment,  are  also 
captured  in the  design  and  monitoring  framework  (DMF).  The  social  /  gender  and  EM  development 
specialists will assist the CPMO and IAs set up effective monitoring systems, and work with the focal 
points in the PMO/CPMO and IAs to ensure implementation of the SGAP. The SGAP will be monitored 
semiannually and reported via the quarterly project progress reports and during ADB review missions.34 
C.  Evaluation 
201. 
In  addition  to regular  monitoring,  ADB  and  XUARG  will  jointly  review  project  performance  at 
least  once  a  year.  The  review  will  assess  implementation  performance  and  achievement  of  project 
outcomes  and  outputs,  assess  financial  progress, 
issues  and  constraints  affecting 
implementation, and work out a time-bound action plan for resolution. ADB and XUARG will undertake 
a  midterm  review  to  assess  implementation  status  and  take  appropriate  measures—including 
modification  of  scope  and  implementation  arrangements,  and  reallocation  of  loan  proceeds,  as 
appropriate—to achieve the project impact and outcome.

compliance/non-compliance with PRC and international standards. 
Annual  environment  monitoring  reports.  The  PMO  will  submit  to  the  executing 
agency and ADB the EMRs to comply with the loan environmental agreement and PRC 
Law on EIA. The annual EMRs will report on the progress and results of environmental 
monitoring  and  compliance  of  EMP  implementation,  and  also  briefly  (i)  assess  the 
effectiveness of instituted measures; (ii) point out violation(s), if any; (iii) assess and/or 
recommend corrective actions; and (iv) cite any coordination made for corrective actions 
and, if applicable, certifications for having instituted them effectively. It shall also feature 
possible innovative mitigation measures applied by the contractor, operator, or affected 
residents themselves and other lessons learned in EMP implementation. These will be 
useful  in adjusting the  EMP  to  adapt  to real ground situations.  Proposed adjustments 
and/or enhancement of the EMP must have prior ADB approval. 
204.  Project implementation. XUARG will provide ADB with (i) quarterly progress reports in a format 
consistent with ADB's project performance reporting system; (ii) consolidated annual reports, including 
(a)  progress  achieved  by  output  as  measured  through  the  indicators'  performance  targets,  (b)  key 
implementation issues and solutions, (c) updated procurement plan, and (d) updated implementation 
plan for next 12 months; and (iii) a project completion report within 6 months of physical completion of 
the project. To ensure projects continue to be both viable and sustainable, project accounts and the

E. 
Stakeholder Communication Strategy 
206.  Relevant project information, including implementation progress, will be disclosed in the ADB 
website  and  at  the  PMO.  This  will  include  the  DMF,  resettlement  plans,  environmental  impact 
assessment, and the EMP. It will also include continuing engagement and consultation with the affected 
persons  during  resettlement  plan  updating  and  implementation.  Stakeholder  workshops  will  be  held 
throughout  project  implementation  to  encourage  key  stakeholders,  particularly  residents  in  project 
areas,  to  participate  in  achieving  the  project  benefits  and  to  make  sure  all  stakeholders,  including 
women, the poor, and other vulnerable groups benefit from the project. 
207.  Resettlement. The affected households, residents, village and community leaders, and local 
government  and  bureaus  actively  participated  in  the meaningful  consultations,  risk  assessment, and 
disclosure activities during  resettlement  planning  and will  continue during  resettlement  updating  and 
implementation. A grievance redress mechanism has been established and disclosed to the affected 
people. During monitoring, the affected people will take part in the process by providing timely feedback, 
comments and suggestions.  All internal and external monitoring reports will be disclosed.  
208.  Environment.  Meaningful  consultation  to  safeguard  the  environment  and  local  residents  will 
continue throughout construction and operation phases. The PMO and the implementing agencies will 
be  responsible  for  organizing  the  public  consultations  with  the  support  of  the  LIEC.  Civil  works 
contractors will be required to frequently communicate and consult with the communities in the project 
area of influence, especially those near the project areas. Consultation will focus on public participation 
in  (i)  monitoring  impacts  and  mitigation  measures  during  the  construction  and  operation  stages,  (ii) 
evaluating  environmental  and  economic  benefits  and  social  impacts,  and  (iii)  interviewing  the  public 
after the subcomponents are completed.

 ATTACHMENT 1: ENVIRONMENT MANAGEMENT PLAN (EMP) 
Introduction 
1. 
This Environmental Management Plan (EMP) is developed for the Xinjiang Changji Integrated 
Urban–Rural Infrastructure Demonstration Project (the project) and defines all potential environmental 
impacts  of  the  project  components  and  the  mitigation  and  protection  measures  with  the  objective  of 
avoiding  or  reducing  these  impacts  to  acceptable  levels  and  meeting  applicable  requirements.  The 
EMP  draws  on  the  findings  of  the  domestic  FSR,  domestic  environmental  impact  assessments,  the 
initial  environmental  examination  (IEE),  PPTA  and ADB  review  mission  discussions,  and  agreements 
with the relevant government agencies. 
2. 
The EMP sets out (i) actions to implement mitigation measures; (ii) a monitoring and reporting 
program;  (iii)  institutional/organizational  arrangements;  (iv)  capacity  development  and  training;  (v)  an 
implementation  schedule;  and  (vi)  cost  estimates.  The  final  EMP  forms  part  of  the  Project 
Administration Manual (PAM) and will be included as a separate annex in all bidding documents. The 
contractors  will  be  made  aware  of  their  obligations  to  implement  the  EMP,  to  budget  EMP 
implementation costs in their bids, and to develop site management plans which are fully responsive to 
the EMP. 
Institutional Arrangement

Project Readiness Assessment 
14. 
Before  construction,  the  LIEC  and  PMO-EO  will  assess  each  IA’s  readiness  in 
terms of environmental management based on a set of indicators (Table A1.4) and report it 
to ADB  and  the  PMO.  This  assessment  will  demonstrate  that  environmental  commitments 
are  being  carried  out  and  environmental  management  systems  are  in  place  before 
construction  starts,  or  suggest  corrective  actions  to  ensure  that  all  requirements  are  met. 
The assessment will be repeated at regular intervals to account for new works contracts, and 
documented in the annual environment monitoring reports to ADB.

Monitoring Requirements 
15. 
Three types of project monitoring will be conducted under the EMP:  
(i) 
Internal  monitoring  to  be  conducted  by  the  contractors  and  the  Construction 
Supervision  Companies  (CSCs)  in the  construction  phase  and  facility  operators  in 
the operations phase; 
(ii)  External  monitoring,  to  be  conducted  by  an  authorized  company  (environmental 
monitoring station (EMS)), contracted by the IAs; 
(iii)  EMP  compliance  monitoring  (whether  EMP  measures  are  being  implemented),  to 
be conducted by the LIEC on behalf of the PMO. 
The internal monitoring and results of monitoring by the EMS will be reviewed and evaluated 
by an External Monitor contracted by the PMO. 
16. 
The environmental monitoring plan at Table A1.5 covers the first two: internal and 
EMP-(cid:1005)(cid:1012) 
external monitoring. 
17. 
Internal  monitoring  includes  the  monitoring  of  dust  and  noise  at  all  construction 
sites  as  well  as  the  quality  of  discharged  construction  wastewater,  and  erosion  control.  It 
also  includes  daily  inspection  and  internal  compliance  assessment  with  the  approved  Site 
Management  Plans  of  contractors,  including  construction  site  health  and  safety.  During 
operations,  each  of  the  facility  operation  and  maintenance  units  will  monitor  the 
environmental performance of their facility using appropriate indicator parameters.  
18. 
External  monitoring  by  EMS  during  construction  measures  the  effects  of  noise, 
dust and wastewater runoff from construction sites over the project’s area of influence – i.e. 
outside  the  construction  site  boundary.  For  dust  and  noise,  this  extends  from  the 
construction site boundary to any nearby sensitive receptors. For site runoff water it extends 
to the nearest receiving waterbody (drain, pond, canal or river). During operation it will focus 
on potential impacts from the landfill site on the air and groundwater of the surrounding area 
and the delivery of drinking water from the Qitai No.3 WTP along project pipes. 
19. 
Table A1.5 shows the environmental monitoring program for internal monitoring and 
external  monitoring  designed  for  this  project,  defining  the  scope,  location,  parameter, 
duration  and frequency, and responsible  bodies, for monitoring during the  construction  and 
operational  stages.  Monitoring  costs  are  estimates  based  on  the  experience  of  the  PPTA 
team  and  PMO  from  other  projects  elsewhere  in  the  PRC.  ADB  will  oversee  project 
compliance  on  the  basis  of  the  annual  environmental  monitoring  reports  provided  by  the 
PMO, compliance reviews by the LIEC and site visits as required.   
20. 
The  results  of  the  environmental  monitoring  will  be  compared  with  EMP 
requirements, site management plans, and relevant PRC standards as defined in Table A1.6. 
Non-compliance  will  be  highlighted  in  the  monitoring  reports.  Additionally,  an  External 
Monitor will be contracted by the PMO to review and evaluate the results of the contractors’ 
and  operators’  internal  monitoring  and  the  results  of  the  EMS  monitoring  against  PRC 
standards.  The  External  Monitor  will  report  to  the  ADB  separately  from  the  PMO’s 
Environmental Monitoring Reports.

Compliance monitoring. EMP compliance monitoring is the systematic evaluation 
of the overall progress of the implementation of EMP measures  (Table A1.3). Evaluation of 
the  compliance  with  the  EMP  will  be  undertaken  regularly  by  the  PMO-EO  and  the  LIEC. 
The PMO-EO and the LIEC will report EMP implementation progress and compliance along 
with  information  on  project  implementation,  environmental  performance  of  the  contractors, 
and  environmental  compliance  through  quarterly  project  progress  reports  and  annual 
environmental monitoring reports (Table A1.7).

EMP  Compliance  report  by  the  LIEC.  The  LIEC  will  conduct  an  annual  EMP 
compliance  review  and  report  the  results  to  the  ADB.  This  will  comprise  to 
findings  from  regular  EMP  compliance  monitoring  and  site  visits.  It  will  identify 
any  environment-related  implementation  issues,  propose  necessary  corrective 
actions, and reflect these in a corrective action plan. 
External  Monitor  Reports.  The  review  and  evaluation  of  the  findings  of  the 
internal monitoring by contractors and  CSCs, facility operators, and EMS will be 
reported annually to the ADB in a separate External Monitor report. 
Environmental acceptance reporting. Following the PRC Regulation on Project 
Completion  Environmental  Audit  (MEP,  2001),  within  three  months  after  the 
completion  of  each  project  component,  an  environmental  acceptance  report  for 
each  shall  be  prepared  by  a  licensed  environmental  monitoring  institute, 
contracted  by  the  IA.  The  report  will  be  reviewed  and  approved  by  the  relevant

The  capacity  of  the  IAs  and  the  PMO’s  staff  responsible  for  EMP  implementation 
and  supervision  will  be  strengthened. All  parties  involved  in  implementing  and  supervising 
the  EMP  must  have  an  understanding  of  the  goals,  methods,  and  practices  of  project 
environmental management. The project will address any lack of capacities and expertise in 
environmental management through (i) institutional strengthening, and (ii) training.  Both will 
be funded as part of the project’s capacity building output.  
24. 
environmental management will be strengthened through the following measures:  
Institutional  strengthening.  The  capacities  of  the  PMO  and  IAs  to  coordinate 
EMP-(cid:1006)(cid:1007) 
- The  appointment  of  a  staff  member  within  the  PMO  (PMO-EO)  in  charge  of  EMP 
coordination, including GRM;  
- The  appointment  of  one  national  environmental  consultant  under 
loan 
implementation  consultancy  (the  LIEC)  to  guide  PMO  and  IAs  in  implementing  the 
EMP  and  ensure  compliance  with  ADB’s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (SPS  2009); 
and 
the 
- The  assignment  of  an  environment  specialist  by  each  IA  (IA-ES)  to  conduct  regular 
site inspections and coordinate periodic air and noise monitoring. 
25. 
Training.  The  EA,  PMO  and  IAs  will  receive  training  in  EMP  implementation, 
supervision,  and reporting,  and  on  the  Grievance  Redress  Mechanism.  Initially  the  training 
will be in formal workshops, then will continue with on the job training by the LIEC and other 
specialists  hired  under  the  consulting  services.  The  formal  training  will  cover  EMP 
implementation,  supervision,  and  reporting,  and  the  Grievance  Redress  Mechanism  (Table 
A1.8). Training will be facilitated by the LIEC with the support of other experts under the loan 
implementation  consultant  services,  and  funded  as  part  of  Project  Output  6:  Capacity 
Building.

Grievance Redress Mechanism, Consultation 
26. 
A  Grievance  Redress  Mechanism  (GRM)  will  be  established,  at  least  2  months 
before  project  implementation  commences,  as  part  of  the  project  EMP  to  receive  and 
manage any public environmental issues which may arise due to the Project. The PMO will 
ensure that potentially affected communities are informed about the GRM at an early stage 
of  the  project.  During  the  project  preparation  phase,  the  IAs  and  PMO  personnel  received 
training on the GRM from the PPTA team. 
27. 
The PMO is the lead agency responsible for overall management, implementation, 
and reporting of the GRM. The PMO-EO coordinates the GRM and: (i) instructs the IAs and 
contractors  on  their  responsibilities  in  the  GRM;  (ii)  establishes  a  simple  Complaints 
Register, to document  and  track grievances received  (including  forms  to  record  complaints 
and how  they  have been  resolved);  and (iii)  reports  on  progress  of the GRM  in the  annual 
environmental monitoring and progress reports (EMR) to ADB.  
28. 
Each IA will assign a member of staff, who is responsible for implementation of the 
GRM and other relevant aspects of the EMP. This will be the IA-ES. Tasks include keeping a 
record  of  complaints. At  least  two  months  before  construction  commences,  these  contacts 
will  be  publicized  at  each  construction  site  and  forwarded  to  local  village  committees  to 
ensure that entry points to the GRM are well known.  
29. 
Costs for setting up the GRM procedures and publicizing them at subproject sites 
will be borne by the IAs. The costs of the centralized coordinating and record-keeping will be 
borne by the PMO. Indicative costs are in Table A1.3 under GRM. 
30. 
GRM readiness procedures prior to start of construction. To be successful and 
reduce the likelihood of public concerns, the following measures will be implemented before 
any construction:  
1)  On-site procedures: (i) all contractors and CSC staff will be briefed by the PMO-EO 
and IA-ES on the GRM. Contractors and workers will be instructed to be courteous 
to local residents and, in the event they are approached by the general public with 
an issue, to immediately halt their work and report the issue to the foreman; (ii) at 
least  one  sign  will  be  erected  at  each  construction  site  providing  the  public  with 
updated  project  information  (the  purpose  of  the  project  activity,  the  duration  of 
disturbance, the responsible entities on-site), the GRM process, and contact names 
and details for the GRM entry points.  
2)  Non-project  agencies:  Prior  to  project  construction,  the  PMO-EO  will  notify  all 
relevant  agencies  about  the  project  and  GRM,  so  that  if  these  agencies  receive 
complaints, they know to contact the PMO-EO and follow up as necessary. This will 
include, but not be limited to, the EPB, and local police.  
31. 
follows.  
The  procedure  and  timeframe  for  the  GRM  is  shown  in  Figure  A1.1  and  is  as 
Stage 1 (maximum 10 working days): Affected persons can submit a written or oral 
complaint to the contractor, CSC or IA. Complaints received by any other institutions 
will  be  referred  back  to  the  IA  for  action.  The  IA  will  notify  the  PMO-EO  of  the 
EMP-(cid:1006)(cid:1009) 
complaint  within  two  days.  The  PMO-EO  will  enter  the  complaint  in  the  Complaints 
Register.  
Where the complaint has been lodged via the EPB Hotline, the EPB will advise the IA 
and contractor and monitor the corrective actions.  
The contractor, in consultation with the IA, attempts to resolve the issue directly with 
the affected person. Within five working days of receiving the complaint, the agency 
will provide clear advice to the affected person on the proposed corrective action and 
by when it will be taken. The corrective action will be implemented not later than 10 
working days from receipt of the complaint. The PMO-EO will enter the resolution in 
the Complaints Register. 
If quick  corrective action  is  not  possible,  or the IA  is  unsure  how  to proceed,  or  the 
complainant is not satisfied by the initial corrective action, then the complaint will be 
referred to the PMO-EO for Stage 2. 
Stage 2 (maximum 5 working days): For complaints not resolved in Stage 1, Stage 
2 is initiated. The PMO-EO, contractor, CSC and IA will meet with the affected person 
and  together  discuss  the  issue  and  identify  possible  solutions.  At  the  meeting,  a 
possible  solution  will  be  agreed  upon.  The  contractor  or  IA,  as  appropriate,  will 
implement the agreed solution and report the outcome to the PMO-EO.  
Stage  3  (maximum  10  working  days):  If  Stage  2  is  unsuccessful  (i.e.  no  solution 
can be identified or the affected person is not satisfied with the proposed solution) the 
PMO-EO  will  convene  a  multi-stakeholder  meeting  and 
the  Project 
Coordinating Group to ensure that any needed inputs from other project agencies are 
coordinated.  The  workshop  will  identify  a  solution  acceptable  to  all.  The  agreed 
solution will be implemented and a report on the outcome provided to the PMO and 
ADB. 
involve 
No part of the project GRM affects the existing rights of affected persons to take their 
complaints  to  the  courts.  If  Stage  3  is  unsuccessful  in  addressing  the  issue,  this 
course is still available to affected persons. 
The  above  steps  relate  to  the  construction  phase  where  most  complaints  will  be 
directed  in  the  first  instance  to  the  contractor,  CSC  or  IA.  During  initial  operations, 
complaints  will  be  received  by  the  operations  and  maintenance  (O&M)  units  of  the 
facilities. 
PMO  will  inform  ADB  of  all  complaints  and  actions  under  the  GRM  and  include  all 
relevant documents in its progress reports to ADB. 
32. 
Any  costs  incurred  to  receive and document grievances will  be  paid by  the  PMO. 
The  grievance  procedures  will  remain  valid  throughout  the  duration  of  project  construction 
and the first two years of project operation. 
33. 
If the above steps are unsuccessful, people adversely affected by the project may 
submit  complaints  to ADB’s Accountability  Mechanism. All  parties should  employ  their  best 
efforts  to  solve  problems  that  are  reported  through  the  GRM.  Only  when  these  are 
exhausted  should  the  ADB’s  Accountability  Mechanism  be  accessed.1  The  Accountability 
Mechanism provides an independent forum and process whereby people adversely affected 
by  ADB-assisted  projects  can  voice,  and  seek  a  resolution  of  their  problems,  as  well  as 
report alleged violations of ADB‘s operational policies and procedures.

Cost Estimates 
34. 
This section provides an estimate of the cost of implementing the EMP. The costs 
are  summarized  in  Table A1.9  below.  The  cost  comprises  three  categories:  mitigation  and 
management measures (from Table A1.3); environmental monitoring (from Table A1.5); and, 
training (from Table A1.8). Refer to Tables A1.3, A1.5 and A1.8 for more details of each item. 
Costs are presented for the construction and operational phases of the project duration (until 
PCR  stage).  The  costs  do  not  include:  (i)  detailed  design  revisions  and  adjustments;  (ii) 
facility  operating  costs  (which  include  environmental  safeguards);  and  (iii)  the  salaries  of 
PMO  environment  staff.  Costs  for  the  mitigation  measures  are  based  on  estimates  in  the 
domestic EIA and the experience of the PPTA team and PMO in other projects. Costs for the 
monitoring  and  training  are  also  estimates  based  on  the  experience  of  the  PPTA  team  in 
similar projects and discussed with the PMO. 
35. 
The  total  estimated  cost  of  implementing  the  EMP  is  CNY  3.9  million  over  the 
project duration (Table A1.9, overleaf). It is anticipated that about CNY 2.35 million (59.7%) 
will be paid through the construction contractors, CNY 1.4 million (35.8%) paid through the 
EMP-(cid:1006)(cid:1011) 
IAs (mainly for external monitoring) and CNY 177,000 (4.5%) through the PMO.  
36. 
During  project  implementation,  the  budget  will  be  adjusted  based  on  actual 
requirements.  Contractors  will  bear  the  costs  of  all  mitigation  measures  and  internal 
monitoring during construction, which shall be budgeted in the bids. IAs will bear the costs 
related  to  setting  up  and  running  the  GRM,  mitigation  measures  during  operation  and 
external  environmental  monitoring  during  construction.  Training  costs  will  be  part  of  the 
Project Implementation Support component of the project’s capacity building output, through 
the PMO.  
Mechanism for feedback and adjustment  
37. 
Based on environmental monitoring and reporting systems in place, the PMO shall 
assess  whether 
further  mitigation  measures  are  required  as  corrective  action,  or 
improvement  in  environmental  management  practices  are  required.  The  effectiveness  of 
mitigation  measures  and  monitoring  and  inspection  plans  will  be  evaluated  by  a  feedback 
reporting  system.  If  the  PMO  identifies  a  substantial  deviation  from  the  EMP,  or  if  any 
changes  are  made  to  the  project  scope  that  may  cause  significant  adverse  environmental 
impacts or increase the number of affected people, then the PMO shall immediately consult 
ADB to identify EMP adjustment requirements.

Public Consultation Plan 
38. 
Two rounds of public consultation, including information dissemination, have been 
undertaken  during  the  PPTA  and  are  described  in  Chapter  VII  of  the  IEE.  Plans  for  public 
involvement  during the detailed  design,  construction  and  operation  phases  have also  been 
developed  during  project  preparation.  These  plans  include  public  participation  in  (i) 
monitoring  impacts  and  mitigation  measures  during  the  construction  and  operation  stages, 
(ii) evaluating environmental and economic benefits and social impacts, and (iii) interviewing 
the public after the sub-components are completed. 
39. 
Public  participation  plans  are  part  of  the  project implementation  and  management 
plan.  The  IAs  are  responsible  for  public  participation  during  project  implementation  and 
operation. Costs for public participation activities during construction are covered by project 
funding.  The  unit  costs  are  estimated  as  CNY5,000  ($770)  for  each  public  workshop,  and 
CNY6,000 ($920) for each press conference.

ANNEX A. DRAFT TERMS OF REFERENCE: PMO ENVIRONMENT OFFICER (PMO-EO) 
I. 
BACKGROUND 
1. 
Development  projects  which  are  assisted  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) 
routinely  require  the  establishment  of  a  Project  Management  Office  (PMO).  The  PMO  is 
responsible for  project  implementation.  Compliance  with  the  Loan  and Project Agreements 
includes implementation of an Environment Management Plan (EMP), which is prepared as 
part  of  the  project  environment  impact  assessment.  The  EMP  is  the  critical  guiding 
document  to  manage,  monitor,  and  report  upon  potential  project  environmental  impacts. 
Implementation of the EMP is a full-time task. For this reason, the PMO assigns a full-time 
officer for this role. These terms of reference describe the requirements for this officer. 
II. 
SCOPE AND DURATION OF WORK 
2. 
will report directly to the PMO. The position is for the entire project duration (five years).   
The officer will work on behalf of the PMO to implement the project EMP. The officer 
III.  QUALIFICATIONS 
3. 
The  officer  will  have:  (i)  an  undergraduate  degree  or  higher  in  environmental 
management  or  related  field;  (ii)  at  least  five  years  of  experience  in  environmental 
management,  monitoring,  and/or  impact  assessment;  (iii)  ability  to  communicate  and  work 
effectively with local communities, contractors, and government agencies; and (iv) ability to 
analyze data and  prepare technical  reports.  Desirable,  but  not  essential, is  a  proficiency  in 
spoken and written English. 
IV.  DETAILED TASKS 
4. 
The PMO Environment Officer will have a detailed understanding of the project EMP 
and  supporting  documents,  including  the  domestic  environmental  reports,  the  project  EIA, 
and project environmental assurances. The officer will have the following tasks. 
(i)  Assess whether the EMP requires updating due to any changes in project design which 
may have occurred after the EMP was prepared. 
(ii)  Distribute  the  Chinese language  version of the EMP  to all relevant  agencies,  including 
implementing  agencies,  provincial  and  municipal  agencies  for  environment 
the 
protection. This should occur at least three months before construction begins. 
(iii)  Conduct meetings with agencies as necessary to ensure they understand their specific 
responsibilities described in the EMP. 
(iv)  Ensure  that  relevant  mitigation,  monitoring  and  reporting  measures  in  the  EMP  are 
included in the bidding documents, contracts and relevant construction plans. 
(v)  Confirm that the Implementing Agencies (IAs) responsible, through their contractors, for 
the  internal  environment  monitoring  described  in  the  EMP  understand  their  tasks  and 
will implement the monitoring in a timely fashion.  
(vi)  At  least  two  months  before  construction  begins,  establish  and  implement  the  project 
Grievance  Redress  Mechanism  (GRM)  described  in  the  EMP.  This  will  include:  (a)
