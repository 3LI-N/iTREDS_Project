PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
1. 
The  project  location,  design  and activities are  described  in  Appendix  1.  The  project  is 
additional  financing  to  Loan  2200-BAN  (SF):  Southwest  Area  Integrated  Water  Resources 
Planning  and  Management  Project.  It  will  expand  successful  experience  of  the  current 
Southwest  project  neighboring  geographical  areas.  The  project  will  apply  participatory  water 
resources planning and management procedures. The procedures are described in  Appendix 
2.1 
A.
Rationale  
2. 
Water  affects  various  aspects  of  the  livelihoods  of  the  rural  population  in  Bangladesh. 
The  country  is  on  a  vast  floodplain  at  the  confluence of  the  three  major rivers,  and has faced 
significant  physical  challenges  including  monsoon  floods,  changes  in  river  courses  due  to 
erosion and sedimentation, water scarcity in the dry season, cyclones, and widespread arsenic 
contamination of groundwater. The productivity of agriculture, fisheries and associated nonfarm 
industries  is  susceptible  to  these  water-related  issues.  More  than  80%  of  poor  people  in 
Bangladesh  live  in  rural  areas,2  and  depend  on  agriculture  or  fisheries  for  their  livelihoods. 
Despite  a  fall  in  the  share  in  the  gross  domestic  products  to  17%  in  FY2013,  agriculture  in 
Bangladesh remains the largest employer, providing jobs to 48% of  the population.3 Access to 
and effective management of water is essential to improved productivity and livelihoods for rural 
poor  people.  Water  management  is  complicated  by  diverse  stakeholder  interests  amoung 
different water users including agriculture, fisheries, navigation, industries, and drinking water.  
Chronical  infrastructure  deterioration  of  existing  flood  control,  drainage  and  irrigation 
3. 
(FCD/I)  schemes,  especially  large-  scale  schemes,4  has  impaired  their  water  management 
capacity.  The  absence  of  stakeholder  participation  causes  a  lack  of  user  ownership,  which  is 
followed  by  rapid  deterioration  of  structures,  inefficient  and  irrelevant  planning,  and  inefficient 
water uses. Managing critical water resources through an integrated and participatory approach 
is essential for efficient water management; the sustainability of FCD/I schemes; and improved 
livelihood of vulnerable poor people, including women.  
The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  provided  finance  for  participatory  water 
4. 
management  projects for  small-scale schemes  since  1995.5  The  schemes  have demonstrated 
success in improved infrastructure performance through beneficiary participation. To extend the 
integrated and participatory water management to the large scale FCD/I schemes, in 2005 ADB 
approved a $20 million equivalent loan for the current project.6 The project also included $12.5 
million  of  cofinancing  from  the  Government  of  the  Netherlands.  The  current  project  supports 
establishment  of  participatory  water  management  organizations  (WMOs)  with  the  inclusion  of 
socially disadvantaged groups; integrated water resources management planning; infrastructure

Project (Second Phase)” in the government’s Development Project Proposal/Proforma.

renovation; and coordinated support services for WMOs in the two pilot subprojects, comprising 
the Narail and Chenchuri Beel FCD/I schemes with a total area of 57,000 hectares (ha).  
5. 
The  current  project  successfully  demonstrated  that  the  participatory  approach  can 
improve  the  water  resources  management  of  large  FCD/I  schemes.  This  is  the  first  success 
case for large schemes among several trials in Bangladesh. After a slow start-up as a result of 
delays due mainly to limited experience of the Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) 
in using a participatory approach, the progress of the current project has significantly improved 
since  2010.  Renovation  of  water  management  infrastructure  in  the  two  targeted  subproject 
areas  has  been  completed  with  satisfactory  achievements  of  anticipated  targets.  In  total,  116 
WMOs,  consisting  of  102  water  management  groups  (WMGs)  and  14  higher  tier  water 
management  associations  (WMAs),  have  been  organized  and  trained  and  are  effectively 
functioning  in  the  two  subproject  areas.  About  25,400  households  have  benefitted  from  the 
project,  including  the  socially  disadvantaged  groups  such  as  landless  farmers  and  women. 
Capacity enhancement activities for WMOs are demonstrating visible proactive WMO activities 
in agriculture, fisheries, livestock, and collective livelihood actions. Operation and maintenance 
(O&M)  of  small  structures  have  been  handed  over  to  WMOs,  after  development  of  O&M 
manuals  and  WMO  O&M  capacity.  As  a  result  of  the  current  project,  rice  production  nearly 
doubled and fishery production increased by 30% in the two subproject areas.7 BWDB acquired 
knowledge and experience of participatory water resources planning and management through 
the project. 
The  current  project  has  been  continuously  rated  on  track  since  the  second  quarter  of 
6. 
2011. Cumulative disbursement had reached $20.3 million (or 95% of the total loan amount)8 for 
the ADB loan and $12.3 million (98% of the total grant amount) for the Netherlands grant as of 
31  July  2015.  The  current  project  has  been  complying  with  all  loan  covenants,  including 
requirements 
resettlement  safeguards  and  gender 
consideration.

7. 
The  additional  financing  will  replicate  the  successful  current  project  in  nine  additional 
subprojects with a total area of 84,000 ha and the population of about 469,500 in nearby areas. 
By applying knowledge and experience acquired from the current project, BWDB’s institutional 
capacity for the participatory water resources management is expected to be enrooted. Based 
on the lessons learned through the current project, the design of the institutional strengthening 
component will be further strengthened by establishment of a mechanism of a national capacity 
enhancement  support  under  BWDB  to  ensure  sustainability  of  participatory  water  resources 
management by WMOs.  
8. 
The project is in line with government and ADB strategies. Economic growth and poverty 
reduction are the main objectives of the government’s Sixth Five-Year Plan, FY2011 – FY2015.9 
Achieving food security is considered essential to accomplishing these objectives. Food security 
and agricultural productivity is also part of ADB’s strategic priorities for 2014-2020 in the action 
plan of the Midterm Review of the ADB’s strategy 2020.10 ADB’s country partnership strategy for

disbursed amount in dollars at $20.3 million exceeds the approved loan amount of $20.0 million because the loan 
is denominated in special drawing rights.

Impact and Outcome  
9. 
The  impact  of  the  project  will  be  enhanced  economic  growth  and  reduced  poverty  in 
rural  areas  of  the  selected  districts  in  the  southwest  area  of  Bangladesh,  aligned  with  the 
government’s  Sixth  Five-Year  Plan,  FY2011–FY2015.  The  outcome  will  be  enhanced 
productivity and sustainability of the selected existing FCDI systems, which could contribute to 
increasing  incomes  and  livelihood  standards  of  disadvantaged  groups,  including  women.  The 
impact and outcome statements are unchanged from the current project.  
C.
Outputs  
10. 
The  output  targets  for  the  current  project  will  be  scaled  up  by  expanding  the 
geographical areas from the current two subprojects to include nine additional subprojects. The 
scope  and  targets  of  the  additional  financing  outputs  are  summarized  in  the  following 
paragraphs.  
Output  1:  Water  management  organizations’  capacity  for  sustainable  water 
11. 
resources planning and management in the subproject areas strengthened. The additional 
financing  will  cover  formation  and  capacity  development  of  WMOs  in  the  additional  nine 
subproject areas, aiming at enrollment of 70% of farmers. Follow-up support for O&M capacity 
development  will  also  be  provided  to  the  existing  102  WMGs  and  14  WMAs  in  the  two 
subproject areas of the current project. An integrated water management plan will be prepared 
for each subproject area. Each plan formulates holistic water resources management planning 
and  safeguard  assessments  for  the  subproject,  following  intensive  participatory  analyses  of 
local  conditions  and  needs.  Each  subproject  will  be  divided  into  hydrological  subunits. WMAs 
will  be  formed  that  will  manage  each  subunit  and  lower-tier WMGs.  A  subunit  implementation 
plan  (SIP)  will  be  prepared  for  each  subunit.  The  plan  will  include  specific  requirements  for 
renovation or construction of water management infrastructure, and capacity development and 
livelihood support programs for WMOs.  
12. 
Subsequent to preparation of SIPs, the project will support the WMOs to implement the 
institutional development plan specified in the SIPs, including (i) capacity development training 
of executive committees and subgroups under WMOs, (ii) development of operational rules, (iii) 
registration, and (iv) establishment of a fee collection system for O&M services and other WMO 
activities.  The  project  will  also  support  skills  development  of  WMOs  for  efficient  use  of  water 
management infrastructure to improve the productivity of agriculture and fisheries activities, and 
for  ensuring  attention  is given  to  all  aspects  of  water resource management  related  to gender 
and social inclusion. The support will be linked to other income-generating activities of WMOs. 
An additional 150 WMGs are expected to be formed under the project, with the inclusion of the 
socially disadvantaged and with 33% participation of women.  
13. 
The project support will be extended to training and capacity development of WMOs for 
monitoring  civil  works,  routine  minor  maintenance  of  infrastructure,  preparing  O&M  manuals, 
and effectively using WMO O&M funds. O&M responsibility for infrastructure will be transferred

4 
to WMAs or WMGs, depending on their functions and covering area, after completion of works 
and WMO O&M capacity development training.  
14. 
Output  2:  Infrastructure  facilities  of  flood  control,  drainage,  and  irrigation 
schemes  in  the  subproject  areas  restored.  The  second  output  will  include  renovation  or 
construction of water management infrastructure, such as gated water retention structures, flood 
embankments, re-excavation of drainage and/or irrigation canals, and local riverbank protection 
works, as specified in the SIPs.  
15. 
Output  3:  Institutional  capacity  for  sustainable  participatory  integrated  water 
resources  planning  and  management  strengthened.  The  third  output  will  focus  on  the 
national  institutional  capacity  development  of  BWDB  for  (i)  efficient  coordination  with 
government departments, such as the Department of Agriculture Extension and the Department 
of  Fisheries;  (ii)  management  and  monitoring  of  WMO  activities  that  will  be  registered  with 
BWDB  under  the  new  participatory  water  management  rules  2014;12  and  (iii)  performance 
monitoring and O&M of water management infrastructure.

Functions of the Central Project Coordination Office (PCO) under BWDB will be 
merged with PMO, and a Dhaka liaison office of PMO will function as the PCO.  
The  existing  PMO  office  is  placed  in  Jessore  and  a  liaison  office  in  Dhaka.  For 
the  implementation  of the  additional  subprojects,  PMO’s  office will  be  moved  to 
Faridpur, and will continue the liaison office in Dhaka.  
The national-level technical coordination committee will be newly formed.  
The  existing  district  level  regular  inter-agency  coordination  meetings  for  the 
subproject  implementation  will  be  continued  as  the  district  project  coordination 
committee.  
The  new  project  will  have four  SMOs,  while  the  current  project  has  two  SMOs. 
The four SMOs will implement nine subprojects.  
17. 
Project Steering Committee. The existing set-up will be continued. It is chaired by the 
Secretary,  MOWR,  with  the  project  director  as  the  committee  secretary.  Members  will  include 
representatives from ministries and agencies concerned.13   
18. 
Project  Management  Office  (PMO).  The  existing  set-up  will  be  continued.  PMO  is 
placed under the Additional Director General (West Region), BWDB and is led by the full-time 
project  director  not  less  than  the  level  of  Superintending  Engineer.  PMO  will  be  enhanced  by 
individuals recruited from the market, such as research assistants and facilitators. The research 
assistants will assist PMO for technical aspects including data processing and analyses for the 
preparation  of  SIPs  and  management  information  system  (MIS).  Senior  and  community 
facilitators will be directly engaged by PMO, and will support agriculture extension officers’ roles 
including  community  mobilization  and  WMO  support  and  capacity  development.  PMO  will 
continue  to  be  responsible  for  overall  project  management  and  monitoring.  Like  the  current 
project, PMO will also (i) prepare IWMPs of the four subprojects with the support of the relevant 
SMOs,  and  (ii)  develop  and  maintain  MIS.  The  Principal  Extension  Officer,  the  head  of  the 
WMO development unit under PMO, will serve as a gender focal point of the project.   
The Central PCO under Planning Directorate II of BWDB was established for the current 
19. 
project  for  coordination  with  MOWR,  BWDB,  and  other  relevant  agencies,  but  will  be  merged 
with  PMO  for  ensuring  direct  and  close  coordination  with  the  relevant  agencies.  The  liaison 
office  of  PMO  in  Dhaka  will  play  the  anticipated  coordination  role  of  PCO.  The  member 
secretary  of  the  project  steering  committee  will  be  changed  from  the  project  coordinator,  the 
head of PCO, to the project director. PMO will also coordinate with other BWDB projects, and 
other  externally  financed  projects.  For  institutional  capacity  strengthening  activities,  PMO  will 
coordinate with Office of Chief Water Management and Directorate of Audit of BWDB.

Subproject  Management  Office  (SMO).  The  existing  set-up  mechanism  will  be 
20. 
continued,  including  distribution  of  responsibilities  between  PMO  and  SMOs  and  anticipated 
functions of SMOs. Four SMOs will be newly established at the level of subproject to implement 
nine  subprojects  as  in  Table  3.1  and  Figures  3.1  and  3.2.  Each  SMO  will  be  headed  by  a 
senior  executive  engineer.  The  Executive  Engineer  Construction  Division  Chenchuri  Beel  was 
created  under  the  current  Southwest  project,  and  has  been  working  exclusively  for  the 
implementation  of  the  Chanchuri  Beel  Subproject.  The  SMO  will  be  shifted  from  Narail  to 
Faridpur, and this special set-up SMO will exclusively work for the new project. It will implement 
five  out  of  nine  subprojects.  Other  three  SMOs  will  be  built  on  the  existing  set-up  of  the 
concerned  BWDB  division  O&M  offices  supplemented  by  required  staff,  and  executive 
engineers who are the head of the division O&M offices will lead SMOs in dual charges basis.  
The  three  dual  charge  SMOs  will  implement  the  remaining  four  subprojects  as  indicated  in 
Table 3.1. Like in the current project, SMO will also (i) support PMO to prepare IWMPs, and (ii) 
prepare  and  implement  SIPs.  PMOs  will  have  a  space  that  can  be  used  for  documentation 
works and discussions for facilitators and PMO staff’s field visits.

The existing Narail O&M office and relevant field-level Deputy Chief Extension Officer at 
the Jessore Office will be continuously involved in the follow-up capacity strengthening support 
for existing 102 WMGs and 14 WMAs that were established in the  Narail and Chenchuri Beel 
subprojets  under  the  current  Southwest  project.  The  Narail  O&M  office  is  in  charge  of  the 
implementation  of  the  Narail  Subproject  under  the  current  project,  while  the  Chenchiri  Beel 
special set-up SMO is in charge of the Chenchuri Beel subprojects. After the completion of the 
current project, the Narail O&M office will be  in charge of O&M of structures in the  Narail and 
Chenchuri  Beel  schemes,  and  the  two  schemes  are  under  the  jurisdiction  of  Deputy  Chief 
Extension  Officer  at  the  Jessore  Office  of  BWDP  for  registration  and  management  of  WMOs. 
PMO, especially its WMO development unit, will be enhanced by facilitators engaged from the 
market,  and  will  implement  the  follow-up  support  in  coordination  with  the  Narail  O&M  and 
Deputy Chief Extension Officer.  
11 
Supporting  agencies. The  existing  collaboration  will  be  continued.  DAE  and DOF are 
22. 
the key  supporting  agencies,  and  their  district  or  upazila (sub-district)  level  offices  will  provide 
technical  inputs  for  IWMP  preparation,  SIP  preparation,  and  capacity  enhancement  of WMOs 
for relevant topics. District or upazila level offices DOL, DPHE and district women affairs officers 
will  also  provide  technical  inputs  for  SIP  preparation  and  capacity  enhancement  of WMOs  for 
relevant topic where necessary. DOC’s support will include technical inputs to BWDB’s capacity 
strengthening  programs  for  registration,  auditing,  monitoring  and  management  of  WMOs. 
Registration  and  auditing  of  WMOs  were  shifted  from  DOC  to  BWDB  under  the  new 
Participatory  Water  Management  Regulation  2014.  DOC  will  provide  technical  inputs  for 
capacity  development  of  the  BWDB’s  new  role.  The  existing  memorandums  of  understanding 
(MOU)  between  BWDB/MOWR  and  each  agency  concerned  will  be  reviewed  and  renewed 
within  9  months  of  the  loan  effectiveness.  Specific  cooperation  arrangements  will  be  agreed 
upon under the MOUs.  
23. 
Possible collaboration with and support from other organizations will also be explored in 
the  course  of  the  project  implementation,  especially  for  enhancing  technical  inputs  to  training 
and other institutional capacity development activities for WMOs and BWDB, as appropriate and 
depending  on  the  needs  of  WMOs.  Topics  may  include  agriculture  and  fisheries  post-harvest 
processing  and  development  of  linkages  with  markets  or  business  partners  for  ensuring 
sustainability of WMOs.14

committee  is  a  project  specific  set-up,  and  is  chaired  by  the  Project  Director,  PMO,  and 
members  will  be  representatives  from  the  district  concerned  and  district  offices  of  the  key 
supporting  departments.  Representatives  of  other  supporting  departments  may  be  invited  for 
the  meetings  as  necessary.  This  committee  is  mainly  for  planning  and  monitoring  of  project 
activities,  especially  WMO  capacity  development  activities.  Progress  and  achievements  of 
training for WMOs will be reported, and the committee will discuss and coordinate training plans 
of  various  topics  in  WMO  financial  management,  agriculture,  fisheries,  livestock,  women 
empowerment and other capacity development for WMOs.  
26.

27. 
Joint  Management  Committee  (JMC).  Concept  and  functions  of  JMCs  of  the  current 
project will be continued. A JMC will be established for each subproject, to coordinate, monitor 
and  make  decisions  on  water  resources  planning  and  management  in  the  concerned 
subproject.  The  JMC’s  tasks  will  include  endorsement  of  O&M  plans  of  water  management 
structures, monitoring O&M of water management structures, and an intermediator role of water 
management  conflicts  among WMAs  and/or WMGs  that  cannot  be  resolved  by  themselves.  It 
will  be  chaired  by  the  project  director  during  the  project  period,  and  by  a  superintending 
engineer, the head of a concerned BWDB circle office after the project period.  Members will be 
the  representatives  from  the  BWDB  circle  office,  SMO,  WMAs,  local  government  institutions, 
and district offices of the supporting departments.

Financial Management Assessment

FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT 
A  financial  management  assessment  of  BWDB  was  undertaken  during  the  project 
31. 
preparation  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  Guidelines  for  Financial  Management  and  Analysis  of 
Projects  and  Financial  Due  Diligence:  a  Methodology  Note,  and  Technical  Guidance  Notes.15  
The financial management assessment considered the capacity of the BWDB, including funds-
flow  arrangements,  staffing,  accounting  and  financial  reporting  systems,  financial  information 
systems, and internal and external auditing arrangements. BWDB has experienced a number of 
bi-lateral and multi-lateral projects, including the on-going the Southwest Area Integrated Water 
Resources  Planning  and  Management  Project  (ADB  and  The  Netherlands  Government)  and 
other projects financed by ADB.  
32. 
The assessment concludes that the overall pre-mitigation financial management risk of 
BWDB  is  moderate,  and  BWDB  has  sufficient  experience and  capacity  to  manage the  project 
funds  as  well  as  adequate  fund  flow,  accounting  and  budgeting  arrangements.  The 
government’s midterm review report and the project performance assessment of the Southwest 
project  concluded  that  BWDB’s  institutional  capacity  as  the  executing  agency  is  satisfactory. 
The draft project completion report of the project management consultant of the current project 
also  concluded  that  the  capacity  was  strengthened  through  the  project.  The  project  set  clear 
input  and  output  targets  to  ensure  good  governance.  The  latest  audited  project  financial 
statements under the project were submitted on time, and with an unqualified audit opinion. The 
management letter highlighted some minor financial irregularities, which BWDB has addressed. 
However,  improvements  are  required  in  several  areas  including  (i)  introducing  more  recent 
software and IT system for accounting data management, (ii) ensuring a full time accountant at 
PMO,  and  (iii)  regular  training  in  ADB  disbursement  and  procurement  guidelines.  Mitigation 
measures are built into the project design.   
Key  findings  of  the  financial  management  assessment  and  the  financial  management

action plan are as follows. 16

Conclusions and Action Plan 
Funds  received  from  donors  including  ADB  are  deposited 
into  an  imprest  account  of  an  approved  commercial  bank. 
The  proposed  arrangement  generally  follows  approved 
government protocols, and it is generally satisfactory. BWDB 
does not have the capacity to manage foreign exchange risk 
as this task is undertaken by the MOF on behalf of BWDB.  
The MOF, at the request of BWDB, will usually approve the 
opening of an Imprest account to any authorized commercial 
bank in Bangladesh under a foreign aided project against the 
specific project.  
Counterpart  funds  are  assessed  based  on  the  approved 
ADP  and  are  usually  released  in  4  quarterly  installments

made  through  the  Finance  Division  of  the  MOF  into  the 
Central  Account  of  BWDB.  BWDB  submits  requests  for 
funds  to  the  Ministry  of  Finance  through  MOWR.  Payments 
of  GOB  counterpart  fund  are  disbursed  by  the  MOF  in  4 
quarterly  installments  through  the  Central  Account  of  the 
BWDB. Payments for the project will be done various RACs. 
Fund flow arrangements are further described in paras. 35 to 
47 below and are deemed adequate for the project. 
BWDB’s  finance  and  accounting  operations  are  headed  by 
ADG  (Finance).  There  is  a  comptroller  of  Finance  and 
Account  who  is  in  charge  of  two  directors  -  Directors  of 
Finance  and  Director  of  Accounts.  Director  of  Audit  reports 
directly to the ADG (Finance).  
Currently  under  the  ADG  (Finance),  there  is  a  sanctioned 
headcount of 220 against the current staff of 168 positions or 
about 24% staff shortage.

therefore required. Staff rotation occurs every few years.

Accordingly, 
The  existing  BWDB  shall  also  ensure  that  a  permanent 
Finance  staff  is  assigned  to  the  project.  The  existing  PMO 
has  one  permanent  accounting  officer  deputed  from  ADG 
(Finance),  and  he  is  planned  to  be  continued  for  the 
additional

arrangements  are  considered  adequate.  However,  as  there 
is possibility of his transfer during the project, regular training 
and  staffing  monitoring  needs  to  be  continued  during  the 
project.  
The accounting system adopted by BWDB allows for proper 
recording  of  all  project  financial  transactions  based  on  an 
entity accounting system. The control mechanism are guided 
by  BWDB  financial  procedure  and  other  administrative  and 
government  manuals  which  stipulate  the  payment  and 
disbursement  approval  process;  and 
the 
codes.  The  prescribed

these 
government  accounting  codes  specify  how  all 
transactions  should  be  followed  and  recorded  by 
the 
accounting department. The Chart of Accounts shows that it 
is adequate to record and report on project activities and its 
disbursement  categories,  and  meets  the  requirements  of 
IMED.    The  Chart  of  Account  is  also  consistent  with  the 
government  prescribed  economic  and 
financial  code, 
universal  to  all  government  offices.  BWDB  has  adopted  a 
Cash  Basis  of  Accounting.  Its  accounting  policies  and 
procedures  are  guided  by  a  few  written  procedure  manuals

The  current  project  demonstrated  sound  performance  of 
auditing  and  reporting.  It  has  complied  with  the  preparation 
and  submission  of  audit  reports  every  year  since  2006-07. 
No Serious Financial Irregularities (SFI) were identified in the 
audit  reports,  21  out  of  22  non-SFI  audit  observations  have 
been  sorted  out  with  letters  to  certify  settlement  from 
FAPAD. PMO has replied to the recent remaining one, and it 
is being reviewed at FAPAD.  
The  current  project  developed  an  MIS,  including  a  financial 
module. Though it needs improvement, project level financial 
records  have  been  recorded  electrically.  However,  the 
project  MIS  is  not  integrated  in  the  entity-level  accounting 
system.  Currently,  BWDB’s  accounting  system  software 
uses  a  2006  version  of  MS  Great  Plains  Dynamic 
Accounting Software. This system is not fully integrated with 
the  project  accounting  system  at  the  RAC  level  and  most 
information  transmitted  is  via  email  and  external  memory 
devises  like  thumb  drive  raising  issues  of  sensitive  data 
security. Improvements to BWDB’s ICT system are currently 
being undertaken by WB under their WMIP program.

projects. The existing PMO has demonstrated sound financial management performance, and it 
will  continue  the  implementation  of  the  additional  financing  project.  Neverthless,  close 
monitoring  of  the financial  management  of  the  project  will  be  continued.  The following  actions 
will be undertaken.  
(i) 
(ii) 
PMO  key  staff  will  receive  training  on  ADB’s  procurement  and  financial 
management,  project  management,  and  reporting  procedures  to  refresh  and 
further  strengthen  their  capacity.  A  dedicated  full-time  financial  accountant, 
preferably  the  continuation  of  the  existing  PMO  staff,  must  be  assigned  to  the 
project.  
The  management  information  system  (MIS)  will  be  improved  during  the 
implementation  of  the  project  to  monitor  the  project  progress,  including  the 
financial progress, and project impacts, including benefits. MIS development has 
been  initiated  under  the  current  project.  The  improved  MIS  will  become  fully 
operational by 17 December 2017.

A  Statement  of  Audit  Needs  will  be  provided  to  BWDB  and  communicated  to 
FAPAD to ensure that ADBs audit requirements are met. 
B.
Disbursement 
35. 
The  loan  proceeds  and  ADB  administered  co-financier  funds  will  be  disbursed  in 
accordance  with  ADB’s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook,17  and  detailed  arrangements  agreed 
upon  between  the  Government  and  ADB.  Online  training  for  project  staff  on  disbursement 
policies  and  procedures  is  available  at:  http:wpqr4.adb.org/disbursement_elearning.  Project 
staff is encouraged to avail of this training.  
Types  of  Disbursement  Arrangements.  The 
36. 
types  of 
disbursement may be used: (i) direct payment, (ii) commitment procedure,  (iii) reimbursement, 
and  (iv)  imprest  fund.  Details  of  disbursement  procedures  are  described  in  ADB’s  Loan 
Disbursement Handbook (refer to footnote 7).  
four  major 
following 
Institutional  Responsibility.  BWDB  will  be  responsible  for  (i)  preparing  disbursement 
37. 
projections, (ii) requesting budgetary allocations for counterpart funds, (iii) collecting supporting 
documents, and (iv) preparing and sending withdrawal applications to ADB. The government will 
make funds available to BWDB through budgetary allocation.  
38. 
Imprest fund procedure.  Separate imprest accounts for BWDB should be established 
and maintained for each financing source, namely for the ADB loan and the Netherlands grant.  
The  imprest  accounts  are  to  be  used  exclusively  for  ADB’s  and  Netherlands’  funds  share  of 
eligible expenditures. BWDB is accountable and responsible for proper use of advances to the 
imprest accounts.  
(i) 
(ii) 
ADB  Loan  Imprest  Account.  BWDB  will  establish  and  manage  an  imprest 
account  in  a  US  dollar  at  the  Bangladesh  Bank  or  any  other  commercial  bank 
nominated  by  the  Bangladesh  Bank  or  Ministry  of  Finance  and  acceptable  to 
ADB.  
Netherlands Grant  Imprest  Account.  The  Government  of the  Netherlands  will 
deposit  funds  to  ADB  for  administration  as  jointly  cofinanced  fund.  BWDB  will 
establish and manage a separate imprest account in US dollar at the Bangladesh 
Bank  or  any  other  commercial  bank  nominated  by  the  Bangladesh  Bank  or 
Ministry of Finance and acceptable to ADB. 
39. 
The total outstanding advance to the imprest accounts should not exceed the estimate of 
ADB’s  or  co-financer’s  share  of  expenditures  to  be  paid  through  the  imprest  accounts  for  the 
forthcoming six (6) months. BWDB may request for initial and additional advances to the imprest 
accounts based on an Estimate of Expenditure Sheet18 setting out the estimated expenditures 
to  be  financed  through  the  accounts  for  the  forthcoming  six  (6)  months.    The  request  of  the 
initial  advance  to  the  imprest  accounts  should  be  accompanied  with  evidences  satisfactory  to 
ADB that the imprest accounts have been duly opened.

be used.  
28 
Supporting documents should be submitted to ADB or retained by BWDB in accordance 
40. 
with  ADB’s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  when  liquidating  or  replenishing  the  imprest 
accounts. 
Other  notes  on  disbursement  procedures.  Separate  sub-account(s)  may  be 
41. 
established  and  maintained  by  BWDB  for  each  funding  source.  The  sub-account(s)  is  to  be 
used  exclusively  for  ADB’s  and/or  co-financer  funds  share  of  eligible  expenditures.  BWDB 
should  ensure  that  every  liquidation  and  replenishment  of  each  subaccount  is  supported  by 
sufficient  documentation  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  when 
liquidating or replenishing the imprest accounts.  
42. 
Before  the  submission  of  the  first  withdrawal  application  or  the  request  of  the  initial 
advance  to  the  imprest  accounts,  BWDB  should  submit  to  ADB  sufficient  evidence  of  the 
authority  of  the  person(s)  who  will  sign  the  withdrawal  applications  on  behalf  of  the  borrower, 
together with the authenticated specimen signatures of each authorized person.   
43.  Withdrawal  application  forms  and  other  loan  financial  information  can  also  be 
downloaded from ADB's Loan Financial Information System (LFIS) at  http://lfis.adb.org. BWDB 
can request access to the LFIS from this site or by sending an e-mail to Ifis@adb.org. 
ADB's  Statement-of  expenditure  (SOE)  procedure  may  be  used  for  reimbursement  of 
44. 
eligible expenditures or liquidation of advances to imprest accounts. Supporting documents and 
records  for  the  expenditures  claimed  under  the  SOE  should  be  maintained  and  made  readily 
available  for  review  by  ADB's  disbursement  and  review  mission  or  upon  ADB's  request  for 
submission of supporting documents, and for independent audit.19 
45. 
The  minimum  value  per  withdrawal  application  is  US$100,000  equivalent.  Individual 
payments  below  this  amount  should  be  paid  by  BWDB  and  subsequently  claimed  to  ADB  (i) 
through  reimbursement;  or  (ii)  from  the  imprest/sub-accounts,  unless  otherwise  accepted  by 
ADB. 
46. 
The  following  control  mechanisms  will  be  applied  for  payment  of  resettlement  costs 
when  ADB’s  financing  is  used:  (i)  a  bank  account  of  RAC  (Regional  Accounting  Centre)  of 
BWDB will receive advances from the sub-account (i.e., Project Account) for the ADB loan; (ii) 
RAC  will  use  the  cheque  payment  from  the  RAC's  bank  account  for  the  resettlement 
compensation  costs  to  affected  people;  (iii)  Cheques  will  be  signed  by  RAC,  and  will  be 
distributed by RAC with the support of SMOs and the resettlement plan implementation NGOs; 
(iv)  RAC  will  make  payments  based  on  supporting  documents  to  evidence  genuine  payees, 
such as photographs of resettlers and with exchange of receipt with a finger print of a resettler 
which  will  be  retained  by  RAC;  (v)  RAC’s  bank  account  will  be  replenished  from  PMO’s  Sub-
Account for the ADB loan; and (vi) The SOE, for liquidation and replenishment of advances from 
ADB loan, will be prepared by RAC with support of SMOs and NGOs, and submitted to PMO of 
BWDB for attaching to withdrawal applications.   
Disbursement  arrangements  for  counterpart  fund.  All  disbursements  under 
47. 
government  financing  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  regulations  of  Government  of 
Bangladesh  relevant  to  co-financing  of  the  projects  financed  by  the  multilateral  financing 
organizations.  BWDB  shall  open  and  maintain  the  separate  account  for  government’s 
counterpart funds. 
19  Checklist for SOE procedures and formats are available in the Loan Disbursement Handbook.

C.
Auditing Arrangement and Public Disclosure  
48. 
BWDB will maintain, or cause to be maintained, separate books and records by funding 
source  for  all  expenditures  incurred  on  the  project.  BWDB  will  prepare  project  financial 
statements  in  accordance  with  the  government  of  Bangladesh's  accounting  laws  and 
regulations which are  consistent  with international  accounting  principles  and practices.  Project 
financial  statements  shall  include  at  a  minimum,  a  statement  of  receipts  and  payments  with 
accompanying notes and schedules. These shall be prepared to ensure maximum alignment to 
international accounting standards and Government of Bangladesh Financial Regulations. 
49. 
BWDB  will  cause  the  project  financial  statements  to  be  audited  in  accordance  with 
International Standards on Auditing by an auditor acceptable to ADB. BWDB will submit audited 
financial  statements  in  the  English  language  to  ADB  within  6  months  of  the  end  of  the  fiscal 
year.  The  annual  audit  report  for  the  project  financial  statements  will  include  a  management 
letter and audit opinions which cover (i) whether the project financial statements present a true 
and fair view or are presented fairly, in all material respects, in accordance with the applicable 
financial reporting framework; (ii) whether loan proceeds were used only for the purposes of the 
project  or  not;  (iii)  the  level  of  compliance  for  each  financial  covenant  contained  in  the  legal 
agreements for the project; (iv) use of the imprest fund procedure; and (v) the use of the  SOE 
procedure certifying to the eligibility of those expenditures claimed under SOE procedures, and 
proper use of the SOE and imprest procedures in accordance with ADB’s  Loan Disbursement 
Handbook and the project documents. 
 BWDB will also cause the entity-level financial statements to be audited in accordance 
50. 
with  International  Standards  on  Auditing  and  with  the  Government's  audit  regulations,  by  an 
independent auditor acceptable to ADB. The audited entity-level financial statements, together 
with  the  auditors’  report  and  management  letter,  will  be  submitted  in  the  English  language  to 
ADB within one month after their approval by the competent authority. 
51. 
Public  disclosure  of  the  project  financial  statements,  including  the  audit  report  on  the 
project  financial  statements,  will  be  guided  by  ADB’s  Public  Communications  Policy  (2011). 
ADB will disclose the project financial statements for the project and the opinion of the auditors 
on the financial statements within 30 days of the date of their receipt by posting them on ADB’s 
website. The entity level financial statements and the management letter will not be disclosed.  
The  Government  and  BWDB  have  been  made  aware  of  ADB’s  approach  on  delayed 
52. 
submission, and the requirements for satisfactory and acceptable quality of the audited project 
financial  statements.20  ADB  reserves the right to require a change in the auditor  (in a manner 
consistent with the constitution of the borrower), or for additional support to be provided to the 
20  ADB approach on delayed submission of audited project financial statements:  
•  When audited project financial statements are not received by the due date, ADB will write to the executing agency 
advising  that  (i)  the  audit  documents  are  overdue;  and  (ii)  if  they  are  not  received  within  the  next  six  months, 
requests for new contract awards and disbursement such as new replenishment of imprest accounts, processing of 
new reimbursement, and issuance of new commitment letters will not be processed. 
•  When  audited  project  financial  statements  have  not  been  received  within  6  months  after  the  due  date,  ADB  will 
withhold processing of requests for new contract awards and disbursement such as new replenishment of imprest 
accounts,  processing  of  new  reimbursement,  and  issuance  of  new  commitment  letters.  ADB  will  (i)  inform  the 
executing agency of ADB’s actions; and (ii) advise that the loan may be suspended if the audit documents are not 
received within the next six months. 
•  When audited project financial statements have not been received within 12 months after the due date, ADB may 
suspend the loan. 
30 
auditor, if the audits required are not conducted in a manner satisfactory to ADB, or if the audits 
are  substantially  delayed.  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  verify  the  project's  financial  accounts  to 
confirm  that  the  share  of  ADB’s  financing  is  used  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  policies  and 
procedures. 
53. 
A formal request for the project to be included in the FAPAD audit schedule should be 
sent to FAPAD office. This request is best sent when the loan, grant and project agreements are 
signed,  and  the  request  should  include  a  copy  of  the  loan  and  project  agreements,  and  any 
other relevant documents. FAPAD would then advise the appropriate field office to include the 
project in its audit schedule 
54. 
In addition, to ensure that audited project financial statements are submitted on a timely 
basis,  BWDB  through  PMO  should  submit  its  project  financial  statements  for  audit  to  FAPAD 
within  3 months  from  the  close  of  the financial  year.  PMO  shall  be  responsible for  the  project 
financial statements. By 1 October of each year, FAPAD should receive the unaudited financial 
statements. It will then take 3 months to complete the audit, and issue an opinion no later than 6 
months from the end of the financial year. A statement of audit needs is provided in  Appendix 
3.

PROCUREMENT AND CONSULTING SERVICES 
A.
Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing 
All  advance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  will  be  undertaken  in  conformity  with 
55. 
ADB’s  Procurement  Guidelines21  and  ADB’s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.22  The 
issuance of invitations to bid under advance contracting and retroactive financing will be subject 
to  ADB  approval.  The  borrower  and  BWDB  have  been  advised  that  approval  of  advance 
contracting and retroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance the project. 
56. 
ADB  may,  subject  to  its  policies  and  procedures,  allow  upon  request  (a)  advance 
contracting and (b) retroactive financing of eligible expenditures for up to 20% of the proposed 
loan and cofinancing grant, incurred prior to loan and grant effectiveness but not earlier than 12 
months before the date of signing of the related legal agreements. Eligible items of the advance 
contracting  and  retroactive  financing  are  recruitment  of  consultants,  project  management 
including contract-based PMO staffs and mobilizers, and procurement of goods and works.  
57. 
The following table summarizes target timeframe of advanced recruitment actions for the 
institutional  strengthening  and  project  management  consultant  package.  Other  advanced 
actions will cover procurement of vehicles, motorcycles and office equipment and recruitment of 
contract-based PMO staff, including mobilizers.  
B.
Procurement of Goods, Works and Consulting Services 
All  procurement  of  goods  and  works  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB’s 
58. 
Procurement  Guidelines.  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  disallow  utilization  of  loan  proceeds  if  it  is 
unable to agree  with  the  recommendation  with BWDB  on  either  the  bidding  documents  or  bid 
evaluation reports. An 18-month procurement plan indicating threshold and review procedures, 
goods,  works,  and  consulting  service  contract  packages  and  national  competitive  bidding 
guidelines  is  Appendix  4.  As  this  project  will  be  financed  by  ADF  resources  with  ADB-

under the project.23 The procurement capacity assessment of BWDB is in Appedix 9.  
59. 
Procurement of goods and works. The same types of works that are conducted under 
the current project will be included in the additional financing. International competitive bidding 
(ICB),  if  any,  will  be  followed  for  civil  work  contracts  costing  $15  million  or  more,  to  ensure 
competition. National competitive bidding (NCB) will be applied for civil works contracts costing 
less  than  $15  million.  For  procurement  of  goods  and  related  services,  ICB  procedures  will  be 
used if the estimated cost is $2 million or more, and NCB if the estimated cost is less than $2 
million.  Shopping  could  be  used  for  goods  and  works,  if  the  estimated  cost  is  less  than  $0.1 
million.  All  civil  works  packages  under  the  project  will  be  small  packages  for  construction  or 
rehabilitation  of  rather  minor  structures.  No  package  under  the  project  will  apply  the 
prequalification. ADB’s standard bid documents for single stage – one envelope system will be 
used.  
60. 
For all ICB contracts for works and goods, ADB will conduct prior review in accordance 
with  the  procedures  explained  in  PAI  3.02  and  3.03.  BWDB  will  submit  to  ADB  procurement 
documents,  such  as  draft  bid  documents,  bid  evaluation  reports,  and  draft  contracts,  at  every 
stage of the procurement for each contract packages, and seek ADB’s prior concurrence.  
For NCB contracts for goods, ADB will conduct prior review for the first package. BWDB 
61. 
will seek ADB’s prior concurrence at every stage of the procurement procedures, as described 
in para 60.  The  subsequent  packages  will  use  the  corresponding  approved  bid documents  as 
master  bidding  documents.  For  the  subsequent  packages,  ADB  will  conduct  post  review  in 
accordance  with  the  procedures  explained  in  PAI  3.02  and  3.05  in  principle,  but  BWDB  is 
requested  to  submit  documents  at  each  stage  of  the  procurement,  instead  of  sending  all 
documents  after  awarding.  BWDB  should  forward  a  copy  of  the  bidding  documents  to  ADB 
immediately after release of the invitation of bid (IFB) for each contract package, and ADB will 
conduct  post  review  of  each  package.  BWDB  may  be  required  to  issue  addenda/addendum 
based on comments from ADB (if any), before bid submission. Other procurement documents, 
such as bid evaluation reports and signed contracts should also be submitted to ADB as soon 
as they become available, for ADB’s post review.  
62. 
For  NCB  contracts  for  works  with  the  estimated  cost  of  $1,000,000  or  more,  ADB  will 
conduct prior review for the first package of each type of works, and will conduct post review for 
the  subsequent  packages,  following  the  same  procedures  for  NCB  goods  procurement  as 
descrived in para. 61.   
63. 
For  NCB  contracts  for  works  with  the  estimated  cost  less  than  $1,000,000,  ADB  will 
conduct  prior  review  for  the  first  package  of  each  type  of  works  if  there  is  no  previous  prior 
approval for similar works packages of $1,000,000. BWDB will seek ADB’s prior concurrence at 
every stage of the procurement procedures, as described in para 60. The subsequent packages 
will  use  the  corresponding  approved  bid  documents  as  master  bidding  documents.  For  the 
subsequent  packages,  ADB  will  conduct  post  review  in  accordance  with  the  procedures 
explained  in  PAI  3.02.  The  post  review  (sampling)  with  the  procedures  explained  in  PAI  3.02 
may be applied for packages up to certian amount subject to ADB’s approval.24 All documents,

including  IFB,  bid  documents,  bid  evaluation  reports  and  signed  contracts  should  also  be 
submitted  to  ADB  as  soon  as  they  become  available,  for  ADB’s  post  review  or  post  review 
(sampling). 
For  shopping  for  goods,  ADB  will  conduct  prior  review  for  the  first  package,  and  will 
64. 
conduct post review for the subsequet packages, following the same procedures for NCB goods 
procurement for the second and subsequent packages as described in para. 61.  
For shopping for works, ADB will conduct prior review for the first package of similar type 
65. 
of works, and will conduct post review or post review (sampling) for the subsequent packages, 
following the same procedures as described in para. 63.  
The  community  participation  modality  will  be  applied  to  simple  and  small  earth  works 
66. 
packages,  such  as  re-excavation  of  small  khals  (small  streams)  and  minor  embankment  re-
sectioning.  The  community  participation  modality  shall  not  be  used  for  contracts  worth  higher 
than $10,000 equivalent, however the application of this modality will be decided depending on 
the nature and scale of each works package, which should be acceptable to ADB. BWDB will 
award  a  contract  to  a  labor  contracting  society  that  will  be  organized  under  a  water 
management  organization.  Awarding  of  community  contracts to  the  labor  contracting  societies 
will be done in accordance with PAI 5.10. ADB will review the award of the contract on a post 
review  basis  to  ensure  that  the  following  information  are  accurately  indicated  in  the  contract: 
work  schedule,  responsibilities  of  SMO  and  the  labor  contracting  society  in  monitoring  and 
inspecting  progress  and  quality  of  works,  payment  procedures  and  terms,  and  grounds  for 
contract termination.  
If, through its post review and post review (sampling), the ADB determines that an action 
67. 
by a borrower amounted to misprocurement, it will declare misprocurement. 
Consulting  services.  All  consultants,  NGOs,  and  other  institutions  will  be  recruited 
68. 
according to ADB’s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.25 The outline terms of reference for 
consulting services are in Section C below and Appendix 5.  
The  project  provides  a  consultancy  package  for  institutional  strengthening  and  project 
69. 
management  consultants  (ISPMC).  Other  consultancy  recruitment  includes  small  surveys  and 
supporting services, as indicated in para. 70 below.  
ISMPC will be selected using ADB’s quality- and cost-based selection (QCBS) modality 
70. 
with  a  quality  to  cost  ratio  of  90:10  as  the  package  requires  adequate  knowledge  and 
experience in participatory water resources planning and management. Other rather small-size 
consulting/NGO  services  will  be  engaged  through  consultant  qualification  selection  (CQS) 
modality, as indicated in the procurement plan.

SAFEGUARDS 
81. 
BWDB  will  ensure  that  all  the  requirements  prescribed  in  the  (i)  initial  environmental 
examination  (IEE),26  (ii)  resettlement  framework  (RF),  and  (iii)  resettlement  plans  (RP)  will  be 
complied with during the preparation and implementation of the project. 
Pursuant  to  ADB's  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  2009  (SPS),  ADB  will  not  reimburse 
82. 
expenditure incurred on any activities listed in in the ADB’s Prohibited Investment Activities List 
set forth in Appendix 5 of the SPS. 
BWDB  will  ensure  that  all  investments  are  in  compliance  with  applicable  national  laws 
83. 
and regulations, and ADB’s SPS. 
A.  
Environment Safeguards 
84. 
The project is categorized a “red” project under the government regulation and therefore, 
an EIA was prepared and approved by the Department of Environment (DOE). Under the ADB’s 
SPS,  the  project  is  categorized  “B”.  The  government’s  EIA  is  equivalent  to  IEE  under  ADB’s 
SPS. An IEE was prepared in accordance with the government and ADB’s SPS requirements.  
The IEE includes the environmental management plan (EMP) and its monitoring plan. PMO with 
the  support  of  the  ISMPC  team  and  in  consultation  with  SMOs  will  be  responsible  for 
implementing  IEE  and  its  EMP  and  monitoring  plan.  PMO  will  be  assisted  by  environment 
experts in the ISPMC team. To ensure the implementation of IEE and its EMP and monitoring 
plan, the following actions need to be undertaken by PMO: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
(v) 
(vi) 
(vii) 
Obtain environmental clearance from DOE, and extract all DOE requirements for 
implementing the project prior to awarding any civil work contract. 
Ensure  that  all  bidding  and  contract  documents  for  civil  works  include  all  the 
requirement  from  DOE  as  part  of  environmental  clearance  and  requirement 
described in the IEE and its EMP. 
Ensure  that  the  environmental  specialist  from  the  ISMPC  team  will  conduct  a 
training to guide the contractors in preparing appropriate site management plan 
and monitoring plan.  
Ensure  that  the  environmental  specialist  from  the  ISMPC  team  will  develop 
generic monitoring plan appropriate for the project. 
Ensure that contractor submit the site management plan prior to commencement 
of civil works. 
Ensure that ISMPC review and approve the site management plan. 
Ensure that ISMPC monitor the implementation of mitigation measures and EMP 
(including the implementation of health and safety requirement for their workers) 
that  translated  into  site  management  plan  by  the  contractor,  and  report  the 
implementation  of  IEE  and  its  EMP  as  part  of  the  project  quarterly  progress 
report. 
(viii)  Ensure that the environmental consultant visits the project areas where there is 
an  on-going  construction  to  equip  him/her  in  preparing  annual  report  on  the 
implementation of IEE and its EMP to be submitted to ADB. 
Ensure that any un-expected impacts are properly and timely mitigated. 
(ix) 
26 The executing agency prepared an environmental impact assessment (EIA) for the nine subprojects to meet the 
government’s  requirements,  and  the  EIA  was  approved  by  the  Department  of  Environment  (DOE).  The 
government’s  EIA  is  considered  to  be  the  IEE,  and  it  meets  ADB’s  category  B  project  for  the  environment 
safeguard.  
40 
(x) 
Any  complaint  and  grievance  related  with  environmental  impacts  should  be 
resolve through its grievance redress mechanism (GRM) and reported to ADB in 
a timely manner.      
B.  
Social Safeguards 
85. 
Involuntary  resettlement.  The  project  is  categorized  B.  In  the  Alfadanga-Boalmari 
subproject area, 1.5 km of new embankment will be constructed for the restoration of washed-
away  portion,  and will  require  about  2.74  hectares  (ha).  A  resettlement  plan  was  prepared for 
1.5  km  of  the  new  embankment  construction.  The  other  rehabilitation  and  construction  works 
will be done within the Right of Way or locations where no land acquisition is involved. However, 
the  precise  locations  of  the  rehabilitation  and  re-sectioning  of  existing  embankments  will  be 
determined  during  the  project  implementation  through  the  beneficiary  participatory  planning 
procedures,  and  will  be  based  on  walkthrough  surveys  with  WMOs.  There  is  a  possibility  of 
involuntary  resettlement  due  to  rehabilitation  and  re-sectioning  works  depending  on  the 
locations  of  works,  while  the  works  locations  will  be  selected  to  mitigate  involuntary 
resettlement.  As  a  prudent  measure,  a  resettlement  framework  was  prepared,  in  accordance 
with  the  government’s  laws  and  regulations  and  ADB’s  SPS,  should  any  involuntary 
resettlement-related issue arise.  
The  resettlement  framework  and  resettlement  plan  that  have  been  agreed  by  the 
86. 
executing  agency  will  be  implemented  by  PMO,  with  the  support  of  the  ISMPC  team  and  in 
consultation with SMOs. The ISPMC will include resettlement specialists who will be engaged in 
intermittent  basis  until  the  implementation  of  resettlement  plans  is  completed.  To  ensure  the 
implementation of resettlement plans , the following actions will need to be carried out by PMO: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
Continue  the  existing  GRM  under  the  current  project  at  PMO  level  and  at  the 
subproject level in close coordination with local authorities. 
For  the  implementation  of  resettlement  plans,  PMO  will  check  whether  there  is 
any  change  on  the  detailed  design  that  changes  the  impact  on  involuntary 
resettlement.  If  there  is  no  change,  PMO  will  inform  ADB  that  no  updated 
resettlement  plan  will  be  required.  PMO  will  work  closely  with  local  authority  to 
implement  the  resettlement  plan:  (1)  making  full  payment  of  compensation  to 
project-affected peoples (PAPs), who opt for a compensation, (2) obtaining paper 
work on transferring land to the local authority from PAPs who opt donating their 
lands for the project, (3) keeping and maintaining all the records for (1) and (2), 
and  submit  the  report  to  ADB  on  resettlement  plan  implementation  through 
resettlement  plan 
quarterly  project  progress  report,  and  (4)  submitting 
implementation 
resettlement  plan 
the 
report 
implementation for Alfadanga-Boalmari. 
If the resettlement plan for Alfadanga-Boalmari needs to be updated in line with 
detailed design, the updated resettlement plan needs to be prepared by following 
the  principles  described  in  the  resettlement  framework,  and  to  be  submitted  to 
ADB  for  review  and  approval  prior  to  awarding  the  civil  work  contract.  The 
updated  resettlement  plan  will  need  to  be  implemented  by  following  actions 
described in (ii) above. 
After  completing  the  design  and  plan  for  each  subproject  (each  embankment), 
the  due  diligence  by  following  the  resettlement  framework  and  using  the 
screening  checklist  will  be  carried  out  to  check  whether  any  of  the  subprojects 
will  involve  involuntary  resettlement  or/and  land  acquisition.  If  there  is  no 
involuntary  resettlement  or  land  acquisition,  the  brief  due  diligence  report  on 
to  ADB  after  completing 
41 
(v) 
(vi) 
involuntary  resettlement  should  be  submitted  to  ADB  prior  to  awarding  a  civil 
work contract. 
If any of the subprojects will involve involuntary resettlement, a resettlement plan 
for  the  particular  subproject  needs  to  be  prepared  in  accordance  with  the 
resettlment framework. the resettlement plan will need to be submitted to ADB for 
review  and  approval  prior  to  awarding  civil  work  contract  for  the  particular 
subproject.  The  resettlement  plan  needs  to  be  implemented  by  following  steps 
described in (ii) above.  
All the progress reports on the implementation of resettlement plans and also the 
report on completion of resettlement plan implementation should include report in 
the GRM activities. 
(vii)  During  the  project  implementation,  any  grievance  or  complaint  submitted  by 
PAPs has to be resolved in accordance with the agreed procedure described in 
the GRM, and should be recorded and reported to ADB immediately by email or 
by other means.  
(viii)  Ensure  that  PMO’s  resettlement  specialist  is  in  close  coordination  with  local 
authorities, and site engineers shall conduct routinely consultations with PAPs to 
ensure PAPs are well informed about their rights if their property will be taken for 
the project. 
Ensure that the resettlement framework and resettlement plans will be translated 
into Bengali, and will be made available to be accessed by the PAPs.   
(ix) 
87. 
Indigenous  peoples.  There  are  no  indigenous  peoples  as  defined  for  operational 
purposes  by  ADB’s  SPS  in  the  project.  Therefore,  no  action  is  required  to  be  undertaken  by 
PMO.   
VIII.  GENDER AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS 
Social  development  and  poverty  reduction.  The  project  will  provide  a  more  stable 
88. 
environment  with  improved  water  management  and  strengthened  livelihood  improvement 
capacity of beneficiaries, while providing income generation during the construction of the civil 
works,  which  potentially  provides  higher  opportunity  for  future  income  generation.27  It  is 
expected that the project will have positive impacts on the poverty reduction and food security of 
the poor. Despite good progress in recent years, Bangladesh remains under difficult economic 
situation with an annual per capita gross national income of $1,010 (in 2013), and with 31.5% of 
its population living below poverty line.28 Over 80% of the poor in rural areas, and most of them 
are  engaged  in  agriculture,  nonfarm  related  activities,  and  fisheries.  PMO  will  establish  a 
monitoring  system  to  document  the  project’s  impact  on  poverty  reduction  caused  by 
improvement on efficient water use that is the key to the poverty reduction in the project area.  
The  project  will  be  implemented  with  high  participation  of  stakeholders  in  decision 
89. 
making.  The  empowerment  of  the  poor  and  women,  including  income  generation,  livelihood 
improvement, and the inclusion of the socially weak like tenant farmers and share-croppers are 
built  into  the  project  design.  The  specific  strategy  includes  (i)  pro-poor  procedures  for 
beneficially  selection  and  employment;  (ii)  inclusive  membership  access  to  WMOs;  (iii)  WMO 
participation 
inclusive 
comprehensive capacity development program for WMOs for water management and livelihood 
implementing  and  monitoring;  and  (iv)  an

90. 
Gender  actions.  The  project  is  classified  gender  equity  theme.  A  gender  action  plan 
(GAP)  has  been  prepared  for  the  project  with  clear  targets  and  responsibilities.29  Women  will 
benefit from (i) being a member of management committee of WMOs, with a minimum  33% of 
female members; (ii) receiving training in agriculture, livestock, postharvest processing, fisheries 
production,  or  other  water  management  and  livelihood  improvement  matters  depending  on 
beneficiaries’  practical  and  strategic  needs;  and (iii)  employment  opportunities for  construction 
and  O&M  works.  PMO  will  ensure  establishing  an  MIS  system  with  sex-disaggregated  data 
collection, gender based analysis, and review and reporting on the implementation of the GAP 
in all reports. The GAP for project activities under the additional financing is in  Table 8.1. The 
progress in implementing the GAP will be reported regularly through quarterly project progress 
report. 
91. 
Labor,  health,  and  social  protection.  BWDB  will  ensure  that  the  contractors,  sub-
contractors, and suppliers for the project follow all applicable labor laws of the government. The 
contractors and their sub-contractors will be further required to include provisions to (i) carry out 
HIV/AIDS  awareness  programs  for  labor  and  disseminate  information  at  worksites  on  risks  of 
sexually  transmitted  diseases  and  HIV/AIDS  as  part  of  health  and  safety  measures  for  those 
employed  during  construction;  (ii)  avoid  employing  children  and  forced  labor;  (iii)  open  an 
opportunity  to  employ  females,  (iv)  ensure  equal  pay  for  equal  work  for  male  and  female 
laborers;  and (v)  adopt  a good practice as well  as follow  legally  mandated  provisions  of  labor 
health, safety, sanitation, welfare and working conditions. PMO will ensure that contracts shall 
also include clauses for termination in case of any breach of these provisions by contractors and 
its  sub-contractors.  Further,  PMO  will  report  in  its  quarterly  project  progress  report  the 
implementation of contractors’ compliance with applicable labor law at the minimal to cover the 
above requirements.

Monitoring Requirements 
92. 
Project  performance  monitoring:  PMO  has  an  MIS  which  will  consist  of  the  project 
management  and  O&M  modules,  and  the  MIS  will  be  further  improved  during  the  proposed 
project.  The  project  management  module  of  the  MIS  will  include  a  benefit  monitoring  function 
using  targets,  indicators,  assumptions,  and  risks  in  the  project  DMF.  The  baseline  data  for 
indicators and targets set out in the DMF were collected during the PPTA and will be stored in 
the  MIS.  Data  indicators  for  subsequent  years  will  be  input  annually  in  the  MIS.  The  project 
management  consultant  will  support  the  PMO  in  monitoring  performance.  The  financial  and 
physical progress will be recorded in the project management module of the MIS.30  
93. 
Compliance  monitoring:  Status  of  compliance  with  assurances,  conditions  and  loan 
covenants—policy,  legal,  financial,  economic,  environmental,  and  others—  will  be  reviewed  at 
each  ADB  review  mission.  All  non-compliance  issues,  if  any,  will  be  updated  in  quarterly 
progress  reports  together  with  remedial  actions.  PMO  will  include  status  of  compliance  in 
quarterly progress reports.  
94. 
Safeguards monitoring: Monitoring of social safeguards especially the implementation 
of  the  resettlement  plan(s)  will  be  reported through the quarterly  project progress  reports,  and 
semi-annual reports will be submitted to ADB as stand-alone report. 
95. 
The  monitoring  of  environmental  safeguard  especially  for  EMP  implementation  will  be 
reported through the quarterly project progress reports, and annual reports will be submitted to 
ADB as stand-alone report.  
96. 
Gender  and  social  dimensions  monitoring:  The  GAP  will  be  implemented  and 
monitored by BWDB. The status of the implementation of the GAP will be reported in BWDB’s 
quarterly  progress  report  that  will  be  submitted  to  ADB.  The  status  will  also  be  discussed  at 
each ADB review mission, including a mid-term review mission.31 
C.
Evaluation 
97.  Within  3  years  after  the  effectiveness,  ADB  will  conduct  a  mid-term  review  to  identify 
problems  and  constraints  encountered  and  suggested  measures  to  address  them,  including 
appropriateness  of  scopes,  design,  implementation  arrangements,  implementation  schedule, 
compliance with safeguards and other covenants.  
98.  Within  6  months  of  physical  completion  of  the  project,  BWDB  will  submit  a  project 
completion report to ADB.32

D.
Reporting Requirements 
99. 
PMO  under  BWDB  will  provide  ADB  with  (i)  quarterly  progress  reports  in  a  format 
consistent  with  ADB's  project  performance  reporting  system;  (ii)  annual  reports  including  (a) 
progress achieved by output as measured through the indicator's performance targets, (b) key 
implementation  issues  and  solutions;  (c)  updated  procurement  plan  and  (d)  updated 
implementation plan for next 12 months; and (iii) a project completion report within 6 months of 
physical  completion  of  the  project.  To  ensure  projects  continue  to  be  both  viable  and 
sustainable,  project  accounts  and  the  executing  agency  audited  financial  statements, together 
with the associated auditor's report, should be adequately reviewed. 
100.  Project  progress  reports.  BWDB  will  prepare  progress  reports  and  submit  these  to 
ADB on a quarterly basis within 45 days from the end of each quarter (termed as semiannual 
report  and  annual  report  for  the  reporting  quarters  ending  June  and  December,  respectively). 
Each  report  will  provide  (i)  a  narrative  description  of  progress  made  during  the  period,  (ii) 
changes in the implementation schedule, (iii) problems or difficulties encountered, and (iv) work 
to be carried out in the next period. The progress reports will also include a summary of contract 
awards  and  disbursements,  project  expenditure  for  the  period  and  total  expenditure  of  the 
project  to  date,  contract  award  and  financing  plan  for  the  next  quarter,  financial  account  of 
SGIA, a quarterly monitoring report of the GAP implementation, and status of implementation of 
loan  covenants  including  environment  and  involuntary  resettlement  safeguard  requirements. 
Suggested contents of project progress reports are indicated in Appendix 6. 
101.  The project progress reports should include the assessment of physical progress. Each 
implementation activity carries certain weight and should be accounted for while computing the 
physical progress. Appendix 8 shows guidelines for computing physical progress of the project 
to be used both by BWDB and ADB for assessment during project implementation. A graph of 
anticipated overall physical and financial progress during the life of the project to help identifying 
the status of achievement of the targets and or underperformance is also shown.  
102.  Annual  projections  for  contract  award  and  disbursement.  BWDB  will  prepare 
annually the projections for contract awards and disbursements under the project with quarterly 
breakdown  for  one  calendar  year  ahead.  Separate  projections  for  the  ADB  loan  and  co-
financing grant have to be prepared. BWDB will submit the projections to ADB by 30 Novermber 
of each year using the prescribed templates.  
103.  Audited financial statements. BWDB will have its project financial statements audited 
annually, 
in  accordance  with  appropriate  auditing  standards  consistently  applied,  by 
independent  auditors  whose  qualifications,  experience  and  terms  of  reference  acceptable  to 
ADB; and (ii) furnish to ADB, as soon as available but in any event not later than 6 months after 
the end of each fiscal year, certified copies of such audited project financial statements and the 
report of the auditors relating thereto will include a separate audit opinion on the use of the loan 
and  grant  proceeds,  imprest  account  and  compliance  with  SOE  procedures  and  financial 
covenants. Refer to Section V for further details.  
E.
Stakeholder Communication Strategy  
104.  As  the  project  is  for  promoting  the  participatory  water  resources  planning  and 
management,  the  project  is  designed  for  stakeholder  involvement  and  communication.  The 
stakeholder  communication  strategy  has  been  built  into  the  design  of  the  entire  project,  from 
integrated  water  management  planning,  the  implementation,  and  operation  and  maintenance, 
51 
while no separate stakeholder communication strategy has been established. A key part of the 
project implementation strategy will be focusing on information sharing and consultation that will 
guide  communications  with  stakeholders  during  project  implementation.  Such  information 
sharing will help to build consensus and ensure continuous stakeholder support throughout the 
project implementation. 
105.  The  primary  audiences  for  the  communication  strategy  are  local  communities  in  the 
subproject areas, the general public (NGOs and development partners, key individual decision 
makers)  and  the  Government  and  authorities  (local  Upazila  administration,  institutions  and 
ministries). 
106.  The  communication  activities  will  include  door-to-door  awareness  campaigns,  public 
meetings,  publicity  programs  with  educational  institutes,  etc.  Stakeholder  consultations  have 
already  been  started  since  the  PPTA for  the  original  project  with  affected households,  elected 
local representatives and other stakeholders. Socio-economic survey and senses surveys were 
also  conducted  before  formulating  the  proposed  project.  Detailed  interventions,  including 
infrastructure  renovation,  and  capacity  development  support  for  WMOs,  will  be  determined 
based  on  discussions  with  WMOs.  After  making  the  plan,  the  proposed  interventions  will 
explained at  each proposed  subproject site. This  close  communication  with  local  stakeholders 
has been successfully implemented under the current project, and will be maintained during the 
implementation of the additional financing.  
52 
X. 
ANTICORRUPTION POLICY  
107.  ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any violations of the 
Anticorruption  Policy  relating  to  the  project.33  All  contracts  financed  by  ADB  shall  include 
provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the 
executing agency and all project contractors, suppliers, consultants and other service providers. 
Individuals/entities  on  ADB’s  anticorruption  debarment  list  are  ineligible  to  participate  in  ADB-
financed activity and may not be awarded any contracts under the project.34  
108.  To  support 
loan 
agreement/regulations  and  the  bidding  documents for  the  project. The following  measures  will 
be undertaken by BWDB to ensure integrity and transparency: 
relevant  provisions  are 
these  efforts, 
included 
the 
in 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
The  BWDB  will  post  the  physical  and  financial  details,  project  progress,  and 
business  opportunities  associated  with  the  project  in  the  project  website,  along 
with  (a)  the  following  information  in  relation  to  goods,  works  and  services 
procured  for  the  project:  (i)  the  list  of  participating  bidders,  (ii)  the  name  of  the 
winning  bidder,  (iii)  the  amount  of  the  contracts  awarded,  and  (iv)  the  goods, 
works and services procured; and (b) a copy of the five-year lease contracts with 
local community groups for participatory regular O&M. For individual subproject, 
the SMOs will post the abstract of all contracts executed, including the quantity of 
works and their associated costs. 
Through  the  mobilization  of  independent  auditor,  BWDB  will  undertake  annual 
financial audit for the project, including expenditures at all SMOs and associated 
offices, which will include investigation of all financial records and transactions. 
The  government,  through  independent  auditors  and  through  the  government’s 
Anticorruption  Commission,  shall  conduct periodic  inspections  and random  spot 
checks of civil servants’ and contractors’ activities related to the procurement of 
goods,  works  and  services  and  to  fund  withdrawals  and  settlements  under  the 
project.

ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISM 
110.  People  who are, or may in the future be, adversely affected by the project may submit 
complaints  to  ADB’s  Accountability  Mechanism.  The  Accountability  Mechanism  provides  an 
independent  forum  and  process  whereby  people  adversely  affected  by  ADB-assisted  projects 
can voice, and seek a resolution of their problems, as well as report alleged violations of ADB’s 
operational  policies  and  procedures.  Before  submitting  a  complaint  to  the  Accountability 
Mechanism, affected people should make a good faith effort to solve their problems by working 
with  the  concerned  ADB  operations  department.  Only  after  doing  that,  and  if  they  are  still 
dissatisfied, should they approach the Accountability Mechanism.35

A. 
The Project 
1. 
Background  
1. 
The southwest area of Bangladesh covers the south bank of the Ganges and the Lower 
Meghna rivers. Agriculture plays a dominant role in the region but productivity is lagging behind 
the  national  average  due  mainly  to  the  dominance  of  traditional  varieties  associated  with  the 
area’s  susceptibility  to  flooding,  and  slower  expansion  of  irrigation.  Of  particular  concern  is 
water shortage due to reduced inflow into the Ganges distributaries and associated social and 
environmental  hardships,  including  salinity  intrusion,  livelihood  loss,  and  environmental 
degradation. Other challenges include (i) the flood inflow from the Ganges in the monsoon (ii) 
deterioration  of  existing  flood  control  and  drainage/  irrigation  (FCD/I)  systems,  (iii)  drainage 
congestion  and  sedimentation  of  tidal  channels  caused  by  coastal  polder  construction  and 
reduced tidal swept volume, (iii) arsenic contamination that is the highest in the country, and (iv) 
vulnerability  to  cyclones  and  tidal  surges.  Improving  water  management  is  critically  needed  in 
this region.1

The  original  Loan  No.  2200  (SF)/  Grant  No.  0036  –  BAN:  Southwest  Integrated Water 
Resources Planning and Management Project is co-financed by ADB (for $20 million equivalent) 
and  the  Embassy  of  the  Kingdom  of  the  Netherlands  (EKN)  (for  $12.5  million).  The  original 
project was approved in November 2005, became effective in August 2006, and is scheduled to 
be closed in December 2015. It aims to enhance the productivity and sustainability of existing 
FCD/I schemes through integrated planning, infrastructure renovation, and coordinated support 
services,  with  establishing  water  management  organizations  (WMOs),  comprising  water 
management  groups  (WMGs)  and  their  higher  tier  water  management  associations  (WMAs). 
The  original  project  comprises  (i)  two  subprojects  –  Narail  and  Chenchuri  Beel  (57,000  ha), 
which were fully appraised prior to the project approval, and (ii) additional subprojects (43,000 
ha) that were to be appraised and implemented during the project period. In September 2009, 
the  project  fund  kept  for  the  implementation  of  additional  subprojects  was  substantially  re-
allocated to emergency rehabilitation of infrastructure damaged by the devastating cyclone that 
hit  the  country  in  May  2009.  The  original  project  also  conducted  a  pre-feasibility  study  of 
candidate additional subprojects in 2008, and feasibility studies for the selected seven additional 
subprojects in 2013. 
The  original  project  suffered  initial  start-up  difficulties,  but  has  demonstrated  good 
3. 
performance since 2010. As of March 2015, renovation of water management infrastructure in 
the  Narail  and  Chenchuri  Beel  subproject  areas  has  been  substantially  completed  under  the 
current project with satisfactory achievements of anticipated targets. 14 WMAs and 102 WMGs 
have  been  formulated  covering  the  entire  two  subproject  areas,  and  have  been  functional. 
Capacity enhancement activities for WMOs are on-going. Operation and maintenance (O&M) of 
small  structures  have  been  handed  over  to  WMAs  and  WMGs  after  providing  O&M  capacity 
development  training.  The  current  project  is  considered  to  be  the  first  successful  participatory 
project  for  large  FCD/I  schemes.  Knowledge  and  experience  of  participatory  water  resources 
planning and management have being acquired in BWDB.  
4. 
The  additional  financing  will  expand  the  successful  participatory  water  resources 
planning and management practices to other nine additional subproject areas (84,000 ha) in the

2   During  the  project  preparatory  stage  of  the  original  Southwest  project,  11  candidate  subprojects  had  been 
identified. However, four subprojects were replaced with four new priority subprojects (SPs No. 1,2,4, and 6) during 
the DPP preparation, as the four subprojects were decided to be conducted by government funds. A pre-feasibility 
assessment of the updated long-listed 11 candidate schemes was undertaken in 2008 under the original project. 
After  the  pre-feasibility  study,  three  qualified  schemes  were  taken  over  by  the Water  Management  Improvement 
Project funded by the World Bank. Hence, in 2011, a few more candidate schemes were examined based on the 
latest data, and one of them (SP No. 7) was considered for further studies. Feasibility studies were conducted for 
seven  candidate  SPs  (1-7)  under  the  ongoing  project.  The  candidate  subprojects  were  selected  based  on  the 
selection criteria defined in the loan agreement.

Project Activities and Anticipated Outputs of Additional Financing 
9. 
The  impact  of  the  current  and  overall  project  will  be  enhanced  economic  growth  and 
reduced poverty in rural areas of the selected districts in the southwest area of Bangladesh. The 
outcome will be enhanced productivity and sustainability of the selected existing FCD/I systems.   
10. 
The  outputs  will  be  (i)  WMOs’  capacity  strengthened  for  sustainable  water  resources 
planning and management in the subproject areas, (ii) infrastructure facilities of FCD/I schemes 
restored in the subproject areas, and (iii) institutional capacity for sustainable participatory water 
resources  planning  and  management  strengthened.  Table  A1.7  summarizes  the  outputs  and 
activities.  
Under  the  first  output,  the  proposed  additional  financing  will  cover  formation  and 
11. 
capacity  development  of WMOs  in  the  additional  nine  subproject  areas.  Follow-up  support  for 
O&M capacity development will also be provided to the existing 102 WMGs and 14 WMAs in the 
two subproject areas of the current project. An integrated water management plan (IWMP) will 
be prepared for the four FCD/I schemes covering about 45,000 ha. (SPs no. 8-11, see Tables 
A1.5  and  A1.6).  Each  IWMP  formulates  holistic  water  resources  management  planning  and 
safeguard assessments for the subject subproject, following intensive participatory analyses of 
local conditions and needs.  
12. 
Each  subproject  will  be  divided  into  hydrological  subunits  controlled  by  individual  local 
structures. The project will form WMAs that will manage each subunit and lower tier WMGs. The 
project  will  prepare  a  subunit  implementation  plan  (SIP)  for  each  subunit,  which  will  include 
specific  requirements  of  renovation  or  construction  of  water  management  infrastructure,  and 
capacity development and livelihood support programs for WMOs.  
13. 
Subsequent to preparation of SIPs, the project will support the WMOs to implement the 
institutional development plan specified in the SIPs, including (i) capacity development training 
of  executive committees  and subgroups under WMOs,  (ii)  development  of  operation  rules,  (iii) 
registration, and (iv) establishment of a fee collection system for O&M services and other WMO 
activities.  The  project  will  also  support  WMOs’  skills  development  for  efficient  use  of  water 
management infrastructures to improve productivities of agriculture and fishery, and for ensuring 
attention to all gender- and social inclusion related aspects of water resource management. The 
support will be linked to other income-generating activities of WMOs.  Additional 150 WMGs are 
expected  to  be  formed  with  the  inclusion  of  the  socially  disadvantaged  and  with  40%  women 
participation under the proposed additional financing.  
14. 
The project support will be extended to training and capacity development of WMOs for 
monitoring civil works, routine minor maintenance of infrastructure, formulation and operation of 
O&M committees under WMOs, preparation of O&M manuals, and effective use of WMO’s O&M 
funds.  O&M  of  infrastructure  will  be  transferred  to  WMAs  or  WMGs,  depending  on  their 
functions  and  covering  area,  after  completion  of  works  and  WMO  O&M  capacity  developing 
training.  The project will provide special attention to a link between the sustainability of WMO 
activities and sustainability of water management infrastructures. The sustainability of O&M by 
WMOs will be ensured by sustainability of WMOs themselves and their O&M fund collection. 
Relevant line agencies, such as the Department of Agriculture Extension, Department of 
15. 
Fisheries, Department of Livestock, and Department of Public Health Engineering, will provide 
technical inputs for their respective specialities, as supporting agencies. Physical  interventions 
include  rehabilitation  and  construction  of  regulators,  re-excavation  of  khals  and 
will

strengthening  (re-sectioning)  of  flood  embankments.  Indicative  quantities  of  anticipated  civil 
works are shown in Table A1.8, while requirements of physical interventions will be determined 
during the SIP preparation, in due consultation of needs of WMOs. 
The first output will also include follow-up supports for existing WMOs formulated under 
16. 
the  current  project  in  the  Narail  and  Chenchuri  Beel  subproject  areas.  To  ensure  the 
sustainability of WMOs, refreshing training will be provided. The project will also support WMGs 
for collecting Tk 60/acre/year of annual O&M fees from WMG members that is articulated in the 
signed O&M agreement to operationalize the O&M fee collecting system.  
17. 
Baseline  household  surveys  were  conducted  in  the  Narail  and  Chenchuri  Beel 
subproject areas under the L2200/G0036 Southwest project, as part of the preparation of WMO 
formation and  SIP  preparation.  The  additional financing  project  will  cover  the  end-line  surveys 
for  the  Narail  and  Chenchuri  Beel  subproject  area,  and  baseline  and  end-line  surveys  in  the 
nine  subproject  areas.  Facilitators  will  collect  data  from  each  household  along  with  their 
beneficiary  consultation  tasks  for  WMO  members,  under  the  supervision  of  PMO  and  the 
Institutional Strengthening and Project Management consultant team.  
18. 
The  second  output  will  include  renovation  or  construction  of  water  management 
infrastructure,  such  as  gated  water  retention  structures,  flood  embankments,  re-excavation  of 
drainage and/or irrigation canals, and local riverbank protection works, as specified in the SIPs.  
19. 
The  third  output  will  focus  on  the  national-level  institutional  capacity  development  of 
BWDB,  for:  (i)  efficient  coordination  with  relevant  government  departments,  such  as  the 
Department  of  Agriculture  Extension  and  the  Department  of  Fisheries,  (ii)  management  and 
monitoring  of  WMO  activities  that  will  be  registered  with  BWDB  under  the  new  participatory 
water  management  rules  2014,3  and  (iii)  performance  monitoring  and  O&M  of  water 
management infrastructures (MIS).  
20. 
It aims at the enhancement of the institutional capacity of BWDB and line agencies for 
operating and institutionalizing participatory and integrated water management, embodied in the 
National  Water  Policy.  The  project  will  support  training  and  study  tours.  The  project  will  also 
cover  upgrading  of  the  MIS.  The  existing  MIS  was  developed  under  the  original  project  for 
hydrological data collection and sharing, and FCD/I scheme infrastructure data. The MIS will be 
updated  to  include  O&M  data  and  improve  the  accessibility  and  sharing  of  information  using 
more recent technologies. 
21. 
Institutional capacity strengthening of BWDB will cover the Directorate of Audit and the 
Office of Chief Water Management (OCWM) to develop capacity for registration, auditing, and 
performance  monitoring  of  WMOs,  and  management  of  WMO  design.  As  per  the  new 
Participatory  Water  Management  Regulation  2014,4  BWDB  is  responsible  for  registration  and 
performance (technical, institutional, and financial) auditing of WMOs, while the  Department of 
Corporatives (DOC) used to be in charge of the registration and auditing. Capacity development 
of  OCWM  and  the  Directorate  of  Audit  of  BWDB  is  an  urgent  need.  Detailed  institutional 
capacity strengthening programs for BWDB will be developed during the project, but anticipated 
support  include  the  preparation  and  operationalizing  clear  procedures  of  registration  and

Overall Implementation Procedures 
Figure A1.1 shows the overall implementation procedures of the project implementation. 
22. 
The implementation of a subproject will have a 5.5 to 6-year of cycle. A cycle of WMO support 
will consists of three stages: (i) social mobilisation, WMO formulation, and SIP preparation, (ii) 
WMO  capacity  strengthening,  and  (iii)  operation  and  management  support.  Required  physical 
and  non-phsical  interventions  in  each  sub-unit  under  the  subproject  will  be  determined  in  the 
SIP.  In  parallel  with  the  WMO  support  activities,  detailed  structural  design  will  be  conducted 
based  on  the  SIP,  and  civil  works  will  be  conducted.  Further  details  of  the  subproject 
implementation procedures are explained in Appendix 2 of the Updated Project Administration 
Manual.  
The  nine  subprojects  will  be  grouped  into  three.  To  mitigate  start-up  difficulties,  the 
23. 
subproject  implementation  will  be  started  by  phase  of  the  three  groups,  as  in  Figure  A1.1. 
Table A1.9 lists administration units in the subproject areas.

APPENDIX 2: UPDATED SUBPROJECT IMPLEMENTATION PROCEDURES1 
A. 
General 
The existing subproject implementation procedures under the current Southwest project 
1. 
will be applied to the additional financing project, with minor adjustment and improvement. The 
procedures  and  arrangements  of  managing  subproject  development  cycle  from  scheme 
identification  to  O&M  handover  to  water  management  organizations  (WMOs),  maybe  water 
management  associations  (WMAs)  or  water  management  groups  (WMGs)  depending  on  the 
size  and  nature  of  relevant  infrastructures,  or  establishment  of  joint  management  system  with 
WMAs  are  provided herewith.  In  principle,  provisions  in the  Guidelines  for  Participatory Water 
Management  (GPWM)  will  be  followed,  with  the  assistance  of  the  consultants  for  institutional 
strengthening and project management (ISPM). 
B. 
Overview of Subproject Development Cycle 
The  following  basic  principles  underlie  the  participatory  development  approach  of  the 
2. 
Project. 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
Subprojects  and individual  subunits  under  the  subproject must  be requested  by 
the  genuine  representatives  of  the  stakeholders,  such  as  unikon  parishad  (UP) 
members  and  other  local  leaders  interested  in  improving  water  resource 
management. 
Local  beneficiaries  must  be  involved  in  all  stages  of  subproject/subunit 
development  participating 
the  key  decision-making  processes.  Direct 
beneficiaries  (owners  and  tenants)  will  be  accurately  identified  with  clear 
identification of subproject/subunit boundaries. 
in 
The overall approach is a combination of two, parallel but interrelated processes, 
one that addresses institutional and social matters and the other that addresses 
technical matters. 
(iv)  WMOs to be formulated under the project will follow the new participatory water 
management rule 2014 of Bangladesh.  
Under  the  project,  subproject  development  cycle  is  divided  into  the  following  distinct 
3. 
stages and steps. 
3-1.  
Integrated Water Management Plan (IWMP) Preparation Stage

(v) 
Tendering and Construction of water management and associated infrastructure; 
(vi) 
Agriculture fishery and livelihood development activities; and 
(vii)  O&M training , and post-investment monitoring and support 
The  flowchart  in  Figure  A2.1  presents  the  sequence  of  activities,  which  will  be 
4. 
institutionalized  under  the  project.  Proper  monitoring  and  evaluation  mechanism  will  ensure 
quality,  and  will  contribute  to  learning  lessons  to  fine  tune,  adapt  and  simplify  the  concepts 
during  the  implementation  period.  Internal  monitoring  and  quality  control  system  will  be 
improved  and  be further  elaborated,  while an  external  performance  and technical  audit  will  be 
carried out through the ISPM consultants. 
5. 
Special  note  on  household  surveys.  Under  the  L2200/G0036  Southwest  project, 
detailed household socio-economic surveys were conducted in the subproject areas as part of 
the preparation for WMO formation and subunit implementation plans (SIPs) to identify specific 
needs of different groups of potential WMO members. Data were collected by facilitators under 
supervision  of  PMO  and  the  ISPM  consultants.  The  data  present  baseline  conditions  of  each 
WMO. The household surveys with data collection by facilitators will be conducted also during 
the additional financing project as below:  
 
 
Household  surveys  in  the  Narail  and  Chenchuri  Beel  subproject  areas  will  be 
conducted by the end of the second year of the additional financing project period. 
This is to collect end-line data in the two subproject areas.  
In the nine subproject areas to be implemented under the additional financing, the 
household  surveys  will  be  conducted  during  the  WMO  formation  and  SIP 
preparation stage, which will become baseline data. The same surveys will also be 
conducted at the end of the subproject cycle (about 5.5 years), to capture end-line 
conditions.  
C. 
Arrangements in Each Development Stage 
C-1.  Subproject Identification, Selection, IWMP Preparation and Feasibility Studies 
Stage 1: Verification of the Subproject Selection for IWMP preparation 
6. 
For two subprojects for which an IWMP will be prepared but that will not be implemented 
under the project, the selection of the subproject will be verified to ensure that the subprojects 
meets the criteria that were applied to the other subprojects. The criteria are indicated in Figure 
A2.1.  
Stage 2: IWMP Preparation and Feasibility Assessment2 
7. 
IWMP  Preparation.  For  the  two  out  of  nine  selected  subprojects,  PMO  with  the 
assistance  of  ISPM  consultants  and  prospective  SMO,  will  prepare  the  IWMP  plan  for  the 
subproject, through (i) data collection on physical, socio-economic, and institutional setting; (ii) 
participatory  rural  appraisal  at  union  and  upazila  levels;  (iii)  problem  assessments  on 
2 In principal, all planning documents produced under this stage, including IWMPs, feasibility studies, and safeguards 
assessment will be prepared and processed in one batch during the first 1.5 years of the Project implementation.

67 
agriculture,  fisheries,  infrastructure  and  water  management  and  inventorying  of  existing  and 
planned programs; and (iv) identification of priority investment requirements focusing  on water 
and  associated  interventions.  PMO  will  coordinate  with  local  government  institutions,  potential 
water uses, and relevant government institutions like DAE and DOF. This will be compiled into 
an  IWMP  that  stipulates  existing  settings,  problems  and  constraints,  strategy  and  specific 
programs,  and  intended  output  targets,  encompassing  (i)  WMO  institutional  development;  (ii) 
water  management  infrastructure;  (iii)  agriculture,  fishery,  and  livelihood  enhancement  plans 
including  gender  and  vulnerable  group  development;  and  (iv)  scheme  O&M  plan.  During  the 
process,  WARPO  will  be  provided  with  support  by  ISPM  consultants  to  effectively  guide  the 
integrated planning process. 
8. 
Feasibility Studies. On the basis of the identified priority interventions, PMO and ISPM 
consultants  will  undertake  subproject-level  feasibility  studies  following  the  sample  provided 
under the PPTA final report. The feasibility studies would include analysis of internal economic 
rate of return (EIRR) based on estimated agriculture, fisheries and other benefits. They will also 
assess social and poverty impacts, and strategy and actions for social and gender development. 
9. 
Safeguards  Assessments.  PMO  will  also  assess  environmental  impacts  and  prepare 
resettlement plans associated with the identified interventions. Specifically, PMO will undertake 
initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  for  each  subproject,  based  on  which  decision  will  be 
taken  by  PMO  in  consultation  with  Department  of  Environment  (DOE)  and  ADB  weather  an 
individual subproject will be subject to a full environmental impact assessment (EIA), following 
the  guidelines  of  the  Government  and  ADB.  For  subprojects  requiring  EIAs,  detailed  impact 
assessments will be undertaken with public consultation process described in the environmental 
management plan (EMP) prepared under the PPTA, supplemented by necessary consultations 
at  national  level.  The  PMO  will  ensure  the  EIA  processes  and  procedures  are  followed, 
including  public  consultations  with  the  assistance  of  the  ISPM  consultants.    As  to  the  land 
acquisition and resettlement, a short or full draft resettlement plan (RP) will be prepared in each 
subproject following the resettlement framework and sample resettlement plans prepared under 
the PPTA, with due consultation and survey of affected households and information disclosure 
process. 
Finalization of IWMPs, Feasibility Studies, and Safeguards Documents. The above 
10. 
procedures  will  be  undertaken  in  closure  consultation  with  the  JMC,  the  UP  council,  and 
stakeholders  at  the  field  level.  At  this  stage,  PMO  and  prospective  SMO  will  identify  key 
stakeholders and their leaders to form WMOs. Initial guidance of beneficiary contribution for the 
identified  interventions  will  be  provided  to  potential  beneficiaries  The  IWMP,  feasibility  study 
reports, IEE/EIA, and draft RPs for the subproject will be endorsed by the JMC and UP council. 
They will submitted to WARPO for clearance, and then to SASC and ADB for endorsement. The 
IEE/EIA  will  also  be  submitted  and  cleared  by  DOE  after  due  consultative  and  disclosure 
process prior to launching the subproject. 
C-2.  Participatory IWMP Implementation and Subproject O&M 
General Principle- Implementation Based on Hydrological Subunit 
11. 
The subproject IWMP as endorsed will be implemented on the basis of hydrological units 
within the subproject area generally defined as hydrologically independent sub-schemes, semi-
dependent  compartments,  and  their  sub-units  controlled  by  individual  hydrological  structures. 
Among  these,  sub-schemes/  compartments/  sub-units  having  the  benefit  area  of  1,000  ha  or 
less  and  that  are  relatively  independent  from  the  rest  of  the  system  may  be  implemented  by 
68 
Appendix 2 
LGED  through  its  small-scale  water  resources  development  sector  project  assisted  by  the 
Government  of  the  Netherlands  (GON)  and  ADB,  whereas  the  rest  of  the  areas  are  to  be 
implemented under the Project. Regardless of the implementation agency, however, the WMAs 
established  within  the  subproject  area  will  be  federated  altogether  and  participate  in  the 
subproject  JMC,  which  will  periodically  meet  to  guide  and  decide  on  the  overall  project 
implementation  issues.3  For  larger  schemes  such  as  the  two  sample  subprojects  prepared 
under  the  PPTA,  initial  implementation  will  concentrate  on  subunits  located  within  one  sub-
scheme  (as  opposed  to    taking  up  subunits  in  multiple  sub-schemes  simultaneously)  to 
demonstrate    sound  performance    of  the  implementation  mechanisms  with  commensurate 
capacity development of the executing agency and supporting organizations. 
Stage 3. Preparation of Subunit Implementation Plan (SIP) 
12. 
Institutional  Setup.  For  the  nine  subprojects  for  the  implementation,  an  ad-hoc  joint 
management  committee  (JMC)  will  be  formed  to  support  planning,  development,  and  O&M 
processes. The JMC will initially chaired by the Project Director (or PMO executive engineer in 
planning), and participated by WARPO (during the IWMP preparation stage), LGED, and other 
concerned line departments at the upazila/ district level, and representatives of UPs and other 
stakeholders organizations. The head of the prospective subproject management office (SMO) 
for subproject will also facilitate and participate in the process. 
13. 
Request/  Application  through  UP.  Upon  approval  of  the  IWMP,  the  concerned  SMO 
will initiate project information campaign within the subproject area. Specifically, PMO will issue 
a letter  or  circular  to the  UPs  that  provides  a clear  explanation  of the  project  and  the  process 
and  requirements  whereby  prospective  local  leaders  and  stakeholders  can  initiate  actions  to 
obtain  project  assistance.  The  information  will  be  disseminated  among  subunit  stakeholders 
through the concerned UP member. SMO through senior and community facilitators engaged by 
PMO  and  trained  by  ISPM  consultants  will  facilitate  the  process  with  the  support  of  the  ISPM 
consultants  and  in  close  interaction  with  the  UP  members.  At  this  stage,  the  facilitators  will 
obtain  the  following  information  in  consultation  with  diverse  stakeholders  of  the  concerned 
subunit. 
(i) 
Preliminary scope of subunit works refined through consultative process. 
(ii) 
If there is broad, popular support for the subunit works. 
(iii) 
If there is any opposition to the proposed works, and if so, its extent. 
(iv) 
Exiting water management practices and accurate beneficiary boundary areas. 
(v) 
(vi)

landless and women groups. 
3  Ad-hoc  JMC  chair  will  be  handed  over  from  project  director/  executive  engineer  (planning)  to  subproject  advisor/ 
subproject manager at this stage. Its formal structure will be defined by the time of the mid-term review.  
Appendix 2 
69 
14.  WMA  Foundation  Committee.  Upon  confirmation  of  the  implementability  of  subunit 
works  by  SMO,  the  concerned and  interested  stakeholders  will  be  promoted  to form  an WMA 
foundation committee (of about 10-12 members, comprising UP members as appropriate, and 
representatives across all benefited areas and from different professions having stake in water 
management),  and  submit  the  request  to  the  SMO.  Local  representatives  having  interest  in 
participating  in  civil  work  contracts  will  be  discouraged  to  participate  in  the  foundation 
committee. 
JMC  Sub-committee  for  the  Subunit.  Upon  receipt  of  the  request  for  subunit 
15. 
implementation,  a  JMC  sub-committee  for  the  subunit  will  be  formed,  initially  chaired  by 
subproject manager of SMO, upazila or block level line department staff (that includes at least 
agriculture extension and fisheries), and representatives of the WMA foundation committee and 
the concerned UPs, which will guide the process of participatory SIP preparation and follow-on 
implementation  activities.  JMC  sub-committee  will  regularly  meet  at the SMO  office  or subunit 
sites to review the progress of preparing and implementing the SIP, and decide on the program 
activities  and  expenditures,  schedules,  and  responsibilities  of  the  concerned  organizations 
during the next interval period. 
16. 
SIP Preparation and Feasibility Confirmation. At the outset, the JMC sub-committee 
members (with the presence of ISPM consultants at initial stages) will undertake a field visit to 
confirm  the  scope  of  subunit  works  and  other  information  collected  by  senior  and  community 
facilitators in para 12 above, based on which SIP preparation and feasibility confirmation will be 
initiated. For these purposes, latest data on socio-economic conditions, topography, water level, 
agriculture,  fisheries,  and  environment  will  be  collected.  Accurate  boundaries  of  the  subunit 
benefit area will be established on an appropriately sized map. Specific benchmark beneficiaries 
are identified representing geographical locations and social groups for socio-economic aspects 
and  data  duly  recorded  for  further  follow-up  in  the  later  stage.  The  collected  data  and 
information  will  be  used  to  prepare  a  comprehensive  SIP  to  lay  out  specific  programs,  their 
schedules, and institutional responsibilities. The SIPs will stipulate subunit specific requirements  
for WMO formation  (including  required  special  consideration for  technical  and  social  aspects), 
water  management  structures  to  be  constructed  or  rehabilitated,  and  WMO  capacity 
development  programs 
livelihood  enhancement,  and  business 
development,  etc.).4  These  requirements  will  become  output  targets  of  each  subunit.  In 
preparing  SIP,  particular  attention  should  be  provided  to  establish  effective  linkages  with  the 
existing  programs  and  projects  in  the  agriculture  and  rural  development  sector.  During  this 
process,  subunit feasibility  will  also be  confirmed  through due cost  and benefit  analysis  within 
the  framework  of  the  overall  subproject  feasibility  studies  in  IWMPs.  Subunit  specific 
environment issues will be discussed in SIPs, in line with the existing IEE (government’s EIA), 
and subproject specific environmental management plan (EMP) will be prepared. 
(agriculture, 
fishery, 
To  support  the  preparation  of  these  outputs,  ISPM  consultants,  in  close  collaboration 
17. 
with  PMO,  will  prepare  SIPs.  This  will  be  undertaken  with  active  consultation  with  the 
stakeholders  in  particular  JMC  subcommittee  for  the  subunit.  SMO  will  provide  day-to-day 
supervision  of  the  process.  The  draft  will  also  have  to  discussed  and  endorsed  by  the  WMA 
foundation  committee  and  JMC  sub-committee  for  the  subunit,  of  which  minutes  are  duly 
prepared.  These  will  then  be  forwarded  to  PMO  for  clearance.5  Initially  the  SIP  and feasibility 
4  SIP  will  also  stipulate  the  required  level  of  agriculture  inputs  to  achieve  the  output  targets,  and  possible  delivery 
mechanisms of the necessary inputs including those delivered by the private sector. 
5 The clearance does not include the detailed design, which will be undertaken during the WMO strengthening stage 
with  more  intensive  consultation  with  the  WMOs  and  endorsed  at  the  time  of  signing  of  the  implementation 
agreements (IAs) for subunit implementation. 
70 
Appendix 2 
confirmation report including EMP will be submitted to ADB for review and endorsement prior to 
implementation  of  the  SIP.  Once  it  has  been  established  through  a  joint  review  by  the 
Government  and  ADB  that  outputs  have  achieved  the  desired  level  of  quality,  they  will  be 
retained in PMO for use by ADB during review missions. 
Stage 4: WMO Institutional Development and Detailed Design 
18.  WMO  Formation. With subunit  approval,  the  process  of  establishing  WMOs  under  the 
legal framework of the Participatory Water Management Rule (2014) is initiated, in accordance 
with  the  institutional  development  plan  specified  in  the  SIP.  In  principle,  one  WMA  will  be 
established for each subunit, while a few WMAs may be established in case of larger subunits 
cutting across unions or having several distinct facilities. For the purpose of WMO formation, the 
concerned  WMO  is  to  nominate  two  qualified  community  based  organizers  (CBOs)  from  the 
locality,  who  will  be  contracted  with  SMO  to  facilitate  the  concerned  WMO  to  strengthen  its 
organization  with  the  support  by  the  senior  and  community  facilitators  and  BWDB  community 
organizer (CO) in providing motivation and support to the community. Their capacity will also be 
strengthened by ISPM consultants to take on the role of supporting CBOs’ activities. 
transformed 
to  WMO  Management  Committee, 
19. 
The  facilitators  will  start  with  an  information  campaign  to  the  stakeholders.  Then,  an 
inventory of beneficiary households inside the subunit area is prepared. In this process, direct 
beneficiaries  (agriculture  and  fisheries),  other  relevant  stakeholder  groups  (such  as  landless), 
and respected local leaders will be identified, and a complete list of beneficiaries and affected 
persons  will  be  established.  On  the  basis  of  this,  the  WMO  foundation  Committee  will  be 
modified  and 
to  promote  appropriate 
representation of various stakeholder groups within the area. Subsequently, the Committee will 
prepare,  with  the  facilitation  of  the  CBOs  and  facilitators  (trained  by  ISPM  consultants),  draft 
WMO constitution, by-laws, and rules and regulations that define the organizational setup, and 
operational  arrangements  and  procedures.  They  will  also  (i)  organize  general  meetings;  (ii) 
enroll  members  (including  collection  of  initial  shares  and  savings)  with  a  focus  on  direct 
beneficiaries  ensuring  larger  farmers  participate;  (iii)  form  village,  and  other  social-based 
groups;  (iv)  discuss  and  finalize  beneficiary  contribution  arrangements  for  O&M,6  (v)  organize 
the first WMO general assembly; (vi) apply for registration; and (vii) conduct an election within 
the  specified  time  frame.  (Specific  member,  task  force  or  sub-committee  maybe  assigned  to 
promote  these  processes  as  appropriate)  The  WMO  will  also  appoint  a  manager  and  a 
treasurer. Training for financial management including accounting will also be provided from the 
trained NGO facilitators and ISPM consultants. 
20. 
 As  a process to  strengthened  the  institutional  basis.  The WMO,  through  facilitation by 
the  CBOs    facilitators,  will  also  undertake  immediate  works  as  stipulated  in  the  institutional 
development plan under the SIP, including the cleaning of canals and filling of dike slopes that 
the WMO is to manage after subunit work completion. At the same time, the CBOs will facilitate 
the formation of subgroups to receive agriculture and fishery extension, and livelihood support 
services later. These groups are encourages to have at least 33% of women. 
The  main  aim  of  these  institutional  activities  is  to  create  a  strong  and  broad-based 
21. 
WMO.  It  will  become  the  platform  for  all  water  resource  management  decisions  affecting  the 
subunit.  This  includes  resolving  the  inevitable  conflicts  of  interest  between  the  various 
6  As  to  O&M,  farmers  are  encouraged  to  apply  an  arrangement  that  the  contribution  will  not  disbenefit  the  smaller 
farmers  and  the  poor,  e.g.,  by  applying  landholding  based  contribution  with  special  arrangements  to  reduce  the 
burden to those who have fewer assets.  
Appendix 2

stakeholders. To this end, the facilitators will also interact with project-affected persons to agree 
on  necessary  mitigation measures.  For  water  control  structures,  provisional  facility  operational 
arrangement  will  be  discussed  and  agreed  among  different  stakeholders  (e.g.,  farmers  in  low 
lying area and relatively higher areas, culture fishery beneficiaries, and capture fishers) with the 
facilitation of the COs and SMO engineering staff with the support of the ISPM consultants. For 
purposes  of  conflict  resolution,  the  Union  Parishad  will  be  involved  in  accordance  with  their 
mandate. In general, the Union Parishad will act in an advisory capacity to MWA and to promote 
this  role,  the  members  of  the  Union  Parishad  will  be  provided  with  training.  For  conflicts  that 
cannot  be  resolved  at  the  Union  Parishad  levels,  the  matter  will  be  raised  to  a  JMC  sub-
committee for the subunit, which would be authorized to conduct inquiries and to take measures 
to enforce its decisions and to take pre-emptive action. 
Participatory Detailed Design. During this stage, data collection for detailed design of 
22. 
the  engineering  works  in  undertaken,  followed  by  the  design  work  through  a  consultative 
process  with  the  farmers  including  joint  walk-through.  The  design  work  will  be  undertaken 
primarily by PMO and BWDB design engineers and may be supplemented by private firms. To 
support the process, the ISPM consultants will review the existing design standards and update/ 
improve those in the light of the international and local experience to promote more efficient and 
low-cost yet durable structures. 
Upon preparation of the draft detailed design, the designated design engineers of PMO 
23. 
and  BWDB  or  private firms  will  present  to a  general WMO  meeting (i)  the design concept,  (ii) 
proposed O&M arrangements, and (iii) required amount of beneficiary contribution. A joint walk-
through  with  the  direct  beneficiaries  will  also  be  arranged.  Based  on  the  MWA  feedback, 
additional  design data,  if  required,  will  be  collected  and draft final  designs  prepared. The field 
consultation  will  be  duly  recorded  and  minutes  signed  by  the  WMA  Management  Committee 
chair and kept in SMO. 
At this time, a list of direct beneficiaries and their landholding size and how much each 
24. 
will  contribute  in  cash  will  be  prepared,  through  facilitation  by  the  facilitators.  The  WMO  will 
contribute  an  amount  equivalent  to  annual  O&M  requirement  for  the  concerned  facilities, 
estimated  on  the  basis  of  the  arrangement  that  WMO  will  bear  the  full  O&M  responsibility  of 
subordinate  facilities  of  the  subproject  of  which  management  is  transferred  to  the  WMO, 
whereas they  will be responsible for operation and annual maintenance (such as filling of rain 
cuts    in embankment  slopes and canal  cleaning,  as opposed  to periodic  maintenance) for the 
main facilities of which command area is beyond 2,500 ha, in principle. After estimating the total 
beneficiary  contribution  and  cost  sharing  arrangements  among  the  beneficiary  members,  a 
campaign  for  collecting  the  contribution  is  initiated.  Further  adjustment  of  its  distribution  to 
reduce the burden if the smaller farmers will be encouraged 
Approval  of  Detail  Design.  After  the  completion  of  these  processes,  a  general WMO 
25. 
meeting  will  be  called  to  discuss  and  finalize  the  detailed  design  including  the  required 
beneficiary contribution and its arrangements for the individual farmers. The representatives of 
the  SMO,  PMO,  and  ISPM  consultants  will  be  present,  and  the  minutes  will  be  prepared  and 
signed by the Management Committee and kept in SMO. The detailed design as approved by 
the WMO will be sent to PMO for clearance with the assistance of the ISPM consultants. 
26. 
Resettlement  Plan.  In  parallel  to  the  activities  ongoing  in  this  stage,  the  draft  RP 
corresponding to  the  subunit  will  be  refined  and finalized,  in accordance  with the  resettlement 
framework  and  resettlement  plan,  and  corresponding  guidelines  of  the  Government  and  ABD. 
The  PMO  will  engage  private  firm  (for  RP  refinement)  and  NGO  (for  supporting  consultative 
72 
Appendix 2 
process  of  RP  refinement,  and  its  implementation),  which  conduct  their  designated  activities 
under supervision and guidance on the resettlement specialist in ISPM consultant team. The RP 
as prepared by PMO and SMO and approved by BWDB will be forwarded to ADB for approval, 
after which its implementation process will be initiated by SMO through the recruited NGO. 
27. 
Signing  Implementation  Agreement  (IA).  The  activities  related  to  Stage  4  of  the 
subproject development cycle culminate in signing an IA for subunit implementation, which set 
out specific subunit activities undertaken, schedules, and institutional responsibilities. It will be 
signed  by  an  elected  management  committee  of  the  WMO,  subprojects  manager  in  SMO, 
upazila agriculture and fishery officer, and the concerned union chairperson(s). The agreement 
will only be signed when the following conditions have been met and confirmed by PMO with the 
support of the ISPM consultants. 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
(v) 
(vi) 
Membership enrollment in the WMO includes representation from a minimum of 
70%  of  the  direct  beneficiary  households  in each geographical  and  stakeholder 
groups of the system. At least 33% membership is targeted for women. 
The WMO has engaged a manager who has been working on their behalf for at 
least 4 months prior to the signing of the IA, along with a qualified treasurer. 
The WMO has finalized its constitution and by-laws, has been registered with the 
Office  of  Chief  Water  Management  (OCWM)  of  BWDB.  At  least  33%  of  the 
management committee members should be women. 
The engineering designs, beneficiary contribution works and arrangements have 
been discussed in WMO general meeting and endorsed. 
Provisional  facility  operational  plans  for  water  control  structures  have  been 
discussed and agreed among different stakeholders within and outside WMO. 
The  WMO  has  (a)  collected  the  initial  upfront  cash  contribution  amounting  to 
annual  equivalent  of  O&M  cost  deposited  to  joint  account  by  WMO  and  SMO, 
and (b) agreed to build up the fund through annual contribution during and after 
civil works to the target specified in the SIP. 
(vii) 
The  WMO  has  demonstrated  through  their  records  that  they  have  conducted 
regular meetings and the Management Committee has met monthly for at least 4 
months prior to the signing of the IA. 
(viii)  The  WMO  has  completed  all  the  immediate  activities  as  stipulated  in  the 
institutional development plan of the SIP, including the immediate canal cleaning 
works and minor repair of earth structures, and has agreed to continue self-help 
work as such. 
Follow-on  WMO  Institutional  Development. While  the  signing  of  the  IA  will  serve  as 
28. 
the  benchmark  to  start  Stage  5  activities,  institutional  development  activities for  the  WMO  will 
continue  beyond  this  stage.  Specifically,  they  will  continue  collecting  additional  contributions 
from  the  direct  beneficiaries  during  the  constructions  and  post-construction  stage  and  deposit 
the  amount  in  the  aforementioned  joint  account.  The  WMO  will  also  continue  to  develop  their 
capital resource base through the sale of shares and by encouraging members to contribute to 
savings.  At  the  discretion  of  the  WMO,  these  capital  funds  will  be  used  to  generate  income 
Appendix 2 
73 
through  various  means  ranging  from  financing  income-generating  activities  for  the  poorest 
people  in  the  community  to  providing  credit  to  small  farmers  and  businesses.  During  the 
process, PMO assisted by the ISPM consultant team will also providing training on the operation 
and  management  of  WMOs  including  procedures  and  arrangements  of  election.  OCWM  will 
conduct regular inspection and audit of WMOs upon their registration. PMO will assist OWCM 
for facilitating the inspection and audit of WMOs in the project area.  
Stage 5: Pre-tendering, and Construction 
29. 
Implementation of RP. RP implementation, initiated on its approval by BWDB and ADB 
will  have been  undertaken  by  the  SMO. The  necessary  compensation to the  affected persons 
must have been fully disbursed prior to initiating the tendering process of the civil works for the 
subunit. 
30. 
Tendering,  Contract  Signing,  and  Work  Initiation.  Upon  confirmation  of  the  due 
progress  in  RP  implementation,  tendering  for  the  subunit  civil  works  will  be  initiated  by  SMO, 
following  the  procedures  stipulated  in  the  Public  Procurement  Regulations  2003.  Private 
contractors  will  be  invited  for  the  construction  of  key  structures,  whereas  small  simple  earth 
work  contracts  valued  at  less  than  about  $10,000  equivalent  may  be  awarded  to  labor 
contracting societies (LCS) to be formed within the WMO among disadvantaged groups with the 
support  of  the  facilitators,  who  will  be  provided  with  designated  wage  rate  as  defined  by  the 
Government.  For  works undertaken  by  private  contractors, the WMO  will  be  provided  with the 
copy of the contract. The WMO management committee members are not allowed to work as 
contractors in any of the construction works under the subunit. 
31. 
Construction and Monitoring. During the construction by contractors, the WMO will be 
involved  in  monitoring  construction  done  by  contractors,  by  establishing  O&M  sub-committee.  
For  this  purpose  PMO  and  ISPM  consultants  will  train  the  O&M  sub-committee  members  on 
construction  monitoring. The  subproject manager  will  issue  instructions to  the  contractor  while 
giving  the  sub-committee  members  as  well  as  elected  UP  members  the  right  to  lodge  written 
complaints to SMO. SMO will provide improved construction supervision, while contractors will 
also maintain work records including photographs taken at pre- and post- construction and other 
key stages, following the construction management guidelines to be improved by PMO with the 
assistance  of  ISPM  consultants.  As  build  drawings  will  be  prepared  by  the  contractor,  with 
copies  shared  with  the  WMO  (for  the  facility  management  handed  over  to  them)  and  the 
concerned SMO. In addition, external performance monitoring and technical auditing will also be 
undertaken,  through third-party  specialists  mobilized  by  ISPM  consultants  and working  closely 
with the Comptroller of Auditor General (CAG) office. 
32. 
Initial  O&M  Training  and  Planning.  At  this  stage,  the WMO  O&M  sub-committee  will 
also be trained to prepare an O&M plan for the subunit with the assistance of the sub-divisional 
engineer  trained  by  the  PMO  and  ISPM  consultants.  The  O&M  plan  will  comprise  operational 
plan (as prepared during the Stage 4 and refined at this stage, for different cropping seasons), 
maintenance plan, and resource mobilization plan, for both WMO managed facilities and jointly 
managed facilities (see para 13 for differentiation of facility management). 
33. 
Preparation  for  Agriculture,  Fishery,  and  Livelihood  Enhancement  Plans.  Upon 
signing  of the  IA,  the WMO  will  receive  support  from  the  Department  of Agriculture  Extension 
(DAE),  Department  of  Fisheries  (DOF),  and  other  line  departments,  and  private  providers  as 
appropriate, to elaborate agriculture, fishery (where relevant), and livelihood enhancement plans 
building  on  the  SIP,  with  the  support  of  the  ISPM  consultants.  COs  and  the  facilitators  will 
74 
Appendix 2 
facilitate the process. At this stage, the WMO will form sub-committees for agriculture, fishery, 
and livelihood enhancement comprising the representatives of the concerned groups. The sub-
committees  will  take  a  lead  role  in  planning,  undertaking,  and  monitoring  the  concerned 
development  activities.  The  concerned  plans  as  elaborated  by  the  sub-committees  will  be 
presented  to  the  JMC  sub-committee  and  then  forwarded  to  PMO  and  ISPM  consultants  for 
clearance. 
34. 
Joint  Inspection  at  Completion  of  Civil  Work.  Upon  completion  of  the  civil  works,  a 
joint  inspection  will  be  organized  by  WMO  O&M  sub-committee,  designated  SMO  staff,  and 
ISPM quality control engineer. To ensure the quality, payment of last installment to contractors 
will only be effected after approval of the quality control specialist in ISPM consultant team. 
Stage 6A: Agriculture, Fishery, and Livelihood Enhancement 
35. 
Agriculture  Extension  and  Support.  The  project  will  provide  agriculture  extension 
services in the subunit area to promote adoption of high-yielding and improved varieties of crops 
and  their  diversification  through  field  demonstration  and  training.  While  demonstration  and 
training subjects will be decided based on local demands and production constraints, priorities 
identified include (i) improved soil nutrient management with soil testing and diagnoses; (ii) crop 
intensification  and  diversification  including  high  yield  variety  (HIV)  and  cash  crop  cultivation 
practices;  (iii)  integrated  pest  management  (IPM);  (iv)  seed  multiplication;  (v)  on-farm  water 
management;  and  (vi)  farmer  tours  to  advanced  WMOs  and  production  areas.  For  field 
demonstration, demonstration plots will be selected from among the landless people (operating 
on landowner’s land) and marginal farmers who  agreed to repay the cost of input materials to 
the WMO. From each demonstration group, two members, a man and a woman will be selected 
as group leaders who  will be trained to serve as local extensionists. Upon completion of each 
crop  season,  the  concerned  farmers  on  the  demonstration  plot  (including  those  who  received 
the demonstration mini kit) will repay the stipulated amount in cash or in kind to the WMO which 
will  be  deposited  as  resource  fund,  based  on  which  WMO  will  undertake  the  next  round  of 
demonstration by purchasing demonstration materials and mobilizing WMO extensionalists, with 
the support of DAE staff and/or private providers using the fund generated. 
Following  the  SIP  prepared  based  on  the  assessment  of  the  farmer  needs  and 
36. 
willingness  to  purchase  improved  food  grain  seeds,  the  DAE  or  selected  private  agents  will 
assist  the  seed  multiplication  activities  of  the  enterprising  farmers  to  produce  the  required 
amount  of  improved  seeds  within  the  subunit  are  and  its  vicinity.  For  this  purpose,  the 
SMO/PMO  through  local  DAE  office  will  deliver  foundation  (or  first  generation  certified  or  C1) 
seeds from a local agriculture research station, and necessary inputs for demonstration. On the 
basis of this, seed multiplication will be undertaken by the selected farmers having sufficient soil 
conditions with the technical support. After the crop season, the harvested C1 (or C2) seeds are 
sold  to the  other farmers  who  showed  interest,  whereas  the  seed multiplier  farmers  will  repay 
the  cost  of  inputs  provided  by  the  project  to  the  WMO,  which  will  be  used  for  the  next 
generations of seed multiplication activities. The SMO/PMO will further facilitate the purchase of 
foundation or C1 seeds by WMO to sustain the process. 
37. 
Fishery  Demonstration  and  Support.  The  project  will  provide  fishery  development 
services  for  WMOs,  in  accordance  with  the  fishery  development  plan  prepared  in  para  32 
above. Services for fishery development will be delivered by DOF field staff or private providers, 
and focus on beels, khals, and other open and semi-open water bodies of which improved water 
management is made possible through the water infrastructure. For this purpose, WMO fishery 
groups  are  formed  with  priority  membership  of  poor  having  lost  access to floodplain  fisheries, 
Appendix 2 
75 
and are provided with culture fishery opportunities in water bodies in particular those created in 
the khals behind water retention structures. The relevant public water bodies within the subunit 
area will be leased out to the concerned fishery groups through the WMO. The training subjects 
provided  may  include  (i)  fish  production  technologies;  (ii)  pond  fish  and  fingerings  production; 
(iii)  integrated  fish  culture  including  rice-fish  culture  and  dick-fish  culture  (iv)  beel  farming;  (v) 
pen/  cargo  culture  and  (vi)  beneficiary  tour  to  advanced  WMOs  and  production  areas,  among 
others 
Livelihood  Enhancement  Support.  The  project  will  support  productive  income 
38. 
generating activities undertaken by the poor and vulnerable groups  organized under the WMO, 
in accordance with the livelihood enhancement plan prepared in para 32 above. In this context, 
efforts  will  be  made  to  promote  such  activities  on  the  public  lands  relevant  to  the  Project 
infrastructure,  such  as  canal  and  embankment  bank  slopes.  Specific  activities  promoted  will 
include social forestry, nurseries, vegetable cultivation, and livestock. Training will be provided 
through  the  concerned  line  departments  and/or  private  providers  mobilized  under  the  project. 
The  willing  WMOs  will  also  be  trained  by  concerned  microfinance  institution  or  other  relevant 
parties  to  operate  micro-credit  using  the  collected  shares  and  savings.  Those  who  will  be 
entitled to undertake income generating activities on the public lands will undertake necessary 
routine maintenance activities of the concerned facilities. 
Performance  Monitoring. The  SMO  will  monitor  the  activity  performance and impacts 
39. 
of  agriculture,  fishery,  and  livelihood  programs,  through  the  WMO  subject  matter  sub-
committees, with the facilitation of the COs and capacity development support provided by the 
ISPM  consultants.  Specifically,  the  activity  performance  will  be  monitored  in  the  light  of  the 
subject  matter  plans  that  stipulate  inputs  and  outputs  targets,  and  their  schedules.  Impacts 
monitoring  will  be  done  by  collecting  impact  information  from  the  key  benchmark  farmers.  On 
the  basis  of  the  performance monitoring,  the  SMO  and  the WMO  will  undertake at  the  end of 
each  cropping  season  the  review  and  planning  for  the  development  programs  for  the  next 
cropping season, with the support of the ISPM consultants. 
Stage 6B: Support for Establishing Sustainable O&M Mechanisms 
General.  In  parallel  to  Stage  6A  activities,  the  project  will  support  the  initial  smooth 
40. 
operation  of  the  constructed  facilities  as  well  as  the  continued  development  of  the  technical, 
administrative, and organizational management functions of WMAs as effective and sustainable 
O&M and development organizations. 
41. 
Test Run and Rectification. Upon confirmation that the civil works were completion in 
accordance  with  the  plan,  WMA  O&M  sub-committee  members  and  SMO  sub-divisional 
engineer  will  undertake  (with  the  presence  of  ISPM  consultants  during  initial  implementation 
period) a joint walk-through and test runs of water control structures. Any deficiency should be 
noted and rectified by the concerned contractors or by the SMO, depending on their nature. 
42.  Water  Control  Structure  Operation.7  Prior  to  the  start  of  each  cropping  season,  the 
WMA  O&M  sub-committee  will  refine  as  necessary  the  system  operational  plan  following  the 
plan  prepared  in  paras  33  and  34  above,  with  the  facilitation  of  the  COs  and  the  SMO  sub-
divisional  engineer  trained  by  the  ISPM  consultants.  During  the  initial  year  of  operation,  SMO 
will  closely  monitor  and  advise  the  system  operation  including  water  level  management 
7 In principle, operation of water control structures will be undertaken by the designated WMO regardless of the type 
of management – WMO-managed or jointly managed facilities. 
76 
Appendix 2 
(including irrigation water distribution within the subunit areas). For this purpose, the WMA O&M 
sub-committee  will  be  trained  by  PMO  and  ISPM  consultants  to  monitor  the  actual  water 
conditions in different cropping seasons as compared with SIP targets, and coordinate various 
stakeholder groups for effective water management, with a care that operation is undertaken in 
line with the agreed plan while ensuring intended benefits to the diverse stakeholders. A team in 
PMO and the ISPM consultants may be invited to assist the resolution of any operation-related 
problems. 
43.  Maintenance Planning and Implementation. At the same time, and in particular at the 
end  of  the  monsoon  season,  the  WMA  O&M  sub-committee  will  also  prepare  the  system 
maintenance plan with the assistance of the SMO sub-divisional engineer (trained by PMO and 
ISPM  consultants)  through  (i)  joint  walk-through  by  O&M  sub-committee  members,  group 
representatives  of  the  concerned  facilities,  and  the  SMO  staff  (ii)  identification  of  any 
maintenance  needs  on  the  basis  of  the  standard  guideline  to  be  prepared  and  finalized  by 
BWDB;  (iii)  preparation  of  the  maintenance  plan  differentiating  the  works  to  be  done  by  the 
WMA  and  by  the  SMO;  and  (iv)  preparation  of  the  resource  mobilization  plan  with  rating  for 
each beneficiary farmers (for the works for which the WMO is responsible). On the basis of this, 
the SMO will closely monitor and train the WMA to implement the maintenance plan up to a full 
year after completion of the civil work in principle. 
Further WMO Strengthening as Enterprise. As part of the program to strengthen the 
44. 
functions  of  the  WMO,  the  ISPM  consultants  will  prepare  a  training  for  strengthening  their 
bargaining  capacities  through  improved  technical,  organizational,  and  managerial  functions 
(such  as  organizing  collective  purchases  and  sales)  to  achieve  better  deals  with  inputs  and 
service  providers  and  marketing  agents  while  making  those  providers  and  agents  responsive 
and accountable to clients. Filed trip to interact with the successful WMOs that exist within the 
country will also be arranged by the ISPM consultants. 
Organizational  Performance  Monitoring.  The  SMO  with  the  assistance  of  the  ISPM 
45. 
consultants will closely  monitor the WMO performance in terms of (i) proper functioning of the 
groups/  committees  through  regular  meetings  and  activities;  (ii)  regular  book  keeping  in 
membership,  activity  records,  meeting  minutes,  beneficiary  contribution,  and 
finance, 
encompassing  their  activity  areas  including  agriculture,  fishery,  and  livelihood  enhancement, 
facility O&M, and general administration; (iii) capacity to monitor and report to SMO the program 
performance and impacts while identifying measures to resolve any problems. OCWM will also 
provide annual audit for every WMO in accordance with their rules and regulations. These are 
recorded on a regular basis by SMO and reported to PMO for file and advice. 
Annual Work Plan for the Post-investment Phase. By the end of the 12th month after 
46. 
completion  of  the  civil  works,  SMO  and  the  WMO  (in  particular  O&M  and  subject-matter  sub-
committees) will jointly work out the draft annual work plan for the subsequent year, stipulating 
the  programs  and  activities  for  (i)  agriculture,  fishery  and  livelihood;  (ii)  O&M-related  activities 
including  conflict  resolution;  and  (iii)  general  administrative  matters.  On  the  basis  of  the 
performance  evaluation,  specific  areas  where  further  technical  and  facilitation  support  by  the 
Project organization will be identified, and required inputs agreed. The annual work plan will be 
discussed with the PMO and the ISPM consultants for endorsement. 
47.  Management  Transfer.  Upon  completion  of  the  above  activities  and  confirmation  by 
PMO and the ISPM consultants that the concerned subunit has substantially achieved its output 
targets, the WMO enters into a O&M transfer agreement with BWDB and the UP on the O&M 
responsibilities of the facilities concerned. WMOs will be entrusted with full O&M of subordinate 
Appendix 2 
77 
facilities  of  which  command  area  is  up  to  2,500ha,  and  operation  and  regular/  annual  (as 
opposed to periodic) maintenance of other main facilities. The agreement is signed on condition 
that  (i)  an  O&M  subcommittee  has  been  established;  (ii)  an  O&M  plan,  satisfactory  to  ADB, 
PMO  and  the  ISPM  consultants  have  been  prepared  by  the  O&M  sub-committee  and  agreed 
upon by the general meeting of the WMA; (iii) any outstanding local conflicts are resolved; (iv) 
as-built drawings are prepared; and (v) subunit infrastructure is designed and constructed to the 
satisfaction of the WMA. Upon signing of the agreement, SMO concerned will then proceed with 
initiating the activities for a new subunit. 
Stage 7: Post-investment WMO activities, Monitoring and Support 
48. 
After signing  of the management transfer/ joint management  agreement,  the WMO  will 
operate the annual activity cycle including (i) the planning and implementation of O&M activities, 
(ii) WMO agriculture, fishery, and livelihood activities, and (iii) performance monitoring. 
49. 
The  WMO  will  undertake  these  activities  using  their  own  funds,  comprising  (i)  shares 
and savings collected from the beneficiaries; (ii) incomes or in-kind contribution generated from 
income  generating  activities  using  public  land  and  fishery  activities  undertaken  by  the 
concerned WMO groups; and (iii) O&M fund established with upfront and follow-on beneficiary 
contribution.  In  particular,  after  the  management  transfer/  joint  management  agreement  is 
signed,  the  WMO  will  have  access  to  the  O&M  funds  for  purposes  of  maintaining  the  water 
management  system.  The  fund  will  be  initially  jointly  managed  by  SMO  and  the  WMO,  to  be 
released to pay for specific maintenance works based on requests form the WMO. The WMO 
will replenish the amount by the end of the concerned O&M year. The fund will be handed to the 
WMO upon confirmation of satisfactory replenishment by the WMOs for two consecutive years. 
50. 
To ensure effective and sustainable operation of these functions, periodic performance 
monitoring will be made operational, through (i) WMO’s own monitoring and report to the SMO 
in programs and their performance for agriculture, fishery, livelihood, system O&M and general 
administration as well as in agriculture and social impacts and (ii) monitoring by SMO and DOC 
by  fielding  their  concerned  staff.  The  key  representatives  of  the  WMO  are  invited  to  SMO  to 
report  and discuss  the status. The  concerned  line  department  staff  will  also undertake  regular 
monitoring  and  support  activities  by  visiting  the  subunit  area  at  key  stages  of  their  operation, 
such  as  operational  planning  for  each  cropping  season,  joint  walk-through  for  identification  of 
maintenance  requirements,  and  agriculture,  fishery,  and  livelihood  development  review  and 
programming. A succinct activity record and findings will be filed in the SMO and forwarded to 
PMO and OCWM for file and necessary action.

Background 
APPENDIX 3: STATEMENT OF AUDIT NEEDS 
The  ADB  and  the  Government  of  Bangladesh  (GOB)  have  entered  into  a  Loan  and 
1. 
Grant Agreement whereby, ADB will provide $45 million equivalent for the purpose of financing 
civil  works,  equipment,  consulting  services,  training  and  capacity  development,  and  project 
management.  The  Government  of  Netherlands  funds  $7.0  million  as  grant  basis  for  financing 
consulting  services,  and  training  and  capacity  development.  The  GOB  shall  contribute  $  11.7 
million  against  these  funding.  This  will  be  carried  out  through  the  Bangladesh  Water 
Development  Board  (BWDB).  BWDB  shall  maintain  separate  books  of  account  which  will  be 
consolidated by PMO with respect to this project, including all items of expenditure financed out 
of the proceeds of the loan and grant agreement.  
B. 
Financial Reporting and Audie Requirements 
BWDB  will  prepare  project  financial  statements  on  a  cash  basis  of  accounting,  in 
2. 
accordance with its Financial Administrative Regulations (FAR). Project financial statements 
shall  be  prepared  separately  for  L-2200  and  the  additional  financing/OR  Consolidated 
financial statements shall be prepared for the Project, including proceeds under the ori ginal 
loan  and  the  additional  financing.  This  shall  not  be  construed  to  refer  to  the  financial 
statements of BWDB as a whole.  
3. 
The  audit  of  the  project  financial  statements  shall  be  carried  out  by  the  Foreign-Aided 
Project  Audit  Directorate  (FAPAD)  within  the  Comptroller  and  Auditor  General  (CAG)  of 
Bangladesh  in  accordance  with  CAGs  Audit  Manual.1,  as  supplemented  by  this  Statement  of 
Audit needs. The auditor will review that the funds received from all sources and expenditures 
incurred during the reporting period are as per agreed terms and conditions. This will include all 
expenditure to the extent that it relates to the activities of the project and BWDB supporting this 
project.  
4. 
BWDB will submit to ADB audited project financial statements as of June 30 each year, 
within  6  months  of  the  end  of  the  fiscal  year  in  English.  A  complete  set  of  audited  project 
financial statements includes: 
Audit opinion on the project financial statements  
Audit opinion on specific donor requirements  2

5. 
To ensure the timely  submission of audited project financial statements, BWDB will 
formally request the CAG to include the project audits in their yearly work plan through the 
ERD,  at  the  time  of  loan  negotiations.    To  support  timely  submission,  unaudited  project 
financial statements should be submitted to the CAG for audit within 3 months of the end of 
the fiscal year. 
1  Audit  standards  for  CAG  directorates  are  set  out  in  an  Audit  Manual  and  are  based  on  INTOSAI  and  Asian 
Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions standards.

Specific Audit Needs 
7. 
The  audit  would  cover  the  entire  project  i.e.  covering  all  sources  and  application  of 
funds, including the ADB, the cofinancer and the GOB. The Financing Arrangement as currently 
agreed  with  ADB,  includes  Direct  Payments  (DPs)  by  ADB  to  suppliers.  The  Project  Director 
shall  provide  all  pertinent  information  to  the  Auditors  including  preservation  and  use  of 
resources procured and its reflection in the project accounts, so as to facilitate comprehensive 
audit coverage. The audits should be carried out annually from commencement of the Project.  
8. 
The auditor will provide assurance as to whether the project financial statements present 
a  true  and  fair  view  of  the  receipts  and  expenditures,  or  are  presented  fairly,  in  all  material 
respects, in accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework. 
9. 
In  addition,  ADB  will  also  require  an  assessment  by  the  auditors  of  compliance  with 
provisions  of  the  financing  agreement  with  ADB,  especially  those  relating  to  accounting  and 
financial  matters.  Positive  assurance  should  be  provided  in  accordance  with  International 
Standard  of  Supreme  Audit  Institutions  –  4200  on  Financial  and  Compliance  Audit.    An  audit 
opinion shall be provided that will inter alia include verification that: 
(i) 
(ii) 
All  funds,  including  counterpart  funds,  have  been  used  in  accordance  with  the 
conditions  of  the  loan  agreements,  with  due  regard  to  economy  and  efficiency, 
and only for the purposes for which the funds were provided; 
The BWDB were in compliance as at [insert date] with all financial covenants of 
the loan agreement;  
(iii)  With  respect  to  SOEs,  (a)  adequate  supporting  documentation  has  been 
maintained to support claims to ADB for reimbursement of expenditures incurred; 
and (b) except for ineligible expenditures as detailed in the audit observations, if 
any,  appended  to this  audit  report,  expenditures  are  eligible for financing  under 
the Loan Agreement; 
The  Imprest  Account  gives  a  true  and  fair  view  of  the  receipts  collected  and 
payments  made  during  the  year  ended  [insert  date],  and  (ii)  these  receipts  and 
payments  support  the  Imprest  Account  Liquidation/  replenishments  during  the 
year 
(iv) 
10. 
ADB  would  expect  that  the  auditors  should  advise  a  calendar  for  discussion/review  of 
audit  observations  (particularly  any  serious  matters)  through  tri-partite  meetings  and  review 
meetings  to  facilitate  executive  follow-up  on  audit  observations  and  recommendations.  
Moreover, ADB would need a review of actions taken on the recommendations presented in the 
previous audit report on the progress made. 
D. 
Project Financial Statements (PFSs) 
11. 
The Project Annual Financial Statements (APFSs) shall be prepared in accordance with 
international accounting best principles and practices as well as government's accounting laws

The project financial statements shall also provide sufficient level of detail to be able to 
14. 
identify  expenditure  relating  to  each  of  the  three  outputs  of  the  project;  namely,  (i)  WMOs’ 
capacity  strengthened  for  sustainable  water  resources  planning  and  management  in  the 
subproject  areas, (ii)  infrastructure facilities of  FCD/I  schemes renovated,  and, (iii)  institutional 
capacity for sustainable participatory water resources planning and management strengthened.  
15. 
Draft  template  for  the  Financial  Statements  shall  be  provided  to  the  PMO  during 
implementation to ensure maximum alignment with Cash Basis International Public Accounting 
standards as well as conformity with IBAS.

have a significant impact on the implementation of the Project; and 
Bring  to  GOB  and  ADB  attention  any  other  matters  that  the  auditor  considers 
pertinent. 
The  auditor  should  also  make  follow-up  of  audit  recommendations  to  their 
conclusion. 
Serious  issues,  which  affect  the  auditor’s  opinion  as  to  whether  the  financial  statements 
19. 
give  a  true  and  fair  view,  should  be  referred  to  in  the  audit  opinion.  Management  Letter  should 
include only those issues which do not affect the fairness of the financial statements.   
Appendix 3

F. 
Management Representation Letter 
20. 
PMO  is  responsible  for  the  preparation  and  fair  presentation  of  the  project  financial 
statements  and  for  maintaining  sufficient  internal  control,  as  determined  necessary,  to  ensure 
that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
To this  end,  PMO  must  provide  the  auditor  with  a  ‘Management  Representation Letter’  with a 
copy to ADB. The Letter of Representation (Management Representation Letter) to the auditor 
will include the following:  
(i)

General 
21. 
Review  missions  and  normal  project  supervision  will  monitor  compliance  with  financial 
reporting  and  auditing  requirements  and  will  follow  up  with  concerned  parties,  including  the 
external auditor. 
22. 
ADB  has  made  BWDB  aware  of  ADB’s  approach  on  delayed  submission,  and  the 
requirements  for  satisfactory  and  acceptable  quality  of  the  audited  financial  statements3.  ADB 
reserves the right to require a change in the auditor (in a manner consistent with the constitution of 
the borrower, or for additional support to be provided to the auditor, if the audits required are not 
conducted in a manner satisfactory to ADB, or if the audits are substantially delayed.  
3   ADB approach on delayed submission of audited project financial statements:  
•  When audited project financial statements are not received by the due date, ADB will write to the executing agency 
advising  that  (i)  the  audit  documents  are  overdue;  and  (ii)  if  they  are  not  received  within  the  next  six  months, 
requests for new contract awards and disbursement such as new replenishment of imprest accounts, processing of 
new reimbursement, and issuance of new commitment letters will not be processed. 
•  When  audited  project  financial  statements  have  not  been  received  within  6  months  after  the  due  date,  ADB  will 
withhold processing of requests for new contract awards and disbursement such as new replenishment of imprest 
accounts,  processing  of  new  reimbursement,  and  issuance  of  new  commitment  letters.  ADB  will  (i)  inform  the 
executing agency of ADB’s actions; and (ii) advise that the loan may be suspended if the audit documents are not 
received within the next six months. 
•  When audited project financial statements have not been received within 12 months after the due date, ADB may 
suspend the loan. 
84 
Appendix 3 
ADB  retains  the  right  to  verify  or  have  audited  (i)  the  project  (ii)  the  validity  of  BWDB’s 
23. 
certification  for  each  withdrawal  application,  and  (iii)  that  ADB’s  financing  is  used  in  accordance 
with ADB’s policies and procedures.  
In  case  an  external  auditor  needs  to  be  commissioned  for  a  supplementary  audit,  the 
24. 
auditor should be given access to all legal documents, correspondences, and any other information 
associated with the commission and deemed necessary by the auditor. Confirmation should also 
be obtained of amounts disbursed and outstanding with ADB and the Government etc. 
H. 
Public Disclosure 
25. 
Public  disclosure  of  the  project  financial  statements,  including  the  audit  report  on  the 
project  financial  statements,  will  be  guided  by  ADB’s  Public  Communications  Policy  (2011)4.  
ADB will disclose the project financial statements for the project and the opinion of the auditors 
on the financial statements within 30 days of the date of their receipt by posting them on ADB’s 
website. The audit management letter and entity-level financial statements will not be disclosed. 
Note: This is a statement of audit needs for ADB and does not in any way intend to limit the scope of the statutory audit.

1.  BACKGROUND 
1.1   General 
1. 
The southwest area of 4 million ha (27% of the country’s total) covers the right bank of 
the Ganges and the Lower  Meghna rivers, with a population of 28.6 million (23%  of the total). 
The  region  contributes  21%  of  the  national  GDP.  With  its  sectoral  share  of  36%,  agriculture 
plays a dominant role, yet its productivity is lagging behind the national average. Paddy yields 
remain at 3.1 t/ha due mainly to the dominance of traditional varieties associated with the area’s 
susceptibility  to  flooding,  and  slower  expansion  of  irrigation  (38%  as  opposed  to  the  national 
average of 55% of net cultivated area). About 51% of the area’s population is poor, second to 
the  highest–the  northwest–among  the  country’s  four  main  regions.  As  to  water  resources,  the 
southwest  has  78  flood  control,  drainage/irrigation  (FCD/I)  systems  covering  1.1  million  ha.  It 
has the most acute water management problems in Bangladesh. Of particular concern is water 
shortage  due  to  reduced  inflow  into  the  Ganges  tributaries  and  associated  social  and 
environmental  hardships,  including  salinity  intrusion,  livelihood  loss,  and  environmental 
degradation. Other challenges include (i) the flood inflow from the Ganges in the monsoon and 
deterioration  of  existing  FCD/I  systems,  (ii)  drainage  congestion  and  sedimentation  of  tidal 
channels  caused  by  coastal  polder  construction  and  reduced  tidal  swept  volume,  (iii)  arsenic 
contamination  (highest  in  the  country),  and  (iv)  vulnerability  to  cyclones  and  t  idal  surges. 
Improving water management is critically needed in this region of the country. 
Infrastructure  deterioration  of  the  existing  FCD/I  schemes  has  been  a  chronic  issue, 
2. 
especially  for  large  scale  schemes.52  A  lack  of  users’  ownership  causes quick  deterioration  of 
structures. The absence of stakeholder participation results also in inefficient and non-pertinent 
planning and inefficient water uses. Managing critical water resource through an integrated and 
participatory  approach  is  essential  for  efficient  water  management,  the  sustainability  of  FCD/I 
schemes, and improved livelihood of the vulnerable poor, including women.  
3. 
The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  financed  for  participatory  water  management 
projects for small-scale schemes since 1995.53 They have demonstrated success on improved 
infrastructure  performance  through  operationalizing  beneficiary  participation  envisaged  in  the 
government’s  Guidelines  for  Participatory Water  Management.54  To  extend  the  integrated  and 
participatory water management to the large scale FCD/I schemes, in 2005 ADB approved $20 
million  equivalent  of  a  loan  for  the  current  Southwest  Area  Integrated  Water  Resources 
Planning and Management Project, with $12.5 million of cofinancing from the Government of the 
Netherlands.55  The  current  project  supports  establishment  of  participatory  water  management 
organizations  (WMOs)  with  the  inclusion  of  socially  disadvantaged  groups,  integrated  water 
resources  management  planning,  infrastructure  renovation,  and  coordinated  support  services 
for WMOs  in the  two  pilot  subprojects,  comprising  Narail  and  Chenchuri  Beel  FCD/I  schemes 
with a total area of 57,000 hectares (ha). The Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) is 
the executing agency.  
52  FCD/I schemes with command area above 1,000 ha are categorized large-scale in Bangladesh.  
53  For example, ADB. 1995. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan 
to the People’s Republic of Bangladesh for Small-Scale Water Resources Management Sector Project. Manila.  
54  Ministry of Water Resources. 2000. Guidelines for Participatory Water Management. Dhaka.

Grant 0036-BAN) 
92 
Appendix 5 
4. 
The  Southwest  project  successfully  demonstrated  that  the  participatory  approach  can 
improve  the  water  resources  management  of  large  FCD/I  schemes.  This  is  the  first  success 
case  for  large  schemes  among  several  trials  in  Bangladesh.  As  of  May  2015,  renovation  of 
water  management  infrastructure  in  the  two  targeted  subproject  areas  has  been  substantially 
completed with satisfactory achievements of anticipated targets. In total, 116 WMOs, consisting 
of 102 water management groups (WMGs) and 14 higher tier water management associations 
(WMAs),  have  been  organized,  trained  and effectively functioning  in  the  two subproject  areas. 
About  25,400  households  are  benefitted,  including  the  socially  disadvantaged  groups  like 
landless  farmers  and  women.  Capacity  enhancement  activities  for  WMOs  continued  till  June 
2015, and demonstrated visible vitalization of WMO activities in agriculture, fisheries, livestock, 
and  collective  livelihood  actions.  Operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  of  small  structures  have 
been handed over to WMOs, after development of O&M manuals and WMOs’ O&M capacity.  
5. 
BWDB  is  processing  a  proposed  additional  financing  for  the  Southwest  project  to 
replicate  the  successful  current  project  in  nine  additional  subproject  areas  with  a  total  area  of 
84,000  ha  with  the  population  of  about  469,500  in  the  southwest  region  of  the  country. ADB’s 
financial  support  for  the  proposed  additional  financing  is  included  in ADB’s  country  assistance 
program for 2015. A potential co-financing is under discussion. The proposed project provides a 
consultancy  package  for  institutional  strengthening  and  project  management  consultants 
(ISPMC).  BWDB  will  recruit  the  ISPMC  package  according to ADB’s  Guidelines  on the  Use of 
Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). 
1.2   Outline of the Proposed Additional Financing Project 
6. 
The  detailed  project  description  is  in  Appendix  1  of  this  TOR,  and  Appendix  2 
describes  subproject  implementation  procedures.  (Appendixes  1  and  2  of  the  PAM  will  be 
attached to the TOR.) The project comprises eleven subprojects in five administrative districts. 
The implementation of nine out of eleven subprojects will be covered by the project. Feasibility 
studies  along  with  integrated  water  management  plans  (IWMPs)  for  seven  out  of  the  nine 
subprojects  have  been  prepared  during  the  project  processing.  Feasibility  studies  and IWMPs 
for  the  two  out  nine  subproject  have  to  be  prepared  during  the  project,  before  the 
implementation of physical activities. The project will also cover feasibility studies along with the 
preparation of IWMPs for the two remaining subprojects, but will not include the implementation 
of the plans for these two subproject areas. The implementation of the two subprojects may be 
done  by  the  Government  of  Bangladesh  in  the  future.  The  following  tables  summarize  the 
subproject status, and administrative units under each subproject.

BWDB  under  the  Ministry  of  Water  Resources  is  the  executing  agency.  The  Project 
Management  Office  (PMO)  under  BWDB  will  be  led  by  the  full-time  project  director,  and  will 
manage  and  monitor  the  overall  implantation  of  the  project.  PMO  will  be  enhanced  by 
individuals directly engaged by PMO, such as research assistants and facilitators. The research 
94 
Appendix 5 
assistants will assist PMO for technical aspects including data processing and analyses. Senior 
and community facilitators will support agriculture extension officers’ roles including community 
mobilization and WMO support and capacity development. The Subproject Management Offices 
(SMOs) will manage and supervise day-to-day implementation of project activities in respective 
subproject  areas,  including  coordination  with  upazilla  and  union  level  institutions  and  local 
communities at subproject level. Four SMOs will be newly established at the level of subproject 
to implement nine subprojects as in Table 3. The Chanchuri Beel SMO was created under the 
current Southwest project, exclusively for the implementation of the Chenchiri Beel Subproject. 
The  SMO  will  be  shifted  from  Narail  to  Faridpur,  and  this  special  set-up  SMO  will  exclusively 
work for the proposed project. It will implement five out of nine subprojects. Other three SMOs 
will be built on the existing set-up of the concerned BWDB division O&M offices supplemented 
by required staff.  The three dual charge SMOs will implement the remaining four subprojects as 
indicated in Table 3. The ISPMC team will support PMO and SMOs.

Summary of Findings:  
Bangladesh has enforced a comprehensive procurement law – the Public Procurement Act, 
2006  (PPA  2006)  which  covers  all  types  of  procurement.  The  law  is  sought  to  ensure 
transparency  and  accountability  in  public  procurement  and  fairness  to  all  participants  in 
Government  purchases.  The  law  is  supported  by  Public  Procurement  Rules,  2008  (PPR 
2008)  which  provides  necessary  explanation  and  modality  of  application.  The  provisions  of 
the law and regulations are consistent with internationally accepted principles and practices. 
The  current  project  has  used  ADB’s  standard  bidding  documents  for  goods,  works  and 
consultancy services. Thus, the Act, Rule and Standard Bidding Documents provide a unified 
national procurement framework.  
Implementation  Monitoring  and  Evaluation  Division  (IMED)  is  the  central  and  apex 
1   The  original  assessments  were  conducted  by  the  PPTA  teams  for  the  Flood  and  Riverbank  Erosion  Risk 
Management  Investment  Program  (FRERMIP)  and  for  the  Irrigation  Management  Improvement  Project  (IMIP)  in 
2014. This report was prepared by the ADB staff consultant team for the Southwest Project additional financing, by 
updating  the  original  assessment  report.  This  document  will  become  one  of  attachments  of  the  Updated  Project 
Administration Manual.

organization  of  the  Government  for  Monitoring  and  Evaluation  (M&E)  of  public  sector 
development  projects  that  are  included  in  the  Annual  Development  Program  (ADP).  IMED 
also  deals  with  matters  relating  to  PPA.  The  Central  Procurement  Technical  Unit  (CPTU), 
established  under  IMED  in  2002,  acts  as  the  central  organ  of  Government  for  policy 
formulation,  coordination,  monitoring  and  improvement  of  the  public  procurement  process. 
The CPTU also has the authority to intervene in the bidding process if complaints are made 
by any or more bidders. It also acts to resolve such disputes or complaints. In February 2012,  
CPTU  has  introduced  the  web  based  procurement  system,  called  ‘Electronic  Government 
Procurement  (e-GP)  System’  that  provides  online  platform  for  carrying  out  procurement 
activities.  Presently,  some  16  units  under  four  Government  organizations  are  using  e-GP 
system  for  carrying  out  part  of  their  procurements  on  pilot  basis.  BWDB  is  one  of  the  four 
organizations.  
The status of the e-GP in four target agencies (RHD, LGED, BWDB and REB) is as follows: 
In  spite  of  existence  of  international  standard  law  and  regulation,  the  public  procurement 
regime  remains  somewhat  weak.  This  can  be  attributed  to  (i)  a  lack  of  understanding  of 
applicable  procurement  rules  and  regulations  among  officials  involved  in  procurement,  (ii) 
unwarranted intervention from local politician (iii) inadequate oversight capacity of regulatory 
authority and (iv) largely in effective system of appeals and review of procurement decisions. 
All  these  factors  appear  to  undermine  the  integrity  of  the  public  procurement  system. 
However,  as  Government  has  targeted  full  introduction  of  e-GP  System  over  the  next  few 
years, a meaningful oversight may be possible after the said system is fully introduced for all 
procurement  cases.  The  e-GP  system,  when  fully  introduced  will  generate  national 
procurement  database  as  by  product  paving  the  way  for  evaluation  of  effectiveness  of 
procurement framework. 
C. 
Organizational and Staff Capacity 
Risk Assessment: Low 
Summary of Findings:  
Bangladesh  Water  Development  Board.  BWDB  is  a  major  implementing  agency  of  the 
Government.  Since  its  creation  in 1959,  the  organization has  implemented  large number  of 
projects  including  big  and medium  sized  projects.  Most  of  the  major  and important  projects 
were implemented with external assistance; in fact, up to the year 2000, project aid used to 
exceed  Government  funding  in  BWDB  ADP.  As  of  2014,  eight  aided  projects  are  under 
implementation and cumulative project aid component constitutes 4.05% of ADP (BDT 9530 
million, $ US $ 123.77 million) for the fiscal year (2014-15).

Appendix 9 
129 
As is a major implementing agency, procurements constitute major activities of BWDB. The 
engineering  staffs  of  the  organization  are  quite  familiar  with  the  processes  of  all  types  of 
procurement i.e. goods, works and consulting services.  The donor agencies of water sector 
projects  constitute  agencies  of  friendly  governments,  international  agencies  and  financial 
institutions. As most of donor agencies had imposed their own procurement policy and rules 
in  respective  aided  project,  BWDB  staffs  are  also  familiar  with  procurement  rules  and 
procedures of major donor agencies. 
Over the decade long water sector reform initiatives beginning mid-1990s, BWDB underwent 
a staff reduction (mostly supporting staff) as well as complete halt on new recruitment in all 
categories. This put a strain on implementation capacity due to shortage of staff in the junior 
ranks.  Only,  since  2005,  Government  lifted  ban  and  new  recruitment  has  now  become 
regular  phenomenon.  Moreover,  a  proposal  for  increasing  staff  strength  of  BWDB  is  under 
final  stage  of  approval  process.  However,  BWDB  is  facing  the  problem  arising  out  of 
departure  of  significant  number  of  new  engineering  recruits  within  initial  years.  As  of  2014,  
88  young  engineers  recruited  in  2005,  43  left  the  organization.  This  phenomenon  requires 
carrying out induction repeatedly. 
Project Management Office (PMO). The present PMO was established in August 2006 for 
implementing the current Southwest Integrated Water Resources Management and Planning 
Project  (SAIWRMPP).  The  same  PMO  has  been  working  for  processing  the  proposed 
additional  financing  project.  It  will  also  continue  to  manage  the  implementation  of  the 
proposed project, and key staff will continue their assignment. The key staffs are familiar with 
ADB procurement and disbursement procedures and have practical working experience.  
Some  of  the  professional  staffs  possess  substantial  direct  procurement  experience.  The 
present  Project  Director,  who  is  experienced  in  ADB  procurement,  will  retire  at  around  the 
expected loan effectiveness. However, it is agreed that the present PMO will be strengthened 
by immediate assignment of a new Project Director and by continuation of other key staffs. A 
competent BWDB official at the rank of Superintending Engineer or higher with procurement 
proficiency  and  other  management  capacity  will  be  assigned  as  the  Project  Director.  Thus, 
the  capacity  of  PMO  in  respect  of  procurement  activities  will  continue  to  be  at  satisfactory 
level. Moreover, any capacity gap may be filled with provision of a procurement specialist in 
the team of implementation support consultant. 
The designation of the existing PMO key staffs is as follows:  
  Mr. Kamalur Talukder, Project Director (August 2011):  
  Mr. Md. Anisul Islam, EE (October 2012):  
  Mr. Sk Nazrul Islam, EE (June 2011) 
  Mr. Abu Raihan Md. Al-Biruni, Asstt. Engineer (August 2013) 
  Mr. Abu Sale Md. Tofahel Chowdhury, Sub Divisional Engineer (July 2010) 
  Mr. Md. Humayoun Kabir, Accounts officer (May 2009)  
  Mr. Md. Masud Karim, PEO (June 2010)  
  Mr. Md. Hafizur Rahman, Extension Officer (August 2007) 
  Mr. Md. Amimul Ehsan, Asstt. Chief  (Fishery) (July 2010) 
  Mr. Md. Abdur Razzak, AC (Sociology) (January 2008) 
  Mr. Md. Alamgir, Research Officer (August 2007)  
  Mr. Md. Monirul Islam, EE/SMO  Chenchuri Beel Subproject (September 2011)  
The above mentioned key staff are expected to continue with the additional financing.

Information Management 
Risk Assessment: Information Management – Moderate 
Summary of Findings: 
Procurement  records  are  maintained  at  the  respective  procuring  units  for  longer  periods 
beyond  project  implementation.  Records are kept  in  paper/physical  files.  As the  information 
are  not  maintained  in  a  structured  manner,  instant  retrieval  is  difficult.  Moreover,  shifting 
office  location  sometimes  causes  loss  or  misplacement  of  files  and  thereby  loss  of  vital 
information. 
E. 
1. 
Procurement Practices 
Procurement of Goods and Works 
Risk Assessment: Low 
Summary of Findings: 
Procurements  of  goods  and  works  under  aided  projects  are  quite  frequent  in  BWDB  as  a 
number  of  such  projects  used  to  be  in  the  annual  development  program  portfolio.  In  most 
cases,  procurement  is  carried  out  following  guidelines  of  concerned  donor  agencies.  The 
national procurement framework is also in line with international practice. Following national 
guidelines  leads  to  similar  outcomes  as  following  donor  guidelines.  Under  NCB,  bidding 
process  can  be  completed  by  4  months.  However,  guidelines  of  donor  dictates  little  longer 
timeline  at  each  stage  of  bidding  process,  and    thereby  requires  about  50%  more  time  to 
complete bidding process.  
2. 
Consulting Services 
Risk Assessment: Procurement Practices – Moderate 
Summary of Findings: 
During project implementation, implementation support consultancy service will be required. 
In  addition,  NGO  services  will  be  required  for  resettlement  plan  implementation.  As  these 
services are required for developing and application of innovative methods and procedures, 
recruiting qualified consultant will be challenging.  
Procurement of consulting services is not as frequent as the procurement of goods or works. 
Time  required  for  service  procurement  is  much  longer.  Evaluation  of  expression  of  interest 
(EOI)  and  proposal  evaluation  requires  special  skill.  Usually  planning  offices  carryout 
consulting  service  procurement.  BWDB  have  experience  of  recruiting  international  and 
national consulting services, but may not be enough for this project. Need careful review of 
recruitment documents.  
F. 
Effectiveness 
Risk Assessment:  Low 
Summary of Findings: 
The  institutional  arrangement  and  practice  appear  to  be  generally  adequate  for  making 
Appendix 9 
131 
procurement effectively. 
G. 
Accountability Measures 
Risk Assessment: Low 
Summary of Findings: 
Adequate  process  control  and  oversight  mechanism  is  established  in  the  national 
procurement  framework  and  organizational  practice.  There  is  no  provision  and  practice 
opposed to the ADB procurement guidelines. 
All  required  procurements  are  detailed  out  in  approved  development  project  proposal/ 
proforma (DPP). Thereafter, no additional approval is required for initiating and carrying out 
procurement  except  approval  bid  evaluation  from  competent  authority  as  per  delegation  of 
financial  power.    Draft  bid  document,  when  exceeded  certain  cost  ceiling  have  to  be 
approved  by  Director  General.  In  the  process,  the  draft  is  reviewed  by  Director,  Central 
Procurement  Cell  which  acts  as  knowledge  procurement  knowledge  hub.  This  eliminates 
associated risk to great extent.  
Summary Assessment 
Overall Risk Rating: Low 
National  procurement  environment  is  founded  on  sound  legal  procedural  framework  and  is 
generally is conducive for making effective procurement under the project. The EA i.e. BWDB 
is  quite  experienced  in  procurement  of  goods,  works  -  both  for  exclusively  government 
funded project as well as aided project. But their capacity is somehow limited for procurement 
of  consulting  services.  There  is  a  wide  variation  of  degree  of  knowledge  and  experience 
among  individual  staff  member  on  procurement process and issues.  Personnel  assigned to 
the  project,  especially  those  who  will  be  dealing  with  procurement  may  need  undergoing 
orientation  training  on  ADB  procurement  guidelines  and  procedures.  Another  weakness 
about  BWDB  is  that  they  does  not  maintain  central  database  of  procurement.  Such 
information,  if  existed  centrally,  could  help  quick  checking  of  bidders  qualification  and 
experience thereby lessening bid evaluation time as well as avoiding misinformation.
