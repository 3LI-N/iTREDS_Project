PROJECT AT A GLANCE 
JFPR Project Administration Manual Purpose and Process 
The  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  (JFPR)  project  administration  manual  (PAM)  describes  the 
essential administrative and management requirements to implement the JFPR-funded project on time, 
within budget, and in accordance with the government and Asian Development Bank (ADB) policies and 
procedures. The JFPR PAM should include references to all available templates and instructions either 
through linkages to relevant URLs or directly incorporated in the JFPR PAM. 
The National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) is wholly responsible for the implementation of 
the  project,  as  agreed  jointly  between  the  grant  recipient  and  ADB,  and  in  accordance  with  the 
government  and  ADB’s  policies  and  procedures.  ADB  staff  is  responsible  to  support  implementation 
including  compliance  by  the  NEMA  Office  of  the  Chief  and  Department  of  Policy  Coordination  and 
Cooperation of their obligations and responsibilities for project implementation in accordance with ADB’s 
policies and procedures. 
NEMA and ADB shall agree to the JFPR PAM and ensure consistency with the grant agreement. In the 
event  of  any  discrepancy  or  contradiction  between  the  JFPR  PAM  and  the  grant  agreement,  the 
provisions of the grant agreement shall prevail. 
After  ADB  Board  approval  of  the  project's  grant  assistance  report  (GAR)  changes  in  implementation 
arrangements  are  subject  to  agreement  and  approval  pursuant  to  relevant  government  and  ADB 
administrative procedures (including ADB’s Project Administration Instructions) and upon such approval 
they will be subsequently incorporated in the JFPR PAM. 
A. 
Project Rationale 
I. 
PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
The  project  aims  to  strengthen  community  resilience  to  disaster  risk  by  piloting  a 
1. 
mechanism  to  establish  community-based  disaster  risk  management  (CBDRM)  plans  for 
collective  action  by  bagh1  neighborhood  groups.  The  project  will  focus  on  risks  of  dzuds2  and 
forest and steppe fires in four target aimags3 – Dornod, Gobi-Altai, Khuvsgul and Sukhbaatar. 
The project is proposed as a grant and will be implemented tentatively between 2016 and 2019. 
Project activities, based on a pro-poor, participatory approach, will directly benefit 7,000 herders 
and soum4 center residents in 2,500 households, including 250 female-headed households; and 
indirectly  benefit  the  wider  community  in  target  soums,  with  a  total  population  of  32,000.  The 
project  will  be  the  first  in  Mongolia  to  introduce  and  pilot  a  bottom-up  institutionalized 
mechanism for the involvement of communities in disaster risk management (DRM).5  
2. 
Mongolia’s  harsh  climate,  poorly  developed  infrastructure,  persistent  poverty,  limited 
institutional  capacity,  and  nomadic  herding  lifestyle  increase  risk  of  loss  of  livelihood  and 
damage  to  the  ecosystem  and  environment  due  to  natural  and  anthropogenic  causes  of 
hazards.  The  proposed  project  will  increase  resilience  of  targeted  rural  communities  and 
broader government capacity to selected natural hazards in Mongolia. 
3. 
Dzuds  and  forest  and  steppe  fires  are  among  the  potentially  most  damaging  natural 
hazards in Mongolia. Recurring dzuds and droughts over the last decade have affected much of 
the rural population. The 2009‒2010 dzud resulted in losses of 25% of Mongolia’s total livestock 
population  affecting  livelihoods  of  97,000  poor  herder  households.  Further,  extreme  weather 
was  experienced  during  the  November  2015–April  2016  winter  dzud,  with  90%  of  the  country 
covered with snow and temperatures of –50° Celsius, devastating grazing conditions for herders 
and  their  livestock,  already  reeling  from  the  severe  2015  summer  drought  that  led  to  a  40% 
reduction  in  wheat  production  and  grazing  pasture.  According  to  United  Nations,  over  41%  of 
Mongolia’s herder population was affected and 1.1 million livestock perished in the recent dzud.6 
4. 
While dzud is purely a natural climate phenomenon, forest and steppe fires are caused 
by  natural  and  anthropogenic  factors.  Beyond  lightning,  frequent  causes  of  forest  and  steppe 
fires  are  human  activity  ranging  from  vehicle  sparks  to  cooking  ash  to  improperly  disposed 
cigarette  butts  to  hunter  tracer  bullets.  Forest  and  steppe  fires  threaten  herders  and 
ecosystems,  claiming  lives  of  poorly  equipped  firefighters,  community  members  and  livestock. 
Forest  fires  contribute  to  an  estimated  loss  of  60,000  hectares  (ha)  of  forest  per  annum.  In 
heavily  forested  areas  of  the  country,  such  as  Tsagaan-Uur  soum  in  Khuvsgul,  impacts  are 
magnified: in 2012 a major forest fire covering an area of about 120 kilometers burned over 70% 
1   Sub-district. 
2   Dzud is a Mongolian term for a severe winter in which large number of livestock die, primarily due to starvation due 
to being unable to graze, in other cases directly from the cold.

5  Disaster  risk  management  is  a  process  for  designing,  implementing,  and  evaluating  strategies,  policies,  and 
measures  to  improve  the  understanding  of  disaster  risk,  foster  disaster  risk  reduction  and  transfer,  and  promote 
continuous improvement in disaster preparedness, response, and recovery practices, within the explicit purpose of 
increasing  human  security,  well-being,  quality  of  life,  and  sustainable  development  (Intergovernmental  Panel  on 
Climate Change).

Nations Humanitarian team as of 18 May 2016.

of  its  forests.  Steppe  fires  spread  quicker  and wider  causing  significant  losses  of  pastureland, 
livestock,  gers  and  other  assets.  In  2015,  Matad  soum  (Dornod)  saw  15  steppe  fire  incidents 
covering  1.8  million  ha  of  pastureland  causing  an  estimated  direct  damage  and  ecological 
damage of MNT5.1 billion; 30% of Munkhkhaan soum’s (Sukhbaatar) territory (over 200,000 ha) 
burned as a result of 13 incidents in 2015.7  
5. 
Climate  change  is  expected  to  result  in  more  intense  and  extreme  weather  events, 
increasing fire activity and decreasing the quality of fragile ecosystems and potentially resulting 
in more loss of life and assets. Annual mean air temperature over Mongolia has increased by 
2.07° Celsius between 1940 and 2014, with the 10 warmest years in the last 70 years occurring 
since  1997.8  Annual  precipitation  has  decreased  over  the  same  period  and  seasonal  rainfall 
patterns have changed, with a gradual increase in winter precipitation and decrease in summer 
rain in some regions. Forest cover has decreased from 13% to 8% over the past decade. The 
frequency of extreme weather has doubled in the last 2 decades and is expected to increase by 
23‒60%  by  the  middle  of  the  21st  century  compared  to  present  conditions;  frequency  and 
spatial  extent  of  forest  and  steppe  fires  have  also  increased  since  the  early  1950s.9  Climate 
projections suggest extreme weather and fire trends will continue with adverse implications for 
human health, natural resources, arable farming and animal husbandry.  
6. 
DRM  strategy  and  approach.  The  Government  of  Mongolia  (GOM)  has  developed  a 
legal framework, strategy and action plan for DRM, underpinned by the 2003 Law of Mongolia 
on  Disaster Protection, 2011  State  Policy  and  Program  on  Disaster  Protection  Capacity,  2012 
Law  on  Forest  and  the  2015  Fire  Safety  Law.  Although  current  laws  and  policies  offer  a 
framework  for  disaster  prevention  at  national  and  local  levels,  they  predominantly  focus  on 
disaster  preparedness and  emergency  response.  A  much-needed  shift  in  practice is  occurring 
towards  a  more  holistic  approach  emphasizing  disaster  risk  reduction  (DRR)  and  community 
engagement as well as emergency response. The relatively newly introduced National Program 
of  Community  Participatory  DRR,  approved  in  2015,  builds  on  GOM’s  intention  to  develop  a 
CBDRM approach. Successful implementation and operationalization of CBDRM will require the 
development  of  a  bottom-up  participatory  mechanism  at  the  local  level  to  reflect  specific 
circumstances  and  needs  of  individual  communities,  and  encourage,  facilitate  and  manage 
voluntary collective action. 
7. 
Local level DRM capacity. There are significant challenges in implementing local DRM 
due to equipment and resource constraints. Aimag-level administrations have low capability to 
reduce  vulnerability  and  organize  quick  and  effective  responses  to  hazard  events,  in  part 
because  they  are  often  too  far  from  the  scene  of  a  disaster.  Hence,  they  are  dependent  on 
soum level administrations and bagh residents, who have even less capacity. At the soum level, 
financial,  human  and  technical  resources  to  reduce  vulnerability,  improve  search  and  rescue, 
and  provide  acceptable  emergency  services  are  inadequate.  Individual  communities  similarly 
have limited access to relevant tools and capabilities for fire prevention and fighting, including at 
the household level, and insufficient infrastructure to manage dzud and other extreme weather 
events. In consequence, communities remain highly vulnerable to natural hazards. 
8. 
Institutional  setup.  Although  there  are  plenty  of  government  actors  responsible  for 
7   Soum governor’s office data, verified by Dornod Local Emergency Management Agency.

DRM, efforts have been poorly coordinated due to lack of technical capabilities, untimely due to 
inadequate  technology  for  hazard  mapping  and  communication,  and  narrowly  focused  around 
emergency response. The State Emergency Commission (SEC) is the primary body responsible 
for DRM in Mongolia. Chaired by the Deputy Prime Minister, with members from key ministries, 
it  is  activated  in  response  to  emergencies  to  lead  response  and  mobilize  funds  required  for 
response, recovery, and rehabilitation. The National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) 
is the operational arm supporting SEC, including in roles of interdepartmental and interagency 
planning, oversight, coordination and direct support in the event of a disaster. NEMA is present 
in the capital and, through its branch office Local Emergency Management Agencies (LEMAs), 
in  all  21  aimags.  It  has  around  3,200  emergency  personnel  across  Mongolia  and  access  to 
emergency  resources. The LEMAs function as implementing agencies under  aimag governors 
and are responsible for leading DRM in their administrative areas. Soum volunteer groups form 
the  lowest  level  of  DRM  administration.  Despite  having  wide  geographic  and  administrative 
presence, the current DRM institutional apparatus – NEMA, LEMAs and soum governor offices 
– lacks capacity, equipment, and funding constraints. Moreover, skill sets are orientated largely 
around emergency response, while there is limited knowledge about DRR or CBDRM. 
9. 
 Strategic fit. The proposed project seeks to support Dornod, Gobi-Altai, Khuvsgul and 
Sukhbataar aimags in strengthening dzud and forest and steppe fire risk management capacity 
of  national,  aimag  and  soum  level  administration,  and  local  communities.  It  is  designed  to 
complement  Asian  Development  Bank’s  (ADB)  support  for  the  2015-2016  dzud,  during  which 
more than 3% of livestock in each of Dornod, Gobi-Altai and Khuvsgul aimags died, by aiming to 
increase  midterm  and  long-term  resilience  through  the  introduction  and  implementation  of 
innovative  localized  DRM  actions  to  reduce  vulnerability  and  strengthen  response  capacity  of 
herders  and  other  local  communities.  The  project  is  consistent  with  ADB’s  Interim  Country 
Partnership Strategy for Mongolia, 2014–2016,10 which states that climate-related disasters with 
high  socioeconomic  costs  (particularly  for  herders)  have  doubled  in  frequency.  It  will 
complement  NEMA’s  efforts  to  implement  the  2015  National  Program  of  Community 
Participatory DRR. It converges with ADB’s Operational Plan for Integrated DRM, 2014–202011 
that  aims  to  operationalize  DRM  and  strengthen  developing  member  countries’  DRM 
capabilities, knowledge, and resources to reduce disaster risk and respond to disaster events in 
a  timely,  cost-efficient  manner;  and  ADB’s  Operational  Plan  for  Agriculture  and  Natural 
Resources,  2015-2020  that  aims  to  enhance  management  and  climate  resilience  of  natural 
resources.12  The  project  is  proposed  as  a  grant  based  on  GOM’s  pro-poor,  community-based 
approach and included in ADB’s pipeline as 2016 firm.13  
Sector  context.  Significant  development  partner  engagement  in  DRM  in  Mongolia 
10. 
began  in  response  to  the  1999‒2002  dzud,  in  which  8.8  million  livestock  perished.  This  has 
since  evolved  into  a  broader  DRM  approach,  going  beyond  top  down  emergency  actions  and 
immediate preparedness. In the aftermath of the 1999‒2002 dzud, United Nations Development 
Programme (UNDP) began the first phase of a project on Disaster Mitigation and Management 
System  in  Mongolia  (2002),  based  on  a  lesson-learning  event  from  the  dzud.  This  program  is 
now  in  its  fourth  phase  and  has  focused  particularly  on  strengthening  capacity  building, 
planning,  coordination,  and  awareness-raising.  Other  partners,  in  particular  the  Swiss  Agency 
for  Development  and  Cooperation  (SDC)  and  World  Bank,  have  supported  initiatives

strengthening  pasture  risk  management  and  sustainable  livelihoods  in  rural  areas  to  enhance 
dzud  risk  management  and  have  established  an  index-based  livestock  insurance  program  to 
cover  herders  against  dzud-related  livestock  mortality.  There  is  further  opportunity  to  work 
towards midterm and long-term resilience of communities to disaster risk. 
11. 
Lessons.  The  project  design  has  incorporated  lessons  from  international  and  national 
best  practices  in  DRM  and  Poverty  Reduction  through  Community-Based  Natural  Resource 
Management,  Establishment  of  Climate-Resilient  Rural  Livelihoods  and  Dzud  Disaster 
Response Projects,14 such as the importance of: (i) operationalizing mechanisms for voluntary 
collective  action  of  herder  communities  improves  efforts  in  CBDRM;  (ii)  forming  community 
groups  from  a  livelihood-agnostic  perspective  so  that  they  sit  within  formal  government  DRM 
structures and plans, and can take a multi-hazard approach; (iii) moving away from the existing 
focus  on  disaster  response  capabilities  to  a  more  holistic  one  emphasizing  DRR;  and  (iv) 
closing  the  gap  on  national  and  local  government  and  community  capacity,  equipment  and 
funding  constraints  for  DRM,  including  limited  access  to  relevant  fire  prevention  and  fighting 
tools and insufficient infrastructure to manage extreme weather events.  
B. 
Impact and Outcome  
12. 
The  expected  project  impacts  are:  (i)  enhanced  national  safety  through  risk  and 
vulnerability  reduction,  and  strengthened  disaster  management;  and  (ii)  strengthened  disaster 
resilience in developing member countries. The expected outcome is strengthened capacity of 
local bagh residents and national and local DRM administration units to manage risks from dzud 
and forest and steppe fires.  
C. 
Outputs and Key Activities  
13. 
Output  1:  Bagh  neighborhood  group  CBDRM  action  plans  prepared.  Output  1  will 
focus  on  operationalizing  CBDRM  at  soum  and  bagh  level,  involving  bagh  neighborhoods 
(including  households  in  soum  centers).  Under  this  output:  (i)  100  bagh  neighborhood  groups 
across  the  12  project  soums  will  be  formed  (ii)  bagh-level  disaster  risk  assessments  will  be 
conducted based on (a) community consultations with bagh neighborhood groups to understand 
local disaster risk perceptions, coping mechanisms and approaches and (b) existing secondary 
disaster and climate-risk information; (iii) gender inclusive training and awareness activities for 
CBDRM, especially for poor and vulnerable groups, will be conducted; and (iv) CBDRM action 
plans for bagh neighborhood groups in project soums will be developed, (a) identifying localized 
infrastructure  and  equipment  needs,  communication  protocols,  training  needs  and  emergency 
actions and (b) prioritizing actions for implementation under the project.  
Output  2:  Small-scale  infrastructure,  equipment,  and  technology  for  disaster 
14. 
resilience piloted. Output 2 will focus on equipping communities adequately with infrastructure, 
equipment and technology for increased resilience to  dzuds and forest and steppe fires risks at 
bagh and soum levels. Under this output: (i) small-scale disaster and climate resilient structures, 
such as improved fodder storage warehouses and livestock shelters and firebreaks will be built by 
bagh  neighborhood  groups,  using  locally  sourced  materials  where  possible;  (ii)  wells  will  be

rehabilitated  or  constructed  in  areas  with  high  risk  of  drought  and  dzud  for  use  by  bagh 
neighborhood  groups;  (iii)  demonstrations  for  building  small-scale  structures  emphasizing 
concepts of  collective community ownership and sustainable operation and  maintenance will be 
conducted for bagh neighborhood group beneficiaries; (iv) bagh neighborhood groups will receive 
packages  of  firefighting  tools,  such  as  handheld  blowers,  water  tanks  and  personal  protective 
gear.  Two  pilot  demonstrations  will  be  conducted:  (i)  rehabilitation  of  low-capacity  community 
irrigation systems for vegetable growing and haymaking in a Gobi-Altai soum to demonstrate the 
link  between  sustainable  alternative  livelihood  options  and  increased  disaster  resilience;  and  (ii) 
design  and  piloting  of  a  forest  fire  early  warning  system  in  two  Khuvsgul  soums,  to  support 
timelier, more effective response to fire outbreak and reduce loss of life and assets. 
15. 
Output  3:  CBDRM  capacity  of  NEMA,  LEMAs,  and  soum  administrations 
strengthened.  Output  3  will  focus  on  improving  capacity  of  NEMA,  LEMAs,  and  soum 
administrations for supporting and carrying out CBDRM. Under this output: (i) trainings will be 
designed and delivered to (a) soum administration, LEMA, and NEMA staff on the role of bagh 
neighborhood  groups  in  disaster  resilience,  and  (b)  NEMA  and  LEMA  trainers  on  concepts  of 
disaster  resilience  and  CBDRM;  (ii)  NEMA’s  geographic  information  system  (GIS)  capabilities 
will  be  built  through  (a)  upgrading  of  the  current  disaster  database,  including  communications 
capacity  among  NEMA,  LEMAs,  and  soums,  and  (b)  training  of  NEMA  and  LEMA  staff  on 
system  use  and  application  of  remote  sensing;  (iii)  risk  reduction  and  emergency  response 
equipment  will  be  provided  for  improved  communication,  search  and  rescue,  and  unblocking 
road access to remote areas. Priority needs will be identified together with NEMA, LEMAs, local 
emergency  commission  and  soum  governors’  offices.  Project  lessons  will  be  disseminated  to 
showcase experience, successes and lessons learned through (i) developing and implementing 
a  project  communication  outreach  strategy,  including  site  visits,  (ii)  hosting  an  end-of-project 
project symposium, and (iii) developing knowledge products.  
16. 
The project will take a phased approach: CBDRM action plans prepared under Output 1 
will identify small-scale infrastructure and response capacity needs to be developed and piloted 
under Output 2, and scope of training needs under Output 3. Once bagh neighborhood group 
action plans are endorsed by bagh governors, infrastructure, equipment, and technology needs 
identified and prioritized in the action plans in Output 1 will be implemented under Output 2.  
17. 
Project  management.  NEMA  lacks  the  personnel  and  resources  needed  to  fully 
implement the project. The grant proceeds will: (i) establish the administrative framework for the 
project, including a project steering committee (PSC) and project implementation unit (PIU); and 
(ii) finance the specialist support and PIU operational costs required to implement Outputs 1–3. 
18. 
Sustainability,  scalability  and  replicability.  Sustainable  design  measures  include 
community-based  participatory  approaches  to  DRM,  holistic  top-down  and  bottom-up  planning 
processes, the integration of long-term multi-hazard DRM planning into soum emergency plans 
and LEMA operations, capacity building at all administrative levels and simple replicable models 
for disaster and climate-resilient facilities and emergency response mechanisms. Under Output 
1  CBDRM  action  plans  prepared  by  neighborhood  groups  in  each  bagh  will  be  submitted  to 
soum  administration  for  integration  with  soum  emergency  response  plans,  reviewed  and 
renewed  at  project  completion.  Under  Output  2  small-scale  infrastructure  provided  to  bagh 
neighborhood  groups  to  implement  their  DRM  plan  will  last  for  at  least  20  years  beyond  the 
project.  Under  Output  3,  strengthened  CBDRM  and  rapid  response  capabilities  in  NEMA  and 
LEMAs are in close alignment with GOM’s aim to develop a more comprehensive and vertically 
integrated DRM approach. Given the pilot nature of the grant, many activities have potential for 
replication  and  scale-up  to  other  areas.  In  particular:  (i)  the  process  for  developing  and 
6 
implementing  community-based  DRM  plans  by  bagh  neighborhood  groups  can  be  rolled-out 
across Mongolia; (ii) the pilot early warning system for forest fires can later be scaled-up in all 
Khuvsgul soums as well as other forested aimags; and (iii) improvements to the NEMA disaster 
database can be expanded to be used by LEMAs in non-project aimags and by other agencies.

19. 
The  project  will  be  implemented  over  a  period  of  3  years  from  November  2016  to 
October  2019.15  NEMA  will  be  the  executing  agency.  It  will  establish  a  project  implementation 
unit (PIU) at its Policy Coordination and Cooperation Department (PCCD). The PIU, supported 
by  a  team  of  full-time  staff  and  part-time  consultants,  will  support  the  executing  agency  to 
implement  the  project.  NEMA  branches  at  the  aimags  (LEMAs)  will  work  closely  with  aimag 
governors’ offices to utilize existing institutional structures and resources (including experts from 
Ministry  of  Health,  Ministry  of  Environment  and  Tourism  (MET),  and  Ministry  of  Food  and 
Agriculture (MoFA). Soum governor office capacity will be leveraged for implementation at soum 
and bagh levels. 
The PIU will be responsible for daily implementation of the project. The PIU will comprise 
20. 
a  team  of  full-time  and  part-time  consultants  recruited  for  the  project,  including  a  project 
coordinator,  a  disaster  risk  management  specialist  (deputy  manager),  finance  specialist, 
procurement officer, a soum field officer to coordinate the project in each of the 12 soums in the 
project, a social and gender specialist, monitoring and evaluation specialist and other short term 
technical specialist consultants. The PIU  will represent the executing agency and  will lead the 
coordination,  planning,  and  implementation  of  the  project  targets  and  requirements  for 
administration,  monitoring,  and  reporting.  The  PIU  team  will  be  based  at  NEMA’s  offices  in 
Ulaanbaatar. 
21. 
A project steering committee (PSC) will be established by the Chief of NEMA’s office to 
provide  oversight  to  the  xecuting  agency  and  PIU  during  project  implementation.  It  will  be 
chaired by the Chief of NEMA. Its members will include representatives of Ministry of Finance 
(MOF),  MET, MOFA and (4) project aimag governors. The PIU project coordinator may be an 
ex-officio  member.  Embassy  of  Japan  project  coordinator  (EOJ),  ADB  and  relevant 
development  partners  will  be  invited  to  participate  as  observers.  The  PSC  will  review  and 
assess project implementation progress and plans, and will advise on policy matters related to 
the project, and meet at least semi-annually. 
22. 
The PIU will work with other government agencies as required, and target communities. 
In  particular,  two  other  agencies  will  play  a  role  in  the  project,  as  follows:  (i)  MET  will  bring 
expertise  and  regulatory  authority  in  forestry;  and  (ii)  MOFA  will  bring  expertise  in  veterinary 
science and livestock management.

Cost estimates include the purchase of one car and twelve motorbikes for project use. 
There is strong justification for the purchase of vehicles: (i) there are 12 project sites across 4 
far flung aimags in the eastern and western parts of the country; (ii) all project areas are located 
a long distance from Ulaanbaatar; (iii) there will be frequent transport (a trip to each of the 12 
soums across the 4 aimags once every quarter at the minimum and from time to time for special 
consultations,  monitoring  of  certain  activities,  etc.)  of  project  staff  and  equipment  between 
Ulaanbaatar and the project areas; (iii) the project is working across 12 soums and where there 
is  little  public  transport  –  project  vehicles  will  be  critical  for  implementation;  and  (iv)  vehicle 
rental  over  3  years  would  be  more  expensive  than  purchase.  Upon  project  completion  and  in 
accordance with ADB’s guidelines, the project car will be handed over to one of the LEMAs in 
the four project aimags, and the motorbikes to either each of the 12 soum governor’s offices or 
the  LEMAs  or  local  fire  units  in  the  four  amags,  for  use  for  emergency  response  and  disaster 
resilience. The executing agency has been informed on conditions and use of the PIU vehicle 
which are specifically for the use of PIU staff to get to project site, monitor project activities and 
attend project-related meetings. At the end of the project, ownership of the project vehicle and 
12 motorbikes will be transferred to LEMAs or local firefighting units within one of the 4 project 
aimags.  Specific  details  will  be  determined  at  project  completion.  NEMA  will  suggest  which 
LEMA or fire units along with adequare justification for ADB / JFPR approval.

Administrative Budget Support. Administrative budget support of 3% of the total grant 
amount  ($90,000),  exclusive  from  the  project  grant,  will  be  provided  given  the  unusual 
complexity  of  the  project  (local  bagh-level  activities  in  12  very  remote  and  far  away  soums) 
which  warrants  additional  resources  beyond  those  provided  by  the  regular  administration 
25 
budget. This budget will be financed from the JFPR administrative budget, not from the project 
grant.  The  administrative  budget  support  will  be  used  to  (i)  hire  a  staff  consultant  to  provide 
overall support to ADB as well as the government’s EA in project implementation, if and when 
needed and deemed necessary by the implementing project officer, to (a) monitor and evaluate 
activities and project progress beyond the regular progress checks conducted by the ADB staff 
team and resources, (b) evaluate status and progress of the bagh neighborhood CBDRM action 
plans,  (c)  monitor  the  project’s  outreach  to  the  intended  beneficiaries,  (d)  conduct  periodical 
community  level  consultations;  (e)  review  performances  of  the  project  executing  agency,  PIU 
and  consultants  to  ensure  intended  outputs  are  delivered  on  time;  (ii)  knowledge  product 
development  and  dissemination,  including  a  written  impact  report,  multi-media  story  (video  or 
pictorial),  and  organization  of  the  final  project  completion  symposium  for  showcasing  success 
and  sharing  lessons  learnt;  and  (iii)  facilitate  community  participation  or  CSO  collaboration  in 
consultations,  field  activities,  or  the  final  project  completion  symposium  planned.  Final  details 
will be confirmed during inception.   
27. 
The special administrative budget support will be administered by ADB. The processing 
and  implementing  project  officer  will  manage  and  track  the  utilization  of  the  administration 
budget support and will provide the Office of Cofinancing Operations (OCO) on a periodic basis 
(annual)  an  update  of  its  utilization.  Any  deviation  from  the  proposed  expenditures  should  be 
consulted with, and endorsed by OCO.

time.  Detailed  terms  of  reference  will  be  prepared  after  inception  to 
match  requirements.  Staff  consultants  will  be  recruited  according  to 
ADB’s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (April  2013,  and  as 
amended from time to time).  
Knowledge  development  and  information  dissemination  (knowledge 
products  and  symposium)  –  to  organize  in-country  project  completion 
symposium to disseminate project outcomes, in particular, best practices 
and  lessons  learned  for  community-based  disaster  risk  management. 
Development  of  knowledge  products  and  communication  materials  will 
include written output (such as an impact report, “before and after” story) 
and possibly a multi-media story (a video of the beneficiary communities 
or pictorial). Up to 5 resource persons may be engaged for this.  
Facilitate community participation or CSO collaboration in consultations, 
field  activities  or  the  final  project  completion  symposium  planned.  This 
may  include  supporting  traveling  and  per  diem  for  participation  of  local 
communities in the project completion symposium.

FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT 
A. 
Financial Management Assessment 
29. 
As  part  of  the  project  due  diligence  for  MON  (48236-001):  Strengthening  Community 
Resilience  to  Dzud  and  Forest  and  Steppe  Fires  ($3.2  million;  2016–2019),  a  financial 
management  assessment  (FMA)  of  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies  was  conducted, 
in  accordance  with  ADB’s  Financial  Management  Assessment  Guidelines  and  Financial  Due 
Diligence‒A Methodology Note. Overall assessment of pre-mitigation financial management risk 
is based on the definitions provided in ADB’s Financial Management Technical Guidance Note‒
Financial Management Assessment (May 2015). Office of the Chief, NEMA will be the executing 
agency. The DPCC will be the implementing agency. 
30. 
The  FMA  was  conducted  through  working  discussions  held  at  the  NEMA  offices  in 
Ulaanbaatar  in  April  2016,  attended  by  staff  of  NEMA’s  Department  of  Finance,  Procurement, 
and Services (DFPS). The ADB FMA questionnaire was used as the basis for discussions. The 
FMA considered the capacity of the executing and implementing agencies, including funds-flow 
arrangements,  staffing,  accounting  and  financial  reporting  systems,  financial  information 
systems, and internal and external auditing arrangements. 
31. 
The overall pre-mitigation financial management risk of the executing and implementing 
agencies  is  concluded  to  be  “moderate”  (defined  as  “likely  to  occur,  will  have  low  impact  if 
occurs”).16 This conclusion is based on: (i) the implementing agency has low in-house financial 
capacity,  as  the  DPCC  comprises  technical  staff  which  are  not  qualified  in  accounting  or 
financial management; hence even with the inclusion of a qualified finance specialist in the PIU 
team, it is possible that some errors or deficiencies in project financial management may occur; 
(ii) such risks will be partly offset by the involvement of NEMA’s DFPS, which provides overall 
guidance and financial monitoring for all NEMA departments; and (iii) given the small size and 
budget  of  the  project,  it  is  likely  that  any  errors  could  be  quickly  identified  and  corrected,  with 
limited impact to project operations and viability. 
A ranking of “moderate” risk requires the preparation of an action plan for risk mitigation 
32. 
The  project  will  implement  the  following  mitigation  measures:  (i)  a  qualified  finance  specialist 
and a procurement officer will be recruited to manage accounts and procurement respectively; 
(ii) financial management software acceptable to ADB will be used for the project, supported by 
maintenance of hard-copy ledgers and records; (iii) an action plan for risk mitigation has been 
prepared  and  is  described  in  this  PAM.  During  project  implementation  this  will  be  regularly 
reviewed and/or updated to ensure the project responds dynamically to risks; (iv) NEMA’s DFPS 
will  provide  financial  oversight  to  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies,  working  also  with 
the  project  finance  specialist;  and  (v)  ADB  will  provide  intermittent  financial  training  and 
mentorship to the executing and implementing agencies as needed. Measures (ii) and (iii) are 
included in the terms of reference for the project finance specialist.

Project imprest account and procedures. After grant effectiveness, MOF will establish 
an imprest account for the project. The currency of the imprest account will be US dollars. The 
imprest account will be used exclusively for ADB’s share of eligible expenditures (i.e., the JFPR 
funds) and according to the financing arrangements described in this PAM. The imprest account 
will be established at a commercial bank endorsed by MOF. 
Requests by the executing agency for initial advance and subsequent replenishments of 
35. 
the imprest account will be supported by withdrawal applications to ADB and will be based on 
the executing agency’s estimate of  ADB’s share of eligible project expenditures for up to, and 
not  exceeding,  the  next  6  months,  supported  by  a  6-month  activity  plan  and  Estimate  of 
Expenditure  Sheet.18  Subsequent  applications  for  account  replenishment  will  be  accompanied 
by  a  Statement  of  Expenditures19  or,  if  full  documentation  is  required,  a Summary  Sheet,20  as 
well as the imprest account reconciliation statement.21 
36. 
Liquidation  of  eligible  expenditures  is  required  before  further  replenishments  of  the 
imprest account can be endorsed. The withdrawal application will be prepared in the currency of 
the  imprest  account  i.e.,  US  dollars.  Withdrawal  applications  will  be  co-signed  by  the  NEMA 
Chief  and  MOF.  The  initial  advance  will  be  prepared  by  the  NEMA  Office  of  the  Chief.

be used exclusively for ADB’s share of eligible expenditures of the project. Daily management of 
the subaccounts will be performed by the PIU to facilitate local project expenditures. Withdrawal 
requests from the sub-accounts will be prepared  by the PIU finance specialist and require co-
signing by the DPCC Director and PIU project manager. 
Statement  of  expenditure  (SOE)  procedure.22  The  SOE  procedure  will  be  used  for

liquidation of advances to the imprest account and reimbursement of eligible expenditures. It will 
also  apply  for  individual  payments  not  exceeding  $10,000  to  ensure  speedy  project 
implementation. Payments in excess of the SOE ceiling will be liquidated or replenished based 
on  full  supporting  documentation  of  eligible  expenditures  when  submitting  the  withdrawal 
application  to  ADB.  During  project  implementation,  ADB  will  assess  the  executing  agency’s 
accounting  and  administrative  capacity  and  feasibility  to  remove  the  ceiling  for  the  SOE 
procedure in accordance with the Loan Disbursement Handbook (February 2015, as amended 
from time to time), and review and update the FMA as needed. 
40. 
Signing  authority.  Before  the  submission  of  the  first  withdrawal  applications,  MOF 
should  submit  to  ADB  sufficient  evidence  of  the  authority  of  the  person(s)  who  will  sign  the 
withdrawal applications on behalf of the government, together with the authenticated specimen 
signatures of each authorized person.  
Interest. Interest earned on the imprest and/or sub-accounts, net of bank charges, can

be used for the project, subject to ADB’s approval and within the approved total amount of the 
grant account. Any unused interest should be returned to the grant account maintained at ADB 
upon project completion and before closing of the grant account.  
42. 
Training for project staff. Online training for project staff on disbursement policies and 
procedures  is  available  at:  http://wpqr4.adb.org/disbursement_elearning.  Relevant  government 
officials  of  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies  and  PIU  staff  are  encouraged  to  avail  of 
this training to help ensure efficient disbursement and fiduciary control. The schematic fund flow 
for the project is in the PAM section IV.G.

Disbursement Arrangements for Counterpart Fund 
44. 
The  GOM,  including  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies,  will  provide  in-kind 
support  of  office  space  for  the  PIU,  and  salaries  and  travel  costs  of  counterpart  staff.  These 
costs will be included in the annual budgets of NEMA and relevant GOM agencies. 
C. 
Accounting 
45. 
 NEMA will maintain, or cause to be maintained, separate books and records by funding 
source  for  all  expenditures  incurred  on  the  project  by  adopting  the  International  Public  Sector 
Accounting  Standard  for  cash  based  accounting.  The  PIU,  on  behalf  of  the  executing  and 
implementing  agencies,  will  prepare  consolidated  project  financial  statements  in  accordance 
with GOM's accounting laws and regulations which are consistent with international accounting 
principles and practices. 
D. 
Auditing and Public Disclosure  
46. 
NEMA will cause the detailed consolidated project financial statements to be audited in 
accordance  with  International  Standards  on  Auditing  by  an  independent  auditor  acceptable  to 
ADB. NEMA will submit audited project financial statements together with the auditors’ opinion 
will be submitted in the English language to ADB within six months of the end of the fiscal year.  
47. 
The annual audit report for the project accounts will include an audit management letter 
and audit opinions which cover (i)  whether the project financial statements present a true and 
fair  view  or  are  presented  fairly,  in  all  material  respects,  in  accordance  with  the  applicable 
financial reporting framework; (ii) whether the grant proceeds were used only for the purposes 
of the project or not; and (iii) the level of compliance for each financial covenant contained in the 
the  project.  Expenditure  categorization  and  analysis  should  be

VI. 
PROCUREMENT AND CONSULTING SERVICES 
A. 
Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing 
The  executing  agency  has  requested  advance  contracting  for  services  to  enable  early 
51. 
commencement  of  recruitment  of  consultants  and  PIU  staff.  All  advance  contracting  will  be 
undertaken in conformity with ADB’s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended 
from  time  to  time),  and  the  Public  Procurement  Law  of  Mongoila  (2005).  The  advertisement, 
shortlisting,  evaluation,  and  consultant  selection  committee  recommendations  under  advance 
contracting will be subject to ADB prior approval. The government and executing agency have 
been  advised  that  approval  of  advance  contracting  does  not  commit  ADB  to  financing  the 
project. Retroactive financing will not be utilized under the project. 
B. 
Procurement of Goods, Works and Consulting Services  
52. 
The  PIU,  on  behalf  of  the  executing  agency,  will  be  responsible  for  procurement.  All 
procurement  financed  by  the  JFPR  grant  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB’s 
Procurement  Guidelines  (2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  Mongolia’s  Ministry  of 
Finance (2014) Procurement Manual. The selection and engagement of contractors for works, 
goods, and/or consulting services to be financed by the grant will be subject to ADB approval.  
53. 
National competitive bidding procedures will be used for civil works contracts estimated 
to  cost  $100,000  or  more  and  for  goods  and  services  supply  contracts  valued  at  $100,000  or 
higher.  Shopping  will  be  used  for  procurement  of  works  and  equipment  worth  less  than 
$100,000.  Community  participation  will  be  used  for  services  valued  less  than  $100,000.  
Procurement  of  consultants  will  be  done  through  individual  consultant  selection,  consultants’ 
qualifications selection, and least-cost selection. The relevant sections of ADB’s Anticorruption 
Policy (1998, as amended to date) will be included in all procurement documents and contracts. 
54. 
Before  the  start  of  any  procurement  ADB  and  the  Government  will  review  public 
procurement  laws  of  the  central  and  state  governments  to  ensure  consistency  with  ADB’s 
Procurement Guidelines.  
55. 
An 18-month procurement plan indicating threshold and review procedures, goods, works, 
and consulting service contract packages and national competitive bidding guidelines is in Section 
VI.C. The plan describes the thresholds and review procedures, and contract packages for goods, 
works,  and  consulting  services.  Any  necessary  modifications  or  clarifications  to  the  recipient 
procurement procedures will be documented in the procurement plan.

(E)  National Competitive Bidding 
A.  
Regulation and Reference Documents 
64. 
The procedures to be followed for national competitive bidding shall be those set forth in 
the  Public  Procurement  Law  of  Mongolia  of  1  December  2005,  effective  1  February  2006,  as 
amended  in  February  2007;  July  2009;  and  February,  June  and  December  2011  (hereinafter 
referred  to  as  PPLM),  with  the  clarifications  and  modifications  described  in  the  following 
paragraphs required for compliance with the provisions of the ADB Procurement Guidelines. 
B. 
Procurement Procedures 
1. 
Eligibility [Recommended standard provision] 
45 
65. 
The  eligibility  of  bidders  shall  be  as  defined  under  section  I  of  the  Procurement 
Guidelines; accordingly, no bidder or potential bidder should be declared ineligible for reasons 
other than those provided in section I of the Guidelines, as amended from time to time. 
66. 
Government-owned enterprises in Mongolia shall be eligible for projects only if they can 
establish that they: (i) are legally and financially autonomous; (ii) operate under the principles of 
commercial  law;  and  (iii)  are  not  dependent  agencies  of  the  Borrower,  Beneficiary,  Recipient 
Executing Agency and/or the Implementing Agency. 
2. 
Participation of Foreign Bidders  
International  bidders  from  eligible  countries  of  ADB  shall  be  allowed  to  participate  in 
67. 
local procurement and may not be denied participation due to nationality.  
3. 
Preferences 
No  domestic  preference  shall  be  given  for  domestic  bidders  and  for  domestically 
68. 
manufactured goods. 
4. 
Prequalification and Registration 
69. 
Prequalification  is  discouraged  for  procurement  contracts  using  NCB.  When  used, 
particularly  for  works  contracts,  an  individual  prequalification  exercise  is  acceptable  for  each 
contract as is the use of a registration system (or approved standing list) of contractors based 
on criteria such as experience, financial capacity, and technical capacity. Foreign bidders from 
eligible countries must, however, be allowed to register and to bid without unreasonable cost or 
additional requirements. 
5. 
Rejection of All Bids and Rebidding 
70. 
All bids shall not be rejected or new bids invited without ADB's prior written concurrence.  
71. 
No bid shall be rejected merely on the basis of a comparison with the estimated cost or 
budget  ceiling  without  ADB's  prior  written  concurrence  (with  specific  reference  to  Article  30  of 
the PPLM). 
C. 
Bidding Documents 
6. 
Use of Bidding Documents 
National  Standard  Bidding  Documents  Goods  and  Works  that  have  been  approved  for 
72. 
procurement in ADB-financed projects shall be used.  
7. 
Language 
Bidding  documents  may  be  prepared  in  other  languages,  but  a  copy  of  the  bidding 
73. 
documents must be made available in English and submitted to ADB for review.  
8. 
Bid Validity 
46 
Bidders  shall  be  requested  to  extend  the  validity  of  their  bids  only  under  exceptional 
74. 
circumstances  and  the  Executing  or  Implementing  Agency,  as  the  case  may  be,  shall 
communicate  such  request  for  extension  to  all  bidders  before  the  date  of  expiry  of  their  bids. 
When the procurement is subject to ADB's prior review, the Executing or Implementing Agency, 
as the case may be, shall obtain in a timely manner the prior written concurrence of ADB for the 
extension of the bid validity period. 
9. 
Bid Evaluation 
75. 
Evaluation  and  qualification  criteria,  and  submission  requirements,  to  be  used  in  each 
bidding activity shall be clearly specified in the bidding documents. The evaluation of bids shall 
be done in strict adherence to the criteria specified in the bidding documents. 
76. 
Negotiations  with  bidders  shall  not  be  undertaken  before  award  of  contract,  except  as 
provided in Paragraph 2.63 of ADB's Procurement Guidelines. A bidder shall not be required, as 
a  condition  for  award,  to  undertake  obligations  not  specified  in  the  bidding  documents  or 
otherwise to modify its bid as originally submitted. 
77. 
At the same time that notification on award of contract is given to the successful bidder, 
the  results  of  the  bid  evaluation  shall  be  posted  on  a  well-known  freely  accessible  website 
(namely  Mongolia's  Ministry  of  Finance  e-procurement  website:  www.e-procurement.mn) 
identifying the bid and lot numbers and providing information on the: (i) name of each bidder that 
submitted a bid; (ii) bid prices as read out at bid opening; (iii) names of bidders whose bids were 
rejected and the reasons for their rejection; and (iv) name of the winning bidder, and the price it 
offered,  as  well  as  the  duration  and  summary  scope  of  the  contract  awarded.    The  Executing 
Agency  or  Implementing  Agency,  as  the  case  may  be,  shall  respond  in  writing  to  unsuccessful 
bidders who seek explanations on the grounds on which their bids were not selected. 
10.   ADB Policy Clauses  
78. 
A  provision  shall  be  included  in  all  NCB  works  and  goods  contracts  financed  by  ADB 
requiring  suppliers  and  contractors  to  permit  ADB  to  inspect  their  accounts  and  records  and 
other  documents  relating  to  the  bid  submission  and  the  performance  of  the  contract,  and  to 
have them audited by auditors appointed by ADB. 
79. 
A  provision  shall  be  included  in  all  bidding  documents  for  NCB  works  and  goods 
contracts  financed  by  ADB  stating  that  the  Borrower  shall  reject  a  proposal  for  award  if  it 
determines that the bidder recommended for award has, directly or through an agent, engaged 
in corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, coercive or obstructive practices in competing for the contract in 
question. 
80. 
A  provision  shall  be  included  in  all  bidding  documents  for  NCB  works  and  goods 
contracts  financed  by  ADB  stating  that  ADB  will  declare  a  firm  or  individual  ineligible,  either 
indefinitely  or  for  a  stated  period,  to  be  awarded  a  contract  financed  by  ADB,  if  it  at  any  time 
determines  that  the  firm  or  individual  has,  directly  or  through  an  agent,  engaged  in  corrupt, 
fraudulent, collusive, coercive or obstructive practices or any integrity violation in competing for, 
or in executing, ADB-financed contract.

distinct  cultural,  social,  economic  or  political  institutions,  living  in  the  project  soums,  as 
confirmed  by  due  diligence  and  national  census  data.  The  project  is  based  on  a  participatory 
pro-poor  approach  and  strives  to  be  all-inclusive,  not  resulting  in  negative  impacts  to  any 
communities  irrespective  of  gender,  ethnic  or  culture  grouping.  All  project  activities  will  be  in 
compliance with ADB’s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009).  
Prohibited  activities.  Pursuant  to  ADB's  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  (SPS)27 
84. 
ADB  funds  may  not  be  applied  to  the  activities  described  on  the  ADB  Prohibited  Investment 
Activities List set forth at Appendix 5 of the SPS. All project activities will comply with applicable 
national laws and regulations. 
Grievance  redress  mechanism.  The  executing  agency  and  PIU  will  establish  and 
85. 
maintain a grievance redress mechanism (GRM) to receive and facilitate resolution of affected 
peoples’  concerns,  complaints,  and  grievances  about  the  project’s  environmental  and  social 
performance. The GRM will address affected people’s concerns and complaints promptly, using 
an  understandable  and  transparent  process  that  is  gender  responsive,  culturally  appropriate, 
and readily accessible, at no costs and without retribution. The GRM will not impede access to 
Mongolia’s judicial or administrative remedies. The GRM will be introduced during consultation 
with communities and made publicly available  and accessible to the affected people prior and 
during to project implementation.

VIII.  GENDER AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS 
Poverty and social impacts. An SPRSS has been prepared for the project.  The project 
86. 
will benefit poor and vulnerable groups by ensuring that these have access to the project. The 
project is designed for disaster resilience, livelihood stability and poverty reduction and effective 
gender mainstreaming. Outputs 1 and 2 will strengthen resilience of 3,000 herder households in 
DRM in up to twelve soums of Dornod, Gobi-Altai, Khuvsgul and Sukhbataar aimags, which will 
directly  benefit  at  least  7,000  herders  and  soum  center  residents  in  2,500  households,  with 
about 250 female-headed households. The project will indirectly benefit the wider community in 
target  soums,  with  a  population  of  32,000  people,  of  which  approximately  49%  is  female  and 
around  40%  is  below  the  poverty  line.  Under  Outputs  2  and  3,  around  1,500  residents  will 
receive capacity development; 200 bagh residents will have access to shared disaster resilient 
livestock  shelters  or  fodder  storage  facilities;  150  bagh  residents  will  have  access  to  an 
improved water source; and 30 bagh households will benefit from increased irrigation capacity 
for  livelihood  stabilization.  Comprehensive  training  and  outreach  programs  on  DRM  will  be 
available  to  all  households  engaged  in  the  project,  especially  the  poorest.  Training  will  be 
tailored to local conditions and needs will be identified.  
The  project  focuses  on  existing  residents  and  does  not  involve  influx  of  workers. 
87. 
Contractors will be required to comply with local labor laws.  
88. 
Participatory  approach.  Opportunities  to  promote  a  participatory  approach  in  project 
aimags were identified via a consultative process with local governments and communities. The 
project’s  phased-approach  allows  for  a  comprehensive,  inclusive  consultation  process  early  in 
implementation.  This  bottom-up  planning  and  community-based  approach  to  DRM  enables  a 
high  degree  of  local  participation  and  places  control  of  inclusive  decision-making  and  onus  of 
fulfilling  actions,  prioritized  through  collective  consensus,  on  beneficiaries.  The  plans  will  be 
anchored  in  bagh  residents’  disaster  risk  perception,  social  mechanisms  and  local  coping 
strategies, articulating their realities, needs and priorities. The PIU will coordinate activities with 
civil society organizations, in particular to align the establishment of bagh neighborhood groups 
and development and implementation of CBDRM action plans with the existing structure, plans 
and activities of forest user groups (FUGs), pasture user groups (PUGs) and herder groups.  
89. 
Gender. The project is classified “effective gender mainstreaming” under ADB’s project 
gender  classification  system.  A  gender  action  plan  (GAP)  was  prepared.  Project  activities  are 
designed  to  be  participatory  and  inclusive  and  will  support  the  involvement  of  poor  herder 
households and female-headed households. Women already play a very important role in DRM, 
and  the  success  of  some  project  activities  will  depend  on  strong  support  from  females  in  the 
target soums and baghs. The project design emphasizes a participatory and inclusive approach 
to work with women and men, poor and vulnerable households, civil society organizations and 
soum and aimag authorities. The GAP sets targets for project participation, empowerment, and 
capacity building for women. 
The GAP comprises 9 actions with 17 indicators, of which 10 have quantitative targets 
90. 
(see  table  below)  and  includes  minimum  targets  of  35%  to  45%  involvement  of  women  in 
developing  the  bagh  neighborhood  CBDRM  plans  and  training.  Under  outputs  1  and  2  the 
project  will  support  women’s  participation  in  project  design,  trainings  and  awareness  raising 
activities about DRM, and community-based initiatives on DRM.  Under Output 3 the project will 
support the participation of women in government agencies to participate in project activities on 
DRM trainings. The GAP is found in Table 10.

Monitoring  
91. 
Project  performance  monitoring.  A  project  performance  monitoring  system  (PPMS) 
will  be  established  for  the  project.28  The  design  and  monitoring  framework  (DMF)  forms  the 
basis for monitoring the project progress. During project implementation, the PPMS, through the 
project  performance  report,  will  monitor  the  likelihood  that  key  milestone  dates  for  activities, 
outputs, outcome, and impact will be achieved. For the impact, measured 5 years after project 
completion,  this  will  be  indirectly  through  monitoring  assumptions  and  risks.  The  DMF  will  be 
reviewed  during  the  project  implementation  and  if  needed,  adjusted  to  reflect  changing 
circumstances  and  project  environments  so  that  the  project  outcome  can  be  achieved. 
Following project completion, the project is subject to an assessment of the outcome along with 
recommendations  for  enhancing  and  sustaining  the  outcome.  A  project  completion  report  will 
also include a preliminary assessment of the impact. The project impact, outcome, outputs, and 
targets and indicators can be seen in the DMF. 
92. 
The  PIU  will  monitor  project  implementation  through  the  progress  of  the  PIU  team 
members  as  well  as  feedback  from  the  executing  agency,  project  steering  committee,  project 
beneficiaries, and other stakeholders. ADB will monitor project performance in five aspects, i.e., 
technical,  procurement,  disbursement,  financial  management,  and  safeguards  (social  and 
environment),  through  the  executing  agency’s  semi-annual  progress  reports  (prepared  by  the 
PIU and endorsed by the executing agency), day-to-day communication with the PIU, and ADB 
review missions. 
93. 
The PIU will prepare and submit semi-annual project progress reports. These will include 
compliance  monitoring  with  any  conditions  and  covenants  stipulated  in  the  grant  agreement; 
DMF  activities  and  targets;  environmental  and  social  safeguards  monitoring;  and  gender  and 
social dimensions. 
The PIU will prepare and submit semi-annual project progress reports. These will include 
94. 
compliance  monitoring  with  any  conditions  and  covenants  stipulated  in  the  grant  agreement; 
DMF  activities  and  targets;  environmental  and  social  safeguards  monitoring;  and  gender  and 
social dimensions. 
95. 
Compliance  monitoring.  The  PIU  on  behalf  of  the  executing  agency  will  monitor 
compliance with covenants stipulated in the grant agreement. ADB will monitor the compliance 
status through the executing agency’s semi-annual progress reports, day-to-day communication 
with  the  PIU,  and  ADB  review  missions;  and  take  necessary  remedial  measures  for  any  non-
compliance. 
96. 
Environmental  safeguards  monitoring.  An  environmental  monitoring  plan,  including 
safety  checklists  (Appendix  5)  have  been  prepared  and  will  be  used  to  monitor  compliance  of 
contractors  with 
including 
environmental  safeguards  as  part  of  the  project  performance  monitoring  and  report  it  in  the 
the  site-EMPs.  The  PIU  will  monitor  project  performance, 
28  ADB’s  PPMS  is  a  coherent  and  results-based  approach  to  project  planning,  performance  monitoring,  and 
evaluation  of  results.  The  PPMS  comprises  five  components:  (i)  DMF;  (ii)  project  performance  report  (PPR);  (iii) 
grant recipient’s monitoring and evaluation (at the central, and executing and implementing agencies levels); (iv) 
project  completion  report  (PCR);  and  (v)  project  performance  evaluation  report  (PPER),  and  where  appropriate, 
impact  evaluation  studies.  The  DMF  provides  the  basis  upon  which  the  PPMS  operates.  It  does  this  by 
establishing  quantified,  time-bound  targets  and  measurable  indicators,  and  by  identifying  key  risks  and 
assumptions that are used to monitor and evaluate performance in the PPR, PCR, and PPER. 
68 
semi-annual project progress reports. The PIU will immediately inform the executing agency and 
ADB  of  any  unanticipated  environmental  safeguard  concerns.  Corrective  actions  will  be 
developed  as  needed,  and  agreed  between  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies,  PIU, 
affected persons, and any other relevant agencies. 
97. 
Social  safeguards  monitoring.  The  PIU  will  monitor  project  performance,  including 
social safeguards as part of the project performance monitoring and report it in the semi-annual 
project progress reports. The PIU will immediately inform the executing agency and ADB of any 
unanticipated social safeguard concerns. No involuntary resettlement impacts will occur due to 
the project.

Gender and social dimensions monitoring. The PIU social and gender specialist will 
record sex-disaggregated data and information on the social, gender, and participatory aspects 
of  the  project  during  the  project  activities.  Monitoring  and  evaluation  of  the  GAP  will  be 
incorporated  into  the  project  reporting.  The  social  and  gender  specialist  will  prepare  an  semi-
annual report on GAP implementation and progress, as part of the semi-annual project progress 
reports, and will work closely with the project communities. 
C. 
Evaluation 
Project  performance  will  be  regularly  monitored  and  rated  through  ADB’s  e-Operations 
99. 
project  implementation  module.  ADB’s  overall  grant  implementation  rating  will  be  made  based 
on  five  performance  indicators:  technical,  procurement,  disbursement,  financial  management, 
and  social  and  environmental  safeguards  (Section  IX.B).  Such  rating  will  be  updated  semi-
annually based on executing agency’s semi-annual project progress reports and/or ADB review 
missions. Within 6 months of physical completion of the project, NEMA (executing agency) will 
submit a grant completion report to ADB.29 
100.  ADB will conduct an inception mission when the grant becomes effective. ADB and the 
government  will  jointly  field  one  to  two  project  review  missions  a  year.  The  missions  will  (i) 
review  overall  implementation  of  the  project  and  update,  in  consultation  with  the  executing 
agency, the project implementation schedule; (ii) examine existing and potential implementation 
problems,  and  find  out  measures  with  the  executing  agency  to  resolve  them;  (iii)  review 
progress  in  procurement  and  disbursement;  (iv)  review  the  grant  recipient's  compliance  with 
grant  covenants  and,  where  there  is  any  noncompliance  or  delay,  discuss  proposed  remedial 
measures; and (v) assess the likelihood of attaining the project’s outcome. 
101.  ADB and the government will undertake a midterm review  at the beginning of the third 
year  of  project  implementation,  to  assess  implementation  status  and  take  appropriate 
measures—including modification of scope and implementation arrangements, and reallocation 
of grant proceeds, as appropriate—to achieve the project’s outcomes and impact. 
102.  A final ADB review mission will take place within six months after physical completion of 
the  project.  This  mission  will:  (i)  assess  project  performance  against  targets  and  benchmarks 
including  any  revision(s)  as  agreed  during  the  midterm  review;  (ii)  identify  any  incomplete 
activities,  or  unused  project  funds;  and  (iii)  determine  the  project  satisfactory  rating.  A  project 
completion  report  will  be  prepared,  in  cooperation  with  the  government.  In  case  the  project  is 
29  Project  completion  report  format  is  available  at:  http://www.adb.org/Consulting/consultants-toolkits/PCR-Public-

69 
selected as a sample of projects for project performance evaluation reporting, the project will be 
subject  to  more  detailed  performance  evaluation  and  impact  assessment  about  three  or  more 
years after completion. 
D. 
Reporting  
103.  The  PIU,  on  behalf  of  the  executing  agency,  will  provide  ADB  with:  (i)  semi-annual 
project progress reports in a format consistent with ADB's project performance reporting system; 
(ii) consolidated annual reports including (a) progress achieved by output as measured through 
the indicator's performance targets against the baseline data, (b) key implementation issues and 
solutions; (iii) updated procurement plan; (iv) updated implementation plan for each 12 months; 
and (v) a project completion report30 within six months of physical completion of the project. The 
completion  report  will  present  the  government’s  assessment  of  the  project’s  effectiveness  and 
will take account of findings of the ADB’s final review. To ensure that the project continues to be 
viable and sustainable, project accounts and the executing agency audited financial statements, 
together with the associated auditor's report, should be adequately reviewed. 
104.  The  PIU  shall  include  the  results  of  implementing  the  GAP  and  SPRSS  in  the  semi-
annual reports to be submitted by the executing agency to ADB. 
105.  Donor visibility. All project reports, training programs, seminars, workshops, materials, 
and equipment financed by the JFPR grant will clearly indicate the funding from the Government 
of  Japan  (GOJ)  and  display  the  JFPR  and  Japan  Official Development  Assistance  logos.31  All 
project press releases issued by ADB will refer to the financial contribution from the GOJ. The 
GOM, including the executing and implementing agencies, are requested to ensure that JFPR-
financed  activities  are  well  covered  by  local  print,  electronic  and  social  media,  and  that  all 
related publicity materials, official notices, reports and publications explicitly acknowledge Japan 
as  the  source  of  funding  received.  The  executing  agency  and  PIU  will  collect  and  maintain  a 
in  project 
database  of  high-resolution  photographs  of 
communication  activities  and  for  provision  to  the  GOM,  ADB,  and  Embassy  of  Japan  in 
Mongolia, which may use them for public awareness and visibility purposes. 
the  project  activities, 
for  use 
106.  Dissemination of project results to the Government of Japan. The PIU will provide 
the  executing  agency  and  implementing  agencies  and  ADB  with  reporting  materials  on  the 
project  activities,  including  high  resolution  photos,  testimonials  from  project  recipients  and 
implementers,  publications,  and  other  knowledge  products.  In  turn,  the  ADB  project  team  will 
provide  this  information  to  ADB’s  Office  of  Co-Financing  Operations–Japan  team,  as  well  as 
back-to-office  reports,  inception,  midterm  review,  and  completion  reports.32  Information  and 
methods for donor visibility and coordination are described in Appendices 1 and 2. 
E. 
Stakeholder Communication Strategy  
107.  A stakeholder communication strategy has been prepared for the project (Appendix 3). 
The project requires stakeholder participation and ownership, especially from local communities 
and  households  engaged  in  the  project.  The  communication  strategy  prescribes  timely  and 
inclusive dissemination of project progress and the opportunity for public feedback. The strategy

focuses on three objectives: (i) effective communication with the project stakeholders to achieve 
informed and supportive engagement; (ii) project visibility and media; and (iii) coordination and 
alignment of the project activities with other donor programs.  
108.  Public  disclosure  of  project  documents  and  activities  will  be  made  available  through  a 
project  website,  to  be  established  after  project  effectiveness,  as  well  as  other  dissemination 
approaches. Donor visibility (Section IX.D) is part of these activities.

ANTICORRUPTION POLICY 
109.  ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any violations of the 
Anticorruption  Policy  relating  to  the  Project.33  All  contracts  financed  by  ADB  shall  include 
provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the 
executing agency and all Project contractors, suppliers, consultants and other service providers.  
Individuals/entities on ADB’s anticorruption debarment list are ineligible to participate in

XI. 
ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISM 
112.  People who are, or may in the future be, adversely affected by the project may submit 
complaints  to  ADB’s  Accountability  Mechanism.  The  Accountability  Mechanism  provides  an 
independent  forum  and  process  whereby  people  adversely  affected  by  ADB-assisted  projects 
can voice, and seek a resolution of their problems, as well as report alleged violations of ADB’s 
operational policies and procedures.  
113.  Before submitting a complaint to the Accountability Mechanism, affected people should 
make a good faith effort to solve their problems by working with the concerned ADB operations 
department.  Only  after  doing  that,  and  if  they  are  still  dissatisfied,  should  they  approach  the 
Accountability Mechanism.

Appendix 1 
JAPAN FUND FOR POVERTY REDUCTION – GUIDANCE NOTE ON VISIBILITY OF JAPAN  
I.  
Introduction 
On  6  October  2009,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  Board  of  Directors  approved  the  Revised 
Operating  Framework  for  the  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  (JFPR),  thereby  combining 
Japan’s project grant and technical assistance support under one umbrella, and paving the way 
for  a  more  comprehensive  approach  to  the  use  of  these  funds  towards  addressing  poverty, 
building  up  human  resources,  and  empowering  institutions  and  communities  in  the  region. 
Japan  has  been  making  generous  contributions  for  technical  assistance  activities  through  the 
Japan  Special  Fund,  and  for  poverty  reduction  projects  through  JFPR,  since  they  were 
established in 1988 and 2000, respectively. It is but fitting and proper that said contributions are 
acknowledged and the recipients and general public are informed of the source of the funding 
assistance both at the Fund level and at the level of the individual technical assistance (TA) and 
project grants. The purpose of this note is to provide guidance on measures to ensure that the 
contribution of Japan in supporting JFPR is widely recognized.  
II.  
Statement on Japanese Visibility 
The JFPR Policy Guidelines provide general guidance on Japan Visibility and Coordination with 
Local  Embassy  of  Japan  Officials.  More  specifically,  task  teams  are  encouraged  to  help 
promote the visibility and local awareness of JFPR in recipient countries through the following:  
(a)  
(b)  
(c)  
(d)  
(e) 
(g)  
Publications,  training  programs,  seminars  and  workshops  financed  by  JFPR 
grants should clearly indicate that the activities in question have received funding 
from the Government of Japan;  
The JFPR logo (see below) should be used in publications financed by the JFPR 
program, and in banners and any other materials used in seminars and training 
programs financed by JFPR grants;  
All press releases issued by ADB with respect to JFPR grants should refer to the 
financial contribution from the Government of Japan (GOJ);  
Recipients should be encouraged to ensure that JFPR-financed activities are well 
covered  by  local  print  and  electronic  media,  and  that  all  related  publicity 
materials, official notices, reports and publications explicitly acknowledge Japan 
as the source of funding received;  
Grant signing ceremonies in the field should be encouraged, with the Recipients 
being encouraged to include Japanese embassy officials and to invite local and 
international press to these ceremonies; and 
Civil works, project billboards/signages, vehicles, and equipment should carry the 
JFPR and Japan Official Development Assistance (ODA) (see below) logos.  
In  addition,  Office  of  Cofinancing  Operations  (OCO)  may  promote  visibility  of  JFPR  by:  (i) 
informing Country Directors of the importance of signing ceremonies to Japanese officials and 
the  public  to  ensure  recognition  and  support  for  JFPR  funding;  and  (ii)  continuing  widespread 
distribution  of  the  JFPR  Annual  Report,  inclusion  of  JFPR  information  in  relevant  ADB 
documents,  and  occasional  information  sessions  for  Japanese  organizations.  Below  are 
examples of other ways to improve visibility.  
Appendix 1 
75 
III.  
The JFPR and Japan ODA Logos 
The  JFPR  and  Japan  ODA  logos  will  be  used  on  the  JFPR  website.  All  grant  approval 
notifications will include this guidance note and a printout of the logos. Soft copies (a pdf version 
and an Adobe Illustrator version) may be downloaded from the Cofinancing Website for use by 
the ADB and transmission to grant recipients. The ADB will make every effort to ensure that: (i) 
publications,  training  programs,  seminars,  workshops,  financed  by  the  JFPR  grants  clearly 
indicate that the activities in question have received funding from the Government of Japan; (ii) 
all  press  releases  issued  by  the  ADB  with  respect  to  the  JFPR  grants  refer  to  the  financial 
contribution of Government of Japan; and (iii) the logos are used in publications financed by the 
JFPR  program,  banners  and  any  other  materials  used  in  seminars  and  training  programs 
financed by the JFPR grants; as well as on civil works projects, vehicles, equipment, etc.  
IV.  
Local Publicity Opportunities 
In  addition  to  the  use  of  the  logos,  ADB  staff  are  urged  to  take  all  appropriate  measures  to 
encourage Recipients to ensure that JFPR-financed activities are well covered by local print and 
electronic media, and that all related publicity materials, official notices, reports and publications 
explicitly  acknowledge  Japan  as  the  source  of  funding  received.  Below  is  a  standard  text 
suggested  for  use  by  those  who  prepare  publicity  materials:  "The  grant  which  financed  this 
(name of activity) was received under the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction which is financed 
by the Government of Japan."  
Many  ADB  Resident  Missions  periodically  publish  newsletters.  New  grant  approvals,  signing 
ceremonies, and major project activities should be publicized in these newsletters. Most country 
offices have External Relations staff. Project/TA teams are encouraged to consult with them on 
ways to increase the visibility of Japan regarding JFPR grants. Opportunities to publish articles 
on high visibility projects prepared with the JFPR TA and project grants should be explored and 
utilized. Project/TA teams are advised to brief the Country  Directors about the implementation 
status  of  JFPR  grants.  Such  information  will  help  the  Resident  Missions  highlight  Japan's 
contribution, where relevant, in their meetings and presentations in seminars and workshops.  
V.  
Ceremonial Events 
Country  Directors,  Division  Directors,  and  the  Project/TA  Officers  will  receive  notification  of 
grant  approvals  and  will  be  informed  of  the  importance  of  signing  ceremonies  to  Japanese 
officials  and  the  public.  At  grant  signing  ceremonies  and  other  publicity  events,  the  ADB's 
country-based  staff  are  expected  to  foster  the  attendance  and  participation  of  country-based 
officials  of  the  Embassy  of  Japan  in  a  manner  that  provides  due  recognition  of  their  donor 
status.  Grant  recipients  should  take  the  lead  in  organizing  such  ceremonies,  and  whenever 
possible, Recipients should issue the formal invitation to attend. Such ceremonial events should 
also be alerted to the media and publicity outlets referred to above.  
VI.  
Participation of Japanese Entities in Implementation 
To promote GOJ’s continued support for JFPR, it is also important to generate visibility for the 
project  within  Japan.  OCO  will  promote  the  visibility  of  the  JFPR  by:  (i)  informing  Office  and 
Department  Heads  of  the  importance  of  achieving  high  visibility  in  order  to  garner  support  for 
the JFPR from Japanese officials and taxpayers; (ii) encouraging TA components that involve or 
cooperate  with  Japanese  experts,  expertise,  financial  resources  and  technologies;  and  (iii) 
continuing widespread distribution of the JFPR Annual Report, inclusion of JFPR information in 
76 
Appendix 1 
relevant  ADB  documents,  and  occasional  information  sessions  on  JFPR  for  Japanese 
organizations. In terms of enhancing the visibility of Japan, it is highly recommended that ADB 
involve and cooperate with Japanese organizations including NGOs, civil society organizations, 
aid agencies in particular JBIC and JICA, private sector enterprises or academic institutions.  
VII.   Visibility at ADB Headquarters 
Country-based ADB staff are requested to forward copies of all visibility material, such as press 
releases, newspaper and magazine articles, and photographs (including descriptive captions) to 
the  following  address:  Japan  Partnerships  Team,  Office  of  Cofinancing,  Asian  Development 
Bank, 6 ADB Avenue, Ortigas Center Mandaluyong City 1550 Philippines.

77 
JAPAN FUND FOR POVERTY REDUCTION – GUIDANCE NOTE ON COORDINATION WITH 
THE EMBASSY OF JAPAN AND JICA 
I.  
INTRODUCTION 
The  Final  Report  on  the  Review  of  Japanese  Official  Development  Assistance  (ODA) 
underscores  the  need  for  strategic  and  effective  aid.  One  way  to  ensure  alignment  of  Japan 
Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) projects and technical assistance (TA) with Government of 
Japan’s (GOJ) bilateral assistance strategy for a particular developing member country (DMC) 
is by bringing on board the comments and suggestions of the Embassy of Japan (EOJ). Thus, 
under  JFPR,  project  officers  are  required  to  consult  with  the  local  EOJ  about  the  project 
proposal  before  submitting  the  TA  Summary  and  Report/Grant  Summary  and  Report  and 
Recommendation  to  the  President  (RRP)  to  Office  of  Cofinancing  (OCO)  for  processing.  This 
Guidance Note provides detailed instructions regarding coordination activities with the EOJ and 
Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA).  
II.  
EOJ AND JICA CONTACT PERSONS 
The names of EOJ and JICA contact persons and their contact details are listed in a table which 
is posted in the OCO website. The list is provided to OCO by Japan’s Ministry of Finance and is 
updated  from  time  to  time.  It  is  important  to  confirm  the  details  in  the  table  before  contacting 
EOJ.  
III.  
ROLE OF THE RESIDENT MISSION AND OCO 
Communications with EOJ and JICA should be done with copy to the Resident Mission (RM) or 
the  relevant  Country  Officer  at  ADB  HQ  and  with  OCO.  If  needed,  RM’s  assistance  may  be 
sought to arrange the meeting with EOJ and JICA.  
RM’s  role  is  also  crucial  in  arranging  the  Grant  Agreement/TA  letter  signing  event  (section  V) 
and in overall coordination/relationship management with EOJ and JICA.  
IV.  
CONSULTATION WITH EOJ AND JICA – CONCEPT STAGE  
A meeting with the EOJ and JICA contact person should be scheduled during the Fact-Finding 
Mission.  During  the  meeting,  the  Grant  or  TA  Summary,  together  with  the  Design  and 
Monitoring Framework, must be explained to and discussed with the embassy officer.  
The Grant or TA Summary and the Design and Monitoring Framework should be submitted to 
EOJ and JICA at least five working days before the consultation to give EOJ time to review the 
document.  
Any  comments  made  by  EOJ  and/or  JICA  should  be  reflected  and  a  summary  of  the 
consultation should be included in the final TA Summary and Report (TSR) or Grant Summary 
and RRP (GSR) as the case may be.  
The project officer should exert all efforts to meet with EOJ and JICA contact persons. However, 
if a meeting with EOJ and/or JICA is not possible, email exchange, telephonic discussion or any 
other  form  of  inter-active  communication  may  be  used.  In  such  cases,  an  email  containing 
EOJ's/JICA’s comments on the proposal should be sought and reflected in the final proposal.  
78 
Appendix 2 
In the case of Regional TAs, draft TSRs and DMFs should be sent by email to EOJ and JICA 
focal persons on no-objection basis.  
V.  
COORDINATION WITH EOJ AND JICA – UPON APPROVAL OF THE PROPOSAL 
Once the proposal has been approved by ADB, the project officer should inform EOJ and JICA 
about  the  approval.  Project  officers  are  strongly  encouraged  to  stage  signing  ceremonies  or 
launching ceremonies for JFPR projects, etc., with the attendance of EOJ officials.  
In coordination with the RM, the project officer should inform EOJ as well as OCO – which will 
alert  the  Japanese  authorities  in  Tokyo  –  at  least  10  working  days  in  advance  of  the  signing 
ceremony.  The  project  officer  should  also  draft  news  release  in  consultation  with  the 
Department  of  External  Relations  and  coordinate  arrangements  for  the  RM  to  invite  the  local 
and international press to these ceremonies.  
VI.  
COORDINATION WITH EOJ AND JICA – DURING PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION 
AND UPON PROJECT COMPLETION 
From  time  to  time,  EOJ  and  JICA  should  be  informed  about  project  progress  and  milestones 
especially when major changes in scope and objectives are required. Throughout all phases of 
the  project, from  concept  to  completion,  the  project  officers  should  answer  inquiries  from  EOJ 
and JICA regarding the project and discuss where necessary. EOJ and JICA officials may also 
wish  to  join  progress  and  completion  review  missions  in  order  to  see  project  results  and  to 
interact first-hand with project recipients.  
Project officers are also required to share information on the outcomes and lessons from JFPR 
projects  and  TAs  with  EOJ  and  JICA  in  the  field  to  enable  both  sides  to  explore  and  seek 
potential collaboration.

NOTES FOR IMPLEMENTING THE PROJECT 
Appendix 4 
83 
INTRODUCTION 
1. 
These  notes  identify  key  points  and  issues  about  implementing  the  project.  They  are 
aimed at the executing agency, implementing agency, and project implementation unit (PIU), so 
that  they  can  understand  the  intent  of  certain  activities  in  the  project  design.  The  notes  are 
organized by key activity by project output. These notes should be read in conjunction with the 
project  design  and  monitoring 
implementation  schedule,  budget, 
procurement plan, and consultant terms of reference (TOR).

Output 1. Bagh neighborhood group CBDRM action plans prepared 
A.   
Principles for Bagh Neighborhood Groups 
2. 
The  PIU  should  apply  the  following  principles  for  bagh  neighborhood  groups.  These 
principles  apply  to  training  project  soum  coordinators,  setting  up  bagh  neighborhood  groups, 
and developing bagh neighborhood action plans. 
Principles for Training Project Soum Coordinators 
(i) 
The  PIU  should  provide  induction  training  that  includes  the  project  itself  (objectives, 
expected  results,  activities,  and  budget);  the  role  of  project  soum  coordinator,  and  key 
activities to be carried out by the project soum coordinators. 
(ii)  The  PIU  should  provide  training  in  facilitating  skills,  participatory,  and  adult  learning 
methods;  working  with  bagh  neighborhood  groups,  and  conducting  consultations  with 
the local community. 
(iii)  The  PIU  should  provide  training  in  community-based  DRM  principles  and  practices, 
including  community  based  disaster-risk  assessments,  and  developing  bagh 
neighborhood group DRM action plans. 
Principles for Setting-up Bagh Neighborhood Groups 
(i)  Project soum coordinators hold consultations in each bagh on the project, the concept of 
(ii) 
bagh neighborhood groups, and what they will do.  
“Organic”  groupings  with  no  strict  limits  on  size,  location  of  household  members, 
occupation. 
(iii)  The bagh neighborhood groups can be in all baghs, including the soum center bagh. 
(iv)  The bagh neighborhood group need to register with the soum coordinators:   
a)  This should include a rationale for the bagh neighborhood group, how membership 
of this group integrates with other existing groups, if relevant, for example, herder 
groups or Forest User Groups (FUGs). 
b)  The  bagh  neighborhood  group  should  state  how  many  households  (HH),  are 
involved, and the locations of the HH members. 
c)  The  bagh  neighborhood  groups  should  specify  how  many  HHs  in  the  group  are 
classified  in  levels  1  –  6  of  the  Mongolia  household  classification  system  (poor 
HHs). 
d)  The  bagh  neighborhood  groups  should  indicate  how  many  HHs  in  the  group  are 
headed by women. 
(v)  Acceptance of bagh neighborhood groups into the project will consider the following: 
a)  The number of households in levels 1 – 6 of the Mongolia household classification 
system 
83
84 
Appendix 4 
b)  The number of HHs headed by women. 
c)  The fit of the rationale for the group to the project goals. 
(vi)  Project  soum  coordinators  will  present  recommendations 
neighborhood groups in each bagh to the bagh governor. 
for  setting  up  bagh 
Principles for Developing Bagh Neighborhood Group DRM Action Plans 
(i)  Plans  should  be  based  on  participation  by  bagh  neighborhood  group  members.  Group 
members develop their own action plan. 
(ii)  Plans should be based on opinions of bagh neighborhood group members, local coping 
strategies, while also being scientifically and technically realistic. 
(iii)  Actions  in  each  action  plan  should  be  prioritized  according  to  what  actions  the  project 
can support, and what actions other donors can support. 
(iv)  Project  soum  coordinators  recommend  to  the  Project  Implementation  Unit  (PIU)  what 
planned activities the DRM project can support.  The PIU decision is communicated to 
project soum coordinators, who inform the bagh neighborhood groups and then present 
the final bagh neighborhood group DRM action plan to the bagh governor. 
(v)  Each bagh governor will then submit a consolidated bagh level plan based on the group 
plans to the soum administrations for approval. 
(vii) 
(vi)  Bagh  neighborhood  group  DRM  action  plans  are  to  be  displayed  graphically,  for 
example in a calendar, where it is clear the actions and when they are to be done  
Initial  neighborhood  group  DRM  action  plans  are  for  two-years  -  the  duration  of  the 
project. In the final quarter of the project, action plans are to be reviewed and updated 
for the next two years. Good examples of bagh neighborhood group action plans are to 
be presented in the symposium. 
Key  Training  and  Steps  for  Participatory  DRM  Planning  for  Bagh  Neighborhood 
B. 
Groups 
3. 
The  PIU’s  international  CBDRM  specialist,  the  national  CBDRM  specialist,  and  soum 
coordinators provide orientation to bagh communities and soum administrations on community-
based DRM, and the project. 
After  the  soum  coordinators  recruit  and  register  the  bagh  neighborhood  groups,  the  soum 
coordinators  train  the  bagh  neighborhood  groups  on  DRM  and  developing  community  based 
DRM action plans.  
4. 
In summary, the method for participatory DRM planning - to be carried out by the bagh 
NGs  -  includes  six steps,  which  the  soum  coordinator  will oversee  with  each  of  the  registered 
bagh NGs:  
Step 1. Introduce community based disaster risk management (CBDRM) 
Step 2. Prepare the bagh NGs to carry out CBDRM 
Step 3. Carry out the bagh disaster risk assessment (DRA) 
Step 4. Develop the bagh DRM Action Plan 
Step 5. Implement the bagh DRM Action Plan 
Step 6. Participatory monitoring and evaluation. 
5. 
After Step 4, and the bagh neighborhood groups have drafted, revised and finalised their 
DRM  action  plans,  these  are  submitted  to  the  bagh  governor  and  soum  administrations  for 
84
Appendix 4 
85 
approval. The soum coordinators should provide support to the bagh neighborhood groups for 
Step  5  on  how  to  implement  their  DRM  action  plan,  and  for  Step  5  for  monitoring  the 
implementation of the DRM action plan. 
C.  
Example of an input table for a bagh neighborhood group DRM action plan 
6. 
Following  is  an  example  of  an  input  table  for  a  DRM  action  plan  that  a  bagh 
neighborhood group in Dornod aimag could prepare. After the input table has been completed 
and approved by the bagh governor and soum administration (see principles above in section 
a.3) the project will produce a graphical version of the plan, such as a wall calendar. 
7. 
Note  that  DRM  action  plans  prepared  by  bagh  neighborhood  groups  in  Sukhbaatar, 
Khuvsgul,  and  Gobi-Altai,  and  even  plans  prepared  by  other  bagh  neighborhood  groups  in 
Dornod, could include different risk and actions than in this simple example. 
8. 
The  actual  format  for  both  bagh  neighborhood  group  input  tables  and  the  graphical 
version  of  the  approved  plan  should  be  developed  by  the  PIU  during  the  first  year  of 
implementation.

Procurement of equipment for bagh neighborhood groups 
9. 
For soums in Dornod, Sukhbaatar, and Khuvsgul aimags that have a high risk of steppe 
fires or forest fires, the PIU should purchase and distribute small equipment to fight fires to bagh 
86
Appendix 4 
87 
neighborhood  groups.  This  includes  blower  machines  to  keep  steppe  fires  from  spreading 
across defined lines, hand tools to tamp out fires, and backpack water sprayers and small water 
tanks on trailer that can be hauled by mid-size SUVs.   
Note that the PIU should only supply equipment to bagh neighborhood groups that have 
10. 
specifically  requested  the  equipment  in  their  approved  action  plan,  and  have  a  rationale  and 
actions for why they require the equipment.  
Procurement  of  personal  protective  gear  (PPG)  for  bagh  neighborhood 
ii.  
groups 
11. 
The PIU should purchase and distribute personal protective equipment to the groups in 
soums in Dornod, Sukhbaatar, and Khuvsgul aimags for use in fighting fires. This includes fire 
resistant jackets, pants, and boots. PPG for fighting steppe fires will be slightly different to that 
for fighting forest fires. 
Note that the PIU should only supply equipment to bagh neighborhood groups that have 
12. 
specifically  requested  the  PPG  in  their  action  plan,  and  have  a  rationale  and  actions  for  why 
they require the equipment. 
iii.  
Provide animal shelters and forage storage facilities 
13. 
For  soums  in  Dornod,  Sukhbaatar,  and  Gobi-Altai,  the  PIU  should  purchase  and 
distribute  materials  that  the  bagh  neighborhood  groups  will  use  to  build  animal  shelters  and 
forage  storage  facilities.  The  PIU  should  only  supply  materials  to  groups  that  have  an  action 
plan that specifically requests an animal shelter or forage storage facility. 
The  shelters  and  facilities  should  be  designed  by  an  engineer  contracted  by  the  PIU. 
14. 
The groups will construct their shelter or facility according to the engineering plans and specified 
materials.  The  engineering  designs  should,  where  possible,  introduce  new  materials  and 
construction approaches to supplement traditional materials and construction. 
iv.  
Contract well-drilling in Gobi-Altai 
15. 
Similar  to  the  shelters  and  storage  facilities,  the  PIU  should  contract  a  firm  that 
specializes  in  well  drilling.  This  firm  will  drill  wells  for  bagh  neighborhood  groups  in  soums  in 
Gobi-Altai aimag that request wells in their action plan. 
B.    Contracting firebreaks and water tanks in two Khusgul forest soums 
16. 
The PIU should help soums in Khuvsgul aimag to cut firebreaks (i) around their ger and 
animal facilities, and (ii) around the perimeter of the soum center. The object of these firebreaks 
is  to  protect  people,  animals,  and  property  from  forest  fires.  If  cutting  firebreaks  will  involve 
cutting trees, only licensed “professional” entities can be contracted to cut trees according to the 
forest law. Cutting trees for fire breaks is considered as part of forest cleaning activities and thus 
allowed  under  the  forest  law.  The  licensed  “professional”  entities  should  have  approval  from 
only  soum  authorities  if  the  area  for  fire  breaks  are  outside  the  buffer  zones  of  the  specials 
protected area. If the fire break areas are within the buffer zones, PIU should to check in detail 
with the MET relevant regulations.  
87
88 
Appendix 4 
The  PIU  may  also  provide  a  resource  person  who  has  expertise  in  designing  forest 
17. 
firebreaks to assist the groups to locate and specify the conditions of the firebreak. 
18. 
The PIU should purchase and distribute large water tanks that will be placed along the 
large  firebreak  that  will  protect  the  soum  center.  PIU  and  soum  will  also  seek  possibilities  to 
establish  ponds  for  collecting  /  keeping  spring  and  snow  water  near  by  the  large  firebreak. 
These ponds, if established, could replace some water tanks.      
C.    Contracting firebreaks in Dornod and Sukhbaatar 
The PIU should contract bagh neighborhood groups in soums in Dornod and Sukhbaatar 
19. 
aimags to cut firebreaks (i) around their  ger and animal facilities, and (ii) in strategic locations 
that  will  prevent  the  spread  of  steppe  fires  to  other  soums  or  aimags.  The  object  of  these 
firebreaks is to protect people, animals, and property from steppe fires. 
D.    Contract the repair and rehabilitation of irrigation systems in Sharga soum, Gobi-
Altai 
20. 
The  PIU  should  contract  bagh  neighborhood  groups  in  Sharga  soum  to  repair  and 
rehabilitate an irrigation system used to grow grass for hay, and another irrigation system used 
to  grow  vegetables.  Because  the  rehabilitation  work  can  be  done  by  local  people,  the  PIU 
should develop contracts for the bagh neighborhood groups to undertake this work. 
E.   
Contract scoping study for early warning system for natural disasters 
The  PIU  should  contract  a  consultant  team  to  investigate  and  design  an  early  warning 
21. 
system for natural disasters. These include forest fires, steppe fires, and dzud, but possibly also 
floods  and  sandstorms.  This  consultant  team  will  contain  international  GIS  expert,  and 
international and national experts in selected natural disasters, such as forest fires. 
22. 
If  the  design  of  the  early  warning  system  indicates  that  the  project  could  achieve  a 
couple of activities in the early warning system, and if budget is available, then the PIU might 
begin the implementation of the system. 
Output 3. DRM capacity of NEMA, LEMAs and soum administrations strengthened 
A.    Contract improvements to NEMA GIS disaster database 
23. 
NEMA staff should identify improvements that they would like to see in their GIS-based 
disaster database. These improvements could improve operational performance – for example, 
the  database  at  present  could  improve  its  very  slow  response  times  to  users;  or  improve 
functionality – for example, adding data layers about specific disasters. 
24. 
The  PIU,  in  conjunction  with  NEMA,  should  then  prioritize  the  improvements  to  the 
database that the project can fund. The PIU should then contract a consultant team to design 
and  then  implement  improvements  to  this  database.  This  consultant  team  will  contain 
international and national experts in GIS.  
88
Appendix 4 
89 
B.    Contract training of super-users of NEMA GIS disaster database 
25. 
NEMA  has  identified  that  only  a  relatively  few  people  use  the  disaster  database 
effectively and regularly. One reason for this might be the poor operational performance of the 
database, noted in the previous section. Another reason is that many NEMA staff are not well-
trained in how to use the database. 
NEMA  should  identify  “super-users”  of  the  database.  These  can  be  in  NEMA 
26. 
departments  or  in  the  LEMAs.    The  PIU  should  then  contract  JAXA  to  organize  and  deliver  a 
training program that aims to make the super-users of the database effective users.  After their 
training, these super-users should have an understanding of the database and a high capability 
to use the database that is high enough to effectively train “ordinary” users of the database. 
The PIU should contract JAXA directly (no competitive bidding for this contract) because 
27. 
this is part of the “Japanese visibility” required by the grant. 
Project budget would allow for about 25 people from LEMA in all provinces to attend 3 
28. 
sessions of the training, each for 5 days.  
C.   
Training of LEMAs and soum administrations in DRM 
29. 
The  PIU  should  periodically  organize  trainings  for  staff  in  LEMAs  and  soum 
administrations  on  aspects  of  DRM,  and  in  particular  CBDRM;  and  on  aspects  of  project 
activities,  such  as  social  and  gender  safeguards.  The  trainings  will  be  delivered  by  PIU 
consultants,  including  the  international  CBDRM  specialist,  the  national  CBDRM  specialist,  the 
social and gender safeguards specialist, and the M&E specialist. The trainings may take place 
in NEMA in Ulaanbaatar, or in one of the LEMAs in the project. 
D.   
Procure equipment and PPG for LEMA and soum administrations 
Similar to providing equipment and  PPG to the  bagh neighborhood groups as noted in 
30. 
Output  2  above,  the  PIU  should  also  purchase  and  distribute  equipment  to  LEMAs  and  soum 
administrations  to  fight  steppe  fires,  forest  fires,  and  improve  responses  to  dzud.  This 
equipment  includes,  as  in  Output  2,  blower  machines  to  keep  steppe  fires  from  spreading 
across defined lines, hand tools to tamp out fires, backpack water sprayers, small water tanks 
on trailer that can be hauled by mid-size SUVs, PPG for LEMA and soum administration staff. 
The PIU should procure this equipment using the same procurement packages as the ones in 
Output 2 for equipment and PPG.  This is noted in the project’s procurement plan. 
This equipment also includes siren systems for certain soums, communications systems 
31. 
for LEMA staff, and road clearing equipment for LEMAs in the project. 
E.   
Implement stakeholder communications 
32. 
The project has a stakeholder communications plan. This should be implemented by the 
PIU.  Key  elements  include  establishing  a  project  website  and  a  presence  on  certain  social 
media  sites  –  for  example,  Facebook  –  and  the  development  of  printed  materials  and  media 
communications to promote project consultations and trainings. 
89
90 
Appendix 4 
F.    
Implement Japanese visibility 
33. 
The project has a plan to ensure “Japanese visibility” is developed and maintained. The 
PIU  should  (i)  communicate  broadly  to  stakeholders  the  use  of  Japanese  resources  and 
suppliers  in  the  project,  and  (ii)  involve  Japanese  officials  when  communicating  the  progress 
and achievements of the project. 
G.    Develop knowledge products 
34. 
During  the  last  two  quarters  of  the  project,  Q3  2019  and  Q4  2019,  the  PIU  should 
develop ‘knowledge products” about the project. These products could be (i) key learnings from 
the project, (ii) guidelines on how to replicate and implement certain project activities elsewhere, 
and (iii) a strategy for extending CBDRM approaches to other types of natural disasters.  
H.    Organize end-of-project symposium 
35. 
During the second half of 2019, the last year of the project, the PIU should organize a 
symposium  for  key  project  participants  (NEMA  staff,  LEMA  staff,  soum  administrations,  bagh 
governors)  and  stakeholders  (selected  staff  from  government  ministries  and  international 
organizations  such  as  MET,  MOFA  and  ADB,  Japan  Embassy  in  UB  and  JICA  etc).  The 
symposium will focus on information exchange among the participants, identify what things the 
project did well and what things could have been done better, and steps to be taken to extend 
the CBDRM approach further in Mongolia.

A  critical  key  task  during  project  start-up  is  the  recruitment  of  PIU  consultants.  Initial 
appointments  should  be  the  PIU  project  coordinator,  the  PIU  finance  specialist,  and  the  PIU 
procurement  specialist.  NEMA  should  recruit  and  appoint  these  positions,  following  ADB  and 
MOF procedures, no later than the end of the second month of the project. The project director 
and manager can then focus on recruiting and appointing the rest of the PIU consultants. 
It  is  assumed  that  contract  for  soum  coordinators  in  Darvi  and  Altai  soums  will  end  in 
37. 
September 2018 due to fewer activities in these soums. The soum coordinator in Sharga soum 
will cover all project activities starting from October 2018. 
B.    Monitoring and evaluation and the DMF 
38. 
In the first year of the project, the PIU’s M&E specialist should review the project DMF, 
design the M&E system, collect the necessary data (from secondary sources and primary data 
from  project  sources)  to  establish  the  baseline  for  the  project,  and  set-up  the  format  for  the 
quarterly  project  reports.  Note  that  the  M&E  system  specifically  monitors  project  performance 
against the DMF.   
The M&E specialist should train the PIU project coordinator and key PIU consultants in 
39. 
how  to  use  the  M&E  system,  including  entering  performance  data  into  the  system  and  then 
producing quarterly reports on the performance of the system.  
90
Appendix 4 
91 
The M&E specialist should return to the project in subsequent years to assist the PIU to 
40. 
produce mid-term and project completion reports.  
C.   
Social safeguards and gender action plan 
41. 
In the first year of the project, the PIU’s social and gender specialist should review the 
GAP, its targets and indicators; collect the necessary data (from secondary sources and primary 
data from project sources) to establish the social and gender baseline for the project, and set-up 
the  format  for  reporting  on  the  GAP  in  the  quarterly  project  reports.  The  social  and  gender 
specialist  should  also  identify  any  social  issues  around  the  project  that  the  PIU  needs  to 
consider when implementing the project. The social and gender specialist should train the PIU 
project  coordinator  and  key  PIU  consultants  in  what  activities  need  to  be  done  to  achieve  the 
social  and  gender  targets  for  the  project,  how  to  track  progress  against  the  GAP  targets,  and 
reporting on the GAP for the quarterly reports on the performance of the system.  
The  social  and  gender  specialist  should  return  to  the  project  in  subsequent  years  to 
42. 
assist  the  PIU  to  monitor  project  performance  on  the  GAP  and  to  assist  and  train  the  PIU  to 
complete gender activities.

ANNEXES 
Annex I. Method for Participatory DRM Planning  
There are a series of steps the Soum Project Adviser will oversee with each of the registered 
bagh NGs: 
Step 1 
Step 2  
Step 3 
Step 4  
Step 5  
Step 6  
Introducing community based disaster risk management (CBDRM) 
Preparing the bagh NGs to carry out CBDRM 
Carrying out the bagh [community-based] disaster risk assessment 
(DRA) 
Developing the bagh DRM Action Plan 
Implementing the bagh DRM Action Plan 
Participatory monitoring and evaluation. 
Step 1. Introducing CBDRM and Step 2 Preparing the bagh NGs to carry out CBDRM 
1. 
The  Soum  Field  Officer,  with  support  from  the  International  CBDRM  Specialist  will 
facilitate  Step  1  and  Step  2  with  the  bagh  NGs.  Once  a  bagh  NG  completes  training  in 
community based DRM, bagh DRA, and in developing bagh DRM Action Plans, the Soum Field 
Officer  will  agree  with  the  Team  Leader1  of  each  bagh  NG  their  schedule  for  carrying  out 
participatory bagh DRAs.  
Step 3. Carrying out the bagh DRA 
2. 
For  Step  3,  the  bagh  DRA,  the  bagh  NG  Team  Leader  is  responsible,  with  volunteers 
from his or her NG, for timing and preparing the multi-hazard DRA. Timing for the DRA will vary 
among different bagh NGs but should be carried out at least three weeks before the normal time 
set for developing the yearly  soum  Emergency  Management Plan. This will help make certain 
there  is  enough  time  to  develop  the  bagh  DRM  Action  Plan  and  sends  these  to  the  bagh 
governor  (for  review  and  approval).  The  bagh  governor  (with  support,  as  needed,  from  the 
Soum  Project  Adviser)  presents  the  bagh  DRM  Action  Plan  to  the  soum  administration  for 
inclusion in the soum Emergency Management Plan.  
3. 
The  process  for  carrying  out  the  bagh  DRA  includes  various  components  (provided  in 
guidelines during the bagh NG training events). The participatory bagh DRA tools - widely used 
elsewhere in rural areas - need adapting to the local context. See Annex XX for DRA tools. 
1.  Objectives 
The bagh DRA will help identify: 
(i)  Historical and potential natural hazards. 
(ii)  Vulnerabilities and capacities of the bagh NG and bagh residents. 
(iii) Suitable solutions, in which vulnerable people are considered. 
The bagh DRA will: 
1 nominated by bagh NG members 
92
(iv) Provide information necessary to draft a bagh DRM Action Plan and for integrating this 
into the soum Emergency Response Plan2, and socio-economic development plans. 
(v)  Increase awareness and capacity of the bagh NG, the bagh and soum administrations, 
and other bagh residents on CBDRM, DRA and climate change. 
Appendix 4 
93 
See Annex XX for a template for a bagh DRA.  
2.  Activities 
a.  Preparing for the bagh DRA  
To prepare for the bagh DRA the bagh NG need to be identify: 
Scope of the assessment 
(i)  Location: all areas of the bagh, or focus more on areas most prone to natural hazards. 
(ii)  Neighbouring  areas:  outside  the  bagh  that  may  affect  natural  hazards  within  the  bagh, 
for example, forest lands, or rivers. 
(iii) Audience:  divide  people  living  in  the  bagh  into  different  groups  based  on  different 
occupations  or  locations,  for  example:  herder  groups,  ethnicity,  those  with  similar 
livelihoods.  
Time and location  
The main issues to be agree here are the number of days needed, a suitable schedule and time 
for the bagh NG to carry out the assessment involving other local people.  
Suitable methods and tools 
The  methods  and  tools  which  can  be  used  may  vary  from  one  bagh  NG  to  another.  There 
should be flexibility in the approach. Suitable questions are needed to guide each tool to make 
sure they are suitable to the context.  
There is a logical order in which the tools are used, with information collection tools, such as the 
review of secondary data, historical profile, and mapping preceding information analysis tools.  
The details of each assessment tool are provided in Annex XX.  
The bagh NG will need to prepare some materials for the DRA in advance, including drawing 
tables  and  templates,  and  collecting  the  material  needed  (such  as  A0  and  A4  paper,  pens, 
chalk, camera, laptops and USB). 
Resources to carry out a bagh DRA  
The resources to carry out a bagh DRA: 
(i)  Human  resources:  How  many  people  in  the  bagh  NG  should  take  part  in  the  DRA? 
How should the members of the bagh NG be divided to best use their knowledge, skills 
and experience? 
(ii)  Financial resources: What finance is available? How much is needed? The bagh NG 
should not provide money to other bagh people for taking part in the DRA. Instead a 
small ordinary gift (snacks, tea) could be given to people for taking part in the DRA. 
2  Although currently the soum Emergency Response Plan, this will be expanded to include other phases of DRM. 
93
94 
Appendix 4 
(iii)  Data  needs:  from  the  bagh,  soum  and  aimag  administrations,  the  LEMA  and  NEMA, 
the bagh NG should get basic data on natural hazards, climate change, proposed rural 
development, infrastructure and spatial information – including topographic maps and 
GIS  data.  The  soum  Project  Adviser  should  help  with  collecting  information  which 
would otherwise be challenging for the bagh NG to get. 
b.  Requirements for a bagh DRA 
Participants 
Participants  include:  members  of  the  bagh  NG;  other  bagh  residents  -  including  men  and 
women  of  different  ages,  ethnic  groups,  economic  status,  livelihoods,  religions,  and  from 
different  locations  across  the  bagh;  people  from  different  vulnerable  groups,  such  as  older 
people, people with disabilities. 
When to conduct a bagh DRA? 
(i)  Yearly, before the historic dzud, forest or steppe fire season (depending on the relative 
important and impact of these hazards). 
(ii)  Before  developing  the  soum  Emergency  Management  Plan,  or  yearly  soum  socio-
economic plan. 
Principles of a bagh DRA 
(i)  Collect,  collate  and  analyse 
information  about 
environment, and livelihoods of the bagh community. 
the  safety,  health,  sanitation, 
(ii)  Make  sure  bagh  and  soum  government  staff,  and  a  broad  cross-section  of  the  bagh 
community are involved. 
(iii)  Every idea and opinion is recognised. 
(iv)  Consider  climate  change  information  provided  by  LEMA,  NEMA,  and  the  Institute  of 
Meteorology and Hydrology, Ulaanbaatar and potential local impacts. 
(v)  Ensure gender equality, different ethnic groups, and participation of vulnerable groups, 
including for example, older people (over 60years old), and people with disabilities. 
(vi)  All  information  needs  verifying  and  cross-checking  among  bagh  NG  members,  with 
other  bagh  residents,  and  with  the  soum  administration  (the  Soum  Field  Officer  can 
help with this). 
(vii)  As needed, the Soum Field Officer will help the bagh NG Team Leader to engage with 
other  bagh  residents  to  provide  information  and  ideas,  discuss,  assess,  analyse  and 
identify  bagh  priorities  and  solutions,  and  raise  the  awareness  of  bagh  residents  on 
CBDRM. 
c.  Contents of a bagh DRA  
A bagh DRA includes assessments of:  
(i)  Natural hazards, and ranking levels of risks  
(ii)  Vulnerabilities 
(iii)  Capacities of the bagh NG and others for managing multi-hazard risks, and  
(iv)  Awareness of the bagh residents of natural hazard risk.  
Vulnerability and capacity must be assessed considering: material, organisational and societal 
issues; and local people’s awareness, experience, attitude and motivation. 
Assessment of natural hazards and ranking levels of risks 
94
Appendix 4 
95 
Natural hazards affecting the bagh are assessed and ranked according to the levels of risk. This 
involves information collection, synthesis and analysis of the natural hazards, considering their 
impacts  on the  local  community  over  the  last  five  to  ten  years  using  a historical  timeline.  This 
information  should  be  available  from  the  soum  administration  and  LEMA.  The  soum  Project 
Adviser will need to support the bagh NG to collect and assess this information (some may be 
too technical for the bagh NG members to understand). 
The information which must be collected, combined and analysed includes: 
(i) 
Identifying the natural hazards and their impact on the bagh. 
(ii)  Analysing  the  characteristics  of  each  natural  hazard,  according  to:  when  they  occur, 
their warning signs, frequency, degree of impact, abnormal events, causes, increasing 
or decreasing trends, and levels of risk, considering climate change. 
(iii)  Consulting  with  LEMA,  NEMA,  and  the  Institute  of  Meteorology  and  Hydrology, 
Ulaanbaatar (via the soum Field Officer) to get climate change trends and impacts on 
natural hazards. 
Vulnerability assessment  
Vulnerability assessment includes information collection, synthesis and analysis of each natural 
hazard  on  bagh  residents,  infrastructure,  social,  cultural  and  economic  activities  vulnerable  to 
damage.  
The information which must be collected, combined and analysed includes: 
(i)  Basic (direct, indirect, objective and subjective) root causes of vulnerability. 
(ii)  Disaggregating data collected by sex, age and vulnerable groups. 
(iii)  Essential  systems  of  the  bagh,  for  example,  water  supply,  food  supply  and  other 
services, drainage, transport, and communications. 
(iv)  Areas at risk, for example, low-lying areas, or areas near forests or steppe land with a 
history of fires. 
(v)  Development in the soum or bagh, for example, new construction, building new roads 
may adversely affect natural drainage. 
Capacity assessment 
Capacity assessment for DRM collects, combines and analyses information of existing human, 
financial, and material resources, and of the structural and non-structural measures in the bagh 
and soum. This involves: 
(i)  Assessing  existing  skills  and  previous  experience  of  individuals,  households  and 
(ii) 
families in the bagh that can be used before, during and after natural hazards. 
Identifying  where  the  resources  are  located,  who  is  responsible  for  managing  them, 
how to use and mobilise them. 
Assessing disaster risk awareness of bagh NG, and other local people  
Assessing  the  awareness  of  bagh  residents  of  disaster  risk  involves  information  collection, 
synthesis  and  analysis  of  the  existing  knowledge  of  local  people  of  DRM  and  previous 
experience responding to natural hazards. 
Step 4 Developing the bagh DRM Action Plan 
1.  Objectives 
  Draft the bagh DRM Action Plan. See Annex XX for a template for a bagh DRM Action 
Plan. 
95
96 
Appendix 4 
 
Integrate key DRM and climate change issues arising from the bagh DRA into the soum 
Emergency Management Plan [ and yearly soum socio-economic development plan]. 
2.  Activities 
a.  Preparation 
  Under the authority of the bagh governor [and soum administration], the bagh NG draft 
the bagh DRM Action Plan based on the bagh DRA. 
b.  Organise a bagh consultation meeting  
  The  bagh  NG  Team  Leader  (with  the  support  of  the  Soum  Field  Officer)  organises  a 
meeting with a wide range of bagh residents to report the findings, lessons learned and 
recommendations  from  the  bagh  DRA,  present  the  draft  bagh  DRM  Action  Plan,  and 
collect feedback. 
  Based  on  the  feedback,  the  bagh  NG  Team  Leader  (supported  by  other  bagh  NG 
members and the Soum Field Officer) complete the bagh DRM Action Plan.  
c.  Finish and approve the bagh DRM Action Plan  
  The bagh NG Team Leader (supported by other bagh NG members and the Soum Field 
Officer) is responsible for finishing and carrying out the bagh DRM Action Plan.  
  The bagh NG Team Leader presents the bagh DRM  Action Plan to the bagh governor 
for approval. 
3.  Outcomes 
  The bagh DRM Action Plan approved by the bagh governor. 
  Key DRM and climate change issues from bagh DRM Action Plan are integrated into the 
soum  Emergency  Management  Plan,  [and  yearly  soum  socio-economic  development 
plan]. For example, key content may include measures to: 
o  Minimize the impact of natural hazards on socio-economic development. 
o  Reduce disaster risks and mitigate adverse impacts on the environment. 
o  Build infrastructure. 
o  Provide resources for carrying out CBDRM. 
Step 5 Implementing the bagh DRM Action Plan  
1.  Objectives 
Carry out the bagh DRM Action Plan, developed from the bagh DRA, involving the bagh NG and 
other bagh and soum residents. 
2.  Activities 
(i) 
The  bagh  NG  Team  Leader  holds  a  meeting  to  tell  people  about  the  approved  bagh 
DRM Action Plan and give feedback on recommendations included in the plan. 
(ii)  Financial and human resources are mobilised from the bagh and soum administration, 
and from the local people to realize the bagh DRM Action Plan. 
3.  Outcome 
96
Appendix 4 
97 
To carry out the bagh DRM Action Plan efficiently, three kinds of actions need addressing, those 
that:  
(i)  Can be fulfilled by the bagh NG with the support of other bagh residents  
(ii)  Need some external help to start, and  
(iii)  Can only be carried out by specialised agencies from outside the bagh. 
To implement the bagh DRM Action Plan, the bagh NG, supported by the Soum Field Officerwill 
organise  actions,  and  coordinate  any  external  provision.  Above  all,  measures  should  be 
coordinated with soum and aimag administration, LEMA and NEMA (depending on the scale). 
Key issues are to: 
Involve the private sector. 
(i) 
(ii)  Mobilise participation of scientific agencies, organisations, individuals, and teachers. 
(iii)  Encourage donors, I/LNGOs and civil society organisations to support and cooperate 
with the bagh NG and local people to carry out the bagh DRM Action Plan. 
(iv)  Promote research and apply science and technology in carrying out activities. 
(v)  Review  and  adjust  the bagh  DRM  Action  Plan each  year  to  make  sure  it  reflects the 
situation. 
Step 6 Participatory monitoring and evaluation 
1.  Objectives 
(i)  Create a communication system to convey information to the local people and others 
about activities under the bagh DRM Action Plan. 
(ii)  Monitor  and  review  progress  and  implementation  of  the  activities  in  the  bagh  DRM 
(iii) 
Action Plan and whether these achieve the planned objectives. 
Identify  any  problems  or  issues  arising  during  implementation  and  address  as 
necessary. 
(iv)  Collect  information  for  reporting  and  document  lessons  learned  to  feedback  into  the 
bagh DRM Action Plan for the coming year. 
(v)  Evaluate relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, impact and sustainability.  
(vi)  Develop  a  feedback  system  encouraging  regular  learning  and  sharing  among  local 
people,  the  bagh  NG,  the  Soum  Project  Adviser  and  other  stakeholders  to  improve 
future implementation. 
(vii)  Draw lessons learned and good practice. 
2.  Principles 
(i)  Ensure  involvement  of  bagh  NG,  other  local  people,  the  bagh  governor,  soum  and 
other government authorities and relevant agencies.  
(ii)  Encourage  open  sharing  among  relevant  parties.  Provide  a  mechanism  for  feedback 
on actions taken, methods and guidelines. 
(iii)  Underline  a  participatory  M&E,  based  on  a  practical,  experiential  and  learning.  Local 
people and organisations involved should improve their skills, strengthen their capacity 
in  planning,  problem-solving  and  decision-making.  Further,  they  should  gain  a  better 
understanding of reasons that might affect actions, and reasons for success or failure. 
(iv)  Make sure the participatory M&E is flexible and adaptive and fits local circumstances 
and needs. 
3.  Activities   
(i) 
The method, indicators, expected results, and potential impacts discussed and agreed 
by the bagh NG and Soum Field Officer. 
(ii)  The  bagh  NG  and  Soum  Field  Officerdevelop  a  M&E  plan  and  present  to  the  bagh 
governor for approval. 
97
98 
Appendix 4 
(iii)  The  bagh  NG  publicises  the  M&E  plan  to  other  bagh  residents  and  coordinates  the 
M&E during the carrying out of the bagh DRM Action Plan. 
(iv)  The  bagh  NG  carry  out  M&E  based  on  the  objectives  and  content  of  the  approved 
bagh DRM Action Plan 
(v)  The bagh NG collects M&E information and prepares a M&E report. 
(vi)  The bagh NG holds regular meetings with local people to gather information for M&E 
and  provides  an  update  on  the  results  of  the  bagh  DRA  and  carrying  out  the  bagh 
DRM Action Plan. 
(vii)  The M&E results are shared with the soum administration, LEMA and NEMA. 
4.  Outcome 
(i)  A M&E plan, developed and carried out with local people. 
(ii)  CBDRM carried out effectively and satisfactorily.  
(iii)  Ensure accountability is applied and helps improve management and decision-making.  
(iv)  M&E helps define outstanding issues and activities not completed as planned.

1.  Rationale for the Soum Disaster Risk Management Plan 
Disaster risk management (DRM) aims to avoid, lessen or transfer the adverse effects of natural 
hazards through prevention, mitigation and preparedness and measures. The Soum DRM Plan 
includes: 
a) 
b) 
c) 
d) 
e) 
An  outline  of  the  natural  hazards  in  the  soum,  including  information  on  dzud,  forest  and 
steppe  fires,  and  other  natural  hazards  which  resulted  in  disaster.  This  information, 
collected in each bagh by the bagh Neighborhood Group (NG) is consolidated in this Plan. 
Previous DRM actions carried out and experiences gained by the bagh, soum and aimag 
administrations  suitable  for  addressing  common  natural  hazards  and  risk  in  the  soum, 
paying attention to vulnerable groups. The contents and measures include:  
(i)  Activities to improve local people’s awareness about DRM 
(ii)  Elaborating the bagh DRM Action Plans for specific natural hazards 
(iii)  Evacuation routes and sites  
(iv)  Necessary training and drills on DRM 
Providing  clarity  on  the  roles  and  responsibilities  of  the  bagh  and  soum  administrations, 
the  Emergency  Commission  of  the  soum,  the  Specialized  Emergency  Response  Unit  of 
the  soum,  the  bagh  governor.  the  bagh  NG,  and  other  local  people  in  carrying  out  the 
Soum DRM Plan. 
Supplies, and equipment and other essentials for DRM. 
Proposals  for  resources  and  setting  schedules  for  carrying  out  the  plan  in  each  bagh 
during the year. 
To carry out DRM efficiently, minimize the damage caused by natural hazards, and contribute to 
the  socio-economic  development  of  the  soum,  the  Soum  Administration  makes  the  following 
Soum Disaster Risk Management Plan.3 
2.  Objective 
1.  Publicize,  train,  and  provide  knowledge  on  DRM  and  the  impact  of  natural  hazards  on  the 
safety of lives and property of people living in the soum. 
3  No single format for a Soum Disaster Risk Management (DRM) Plan can be applied to all localities. The contents 
will need to be specified or adjusted to maximize its effectiveness, depending on the situation and realities of each 
soum, and its natural hazards. 
100
Appendix 4 
101 
2.  Identify responsibilities of organizations and individuals in the soum on DRM under the law. 
3.  Mitigate, and respond at once to natural hazards to minimize damage to people and property 
and recover effectively.   
4.  Ensure  bagh  Disaster  Risk  Management  Action  Plans  are  integrated  fully  into  the  Soum 
Disaster Risk Management Plan. 
5.  Strengthen capacity to deal locally with emergencies, support the bagh administration, bagh 
NGs, and emergency response teams to respond effectively. 
6.  Increase  awareness  on  community  based  DRM,  promoting  self-reliance,  and  local  people 
responsibilities to reduce the impact of natural hazards in their bagh. 
7.  Provide information to integrate into socio-economic development planning.4

7.  Capacity assessment 
From  bagh  DRM  action  Plans  and  bagh  DRA  decide  the  available  resources  of  the  bagh  NG 
and  of  local  people  (strengthens,  weaknesses,  capacities)  that  can  be  mobilized  for  DRM,  to 
address the following: 
(i)  What are the key human, financial and material resources of the soum administration? 
For  example,  the  soum  Emergency  Commission,  the  soum  Specialized  Emergency 
Response  Unit,  among  bagh  NGs,  in  the  soum  center,  the  bagh  governor  and 
administration.  
(ii)  What  is  available  from  the  aimag  and  national  level  administration,  from  LEMA  and 
NEMA? 
(iii)  What  experience,  skills and  equipment  do  the bagh  NGs  have  that can  be  mobilized 
and used by the bagh and soum administration? 
(iv)  What  is  the  organizational  capacity  to  evacuate  local  people  (for  example,  location, 
facilities, and organizations)? 
(v)  What  rescue  capacity  exists  at  the  soum  center  and  in  each  bagh  (for  example, 
people, vehicles, and equipment)? 
(vi)  What  critical  infrastructure  exists  (for  example,  hospitals  and  clinics,  permanent 
housing, and evacuation centers)?

(vii)  A diagram maybe used to show interrelationships. 
9.  Soum disaster risk management actions 
Raising public awareness  
The  awareness  of  local  people  on  hazard  risk,  and  their  understanding  of  DRM  should  be 
understood  (as  part  of  the  bagh  DRA)  to  make  a  plan  to  increase  awareness  of  local  people. 
The following need to be addressed: 
104
Appendix 4 
105 
(i)  What public awareness and public education is needed for local people to strengthen 
understanding of DRM in the bagh and soum center? What can each household do to 
reduce the effects of a specific natural hazard? 
(ii)  What training and capacity building is needed for disaster response teams? 
(iii)  How is it best to tell all the residents of the soum of the Soum DRM Plan? 
Early warning  
Early  warning  contributes  to  reducing  the  effects  of  natural  hazards.  To  prepare  for  a  natural 
hazard, it is essential early warning systems (EWS) are effective and understood by the bagh 
NGs and local people, and the bagh NGs involve fully in transferring early warning both up the 
administrative levels - to the bagh governor, soum administration, LEMA and NEMA, and to the 
local bagh residents.  
The  Plan  should  identify  the  means  of  communication,  the  soum  staff  and  bagh  NG  Team 
Leaders  responsible  for  forewarning  people,  and  those  responsible  for  accessing  the 
information, even if public means of communication do not work. It is essential local people will 
know what to do when they hear or see warning signals. 
Humanitarian needs assessment 
Assessing  damage  following  a  disaster  is  the  responsibility  of  the  soum  and  aimag 
administration, LEMA and NEMA and will be supported by the bagh NGs. The Mongolian Red 
Cross also undertakes humanitarian needs assessment. Such assessment needs to be applied 
quickly and accurately for the response to be timely and effective. 
The Plan should stipulate: 
(i)  What role the bagh governors assign to bagh NG Team Leaders in assessing damage 
and humanitarian needs.  
(ii)  When each bagh NG should send their report to the bagh governor; who is responsible 
for collecting these and submitting to the soum administration, and to LEMA and from 
there to NEMA. 
Damage  and  humanitarian  assessment  information  includes  the:  affected  areas,  severity, 
affected households, specific damage in the locality, names of the affected bagh, most affected 
herder  groups,  households,  livestock  losses,  which  is  collected,  collated  and  analyzed  by  the 
soum administration before sending to the aimag administration, LEMA and NEMA7.  
Evacuation 
Evacuation of people and livestock from affected areas before, or during a natural hazard may 
be needed to reduce loss of life, and will be minimized if carried out timely. According to each 
natural hazard, the soum evacuation plan for the people, livestock and property, identifies: 
(i)  Where and who to evacuate 
(ii)  Safe routes to the evacuation places 
(iii)  Location  of  temporary  evacuation  areas  and  nearest  airfields  for  use  during  an 
emergency 
(iv)  The person (s) in charge of the evacuation. 
Search and rescue 
7  For  the  Red  Cross,  humanitarian  need  assessment  should  be  undertaken  according  to  the  relevant  Red  Cross 
guidelines. 
105
106 
Appendix 4 
Search and rescue can reduce risks and the loss of life. In any disaster response, the first task 
is to begin a search for missing people and reunite lost family members. The plan identifies: 
Location, and number of trained search and rescue teams 
(i) 
(ii)  An outline for search and rescue techniques (and references to more detailed training 
resources) 
(iii)  Equipment for the Specialized Emergency Response Unit of the soum 
(iv)  Basic equipment for the bagh NGs for search and rescue  
Key questions include: 
(i)  How to contact and comfort the relatives of the people who are missing, or who have 
died, or have lost livestock. 
(ii)  Who  is  responsible  for  family  reunification  activities?  What  communication  methods 
will be used to reunite family members? For example, the Red Cross. 
Water and sanitation 
In an emergency, freshwater is often scarce. This shortage may cause serious health problems, 
as people may have to drink dirty water. The supply of fresh drinking water should be prioritized 
in emergencies. Key concerns in water and sanitation include provision of fresh drinking water, 
areas for human defecation, areas for animal shelter and garbage disposal. The Plan identifies: 
(i)  People  in  charge  of  water  and  sanitation  within  the  soum  and  bagh  administration, 
among the bagh NGs, and other organizations 
(ii)  Safe  water  sources,  and  guidance  for  people  on  how  to  store,  preserve  and  clean 
water  sources,  for  example,  the  use  of  alum,  Water  Purification  Tablets  and  water 
filters 
(iii)  Treatment methods for waste, and disposal of bodies of animals 
(iv)  The readiness of the local health units in human resources, medicines and means to 
temporary  sanitation 
treat  water  sources,  and  provide 
the  situation, 
assess 
arrangements. 
Shelter 
In  some  situations,  it  may  be  necessary  to  provide  temporary  shelter  to  those  whose  houses 
were  destroyed  or  are no  longer safe.  The  soum  and  bagh  administration,  with  the  support  of 
the  bagh  NGs  will  need  help  local  households  to  repair  houses,  deliver  materials  to  make 
temporary  shelters  in  safe  places.  The  following  key  questions  should  be  considered  in  the 
Plan: 
(i)  Who  are  the  people  in  charge  of  this  aspect  of  response  in  the  soum  and  bagh 
administrations, and in the bagh NGs? 
(ii)  How to contact suppliers?  
(iii)  How to get to people locate their ger and livestock to safe areas?  
(iv)  How to provide basic water and sanitation? 
(v)  Which organizations are responsible? 
(vi)  How many households need to be provided with temporary shelters? Where are these 
shelters be located? 
Food supply 
Before,  during  or  after  a  major  hazard  it  may  be  necessary  to  provide  food  to  people  and 
livestock in the soum. The following key questions should be considered in the Plan: 
(i)  Who within the soum and bagh administration, and the bagh NGs, the Red Cross, or 
other organizations is responsible for assessing the need for food for people and their 
livestock? 
106
Appendix 4 
107 
(ii)  What food is available in the bagh and soum, or from surrounding areas in the aimag, 
or neighboring aimag? What capacity exists to deliver? It is ideal to know the price of 
each supply (for example, a list common foods, quantity, prices, suppliers and contact 
details should be annexed to the Plan) 
(iii)  Where are the main soum animal food storage facilities? 
(iv)  What is the distribution plan to get food to people and fodder to animals?  
(v)  How to organize the bagh NGs to provide food to affected local people? 
(vi)  How to advise local people to prepare food reserves? 
First Aid and medical aid 
Casualties are unavoidable in disasters. Minimizing suffering casualties depends on timely and 
effective first aid. The Plan needs to consider the following questions: 
(i)  Which bagh NGs and how many people will take part in search and rescue? Are they 
ready? Have they received suitable training? Do the local people and bagh and soum 
administration and other internal (and external search and rescue teams) government 
recognize their role? 
(ii)  Are the local medical care facilities ready? For example, staff on duty in the office at 
the affected areas, essential medicines and equipment available and operational? Are 
there suitable means of transport available? 
(iii)  What  potential  diseases  or  epidemics  may  occur?  Are  the  bagh  and  soum 
administration and bagh NGs prepared for such eventualities? 
Health and nutrition 
Access  to  safe  water,  good  sanitary  conditions  of  houses  and  proper  nutrition  help  avoid 
diseases. The following health and nutrition issues should be considered in planning: 
(i)  Who is responsible for coordination with the Health Department at the different levels? 
(ii)  Who is responsible for emergency health and nutrition needs? 
(iii)  What local health care exist? What is the aimag, soum, and bagh health capacity? Is 
there any need for support? 
(iv)  Where  can  Department  of  Health  conduct  vaccinations  for  infectious  diseases  (for 
example, measles)? 
(v)  Which INGOs and Red Cross are responsible for health care, disease prevention and 
public health campaigns? What role do these play in disseminating health messages? 
(vi)  What  should  support  is  likely  to  help  widows,  people  over  60,  children,  pregnant 
women,  single  people  and  people  with  disabilities,  and  other  family  members  to 
safeguard their health and nutrition? 
(vii)  What are the needs for medication and medical equipment? What might be needed?  
Communication 
Efficient  communication  before,  during  and  after  a  major  hazard  is  essential.  Plans  have  to 
consider a worst-case scenario in which lines of normal communication maybe cut temporally. 
Information exchange is important for good coordination in disaster response. The Soum DRM 
Plan should consider the worst-case scenario and problems that are likely to occur. Solutions to 
these  problems  should  be  outlined,  so  the  aimag  administration,  LEMA,  NEMA,  and  other 
organizations outside the disaster areas can be updated regularly. 
Logistics 
It  is  important  to  keep  a  well-functioning  response.  Therefore,  the  following  issues  about 
warehouses, means of transport and access need to be considered: 
107
108 
Appendix 4 
(i)  What are the means of transport that can be organized from the bagh NGs and other 
local  people,  or  easily  accessed  for  search  and  rescue,  emergency  relief  supply  and 
evacuation? 
(ii)  What  other  transport  suppliers  exist  in  the  soum,  aimag  or  elsewhere  besides 
preparation  by  the  bagh  NGs?  For  example,  bagh  and  soum  administration  should 
negotiate  in  advance  with  owners  of  various  means  of  transport  to  make  certain 
different means of transport are available 
(iii)  Which other organizations can help in the supply of relief items? Is contact information 
updated? 
Other activities 
Other  activities  can  be  added  according  to  the  situation  in  the  soum.  For  example,  specific 
equipment such as bulldozers, heaving lifting machinery, and road clearing equipment may be 
needed;  places  where  temporary  shelter,  water  tanks,  water  pumps,  generators,  and  storage; 
UN, non-government and Red Cross leaders and DRM personnel contact details.  
10. Disaster preparedness 
The following issues need to be addressed to carrying out disaster preparedness in the soum: 
(i)  How  will  public  awareness  and  public  education  be  carried  out  to  help  increase 
capacity of local people in disaster preparedness? 
(ii)  How  effective  is  the  soum  and  bagh  early  warning  system?  What  improvements  are 
needed to increase reliability and coverage? Is training needed?  
(iii)  How up to date are the soum risk maps? 
(iv)  What  materials,  facilities,  equipment  and  supplies  need  to  be  prepared  for  disaster 
response? 
(v)  Are  the  roles  and  responsibilities  of  all  stakeholders  at  soum  and  bagh  level  clear  in 
disaster preparedness, response, search and rescue, and recovery? 
(vi)  Which structural and non-structural measures are needed in each bagh to safeguard 
the well-being of livestock? 
(vii)  What  critical  infrastructure8  in  the  soum,  needs  protecting,  through  retrofitting  in 
preparation for dzuds, fires and other hazards to safeguard functioning (and if needed, 
as evacuation centers)?  
(viii)  Have evacuation routes, plans, locations and sites been prepared? 
11. Disaster response 
The following main points need to be outlined:  
(i) 
Is  there  enough  security,  fully  functioning  transport,  communication  equipment,  and 
generators? Is there back-up? 
(ii)  Have disaster response skills of the soum Emergency Commission, soum Specialized 
Emergency Response Unit, and of bagh NGs been updated through training, refresher 
courses, and rehearsals? 
(iii)  Are  materials,  facilities,  equipment  and  resources  for  response  to  different  natural 
hazards ready? 
8  For  example,  schools,  clinic  centers,  soum  and  bagh  administration  offices,  cultural  centers,  and  other  public 
places. 
108
Appendix 4 
109 
Response plan for specific natural hazards 
Details of response actions for the following natural hazards should be provided: 
Dzud, forest fires, steppe fires, earthquakes, drought and salinity, storms, heavy rain, flooding, 
flash flooding, and landslides, and other hazards. 
12. Recovery 
Based  on  experience  and  good  practice  from  elsewhere  carry  out  damage  and  needs 
assessments and begin early recovery. 
Damage and needs assessment  
Key questions that need to be addressed include: 
(i)  Who  will  help  the  soum  to  carry  out  a  damage  and  needs  assessment,  and  propose 
remedial  plan?  For  example,  the  soum  Specialized  Emergency  Response  Unit,  the 
Red Cross and bagh NGs  
(ii)  What short-, medium- and long-term support for food, and non-food items are needed 
to help stabilize people’s lives? 
(iii)  What livestock, feed, materials, equipment, and fuel is needed to recover livelihoods? 
(iv)  Who will organize water, sanitation and hygiene? 
(v)  Who will help the soum administration and soum Emergency Commission to plan and 
propose  repairing,  restoration  and  upgrading  of:  transport,  communication,  electricity, 
schools, health care centers, and other public infrastructure? 
Early recovery 
(i)  What  emergency  employment,  including  cash  for  work  and  start-up  grants  to 
recapitalize local businesses is needed? 
(ii)  How can community infrastructure be rehabilitated to improve access to basic services 
as well as revitalize the local economy? 
(iii)  Who  will  be  responsible  for  debris  management,  to  ease  access  and  rebuild 
infrastructure? 
(iv)  What support is the soum and bagh administration likely to need? How can soum and 
bagh  capacity  be  strengthened  for  relief  and  recovery  planning,  coordination  and 
implementation, improving the capacity for local risk management? 
5. Carrying out the Soum DRM Plan 
Assigning responsibilities and organizing implementation 
Conditions to make certain the Soum DRM Plan is carried out include involvement of the bagh 
NGs  and  other  local  people  in  DRM  planning  plays  an  important  role  in  guaranteeing  the 
feasibility of the Soum DRM Plan. The Plan is reliant on good quality bagh DRM Action Plans 
(based on bagh DRA), raising awareness of local people, the capacity of the bagh governor and 
administration and the soum administration, the bagh NGs, and other local people. 
The soum and bagh administrations, supported by the bagh NGs have responsibility to the local 
people to tell them of the Soum DRM Plan and their roles and responsibilities to fulfil this Plan. 
A  meeting  at  the  soum  center  needs  to  be  organized  to  inform  the  aimag  and  bagh 
administrations,  the  bagh  NGs,  other  key  stakeholders  and  local  people  about  the  approved 
Soum DRM Plan. 
109
110 
Appendix 4 
Identify resources for the Soum DRM Plan 
Organizations, households and individuals in the bagh are resources to help complete the Soum 
DRM Plan, including: 
(i)  Aimag, soum and bagh administration contingency Funds. 
(ii)  Support from the State Budget  
(iii)  Resources  from  political  and  social  organizations  in  the  bagh,  for  example  the  Red 
Cross 
(iv)  Facilities, equipment and other needs from local people 
(v)  Public information and mass media  
(vi)  Voluntary contributions from private sector organizations and individuals. 
(vii)  Support from the international community. 
6. Monitor, supervise, evaluate and update the Soum DRM Plan 
The  Plan  needs  to  outline  monitoring,  supervising,  evaluating  and  updating,  and  to  identify 
timelines  for  each.  The  Soum  DRM  Plan  is  not  a  ‘one  off’  exercise  but  needs  to  be  updated 
every  year  based  on  experience,  and  lessons  learned,  and  changing  socio-economies  of  the 
bagh, soum and aimag change. It is the responsibility of the soum administration, supported by 
the bagh governors and bagh NGs to update the Soum DRM Plan.  
Carrying out the Soum DRM Plan needs regular monitoring and supervision. Responsibilities for 
this need outlining in the Plan.  
At  the  end  of  the  year,  or  after  any  disaster,  a  review  of  the  effectiveness  of  the  Soum  DRM 
Plan should carried out and adjustments made to the Plan for the following year. 
(i)  Reference  lessons  learned,  information  that  needs  updating,  and  actions  that  need 
adjusting 
(ii)  Disseminate  good  practice  to  other  soum  administrations  in  the  aimag,  with 
neighboring  aimags,  and  elsewhere;  share  information  through  the  bagh  NGs  with 
local people.  
(iii)  Propose  to  aimag  administration,  LEMA  and  NEMA  the  need  to  resolve  recurring 
problems.

ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PLAN 
This  Environmental  Management  Plan  (EMP)  is  developed  for  MON  (48236):  Strengthening 
Community Resilience to Dzud, and Forest and Steppe Fires. It defines the basic requirements 
for implementation and supervision of minor civil works. The EMP requires the contractor to plan 
for  construction,  including  consultation  with  potentially  affected  stakeholders  e.g.  nearby 
communities. It also defines good environmental and housekeeping practices, occupational and 
community health and safety requirements, and communication requirements. The EMP will be 
included in the tender documents and will form part of all civil works contracts. Contractors are 
expected  to  follow  these  requirements  and  develop  site-specific  EMPs  (site-EMPs)  for 
implementing  these  measures.  The  contractors  will  be  made  aware  of  their  obligations  to 
comply with this EMP, and to budget EMP implementation costs in their bids.
