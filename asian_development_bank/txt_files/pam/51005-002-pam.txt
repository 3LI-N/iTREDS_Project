1.  The project administration manual (PAM) describes the essential administrative and management 
requirements to implement the project on time, within budget, and in accordance with the policies 
and procedures of the government and Asian Development Bank (ADB). The PAM should include 
references to  all  available  templates  and  instructions  either  through  linkages  to  relevant  URLs  or 
directly incorporated in the PAM. 
2.  The  Chongqing  Municipal  Government  (CMG),  the  executing  agency;  the  Liangping  District 
Government  (LDG),  Dianjiang  County  Government  (DCG),  and  Changshou  District  Government 
(CDG),  the  implementing  agencies;  are  wholly  responsible  for  the  implementation  of  the  ADB 
financed  project,  as  agreed  jointly  between  the  borrower  and  ADB,  and  in  accordance  with  the 
policies  and  procedures  of  the  government  and  ADB’s.  ADB  staff  is  responsible  supporting 
implementation  including  compliance  by  CMG,  LDG,  DCG  and  CDG  of  their  obligations  and 
responsibilities for project implementation in accordance with ADB’s policies and procedures. 
3.  At loan negotiations, the borrower and ADB shall agree to the PAM and ensure consistency with the 
legal agreements. Such agreement shall be reflected in the minutes of the loan negotiations. In the 
event of any discrepancy or contradiction between the PAM and the legal agreements, the provisions 
of the legal agreements shall prevail. 
4.  After  ADB  Board  approval  of  the  project's  report  and  recommendations  of  the  President  (RRP), 
changes  in  implementation  arrangements  are  subject  to  agreement  and  approval  pursuant  to 
relevant  government  and  ADB  administrative  procedures  (including  the  Project  Administration 
Instructions) and upon such approval, they will be subsequently incorporated in the PAM.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
1. 
The project will help the Chongqing Municipal Government (CMG) maintain environmental 
sustainability, leading to improved living conditions in the entire Longxi River watershed, a Yangtze 
River sub-basin in the municipality. This will be achieved through the implementation of an integrated 
approach to manage flooding, the water environment, and ecology collectively with a well-balanced 
mix of structural and nonstructural interventions, including capacity building. 
A. 
Rationale  
2. 
Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB) covers nine provinces and two specially administered 
cities in the Yangtze River Basin. It accounts for over 40% of the People’s Republic of China’s (PRC) 
population and has 40% of the freshwater resources. It also serves as the drinking water resource 
for 400 million people, provides 60% of the total fisheries production, has 20% of the total wetland 
area, and contributes about 45% of the PRC’s economic output. YREB has been earmarked as one 
of the three key growth engines to ensure the PRC’s future economic development.1 
3. 
YREB has benefitted from extensive development since 1990s, particularly in the delta area. 
Yet, economic growth in the middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze River Basin is lagging and 
below its potential capacity. The middle and upper reaches of YREB still face significant development 
challenges because of (i) slow transformation for green development and economic diversification; 
(ii)  limited  integration  of  waterways,  ports,  and  intermodal  logistics;  (iii) increasing  pollution  and 
pressure on natural resources; and (iv) weak institutional coordination for strategic planning.2 YREB 
faces a growing imbalance between economic achievements and the quality of the environment. 
4. 
Since 1980, YREB has suffered over $0.3 trillion in direct economic damage from recurring 
floods, accounting for 75% of the total flood damage in the PRC. Most flood damage does not come 
from the main stem river but from small to moderate-sized river sub-basins. YREB suffered from fatal 
floods  in  2016 that caused  $28  billion  of  economic  damage,  declaring emergencies  at more than 
3,300 locations. Of those, over 3,200 were reported on small tributaries that generally have lower 
standards  of  flood  protection  or  where  standards  have  not  kept  pace  with  the  rapid  rate  of 
development or intensifying extreme rainfall events caused by global climatic changes. Since 1980, 
water pollution has risen by 73% mainly because of the direct discharge of domestic, industrial, and 
agricultural waste, making water unfit for consumptive and productive use. The upper and middle 
reaches account for 80% of YREB’s total wastewater discharge and the tributaries have the worst 
water quality in the Yangtze River Basin.3 The hydrological variability caused by rapid urbanization 
and  industrialization  has  had  a  large  contribution  to  water  pollution  and  has  increased  flood 
frequency and magnitude. The enormity of the losses suffered during 2000–2017 merits a review of 
policies and practices in  the  PRC.  Priority  is  yet  to be given  to improve water  interception,  water 
quality,  flood  risk  mitigation,  and  ecological  protection  in  upstream  areas,  mainly  sub-basins,  to 
ensure the water flowing downstream is clean and free of flood risk.

Development Strategy.

3  YREB produces about 81% of the country’s chemical fibers, 58% of pesticides, and 51% of fertilizers. This has come at 
high environmental costs. Ministry of Ecology and Environment. 2013. MEP Releases State of Environmental Quality of 
China in 2012.  
2 
Chongqing  Municipality,  the  largest  urban  area  in  the  upper  YREB,  plays  a critical  role  in 
5. 
environmental  and conservation  efforts  in the  region.4 However,  many  rural  towns  and  villages in 
Chongqing  are  left  behind  from  overall  development  because  of  insufficient  public  infrastructure, 
continued  flood  disasters,  worsening  water  pollution,  and  degraded  ecological  conditions.  The 
traditional approach taken by CMG to flood control relies solely on structural measures, which are 
no longer feasible. The link between flood management, environmental degradation, and ecosystem 
sustainability  needs  to  be  addressed.  An  integrated  approach  is  necessary  to  adapt  to  changing 
social, geophysical, and environmental conditions, leading to integrated flood and environmental risk 
management (FERM) as an approach to be adopted by the municipality. 
6. 
Chongqing is a core part of the ecological conservation zone of the Three Gorges Reservoir, 
which  plays  a  pivotal  role  in  mitigating  floods  in  the  middle  and  lower  Yangtze  River  reaches. 
However, Chongqing has suffered from seven fatal floods since 2007. Longxi River watershed is one 
of the worst flood-impacted areas, with only 10% of river reach protected by levees for less than 5-
year return period floods.5 The old concrete dams in Longxi River are no longer beneficial as they 
are filled up with sediment and their operation is not compatible with emerging FERM needs. The 
annual average flood damage in Longxi River watershed is about CNY1.71 billion, with fatal flooding 
in 2010, 2014, 2016, and 2017. 
7. 
Chongqing  produces  7%  (1.5  billion  tons)  of  household  and  18%  (355  million  tons)  of 
industrial  wastewater  in  YREB  annually—among  the  highest  values  per  unit  area  in  YREB.  The 
annual average solid waste volume is more than 30 million tons in Chongqing, of which only 14% is 
being treated. Inadequate management of waste has resulted in poor water quality in Chongqing’s 
rivers and lakes, which exceeds the national standard (class III) at various locations, specifically in 
the Longxi River  watershed.6 The fast-paced industrialization (50%) and urbanization (45%) rates 
along the Longxi River corridor, without proper planning, have put pressure on water resources. The 
floods formed  many  belts  of floating rubbish  in the  Longxi  River,  which exacerbated flooding and 
water  pollution.  Despite  the  availability  of  treatment  facilities,  over  40%  of  residents  and  80%  of 
industries in the watershed do not benefit due to the lack of sewer network. Unsustainable farming 
resulted in high sediment yield and poor water operation practices have worsen the water quality in 
Shuanggui and Sanhe lakes (small lakes) in the watershed. Water quality in Changshou Lake in the 
lower Longxi River watershed has also deteriorated because of eutrophication. 
8. 
Wetlands  account  for  2.5%  of  the  total  area  in  Chongqing  while  green  spaces  make  up 
4.3%—the lowest in YREB. In the municipality, the Longxi River watershed suffers the most from 
human-induced  ecological  destruction.  The  hydrology  and  environment  of  the  Longxi  River 
watershed are modified through long-term  human activities,  including  agriculture  and small  water 
infrastructure (e.g., barrages), which regulate river flows and habitat clearance. Since 1990, about 
60% of the wetlands and 35% of the vegetated areas in this watershed have disappeared and over 
41%  of  the  land  area  has  been  exposed  to  water-induced  soil  erosion,  resulting  in  reduced  river 
conveyance, flooding, reservoir shrinkage, and water contamination. The climate change impact in 
the  watershed  is  likely  to  (i)  worsen  the  water  quality  because  of  increased  temperature  and 
decreased river flow, and (ii) increase floods as a result of increased rainfall intensity. 
4  Chongqing Municipality comprises 38 districts and counties over 82,400 square kilometers, and has a population of 33.7 
million of which over 39% is rural. 
5  Longxi River Basin in Chongqing Municipality has an area of 2,966 square kilometers (about 30 kilometers long) with 
2.1 million population. The river originates in Liangping District, passes through Dianjiang County, and merges with the 
Yangtze River in Changshou District. The basin is located about 200 kilometers north of Chongqing City. 
6  Following the PRC’s Environmental Water Quality Standard (GB 3838-2002), up to class III water is suitable for drinking.

Coordination among the upstream and downstream local governments in the Longxi River 
9. 
watershed has not yet been established because of a lack of participatory watershed development 
planning.  The  institutional  capacity  of  local  governments  to  implement  FERM  is  still  weak.  To 
facilitate sustainable development and enhance livelihoods, accommodate growing population, and 
in  development  planning  and 
attract 
implementation. The integrated FERM plan and the implementation of critical measures are urgently 
required to promote sustainable development in the watershed, including infrastructure development, 
physical connectivity, and economic competitiveness. Since the watershed is in a less developed 
region, it can demonstrate environmentally sustainable growth model that can be replicated in other 
manageable watersheds in Chongqing, YREB, or the entire PRC. 
investments,  CMG  will  support 
local  governments 
10. 
CMG has formulated the Longxi River Ecological and Restoration Master Plan 2030, as well 
as its Thirteenth Five-Year Plan, 2016–2020, which is aligned with the national Thirteenth Five-Year 
Plan,  2016–2020.  The  implementation  of  these  plans  is  consistent  with  (i) the  guidelines  on  the 
Yangtze  River  Basin  economic  development,  issued  by  the  State  Council  in  2014;  (ii)  the  YREB 
master plan, 2016–2030, issued by the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) in 
2016; and (iii) the river chief system, issued by the PRC’s Central Committee and the State Council 
in  2016  to  promote  green  development,  with  stricter  control  over  water  pollution,  environmental 
protection, rehabilitation, and management of water resources.7 CMG intends to pursue this project 
to bridge the critical development gaps. 
11. 
Strategic fit. In January 2018, the NDRC announced the first batch of national priority river 
basin water environment and sustainable development pilot projects and identified the Longxi River 
Basin  as  one  of  16  pilot  river  basins  nationwide. 8  The  Chongqing  Development  and  Reform 
Commission  adopted  the  pilot  program  in  the  form  of  the  Longxi  River  basin  development  plan, 
2018–2025, for which CMG considers this project a kickoff and benchmark for investment in FERM. 
The project also aims to revitalize the eco-compensation mechanism in the watershed by promoting 
upstream–downstream  links,  and  will  contribute  to  the  PRC’s  goal  of  building  a  harmonious  and 
prosperous  society  through  environmentally  sustainable  growth.  It  is  consistent  with  the  PRC’s 
Thirteenth Five-Year Plan, 2016–2020, which aims to realize “ecological civilization.”9 The project is 
aligned with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) country partnership strategy for the PRC, 2016–
2020, 10  mainly  the  three  major  principles:  (i) managing  climate  change  and  environment,  (ii) 
supporting inclusive economic growth, and (iii) fostering knowledge cooperation. It is also consistent 
with (i) ADB’s Water Operational Plan, 2011–2020, which emphasizes integrated water resources 
management (IWRM) with a focus on water-related disaster risk management;11 and (ii) sustainable 
development goals 6, 11, and 13.12    
Lessons. The project adopts FERM, a cross-sector approach, in a river basin context.13 At

the  technical  level,  the  project  design  has  incorporated  lessons  from  international  practices  and 
previous  ADB-financed  projects  and  policy-oriented  studies  on  IWRM  and  environmental  and 
7   Under the river chief system being applied in the PRC, the heads of local governments are designated as river chiefs to 
be accountable for water and environmental management in their jurisdictions.

IV. 
COST AND FINANCING 
The project is estimated to cost $378.67 million. The major expenditure items that constitute 
23. 
the project are civil works. 
24. 
The  government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $150  million  from  the  ADB’s  ordinary  capital 
resources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 26-year term, including a grace period of 
5 years, an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB’s London interbank offered rate 
(LIBOR)-based lending facility, and an interest rate spread of 0.5% per year, the interest rate and 
other  charges  during  construction  will  not  be  capitalized  in  the  loan,  and  such  other  terms  and 
conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. The government has requested that 
repayment  will  follow  the  straight-line  commitment-linked  repayment  option.  Based  on  the  above 
loan terms and these repayment option and dates, the average loan maturity is 15.75 years and the 
maturity premium payable to ADB is 0.1% per annum. 
25. 
ADB  will  finance  the  expenditures  in  relation  to  civil  works,  goods,  consulting  services, 
capacity development activities, and taxes and duties for eligible ADB-financed expenditures. The 
government  will  finance  designing,  procurement  activities,  and  construction  supervision;  land 
acquisition  and  resettlement;  civil  works;  environmental  protection;  taxes  and  duties;  and 
contingencies. 
Climate mitigation is estimated as $4.65 million and climate adaptation is estimated as $11.23 
26. 
million. ADB will finance 100% of mitigation costs and 84% of adaptation costs. 
A. 
Cost Estimates Preparation and Revisions  
27. 
Cost estimates were prepared on behalf of the CPMO by the feasibility study report design 
institute, in consultation with the IAs and transaction technical consultants, and under the guidance 
of  ADB  project  officer.  Costing  was  completed  using  government  costing  standards,  and  costing 
information from site investigations, and project files of the design institute.  
28. 
Responsibility for revising and updating the cost estimates during implementation rest with 
the  CPMO  and  IAs.  The  CPMO  and  IAs,  supported  by  design  institute,  a  procurement  agent, 
supervision  companies  and  implementation  consultants,  are  responsible  for  the  design  and 
procurement,  and the  administration  and  monitoring  of  contractors  and  suppliers.  The  revision  of 
cost estimates will be undertaken during the execution of these responsibilities. Cost evaluations will 
occur, and revisions will be made as necessary at detailed design, during the review of tenders, and 
during the monitoring of contract execution.  
B. 
Key Assumptions 
29. 
The following key assumptions underpin the cost estimates and financing plan: 
(i) 
(ii)  Price contingencies  based  on  expected  cumulative  inflation  over  the  implementation 
Exchange rate: CNY6.51 = USD1.00 (as of 2 January 2018).  
period are as follows:20 
20  A purchasing power parity model is used to account for international cost inflation.

FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT 
A. 
Financial Management Assessment 
The  financial  management  capacities  of  the  project  county/district  finance  bureaus  and 
30. 
implementing  agencies were  assessed focusing on funds-flow  arrangements,  staffing,  accounting 
policies and procedures, internal and external auditing arrangements, reporting and monitoring, and 
financial information system. 
31. 
The  assessment  determined  that  the  main  financial  management  risks  arise  because  the 
implementing  agencies  and  project  implementing  units  (PIU)  have  not  participated  in  the 
implementation of an ADB loan project. The overall financial management risk is rated as “moderate” 
after considering mitigating measures. The identified risks in financial management will be closely 
monitored during project implementation. 
32. 
It was agreed that the implementing agencies will strengthen their capabilities by (i) setting 
up clear institutional arrangements and coordination mechanisms; (ii) completing staff deployment 
in  appropriate  financial  management  positions  with  English  language  support;  (iii)  developing 
methodologies  for  managing  foreign  exchange  and  interest  rate  risks;  and  (iv)  undertaking  more 
training, particularly on ADB policy and procedures. Table 10 demonstrates a financial risk mitigation 
plan to be adopted by the implementing agencies during the project implementation:

B. 
Disbursement 
1. 
Disbursement Arrangements for ADB  
The loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB’s Loan Disbursement Handbook 
33. 
(2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time), 21 and  detailed  arrangements  agreed  upon  between  the 
government and ADB. Online training for project staff on disbursement policies and procedures is 
available.22 Project staff are encouraged to avail of this training to help ensure efficient disbursement 
and fiduciary control.  
34. 
The  implementing  agencies,  through  the  CPMO,  will  be  responsible  for  all  disbursement 
arrangements including (i) preparing disbursement projections; (ii) requesting budgetary allocations 
for  counterpart  funds,  (iii)  collecting  supporting  documents,  and  (iv)  preparing  and  sending 
withdrawal applications through the Chongqing Finance Bureau (CFB) to ADB. 
Advance fund procedure. To facilitate project implementation and funds flow, an advance 
35. 
account  will  be  established  upon  loan  effectiveness  by  CFB.  The  currency  of  the  account  will  be 
US$.23 The advance account is to be used exclusively for ADB’s share of eligible expenditures. CFB 
will be responsible for the management, monitoring, and reconciliation of the advance account.  
36. 
The total outstanding advance to the advance account will not exceed the estimate of ADB’s 
share of expenditures to be paid through the advance account for the forthcoming 6 months. The 
CFB may request for initial and additional advances to the advance account based on an estimate 
of expenditure sheet24 setting out the estimated expenditures to be financed through the account for 
the forthcoming 6 months. Supporting documents will be submitted to ADB or retained by the IAs in 
accordance with ADB’s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time) when 
liquidating or replenishing the advance account. 
Statement of expenditure procedure.25 The statement of expenditure (SOE) may be used 
37. 
for reimbursement and liquidation of the advance account. Supporting documents and records for 
the expenditures claimed under the SOE should be maintained and made readily available for review 
by  ADB’s  disbursement  and  review  missions,  upon  ADB’s  request  for  submission  of  supporting 
documents on a sampling basis, and for independent audit. 
21 Available at: http://www.adb.org/documents/loan-disbursement-handbook. 
22  Disbursement eLearning. http://wpqr4.adb.org/disbursement_elearning  
23 The bank charges on the advance account will be financed from the proceeds of the loan. 
24  Estimate of Expenditure sheet is available in Appendix 8A of ADB’s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended 
from time to time). 
25  SOE forms are available in Appendix 7B and 7D of ADB’s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time 
to time). 
31 
Before the submission of the first withdrawal application, CMG, through CFB, should submit 
38. 
to ADB sufficient evidence of the authority of the person(s) who will sign the withdrawal applications 
on behalf of the borrower, together with the authenticated specimen signatures of each authorized 
person.  The  minimum  value  per  withdrawal  application  is  stipulated  in  the  Loan  Disbursement 
Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time). Individual payments below such amount should 
be paid (i) by the executing agency and/or implementing agency and subsequently claimed to ADB 
through reimbursement, or (ii) through the advance fund procedure, unless otherwise accepted by 
ADB.  The  borrower  should  ensure  sufficient  category  and  contract  balances  before  requesting 
disbursements.  Use  of  ADB’s  Client  Portal  for  Disbursements  (CPD)  system  is  encouraged  for 
submission of withdrawal applications to ADB.26 
The direct payment procedure can apply for large works contracts. If the government initially 
39. 
funds eligible expenditures from its own resources, the reimbursement procedure will be used.  
2. 
Disbursement Arrangements for Counterpart Fund  
The executing agency and the implementing agencies will timely provide counterpart funds 
40. 
for  civil  works;  goods;  design,  procurement  and  supervision;  land  acquisition  and  resettlement; 
environmental protection; and contingencies as specified in the loan and project agreements. The 
executing  and  implementing  agencies  will  disburse  counterpart  funds  to  contractors,  suppliers, 
service providers, and people affected by land acquisition and resettlement. 
C. 
 Accounting 
The  executing  agency  and  the  implementing  agencies,  through  the  CPMO,  will  maintain 
41. 
separate books and records by funding source for all expenditures incurred on the project following 
accrual-based  accounting  following  the  Accounting  Methods  for  Projects  Financed  by  the  World 
Bank  (reference  No.  2000  [13]). 27  The  executing  agency  will  prepare  annual  project  financial 
statements  in  accordance  with  the  government's  accounting  laws  and  regulations  which  are 
consistent with international accounting principles and practices. 
D. 
Auditing and Public Disclosure 
42. 
The  executing  agency  and  the  implementing  agencies  will  cause  the  project  financial 
statements  to  be  audited  in  accordance  with  International  Standards  on  Auditing  by  an  auditor 
acceptable to ADB. The audited project financial statements together with the auditor’s opinion will 
be presented in the English language to ADB within 6 months from the end of the fiscal year by the 
CPMO.  
43. 
The annual audit report for the project financial statements will include a  management letter 
and auditor’s opinions, which cover (i) whether the project financial statements present a true and 
fair view or are presented fairly, in all material respects, in accordance with the applicable financial 
reporting standards; (ii) whether loan proceeds were used only for the purposes of the project; and 
(iii)  whether  the  borrower  of  executing  agency  was  in  compliance  with  the  financial  covenants 
contained in the legal agreements (where applicable). 
26 The CPD facilitates online submission of withdrawal applications to ADB, resulting in faster disbursement. The forms to 
be completed by the Borrower are available online at https://www.adb.org/documents/client-portal-disbursements-guide. 
27 Accounting regulations issued by the Ministry of Finance for all foreign-funded projects. 
32 
The financial management assessment suggested that the PIU does not have internal audit 
44. 
system in place therefore it is important to strengthen the internal audit mechanisms and improve 
the  skills  and  capacities  of  the  involved  personnel  for  implementing  the  internal  control  through 
training  provided  by  implementation  consultants.  Implementation  consultants  will  take  the  internal 
check  on  the  finance  management  risk  and  provide  training  on  ADB  financial  management 
requirements. The financial specialist of the consultant team should be qualified and experienced in 
financial management. In addition, it is also to intensify some forms of government/external audit to 
recognize this control weakness. 
45. 
Compliance with financial reporting and auditing requirements will be monitored by review 
missions  and  during  normal  program  supervision,  and  followed  up  regularly  with  all  concerned, 
including the external auditor. 
46. 
The government, executing agency and implementing agencies have been made aware of 
ADB’s approach to delayed submission, and the requirements for satisfactory and acceptable quality 
of the audited project financial statements.28 ADB reserves the right to require a change in the auditor 
(in a manner consistent with the constitution of the borrower), or for additional support to be provided 
to the  auditor,  if  the  audits  required  are  not  conducted  in  a  manner  satisfactory  to  ADB,  or  if  the 
audits are substantially delayed. ADB reserves the right to verify the project's financial accounts to 
confirm that the share of ADB’s financing is used in accordance with ADB’s policies and procedures. 
47. 
Public disclosure of the audited project financial statements, including the audit report on the 
project financial statements, will be guided by ADB’s Public Communications Policy (2011).29 After 
review, ADB will disclose the audited project financial statements and the opinion of the auditors on 
the project financial statements by posting them on ADB’s website no later than 14 days of ADB’s 
confirmation of their acceptability. The management letter and additional auditor’s opinions will not 
be disclosed.30 
28  ADB’s approach and procedures regarding delayed submission of audited project financial statements:  
(i)  When audited project financial statements are not received by the due date, ADB will write to the executing agency 
advising  that  (a)  the  audit  documents  are  overdue;  and  (b)  if  they  are  not  received  within  the  next  6  months, 
requests for new contract awards and disbursement such as new replenishment of advance accounts, processing 
of new reimbursement, and issuance of new commitment letters will not be processed. 
(ii)  When audited project financial statements are not received within 6 months after the due date, ADB will withhold 
processing  of  requests  for  new  contract  awards  and  disbursement  such  as  new  replenishment  of  advance 
accounts, processing of new reimbursement, and issuance of new commitment letters. ADB will (a) inform the 
executing agency of ADB’s actions; and (b) advise that the loan may be suspended if the audit documents are 
not received within the next 6 months. 
(iii)  When audited project financial statements are not received within 12 months after the due date, ADB may suspend 
the loan.

VI. 
PROCUREMENT AND CONSULTING SERVICES 
48. 
A project procurement risk assessment was conducted for the project, in accordance with the 
Guide on Assessing Procurement Risks and Determining Project Procurement Classification (ADB 
2014). Overall project procurement risk is moderate. 
49. 
The main weaknesses identified include: (i) lack of experience of the implementing agencies 
in internationally-financed projects; (ii) some discrepancies between domestic and ADB  practices; 
and (iii) lack of procedures in place for procurement management and project implementation. 
50. 
Proposed mitigation measures include training to be provided to relevant staff of the IAs and 
PIUs, and other stakeholder agencies. The procurement training was delivered by the ADB officials 
and  TRTA  consultants  during  the  project  preparation  to  the  IAs  and  PIUs  on  topics  in  ADB 
procedures  for  procurement  of  goods,  works  and  consulting  services  to  ensure  that  the  non-
familiarity with ADB procurement framework has been addressed. The procurement training will be 
delivered  on  a  well-defined  interval  by  the  loan  implementation  consultants  during  the  project 
implementation  to  ensure  that  procurement  activities  are  undertaken  in  full  conformity  with  ADB 
procurement guidelines and regulations. 
51. 
A procurement market assessment was undertaken to understand and assess the availability 
of potential qualified bidders to supply works, goods and services for each sector.  It was concluded 
that no works and goods contracts would require international advertising to attract enough qualified 
bidders  due  to  the  following  reasons:  (i)  the  project  components  are  all  normal  infrastructures 
requiring only mature technology which are widely available nationally; (ii) there are good number of 
national bidders who have adequate capacities and resources to meet the requirements; and (ii) the 
practices  evidenced  that  all  bidders  were  national  though  the  contracts  were  advertised 
internationally.31 
All  works  and  goods  contracts  can  therefore  be  advertised  nationally  following  open 
52. 
competitive bidding (OCB) procedures.  
A. 
Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing 
53. 
Advance Contracting. All advance contracting and retroactive financing will be undertaken 
in conformity with ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and Procurement 
Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time).32 The issuance of invitations 
for  bid  under  advance  contracting  and  retroactive financing  will  be  subject  to  ADB  approval.  The 
borrower,  CMG,  and  the  implementing  agencies  have  been  advised  that  approval  of  advance 
contracting and retroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance the project. 
Retroactive  financing.  Under  retroactive  financing,  the  IAs  would  implement  project 
54. 
activities using  their  own funds. The government  was informed that  as  a general  rule,  retroactive 
financing is permitted only if (i) activities are required to be part of the detailed project description 
and have been fully appraised by ADB; (ii) goods and works, for which it is requested are on the 
basis of the approved procurement plan and are procured in accordance with ADB’s Procurement 
Guidelines (2017, as amended from time to time) (iii) amount to be retroactively financed does not 
exceed 20% of the loan amount; (iv) due diligence on the proposed contracts for advance contracting

34 
and  retroactive  financing  on  engineering,  environmental,  financial,  social,  and  other  safeguard 
requirements has been completed to satisfy project preparation requirements; and (v) expenditures 
must  have  been  incurred  before  the  loan  effectiveness  but,  generally,  no  earlier  than  12  months 
before signing of the loan agreement. In either instance, detailed assessments (due diligence) on 
each retroactive financing proposal must demonstrate that (i) the expenditures incurred are genuine, 
reasonable, and material to getting the project off the ground; and (ii) they were incurred for proper 
reasons, in a transparent manner over a reasonable period. The government has been advised that 
approval  of  advance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  does  not  commit  ADB  to  finance  the 
project.  
B. 
Procurement of Goods, Works, and Consulting Services 
All  procurement  of  goods  and  works  (including  consulting  services)  will  follow  ADB 
55. 
Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and Procurement Regulations for ADB 
Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time). 
Open competitive bidding (OCB) using national advertising will be used for all civil works and 
56. 
goods  contracts.  For  the  first  civil  works  package  and  the  first  goods  package,  regardless  of  the 
estimated contract amount, the invitations for bids, bidding documents, bid evaluation reports, and 
draft  negotiated  contracts  need  ADB’s  prior  review  and  approval.  For  the  subsequent  nationally 
advertised OCB packages, invitations for bids, bidding documents, bid evaluation reports, and signed 
contracts provided they are consistent with previously approved documents will not require ADB’s 
prior review. However, such documents will be subject to post-review and must be submitted to ADB 
as  soon  as  they  are  completed  and  issued,  but  no  later  than  1  month  after  their  issuance.  The 
relevant  sections  of  ADB’s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  will  be 
included in all procurement documents and contracts.33 
57. 
Before  the  start  of  any  procurement,  ADB  and  the  government  will  review  the  public 
procurement  laws  of  the  central  and  local  governments  to  ensure  consistency  with  ADB’s 
Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and Procurement Regulations for ADB 
Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time).  
All consultants will be recruited according to  ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended 
58. 
from time to time) and Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time 
to time).34 An estimated 317 person-months (38 international, 279 national) of consulting services 
are required to (i) facilitate project management and implementation, (ii) strengthen the institutional 
and operational capacity of the CMG and participating district and county governments on flood risk 
management  and  environmental  management;  and  (v)  implement  external  monitoring  for 
environment  and  resettlement  issues.  Consulting  firms  for  project  management  and  capacity 
development for flood and environmental risk management will be engaged using the quality- and 
cost-based  selection  (QCBS)  method  with  a  standard  quality:cost  ratio  of  90:10  and  using  full 
technical proposal procedure. Qualified national institutes/firms will be engaged through consultants’ 
qualifications  selection  method  (CQS)  to  provide  external  environmental  monitoring  services  and 
external resettlement monitoring services. Four project management start-up support packages will 
engage four individual consultants through individual consultant’s selection (ICS) method.

Open Competitive Bidding (Advertised Nationally) 
64. 
The Borrowers Law of Tendering and Bidding of the People’s Republic of China promulgated 
by Order No. 21 of the President of the People’s Republic of China on August 30, 1999, are subject 
to the following clarifications required for compliance with the Guidelines: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
(v) 
(vi) 
(vii) 
All invitations to prequalify or to bid shall be advertised in the national press, or official 
gazette,  or  a  free  and  open  access  website  in  the  Borrowers  country.  Such 
advertisement  shall  be  made  in  sufficient  time  for  prospective  bidders  to  obtain 
prequalification or bidding documents and prepare and submit their responses. In any 
event,  a  minimum  preparation  period  of  thirty  (30)  days  shall  be  given.  The 
preparation  period  shall  count  (a)  from  the  date  of  advertisement,  or  (b)  when  the 
documents are available for issue, whichever date is later. The advertisement and the 
prequalification and bidding documents shall specify the deadline for such submission. 
Qualification requirements of bidders and the method of evaluating the qualification 
of  each  bidder  shall  be  specified  in  detail  in  the  bidding  documents,  and  in  the 
prequalification documents if the bidding is preceded by a prequalification process. 
If  bidding  is  preceded  by  a  prequalification  process,  all  bidders  that  meet  the 
qualification criteria set out in the prequalification document shall be allowed to bid 
and there shall be no limit on the number of prequalified bidders. 
All bidders shall be required to provide a performance security in an amount sufficient 
to protect the Borrower/Project Executing Agency in case of breach of contract by the 
contractor, and the bidding documents shall specify the required form and amount of 
such performance security. 
Bidders shall be allowed to submit bids by mail or by hand. 
All bids shall be opened in public; all bidders shall be afforded an opportunity to be 
present (either in person or through their representatives) at the time of bid opening, 
but bidders shall not be required to be present at the bid opening. 
All bid evaluation criteria shall be disclosed in the bidding documents and quantified 
in monetary terms or expressed in the form of pass/fail requirements. 
(ix) 
(viii)  No bid may be rejected solely on the basis that the bid price falls outside any standard 
contract  estimate,  or  margin  or  bracket  of  average  bids  established  by  the 
Borrower/Project Executing Agency. 
Each contract shall be awarded to the lowest evaluated responsive bidder, that is, the 
bidder who meets the appropriate standards of capability and resources and whose 
bid has been determined (a) to be substantially responsive to the bidding documents 
and (b) to offer the lowest evaluated cost. The winning bidder shall not be required, 
as a condition  of  award,  to undertake  responsibilities  for  work  not  stipulated  in the 
bidding documents or otherwise to modify the bid as originally submitted. 
Each contract financed with the proceeds of the Loan shall provide that the suppliers 
and contractors shall permit ADB, at its request, to inspect their accounts and records 
relating  to  the performance  of the contract  and to have  said accounts  and  records 
audited by auditors appointed by ADB. 
Government owned enterprises in the Borrower’s country may be permitted to bid if 
they can establish that they (a) are legally and financially autonomous, (b) operate 
under commercial law, and (c) are not a dependent agency of the Borrower/Project 
Executing Agency.  
(xi) 
(x) 
(xii)  Rebidding shall not be allowed solely because the number of bids is less than three.

SAFEGUARDS 
Environment due diligence. The project is classified as Category A for environment. The 
66. 
Environmental  Impact  Assessment  (EIA)  Report,  including  an  Environmental  Management  Plan 
(EMP), was prepared and disclosed on the ADB website. The EIA complies with ADB’s policies and 
requirements including ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). The EIA concluded that full and 
effective implementation of the project EMP, together with the training and project assurances, will 
minimize the environmental risks of the project and achieve compliance with the policy and regulatory 
standards applied in this project EIA.  
Environmental management plan A project environmental management plan (EMP) has 
67. 
been prepared (Appendix 1 of the EIA). The EMP is to be implemented in all phases of the project – 
design, pre-construction, construction, and operation. The EMP is to ensure project compliance with 
PRC environmental laws and ADB’s Safeguard Policy Statement (SPS, 2009). The EMP describes: 
the roles and responsibilities of all project agencies to implement this EMP; anticipated impacts and 
mitigation measures; inspection, monitoring, and reporting arrangements; training and institutional 
strengthening;  grievance  redress  mechanism  (GRM);  and  future  public  consultation.  In  the 
engineering  design  stage  CPMO  will  pass  this  EMP  to  the  design  institutes  for  incorporating 
mitigation measures into the detailed engineering designs. The EMP will be updated at the end of 
the  detailed  design,  as needed. To  ensure that bidders  will  respond to the  EMP’s  provisions,  the 
CPMO and the IA-PMOs will prepare and provide the specification clauses for incorporation into the 
bidding  documents:  (i)  a  list  of  environmental  management  requirements  to  be  budgeted  by  the 
bidders  in  their  bids;  (ii)  environmental  clauses  for  contractual  terms  and  conditions;  and  (iii)  the 
project EIA and updated EMP. 
68. 
Capacity building. The project county and two districts have no previous experience with 
ADB-funded projects or safeguard requirements. During the project design phase, two trainings on 
EMP  implementation  were  conducted,  including  roles  and  responsibilities  of  contractors  and 
construction  supervision  company  (CSCs)  for  EMP  implementation,  the  project  impacts  and 
mitigation measures. During implementation, a capacity building program will be implemented on: (i) 
the EMP, including the mitigation measures, monitoring, and reporting; (ii) ecological management 
of Longxi River and its tributaries, and the Shuanggui and Sanhe reservoirs; (iii) surface water quality 
protection and improvement; and (iv) sustainable integrated watershed management. Training will 
be provided by the Chongqing Municipal EPB, three county/districts EPBs, and loan implementation

Grievance  redress  mechanism.  A  grievance  redress  mechanism  (GRMs)  has  been 
69. 
developed in the project districts and county in compliance with ADB’s SPS (2009) requirement to 
address  environmental,  health,  safety,  and  social  concerns  associated  with  project.  The  GRM  is 
designed to achieve the following objectives: (i) provide channels of communication for local villages 
and communities to raise concerns about environmental and social-related grievances which might 
result from the project; (ii) prevent and mitigate adverse environmental and social impacts to villages 
and  communities  caused  by  project  construction  and  operation,  including  those  associated  with 
resettlement; (iii) improve mutual trust and respect and promote productive relationships between 
the  project  agencies  and  local  villages  and  communities;  and  (iv)  build  village  and  community 
acceptance of the project. The GRM is accessible to all members of the villages and communities, 
including women, youth, minorities and poverty-stricken villagers and residents. Multiple points of 
47 
entry are available, including face-to-face meetings, written complaints, telephone conversations, e-
mail, and social media. The details of the GRM, including a time-bound flow chart of procedures, are 
included in the project EMP. 
B. 
Resettlement 
70. 
Impact of land acquisition and resettlement: The project is classified as category A for 
involuntary resettlement. Of an estimated total 4,193 mu land area used under the project, 1,773 is 
existing  state-owned  land,  1,585  mu  collective  land  will  be  obtained  by  land  acquisition  and 
converted  into  state-owned  land,  310  mu  land  will  be  arranged  through  the  mode  of  rural 
infrastructure  land  use  (RILU),  and  525  mu  will  be  used  via  land  use  right  transfer  (LURT). 35 In 
addition, 527 mu land will be temporally used. Houses with a total area of 8,707 m2 will be demolished 
and 32 households with 123 persons will be physically relocated. Altogether, the project will affect a 
total of 5,412 households with 18,000 persons. 
71. 
Resettlement  plans:  Three  resettlement  plans  (RPs)  have  been  prepared  in  accordance 
with ADB’s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) and relevant laws and regulations of the PRC and 
local  governments.  The  RPs  include  adequate  measures  of  compensation,  resettlement  and 
rehabilitation for affected people.  
Principles  and  policies  of  resettlement:  The  preparation  of  the  project  RPs  is  in 
72. 
compliance  with  Land  Administration  Law  of  the  People's  Republic  of  China  (2004);  Urban  Real 
Estate Management Law of the People's Republic of China (2007 Amendment); Rural Land Contract 
Law of the People's Republic of China (2002); Notice of the State Bureau of Land Management on 
Issues  about  "Several  Provisions  on  Determining  Land  Ownership  and  Usufruct";  Measures  for 
Management  of  Township  People's  “One  Matter  and  One  Discussion”  on  Handling  Wages  and 
Obtaining Labor Affairs (GBF [2007] No.4); and also in compliance with Measures for Management 
of Land Expropriation and other relevant laws and regulations in Chongqing City and the relevant 
policies and regulations in project counties (districts) as well as ADB Safeguard Policy Statement 
(June 2009). Based on consultation with local government departments and APs and the practical 
experience of the project, the implementing agency has established a set of resettlement principles 
and  compensation  entitlement  matrix  for  the  project.  Land  acquisition  compensation  and  ground 
attachment compensation shall be paid to the owner or user according to the land acquisition area. 
The land acquisition compensation fee is calculated based on unified rates regardless types of the 
acquired  land.  The  land  acquisition  fee  includes  the  land  compensation  fee,  resettlement 
compensation  fee  and  comprehensive  quota  compensation  (including  young  crops  and  general 
ground structures compensation without special facilities compensation). 
73. 
Public participation and grievance redress: Public participation and consultation is a key 
part  of  the  RPs.  Since  November  2017,  a  series  of  consultation  activities  were  conducted  with 
affected people, communities, units and other project relevant groups. At the same time, the survey 
of  the  physical  quantity  of  land  acquisition  and  demolition  and  the  sampling  survey  of  the  socio-
economic conditions of the affected households were completed. The project has carried out public 
consultation activities related to land acquisition and established grievance redress channels to solve 
the  problems  encountered  by  affected  people  in  land  acquisition  and  house  demolition  and 
resettlement.  The  grievance  redress  channels  include  several  ways,  including:  (1)  township 
resettlement  office;  (2)  resettlement  office  of  project  districts  or  counties  of  subprojects;  and  (3) 
Chongqing  PMO.  The  resettlement  information  booklet  in  the  local  language  (Chinese)  will  be 
distributed to the APs before ADB management review meeting. Before the implementation of the

48 
project resettlement, the RPs will be updated and distributed to affected households, affected villages 
/ communities and towns / street office. In addition, the RPs will be uploaded to ADB's website. 
74. 
Resettlement and livelihood restoration: To minimize impacts of the resettlement and to 
restore the living standards of affected persons, detailed income recovery programs are developed 
in  RPs.  Affected  people  can  choose  the  right  solution  according  to  their  needs.  According  to the 
social  survey  and  AHs'  analysis,  as  well  as  the  resettlement  experience  of  similar  local  projects, 
resettlement  and  income  restoration  programs  have  been  tailor-made  for  this  project.  These 
programs  include  (1)  transfer  or  readjust  land to  continue  agricultural  production;  (2)  endowment 
insurance  for  APs  transformed  from  rural  to  urban  resident  status;  (3)  arranging  for  APs  to  work 
during construction and operation; (4) helping APs to work in other social jobs and enterprises; and 
(5)  assisting  APs  in  self-employment.  Affected  households  can  choose  appropriate  resettlement 
methods to restore their livelihoods. 
75. 
Institutional arrangement:  Chongqing PMO will be responsible for the overall supervision 
of  implementation  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  including  updating  RPs,  implementation, 
financing and reporting. PMOs of Liangping District, Dianjiang County and Changshou District will 
take  main  responsibilities  of 
including  consultation,  payment  of 
compensation, etc. To ensure the smooth implementation of RPs, relevant staff responsible for the 
land acquisition will be trained by the Chongqing PMO with the help of consultants. According to the 
project construction schedule, the resettlement implementation plan has been prepared and included 
in the RPs. RPs will be updated based on the final design and detailed measurement surveys, and 
the updated RPs will be submitted to ADB for approval. Before awarding civil contracts, updated RPs 
shall be approved by ADB first and distributed to affected people using local language (Chinese). 
implementation  of  RPs, 
76.  Monitoring  and  evaluation:  Detailed  internal  and  external  monitoring  and  evaluation 
measures  have  been  included  in  RPs.  Chongqing  PMO  will  submit  internal  monitoring  reports  to 
ADB semi-annually as part of the project progress reports. In addition, Chongqing PMO will employ 
an external resettlement monitoring agency to externally monitor implementation of RPs and submit 
external monitoring report to ADB.  
C. 
Indigenous Peoples 
77. 
The project does not involve impacts to ethnic minority villages or communities that would 
trigger  ADB’s  SPS  requirements  on  IPs.  Scattered  population  of  ethnic minority  individuals  in the 
project area are not expected to have adverse impacts from the project. 
VIII.  GENDER AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS 
49 
A. 
Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy  
78. 
The project is classified as general intervention for poverty reduction. A total of 0.895 million 
residents in 19 project towns, including 4,450 urban poor and 16,268 rural poor people, will directly 
benefit from the project through strengthened flood risk management and better environment and 
ecological  protection  in  the  Longxi  River  watershed.  Other  residents  of  1.909  million  in  the  three 
project-county/districts will also benefit indirectly from the improved flood management and improved 
environment. The  project  will  create 2,337 jobs during  project  implementation  and 99  jobs  during 
operation. A poverty and social analysis has been undertaken; and a social development action plan 
(SDAP) has been prepared. Key social design measures include: (i) avoiding or minimizing adverse 
social impacts; (ii) enhancing social benefits, including targeted employment for women and the poor; 
and (iii) strengthening public participation and consultation during preparation and implementation of 
the  project  Several  consultation  and  participation  meetings  with  local  residents  and  stakeholders 
have been undertaken during the project preparation, and additional consultation and participation 
measures  have  been  included  in  SDAP  and  other  relevant  plans.  The  social  development  action 
plan matrix is presented in Table 11. 
B. 
Gender  
79. 
The project is classified as effective gender mainstreaming, following ADB’s Guidelines for 
Gender  Mainstreaming  Categories  of  ADB  Projects  (2012).  The  project  will  benefit  women,  who 
constitute 48.7% of the direct beneficiary population. The project will empower women and improve 
their income, living environment and quality of life. A gender action plan (GAP) has been prepared 
based  on  gender  analyses  and  local  consultations  to  ensure  gender  mainstreaming  under  the 
project.  The  key  measures  in  the  GAP  include:  (i)  fair  and  equitable  participation  of  women  in 
decision making during project design and implementation, with at least 40% women participants; 
(ii) training and capacity building of staff of the executing and implementing agencies to implement 
GAP and related measures; (iii) priority employment opportunities to women, with at least 30% during 
construction and 40% during operation; (iv) participation of women in awareness raising in flood and 
environment management and public hearing on tariff with 50% women participants; (v) participation 
of women in decision making for the pilot community-based solid waste management program, with 
at least 40% women members in community groups; and (vi) ensuring women employees’ rights and 
equitable  access  to  sanitation  facilities  and  health  education  (e.g.  HIV/AIDS  awareness)  during 
construction. Key gender indicators have also been included in the design and monitoring framework. 
The GAP is included in Table 12.

Monitoring 
1. 
Project Performance Monitoring 
80. 
The  project  performance  management  system  (PPMS)  indicators,  their  relevance,  and 
monitoring practicalities will be discussed with the executing and implementing agencies and project 
beneficiaries  during  project  implementation.  Disaggregated  baseline  data for  output  and  outcome 
indicators  gathered  during  project  processing  will  be  updated  and  reported  through  the  quarterly 
progress reports of the CPMO and after each ADB review mission. The quarterly progress reports 
will provide information necessary to update ADB's project performance reporting systems.36 
At the 
start  of  project  implementation,  the  CPMO  and  IAs,  with  the  project  implementation  consulting 
services, will develop integrated PPMS procedures to generate data systematically on the inputs and 
outputs of the components, as well as the indicators to be used to measure the project’s impact and 
outcome taking into account the components’ scope. The CPMO will be responsible for monitoring 
36  ADB’s project performance reporting system is available at: 
http://www.adb.org/Documents/Slideshows/PPMS/default.asp?p=evaltool  
58 
and reporting on project performance. The basis for performance monitoring will be the design and 
monitoring  framework  (DMF),  which  identifies  performance  targets  for  the  impact,  outcome,  and 
outputs of the project. By collecting data from the sources identified in the DMF, the CPMO will be 
able to report on an annual basis the performance of the project. Specific reporting requirements will 
be set out in the loan and project agreements between ADB and the Government. The CPMO will 
collect the data, calculate the indicators, analyze the results, and prepare a brief report describing 
the extent to which the project is generating the intended outputs and outcomes. The relevance and 
practicability of data collection for indicators will be confirmed with the CPMO and IAs. Meanwhile, 
the  agreed  socioeconomic  and  environmental  indicators  to  be  used  will  be  further  enhanced  to 
measure project impacts. The CPMO and IAs will (i) refine and integrate the PPMS framework at the 
start  of  project  implementation;  (ii)  confirm  that  targets  are  achievable;  (iii)  develop  recording, 
monitoring, and reporting arrangements; and (iv) establish systems and procedures no later than six 
months after project inception.  
2. 
Compliance Monitoring 
The  executing  and  implementing  agencies  and  the  project  management  consultants,  will 
81. 
conduct compliance monitoring, and submit reports and information to ADB concerning the use of 
the  loan  proceeds,  project  implementation,  the  implementing  agency’s  project  implementation 
performance, and compliance of loan and project covenants. These reports will include (i) quarterly 
progress  reports  on  project  implementation;  and  (ii)  a  project  completion  report,  which  should  be 
submitted within 6 months of physical completion of the project. The compliance status of loan and 
project  covenants  will  be  reported  and  assessed  through  quarterly  progress  report.  ADB  review 
missions will verify the status of compliance.  
3. 
Safeguards Monitoring 
a. 
Environment 
82. 
Three types of project monitoring will be conducted under the EMP: (i) internal monitoring – 
to be conducted by the implementing agencies and the construction supervision companies (CSCs); 
(ii) external monitoring – of air, water, noise and soil standards – to be conducted by the certificated 
EMA in each project county/district; and (iii) compliance monitoring – to be conducted by both the 
EMA  and  LIEC,  to  ensure  the  EMP  is  being  implemented.  The  monitoring  shall  comply  with  the 
methodology provided in the relevant national environmental monitoring standards. Other associated 
standards  to  be followed  are  the  national  environmental quality  standards  of  ambient  air,  surface 
water,  sediment  and  noise,  and  the  pollutant  discharge  standards.  ADB  will  oversee  project 
compliance based on the semi-annual environmental monitoring reports provided by the CPMO.  
83. 
Environmental  acceptance  reporting.  Within  three  months  after  each  subproject 
completion, or no later than a half year with permission of the local EPBs, environmental acceptance 
monitoring  and  audit  reports  of  each  subproject  completion  shall  be  (i)  prepared  by  a  licensed 
environmental monitoring institute37 in accordance  with the  PRC  Guideline  on  Project  Completion 
Environmental  Audit  (2001),  (ii)  reviewed  for  approval  of  the  official  commencement  of  individual 
subproject operation by environmental authorities, and (iii) finally reported to ADB through the semi-
annual EMP monitoring and progress reporting process. 
37  Mostly,  the  institute  is  the  municipal  or  district/county  environmental  monitoring  station  under  the  municipal  or 
district/county EPB. 
59 
b. 
Resettlement 
84. 
A detailed plan for both the internal and external monitoring is included in the resettlement 
plans. CPMO will include a summary of internal monitoring in the quarterly project progress reports 
to ADB. Furthermore, CPMO will employ an external resettlement monitoring agency to monitor and 
evaluate resettlement progress and results. A baseline survey for a sample of affected persons will 
be completed before the LAR begins. Semi-annual external monitoring reports will be prepared and 
submitted for ADB’s review during resettlement implementation.  
c. 
Social Development and Gender Action Plan 
85.  Monitoring of the social development action plan (SDAP) and gender action plan (GAP) will 
be incorporated into the PPMS. Clear targets and indicators have been established and are included 
in the SDAP and GAP and in the DMF. A social and gender specialist will be hired by the executing 
agency to assist the CPMO and IAs in monitoring, and preparation of monitoring reports on SDAP 
and GAP which will be included in the quarterly project progress reports.  
C. 
Evaluation 
86. 
ADB,  executing  agency  and  implementing  agencies  will  undertake  a  semi-annual  review 
mission  to  evaluate  the  progress  of  project  implementation.  ADB,  executing  agency  and 
implementing  agencies will  undertake  comprehensive  midterm  review  two  years  after  the  start  of 
project implementation to have a detailed evaluation of the scope, implementation arrangements, 
resettlement, achievement of scheduled targets, and progress on the agenda for policy reform and 
capacity building measures. Feedback from the PPMS activities will be analyzed. Within 6 months 
of physical completion of the project, the CPMO will submit a project completion report to ADB.38  
D. 
Reporting 
87. 
The CPMO will provide ADB with (i) quarterly progress reports in a format consistent with 
ADB's project performance reporting system; (ii) annual reports including (a) progress achieved by 
output as measured through the indicator's performance targets, (b) key implementation issues and 
solutions,  (c)  updated  procurement  plan,  and  (d)  updated  implementation  plan  for  the  next  12 
months; and (iii) a project completion report within 6 months of physical completion of the project. To 
ensure  that  projects  will  continue  to  be  both  viable  and  sustainable,  project  accounts  and  the 
executing agency audited financial statement together with the associated auditor's report, should 
be adequately reviewed. 
88. 
The executing agency and implementing agencies have the following reporting commitments: 
(i)  submission  of  quarterly  progress  reports  during  project  implementation  including  internal 
monitoring reports on safeguards (environmental and resettlement), and social monitoring progress 
reports,  i.e.  SDAP  and  GAP;  (ii)  submission  of  semi-annual  external  monitoring  reports  on 
safeguards,  i.e.,  resettlement  activities  and  environment  plan  implementation;  (iii)  submission  of 
project completion report within 6 months of physical completion of the project; and (iv) submission 
of audited project accounts and financial statements six months after the end of fiscal year. PPMS 
data will be incorporated in the quarterly progress reports.

community consultation meetings, in accordance with ADB’s requirements of information disclosure 
policy. 
91. 
Environment.  Meaningful  consultation,  participation  and  information  disclosure  was 
conducted  during  project  preparation.  Information  disclosure  and  public  consultation  included 
newspaper  disclosure;  informal  communication  with  key  stakeholders,  including  residents,  local 
authorities  and  sector  specific  institutions  and  authorities;  questionnaire  surveys;  and  wider 
stakeholder meetings attended by affected people and other concerned stakeholders. A GRM has 
been  defined  to  address  community  concerns,  reduce  risks,  and assist  the  project  in  maximizing 
environmental and social benefits  
61 
92. 
Involuntary  resettlement.  All  the  affected  households  and  towns/townships,  leaders  and 
town  and  township  governments  have  been  or  will  be  involved  in  the  project  impact  and  social-
economic  survey  while  preparing/updating  the  RPs.  Through  meetings,  interviews,  focus  group 
local 
discussions,  public  consultation  workshops,  and  community  consultation  meetings, 
representatives have participated in the planning and their concerns have been integrated into the 
RPs. Before implementation, the CPMO and implementing agencies will further discuss and consult 
with  the  affected  persons’  representatives  the  impacts  on  every  town/township  and  the  detailed 
compensation plan to ensure affected persons’ interests are protected and to provide employment 
opportunities  for  the  affected  persons’  livelihoods  restoration.  The  CPMO  and  implementing 
agencies will disclose the RPs in their websites and disseminate information from the RPs to affected 
people. The resettlement plans will also be posted on the ADB website. Resettlement information 
booklets will be distributed to affected households. This contains information such as the affected 
project  area,  proposed  land  acquisition  and  relocation  implementation  progress  and  procedure, 
compensation  standards  for  land  acquisition,  relocation  assistance,  and  livelihood  restoration 
strategy.  The  implementing  agencies  will  establish  a  project  resettlement  unit  for  supervision  of 
implementation, continued public consultation, monitoring of progress, and response to grievances. 
The grievance redress procedures will be established, and explanations have been included in the 
resettlement information booklets. 
Public  disclosure  of  all  project  documents  will  be  undertaken  through  the  implementing 
93. 
agencies and on the ADB website including the project data sheet, DMF, EIA, resettlement plans, 
and the report and recommendation of the President. Disclosure of social and safeguards monitoring 
reports will be undertaken during project implementation. 
94. 
Social Development and Gender Consultations with communities and other stakeholders 
have taken place and will continue at different points in the preparation of the detailed design and 
implementation  of  the  SDAP  and  GAP,  and  will  be  designed  not  only  to  inform  people  about  the 
component  or  specific  activities  related  to  its  preparation  and  implementation,  but  also  to  enable 
people in the community to know about the project and how they could maximize benefits from the 
project,  ask  questions,  make  suggestions,  state  preferences,  and  express  concerns.  Special 
attention will be paid to the participation of women and other vulnerable groups, such as the poor. 
Consultations  will  also  be  conducted  with  other  stakeholders  such  as  the  contractors,  project 
implementers,  and  labour  force  including  women  to  inform  them  about  the  SDAP  and  GAP  and 
provide them the necessary training on social safeguards, gender and core labour standards.

ANTICORRUPTION POLICY 
96. 
ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its  agents,  any  violations  of  the 
Anticorruption Policy relating to the project.39 All contracts financed by ADB shall include provisions 
specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of the executing agency 
and  all  project  contractors,  suppliers,  consultants  and  other  service  providers.  Individuals  and/or 
entities on ADB’s anticorruption debarment list are ineligible to participate in ADB-financed activity 
and may not be awarded any contracts under the project.40  
To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  are  included  in  the  loan  agreement,  and  the 
97. 
bidding documents for the project.

independent forum and process whereby people adversely affected by ADB-assisted projects can 
voice,  and  seek  a  resolution  of  their  problems,  as  well  as  report  alleged  violations  of  ADB’s 
operational policies and procedures. Before submitting a complaint to the Accountability Mechanism, 
affected people should make a good faith effort to solve their problems by working with the concerned 
ADB  operations  department.  Only  after  doing  that,  and  if  they  are  still  dissatisfied,  they  should 
approach the Accountability Mechanism.41

Introduction 
1. 
This document sets out the indicative terms of reference for independent external monitoring 
and  evaluation  (M&E)  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  (LAR)  needed  to  ensure  that  the 
Chongqing Longxi River Basin Integrated Flood and Environmental Risk Management Project will 
be implemented in conformity with the People’s Republic of China (PRC) laws and regulations and 
the  Asian  Development  Bank’s  (ADB’s)  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  including  involuntary 
resettlement. The direct client of the consulting services is the Chongqing project management office 
(CPMO)  which  is  under  the  Chongqing  Development  and  Reform  Commission  (CDRC).  The 
consulting services will be also provided to the three project implementing agencies (IAs) which are 
based in the DRC, including Liangping District Government (LDG), Dianjiang County Government 
(DCG), and Changshou District Government (CDG). 
B. 
Implementation Arrangements 
The  external  resettlement  M&E  will  be  carried  out  by  a  team  of  specialists  through  a 
2. 
competent independent external monitoring agency (EMA). The M&E will be financed by ADB, and 
the team of specialists will be recruited by the CPMO according to ADB’s Procurement Regulations 
(2017, as amended from time to time) through consultants’ qualifications selection. The CPMO and 
IAs  will  provide  assistance  to  the  EMA,  particularly  in  the  aspects  of  field  survey,  staffing,  and 
logistics. The consulting services are expected to start in November 2018 until December 2023. 
D. 
Reporting Requirements 
3. 
The  EMA  will  submit  to  ADB  and  CPMO  semiannual  external  resettlement  M&E  reports 
during the implementation of LAR for the project, and annual external resettlement M&E reports for
