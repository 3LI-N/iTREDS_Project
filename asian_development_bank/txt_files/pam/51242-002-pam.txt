Project Administration Manual Purpose and Process 
1.  The  project  administration  manual  (PAM)  describes  the  essential  administrative  and 
management requirements to implement the project on time, within budget, and in accordance 
with the policies and procedures of the government and Asian Development Bank (ADB). The 
PAM should include references to all available templates and instructions either through linkages 
to relevant URLs or directly incorporated in the PAM. 
2.  The  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  Livestock  and  Irrigation  (MOALI)  and  Department  of  Rural 
Development (DRD) of MOALI are wholly responsible for the implementation of ADB-financed 
project, as agreed jointly between the borrower and ADB, and in accordance with the policies 
and  procedures  of  the  government  and  ADB.  ADB  staff  is  responsible  for  supporting 
implementation including compliance by MOALI and DRD of their obligations and responsibilities 
for project implementation in accordance with ADB’s policies and procedures. 
3.  At loan negotiations, the borrower and ADB shall agree to the PAM and ensure consistency with 
the loan and grant agreements. Such agreement shall be reflected in the minutes of the  loan 
negotiations. In the event of any discrepancy or contradiction between the PAM and the  loan 
and grant agreements, the provisions of the loan and grant agreements shall prevail. 
4.  After ADB Board approval of the project's report and recommendations of the President (RRP), 
changes in implementation arrangements are subject to agreement and approval pursuant to 
relevant government and ADB administrative procedures (including the Project Administration 
Instructions) and upon such approval, they will be subsequently incorporated in the PAM. 
Rationale 
PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
Myanmar is one of the poorest countries in Southeast Asia. Almost the entire country is 
1. 
prone to a range of natural hazards. The poor have low levels of human capital and tend to be 
highly exposed to various climate change and disaster risk related shocks and stresses. The rural 
poor  rely  on  agriculture  and  causal  labor  for  their  livelihood.  Myanmar’s  rural  areas  are 
underdeveloped: (i) only 16% of rural people have access to electricity through the public grid; 
(ii) nearly three out of ten lack access to year-round improved drinking water; (iii) one out of four 
lacks  access  to  improved  sanitation;  and  (iv)  many  rural  areas  also  lack  access  to  roads  for 
connectivity. Community-based development (CBD) approaches are an effective tool for bringing 
communities to the forefront of poverty reduction and development, allowing them to design and 
implement  solutions  that  address  their  needs. CBD  effectively  provides  community-built 
infrastructure, livelihood support, job opportunities and rural employment and skills development. 
Evidence  indicates  improvement  in  incomes  and  well-being  including  increases  in  per  capita 
consumption, greater use of basic services and higher school participation. 
The  Resilient  Community  Development  Project  (RCDP)  supports 
2. 
the  Myanmar 
Sustainable Development Plan (2018-2030) and will contribute to poverty reduction and inclusive 
growth of initially 17 townships in Ayeyarwaddy, Chin, Sagaing, and Thanintharyi which are highly 
vulnerable to climate change and disaster risks. The project will target areas that are vulnerable 
to CDR and will follow a phased, cluster approach, grouping vulnerable townships in the same 
area.  Project  interventions  are  also  aligned  with  the  Agriculture  Development  Strategy  and 
Investment Plan (ADS 2018-2023), the National Framework for Community Disaster Resilience 
and  Asian  Development  Bank’s  (ADB)  country  partnership  strategy  for  Myanmar  (2017-2021), 
which identifies rural development as a strategic pillar. The project will reduce food insecurity and 
poverty  of  rural  people living  in vulnerable areas by  building  their  capacity  and providing  them 
with  resources  to  sustainably  invest  in  climate  and  disaster  resilient,  and  market-oriented 
infrastructure  and  livelihoods.  The  project  will  follow  a  CBD  approach  which  comprises:  (i)  a 
community focus; (ii) participatory planning and design; (iii) community control of resources; (iv) 
community  involvement  in  implementation;  and  (v)  use  of  community-based  participatory 
monitoring and evaluation (M&E) to ensure downward accountability to the community.  
Impact and Outcome 
The project is aligned with the following impact incomes of rural households improved and 
3. 
resilience of communities to climate and disaster risks (CDRs) strengthened. The project will have 
the following outcome standard of living and resilience of targeted communities improved. 
Outputs 
4. 
Output 1: Climate-and disaster-resilient community infrastructure developed. Three 
thousand  CDR  community  infrastructure  subprojects  will  be  identified  through  a  participatory 
village development plan (VDP) and funded through block grants. Climate risk and vulnerability 
assessments and market opportunity analysis will be made available to communities for their local 
assessment in the process of their prioritization of infrastructure investments. Criteria for selection 
include contribution to resilience and public and economic good benefits. Village women will be 
empowered through dedicated meetings, quota in representation in committees and labor, bias 
in  the  selection  of  subprojects  to  significantly  influence  community  infrastructure  investment 
prioritization. Typical community infrastructures will be village access or farm roads, small bridges, 
2 
water supply, electric grid connection, multi-purpose centers, etc. The project will finance three 
cycles of community planning and subproject implementation. The first cycle will cover all target 
villages.  Subsequent  cycles  will  be  performance-based  and  open  to  village  tracts  that  have 
achieved  a  minimum  social  and  infrastructure  quality  assessment  review  score.1  Each 
infrastructure investment cycle will amount to MK10 million per village or a per capita investment 
of MK30,000 per village person, whichever is higher. 
5. 
Output 2: Resilient livelihood activities for poor men and women developed. At least 
15,000  resilient  livelihood  subprojects  will  be  funded  through  block  grants.  Increased  and 
diversified rural household income, based on a sound understanding of changing climate risk and 
market  opportunity,  is  an  important  component  of  increased  resilience.  As  part  of  the  VDP 
process,  communities  will,  using  a  participatory  wealth/vulnerability  ranking  methodology,2 
identify the lowest four deciles of poor and vulnerable households in their villages. That cohort 
will be eligible to apply for livelihood subprojects, valued at up to MK300,000 per group member. 
Targeted  poor  and/or  vulnerable  households  will  be  encouraged  and  enabled  to  form  groups 
having a common livelihood interest and submit a livelihood subproject proposal. The project will 
also provide need-based training to the livelihood groups in group development and management, 
business  skills  including  financial  literacy,  financial  and  business  record  keeping  and 
entrepreneurship, and on CDR management. 
Livelihood subprojects can include new or improved climate-smart agriculture, livestock, 
6. 
fisheries activities, value addition to farm and non-farm products, marketing, and the acquisition 
of  new  skills  for  village  or  off-village  employment  or  entrepreneurship.  The  project  will  assist 
interested groups to source vocational training, particularly for women and youth, by linking this 
project  to  the  ADB  Equipping  Youth  for  Employment  Project.3  To  ensure  sustainability  and 
scaling-up  opportunities,  the  project  will  also  facilitate,  but  not  fund,  group  access  to  credit  by 
establishing linkages to financial institutions. A secondary target of the livelihood activities will be 
to support through trainings poor households that are above the lowest four deciles of the wealth 
ranking to adapt to CDR. Once operating sustainably, the project will assist livelihood groups to 
evaluate the benefit of higher levels of association, up to township or township cluster level, with 
a view to increasing their market power or adding value to their production at scale.  
Output 3: Institutional and organizational capacity of communities and government 
7. 
strengthened. The project will support the Department of Rural Development (DRD) to develop 
its VDP process and build its capacity to assist villagers to factor in  considerations to address 
present  day  and future  shocks  and  stresses  and  participatorily  identified  market  opportunities. 
VDPs  will  be  aggregated  to  establish  village  tract  development  plans  and,  following  the 
development  of  an  appropriate  framework,  to  contribute  to  township  development  planning 
processes. A DRD training unit will be established, along with associated training curricula, in the 
areas  of  community-based  planning,  resilience  building,  gender,  leadership,  and  livelihood 
development,  among  others.  This  unit  will  train  communities  and  government  departments, 
paying  particular  attention  to  the  development  of  information  and  communication  technology 
training programs. Knowledge centers to promote CDR in agriculture, livestock, fishery, and rural 
development  will  also  be  supported.  Support  service  providers  will  facilitate  implementation  at 
communities’ level. The upgrade of DRD training center will be also supported under this output.  
1   Performance criteria are defined in the Project Operations Manual. 
2   Communities rank member households into four wealth/vulnerability categories (A to D) based on their assessment 
of the household’s assets (land, house, productive assets, business assets) and CDR vulnerability.

The project includes a disaster contingency feature. In the event of a disaster affecting an 
entire township, and upon the request of Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Irrigation (MOALI), 
and approval by ADB, funds from the subsequent cycle of community planning and subproject 
implementation may be advanced for reconstruction of damaged infrastructure and recovery of 
livelihoods. The  selection  of  infrastructure  and  livelihoods  subprojects  will  follow  similar 
participatory processes and criteria for outputs 1 and 2. 
Village Development Support Committees (VDSCs), supported by community facilitators, 
9. 
technical facilitators  and  livelihood  facilitators  shall  undertake a rapid assessment  of  damages 
and  based  on  the  assessment,  prioritize  subprojects  for  infrastructure  reconstruction  and 
livelihood  recovery.  This  list  of  priority  subprojects  will  be  submitted  to  the  Township  Planning 
Implementation  Committee  (TPIC)  for  technical  review.  The  TPIC  shall  determine  subprojects 
that  may  be  financed  based  on  available  allocation,  extent  of  damage  and  benefit  to  the 
communities.  Based on this decision, the technical facilitators, community facilitators, and VDSCs 
shall proceed with detailed design.  
10. 
The detailed design shall include program of work, bill of materials, drawings and standard 
specifications, safeguard measures and procurement plans. Existing designs from the community 
infrastructure manual shall serve as guide for ensuring that reconstruction and recovery are built 
according to climate and disaster risk standards. 
11. 
The design shall be reviewed by senior technical engineers and revisions made on-site.  
These revised designs shall then be submitted to the village tract development support committee 
(VTDSCs)  and  TPIC  simultaneously.  The  VTDSC  shall  then  proceed  with  the  organization  of 
groups work, finance and procurement teams.  The TPIC shall review the final design and upon 
its  approval,  submit  a  request  to  the  DRD  union  office,  to  transfer  funds  to  the  VTDSCs. 
Implementation and construction of subprojects shall follow the normal project procedure. 
Lessons learned from CBD projects in Myanmar and in the Region. DRD has been 
12. 
implementing the ADB-financed Enhancing Rural Livelihoods and Incomes Project (ERLIP) since 
2014  in  Myanmar.  DRD  has  also  implemented  the  World  Bank-financed  National  Community 
Driven Development Project (NCDDP) since 2012. Both projects follow a CBD approach. ERLIP 
supports  both  community  infrastructure  and  livelihood  activities  while  NCDDP  funds  only 
community  infrastructure.  Based  on  implementation  experience  under  both  projects,  DRD 
considers key to be able to support community infrastructure and livelihoods activities under the 
same project. The table below presents the main lessons learned from CBD projects financed by 
ADB and other development partners in the region and how these lessons were integrated in the 
design of the project.

Amount  of  village  block  grants  is  low  and 
does allow for meaningful investment. Some 
villages end up doing small investments just 
to use the grant. However, key priorities are 
not met because the investment is too low. 
CBD  projects  are  known  for  the  use  of  a 
“learning  by  doing”  approach 
in  building

Subproject eligibility and criteria setting. The selection of subprojects will be guided by 
a set of criteria to ensure that subprojects contribute to the objective of increased resilience and 
that they benefit poor, disadvantaged and vulnerable people. The criteria and the weight for each 
criterion to be recommended to the VDSC are as follows: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
(v) 
number of households benefitted by the proposed project (20% maximum); 
proportion of the poor benefitted (20% maximum); 
proposal  with  the  highest  benefit  to  women  and  endorsed  by  women’s  (20% 
maximum); 
linkage of the proposal to building resilience (included in the long list of adaptive 
measures or activities) (20% maximum); and 
such other criterion that the village and village tract will decide on (20% maximum). 
In the absence of this last one or when the village or VTDSC does now have a 
proposed  additional  criterion, the  20%  will  be  distributed to  criteria a–d  in  equal 
proportion – 5% each).

Project Organization Structure  
20. 
The Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Irrigation (MOALI) is the executing agency. A 
project  steering  committee  (PSC)  chaired  by  the  Deputy  Minister  of  MOALI  will  provide  the 
oversight.  Members  will  include  (i)  the  Ministry  of  Planning  and  Finance;  (ii)  Department  of 
Planning, MOALI; (iii) Department of Agriculture, MOALI; (iv) Livestock Breeding and Veterinary 
Department, MOALI; (v) Environmental Conservation Department within the Ministry of Natural 
Resources  Environmental  Conservation;  (vi)  Department  of  Disaster  Management,  Ministry  of 
Social Welfare Relief and Resettlement; and (vii) other relevant ministries.  
21. 
The  DRD  within  MOALI  will  be  the  implementing  agency  and  will  be  responsible  for 
implementation  and  resolving  management/implementation  issues  as  they  arise.  A  project 
management unit (PMU) will be established within the DRD Union Level to oversee the day-to-
day operations. It will also support the PSC for inter-ministerial coordination related to the project 
and serve as secretariat to the PSC. The PMU will comprise a project director, project manager, 
project  coordinator,  block  grant  officer,  engineers,  livelihood  officers,  climate  and  disaster  risk 
officer, gender officer, safeguards officer, training officer, communications officer, financial officer, 
procurement officer, and M&E officer. DRD will also set up project implementation units (PIU) at 
the townships clusters to oversee project management at the township level. Under the PIU, a 
Livelihood Technical Team will be formed with technical support from the support service provider 
(SSP) and from township technical departments to provide comprehensive and sound technical 
guidance on livelihood matters. A village tract development support committee (VTDSC) will be 
17 
responsible for community planning process and the subproject cycle at the village tract level. It 
will be composed of heads of all VDSC, which shall have equal male and female representation. 
The heads of the VTDSC will be elected from among its members. 
The PMU and PIUs will be supported by the main implementation consultants (MIC) and 
22. 
by the SSPs to be contracted by DRD. 
Figure 1: Project Organization Structure 
COSTS AND FINANCING 
23. 
The project is estimated to cost $243.00 million. The government has requested a loan in 
the amount of $185.00 from ADB’s concessional ordinary capital resources and a grant of $10.00 
million from ADB’s Special Fund resources (Asian Development Fund-Disaster Risk Reduction). 
The ADB loan and grant will finance the community investment funds for the townships (except 
Hakha township which will be financed by the JFPR grant); a portion of implementation support, 
and facilitation and capacity building costs.  
24. 
The ADB loan will have a 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, an interest 
rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other 
terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. 
18 
The Government of Myanmar will finance the equivalent of $17.42 million for salaries of 
25. 
counterpart staff and office space. Taxes and duties are estimated to be $1.95 million and will be 
financed by ADB. 
In  addition,  cofinancing  was  secured  from  the  Asia  Investment  Facility  (€24.25  million, 
26. 
equivalent to $27.58 million)7 and from the JFPR for $3.0 million. The Asia Investment Facility 
grant  will  finance  consultant  fees,  a  portion  of  implementation  support  costs  (travel  for 
consultants) and a portion of facilitation and capacity building costs. The JFPR grant will finance 
community  investment  funds,  and  facilitation  and  capacity  building  for  Hakha  township.  Both 
grants will be administered by ADB.   
A. 
Cost Estimates Preparation and Revisions  
27. 
The  cost  estimates  were  prepared  by  ADB  consultants  using  data  from  primary  and 
secondary sources. Figures are based on unit cost and rates prevailing in Myanmar in June 2019. 
During implementation, project staff and consultants will revise the costs in accordance with the 
final detailed designs and will also be responsible for detailed costing of additional subprojects to 
be implemented. Tables may be revised during midterm review or special administration review 
missions. The following are considered ineligible for JFPR financing: (i) purchase of vehicle for 
project administration; (ii) academic research; (iii) salaries of civil servants; and (iv) and foreign 
travel.8 
B. 
Key Assumptions 
28. 
The following key assumptions underpin the cost estimates and financing plan:

FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT 
Financial Management Assessment 
30. 
The  financial  management  assessment  (FMA)  was  conducted  from  July  to  November 
2018 in accordance with ADB’s Guidelines for the Financial Management and Analysis of Projects 
and the Financial Due Diligence: A Methodology Note. The FMA considered the capacity of the 
MOALI,  DRD  at  the  union  and  township  levels,  including  funds  flow  arrangements,  staffing, 
accounting  and  financial  reporting  systems,  financial  information  systems,  and  internal  and 
external auditing arrangements. Based on the assessment, the key financial management risks 
identified  are  (i)  vulnerability  of  macroeconomic  stability  and  the  fiscal  position  from  external 
shocks;  (ii)  weak  public  financial  management;  (iii)  lack  of  transparency  and  accountability; 
28 
(iv) weak internal audit capacity and processes; (v) inadequate institutional capacity to implement 
and  monitor  the  project;  (vi)  accounting  standards  are  not  in  accordance  with  international 
standards; (vii) external audit will not be to the standard required under the ADB Loan and Grant 
Agreements;  and  (viii)  potential  corruption  in  procurement. It  is concluded that  the  overall  pre-
mitigation  financial  management  risk  of  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies  are 
substantial.  MOALI  and  DRD  have  proven  their  capability  as  executing  and  implementing 
agencies, respectively, to implement with consultant support large scale CBD projects, such as 
the  ERLIP  and the World  Bank funded  NCDDP.  DRD  has  been managing  a  portfolio  of  about 
$900 million (Official Development Assistance funds). MOALI and DRD have agreed to carry out 
the action plan (Table 17) to address the deficiencies identified and already committed to mobilize 
additional staff for RCDP. Under NCDDP, MOALI and DRD have proven their ability to implement 
large scale projects using the advance account and statement of expenditure (SOE) procedure.

Disbursement 
1. 
Disbursement  Arrangements  for  ADB  (and  ADB-administered  cofinancier) 
Funds 
31. 
The  loan  and  grant  proceeds  including  ADB-administered  cofinancier  funds  will  be 
disbursed in accordance with ADB’s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time 
to  time),  and  detailed  arrangements  agreed  upon  between  the  government  and  ADB.9  Online 
training for project staff on disbursement policies and procedures is available.10 Project staff will 
be required to avail of this training, upon their assumption as counterpart staff of the project, to 
help ensure efficient disbursement and fiduciary control. DRD staff familiar with ADB projects will 
be assigned to this project.  
32. 
DRD  will  be  responsible  for  ensuring  appropriate  financial  management  of  the  sub-
accounts, including: (i) preparing disbursement projections; (ii) requesting budgetary allocations 
for  counterpart  funds;  (iii)  collecting  and  retaining  supporting  documents  and  making  these 
available  for  audit  purposes;  and  (iv)  preparing  and  sending  withdrawal  applications  and 
appropriate  documents  (i.e.,  bank  statements  and  bank  reconciliation)  to  ADB.  Detailed

30 
discussions on the disbursement of loan and grant funds are found in the Project Finance Manual 
and Community Finance Manual. 
33. 
At township level, there will be two DRD finance staff in the PIU. At township cluster level, 
the project finance expert will support the DRD PIU finance staff in reporting, managing the block 
grant payment requests, and tracking disbursements. The project finance expert will also manage 
a team of community finance officers (CFO) who will provide oversight and capacity building to 
project financial management activities at the village tract levels.  
34. 
The Finance Sub-committee (FSC) of the VTDSC will be responsible for managing the 
VTDSC bank account and for financial management of community block funds, as prescribed in 
the  Project  Finance  Manual.  The  VTDSC  FSC  will  consist  of  a  head,  a  bookkeeper,  and  a 
member. The FSC of the VDSC will be responsible for financial management of community block 
funds, as prescribed in the Project Finance Manual. The VDSC FSC will consist of a finance clerk 
and a bookkeeper.  
35. 
Accountability  and  transparency  will  be  ensured  at  village  level  through  villager 
participation  in  decision  making  and  accountability  meetings  and  through  project  information 
boards in every village, which will display an appropriate amount of up to date financial information 
about the project costs. A project grievance system will be in place and advertised on the project 
information boards, enabling villagers to register and receive follow ups to complaints. 
36. 
Advance  fund  procedure.  DRD  will  establish  and  maintain  four  separate  advance 
accounts in US dollar (one each for the ADB loan and grant, Asia Investment Facility [AIF] grant 
and JFPR grant). The respective advance accounts are to be used exclusively for the respective 
ADB  and  ADB’s  administered  cofinancier  funds'  share  of  eligible  expenditures.  DRD  who 
administers the advance account is accountable and responsible for the proper use of advances 
to the advance account, including advances to the sub-accounts. 
Seventeen sub-accounts will be opened at the township level. The sub-accounts will be 
37. 
used  exclusively  for  ADB  loan’s  share  of  eligible  expenditures.  It  is  expected  that  majority  of 
expenditures  will  be  incurred  either  through  direct  payments  from  ADB  or  through  these  sub-
accounts or advance accounts. Four designated accounts in MK (one each for the ADB loan and 
grant, AIF, and JFPR) will be opened at the DRD union level to facilitate payment in local currency. 
38. 
The total outstanding advance to the respective advance account should not exceed the 
estimate of the respective ADB and ADB’s administered cofinanciers’ share of expenditures to be 
paid through the respective advance accounts for the forthcoming 6 months. DRD may request 
for initial and additional advances to the respective advance accounts based on an Estimate of 
Expenditure Sheet11 setting out the estimated expenditures to be financed through the accounts 
for the forthcoming six months. Supporting documents should be submitted to ADB or retained 
by DRD in accordance with ADB’s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time 
to time) when liquidating or replenishing the respective advance account. 
There will be periods each year where more frequent liquidations and replenishments will 
39. 
be required, particularly in those months when community block grants are disbursed. DRD’s 6-
month  cash  projections  will  demonstrate  this  when  submitting  withdrawal  applications  for  the 
replenishment of the designated loan and grant advance accounts. 
11  Estimate  of  Expenditure  sheet  is  available  in  Appendix  8A  of  ADB’s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2017,  as 
amended from time to time).  
31 
Statement  of  expenditure  procedure.12  The  SOE  procedure  will  be  used  for 
40. 
reimbursement  of  eligible  expenditures  or  liquidation  of  advances  to  the  advance  accounts. 
Supporting  documents  and  records  for  the  expenditures  claimed  under  the  SOE  should  be 
maintained and made readily available for review by ADB's disbursement and review missions, 
upon  ADB's  request  for  submission  of  supporting  documents  on  a  sampling  basis,  and  for 
independent audit. Reimbursement and liquidation of individual payments in excess of the SOE 
ceiling should be supported by full documentation when submitting the withdrawal application to 
ADB. 
41. 
Before  the  submission  of  the  first  withdrawal  application,  DRD  should  submit  to  ADB 
sufficient  evidence  of the authority  of the  persons  who  will  sign  the  withdrawal  applications  on 
behalf of the government, together with the authenticated specimen signatures of each authorized 
person. The minimum  value  per  withdrawal  application  is  stipulated  in the  Loan  Disbursement 
Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time). Individual payments below such amount should 
be paid (i) by DRD and subsequently claimed to ADB through reimbursement, or (ii) through the 
advance  fund  procedure,  unless  otherwise  accepted  by  ADB.  DRD  should  ensure  sufficient 
category and contract balances before requesting disbursements. 
Accounting 
42. 
DRD  will  maintain,  or  cause  to  be  maintained,  separate  books  and  records  by  funding 
source for  all  expenditures  incurred  on the  project. While  it  is  noted  that  the quality  of  audited 
project financial  statements  in Myanmar  are  sometimes not  compliant  with ADB  requirements, 
under RCDP, MOALI will ensure that international financial reporting standards will be applied for 
project financial reporting for ADB and ADB administered funds. Accounting processes will follow 
the  International  Public  Sector  Accounting  Standards  that  apply  to  government  financial 
management.   
Auditing and Public Disclosure 
43.  MOALI  will  ensure  the  detailed  consolidated  project financial  statements  are  audited  in 
accordance with International Standards for Auditing by a qualified auditor acceptable to ADB. 
The  Office  of  the  Auditor  General  applies  the  International  Standards  of  Supreme  Audit 
Institutions  for  all  auditing,  and  the  same  standards  are  applied  by  private  sector  auditors  in 
Myanmar.  The  audited  project  financial  statements  together  with  the  auditor’s  opinion  will  be 
presented  in  the  English  language  to  ADB  within  6  months  from  the  end  of  the  fiscal  year  by 
MOALI. 
44. 
The audit report for the project financial statements will include a management letter and 
auditor’s opinions, which cover (i) whether the project financial statements present an accurate 
and fair view or are presented fairly, in all material respects, in accordance with the applicable 
financial reporting standards; (ii) whether the proceeds of the loan, grant, and ADB administered 
funds were used only for the purpose(s) of the project; and (iii) whether the borrower or executing 
agency was in compliance with the financial covenants contained in the legal agreements (where 
applicable). The audit report will be reviewed by MOALI and any issues raised will be followed up 
by DRD. 
12  SOE forms are available in Appendix 7B and 7D of ADB’s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from 
time to time). 
32 
Compliance with financial reporting and auditing requirements will be monitored by review 
45. 
missions  and  during  normal  project  supervision,  and  followed  up  regularly  with  all  concerned, 
including the qualified auditor.  
The government, MOALI and DRD have been made aware of ADB’s approach to delayed 
46. 
submission, and the requirements for satisfactory and acceptable quality of the audited project 
financial  statements.13  ADB  reserves the right to  require  a change in the auditor  (in a manner 
consistent with the constitution of the borrower), or for additional support to be provided to the 
auditor, if the audits required are not conducted in a manner satisfactory to ADB, or if the audits 
are  substantially  delayed.  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  verify  the  project's  financial  accounts  to 
confirm  that  the  share  of  ADB’s  financing  is  used  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  policies  and 
procedures.  
47. 
Public disclosure of the audited project financial statements, including the auditor’s opinion 
on the project financial statements, will be guided by ADB’s Access to Information Policy.14 After 
the  review,  ADB  will  disclose  the  audited  project  financial  statements  and  the  opinion  of  the 
auditors on the project financial statements no later than 14 days of ADB’s confirmation of their 
acceptability by posting them on ADB’s website. The management letter and additional auditor’s 
opinions will not be disclosed.15 
PROCUREMENT AND CONSULTING SERVICES 
Advance Contracting  
All  advance  contracting  will  be  undertaken  in  conformity  with  ADB  Procurement  Policy 
49. 
(2017, as amended from time to time), and ADB Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers 
(2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).16  The  issuance  of  invitations  to  bid  under  advance 
contracting will be subject to ADB approval. The borrower, executing and implementing agencies 
have  been  advised  that  approval  of  advance  contracting  does  not  commit  ADB  to  finance  the 
project. 
ADB  and  the  government  identified  the  packages  for  advance  action,  and  these  are 
50. 
included in the procurement plan. 
13 ADB’s approach and procedures regarding delayed submission of audited project financial statements:  
(i)  When audited project financial statements are not received by the due date, ADB will write to the executing 
agency advising that (a) the audit documents are overdue; and (b) if they are not received within the next 
6 months,  requests  for  new  contract  awards  and  disbursement  such  as  new  replenishment  of  advance 
accounts, processing of new reimbursement, and issuance of new commitment letters will not be processed. 
(ii)  When  audited  project  financial  statements  are  not  received  within  6  months  after  the  due  date,  ADB  will 
withhold processing of requests for new contract awards and disbursement such as new replenishment of 
advance  accounts,  processing  of  new  reimbursement,  and  issuance  of  new  commitment  letters.  ADB  will 
(a) inform the executing agency of ADB’s actions; and (b) advise that the loan may be suspended if the audit 
documents are not received within the next 6 months. 
(iii)  When audited project financial statements  are not received within 12 months after the due date, ADB may 
suspend the loan.

Procurement of Goods, Works, and Consulting Services 
All  procurement  and  recruitment  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB’s 
51. 
Procurement  Policy,  Goods,  Works,  Nonconsulting  and  Consulting  Services  (2017,  as 
amended  from  time  to  time)  and  Procurement  Regulations  for  ADB  Borrowers,  Goods, 
Works, Nonconsulting and Consulting Services (2017, as amended from time). Procurement 
planning  has  been  guided  by  ADB’s  Strategic  Procurement  Planning,  Guidance  Note  on 
Procurement (June 2018). 
52. 
The procurement of goods, works and nonconsulting services will use open competitive 
bidding with national advertising, request for quotation, and direct contracting. Open competitive 
bidding with international advertising is not envisaged under the project. 
53. 
The  main  implementation  consultant  (MIC)  and  five  township  cluster  service  support 
providers  (SSPs)  will  be  recruited  using the quality-  and cost-based  selection  (QCBS) method 
with a quality-cost ratio of 90:10. 
54. 
A consulting firm will be recruited for the MIC to (i) provide management and technical 
support  to  DRD  in  the  implementation  of  the  project  and  meet  the  reporting  and  procedural 
requirements  of  ADB;  (ii)  strengthen the  institutional  and  operational  capacity  of  the  DRD;  (iii) 
carry out supervision of subproject activities; (iv) support project performance M&E; (v) develop 
and  implement  the  capacity  building  master  plan;  and  (vi)  ensure  adequate  provision  for 
compliance with social and environmental safeguards, including monitoring and review. The MIC 
will  provide  1,231  person-months  of  consulting  inputs  (233  person-months  international,  998 
person-months national) over a period of 72 months.  
55. 
The township cluster SSPs will be engaged to: (i) facilitate project management and 
implementation  at  the  township,  village  tract,  and  village  level,  and  (ii)  strengthen  the 
institutional and operational capacity of the implementing agency. The amount of inputs per 
contract  depends  on  the  population  of  the  townships  and  consideration  of  travel  time,  on 
average inputs per contract will be about 10,324 person-months.  
Incremental  administrative  costs.  The  project  will  make  use  of  incremental 
56. 
administrative costs to allow DRD to absorb the facilitators recruited under SSPs. Therefore, 
community,  technical,  livelihood  and  finance  facilitators  recruited  through  the  five  SSP 
contracts would, subject to a satisfactory work performance assessment, be transferred to 
respective  DRD  PIUs  following  the  completion  of  the  third  year  of  the  SSP  contract  and 
financed  by  the  project  under  an  incremental  administration  costs  arrangement.  SSP 
contracts will cover only key national experts after year 3. 
57. 
The outline terms of reference for the MIC and SSPs are in Appendix 1.  
58. 
An  18-month  procurement  plan  indicating  review  procedures,  goods,  works, 
consulting  and  non-consulting  service  contract  packages  and  open  competitive  bidding 
guidelines is in Section C.

67. 
Bids shall not be rejected and new bids solicited without ADB's prior concurrence. 
c. 
Bidding Documents 
(i) 
ADB Policy Clauses 
68. 
A  provision  shall  be  included  in  all  OCB  works  and  goods  contracts  financed  by  ADB 
requiring suppliers and contractors to permit ADB to inspect their accounts and records and other 
documents relating to the bid submission and the performance of the contract, and to have them 
audited by auditors appointed by ADB. 
69. 
A provision shall be included in all bidding documents for OCB works and goods contracts 
financed by ADB stating that the Borrower shall reject a proposal for award if it determines that 
the  bidder  recommended  for  award  has,  directly  or  through  an  agent,  engaged  in  corrupt, 
fraudulent, collusive, coercive or obstructive practices in competing for the contract in question. 
70. 
A provision shall be included in all bidding documents for OCB works and goods contracts 
financed by ADB stating that ADB will declare a firm or individual ineligible, either indefinitely or 
for a stated period, to be awarded a contract financed by ADB, if it at any time determines that 
the firm or individual has, directly or through an agent, engaged in corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, 
coercive or obstructive practices or any integrity violation in competing for, or in executing, ADB-
financed contract. 
SAFEGUARDS 
Prohibited investment activities. Pursuant to ADB’s Safeguard Policy Statement (SPS, 
71. 
2009), ADB funds may not be applied to the activities described on the ADB Prohibited Investment 
Activities List set forth at Appendix 5 of the Safeguard Policy Statement (2009).  
Consultation and Participation 
72. 
The project is category B for involuntary resettlement impacts as subprojects are small in 
scale and impacts are not deemed likely or are insignificant. In case of land acquisition and any 
involuntary impacts identified (on titleholders and non-titleholders in accordance with SPS), the 
subproject  will  be  dropped  or  not  financed  by  ADB.  From  the  experience  of  the  ERLIP  and 
NCDDP,  it  is  unlikely  that  land  will  be  acquired  for  community  infrastructure  subprojects.  The 
subproject screening and selection criteria will identify and reject any subprojects that will result 
in  involuntary  resettlement  or  compulsory  acquisition.  Investments  in  village  roads  and  water 
supply schemes could require minor land use reallocation, in which case the project will pursue 
voluntary donation. Due diligence and meaningful consultation will be conducted to ensure that 
40 
land  donation  is  carried  out  on  a  voluntary  basis  and  that  persons  donating  are  not  adversely 
impacted. The  due diligence  and consultation  will  verify  that  the  donation is  and  did  not  result 
from  coercion,  using  written  records  and  confirmation  through  an  independent  third  party.  A 
Community Participation Framework (CPF) has been prepared. The CPF shall be used to conduct 
social safeguards assessments of all subprojects. The CPF will ensure that:   
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
(v) 
All  affected  people  are  informed,  consulted  and  participate  in  deciding  on  the 
proposed subprojects that will be implemented in their area.  
Supporting legal documents are executed prior to subprojects implementation.     
Specific arrangements between the affected people and the village committees or 
township administrators have been documented and complied with. 
Consultations commence as early as possible in the project preparation stage and 
continue on an ongoing basis throughout the project cycle. 
Information  is  provided  in  a  timely,  adequately,  understandable,  and  readily 
accessible manner to affected people. 
Consultations are undertaken in an atmosphere free of intimidation or coercion; 
(vi) 
(vii)  Consultations  are  gender  inclusive  and  responsive,  tailored  to  the  needs  of 
disadvantaged and vulnerable groups (i.e., separate meetings for women and/or 
vulnerable groups).  
(ix) 
(x) 
(viii)  All relevant views of affected people and other stakeholders are incorporated into 
the decision-making, including in project design, mitigation measures, sharing of 
development benefits and opportunities and implementation issues.   
Adequate local level grievance redress mechanism is in place. 
In  case  people  are  not  ready  to  contribute  voluntarily,  expropriation  will  not  be 
allowed, and the subproject will be dropped from ADB financing. 
Land contributed to the project does not belong to the poorest or most vulnerable 
households. 
In no case shall voluntary donation be allowed for traditional and cultural lands and 
assets,  worship  sites,  assets  of  vulnerable  people  (disabled,  elderly,  woman-
headed households). 
(xii) 
(xi) 
(xiii)  Verification of land donation will be confirmed by the VTDSC. 
(xiv)  All  voluntary  donations  will  be  documented.  It  will  be  ensured  that  voluntary 
donation  of  land  does  not  physically  or  economically  displace  the  donor  or  any 
third party (tenants, non-titleholders etc.) living on that land. 
(xv)  Physical  assets  (houses,  shelters,  shops,  sheds,  any  dwelling,  trees  or  other 
income generating assets) cannot be donated. Land over which these assets stand 
will not be allowed for donation under the project and proposed subprojects over 
these lands will not be financed. 
73. 
The SPS requires that project affected people be informed about all aspects of the project 
and consulted about its anticipated impacts. The RCDP activity cycle has built-in mechanisms to 
guarantee that all affected people are informed and consulted regarding a proposed subproject 
and  ensure  that  involuntary  expropriation  of  land and physical  or  economic  displacements  are 
avoided.  The  framework  provides  guidance  on  how  to  execute  voluntary  land  donation  for 
subprojects, should this be required. The goal of these safeguard requirements is to ensure that 
development interventions do not disadvantage project affected persons.

Guidance on Voluntary Donation 
Principle 
Guidance Notes 
The 
impacts  are  marginal  (based  on 
percentage  of  loss  and  minimum  size  of 
remaining assets) 
Impacts  do  not  result  in  displacement  of 
households  or  cause  loss  of  household 
incomes or livelihood 
households  making 
The 
voluntary 
donations  are  direct  beneficiaries  of  the 
project 
Land  donated  is  free  from  dispute  of 
ownership or any other encumbrances 
Consultations with the affected households 
are  conducted  in  a  free  and  transparent 
manner 
Proper  documentation  of  consultation 
meetings, grievances and actions taken to 
address such grievances is accomplished 
The  land  donated  does  not  exceed  5%  of  the  total  land 
owned by the affected household. 
Donation  does  not  result  in  the  loss  of  other  permanent 
assets  or  improvements  or  severely  affect  the  living 
standards of households. 
Donations  or  land  will  only  be  accepted  if  the  total  land 
owned  by  the  household  is  not  less  than  300  square 
meters. 
Only  secondary  structures  are  affected;  there  is  no 
physical relocation of households due to land donation. 
Both  positive  and  negative  impacts  of  the  project  on  the 
affected household are considered.  
The  affected  household  can  identify  the  project’s  direct 
benefits. 
Land  donation  is  linked  directly  to  benefits  for  the 
community. 
The affected household has recognized legal tenure. 
The land is not being occupied or used by any other party 
and if it is, the occupants must be consulted and he or she 
has to agree voluntarily to donate land use rights.  
Ownership of the land is not disputed. 
The  affected  household  receives  clear  and  adequate 
information  on  the  project  and  participates  in  project 
planning. 
Provisions  for  voluntary  donation  are  integrated  in  the 
decision-making process at the community level. 
The agreement is properly documented with signatures of 
affected person and witnesses. 
Voluntary  donations  are  confirmed  through  verbal  and 
written records and verified by an independent third party 
(VTDSC). 
Consultation  meetings,  grievances  and  actions  taken  to 
address such grievances are properly recorded. 
Voluntary donation will follow the following steps, consistent with and integrated into the

Discussion on the safeguard policies of RCDP. 
Project orientation - dissemination of information to all relevant 
stakeholders on project cycle, processes, grievance mechanism 
and land donation concept, including safeguard policies, CPF, 
requirements to address and mitigate risks.  
Eligibility screening. 
Villagers will identify needs and proposed list of subprojects. 
Villagers are oriented on types of activities included in the negative 
list  to  determine  if  their  proposed  SP  is  eligible  for  funding. 
Negative list includes activities of SPs that will require involuntary 
resettlement.  
Negative list will be applied to delist non-eligible SPs.  
Safeguards screening and classification. 
Safeguards screening tool are introduced and discussed, 
including the CPF policies and procedures, physical cultural 
resources management and voluntary land donation principles 
and steps. 
Elected VDSC and sub-committee members are trained on their 
tasks in ensuring compliance with safeguard policies.   
Volunteers analyze information from the VDP Participatory 
Reflection and Action (PRA), the resource and social map to 
assess whether the proposed long list of SP concepts may 
involve land acquisition. Survey will be done to identify and verify 
land requirements, identify affected people and their vulnerability 
(using household ranking). Landowners help determine the 
location of the SP in coordination with the technical project staff. 
Socio-economic Survey.   
Villagers will be trained in SP concept preparation, including filling 
in  of  safeguard  checklists.  Using  the  involuntary  safeguard 
checklist (Appendix 1).  CFs and TFs will prepare an inventory for 
each village-identified infrastructure SP, as screened in Step 3 and 
prepare including the Inventory of Loss if needed. 
If  land  acquisition  is  unavoidable,  mitigation  measures  will  be 
discussed and designed.  
A  census  and  socioeconomic  profile  of  affected  persons  will  be 
undertaken.  The  inventory  should  include  the  following  data: 
(i) names and number of persons to be affected; (ii) number of plots 
or land area that will be occupied by the proposed SP; (iii) category 
or type of agricultural land area needed for the SP; (iv) number and 
types of crops or trees removed; (v) category of any fixed assets 
that will be affected by the proposed SP; and (vi) extent and type 
of temporary damage to productive assets. The survey will identify 
the conditions, needs and preferences of poor households, women 
headed households, and ethnic groups.  
Preliminary inventory of loss (IOL) survey or detailed 
measurement survey (DMS) will be conducted as well.

documented. 
It must be made clear at this stage that land where permanent or 
fixed  assets  stand  (dwelling,  houses,  shops,  permanent  trees) 
cannot  be  subject  of  a  donation  and  proposed  SPs  over  these 
lands will not be funded. 
Consultations  with  communities  and  affected  persons, 
preparation of safeguard instruments and disclosure. 
VDSC  will  to  conduct  consultations  with  whole  community  and 
affected  persons  on  proposed  SP  and  donation  process  to 
ascertain  willingness  to  donate.    The  result  of  the  inventory  and 
survey in step 4 will be presented at the village meeting. 
If  donation  option  is  chosen,  donation  documents  are  explained 
and signed, CFs ensure that this is a free and informed choice and 
a copy of the signed voluntary donation form (Safeguards Form 2) 
is attached to the SP proposal for verification by the VTDSC. 
Village  decides  on  a  priority  list  of  SPs  for  submission  to  the 
VTDSC.    Safeguard  risks  and  proposed  mitigation  measures, 
including voluntary land and asset donation that will be integrated 
in the SP design  are reviewed and integrated into the proposals 
(Safeguards Form 2). 
Consultation  proceedings  and  agreements  will  be  documented 
and  disclosed  by  posting  in  community  boards  in  a  place 
accessible  to  affected  communities  and  in  a  form  and  language 
understandable to affected persons and other stakeholders. 
Validation of donation.   
VTDSC is oriented ad trained on their role in safeguard processing 
and  approval,  including  the  Project’s  negative  list  and  CPF 
principles and procedures.  Discussion on potential need for land 
and  other  assets  for  the  SP,  and  how  this  can  affect  vulnerable 
population.  Potential  negative  SP  impacts  are  identified  and 
mitigating measures are identified.  
VTDSC prioritizes list of SP proposals for submission to TPIC. If 
negative impacts cannot be avoided the SP will not be funded. 
VTDSC  reviews  SP  concept  proposals  and  screens  them  for 
safeguard  concerns  with  special  focus  on  the  land  acquisition 
checklist, including the Inventory of Loss if needed. TFs ensure IR 
safeguard  risks  are  identified  and  appropriate  avoidance  are 
integrated in the SP technical design. 
Donation  forms  are  reviewed  and  validated.  VTDSC  will  confirm 
through a face-to-face meeting that the affected people are aware 
of the SP and knowingly agree to donate land. Once the approval 
of the landowner has been confirmed in  writing, VTDSC  will ask 
both the husband and the wife to sign the voluntary donation form 
in the presence of the VDSC. 
Minutes  of  this  meeting,  which  include  confirmation  that  all 
conditions for voluntary donations are met, will be attached to the 
signed voluntary donation form.

will keep another original copy. 
Clearance to Proceed with Detailed Design. 
The TPIC is oriented on the project and processes and its role in 
reviewing  safeguard  screening  and  compliance  by  safeguard 
specialist at SSP.   
Safeguard  specialist  and  PIU  assist  TPIC  in  reviewing  the 
safeguard issues surrounding the proposed SP concepts. 
TPIC reviews and approves safeguard screening, and actions for 
proposed SP proposals and clear SP concepts for detailed design. 
Integrating Safeguards in SP designs. 
Community  Infrastructure,  Livelihood  and  safeguard  specialist, 
with CFs, LFs, and TFs assist the VDSC in developing the full SP 
proposal and technical designs, with safeguard actions integrated. 
VDSCs  prepare  detailed  proposals 
incorporating  safeguard 
aspects in workplans and attaching voluntary donation forms.   
A final IOL survey or DMS will be conducted as part of the detailed 
design with a demarcation of land to be acquired.  
Step 9: Final review 
and approval of SP 
proposals (TPIC 
meeting) 
TPIC ensures that all safeguard actions and documentation have 
been  complied  with.    Donation  instruments  are  presented  to  the 
TPIC for final review.  TPIC approves detailed plans and release

landowner(s) and the VDSC.  An independent third party will verify this. A copy of the proof of 
ownership shall be obtained by the PIU. In case the landowner has unclear titles or is unable to 
provide proof of ownership, a committee comprising of representatives from the VTDSC and a 
member from the PIU will be assigned to verify ownership. 
Ethnic Groups 
There are ethnic groups living in most project townships.17 In the target regions of Chin 
76. 
and  Naga  State  Administered  Zone,  there  are  ethnic  groups  residing  either  within  or  outside 
ancestral  domains.  The  project  is  assessed  as  category  B  and  an  ethnic  group  development 
framework  (EGDF)  has  been  prepared  to  guide  the  screening  of  each  subproject  for  possible 
ethnic group impacts and to ensure inclusiveness, consultation and participation as needed. No 
subprojects with negative impacts on ethnic groups will be financed. 
77. 
Social impact assessment activities are integrated in RCDP and are carried out throughout 
the project cycle. The social impact assessment is not a single, time-bound activity, but involves 
the continued gathering of demographic and other relevant data on the sociocultural, political and 
economic  situation  of  the ethnic  communities  in project  areas.  An  important  component  of  the 
social  impact  assessment  is  the  identification  of  all  project-affected  ethnic  communities,  their 
population, location, and level of vulnerability, and potential to benefit from RCDP subprojects.  
78. 
The  project  uses  participatory  processes  to  ensure  that  ethnic  groups  are  genuinely 
involved during social preparation, subproject identification, and project implementation. During 
social preparation, the community facilitator will conduct a comprehensive social investigation to:

Culturally appropriate data collection methods will be used to ensure that data gathering 
is  sensitive  to  the  cultural  realities  of  the  ethnic  groups.  The  project  will  work  with  academics, 
ethnic group experts, and civil society groups to gather data on traditional knowledge that can 
contribute  to  building  resilience  to  natural  hazards.  In  areas  where  vulnerable  ethnic  groups 
maintain  a  traditional  lifestyle  based  on  subsistence  agriculture,  the  project  will  make  use  of 
ethnographic data and consult anthropologists to ensure that livelihood programs are appropriate 
for the ethnic groups’ customary way of life.  
80. 
The  ethnic  groups  screening  checklist  is  prepared  at  the  same  time  as  the  subproject 
concept proposals are being developed and before they are finalized. For highly vulnerable ethnic 
groups or when ethnic groups are a minority in a village, the safeguard is triggered, regardless of 
whether  impacts  are  positive  or  negative.  When  this  happens,  the  villages  will  be  assisted 
in developing  an  ethnic  group  development  plan  (EGDP)  (Appendix  2  of  the  EGDF)  with  the 
subproject concept proposal. 
81. 
In  no  case  shall  subprojects  that  will  have  negative  impact  on  ethnic  groups  and  their 
culture be funded by the project. Subprojects that will result in taking and use of traditional, cultural 
and  ethnic  lands  and  territories,  places  of  worship,  whether  by  ordinary  transfer  or  donation, 
including those not belonging to but have cultural significance to ethnic groups shall not be funded 
and  will  be  included  in  the  negative  list.  This  is  consistent  with  the  Community  Participation 
Framework (CPF) of the project.

Poverty and Social 
84. 
The project is classified as targeted intervention geographic. It will benefit about 1.8 million 
people in an estimated 360,000 households, increasing the standards of living of at least 80% of 
total communities by 20% and raising the resilience of project communities above the baseline. 
This  will  be  achieved  through  institutionalizing  community  participation,  strengthening  the 
availability  and  resilience  of  community  infrastructure,  improving  access  to  markets,  raising 
household  incomes  through  farm  and  non-farm  livelihood  investments  and  building  skills  and 
knowledge to address CDR.  It  will  promote  inclusive economic  growth, reduce  poverty  among 
beneficiaries,  provide  rural  employment  opportunities  and  improve  market  opportunities  and 
access.  Community-identified  infrastructure  construction  will  provide  practical  skill  training  and 
skilled and unskilled work opportunities for community members. Groups of poor and vulnerable 
farm  and  non-farm  households,  particularly  women-headed  households,  will  be  enabled  to 
improve  their  livelihood  through  access  to  skills  training,  livelihood  grants  and  local  technical 
services. 
Environment 
85. 
Through  climate-resilient  infrastructure  and  livelihood  improvement,  the  project  is 
expected to achieve significant benefits. In accordance with the ADB SPS (2009), the project has 
been  classified  as  Category  B.  As  this  is  a  sector  project,  an  environmental  assessment  and 
review framework (EARF) has been prepared to ensure that all subprojects avoid and/or mitigate 
adverse  environmental  impacts.  Public  consultation  was  undertaken,  and  a  grievance  redress 
mechanism  has  been  designed  to  address  issues  and  complaints  that  may  arise  during 
implementation.  
86. 
Environmental  Assessment.  All  subprojects  will  undergo  environmental  screening. 
Subproject  selection  criteria  have  been  formulated  to  avoid  significant  adverse  environmental 
impacts.  Subprojects 
irreversible,  diverse  or 
unprecedented adverse environmental impacts (Category A under ADB SPS) are not eligible for 
funding.  Only  subprojects  requiring  Environmental  Codes  of  Practice  (ECOPs)  and  or 
environmental management plans (EMPs). ECOPs have been developed for the project.

51 
87. 
Village committees supported by community facilitator, technical facilitators, and livelihood 
facilitators have primary responsibility for environmental assessment of subprojects. Safeguards 
screening  (using  Safeguards  Form  1:  Safeguards  Screening  as  provided  in  the  EARF)  will  be 
undertaken as early as possible, in the process of identifying and prioritizing sub-projects. Based 
on the results of screening all subprojects will either follow prescribed ECOPs or prepare an EMP.  
88. 
All  EMPs  and  ECOPs  will  incorporated  subproject  implementation  workplans.  If 
contractors are required, EMPs and ECOPs will be included into bidding documents and contract 
documents. Implementation of the EARF and environmental supervision, compliance monitoring 
of subprojects, and reporting will be conducted by the environmental staff in the DRD PMU and 
PIUs  with  strong  support  from  environmental  safeguard  specialists  of  the  MIC  and  SSPs. 
Necessary human and financial resources have been allocated for these activities. The project is 
expected  to  achieve  significant  socio-economic  benefits  through  provision  of  climate-resilient 
basic  infrastructure  and  livelihood  improvements.  The  small-scale  community  infrastructure 
subprojects  are  anticipated  to  have  minimal  to  minor  adverse  environmental  impacts.  These 
impacts  will  be  limited  to  the  construction  period,  will  be  localized  and  reversible,  and  can  be 
mitigated through good construction practices and standard mitigation measures.   
89. 
Indicative Environmental Safeguard Staffing Requirements. To implement the EARF, 
environmental safeguard personnel are needed at all levels (see table below). Detailed terms of 
reference have been prepared for all positions.

Safeguards Grievance Redress Mechanism. Within six months of the date of project 
effectiveness, MOALI and DRD will ensure that a grievance redress mechanism to support the 
social and environmental safeguards of the project is established. The existing feedback handling 
mechanism (FHM) being used for ERLIP will be expanded and further strengthened to serve this 
purpose.  At project management level, it is lodged with the M&E Unit of the PMU as feedback 
focal point (FFP). The PIUs also have their own FFP. At community level, FFPs are created at 
village and village tract.  
91. 
The PMU, PIUs, the village tract forums and the community facilitators will make the public 
aware of the FHM through public awareness campaigns, training and capacity building. The PMU 
52 
and PIUs will each nominate and train their safeguard officers and the community facilitators to 
be  an  FFP.  Any  person  who  has  complaints  regarding  the  safeguard’s  performance  of  the 
subproject during pre-construction, construction and operation phases shall have access to the 
FHM described in the subsequent section. 
92. 
The  FHM  is  accessible  to all  RCDP  stakeholders,  including  ethnic,  religious,  and  other 
special groups.  The mechanism focuses on receiving, recording, and resolving complaints.  The 
FHM  is  supported  by  an  information  campaign  and  training  program.  Respected  and  trusted 
feedback focal points (one male and one female) are elected in each village, to form the Village 
Tract  Feedback  Committee.  Dedicated  staff  are  also  assigned  to  handle  feedback  in  each 
township, and at the union level.  
The feedback and grievance handling process involve five steps: (1) intake, (2) sorting,

96. 
At the community level, the feedback focal point is the regular primary contact for anyone 
who wishes to file a feedback.  If an individual prefers, s/he can send feedback to others involved 
in the project implementation, such as a village volunteer, community facilitator, VDSC member, 
VTDSC member, or township engineer. 
All involved in project implementation are trained on how to receive and handle feedback, 
97. 
and how to keep them confidential. 
98. 
Township level staff receiving feedback must complete the feedback form, and submit it 
without  delay  to  the  assigned  township\feedback  handling  focal  point,  or  township  DRD 
53 
counterpart; and 
Union  level  staff  receiving  feedback  must  complete  the  feedback  form  and  submit  it 
99. 
without delay to the feedback-handling officer of the union-level technical assistance team. 
100.  Step  2:  Sorting.  The  monitoring  and  evaluation  (M&E)  specialist  at  PMU,  assigned  to 
handle  feedback,  sorts  feedback  into  eight  categories  and  enters  these  into  the  management 
information system (MIS): 
Category 1: General inquiries 
Category 2: Feedback regarding violations of policies, guidelines and procedures  
Category 3: Feedback regarding contract violations/breach of contract 
Category 4: Feedback regarding the misuse of project funds 
Category 5: Feedback regarding abuse of power/intervention 
Category 6: Reports of force majeure 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
(v) 
(vi) 
(vii)  Category 7: Suggestion 
(viii)  Category 8: Appreciation   
101.  For feedback received at the union level, the feedback handling specialists of the PMU 
records enquiries/feedback/reports using these same eight categories. 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
If the feedback relates to a village or village tract, the feedback handling specialist 
of the MIC team forwards it to the respective feedback specialist of the SSP team; 
If  the  feedback  relates  to  a  township  or  union  issue,  the  feedback  handling 
specialist of the MIC team submits it to the DRD union office; 
The DRD union office decides on a course of action within 2 weeks of receiving 
the information; and 
In resolving the feedback, the DRD union office follows the steps below. 
102.  Once feedback has been received, the DRD Township office head and SSP team (team 
leader and feedback handling officer) decide how to handle it based on the general procedures 
and processes in the Operations Manual. 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
(v) 
(vi) 
They determine the timeframe within which the case should be resolved, with a 
timeframe not exceeding 90 days;  
The  feedback  handling  specialist  of  the  SSP  team  records  the  timeframe  and 
agreed course of action and enters this data into the MIS; 
Feedback  relating  to  a  village  issue  are  handled  by  the  VDSC  itself,  by  the 
respective VTDSC, or by the village tract level feedback committee; 
Feedback relating to a village tract issue are handled by the township SSP;   
The DRD township office head and SSP team (team leader and feedback handling 
officer) determine who shall handle the feedback; and 
For feedback that are of a serious nature (e.g., all allegations of fraud or corruption, 
and potentially any feedback in categories 2 through 5), the DRD township office 
head consults with the Union Feedback Committee for advice on the appropriate 
action. 
If  the  person  filing  the  feedback  is  known,  the  feedback  focal  point  communicates  the 
103. 
timeframe and course of action to her/him within two weeks of receipt of the feedback. 
54 
104.  Step  3:  Verification.  The  staff  handling  the  feedback  gathers  facts  and  clarifies 
information to generate a clear picture of the circumstances surrounding the feedback. Verification 
normally includes site visits, a review of documents, a meeting with the complainant (if known and 
willing  to  engage),  VDSC  members,  and  meetings  with  those  who  could  resolve  the  issue 
(including formal and informal village leaders). Feedback related to the misuse of funds may also 
require meetings with suppliers and contractors.  
105.  For serious feedback received at the union level by phone or letter, the Union Feedback 
Committee  decides  whether  (i)  to  launch  its  own  investigation;  or  (ii)  instruct  the  Township 
Feedback  Committee  to  conduct  initial  investigation  at  the  location  where the feedback  and/or 
problem occurred. If the Township Feedback Committee cannot resolve the feedback, it will be 
reported back to the Union Feedback Committee, for further action.  
106.  Within the allotted period, the results of the verification are presented to the Village Tract 
Feedback Committee (for village issues), or the DRD township office (for village tract issues), for 
action. 
107.  The feedback handler fills in the feedback form and submits it to the feedback-handling 
officer of the SSP team, who enters it into the MIS. 
108.  Step  4:  Action.  Feedback  from  the  village  level  should  be  handled  in  the  village,  if 
possible. For issues that cannot be resolved quickly at the village level, the Village Tract Feedback 
Committee reviews these feedbacks and the results of the verification determines the action to 
be  taken.  Once  the  needed  action(s)  are  carried  out,  the  feedback  handler  fills  in  a  feedback 
report, and submits it to the township level, where it is entered into the MIS. 
109. 
If the actions cannot be carried out, or the feedback cannot be satisfactorily resolved in 
reasonable period  of time  (less than  two months),  the  VTDSC  refers the  case to  the township 
level.  The  DRD  township  office  head  and  SSP  (lead  specialist  and  feedback  handling  officer) 
review the case and determine the action to be taken. 
110.  Township  level  M&E,  or  feedback  focal,  has  to  enter  the  feedback  into  the  MIS  within 
seven days of receipt.  Serious feedback must be entered immediately into the MIS.  
111.  Once action to resolve the feedback has been taken, the feedback-handling officer of the 
SSP records the action taken in the MIS. 
112.  The DRD township office head consults with the DRD union office in case no action can 
be agreed, or no resolution of the feedback is possible. 
113. 
If  the  complainant  is  known,  the  FFP  (or  person  with  whom  the  feedback  was  filed) 
communicates  the  action  to  her/him.  The  feedback  focal  point  must  seek  feedback  from  the 
complainant  as  to  whether  s/he  deems  the  action(s)  satisfactory.  If  the  action  is  considered 
unsatisfactory, the complainant may file a new feedback. A new feedback on an existing case is 
handled at the next higher level from the initial case. 
114.  The VDSC communicates the action taken as a result of a feedback, to villagers at the 
next village meeting. 
115.  The VTDSC also reports on feedback received and grievances resolved during the annual 
social audit meeting at village tract level. 
55 
116.  Step  5:  Follow-up.  During  the  social  audit  open  meetings,  villagers  discuss  the 
effectiveness of the feedback handling system and gather suggestions on how to improve it. 
In its regular supervision visits, the DRD union office and MIC assess the functioning of 
117. 
the feedback handling system and undertake spot checks. 
118.  The  DRD  union  office  uses  the  MIS  to  provide  a  monthly  snapshot  of  the  feedback 
handling  system (number  and  category  of  comments  received,  and grievances  or  suggestions 
resolved), including any suggestions received and acted on. 
119.  The DRD union office uses the MIS to report on feedback in its quarterly implementation 
progress reports, and its annual reports. Reports include information on grievance resolution and 
trends (number of grievances received, cause of grievance, number resolved, average time taken 
to resolve a grievance, percentage of individuals having filed a grievance who are satisfied with 
the action taken, number of grievances resolved at the lowest applicable level, etc.). 
120.  The DRD union office and the ADB review feedback monitoring data, as part of regular 
implementation support missions. 
121.  A review of the feedback handling system (including the feedback of those who have used 
it) is undertaken during every second year to assess the efficacy of the mechanism and introduce 
improvements. 
INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS  
122.  The executing agency has overall responsibility for the project and therefore is ultimately 
responsible for ensuring the implementation of the requisite safeguards requirements as per the 
Government of Myanmar laws and regulations and the ADB SPS (2009).  
123.  Project  Management.  The  PIU  will  also  comprise  safeguard  specialists.  The 
implementing agencies will be the DRD at the township level, with five cluster PIUs established, 
one in each of the project regions/state clusters to coordinate the subproject activities at the village 
tract level. A Township Project Implementing Committee (TPIC) reviews, screens and approves 
technical  and  safeguard  feasibility  of  subprojects.    The  TPIC  is  composed  of  the  township 
representatives of line ministry representatives (health, education, agriculture, planning, etc.). 
124.  The  PMU  and  PIUs  are  responsible  for  the  overall  implementation  of  the  subproject 
safeguard measures. The PIUs will have a designated social safeguard officer who conduct social 
safeguard supervision monitoring of at least 10% of randomly selected subprojects annually and 
act as feedback focal point for the FHM. They will be supported by the social safeguard specialists 
of the MIC and SSPs.  
125.  Main Implementation Consultants (including international and national social safeguard 
specialists) provide support to the PMU. Social safeguard specialists will be responsible to:   
(i) 
(ii) 
prepare  the  participation  and  consultation  and  social  procedures  (including 
updated  screening  forms,  and  update  verification  forms)  for  the  operational 
manual;  
provide  training  to  national  social  safeguard  specialists  on  CPF  and  EGDF 
implementation;  
56 
(iii) 
(iv) 
(v) 
provide training to community level facilitators and village communities on social 
assessment procedures for subprojects; 
undertake the Quality Assurance Review after each subproject cycle; and 
assist  the  PIUs  and/or  PMU  with the  preparation  of  social  safeguard monitoring 
report. 
126.  Support  Service  Providers  (SSP)  (including  national  social  safeguard  specialists)  will 
support the PIUs and TPIC.  SSP social safeguards expert will:  
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
train  village  and  village  tract  forums  in  social  safeguard  requirements  for  the 
project;  
provide guidance and technical inputs during village planning activities regarding 
social safeguards and ensure sound and critical analysis of gathered data during 
PRA and formulation of VDP and VTDPs; 
assist  the  project  facilitators  in  integrating  social  safeguard  guidelines,  into  the 
subproject design, implementation and monitoring; and 
assist in the preparation and consolidation of social safeguard monitoring reports 
at the township level. 
127.  Support  Service  Providers:  Community  Facilitators,  Technical  Facilitators,  and 
Livelihood Facilitators. The facilitators will have the following responsibilities:  
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
(v) 
(vi) 
(vii) 
ensure safeguards risk are identified, and appropriate mitigation are integrated into 
the subproject technical design;  
assist with safeguards screening of the concept and full subproject proposal, and 
technical designs;  
assist  in  the  conduct  an  inventory  of  all  project  affected  people,  conduct  of 
consultations, preparation of minutes of meetings; 
assist with preparation of land and asset donation documents and verification; 
ensure that the schedule of safeguards implementation and monitoring activities is 
included into the subproject implementation workplan; 
ensure  that  mitigation  measures  are  implemented  once  the  potential  adverse 
impact occurs during the construction; and 
assist VDSC committees with social safeguards reporting.  
128.  Village  Level  Committees.  Village  level  committees,  in  collaboration  with  community 
facilitators  and  village volunteers, monitor  the  implementation  of the  safeguard measures. The 
VTDSCs confirm the proper application of the measures and notify the TPIC that a subproject is 
ready  for  implementation.  Throughout  the  implementation  of  a  subproject,  village  volunteers 
monitor  any  adverse  impacts  that  may  arise.  Community facilitators  regularly  visit  villages and 
receive feedback. If villagers have any questions or grievances that cannot be answered at the 
community level, they are encouraged to seek clarifications and solutions through the FHM. 
129.  The  village  level  committees  will  summarize  social  safeguard  related  activities  in  their 
monthly reports to the relevant PIUs for consolidation and submission to the PMU.  
GENDER AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS 
130.  The project is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming. A gender equity and social 
inclusion action plan (GESIAP) has been prepared. Gender measures include (i) empowerment 
of  women  within  their  households  and  communities;  (ii)  separate  meetings  for  women  during 
community  investment  prioritization;  (iii)  positively  biasing  women’s  development  priorities; 
57 
(iv) targets  for  women’s  participation  in  committees,  meetings,  training  and  construction; 
(v) financial  literacy,  group  management  and  entrepreneurship  training;  (vi)  equal  pay  for  men 
and women for equal work; and (vii) training for all participating communities and implementing 
agencies in gender and development. The project will pilot the household methodologies (HHM) 
approach to women’s empowerment in their households in 3,000 households. The Union PMU 
will incorporate gender action plan monitoring in quarterly progress reports to government and 
ADB. Key gender output targets include, but not limited to: (i) at least 50% women’s participation 
in  VDSCs  and  VTDSCs;  (ii)  at  least  40%  of  unskilled  paid  works  for  women  in  community 
infrastructure construction; (iii) at  40% of operation and maintenance jobs for women; and (iv) 
45%  of  livelihood  investments  beneficiaries  are  women.  A  GESIAP  in  Table  21,  comprising 
gender  actions,  performance  indicators  and  targets  to  promote  women’s  voice  and  active 
participation in project activities, has been prepared.

h   Currently, DRD does not have any institutionalized gender and development training curricula. This knowledge sits with project technical staff, not the embryonic 
training team. 
i   At present DRD employs 198 staff in the project townships. This will rise to about 300 staff under the RCDP. In addition, approximately 30 RCDP supporting staff 
per township, from, inter alia, the township various departments of the Ministry Agriculture and Rural Development, Department for Border Affairs, Department for 
Road Construction, Township Planning and Implementation Committee, etc. will be trained in gender and development.

Monitoring  
132.  Project performance monitoring. To monitor the progress of the project in achieving the 
planned outcome and outputs, DRD will establish and maintain a M&E/management information 
system  (MIS).  The  M&E/MIS  will  cover,  inter  alia,  (i)  project  physical  and  financial  progress; 
(ii) environment  and  social  safeguards  and  GESIAP;  compliance  with  loan  covenants  (policy, 
financial,  economic,  sector,  and  others);  and  (iii)  the  time-bound  financial  management  action 
plan. Additional information required to inform the project MIS will also be collected. It shall be 
implemented  by  the  PMU  with  support  from  the  MIC  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  Project 
63 
Performance Monitoring System Handbook.18 The M&E/MIS and M&E procedures, performance 
indicators, and their targets will be reviewed and approved by ADB. 
133.  Disaggregated baseline data for output indicators will be updated by DRD and reported 
quarterly through quarterly project progress reports and prior to each ADB review mission. These 
quarterly  progress  reports  will  provide  information  necessary  to  update  ADB’s  project 
performance management system (PPMS). At the start of project implementation, the PMU will 
develop  an  integrated  M&E/MIS  procedures to generate  data systematically  on the  inputs  and 
outputs, as well as the indicators to be used to measure the project’s outcome taking into account 
the project scope. 
134.  The  PMU  will  be  responsible  for monitoring  and reporting  on  project  performance. The 
basis for project performance monitoring will be the DMF, which identifies performance targets 
for the impact, outcome, and outputs of the project. The PMU will collect the data, calculate the 
indicators, analyze the results, and prepare a brief report describing the extent to which the project 
is  generating  the  intended  outputs  and  outcomes.  The  PMU  will  (i) establish  the  M&E/MIS 
framework  at  the  start  of  project  implementation;  (ii) confirm  that  targets  are  achievable; 
(iii) develop  recording, monitoring,  and reporting arrangements;  and  (iv) establish systems  and 
procedures no later than 6 months after loan effectiveness.  
135.  Compliance  monitoring.  The  PMU  will  monitor  and  ensure  project  compliance  with 
policy,  legal,  financial,  economic,  social,  environmental,  and  other  loan  covenants.  All  non-
compliance issues, if any, will be reported and remedial actions monitored in quarterly progress 
reports. Each ADB review mission, at least twice a year, will also monitor the status of compliance 
with  the  loan  assurances,  raise  any  noncompliance  issues  with the  government  and  agree  on 
remedial actions. 
136.  Safeguards monitoring. The quarterly and annual progress reports in the M&E/MIS will 
cover  implementation  of  social  and  environmental  safeguards  included  in  their  respective 
framework/plans,  including  any  compliance  issues.  In  addition,  the  periodic  QAR  reports  will 
assess the quality  and compliance with  O&M  specifications  in the  infrastructure  and  livelihood 
projects.  
137.  Environmental  and  Social  Safeguard  Monitoring  and  Reporting.    A  semi-annual 
environmental  and  social  safeguards’  monitoring  report  will  be  prepared  by  the  PMU  and 
submitted to the Environmental Conservation Department of Ministry of Natural Resources and 
Environmental Conservation and ADB. ADB will disclose the environmental and social safeguards 
monitoring report on the ADB website. Table below indicates the reporting requirements.

138.  Gender and social dimensions monitoring. The quarterly and annual progress reports 
in the M&E/MIS will assess performance of gender and social dimension indicators in the DMF 
and activity targets in the GESIAP. Project monitoring will track gender-disaggregated indicators 
throughout  RCDP  implementation  and  participation  in  all  village  development  events,  capacity 
building  and  technical  training  events  and  community  and  committee  meetings,  at  both  the 
implementing  agency  and  community  level.  Participatory  monitoring  of  project  impact  will  be 
implemented at the mid-term of the project and this will include interviews with women’s focus 
groups,  and  project  gender  focal  points  and  community  facilitators.  Household  interviews  will 
include adequate representation of female-headed households. In addition, the outcome survey 
(baseline,  mid-term,  end-line)  reports  will  include  analysis  of  household  and  community  level 
responses to gender and social dimension question. 
139.  DRD  will  engage  an  international  and  national  monitoring  and  evaluation  specialists, 
international  and  national  social  safeguards  consultants  and  international  and  national  social 
development and gender consultants. 
C. 
Evaluation 
Inception mission. An inception mission will be conducted within three months of loan 
140. 
signing to assess project readiness and implementation arrangements including establishment of 
PMU, opening of an advance account, status of the development of the M&E/MIS (PPMS), and 
progress  of  advance  procurement  actions  including  recruitment  of  the  project  implementation 
support consultants. 
141.  Review mission. ADB will conduct regular (i.e. at least twice per year) reviews throughout 
project  implementation  to  (i)  assess  the  progress  of  project  activities  and  outputs  and 
effectiveness of implementation arrangements, (ii) monitor safeguard compliance with ADB SPS 
(2009), (iii) review compliance with loan agreements and related matters, (iv) identify issues and 
constraints  affecting  implementation  and develop  a time-bound  action  plan for their resolution; 
(v) assess progress of actions agreed under the time-bound financial management action plan; 
and (vi) follow up on decisions and actions agreed during previous review missions. 
142.  Midterm review mission. A midterm review (MTR) mission will be undertaken jointly by 
the government and ADB in 2023, or as when deemed necessary by the project team. This review 
will include a comprehensive evaluation of project implementation arrangements, impact from the 
pro-poor  and gender  initiatives  linked  to  infrastructure  development,  detailed  evaluation  of  the 
local 
scope  and 
implementation  process  and  progress  of  subprojects,  allocation  by 
65 
administrations for the maintenance of the infrastructure developed under the project, feedback 
from  the  stakeholders,  performance  of  consultants,  capacity  building  progress,  and  possible 
reallocation  of  loan  proceeds.  Particular  attention  will  be  paid  to  the  (i)  assessment  of  project 
performance  and  achievement  against  targets  and  indicators  in  the  DMF;  (ii)  review  the  initial 
outcomes,  benefits,  and  impact  of  the  project;  and  (iii)  identify  gaps,  if  any,  and  recommend 
necessary  changes  to  strengthen  implementation  arrangements  or  modify  project  design.  The 
MTR will be informed by an independent MTR survey of project and non-project households and 
communities that will measure project and non-project induced changes in DMF indicators. 
143.  Project completion review mission: Within eight months of physical completion of the 
project, ADB will field a project completion review (PCR) mission. The mission will (i) assess the 
project performance against all targets, indicators, and benchmarks (including any revisions made 
at the midterm review); (ii) evaluate initial benefits and outcome of the project across outputs; and 
(iii) identify any incomplete activities and agree on the necessary actions, as well as to review 
compliance  with  ADB  requirements  and  loan  covenants.  The  PCR  will  be  informed  by  an 
independent  PCR  survey  of  project  and  non-project  households  and  communities  that  will 
measure project and non-project induced changes in DMF indicators. 
D. 
Reporting  
144.  The  executing  agency  will  provide  ADB  with  (i)  quarterly  progress  reports  in  a  format 
consistent  with  ADB's  project  performance  reporting  system;  (ii)  consolidated  annual  reports 
including  (a) progress  achieved  by  output  as  measured  through  the  indicator's  performance 
targets, (b) key implementation issues and solutions, (c) updated procurement plan, (d) updated 
implementation plan for the next 12 months, and (e) audited project financial statements together 
with  the  associated  auditor’s  report;  and  (iii)  a  project  completion  report  within  6  months  of 
physical  completion  of  the  project.  To  ensure  that  projects  will  continue  to  be  both  viable  and 
sustainable, audited project financial statement together with the associated auditor's report, will 
be adequately reviewed by MOALI and DRD and any findings will be followed up by DRD. 
E. 
Stakeholder Communication Strategy  
145.  A stakeholder communication strategy has been prepared (Appendix 2), drawing on best 
practices  outlined  in  ADB’s  Access  to  Information  Policy.19  It  is  based  on  principles  of 
transparency,  timeliness,  meaningful  participation,  and  inclusiveness.  It  will  ensure  that 
vulnerable groups, such  as the  poor  and female-headed  households,  ethnic  communities  who 
risk marginalization, are provided with opportunities to receive timely information, and can provide 
feedback during project implementation. Stakeholders include: (i) project beneficiaries in project 
areas  and  villages;  (ii)  civil  society  organizations,  private  organizations  and  service  providers 
collaborating to achieve project outcomes; (iii) women, ethnic groups, and persons affected by 
the  project;  (iv);  government  agencies  with  a  role  in  the  project  at  all  levels;  (v)  project 
implementers from the community to Union level; (vi) development partners; and (vii) the general 
public. 
146.  The stakeholder communication strategy pays particular attention to the following:  
(i) 
General  information  on  RCDP,  its  implementing  mechanism,  financing,  outputs 
and outcomes; 
19 ADB. 2018. Access to Information Policy. Manila.   
66 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
(v) 
(vi) 
Information  and  knowledge  on  RCDP  approaches  to  achieve  outcomes  and 
outputs,  including  the  community  development  approach,  climate  and  disaster 
resilience  building,  production  and  market  capacity  and  linkage  building,  and 
policy-related information;  
Information  on  beneficiaries  and  Interventions  to  reach  them  and  ensure  their 
benefits from the project, particularly the poor in the target villages, women and 
youth, ethnic groups and project-affected persons;  
Disclosure requirements on safeguards, procurement, grievance and such other 
disclosure requirements for ADB and partner-supported projects;  
Learning and knowledge sharing from project experience; and 
Communication and Visibility Manual for EU External Actions and JFPR Guidance 
note on visibility.  
ANTICORRUPTION POLICY 
147.  ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any violations of the 
Anticorruption  Policy  relating  to  the  project.20  All  contracts  financed  by  ADB  shall  include 
provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the 
executing agency and all project contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers. 
Individuals and/or entities on ADB’s anticorruption debarment list are ineligible to participate in 
ADB-financed activity and may not be awarded any contracts under the project.21 
148.  To support these efforts, relevant provisions are included in the loan and grant agreements 
and the bidding documents for the project. The project design and implementation arrangements 
provide  for mitigation  of corruption  risks.  Risks  associated  with project management,  including 
procurement and disbursement, will be mitigated by the engagement of the MIC to advise and 
assist in the procurement of goods and services, and the engagement of other consultants. The 
project  will  also  establish  a  website  in  which  it  will  disclose  implementation  progress,  bid 
notifications  and their  results,  and  provide  grievance  mechanism  against  any  corrupt  practice. 
References  on  ADB’s  Anticorruption  Policy  can  be  accessed  through  the  following  link: 
http://www.adb.org/integrity/. Guidelines on governance and anticorruption action plan are also 
available. 22 
ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISM 
149.  People who  are,  or may  in the future  be,  adversely  affected  by the  project  may  submit 
complaints  to  ADB’s  accountability  mechanism.  The  accountability  mechanism  provides  an 
independent forum and process whereby people adversely affected by ADB-assisted projects can 
voice,  and  seek  a  resolution  of  their  problems,  as  well  as  report  alleged  violations  of  ADB’s 
operational  policies  and  procedures.  Before  submitting  a  complaint  to  the  Accountability 
Mechanism, affected people should make an effort in good faith to solve their problems by working 
with  the  concerned  ADB  operations  department.  Only  after  doing  that,  and  if  they  are  still 
dissatisfied, should they approach the accountability mechanism.23

Appendix 3     103 
A. 
Overview 
COMMUNITY PROCUREMENT 
Community procurement refers to procurement led and managed by selected community 
1. 
volunteers. This  includes the  purchasing  of  construction  and  other materials, management  of 
the transportation of goods, contracting and supervision, and payment of wages. This procedure 
applies only for infrastructure subprojects, and not for livelihood grants. The Village Development 
Support  Committee  (VDSC),  and  the  members  of  the  Procurement  Sub-Committee  (PSC), 
should  not  start  subproject  implementation  prior  to  Training  of  Facilitators  (TOF)  and  the 
Community Management Trainings (CMT), to ensure that RCDP procurement requirements are 
understood by VDSC and the PSC, before procurement activities begin. 
B. 
Procurement Sub-Committee and its Responsibilities 
The PSC is made up of three members, including at least one woman. One committee 
2. 
member, who can read and write, should be appointed as record keeper. 
3. 
If a subproject covers more than one village, the number of sub-committee members may 
be increased, with equal representation from each village in the PSC. However, the PSC should 
have a single record-keeper only and only one procurement head. 
4. 
The responsibilities of the PSC are as follows: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
(v) 
(vi) 
Draft the procurement plan, taking into account the engineer’s estimates; 
Procure goods, skilled labor, and contractors; 
Using  quotation  forms,  serve  and  receive  quotations  for  price  for  goods,  and 
evaluate and select the most responsive, evaluated price offered; 
Arrange agreement with suppliers and contractors; 
Assist  the  Finance  Sub-Committee  (FSC)  in  making  payments  to  suppliers  of 
goods, and contractors, according to the procurement plan; 
Record the procurement process: (a) file and secure all procurement documents; 
and (b) send  copies  to the  head  of  DRD township office  after  completing  each 
subproject,  with  assistance  of  the  Community  Facilitator  (CF)  and  Community 
Finance Officer (CFO); and 
(vii)  Record and file the meeting minutes related to procurement activities. 
C. 
Community Procurement Procedure Categories 
The  community  procurement  procedure  can  be  divided 
5. 
(i) Procurement of Civil Works; and (ii) Procurement of Goods. 
into 
two  categories: 
(i) 
(ii) 
For  civil  works,  communities  can  use  (i) community  force  account  (e.g.  using 
project funds to hire community members to provide labor); or (ii) contracting (e.g. 
using project funds to hire contractors to carry out works). 
For  the  procurement  of  contractors  as  well  as  of  goods,  communities  should 
generally  use  the  competition/shopping  method.  In  exceptional  circumstances, 
direct contracting or single source selection may also be used. 
D. 
6. 
Selection of Subproject Implementation Method 
After conducting the village and village tract level meeting to decide the subproject type 
104       Appendix 3 
and block grant allocation, CFs and Technical Facilitators (TFs) conduct a separate meeting with 
the  VDSC  to  decide  whether  to  implement  the  subproject  using  community  force  account, 
contracting, or a combination of the two.  Meeting participants must sign Procurement Form 1: 
Meeting Minutes for Procurement Method Selection (attached), which must be submitted to the 
DRD township engineer by the CF or TF, before the approval of the subproject.  
7. 
The Community Force Account (CFA) procedure means community management of 
the whole, or parts of subproject implementation. In CFA, the community takes responsibility for 
the successful completion of the sub-project, and the proper use of funds. CFs and TFs should 
encourage communities to use the CFA method as much as possible, to maximize community 
ownership and community learning and generate as many income-generating opportunities as 
possible from community labor. When deciding to use CFA, the DRD township engineer and TF 
must  assist  the  village  in  checking  if  construction  materials,  technical  skills,  and  labor  are 
adequate, and available in the community. The DRD township engineer and TFs must approve 
and sign Procurement Form 1, whenever the community chooses the CFA method. 
8. 
In  implementing  subprojects  using  the  CFA  method,  the  community  has  the  duty  of 
purchasing  and  collecting  construction  materials,  with  assistance  from  the  TF.  In  CFA,  the 
community must use the shopping method (see paragraph 18 below), to ensure transparency. 
Payment vouchers should be kept, and the PSC should work with the village and village tract 
FSC for the preparations for the financial audit. 
9. 
In  the  implementation  of  CFA  method,  the  PSC  must  complete  Procurement  Form 7: 
Force  Account  Expenditure,  to  monitor  the  expenditure  of  goods  and  other  actual  expenses 
incurred, after finishing the procurement activities. Since the budget included in the Procurement 
Plan  (see  Procurement  Form 2:  Subproject  Procurement  Plan,  attached)  is  estimated,  it  will 
usually differ from the actual expenditure. The Procurement Form 7 is essential for tracking the 
use of subproject funds, and to see whether cost overrun, or cost underrun is incurred. In the 
event of cost underrun, the TF should assist the VDSC in assessing the remaining works and its 
corresponding  cost  value.  Additional  scope  of  works  can  be  recommended,  to  enhance  the 
functionality of the subproject. 
10. 
Contracting  means  that  subproject  implementation  is  done  by  hiring  an  outside 
contractor for a fee, to implement the whole, or part of a subproject. The term “contractor” means 
an  individual,  company,  or  an  organized  group  of  skilled  laborers,  such  as  carpenters  and 
masons. Contractors can also choose to employ villagers, where appropriate. The PSC, with the 
assistance of the TF, decides on this procurement method by comparing the lump sum cost of 
a  small-scale  contractor  or  group  of  skilled  laborers,  and  the  daily  wages  of  labor.  If  the 
community is not capable of full or partial implementation of subproject construction, the PSC 
may  use  this  method.  The  details  about  the  selection  of  the  contracting  option,  with  cost 
estimates provided by the DRD Township engineer and TF, must be indicated in Procurement 
Form 1: Meeting Minutes for Procurement Method Selection. 
11. 
For transparency in contracting, the PSC must use the competition system for selection 
of contractors, with at least three candidate groups/suppliers. The competition system can be 
waived, however, if; (i) there are no candidates for contracting, and; (ii) the proposed price does 
not exceed the engineer’s estimate or local market price. In this case, the PSC can choose one 
or  more  contractors  with  the  appropriate  budget,  without  using  the  competition  system.  The 
reasons  for  using  contracting  method  without  competition  should  be  explained  clearly  in 
Procurement Form 1: Meeting Minutes for Procurement Method Selection. 
12. 
To  procure  the  qualified  contractor  and  skilled  groups,  the  PSC  advertises  using 
Procurement Form 3: Invitation for Quotation (attached). The PSC can also inform the respective 
Appendix 3     105 
contractor or groups. Potential contractors should be given a deadline of at least one week to 
prepare and submit proposals. The PSC receives all proposals, which should be evaluated by 
consensus,  using  Procurement  Form 4:  Quotation  Evaluation  Report  (attached).  Criteria  for 
selection of contractor or skilled labor should include, but may not be limited to, the following: 
relevant works, experiences of similar type of subproject, trustworthiness, and technical skills. 
13. 
After the evaluation, the PSC must prepare the terms and conditions of the contract. With 
guidance from the TF and based on the type of subproject, the PSC shall inform the winning 
contractor, negotiate the terms and conditions of the agreement (including scope and nature of 
the work), and sign a contract. The scope of works and quantities agreed in the final contract 
should not exceed the engineer’s estimates. If the contract exceeds the estimates, the PSC must 
inform the DRD township office, via the TF, and request approval from the DRD RCDP township 
engineer. 
E. 
The Procurement Plan 
The  DRD  township  engineers  and  TFs  should  prepare  the  design,  and  calculate  the 
14. 
detailed  cost  estimates,  based  on  the  implementation  method  selected  and  recorded  in  the 
meeting minutes (Procurement Form 1), and request approval from the Township Planning and 
Implementation Committee (TPIC). Upon approval, the Village PSC draws up the procurement 
plan, with the assistance of the TF and CF. The method to be used for purchasing the materials 
in the item list, and procurement of a contractor, should be consistent with decisions indicated 
in  Procurement  Form 1.  Procurement  activities  should  follow  the  guidelines  for  the  selected 
procurement method and should be conducted in a timely manner. 
15. 
The  Procurement  Plan  (PP)  (Procurement  Form 2:  Subproject  Procurement  Plan, 
attached) is prepared in advance for the procurement of goods, contractors, and skilled labor. 
Generally, the PP includes the type or category of needed skilled labor and goods, estimate of 
costs, possible commencement date, and procurement method. With inputs from Township DRD 
engineers, TFs, CFs, and LFs, particularly to estimate quantities, the PP should be drawn up in 
a timely way, to facilitate a smooth procurement process. The PP can be updated as needed, 
depending on the nature of the work, and the availability of construction materials. The PSC can 
reduce the frequency of revision of the PP by grouping similar goods. 
F. 
Contracts for Small Works 
In  the  case  of  contracts  for  small  works,  Procurement  Form 6:  Sample  Contract 
16. 
(Works)/Legal  Agreement  (attached)  shall  be  used.  Responsible  persons  of  both  parties  and 
their witness must sign the agreement. If additional information is required for inclusion in the 
agreement,  one  or  more  clauses  will  be  added  under  the  main  agreement,  or  attached  as  a 
separate sheet. 
17.  Members of the PSC or the evaluation team, or any of their relatives, are ineligible to 
compete in contracting. 
G. 
Shopping Method 
18. 
In subprojects using CFA, all construction materials included in the PP must be procured 
using the shopping method. Although this method requires a minimum of three quotation forms, 
the PSC should try to identify more than three suppliers, where possible. If there are only three 
quotations,  and  all  proposed  prices  are  higher  than  the  local  market  price  or  engineer’s 
estimates, “direct contracting for goods” method can be conditionally used. The reason for doing 
106       Appendix 3 
so, however, must be explained in detail in Procurement Form 4: Quotation Evaluation Report. 
The PSC should discuss the specification and quality of construction material with the TF, before 
conducting invitation for quotation.  
H. 
Invitation for Quotation 
19. 
Goods scheduled in the PP must be grouped by type, the period needed (i.e. availability 
requirement), and advertised for quotation two weeks in advance. The invitation for quotation, 
and associated procurement items, are specified in Procurement Form 3: Invitation for Quotation 
(attached).  The  procurement  item  specification  should  be  generic,  and  should  not  require  a 
brand  name,  model,  country  of  origin  or  other  specific  remarks  to  favor  a  specific  brand.  If  a 
brand/model is mentioned, it should be followed by the words “or equivalent”. This is posted on 
the village information board, and also sent to suppliers/markets. Inquiries regarding the price of 
goods can be made by direct visit to the intended suppliers, or by telephone. Recognizing the 
difficulty  of  obtaining  written  quotations  in  rural  areas,  there  are  three  permitted  options: 
(i) supplier fills in a quotation form and submits it (formal method), (ii) form is filled in by facilitator 
or  PSC  member  and  signed  by  the  supplier  if  possible,  if  not  recorded  by  facilitator  or  PSC 
member (assisted method), and  (iii) quote is obtained by telephone and the form filled by the 
facilitator or PSC member (not preferred, but permitted method). The quotation form should state 
required item name, quantity, contact person, place, and deadline of submission (closing date), 
etc.  Deadline for submission should be at least one week after the advertising date. 
20. 
Any  interested  party  should  provide  a  price  offer  for  each  item,  and  the  total  cost,  in 
Procurement  Form 3,  and  submit  it  to  the  contact  person  not  later  than  the  deadline  of 
submission  specified  in  the  invitation  form.  The  PSC  must  inform  the  supplier  in  advance 
regarding the fixed price period (i.e. it is fixed for a month or up to payment date). 
21.  Members of the PSC or evaluation team are not eligible to provide quotations. 
I. 
Quotation Evaluation 
22. 
At the time of the deadline, the PSC invites related committees, suppliers and interested 
parties. The submitted quotations are opened, evaluation and cost comparison are undertaken, 
and the winning proposal is selected in the presence of all parties. In general, the proposal with 
the lowest quoted price is selected. However, if the quality of goods or other services does not 
match the requirements, another proposal could be selected. 
23. 
If the individual price of each item does not add up to the total price, selection should be 
based on the price of each item (refer to Annex 8 for example). The procurement record keeper 
must enter the list of proposals received in order of price, starting with the lowest price, in the 
Quotation  Evaluation  Report  (Procurement  Form 4).  Discussion  points  and  agreements  of 
participants should  be  included  in  the  minutes of  the meeting.  If  the PSC  did not  choose  the 
lowest  priced  proposal,  the  reason  for  such  should  be  given  in  Quotation  Evaluation  Report 
(Procurement Form 4). Once selected, the winning supplier’s prices cannot be renegotiated or 
revised. 
J. 
Purchase Order (PO) 
After  selection  of  the  winning  quotation,  the  required  goods  are  listed  in  detail  in  the 
24. 
Purchase Order (PO). The following should be considered before sending the PO to the winning 
supplier: 
Appendix 3     107 
(i) 
The PSC can order the goods included in the quotation form or proposal; 
(ii)  Goods not included in the winning proposal cannot be included in the PO; 
(iii) 
(iv)  The price of goods in the PO must be the same as the proposal price and cannot 
The PSC must send the PO within the required date; 
(v) 
be revised; 
If the PSC wants to order the goods in a batch, it is based on price of each item for 
the required amount; 
(vi)  When the quantity and price of goods in a PO is approved, the PSC can receive a 
cash advance from the FSC if necessary, according to the PO’s value; and 
(vii)  Translation of the purchase order into ethnic language on Procurement Form 5 is 
permitted  to  permit  easy  understanding  by  local  ethnic  residents.  However,  the 
Myanmar language Procurement Form 5 is the legal instrument and must be signed 
and affixed with a stamp. PSC must post a copy of the purchase order with affixed 
stamps on the village information board.  
If any situation should arise that requires the PSC to revoke or cancel the PO (e.g. dispute 
25. 
between parties, late distribution by supplier, etc.), the PSC may send a letter to the supplier, 
through  CF  or  TF,  cancelling  the  PO.  In  the  case  where  additional  goods  of  similar  type  are 
required (Repeat Order), the PSC can make a direct purchase for up to 10% value of each item, 
or of the total cost, from the original winning supplier. In such cases, there is no need for another 
invitation of quotation, or advertisement. 
K. 
Disclosure and Transparency Arrangements 
26. 
Community  procurement  and  finance  activities  are  subject  to  the  RCDP  principles  of 
transparency and disclosure. The FSC and the PSC must post the following documents on the

The two parties (the Employer and the Contractor) now agree as follows: 
1. 
The Employer pledges to pay the Contractor the Contract Price, ............................. Kyat 
(in word ........................................................................................). This amount is for the 
full quantity of work shown on the drawings, including materials, transport to the site, labor, 
and profit. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
The  Contractor  pledges  to  construct  the  following  works:  ............................................. 
(insert brief description of works, for example " construction of 2 rooms - primary school, 
with blackboard, table and chairs in .................... village"), and to maintain these works in 
good condition for six months after the construction is complete. 
The  Contractor  will  start  to  implement  the  works  on  ......................................  and  shall 
complete  the  whole  of  the  works  not  later  than  ..............................  (Insert  Works 
Completion  Date  from  Contractor’s  Work  plan).  If  implementation  of  the  Contract  is 
delayed due to any circumstances or event, which could not have been foreseen by an 
experienced contractor, the Contractor must inform the Technical Facilitator immediately 
about  the  delay.  If  the  Technical  Facilitator  considers  that  an  extension  of  time  for  the 
Contract is justified, the Contractor must submit an amended Work Plan, agreed with the 
Technical Facilitator, for approval by the Employer. 
The  Contractor  is  responsible  to  maintain  the  works  in  good  condition  for  six  months, 
starting from the date of completion of construction, to be determined by the Employer. 
During this period, the Contractor is fully responsible to improve and repair any defect that 
appears due to quality of materials or workmanship, and any defect that appears because 
of normal use of the works. 
Appendix 3     119 
5. 
6. 
When the Contractor wishes to apply for payment he must submit a written Request for 
Payment to the Employer. The Employer will then ask the Technical Facilitator to prepare 
a contract progress report. This report will verify the quantity of work completed and will 
check  that  the  quality  of  the  materials  used,  and  the  quality  of  the  Contractor’s 
workmanship is in line with the Contract. The Technical Facilitator will also check that the 
construction  is  following  the  Drawings,  and  any  instructions  given  by  the  Technical 
Facilitator to the Contractor. The Technical Facilitator shall then either: 
(a) 
(b) 
Issue a Progress Report (or Completion Report) certifying that the conditions for 
release of the payment have been met, or; 
Issue  a  Progress  Report  detailing  further  work  that  must  be  done  to  meet  the 
conditions for release of the payment. 
On  receiving  a  Progress  Report  (or  Completion  Report)  from  the  Technical  Facilitator, 
indicating that the conditions for release of any payment have been met, the Employer will 
call a meeting with the Village Development Support Committee at the work site. If the 
Village Development Support Committee approves the report of the Technical Facilitator, 
the Employer will then issue a Payment Order.

Payments will only be made in Myanmar Kyat at …………................., on or after the due

Based on a comparison of the submitted quotations: 
1. 
2. 
The lowest price offered is Supplier C with 1,817,000 
Supplier A has all 10 items quoted, while Supplier B has no quotation for Item 9. Supplier 
C has no quotation for Items 2 and 9. 
The prices offered look competitive 
3. 
To decide on the winning quotation: 
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
5. 
6. 
Determine the cost variances for each quotation: 
(i) 
Supplier  A  minus  Supplier  B:  1,980,500  –  1,845,300  =  135,200;  remember 
Supplier B has no quotation for Item 9. 
Supplier  A  minus  Supplier  C:  1,980,500  –  1,817,000  =  163,500;  remember 
Supplier C has no quotation for Items 2 & 9. 
Supplier B minus Supplier C: 1,845,300 – 1,817,000 = 28,300; remember these 2 
suppliers did not have quotations for all required items. 
(ii) 
(iii) 
Try to add the price of Item 9  of Supplier A to the quotation of Supplier B:  1,845,300 + 
15,000 = 1,860,300 
Try to add the prices of Items 2 & 9 of Supplier A to the quotation of Supplier C: 1,817,000 
+ (30,000 + 15,000) = 1,862,000  
The results are the cost comparison that considers all the 10 Items needed. The following 
are the comparable costs: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
If the above quotations are within  the budget  estimates,  the PSC can  award  the PO to 
Supplier B in the amount of 1,845,300 and directly buy Item 9 to Supplier A at the cost of 
15,000. 
The process looks for the lowest cost offered. However, other criteria are still to be factored 
in the final decision such as the quality of the items. 
Supplier A = 1,980,500 (all 10 items) 
Supplier B = 1,860,000 (9 items plus the price of Item 9 from A)  
Supplier C = 1,862,000 (8 items plus the price of Item 2 & 9 from A)
