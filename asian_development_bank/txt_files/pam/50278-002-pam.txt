Project Administration Manual Purpose and Process 
The  project  administration  manual  (PAM)  describes  the  administrative  and  management  provisions 
required  to  implement  the  project  on  time,  within  budget,  and  in  accordance  with  the  policies  and 
procedures of the government and the Asian Development Bank (ADB). PAM includes references to all 
available templates and instructions either through linkages to relevant URLs or directly incorporated 
into the document. 
The  Ministry  of  Food,  Agriculture  and  Light  Industry  (MOFALI)  is  wholly  responsible  for  the 
implementation of the project, as agreed jointly between the grant recipient and ADB, and in accordance 
with  the  government’s  and  ADB’s  policies  and  procedures.  ADB  staff  is  tasked  with  supporting  the 
implementation including compliance by MOFALI with ADB’s policies and procedures. 
MOFALI  and  ADB  shall  agree  to  PAM  (this  document)  and  ensure  its  consistency  with  the  grant 
agreements. In the event of any discrepancy or contradiction between the  two, the provisions of the 
grant agreements shall prevail. 
1.  After ADB approval of the project's Grant Assistance Report (GAR) and Additional Financing Report, 
changes in  implementation  arrangements  are  subject  to agreement  and approval  based  on relevant 
government and ADB administrative procedures (including ADB’s Project Administration Instructions) 
and upon such approval they will be incorporated in PAM. 
A. 
Project Rationale 
I. 
PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
Unlike  livestock  herding  with  its  centuries-old  traditions,  vegetable  farming  remains  an 
1. 
underdeveloped sector in Mongolia despite good potential for cropping, particularly in the country’s 
central  growing  region,  spanning  Darkhan-Uul,  Selenge,  and  Tuv  aimags.  In  line  with  the 
Government  of  Mongolia’s  policy  to  diversify  the  economy  and  lessen  the  disproportionate 
dependence  on  livestock  and  (especially)  mining  characteristic  of  recent  years,  agriculture—
including smallholder vegetable farming—has become a priority. Within agriculture more broadly 
conceived, investments in vegetable farming, processing, and marketing are considered particularly 
promising in improving the well-being of Mongolia’s local communities. 
2. 
Gradually creating alternatives to collectivized agriculture of the socialist period, Mongolia 
has  made  strides  to  become  self-sufficient  in  cereal  and  potato  production;  but  until  now, 
vegetable  farming  has  received  less  attention  and  remains  undeveloped  and  inefficient.  This 
perpetuates  low  income  for  vegetable  farmers  and  high  reliance  on  imported  products,  both 
threatening national food security. On average, only about half of the country’s annual vegetable 
demand was met by domestic production from 2008 to 2016. No more than three items (cabbage, 
carrot, and turnip) account for close to 70% of overall area planted to vegetables.1 The demand 
for good quality locally grown fresh produce is on the rise as urbanization increases and better-
informed citizenry becomes more concerned about traditional reliance on meat as a diet staple 
and aware of the need to have a more balanced diet for better health.2 
Limited access to market and foregone income-generating opportunities. It is difficult 
3. 
for farmers to access markets with good terms, and they are often compromised at the hands of 
middlemen.  In  addition,  severe  climatic  conditions  and  short  Mongolian  summers  limit  the 
cropping season and add to the challenges faced by the sector as they result in marked seasonal 
variability of supply and prices. In the absence of adequate post-harvest and storage facilities, 
local producers cannot benefit from the higher off-season prices and a large share of domestic 
demand  is  filled  by  imports.  The  same  lack  of  storage  and  post-harvest  processing  leads  to 
significant waste of seasonal production surpluses. With more commercial experience and know-
how on post-harvesting value-added opportunities and marketing, smallholder farmers will have 
better access to markets, more negotiation power, and more secured income. 
4. 
Inefficient  agricultural  practices  and  low  capacity  to  respond  to  harsh  climate. 
Mongolia  has  not  traditionally  seen  much  crop  farming.  Farmers  lack  technical  expertise  on 
sustainable  farming  practices  as  well  as  relevant  tools  and  technologies  for  expanding  and 
sustaining  growing  patterns  and are considerably  unprepared  for  climate  change.  Additionally, 
about 80% of vegetable production is estimated to be performed manually—in a country that is 
not labor-abundant, this has severe implications. Lack of mechanization together with inefficient 
water  use  and  archaic  irrigation  practices  often  make  farming  financially  marginal  and 
uncompetitive with imports. Currently in project areas, the average farming household produces 
a small 7 tons of vegetables annually. With access to more consistent and good quality inputs, 
introduction  of  appropriate  tools,  and  increased  technical  knowledge  of  sustainable  climate-
resilient cropping practices, smallholder farmers will be able to increase yields and income.  
1  Other main vegetables produced in Mongolia include beetroot, cucumber, garlic, onion, and tomato.    
2  Mongolia  has one  of  the  world’s  highest  incidence  of cardiovascular disease,  which  is also  the country’s  leading 
cause of death. Its high incidence has been linked to lifestyle and (also) diet. This offers a convenient example of 
one of the project’s potential indirect benefits.  
2 
Small fragmented holdings and weak capacity. There are about 300 cooperatives and 
5. 
35,000  households  across  the  country  growing  vegetables  on  plots  of  up  to  100  hectares  (ha), 
totaling an area of about 7,200 ha. Typical, however, are fragmented smallholdings of up to 5 ha 
characterized by limited work force, low levels, and quality of inputs (agrochemicals, seeds, water, 
and others), and scant financial resources. Smallholder farming income is low; and opportunities 
are  curtailed,  not  only  because  of  continuous  application  of  poor  agricultural  practices  and 
inconsistent supply and quality of farming inputs; but also because of lack of collaboration among 
farming  households.  Opportunities  for  better  managed  collective  areas  for  farming,  increased 
livelihood security, and economies of scale can be achieved with more collaboration, organization, 
and shared capacity among the farmers. 
6. 
The  project  aims  to  overcome  some  of  the  handicaps  the  sector  currently  faces  and 
improve  livelihoods  for  households  involved  in  smallholder  vegetable  production.  This  will  be 
achieved  by  implementing  a  community  farming  model  anchored  in  a  more  efficient  use  of 
growers’ own resources, expanded access to agricultural inputs, support infrastructure and know-
how, and improvement of farm-to-market linkages. It will create 30 farming and seed-producing 
groups (community grower groups [CGGs]) organized into inclusive agriculture value chains in 
Bornuur, Orkhon, Ulaangom, and Yeruu soums. The sites have been selected based on suitability 
of areas for vegetable production, scope for applying a pro-poor participatory approach, existence 
of enabling policy environment, and proximity to main transport networks.3 
7. 
Strategic fit. On the back of its Sustainable Development Vision 2030, Program of Action 
2016–2020,  State  Policy  on  Food  and  Agriculture  and  Crop  Production  Law,  Mongolia  is 
committed  to  improving  vegetable  production.4  The  State  Policy  stresses  the  need  to  improve 
agricultural productivity through a value chain approach, climate change adaptation, and capacity 
building for farmers. Smallholder farming is to be one of the priorities. Local vegetable production 
is to meet 70% of domestic demand by 2020 and its totality by 2025 through, among other things, 
on-farm  mechanization,  greater  use  of  protection  culture  (greenhouses  and  plasticulture)  and 
introduction  of  water-saving  irrigation  techniques.  The  project  is  consistent  with  the  Asian 
Development  Bank’s  (ADB)  country  partnership  strategy  for  Mongolia,  2017–2020  and  the 
Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Light Industry’s (MOFALI) sector priorities.5 It converges with 
ADB’s Operational Plan for Agriculture and Natural Resources, 2015–2020 with its emphasis on 
sustainable natural resources management and climate resilience.6 The project will serve as a 
pilot for scaling up under a climate-smart agriculture loan programmed for 2019. It is proposed as 
a grant in ADB’s country operations business plan for Mongolia, 2017–2019.7 
Sector context. In recent years, Mongolian agriculture has seen its fortunes fluctuate. Its 
8. 
herding  component  shored  up  household  income  and  the  country’s  exports  and  became  a 
stabilizing force during periods of economic stagnation that typically saw a return to herding of 
some of urban in-migrants. The livestock subsector itself has been exposed to significant risks, 
climate-related (such as dzuds) and others (disease, lack of quality certification standards, and 
difficulties  of  re-establishing  viable  management  systems).  Cropping,  too,  has  struggled  with

branch of the National Plant Science and Agricultural Research Institute. 
4  Vision 2030 aims to increase the area of land served by new and efficient irrigation technologies to 65,000 hectares 
(ha)  by  2020  (100,000  ha  by  2025  and  120,000  ha  by  2030),  increase  farmland  fertility,  and  decrease  soil 
degradation.

creating viable successors to former state farms but, aided by development partners, succeeded 
in  increasing  the  country’s  self-sufficiency  in  crops  considered  to  be  of  strategic  importance 
(potato  and  wheat).  The  viability  of  more  specialized  forms  of  farming  has  also  been 
demonstrated. The boom in mineral export revenues up to 2013 temporarily removed the urgency 
to build on these advances and diversify the economy. In the aftermath of the commodity price 
collapse (post 2013) the potential of agriculture and its smallholder component to act both as an 
income-enhancing and risk reduction tool was finally given formal recognition. 
Lessons. The project draws on lessons from agriculture sector initiatives undertaken in 
9. 
Mongolia. First, while the need to reap economies of scale and benefits of shared learning are 
well  understood, there is  reluctance among  target  households to re-create formal  collectivized 
structures in vegetable production. This stems from past experience of socialist collectives which 
were  top-down,  imposed  on  all  and  very  large  scale.  Simpler,  more  pragmatic  groupings  of 
producers are preferred. Second, opportunities to increase farmers’ income can be found at both 
ends of the value chain, not only on farm (through bigger or more valuable crops) but along the 
way to final consumption (through improved availability, more convenient packaging etc.). Third, 
to  fully  benefit  from  the  value  chain  opportunities,  producers  need  to  be  exposed  to  both 
technological and commercial innovation. Fourth, women in rural Mongolia have often been in the 
forefront  of  income  diversification  activities  including  vegetable  production  and  female-headed 
households can be recruited for new initiatives in the subsector. Fifth, climate change increases 
the need to introduce innovations into the vegetable subsector. Best practices from previous ADB 
and donor projects in community-based natural resource management will be applied to ensure 
better outcomes of the approach being implemented under the pilot project.8

Technology  Fund (HLTF)  is  requested for the design, testing,  and  rolling  out  of  one  high-level 
technology  (HLT)  winter  greenhouse,  particularly  envisioned  to  be  utilized  for  (i)  consulting 
advisory for (a) a rapid assessment and technical viability study for a winter greenhouse model 
suitable for the weather in Mongolia; (b) design and implementation of a winter greenhouse; and 
(c)  a  brief  feasibility  study  for  future  scale-up  and  investment  and  project  development;  (ii) 
provision of required equipment and systems needed for piloting the winter greenhouse, including 
the HLT systems for irrigation, heating, ventilation, and waste management; and (iii) conduct of 
required  consultation  workshops and training for technology  and approaches  being  introduced 
and  piloted  within  the  project.9  Use  of  the  HLTF  for  the  subject  grant  presents  a  strong 
demonstration opportunity for replication in the country and region, in places with similar climate 
and has opportunities for scale-up (footnote 11).

or knowledge-sharing by facilitating collaboration among farming households. In principle, this will 
increase areas effectively managed and more quickly to introduce innovations. Under this output, 
(i) training will be conducted for farmers in target areas on how best to organize effective groups 
and  manage  collaboration.  Criteria  for  selection  of  beneficiary  farming  households  will  be 
specified; (ii) about 30 CGG will be formed10 in the four project sites, bringing together an average 
of  six  farmer  households  per  group;11  (iii)  an  inventory  and  ownership  of  existing  resources—
ranging from labor availability, machinery, equipment, know-how, storage, greenhouses, among 
others—will  be  established  and  rules  for  use,  maintenance,  and  cost-sharing  drawn  up  and 
agreed; and (iv) a community growers’ scheme will be established.12  
13. 
Community growers’ scheme. The project will support the creation and initial facilitation 
of a community growers’ scheme which will help CGGs with operations and maintenance (O&M) 
and expansion by covering cost for an amount specified in the budget. Contribution towards the 
scheme from the project will be phased during the four years of the project. The amount of project 
to community share and details on phasing out will be discussed by the project implementation unit 
(PIU)  in  consultation  with  communities  and  local  government  and  be  determined  during  project 
implementation; for example, the project funds will contribute 100% to  cover O&M and expansion 
in year 1, 50% in year 2 (with remaining 50% contribution from CGG member households), 25% in 
year  3  (with  remaining  75%  contribution  from  CGG  member  households),  and  0%  in  year  4 
(community will contribute 100%). Each CGG will submit a request on a case by case basis to the 
PIU  for  O&M  and  expansion  needs―the  PIU  will  determine  its  necessity  and  extend  support 
accordingly.  CGGs  will  receive  partial  support  from  the  project  and  will  provide  partial  financing 
themselves  (as  indicated  above  and  to  be  detailed  during  project  implementation).  Each  CGG 
member  (household  level)  will  be  required  to  contribute  towards  its  own  O&M  and  expansion 
requirements.  The  contribution  per  household  level  will  be  determined  during  early  project 
implementation  stages  with  consultations  with  the  community,  project  beneficiaries  and  local 
government.  The  project  will  help  communities  to  draft  rules  and  regulations  for  the  scheme, 
including withdrawal and disbursement procedures and amount of contribution by each member. 
The objective of the scheme is to support operation and maintenance of facilities and equipment 
provided by the project and to create seed capital for sustainable farming for project farmers by 
replacing  and/or  expanding  the  shared  resources.  After  the  end  of  the  project,  the  scheme  is 
expected to be maintained by the CGGs that remain intact post project implementation. The scheme 
is  being  proposed  as  a  long-term  sustainability  measure  for  project  activities  and  the  social 
mechanism of CGGs to continue beyond the project life. 
14. 
Output 2: Sustainable climate-resilient vegetable farming technology and practices 
applied. The collaboration-based model introduced under output 1 will be  put into practice. The 
project will provide a defined share of farm inputs including seeds, fertilizer and agrochemicals. On-
farm greenhouses of proven design and new models will be set up to widen the range of produce 
grown  and  extend  the  growing  season.  Appropriate  technology  for  “winter”  greenhouses  will  be 
piloted. Efficient water-saving methods will be introduced, and existing irrigation will be improved in 
10 Criteria for the formation of community growers groups are: (i) minimum of five households; (ii) women to account 
for at least 50% of group membership; (iii) commitment to share–under specified and understood conditions–farming 
assets  and  resources;  and  (iv)  all  households  are  considered  vulnerable  and  poor  with  limited  agriculture  land 
resources, having 1 ha or less of land.   
11 Eight groups per vegetable growing soum, and six seed growers’ groups in Ulaangom. The average of six households 
per group is based on extensive community consultations with farming households. 
12 The scheme will be partly subsidized through grant funds for the first couple of years. Funds will be used for O&M, 
and  for  the  establishment  of  more  greenhouses  or  procurement  of  farms  tools  as  required  by  CGGs.  During 
withdrawal processing, disbursement and fiduciary arrangements for the scheme will be agreed upon. For the time 
being, the money for this activity has been earmarked under contingencies. Once all arrangements are in place and 
acceptable to ADB, a variation will be requested to move the funds for the establishment of the scheme.  
5 
the Ulaangom project site through setting up greenhouse drip irrigation, small-scale on-farm water 
tanks  and  supply  equipment.  CGGs  will  be  trained  on  best  practices  in  sustainable  vegetable 
farming with a focus on water allocation and use, soil cultivation, planting, intercropping, organic 
fertilizer,  plant  health,  and  pest  control.  Training  on  greenhouse  farming  techniques  will  be 
conducted; gender-targeted skills training will be given to facilitate increased greenhouse farming 
amongst female members. Through this output, the project aims to improve efficiency and increase 
value for farmers along the value chain, focusing on production and harvesting. 
The additional financing will contribute for the effective achievement of the project’s impacts. 
15. 
Direct  beneficiaries  will  include  around  24  CGGs  (mostly  female-headed),  covering  over  500 
farmers. Indirect benefit will accrue to the wider community with a total population of 45,000 or more. 
The proposed technologies are expected to: 
(i) 
Improve productivity and quality. The proposed precision  winter greenhouse will 
help maximize the crop yields by applying optimal levels of water and fertilizer; and 
enable  the  production  of  higher  value  and  quality  vegetable  production  in  the 
controlled  environment.  In  comparison  to  traditional  greenhouses,  the  technologies 
will  substantially  improve  energy  and  water  use  efficiency,  using  renewable  energy 
source and precisely control water and energy based on real time monitoring system. 
(ii)  Address climate change adaptation, and resilience to disaster risks. By enabling 
crop  diversification  into  higher  value  cash  crops  and  climate-resilient  varieties  with 
varied maturities, the proposed HLT  activities and systems induce opportunities for 
climate change adaptation and higher and more stable income for poor farmers. It is 
also  expected  to  build  resilience  to  harsh  winters  that  limit  the  growing  season  by 
extending the growing season from 3 months to 8 months. 
(iii) 
Introduce  innovation  in  processes,  methods,  techniques,  and  the  use  of  new 
improved  equipment  and  materials  in  construction,  and  operations  and 
maintenance. Training on the HLT winter greenhouse operation best practices and 
climate-resilient  farming  will  be  provided  to  develop  a  sustainable  cultivation  and 
distribution system for greenhouse vegetable value chains. 
16. 
Output 3: Farmers’ access to markets improved. This output will strengthen vegetable 
sector  logistics,  promote  local  enterprise  development  and  farm-to-market  linkages  for 
smallholder farmers. Specifically, (i) a market and value chain study will be conducted; (ii) shared 
storage facilities will be set up; (iii) a food processing workshop will be set up in Orkhon to create 
livelihood  opportunities  for  women  CGG  members,  and  gender-targeted  training  in  food 
processing, packaging, and marketing will be given;13 (iv) vegetable quality assessment, grading, 
and  waste  disposal  information  will  be  disseminated;  (v)  small  selling-points  will  be  set  up  in 
Ulaanbaatar,  aimag  centers  and  on  the  Tuv-Ulaanbaatar  road;  (vi)  a  marketing  brand  will  be 
established;  and  (vii)  business  agreements  between  farmer  groups  and  buyers  will  be  piloted 
(including  private  sector).  Through  this  output,  the  project  will  aim  to  improve  efficiencies  and 
value for farmers along the value chain, focusing on post-harvesting and marketing. 
17. 
The  project’s  value-chain  activities—socially-inclusive,  environmentally-friendly,  and

Knowledge and Support Technical Assistance REG (50042): Strengthening Women's Resilience to Climate Change 
and Disaster Risk in Asia and the Pacific. The KSTA will fund sub-component under Output 3 for establishing the 
vegetable  processing  workshop,  equipping  the  workshop  with  relevant  tools  and  small-scale  machinery  and 
equipment, providing relevant skills training for women and a social and gender specialist. More details on piggy-
back funding support from KSTA REG (50042) are in Appendix 9.  
6 
financially-viable—are expected to add value for farmers along all stages of the vegetable farming 
cycle. Lessons from ADB’s agriculture and rural development project on agricultural value chains 
and inclusive business will be applied.14  
Project management. MOFALI will manage the project. In spite of a good experience in 
18. 
implementing  ADB-funded  or  ADB-administered  activities,  MOFALI  lacks  adequate  resources  to 
fully  implement  the  project.  The  grant  proceeds  will  be  used  to:  (i)  establish  the  administrative 
framework (PIU); and (ii) finance required grant implementation consultants and operational costs.

of its in-kind counterpart contribution given: (i) it is a Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction grant; (ii) project grant amount 
of $3 million with a large number of activities to be conducted over multiple project sites; and (iii) pro-poor project for 
improving livelihood of smallholder farming communities. The project will pay for duties on imported goods where 
required. All project implementation unit staff and national consultant salaries are inclusive of personal income taxes; 
they are responsible for fulfilling their Mongolian tax obligations. Salaries for international consultants and resource 
persons  who are  required  to pay  tax  on  their  income earned  in  Mongolia  are  inclusive of  relevant taxes,  i.e.  the 
project will pay the relevant tax; the treaties for the avoidance of double taxation will need to be checked to determine 
whether income taxes need to be paid by the international consultants or not.

Exceptional one-off approval from the Government of Japan for project vehicle and 
motorbikes. Cost estimates include the purchase of one car and four motorbikes for project use. 
There is strong justification for purchase of vehicles: (i) there are  four project sites across four 
different aimags; (ii) the project is employing a participatory community-based approach and most 
of  the  activities  will  be  conducted  in  the  soums  directly  with  the  farming  communities  and  will 
require supervision by PIU staff and consultants who will need easy and frequent access to the 
field; (iii) within the remote and physically logistically challenging topography of Mongolia, and a 
poor, and in many cases, underdeveloped road infrastructure, there is limited public transportation 
and hence a project vehicle will be necessary; and (iv) vehicle rental over 4 years will be more 
expensive than purchase. Upon project completion in an accordance with ADB guidelines, the 
project car will be handed over to MOFALI or one of the soum offices and the motorbikes to each 
of the four soum governors’ offices. Specific details will be determined at project completion along 
with adequate justification for ADB / JFPR.16

Administrative budget support. Administrative budget support of 3% of the total grant 
amount ($90,000), exclusive from the project grant, will be provided given the wide spread of the 
project (covering the full end to end value chain for an underexplored sector in Mongolia in four 
soums) which warrants additional resources beyond those provided by the regular administration 
budget. This budget will be financed from the JFPR administrative budget, not from the project 
grant. The administrative budget support will be used to (i) hire a staff consultant to provide overall

support to ADB as well as the government’s executing agency in project implementation, if and 
when  needed  and  deemed  necessary,  by  the  implementing  project  officer,  to  (a)  monitor  and 
evaluate activities  and  project  progress  beyond  the  regular  progress checks  conducted  by the 
ADB staff team and resources, (b) evaluate status and progress of the community grower groups’ 
farming action plans, (c) monitor the project’s outreach to the intended beneficiaries, (d) conduct 
periodical community level consultations; and (e) review performances of the project executing 
agency, PIU, and consultants to ensure intended outputs are delivered on time; (ii) knowledge 
product  development  and  dissemination,  including  a  written  impact  report,  multi-media  story

The special administrative budget support will be administered by ADB. The processing 
and implementing project officer will manage and track the utilization of the administration budget 
support and will provide the Partner Funds Division (SDPF) on a periodic basis (annual) an update 
of  its  utilization.  Any  deviation  from  the  proposed  expenditures  should  be  consulted  with  and

FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT 
A. 
Financial Management Assessment 
As  part  of  the  project  due  diligence,  a  financial  management  assessment  (FMA)  was 
30. 
carried out in accordance with the ADB’s Guidelines for the Financial Management and Analysis 
of  Projects,17  Financial  Due  Diligence:  A  Methodology  Note,18  and  Technical  Guidance  Note: 
Financial Management Assessment. MOFALI will be the executing agency. 
31. 
The initial FMA was conducted through working discussions held at the MOFALI office in 
Ulaanbaatar  in  February  2016,  attended  by  staff  of  MOFALI’s  Finance  Division.  ADB’s  FMA 
questionnaire was used as the basis for discussions. The FMA was updated during processing of 
additional  financing  in  November  2019.  The  scope  of  the  FMA  was  to  assess  the  financial 
management capacity of the executing agency. The assessment included a review of fund-flow 
arrangements,  staffing,  accounting  policies  and  procedures,  internal  and  external  auditing 
arrangements, reporting and monitoring, and financial information systems. 
32. 
The overall pre-mitigation financial management risk of the executing agency was rated 
as “moderate” (defined as “likely to occur, will have low impact if occurs”). The executing agency’s 
capacity to administer advance fund and statement of expenditures (SOE) procedures was also 
specifically concluded as moderate. This conclusion was based on the following: (i) the executing 
agency has moderate in-house financial capacity; and its Finance Division comprises five staff, 
three of whom are qualified in accounting or financial management; (ii) the Finance Division staff 
have experience in implementing donor-financed projects, including ADB projects; (ii) the PIU will 
contract  a  qualified  finance  specialist  with  ADB  project  experience  on  a  full-time  basis  for  the 
duration of the project; and (iv) given the small size and budget of the project, any errors could be 
quickly identified and corrected, with limited impact to project operations and viability. 
A ranking of “moderate” risk requires the preparation of an action plan for risk mitigation. 
33. 
The project will implement the following mitigation measures: (i) a qualified finance specialist and 
a procurement officer will remain recruited in the PIU to manage accounts and procurement; (ii) 
the PIU keeps using a computerized, professionally designed accounting software acceptable to 
ADB as the principal software used to keep project records, supported by maintenance of hard-
copy  ledgers  and  records;  (iii)  an  action  plan  for  risk  mitigation  has  been  prepared  and  is 
described in Table 8. During project implementation, this will be regularly reviewed and updated 
to ensure the project responds dynamically to risks; (iv) The Finance Division will provide financial 
guidance to the executing agency, working also with the project finance specialist; (v) ADB will 
provide  training  on  ADB  disbursement  to  relevant  project  staff;  and  (vi)  ADB  will  provide 
intermittent financial training, and mentorship to the executing agency as needed. Measures [ii] 
and [iii] are included in the terms of reference for the project finance specialist.

Disbursement 
Disbursement Arrangements for ADB  
The  JFPR  and  HLTF  grant  proceeds will  be  disbursed  in accordance  with ADB’s  Loan 
34. 
Disbursement  Handbook  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  detailed  arrangements 
agreed upon between the Government and ADB.19 
Project advance account and procedures. After grant effectiveness, MOF will establish 
35. 
two  advance  accounts,  one  for  the  current  JFPR  funded  project  and  one  for  the  additional 
financing  from  HLTF.  The  currency  of  the  advance  accounts  will  be  US  dollars.  The  advance 
accounts will be used exclusively for ADB’s share of eligible expenditures (i.e., the JFPR and the 
HLTF  grants)  and  according  to  the  financing  arrangements  described  in  this  document.  The 
advance  accounts  will  be  established  at  a  commercial  bank  endorsed  by  MOF.  MOF  is 
accountable  and  responsible  for  proper  use  of  advances  to  the  advance  accounts,  including 
advances to any sub-accounts. 
36. 
Requests by the executing agency for initial advance and subsequent replenishments of 
the advance accounts will be supported by withdrawal applications to ADB and will be based on 
the executing agency’s estimate of ADB’s share of eligible project expenditures for up to, and not 
exceeding, the next 6 months, supported by a 6-month activity plan and Estimate of Expenditure 
Sheet.20 Subsequent applications for account replenishment will be accompanied by a SOEs; or 
if  full  documentation  is  required,  a  Summary  Sheet,21  as  well  as  the  advance  account 
reconciliation statement.22 
37. 
The withdrawal application for the advance accounts will be prepared in the currency of 
the  advance  account  i.e.,  US  dollars.  Withdrawal  applications  will  be  co-signed  by  the  project 
director and MOF. The initial advance will be prepared by the project director.  
The  minimum  value  per  withdrawal  application  is  set  stipulated  in  ADB’s  Loan 
38. 
Disbursement  Handbook.  Individual  payments  below  the  amount  should  be  paid  (i)  by  the 
executing agency and subsequently claimed to ADB through reimbursement, or (ii) through the 
advance  fund  procedure,  unless  otherwise  accepted  by  ADB.  The  borrower  should  ensure 
sufficient category and contract balances before requesting disbursements. Use of ADB’s Client 
Portal for Disbursements (CPD) system is encouraged for submission of withdrawal applications 
to ADB.23 
39. 
Project sub-accounts. Two sub-accounts for JFPR and two sub-accounts for HLTF will 
be  established  for  daily  project  administration  and  maintained  by  the  PIU  on  behalf  of  the 
executing  agency  (CPDPCD:  one  in  USD  and  one  in  Mongolian  togrog).  The  spread  of  grant 
proceeds in two currencies will help hedge against foreign exchange risks. The subaccounts will 
be used exclusively for ADB’s share of eligible expenditures of the project. Daily management of 
the subaccounts will be performed by the PIU to facilitate local project expenditures. Withdrawal 
requests from the  sub-accounts  will  be  prepared  by the  PIU  finance  specialist  and require co-

signing by the CPDPCD Director and PIU project coordinator. 
Statement of expenditure procedure.24 The SOE procedure will be used for liquidation 
40. 
of advances to the advance account and reimbursement of eligible expenditures. It will also apply 
for  individual  payments  not  exceeding  $10,000  to  ensure  speedy  project  implementation. 
Payments more than the SOE ceiling will be liquidated or replenished based on full supporting 
documentation of eligible expenditures when submitting the withdrawal application to ADB. During 
project implementation, ADB will assess the executing agency’s accounting and administrative 
capacity and feasibility to remove the ceiling for the SOE procedure and review and update the 
FMA, as needed. 
41. 
Signing authority. Before the submission of the first withdrawal applications, MOF should 
submit to ADB sufficient evidence of the authority of the person(s) who will sign the withdrawal 
applications on behalf of the government, together with the authenticated specimen signatures of 
each authorized person.  
Interest. Interest earned on the JFPR advance and/or sub-accounts, net of bank charges, 
42. 
can be used for the project, subject to ADB’s approval and within the approved total amount of 
the  grant  account.  Any unused interest  should be  returned to the  grant  account  maintained at 
ADB upon project completion and before closing of the grant account.  
43. 
Training for project staff. Online training for project staff on disbursement policies and 
procedures  is  available  at:  http://wpqr4.adb.org/disbursement_elearning.  Relevant  government 
officials of the executing agency and PIU staff are encouraged to make use of this training to help 
ensure efficient disbursement and fiduciary control. The schematic fund flow for the project is in 
the PAM section IV.G. 
44. 
Financial documentation and records. All supporting documents and records (including 
receipts for expenditures) for liquidating or replenishing the advance account, and transactions 
from  the  subaccounts,  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  or  retained  by  the  executing  agency,  in 
accordance  with  ADB’s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). 
Documents and records will be made readily available for review upon request by ADB e.g., on a 
sampling  basis,  and  for  independent  audit.  The  PIU  will  retain,  file,  and  manage  all 
documentation,  and  provide  duplicate  copies  of  all  financial  statements  and  audit  records  to 
MOFALI and MOF.  
2. 
Disbursement Arrangements for Counterpart Fund 
45. 
The Government of Mongolia (GOM), including the executing agency, will provide in-kind 
support in the form of value added tax exemption and office space for the PIU. These costs will 
be included in the annual budgets of MOFALI and relevant GOM agencies. 
C. 
Accounting 
46.  MOFALI will maintain, or cause to be maintained, separate books and records by funding 
source  for  all  expenditures  incurred  on  the  project  by  adopting  the  International  Public  Sector 
Accounting Standard for accrual-based accounting. The PIU, on behalf of the executing agency, 
will prepare consolidated project financial statements in accordance with GOM's accounting laws 
24 SOE forms are available in Appendix 7B, or 10B of ADB’s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from 
time to time).  
37 
and regulations which are consistent with international accounting principles and practices. 
D. 
Auditing and Public Disclosure  
47.  MOFALI will cause the detailed consolidated project financial statements to be audited in 
accordance  with  International  Standards  on  Auditing  by  an  independent  auditor  acceptable  to 
ADB. MOFALI will submit audited project financial statements together with the auditors’ opinion 
will be submitted in the English language to ADB within six months of the end of the fiscal year.  
48. 
The annual audit report for the project accounts and/or financial statements will include an 
audit  management  letter  and  auditor’s  opinions  which  cover  (i)  whether  the  project  financial 
statements present an accurate and fair view or are presented fairly, in all material respects, in 
accordance with the applicable financial reporting standards and/or framework; (ii) whether the 
grant proceeds were used only for the purposes of the project or not; and (iii) whether the borrower 
or  executing  agency  was  in  compliance  with  each  financial  covenant  contained  in  the  legal 
agreements  for  the  grant  project.  Expenditure  categorization  and  analysis  should  be 
representative of project activities and includes classification based on the categories in Table 5. 
49. 
Compliance with financial reporting and auditing requirements will be monitored by review 
missions and during normal program supervision, and followed up regularly with all concerned, 
including the external auditor.  
50.  MOFALI,  the  executing  agency,  has  been  made  aware  of  ADB’s  approach  to  delayed 
submission, and the requirements for satisfactory and acceptable quality of the audited project 
financial  statements.25  ADB  reserves  the right to  require a  change  in  the auditor  (in a manner 
consistent with the constitution of the grant recipient), or for additional support to be provided to 
the  auditor,  if the  audits  required are  not conducted  in a  manner  satisfactory  to  ADB,  or  if  the 
audits are substantially delayed. ADB reserves the right to verify the project's financial accounts 
to  confirm  that  the  share  of  ADB’s  financing  is  used  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  policies  and 
procedures.  
51. 
Public  disclosure  of  the  project  financial  statements,  including  the  audit  report  on  the 
project financial statements, will be guided by ADB’s Access to Information Policy (2018).26 After 
review, ADB will disclose the project financial statements for the project and the opinion of the 
auditors on the financial statements within 14 calendar days of the date of their acceptance by 
posting them on ADB’s website. The audit management letter, additional auditor’s opinions, and 
audited entity financial statements will not be disclosed. 
25 ADB’s approach and procedures regarding delayed submission of audited project financial statements:  
(i)  When audited project financial statements are not received by the due date, ADB will write to the executing 
agency advising that (a) the audit documents are overdue; and (b) if they are not received within the next 6 
months, requests for new contract awards and disbursement such as new replenishment of advance accounts, 
processing of new reimbursement, and issuance of new commitment letters will not be processed. 
(ii)  When  audited  project  financial  statements  are  not  received  within  6  months  after  the  due  date,  ADB  will 
withhold processing of requests for new contract awards and disbursement such as new replenishment of 
advance accounts, processing of new reimbursement, and issuance of new commitment letters. ADB will (a) 
inform the executing agency of ADB’s actions; and (b) advise that the grant may be suspended if the audit 
documents are not received within the next 6 months. 
(iii)  When audited project financial statements  are not received within 12 months after the due date, ADB may 
suspend the grant.

VI. 
PROCUREMENT AND CONSULTING SERVICES 
A. 
Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing 
The  executing  agency  has  requested  advance  contracting  for  services  to  enable  early 
52. 
commencement  of  recruitment  of  consultants  and  PIU  staff.  All  advance  contracting  will  be 
undertaken  in  conformity  with  ADB’s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2015,  as  amended  from  time  to 
time).  The  advertisement,  shortlisting,  evaluation,  and  consultant  selection  committee 
recommendations under advance contracting will be subject to ADB prior approval. The government 
and the executing agency have been advised that approval of advance contracting does not commit 
ADB to financing the project. Retroactive financing will not be utilized under the project, unless GOM 
laws and procedures allow. 
B. 
Procurement of Goods, Works and Consulting Services  
53. 
The  PIU,  on  behalf  of  the  executing  agency,  will  be  responsible  for  procurement.  All 
procurement financed by the JFPR and the HLTF grants will be carried out in accordance with 
ADB’s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time) and Consulting Guidelines 
(2013, as amended from time to time). The selection and engagement of contractors for works, 
goods, and/or consulting services to be financed by the grant will be subject to ADB approval.  
54. 
National  competitive  bidding  (NCB)  procedures  will  be  used  for  civil  works  contracts 
estimated to cost over $100,000 equivalent and less than $5.0 million equivalent, and for goods 
and  services  supply  contracts  valued  at  over  $100,000  equivalent  and  less  than  $2.0  million 
equivalent. Shopping will be used for procurement of works and equipment estimated to cost less 
than $100,000 equivalent. 
55. 
Recruitment of consultants will be done through individual consultant selection, quality-
cost  based  selection  and  least-cost  selection.  The  relevant  sections  of  ADB’s  Anticorruption 
Policy (1998, as amended to date) will be included in all procurement documents and contracts. 
56. 
An 18-month procurement plan indicating threshold and review procedures, goods, works, 
and consulting service contract packages and NCB guidelines is in Section VI.C. The plan describes 
the  thresholds  and  review  procedures,  and  contract  packages  for  goods,  works,  and  consulting 
services. Any necessary modifications or clarifications to the recipient procurement procedures will 
be documented in the procurement plan.

VII. 
SAFEGUARDS 
78. 
Environment  (category  C).  The  project  is  categorized  as  C  for  environmental 
safeguards. Under ADB’s Safeguard Policy Statement (SPS, 2009), only activities likely to have 
minimal  or  no  adverse  environmental  impacts  will  be  implemented  under  the  project.  No 
environmental  assessment  report  is  required  for  category  C  projects,  although  environmental 
aspects  will  be  considered  as  part  of  the  standard  preparatory  activities  for  each  project 
component. An environmental management checklist will be developed to monitor and mitigate 
impacts from the civil works and facilities operations.  
79. 
Involuntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples  (category  C).  No  involuntary 
resettlement  or  land  acquisition  is  envisaged,  as  the  farming  activities  will  be  conducted  on 
existing farmlands owned by beneficiary households. There are no communities of distinct and 
vulnerable  indigenous  peoples  as  defined  under  ADB  SPS  living  in  the  project  soums,  as 
confirmed by due diligence and national census data. The additional financing will construct one 
greenhouse (about 30 meters by 30 meters); and it will be on unencumbered vacant state-owned 
land  in  the  current  project  area.  The  exact  location  will  be  determined  during  project 
implementation.  The  project  will  not  finance  any  activities  that  would  trigger  IR  impacts.  The 
current project and the additional financing does not trigger the SPS requirements on involuntary 
resettlement and indigenous peoples.  
80. 
Prohibited activities. Pursuant to ADB's SPS (2009), use of the ADB funds may not be 
applied  to the  activities described on the  ADB  Prohibited  Investment  Activities List  set forth at 
Appendix  5  of  the  SPS.27  All  project  activities  will  comply  with  applicable  national  laws  and 
regulations. 
VIII.  GENDER AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS 
Poverty and social impacts. A summary poverty reduction and social strategy has been

prepared for the project. The project is designed for livelihood improvement and poverty reduction 
and categorized as gender equity under ADB’s project gender classification system. The project 
will  strengthen the  capacity  of  CGGs  comprising  400  smallholder  farmers  and  seed  producers 
from 180 households, including at least of 50% group members being women and 100% from 
poor and vulnerable households.28 180 households will gain access to vegetable storage facilities 
and engage in greenhouse production. 36 households of seed producers will have better access 
to  water  for  irrigation.  144  farmers’  households  will  receive  specialized  training  related  to 
vegetable  production,  including  its  processing,  packaging,  and  marketing  aspects.  Through 
improved availability of affordable produce, knock-on learning and multiplier effects, the project 
will indirectly benefit the wider community in target soums, with a population of 45,000, of which 
approximately 50% are female. 
82. 
 The formulation of the project was preceded and accompanied by extensive consultations 
with local populations. These consultations provided a better understanding of the target  soums’ 
poverty  and  gender  profiles.  They  revealed  that  women  actively  participate  in  farming,  from 
cultivating  soil  to  harvesting  and  sorting  produce,  but  the  degree  of  this  participation  varies 
considerably from soum to soum. A gender action plan (GAP) has been prepared and is attached 
to this document. It comprises 14 actions with 26 indicators, of which 18 have quantitative indicators, 
with  targets  for  enabling  mainstreaming  of  women  in  agricultural  value-chains  and  increasing

livelihood opportunities for women in non-traditional sectors. The formation of farming groups under 
output  1  will  ensure  a  100%  representation  of  households  classified  as  poor  and  at  least  50% 
female. 
Participatory  approach.  Project  design  is  rooted  in  strong  participation  of  local 
83. 
households.  Opportunities  to  promote  participation  in  project  activities  were  identified  during 
consultations with the communities and local governments in the target project sites. The project’s 
phased approach allows for a comprehensive and inclusive consultation early in implementation. 
This bottom-up approach minimizes possible sense of exclusion by some in the community and 
motivates  the  target  households.  The  creation  and  functioning  of  CGGs  puts  the  groups  and 
households  themselves  in  charge  of  decision-making  while  providing  for  a  degree  of  shared 
oversight  as  some  decisions  are  taken  on  behalf  of  the  entire  CGGs  rather  than  individual 
households.  
84. 
Gender. The project is classified “gender equity” under ADB’s project gender classification 
system. A GAP was prepared. Project activities are designed to be participatory and inclusive and 
will  support  the  involvement  of  poor  and  women-headed  households.  Women  already  play  an 
important role in vegetable production and sales and the success of some project activities will 
depend  on  strong  support  from  women  in  the  target  soums.  The  GAP  sets  targets  for  project 
participation, empowerment, and capacity building for women. 
85. 
The GAP (see Table 10 below) comprises 14 actions with 26 indicators, of which 18 have 
quantitative  targets  (see  table  below),  with  targets  for  enabling  mainstreaming  of  women  in 
agricultural  value-chains  and  increasing  livelihood  opportunities  for  women  in  non-traditional 
sectors. The formation of farming groups under output 1 will ensure 50% female representation.

Monitoring  
Project performance monitoring. A project performance monitoring system (PPMS) will

be established for the project.29 The design and monitoring framework (DMF) forms the basis for 
monitoring  the  project  progress.  During  project  implementation,  the  PPMS,  through  project 
performance  report,  will  monitor  the  likelihood  that  key  milestone  dates  for  activities,  outputs, 
outcome, and impact will be achieved. The project’s impact, fully assessed 5 years after project 
completion, will be anticipated during project implementation through monitoring assumptions and 
risks.  The  DMF  will  be  reviewed  during  the  project  implementation  and if  needed,  adjusted  to

default.asp?p=evaltool. ADB’s project performance management system (PPMS) is a coherent and results-based 
approach  to  project  planning,  performance  monitoring,  and  evaluation  of  results.  The  PPMS  comprises  five 
components: (i) design and monitoring framework (DMF); (ii) project performance report (PPR); (iii) grant recipient’s 
monitoring and evaluation (at the central and executing and implementing agencies levels); (iv) project completion 
report  (PCR);  and  (v)  project  performance  evaluation  report  (PPER),  and  where  appropriate,  impact  evaluation 
studies. The DMF provides the basis upon which the PPMS operates. It does this by establishing quantified, time-
bound targets and measurable indicators, and by identifying key risks and assumptions that are used to monitor and 
evaluate performance in the PPR, PCR, and PPER.

assessment  of  the  outcome  along  with  recommendations  for  enhancing  and  sustaining  the 
outcome. A project completion report will also include a preliminary assessment of the impact. 
The project impact, outcome, outputs, and targets and indicators are presented the DMF.

The  PIU  will  monitor  project  implementation  as  well  as  feedback  from  the  executing 
agency,  project  steering  committee,  project  beneficiaries,  and  other  stakeholders.  ADB  will 
monitor five aspects of project performance i.e., technical, procurement, disbursement, financial 
management, and safeguards (social and environment), through the executing agency’s semi-
annual progress reports (prepared by the PIU and endorsed by the executing agency), day-to-
day communication with the PIU, and ADB review missions. 
The  PIU  will  prepare  and  submit  semi-annual  progress  reports.  These  will  include 
88. 
compliance monitoring with any conditions and covenants stipulated in the grant agreement; DMF 
activities  and  targets;  environmental  and  social  safeguards monitoring;  and  gender  and  social 
dimensions. 
89. 
Compliance monitoring. On behalf of the executing agency, PIU will monitor compliance 
with  covenants  stipulated  in  the  grant  agreements.  ADB  will  monitor  the  compliance  status 
through the executing agency’s semi-annual progress reports, day-to-day communication with the 
PIU, and ADB review missions; and take necessary remedial measures for any non-compliance. 
90. 
Environmental  safeguards  monitoring.  No  specific  environmental  safeguards  have 
been adopted for the project that is categorized as “C”. Nevertheless, during the preparations of 
the  project  activities  relevant  environmental  aspects  will  be  considered  and  monitored  during 
implementation, as needed. The PIU will monitor and report the observations as part of the project 
performance  monitoring  and  report  on  them  in  the  semi-annual  progress  reports.  The  PIU  will 
immediately inform the executing agency and ADB of any unanticipated environmental concerns. 
Corrective actions will be developed as needed, and agreed between the executing agency, PIU, 
affected persons, and any other relevant agencies. An environmental management checklist will 
be developed to monitor and mitigate impacts from the civil works and facilities operations. 
Social safeguards monitoring. The PIU will monitor project performance, including social 
91. 
safeguards as part of the project performance monitoring and report it in the semi-annual progress 
reports. The PIU will immediately inform the executing agency and ADB of any unanticipated social 
safeguard concerns. No involuntary resettlement impacts will occur due to the project.  
92. 
Gender and social dimensions monitoring. The PIU social and gender specialist will 
record sex-disaggregated data and information on the social, gender, and participatory aspects 
of  the  project  during  the  project  activities.  Monitoring  and  evaluation  of  the  GAP  will  be 
incorporated into the project reporting. The social and gender specialist will prepare a semi-annual 
report on GAP implementation and progress,  as part of the semi-annual progress reports, and 
will work closely with the project communities. 
C. 
Evaluation 
93. 
Project  performance  will  be  regularly monitored and  rated  through  ADB’s  e-Operations 
project implementation module. ADB’s overall grant implementation rating will be made based on 
five performance  indicators: technical,  procurement,  disbursement, financial  management,  and 
social and environmental safeguards (Section IX.B). Such rating will be updated semi-annually 
based on executing agency’s semi-annual progress reports and/or ADB review missions. Within 
62 
6 months of physical completion of the project, MOFALI (executing agency) will submit a grant 
project completion report to ADB.30 
94. 
ADB will conduct an inception mission when the grant becomes effective. ADB and the 
government will jointly field one to two project review missions a year. The missions will (i) review 
overall implementation of the project and update, in consultation with the executing agency, the 
project  implementation  schedule,  (ii)  examine  existing  and  potential  implementation  problems, 
and  find  out  measures  with  the  executing  agency  to  resolve  them,  (iii)  review  progress  in 
procurement and disbursement, (iv) review the grant recipient's compliance with grant covenants 
and, where there is any noncompliance or delay, discuss proposed remedial measures, and (v) 
assess the likelihood of attaining the project’s outcome. 
ADB  and  the  government  will  undertake  a midterm  review  at  the  beginning  of the  third 
95. 
year of project implementation, to assess implementation status and take appropriate measures—
including  modification  of  scope  and  implementation  arrangements,  and  reallocation  of  grant 
proceeds, as appropriate—to achieve the project’s outcomes and impact. 
96. 
A final ADB review mission will take place within 6 months after physical completion of the 
project. This mission will (i) assess project performance against targets and benchmarks including 
any  revision(s)  as  agreed  during  the  midterm  review,  (ii)  identify  any  incomplete  activities,  or 
unused project funds, and (iii) determine the project satisfactory rating. A project completion report 
will be prepared, in cooperation with the government. In case the project is selected as a sample 
of projects for project performance evaluation reporting, the project will be subject to more detailed 
performance evaluation and impact assessment about 3 or more years after completion. 
D. 
Reporting  
97. 
The  PIU,  on  behalf  of  the  executing  agency,  will  provide  ADB  with:  (i)  semi-annual 
progress  reports  in  a  format  consistent  with  ADB's  project  performance  reporting  system;  (ii) 
consolidated annual reports including (a) progress achieved by output as measured through the 
indicator's  performance  targets  against  the  baseline  data,  (b)  key  implementation  issues  and 
solutions; (iii) updated procurement plan; (iv) updated implementation plan for each 12 months; 
and  (v)  a  grant  project  completion  report  within  6  months  of  physical  completion  of  the  grant 
project.  The  completion  report  will  present  the  government’s  assessment  of  the  project’s 
effectiveness and will take account of findings of the ADB’s final review. To ensure that the project 
continues  to  be  viable  and  sustainable,  project  accounts  and  the  audited  project  financial 
statements, together with the associated auditor's report, should be adequately reviewed. 
98. 
The PIU shall include the results of implementing the GAP and summary poverty reduction 
and social strategy in the semi-annual reports to be submitted by the executing agency to ADB. 
99. 
Donor visibility. All project reports, training programs, seminars, workshops, materials, 
and equipment financed by the JFPR grant will clearly indicate the funding from the Government 
of Japan and display the JFPR and Japan Official Development Assistance logos.31 All project 
press  releases  issued  by  ADB  will  refer  to  the  financial  contribution  from  the  Government  of 
Japan. The GOM, including the executing agency, are requested to ensure that JFPR-financed 
activities are well covered by local print, electronic and social media, and that all related publicity

materials, official notices, reports and publications explicitly acknowledge Japan as the source of 
funding  received.  The executing  agency  and  PIU  will  collect  and maintain a database  of  high-
resolution photographs of the project activities, for use in project communication activities and for 
provision to the GOM, ADB, and Embassy of Japan in Mongolia, which may use them for public 
awareness and visibility purposes. 
100.  Dissemination of project results to the Government of Japan. The PIU will provide 
the executing agency and ADB with reporting materials on the project activities, including high 
resolution photos, testimonials from project recipients and implementers, publications, and other 
knowledge products. In turn, the ADB project team will provide this information to ADB’s Partner 
Funds  Division–Japan  team,  as  well  as  back-to-office  reports,  inception,  midterm  review,  and 
completion reports.32 Information and methods for donor visibility and coordination are described 
in Appendices 1 and 2. 
E. 
Stakeholder Communication Strategy  
101.  A stakeholder communication strategy has been prepared for the project (Appendix 3). By its 
design,  the  project  requires  and  benefits  from  stakeholder  participation  and  ownership.  The 
communication  strategy  prescribes  timely  and  inclusive  dissemination  of  project  progress  and  the 
opportunity for public feedback. The strategy focuses on three objectives: (i) effective communication 
with the project stakeholders to achieve informed and supportive engagement; (ii) project visibility in 
the media; and (iii) coordination and alignment of the project activities with other donor programs.  
102.  Public  disclosure  of  project  documents  and  activities  will  be  made  through  a  project 
website, to be established after project effectiveness, as well as other dissemination approaches.

105.  To support these efforts, relevant provisions are included in the Grant Agreements for the 
project. 
XI. 
ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISM 
106.  People  who  are,  or may  in the  future  be,  adversely  affected  by the  project  may  submit 
complaints  to  ADB’s  Accountability  Mechanism.  The  Accountability  Mechanism  provides  an 
independent forum and process whereby people adversely affected by ADB-assisted projects can 
voice,  and  seek  a  resolution  of  their  problems,  as  well  as  report  alleged  violations  of  ADB’s 
operational policies and procedures.  
107.  Before submitting a complaint to the Accountability Mechanism, affected people should 
make an effort in good faith to solve their problems by working with the concerned ADB operations 
department.  Only  after  doing  that,  and  if  they  are  still  dissatisfied,  should  they  approach  the 
Accountability Mechanism.

JAPAN FUND FOR POVERTY REDUCTION – GUIDANCE NOTE ON VISIBILITY OF JAPAN  
I.  
Introduction 
On  6  October  2009,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  Board  of  Directors  approved  the  Revised 
Operating  Framework  for  the  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  (JFPR),  thereby  combining 
Japan’s project grant and technical assistance support under one umbrella, and paving the way 
for  a  more  comprehensive  approach  to  the  use  of  these  funds  towards  addressing  poverty, 
building up human resources, and empowering institutions and communities in the region. Japan 
has  been  making  generous  contributions  for  technical  assistance  activities  through  the  Japan 
Special Fund, and for poverty reduction projects through JFPR, since their establishment in 1988 
and  2000,  respectively.  It  is  but  fitting  and  proper  that  these  contributions  should  be 
acknowledged, and the recipients and general public are informed of the source of the funding 
assistance both at the Fund level and at the level of the individual technical assistance (TA) and 
project grants. The purpose of this note is to provide guidance on measures to ensure that the 
contribution of Japan in supporting JFPR is widely recognized.  
II.  
Statement on Japanese Visibility 
The JFPR Policy Guidelines provide general guidance on Japan Visibility and Coordination with 
Local Embassy of Japan Officials. More specifically, task teams are encouraged to help promote 
the visibility and local awareness of JFPR in recipient countries through the following:  
(a)  
(b)  
(c)  
(d)  
(e) 
(g)  
Publications, training programs, seminars and workshops financed by JFPR grants 
should clearly indicate that the activities in question have received funding from 
the Government of Japan;  
The JFPR logo (see below) should be used in publications financed by the JFPR 
program, and in banners and any other materials used in seminars and training 
programs financed by JFPR grants;  
All press releases issued by ADB with respect to JFPR grants should refer to the 
financial contribution from the Government of Japan (GOJ);  
Recipients should be encouraged to ensure that JFPR-financed activities are well 
covered by local print and electronic media, and that all related publicity materials, 
official  notices,  reports  and  publications  explicitly  acknowledge  Japan  as  the 
source of funding received;  
Grant signing ceremonies in the field should be encouraged, with the Recipients 
being encouraged to include Japanese embassy officials and to invite local and 
international press to these ceremonies; and 
Civil works, project billboards/signages, vehicles, and equipment should carry the 
JFPR and Japan Official Development Assistance (ODA) (see below) logos.  
In  addition,  Partner  Funds  Division  (SDPF)  may  promote  visibility  of  JFPR  by:  (i)  informing 
Country Directors of the importance of signing ceremonies to Japanese officials and the public to 
ensure recognition and support for JFPR funding; and (ii) continuing widespread distribution of 
the  JFPR  Annual  Report,  inclusion  of  JFPR  information  in  relevant  ADB  documents,  and 
occasional information sessions for Japanese organizations. Below are examples of other ways 
to improve visibility.  
66 
Appendix 1 
III.  
The JFPR and Japan ODA Logos 
The JFPR and Japan ODA logos will be used on the JFPR website. All grant approval notifications 
will include this guidance note and a printout of the logos. Soft copies (a pdf version and an Adobe 
Illustrator  version)  may  be  downloaded  from  the  SDPF  website  for  use  by  the  ADB  and 
transmission to grant recipients. The ADB will make every effort to ensure that: (i) publications, 
training  programs, seminars,  workshops, financed  by  the  JFPR  grants clearly  indicate  that  the 
activities in question have received funding from the Government of Japan; (ii) all press releases 
issued  by  the  ADB  with  respect  to  the  JFPR  grants  refer  to  the  financial  contribution  of 
Government of Japan; and (iii) the logos are used in publications financed by the JFPR program, 
banners and any other materials used in seminars and training programs financed by the JFPR 
grants; as well as on civil works projects, vehicles, equipment, etc.  
IV.  
Local Publicity Opportunities 
In  addition  to  the  use  of  the  logos,  ADB  staff  are  urged  to  take  all  appropriate  measures  to 
encourage Recipients to ensure that JFPR-financed activities are well covered by local print and 
electronic media, and that all related publicity materials, official notices, reports and publications 
explicitly  acknowledge  Japan  as  the  source  of  funding  received.  Below  is  a  standard  text 
suggested for use by those who prepare publicity materials: "The grant which financed this (name 
of activity) was received under the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction which is financed by the 
Government of Japan."  
Many  ADB  Resident  Missions  periodically  publish  newsletters.  New  grant  approvals,  signing 
ceremonies, and major project activities should be publicized in these newsletters. Most country 
offices have External Relations staff. Project/TA teams are encouraged to consult with them on 
ways to increase the visibility of Japan regarding JFPR grants. Opportunities to publish articles 
on high visibility projects prepared with the JFPR TA and project grants should be explored and 
utilized.  Project/TA teams  are  advised  to  brief the Country  Directors  about  the  implementation 
status  of  JFPR  grants.  Such  information  will  help  the  Resident  Missions  highlight  Japan's 
contribution, where relevant, in their meetings and presentations in seminars and workshops.  
V.  
Ceremonial Events 
Country Directors, Division Directors, and the Project/TA Officers will receive notification of grant 
approvals and will be informed of the importance of signing ceremonies to Japanese officials and 
the public. At grant signing ceremonies and other publicity events, the ADB's country-based staff 
are expected to foster the attendance and participation of country-based officials of the Embassy 
of Japan in a manner that provides due recognition of their donor status. Grant recipients should 
take the lead in organizing such ceremonies, and whenever possible, Recipients should issue the 
formal  invitation  to  attend.  Such  ceremonial  events  should  also  be  alerted  to  the  media  and 
publicity outlets referred to above.  
VI.  
Participation of Japanese Entities in Implementation 
To promote GOJ’s continued support for JFPR, it is also important to generate visibility for the 
project  within  Japan.  SDPF  will  promote  the  visibility  of  the  JFPR  by:  (i)  informing  Office  and 
Department Heads of the importance of achieving high visibility in order to garner support for the 
JFPR  from  Japanese  officials  and  taxpayers;  (ii)  encouraging  TA  components  that  involve  or 
cooperate  with  Japanese  experts,  expertise,  financial  resources  and  technologies;  and  (iii) 
continuing widespread distribution of the JFPR Annual Report, inclusion of JFPR information in 
Appendix 1 
67 
relevant  ADB  documents,  and  occasional  information  sessions  on  JFPR  for  Japanese 
organizations. In terms of enhancing the visibility of Japan, it is highly recommended that ADB 
involve and cooperate with Japanese organizations, including NGOs, civil society organizations, 
aid agencies, particularly JBIC and JICA, private sector enterprises, or academic institutions.  
VII.   Visibility at ADB Headquarters 
Country-based ADB staff are requested to forward copies of all visibility material, such as press 
releases, newspaper and magazine articles, and photographs (including descriptive captions) to 
the  following  address:  Japan  Partnerships  Team,  SDPF,  Asian  Development  Bank,  6  ADB 
Avenue, Ortigas Center Mandaluyong City 1550 Philippines.

Appendix 2 
JAPAN FUND FOR POVERTY REDUCTION – GUIDANCE NOTE ON COORDINATION WITH 
THE EMBASSY OF JAPAN AND JICA 
I.  
Introduction 
The Final Report on the Review of Japanese Official Development Assistance (ODA) underscores 
the need for strategic and effective aid. One way to ensure alignment of Japan Fund for Poverty 
Reduction  (JFPR)  projects  and  technical  assistance  (TA)  with  Government  of  Japan’s  (GOJ) 
bilateral assistance strategy for a particular developing member country (DMC) is by bringing on 
board the comments and suggestions of the Embassy of Japan (EOJ). Thus, under JFPR, project 
officers are required to consult with the local EOJ about the project proposal before submitting 
the TA Summary and Report/Grant Summary and Report and Recommendation to the President 
(RRP) to Partner Funds Division (SDPF) for processing. This Guidance Note provides detailed 
instructions regarding coordination activities with the EOJ and Japan International Cooperation 
Agency (JICA).  
Embassy of Japan and the Japan International Cooperation Agency Contact 
II.  
Persons 
The names of EOJ and JICA contact persons and their contact details are listed in a table which 
is posted in the SDPF website. The list is provided to SDPF by Japan’s Ministry of Finance and 
is updated from time to time. It is important to confirm the details in the table before contacting 
EOJ.  
III.  
Role of the Resident Mission and the SDPF 
Communications with EOJ and JICA should be done with copy to the Resident Mission (RM) or 
the  relevant  Country  Officer  at  ADB  HQ  and  with  SDPF.  If  needed,  RM’s  assistance  may  be 
sought to arrange the meeting with EOJ and JICA.  
RM’s role is also crucial in arranging the Grant Agreement/TA letter signing event (section V) and 
in overall coordination/relationship management with EOJ and JICA.  
Consultation with Embassy of Japan and the Japan International Cooperation 
IV.  
Agency–Concept Stage  
A meeting with the EOJ and JICA contact person should be scheduled during the Fact-Finding 
Mission. During the meeting, the Grant or TA Summary, together with the Design and Monitoring 
Framework, must be explained to and discussed with the embassy officer.  
The Grant or TA Summary and the Design and Monitoring Framework should be submitted to 
EOJ and JICA at least five working days before the consultation to give EOJ time to review the 
document.  
Any comments made by EOJ and/or JICA should be reflected and a summary of the consultation 
should  be  included  in  the  final  TA  Summary  and  Report  (TSR)  or  Grant  Summary  and  RRP 
(GSR), as the case may be.  
The project officer should exert all efforts to meet with EOJ and JICA contact persons. However, 
if a meeting with EOJ and/or JICA is not possible, email exchange, telephonic discussion or any 
Appendix 2 
69 
other  form  of  inter-active  communication  may  be  used.  In  such  cases,  an  email  containing 
EOJ's/JICA’s comments on the proposal should be sought and reflected in the final proposal.  
In the case of Regional TAs, draft TSRs and DMFs should be sent by email to EOJ and JICA 
focal persons on no-objection basis.  
Coordination  Local  Embassy  of  Japan  and  the  Japan  International  Cooperation 
V.  
Agency–Upon Approval of the Proposal 
Once the proposal has been approved by ADB, the project officer should inform EOJ and JICA 
about  the  approval.  Project  officers  are  strongly  encouraged  to  stage  signing  ceremonies  or 
launching ceremonies for JFPR projects, etc., with the attendance of EOJ officials.  
In coordination with the RM, the project officer should inform EOJ as well as SDPF – which will 
alert  the  Japanese  authorities  in  Tokyo  –  at  least  10  working  days  in  advance  of  the  signing 
ceremony. The project officer should also draft news release in consultation with the Department 
of External Relations and coordinate arrangements for the RM to invite the local and international 
press to these ceremonies.  
Coordination  with  the  Local  Embassy  of  Japan  and  the  Japan  International 
VI.  
Cooperation Agency–During Project Implementation and Upon Project Completion 
From  time  to  time,  EOJ  and  JICA  should  be  informed  about  project  progress  and  milestones 
especially when major changes in scope and objectives are required. Throughout all phases of 
the project, from concept to completion, the project officers should answer inquiries from EOJ and 
JICA regarding the project and discuss where necessary. EOJ and JICA officials may also wish 
to join progress and completion review missions in order to see project results and to interact first-
hand with project recipients.  
Project officers are also required to share information on the outcomes and lessons from JFPR 
projects and TAs with EOJ and JICA in the field to enable both sides to explore and seek potential 
collaboration.

NOTES FOR IMPLEMENTING THE PROJECT 
Appendix 4 
73 
INTRODUCTION 
1. 
These notes identify key implementation-related aspects of the project. They are intended 
to reinforce the understanding by the executing agency, and project implementation unit (PIU) of 
the intent of the main elements of the project. The notes are organized by key activities under 
each  project  output  and  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with  the  project  design  and  monitoring 
framework (DMF), implementation schedule, budget, procurement plan, and consultant terms of 
reference (TOR). 
Output 1. Community grower groups established. 
A.   
Principles of Community Grower Groups 
2. 
The  PIU  should  apply  a  set  of  principles  in  establishing  CGGs.  These  should  apply  to 
training  project  soum  coordinators,  setting  up  CGG,  and  developing  community  group  action 
plans (CGAP). 
Principles for Training Project Soum Coordinators 
(i) 
The  PIU  should  provide  induction  training  that  includes  the  project  itself  (objectives, 
expected  results,  activities,  and  budget);  the  role  of  project  soum  coordinator,  and  key 
activities to be carried out by the project soum coordinators. 
(ii)  The  PIU  should  provide  training  in  facilitating  skills,  participatory,  and  adult  learning 
methods; working with CCGs, and conducting consultations with the local community. 
(iii)  The PIU should provide training in community farming principles and practices, including 
pooling  of  resources,  use  of  shared  resources  and  setting  up  a  community  growers’ 
scheme.    
Principles for Setting-up CGGs 
(i) 
Project  soum  coordinators  hold  consultations  in each  soum  on  the  project,  introduce the 
concept of CGGs, their potential advantages and operating principles. 
(ii)  Member of groups will be households, not individuals or companies. 
(iii)  Groups  must  consist  of  only  vegetable  growing  households  owning  plots  smaller  than  3 
hectares (ha). 
(iv)  Members should preferably have been involved in vegetable growing in previous 2 years. 
(v)  The CGGs can be formed in all baghs, including the soum center bagh. 
(vi)  Members within a group should preferably have adjacent plots. 
(vii)  Each group should include 5–10 households, depending on sizes of members’ plots. 
(viii)  Total number of CGGs in a soum should be no more than 10. 
(ix)  The  CGGs  need  to  register  with  the  soum  coordinators.  The  registration  should  provide 
information on:   
a)  a rationale for the CGGs, possible existence of other groups in the area (e.g. groups 
formed by other donor projects) and the expected relations between them and the CGG 
being registered. 
b)  The number of households involved, and their location. 
c)  The number of households in the group classified as poor 1and vulnerable according to 
the project definition of having 1 hectare or less of land.  
d)  The number of households in the group that are headed by women. 
1 Poor households in the project are classified as those having 1 or less than 1 ha of land.  
74 
Appendix 4 
(x) 
Inclusion of a CCG into the project will consider the following: 
a)  All  households  are  considered  vulnerable  and  poor  with  limited  agriculture  land 
resources, having 1 hectare or less of land.   
b)  The number of households headed by women. 
c)  The fit of the rationale provided with the project goals. 
(xi)  Project  soum  coordinators  will  present  recommendations  for  setting  up  CGGs  to  soum 
governor. 
Principles for Developing Community Group Action Plans 
(i) 
Plans should be developed by CGG members themselves, assisted by project, as needed. 
(ii)  Based on the project implementation plan, budget, PIU should estimate an average amount 
of funds that it can support each CGG for first 2 years of the project duration.  
(iii)  Given the amount of funds available, action plan for groups may need to be adjusted taking 
into account:  
a)  Current plot sizes of each household.  
b) 
c) 
d) 
Size of the plot each household intends to use for vegetable production during project 
duration. 
Types and quantities of existing pool of equipment, hand tools, and facilities (storage) 
that can be shared with other groups members. 
Types and quantities of equipment  and hand  tools  the  group  would  like to  procure 
with project support, in order of priority. 
e)  Current harvest (type, quantity) per ha. 
f) 
g) 
h)  Current revenue from vegetable growing. 
i) 
Amount of harvest per ha members expect each year during project duration. 
Types of vegetables to be planted in each plot, or segments of a plot. 
Expected revenue from vegetable growing each year during project duration. 
(iv)  Actions  in  each  action  plan  should  be  then  be  prioritized  to  make  them  compatible  with 
available budget. 
(v)  Project soum coordinators recommend to the PIU which planned activities the project can 
support.  The PIU decision is communicated to project soum coordinators, who inform the 
CGGs and then present the final CGAP to the soum governor for approval. 
(vi)  CGAPs are to be displayed graphically, for example in a calendar, showing which actions 
are expected to take place and when.  
(vii)  CGAPs are to initially cover 2 years. At the end of the second year, plans will be reviewed 
and  updated  for  the  next  2  years.  The  project  will  continue  its  support  to  groups  with 
satisfactory results and reward good results by considering the group for additional support.   
(viii)  Good examples of implementation of CGAPs are to be presented in the symposium. 
B. 
Key Training and Steps for Participatory Community Farming Planning for CGGs 
The PIU’s community development expert, and soum coordinators provide orientation to 
3. 
vegetable grower communities and soum administrations on collaborative farming, and potential 
advantages  of  CGGs.  If  the  rationale  of  CGGs  is  accepted  the  soum  coordinators  recruit  and 
register the CGGs, the soum coordinators train the CGGs on concepts of collaborative farming 
and developing the CGAPs.  
In summary, collaborative community farming⎯to be carried out by the CGGs⎯includes 
4. 
six steps, which the soum coordinator will oversee for each of the registered CGGs:  
Appendix 4 
75 
Step 1.  
Introduce  concepts  of  community-based  farming  and  obtain  support  for  the 
collaborative approach. 
Step 2.   Position the CCGs to implement community-based farming. 
Step 3.   Establish an inventory of existing resources potentially available to CGGs and 
specify the rules that are to govern the use of these resources. 
Step 4.   Develop the community farming action plans. 
Step 5. 
Step 6.   Participatory monitoring and evaluation. 
Implement the community farming action plans. 
After Step 4, the revised and finalized CGAPs are submitted to the soum administrations 
5. 
for approval. The soum coordinators with the backing of the project should provide support to the 
CGGs in implementing the CGAPs, (Step 5) and in monitoring the implementation of the CGAPs 
(Step 6). 
C.  
Example of An Input Table for the CGAP 
Following is an example of an input table for a CGAP that a CGG in Yeruu soum could 
6. 
prepare.  (CGAPs  by  CGGs  in  Bornuur,  Orkhon,  and  Ulaangom  soums  could  include  different 
actions) After the input table has been completed and approved by the soum administration (see 
principles above in Section A.3) the project could produce a graphical version of the plan, such 
as a wall calendar. 
The actual format for  both CGG input tables and the graphical version of the approved 
7. 
plan should be developed and finalized by the PIU during the first year of implementation.

Set  up  the  community  growers’  scheme  for  operation,  maintenance  and 
D. 
reinvestment 
8. 
After the CGGs are established, the project will support the creation and initial facilitation 
the  community  growers’ scheme  for  operation, maintenance and  expansion  by  contributing  an 
amount specified in the budget. Contribution to the fund from project funds will be phased during 
the  four  years  of  the  project;  for  example,  the  project  funds  will  contribute  a  100%  to  the 
community growers’ scheme in year 1, 50% in year 2 (with remaining 50% contribution from CGG 
member  households),  25%  in  year  3  (with  remaining  75%  contribution  from  CGG  member 
households), and 0% in year 4 (community will contribute 100%). Each CGG member (household 
level) will be required to contribute to the fund. The project will help communities to draft rules 
and regulations for the community growers’ scheme, including withdrawal procedures and amount 
of  contribution  by  each  member.  The  objective  of  the  fund  is  to  support  operation  and 
maintenance  of facilities and  equipment  provided  by the  project  and to create  seed capital for 
sustainable farming for project farmers by replacing and/or expanding the shared resources. 
Output  2.  Sustainable  Climate-Resilient  Vegetable  Farming  Technology  and  Practices 
Applied. 
A. 
Procurement of Infrastructure, Tools, Equipment for Community Grower Groups 
i.   
Procurement of Tractors, Equipment and Tools for Project Soums  
For  all  four  project  soums,  the  project  should  provide  each  soum  a  tractor  with  engine 
9. 
capacity  of  no  less  than  70  horse  power.  Tractors  from  producers  in  various  countries  are 
available; the project should consult with farmers to identify their preferences in terms of capacity 
and axle size. Availability of parts, fuel consumption, match with the tools that farmers already 
have or to acquire with project support, and dealership services should be considered. Suppliers 
may not have preferred tractors in stock in Mongolia, but they can import upon order. Therefore, 
lead  time  of  several  months  may  be  necessary.  The  initial  owners  of  the  tractor  will  be  soum 
administrations. Tractors will be shared among all CGGs in the soum under clear rules for sharing 
the running and maintenance cost. Soum coordinators will need to develop daily schedules for 
use  of  the  tractor.  PIU  shall  establish  an  agreement  with  soum  administration  on  the  use  of 
tractors restricting their use for project-related purposes only.  
In  all  four  project  soums,  the  project  will  provide  some  equipment  and  tools  (plough, 
10. 
harrow, cultivator, seeder, harvester, motoblock, and the like) to be shared among members of 
CGGs,  with  households  assigned  responsibility  for  their  maintenance  and  running  cost  of  the 
equipment. Procurement be made after registering and assessing existing equipment and tools 
that can be shared within the CGG. Sharing between CGGs should not be ruled out.    
11. 
PIU should only supply equipment and tools to CGSs that have specifically requested the 
equipment and tools in their approved action plan and have a rationale and actions for why they 
require the equipment and tools.  
ii.  
Set Up CGGs Greenhouses  
12. 
PIU shall manage the procurement of small-scale greenhouses to be shared among CCGs 
households  for  vegetable  growing  in  the  main  soums  and  for  seed  testing  and  improving  in 
Ulaangom soum. Several factors should be considered under this activity. 
Appendix 4 
81 
(i)  Location:  Land  for  greenhouse  should not  have  high  level  of  underground  water  to 
prevent salinization. Location with good exposure to sunlight and easy access by CGG 
households shall be preferred.  
(ii)  Shared use: Although sharing a greenhouse should be encouraged by the project, risk 
of  contamination  increases  with  the  number  of  people  that  are  allowed  in  the 
greenhouse.  This  factor  should  be  taken  into  account  in  deciding  how  many  small 
greenhouses to establish, and where.   
(iii)  Proliferation: Members who  received  project  support for  establishing  a  greenhouse 
should contribute a higher amount to the community growers’ scheme than those who 
have not yet benefitted. The size of such contribution should be clearly specified while 
the operating principles of CGGs are drafted.  
(iv)  Technology:  There  are  numerous  greenhouses  technologies  and  techniques  used 
around the world. The international agronomist and agri-business specialist, national 
agronomist, and national community development expert⎯will make recommendations 
on the most promising from among the existing options to be supported by the project.    
The project shall procure a large all-season greenhouse in one of the project soums in 
13. 
2019 to be operated by a CGG that has shown the greatest success in implementing its CGAP. 
There  are,  at  present,  few  proven  designs  and  technologies  for  all-season  greenhouses  in 
Mongolia (see the information sheet on greenhouses in the attachments to this document). The 
all-season greenhouse to be procured by the project will therefore be a pilot component designed 
to  test  existing  and  new  features  (e.g.  use  of  renewable  energy  for  heating)  of  greenhouse 
operations in Mongolian conditions climate.  Greenhouses shall be supplied only to CGGs that 
have  specifically  requested  them  in  their  action  plan,  and  provided  a  good  justification  for 
requesting this technology. 
iii.  
Provide Protective Clothes for Each CGG 
The project shall purchase and distribute protective clothing to be used by CGG members 
14. 
when applying pesticides using knapsack sprayers. It is assumed that each group will need one 
set of protective clothing.  
iv.  
Provide Agrochemicals to Each CGG 
15. 
The project shall procure agrochemicals (pesticides and fertilizers) to each CCGs in 2018 
and  2019.  It  is  expected  that  CGGs,  using the community  growers’ scheme resources,  will  be 
able  to  purchase  pesticides  and  fertilizers  without  project  support  from  2020  onwards.  Use  of 
agrochemicals should be based on soil quality tests and best farming practices in Mongolia, and 
require approval by the project agronomist.  
B.  
Support Seed Growing and Propagation in Ulaangom, Uvs 
i.  
Provide Support for Improving Water Access in Gashuunii Gol, Ulaangom 
The project shall support construction of a water well, and reticulation to improve access 
16. 
to water in seed growing fields in Gashuunii gol, Ulaangom soum. PIU should contract a firm that 
specializes in well installation.  
82 
Appendix 4 
ii.  
Provide Support for Improving Water Access in Chandmani, Ulaangom 
17. 
The project will procure an electricity line to three existing but unconnected-to-grid wells 
in Chandmani, Ulaangom. The wells are located on land owned by the Uvs Branch of the Institute 
of  Plant  and  Agriculture  Sciences  (IPAS).  The  construction  of  the  grid  connection  shall  be 
conditional on IPAS readiness to make at least 5 ha of its land available free of charge for CGGs 
for seed production for a period of at least 15 years or with nominal rent. A tri-patriate agreement 
to this effect should be signed by Uvs aimag Governor, IPAS and CGGs.  
C.  
Test Soil to Establish Baseline for Soil Quality 
The PIU should support testing of soil in 2018 in all four project soums to establish baseline 
18. 
soil quality. The laboratory to test the soil quality should be chosen in consultation with MOFALI. 
Quality of soil in Bornuur soum has already been tested in international laboratories with supports 
from JICA. Test results should be compared with this data. 
D.  
Provide Mother Seed, and Seed to All Groups 
For  all  four  project  soums,  PIU  should  organize  supply  of mother  seed  and seed to  all 
19. 
CGGs.  In  Ulaangom  soum,  Uvs  branch  of  IPAS  will  be  the  supplier  of  mother  seed  to  seed 
growing  CGGs.  In  the  first  years  of  project  implementation,  when  production  of  seed  is  not 
sufficient to meet demands in the three main soums, project shall support purchase of seed from 
Uvs branch of IPAS. It was agreed that MOFALI will serve as intermediary to obtain at-cost seed 
prices for project CGGs. If and when CGGs in Ulaangom produces enough seed to meet demands 
of farmers in the three main soums, project will support transportation of seed from Uvs to the 
three project soums. Purchase of seed from Ulaangom by CGGs should be on voluntary basis.  
E.  
Provide Training on Sustainable Farming  
The  PIU  should implement  training  program for 2018−2020  in all  four  project  soums  in 
20. 
sustainable  farming.  The  training  should  cover  topics  such  as  greenhouse  operations  efficient 
water use and water saving practices, crop rotation, seed selection, farming best practices and 
use of equipment. 
Output 3. Farmers Access to Markets Improved 
A.  
Provide Facilities Intended to Increase Farmers Access to Market

Set Up Shared Storage Facilities 
Shared  storage  facility  with  different  capacities  (150  tons  in  Orkhon  soum,  100 tons  in 
21. 
Yeruu soum and 60 tons in Ulaangom soum) will be constructed in 2019 with project support. No 
storage  facility  will  be  built  in  Bornuur  soum.  There  is  a  large  variety  of  storage  methods  in 
Mongolia starting from traditional below-ground storage to large, modern mechanized facilities. 
MOFALI’s  current  policy  does  not  support  repair  and  construction  of  traditional  below-ground 
storage. The PIU agronomist, community development expert, and soum coordinators will identify 
the type of storage facilities most appropriate for the needs of project CGGs.  
ii.  
Establish Vegetable Processing and Packaging Facility in Orkhon 
22. 
The  project  is  likely  to  support  construction  of  a  vegetable  processing  and  packaging 
facility (VPPF) in Orkhon soum in 2019. The justification, design, and equipment for the facility 
Appendix 4 
83 
will  be  described  in  a  proposal  prepared  by  a  resource  person  engaged  during  the  project 
preparation. In additional to the amount specified in the project budget, $100,000 will be financed 
from RETA funding to establish the VPPF. 
The owner of VPPF should be any one or more CGGs established with the project support, 
23. 
or their individual members. In order to efficiently use and manage the facility the owners may 
need  to  establish  an  organizational  structure  that  is  more  formal  than  CGGs  such  as  a 
cooperative,  or  a  limited  liability  company  with  multiple  members.  To  encourage  good 
performance, PIU may restrict the membership of the formal structure only to CGG members who 
are satisfactorily implementing their CGAPs. The VPPF could purchase its inputs from any CGG 
or  individuals although  preference  should  be  given  to  produce  grown  by  VPPF  owners.  In  the 
event the available budget is insufficient to fund both construction of building for VPPF and the 
equipment. PIU shall consider the possibility of a long-term lease of a building in Orkhon soum, 
or an offer of co-ownership of VPPF to the owner of the existing building.   
iii.  
Rent a Shared, Mechanized Storage Facility 
24. 
The project will support renting of an appropriate storage facility near/in Ulaanbaatar City, 
to  be  shared  by  CGGs  from  all  three  main  project  soums  who  are  selling  their  produce  in 
Ulaanbaatar. MOFALI has recently stopped construction of new storage facilities in Ulaanbaatar 
preferring  instead  to make a more  efficient  use of these facilities including  renting  them  to  the 
project. If so, this option would be based on a tri-patriate agreement between MOFALI, the project 
and the storage manager. The project budget foresees renting of such a facility for 9−10 months 
a year for 3 years between 2019−2021 including the salaries of the warehouse staff.  
iv.  
Set Up Kiosks in Ulaanbaatar City for Selling Products 
25. 
The main objective  of the kiosks  is to  increase the  share  of the  final  price going  to the 
growers  rather  than accruing  to  existing  intermediaries.  Setting  up the  kiosks is  conditional  on 
Ulaanbaatar Municipality  granting  necessary  land  use  permit. MOFALI  has  agreed  to  assist  in 
seeking  such  an  authorization.  A  tri-patriate  agreement  among  MOFALI,  Ulaanbaatar  City 
administration  and the  project  specifying  rules for  use  land the  kiosks  would  be  required.  The 
kiosks are expected to be placed within or close to residential areas including gher areas, but not 
necessarily  in  the  city  center  where  access  to  land  is  severely  constrained.  Project  financing 
would  cover  all  activities  related  to  the  kiosks  including  design,  procurement  and  setting  up. 
Operational cost of the kiosks will be paid by CGGs selling their produce at the kiosk.  
v.  
Set Up Sale Points Along Main Roads Going to the East from Ulaanbaatar 
The project will support construction of a sale point along the road from eastern aimags to 
26. 
Ulaanbaatar to market the output of the project CGGs. MOFALI has agreed to assist in acquiring 
the necessary land. JICA is supporting construction of a sale point near Bornuur expected to be 
operational by 2018. Although this facility is much larger and complex than the sale point intended 
in this project, the project can draw on the experience of the Bornuur sale point. 
B.  
Support Farmer Groups in Participating National Vegetable Trade Fairs 
The  project  will  support  participation  of  CGGs  in  the  main  three  soums  at  national 
27. 
vegetable trade fairs twice a year in 2018−2021. The project will finance the cost of transportation 
of  vegetables to the fair,  promotional  display,  and  packaging  developed the  project’s  branding 
and marketing plan. 
84 
Appendix 4 
C.  
Develop and Launch Market Information System 
28. 
The  market  information  system,  initiated  by  MOFALI,  is  to  provide  consumers  with 
information on the origin of vegetables they are purchasing, while giving the growers data on the 
area of vegetables planted and harvested at the national level, facilitating business decisions by 
CGGs.  The  system  will  be  developed  in  2018  with  web  and  mobile  based  applications. 
Programming terms of references for the system will have been written during project preparation. 
PIU will work closely with MOFALI to develop the system.   
D.  
Provide Farmer Groups Training on Value Chain Management 
The  PIU  will  organize  training  in  2018  and  2019  aimed  to  improve  CGG  farmers’ 
29. 
awareness  and  knowledge  of  value-enhancing  aspects  of  the  vegetable  business  such  as 
vegetable grading, quality control, waste disposal and management of a value chain.  
E.  
Prepare Promotional Display, Bag, and Packaging 
30. 
The project will prepare promotional displays and other promotional items (e.g. bags) as 
part of the marketing and branding plan to be prepared by the branding and marketing expert. 
These promotional materials are to  be used by CGGs at national vegetable trade fairs, and at 
kiosks and the sale point supported by the project.  
F.   
Implement Stakeholder Communications 
The project has prepared a stakeholder communication plan to be implemented by PIU. 
31. 
Its  main  elements  are  establishment  of  a  project  website,  presence  on  selected  social  media 
sites⎯for example, Facebook⎯and development of printed materials and media communications 
to promote project activities, consultations, and training events. 
G.    
Implement Japanese Visibility 
32. 
The  project  has  a  plan  to  ensure  Japanese  visibility.  The  PIU  will  (i)  inform  the 
stakeholders  about  the  use  of  Japanese  resources  in  the  project,  and  (ii)  involve  Japanese 
officials when communicating the progress and achievements of the project. 
H.    Develop knowledge products 
33. 
During  the  last  2  quarters  of the  project,  Q2  2021  and  Q3  2021, the  PIU  shall  develop 
knowledge products that (i) summarize the key lessons learned, (ii) contain guidelines on how to 
replicate the best of the project experience elsewhere, and (iii) propose a strategy for scaling up 
community-based farming approaches to other areas of Mongolia. 
I.   
Organize an End-of-Project Symposium 
During  the  second  half  of  2021,  the  last  year  of  the  project,  the  PIU  will  organize  a 
34. 
workshop for key project participants (MOFALI, soum administrations, representatives of CGGs) 
and  other  stakeholders  (staff  of  government  ministries  and international organizations such as 
USAID,  Embassy  of  Japan  in  Mongolia,  JICA,  and  others).  The  symposium  will  review  the 
experience of the project, its achievements and weaknesses, and attempt to reach a consensus 
on the future direction of community-based vegetable farming in Mongolia.

PROJECT MANAGEMENT 
A.    Recruitment and Appointment of PIU Staff 
A critical task during project start-up is the recruitment of PIU staff. The positions of the 
35. 
PIU  project  coordinator,  finance  specialist,  and  procurement  specialist  are  to  be  filled.  Initial 
contracts should also be with firm/NGO/entity to support the overall implementation of the project. 
A QCBS selection mechanism as specified in the ADB guidelines on the use of consultants shall 
be  used for  that  purpose.  This  step  should  be  completed  no  later  than  the  end  of  the  second 
month  of  the  project.  The  project  director  and  coordinator  can  then  focus  on  recruiting  and 
appointing other PIU staff and consultants. 
B.    Monitoring and Evaluation and the DMF 
36. 
The M&E system monitors project performance against the DMF. In the first year of the 
project, the PIU’s M&E specialist shall review the project DMF, design the M&E system, collect 
the necessary data (from secondary sources and primary data from project sources) to establish 
the baseline for the project, and set up the format for quarterly project reports.  
37. 
The M&E specialist shall ensure that the PIU project coordinator and key PIU consultants 
are fully informed about the use the M&E system, including the entry of performance data into the 
system and producing quarterly reports on project performance.  
The M&E specialist is expected to return to the project in subsequent years to assist PIU 
38. 
in compiling mid-term and project completion reports.  
C.   
Social Safeguards and Gender Action Plan 
39. 
In the first year of the project, PIU’s social and gender specialist shall review the GAP, its 
targets and indicators; collect the necessary data (from secondary sources and primary data from 
project sources) to establish the social and gender baseline for the project, and set up the format 
for reporting on gender aspects in the quarterly project reports. The social and gender specialist 
should also identify any potential social issues that PIU needs to be aware of when implementing 
the project. The specialist should ensure that the PIU project coordinator and key PIU consultants 
are fully informed about the project’s social and gender targets, know how to track progress against 
these targets, and can report on them in the quarterly reports on project performance. 
The social and gender specialist shall return to the project in subsequent years to assist 
40. 
PIU  in  monitoring  performance  under  GAP  and  to  assist  PIU  in  completing  gender-related 
activities.

Appendix 5 
ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT SUMMARY 
Given the anticipated pattern of project’s environmental impacts, the project is classified as “C” 
under ADB Safeguard Policy Statement and no Environmental Management Plan is required. A 
review of anticipated impacts has been undertaken nonetheless and its results are summarized 
in table below. 
Table EMP-1: Environnemental Management Summary 
Potential Issues 
Promotion of community grower 
model likely to lead to 
intensification of farming. 
Some of the minor infrastructure 
(storage sheds, small 
greenhouses) may be 
inappropriately located. 
Implementation Phase 
Application of agrochemicals 
could pose health risks.   
Increased production likely to 
result in more agricultural waste. 
Increase in areas planted may 
result in local water scarcity. 
Introduction of new techniques of 
vegetable farming (e.g. use of 
“tunnels” or small greenhouses) 
may result in more plastic and 
glass waste  
Development of value chains 
likely to result in increased 
demand for packaging materials 
and transport (the latter with 
some adverse environmental 
impacts). 
Greater local processing of farm 
produce may create health risks 
(e.g. contamination by bacteria). 
Sales Kiosks 
Mitigation measures 
•   The project and community action plans to promote 
more efficient (rather than mainly more extensive) use of 
agricultural inputs (water, agrochemicals, farm 
equipment). 
•  Project target beneficiaries informed right from the 
project outset of the preference given to organic and 
other environmentally friendly agricultural inputs. 
Responsible body 
Executing agency 
through PIU  
•  The siting of small infrastructure to be reviewed by PIU 
and soum authorities to ensure that no sites are subject 
to waterlogging. 
PIU, project technical 
advisors and soum 
project coordinators. 
•  no sites should be within or adjacent to natural habitats 
or sensitive ecosystems 
•  The project to supply protective clothing to CGG 
members applying pesticides. The use of such clothing 
to be enforced. The intensity of pesticide use to be 
monitored. 
•  The project seeks to reduce agricultural waste by 
improving market access and promoting more complete 
use of the produce (e.g. through part-processing). 
Disposal of organic waste as well as its composting and 
reuse to be encouraged.  
•  More efficient use of water in vegetable farming to 
become one of key training topics. 
•  Provisions for storage of waste plastic and glass and 
their safe disposal to be incorporated in CGGs’ action 
plans and monitored. 
 Soum project 
coordinator and soum 
health authorities  
 PIU and project 
technical advisers 
PIU and project 
technical advisers 
•  Possible disadvantages of greater packaging (in 
disposing of it) outweighed by its health and convenience 
benefits. 
•  The intensity of transport to remain very low in rural 
Mongolia. The impact on air quality will remain negligible 
even if degradation of (grass)land through “multiple 
tracking” is likely to increase somewhat. Its adverse 
impact likely to be negligible compared to project 
benefits.    
•  All commercial processing by CGGs to be monitored by 
soum authorities for the observance of existing hygiene 
rules. 
•  Not within any environmental sensitive areas 
•  Areas will be agreed upon between MOFALI, UB City 
government and the project (documented in a MOU) 
•  Proper waste disposal will be ensured, following local

SOUM PROFILES 
Main Characteristics of the Four Project Soums 
1. 
Background 
Bornuur  and  Orkhon  soums  has  historically  been  some  of  the  largest  vegetable  producers  in 
Mongolia.  Bornuur  soum  has  traditionally  been  one  of  the  main  potato  growers  while  Orkhon 
soum has been the largest producer of vegetables other than potato. All four major producers of 
pickled vegetables in Ulaanbaatar get at least some of their vegetables from Orkhon soum. The 
trend continues to date; Orkhon and Bornuur soums still tend to specialize in growing vegetables 
they have traditional knowledge and experience.  
Ulaangom  soum  has traditionally  been  one of the main seed  producers  in Mongolia.  Although 
seed  production  has  declined  significantly  in  recent  years  compared  with  its  peak,  vegetable 
growing households still mainly specialize in seed production.  
Yeruu soum does not have a traditional large-scale vegetable growing sector.

According to data from soum administrations, among the four project soums, Bornuur soum has 
the highest number of vegetable-growing plots owned by households (549 plots with area of 976.5 
Ha) while Orkhon has the largest total area of plots owned by households.

Yeruu soum is characterized by very high portion (74%) of vegetable growers owning plots less 
than  0.6  Ha.  Most  of  the  vegetable  growers  are  people  who  grow  for  their  own  household 
consumption  (with  excesses  are  sold)  within  their  household  fences  instead  of  designated 
planting areas. On the contrary, almost a half of vegetable growing households in Orkhon soum 
have plots larger than 2 Ha. Own consumption growing is the next largest group in Orkhon where 
22% of plots are less than 0.5 Ha. In the other two soums, plots owned by households are evenly 
distributed in small, medium and large sizes. Tables 3 and 4 present this in detail.

Availability of Resources 
Because  of  their  long  tradition  of  vegetable  growing  in  large  scales,  growers  in  Bornuur  and 
Orkhon  soums  are  relatively  well  equipped  with  hand  tools  compared  those  in  Yeruu  and 
Ulaangom soums do not have much tools. In general, vegetable growing is highly labor-intensive 
in Mongolia. Hand tools that the vegetable growers currently have only complement labor input.   
Smallholders in all four soums rent tractors to plough their fields. Lack of tractors with appropriate 
capacity in the soums is one of the major constraints faced by smallholders. Harvesting of potato 
is one of the time- and labor-consuming work. For improving efficacy of this work, growers need 
potato-harvesting machine that is a lack. Some of other equipment, such as plough, harrows and 
cultivators  hand made  by  smallholders  and  their  increased  availability  will  improve  productivity 
significantly.

Appendix 8 
Bornuur soum. Water reservoir and vegetable fields. (Source: Google Map. 2016) 
1.2.    Main Problems Faced by Vegetable Growing Households 
Most of Bornuur soums vegetable growers have plots along the 8 (with additional 6 km from the 
reservoir to the fields) km irrigation scheme located near the soum center. The scheme was built 
in 1966 and has been in use since 1967. Due to usage over a long period, the irrigation scheme 
started to malfunction.  Leakages appeared in the dam holding reservoir, which cannot be filled 
up because of potential risk of dam breaking.  This coupled with uncoordinated use of water by 
farmers, results in water shortage for plots located towards the end of the scheme (Sections ХА 
-1 & ХА-2). The pumping station that was supposed to pump water upslope towards the end of 
the scheme is not fully functional due to two reasons: a) farmers do not have money to pay for 
electricity; b) there is not enough water to pump at the station.  
Second, farmers currently protect their vegetable with fences made with wood pillars connected 
by wires separating some plots individually. Such fences do not provide reliable protection, and 
there  are  regular  conflicts  between  herders  and  vegetable  growers  over  animals  eating 
vegetables. Growers must stay near by the plots day and nights during growing season to protect 
their vegetables. 
1.3.    Main Actions Taken by The Government to Tackle with the Problems 
In recent years, Government had spent approximately MNT 4 billion (~USD 2 million) for repairing 
/  rehabilitating  the  two  sections  (ХА  -1  &  ХА-2)  of  dam,  but  the  leakage  problem  was  not 
addressed during the rehabilitation.  Technical drawings for repairing the leakage have not been 
made and is expected that solution of the problem will require significant amount of fund.   
1.4.    Requests from the Soum Administration and Farmers to the Project 
The soum administration and farmers have expressed their interests to implement the project in 
their soum. Their most pressing need is to repair the leakages in the reservoir dam in the irrigation 
scheme,  and to  improve  protection  of  their fields  by  building  fences  around  the field along  the 
irrigation scheme.

2.2.    Main Problems Faced by Vegetable Growing Households 
The irrigation scheme of Orkhon soum is owned by a private company, ‘Khurtai’ LLC. No major 
repair has been done for the scheme since its construction, and maintenance has been minimal, 
and current condition of the scheme is not good. Canal brackets and head construction of the 
scheme are aged and broken, and the concrete canals cracked with leakages. The owner ‘Khurtai’ 
LLC  has  not  made  any  investment  to  address  the  problems.  However,  the  company  allows 
farmers with fields along the scheme to use water without requiring any payment.  
Appendix 8 
111 
Soil  in  some  parts  of  irrigated  vegetable  fields  has  been  depleted  /  eroded  and  affected  by 
diseases. Few of the growers use fertilizers to improve production. 
2.3.    Main Actions Taken by the Government to Tackle the Problems 
Soum Administration is concerned about the current situation of the scheme and spends some 
fund when necessary to prevent floodwater from creating more damages to the scheme. 
2.4.    Requests from the Soum Administration and Farmers to the Project 
The soum administration and farmers have expressed their interests to implement the project in 
their  soum.  There  is  a  vital  need  to  repair  the  entire  irrigation  scheme  –  head  construction, 
brackets of the canals etc. in the future. In addition,  soum requests the project’s assistance in 
improving soil quality and in fighting with weeds such as wheat grass, dog grass and others that 
negatively affect vegetable production.   
If  and  when  the  project  is  implemented,  the  soum  administration  will  be  willing  to  encourage 
collaboration among vegetable growers by forming growers’ groups to improve their livelihood. 
The soum is also planning to increase size of fields for growing fruits.

3.2.   Main Problems Faced by Vegetable Growing Households 
Compared  with  other  soums,  Yeruu soum  has  high  proportion  of vegetable  growers that  grow 
vegetables  for  their  own  household  consumption  with  intention  to  sell  the  excess  in  their 
household fences. About 30% of the plots is smaller than 0.05 Ha (500m2), 50% of the plots are 
smaller than 0.2 Ha (2000m2).   
The  soum  has  a  vegetable  growers’  association  established  in  2010  to  implement  a  project 
implemented  by  a Parliament member  supporting smallholders.  Nominally  the  association  has 
membership of 70 households (283 members) divided into 22 grower groups, but the association 
has been largely inactive until last year. The association resumed its activity to some extent last 
year to sell vegetables grown by its members to two large mines operating in the soum territory.   
The soum administration and farmers have expressed their interests to implement the project in 
their  soum,  and  recognize  the  need  to  reactivate  grower  groups,  and  combine  their  efforts  in 
vegetable production, selling, marketing and ultimately improving their livelihood.  
Major constraints faced by smallholders is lack of storages and equipment. Lack of storages force 
farmers to sell most of their product during harvesting season where prices are low. Because of 
their small-scale operation, most farmers are not able to afford tools and equipment and perform 
most  of  the  task  manually.  As  Yeruu  soum  is  located  along  a  river,  farmers  do  not  face  any 
problem with irrigation.  
3.3.    Main Actions Taken by the Government to Tackle the Problems 
Soum government is plans to establish and vegetable processing workshop. However, the plan 
is  in  early  stage  with  no  concrete  for  funding,  design  and  management  structure.  Soum 
administration  also  transferred  some  equipment  from  the  Agricultural  Centre  to  the  Growers 
Association.  
3.4.    Requests from the Soum Administration and Farmers to the Project 
The soum administration and farmers have expressed their interests to implement the project in 
their soum.  The soum governor understands that successful implementation of the project is a 
guarantee for improving the livelihood of growers and get more support from donor organizations 
like ADB/JFPR and others. The soum and growers’ requests to the project include:   
o  Various training for strengthening the existing grower groups, seed and new technology  
o  Equipment for vegetable growing (tractor, seeder, cultivator, digger, plough, etc.)  
o  Greenhouses for grower households (if possible, winter greenhouse) 
o  Storage (100 tons capacity) 
o  Vegetable processing workshop

4.2.    Main Problems in Seed Production Faced by the Aimag Recently 
Ulaangom soum of Uvs aimag is has favorable climate condition for seed growing, and farmers 
have traditionally grown seeds for several decades. This area produces 95-98 percent of seeds 
of  root  crops  namely  turnip,  beet,  carrots.  As  Mongolia  aims  to  increase  domestic  vegetable 
production, demand for seeds produced in Ulaangom is expected to be increased further.  
In Gashuunii gol   area, where around 1/3 of seed farmers are produced, farmers face limited 
supply of water. Main source of water is wells, but there are not enough wells to provide water to 
all fields.  
In Chandmani area, where the branch of the Institute for Plant and Agricultural Science (IPAS) 
owns a large field, three wells that have already been constructed in 2011 is not fully functional 
due to lack of electricity. Providing electricity to these well will help increase seed production by 
the  IPAS  branch.  In return, IPAS  branch  is  willing to  make some  of  its  land  available for  seed 
production by smallholder growers.  
Currently, electricity line reached to these farmers in comparatively close distance. Ground water 
well should be established in the middle of farmers plot together with water reservoir, which will 
use  electricity.  An  electricity  transformer  should  also  be  installed  to  operate  water  well(s). 
Reservoir and irrigation scheme should be installed for demonstration purpose among farmers. 
The  branch  of  the  Institute  for  Plant  and  Agricultural  Science  (IPAS)  started  to  suffer  from  a 
problem with water during May and September (vegetation period), so that installed three water 
wells in 2011 to use for field irrigation, but they have not yet connected with electricity. The IPAS 
also need storage for seed.  
4.3.   Main Actions Taken by the Government to Tackle the Problems 
Soum  administration  plans  to  deliver  electricity  to  the  ‘Gashuunii  gol’  area  using  the  public 
development fund (government support). Aimag government is planning to increase land areas 
for improving the seed production. 
4.4.    Requests from the Soum Administration and Farmers to the Project 
The soum administration and farmers have expressed their interests to implement the project in 
their soum.  The Deputy Governor of the Uvs aimag expressed his interest in implementing the 
project  in  Ulaangom  and  confirmed  to  provide  full  support  to  the  project  in  every  stage  of  its 
implementation. If the project is to be implemented in Ulaangom, aimag administration promised 
to make new fields available for seed production by including the issue in aimag’s land use plan 
in 2017.  The soum administration and farmers need project support in the following areas:  
(i)  Purchase of farming equipment and tractor. 
(ii)  Purchase  of  agrochemicals.  Budget  might  be  around  10  percent  of  the  equipment 
support to seed producers. 
(iii)  Water well and reservoir (tank) and irrigation pipes in Gashuunii gol.    
(iv)  Soft loan (revolving fund) for operation.  
(v)  Connecting water wells Chandmani area to the electricity line. 
(vi)  Mother crop storages (IPAS branch). 
(vii)  Make land available for research and for local seed producers.  
(viii)  Training to seed farmers.

9057-REG: Building Sustainable Food and Nutrition Security in Asia and the Pacific 
(Phase 1) 
Request for Funding Support for a Sub-Component Focusing on Creating Livelihood 
Opportunities for Women 
The Project 
The Community Vegetable Farming for Livelihood Improvement project is a pilot initiative aiming to 
improve the livelihood of smallholders involved in vegetable production in selected soums of four of 
Mongolia’s  aimags:  Bornuur  in  Tuv,  Orkhon  in  Darkhan-Uul,  Ulaangom  in  Uvs,  and  Yeruu  in 
Selenge.  This  is  to  be  achieved  by  introducing  a  community  farming  model,  applying  improved 
climate-resilient farming practices, strengthening farm-to-market linkages, and integrating farming 
groups into inclusive agriculture value chains. Project beneficiaries will be vegetable growers, seed 
producers, and household-based food processers across the four sites. The project has strong pro-
poor, women empowerment and participatory features and will directly benefit some 180 farming 
households (many of them female-headed) representing about 400 farmers and seed producers. 
Indirect benefit will accrue to the wider community in target soums with a total population of about 
45,000 and beyond. 
Impact, Outcome and Outputs 
The impacts will be: (i) income generation and enterprise support for smallholder vegetable farmers 
increased and agricultural productivity based on a value chain approach improved; and (ii) resilience 
and adaptation to climate change improved. The outcome will be rural livelihoods for smallholder 
vegetable farmers in project areas improved. The project will have three outputs: Community grower 
groups established; Sustainable climate-resilient vegetable farming practices applied; and farmers’ 
access to markets improved. Please see attached project draft GAR and GAP for more details.  
Support Requested  
Support from the RETA is being requested to support a sub-component under Output 3 – setting 
up  a  vegetable  food  processing  workshop  in  Orkhon  soum  to  create  livelihood  opportunities  for 
women  CGG  members,  and  gender-targeted  training  in  food  processing,  packaging,  labeling, 
marketing, and selling will be conducted.  
The  current  JFPR  grant  budget  is  covering  activities  in  4  project  soums  across  the  entire  value 
chain.  Given  the  limited  budget  and  breath  of  activities  to  be  conducted,  curtail  work  under  the 
project to focus on building and setting up of the processing workshop and some training activities. 
In order to achieve maximum benefits and have more impact, additional funds are required to: (i) 
put in place small-scale equipment (tools and appliances) for the value-addition and processing of 
fruits and vegetables, such as graters, blenders, juicers, etc, for women to be able to pickle, make 
jams, sauces, juices etc. Also, some small-scale equipment for freezing and drying of fresh produce; 
and (ii) provide skills training to a large number of women on value-added agri-processing, sorting, 
packaging, selling, and marketing knowledge. 
Within  the  current  project  scope  funded  by  JFPR,  around  50  women  could  benefit  from  this  sub-
component. If additional support was provided through the RETA, there is a potential to upgrade this 
project to GEM with the potential direct benefits for women in non-traditional "green" livelihood activities 
tippling to almost 150 women (around 10% of the entire female population in Orkhon soum).  
The  potential  increase  in benefits  to  women  in  the  Orkhon  project  site  and  impact  for  livelihood 
overall will be significantly greater if RETA funding $100,000 is be tapped into.
