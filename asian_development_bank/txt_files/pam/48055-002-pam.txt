Project Administration Manual Purpose and Process 
1.  The  project  administration  manual  (PAM)  describes  the  essential  administrative  and 
management requirements to implement the project on time, within budget, and in accordance 
with the policies and procedures of the government and Asian Development Bank (ADB). The 
PAM  should  include  references  to  all  available  templates  and  instructions  either  through 
linkages to relevant URLs or directly incorporated in the PAM. 
2.  The  Xinyu  City  Government  (XCG)  is  wholly  responsible  for  the  implementation  of  ADB-
financed  projects,  as  agreed  jointly  between  the  borrower  and  ADB,  and  in  accordance  with 
the  policies  and  procedures  of  the  government  and  ADB.  ADB  staff  is  responsible  for 
supporting 
their  obligations  and 
responsibilities for project implementation in accordance with ADB’s policies and procedures. 
including  compliance  by  XCG  of 
implementation 
3.  At  loan  negotiations,  the  borrower  and  ADB  shall  agree  to  the  PAM  and  ensure  consistency 
with  the  Loan  agreement.  Such  agreement  shall  be  reflected  in  the  minutes  of  the  loan 
negotiations. In the event of any discrepancy or contradiction between the PAM and the Loan 
agreement, the provisions of the Loan agreement shall prevail. 
4.  After ADB Board approval of the project's report and recommendations of the President (RRP), 
changes in implementation arrangements are subject to agreement and approval pursuant to 
relevant government and ADB administrative procedures (including the Project Administration 
Instructions) and upon such approval, they will be subsequently incorporated in the PAM.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
In step with the rapid economic growth that has taken place since 1985, a large number 
1. 
of people and assets have accumulated on floodplains in the People’s Republic of China (PRC). 
As  a  result,  the  PRC  is  facing  more  damaging  floods  along  with  serious  environmental 
consequences. Projected climate change impacts will likely exacerbate this trend by increasing 
the frequency and severity of flooding, as seen in the flood disaster that occurred in July 2016 in 
the  Yangtze  River  basin  (YRB),  the  second  most  expensive  natural  disaster  in  the  PRC’s 
history. 1  Unlike  past  disasters,  the  July  2016  flood  caused  loss  and  damage  in  small 
watersheds, which the Government of the PRC had not prioritized for investment. Cities’ master 
plans  in  the  PRC  do  not  sufficiently  use  an  integrated  flood  and  environmental  management 
(FEM) approach that considers hazards, exposure, vulnerability, and capacity. The government 
requested  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to  provide  lending  support  to  demonstrate 
integrated  and  climate-resilient  FEM  harmonized  with  urban  planning  in  Xinyu  City  in  the 
Kongmu  River  watershed.  The  request  is  consistent  with  the  recently  released  outline  of  the 
YRB  economic  belt  master  plan,  which  highly  prioritizes  environmental  protection,  water 
management, and flood risk reduction. 
Xinyu  City  is  a  new  industrial  city  located  in  Jiangxi  Province  and  had  1.17  million 
2. 
inhabitants (63.4% rural and 36.6% urban) in 2015. A significant portion of the city is situated on 
the Kongmu River watershed, a small watershed 500 square kilometers in size in the Ganjiang 
River sub-basin in the YRB. Various locations in Xinyu City along the Kongmu River experience 
annual floods due to low flood control and retention capacities. From 2001 to 2016 eight severe 
flood events were recorded, the worst of which in 2010 forced 78,000 people to evacuate and 
destroyed over 4,000 homes and 25 square kilometers of crops, causing $116 million in direct 
economic damage. Xinyu City also suffered major historical floods in 1953, 1955, 1962, 1977, 
1982, and 1989. The average annual damage due to floods in Xinyu City is $54 million.2 
3. 
The  project  is  located  in  the  upper  Kongmu  River  watershed,  which  covers  three 
townships  (Guanchao,  Ouli,  and  Xiacun)  and  a  new  subdistrict  in  Yushui  District  within  Xinyu 
City.3 In  the  upper  Kongmu  River  watershed,  35  villages  currently  house  109,580  people,  of 
whom 55,762 reside in river corridors in the project area. Most are exposed to floods and lack 
access to modern wastewater and solid waste facilities, a factor that exacerbates flooding and 
water  quality  degradation  in  both  the  upper  Kongmu  River  watershed  and  downstream  Xinyu 
City. Inhabitants of the upper Kongmu River watershed suffer from flash floods that develop with 
little warning, giving them insufficient time to save valuables and evacuate timely. Approximately 
94% of villagers obtain water from springs and shallow wells, only 6% have access to tap water, 
about 77% use public or pit toilets, and 23% have indoor flush toilets connected to septic tanks.  
4. 
Current  inhabitants  of  the  upper  Kongmu  River  watershed  are  mostly  farmers  with  an 
average annual income of $1,4094 and average land holding size of 1.2 mu.5 Yushui District, in 
the  Kongmu  River  watershed,  has  9,541  inhabitants  and  a  poverty  rate  of  2.7%.  The  newly

2   Calculated from Xinyu City flood disaster information. 
3   The XCG is developing a new subdistrict to (i) cater to its rapidly expanding population and industries, and (ii) take 
advantage of new business opportunities created by a new high-speed railway station. 
4  These  data  are  from  the  socioeconomic  survey  conducted  by  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance 
consultant team in 2016 and from the 2014 Xinyu and Jiangxi Province statistical yearbooks.

2 
planned subdistrict will have a population of 57,500 by 2020 and 130,000 by 2030. Xinyu City is 
required  to  (i)  manage  its  environment,  (ii)  safeguard  ecological  security,  (iii)  improve  water 
management,  and 
friendly  and  climate-resilient  urban 
development to provide sustainable livelihood opportunities to both upstream and downstream 
communities.   
(iv)  undertake  environmentally 
5. 
Unintegrated  rural  and  urban  flood  management.  Approximately  8,000  people 
currently live in areas highly prone to flash flood hazards in the upper Kongmu River watershed, 
without  flood  control  infrastructure  or  an  early  warning  system.  The  rest  of  the  people  in  the 
watershed’s 35 villages are exposed to riverine floods. The new subdistrict is exposed to flash, 
riverine, and urban floods, and may exacerbate downstream flooding by increasing stormwater 
runoff  due  to  land  use  changes.  If  a  flood  similar  in  size  to  the  2010  flood  occurs  in  the 
watershed again, it would create $185 million in damage. By 2030, flood damage would reach 
$589  million  with  ongoing  development,  and  $677  million  with  development  in  an  adverse 
climate change scenario.  
The Kongmu River watershed has six existing small lakes, which are not used for flood 
6. 
retention due to their low level outlets and sedimentation caused by adjacent farming practices. 
The  Baiyun  reservoir,  which  supplies  water  to  Xinyu  City,  is  running  at  only  0.7  million  cubic 
meters (m3) of its full capacity (4.2 million m3) due to operational restrictions imposed by riverine 
and backwater flooding. This has hindered the targeted level of flood control in the downstream 
Xinyu City by 50% in a 10-year return period, and 5% in a 50-year return period.  
7. 
Inadequate management of wastewater and solid waste. Pollutant levels in all lakes 
and  tributaries  in  the  upper  Kongmu  River  watershed  exceed  national  standards  due  to 
domestic  wastewater  discharge,  agricultural  nonpoint  source  pollution,  and  the  inefficient 
collection  and  disposal  of  solid  waste.  The  existing  combined  sewer  and  stormwater  pipeline 
network in Xinyu City is designed for small storm events not exceeding a 2-year return period; 
yet, over 50-year return period events have already occurred in the city since 2007, resulting in 
an overflow of untreated wastewater into the river. The upper watershed generates over 39 tons 
of  solid  waste  per  day;  this  is  projected  to  increase  to  66  tons  per  day  by  2020.  The  new 
subdistrict will further strain solid waste and wastewater management by producing 150 tons of 
solid  waste  and  12,500  m3  of  wastewater  per  day  by  2020.  Xinyu  City  lacks  a  proper  waste 
collection  and  transportation  system. 6 The  main  source  of  drinking  water  for  Xinyu  City  is 
located  downstream  of  these  villages  and  the  proposed  subdistrict.  Without  improving  waste 
management  and  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M),  these  issues  will  increase  flood  and 
environmental risks in the Kongmu River watershed and threaten Xinyu City residents’ drinking 
water supply.   
8. 
Insufficient  flood  and  environmental  risk  management  capacity.  The  XCG’s 
investment  has  not  yet  been  sufficient  to  mitigate  the  damage  due  to  high  levels  of  hazards, 
exposure, and vulnerability to floods. Despite several large flood events, flood hazard mapping 
and  risk  mapping  have  not  yet  been  done,  as  the  city  development  plans  do  not  use  risk 
mapping  and  climate-sensitive  land-use  planning  sufficiently.  Levels  of  awareness  and 
preparedness, and the response capacities of local governments and communities are low. The 
centralized  flood  forecasting  system  does  not  cover  the  communities  in  the  upper  Kongmu 
watershed. The Kongmu River watershed has no rain gauge and only a few water-level gauge 
and  water  quality  monitoring  stations.  The  present  flood  forecasting  system  relies  on  rainfall 
data from adjacent river basins, which is not a sound approach due to the highly heterogeneous

plant and Xinyu solid waste incineration plant, both of which are located in Yushui District. 
3 
spatial  distribution  of  rainfall  in  the  region. To  aid flash flood forecasting in the  upper  Kongmu 
River  watershed,  additional  hydrological  observation  stations  and  different  flood  modeling 
techniques  are  required.  The  integrated  FEM  approach  is  yet  to  be  embedded  in  the  city’s 
master plan. 
Strategic  fit.  For  the  implementation  of  the  outline  of  the  YRB  economic  belt  master 
9. 
plan, the project will timely demonstrate the new benchmarks for investment in FEM. 
10. 
The project also contributes to the PRC’s goal of building a harmonious and prosperous 
society through environmentally sustainable growth, and is consistent with the PRC’s Thirteenth 
Five-Year  Plan,  2016–2020,  which  highlights  the  importance  of  flood  risk  management,  and 
water  pollution  control.7 The  project  also  contributes  to  the  implementation  of  ADB’s  country 
partnership  strategy  for  the  PRC,  2016–2020,  of  which  three  of  the  five  main  principles—(i) 
managing climate  change  and  environment, (ii)  supporting  inclusive economic growth,  and  (iii) 
fostering knowledge cooperation—are reflected well in the proposed project.8 The project is also 
consistent  with  (i)  ADB’s  Water  Operational  Plan,  2011–2020,  which  emphasizes  integrated 
water  resources management (IWRM)  with focus  on  water-related  disaster risk management;9 
and (ii) sustainable development goals 6, 11, and 13.10 
11. 
Lessons. The project design incorporates lessons from previous ADB-financed projects 
and policy-oriented studies on IWRM, environmental and ecosystem improvement, wetland and 
lake management and restoration, and urban–rural integration in the PRC.11 Lessons from past 
and  ongoing  ADB  support  in  the  PRC  for  the  water  sector  include  (i)  nonstructural  measures 
and  community  participation,  (ii)  continuous  O&M  with  sustainable  financial  sources,  and  (iii) 
management and data information systems for IWRM decision-making. Other lessons reflected 
in  the  project  design  are  (i)  institutional  and  financial  management  reforms  contributing  to 
sustainable  FEM,  (ii)  capacity  development  for  project  implementation  and  O&M,  and  (iii)  an 
effective project monitoring and evaluation system.

the  improvement  and  regulation  of  small  lakes  for  FEM;  and  (ii)  flood  protection  along  the 
Kongmu River through the construction of levee- and water-regulating structures.  
14. 
Output 2: Solid waste and wastewater management systems improved. This output 
will include (i) the construction of a wastewater collection network separate from the stormwater 
collection  network,  which  will  improve  water  quality  by  reducing  sewerage  overflows;  (ii)  the 
improvement of the solid waste management system, which will reduce the export of solid waste 
into  waterways  yielding  both  water  quality  and  flooding  benefits;  and  (iii)  the  construction  of 
wetlands in the lakes, canals, and Kongmu River to treat stormwater runoff and improve water 
quality. 
15. 
Output  3:  Flood  and  environmental  risk  management  capacity  enhanced.  This 
output will include (i) capacity development for FEM; (ii) the preparation of a land-use plan and 
building  regulations  based  on  flood  risk  mapping;  (iii)  nonstructural  measures  to  reduce 
residents’ vulnerability, such as early flood warning, flood proofing, and contingency plans; (iv) 
climate  change  monitoring  to  reduce  uncertainty  in  flood  risk  design;  (v)  water  quality 
monitoring; (vi) the establishment of community-based FEM; and (vii) the development of a river 
basin model to aid river basin planning.    
16. 
Special  features  and  value  addition.  The  project  is  timely  in  the  wake  of  the  recent 
flood  disaster  and the  preparation  and  implementation of the  YRB  economic  belt master  plan. 
The project will demonstrate in-country best practices and establish new performance standards 
and good practices for investment in FEM. It will also provide a conducive opportunity for new 
dialogue,  regional  cooperation,  and  ADB–PRC  collaboration  for  responding  to  flood  risk 
management and climate variability. 
17. 
The  project  adopts  integrated  flood-resilient  development  planning  to  maximize  flood 
control and strengthen environmental outcomes.12 This includes innovative structural measures 
like  multifunctional  levees,13 underground  stormwater  storage,  sponge  city  construction,14 and 
interconnected flood storage lakes.15 
18. 
Complementary  nonstructural  measures  include  (i)  flood  early  warning  systems;  (ii) 
community-based  FEM;16 and  (iii)  flood-sensitive  development  planning,  including  upstream–
downstream  linkages  and  rural–urban  integration. 17 Flood  risk  mapping  will  enhance  spatial 
planning and be further operationalized by the issuance of regulations on land use, river corridor 
development, and solid waste management; and building standards and codes. These life- and 
asset-saving measures will directly benefit the current inhabitants and the projected population 
of approximately 300,000 by 2030, both within and outside the project area. 
12 The  project  will  implement  a  number  of  measures  that  will  serve  both  flooding  and  environmental  needs.  The 
project will improve water quality, largely mitigate flooding in the project area by capturing almost 75% of the peak 
surface runoff, and reduce annual average flood damage in downstream Xinyu City by $5.36 million. 
13 The  levee  will  protect  three  villages  in  the  project  area  from  both  riverine  and  backwater  floods,  allowing  the 
reservoir  to  operate  at  full  capacity  (securing  an  additional  3.5  million  m3)  and  also  reducing  flood  peaks 
downstream. 
14 A city planning and design approach to absorb rainfall and surface runoff aims to reduce stormwater (urban floods) 
and polluted runoffs and use  this water in eco-friendly ways. The design techniques include permeable surfaces, 
gardens, rainwater harvesting, green spaces, and lakes. 
15 The existing six small lakes will be interconnected by canals with structures that can regulate the water levels in the 
lakes and also retain water in the canals to best optimize flood control. 
16 The  community-based  activities  will  focus  on  organization  development,  capital  formation,  skill  enhancement, 
gender equity, environmental protection, appropriate technologies, and emergency response. 
17 The project will promote flood and environment sensitive land-use planning in upper Kongmu River watershed that 
will  help  safeguard  the  area  (mostly  rural)  from  flood  and  environmental  degradation  and  mitigate  the  flood  and 
environmental risks in the downstream area (existing Xinyu City).

COSTS AND FINANCING 
20. 
The  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $300.39  million.  The  project  investment  plan  is  shown  in 
Table 5 below. Detailed cost estimates by expenditure category, financier and output are shown in 
accompanying  tables.  Loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  according  to  the  Loan  Disbursement 
Handbook  (2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  subject  to  the  provisions  of  the  loan 
Agreement.

                                     Total (A+B+C) 
a    Includes  taxes  and  duties  of  $25.16  million  to  be  financed  from  government  resources  ($12.86  million)  and  Asian 
Development Bank (ADB) loan resources ($12.30 million). The inclusion of taxes and duties in ADB-financed project 
expenditures is consistent with the country partnership strategy for the  People’s Republic of China, 2016–2020. The 
financing of taxes and duties does not represent an excessive share of the project cost, and is material and relevant to 
the project’s success. Taxes and duties on the government-financed expenditures will be provided in cash. 
b    In 2016 first quarter prices. 
c    Physical contingencies computed at 10.0%. Price contingencies computed at 1.5% in 2018, 1.4% in 2019, 1.5% in 
2020, 1.5% in 2021, and 1.5% thereafter. Price contingencies on local currency costs are calculated at 2.3% in 2018, 
2.4% in 2019, 2.5% in 2020, 2.5% in 2021, and 2.5% thereafter. 
d    Includes interest during construction and commitment charges. Interest for the ADB loan has been computed at the 5-
year United States dollar fixed swap rate, plus an ADB spread of 0.5% and a maturity premium of 0.1%. Commitment 
charges for the ADB loan are 0.15% per year to be charged on the undisbursed loan amount. 
Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. 
21. 
The government has requested a loan of $150 million from ADB’s ordinary capital resources 
to  help  finance  the  project.  The  loan  will  have  a  25-year  term,  including  a  6  year  grace  period, 
following  the  straight-line  method,  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB’s 
London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based leading facility, a commitment charge for undisbursed 
loan of 0.15% per year (the interest and commitment charge during construction to be capitalized18 
in the loan) and such other terms and conditions set forth in the loan and project agreements. The 
average loan maturity is 15.75 years and the maturity premium of 0.10% per annum. 
The  XCG  will  be  the  legal  entity  responsible  for  servicing  the  ADB  loan  and  providing 
22. 
counterpart funding. 
A. 
Cost Estimates Preparations and Revisions 
23. 
Cost  estimates  were  prepared  on  behalf  of  the PMO  by  the  Shanghai Urban Construction 
Design Institute,  in  consultation  with the  implementing  agencies and  project  preparatory  technical 
assistance  (PPTA)  consultants,  and  under  the  guidance  of  ADB  project  officer.  Costing  was 
18 Capitalization  of  interest  and  commitment  charge  means  that  interest  and  commitment  charge  incurred  during  the 
project implementation period will be automatically deducted from the loan proceeds rather than requiring borrowers to 
pay  from  another  source.  In  such  a  case,  interest  will  incur  to  the  loan  proceeds  used  to  pay  for  interest  and 
commitment  charge.  Without  this  arrangement,  on  the  other  hand,  the  borrower  needs  to  start  paying  interest  and 
commitment charge from its own resource once the project starts. 
13 
completed  using  Government  costing  standards,  and  costing  information  from  site  investigations, 
project files of the design institute and queries with suppliers. 
24. 
Responsibility for revising and updating the cost estimates during implementation rest with 
the project implementing agency, Xinyu Urban and Rural Construction Investment Group Company, 
Ltd.  (XURCIG),  and  the  PMO  located  within  XURCIG.  As  the  implementing  agency,  XURCIG, 
supported  by  design  institutes,  a  tendering  agent,  supervision  companies  and  implementation 
consultants,  is  responsible  for  design  and  procurement,  and  the  administration  and  monitoring  of 
contractors  and  suppliers.  The  revision  of  cost  estimates  will  be  undertaken  in  the  course  of  the 
execution of these responsibilities. Cost evaluations will occur and revisions made as necessary at 
detailed design, during the review of tenders and during the monitoring of contract execution.   
B. 
Key Assumptions

FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT 
A. 
Financial Management Assessment 
A financial management assessment, completed under the project preparatory technical 
27. 
assistance,  considered  the  financial  management  capacity  of  Xinyu  City  Finance  Bureau  (on 
behalf of the executing agency, XCG) and the implementing agency, XURCIG. The assessment 
examined  funds-flow  arrangements,  staffing,  accounting  and  financial  reporting  systems, 
internal and external auditing arrangements, and financial information systems. 
28. 
The  assessment  determined  that  the  main  financial  management  risks  are:  (i) 
implementation risk—delays in project implementation caused by a lack of familiarity with ADB 
disbursement  procedures  and  requirements,  (ii)  compliance  risk—delays  in  project  reporting 
and the identification of issues on the use of loan proceeds  due to lack of familiarity with ADB 
financial  management  requirements,  particularly  for  accounting,  reporting  and  auditing,    (iii) 
financing  risk—delays  and  shortfalls  in  the  provision  of  counterpart  funding  which  could  delay 
project  implementation,  and  (iv)  construction  and  operational  risk—insufficient  experience  in 
construction  and  operational  management  for  some  project  components  that  could  hamper 
project progress and result in poorer quality of services provided after project completion. The 
overall financial management risk-rating of the project before considering mitigating measures is 
moderate.  The  identified  financial  management  risks  will  be  closely  monitored  during  project 
implementation.  
29. 
The  proposed  financial  management  action  plan  includes:  (i)  covenants  in  loan  and 
project  agreements  to  ensure  adequate  counterpart  funds  to  support  capital,  operating  and 
maintenance, and debt repayment requirements; (ii) training of XCFB and XURCIG staff in ADB 
disbursement procedures and requirements prior to loan effectiveness; (iii) training of XCFB and 
XURCIG  staff  in  ADB  financial  management  requirements,  specifically  accounting,  reporting 
and  auditing  prior  to  loan  effectiveness;  (iv)  close  monitoring  to  allow  timely  identification  of 
potential issues in counterpart funding; and (v) inclusion of a financial management expert and  
professional  engineers  in  the  capacity  building  package  in  output  3  to  provide  necessary 
guidance  and  professional  financial  management  and engineering  support  and training for the 
financial and related staff in the project entities. 
30. 
Project arrangements with appropriate mitigations are considered satisfactory.

Disbursement 
1. 
Disbursement Arrangements for ADB Funds 
The  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  Loan  Disbursement 
31. 
Handbook  (2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time),  and  detailed  arrangements  agreed  upon 
between the government and ADB. Online training for project staff on disbursement policies and 
procedures  is  available.19 Project  staff  are  encouraged  to  avail  of  this  training  to  help  ensure 
efficient disbursement and fiduciary control. 
32. 
The  implementing  agency,  through  the  PMO,  will  be  responsible  for  all  disbursement 
arrangements  including  (i)  preparing  disbursement  projections,  (ii)  requesting  budgetary 
allocations  for  counterpart  funds,  (iii)  collecting  supporting  documents,  and  (iv)  preparing  and 
sending withdrawal applications to ADB.

Imprest fund procedure. An imprest account should be established and maintained by 
33. 
JPFD  on  behalf  of  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies  for  each  funding  source.    The 
currency of the imprest account is the US dollar.  The imprest account is to be used exclusively 
for ADB’s share of eligible expenditures. The executing agency, through JPFD, who established 
the imprest account in its name, is accountable and responsible for proper use of advances to 
the imprest account. 
34. 
The total outstanding advance to the imprest account should not exceed the estimate of 
ADB’s  share  of  expenditures  to  be  paid  through  the  imprest  account  for  the  forthcoming  6 
months.  The  executing  agency  may  request  for  initial  and  additional  advances  to  the  imprest 
account  based  on  an  Estimate  of  Expenditure  Sheet. 20  Supporting  documents  should  be 
submitted to ADB or retained by the  executing and implementing agencies  in accordance with 
ADB’s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2015, as amended from time to time) when liquidating or 
replenishing the imprest account. 
Statement  of  expenditure  procedure. 21  The  SOE  procedure  may  be  used  for 
35. 
reimbursement  of  eligible  expenditures  or  liquidation  of  advances  to  the  imprest  account.  The 
ceiling of the SOE procedure is the equivalent of $200,000 per individual payment.  Supporting 
documents  and records for  the  expenditures  claimed  under  the  SOE  should be maintained  by 
the  implementing  agency,  through  the  PMO,  and  made  readily  available  for  review  by  ADB's 
disbursement  and  review  missions,  upon  ADB's  request  for  submission  of  supporting 
documents  on  a sampling basis,  and for  independent  audit.  Reimbursement  and  liquidation of 
individual  payments  in  excess  of  the  SOE  ceiling  should  be  supported  by  full  documentation 
when submitting the withdrawal application to ADB. 
36. 
Before the submission of the first withdrawal application, the executing agency, through 
JPFD, should submit to ADB sufficient evidence of the authority of the person(s) who will sign 
the  withdrawal  applications,  together  with  the  authenticated  specimen  signatures  of  each 
authorized  person.  The  minimum  value  per  withdrawal  application  is  US$100,000  equivalent. 
Individual  payments  below  this  amount  should  be  paid  (i)  by  the  executing  agency  (or 
implementing agency) and subsequently claimed to ADB through reimbursement, or (ii) through 
the imprest fund procedure, unless otherwise accepted by ADB. No withdrawals shall be made 
from the loan account until XCG shall enter into one or more contracts acceptable to ADB with 
Nanchang Public Utility Group or another company or agency acceptable to ADB for expansion 
of the Xiacun wastewater treatment plant to a capacity of 25,000 m3/day. 
2. 
Disbursement Arrangements for Counterpart Fund 
37. 
For the domestic funds, the executing agency will allocate the designated funding for the 
project  as  specified  in  the  project  agreement.  Counterpart  funds  from  the  government  will  be 
disbursed  and  liquidated  by  the  executing  agency  to  contractors  and  service  providers. 
Disbursement  of counterpart funds  will follow  this  process:  (i)  according to the  progress  of the 
contract, the implementing agency will submit disbursement request to the  PMO; and (ii) once 
approved, counterpart funds will be disbursed from JPFD. 
C. 
Accounting 
38. 
The  XURCIG  will  maintain  separate  books  and  records  by  funding  source  for  all 
expenditures  incurred  on  the  project.  The  XURCIG  will  prepare  consolidated  project  financial

statements  annually  in  accordance  with  the  government's  accounting  laws  and  regulations, 
which are consistent with international accounting principles and practices. 
D. 
Auditing and Public Disclosure 
39. 
The  executing  and  implementing  agencies  will  cause  the  detailed  consolidated  project 
financial  statements to be  audited  in accordance  with  International  Standards  on  Auditing  and 
the Government Auditing Standards of the PRC (where these are consistent with International 
Standards  on  Auditing),  by  an  independent  auditor  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  audited  project 
financial  statements  together  with  the  auditor’s  opinion  will  be  presented  in  English  to  ADB 
within 6 months from the end of the fiscal year by the implementing agency.   
The audit report for the project financial statements will include a management letter and 
40. 
auditor’s opinions, which cover (i) whether the project financial statements present an accurate 
and fair view or are presented fairly, in all material respects, in accordance with the applicable 
financial  reporting  standards;  (ii)  whether  the  proceeds  of  the  loan  were  used  only  for  the 
purpose(s)  of  the  project;  and  (iii)  whether  the  borrower  or  executing  and  implementing 
agencies  were  in  compliance  with  the  financial  covenants  contained  in  the  loan  and  project 
agreements. 
Compliance  with  financial  reporting  and  auditing  requirements  will  be  monitored  by 
41. 
review  missions  and  during  normal  program  supervision,  and  followed  up  regularly  with  all 
concerned, including the external auditor.  
The  government,  executing  and  implementing  agencies  have  been  made  aware  of 
42. 
ADB’s  approach  to  delayed  submission,  and  the  requirements  for  satisfactory  and  acceptable 
quality of the audited project financial statements.22 ADB reserves the right to require a change 
in  the  auditor  (in  a  manner  consistent  with  the  constitution  of  the  borrower),  or  for  additional 
support  to  be  provided  to  the  auditor,  if  the  audits  required  are  not  conducted  in  a  manner 
satisfactory  to ADB,  or  if  the  audits  are  substantially  delayed.  ADB  reserves the  right to verify 
the  project's  financial  accounts  to  confirm  that  the  share  of  ADB’s  financing  is  used  in 
accordance with ADB’s policies and procedures.   
43. 
Public  disclosure  of  the  audited  project  financial  statements,  including  the  auditor’s 
opinion  on  the  project  financial  statements,  will  be  guided  by  ADB’s  Public  Communications 
Policy  2011.23 After  the  review,  ADB  will  disclose  the  audited  project  financial  statements  and 
the  opinion  of  the  auditors  on  the  project  financial  statements  no  later  than  14  days  of  ADB’s 
22 ADB’s approach and procedures regarding delayed submission of audited project financial statements:  
(i)  When audited project financial statements are not received by the due date, ADB will write to the executing 
agency advising that (a) the audit documents are overdue; and (b) if they are not received within the next 6 
months,  requests  for  new  contract  awards  and  disbursement  such  as  new  replenishment  of  imprest 
accounts, processing of new reimbursement, and issuance of new commitment letters will not be processed. 
(ii)  When  audited  project  financial  statements  are  not  received  within  6  months  after  the  due  date,  ADB  will 
withhold processing of requests for new contract awards and disbursement such as new replenishment of 
imprest accounts, processing of new reimbursement, and issuance of new commitment letters. ADB will (a) 
inform the executing agency of ADB’s actions; and (b) advise that the loan may be suspended if the audit 
documents are not received within the next 6 months. 
(iii)  When audited project financial statements are not received within 12 months after the due date, ADB may 
suspend the loan.

A  project  procurement  risk  assessment  was  conducted  for  the  project,  in  accordance 
with  the  Guide  on  Assessing  Procurement  Risks  and  Determining  Project  Procurement 
Classification.  
The  main  weaknesses  identified  include:  (i)  lack  of  experience  of  the  PMO  and  the

(ii)  some 
discrepancies  between  domestic  and  ADB  practices;  and  (iii)  lack  of  procedures  in  place  for

47. 
Proposed mitigation measures include intensive training to be provided to relevant staff 
of the  PMO,  executing  and  implement  agencies, and other  stakeholder  agencies. The training 
should  include  topics  in  ADB  procedures  for  procurement  of  goods,  works  and  consulting 
services,  and  should  be  organized  before  any  procurement  activity  is  commenced.  It  is 
recommended that the PMO, through the implementing agency, develop a project management 
(including procurement) protocol with assistance from consultants.

Updating  the  EMP  and  inclusion  in  bidding  documents.  In  the  design  stage  the 
executing  agency  will  forward  the  EMP  to the  design  institutes  for  incorporating  the  mitigation 
measures  into  the  detailed  technical  designs.  In  the  event  that  any  changes  are  made  to  the 
designs approved by ADB, the EMP will be updated as needed. To ensure that bidders respond 
to  the  EMP  provisions,  the  PMO  and  implementing  agency  will  prepare  and  provide  the 
following  specification  clauses  for  incorporation  into  the  bidding  documents:  (i)  a  list  of 
environmental management requirements to be budgeted by the bidders in their proposals, (ii) 
environmental clauses for contractual terms and conditions, and (iii) the updated IEE and EMP, 
and, the domestic environmental impact assessment reports. 
80. 
EMP implementation. The executing and implementing agencies will be responsible for 
ensuring  that  the  project  will  be  designed,  constructed,  decommissioned,  and  operated  in 
accordance  with  (i)  the  national  and  local  government  environmental,  health  and  safety  laws, 
regulations, procedures, and guidelines; (ii) ADB’s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), and (iii) 
the  IEE 
for  the 
including  the  EMP.  The  executing  agency  holds  final  responsibility 
implementation  and  compliance  with  the  EMP.  The  contractors  and  construction  supervision 
companies  will  be  responsible  for  internal  environmental  monitoring  and  supervision  during 
construction,  respectively.  Environmental  impact  monitoring  will  be  conducted  by  the  local 
environment monitoring stations, contracted by the executing agency. Roles and responsibilities 
to  implement  the  EMP  are  defined  in  Attachment  1.  The  project  implementation  management 
support  consulting  services  will  include  a  loan  implementation  environment  consultant  (LIEC), 
environmental  engineer,  and  constructed  wetland  specialist.  These  specialists  will  support  the 
PMO and contractors in implementing the EMP. 
81. 
Budget  requirements  for  EMP. The executing and implementing agencies shall make 
available  the  necessary  budgetary  and  human  resources  to  fully  implement  the  EMP.  If  any 
unanticipated  environmental  risks  and  impacts  arise  during  construction  or  operation  of  the 
project that were not considered during the environmental assessments, the executing agency, 
through  the  implementing  agency,  shall  promptly  inform  ADB  in  writing  of  the  occurrence  of 
such  risks  or  impacts,  with  detailed  description  of  the  event  and  the  proposed  action  plan  for 
incorporation in the updated EMP.

experience  with  ADB-funded  projects  or  safeguard  requirements.  To  ensure  effective 
implementation  of  the  EMP,  a  capacity  building  program  will  be  implemented  on  EMP 
implementation, supervision, and reporting, the Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM), and the 
design  and  O&M  of  “sponge  city”  guidelines  and  the  constructed  wetlands.  Training  will  be 
provided  by  the  LIEC  and  other  experts  under  the  loan  implementation  consultant  services. 
Trainees  will  include  the  staff  of  PMO,  implementing  agency,  construction  supervision 
companies  and  contractors.  Training  programs  will  cover:  (i)  EMP  adjustment  and 
implementation;  (ii)  GRM;  (iii)  Environmental  protection  and  monitoring;  and  (iv)  Sponge 
City/Constructed Wetland O&M. 
83. 
Grievance  Redress  Mechanism.  A  GRM  has  been  developed  in  compliance  with 
ADB’s  SPS  (2009)  requirement  to  address  environmental,  health,  safety,  and  social  concerns 
associated with project construction, operation, and land acquisition arrangements. The details 
of the GRM,  including  a  time-bound flow  chart  of  procedures,  are  included  in the  project  EMP 
and RP; the complaint channels are slightly different for environmental and resettlement issues, 
but the PMO will maintain an integrated system to document, follow-up and reports on all cases. 
B.  
Resettlement 
Introduction. The project is classified as Category A in terms of involuntary resettlement 
84. 
and a Resettlement Plan (RP) has been prepared in accordance with ADB’s Safeguard Policy 
Statement (SPS 2009).   
Since  the  detailed  measurement  surveys  have  not  been  conducted,  the  current  RP  is 
85. 
considered draft and will need to be updated and the updated RP will need to be resubmitted to 
ADB for approval prior to commencement of LAR and award of civil works contract. The update 
will be based on the final design, census of affected persons and inventory of loses (land and 
fixed assets). The executing and implementing agencies will re-endorse the updated RP and re-
disclose to affected villages. The contract for any civil works involving resettlement impacts will 
not be awarded until the updated RP is approved by ADB. 
Scope  of  Resettlement  Impacts.  In  order  to  avoid  or  minimize  the  impacts  of  land 
86. 
acquisition  and  resettlement  (LAR),  consultations  were  conducted  with  the  local  government 
departments, village committees and affected persons during the preparation of the RPs. Based 
on  the  latest  FSR,  the  project  will  affect  5  villages  with  13  village  groups  of  1  sub-district 
(Yangtiangang) and 2 towns (Guancao and Xiacun) in one district (Yushui), respectively, in the 
project area.  
87. 
The project will require a total area of 2,441.35 mu of land to be permanently occupied, 
including  acquisition  of  2,290.48  mu28 collectively-owned  land  and  occupation  of  150.87  mu 
state-owned  land.  The  project  will  temporarily  occupy  37.2  mu  of  collective  land  in  total.  In 
addition,  some  rural  houses  need  to  be  demolished  in  a  total  area  of  24,657.06  m2,  in  which 
19,581.61 m2 are residential houses, and the remaining 5,075.45 m2 are non-residential houses. 
The  project  will  affect  1,078  households  with 3,693 persons  permanently  and 119 households 
with 405 persons29 temporarily, totaling 1,1971 households with 4,098 persons (Table 13). 
88. 
Resettlement  Policy  Framework  and  Compensation  Rates.  The  objective  of 
resettlement, according to both the PRC laws and regulations and ADB’s SPS, is to achieve at 
28 1 mu =1/15 hectare =666.67 m2 
29  Both are affected by permanent land acquisition. 
37 
least  the  same  or  better  income,  livelihood  and  living  conditions.  Based  on  consultations  with 
the  executing  and  implementing  agencies,  PMO,  local  government  departments  and  affected 
persons  as  well  as  the  practical  experiences  in  the  project  area,  the  following  principles  of 
resettlement are agreed for the project: 
  Avoid or minimize resettlement, wherever feasible; 
  Compensation  and  entitlements  provided  to  the  affected  persons  (APs)  will  be 
adequate  to  at  least  maintain  their  “without  project”  standard  of  living,  and  have 
prospects of improvement; 
  All APs will be provided with resettlement assistance and granted fair compensation;  
  Where post-requisition cultivated land per capita is not sufficient to maintain livelihood, 
compensation  in  cash  or  kind  for  replacement  land  for  other  income-generating 
activities will be provided for the APs;  
  All  the  APs  will  be  adequately  informed  on  eligibility,  compensation  rates  and 
standards, livelihood and income restoration plans, project timing, and will be involved 
in the RP implementation process;  
  No land requisition will take place unless replacement land or sufficient compensation 
for resettlement is given to the APs; 
  The executing and implementing agencies, PMO, and an independent / third party will 
monitor compensation and resettlement operations; 
  Vulnerable groups will receive special assistance to ensure they are better off, so that 
such APs listed in the RP will have the opportunity to benefit from the project; 
  RPs will be integrated with the overall City / District planning; and 
  The  resettlement  budget  will  adequately  cover  the  full  aspects  of  all  compensation 
required. 
89. 
The  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  compensation  policies  and  standards  will  follow 
the  Land  Administration  Law  of  the  People’s  Republic  of  China  (2004),  Decision  of  the  State 
Council on Deepening the Reform and Rigidly Enforcing Land Administration (SC [2004] No.28) 
(October  21,  2004),  and  other  applicable guidelines.  They  will  also  be  based  on  local  policies 
regarding land acquisition and resettlement (LAR) in Jiangxi Province, and ADB’s SPS.  
Compensation  for  acquisition  of  collectively-owned  land  includes  land  compensation, 
90. 
resettlement  subsidies,  young  crop  compensation  and  ground  attachment  compensation  (see 
rates in Table 14). As practice is in the project area, it was agreed that the land compensation 
will  be  equally  divided  among  APs  and  the  remaining  farmland  will  be  equally  allocated  after 
land  acquisition.  Compensation  for  houses,  young  crops,  trees  and  other  associated  facilities 
and impacts of temporary land occupation is directly paid to the APs.  
91. 
Compensation  for  rural  houses  will  be  made  according  to  the  principle  of  full 
replacement  cost.  All  the  affected  households  (HHs)  opted  for  free  resettlement  houses30 plus 
monetary  compensation31 and  are  willing  to move into  the resettlement community32 which  will 
30 Every normal affected household can obtain two sets of free resettlement houses with 110 m2 of construction area 
per house. The affected households who prefer cash provision shall be paid at the price of CNY800/m 2 based on 
the area of resettlement houses, totally CNY176,000 per household.  
31 Beside  free  resettlement  houses,  affected  households  will  receive  cash  compensation  based  on  the  cost  and 
original house area. The compensation rates of demolished houses are: CNY520/m2 for brick-concrete structure; 
CNY280/m2 for brick-timber structure. House facilities will be paid at cost price. 
32 Shendi  Garden  Resettlement  Community  is  located  in  northeast  corner  of  the  center  of  High-speed  Rail  Zone, 
bounded  by  Yudai  Lake  Park  on  the  east,  Xianglong  Avenue  on  the  north,  Changshan  Road  on  the  west,  and 
Xinyu North Station of High-speed Railway on the west. The total area of the community is 110,792.8 m2 (166.2 
mu), and the construction area is 200,000 m2. 
38 
be  constructed  by  local  government.  The  relocated  HHs  will  also  receive  subsidies  in  the 
transition period, demolition reward and moving subsidies (Table 15). 
92. 
All  APs  are  eligible  to  receive  compensation  and  assistance.  The  cut-off  date  for 
certification  of  such  entitlement,  25  July  2016,  has  been  disclosed  to  all  the  APs  during  the 
measurement survey of resettlement impacts.  
93. 
Resettlement  and  Rehabilitation  Measures.  Under  the  project,  an  evaluation  was 
conducted  over  the  land  losses  of  affected  villager  groups  and  the  income  restoration  plan 
included  in  the  RP.  These  will  be  subject  to  further  negotiation  and  discussion  with  the  APs 
during the detailed design stage, and the final findings and results integrated into the updated 
RP. 
94. 
In general, the income restoration options include:  
(i)  Agricultural resettlement actions mainly including increase land output through crop 
improvement and land improvement, continuing agricultural growing activities; 
(ii)  Non-agricultural  resettlement.  Surplus  labor  arising  from  land  acquisition,  in 
particular,  the  young  and  middle-aged  laborers,  will  be  resettled  through  labor 
transfer  and  reemployment.  The  main  sources  of  jobs  include  employment 
opportunities in nearby industry zones, jobs created by the project, and other public 
service  jobs.  In  addition,  APs  who  choose  to  run  their  own  business  will  be 
provided with financial support in the form of micro-credit loan;  
(iii)  Training  of  agricultural  and  non-agricultural  skills  provided  free  to  the  APs  to 
enable them to develop various means of making a living; and  
(iv)  Endowment  insurance  provided  to  eligible  farmers  affected  by  land  acquisition  or 
rural-urban  social  welfare  insurance.  The  APs  who  have  been  engaged  in  the 
urban-rural  integrated  pension  program  can  increase  their  pay  level  after  they 
receive  the  compensation  of  land  acquisition.    The  land  expropriated  farmers33 
(LEF) can join in the urban worker pension program. Local government will provide 
subsidies for the endowment programs of affected persons. 
In terms of non-residential building demolition, the owner of one affected pig farm will be 
95. 
compensated based on the price of market assessment after consultation. The affected persons 
will  be  provided  fruits  and  vegetable  planting  guidance  or  skill  training  and  loan  for 
entrepreneurship to restore livelihoods. 
96. 
Resettlement  budget  and  financing  plan.  The  initial  LAR  budget  is  estimated  to  be 
CNY 273.97 million (Table 16). The detailed budget of the resettlement will be updated upon the 
finalization of the compensation policy and project design, and included in the final RP following 
the detailed design. The resettlement fund will be financed and paid by the executing agency as 
a part of the total project investment. A compensation agreement will be negotiated and entered 
into  with  the  village  /  community  committees  and  the  affected  HHs  during  the  LAR 
implementation. 
97. 
Institutional Arrangements. The Xinyu City Government is the executing agency of the 
Project  and  has  established  the  Project  Leading  Group  (PLG)  to  be  wholly  responsible  for 
comprehensive  planning  and  decision-making  for  the  Project.  Xinyu  Urban  and  Rural 
Construction Investment Group Company, Ltd. (XURCIG) is the implementing agency, and the 
PMO  is  responsible for  management  and  coordination  of  the  project.  The  Resettlement  Office 
33 The households whose per capita farmland is no more than 0.3 mu. 
39 
(Comprehensive  Department  under  the  XURCIG), a subsidiary unit of  the XURCIG,  is  the 
resettlement  implementation  agency  and  responsible  for  the  implementation  of  the  RP  along 
with affected sub-districts and communities, while the towns and villages in the project area will 
provide assistance in the preparation and implementation of the RP. 
98. 
To ensure smooth implementation, the staff in charge of LAR will undertake training on 
resettlement implementation to be organized by the PMO. A resettlement start-up consultant will 
provide training in ADB’s policy requirements and will assist the implementing agency and PMO 
to  update  and  finalize  the  RP.  The  RP  will  be  (i)  updated  based  on  the  final  design,  detailed 
measurement survey and census of APs, (ii) disclosed to affected persons, and (iii) submitted to 
ADB  for  review  and approval  prior  to the  award  of  civil  works  contract  and  commencement of 
land acquisition or house demolition. 
The resettlement implementation schedule has been prepared based on the preparation 
99. 
and construction timetable (see Table 17).  
100.  Grievance  Redress  Mechanism.  A  grievance  redress  mechanism  (GRM)  has  been 
developed in compliance with ADB’s SPS (2009) requirement to address environmental, health, 
safety, and social concerns associated with project construction, operation, and land acquisition 
arrangements.  The  details  of  the  GRM,  including  a  time-bound  flow  chart  of  procedures,  are 
included  in  the  project  EMP  and  RP;  the  complaint  channels  are  slightly  different  for 
environmental  and  resettlement  issues,  but  the  PMO  will  maintain  an  integrated  system  to 
document, follow-up and reports on all cases.  
101.  Persons  affected  by  LAR  may  file  an  appeal  on  any  aspect  of  resettlement,  including 
compensation rates, etc. The means of appeal, and the names, locations, persons responsible 
and telephone numbers of the appeal accepting agencies will be communicated to the  APs at 
meetings,  through  an  announcement  or  the  resettlement  information  booklet,  so  that  the 
affected persons know their right of appeal. Mass media will be used to strengthen publicity and 
reporting,  and  comments  and  suggestions  on  resettlement  from  all  parties  concerned  will  be 
shared by the resettlement organization. All agencies will accept grievances and appeals from 
the  affected  people  for  free,  and  costs  so  reasonably  incurred  will  be  disbursed  from  the 
contingency costs.  
102.  During  the  design  and  implementation  periods  of  the  project,  these  appeal  procedures 
will remain effective to ensure that the affected people can use them to address relevant issues. 
Affected  persons  can  also submit  complaints  to ADB  which will  first  be  handled  by  the  project 
team.  If  an  affected  person  is  still  not  satisfied  and  believes  he/she  has  been  harmed  due  to 
non-compliance  with  ADB  policy,  s/he  may  submit  a  complaint  to  ADB’s  Accountability 
Mechanism.34 
103.  Monitoring  and  Evaluation.  A  detailed  plan  for  both  the  internal  and  external 
monitoring  is  included  in  the  resettlement  plan.  PMO  will  include  a  summary  of  internal 
monitoring  in  the  semi-annual  project  progress  reports  submitted  to  ADB.  Furthermore,  PMO 
will  employ  an  external  resettlement  monitoring  institute  or  firm  to  monitor  and  evaluate 
resettlement  progress  and  results.  A  baseline  survey  for  a  sample  of  affected  persons  will  be 
completed  before  the  LAR  begins.  After  that,  semiannual  monitoring  reports  will  be  prepared 
and  submitted  for  ADB’s  review  during  resettlement  implementation  and  annual  reports  within 
two years after completion of resettlement.

Indigenous Peoples 
18. 
The safeguard category for indigenous peoples is C in accordance with ADB’s SPS. Ethnic 
minorities make  up  very  small  percentage  of  the  population  in  Xinyu  City  where  there  are  0.34% 
minority  people.  The  poverty  and  social  assessment  and  consultations  have  confirmed  that  there 
are  no  communities  of  ethnic  minorities  in  the  project  area  that  would  trigger  ADB’s  Indigenous 
Peoples policy.

VIII.   GENDER AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS 
A. 
Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy 
104.  The project area covers 1 sub-district (Yangtiangang Sub-District), 3 townships (Guanchao, 
Ouli  and Xiacun)  and  1 district (Yushui)  with a total  of  35  villages  in  the  project  area  with 16,302 
households consisting of 55,762 persons, who will be benefited by the project. The project will also 
benefit new residents in the new high speed railway (HSR) subdistrict, estimated to be an additional 
57,000 people by 2020 and an additional 130,000 people by 2030.  
105.  Consultations  with  the  local  people  and  village  leaders  revealed  that  the  communities 
located along the Kongmu River and adjacent to the lakes always experienced floods during heavy 
rains that caused severe damage to agricultural crops and great economic loss. Based on a social 
survey  conducted  by  the  PPTA  consultants  in  April  2016  with  a  total  of  200  sample  households, 
approximately  69%  of  households  rely  on  agriculture  for  their  livelihoods,  with  an  average  land 
holding size of 1.2 mu (0.08 ha) and an average annual household income of CNY6,646.00. Over 
60%  of  the  households’  income  is  derived  from  non-farm  earnings.  About  15%  of  the  200 
respondents  had  an  average  annual  income  below  CNY2,968,  which  is  the  poverty  line  in  Xinyu 
City.  The  percentage  of households having  access  to  piped water  is  25%  and  the majority  (75%) 
had access to well and spring water in Yushui District. Key problems identified in the project area 
include flooding, solid waste and wastewater, poor water quality in the river and lakes. About 88% 
of  the  200  surveyed  households  in  the  project  area  have  no  existing  connection  to  the  sewerage 
system. 
B. 
Gender Action Plan 
106.  The  project  has  been  designed  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming  (EGM).  Women  focus 
group  discussions  found  that  environmental  improvements  are  anticipated  to  have  a  significant 
gender  impact,  with  reduced  time  burdens  and  costs  for  healthcare,  preparation  for  floods,  and 
clean-up  after  floods;  and  with  overall  improvement  of  surroundings.  The  project  will  also  create 
women’s employment opportunities. A gender action plan (GAP) has been prepared to ensure that 
women  are  kept  fully  informed  and  consulted  throughout  the  project  and  gain  maximum  benefits 
from  the  project.  Gender  specific  indicators  have  also  been  included  in  the  project’s  design  and 
monitoring  framework.  The  GAP  includes  measures  to  address  gender  concerns  in  all  project 
components  and  capacity  development,  which  include  (i)  ensuring  that  there  will  be  sufficient 
project  management  support  with  appropriate  awareness  of  gender  issues  to  effectively  oversee 
the implementation and monitoring of the GAP; (ii) ensuring the effective inclusion of women in all 
project activities; and (iii) ensuring that the targets set for the employment of women are met.  
107.  The  GAP  includes  provisions  to  ensure  that  staff  of  the  executing  and  implementing 
agencies  and  PMO  are  fully  oriented  on  the  ADB  policy  on  gender  and  development,  gender 
mainstreaming, and GAP specific indicators and monitoring and reporting at the commencement of 
project implementation. The staff responsible for GAP will coordinate with concerned agencies such 
as  women’s  federations,  contractors,  and  community  office  staff  to  facilitate  the  participation  of 
women in project activities. The staff will also ensure (i) gender disaggregated baseline and survey 
data will be collected, (ii) the GAP is implemented, monitored, and reported to ADB through semi-
annual  progress  reports.  Social  development  specialist  engaged  for  project  management  support 
will  mentor  the  staff  as  necessary,  and  facilitate  achievement  of  the  project’s  gender  and 
development  objectives.  The  progress  on  GAP  will  be  reviewed  during  ADB  review  missions, 
including support of ADB’s social development specialist as necessary. GAP is included in Table 18 
below.

C. 
Social Development Action Plan 
108.  A social development action plan (SDAP) has been prepared to enhance positive impacts of 
the project and mitigate negative impacts. It presents the specific activities and indicators to ensure 
social  inclusion  and  will  benefit  the  local  people  including  women,  and  low  income  households 
living in the project area. 
109.  The SDAP presents the following specific activities.  
a.  Community Mobilization and Participation Activities  
110.  This is essential to ensure that local people including women, and low-income households 
will  have access to the project  benefits  during  implementation  and  operation  stage  across  project 
outputs  especially  in  non-structural  measures.  Jobs  will  be  generated  to  provide  opportunities for 
the  local  people  including  women,  affected  people  and  low-income  households  to  work  and  earn 
income during project implementation and operation. The contractors will be encouraged to support 
this.  The  PMO  social  and  gender  staff  together  with  the  loan  implementation  consultants  shall 
conduct  community  mobilization  activities  in  the  project  areas  before  and  during  project 
implementation.  
b.  Conduct Consultations using Community Participation Approach 
111.  Consultations with the project beneficiaries, affected people, and other stakeholders in the 
project areas will be conducted prior to project implementation. Participatory strategies will be used 
(i.e.  key-informant  interview,  focus  group  discussion,  consultation  meetings,  community  assembly 
meetings,  etc.)  with  the  affected  population/communities,  concerned  local  government  authorities 
including village leaders, government agencies, and other concerned stakeholders. The purpose of 
the  consultations  is  inform  the  concerned  stakeholders  about  the  project,  impacts  and  safeguard 
measures,  grievance  redress  mechanism,  and  their  perception  on  how  they  could  maximize 
benefits from the project. The contractors will be encouraged to hire local people including women 
during civil works and operation; and inform the communities of the job opportunities. Local people 
will  be  encouraged  to  participate  in  public  awareness  campaign,  training,  consultations  and 
decision-making processes. 
112.  There will be awareness training/campaign for the local people in the project areas on topics 
relevant  to  flood  management  systems  and  measures  with  specific  topics  on  flood  early  warning 
systems/emergency  response;  solid  waste  management,  environmental  management,  and  other 
relevant topics.  
c.  Capacity Building for Project Implementers and Community Local Residents 
113.  The  loan  implementation  consultants  will  assist  in  conducting  training  to  staff  of  executing 
and  implementing  agencies,  PMO  and  contractors  relevant  to  project  management,  safeguard 
policy,  gender  and  development,  monitoring  and  evaluation.  The  training  will  provide  the 
participants information about the ADB safeguards and social development policies, importance of 
gender mainstreaming, specific target indicators included in the SDAP and GAP, etc.  
114.  An  NGO  or  civil  society  organization  will  be  engaged  by  the  executing  and  implementing 
agencies  to  conduct  necessary  studies,  detailed planning  and  implementation of  community flood 
and  environmental  management  activities.  Community  flood  and  environmental  management 
teams (CFEMT) will be organized in selected pilot communities in the project areas. Each CFEMT 
shall  consists  of  at  least  3  community  residents  (including  30%  female)  and  shall  perform  the 
54 
following  tasks:  (a)  work  with  local  residents  to develop  and implement  community  environmental 
management  rules  to  promote  changes  of  public  behavior  toward  the  environment;  and  (b) 
disseminate to community residents along the Kongmu River flood forecasting and warning process 
and  plans  for  emergency  response  to  floods.  Training  for  the  relevant  staff  of  the  executing  and 
implementing  agencies,  study  tours  for  the  concerned  staff  in  relevant  agencies,  and  knowledge 
through 
dissemination  of 
workshops,  seminars,  etc.  will  also  be  conducted  in  the  project  under  Output  3.  A  total  of  ten 
villages will be included in the pilot activities and will be selected during the project implementation 
based  on  selection  criteria  including  the  following:  (i)  communities  that  experience  most  severe 
flood and environment risks; (ii) communities are willing to participate in the pilot activities; and (ii) 
communities have existing groups or can form groups to work in the pilot activities.

d.   Job Hiring in Civil Works During Project Implementation and Operation  
115.  The project entails civil works during implementation and operation. About 6,500 jobs with a 
total of 156,500 person days will be created during the construction stage, of which 125,200 person 
days will be for unskilled labor including women who shall comprise about at least 25% of the labor 
force.  The  project  will  also  provide  employment  opportunities  to  both  skilled  and  unskilled  labor 
during  the  operation  and  maintenance  stage,  estimated  to  achieve  about  51,678  person  days 
(17,226  person  days  for  unskilled  labor).  The  social  development  action  plan  matrix  including 
activities, target indicators, responsible agencies/ persons responsible, and time frame is in Table

Monitoring  
116.  Project  performance  monitoring. The project performance management system (PPMS) 
indicators,  their  relevance,  and  monitoring  practicalities  will  be  discussed  with  the  executing  and 
implementing  agencies  and  project  beneficiaries  during  project  implementation.  Disaggregated 
baseline data for output and outcome indicators gathered during project processing will be updated 
and  reported  through  the  quarterly  progress  reports  of  the  PMO  and  after  each  ADB  review 
mission.  The  semiannual  reports  will  provide  information  necessary  to  update  ADB's  project 
performance reporting  systems.35 At the  start  of  project  implementation,  the  implementing  agency 
and  PMO,  with  the  project  implementation  consulting  services,  will  develop  integrated  PPMS 
procedures to generate data systematically on the inputs and outputs of the components, as well as 
the  indicators  to  be  used  to  measure  the  project’s  impact  and  outcome  taking  into  account  the 
components’  scope.  The  PMO  will  be  responsible  for  monitoring  and  reporting  on  project 
performance.  The  basis  for  performance  monitoring  will  be  the  design  and  monitoring  framework 
(DMF),  which  identifies performance  targets for the  impact,  outcomes,  and  outputs  of the  project. 
By  collecting  data  from  the  sources  identified  in  the  DMF,  the  PMO  will  be  able  to  report  on  an 
annual basis the performance of the project. Specific reporting requirements will be set out in the 
loan  and  project  agreements  between  ADB  and  the  Government.  The  PMO  will  collect  the  data, 
calculate  the  indicators,  analyze  the  results,  and  prepare  a  brief  report  describing  the  extent  to 
which the project is generating the intended outputs and outcomes. The relevance and practicability 
of  data  collection  for  indicators  will  be  confirmed  with  the  implementing  agency  and  PMO. 
Meanwhile,  the  agreed  socioeconomic  and  environmental  indicators  to  be  used  will  be  further 
enhanced  to  measure  project  impacts.  The  implementing  agency  and  PMO  will  (i)  refine  and 
integrate  the  PPMS  framework  at  the  start  of  project  implementation;  (ii)  confirm  that  targets  are 
achievable;  (iii)  develop  recording,  monitoring,  and  reporting  arrangements;  and  (iv)  establish 
systems and procedures no later than six months after project inception. 
117.  Compliance  monitoring.  The  executing  and  implementing  agencies  and  the  project 
management consultants, will conduct compliance monitoring, and submit reports and information 
to  ADB  concerning  the  use  of  the  loan  proceeds,  project  implementation,  the  implementing 
agency’s  project  implementation  performance,  and  compliance  of  loan  and  project  covenants. 
These reports will include (i) quarterly progress reports on project implementation; and (ii) a project 
completion  report,  which  should  be  submitted  not  later  than  three  months  after  the  completion  of 
the  project.  The  compliance  status  of  loan  and  project  covenants  will  be  reported  and  assessed 
through quarterly progress report. ADB review missions will verify the status of compliance. 
118.  Safeguards monitoring: 
a. 
Environment 
119.  Three types of project monitoring will be conducted under the EMP: (i) internal monitoring – 
to be conducted by the implementing agency and the construction supervision companies (CSCs); 
(ii) external monitoring – of air, water, noise and soil standards – to be conducted by the local EMS; 
and  (iii)  compliance  monitoring  –  to  be  conducted  by  the  LIEC,  to  ensure  the  EMP  is  being 
implemented.  The  project  monitoring  program  is  in  Table  EMP-4  of  the  EMP  (Attachment  1). 
Monitoring shall comply with the PRC standards for environmental monitoring and quality. ADB will 
oversee  project  compliance  on  the  basis  of  the  semi-annual  environmental  monitoring  reports 
provided by the PMO and site visits as required.

the  PRC  Regulation  on  Project 
120.  Environmental  acceptance  reporting.  Following 
Completion  Environmental  Audit  (MEP,  2001),  within  three  months  after  the  completion  of  major 
components,  an  environmental  acceptance  report  for  each  shall  be  prepared  by  a  licensed 
environmental  monitoring  institute.  The  report  will  be  reviewed  and  approved  by  the  Xinyu  City 
Environmental  Protection  Bureau  and reported  to  ADB.  The  environmental  acceptance  reports  of 
the  component  completions  will  indicate  the  timing,  extent,  effectiveness  of  completed  mitigation 
and  of  maintenance,  and  the  needs  for  additional  mitigation  measures  and  monitoring  during 
operations. 
b. 
Resettlement 
121.  A detailed plan for both the internal and external monitoring is included in the resettlement 
plan. PMO will include a summary of internal monitoring in the semi-annual project progress reports 
submitted  to  ADB.  Furthermore,  PMO  will  employ  an  external  resettlement  monitoring  institute  or 
firm to monitor and evaluate resettlement progress and results. A baseline survey for  a sample of 
affected persons will be completed before the LAR begins. Semiannual external monitoring reports 
will be prepared and submitted for ADB’s review during resettlement implementation and annually 
for two years after completion of resettlement. PMO will submit a completion report after completion 
of LAR 
c. 
Gender and Social Development Action Plans  
122. 
 Monitoring of the gender action plan (GAP) and social development action plan (SDAP) will 
be  incorporated  into  the  PPMS.  Clear  targets  and  indicators  have  been  established  and  are 
included  in  the  GAP,  SDAP  and  in  the  DMF.  A  social  and  gender  specialist  will  be  hired  by  the 
executing agency to assist the PMO in the implementation and monitoring, and preparation of semi-
annual  reports  for  the  GAP  and  SDAP.  He  or  she  will  also  coordinate  with  the  NGO  that  will  be 
engaged  by  the  executing  agency/PMO  to  implement  the  community  flood  and  environmental 
management systems, and ensure that the gender target indicators are achieved. 
C.  
Evaluation 
123.  ADB,  XCG  and  the  XURCIG  will  undertake  a  semiannual  review  mission  to  evaluate  the 
progress  of  project  implementation.  ADB,  XCG  and  the  XURCIG  will  undertake  a  comprehensive 
midterm review two years after the start of project implementation to have a detailed evaluation of 
the  scope,  implementation  arrangements,  resettlement,  achievement  of  scheduled  targets,  and 
progress  on  the  agenda  for  policy  reform  and  capacity  building  measures.  Feedback  from  the 
PPMS  activities  will  be  analyzed.  Within  three  months  of  physical  completion  of  the  project,  the 
PMO will submit a project completion report to ADB.36 
D.  
Reporting  
124.  The  PMO  will  provide  ADB  with  (i)  quarterly  progress  reports  in  a  format  consistent  with 
ADB's project performance reporting system; (ii) consolidated annual reports including (a) progress 
targets,  (b)  key 
achieved  by  output  as  measured 
implementation 
(c)  updated  procurement  plan,  and  (d)  updated 
implementation plan for the next 12 months; and (iii) a project completion report within 6 months of 
physical  completion  of  the  project.  To  ensure  that  projects  will  continue  to  be  both  viable  and 
sustainable,  project  accounts  and  the  executing  agency  audited  financial  statement  together  with 
the associated auditor's report, should be adequately reviewed.

Stakeholder Communication Strategy  
127.  Project information will be communicated through public consultation, information disclosure 
mechanism  in  ADB’s  and  government’s  website,  meetings,  interviews,  focus  group  discussions, 
64 
and  community  consultation  meetings,  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  requirements  of  information 
disclosure policy. 
128.  Environment.  Meaningful  consultation,  participation  and  information  disclosure  was 
conducted  during  project  preparation.  Information  disclosure  and  public  consultation  included 
newspaper  disclosure;  informal  communication  with  key  stakeholders,  including  residents,  local 
authorities  and  sector  specific  institutions  and  authorities;  questionnaire  surveys;  and  wider 
stakeholder meetings attended by affected people and other concerned stakeholders. A GRM has 
been defined to prevent and address community concerns, reduce risks, and assist the project in 
maximizing environmental and social benefits.  
129. 
Involuntary resettlement. All of the affected households and towns/townships, leaders and 
town and township governments will be involved in the project impact and social-economic survey. 
Through  meetings,  interviews,  focus  group  discussions,  public  consultation  workshops,  and 
community  consultation  meetings,  local  representatives  have  participated  in  the  planning  and 
concerns  have  been  integrated  into  the  resettlement  plans.  Before  implementation,  the  PMO, 
XURCIG will further discuss and consult with the affected persons’ representatives the impacts on 
every town/township and the detailed compensation plan to ensure affected persons’ interests are 
protected and to provide employment opportunities for the affected persons’ livelihoods as a result 
of project implementation. The PMO and XURCIG will disclose the resettlement plan in the offices 
and  to  affected  people.  The  resettlement  plans  will  also  be  posted  on  the  ADB  website. 
Resettlement  information  booklets  were  distributed  to  affected  households.  This  contains 
information  such  as  the  affected  project  area,  proposed  land  acquisition  and  relocation 
implementation  progress  and  procedure,  compensation  standards  for  land  acquisition,  relocation 
assistance,  and  livelihood  restoration  strategy.  The  XURCIG  will  establish  a  project  resettlement 
unit  for  supervision  of  implementation,  continued  public  consultation,  monitoring  of  progress,  and 
response  to  grievances.  The  grievance  redress  procedures  will  be  established  and  explanations 
have been included in the resettlement information booklets. 
130.  Public  disclosure of  all  project  documents  will  be  undertaken  through  the XURCIG  and  on 
the ADB website including the project data sheet, DMF, IEE, resettlement plans, and the report and 
recommendation of the President. Disclosure of social and environmental monitoring reports will be 
undertaken during project implementation. 
131.  Consultations with communities and other stakeholders have taken place and will continue 
at  different  points  in  the  preparation  of  the  detailed  design  and  implementation  of  the  GAP  and 
SDAP within the components, and will be designed not only to inform people about the component 
or specific activities related to its preparation and implementation, but also to enable people in the 
community to know about the project and how they could maximize benefits from the project, ask 
questions,  make  suggestions,  state  preferences,  and  express  concerns.  Special  attention  will  be 
paid to the participation of women and other vulnerable groups, such as the poor. Consultations will 
also be conducted with other stakeholders such as the contractors, project implementers, and labor 
force including women to inform them about the GAP and provide them the necessary training on 
social safeguards, gender and core labor standards.

ANTICORRUPTION POLICY 
133.  ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any violations of the 
Anticorruption  Policy  relating  to  the  project. 37  All  contracts  financed  by  ADB  shall  include 
provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the 
executing  agency  and  all  project  contractors,  suppliers,  consultants,  and  other  service 
providers.  Individuals  and/or  entities  on  ADB’s  anticorruption  debarment  list  are  ineligible  to 
participate in ADB-financed activity and may not be awarded any contracts under the project.38  
134.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  are  included  in  the  loan  and  the  bidding 
documents for the project. 
XI. 
ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISM 
135.  People  who  are,  or may  in the future  be,  adversely  affected  by the  project  may  submit 
complaints  to  ADB’s  Accountability  Mechanism.  The  Accountability  Mechanism  provides  an 
independent  forum  and  process  whereby  people  adversely  affected  by  ADB-assisted  projects 
can voice, and seek a resolution of their problems, as well as report alleged violations of ADB’s 
operational  policies  and  procedures.  Before  submitting  a  complaint  to  the  Accountability 
Mechanism,  affected  people  should  make  an  effort  in  good  faith  to  solve  their  problems  by 
working with the concerned ADB operations department.  Only after doing that, and if they are 
still dissatisfied, should they approach the Accountability Mechanism.39

INDICATIVE TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR CONSULTINGSERVICES FOR  
PACKAGE CS1: PROJECT MANAGEMENT SUPPORT 
A. 
Introduction 
1. 
This  document  sets  out indicative  terms  of reference for  consulting  services needed to 
ensure the smooth implementation of the Jaingxi Xinyu Kongmu River Watershed Flood Control 
and  Environmental  Improvement  Project.  The  direct  client  of  the  consulting  services  is  the 
project  management  office  (PMO)  established  in  Xinyu  Urban  and  Rural  Construction 
Investment Group Company, Ltd. (XURCIG, implementing agency of the project) owned by the 
Xinyu city government (XCG, executing agency of the project) by 100%.  
B. 
Implementation Arrangements 
2. 
The consulting services for project management support will be carried out by a team of 
consultants through a firm. A total of 99.0 person-months of national consulting services will be 
required. The  consulting services will  be  financed by  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and the 
consultants  will  be  recruited  by  the  XURCIG  according  to  ADB’s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of 
Consultants  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  consulting  firm  will  be  selected  by  (i) 
inviting  simplified  technical  proposals;  and  (ii)  using  the  quality-  and  cost-based  selection 
method, with a quality–cost ratio of 80:20. The consulting services are expected to start in 1 July 
2017 and finish on loan closing date.  
C. 
Reporting Requirements 
3. 
The consultant team will produce (i) an inception report within 4 weeks of the start of the 
consulting  services,  (ii)  an  annual  report  by  the  end  of  each  year  during  2017−2022,  (iii)  draft 
project completion report (PCR) 2 months before the loan closing date, and (iii) a final PCR by 
loan  closing  date.  The  inception,  annual,  and  draft  final  reports  will  be  subject  to  tripartite 
reviews  by  ADB,  the  PMO,  and  the  consultants.  All  reports  are  to  be  written  in  English  and 
translated into Chinese. One soft and three scanned copies of each report are to be submitted 
to ADB (English version only) and the PMO (both Chinese and English versions).

This  document  sets  out  the  indicative  terms  of  reference  for  independent  external 
monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of land acquisition and resettlement (LAR) needed to ensure 
that the Jiangxi Xinyu Kongmu River Watershed Flood Control and Environmental Improvement 
Project  is  implemented  in  conformity  with  the  People’s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  laws  and 
regulations  and  the  Asian  Development  Bank’s  (ADB’s)  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009), 
including  involuntary  resettlement.  The  direct  client  of  the  consulting  services  is  the  project 
management  office  (PMO)  established  in  Xinyu  Urban  and  Rural  Construction  Investment 
Group  Company,  Ltd.  (XURCIG,  implementing  agency  of  the project)  owned by  the Xinyu city 
government (executing agency of the project) by 100%.  
B. 
Implementation Arrangements 
2. 
The  external  resettlement  M&E  will  be  carried  out  by  a  team  of  specialists  through  a 
competent independent external monitoring agency (EMA). The M&E will be financed by ADB, 
and the team of specialists will be recruited by the PMO according to ADB’s Guidelines on the 
Use  of  Consultants  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  through  consultants’  qualifications 
selection. The PMO and XURCIG will provide assistance to the EMA, particularly in the aspects
