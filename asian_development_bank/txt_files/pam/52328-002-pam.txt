Project Administration Manual Purpose and Process 
1.  The  project  administration  manual  (PAM)  describes  the  essential  administrative  and 
management requirements to implement the project on time, within budget, and in accordance 
with the policies and procedures of the government and Asian Development Bank (ADB). The 
PAM should include references to all available templates and instructions either through linkages 
to relevant URLs or directly incorporated in the PAM. 
2.  The Maharashtra Rural Road Development Association (MRRDA) is wholly responsible for the 
implementation of the ADB-financed project, as agreed jointly between the borrower and ADB, 
and in accordance with the policies and procedures of the government and ADB. ADB staff is 
responsible for supporting implementation including compliance by MRRDA of their obligations 
and  responsibilities  for  project  implementation  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  policies  and 
procedures. 
3.  At loan negotiations, the borrower and ADB shall agree to the PAM and ensure consistency with 
the loan agreement. Such agreement shall be reflected in the minutes of the loan negotiations. 
In the event of any discrepancy or contradiction between the PAM and the loan agreement, the 
provisions of the loan agreement shall prevail. 
4.  After ADB Board approval of the project's report and recommendation of the President (RRP), 
changes in implementation arrangements are subject to agreement and approval pursuant to 
relevant government and ADB administrative procedures (including the Project Administration 
Instructions) and upon such approval, they will be subsequently incorporated in the PAM. 
I.  
PROJECT DESCRIPTION  
1. 
The Maharashtra Rural Connectivity Improvement Project—Additional Financing will scale 
up improvement of rural connectivity with an additional 1,100 climate-resilient all-weather roads 
and 230 bridges totaling 2,900 kilometers (km) in 34 districts of the State of Maharashtra.1 The 
roads and bridges will connect rural habitations, productive agricultural lands and markets, and 
economic  growth  centers  across  the  state.  The additional  financing  is  aimed to accelerate the 
state’s coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) economic recovery by generating rural employment 
and  transforming  agriculture.  The  roads  and  bridges  will  connect  rural  settlements,  productive 
agricultural lands and markets, and economic growth centers across the state. This will enhance 
agricultural  productivity and  food  security;  strengthen agricultural  value chains,  building  on the 
state’s  advanced  agriculture  marketing  reforms;  and  help  increase  the  average  growth  rate  of 
agriculture and allied activities to more than 5% per year by 2030, which is a target of the state’s 
strategic development plan, Vision 2030.2 
The proposed project is being financed and implemented in a phased approach with $200 
2. 
million ongoing loan and $300 million for proposed additional financing.3 The phased approach 
helps to augment ADB financing upon developing institutional capacity of the executing agency.4 
The  additional  financing  scope  is  strongly  linked  to  the  ongoing  project’s  scope  and  both  are 
implemented under the same implementation arrangements.  
3. 
The proposed additional financing project will scale up the ongoing project’s outputs by (i) 
expanding improvement and maintenance of rural roads under output 1 by 1,100 roads and 230 
bridges  with  the  total  length  of  2,900  km;  (ii)  adding  further  piloting  of  new  technologies  such 
asphalt blended with plastic waste and pre-cast concrete arch bridges under output 1; and (iii) 
adding  the  following  under  output  2:  (a)  impact  evaluation  study  and  (b)  mobile  mapping 
monitoring tool. The outputs of the overall project (both ongoing and additional financing projects) 
are:  
(i) 
Output  1:  Conditions  and  safety  of  selected  rural  roads  improved  and 
maintained with climate resilience and safety features. The overall project will 
improve the condition of about 5,000 km of rural roads, including 230 bridges—
connecting 
rural  communities  with  productive  agricultural  areas  and 
socioeconomic  centers—to  all-weather  standards,  with  climate  resilience  and 
safety features.5 The roads were selected based on population, economic activity, 
and  road  connectivity.  The  designs  of  roads  and  bridges  were  developed  and 
refined  through  intensive  stakeholder  consultation  and  incorporated  climate 
resilience measures such as improved cross and side drainage, increased surface 
elevations,  and  stronger  embankments  in  the  designs.  Environment-friendly 
alternative  sealing  options,  such  as  asphalt  blended  with  plastic  waste,  will  be 
piloted  on  selected  road  segments.  Other  new  technologies,  such  as  fiber-
reinforced  concrete  and  pre-cast  concrete  arch  bridge,  will  also  be  piloted  for 
1  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) supported project preparation under the technical assistance (TA) facility for 
India: Strengthening Capacity to Design and Implement Water and Rural Infrastructure Facility (TA 9738-IND). 
2  State Government of Maharashtra, Planning Department. 2018. Vision 2030. Mumbai. 
3   The Ministry of Finance requested for $500 million ADB assistance in a letter dated 13 September 2018. 
4  ADB provided an attached technical assistance to the ongoing project to improve road asset management system 
to enhance sustainability of road assets (ADB. 2019. Technical Assistance to India for Institutional Strengthening of 
the Maharashtra Rural Road Sector for Sustainable Development ($1.0 million). Manila). 
5  Roads were selected from the priority list of the district road development plans. Safety measures include cautionary 
and information signs, guard posts, and speed breakers. 
3 
further practical application in similar settings. Operation and maintenance of the 
roads  and  bridges  will  be  covered  under  contractual  maintenance  for  5  years 
following construction.6 
(ii) 
Output 2: Capacity of rural infrastructure agency and awareness among road 
users in the state enhanced. The overall project will deliver (i) manuals for design, 
construction,  and  maintenance  of  climate-resilient  and  gender-inclusive  rural 
roads; (ii) an information technology-based implementation and monitoring system 
with  a  mobile  mapping  tool;  (iii)  training  of  the  Maharashtra  Rural  Road 
Development  Association  (MRRDA)  on  road  safety,  road  asset  management, 
contract  management,  and  climate-resilient  design  and  construction;  (iv)  impact 
evaluation of the project benefits through baseline and end-line surveys; and (v) 
training of road users and local residents on (a) improving road users’ awareness 
on road safety and gender-based violence (including sexual exploitation, human 
trafficking, and sexually transmitted infections); and (b) enhancing women workers’ 
road construction and maintenance skills. 
4. 
These outputs will result in the following outcome: road transport efficiency in 34 districts 
in  Maharashtra  increased. 7 The  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  quality,  reliable, 
sustainable, safe, and affordable roads that provide equitable access for all developed (footnote 
2). The overall aggregate impact and outcome of the project remains unchanged from the ongoing 
project. An outcome indicator has changed as a result of scaling up by the additional financing. 
6  The same contractors that build the roads will perform routine maintenance for 5 years. The government will finance 
all maintenance costs.  
7  The  design  and  monitoring  framework  is  in  Section  IX:  Performance  Monitoring,  Evaluation,  Reporting  and 
Communication.

The  state government  will  provide  MRRDA  with sufficient  budget  to  finance the project 
expenditures. Subsequently, MRRDA will claim the share of expenditures to be covered by ADB 
on a reimbursement basis by submitting withdrawal applications through the borrower to ADB. 
ADB will pay the borrower out of the loan, and the borrower will channel the funds to the state 
government.

Financial Management Assessment (FMA) 
V. 
FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT  
The FMA was conducted in 2019 and updated in March 2020, in accordance with Financial 
11. 
Due  Diligence:  a  Methodology  Note,  and  Technical  Guidance  Notes  (ADB). 9 The  FMA  has 
reviewed  the  capacity  of  MRRDA,  which  will  implement  the  project,  including  fund  flow 
arrangements,  governance,  staffing,  budgeting,  accounting  and  financial  reporting  systems, 
internal  control  procedures,  financial  information  systems,  and  internal  and  external  audit 
arrangements.  
12. 
The State of Maharashtra, acting through MRRDA, will be the executing agency. MRRDA 
has  considerable  experience  in  implementing  rural  road  development  programs  including  the 
PMGSY and MMGSY as well as the ongoing ADB-assisted project. Under the project, MRRDA 
through its project management unit (PMU) will coordinate and oversee the financial management 
activities undertaken by the six regional offices and the 34 PIUs located in the districts.  
13. 
 The FMA found that MRRDA has adequate financial management capacity to: (i) record 
the  required  financial  transactions,  (ii)  provide  reliable  annual  financial  statements  and  audit 
reports  in  a  timely  manner,  (iii)  safeguard  the  financial  assets  and  (iv)  use  the  statement  of 
expenditure (SOE) procedure under ADB’s disbursement procedures up to a threshold of USD 
200,000 for each expenditure item. However, the assessment also identified the following risks: 
(i) insufficient number of financial staff in the PMU, (ii) limited experience in ADB procedures and 
reporting requirements, and (iii) decentralized flow of funds to the regions. As a result, the overall 
financial management risk is assessed as moderate.  
14. 
The identified risks will be mitigated by: (i)  hiring an FM expert to support the PMU, (ii) 
ensuring continuous training in ADB’s systems and procedures, (iii) ensuring quarterly financial 
reporting and quarterly internal audits, as well as (iv) adopting project specific FM procedures. 
Moreover, MRRDA will maintain separate books of accounts for the additional financing project 
and the project financial statements will be audited annually by an auditor acceptable to ADB, 
following auditing standards acceptable to ADB.

Mitigation Measures or Action Plans 
–  The works are monitored by 34 PIUs which 
have already been established. 
–  MRRDA will implement the project through its 
PMU. The FM arrangements of the PMU will be 
further strengthened as described below.  
2.  Fund Flow 
S 
– Decentralized flow of 
funds. 
–  ADB’s disbursement will follow reimbursement 
procedure and no ADB funds will be channeled 
to the PIUs.  
3.  Staffing 
4.  Accounting Policies 
and Procedures 
– Delay in release 
–  All WAs will be prepared by the PMU and all 
counterpart funds to the 
project.  
supporting documentation will be kept centrally. 
MRRDA to ensure with the immediate release 
of the replenishment of funds from the State 
Government of Maharashtra for the funds 
received from ADB on reimbursement basis. 
S 
– Increased workload due 
to the project. 
– Lack of experience with 
ADB procedures and 
requirements. 
–  The capacity of the PMU to be strengthened by  
engaging a national FM expert exclusively to 
the ADB projects to support the PMU 
throughout the project life. 
–  ADB to provide continuous training in ADB 
policies, systems, and procedures. 
M 
– The  accounting  policies 
and  procedures  require 
supplemental 
some 
guidance. 
–  PMGSY FM policies are in place and an ADB 
specific FM manual was developed as part of 
the ongoing project. The manual may need to 
be finetuned to consider the Additional 
Financing project to ensure ADB’s 
requirements are met at all levels. 
5. 
Internal Audit 
M 
-The internal audit is 
conducted on semi-annual 
basis only. The internal 
audits are experiencing 
some delays due to the 
COVID-19 lockdowns. 
–  Chart of accounts to be updated for the 
additional financing project. 
–  The internal audit firm engaged by the MRRDA 
to include the Additional financing in its audit 
plan and conduct audits on quarterly basis on 
and report to the audit review committee within 
45 days after the reporting period. Quarterly 
audits need to be resumed as soon as the 
COVID 19-lock down is over. This needs to be 
monitored by ADB.

MRRDA shall conduct quarterly reconciliation of the project accounts, and ADB’s disbursement 
data available in the LFIS.   
28. 
Any discrepancies and/or reconciliation items will be promptly followed-up on to ensure 
these are resolved in a prompt manner. Furthermore, any differences between amounts claimed 
and the amounts disbursed will be disclosed and explained in the WA register, in the quarterly 
progress reports and in the notes of the project financial statements.

30. 
explained in the QPRs and in the notes of the project financial statements. 
D. 
Auditing and Public Disclosure 
31.  MRRDA will cause the detailed consolidated project financial statements to be audited by 
an auditor appointed from the panel approved by the CAG of India and in accordance with the 
audit standards issued by the CAG and Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI), which 
are acceptable to ADB. The audited financial statements will be submitted in the English language 
to ADB within 6 months of the end of the fiscal year by the executing agency. 
25 
The audit report for the project financial statements will include a management letter and 
32. 
auditor’s opinions, which cover (i) whether the project financial statements present an accurate 
and fair view or are presented fairly, in all material respects, in accordance with the applicable 
financial  reporting  standards;  and (ii)  whether  the proceeds  of the  loan were  used  only for the 
purpose  of  the  project.  From  the  second  audit  onwards,  the  management  letter  will  include  a 
follow-up on the implementation status of previous audit recommendations (where applicable). In 
case the auditor does not issue a management letter, the auditor must issue a confirmation that 
no internal control issues were identified as part of the audit. 
33. 
Compliance with financial reporting and auditing requirements will be monitored by review 
missions and during normal program supervision, and followed up regularly with all concerned, 
including the external auditor.  
34. 
The state government and MRRDA have been made aware of ADB’s approach to delayed 
submission, and the requirements for satisfactory and acceptable quality of the audited project 
financial  statements.14 ADB  reserves the  right  to  require  a  change  in  the  auditor  (in  a  manner 
consistent with the constitution of the borrower), or for additional support to be provided to the 
auditor, if the audits required are not conducted in a manner satisfactory to ADB, or if the audits 
are  substantially  delayed.  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  verify  the  project's  financial  accounts  to 
confirm  that  the  share  of  ADB’s  financing  is  used  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  policies  and 
procedures.  
35. 
 Public  disclosure  of  the  audited  project  financial  statements,  including  the  auditor’s 
opinion on the project financial statements, will be guided by ADB’s Access to Information 2018.15 
After the review, ADB will disclose the audited project financial statements and the opinion of the 
auditors on the project financial statements no later than 14 days of ADB’s confirmation of their 
acceptability  by  posting  them  on  ADB’s  website.  The  Management  letter,  additional  auditor’s 
opinions, and audited entity financial statements will not be disclosed.16 
36. 
In addition to  the  external  audit  described above,  an  audit firm  will  be  hired  to  conduct 
quarterly internal audits and reporting to the audit committee within 45 days after the end of the 
reporting period. The scope of the internal audit will focus in particular on the financial activities 
carried out the regional offices and PIUs. The audit committee will consider key issues pointed 
out by the auditors and ensure timely resolution of observations by project management.
14 ADB’s approach and procedures regarding delayed submission of audited project financial statements:  
(i)  When audited project financial statements are not received by the due date, ADB will write to the executing 
agency advising that (a) the audit documents are overdue; and (b) if they are not received within the next 6 
months, requests for new contract awards and disbursement such as new replenishment of advance accounts, 
processing of new reimbursement, and issuance of new commitment letters will not be processed. 
(ii)  When  audited  project  financial  statements  are  not  received  within  6  months  after  the  due  date,  ADB  will 
withhold processing of requests for new contract awards and disbursement such as new replenishment of 
advance accounts, processing of new reimbursement, and issuance of new commitment letters. ADB will (a) 
inform the executing agency of ADB’s actions; and (b) advise that the loan may be suspended if the audit 
documents are not received within the next 6 months. 
(iii)  When audited project financial statements are not received within 12 months after the due date, ADB may 
suspend the loan.

PROCUREMENT AND CONSULTING SERVICES 
A. 
Procurement Capacity Assessment of MRRDA 
1. 
Summary of the Procurement Assessment 
37.  Maharashtra is one of the states in India which has become a part of ADB funding for the 
rural roads in India as MMGSY. MMGSY is on similar lines as PMGSY. Having completed the 
PMGSY program under PMGSY 1 and in the process of completing the roads under PMGSY 2, 
the state has programed MMGSY for undertaking 30,000 km of rural roads in 5 years from the 
year 2015–2016 to 2019–2020. MMGSY has already completed upgrading around 12,000 km of 
roads under this scheme. All procurements for the civil works, for the consulting services contracts 
and  maintenance  beyond  five  years  of  completion  of  rural  roads  are  being  carried  out  as 
mandated by the Government of India by resorting to e-procurement in all the states including 
Maharashtra with effect from 1 April 2009.   
2. 
Risks and Recommendations for Mitigation of Risks 
38. 
The state has adequate experience in e-procurement for about a decade. For the ongoing 
project,  certain  modifications  were  incorporated  in  the  standard  bidding  document  (SBD)  to 
include social safeguards, environment and road safety aspects.17 These will also be applied for 
packages under the additional financing project. The performance in procurement for the ongoing 
project was exceptionally good in that all the 195 contracts put to bid have been awarded in a 
short time and the civil works are under progress. However, this additional financing project is the 
first  time  that  bridges  have  been  included  in  the  civil  works  apart  from  short  span  bridges  in 
ongoing project. Long bridges are introduced into the additional financing scope because of the 
heavy damages incurred during unprecedented floods in Maharashtra experienced in the third 
quarter of 2019. During these floods, rural connectivity was severely affected and a request was 
made to ADB by the Government of Maharashtra to include the longer bridges in the scope of 
work and also considering the anticipated impacts of climate change. Though the procurement 
risks for these bridges are considered low ADB will be proactive to ensure the proper uptake and 
understanding by all concerned, including:  
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
prior review of the first bidding documents for roads and bridges of six regions;  
prior reviews of technical and financial evaluation of the above packages; and  
post review (sampling)  after  award of  20%  and  70%  of total  contracts for  roads 
and bridges separately. Post review will be conducted on sample basis of 34 and 
30 contract packages for roads and bridges respectively, one from each PIU.  
39. 
The project will continue to take all necessary steps to ensure that procurement capacity 
built  into  the  PMGSY  program  is  maintained  throughout  the  implementation  of  the  project.  All 
these measures will reduce anticipated risks.  
B. 
Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing 
All  advance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  will  be  undertaken  in  conformity  with 
40. 
ADB’s  Procurement  Policy  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)18 and  ADB’s  Procurement 
Regulations for ADB Borrowers: Goods, Works, Nonconsulting and Consulting Services (2017, 
17   Loan 3805-IND: Maharashtra Rural Connectivity Improvement Project (MRCIP), which ADB financing amounts to 
$200 million. 
18   Available at: https://www.adb.org/documents/adb-procurement-policy. 
27 
as amended from time to time).19 The issuance of invitations to bid under advance contracting 
and  retroactive  financing  will  be  subject  to  ADB  approval.  The  borrower,  executing  and 
implementing agencies have been advised that approval of advance contracting and retroactive 
financing does not commit ADB to finance the project. 
41. 
Retroactive financing will be provided to finance expenditures incurred under the project 
before  the  effectiveness  date,  but  not  earlier  than 12  months  before  the date  of  signing  of the 
Loan Agreement in connection with works, subject to a maximum amount equivalent to 20% of 
the loan amount.

Procurement of Goods, Works, and Consulting Services 
All procurement of goods and works financed wholly or in part by ADB will be undertaken 
42. 
in accordance with ADB’s Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and ADB’
s  Procurement  Regulations  for  ADB  Borrowers:  Goods,  Works,  Nonconsulting  and  Consulting

43. 
For the road construction or upgrading and construction of bridges, the additional financing 
project will be following open competitive bidding (OCB) procurement procedure based on item 
unit  rates  similar  to  the  one  approved  by  ADB  for  the  ongoing  project. 20 SBD  (improved  in 
agreement with ADB) and electronic mode of procurement will be used for all road  and bridge 
construction contracts and will be advertised locally.21 Bidders will be post-qualified by applying 
single-stage,  two-envelope  bidding  procedure.  Contracts  will  include  civil  works  and  post-
construction  maintenance  for  5  years.  Further  details  are  specified  in  the  procurement  plan 
provided in Attachment C.

Assistance to India for the Maharashtra Rural Connectivity Improvement Project. Manila. 
21   Approval of using e-Procurement System installation in Maharashtra for use in ADB-financed projects was granted 
by ADB on 29 April 2019.  
28        
The following approval procedures will be adopted for road construction or upgrading, and 
44. 
the same procedure will also be adopted for bridge construction separately intended for financing 
under the project:  
(i) 
ADB  will  review  the  first  bidding  document  for  one  contract  package from  each 
region (i.e. six packages) prior to the start of procurement under the project;  
ADB will review technical bid evaluation reports for the above six civil work contract 
packages prior to the financial bid opening (summary reporting form on technical 
bid evaluation is in Attachment D);22  
Upon ADB clearance of the technical bid evaluation reports, MRRDA will proceed 
with the financial bid opening and evaluation and submit financial bid evaluation 
reports for the same six civil work contract packages to ADB for clearance before 
the  contract  award  (summary  reporting  form  on  financial  bid  evaluation  is  in 
Attachment E);23  
If  ADB  finds  financial  bid  evaluation  for  the  six  contract  packages  satisfactory, 
MRRDA  will  proceed  with  evaluating  and  awarding  of  subsequent  contract 
packages  under  the  project  without  prior  ADB  review  and  approval  (sample 
summary sheet of bid evaluation and contract award is in Attachment F);   
At  the  time  of  each  contract  award,  MRRDA  will  provide  ADB  with  a  certified 
summary sheet reporting on the main aspects of the bid evaluation and contract 
award (reporting form is in Attachment G);  
The procurement processes and contract awards will be reviewed at random for 
each PIU upon the award of at least 20% and 70% of contracts; and 
In these cases, the following guidelines will apply: 
a. 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
(v) 
(vi) 
(vii) 
The borrower must retain all documentation with respect to each contract 
where post review (sampling) was adopted during project implementation 
and for at least 1 year after the project closing date. This documentation 
generally  includes  advertisements  or  procurement  notices  (such  as  the 
request  for  expressions  of  interest  or  invitation  for  prequalification,  and

e. 
If ADB determines that the goods, works, or services were not procured in 
accordance  with  the  agreed  procedures  as  reflected  in  the  procurement 
plan, or an action by a borrower amounted to noncompliance, it may take 
appropriate  action  consistent  with  paras.  1.29  and  1.30  of  the  2017 
Procurement  Regulations  and  the  Guidance  Note  on  Noncompliance  in 
Procurement. 
Since  noncompliance  may  mean  refunding  if  amounts  have  been 
disbursed, post review (sampling) should be conducted in a timely manner 
so that corrective measures may be taken.

SAFEGUARDS 
47. 
Prohibited investment activities. Pursuant to ADB’s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) 
(SPS), ADB funds may not be applied to the activities described on the ADB Prohibited Investment 
Activities List set forth at Appendix 5 of the SPS.  
A. 
Environment Safeguard  
The project is classified as category B in accordance with the classification system of the 
48. 
SPS. A single initial environmental examination (IEE) report was prepared for all 1,100 rural roads 
and 230 bridges. Key environmental impacts and risks from improving the rural roads and bridges 
are identified by means of environmental checklist and transect walks. Aside from both, Integrated 
Biodiversity  Assessment  Tool  and  government  reports  were  used  for  the  environment 
assessments and prepare the initial environmental examination. The results show that there are 
number  of  protected  and  key  biodiversity  areas  in  the  State  of  Maharashtra,  but  none 
is overlapping with  the  target  rural  roads  and  bridges.  None  of  the  proposed  rural  roads  and 
bridges are located near cultural heritage, wildlife protected areas and buffer zones, and natural 
habitats. No historical places and religious structures will be affected. All anticipated impacts are 
site specific and temporary. Anticipated environmental impacts are typical to road improvement 
activities such as the generation of dust and noise from vehicles and mix plants, minor waterway 
the  effective 
sedimentation,  and  occupational  health  and  safety  hazards.  To  ensure 
implementation of safeguards requirements, MRRDA will be supported by environmental experts 
at the regional level. A functioning GRM has been established under the ongoing project and the 
same  GRM  will  be  used  for  the  additional  financing. Similar  to the  ongoing  project,  safeguard 
monitoring reports will be on an annual basis for both construction and operation stages during 
the project period until project completion report is issued by ADB.

Social Safeguards: Involuntary Resettlement and Indigenous Peoples  
The project is categorized as C for involuntary resettlement. During project preparations, 
62. 
100%  of  the  project  was  screened  for  involuntary  resettlement  impacts.  No  involuntary  land 
acquisition,  physical  or  economic  displacement  is  required  for  the  project.  If  there  are 
unanticipated  impacts  identified  during  project  implementation,  the  borrower  will  prepare  and 
implement  a  resettlement  plan  to  address  such  impacts.  In  six  road  sections  and  six  bridge 
approaches,  strips  of  private  land  were  voluntarily  donated  by  titleholders  to  enable  minor 
widening of the road. The safeguard screening confirms that donated land represents less than 
5%  of  the  owner’s  land  holding.  The  land  was  donated  on  a  voluntary  basis  as  verified  by  an 
35 
independent third party. Details of the social safeguard screening along all roads are documented 
in the Social Safeguards Due Diligence Reports (SDDRs).26 
The project is categorized as C for Indigenous Peoples. During project preparations 100% 
63. 
of  the  project  was  screened  for  impacts  on  Indigenous  Peoples.  The  screening  confirms  that 
Indigenous Peoples (Scheduled Tribes) are present in the state as individual households living 
among  broader  communities  rather  than  distinct  communities.  The  project  will  not  directly  or 
indirectly  affect  the  dignity,  human  rights,  livelihood  systems,  or  culture  of  indigenous  peoples 
because  the  project  works  will  not  impact  territories  or  natural  or  cultural  resources  that 
indigenous peoples own, use, occupy, or claim as an ancestral domain or asset. Details of the 
social safeguard screening are documented in the SDDRs.

ensure preparation, submission, and review of social safeguard annual monitoring 
reports for disclosure on ADB and MRRDA websites; 
26   The SDDR was compiled adopting the community-based and participatory transect walk method frequently used in 
the design of ADB financed rural road projects. The method is described within this project’s Social Safeguards Due 
Diligence Guideline (SDDG). The SDDG is also commonly referred to as a “Community Participation Framework” 
and the SDDR as a “Community Participation Plan.” Here, the titles SDDR and SDDG are used to align with standard

D. 
Grievance Redress Mechanism 
69. 
A GRC will be organized by the MRRDA during the project design and preparation stage.  
This GRC will have three levels: PIU, Region, and PMU levels as illustrated in Table 17. The GRC 
provides a readily accessible organization and mechanisms to all project affected persons and 
stakeholders  in  voicing  concerns  and  lodging  complaints,  while  the  grievance  and  redressal 
mechanism defines a time-bound and transparent process to resolve social and environmental 
concerns linked to the project. The operational and administrative cost of the GRC will be provided 
by the MRRDA. 
70. 
The following describes the three-levels of GRC under the project:  
(i) 
First Level of GRC (Field level): A grievance redress committee will be formed at 
the Gram Panchayat level headed by the concerned MRRDA PIU Engineer and 
leader 
consisting  of  Head  of  Gram  Panchayat  (Sarpanch/Mukhiya)/local 
37 
nominated  by  Gram  Panchayat  (Chairperson),  representative  of  the  Gram 
Panchayat,  and Contractor’s Environment/Safeguard and Gender Focal Person. 
Most of the grievances received at this level would be local in nature and will be 
both  in  verbal  and  written  form.  The  GRC  at  the  field  level  will  keep  a  record 
including  date  of  the  GRC  meeting,  number  and  types  of  grievances  received, 
name of the complainant and time taken for redressal of the grievance. The First 
Level of GRC should ensure that at least 30% members in GRCs are women. 
(ii) 
Second  Level  of  GRC  (District  Level):  The  Second  Level  GRC  would  be 
established at the district (PIU) levelheaded by the respective Executive Engineer. 
A Grievance Register will be maintained at the PIU level documenting the date and 
type  of  grievance  received,  the  date  of  personal  hearing  provided  to  the 
complainant, the date when grievance was redressed or if not redressed date of 
forwarding the grievance to the GRC. All grievances that cannot be resolved at the 
PIU level and in cases where the complainant is not satisfied with the decision will 
be referred to the Project Level Committee (Head Office).  
The  GRC  will  meet  regularly,  at  least  once  a  month,  on  a  prefixed  date.  All 
grievances registered will be reviewed and resolved within four weeks of the date 
of  receipt  of  the  grievance.  The  complainant/petitioner  will  have  the  right  to  be 
heard  by  the  GRC  before  the  committee  gives  its  decision.  Communication,  in 
writing should be sent to the aggrieved person about the date, time and venue of 
the GRC meeting and make it known that s/he is entitled for personal hearing and 
that  representation  through  proxy  will  be  not  be  entertained.  Decisions  of  the 
district level GRC will be final unless an appeal is referred to the Chief Executive 
Officer,  MRRDA.  If  the  committee  is  unable  to  arrive  at  a  decision  through 
consensus,  the  matter  will  be  referred  to  the  appellate  authority  with  a  note  on 
opinion  of  the  committee  members.  The  complaint/concern  will  be  redressed  in

impact.  During  project  preparation,  extensive 
consultations  were  held  with  more  than  42,000  people  living  in  the  project  districts.  MRRDA 
carried out transect walks with community members, both women and men along all roads and 
all  bridge  locations.  The  community  members  including  elected  representatives  of  village 
Panchayat were overwhelmingly supportive of the project and expressed need to improve mobility 
between their village and commercial/industrial centers to increase economic and employment 
opportunities. Local communities expressed their belief that provision of all-weather roads and 
bridges  in  rural  areas  would  contribute  to  reducing  poverty.  It  is  expected  that  the  project  will 
generate about 3.1 million person-days of employment for local communities (of which 25% will 
be  for  women)  over  the construction  and maintenance  periods.  The project roads  will  improve 
farmers’ access to markets and service centers, which in turn will contribute towards improved 
agricultural productivity and will increase farmers’ incomes. All weather roads and construction of 
missing  bridges  will  also  promote  investment  in  agribusiness  and  agriculture  value  chain 
infrastructure. 
74. 
Gender. Overall, women were supportive of the project because of the potential access 
to  economic  opportunities  and  services  including  health  care  and  education.  The  project  is 
categorized effective gender mainstreaming. A GAP was prepared as shown in Table 18 outlining 
all project targets and indicators.27 The gender indicators will be included in project MIS/project 
performance and monitoring system (PPMS) and regularly updated with sex disaggregated data. 
A  Senior  Gender  Specialist  will  be  recruited  in  PMU  who  will  oversee  and  manage  six  SGS 
engaged (one in each of the six regions) by the project implementation support consultant (PISC) 
to ensure effective implementation, monitoring, and reporting of the GAP. A total of seven senior 
officers, specifically executive engineers, will be oriented on gender specific issues and GAP, and 
will be designated as gender focal points (one in the PMU and one in each of the six regions) to 
oversee effective implementation, monitoring and reporting of GAP activities. The progress on the 
GAP implementation will be reported every quarter with the project QPRs. Gender indicators will 
be  included  in  PPMS  and  regularly  updated  with  disaggregated  data.  The  GAP  reporting  and 
monitoring format is prepared (Attachment H).  
Labor.  Project  construction  is  expected to  generate  employment  opportunities for  local 
75. 
communities during the construction and maintenance phases. Provisions are in the bidding and 
contractual documents for the contractors to ensure that all the civil works comply with national 
core  labor  standards).  The  PISC  will  monitor  the  project’s  compliance  to  national  core  labor 
standards and report in the project QPRs.  
76. 
STI  and  human  trafficking.  The  proportion  of  project  requiring  large  and  non-local 
construction workforces is low. Therefore, the risk of spreading Sexually Transmitted Infections 
(STI)  (including  HIV/AIDs)  is  low.  The  social  assessment  undertaken  identified  no  significant 
social risks such as HIV/AIDS or human trafficking. MRRDA will ensure that civil works contractors 
disseminate information at worksites on the risks of sexually transmitted diseases. All contracts 
will include clauses on these undertakings, and the government will strictly monitor compliance 
during implementation. The civil works contractors must carry out STI (including HIV/AIDS) and 
human  trafficking  awareness  sessions  for  their  laborers  at  work  sites  as  part  of  their  contract. 
Completion of trainings will be monitored and reported by the SGS within the annual safeguard 
monitoring reports. 
27   GAP covers both ongoing and additional financing projects.

Monitoring  
81. 
Project performance monitoring. The achievement of the project performance targets 
will be assessed following the design and monitoring framework. MRRDA, assisted by the PISC, 
47 
will  use  the  existing  Works  Online  Management  Information  System  program  of  MRRDA  and 
modify  the  same  where  needed  for  the  indicators  to  be  monitored  to  include  (i)  agricultural 
produce; (ii) traffic volume; (iii) bus and freight transport fares; (iv) travel time or riding speed; (v) 
vehicle  operating  costs;  (vi)  surface  roughness;  and  (vii)  road  accidents.  In  addition, 
socioeconomic  secondary  data  will  be  obtained  at  the  divisional  level,  including  (a) number  of 
businesses; (b) household income; (c) vehicle ownership; (d) unemployment rate; (e) land value; 
(f) average travel time to schools; and (g) average travel time to hospitals. These indicators will 
be monitored before and after construction, both on the project roads and on some control roads. 
In  addition,  every  year  during  the  project  period,  MRRDA  will  also  monitor  the  (i) road 
maintenance budget; (ii) staff–km ratio of rural roads; and (iii) road maintenance cost per kilometer. 
Achievement  of  the  capacity  development  activities  will  also  be  monitored.  For  civil  works, 
progress  will  be  monitored  and  reported  monthly  by  the  PISC.  The  project  beneficiaries' 
satisfaction will be surveyed during and after project implementation. Disaggregated baseline data 
for output and outcome indicators gathered during project processing will be updated and reported 
through the QPRs from MRRDA, and after each ADB review mission. These quarterly reports will 
provide information necessary to update ADB's project performance reporting system.  
82. 
Compliance  monitoring.  Compliance with covenants  will  be  monitored  through  ADB's 
project  administration  missions–including  project  inception  mission  to  discuss  and  confirm  the 
timetable  for  compliance  with  the  loan  covenants;  project  review  missions  to  assess  the 
government's compliance with particular loan covenants and, where there is any noncompliance 
or delay, discuss proposed remedial measures with the government; and mid-term review mission, 
if necessary, to assess whether the covenants are still relevant or need to be changed, or waived 
due to changing circumstances.  
83. 
Procurement capacity monitoring. There will be a regular assessment and monitoring 
of MRRDA’s capacity to undertake procurement since there is a high number of contracts under 
the  project  (total  of  414  contracts).  This  will  help  ensure  that  the  contracts  are  successfully 
awarded and implemented. 
84. 
Environmental  safeguard  monitoring  and  reporting.  MRRDA  is  responsible  for 
undertaking  environmental  due  diligence  and  monitoring  the  implementation  of  environmental 
mitigation measures for all project roads and bridges.  
Environmental  Management  Plan  (EMP).  The  standard  EMP  outlines  measures  to 
85. 
mitigate all anticipated environment impacts during pre-construction, construction and operation 
stages. and will be included in the contract agreement with the respective civil works contractor. 
Prior to construction, specific mitigation measures will be updated by the Contractor with details 
of the  location  and  time of  implementation,  and other  information  based on  their  survey  of  the 
project area.  
Environmental  Monitoring  Plan  (EMoP).  For  all  project  roads  and  bridges,  the  PMU  is 
86. 
responsible for  undertaking  environmental  due diligence  and implementation  monitoring  of  the 
environmental mitigation measures. Through the EMoP, the monitoring of EMP activities will be 
documented systematically. ADB must be given access to undertake environmental due diligence 
for all project roads and bridges, if needed. 
Environmental Monitoring Reports (EMR). On an annual basis, the report will document 
87. 
the progress made on EMP implementation for all the roads and bridges. The PMU and PIU will 
be supported by six Environment Specialists to monitor all roads and bridges; pre-, during-, and 
post-construction. Each contractor’s appointed environment focal person (EFP) will submit self-
monitoring reports following a prescribed format from the initial environmental examination (IEE) 
48        
to the jurisdictional District Engineer and Environment Specialist. These self-monitoring reports 
are  subject  to  the  environmental  audit  for  veracity  and  from  which  decisions  will  be  made  for 
further inspections. The PIUs and Environment Specialists periodic inspection reports and EFP’s 
self-monitoring reports will be summarized into quarter and annual reports by the Environment 
Specialists to be reviewed by the Team Leader – PISC.  
88. 
An outline of the EMR is shown in Attachment I. This outline is the default template and 
further revisions, such as addition of tables, charts, figures and among others, can be done to 
ensure  proper  documentation  of  (i)  project  implementation  progress;  (ii)  compliance  with 
safeguard measures and their progress toward intended outcomes; and (iii) necessary corrective 
actions. Annual EMRs will cover the months of January to December. On the following year, this 
document will be submitted to ADB every last working day in the month of January for review and 
guidance. The EMRs will be publicly disclosed in the ADB and MRRDA websites after ADB clears 
the EMRs.  
89. 
Through  self-reporting  during  construction  and  the  5-year  maintenance  period,  the 
environmental safeguard monitoring is one of the primary responsibilities of the contractor (with 
guidance from the Environmental Specialists and PIU). The self-monitoring relates to the status 
of EMP implementation and possible complaints from affected people. While, the 6 Environment 
Specialists  are  responsible  for  monitoring 
the  compliance  with  construction  contracts, 
effectiveness  of  mitigation  measures,  complaints,  and  documenting  environmental  quality 
according to the results of the ambient environmental sampling tests. The reference of ambient 
monitoring parameter standards will be subject to the quantitative standards recommended in the 
the SPS.28 During the 5-year maintenance period, the EFP will submit self-monitoring reports to 
PMU.  The  PMU  will  be  responsible  for  the  review,  preparation,  and  disclosure  of  annual 
environmental monitoring reports. 
90. 
 Involuntary  resettlement  monitoring.  MRRDA,  with  the  support  of  PIUs,  the  PISC 
social  and  gender  specialists,  will  set  up  an  internal  monitoring  system  with  a  set  of  process, 
outcome  and  impact  baseline  indicators.  The  social  and  gender  specialists  will  carry  out 
assessment  of  the  social  safeguard  monitoring  through  field  work,  data  verification  and 
consultations, identify issues; and in consultation with PIUs advise on actions and provide annual 
social  safeguard  monitoring  reports  to  MRRDA  and  ADB.  MRRDA  will  adopt  and  modify  (as 
needed) monitoring templates and indicators provided within the project’s SDDG. ADB will also 
assess the progress of social safeguard activities during review missions. 
Gender monitoring. The GAP activities will be monitored by the PISC SGS and they will 
91. 
submit monthly progress report to MRRDA and QPR on GAP implementation in the prescribed 
format  (Attachment  H)  to  ADB.  ADB  will  assess  the  progress  of  these  activities  during  review 
missions. 
C. 
Evaluation  
92. 
The project inception mission will be fielded soon after the legal agreements for the project 
are  declared  effective;  thereafter,  regular  reviews  will  follow,  at  least  annually.  As  necessary, 
special loan administration missions and a midterm review mission will be fielded, under which 
any changes in scope or implementation arrangements may be required to ensure achievement 
of project objectives. MRRDA will monitor project implementation in accordance with the schedule 
and time-bound milestones and keep ADB informed of any significant deviations that may result 
28 Section 9, Pollution Prevention and Abatement, Safeguards Requirement 1: Environment, ADB SPS 2009  
49 
in the milestones not being met. Within six months of physical completion of the project, MRRDA 
will submit a project completion report to ADB.29 
D. 
Reporting  
93.  MRRDA  will  provide  ADB  with  (i)  QPRs  in  a  format  consistent  with  ADB's  project 
performance reporting system; (ii) consolidated annual reports including (a) progress achieved by 
output as measured through the indicator's performance targets, (b) key implementation issues 
and  solutions,  (c)  updated  procurement  plan,  (d)  updated  implementation  plan  for  the  next  12 
months; and (iii) a project completion report within 6 months of physical completion of the overall 
project. These reports can be prepared for the overall project (not separately for the ongoing and 
additional  financing  projects).  To  ensure  that  projects  will  continue  to  be  both  viable  and 
sustainable, project accounts and the executing agency audited financial statement together with 
the associated auditor's report should be adequately reviewed. 
E. 
Stakeholder Communication Strategy  
94. 
 MRRDA undertook transect walks on each project road/bridge approaches involving the 
local community. Consultation meetings have been held with the local community involving both 
the  elected  representatives  as  well  as  other  community  members.  During  the  community 
consultations, MRRDA officials assisted by design consultants explained various features of the 
project including the road/bridge design, environmental considerations, land requirement and the 
process of voluntary donation, mitigation measures and grievance redress procedures. A project 
information brochure in local  language (Marathi) has been distributed to the community during 
these consultation meetings. During implementation, the PISC safeguard team, along with PIU 
staff,  will  continue  with  the  community  consultations  and  the  grievance  redress  process.  The 
consultation activities and GRC meetings undertaken during the project implementation will be 
documented in the safeguard monitoring reports. 
95. 
Stakeholders  concerned,  including  local  communities,  local  forestry  officials,  relevant 
government agencies, and nongovernment organizations, have been consulted on environmental 
issues during project preparation. Technical recommendations on project design and biodiversity 
conservation provided by them have been included in the project.  
Project information will be disclosed to the general public and concerned stakeholders as

VII. 
ANTICORRUPTION POLICY 
97. 
The Government of India, the Government of Maharashtra, the MRRDA are advised of 
ADB’s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date). Consistent with its commitment to good 
governance,  accountability  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  review  and  examine, 
directly  or  through  its  agents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices 
relating to project.30 In this regard, investigation of government officials, if any, would be requested 
by ADB to be undertaken by the government.  
98. 
To  support  these  efforts  the  relevant  provisions  of  ADB’s  Anticorruption  Policy  are 
included in the loan regulations, agreements, and the bidding documents. All contracts financed 
by ADB shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and 
accounts  of  MRRDA,  and  all  project  contractors,  suppliers,  consultants,  and  other  service 
providers  as  they  relate  to  the  project.  Individuals  and/or  entities  on  ADB’s  anticorruption 
debarment list are ineligible to participate in ADB-financed activity and may not be awarded any 
contracts  under  the  project.31 MRRDA  will  conduct  a  due  diligence  check  of  each  contractor, 
suppliers,  consultants,  and  other  service providers  if  they  are  included  in ADB’s  anticorruption 
debarment list prior to submission of bid evaluation reports to ADB. 
VIII.  ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISM 
99. 
People who  are,  or may  in the  future  be,  adversely  affected  by the  project  may  submit 
complaints  to  ADB’s  Accountability  Mechanism.  The  Accountability  Mechanism  provides  an 
independent forum and process whereby people adversely affected by ADB-assisted projects can 
voice,  and  seek  a  resolution  of  their  problems,  as  well  as  report  alleged  violations  of  ADB’s 
operational  policies  and  procedures.  Before  submitting  a  complaint  to  the  Accountability 
Mechanism, affected people should try in good faith to solve their problems by working with the 
concerned  ADB  operations  department.  Only  after  doing  that,  and  if  they  are  still  dissatisfied, 
should they approach the Accountability Mechanism.32 
IX. 
RECORD OF CHANGES TO THE PROJECT ADMINISTRATION MANUAL

Attachment A: Terms of Reference for Audit of ADB assisted projects 
by Comptroller and Auditor General of India 
Background: 
ADB provides assistance in the form of Loan and/or Grant for the implementation of project and/or 
program by the executing agencies (EA) identified by the central/state government. In order to 
facilitate the same, a loan/grant agreement is executed between ADB and central government for 
each individual loan/grant and a project agreement is executed between ADB and the executing 
agency  for  each  project/sub-project.  The  disbursement  of  loan  is  governed  by  the  ADB  Loan 
Disbursement Handbook which provides for various disbursement procedures viz, Direct payment 
procedure,  Reimbursement  procedure,  Commitment  Letter  procedure  and  Advance  Account 
procedure. The project agreement stipulates that the executing agency shall (i) maintain separate 
accounts  for  the  project  and  if  the  executing  agency  is  revenue  earning,  then  for  its  overall 
operations  also  (ii)  have  such  accounts  and  related  financial  statements 33  (balance  sheet, 
statement of income and expenses and related statements) audited annually, in accordance with 
independent  auditors  whose 
appropriate  auditing  standards  consistently  applied,  by 
qualifications, experience and terms of reference are acceptable to ADB; and (iii) furnish to ADB, 
promptly  after  their  preparation  but  in  any  event  not  later  than  six  (6)  months  (or  9  months  if 
specifically approved) after the close of the fiscal year to which they relate as applicable, certified 
copies of such audited accounts and financial statements and the report of the auditor relating 
thereto  (including  the  auditor's  opinion  on  the  use  of  loan  proceeds  and  compliance  with  the 
covenants  of  the  loan/grant  agreement  as    well  as  on  the  use  of  the  procedures  for  Advance 
Account, Second Generation Imprest Account (SGIA), Statement of expenditures (SOE), Force 
Account  Works  and  Simultaneous  Application  for  sub-loan  approval  and  Withdrawal  (SAW)), 
where applicable, all in the English language. 
The executing agencies for all sovereign loans are subject to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor 
General of India (Supreme Audit Institution of the country). In order to comply with the requirement 
of audit as referred in above para, the following terms of reference should be pursued with respect 
to the loan/grant/project agreement executed for availing the ADB's assistance. 
Objective: 
Article 14(xi) of the Agreement establishing the Asian Development Bank (The Charter) States 
that 'Proceeds of any loan made, guaranteed, or participated by the Bank are used only for the 
purposes for which the loan was granted and with due attention to consideration of economy and 
efficiency'. In addition, Article 14(xiv) of the Charter requires ADB to be guided by sound banking 
principles in its operations. To fulfill the requirements of Article 14 (xi) and (xiv) of the Charter, 
ADB  requires  borrowers/project  executing  agencies  to  submit  audited  Project  accounts  (APA) 
and audited financial statements (AFS). 
ADB requires the borrower and the project EA to have the required financial statements for each 
year audited by an independent auditor acceptable to ADS, and in accordance with standards on 
auditing  that  are  acceptable  to  ADB.  An  audit  of  such  financial  'statements  includes:  (i)  an 
assessment of the adequacy of accounting and internal control systems with respect to project 
expenditures  and  other  financial  transactions,  and  to  ensure  safe  custody  of  project  financed 
33 Preparation of balance sheet, statement of income and expenditure shall depend on the legal status of the project 
executing/implementing agency and shall apply to autonomous bodies or corporation until extended legally to other 
types of organization such as government departments.

assets,  (ii)  a  determination  as  to  whether the  borrower  and project  implementing  entities have 
maintained  adequate  documentation  on  all  relevant  transactions,  including  statement  of 
expenditures (SOE), Force Account Works and Simultaneous Application for sub-loan approval 
and Withdrawal (SAW)) where applicable, (iii) confirmation that expenditures submitted to ADB 
are  eligible  for  financing  and  identification  of  any  ineligible  expenditures,  (iv)  compliance  with 
loan/grant covenants and ADB's requirements for project management and (v) compliance with 
the  use  of  procedures 
Imprest  Account 
(SGIA)/SOE/force account works/SAW, where applicable. 
for  Advance  Account 
/Second  Generation 
The  objective  of the  audit  of the  Project  Financial  Statement (PES)  is  to enable the  auditor to 
express a professional opinion as to whether (i) the PFS present fairly, in all material respects, 
the sources and applications of project funds for the period under audit examination, (ii) the funds 
were  utilized  for  the  purposes  for  which  they  were  provided,  (iii)  loan  covenants  have  been 
complied with and (iv) expenditures shown in the PFS are eligible for financing under the relevant 
loan/grant  agreement.  In  addition,  where  applicable,  the  auditor  will  express  a  professional 
opinion on the use of the procedures for IA, SGIA, SOE, Force Account Works and SAW and 
whether  adequate  supporting  documentation  has  been  maintained to  support  claims  made  by 
project management for reimbursement of expenditures incurred under the SOE, Force Account 
Works and SAW method of reimbursement where applicable. 
The books of account that provide the basis for preparation of the PFS are established to reflect 
the financial transactions of the project and are maintained by the project executing/implementing 
agency – [            ] Project Implementation unit and the participating divisions. 
Standards: 
The  audit  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  Auditing  Standards  promulgated  by  the 
Comptroller  and  Auditor  General  of  India  The  auditor  should  accordingly  consider  materiality 
when  planning  and  performing  the  audit  to  reduce  audit  risk  to  an  acceptable  level  that  is 
consistent with the objective of the audit. Although the responsibility for preventing irregularity, 
fraud,  or  the  use  of  loan/grant  proceeds  for  purposes  other  than  as  defined  in  the  legal 
agreements remain with the borrower, the audit should be planned so as to have a reasonable 
assurance of detecting material misstatements in the PFS. 
Scope:34 
In conducting the audit, special attention should be paid to the following: 
(a)  All external funds have been used in accordance with the conditions of the relevant legal 
agreements  and  only  for  the  purposes  for  which  the  financing  was  provided.  Relevant 
legal  agreements  include  the  Loan/Grant  Agreement,  the  Project  Agreement,  and  the 
Minutes of Negotiations; 
(b)  Counterpart  funds  have been  provided  and  used  in  accordance  with the  relevant  legal 
agreements and only for the purposes for which they were provided; 
34 In response to identified project risks, the scope may be expanded to include a report or the expression of an opinion 
on  specific  aspects  of  the  operation  such  as  internal  controls,  compliance  with  Bank  procurement  policies,  or 
efficiency and effectiveness in the use of loan/grant proceeds. 
54 
Attachment A to PAM 
(c)  Financial covenants of the loan agreement have been complied with 
(d)  All necessary supporting documents, records, and accounts have been kept in respect of 
all  project 
reported  via  SOEs/advance 
including  expenditures 
accounts/SGIAs/Force Account Works/SAW where applicable. Clear linkages should exist 
between the books of account and reports presented to the ADB; and 
transactions 
(e)  The  project  accounts  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  consistently  applied 
Government  Accounting  Standards 35  and  present  fairly,  in  all  material  aspects,  the 
financial situation of the project at the year end and of resources and expenditures for the 
year ended on that date. 
Project Financial Statements: 
The contents of Project Financial Statements (PFS) are specific to the sector, the project design 
and the type of implementing entity. These formats therefore vary from one project to another. 
The  formats  of  PFS  are  prepared  in  consultation  with  the  implementing  entity  during  the 
preparation of the project. 
The Project Financial Statements should include: 
A. 
In a nonrevenue-earning entity, or for the audit of project accounts, the annual financial 
statement  may  consist  of  the  Statement  of  Receipts  and  Payments  on  project 
transactions. Other schedules of value or cumulative expenditures by category such as 
civil works, equipment, consultancy services, training and capacity building, administrative 
costs,  expenditure  by  financier,  statement  of  disbursement  under  SOE  procedure, 
advance account, cumulative work-in-progress, assets and inventories and a summarized 
reconciled bank statement are to be attached. See Annexure 1-8 for examples of reporting 
formats  that  could  be  prepared  for  a  project  implemented  by  core  government 
departments. 
B.  For a revenue-earning entity, a balance sheet, income statement and cash flow statement 
accompanied by supplementary statements or schedules supporting the basic statement 
(e.g., inventories, schedule of assets, outstanding loans, aging of receivables, etc:). 
C.  Statement  of  Disbursement:  The  PFS  include  a  reconciliation  between  expenditure 
reported as per the statement of sources and application of funds and expenditure claimed 
from  ADB  through  SOE,  documented  claims  (direct  payment  and  reimbursement), 
commitment letter procedure, force account works or SAW where applicable. An example 
is shown at Annexure 3. 
D.  Other statements or schedules as may be applicable in particular circumstances and as 
specified in the relevant loan/grant agreements. In particular, Statement of Appropriation 
Vs. Actual (Annexure 9) and Statement of Expenditure by Output (Annexure 10) shall be 
prepared and prepared to the project financial statements. These statements shall not be 
subject to audit. 
35  Until such time as the pronouncements of the Government Accounting Standards Advisory Board are accepted and 
prescribed by the Ministry of Finance, the Accounting Standards followed by the Government of India will be defined 
by the General Financial Rules, PWD codes; Treasury codes and similar financial rules and codes as are in effect 
and applicable to the operations of the project. 
Attachment A to PAM 
55 
E.  Management  Assertion:  Management  should  sign  the  PFS  and  provide  a  written 
acknowledgement  of  its  responsibility  for  the  preparation  and  fair  presentation  of  the 
financial  statements  and  an  assertion  that  project  funds  have  been  expended  in 
accordance  with  the  intended  purposes  as  reflected  in  the  financial  statements.  An 
example of a management assertion letter is shown at Annexure 11. 
Statement of Expenditure (SOE), Advance Account , Second Generation Imprest Account 
(SGIA),  Force  Account  Works,  Simultaneous  Application  for  Sub-Loan  Approval  and 
Withdrawal (SAW): 
During  the  course  of  the  audit  of  the  PFS,  the  auditor  is  required  to  audit  all  SOE,  advance 
account,  SGIA,  Force  Account  Works  and  SAW  for  withdrawal  applications  made  during  the 
period  under  audit  examination.  The  auditor  should  apply  such  tests  as  the  auditor  considers 
necessary under the circumstances to satisfy the audit objective. In particular, these expenditures 
should  be  carefully  examined  for  project  eligibility  by  reference  to  the  relevant  financing 
agreements. Where ineligible expenditures36 are identified as having been included in withdrawal 
applications and reimbursed against, these should be separately noted by the auditor. 
Audit Report 
An  audit  report  on  the  PFS  should  be  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  Auditing  Standards 
promulgated by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India. Those standards require an audit 
opinion  to  be  rendered  related  to  the  financial  statements  taken  as  a  whole,  indicating 
"unambiguously  whether  it  is  unqualified  or  qualified  and  if  the  latter,  whether  it  is  qualified  in 
certain respects or is adverse or a disclaimer of opinion". In addition, the audit opinion paragraph 
will specify whether, in the auditor's opinion, (a) loan proceeds have been used as covenanted in 
ADB Loan / Project Agreement (b) financial covenants of loans have been complied with (c) with 
respect  to  SOEs,  Force  Account  Works  and  SAW,  where  applicable,  adequate  supporting 
documentation has been maintained to support claims to ADB for reimbursement of expenditures 
incurred; and (d) except for ineligible expenditures as detailed in the audit observations, if any, 
appended  to  the  audit  report,  expenditures  are  eligible  for  financing  under  the  Loan/Grant 
Agreement. Relevant CAG Auditing Standards are reproduced in Annexure 12. A sample audit 
report wordings for unqualified opinion in shown at Annexure 13. 
The  PFS  and  the  audit  report  should  be  received  by  ADB  not  later  than  six  (6)  months  (or  9 
months if specifically approved) after the close of the fiscal year to which they relate as specified 
in the loan/project agreement. The auditor should also submit two copies of the audited accounts 
and audit report to the Implementing Agency. 
The audit report is issued without prejudice to CAG's right to incorporate the audit observations 
in the Report of CAG of India for being laid before Parliament / State or UT Legislature.  
36 Refer to ADB's Operation Manual (OM) Section H3 and Safeguard Policy Statement 
56 
Attachment A to PAM 
Management Letter 
In addition to the audit report on the PFS, the auditor may prepare a management letter containing 
recommendations for improvements in internal control and other matters coming to the attention 
of the auditor during the audit examination. Where such a management letter is prepared by the 
auditor, a copy of the same will be supplied to ADB. Else, a written advice may be made that no 
management letter was prepared together with the audit report on the PFS.  
General 
The auditor should be given access to any information relevant for the purposes of conducting 
the  audit.  This  would  normally  include  all  legal  documents,  correspondence,  and  any  other 
information associated with the project and deemed necessary by the auditor. The information 
made  available  by  the  auditor  should  include,  but  not  be  limited  to,  copies  of  ADB's  project 
appraisal  document,  the  relevant  legal  agreements,  a  copy  of  these  guidelines  and  a  copy  of 
ADB's financial management assessment of the project entity. It is highly desirable that the auditor 
become  familiar  with  other  ADB  policy  document  such  as  ADB  guidelines  on  financial 
management  and  analysis  of  projects  chapter  5  title  reporting  and  auditing,  PAI  5.07  on 
submission of audited project accounts and financial statements, OM section J7/BP on project 
accounting, financial reporting and auditing. The auditor should also be familiar with ADB's Loan 
Disbursement Handbook – July 2012 (or as amended from time to time).

Excerpt from CAG Auditing Standards (2nd Edition, 2002) Chapter IV, Reporting Standards 
12. 
The form and content of audit option and report. 
12.1  The form and content of all audit opinions and reports are founded on the following 
general principles: 
Annexure 12 
(a)  Title.  The opinion or report should be preceded by a suitable title or heading, helping the 
reader to distinguish it from statements and information issued by others. 
(b)  Signature and date.  The opinion or report should be properly signed. The inclusion of a 
date  informs  the  reader  that  consideration  has  been  given  to  the  effect  of  events  or 
transactions about which the auditor became aware up to that date (which, in the case of 
regularity (financial) audits, may be beyond the period of the financial statement). 
(c)  Objectives and scope.  The opinion or report should include reference to the objectives 
and scope of the audit.  This information establishes the purpose and boundaries of the 
audit. 
(d)  Completeness.    Opinions  should  be  appended  to  and  published  with  the  financial 
statements  to  which  they  relate,  but  performance  reports  may  be  free  standing.  The 
auditor’s  opinions  and  reports  should  be  presented  as  prepared  by  the  auditor.  In 
exercising its independence CAG may acquire information from time to time, which in the 
national interest cannot be freely disclosed. This can affect the completeness of the audit 
report. In this situation the auditor should consider the need to make a report, possibly 
including confidential or sensitive material in a separate, unpublished report. 
(e)  Addressee.    The  opinion  or  report  should  identify  those  to  whom  it  is  addressed,  as 
required by the circumstances of the audit engagement and local regulations or practice. 
This is unnecessary where formal procedures exist for its delivery. 
(f)  Identification  of  subject  matter.  The  opinion  or  report  should  identify  the  financial 
statements (in the case of regularity (financial) audits) or area (in the case of performance 
audits) to which it relates. This includes information such as the name of the audited entity, 
the date and period covered by the financial statements and the subject matter that has 
been audited. 
(g)  Legal basis.  Audit opinions and reports should identify the legislation or other authority 
providing for the audit. 
(h)  Compliance  with  standards.    Audit  opinions  and  reports  should  indicate  the  auditing 
standards or practices followed in conducting the audit, thus providing the reader with an 
assurance  that  the  audit  has  been  carried  out  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted 
procedures. 
(i)  Timeliness.  The audit opinion or report should be available promptly to be of greatest 
use to readers and users, particularly those who have to take necessary action.

These statements are the responsibility of the Project's management. Our responsibility is 
to express an opinion on the accompanying financial statements based on our audit. 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the Auditing Standards promulgated by the 
Comptroller and Auditor General of India. Those Standards require that we plan and perform the 
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material 
misstatement. Our audit examines, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures 
in the financial statements. It also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant 
estimates  made  by  management,  as  well  as  evaluating  the  overall  statement  presentation.  We 
believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
37 Insert titles of other required statements and schedules included in or annexed to the project financial statements, 
if any. 
                                                                                                                                          Attachment A to PAM

(a) 
(b) 
(c) 
In addition, in our opinion;

(i)(a)With respect to SOEs, adequate supporting documentation has been maintained 
to support claims to the Asian Development Bank for reimbursements of expenditures 
incurred; and (b) except for ineligible expenditures as detailed in the audit observations, 
if any, appended to this audit report, expenditures are eligible for financing under the 
Loan Agreement. 
(ii)(a)The  Advance  Accounts  give  a  true  and  fair  view  of  the  receipts  collected 
and  payments  made  during  the  year  ended---;  and  (b)  these  receipts  and  payments 
support Advance Account liquidations/replenishments during the year. 
This report is issued without prejudice to CAG's right to incorporate the audit observations 
in the Report of CAG of India for being laid before Parliament/State or UT Legislature. 
[Auditor's Signature]  
[Auditor's Address]  
[Date39] 
38  Until the Ministry of Finance prescribes adoption of the accounting standards pronounced by GASAB or other body 
such as IPSAS, the accounting standards followed by the Government of India shall be the cash basis of accounting 
applied with due regard to the General Financial Rules, PWD codes, Treasury codes and similar financial rules and 
codes as are in effect and applicable to the operations of the project. 
39  The report should be dated as of the date to which the auditor has became aware of and considered the effects of 
events and transactions. This is generally the final date of fieldwork, as opposed to the date of signing the audit 
report.
