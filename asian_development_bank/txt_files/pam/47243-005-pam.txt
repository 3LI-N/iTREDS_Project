Project Administration Manual Purpose and Process 
1.  The  project  administration  manual  (PAM)  describes  the  essential  administrative  and 
management requirements to implement the project on time, within budget, and in accordance 
with the policies and procedures of the government and Asian Development Bank (ADB). The 
PAM should include references to all available templates and instructions either through linkages 
to relevant URLs or directly incorporated in the PAM. 
2.  The  Local  Government  Engineering  Department  (LGED)  is  wholly  responsible  for  the 
implementation of ADB-financed project, as agreed jointly between the borrower and ADB, and 
in  accordance  with  the  policies  and  procedures  of  the  government  and  ADB.  ADB  staff  is 
responsible  for  supporting  implementation  including  compliance  by  LGED  of  their  obligations 
and  responsibilities  for  project  implementation  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  policies  and 
procedures. 
3.  At loan negotiations, the borrower and ADB shall agree to the PAM and ensure consistency with 
the loan agreement. Such agreement shall be reflected in the minutes of the loan negotiations. 
In the event of any discrepancy or contradiction between the PAM and the loan agreement, the 
provisions of the loan agreement shall prevail. 
4.  After ADB Board approval of the project's report and recommendation of the President (RRP), 
changes in implementation arrangements are subject to agreement and approval pursuant to 
relevant government and ADB administrative procedures (including the Project Administration 
Instructions) and upon such approval, they will be subsequently incorporated in the PAM. 
I. 
PROJECT DESCRIPTION  
1. 
Rural connectivity is a key component of rural development in Bangladesh. Rural roads 
contribute significantly to generating increased agricultural incomes and productive employment 
opportunities, alongside promoting access to economic and social services. Rural roads are the 
virtual lifelines for the vast multitude residing in rural areas. Bangladesh has a large network of 
rural roads, many of these roads were constructed in years 1990–2010 on earthen embankments 
owned by Union Parishads (rural councils) or Zila Parishads (district councils), and they are vital 
to the crucially important agricultural sector of the country. Since 1995, the government, with the 
support of the international development community, has continued to expand and improve the 
rural  roads  network.  During  the  past  decades,  rural  infrastructure  in  Bangladesh  significantly 
improved.  Despite  progress,  rural  connectivity  in  Bangladesh  remains  weak,  impeding  the 
physical and economic access. About 40% of the rural population has got access to all-weather 
roads. Less than 30% of the roads are paved and in good or fair condition.  
2. 
The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  approved  the  Rural  Connectivity  Improvement 
Project (the current project) for a regular loan of $100 million (Loan 3731) and a concessional 
loan of $100 million (Loan 3732) on 5 November 2018. The loan agreements were signed on 13 
January  2019  and  declared  effective  on  13  February  2019.  The  current  project  is  to  be 
implemented over 5 years. Both loans will close on 31 May 2024. The additional financing through 
a concessional loan of $100 million (Loan XXXX) is required to scale-up the current project, the 
performance of which is on track. 
3. 
The current project, additional financing, and overall project are aligned with the strategy 
set  out  by  the  Seventh  Five-Year  Plan,  FY2016–FY20201  having  the  following  impact: 
Connectivity  between  rural  communities,  productive  agricultural  areas,  and  socioeconomic 
centers in Bangladesh improved.2 The project will have the following outcome: transport efficiency 
and related employment generated in target areas increased.  
4. 
The  current  project  has  three  outputs:  Output  1:  Rural  road  conditions  between  the 
selected rural communities, productive agricultural areas, and socioeconomic centers improved. 
Road  conditions  of  about  1,700  kilometers  (km)  rural  roads  between  the  selected  rural 
communities, productive agricultural areas, and socioeconomic centers improved to all-weather 
standards  with  safety3  and  climate-resilient  features4  and  maintained  for  5  years.5  Output  2: 
Capacity  of  rural  infrastructure  agency  and road  users  in  project  areas  enhanced.  This  output 
consists of three subcomponents: (i) Local Government Engineering Department (LGED) trained 
on  road  asset  management,  road  safety,  contract  management,  financial  management  and 
climate-resilient  road  design  and  construction;  (ii)  road  users’  awareness  enhanced  on  road 
safety, human trafficking, and sexually transmitted infection prevention; and (iii) women workers’ 
skills  on  road  construction  and  maintenance  enhanced.  Output  3:  Rural  road  master  planning 
1  The fiscal year (FY) of the Government of Bangladesh and its agencies ends on 30 June. “FY” before a calendar 
year denotes the year in which the fiscal year ends, e.g., FY2017 ends on 30 June 2017”

3   Road safety measures such as cautionary and information signs, guard posts, speed breakers, and object markers. 
4   Adopt climate change resilience design parameters pertaining to pavement, drainage, earthworks, compaction and 
quality control. This includes slope protection where slope is subjected to water level fluctuations, rigid pavement of 
reinforced cement concrete is provided at submersible road sections, additional cross drainages, and rigid pavement 
on sections of roads connecting to cyclone shelters. 
5   Eight packages in five districts have been selected as pilot contracts with maintenance component. The government 
will finance the maintenance after the loan closing date.

enhanced. The rural road master plan will be upgraded for the entire country using geographic 
information system technology. 
5. 
The executing agency is the Local Government Engineering Department (LGED) in the 
Local  Government  Division  of  the  Ministry  of  Local  Government,  Rural  Development  and 
Cooperatives.  A  Dhaka-based  project  management  unit  within  LGED  supports  project 
implementation, and there are five project implementation units (PIUs) at division level, 34 offices 
at district level, and 180 site offices at Upazila level. 
6. 
Through  a  project  design  advance  (PDA),  ADB  assisted  LGED  to  prepare the  detailed 
design of a loan project amounting $300 million and covering 2,672 km of rural roads. The project 
amount was subsequently approved by ADB for $200 million with a reduced scope of upgrading 
1,700 km of rural roads. 
7. 
The government kept the original loan amount of $300 million in their Development Project 
Proposal  approved  in  October  2018  and  valid  till  30  June  2023,  anticipating  that  ADB  would 
process the additional financing of $100 million in 2019.6  
8. 
The  additional  financing  will  increase  the  project’s  scope  by  upgrading  an  additional 
approximately  930 km  of  rural roads  in 16  districts  out  of  the  34  districts of the  current  project 
under the same implementation arrangements as for the current project. The overall project scope 
is aligned with the government’s priorities under the Seventh Five-Year Plan, FY2016–FY2020 
and ADB’s country partnership strategy for Bangladesh, 2016–2020.7 
The impact and outcome of the overall project will remain unchanged from those of the 
9. 
current project. The additional financing will scale up the current output 1 by including additional 
approximately 930 km of rural roads.

FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT 
17. 
The financial management assessment was conducted in February 2018 and updated in 
November  2019  and  February  2020  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  Guidelines  for  the  Financial 
Management and Analysis of Projects and the Financial Due Diligence: A Methodology Note. The 
financial  management  assessment  considered  the  capacity  of  LGED,  including  funds  flow 
arrangements, staffing, accounting and financial reporting systems, financial information systems, 
and internal and external auditing arrangements. The key financial management risks identified 
by the assessment are listed in Table 14.

LGED, the executing agency 
has experience in 
implementing several ADB-
financed projects. Bridge

in the past part of a few 
projects. 
Decentralized project 
implementation and flow of 
funds: the additional financing 
project will be implemented in 
16 districts and each district 
will manage its own sub 
advance account. 
Close monitoring of project activities 
as well as government’s financing 
management reforms and initiatives 
is required.  
A separate PMU for the ongoing 
project is already established within 
LGED and will implement the 
additional financing project.  
Establishment of supplementary 
accounting procedures and training 
of PMU staff on ADB’s policies and 
procedures as outlined below will 
reduce the risk. 
LGED will implement the 
additional financing project by 
using the FM arrangements 
established under the ongoing 
project.

Mitigation Measures or Action 
Plans 
Firm commitment from the MOF for 
the timely release of counterpart 
fund will reduce the risk of delays. 
Direct payment mechanism is to be 
used for major foreign currency 
payments for contractors and 
suppliers for ADB share. 
Monthly reconciliations of all 
accounts to be conducted in a 
timely manner. 
To avoid bridge financing, it was 
decided that the PMU will act as a 
check and balance point, and will 
release only the ADB share of funds 
to the District Office to make 
payments.  
The FM consultant is to be hired 
part of the ongoing project before 
loan effectiveness of the additional 
financing project. 
Training to be provided on ADB’s 
FM requirements and systems. 
A check and review system, 
established under the current loan, 
to cover ADB funds advanced to the 
District Offices are outlined in the 
manual prepared under the current 
loan. 
The compliance status of loan 
covenants and status of FM will be 
reported and assessed through the 
quarterly progress reports and 
verified by ADB review missions. 
The PMU will request the Internal 
Audit Unit of LGED to include the 
additional financing project in their 
annual internal audit program. The 
PMU must liaise actively with the 
internal audit unit and implement 
their recommendations in a timely 
manner. 
The PMU must liaise with FAPAD to 
ensure the additional financing 
project is part of FAPAD’s annual 
audit plan and that ADB’s audit 
requirements are strictly followed. 
Risk Description 
There were cases in the past 
of delayed release of 
counterpart fund.  
Highly centralized flow of 
funds with 16 sub accounts 
maintained in each district. 
Control on over expenditure 
under ADB share: there were 
instances in the past of a few 
projects where the District 
Office utilized the ADB share 
in excess of the eligible 
portion to make payments 
(bridge financing). 
Dedicated finance and 
accounting staff for LGED. 
Finance staff is already in 
place in the PMU and District 
Offices for the ongoing 
project. However, to date the 
PISC FM consultant has not 
been hired yet; as a result, the 
planned FM capacity building 
activities are still to be 
completed.  
Accounts are maintained 
according to national 
accounting standards. 
Existing government policies 
and procedures are followed. 
However, ADB funds are 
partly not covered by 
government systems. 
The ongoing project is 
included in the audit plan of 
LGED’s internal audit 
department. However, no 
report has yet been issued to 
the PMU.  
The current arrangement of 
having the audit done by 
FAPAD of CAG is acceptable 
to ADB. Annual project audit 
reports are produced within 6 
months after the end of the 
financial year.

Risk Description 
To provide ADB and PMU 
with timely financial 
information, quarterly financial 
information needs to be 
compiled and consolidated by 
the PMU. 
There is a system in place in 
the government for recording 
transactions in Integrated 
Budgeting Accounting System 
(IBAS). However, 
subaccounts and 
expenditures paid from the 
ADB loan proceeds are not 
captured in the IBAS software 
and are therefore maintained 
manually. 
The PMU has access to LFIS 
and CPD under of the 
ongoing project. 
There is a manual contract 
management system in place 
under the ongoing project. 
Mitigation Measures or Action 
Plans 
Comprehensive financial 
information is to be included in the 
quarterly progress reports in a 
format agreed with ADB within 15 
days after the end of each quarter.  
The  ADB  systems  LFIS  and  Client 
Portal for disbursement (CPD) must 
be used regularly to reconcile project 
accounts  and  ADB  disbursement 
records  and  to  keep  track  of  direct 
payments  as  well  as  advances, 
replenishments  and  liquidations  to 
the advance account. 
The  PMU  must  explore  and 
implement  suitable  IT  solutions  to 
fully  computerize  all  accounts  and 
automate  financial  reporting  to  the 
extent  possible  taking  into  account 
the  rollout  of  IBAS++  for  donor

Disbursement Arrangements for ADB Funds 
19. 
The  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  Loan  Disbursement 
Handbook  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)9  and  detailed  arrangements  agreed  upon 
between the government and ADB. Online training for project staff on disbursement policies and 
procedures  is  available10  and  project  staff  are  encouraged  to  undertake  it  to  ensure  efficient 
disbursement and fiduciary control. 
20. 
ADB’s  disbursement  procedures  (direct  payment,  reimbursement,  commitment  and/or 
advance fund procedure) will be used for withdrawal of project funds. Direct payment procedure 
will  be  used  for  foreign  currency  payments  to  consultants.  Reimbursement  and  advance  fund 
(liquidation  or  replenishment)  procedures  will  be  mainly  utilized  for  payments  to  contractors. 
Under  the  commitment  procedure,  ADB,  at  the  borrower's  request,  provides  an  irrevocable 
undertaking  to  reimburse  a  commercial  bank  for  payments  made  or  to  be  made  to  a  supplier 
against a letter of credit financed from the loan account. The PMU will prepare and submit to ADB 
withdrawal  applications.  The  PMU  is  responsible  for  ensuring  that  supporting  documents  are 
complete, retained and made available for ADB’s review at any time. One advance account in US 
dollar will be opened at the Bangladesh Bank. A sub-account in local currency will be established 
in a commercial bank and maintained by the PMU. Sub-sub accounts will be established for each 
of the 16 District Offices which will implement the additional financing project. 
Advance  fund  procedure.  Separate  advance  accounts  will  be  established  and

maintained by LGED for each funding source. The currency of the advance account is the United 
States  dollar.  The  advance  account  is  to  be  used  exclusively  for  ADB’s  share  of  eligible 
expenditures.  LGED  who administers the  advance  account  is  accountable and responsible for 
proper use of advances to the advance accounts including advances to any sub-accounts. 
22. 
The total outstanding advance to the advance account should not exceed the estimate of 
ADB’s  share  of  expenditures  to  be  paid  through  the  advance  account  for  the  forthcoming  six 
months. LGED may request for initial and additional advances to the advance account based on 
an Estimate of Expenditure Sheet11 setting out the estimated expenditures to be financed through 
the accounts for the forthcoming six months. Supporting documents should be submitted to ADB 
or retained by LGED in accordance with ADB’s Loan Disbursement Handbook 2017 (2017, as 
amended from time to time) when liquidating or replenishing the advance account.

reimbursement  of  eligible  expenditures  or  liquidation  of  advances  to  the  advance  account. 
Supporting  documents  and  records  for  the  expenditures  claimed  under  the  SOE  should  be 
maintained and made readily available for review by ADB's disbursement and review missions, 
upon  ADB's  request  for  submission  of  supporting  documents  on  a  sampling  basis,  and  for 
independent audit. Reimbursement and liquidation for individual payments should be supported 
by full documentation when submitting the withdrawal application to ADB. 
Before the submission of the first withdrawal application, the borrower should submit to 
24. 
ADB sufficient evidence of the authority of the persons who will sign the withdrawal applications 
on behalf of the borrower, together with the authenticated specimen signatures of each authorized 
person.  The minimum  value  per  withdrawal  application is  stipulated  in the  Loan  Disbursement 
Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time). Individual payments below such amount should 
be paid (i) by LGED and subsequently claimed to ADB through reimbursement, or (ii) through the 
advance  fund  procedure,  unless  otherwise  accepted  by  ADB.  The  Borrower  should  ensure 
sufficient category and contract balances before requesting disbursements. Use of ADB’s Client 
Portal  for  Disbursements13  system  is  encouraged  for  submission  of  withdrawal  applications  to 
ADB.

financial management resources14 and training events organized by ADB, especially in the first 
two years of project implementation.  
D. 
Auditing and Public Disclosure 
33. 
LGED will cause the detailed project financial statements to be audited in accordance with 
International Standards on Auditing by an independent auditor acceptable to ADB. The audited 
project financial statements together with the auditor’s opinion will be presented in English to ADB 
by LGED within 6 months from the end of the fiscal year, i.e., by 31 December of each year. The 
audit report will include a separate audit opinion on the advance account. 
The audit report for the project financial statements will include a management letter and 
34. 
auditor’s opinions which cover (i) whether the project financial statements present an accurate 
and fair view or are presented fairly, in all material respects, in accordance with the applicable 
financial reporting standards; (ii) whether the proceeds of the loan were used only for the purpose 
of  the  project;  and  (iii)  whether  the  borrower  or  executing  agency  was  in  compliance  with  the 
financial covenants contained in the legal agreements (where applicable). The management letter 
will include from the second year onwards, a follow-up on previous years audit observations. In 
case the auditor does not issue a management letter, the auditor must issue a written confirmation 
that  no  internal  control  issues  were  identified  as  part  of  the  audit.    A  sample  of  the  terms  of 
reference for the auditor is in Appendix 1. 
35. 
Compliance with financial reporting and auditing requirements will be monitored by review 
missions  and  during  normal  project  supervision,  and  followed  up  regularly  with  all  concerned, 
including the external auditor.  
36. 
The  government  and  LGED  have  been  made  aware  of  ADB’s  approach  to  delayed 
submission, and the requirements for satisfactory and acceptable quality of the audited project 
financial  statements.15  ADB  reserves  the right to require  a change in the auditor  (in a manner 
14  ADB  e-learning  courses  include:  ADB  Disbursement  eLearning  course  and  Cash  Basis  IPSAS  for  ADB  Project 
Financial Reporting. 
15  ADB’s approach and procedures regarding delayed submission of audited project financial statements:  
(i)  When audited project financial statements are not received by the due date, ADB will write to the executing 
agency advising that (a) the audit documents are overdue; and (b) if they are not received within the next 6 
months, requests for new contract awards and disbursement such as new replenishment of advance accounts, 
processing of new reimbursement, and issuance of new commitment letters will not be processed. 
(ii)  When  audited  project  financial  statements  are  not  received  within  6  months  after  the  due  date,  ADB  will 
withhold processing of requests for new contract awards and disbursement such as new replenishment of 
advance accounts, processing of new reimbursement, and issuance of new commitment letters. ADB will (a)

consistent with the constitution of the Borrower), or for additional support to be provided to the 
auditor, if the audits required are not conducted in a manner satisfactory to ADB, or if the audits 
are substantially delayed. ADB reserves the right to verify the project financial accounts to confirm 
that the share of ADB’s financing is used in accordance with ADB’s policies and procedures. 
Public disclosure of the audited project financial statements, including the auditor’s opinion 
37. 
on the project financial statements, will be guided by ADB’s Access to Information Policy 2018.16 
After the review, ADB will disclose the audited project financial statements and the opinion of the 
auditors on the project financial statements no later than 14 days of ADB’s confirmation of their 
acceptability  by  posting  them  on  ADB’s  website.  The  management  letter,  additional  auditor’s 
opinions, and audited entity financial statements will not be disclosed.17 
38. 
Internal audit. The Internal Audit function of the LGED will include project activities within 
their  audit  scope,  over the  project  implementation  period.  The  PMU  will actively  liaise with the 
internal audit function and the status of the internal audit recommendations related to the project 
(if  any)  will  be  regularly  monitored  by  LGED  through  its  PMU  and  included  in  the  quarterly 
progress reports.

42. 
All procurement of works and consulting services will be undertaken in accordance with 
Procurement  Regulations  for  ADB  Borrowers:  Goods,  Works,  Nonconsulting  and  Consulting 
Services (2017, as amended from time to time).  
43. 
Open  competitive  bidding  (OCB),  national  will  be  used  for  civil  works  contracts  of  $15 
million  or  less.  Shopping  will  be  used  for  procurement  of  works  estimated  to  cost  less  than 
$100,000, if any. 
Electronic mode of procurement will be used for all civil work contracts.19 Bidders will be

(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
LGED will use the master bidding document previously reviewed and approved by 
ADB under the original loan. 
As ADB reviewed and approved the first five contract packages under the original 
loan,  LGED  may  proceed  with  procurement  procedures  and  contract  award  for 
contract packages under the additional financing project without prior ADB review 
and  approval.  The  following  post  facto  approval  procedures  will  still  apply:  (a) 
LGED will retain a record of all procurement documentation, including copies of 
the signed contracts and the bid evaluation reports, to be available for inspection;20
(b)  at  the  time  of  each  contract  award,  LGED  will  provide  ADB  with  a  certified 
summary sheet reporting on the main aspects of the bid evaluation and contract 
award; and (c) LGED will promptly inform ADB on achieving the award of 30% and 
70% of contracts for ADB to conduct post sampling reviews.21 The procurement 
processes and contract awards will be audited  as part of the performance audit 
following award of 30% and 70% of contracts. ADB may conduct random post facto 
reviews of procurement process and contract awards at any time.  
If  any  contract  award  is  found  to  be  unacceptable  by  ADB,  ADB  may refuse  to 
finance the contract. If any disbursement has been made in part or in full towards 
financing the contract, ADB reserves the right to request LGED to refund the total 
amount disbursed. 
46. 
The  government  will  inform  ADB  of  the  changes  made  to  the  national  procurement 
regulations,  if  any,  and  carry  out  a  joint  review  of  the  OCB  Annex  of  the  procurement  plan,  if 
necessary,  to  ensure  consistency  with  ADB’s  guidelines.  The  procurement  plan  should  be

Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM) 
LGED has established a GRM to voice and resolve social and environmental concerns 
58. 
linked to the overall project and ensure greater accountability of the project authorities towards all 
affected persons (Table 17). This mechanism is not intended to bypass the government’s own 
legal process, but to provide a time-bound and transparent mechanism that is readily accessible 
to  all  segments  of  the  affected  people  and  road  residents.  All  costs  involved  in  resolving  the 
complaints (meetings, consultations, communication and reporting/information dissemination) will 
be  borne  by  the  project.  LGED  is  responsible  to  keep  the  GRM  operational  during  the  whole 
duration of the project.

C. 
Involuntary Resettlement and Indigenous Peoples 
59. 
The  project  is  categorized  as  C  for  involuntary  resettlement.  There  is  very  limited 
requirement of additional land for the project as the works will be carried out mostly within the 
existing  road  corridor/right-of-way.  Narrow  strips  of  additional  land  will  be  required  to  address 
road safety, bridge approaches and short-term construction-related requirements. In such cases, 
eminent  domain will  not  be  used but  instead  a  voluntary  land donation  system  will  be  used  in 
accordance  with  ADB’s  requirements.  The  government  will  ensure  (i)  full  consultation  with 
29 
landowners and any non-titled affected people on alignment selection; (ii) that voluntary donation 
does  not  severely  affect  the  living  standards  of  the  affected  persons,  (iii)  that  any  voluntary 
donation  is  confirmed  through  verbal  and  written  record;  and  (iv)  that  an  adequate  grievance 
mechanism is in place. 
The project is categorized as C for indigenous peoples. The social assessment did not 
60. 
identify presence of Tribes, Minor Races, Ethnic Sects and Communities in all the project roads. 
61. 
In  accordance  with  the  community  consultation  and  social  impact  mitigation  process 
outlined in the Community Participation Framework, transect walks have been conducted along 
all  of  the  96  rural  roads  under  this  additional  financing  project.  Community  Participation  Plans 
have  been  prepared  following  the  transect  walks  for  all  the  subproject  roads.  Assessment  of 
institutional  capacities  and  arrangements  confirmed  that  the  involved  agencies  are  capable  to 
effectively  implement the  requirements of  the  Community  Participation Framework,  community 
consultations  and  monitoring.  They  will  be  assisted  by  the  PISC  social  safeguard  experts  in 
continuing  with  community  consultations  during  implementation,  redressal  of  grievances  and 
social safeguard monitoring. 
VIII.  GENDER AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS 
Poverty  reduction  and social impact.  There  are  51.5  million24  people living  in  the  34 
62. 
districts  covered  by  the  current  project.  Rural  roads  under  the  additional  financing  project  are 
located in 16 of these 34 districts where 40.2 million people live. Household surveys carried out 
in the project area by PDA consultants reveal that the major sources of income are agricultural 
produce, trade and business, services, and overseas workers’ remittances. Among the 16 districts 
under the additional financing project, the estimated percentage of the poor population is between 
27%  in Comilla  and 57%  in Gopalganj.  Poverty  and social  assessment have been  conducted, 
consulting  about  3,114  people  (753  women)  in  the  additional  financing  project  area.  The 
beneficiaries indicated that the project will increase economic and employment opportunities. The 
additional financing project will generate an estimated 1.73 million person-days of employment 
over the construction and maintenance periods. 
63. 
Gender. The poverty and social analysis included a gender assessment and 753 women 
have been consulted at the additional financing project area. Overall, women were supportive of 
the project because of the potential access to economic opportunities and services. The project 
is categorized effective gender mainstreaming, and a gender action plan (GAP) was prepared, 
which  includes  the  following  activities:  (i)  target  at  least  40%  women  participants  community 
consultations  on  the  project;  (ii)  provide  on-the-job  training  to  all  women  workers  on  basic 
construction, improvement, reconstruction works and maintenance skills; (iii) target  an average 
20%  women  labor  days  created  for  roads  improvement  works  of  the  project;  (iv)  conduct 
orientation  and  awareness  raising  sessions  on  road  safety,  gender-based  violence  (including 
sexual exploitation and human trafficking) and sexually transmitted infections (STI) prevention to 
at  least  40%  of  students,  teachers,  parents,  and  school  management  committees  along  the 
project roads; (v) implement core labor standards with gender-inclusive provisions and women-
friendly  work  environments;  and  (vi)  conduct  technical  training  of  LGED  staff  including  30% 
women staff. Gender experts will be hired through the PISC to ensure effective implementation 
of the GAP (Table 18) and prepare the gender monitoring report.

Labor.  Project  construction  is  expected to generate  employment  opportunities for  local 
64. 
communities during the construction and maintenance phases. Provisions are in the bidding and 
contractual documents for the contractors to ensure that all the civil works comply with core labor 
standards (e.g., no child labor; no bonded labor; no work discrimination due to gender, race, and 
ethnicity;  and  freedom  of  association  and  collective  bargaining).  This  will  be  monitored  by the 
PISC and reported in the project quarterly progress reports.  
65. 
HIV  and  human  trafficking.  The  proportion  of  project  requiring  large  and  non-local 
construction workforces is low. Therefore, the risk of spreading communicable diseases including 
STDs or HIV is low. The social assessment undertaken identified no significant social risks such 
as  HIV/AIDS  or  human  trafficking.  LGED  will  ensure  that  civil  works  contractors  disseminate 
information at worksites on the risks of sexually transmitted diseases. All contracts will include 
clauses  on  these  undertakings,  and  the  government  will  strictly  monitor  compliance  during 
implementation. The civil works contractors will carry out STI (including HIV/AIDS) and human 
trafficking  awareness  sessions  for  their  laborers  at  work  sites,  which  will  be  monitored  by  the 
gender experts.

agricultural produce; (ii) traffic volume; (iii) bus and freight transport fares; (iv) travel time or riding 
speed; (v) vehicle operating costs; (vi) surface roughness; and (vii) road accidents. In addition, 
socioeconomic  secondary  data  will  be  obtained  at  the  divisional  level,  including  (a) number  of 
businesses; (b) household income; (c) vehicle ownership; (d) unemployment rate; (e) land value; 
(f) average travel time to schools; and (g) average travel time to hospitals. These indicators will 
be monitored before and after construction, both on the project roads and a few control roads. In 
addition, every year during the project implementation period, LGED will also monitor the (i) road 
maintenance  budget;  (ii) staff–km  ratio  of  rural  roads;  and  (iii) road  maintenance  cost  per 
kilometer.  Achievement  of  the  capacity  development  activities  will  also  be  monitored.  For  civil 
works, progress will be monitored and reported monthly by the PISC. The project beneficiaries' 
satisfaction will be surveyed during and after project implementation. Disaggregated baseline data 
for  output  and  outcome  indicators  gathered  during  project  preparation  will  be  updated  and 
reported through the quarterly progress reports by LGED, and after each ADB review mission. 
These quarterly reports will provide information necessary to update ADB's project performance 
reporting system.  
67. 
Compliance  monitoring.  Compliance  with  loan  covenants  will  be  monitored  through 
ADB's  project  administration  missions,  including  the  project  inception  mission  to  discuss  and 
confirm  the  timetable  for  compliance;  project  review  missions  to  assess  the  government's 
compliance  with  particular  loan  covenants  and,  where  there  is  any  noncompliance  or  delay, 
discuss  proposed  remedial  measures  with  the  government;  and  midterm  review  mission,  if 
necessary, to assess whether the covenants are still relevant or need to be changed, or waived 
due to changing circumstances.  
68. 
Environmental  safeguard  monitoring  and  reporting.  LGED  is  responsible  for 
undertaking  environmental  due  diligence  and  monitoring  the  implementation  of  environmental 
mitigation  measures  for  all  project  roads.  The  due  diligence  report  as  well  as  monitoring 
implementation of the EMP needs to be documented systematically. ADB must be given access 
to undertake environmental due diligence for all project roads, if needed. 
The monitoring reports will document progress in the EMP implementation of each road. 
69. 
LGED will be supported by the SSS and five DES in the compliance inspection of all roads at 
least 3 times: pre-, during-, and post-construction. Each contractor’s appointed EFP will submit 
monthly self-monitoring reports following a prescribed format to the jurisdictional District Engineer 
and DES. These self-monitoring reports are subject to the DES environmental audit for accuracy 
and from which decisions will be taken for further inspections. The DES periodic inspection reports 
and  contractor’s  monthly  self-monitoring reports will  be  summarized into quarter,  semi-annual, 
and  annual  reports  by  the  DES  to  be  reviewed  by  the  SSS.  Annual  reports  will  be  publicly 
disclosed on ADB’s and LGED’s websites. 
37 
70.  Monitoring during construction is primarily the responsibility of the contractor through self-
reporting  which  relates to  the  status  of  EMP  and  EMoP  implementations,  including  complaints 
received.  The  DES  and  SSS  are  responsible  for  monitoring  the  compliance  with  construction 
contracts,  effectiveness  of  mitigation  measures,  complaints,  and  overall  environmental  quality 
from the results of the third-party ambient environmental monitoring hired by the contractor, as 
appropriate.  Ambient  monitoring  will  follow  the  approach  to  selecting  quantitative  standards, 
recommended in the ADB’s SPS. The PMU will be responsible for the preparation, review, and 
disclosure of all annual environmental monitoring reports. 
71. 
Involuntary  resettlement  monitoring.  LGED,  with  the  support  the  PISC’s  social 
safeguard and gender experts, will set up an internal monitoring system with a set of process, 
outcome and impact baseline indicators. The social safeguard and gender experts will carry out 
assessment  of  the  social  safeguard  monitoring  through  field  work,  data  verification  and 
consultations,  and  provide  semi-annual  social  safeguard  monitoring  reports  to  LGED  who  will 
review and approve them before their submission to ADB. Also, ADB will assess the progress of 
social safeguard activities during review missions. 
72. 
Gender monitoring. The GAP activities will be monitored by the PISC’s social safeguard 
and gender experts and they will submit semi-annual monitoring reports to LGED who will review 
and approve them before their submission to ADB. Also, ADB will assess the progress of these 
activities during review missions. 
C. 
Evaluation 
The  project  inception  mission  will  be  fielded  soon  after  the  legal  agreements  (where 
73. 
applicable) for the project are declared effective; thereafter, regular reviews will follow, at least 
annually. As necessary, special loan administration missions and a mid-term review mission will 
be fielded, under which any changes in scope or implementation arrangements may be required 
to  ensure  achievement  of  overall  project  objectives.  LGED  will  monitor  overall  project 
implementation accordingly to the scheduled and time-bound milestones, and keep ADB informed 
of any significant deviations that may result in the milestones not being met. Within 6 months of 
physical completion of the overall project, LGED will submit a project completion report to ADB.25 
D. 
Reporting 
74. 
LGED will provide ADB with (i) quarterly progress reports in a format consistent with ADB's 
project performance reporting system (Appendix 4); (ii) Environmental and/or Social Monitoring 
Report (Appendix 5); (iii) consolidated annual reports including (a) progress achieved by output 
as  measured  through  the  indicator's  performance  targets,  (b)  key  implementation  issues  and 
solutions, (c) updated procurement plan, (d) updated implementation plan for the next 12 months; 
and (iv) a project completion report within 6 months of physical completion of the project. Project 
accounts  and  the  executing  agency  audited  financial  statement  together  with  the  associated 
auditor's  report  shall  be  adequately  reviewed.  The  reporting  requirements  are  summarized  in 
Table 19 and are aligned with the deadlines of the current project. Reporting of current project 
and  additional  financing  will  be  combined,  except  for  the  audited  financial  statement,  with 
separated tables as appropriate. Safeguards documents and safeguard monitoring reports will be 
forwarded to ADB for disclosure on the ADB’s website.

involving the local community. Consultation meetings have been held with the local community 
involving  Union  Parishad  chairman/members,  and  the  stakeholders.  During  the  community 
consultations, LGED officials assisted by the PDA consultants explained various features of the 
project  including  design,  environmental  considerations,  land  requirement  and  the  process  of 
voluntary donation, mitigation measures and grievance redress procedures. A project information 
brochure in Bengali has been distributed to the community during these consultation meetings. 
During implementation, the PISC safeguard team, along with District Offices and PMU staff, will 
continue  the  community  consultations  and  the  grievance  redress  process.  The  consultation 
activities  and  grievance  redress  committee  meetings  undertaken  during 
the  project 
implementation will be documented in the safeguard monitoring reports. 
Concerned  stakeholders  including  local  communities,  local  forestry  officials,  relevant 
76. 
government agencies and nongovernment organizations have been consulted on environmental 
issues during project preparation. Technical recommendations on project design and biodiversity 
conservation provided by them have been included in the overall project.  
Project information will be disclosed to the general public and concerned stakeholders per

ANTICORRUPTION POLICY 
78. 
The  government,  Ministry  of  Local  Government,  Rural  Development  and  Cooperatives 
and LGED were made aware of ADB’s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date). ADB 
reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any violations of the Anticorruption 
Policy relating to the project.26 All contracts financed by ADB shall include provisions specifying 
the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of the executing agency and all 
project  contractors,  suppliers,  consultants  and  other  service  providers.  Individuals/entities  on 
ADB’s anticorruption debarment list are ineligible to participate in ADB-financed activity and may 
not be awarded any contracts under the project.27 
To  support 
79. 
relevant  provisions  are 
agreements/regulations and the bidding documents for the project.  
these  efforts,

80. 
The  government  will  publish  pertinent  information  relating  to  the  project  on  LGED’s 
website, including business opportunities associated with the project, and information in relation 
to procurement of goods, works, and consulting services. 
XI. 
ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISM 
People who  are,  or may  in the  future  be,  adversely  affected  by the  project  may  submit 
81. 
complaints  to  ADB’s  Accountability  Mechanism.  The  Accountability  Mechanism  provides  an 
independent forum and process whereby people adversely affected by ADB-assisted projects can 
voice,  and  seek  a  resolution  of  their  problems,  as  well  as  report  alleged  violations  of  ADB’s 
operational  policies  and  procedures.  Before  submitting  a  complaint  to  the  Accountability 
Mechanism, affected people should make an effort in good faith to solve their problems by working 
with  the  concerned  ADB  operations  department.  Only  after  doing  that,  and  if  they  are  still 
dissatisfied, should they approach the Accountability Mechanism.28

OBJECTIVES  
The objectives of the audit of the project financial statements is to enable the auditor to (i) 
4. 
express  an  independent  and  objective  opinion  as  to  whether  the  project  financial  statements 
present fairly, in all material respects, or give a true and fair view of the project’s financial position, 
29  This statement of audit needs was developed to guide project teams and executing and implementing agencies in

its financial performance and cash flows, and (ii) provide a reasonable assurance opinion over 
certain specific representations made in the Statement of Compliance. (please refer to paragraph 
10).  
IV. 
AUDITING STANDARDS 
The [statutory] audit is required to be conducted in accordance with [specify the relevant 
5. 
auditing standards]. These standards require that the auditor comply with ethical requirements 
and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the project financial 
statements  are  free  from  material  misstatement.  An  audit  involves  performing  procedures  to 
obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the project financial statements. The 
procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of 
material misstatement of the project financial statements whether due to fraud or error. In making 
those  risk  assessments,  the  auditor  considers  the  internal  control  relevant  to  the  entity’s 
preparation  and  fair  presentation  of  the  project  financial  statements  in  order  to  design  audit 
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an 
opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the 
appropriateness  of  accounting  policies  used  and  the  reasonableness  of  accounting  estimates 
made  by  management,  as  well  as  evaluating  the  overall  presentation  of  the  project  financial 
statements. 
The standards to be applied will be documented in the project/loan documents, and will

Background 
1. 
During the past decades, rural infrastructure in Bangladesh significantly improved. Despite 
progress, rural connectivity in Bangladesh remains weak, impeding the physical and economic 
access. Only 40% rural population has access to all-weather roads, and these roads make up 
less than 30% of the total length of rural roads in the country. Lack of maintenance caused faster 
deterioration in roads with huge rehabilitation backlog. The maintenance budgets, covering only 
35% of needs, are inadequate. The government has proposed to increase the percentage of rural 
roads classified as good from 43% in 2016 to 80% in 2020.32 The Local Government Engineering 
Department (LGED) has launched a road maintenance policy in 2013 to overhaul the rural road 
maintenance program. 
2. 
The Rural Connectivity Improvement Project (RCIP) and its additional financing (RCIP-
AF) support the LGED’s maintenance program for the rural roads in districts vulnerable to climate 
variability and change. The expanded climate-resilient infrastructure in the adjacent rural areas 
will  provide  year-round  connectivity  between  agricultural  production  areas  and  markets  and  to 
other  parts  of  the  country.  RCIP  and  RCIP-AF  improve  the  maintenance  of  the  rural  roads  to 
climate-resilient  standards  with  a  focus  on  results.  The  impact  is  connectivity  between  rural 
communities, productive agricultural areas, and socioeconomic centres in Bangladesh improved. 
The outcome is transport efficiency and related employment generated in target areas increased. 
The key outputs include (i) Rural road conditions between selected rural communities, productive 
agricultural  areas,  and  socioeconomic  centers  improved;  (ii)  Capacity  of  rural  infrastructure 
agency and road users in project areas enhanced; and (iii) Rural road master planning enhanced. 
RCIP-AF will also support the preparation of the detailed project report (DPR) for a possible follow-
on project (the project) to be financed by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and that will scale-
up RCIP outputs. 
F. 
Objective of the Assignment 
The  main  objective  of  the  DPRPC  is  to  support  LGED  to  prepare  the  project.  Project

OUTLINE OF SOCIAL SAFEGUARDS MONITORING REPORT  
DURING PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION PERIOD 
Following  requirements  of  the  ADB  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  and  the  Operations 
Manual  section  on  safeguard  policy  (OM  F1),  borrowers/clients  are  required  to  establish  and 
maintain  procedures  to  monitor  the  status  of  implementation  of  safeguard  plans  and  ensure 
progress  is  made  toward  the  desired  outcomes.  For  projects  categorized  as  B  in  Involuntary 
Resettlement and/or Indigenous People, the Borrowers/clients are required to submit semiannual 
monitoring reports for ADB review. The level of detail and comprehensiveness of a monitoring 
report is commensurate with the complexity and significance of social safeguards impacts (IR and 
IP) and with the current status of project implementation phase.  
This outline can be used for semiannual monitoring report and resettlement plan completion report 
to  start  the  civil  works  in  the  impacted  areas.  A  safeguard  monitoring  report  may  include  the 
following elements:
