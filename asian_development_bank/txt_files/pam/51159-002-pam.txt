PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
1. 
The Irrigated Agriculture Improvement Project (the project) will assist the Government of 
Cambodia to: (i) modernize, and improve climate and disaster resilience of  four irrigation systems 
in Battambang, Kampong Cham, Kampong Thom, and Takeo provinces to supply water to 43,500 
hectares (ha) for 291,847 persons, of whom 148,288 (51%) are women; (ii) ensure sustainability 
of these irrigation schemes by strengthening institutional and financial arrangements as well as 
capacity of the government staff and farmer water user communities (FWUCs) in operations and 
maintenance (O&M); (iii) improve farming practices for increased agriculture productivity and crop 
diversification;  and  (iv)  establish  a  national  water  resources  data  management  center 
(NWRDMC), a water resources information system (WRIS), and an irrigation asset management 
system (IAMS) for better water resources management, planning, operations and investment.  
2. 
The  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  inclusive  economic  growth  through 
agriculture  and  irrigation  attained.1  It  will  have  the  following  outcome:  water  and  agriculture 
productivity in the project areas enhanced.2   
3. 
Output  1:  Efficiency  and  climate  resilience  of  irrigation  systems  enhanced.  The 
project will secure water supply for farmers by modernizing and climate-proofing four irrigation 
subprojects to ensure irrigation for about 43,500 ha of agricultural land.3 It will (i) remodel and 
improve  reservoir  embankment,  drains,  and  main  and  secondary  canals,  and  design  joint 
reservoir  operation  (JOROP)  to  improve  water  sharing  arrangements  between  linked  systems 
and ensure equitable water distribution, particularly during droughts for two subprojects (Kamping 
Puoy and Stung Chinit South); (ii) modernize pumping stations, drains, and main and secondary 
canals for two subprojects (Prek Po and Canal 15); (iii) improve farming practices and promote 
crop diversification through training in at least 200 demonstration plots; (iv) strengthen existing 
FWUC  and  forming  additional  FWUCs  with  strong  women  participation,  and  help  them  collect 
irrigation service fees and perform sustainable O&M of the distribution canals; (v) pilot an irrigation 
asset  management  information  system  to  improve  O&M  budgeting  and  procedures;  and  (vi) 
formulate the Sustainable Rice Platform (SRP) in the Stung Chinit South subproject for farmers 
to achieve a premium price for rice by complying with the SRP production standards.4  
The Kamping Pouy subproject in Battambang Province is a reservoir-fed system with a 
4. 
12,000 ha command area. Its modernization will involve the following civil works: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
Rehabilitation of a link canal of 13.90 kilometers (km) connecting Mongkol Borey 
River to the Kamping Pouy Reservoir, which will provide additional water supply to 
the subproject; 
Strengthening  of  the  reservoir  embankment  of  6.50  km  by  providing  erosion 
protection measures on the upstream slope; 
Upgrading of the 14.14 km main canal using concrete lining and installation of all 
structures for water control and distribution devices;

(vi) 
Upgrading  of  two  secondary  canals  with  a  total  length  of  13.00  km  and  41 
associated control and distribution structures; 
Rehabilitation  of  secondary  irrigation  and  drainage  canals  with  a  total  length  of 
40.90 km and improvement and installation of 101 structures;5 and  
Installation  of  seven  drainage  structures  on  one  of  the  secondary  drains  and 
tertiary  irrigation  and  drainage  canals  to  avoid inundation on  paddy  lands  within 
the target command area.  
In addition, the design of JOROP for Mongkol Borey and Kamping Pouy reservoirs will be 
5. 
prepared, and intensive training will be provided to the existing FWUC that was  established in 
2001 and to staff of the Battambang Provincial Department of Water Resources and Meteorology 
(PDWRAM)  on  the  JOROP  of  Kamping  Pouy  Reservoir.  This  is  necessary  since  the  reservoir 
supplies a total command area of 19,000 ha through four canal outlets: (i) Outlet 1: 2,000 ha; (ii) 
Outlet 2: 1,000 ha; (iii) Outlet 3: 1,800 ha; and (iv) Outlet 4: 12,000 ha and a 2,200-ha extension 
to  the  north  (outside  the  subproject  area).  It  is  this  area  under  outlet  4  that  will  comprise  the 
Kamping Pouy subproject. 
The Prek Po subproject in Kampong Cham province has a command area of 8,000 ha. 
6. 
Its upgrading will include the following:   
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
Construction  of  a  new  pumping  station  equipped  with  five  electrical  and 
submergible pumps on the Mekong River Bank at the intake point of the system; 
Upgrading of the 12.75 km main canal and secondary canals with a total length of 
70 km by providing concrete lining and associated control and offtake structures; 6 
and  
Establishment of a FWUC for the subproject, with sub-FWUCs based on about 200 
ha and hydrological boundaries. 
Pumping operation manual will be prepared, and irrigation scheduling will be discussed 
7. 
and agreed with the FWUC.   
8. 
The Stung Chinit South subproject in Kampong Thom province covers a total potential 
command area of about 19,900 ha. However, about 3,900 ha of the total area are being developed 
by the ADB funded Climate Resilient Rice Commercialization Sector Development Project (Rice 
SDP). Excluding the Rice SDP area, the Stung Chinit South targets a command area of 16,000 
ha in 11 communes in Baray District of Kampong Thom Province. The Stung Chinit South system 
is currently equipped with one main canal of 35 km and 75.78 km of combined secondary and 
tertiary canals. However, due to the deterioration of these canals and associated structures, the 
system cannot provide irrigation services to the full potential target area, especially for the dry 
season crop. Modernization of the subproject will entail the following civil works: 
(i) 
Improvement of the Stung Chinit weir by replacing the existing erosion protection 
works at the downstream section by a concrete slab and chute blocks; 
5   Budget for scheme improvement and tertiary canal upgrading will be determined based on the landholding surveys 
and consultation with farmers.  
6   The cost for FWUC establishment, landholding surveys, FWUC start-up, and for facilitating scheme improvements 
and tertiary canal upgrading will be covered by the support from the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and 
Trade (DFAT), as outlined in the letter from DFAT to ADB on 22 May 2019. DFAT will not fund any construction 
costs. Noting that the Cambodia Agriculture Value Chain Program is due to be concluded at the end of 2021, any 
further  support  by  DFAT  after  2021  is  discretionary  and  will  be  by  negotiation,  including  as  to  the  appropriate 
mechanism through which support is provided.  
3 
(ii) 
(iii) 
Improvement of the Stung Chinit South main canal of 35 km by upgrading existing 
structures, adding additional structures, fixing canal embankments, and excavating 
the canal bed to increase irrigation supply to the downstream area of the system; 
and 
Improvement of 10 secondary canals with a total length of 42.6 km and five tertiary 
canals with a total length of 24.62 km through: (a) excavation work to restore the 
canal  sections;  (b)  forming  new  canal  embankments  and  fixing  the  existing 
embankments;  and  (c)  fixing  existing  and  constructing  additional  irrigation  and 
drainage  structures  to  ensure  proper  water  distribution  and  prevent  drainage 
issues (footnote 5). 9.  The design of JOROP for Stung Chinit South reservoir will 
be prepared. In addition, a FWUC and sub-FWUCs will be established to support 
O&M  activities  based  on  about  2,000  ha  per  sub-FWUC  and  appropriate 
hydrological boundaries.  
10. 
Furthermore,  an  SRP  will  be  formulated  in  the  Stung  Chinit  South  subproject,  with 
assistance  by  the  Wildlife  Conservation  Society  (WCS).  The  SRP  will  provide  farmers  the 
opportunity to protect the habitat for the bird species in the International Union for Conservation 
of  Nature  endangered  list,  while  achieving  a  premium  price  for  the  rice  product.  This  will  be 
achieved  by  complying  with  sustainable  production  standards  and  outreach  mechanisms  that 
contribute  to  increasing  the  global  supply  of  affordable  rice,  improved  livelihoods  for  rice 
producers, and reduced environmental impact of rice production.7  
The  Canal  15  subproject  in  Takeo  Province  will  involve  the  following  physical 
11. 
improvements: 
(i) 
(ii) 
Rehabilitation of the 18 km Canal 15 main canal, which will take water from the 
Angkor  Borey  River  to  supply  the  whole  system  of  the  Canal  15  subproject,  by 
excavating  the  large  amount  of  silt  that  has  accumulated  on  the  canal  bed  to  a 
depth of about 2 meters;  
Rehabilitation of Canal 87 as a secondary canal system that will take water from 
Canal 15 by desilting the canal bed to a depth of about 1.5 meters; and 
(iii)  Modernization of the Samput pumping system, another secondary system of Canal 
15, which will involve improving the intake channel of 1.9 km, upgrading the existing 
pumping station, providing the canals with a total length of 21.33 km with concrete 
lining and associated drainage facilities (footnote 5). 
Only one FWUC will be established for the Samput pumping system farmers. Pumping 
12. 
operation manual will be prepared, and irrigation scheduling will be discussed and agreed with 
the FWUC.   
Overall, three new FWUCs will be established in Prek Po in Kampong Cham, Stung Chinit 
13. 
South in Kampong Thom, and Canal 15 in Takeo Province. For the existing FWUC in Kamping 
Pouy, additional farmer water user subgroups will be created. These FWUCs will be responsible 
for  managing  the  O&M  of  the  subprojects  after  the  completion  of  the  civil  works.  They  will  be 
7   Co-convened by the United Nations Environment Program and the International Rice Research Institute, the SRP is 
a global multi-stakeholder platform established in December 2011. Its mission is to promote resource efficiency and 
sustainability in the global rice sector through an alliance that links research, production, policy making, trade, and 
consumption. The SRP has over 80 institutional members spanning a wide range of actors both within and outside 
the value chain. In Cambodia, SRP’s current membership includes government agencies, research institutes, rice 
traders,  and  environmental  and  social  nongovernment  organizations  from  Cambodia,  including  the  Ministry  of 
Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, WCS, Sansom Mlup Prey, and AMRU Rice Ltd. 
4 
provided with extensive training in various aspects of irrigation system O&M and supported by 
the respective PDWRAMs in the four project provinces. In establishing the FWUCs, women will 
be encouraged to be members and participate in the management committees. 
An irrigation asset management system will be established on a computer platform and 
14. 
piloted  in  one  irrigation  subproject.  If  successful,  it  will  be  expanded  to  the  remaining  three 
subprojects for the purpose of improving IAMS and O&M budgeting for the irrigation systems. The 
IAMS may be replicated nationwide if the piloting turns out a success. 
15. 
Output 2: Water resources management improved. The project will help improve basin 
level  water  resources  planning  and  investment  by  improving  data  collection,  coordination, 
management, and usage. It will: (i) install hydromet stations to provide data for water resources 
management  in  Battambang  and  Kampong  Cham  provinces;  (ii)  establish  a  NWRDMC  in 
MOWRAM including a building equipped with data management facilities (database and server 
system, analytical system, dissemination facilities, and a doppler radar to track extreme weather 
events);  (iii)  develop  a  WRIS  using  satellite-based  information  and  ground  observation  as  a 
common  platform  for  sharing  water  resources  management  data;  (iv)  train  MOWRAM  and  its 
provincial  departments  staff  on  water  accounting  and  data  management;  and  (v)  provide  a

IV. 
COSTS AND FINANCING 
23.  Overall  program financing.  The  project  is  estimated  to cost  $126.45 million.  ADB  will 
provide $119.16 million comprising (i) a concessional loan of $117.00 million from ADB’s ordinary 
capital resources; and (ii) a grant not exceeding $2.16 million from ADB’s Special Funds resources 
(Asian Development Fund – Disaster Risk Reduction Fund). A grant not exceeding $1.60 million 
will be cofinanced by the the High Level Technology Fund for consulting services to support the 
NWRDMC.8 An estimate of $4.33 million from the ADB concessional loan will be used to reduce 
disaster (flood and drought) risk by (i)  improving hydromet network for early flood and drought 
warning;  (ii)  extending  the  depth  of  pump  shaft  to  lowest  recorded  level  of  the  Mekong  River 
during drought in Prek Po subproject, (iii) increasing drainage capacity of drainage canals by 25% 
for flood and strengthening Kamping Pouy Reservoir weir wall along 6.5 kilometers; (iv) increasing 
depth of main and secondary canals in Canal 15 subproject to reduce flood risk; (v) training in 
disaster  risk  reduction  and  disaster  preparedness  at  the  commune  level;  and  (vi)  installing  a 
doppler  radar  to  track  and  predict  extreme  weather  events  with  high  locational  and  timescale 
accuracy.  The  ADB  grant  will  finance  disaster  risk  reduction  measures  for  Stung  Chinit  South 
subproject  by  repairing  and  strengthening  of  Stung  Chinit  Reservoir  weir  and  spillway  so  to 
improve  weir  safety  against  failure  during  floods,  and  prevent  water  loss  through  to  conserve 
water in case of droughts. The High Level Technology Fund will cofinance consulting services for 
the  NWRDMC  and  the  WRIS.  The  government  will  finance  the  equivalent  of  $5.69  million, 
including in-cash contribution for land acquisition and resettlement, supplementary salary costs, 
and in-kind contribution in the form of tax exemptions for consulting services and goods sourced 
from overseas, applicable taxes and duties on items paid for by the government, counterpart staff, 
office accommodation, and facilities.  
A. 
Cost Estimates Preparation and Revision 
24. 
The cost estimates were prepared by the TRTA consultants. The cost of activities, goods, 
and services under each category for each project output is calculated based on the objectives of 
each  output  and  requirement  for  specific  investments.  Revisions  and  updates  to  the  cost 
estimates during implementation are the responsibility of MOWRAM. 
B. 
Key Assumptions 
25. 
The following key assumptions underpin the cost estimates and financing plan: 
(i) 
(ii) 
Cost estimates are based on second quarter 2019 prices. 
The  contingencies  comprise  physical  and  price  contingencies.  Physical 
contingencies are computed at 5.5% for civil works and 5% for other categories. 
Project payments will be made using the United States dollar currency. Therefore, 
the  international  rate  of  price  inflation  has  been  applied  to  project  costs.  Price 
contingencies  based  on  expected  cumulative  inflation  over  the  implementation 
period as follows: 
In-kind contributions were calculated as the exemptions for VAT or withholding tax 
for  firms  and  NGOs  under  consulting  services,  and  as  exemptions  for  VAT  and 
import duties for vehicles and other items sourced from overseas under the goods 
category, and applicable taxes and duties on items paid by the government.

26. 
Figure  3  below  shows  how  the  funds  will  flow  from  ADB  and  the  Borrower  for  the 
implementation  of  project  activities.  MOWRAM  will  ensure  that  funding  is  available  for  all 
agriculture  support  activities,  including  the  farmer  field  schools,  demonstration  plots,  water 
management, and training on farming practices to improve productivity and crop diversification, 
and the SRP, as specified in the cost tables. For conservation activities for critical habitat in Stung 
Chinit  South  under  the  SRP,  MOWRAM  will  engage  relevant  MOE  staff  and  cover  the  costs. 
MOWRAM will also invite relevant MAFF and MOE staff to participate in the training on the WRIS, 
including water accounting and water productivity, with all training cost covered by the project.

FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT 
A. 
Financial Management Assessment 
The financial management assessment report9  was conducted under the TRTA in May 
27. 
2018  in  accordance  with  the  ADB’s  Guidelines  for  the  Financial  Management  and  Analysis  of 
Projects and the Financial Diligence: A Methodology Note; and the Technical Guidance Note for 
Financial Management Assessment. The objective of the assessment was to determine whether 
MOWRAM,  the  designated  executing  agency,  at  central  level  and  its  DFWUC,  the  designated 
implementing agency, have sufficient and suitable financial management systems to implement 
the project. The assessment focused on the country and public financial management systems, 
including accounting, budgeting, funds flow, financial reporting, auditing and internal control. The 
executing  and  implementing  agencies  are  to  replicate  identified  public  financial  management 
strengths, applying these as best practices in the project, while lessons from known weaknesses 
are analyzed as risks for which mitigation measures are proposed and an action plan established 
to ensure successful project implementation. 
28. 
The  financial  management  assessment  concluded  that  the  pre-mitigation  financial 
management risk level for the project is substantial. MOWRAM has the capacity to administer 
the  advance  fund  and  implement  statement  of  expenditure  (SOE)  procedures  since  it  has 
previously  worked  with  ADB  and  are  currently  implementing  several  ADB-funded  projects. 
MOWRAM is also part of the government’s comprehensive Public Financial Management Reform 
Program, which is being supported by an ADB grant. The MEF and MOWRAM have agreed to 
implement an action plan as key measures to address the deficiencies. The financial management 
action plan is provided in Table 6 below.  
Table 6: Financial Management Action Plan 
Weakness  
Limited capacity of PMU staff 
in project financial 
management. 
Although the PMU finance 
officer is gaining significant 
experience in project finance 
management (concurrently 
the finance officer of Loan 
3289-CAM), he lacks 
familiarity with the MEF FMM, 
and updated ADB loan 
disbursement procedures, 
and Peachtree or Sage. 
Mitigation Action  
Ensure the PMU finance staff 
are continually trained on 
budget preparation and 
execution, financial 
management and accounting, 
procurement, internal audit 
monitoring and evaluation 
under the PFMRDP,a which is 
supported by an ADB grant 
covering three ministries 
(including MOWRAM).  
Assign a project accountant 
(trained in financial 
management, accounting, 
and Sage under PFMRD) to 
assist the PMU finance officer 
or staff. Project accountant 
and cashier will be nominated 
from the Finance Department 
of MOWRAM.

Subprogram 2, and Grant Assistance to the Kingdom of Cambodia for the Public Financial Management for Rural 
Development Program. Manila.  
Weakness  
Limited capacity of PMU staff 
to prepare FMR. PMU staff do 
not have capacity to show 
financial information and 
physical progress in one 
report, as required in the 
FMM. 
The current project 
accounting system is semi-
manual with the limited use of 
Excel spreadsheets. 
The accounting software still 
needs to be installed in the 
PMU finance unit to be 
established and the PMU staff 
trained in this. 
Capacity in internal audit is 
limited. IAD staff comprises 
many staff assigned from 
other MOWRAM departments 
since 2007 but without the 
necessary educational 
background and a few new 
young staff with accounting 
degrees but lacking 
experience in internal audit. 
In addition, the IAD claims it

project accounts and physical 
progress. 
Procure an agreed software, 
that links project internal 
reporting activities with those 
at inter-department and -
agency levels to 
reduce/eliminate

Disbursement 
1. 
Disbursement Arrangements for ADB Funds 
The  loan  and  grant  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  Loan 
29. 
Disbursement  Handbook  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time),10  and  detailed  arrangements 
agreed upon between the government and ADB. Online training for project staff on disbursement 
policies and procedures is available.11 Project staff are encouraged to avail of this training to help 
ensure efficient disbursement and fiduciary control. 
30.  MOWRAM through the DFWUC will be responsible for: (i) preparing contract awards and 
disbursement  projections;  (ii)  requesting  budgetary  allocations 
funds; 
(iii) collecting supporting documents; and (iv) preparing and sending withdrawal applications, for 
liquidation and replenishment, to ADB. 
for  counterpart 
31. 
Advance  fund  procedure.  Immediately  after  project  effectiveness,  the  Government 
(through MEF) will open three advance accounts (one for  loan, one for the ADF grant, and one 
for the High-Level Technology Fund) at the National Bank of Cambodia (NBC). MEF will be the 
account holder and will delegate the authority to MOWRAM and DFWUC (PMU) to manage the 
accounts.  The  currency  of  the  advance  accounts  is  in  United  States  dollar.  MOWRAM  is 
accountable and responsible for proper use of advances to the advance account. Sub-accounts 
will be opened by provincial administrations, to cover expenditures for day-to-day operations in 
provinces  and  districts.  All  accounts  will  be  used  exclusively  for  share  of  ADB  eligible 
expenditures.  
The total advance to the respective advance accounts should not exceed the estimate of 
32. 
ADB’s  share  of  expenditures  to  be  paid  through  the  respective  advance  account  for  the 
forthcoming  six  months.  MOWRAM  may  request  for  initial  and  additional  advances  to  the 
respective  advance  account  based  on  an  Estimate  of  Expenditure  Sheet12  setting  out  the 
estimated  expenditures  to  be  financed  through  the  respective  advance  account  for  the

forthcoming  six  months.  Supporting  documents  should  be  submitted  to  ADB  or  retained  by 
MOWRAM  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2017,  as  amended from 
time to time) when liquidating or replenishing the advance accounts.  
Statement  of  expenditure  procedure.13  The  SOE  procedure  may  be  used  for 
33. 
reimbursement of eligible expenditures or liquidation of advances to the advance accounts. The 
ceiling of the SOE procedure is the equivalent of $100,000 per individual payment. Supporting 
documents and records for the expenditures claimed under the SOE should be maintained and 
made  readily  available  for  review  by  ADB's  disbursement  and  review  missions,  upon  ADB's 
request for submission of supporting documents on a sampling basis, and for independent audit. 
Reimbursement  and  liquidation  of  individual  payments  in  excess  of the SOE  ceiling  should  be 
supported by full documentation when submitting the withdrawal application to ADB. 
34. 
Before the submission of the first withdrawal application, the borrower should submit to 
ADB sufficient evidence of the authority of the person(s) who will sign the withdrawal applications 
on  behalf  of  the  government,  together  with  the  authenticated  specimen  signatures  of  each 
authorized person. The minimum value per withdrawal application is set in accordance with the 
ADB’s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time). Individual payments 
below this amount should be paid (i) by MOWRAM and subsequently claimed to ADB through 
reimbursement, or (ii) through the advance fund procedure, unless otherwise accepted by ADB. 
The  borrower  should  ensure  sufficient  category  and  contract  balances  before  requesting 
disbursements.  
2. 
Disbursement Arrangements for Counterpart Fund 
35.  Withdrawal  of  government  counterpart  funds  must  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with 
government  policies  and  procedures.  MOWRAM  will  be  responsible  for  submitting  withdrawal 
applications to MEF. Counterpart funds withdrawal applications should be made in accordance 
with  the  budget  plan  agreed  between  MOWRAM  and  MEF.  Counterpart  funds  may  only  be 
withdrawn  for  expenditures  of  the  project,  which  are  specified  in  the  project  agreements.  The 
government  will  finance taxes  and duties for (i) consulting  services through  firms; (ii)  imported 
goods; and (iii) goods and services procured by the government through tax exemption.  
36. 
Initial advance. PMU will complete the government withdrawal application form for the 
initial advance of counterpart funds and submit it to MEF–Department of Cooperation and Debt 
Management (DCDM). The maximum amount of the advance of counterpart funds will be agreed 
between MOWRAM or PMU and MEF.  
37. 
Replenishment. The PMU will complete the government withdrawal application form and 
attach  a  statement  of  actual  expenditure.  Supporting  expenditure  documentation  must  be 
maintained by PMU for subsequent review by MEF or audit.  
38. 
All government withdrawal application forms must be signed by the authorized signatories 
of MOWRAM or PMU and submitted to MEF. The government withdrawal applications must be 
(i)  sequentially  numbered  (starting  with  the  number  one),  and  (ii)  recorded  in  the  project 
counterpart funds withdrawal application register. 
39. 
DCDM  will  review  the  completed  forms  and,  in  conjunction  with  the  Finance  and 
13  SOE forms are available in Appendix 7B of ADB’s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from    time to 
time). 
38 
Administration Department, transfer the funds to the  project’s counterpart funds account in the 
NBC. DCDM will advise MOWRAM once the transfer of the advance has been effected. On receipt 
of advice from the NBC that the funds have been deposited into the counterpart funds account, 
the receipt of the funds should be recorded in the general ledger, and the government withdrawal 
application register must be updated. 
C. 
Accounting  
40.  MOWRAM  will  maintain,  or  cause  to  be  maintained,  separate  books  and  records,  by 
funding source for all expenditures incurred by the project following modified cash.  
D. 
Auditing and Public Disclosure 
41.  MOWRAM will cause the consolidated detailed project financial statements to be audited 
in accordance with International Standards on Auditing and in accordance with the government's 
audit regulations, by an independent auditor recruited by MOWRAM and acceptable to ADB. The 
audited project financial statements together with the auditor’s opinion will be presented in the 
English language to ADB within six (6) months from the end of the fiscal year by MOWRAM. 
42. 
The audit report for the project financial statements will include a management letter and 
auditor’s opinions, which cover: (i) whether the project financial statements present an accurate 
and fair view or are presented fairly, in all material respects, in accordance with the  applicable 
financial reporting standards; (ii) whether the proceeds of the loan and grant were used only for 
the  purpose(s)  of  the  project;  and  (iii)  whether  the  borrower  or  executing  agency  was  in 
compliance with the financial covenants contained in the legal agreements (where applicable). 
43. 
Compliance with financial reporting and auditing requirements will be monitored by review 
missions and during normal program supervision, and followed up regularly with all concerned, 
including the external auditor. 
44. 
The government, MOWRAM, and DFWUC have been made aware of ADB’s approach to 
delayed submission, and the requirements for satisfactory and acceptable quality of the audited 
project  financial  statements.14  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  require  a  change  in  the  auditor  (in  a 
manner consistent with the constitution of the borrower), or for additional support to be provided 
to the auditor, if the audits required are not conducted in a manner satisfactory to ADB, or if the 
audits are substantially delayed. ADB reserves the right to verify the project's financial accounts 
to  confirm  that  the  share  of  ADB’s  financing  is  used  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  policies  and 
procedures. 
14  ADB’s  approach  and  procedures  regarding  delayed  submission  of  audited  project  financial  statements:  (i)  when 
audited project financial statements are not received by the due date, ADB will write to the executing agency advising 
that (a) the audit documents are overdue; and (b) if they are not received within the next six months, requests for 
new  contract  awards  and  disbursement  such  as  new  replenishment  of  advance  accounts,  processing  of  new 
reimbursement, and issuance of new commitment letters will not be  processed; (ii) when audited project financial 
statements are not received within six months after the due date, ADB will withhold processing of requests for new 
contract  awards  and  disbursement  such  as  new  replenishment  of  advance  accounts,  processing  of  new 
reimbursement, and issuance of new commitment letters. ADB will (a) inform the executing agency of ADB’s actions; 
and (b) advise that the loan may be suspended if the audit documents are not received within the next 6 months; 
and (iii) when audited project financial statements are not received within 12 months after the due date, ADB may 
suspend the loan. 
39 
Public disclosure of the audited project financial statements, including the auditor’s opinion 
45. 
on the project financial statements, will be guided by ADB’s Access to Information Policy 2018.15 
After the review, ADB will disclose the audited project financial statements and the opinion of the 
auditors on the project financial statements no later than 14 days of ADB’s confirmation of their 
acceptability  by  posting  them  on  ADB’s  website.  The  management  letter,  additional  auditor’s 
opinions, and audited entity financial statements will not be disclosed. 
VI. 
PROCUREMENT AND CONSULTING SERVICES   
A. 
Advance Contracting  
46. 
All advance contracting will be undertaken in conformity with ADB’s Procurement Policy 
and  Procurement  Regulations  for  ADB  Borrowers  (2017,  amended  from  time  to  time).16  The 
issuance  of  invitations  to  bid  under  advance  contracting  will  be  subject  to  ADB  approval.  The 
Borrower, MEF, and MOWRAM have been advised that approval of advance contracting does 
not commit ADB to finance the project. There will be no retroactive financing. 
47. 
Advance  contracting    is  expected  for  11  contract  packages:  four  civil  works  (one  for 
Kamping  Pouy  subproject  and three  for  Prek  Po  subproject),  three  goods,  and four  consulting 
services. For the civil works and goods packages, bidding documents will be advertised before 
ADB Board consideration date with the aim that bid evaluation reports will be submitted to ADB 
prior to  project  effectiveness.  These contracts  are expected  to  be  awarded  within  3  months  of 
project effectiveness. For consulting services, request for expression of interest will be advertised 
before ADB Board consideration date with the aim that evaluation of technical proposals will be 
submitted to ADB prior to project effectiveness. All consulting service contracts are expected to 
be awarded within 2 months of project effectiveness. 
B. 
Procurement of Goods, Works, and Consulting Services 
48. 
All  procurement  of  goods  and  works  will  be  undertaken  in  conformity  with  ADB’s 
Procurement Policy and Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, amended from time 
to  time).  Open  Competitive  Bidding  (OCB)  for  international  advertising  will  be  used  for  the 
procurement of works and goods.17 Two consulting services packages, one for PMIC and one for 
the establishment of NWRDMC and WRIS consultant, will be recruited using quality- and cost-
based selection with a quality-cost ratio of 90:10. One individual consultant, National Accounting 
and Finance Specialist, will be recruited using the individual consultant selection method. Wildlife 
Conservation  Society  (WCS),  an  international  non-government  organization  with  an  office  in 
Cambodia,  will  be  directly  contracted  for  the  conservation  of  the  Bengal  Florican  in  the  Stung 
Chinit  South  subproject.  WCS  has  collaborated  with  the  government  on  the  conservation  of 
Bengal Florican for 15 years, and the results of its research were used to help the government 
establish a network of Integrated Farming and Biodiversity Areas in 2007, including in Baray near 
Stung  Chinit  South.  Since  that  time,  WCS  has  been  the  only  organization  that  has  provided 
technical  and  financial  support  to  the  government  to  protect  the  Bengal  Florican.  It  aims  to 
increase  the  involvement  of  communities  in  conservation  and  develop  sustainable  financing 
mechanisms for the protected areas where Bengal Florican occurs.

40 
Further, in 2014, WCS joined the SRP as the first conservation organization in the world 
49. 
to do so. Its SRP pilot in Cambodia, which was started in 2016, aimed to test whether the SRP 
standards will be used to help conserve Bengal Florican while increasing farmer livelihoods. It 
was the first pilot in Cambodia and has remained the largest. Through collaboration with Sansom 
Mlup  Prey,  WCS  has  continued  to  expand  this  pilot  and  used  the  results  to  help  the  SRP 
Secretariat improve version 2 of the SRP Standards. In collaboration with Sansom Mlup Prey, 
WCS will use the SRP standards to design cropping systems that are financially better for farmers 
and create a suitable habitat for the Bengal Florican. They will assist the project to use the SRP 
standards  to  identify  critical  points  within  farming  practices  and  the  value  chain,  where 
improvements can create win-win situations for people and wildlife. These are likely to include 
land  levelling,  which  improves  water  management  and  consequently  reduces  greenhouse  gas 
(GHG)  emissions  and  reduces  the  need  for  pesticides  and  herbicides,  while  also  increasing 
yields. WCS will also conduct trials of rotational cover crops to improve soil quality and reduce 
the need for fertilizers, while also creating a habitat for Bengal Floricans to breed. 
50. 
For  OCB  for  national  advertising,  before  the  start  of  any  procurement,  ADB  and  the 
government  will  review  the  Government  of  Cambodia’s  Standard  Operating  Procedures  and 
Procurement Manual for development partner financed projects to ensure consistency with ADB 
Procurement Policy and Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from 
time to time).

of the contract, and to have them audited by auditors appointed by ADB. 
A provision shall be included in all bidding documents for OCB with national advertising 
69. 
works and goods contracts financed by ADB stating that the Borrower shall reject a proposal for 
award if it determines that the bidder recommended for award has, directly or through an agent, 
engaged in corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices in competing for the contract in 
question. 
70. 
A provision shall be included in all bidding documents for OCB with national advertising 
works and goods contracts financed by ADB stating that ADB will declare a firm or individual 
ineligible, either indefinitely or for a stated period, to be awarded a contract financed by ADB, if 
it at any time determines that the firm or individual has, directly or through an agent, engaged in 
corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  coercive  or  obstructive  practices  or  any  integrity  violation  in 
competing for, or in executing, ADB-financed contract.

SAFEGUARDS 
Prohibited investment activities. Pursuant to ADB’s Safeguard Policy Statement (SPS, 
75. 
2009), ADB funds may not be applied to the activities described in the ADB Prohibited Investment 
Activities List set forth in Appendix 5 of the Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). 
52 
76. 
ADB  safeguard  classifications.  All  safeguard  documents  have  been  prepared  in 
accordance  with  ADB’s  SPS,  2009.18  In  compliance  with  ADB’s  information  disclosure  and 
consultation  requirements,  the  safeguard  documents  will  be  disclosed  on  the  ADB  project 
website.19 The safeguard classifications are A for environment, B for involuntary resettlement and 
C  for  indigenous  peoples.  Protection  of  biodiversity  is  a  key  issue  for  the  Stung  Chinit  South 
subproject  which  is  located  adjacent  to  an  Important  Bird  and  Biodiversity  Area  (IBBA)  which 
supports critically endangered bird species. MOWRAM is committed to implementing safeguard 
plans  and  adhering  to  ADB  and  the  government’s  safeguard  policies.  The  template  for 
Performance Monitoring, Evaluation, Reporting and Communication for safeguard monitoring and 
reporting requirements is in Appendix 3. 
that 
Project  safeguards  grievance  redress  mechanism.  ADB  SPS  requires 
77. 
Government establishes and maintains a grievance redress mechanism (GRM) to receive and 
facilitate  resolution  of  affected  peoples’  concerns  about  project  social  and  environmental 
performance.  PMU will establish the project safeguards GRM, as detailed in the safeguard plans, 
within  60  days  of  the  loan  effectiveness  date  or  before  the  implementation  of  land  acquisition 
activities, whichever is earlier. The GRM comprises a set of clear procedures to receive, record, 
and address concerns or complaints raised about safeguard issues at village, commune, district, 
and provincial levels. GRM focal points from the PMU, contractor teams, and communes will be 
identified and disclosed at construction sites and camps and each affected commune. Affected 
persons will have the option of seeking redress through existing channels, such as the Grievance 
Redress Committee or through the project’s GRM entry points. The PMIC will report monthly on 
the GRM to the PMU. The PMU will monitor and report on GRM to ADB in the project’s quarterly 
progress  reports  (QPRs)  and  semi-annual  safeguards  monitoring  reports.  A  separate  GRM  to 
address issues pertinent to land acquisition and resettlement will be established by the IRC/GDR 
and will operate during the pre-construction, construction, and operation phases. The GRM will 
be functional during the resettlement plan implementation. The GDR has the overall responsibility 
to ensure that the GRM is functional and working in accordance with the provisions specified in 
the resettlement plan. GDR will conduct training for the grievance redress committees. A training 
workshop  on  management  of  complaints,  including  procedures  for  recording,  registering,  and 
sorting  grievances,  conducting  an  initial  assessment  of  grievances,  determining  the  resolution 
process, making decisions, directing relevant agencies responsible for implementing decisions, 
and  tracking,  monitoring,  documentation,  and  evaluation,  etc.  will  be  provided  by  the  project 
management and implementation consultant’s (PMIC) social safeguards team to the concerned 
agencies in all levels after the GRM has been established to ensure that the GRM is effective and 
functional. 
78. 
Public consultation and information disclosure. Consultations were carried out at the 
project preparation stage and during resettlement due diligence. GDR and PMU/PIUs shall ensure 
that: (i) additional consultations during updating and implementation of the safeguards documents 
are  conducted; (ii) the  displaced persons  if  any   are  informed  about:  (a) resettlement  impacts, 
asset  valuation,  entitlements  and  compensation  payment  modalities  with  timelines,  (b) 
rehabilitation and income restoration measures suggested for the project displaced persons, and 
(c) grievance redress mechanism put in place by Inter-ministerial Resettlement Committee, with 
contact details of the grievance redress committees, and procedures for filing complaints; and (iii) 
liaison is maintained with affected persons and communities, and consultation meetings are held 
regularly  with  project  affected  communities,  project  displaced  persons  including  women  and

vulnerable  groups,  and  local  authirties  to  share  project  related  information  during  project 
implementation period.The draft resettlement plan for Kamping Pouy subproject and due diligence 
reports for Prek Po, Stung Chinit South, and Canal 15 subprojects were disclosed on the ADB 
website  on  12  August  2019.  The  draft  EIA  for  the Sung  Chinit  South  subproject,  and the  draft 
Initial Environmental Examination (IEE) for Prek Po, Kamping Pouy, and Canal 15 subprojects 
including EMPs were disclosed on the ADB website on 10 April 2019. The EMPs and resettlement 
plans will be translated into the Khmer language and provided to the PMIC to be made available 
to interested stakeholders on request. The final EIA, IEE, and resettlement plan will be updated 
and  disclosed  following  the  DED.  Semi-annual  safeguard  monitoring  reports  will  be  disclosed 
following  review.  Consultations  with  affected  persons  and  key  stakeholders  were  carried  out 
during project preparation and will continue during implementation as described in the safeguard 
documents. 
A. 
Environment 
79. 
Environmental  reports  and  approvals.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  A  in 
accordance with ADB’s SPS (2009). Three subprojects (Kamping Pouy in Battambang Province, 
Prek Po in Kampong  Cham  Province,  and Canal  15  in Takeo  Province) were  confirmed to be 
category  B  for  environment,  for  which  an  IEE  which  includes  an  EMP  was  prepared.  An  EIA, 
which includes an EMP, was prepared for the  Stung Chinit South subproject in Kampong Thom 
Province. The Kamping Pouy and Prek Po subprojects have progressed through DED. However, 
the Canal 15 and Stung Chinit South subprojects will be finally designed during the initial phase 
of project implementation. Therefore, the IEE, EIA and EMPs will be updated during DED. The 
EMPs will be included in the tender/bid documents. Baseline data and impact assessments are 
provided in the IEE, EIA and social and poverty impact assessments. Khmer language summaries 
of the IEE and EIA have been provided to MOWRAM. MOWRAM will obtain subproject approvals 
from MOE prior to the mobilization of the civil works contractors.  
80.  Environmental benefits. The result of the project irrigation and drainage facilities will be: 
(i) an increase in certainty and control of existing irrigation areas; (ii) expansion of reliable irrigation 
for multiple plantings in a year; (iii) longer cropping periods  in areas previously unavailable for 
parts of the year due to flooding; and (iv) more climate change and disaster resilient infrastructure 
and  practices.  This  will  not  only  lead  to  increases  in  area  and yield but  also, through  capacity 
building and training, a number of additional benefits, which will improve environmental conditions 
in the irrigated farming communes. This will include integrated pest management, efficient use of 
fertilizer, and water conservation farming practices. 
81. 
In  terms  of  sustainable  areas  sown  as  a  result  of  increased  irrigation,  the  project  will 
increase potential growing areas by 4,000 ha in the dry season at Kamping Pouy; up to 7,620 ha 
in the wet season and 6,800 ha in the dry season at Prek Po; by 4,800 ha in the dry season at 
Stung Chinit South; and 1,500 ha in the early wet season at Canal 15. The beneficiaries of these 
changes will be the local farmers, with flow-on effects to local commercial enterprises. Since rural 
populations are the poorest sectors of the Cambodian population, poverty alleviation effects will 
be direct.  
82. 
The  integrated  pest  management  will  promote  a  reduction  in  the  amount  of  pesticides 
used, resulting in reduced movement of pesticide residues in surface water and reduced risk of 
leaching of residues into groundwater and will include safeguards for farmers in the safe handling 
and use of chemicals. Fertilizer needs will be matched to soil nutrient levels and crop or water 
conditions to avoid overuse and leakage of nutrients into water resources. Training in farm water 
management to use water more efficiently will conserve seasonal water resources.  
54 
At the Prek Po subproject, a solid waste management component has been designed for 
83. 
the project implementation phase to provide alternative collection and disposal arrangements to 
avoid garbage clogging the main canal intake canal. The component will provide direct support 
for  existing  disposal  site  improvements  and  expansion  of  collection  and  development  of  a 
community-based waste management and action plan for the local Prek Po authorities. 
84. 
The total carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e) emissions generated by the combined four 
subprojects are low at 69,290 tons per annum. The reconfiguration and modernization of main 
and secondary canals and the planning of tertiary canals in both subprojects to maximize water 
delivery to farm fields through gravity will reduce the use of small pumps (which accounts for 50% 
to 60% of the total GHG generation) and will further reduce the GHG generation from this source. 
The  replacement  of  inefficient  diesel  pumps  at  the  Samput  pumping  station  in  the  Canal  15 
subproject with electric pumps will also result in significant GHG savings.   
85. 
Key environmental impacts and risks. During construction, the main issues will be air 
and  water  pollution,  noise  and  dust,  and  earthworks  and  spoil  disposal  -  all  of  which  must  be 
managed  by  strict  control  by  construction  contractors  and  supervisors.  Disruption  to  local 
livelihood  activities  is  anticipated,  and  this  will  be  minimized  by  work  scheduling,  site  access, 
consultation,  and  safety  planning.  Mitigation  of  construction-phase  impacts  relies  heavily  on 
responsibility  of  works  contractors  to  follow  specified  clauses  and  to  effectively  implement 
measures to minimize pollution of air and water and soil erosion.   
86. 
Irrigation schemes must be sustainable and responsibly managed to ensure that agreed 
irrigation flows are maintained and other water users are not disadvantaged. The feasibility study 
reports  for  the  subprojects  have  demonstrated  that  water  for  the  planned  levels  of  irrigated 
cropping is available and sustainable. The EMP requires clear and detailed water extraction plans 
for the cropping seasons, in line with the water use parameters established in the feasibility study 
reports,  to  be  prepared  as  part  of  each  scheme’s  operating  procedures  and  submitted  before 
construction.  
87. 
The  Stung  Chinit  South  subproject  is  located  adjacent  to  the  IBBA  which  includes  the 
Tonle Sap Northern Lowland Protected Landscape. This is an area characterized by seasonally 
inundated grassland and is a breeding habitat of the Yellow-breasted Bunting, Bengal florican, 
and  a  number  of  other  birds  listed  as  critically  endangered  on  the  International  Union  for 
Conservation of Nature Red List. In order to better understand project risks to critical habitat, a 
specialist report20 was commissioned by the TRTA. The report found that local people have seen 
floricans within 1.5 km of the subproject boundary. Given this, a second survey for endangered 
birds  with  more  extensive  and  systematic  field  survey  and  structured  interviews  was 
commissioned by ADB21. This survey confirmed presence of critical breeding habitat for Bengal 
floricans  in  the  IBBA,  just  1-2  km  west  of  the  command  area.  To  enhance  project  agricultural 
outcomes and mitigate potential induced impacts on threatened birds, the Wildlife Conservation 
Society (WCS) will be contracted to undertake a $920,000 sustainable rice cultivation program 
during  project  implementation  at  Stung  Chinit  South.  The  details  of  this  component,  including 
breakdown of tasks and TORs for all team members, are in Appendix 2 of this PAM as “Package 
CS-04-WCS: Sustainable rice cultivation”.

The  project  has  developed  a  Biodiversity  Action  Plan  (BAP).  The  WCS  supported 
88. 
sustainable rice cultivation program will provide the core foundations of mitigation of both direct 
impacts and potential induced impacts on biodiversity, and the BAP describes and codifies this 
intervention and its ongoing goals. It is anticipated that this component, if implemented effectively, 
will result in a net biodiversity gain, through stabilization and increase in grassland habitat and 
bird  numbers.  The  biodiversity  gains  are  key  performance  indicators  of  the  BAP  and  will  be 
monitored as part of the EMP. 
Civil  works  on  secondary  canals  have  been  designed  to  stop  short  of  the  subproject 
89. 
boundary  to  ensure  that  they  will  not  enable  dry  season  cropping  beyond  the  boundary. 
Management  of  the  use  of  agricultural  chemicals  will  be  implemented  through  the  project’s 
capacity  building  and  farmer  training  components  and  Sustainable  Rice  Platform  approaches. 
These are key performance indicators in the BAP which will be monitored as part of the EMP.  
There  will  also  be  community-based  disaster  risk  reduction  measures  implemented  alongside 
each subproject. 
Environmental  management  plan.  Mitigation  measures  for  identified  impacts  are 
90. 
included  in  the  EMPs.  The  EMPs  define  mitigation  measures;  supervision,  monitoring,  and 
reporting  requirements;  public  consultation  and  grievance  redress  procedures;  institutional 
strengthening  and  capacity  building.  The  EMPs  include  an  environmental  monitoring  program 
(which integrates BAP key performance indicators for monitoring impacts on biodiversity at Stung 
Chinit South). The monitoring results will be used to evaluate the following: (i) extent and severity 
of  actual  environmental  impacts  against  the  predicted  impacts;  (ii)  performance  of  the 
environmental  protection  measures  and  compliance  with  relevant  Cambodian  laws  and 
regulations as well as internationally accepted standards as in the IEE, EIA and EMPs; (iii) trends 
of impacts; and (iv) overall effectiveness of the EMPs. The monitoring plan includes the evaluation 
of KPIs for the BAP and will be reported on separately. The finalized EMPs and the BAP for Stung 
Chinit South based on the DEDs and cleared by ADB will form part of the bidding documents. 
Adherence to the EMPs will reduce residual impact significance to acceptable levels.  
91. 
Implementation of the EMP. MOWRAM, through its PMU, is responsible for overseeing 
the implementation of the EMPs. The capacity of the PMU to coordinate EMP implementation will 
be strengthened through the appointment of qualified staff and through training provided by PMIC. 
This  will  include  an  Environmental  Management  Officer  (EMO)  for  the  PMU.  An  international 
Environment Specialist and a national Environment Specialist will be part of the PMIC team to 
provide (i) training for PMU and contractors and (ii) technical support in EMP implementation. 
92. 
The PMU will engage and work with the PMIC to ensure that the IEE, EIA and EMPs are 
updated based on the DEDs and the bidding documents include the EMP and detailed instructions 
to bidders on required impact mitigation and monitoring requirements. The PMU EMO, with close 
support  of  the  PMIC,  will  be  responsible  for  supervising  EMP  implementation,  ensuring 
contractors'  compliance  with  environmental  management  requirements,  implementation  of  the 
monitoring  program,  and  coordinating  the  GRM.    PMU  will  submit  quarterly  project  progress 
reports (which will integrate an appendix on SRP and biodiversity monitoring) and semi-annual 
environmental reports to ADB.  
93. 
The  contractors  will  be  required  to  develop  site  environmental  management  plans 
(SEMPs) for each subproject site in accordance with the IEE, EIA and EMPs and environment 
safeguards  requirements.  These  shall  be  reviewed,  cleared,  and  monitored  by  the  PMIC 
construction supervision consultants and submitted to the PMU EMO for review. The contractors 
will be responsible for implementing the SEMPs during the construction phase of the subproject 
56 
under  the  supervision  of  the  PMU  EMO  and  PMIC.  Contractors  will  be  required  to  assign  an 
environmental health and safety officer responsible for SEMP implementation and supervision of 
occupational and community health and safety practices, as set out in the IEE, EIA and EMPs. 
Each works contractor will submit monthly progress reports to PMU. These reports will include 
reporting on EMP compliance. 
94. 
ADB  will  visit  project  sites  and  review  project  performance  against the EMPs  and  legal 
agreements. ADB will review periodic environment monitoring reports submitted by the PMU. If 
any of the safeguard requirements that are covenanted in the legal agreements are found not to 
be  satisfactorily  met,  ADB  will  require  the  PMU  to  develop  and  implement  an  appropriate 
corrective action plan agreed upon with ADB to rectify unsatisfactory safeguard compliance. ADB 
may  also  consider  suspension,  cancellation,  or  acceleration  of  maturity,  specified  in  the  legal

impacts,  (ii)  evaluate  the  options  available  to  address  them,  and (iii)  update  the  IEE,  EIA  and 
EMPs.

B. 
Involuntary Resettlement 
96. 
At  the  project  preparation  stage  the  project  has  been  classified  as  category  B  for 
involuntary resettlement impact. Based on preliminary designs, Prek Po, Stung Chinit South, and 
Canal 15 subprojects will not require land acquisition and/or resettlement. The preliminary design 
prepared for the Kamping Pouy subproject suggests that it will permanently impact 433.12 square 
meters of land and 15 households, of which 9 households will be physically displaced. 
97. 
Draft resettlement plan prepared for the Kamping Pouy subproject, and draft resettlement 
due diligence reports (DDRs) have been prepared for the Prek Po, Stung Chinit South, and Canal 
15  subprojects  in  accordance  with  the  principles  and  requirements  of  ADB's  SPS  and  the 
government's laws and regulations on land acquisition and resettlement. The draft resettlement 
plan and all the draft DDRs have been approved by the IRC and GDR,  and concurred by ADB. 
Following the final detailed engineering design of the Prek Po, Stung Chinit South, and Canal 15 
subprojects,  a field verification on  land acquisition  and resettlement  will  be  conducted.  Should 
there be any resettlement impacts identified, a resettlement plan consistent with the ADB’s SPS 
requirements will be prepared and submitted to the ADB for approval prior to start-up of any civil 
works. 
95.  GDR  will  update  the  draft  resettlement  plan  for  the  Kamping  Pouy  subproject  following 
DED  of  the  subproject  and  submit  to  ADB  for  approval  and  disclosure.  Upon  completion  of 
compensation payment, GDR will prepare a resettlement plan compliance report and submit to 
ADB  for  approval  and  disclosure.  This  report  will  serve  as  basis  for  ‘no  objection”  to  start 
construction.  
96.  MOWRAM  will  ensure  that  no  physical  or  economic  displacement  will  occur  until: 
(i) compensation  at  full  replacement  cost  has  been  paid  to  each  displaced  person  for  project 
components or sections that are ready to be constructed; (ii) other entitlements listed in the land 
acquisition  and  resettlement  plan  have  been  provided  to  the  displaced  persons;  and  (iii)  a 
comprehensive income and livelihood restoration program, supported by an adequate budget, is 
in place to help displaced persons improve or at least restore their incomes and livelihoods. 
97. 
Relevant project-related information has been disclosed in Khmer language to all affected 
persons,  local  communities,  and  local  authorities  during  project  preparation  through  various 
57 
individual and public consultations at the project preparation stage and will continue throughout 
project implementation. The draft resettlement DDR and the draft resettlement plan have been 
disclosed on ADB and MOWRAM websites. 
98.  GDR  is  responsible  for  overseeing  resettlement  plan  implementation.  GDR  will  ensure 
regular  coordination  of  the  updated  resettlement  plan  implementation  through  designated 
safeguards  focal  staff  and/or  coordinator.  The  international  and  the  national  social  safeguards 
and resettlement specialists from  PMIC will provide technical support to MEF-GDR in updating 
and monitoring resettlement plan implementation, as needed, and to PMU in internal monitoring 
of the updated resettlement plan implementation and preparing the safeguards sections of the 
QPRs to describe the safeguards implementation/compliance status, including the GRM.  
The  Department  of  Internal  Monitoring  and  Data  Management  of  MEF-GDR  will  be 
99. 
responsible  for  internal  monitoring  of  resettlement  plan  implementation  compliance  and  will 
submit  semi-annual  safeguard  monitoring  reports  to  ADB.  These  reports  will  describe  the 
progress of implementation of resettlement activities and any compliance issues and corrective 
actions  if  identified.  These  reports  will  closely  follow  the  monitoring  indicators  agreed  in  the 
approved resettlement plan. The cost of internal monitoring will be borne by MEF-GDR. 
100.  PMU will coordinate closely with IRC and the IRC Working Group on all matters concerning 
involuntary  resettlement.  It  will  work  closely  with  the  MEF-GDR  to  update  and  implement  the 
updated resettlement plan. As part of such coordination, PMU will ensure the DEDs for all the 
subprojects are shared with GDR, at the latest, with 2 weeks from their finalization, demarcation 
on the ground is conducted, and request GDR to initiate the update of the resettlement plan.  
101.  The IRC, technically supported by the MEF-GDR, is tasked to approve the allocation and 
release  the  resettlement  budget  as  part  of  government’s  counterpart  contributions.  IRC  shall 
ensure that funds for resettlement are judiciously spent and that the updated resettlement plan is 
implemented as planned. 
C. 
Indigenous Peoples 
102.  The  due  diligence,  including  social  impact  assessment,  conducted  at  the  project 
preparation  stage  found  that  the  project  will  not  directly  or  indirectly  affect  the  dignity,  human 
rights, livelihood systems, or culture of indigenous peoples or other ethnic minorities within the 
project  area  of  impact.  It  will  also  not  affect  the  territories  of  natural  or  cultural  resources that 
indigenous peoples own, use, occupy or claim as their ancestral domain.  Therefore,  the  project 
is assigned category C for indigenous peoples at the project preparation stage. 
103.  There are 256 households (996 persons) and 1,022 households (3,933 persons) of ethnic 
Cham  in  the  larger  command  areas  of  the  Canal  15  and  Stung  Chinit  South  subprojects, 
respectively. DDRs have been prepared for the Canal 15 and Stung Chinit South subprojects in 
accordance  with  the  requirements  of  ADB’s  SPS  (2009)  to  confirm  that  it  does  not  impact 
indigenous peoples or ethnic minorities.  
104.  Results of the due diligence showed that the Cham ethnic group is well mainstreamed in 
the society within the subproject areas, speak Khmer in addition to their own language, and are 
represented  at  commune,  district,  and  province  levels.  The  Cham  in  the  subproject  command 
area use Khmer language when communicating outside their home and use Cham language at 
home and when praying without any restriction and enjoy similar rights according to the laws as 
the  mainstream  Khmer.  The  local  Cham  have  representatives  in  the  communal,  district,  and 
58 
provincial councils and secretary of the government. In Canal 15, the Cham ethnic group in the 
command area use the Canal 15 mainly for transportation similar to the other locals. The canal is 
not the fishing area of Cham. Canal improvements will be done section by section, while the width 
of the canal is large enough to avoid any disturbance to transportation, as needed. The subproject 
secondary canals and the pumping station also do not affect any indigenous peoples or ethnic 
minorities. 
105.  For  the  Stung  Chinit  South  scheme,  the  subproject  implementation  will  not  cause  any 
impact on indigenous peoples or ethnic minorities in the command area. The villagers have not 
been using water from the subproject canal since 2012. They have been cultivating one season 
per  year  and  practicing  rainfed  agriculture.  Therefore,  blocking  water  in  the  canal,  section  by 
section during the construction phase, will not cause any negative impact on local farming, nor 
will it impact livelihoods.  
106.  During the DED of these two subprojects, the DDRs will be verified, and indigenous people 
categorization  will  be  confirmed  by  the  executing  agency,  and  an  updated  report  submitted  to 
ADB as needed. The project will not finance any subproject or component that triggers impact on 
indigenous peoples. 
D. 
Climate Change and Disaster Risk Management 
107.  Climate  and  disaster  risk.  The  TRTA  has  prepared  a  Climate  and  Disaster  Risk 
Assessment for the project. The project’s climate risk without mitigation is classified as medium. 
Key climate risks include increased precipitation intensity and variability and associated flood risk 
as  well  as  increased  drought  risk.  The  project’s  civil  works  have  been  designed  for  resilience 
against projected climate change, based upon increased hydraulic capacity of major canals for 
drought  storage  and  dedicated  land  drainage  channels  to  remove  flood  waters.  These  will  be 
supported in all subprojects by training and capacity building in water conservancy and climate 
resilient  farming  practices.  Disaster  risk  for  the  subprojects  is  primarily  from  peak  floods,  with 
droughts  the  next  most  threatening  hazard.  Disaster  risk  reduction  (DRR)  activities  within  the 
project focus on civil works to reduce the risk of extreme events and capacity building to increase 
disaster  preparedness  at  the  commune  and  village  levels.  The  estimated  incremental  cost  of 
climate change disaster measures for the project is $6.70 million. The estimated cost of DRR for 
the project is $6.62 million. 
108.  The major disasters directly addressed by the project are extreme floods and droughts, 
although resilience against the full range of potential disasters, including typhoons and epidemics, 
will be a benefit of the project’s capacity building in disaster management. 
109.  Civil Works. In the Prek Po subproject, drought is targeted by the design of the pumping 
station, which will be able to draw water from extremely low levels of the Mekong (at levels lower 
than  one  in  10  years  drought).  Both  flood  and  drought  are targeted  by the  project’s  hydromet 
stations repair, rehabilitation and training, since these stations will be able to provide early warning 
of these disasters as they develop. 
110.  At Kamping Pouy, the full extent of the increase of drainage capacity of drainage canals 
and infrastructure is a response to the likelihood of extreme floods from future increased rainfall 
intensity.  Strengthening  the  reservoir  weir  wall  at  the  Kamping  Pouy  reservoir  has  the  dual 
purposes of water security (prevent water loss through leaks) and weir safety (strengthen weir 
against failure). The weir civil works, therefore, address flood (weir failure) and drought (loss of 
water). 
59 
111.  Civil  works  at  the  Canal  15  subproject  will  significantly  increase the  depth of main and 
secondary canals. This will ensure more water is retained in the canals for the normal dry season, 
but the increased depth will also act to delay the onset of flood and marginally reduce extreme 
flood peaks. 
112.  At Stung Chinit South, repair and strengthening of the Stung Chinit Reservoir weir and 
spillway will ensure water security (prevent water loss through leaks) and, more importantly, will 
ensure weir safety (strengthening weir against failure), since the weir in its current condition will 
ultimately  fail.  The  civil  works  at  the  weir/spillway,  therefore,  address  flood  catastrophe  (weir 
failure) and drought (loss of water). 
113.  Capacity  Building.  In  all  subproject  areas,  training  of  commune  councils  and  village 
leaders in DRR and disaster management will be contracted by the project. It will comprise: (i) 
commune and village level training and participatory assessment and analysis of disaster risk; 
and  (ii)  commune  and  village  level  training  and  participatory  exercises  in  disaster  risk 
management. The training will continue the commune-level training in disaster risk already carried 
out  by  National  Committee  for  Disaster  Management  Secretariat  teams  under  the  ongoing 
Community-Based Disaster Risk Reduction grant project. 
114.  At Stung Chinit South, the promotion and establishment of SRP will develop a cohesive 
and  resilient  farming  community  with  higher  incomes.  This  will  increase  communities’  disaster 
preparedness and ability to get through a range of disasters and restore livelihoods. 
VIII.  GENDER AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS 
115.  During  project  preparation,  a gender  assessment was  conducted in  all  the  subproject 
areas to determine gender-related constraints and opportunities. This served as the basis for the 
preparation of the gender section in the summary poverty reduction and social strategy and the 
GAP, which includes actions and targets to ensure that women participate and fully benefit from 
the opportunities provided through the project.   
In all core subproject communities, gender conditions and relations are largely similar. The 
116. 
population density in the command areas is high compared with provincial averages. The majority 
of the population is Khmer, although there are several predominantly Cham communities in the 
Stung  Chinit  South  and  Canal  15  command  areas.  An  average  household  includes  4.5–5 
persons and the proportion of female-headed households is 50%–75% lower than the national 
average (27%). Between 2004 and 2012, poverty levels declined at least 10% and as much as 
40%  in  core  subproject  communes.  However,  as  many  25%  of  households  are  designated  as 
identified poor with 38–48% considered extreme poor. Net enrolment in primary education is high 
in most command areas (70–80%), except in the Prek Po Irrigation Subproject (65%); enrolment 
in lower secondary school drops significantly to 30%–40%. Throughout basic education, however, 
the gender gap has been nearly eliminated or reversed. This is reflected in literacy rates that are 
high for both women (93%–97%) and men (95%–99%).  
117. 
In  subproject  communes,  the  average  irrigated  landholding  is  1.5–3.0  ha;  most 
households own their land. However, 40–60% of households are land poor or landless. Women 
are active in all stages of rice cultivation, principally assisting their husbands, and are responsible 
for  record-keeping  of  costs  and  revenues.  Farming  is  the  primary  income  source  of  80%  of 
households. Secondary income sources include raising livestock, income from rental properties, 
60 
and  fishing  in  Cham  communities.  National  and  international  labor  migration  occurs  in  all 
subproject communities, involving 20%–30% of adult men and 15%–25% of adult women.  
118.  Women and men consulted in the core subproject communities agreed that women spend 
more  time  on  activities  related  to  family  and  household  matters. Outside  the  home,  the 
participation of women and men in community organizations is low. Women account, on average, 
for  17%  of  commune  councilors. In  FWUCs  where  membership  is  open  to  women  and  men, 
women  comprise  less  than  10%  of  members  and  less  than  5%  of  elected  members  of 
management committees. Women in management committees are normally designated as the 
FWUC  accountant. Low women’s  participation  is largely  due  to  deeply  entrenched  social  and 
cultural norms and views that women are weak and passive, and their opinions as less important 
than those of men.   
119.  Women and men agree that improved irrigation facilities will enable households to grow 
additional rice crops and that they are interested in paid work during project implementation. For 
women, the benefits of increased income from increased yields are greater time for their family 
responsibilities  and  more  money  for  children’s  education,  family  health  care,  and  upgraded 
housing. Women support initiatives to strengthen FWUCs, but they feel very strongly that married 
women with child care responsibilities do not have the time or family support to participate actively 
in local government or community activities, including FWUCs. Women and men are very clear 
about their priorities for training under the project: (i) management and leadership skills (and, for 
women, confidence-building) and accounting and financial literacy (to support women as FWUC 
accountants) that will support people’s economic activities as well as FWUC development; and 
(ii) adaptive and resilient technologies for agriculture and water resource management. 
120.  At the national and provincial levels within MOWRAM, women represent less than 10% of 
MOWRAM’s  staff  and  senior  management.  MOWRAM  has  endorsed  a  gender  mainstreaming 
action plan, yet it has not resulted in significant increases in staff knowledge or practices to adopt

121.  The  GAP  identifies  gender-responsive  actions  in  relation  to  the  two  key  outputs  of  the 
project. For the first output, these are: (i) strengthening women’s voice in project implementation; 
(ii)  strengthening  and  increasing  women’s  participation  (at  least  30%)  and  leadership (at  least 
25%) roles in FWUCs; and (iii) promoting women’s opportunities for paid work (25% women hired 
for  unskilled  labor  in  civil  works).  For  the  second  output,  gender  actions  include:  (i)  increasing 
women’s participation in trainings and capacity development in FWUC management and climate-
smart  agriculture  (40%  women  participants);  and  (ii)  assistance  to  MOWRAM  in  GAP 
implementation. In addition, skills-building sessions for FWUC members will be offered in each 
command area, including negotiation skills, accounting, members’ rights and responsibilities, and 
conflict  resolution  strategies.  Key  GAP  indicators  are  also  reflected  in  the  project  design  and 
monitoring framework (DMF). MOWRAM will track sex disaggregated information in its database 
and  will  be  in  charge  of  monitoring  the  GAP  through  the  gender  focal  point  in  PMU  with  the 
assistance of gender specialists in the PMIC team.  
122.  The project  will  implement  GAP  to  address  gender  issues,  such  as  low  participation  of 
women in  water  resources management,  low  participation  of  women  in  decision-making  in  the 
FWUC,  lack  of  leadership  and  communication  skills,  low  participation  of  women  in  FWUC 
activities, and lack of skills to participate in construction activities. The project will directly benefit 
women, who comprise 51% of the total commune population.

123.  GAP implementation arrangements. The responsibility for implementing the GAP lies 
with  the  PMU,  with  support  from  PMIC.  The  terms  of  references  of  team  leader,  deputy  team 
leader, and M&E consultants in PMIC will include relevant gender aspects related to their scope 
of work. An international gender consultant will be recruited for 4 p-m (intermittent) and a national 
gender consultant will be recruited for 25 p-m (intermittent), and will be responsible for guiding 
the  implementation,  monitoring,  and  reporting  on  the  GAP  throughout  the  project  period.  The 
individual gender consultant’s work plans should be aligned with the key milestones of the project 
outputs/activities related to the GAP. The PMU will support the national gender consultant needs 
to ensure that gender awareness and GAP implementation training is provided for all staff. The 
national  gender  consultant  will  need  to  ensure  that  gender-related  substantive  content  is 
integrated  into  capacity  development  activities  and  communication  strategies  of  the  project, 
whenever appropriate. Gender-related indicators will be included in the project M&E system, and 
data disaggregated by sex and age and other relevant factors will be included in project progress 
reports. An update or report on the progress of GAP implementation will be provided to ADB on 
a bi-annual basis.  Adequate resources (human and financial) have been allocated to implement, 
monitor, and report on the GAP, with consultants’ support funded by the loan and government’s 
staff time as in-kind counterpart contribution.

B. 
Monitoring  
124.  Project performance monitoring. A preliminary project performance monitoring system 
(PPMS) has been developed based on the key indicators and targets outlined in the project DMF. 
It  shall  be  established  after  the  implementing  agency  has  developed  comprehensive  PPMS 
procedures  and  plans  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Project  Performance  Monitoring  System 
Handbook within 6 months of loan effectiveness with the support of PMIC. The PPMS procedures, 
performance  indicators,  and  their  targets  will  be  reviewed  and  approved  by  ADB.  Benchmark 
review  mainly  focusing  on  secondary  data  will  be  conducted.  With  the  help  of  PMIC,  the 
implementing  agency  will  then  undertake  quantitative  and  qualitative  project  performance 
monitoring  for  each  project  component  every  6  months  to  evaluate  the  delivery  of  planned 
facilities and the project benefits that have accrued.  
125.  Compliance monitoring. A number of assurances have been given by the government 
to ensure smooth implementation of the project. Those are subject to the Loan covenants (Loan 
Agreement,  Schedule  5).  ADB  will  monitor  compliance  with  those  covenants  during  project 
implementation through regular review missions, QPRs submitted by PMU, and review of project 
accounts and procurement procedures. 
126.  EMP compliance verification and reporting. EMP and SEMP compliance monitoring 
will be undertaken by MOWRAM, through their PMU and with support of PMIC. PMU will report 
the  environmental  performance  of  the  contactors  and  environmental  compliance  through  the 
project’s QPRs  and semi-annual environment monitoring reports. A template for semi-annual 
safeguards monitoring report is included in Appendix 4. However, for this project, environmental 
and social safeguards reporting will be done separately. The reports should include the results 
of  periodic  environmental  quality/effects  monitoring  and  identify  any  environment-related 
implementation issues and necessary corrective actions. The operation and performance of the 
project  GRM,  environmental  institutional  strengthening  and  training,  and  compliance  with  all 
covenants under the project will also be included in the report.  WCS will prepare a quarterly 
monitoring  reports  on  progress  with  implementation  of  BAP  and  SRP  for  Stung  Chinit  South 
which will be an appendix of the main project quarterly project progress report. 
127.  Social safeguards monitoring. The resettlement plan includes the detailed monitoring 
and  reporting  requirements  for  involuntary  resettlement.  No  external  monitoring  of  involuntary 
resettlement  is  required  by  this  project.  Primary  responsibility  for  internal  monitoring  lies  with 
68 
PMU,  which  will  be  responsible  for  overseeing  the  formation,  function,  and  activities  of  the 
implementing  agencies  and,  through  semi-annual  monitoring  reports,  summarize  the  progress 
and compliance issues. MEF-GDR, as the technical arm of the IRC, will also assume the role of 
internal monitor on behalf of PMU and IRC, monitoring the implementation ofthe resettlement 
plan, ensuring that this is carried out in compliance with the project resettlement policy outlined in 
the  approved  updated  resettlement  plan  for  the  subproject  and  in  compliance  with  the  loan 
covenants/project agreements. All monitoring data on the resettlement plan will be collected to 
ensure  sex  disaggregation.  The  international  and  national  social  safeguards  and  resettlement 
specialists  of  PMIC  will  support  PMU  and  MEF-GDR  to  establish  a  system  to  implement  the 
internal  monitoring  plan  and  accompany  the  PMU  and  MEF-GDR  in  carrying  out  internal 
monitoring to assess whether the approved updated resettlement plan is implemented properly 
and if the involuntary resettlement objectives set out in the agreed resettlement plan are achieved. 
Semi-annual monitoring reports will be submitted to ADB for review, concurrence and disclosure 
on ADB website. 
128.  GAP monitoring. Regular monitoring of gender-related indicators contained in the DMF 
and  the  GAP  will  be  done  during  project  implementation.  The  PPMS  will  ensure  that  data 
disaggregated by sex is collected, analyzed, and reported on, wherever relevant, and will allow 
the monitoring of women’s participation in all project capacity-building and construction activities, 
training events, and meetings. GAP progress reports will be submitted to ADB at least on a semi-
annual basis using the GAP progress monitoring template in Appendix 5. Participatory monitoring 
of project impact will be implemented at the mid-term of the project, and this will include focus 
group discussions and interviews with female members and commune members who are not part 
of  the  FWUCs,  construction  workers,  and  community  members  to  obtain  quantitative  and 
qualitative data. Qualitative data on women’s empowerment and the expansion of their roles in 
FWUCs,  such  as  positive  changes  and  removal  of  constraints  affecting  their  participation  in 
FWUCs, will also be collected.    
C. 
Evaluation 
129.  The implementing agency, with PMIC support, will provide semi-annual updates on the 
project’s performance through the PPMS. The status of achievement of performance targets or 
indicators of the project’s outcome and output will be provided in the semi-annual updates. ADB 
review missions will review the PPMS semi-annually to evaluate the project’s performance and 
the likelihood of delivering the desired outputs and achieving the envisaged outcome. Corrective 
actions will  be  agreed with the  executing  agency  or  implementing  agency  and  recorded in  the 
aide memoires or MOUs and subsequently monitored by ADB and the executing agency. 
D. 
Reporting  
130.  The executing agency will provide ADB with: (i) QPRs in a format consistent with ADB's 
project  performance  reporting  system;  (ii)  consolidated  annual  reports  including  (a)  progress 
achieved by output as measured through the indicator's/performance targets,  (b) progress of 
the financial management action plan; (c) key implementation issues and solutions, (d) updated 
procurement  plan,  (e)  updated  implementation  plan  for  next  12  months,  and  (f)  safeguards 
monitoring reports; and (iii) a project completion report within 6 months of physical completion 
of the project. To ensure that the subprojects continue to be both viable and sustainable, project 
accounts and the executing agency’s annual financial statements, together with the associated 
auditor's report, should be adequately reviewed.  WCS will submit quarterly external monitoring 
reports on progress with implementation of BAP and SRP  for Stung Chinit South and submit 
direct to ADB. 
69 
E. 
Stakeholder Communication Strategy  
131.  Communication strategies. The main stakeholders of the project are categorized into 
government,  beneficiaries,  and  affected  persons  or  groups,  civil  society  organizations  and 
nongovernment organizations, the private sector, and development partners. These stakeholders 
will be targeted for different communication activities, which will involve the following direct and 
indirect communication strategies:  
(i) 
(ii) 
Full  access  to  all  project  information  will  be  provided  to  government  key 
stakeholders  through  multiple  communication  channels  (QPRs,  PPMS,  external 
monitoring reports on safeguards, and ADB mission aide memoires) to ensure they 
understand the project, its importance and the stakeholders’ responsibilities, and 
guarantee their participation in project planning and implementation. 
MAFF will directly participate in the WA+ training and agriculture support activities, 
while MOE will be working closely with nongovernment organizations (i.e., WCS) 
in the implementation of conservation activities.  
(iii)  MOWRAM, PDWRAM, and ADB will conduct regular consultations with FWUCs, 
beneficiaries,  and  affected  persons/groups,  such  as  FWUC  farmers  and  other 
water users, to ensure they are informed about the relevance of the project and 
are  updated  on  project  developments 
(e.g.,  project  planning,  design 
implementation, and expected contributions).  
(v) 
(iv)  Multiple  communication  channels  will  also  be  utilized  to  ensure  that  project- 
affected  persons  and  other  stakeholders  receive  adequate  advance  notice  of 
discussions and meetings. 
MOWRAM,  PDWRAM,  MOE,  and  ADB  will  also  conduct  consultations  with 
FWUCs and beneficiaries on project plans, conservation activities, and impact of 
the  project  on  target  groups  in  collaboration  with  civil  society  organizations  and 
WCS. 
Project  implementation  agencies  will  designate  focal  persons  responsible  for 
updating the MOWRAM website, which will provide the latest information that will 
guide stakeholders, participants, and partners in the implementation of the project. 
(vii)  Multiple communication channels will be utilized to: (a) inform private sectors on 
procurement  of  contracts;  and  (b)  ensure  that  project-affected  persons,  other 
stakeholders,  and 
receive  adequate 
international  development  partners 
information on project progress and performance.

ANTICORRUPTION POLICY  
133.  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its  agents,  any  violations  of  the 
Anticorruption Policy relating to the project.27 All contracts financed by ADB shall include provisions 
specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of the executing agency 
and all Project contractors, suppliers, consultants and other service providers. Individuals/entities on 
ADB’s anticorruption debarment list are ineligible to participate in ADB-financed activity and may not 
be awarded any contracts under the project.28   
134.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  are  included  in  the  loan  agreement,  project 
agreement, and bidding documents for the project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in 
connection with the project will include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine 
the records and accounts of the executing agency and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and 
other service providers as they relate to the project. 
XI. 
ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISM 
135.  People  who  are,  or  may  in  the  future  be,  adversely  affected  by  the  project  may  submit 
complaints  to  ADB’s  Accountability  Mechanism.  The  Accountability  Mechanism  provides  an 
independent forum and process whereby people adversely affected by ADB assisted projects can 
voice,  and  seek  a  resolution  of  their  problems,  as  well  as  report  alleged  violations  of  ADB’s 
operational policies and procedures. Before submitting a complaint to the Accountability Mechanism,

Appendix 2 
Annex 1: PILOTING OF AN IRRIGATION ASSET MANAGEMENT SYSTEM 
A. 
Background 
1. 
The Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) has established an annual recurrent funds 
to  support  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  and  the  strengthening  of  farmer  water  user 
communities  (FWUCs).  Implementation  of  this  modality  for  small  and  medium  scale  irrigation 
schemes  has  been  decentralized  to  the  Provincial  Department  of  Water  Resources  and 
Meteorology  (PDWRAMs)  with  oversight  by  the Ministry  of  Water  Resources  and  Meteorology 
(MOWRAM).  For  large  scale  schemes,  MOWRAM  has  the  responsibility.  MOWRAM  and 
PDWRAM  require  support  to  transition  this  modality  to  support  a  decentralized,  map-based 
Irrigation Asset Management System (IAMS) to support more effective, localized, FWUC-based 
planning and management processes. 
2. 
MOWRAM has adopted Participatory Irrigation Management and Development (PIMD) as 
the  guiding  principle  for  sector  development  and  management.  All  schemes  rehabilitated  and 
constructed  with  development  partners’  grants  and  loans  have  had  a  FWUC  established. 
However, due to reasons such as lack of sufficient dry season water source, lack of O&M budget 
and lack of FWUC strengthening budget, most schemes quickly lost functionality. Consequently, 
most schemes have not been able to achieve a sound economic base and only a few FWUCs 
have operated sustainably. Most state rehabilitated schemes do not have a functioning FWUC.  
3. 
Under the PIMD process, FWUCs are to be elected and established at the planning stage 
of new and rehabilitation schemes. Newly established FWUCs are to be assisted to prepare a 
FWUC  statute  registered  with  PDWRAM.  Before  handover  from  construction,  FWUCs  are 
required  to  enter  into  an  asset  responsibility  sharing  agreement  with  PDWRAM.  MEF  are  to 
provide funds to PDWRAM to continue to strengthen FWUCs until fully trained and experienced, 
and achieving a 95% or higher irrigation service fee collection rate. MOWRAM is to legally assign 
the full responsibility to FWUCs for assets and service provision to its members. 
4. 
O&M and FWUC strengthening modalities are set out in draft manuals prepared in 2014. 
These manuals are now being updated and are planned to be finalized and officially endorsed by 
the issuance of the Ministerial Prakas in 2019. The updated documents comprise three volumes: 
a guideline for irrigation scheme management, and manuals for O&M and FWUC strengthening. 
The three volumes should be updated again when the IAMS is operational. 
5. 
MEF is currently preparing its public investment management framework to strengthen the 
efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  public  spending.  They  have  advised  MOWRAM  that  budget 
request processes for O&M and strengthening FWUCs must be streamlined and better targeted 
to achieve best value. This will (i) include a  more thoroughly analyzed set of options for requests 
for O&M and FWUC budget; (ii) support budget requests with the use of provincial cost norms 
and benefit value assessments; (iii) commence monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of the irrigation 
O&M  and  strengthening  FWUC  program;  and  (iv)  be  proactive  in  scheme  management  as 
compared  to  being  a  custodian  of  assets.  An  IAMS  is  considered  to  be  integral  in  supporting 
MOWRAM, PDWRAM, and FWUCs in supporting these processes.

Package CS-02: CONSULTANCY SERVICES FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A NATIONAL 
WATER RESOURCES DATA MANAGEMENT CENTER AND A NATIONAL WATER 
RESOURCES INFORMATION SYSTEM 
A. 
Background 
1. 
Cambodia is generally rich in water resources, although water availability varies greatly in 
space and time. It is of great relevance to various government agencies and other stakeholders to 
have access to timely and reliable water data relevant to their purposes. 
2.  
Mandated  by  the  Government  of  Cambodia,  the  Ministry  of  Water  Resources  and 
Meteorology  (MOWRAM)  is  required  to  implement  the  Law  on  Water  Resources  Management 
(2007), and formulate and execute water policy and perform water resources  management. This 
includes  the  establishment  of  a  modern,  centralized  water  resources  inventory.  At  present, 
MOWRAM  has  a number of  databases  already  in  place, including  the  Cambodian  Irrigation 
Schemes 
irrigation;  HYMOS  platform  and  other  in-house 
databases used by the Department of Hydrology and River Works (DHRW) to store, process, and 
present hydrological data; and databases at the  Department  of  Meteorology (DOM) for doppler 
radar, weather, and climate data. 
Information  System  (CISIS)  for 
3. 
In addition to MOWRAM’s databases, there are other activities and projects where water 
resources related data is collected. At this stage, however, there is no mechanism for centralizing 
the storage of the data and to support sharing of the data. Quality control of the data to ensure 
what is collected can be used to support decision-making processes is also not yet established. 
This  scattered  landscape  has  resulted  in  challenges  on  data  and  information  exchange,  data 
sharing, and data management issues. 
4. 
In  2017,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  approved  the  Transaction  Technical 
Assistance (TRTA) for the Irrigated Agricultural Improvement Project (the project) (TA 9349-CAM). 
One  of the components under this TRTA is to support MOWRAM to strengthen water resources 
management  practices  in  Cambodia  by  developing  a  modern,  national  Water  Resources 
Information System (WRIS) to hold water resources related data including  ground observations 
(e.g.,  stream  water  levels),  analytical  information  (e.g.,  outputs  from  water  resource  modelling 
analysis),  and  remote  sensing  (e.g.,  maps).  The  TRTA  is  also  supporting  the  construction  of  a 
National Water Resources Data Management Center (NWRDMC) where the WRIS is to be located.  
5. 
The  WRIS  will  provide  a  central  location  for  water  resources  information  to  support 
sustainable  water  resources  management  and  development  decision  making  processes  in 
Cambodia. It is critical that the WRIS is a modern, adaptive system that can support continuous 
improvements of the quality and type of information stored. The NWRDMC is to provide a modern, 
state-of-the-art facility, to host the WRIS and technical departments of MOWRAM’s that have water 
resources management related responsibilities.

specifications, bill of quantities and relevant bidding documents. 
Supervision in the construction of the NWRDMC. 
Develop  a  modern  and  adaptive  national  WRIS  adhering  to  international  best 
practices.  
Support MOWRAM to establish sustainable O&M systems for the NWRDMC and 
WRIS.  
C. 
Scope of Services 
The consultancy firm scope of work includes support to MOWRAM but not limited to the 
7. 
following: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(v) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
Strengthen  national  management  of  water  resources  information  through  the 
establishment of the NWRDMC and the WRIS, and systematic processes for the 
collection, processing, storage, and dissemination of water resources information.  
Design a modern NWRDMC and WRIS based on the needs of the stakeholders 
involved  in  the  management  and  development  of  Cambodia’s  water  resources, 
and that meet international best practices. 
Ensure  the  WRIS  is  a  common  platform  for  integrating  water-related  and  non-
water-related information, and is a user-friendly, web-based system that includes 
visualization of data and maps. 
Ensure  the  NWRDMC  is  constructed  as  a  modern  national  center  for  water 
resources information. 
Ensure the  WRIS  integrates  all  existing  water  resources  related  databases  and 
has  to  compatibility  function  to  integrate  new  water  resources  information  and 
database as they become available over time. This include ground measurements 
(e.g.,  rainfall,  water  level)  and  satellite-derived  remote  sensing  data  (e.g., 
vegetation cover, crop over).1  
Ensure the WRIS is housed at the NWRDMC and that it is a central (national) hub 
for water resources information and in the future water resources analytics (e.g., 
modelling systems).   
Integrate data, information and knowledge, maps, and reports into one database 
system including relevant and accessible data from other ministries (e.g., Ministry 
of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries [MAFF] and Ministry of Environment [MOE]). 
(viii)  Build  the  capacity  development  of  MOWRAM  staff  to  operate  and  maintain  the 
NWRDMC and the WRIS including the provision of water resources information to 
meet stakeholders needs.  
(vii) 
(vi) 
1   As hydrometeorological (hydromet) station density in Cambodia is poor, the potential added value of remote sensing 
data  is  significant.  By  providing  quantitative  information  on,  for  example,  rainfall,  evapotranspiration,  vegetation 
cover, and crop growth, current state-of-the-art remote sensing data products will be able to support decision makers 
in a variety of sectors related to water management. The WRIS is to include integration of different type of data sets 
and water related information (e.g,. GIS, remote sensing data, model results, maps, reports) to provide end-users 
with the most credible information.

Appendix 2 
Package CS-04-WCS: SUSTAINABLE RICE CULTIVATION IN STUNG CHINIT SOUTH 
SUBPROJECT 
A. 
Background 
1. 
The  Irrigated  Agricultural  Improvement  Project  (the  project)  will  support  the  Ministry  of 
Water  Resources  and  Meteorology  (MOWRAM)  of  the  Government  of  Cambodia  to:  (i) 
modernize, and improve climate and disaster resilience of four irrigation systems in Battambang, 
Kampong Cham, Kampong Thom, and Takeo provinces to supply water to 43,500 hectares (ha) 
for  291,847  persons,  of  whom  148,288  (51%)  are  women;  (ii)  ensure  sustainability  of  these 
irrigation  schemes  by strengthening  institutional and financial  capacity  of  the  government  staff 
and farmer water user communities (FWUCs) in operations and maintenance (O&M); (iii) improve 
farming practices for increased agriculture productivity and crop diversification; and (iv) establish 
a national water resources data management center (NWRDMC), a water resources information 
system  (WRIS),  and  an  irrigation  asset  management  system  for  better  water  resources 
management, planning, operations and investment.  
2. 
One of the sites selected for subprojects is Stung Chinit South Irrigation System, in the 
south of Kampong Thom province, stretching between the Stung Chinit River in the north and the 
Stung Kompong Sor in the south. Irrigation water is drawn from the Stung Chinit Reservoir, from 
which there are two main canals. One runs north for 7 kilometer (km) and serves a command 
area called Stung Chinit North. The other main canal runs south for 35 km and serves a command 
area of about 19,900 hectares(ha) called the Stung Chinit South irrigation system. Sections of the 
Stung Chinit South main canal of length (about 3 km) have also been rehabilitated as part of the 
Stung Chinit North Project. 
3. 
About 3,900 ha of the Stung Chinit South command area is being developed by another 
ADB funded project, the Climate Resilient Rice Commercialization Sector Development Program 
(Rice SDP). Excluding this area, the Stung Chinit South subproject targets an area of 16,000 ha 
from 11 communes in Baray and Taing Kork districts. Currently the system is equipped with one 
main canal of 37 km and 75.78 km of secondary and tertiary canals. However, there are no farmer 
water user communities (FWUCs) taking responsibility of the canal operation and maintenance, 
the  canals  have  gradually  silted  up  with  eroded  and  overgrown  banks,  and  their  regulatory 
structures have deteriorated to a point where the system cannot provide reliable irrigation services 
to the full potential target area, especially for dry season crops. 
The area of influence of the Stung Chinit South subproject includes critical habitat for the 
4. 
critically endangered Bengal Florican, and supports an additional two critically endangered bird 
species  (White-shouldered  Ibis  and  Yellow-breasted  Bunting)  outside  of  the  breeding  season. 
Field surveys, interviews, and a specialist report for these three species were commissioned as 
preparation  for  this  project.  These  identified  recent  non-breeding  records  of  all  three  species 
within and outside the subproject command area. The area of influence supports non-breeding 
populations of ibis and buntings that are too low to qualify it as critical habitat. However, the area 
to the  west  of  (outside  of)  the  command  area  provides  breeding  habitat for  globally  significant 
numbers of Bengal Florican, and thus represents critical habitat for the species. Further to the 
west of the command area lies the Baray section of the Northern Tonle Sap Protected Landscape 
which, with adjoining areas to the southwest, supports the second largest remaining population 
of Bengal Florican in Cambodia and is thus also critical habitat for the species. All of these areas 
mentioned to the west of the subproject are part of the Stung Sen/Santuk/Baray Important Bird 
and Biodiversity Area (IBBA) which was the precursor to the declaration of the Northern Tonle 
Sap  Protected  Landscape.  The  Baray  and  Chong  Doung  sections  of  the  IBBA  overlap  the 
Appendix 2 
113 
boundaries  of  the  Northern  Tonle  Sap  Protected  Landscape,  but  intensive  rice  cultivation  has 
meant that Bengal Florican is largely or entirely extirpated from Chong Doung and the northern 
part of Baray. 
A number of design features at Stung Chinit South guard against environmental impacts 
5. 
and  promote  environmental  sustainability,  with  a  particular  focus  on  potential  subproject  risks 
posed to Bengal Floricans. The location of the subproject was checked against the Ministry of 
Environment’s  (MOE)  maps  of  protected  areas,  and  the  western  boundary  was  delineated  to 
ensure that it did not encroach upon the Northern Tonle Sap Protected Landscape. Following site 
survey  for  screening,  the  western  boundary  was  further  amended  to  provide  a  buffer  zone 
between the subproject’s command area and the Northern Tonle Sap Protected Landscape. This 
amended boundary also avoids direct encroachment on the Stung Sen/Santuk/Baray IBBA.  
6. 
The IBBA now forms a buffer zone to the Northern Tonle Sap Protected Landscape, where 
land  conversion  should  not  occur.  Subproject  civil  works  on  secondary  canals  have  been 
designed to stop at the subproject boundary and thus constrain irrigation supply to areas beyond 
the boundary to curtail land conversion.  
7. 
Capacity building and farmer training components of the subproject will include education 
for  farmers  about  not  hurting  any  birds  which  might  stray  into  the  command  area,  organized 
patrolling and payment for biodiversity protection services, and reduction of potentially-harmful 
pesticide use. 
8. 
Despite  the  above  features  of  subproject  design,  potential  remains  for  impacts  of  the 
Stung Chinit South subproject on the three critically endangered bird species. Dry  season rice 
cultivation in the command area, spurred by the subproject, is predicted to result in some minor 
seasonal habitat loss for both species, which are mainly supported by grassland areas or fallow 
areas between rice crops. This is likely to occur across 6,000 ha (approximately one third of the 
command  area)  for  about  2  months  per  year  (late  December  or  early  January  through  to  late 
February or early March). Further, an overall increase in chemical use in the command area, to 
support multiple rice crops each year, is likely to reduce food availability for both species. Last, 
and most importantly, are potential indirect impacts. There is potential for unauthorized pumping 
of water or extension of canals from the west of the command area into areas known to support 
all three species, including breeding populations of Bengal Florican. Such induced extension of 
irrigation would allow further conversion of the florican’s grassland habitat for agriculture. Such 
risks are likely to increase after completion of the subproject, when there is less management and 
oversight. The subproject thus includes a sustainable rice cultivation package. This will not only 
serve  as  mitigation for these potential  impacts  on Bengal  Florican  and  other  highly-threatened 
bird species, but also complement project goals to benefit local farmers.  
The  Sustainable  Rice  Platform  (SRP)  is  a  multi-stakeholder  platform  to  increase  the 
9. 
sustainability of rice cultivation, through increased profitability, productivity, efficiency of inputs, 
food  safety,  reduced  greenhouse  gas  emissions,  and  social  benefits,  as  measured  under  an 
established  standard  (http://www.sustainablerice.org).  The  standard  incorporates  specific 
environmental  conservation  measures,  including  maintenance  and  creation  of  habitat  for 
threatened  species.  The  SRP  standard  has  been  successfully  piloted  at  four  locations  in 
Cambodia over the last 3 years, including in Stoung District of Kampong Thom Province, and is 
now ready for broader application.

10. 
The  objective  of  this  assignment  is  to  support  MOWRAM,  the  executing  agency,  to 
develop and implement a sustainable rice cultivation program that supports local livelihoods and 
mitigates  potential  project-induced  impacts  upon  grasslands  and  their  three  threatened  bird 
species (Bengal Florican, White-shouldered Ibis and Yellow-breasted Bunting) in the Stung Chinit 
South subproject command area and the IBBA immediately to its west. This approach will include 
(i) encouraging adoption of the SRP standard by local farmers within the subproject command 
area and the IBBA to the west, through awareness raising of the SRP and its benefits of improved 
yields and reduced input costs; (ii) supporting farmers in this area to meet threshold values for all 
SRP sustainability measures, and to further increase scores for water use, agricultural inputs and 
biodiversity; (iii) facilitating access to international buyers of SRP rice; (iv) supporting FWUCs and 
MOWRAM in identifying unauthorized pumping of water or extension of canals from the command 
area into the IBBA, so that MOWRAM can halt such activities; (v) participation in development of 
MOWRAM’s  water  resources  management  plan  for  the  wider  Tonle  Sap  Basin  Group; 
(vi) supporting protection of critical grassland habitats from potential project-induced impacts; (vii) 
supporting  conservation  of  natural  habitats  and  threatened  birds,  while  also  benefiting  local 
livelihoods – through awareness raising, enforcement of existing laws, encouraging cattle grazing 
to  maintain  grasslands,  encouraging  floating  rice  cultivation  in  currently-farmed  areas, 
establishment of ecotourism, and payments for finding and protection of threatened bird nests; 
(viii) monitoring of grassland extent and threatened bird populations to determine the strategy’s 
success; and (ix) seeking ongoing long-term financing to sustain this environmental mitigation for 
the duration of the project’s potential impacts.  
The overall  goal  of this assignment  is to  support  planned intensification of  existing rice

cultivation while preventing  project-induced  conversion  of  existing  grassland  to  rice  cultivation, 
leading to stabilization of populations of the three critically endangered bird species. Such actions 
have the potential to conserve a third of the Cambodian population of Bengal Florican, a major 
contribution to the global survival of the species. 
12. 
The  Wildlife  Conservation  Society  (WCS)  is  an  international  conservation  organization, 
headquartered  in  New  York  and  with  a  country  office  in  Cambodia.  It  is  the  only  organization 
sufficiently experienced and qualified to deliver this assignment, owing to its successful piloting 
of  the  Sustainable  Rice  Platform  in  Kampong  Thom  Province,  and  long-term  focus  on 
conservation  of  Tonle  Sap  grassland  sites  and  Bengal  Floricans.  Although  WCS  works  with 
government and national nongovernment partners to achieve these goals, no other organization 
within,  or  outside,  Cambodia  approaches  the  level  of  experience  WCS  has  in  sustainable  rice 
cultivation in a similar context to this subproject. WCS pioneered the use of Integrated Farming 
and Biodiversity Areas for grassland habitats around the Tonle Sap, which ultimately led to the 
establishment of the Northern Tonle Sap Protected Landscape near the command area. WCS 
also has substantial expertise in Cambodia with other elements of this assignment, most notably 
ecotourism and nest protection; no other organization has demonstrated similar levels of success 
in Cambodia with these conservation approaches. 
The consultant will report to the Project Director of MOWRAM. WCS shall propose how 
13. 
their team will be able to provide the required services to the executing agency.
