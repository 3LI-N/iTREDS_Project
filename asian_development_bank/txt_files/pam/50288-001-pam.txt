Project Administration Manual’s Purpose and Process 
1. 
The  project  administration  manual  (PAM)  describes  the  essential  administrative  and 
management requirements to implement the project on time, within budget, and in accordance 
with  Government  of  Philippines  (Government)  and  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  policies 
and procedures. The PAM should include references to all available templates and instructions 
either through linkages to relevant URLs or directly incorporated in the PAM. 
The Department of Finance (DOF) as the executing agency; the Department of Public 
2. 
Works and Highways (DPWH), and the Department of Transportation (DOTr) as implementing 
agencies, are wholly responsible for the implementation of this ADB-financed project, as agreed 
jointly  between  the  Government  and  ADB,  and  in  accordance  with  Government  and  ADB’s 
policies  and  procedures.  ADB  staff  is  responsible  to  support  implementation  including 
compliance by the DOF, DPWH and DOTr with their obligations and responsibilities for project 
implementation in accordance with ADB’s policies and procedures. 
At  loan  negotiations,  the  borrower  and  ADB  shall  agree  to  the  PAM  and  ensure 
3. 
consistency with the loan agreement. Such agreement shall be reflected in the minutes of the 
loan negotiations. In the event of any discrepancy or contradiction between the PAM and the 
loan agreement, the provisions of the loan agreement shall prevail. 
4. 
After ADB Board approval of the project's report and recommendations of the President 
(RRP),  changes  in  implementation  arrangements  are  subject  to  agreement  and  approval 
pursuant to relevant Government and ADB’s administrative procedures (including the Project 
Administration  Instructions  of  ADB)  and  upon  such  approval  they  will  be  subsequently 
incorporated in the PAM.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
A. 
Rationale 
Accelerating Infrastructure Investment. The current administration under the Ten-Point 
1. 
Socioeconomic Agenda1 aims to ramp up public infrastructure projects such as national roads, 
expressways,  bridges,  airports,  subways,  and  railways.  Public  spending  on  infrastructure  is 
expected  to  reach  7%  of  gross  domestic  product  (gross  domestic  product)  by  2022—or 
approximately $14.5 billion annually, from the current level of 3.4% of gross domestic product in 
2016. To materialize the goals of infrastructure investment, the government requested the Project 
from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to help the two key agencies responsible for national 
public infrastructure projects, namely the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) and 
the Department of Transportation (DOTr), conduct pre-investment activities which will in turn help 
accelerate  the  Investment  Coordination  Committee  (ICC)  review  and  approval  process  and 
ensure timely, high-quality procurement and implementation.2 
Core Development Problem. Infrastructure enables access to work, markets, education, 
2. 
healthcare, housing, and other services that allow people to uplift their standards of living. Lack 
of or underdeveloped infrastructure has been identified as one of the most significant constraints 
to the Philippines’ growth prospects. While the country has improved consistently in the Global 
Competitiveness Ranking from 65th in 2012–2013 to 57th in 2016–2017, its overall infrastructure 
significantly  lacks  behind  other  emerging  Southeast  Asian  countries.  In  2016–2017,  the 
Philippines was ranked 112th out of 138 countries in terms of infrastructure quality, well below 
other Southeast Asian countries, such as Malaysia (19th), Thailand (72nd), and Indonesia (80th). 
The impacts of underdeveloped public infrastructure are high costs of doing business, which, in 
turn,  undermine  business  potential  and  economic  opportunities,  especially  in  rapidly  growing 
urban areas.  Significant catch-up  in infrastructure development  is  needed  in  the  Philippines  to 
realize the country’s potential and remain competitive. 
3. 
Infrastructure Development Constraints. Underdeveloped infrastructure is attributed to 
five  factors:  (i)  inadequate  infrastructure  investment;  (ii)  lack  of  inter-agency  coordination;  (iii) 
inadequate or incomplete infrastructure plans and implementation programs; (iv) limited access 
to  international  expertise  and  constrained  technical  and  management  know-how  in  project 
preparation and implementation; and (v) inadequate sustainability of infrastructure. Coordination 
between the two main agencies responsible for infrastructure (DPWH and DOTr) and other key 
agencies  is  limited,  which  constrains  project  preparation  and  implementation.  Infrastructure 
projects are often not delivered as planned due to either dated project formulation or dated project 
implementation, or both. Delays in safeguard compliance, procurement, and land acquisition as 
well as inadequate project management systems delay timely project delivery. The lack of project 
management and monitoring systems also implies that infrastructure is often delayed, inefficiently 
operated, and inadequately maintained, thereby undermining sustainability of project benefits. 
4. 
Tackling  constraints  to  infrastructure  planning,  design,  and  implementation.  To 
enhance  national  capacity,  additional  access  to  international  sources  of  innovation,  expertise, 
advice, and best practices would enable DPWH and DOTr to incorporate expertise and innovation 
in  project  formulation  and  implementation.  An  ADB-funded  Project  and  its  international 
procurement systems would facilitate DPWH and DOTr access to required specific technologies, 
international  expertise,  and  innovation,  complementing  and  building  on  nationally  available 
1  The Ten-Point Socioeconomic Agenda, as presented during the 'Sulong Hakbang Tungo sa Kaunlaran' consultative 
workshop held on 20–21 June 2016. 
2  The Government’s official request for ADB’s assistance was made on 8 February 2017. 
2 
expertise. The Project will help DPWH and DOTr to more effectively execute and implement public 
infrastructure projects by accelerating the due diligence stages, detailed engineering designs, and 
the bidding process preparation. 
A Medium-term Solution. The Project offers a short- to medium-term solution to meet 
5. 
the near term needs for increased capacity of DPWH and DOTr in preparing public infrastructure 
projects  in  the  Philippines.  ADB  has  supported  the  government  to  address  infrastructure 
constraints  through  infrastructure  projects  and  providing  access  to  international  best  practices 
and innovation through project loans. The Project will supplement these interventions by providing 
DPWH and DOTr with easier access to international expertise and best practices. They will allow 
the  government  to  act  on  its  Ten-Point  Socioeconomic  Agenda  to  support  the  increase  in 
spending  on  public  sector  infrastructure.  In  addition,  the  Project  will  provide  support  for  the 
preparation  of  the  long-term  solution  to  the  problem  by:  (i)  building  capacity  of  government 
agencies  to  effectively  plan,  identify,  design,  manage,  and  implement  projects;  and  (ii)  set  the 
groundwork for a holistic examination of the current national procurement system and develop 
options for additional efficiency in its implementation. A separate TA Grant (TA 9336) has been 
provided  to  timely  support  capacity  development  and  system  management  of  public  sector 
infrastructure development in the key agencies of National Economic and Development Authority 
(NEDA), DPWH, and DOTr in the short-to-medium term.3 
Alignment  with  the  ADB  Strategic  Agenda.  The  Project  is  included  in  the  Country 
6. 
Operations and Business Plan 2017–2019. It contributes to the inclusive economic growth and 
environmentally-sustainable growth agenda of ADB’s Midterm Review of Strategy 2020.4 
Value  added  by  ADB  assistance.  The  project  will  build  upon  ADB’s  successful 
7. 
experience supporting the Public–Private Partnership Center for the Philippines and enhance the 
government  public  sector  agencies’  institutional  set-up  and  capacity  to  identify,  finance,  and 
implement public-financed projects. The project will also be supported by the separate TA grant 
which will develop a public infrastructure project system management procedure and strengthen 
capacity of DPWH and DOTr staff to effectively implement and monitor projects. 
8. 
The ADB assistance will provide value addition in the direct support to DPWH and DOTr 
in delivering more effective and innovative infrastructure projects through: (i) enhanced effectivity 
of identification, analysis, and planning for infrastructure gaps using international best practices, 
especially roads, urban transport, urban water, sanitation, and flood management; (ii) addressing 
critical  constraints  such  as  resettlement  processes  and  inadequate  access  to  international 
knowledge, best practices, innovation, and technology; and (iii) implementation management of 
sophisticated  public  infrastructure  projects  with  international  expertise  to  supplement  national 
expertise and resources. The project will also help define key operational areas for ADB through 
gap analysis and support for country system development in key areas such as (i) land acquisition; 
(ii) procurement; and (iii) start-up delays.5 A TA loan is proposed as the financing modality.

a  The Steering Committee comprises: DOF, DPWH, DOTr, NEDA, and Department of Budget and Management. 
b  DPWH will utilize four clusters of the Unified Project Management Office: (i) Road Management Clusters I and II and 
Bridge Management Cluster for road and bridge projects under Output 1; and (ii) Flood Control Management Cluster 
for water projects for flood protection under Output 2. 
D. 
Implementation Arrangements 
18. 
The Department of Finance (DOF) will be the executing agency and DPWH and DOTr will 
be  the  implementing  agencies.  DOF  will  establish  a  steering  committee  to  monitor  overall 
implementation of the Project and ensure supported projects are prioritized for preparation and 
implementation. DPWH and DOTr will each establish three project management units (PMU), two 
PMUs under DPWH for road and bridge projects and for water projects, and one under DOTr for 
public transportation systems projects. Each PMU will be headed by a Director or any authorized 
official, and supported by administrative staff to lead the preparation of infrastructure projects and 
oversee the consultant outputs. 
An indicative list of projects to be supported under the Project is provided in Appendix 1. 
19. 
The projects are based on the priorities as agreed with government during Loan Fact Finding. 
During the implementation of the Project, the list of projects may be amended and/or updated, as 
mutually agreed between ADB and the Government. 
20. 
The projects prepared under the Project will normally cover such aspects as: (i) feasibility 
study;  (ii)  detailed  design,  including  engineering,  safeguards,  project  structure,  economics 
12 
analysis,  financial  assessment,  procurement  plan,  and  implementation  arrangements;  and  (iii) 
preparation of procurement documents ready for tendering. 
Timely budgeting for infrastructure investments identified and prepared under the Project 
21. 
will be opened to funding from either government or ODA. 
IV. 
COSTS AND FINANCING 
The  Project  estimated cost  is  $160.00 million,  without the financing charges  during the 
22. 
implementation period. 
23. 
ADB will provide a technical assistance loan of $100 million from ADB’s ordinary capital 
resources.  The  government  will  provide  the  equivalent  of  $60.00  million  to  finance  part  of  the 
consulting services and taxes and duties.8Financing charges during implementation is estimated 
to be $4.06 million, which will be covered by the government through annual budget allocation. 
The financing plan is shown in Table 4.

A. 
Cost Estimates Preparation and Revisions 
24. 
The cost estimates were prepared by ADB in consultation with DOF, DPWH, and DOTr. 
The costs are based on the type of consultants required for the various outputs, taking account 
of their sector and working experience. Following the screening of projects costs estimates may 
be  revised  to  reflect  the  focus  of  project  support  required,  any  such  changes  will  be  agreed 
between DPWH and/or DOTr and ADB. 
B. 
Key Assumptions 
25. 
The following key assumptions underpin the cost estimates and financing plan: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
exchange rate: P49.495 = $1.00 (as of 28 June 2017); 
as  the  loan  will  procure  consulting  services,  there  are  no  provisions  for  price 
contingencies; and 
in-kind contributions were calculated based on the number and type of counterpart 
staff to be provided by Government. 
8  The Government’s administrative costs are estimated at $2.31 million–$1.54 million for DPWH and $0.77 million for 
DOTr. These include airfares, per diem, and reimbursable expenses. However, this cost is not reflected in the project 
cost estimates. Only identifiable and quantifiable government costs are reflected in this section.

FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT 
A. 
Financial Management Assessment 
The financial management assessment of DPWH and DOTr was conducted in March 2017 
26. 
in accordance with ADB’s Guidelines for the Financial Management and Analysis of Projects and 
the Financial Due Diligence: A Methodology Note. This included an assessment of the financial 
management  capacity  of  DPWH  and  DOTr,  including  funds-flow  arrangements,  staffing, 
accounting  and  financial  reporting  systems,  financial  information  systems,  and  internal  and 
external auditing arrangements.  
19 
Fiduciary risks of the loan are related to the limited experience of DPWH and DOTr with 
27. 
implementation  of the technical  assistance  loan modality,  including  with financial  management 
arrangements under ADB-funded projects. DOF, which is tasked to coordinate and consolidate 
the preparation of the project financial statements, has limited capacity to do so and will require 
assistance for this task. Internal control within the implementing agencies needs to be improved 
as evidenced by several audit findings reflected in the recent Commission on Audit opinions on 
the implementing agencies’ entity financial statements and project financial statements for ADB-
financed and World Bank-financed projects involving accounting errors and deficiencies. These 
risks are considered manageable as the  Project will finance the engagement of four individual 
consultants, three of which will be based in the three PMU office, providing support to the PMU 
and line agencies in undertaking the Project, including assisting with the monitoring and reporting 
requirements  while  one  consultant  will  be  recruited  to  undertake  the  financial  monitoring  and 
reporting  requirements  for  the  TA  loan  at  the  executing  agency.  In  addition,  TA  9336  will 
strengthen the infrastructure preparation and innovation capacity of the implementing agencies 
to  enhance  project  readiness  and  effective  implementation  of  the  projects  prepared  under  the 
Project.  One output of the TA is that project management capacity of the implementing agencies 
will  be  improved.  ADB  will  engage  international  experts  for  project  management  (including 
procurement,  financial  management,  resettlement  and  safeguards)  to  review  and  asses  the 
existing project management procedures of DPWH and DOTr to advise and work hand in hand 
with the technical  staff. Project management manuals  and work flow  charts  will  be  developed, 
using international best practices. 
28. 
The Project’s implementation arrangement also poses the risk that since several national 
government agencies will be involved in the project, inadequate coordination among the agencies 
involved can significantly affect project implementation and reporting. To address this, a Steering 
Committee  will  be  created  to  be  chaired  by  an  Undersecretary  of  DOF  and  will  include 
Undersecretaries of the DPWH, DOTr and the NEDA as members. This will provide a venue for 
continuous  engagement  between  all  the  parties  involved  in  the  planning,  design  and 
implementation of the project. 
29. 
The assessment indicates that the overall pre-mitigation financial management risk of the 
project  is  moderate-high  but  with  several  risk  mitigation  measures  in  place,  the  implementing 
agencies’ financial management system is acceptable for the proposed project. The Project and 
the nature of project expenditures (i.e. no civil works and no major procurement of goods), the 
provision of consultant support to the executing agency and implementing agencies involved in 
the  Project,  and  the  provision  of  the  TA  to  the  implementing  agencies  prior  to  the  Project’s 
effectivity,  suggests that  DPWH  and  DOTr  can be  considered  as  capable of  implementing the 
Project, with the overall post-mitigation project financial management risk being assessed as low. 
A summary of the Financial Management and Internal Control Risk Assessment along with the 
Financial Management Action Plan is in the tables below.

Risk Assessment 
Without Mitigation 
Moderate 
2.  Entity-specific 
High 
Several national government 
agencies will be involved in the 
project. Inadequate coordination 
among the agencies involved can 
significantly affect project 
implementation and reporting. 
Overall Inherent Risk 
Moderate-High 
High 
Project Risk 
1. 
Implementing Entity 
Limited experience of DPWH and 
DOTr with implementation of the TA 
loan modality, including with financial 
management arrangements under 
ADB-funded projects.  DOF, which 
will coordinate and consolidate the 
preparation of the project financial 
statements, have limited capacity to 
do so and will require assistance for 
this task. 
2.  Funds Flow (DPWH and DOTr) 
High 
Limited experience with the TA loan 
modality possibly leading to 
inaccurate interpretation of ADB 
guidelines in disbursement and 
withdrawal of project funds. 
Mitigation Measures 
Continuation of PFM reforms by the Government of 
the Philippines through the following: (a) PFM Reform 
Roadmap; (b) Good Governance and Anti-Corruption 
Cluster Plan and (c) several stand-alone initiatives. 
A Steering Committee will be created to be chaired by 
an Undersecretary of DOF and will include 
Undersecretaries of the DPWH, DOTr and NEDA as 
members. This will provide a venue for continuous 
engagement between all the parties involved in the 
planning, design and implementation of the project. 
Four individual consultants will be recruited under the 
Project. Three of the consultants will be based in the 
three PMU office, providing support to the PMU and 
line agencies in undertaking the Project, including 
assisting with the monitoring and reporting 
requirements. One consultant will be recruited to 
undertake the financial monitoring and reporting 
requirements for the TA loan at the executing agency.  
In addition, ADB will provide training on ADB's 
disbursement guidelines and procedures to the 
relevant staff of the DPWH, DOTr and DOF. ADB 
processed a $5 million TA of which one output is to 
review and assess existing project management 
procedures (including financial management) of the 
implementing agencies and to develop project 
manuals prior to the effectiveness of the Project. 
The disbursements process will be limited to direct 
payments by the ADB to consultants. In addition, 
consultants will be based at the PMUs to provide 
guidance to the executing and implementing 
agencies.

and will be based at the PMUs. 
Risk Assessment 
With Mitigation 
Low 
ADB will provide training on ADB's disbursement 
guidelines and procedures to the relevant staff of the 
DPWH, DOTr and DOF. 
The Project will only finance consulting services (no 
civil works or major goods will be procured). ADB will 
inform DPWH and DOTr on ADB’s reporting 
requirements. A consultant will also be engaged to 
assist the PMUs in the financial monitoring and 
reporting function. 
Low 
(DPWH and DOTr) 
The expenditure categories under the 
chart of account are different from 
those used in ADB projects.  The 
accounting staff of the DPWH and the 
DOTr may not be able to prepare the 
project financial statements according 
to ADB’s expenditure categories 
unless formally notified and oriented 
on the need to do so.  
Internal Audit (DPWH and DOTr) 
The internal audit staff members are 
graduates of any bachelor's degree 
relevant to the job. They may not 
have formal training in internal audit. 
They may not do pre-audit of 
transactions, only post-audit. There is 
a possibility that irregularities and 
fraud may not be detected.

Mitigation Measures 
COA conducts its audits in accordance with 
Philippine Public Sector Standards on 
Auditing. In May 2016, COA issued Resolution 
No. 2016-007 adopting a revised framework of 
professional standards based on International 
Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions and 
which are in harmony with the International 
Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions 
framework of professional standards. COA 
has sufficient knowledge of ADB’s guidelines 
and procedures, including disbursements 
guidelines and procedures such as the ADB 
Loan Disbursement Handbook.  
The reporting requirements for the Project are 
straightforward and simple. It will only fund consulting 
services. The disbursements process will be limited to 
direct payments by the ADB to consultants. ADB will 
inform DPWH and the DOTr of the need to 
report/identify expenditures funded by the ADB loan in 
the APFS. A consultant will also assist the PMU and 
DOF in ensuring timely and proper submissions of the 
APFS.

Risk Description 
Thus, expenditures categories used 
are different from those indicated in 
the ADB loan agreement. 
Therefore, the expenditures funded 
by the ADB loan cannot be 
determined from the APFS as 
required by the ADB. 
DOTr 
7.4.  The COA issued qualified opinions 
on the fairness of the presentation 
of the consolidated financial 
statements of the DOTr for the 
years 2013, 2014 and 2015 due to 
accounting errors and deficiencies. 
The recurring issue is the errors in 
the balance of the property, plant

overstatement of P5.6 billion in 
2015. 
7.  Information Systems (DPWH

Mitigation Actions 
The creation of a Steering Committee will address the risk of poor 
coordination between the various government agencies involved in the 
project. The Steering Committee will encourage the agencies to work 
together in planning, designing and implementing the project. 
Given the limited experience of DPWH and DOTr in the implementation of 
the TA loan modality, including with financial management arrangements 
under ADB-funded projects and DOF having limited capacity to prepare 
consolidate project financial statements, four individual consultants will be 
recruited under the Project. Three of these individual consultants will be 
based in the three PMU office and act as the “owners” engineer, providing 
support to the PMU and line agencies in undertaking the Project, including 
assisting with the monitoring and reporting requirements. One individual 
consultant will be recruited to undertake the financial monitoring and 
reporting requirements for the TA loan. In addition, ADB will provide 
training on ADB's disbursement guidelines and procedures to the relevant 
staff of the DPWH, DOTr and DOF. 
The risks of accounting errors, reporting deficiencies and late submission 
of the APFS will be mitigated by the fact that the Project will only fund 
consulting services and that disbursements process will be limited to 
direct payments by the ADB to consultants. In addition, the Project will 
finance the engagement of consultants in the PMUs to provide guidance 
on ADB requirements and procedures to the relevant staff of the DPWH, 
DOTr and DOF. A $5 million TRTA will also be provided to determine 
capacity needs of the executing agency and/or implementing agencies 
prior to the TA loan effectiveness. 
Potential delays in the submission of the project financial statements will 
be addressed through the recruitment of consultants to assist DPWH and 
DOTR in making timely submissions of the APFS.

The  Project  will  have two  budget  users:  the  DPWH and  DOTr.  Each  budget  holder  will 
establish a PMU, which will be headed by an Under Secretary or Assistant Secretary or any other 
authorized official. In the case of DPWH, two PMUs will be established, each for road and water 
projects groups. The budget users will be responsible for managing the payment for all goods and 
consultant services procured under the Project. Cost estimates by budget user are in Table 13:

Direct payment procedure. The Project will use the direct payment procedure of ADB. 
The payments to the consultants will be made directly by ADB, based on the payment requests 
of  the  DPWH  and  DOTr  (in  the  form  of  withdrawal  applications  along  with  the  necessary 
supporting documents), and submitted through the DOF. The Government will cover some of the 
consulting  services  and  the  tax  share  of  the  consultant  contracts  through  payment  to  the 
consultants or through other allowed means in line with Philippine’s taxation framework. 
Before the submission of the first withdrawal application request, the borrower will submit 
33. 
to ADB sufficient evidence of the authority of the persons who will sign the withdrawal applications 
on behalf of the borrower, together with the authenticated specimen signatures of each authorized 
person.  The  minimum  value  per  withdrawal  application  is  set  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  Loan 
Disbursement Handbook. Individual payments below this amount will be paid by the implementing 
agencies  and  subsequently  claimed  to  ADB  through  reimbursement  of  any  such  advance 
payments. 
34. 
The PMUs will be responsible for preparing the annual contract awards and disbursement 
projections;  requesting  budgetary  allocations  for  counterpart  funds,  preparing  of  withdrawal 
applications,  and  sending  the  withdrawal  applications  to  ADB  through  DOF.  The  PMUs  are

37. 
The  DPWH  and  DOTr  will  maintain,  or  cause  to  be  maintained,  separate  books  and 
records by  funding  source  for  all  expenditures  incurred  on  the  project  following  accrual-based 
accounting  following  the  Philippine  Public  Sector  Accounting  Standards  (PPSAS).  The  DPWH 
and  DOTr  will  prepare  the  respective  project  financial  statements  in  accordance  with  PPSAS 
which are consistent with international accounting principles and practices. DOF will prepare the 
consolidated project financial statements for submission to ADB. 
D. 
Auditing and Public Disclosure 
38. 
The DOF will cause the detailed consolidated project financial statements to be audited in 
accordance with Philippine Public Sector Standards on Auditing13 by the Commission on Audit. 
The  auditor  will  also review  the  project  books  and  records  at  DPWH and  DOTr,  as  part  of the 
audit of the consolidated project financial statements. The audited consolidated project financial 
statements together with the auditor’s opinion will be presented in the English language within six 
months from the end of the fiscal year by the executing agency. 
39. 
The audit report for the project financial statements will include a management letter and 
auditor’s opinions which cover (i) whether the project financial statements present an accurate 
and fair view or are presented fairly, in all material respects, in accordance with the applicable 
financial reporting standards; (ii) whether the loan proceeds were used only for the purposes of 
the project or not; and (iii) whether the borrower or executing agency was in compliance with the 
financial covenants contained in the legal agreements (where applicable). 
40. 
Compliance with financial reporting and auditing requirements will be monitored by review 
missions  and  during  normal  project  supervision,  and  followed  up  regularly  with  all  concerned, 
including the external auditor.  
41. 
The Government, DOF, DPWH, and DOTr have been made aware of ADB’s approach to 
delayed submission, and the requirements for satisfactory and acceptable quality of the audited 
project  financial  statements.14  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  require  a  change  in  the  auditor  (in  a

13 Based on the International Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions. 
14 ADB Policy on delayed submission of audited project financial statements: When audited project financial statements 
(APFS) are not received by the due date, ADB will write to the executing agency advising that (i) the audit documents 
are  overdue;  and  (ii)  if  they  are  not  received  within  the  next  six  months,  requests  for  new  contract  awards  and 
disbursement such as new replenishment of imprest accounts, processing of new reimbursement, and issuance of 
new commitment letters will not be processed.

manner consistent with the constitution of the borrower), or for additional support to be provided 
to the auditor, if the audits required are not conducted in a manner satisfactory to ADB, or if the 
audits are substantially delayed. ADB reserves the right to verify the project's financial accounts 
to  confirm  that  the  share  of  ADB’s  financing  is  used  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  policies  and 
procedures. 
42. 
Public disclosure of the project financial statements, including the auditor’s opinion on the 
project financial statements, will be guided by ADB’s Public Communications Policy (2011).15 After 
review, ADB will disclose the audited project financial statements and the opinion of the auditors 
on  the  project  financial  statements  no  later  than  14  days  of  ADB’s  confirmation  of  their 
acceptability by posting them on ADB’s website. The management letter and additional auditor’s 
opinions will not be disclosed.16 
VI. 
PROCUREMENT AND CONSULTING SERVICES 
A. 
Advance Procurement 
43. 
All advance contracting will be undertaken in conformity with ADB’s Guidelines on the Use 
of Consultants (March 2013, as amended from time to time)17 and ADB’s Procurement Guidelines 
(April  2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).18This  will  allow  for  easier  access  to  international 
consultants as compared to using Government procurement. This will also facilitate both DOTr 
and  DPWH  to  access  required  specific  technologies,  international  expertise,  and  innovation, 
complementing and building on nationally available expertise.  
The  borrower  and  DPWH  and  DOTr  have  been  advised  that  approval  of  advance 
44. 
contracting  does  not  commit  ADB  to  finance  the  Project.  ADB  financing  is  subject  to  the 
government’s compliance of the relevant provisions of the loan agreement and ADB guidelines. 
The  Government  was  also  advised  that  ADB  would  not  finance  expenditures  incurred  by  the 
government prior to loan effectiveness, even if advance contracting is approved by ADB.  
45. 
The government requested ADB to undertake advance action for consultant selection on 
their behalf.19 The following steps for the recruitment of consultants can be concluded prior to loan 
effectiveness: (i) joint government-ADB workshop on procurement; (ii) pre-EOI conference with 
government, ADB, and prospective bidders; (iii) joint preparation of the terms of reference, cost 
estimates, and shortlisting evaluation criteria between government and ADB; (iv) advertisement 
for  expression  of  interests;  (v)  shortlisting  of  consulting  firms;  (vi)  issuance  of  the  request  for 
proposals; (vii) evaluation of technical proposals;(viii) evaluation of financial proposals and final 
ranking; and (ix) implementing agencies will negotiate and sign the contract with the first-ranked 
consultants for each of the three packages. 
(i)  When  the  AFPS  has  not  been  received  within  6  months  after  the  due  date,  ADB  will  withhold  processing  of 
requests for new contract awards and disbursement such as new replenishment of imprest accounts, processing 
of  new  reimbursement,  and  issuance  of  new  commitment  letters.  ADB  will  (i)  inform  the  executing  agency  of 
ADB’s actions; and (ii) advise that the loan may be suspended if the audit documents are not received within the 
next six months. 
(ii)  When the APFS has not been received within 12 months after the due date, ADB may suspend the loan.

proposals in close coordination with government agencies. Government will negotiate and sign 
the  contract  with  first-ranked  consultants  for  each  of  the  three  packages  promptly.  Since  the 
recruitment of consultants follows ADB’s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (March 2013, as 
amended from time to time) as specified in the loan agreement, the government agencies (DPWH 
and DOTr) will use the evaluation carried out by ADB as basis for contract negotiations and award. 
B. 
Procurement of Goods, Works and Consulting Services 
47. 
There  is  no  procurement  of  goods  and  works  under  the  Project;  procurement  of  office 
equipment  and  furniture  for  the  consultants  will  be  carried  out  by  the  consultants  under  their 
contract in accordance with ADB’s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time).  
48. 
All  consultants  will  be  recruited  according  to  ADB’s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of 
Consultants.[20] Consultants will be selected following quality-based selection with full technical 
proposals  to  ensure  highest  possible  standard  of  services.  Three  retainer  contracts  will  be 
awarded, one for each of output 1, 2 and 3.  Each contract will be awarded to one firm for the 
entire range of services for priority investments under its respective output. For each assignment, 
the  Consultant  will  be  required  to  prepare  a  technical  and  financial  proposition  that  will  be 
reviewed and agreed with the implementing agencies, possibly with the assistance of consultants 
under output 4, and approved by ADB. Upon approval of the proposition, the consultant will carry 
out the services at the agreed price under the retainer contract. 
The Client for the consultancy contracts will be the government through DPWH and DOTr. 
49. 
Payments to the consultants will be from the proceeds of the loan in accordance with the ADB 
loan disbursement handbook.21 
50. 
The overall risks associated with the procurement are rated as “low”. 
The Project’s overall procurement  classification  is  assessed  as  low  risk. The  integrated 
51. 
benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs.

category C as there will be no direct financing for infrastructure projects or any type of civil works. 
Therefore, there will be no resettlement impact arising from implementation of this Project funded 
project. 
C. 
Indigenous Peoples 
64. 
The indigenous peoples classification for the Project is confirmed as category C as there 
will be no impacts on indigenous people arising from implementation of this Project funded project. 
Indigenous peoples are not specifically targeted and the project neither affects the dignity, human 
rights, livelihood system or culture of indigenous peoples nor affects the territories or natural or 
cultural resources that indigenous peoples own, use, occupy, or claim as an ancestral domain or 
assets.

The consultants will also provide on-the-job training and transfer of knowledge to staff of 
DPWH and DOTr to ensure sustainability in the preparation and implementation of environmental 
and social safeguard assessment and mitigation measures in accordance with applicable laws, 
regulations, and procedures. The consultant will provide support and guidance to strengthen and 
enhance improvement of regulations or procedures for environmental and social safeguards, and 
strengthening safeguard units, task force, safeguards focal points for coordination and monitoring.  
E. 
Prohibited Investment 
Pursuant to ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement (2009),22 ADB funds may not be applied 
67. 
to the activities described on the ADB Prohibited Investment Activities List set forth at Appendix 
22 Available at: http://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/pub/2009/Safeguard-Policy-Statement-June2009.pdf

5 of the SPS. All financial institutions will ensure that their investments are in compliance with 
applicable national laws and regulations and will apply the prohibited investment activities list to 
subprojects financed by ADB. 
VIII.  GENDER AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS 
68. 
The Project supports preparation of public investment projects. Hence, there is no direct 
adverse impact on gender inequality or a negative impact on women. Nevertheless, the Project 
will ensure gender equality and impact on women will be suitably mainstreamed in the scope of 
work of consultants that will be engaged for preparation of infrastructure projects.  
69. 
The direct beneficiaries of the Project will be DPWH and DOTr staff (in terms of capacity 
building, institutional strengthening, and know-how transfer). Indirect beneficiaries of the Project 
will  be  communities  that  will  have  increased  access  to  markets  and  services  through  higher 
standard infrastructure investments to be implemented as a result of the Project. 
The  Project  will  ultimately  positively  affect  the  consumers,  employees,  and  the  poor  in

general, as they suffer the most from lack of economic infrastructure. Enterprises will benefit from 
better competitiveness due to better infrastructure and reduced logistics costs. Consumers will 
gain  from  greater  domestic  competition  because  it  will  lower  prices  and  improve  services. 
Employees will gain from easier access to work and increased income opportunities, including 
the  construction  and  operation  of  infrastructure  facilities  and  in  better-paid  jobs  such  as  in 
manufacturing.  The  poor,  especially  in  low-income  regions,  will  benefit  because  improved 
connectivity allows them to participate in wealthier urban markets. 
71. 
Overall, the Project is pro-poor as it will directly support the government to achieve the 
infrastructure  development  goals  reflected  through  pro-poor  preparation  as  well  as  timely  and 
adequate  delivery  of  public  infrastructure  to  the  beneficiaries.  Improved  infrastructure  will  help 
reduce the vulnerability of the poor or the likelihood that the near-poor will fall into poverty as a 
result of shocks, which remains an issue in the Philippines. 
72. 
The  labor  and  consumer  good  markets  will  be  among  the  most  important  channels:  (i) 
higher  basic  infrastructure  investments  will  directly  and  indirectly  create  more  decent  and 
productive jobs; and (ii) reduced logistics costs will lead to lower consumer prices and a better 
variety of products.  
Qualified social and environmental safeguards experts of the consultant firms will support 
73. 
the PMUs in supervision of the preparation of the projects. The PMUs will monitor and report to 
the relevant  executing  agency  on  all  social  and environmental  safeguards  activities.  Adequate 
analysis of the gender, labor, HIV/AIDs, and other social risks will be mainstreamed in the project 
preparation documents supported under the Project.23 The PMUs will be responsible to ensure 
that  relevant  sections  of  the  TORs  and  consultant  budgets  adequately  reflect  the  social  and 
gender aspects to be assesses and considered in project preparation. The PMUs will also ensure 
that project preparation consultants properly analyze and incorporate core labor standards and 
health and environmental conditions at worker camps in relevant project documents.

The project will—indirectly and with some lag—contribute to improving gender equity in 
74. 
the  Philippines  through  mainstreaming  of  gender  responsiveness  in  the  preparation  and 
implementation  of  public  investment  projects  in  accordance  with  the  country’s  legislation  and 
international best practice, including ADB gender guidelines.24 
75. 
Consultation and participation will be also mainstreamed in the TORs and budgets of the 
project  preparation  consultants  that  will  be  financed  under  the  Project.  When  and  where 
applicable,  the  consultation  and  participation  during  project  preparation  will  draw  on  ADB’s 
principles  on  consultation  and  participation.25  The  PMUs,  will  be  responsible  to  ensure  that 
relevant  sections  of  the  TORs  and  consultant  budgets  adequately  reflect  consultation  and 
participation activities during project preparation. 
The PMUs will be primarily responsible for monitoring of incorporation of gender, social 
76. 
and consultation and participation dimensions during implementation during project preparation 
by the Project-engaged consultants.

Monitoring 
77. 
Project  performance  monitoring.  The  PMUs  will  be  responsible  for  monitoring  and 
reporting on the performance of the Project against indicators and targets contained in the design 
and  monitoring  framework.  A  monitoring  and  evaluation  (M&E)  consultant  will  be  recruited  to 
support  the  PMUs  to  set  up  the  M&E  system  and  reporting  framework.  Progress  against  the 
participatory  planning,  monitoring,  and  evaluation  indicators  will  be  reported  quarterly,  and 
annually  by  DOF  to  ADB  as  part  of  the  overall  progress  reports  prepared  by  the  PMUs  with 
assistance from the consultants.26 
Compliance  monitoring. The  Project  will  be  reviewed  jointly  by  government  and ADB 
78. 
twice a year during ADB’s administration missions that will assess implementation progress and 
compliance  with  loan  agreement’s  covenants.  Compliance  will  be  also  monitored  through 
quarterly  progress  reports  submitted,  as  well  as  through  review  of  project  accounts  and 
procurement procedures.  
79. 
The  DPWH  and  DOTr  will  ensure  that  (i)  the  Project  funding  is  utilized  based  on 
procurement and financial management procedures agreed by the Government and ADB, and (ii) 
all viable Project-prepared projects are prioritized for inclusion in the DPWH and DOTr budget for 
the year in which the commencement of the civil works is expected to start. 
26 The  PMUs  will  submit  regular  monthly  progress  reports  to  their  respective  agency,  who  in  turn  will  report  to  the 
Steering Committee and DOF. DOF will consolidate and submit quarterly and annual reports  to ADB, reporting on 
the Project as a whole. 
37 
A midterm review will be carried out by the government and ADB during Q3 2019 to (i) 
80. 
evaluate  the  scope,  design,  and  implementation  arrangements  of  the  project;  (ii)  evaluate  the 
progress of the institutional development and capacity of the implementing agencies; (iii) identify 
changes  needed  in  any  of  the  areas  mentioned  above;  (iv)  assess  the  implementation 
performance against agreed project indicators and targets; (v) review and establish compliance 
with  the  loan  covenants;  and  (vi)  identify  critical  issues,  problems,  constraints,  and  need  for 
additional

finance,  and, 
C. 
Evaluation 
81.  Within 6 months of physical completion of the Project (Q2 2021), the executing agency 
will submit a project completion report to the ADB.27 The consultants will support the DPWH and 
DOTr in collecting the relevant data and drafting their project completion reports. 
D. 
Reporting 
82. 
The executing agency will provide ADB with (i) consolidated quarterly progress reports in 
a  format  consistent  with  ADB's  project  performance  reporting  system;  (ii)  consolidated  annual 
reports  including  (a)  progress  achieved  by  output  as  measured  through  the  indicator's 
performance targets, (b) key implementation issues and solutions; (c) updated procurement plan 
and (d) updated implementation plan for next 12 months; and (iii) a completion report within 6 
months of completion of project preparation work fora project. Project accounts together with the 
associated  auditor's  report,  should  be  adequately  reviewed.  The  template  for  the  quarterly 
progress report is in Appendix 3. 
E. 
Stakeholder Communication Strategy 
The  primary  objective  of  the  Stakeholder  Communication  Strategy  will  be  ensuring  the 
83. 
regular  and  proactive  sharing  of  information  with  key  stakeholders,  and  ensuring  coordinated 
information  sharing  between  the  steering  committee,  DPWH  and  DOTr.  Key  immediate 
stakeholders include DPWH and DOTr and the project preparation consultants. On a wider basis, 
stakeholders  will  also  include  development  partner  financiers,  consultants,  contractors  and 
suppliers  under  the  public  investment  projects,  civil  service  organizations  interested  in 
infrastructure development, as well as the public, who will benefit from infrastructure investments. 
Participation of stakeholders during project implementation will be facilitated through interaction 
during  administration  missions  and  Project-associated  events.  Given  the  Project’s  institutional 
and  project  preparation  support  focus,  no  direct  participation  by  the  infrastructure  project 
stakeholders, or end-users is envisaged. 
A designated communication focal point under the steering committee will be appointed 
84. 
to manage and respond to stakeholder inquiries, to ensure regular information sharing with other 
stakeholders,  to  ensure  two-way  information  flow  between  key  stakeholders,  and  to  ensure 
coordinated public dissemination of project progress and achievements. The PMUs of DPWH and 
DOTr  will  be  responsible  for  implementing  and  monitoring  information  dissemination  and 
disclosure in their respective areas, and both will also identify a communication focal point who 
will be designated for regular contact and information sharing with interested stakeholders, and 
with  the  steering  committee’s  communication  focal  point.  The  consultants’  support  will  include

providing  assistance  and  guidance  on  the  implementation  of  the  Stakeholder  Communication 
Strategy 
85. 
Delivering information. Information about the Project will be delivered through a public 
information booklet (PIB) that describes the project’s objectives, components, and activities. The 
consultants will provide the required inputs to the PIB. Written in English, the PIB, which will be 
updated annually, will make the project comprehensible to a wide range of stakeholder groups. 
In  addition  to  the  PIB,  a  Project  webpage  will  be  established  under  the  steering  committee’s 
communication  focal  point–within  6  months  after  loan  effectiveness–to  disclose  the  status  of 
Project  implementation, and proactively  share project  information  and  progress with interested 
stakeholders. Pursuant to ADB’s Public Communications Policy, all requisite project documents 
will be posted on the ADB website. 
86. 
Obtaining  Feedback.  The  PIB  will  indicate  where  stakeholders  can  get  in  touch  with 
Project implementers. Stakeholder meetings will ensure that accurate and sufficient feedback will 
be  received  from  stakeholder  groups.  Communication focal  points  will  respond to  and  register 
stakeholder inquiries. 
X. 
ANTICORRUPTION POLICY 
ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any violations of the 
87. 
Anticorruption  Policy  relating  to  the  Project.28  All  contracts  financed  by  ADB  shall  include 
provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the 
executing agency and all Project contractors, suppliers, consultants and other service providers. 
Individuals/entities  on  ADB’s  anticorruption  debarment  list  are  ineligible  to  participate  in  ADB-
financed activity and may not be awarded any contracts under the  Project.29 To support these 
efforts,  relevant  provisions  are  included  in  the  loan  agreement/regulations  and  the  bidding 
documents for the Project. 
88. 
The  ADB's  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and 
discussed with the  DOF,  NEDA,  DPWH,  and  DOTr.  ADB  will  require  the Borrower to  institute, 
maintain, and comply with internal procedures and controls following international best practice 
standards in preventing corruption or money laundering activities or the financing of terrorism and 
covenant with ADB to refrain from engaging in such activities. Consistent with its commitment to 
good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly 
or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to 
the Project. All contracts financed by ADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions 
specifying  the right  of  ADB  to  audit  and examine the  records  and  accounts  of  the  DPWH  and 
DOTr and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the 
Project. Any allegations of corruption can be reported to the PMUs, who will report these to the 
Project Steering Committee. 
The DPWH and DOTr will ensure that all its staff involved in the Project are fully aware of 
89. 
and  comply  with

XI. 
ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISM 
91. 
People  who  are,  or may  in the future  be,  adversely  affected  by the  project  may  submit 
complaints  to  ADB’s  Accountability  Mechanism.  The  Accountability  Mechanism  provides  an 
independent forum and process whereby people adversely affected by ADB-assisted projects can 
voice,  and  seek  a  resolution  of  their  problems,  as  well  as  report  alleged  violations  of  ADB’s 
operational  policies  and  procedures.  Before  submitting  a  complaint  to  the  Accountability 
Mechanism, affected people should make a good faith effort to solve their problems by working 
with  the  concerned  ADB  operations  department.  Only  after  doing  that,  and  if  they  are  still 
dissatisfied, should they approach the Accountability Mechanism.30 
XII. 
RECORD OF PAM CHANGES 
All  revisions/updates  during  course  of  implementation  should  retain  in  this  Section  to

Appendix 2 
OUTLINE TERMS OF REFERENCES FOR CONSULTING SERVICES 
A. 
Consulting Teams 
Three  consultant  teams  will  be  recruited  under  the  Project  to  support  the  project 
1. 
preparation  activities,  one  for  each  of  the  three  Project  outputs,  namely  project  preparation 
support for: (i) road and bridge, (ii) water, and (iii) transportation.  
The consultants will be recruited under advance action. The government has requested 
2. 
the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to undertake the recruitment of the consultants on their behalf 
and  to  use  the  ADB  recruitment  procedures  and  ADB’s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants 
(2013, as amended from time to time). The consultant recruitment will be undertaken between 
May and November 2017, with the contract to be signed upon effectiveness of the Project. The 
contract will be signed between the government and the consultant. 
3. 
The consultant teams will work directly with the PMUs for each of the outputs; two based 
in the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH, for road and bridges, and water) and 
one  in  the  Department  of  Transportation  (DOTr,  transportation).  DPWH  and  DOTr  will  assign 
relevant counterpart staff on a permanent basis as part of the project management unit (PMU) for 
project preparation. The PMU office and assignment of staff is a critical aspect of the capacity 
development and technology transfer; under the premise of learning by doing as part of the project 
preparation teams. 
4. 
Consultancy  services will  be  provided by  a firm or  a  consortium. The consultant  teams 
should have a mix of international and national experts. The experts will cover all required skills 
for project preparation. 
5. 
The consultant firms will undertake the following work: 
(i) 
(ii) 
Screen project pipeline for each of the three Project outputs. The screening will 
include an initial assessment of suitability to meet requirement, technical approach 
and option analysis, engineering innovation and buildability, cost estimates, benefit 
analysis  (preliminary  economic  internal  rate  of  return),  preliminary  safeguard 
requirement  review,  indicative  project  preparation  timeframe,  indicative  project 
implementation timeframe, budget allocation, and suitable financing sources. The 
screening work will be used to prioritize project pipelines and will be submitted to 
the  steering  committee  established  for  the  Project.  The  steering  committee  will 
review  the  work  and  decide  on  which  projects  will  be  taken  forward  for  further 
preparation activities. 
Feasibility  studies.  For  prioritized  projects  the  consultant  teams  will  support  the 
PMUs and line agencies in the project preparation activities. The feasibility work 
will  differ  for  those  projects  that  have  identified  official  development  assistance 
(ODA) finance and those to be, or already, prepared by the government. For ODA 
supported projects, the feasibility studies will be a due diligence review of project 
studies carried out by the potential financiers. For those projects to be financed by 
the  government  the  consultant  team  will  assist  the  government  in the  review  or 
preparation  of  full  feasibility  studies.  The  feasibility  studies  will  include  detailed 
assessment (or due diligence review) of all technical, economic, financial, legal, 
safeguard, and social aspects of the project. The feasibility study will also prepare 
a  timeframe for  project  implementation, financial  arrangements,  and  operational

studies will also ensure that all documents required for approval by government 
agencies, such as NEDA-Investment Coordination Committee, are prepared. 
Detailed  engineering  design.  Detailed  engineering  design  (DED)  will  be 
undertaken  once  the  prioritized  projects  have  completed  feasibility  studies  and 
received  approval  from government  and/or ODA financiers.  For ODA  supported 
projects,  the  DED  will  be  a  due  diligence  review  of  designs  carried  out  by  the 
potential  financiers.  For  those  projects  to  be  financed  by  the  government,  the 
consultant team will assist the government in the review or preparation of design 
work.  DED  work  incorporates  all  information  required to move projects from the 
preparation stage to the implementation. The work will include engineering design 
to a level that will allow specifications for civil works bidding, detailed assessment 
of  all  safeguard  requirements,  detailed  project  structure  including  financing 
arrangements, procurement plan and project implementation arrangements. 
The consultants will provide the PMU with tender assistance, which shall include 
tender  or  bid  management,  market  sounding  or  market  studies,  preparation  or 
revision of bid documents, and bid evaluation. 
Financial  arrangements.  The  consultant  team  will  assist  the  PMU  and  line 
agencies  with  all  necessary  requirements  for  finance  be  they  from  ODA  or 
government sources.  
Capacity Building for Safeguards Due Diligence. The consultants will provide on-
the-job training and transfer of knowledge to staff of DPWH and DOTr to ensure 
sustainability in the preparation and implementation of environmental and social 
safeguard  assessment  and  mitigation  measures  in  accordance  with  applicable 
laws, regulations, and procedures.  
B. 
Specialist Individual Consultants 
6. 
Four  main  individual  consultants  will  be  recruited  under  the  Project.  Three  of  these 
individual consultants will be based in the three PMU office and act as the “owners” engineer, 
providing  support  to the PMU  and line  agencies in undertaking the  Project,  including  assisting 
with  the  monitoring  and  reporting  requirements.  One  individual  consultant  will  be  recruited  to 
undertake the financial monitoring and reporting requirements for the Project. Other consultants 
will be identified to support the Project’s Output 4 objectives, which is the preparation of project 
management system.

Appendix 2 
TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR ROADS AND BRIDGES CONSULTANTS1 
A. 
Project Background 
The  Government  of  the  Philippines  (the  Government)  has  requested  the  Asian 
1. 
Development  Bank  (ADB)  assistance  for  a  technical  assistance  loan  (the  Project)  for 
Infrastructure  Preparation  and  Innovation  Facility  (IPIF).  The  Project  will  support  the  two  key 
agencies  responsible  for  national  public  infrastructure  investments,  namely  the  Department  of 
Public Works and Highways (DPWH) and the Department of Transportation (DOTr). Specifically, 
the Project will assist the two implementing agencies in (i) making sound and objective investment 
decisions; (ii) providing robust project pipelines; and (iii) helping fill the infrastructure gap of the 
country. The Project is estimated to cost $160 million; of which $100 million will be financed by 
ADB. The Government will finance $60 million to finance part of the consulting services as well 
as  taxes  and  duties  during  implementation.  The  major  expenditure  items,  representing 
approximately 87% of the total cost (including taxes and duties), will comprise consulting services 
to  support  the  Government  project  preparation  and  implementation  activities  for  public  sector 
investments.  
2. 
Status of the Infrastructure in the Philippines. Despite steady economic improvement, 
the quality of infrastructure of the Philippines continues to lag significantly behind other emerging 
Southeast Asian countries. In 2016–2017, the Philippines ranked 112th out of 138 countries in 
terms  of  quality  of  its  infrastructure.  Less  than  optimal  infrastructure  leads  to  higher  economic 
cost,  which  in  turn,  undermines  business  potential  and  economic  opportunities,  especially  in 
rapidly growing urban areas. 
3. 
The  poor  state  of  the  Philippines  infrastructure  is  attributed  to  a  number  of  factors 
including:  (i)  inadequate  infrastructure  investment;  (ii)  lack  of  inter-agency  coordination;  (iii) 
inadequate  or  incomplete  infrastructure  plans  and  implementation  programs;  (iv)  restricted 
access to international expertise and constrained technical and management know-how in project 
preparation  and  implementation;  and  (v)  reduced  sustainability  due  to  lack  of  resources  for 
operation  and  maintenance.  Complex  government  approval  process,  and  limited  and  difficult 
coordination  between  the  two  main  agencies  responsible for  infrastructure (DPWH  and  DOTr) 
and  other  key  agencies  also  impedes  project  preparation  and  implementation.  As  a  result, 
infrastructure projects are often not delivered as planned due to either poor project formulation or 
poor  project  implementation,  or  both.  Delays  in  safeguard compliance,  procurement,  and  land 
acquisition, as well as inadequate project management systems also contribute significantly to 
delays and higher cost of infrastructure projects. 
4. 
Rationale. Against this backdrop, the Project is expected to enable DPWH and DOTr to 
plan,  execute  and  implement  public  infrastructure  projects  more  efficiently  and  effectively  by 
addressing some of the key constraints to infrastructure planning, design, and implementation, 
and  by  providing  access  to  international  sources  of  innovation,  expertise,  advice,  and  best 
practices. The project will support both DPWH and DOTr to undertake project preparation work 
for  priority  infrastructure  projects  to  be  financed  by  official  development  assistance  (ODA)  or 
through the Government’s internal resources.  
5. 
The Government’s socioeconomic agenda aims to increase public infrastructure spending 
from 2.6% of gross domestic product in 2015 to 7% by 2022 representing approximately $14.5 
billion  annually.  Priority  infrastructure  investments  identified by  the government for  preparation 
1  The TOR may change up to the Request for Proposal stage. 
Appendix 2 
45 
under  the  Project  include  national  expressways,  inter-island  bridges,  flood  control  structures, 
airports, subways, urban transportation and railways. Recent large ODA programs of assistance 
have  been  pledged  from  the  governments  of  the  People’s  Republic  of  China,  Japan,  and  the 
Republic  of  Korea,  in  support  of  the  government  priority  investments  to  accelerate  public 
infrastructure  development  as  well  as  to  expand  its  public  private  partnership  (PPP)  project 
program. 
6. 
To more effectively use the pool of ODA and domestic funds pledged and budgeted, and 
to realize the goal of improving the efficiency of infrastructure pre-investment activities the Project 
will provide financing for consulting services to accelerate progress in infrastructure delivery for 
inclusive  and  sustainable  socioeconomic  development  through  improved  preparation  of  public 
infrastructure projects. The Project comprises four outputs: 
1. 
Output 1: Preparation of Roads and Bridges Projects

sustainability of knowledge transfer and to embed project management systems in NEDA, DPWH 
and DOTr. Additional expertise may also be recruited under Output 4 to review work carried out 
by  the  consultants  under  Outputs  1,  2,  and  3,  particularly  when  the  assignment  consists  or 
requires advanced technologies and expertise which are not currently available from within the 
client’s  organization.  Selection  of  consultants  for  Output  4  will  be  the  object  of  separate 
recruitment and is not covered by this TOR and RFP. 
B. 
Consulting Assignment 
The Government recognizes the need for consultants to be mobilized as soon as possible 
11. 
after  loan  effectiveness  and  to  expedite  the  recruitment  process  and  ensure  prompt 
implementation of the priority infrastructure investments.  For this reason, the government has 
requested  ADB  to  carry  out  the  consultant  selection  on  its  behalf  under  advance  action.  The 
government also wishes to ensure that world class consultants with experience and qualifications 
in advanced technologies be recruited to provide appropriate innovative technologies, and help 
build high quality climate resilience infrastructures more efficiently. In line with this objective, a 
consulting firm will be recruited for Output 1 with a contract valued at approximately US$47.54 
million (exclusive of taxes and contingencies).  
1. 
Implementation Arrangements 
DPWH  will  be  the  implementing  agency  responsible  for  Output  1  and  will  establish  a 
12. 
project management unit (PMU) within its Unified PMU (UPMU) to be responsible for the planning 
and preparation of roads and bridges projects and will oversee the outputs of the consultants.  
Appendix 2 
47 
13. 
The  recruitment  of  the  consulting  firm  (the  Consultant)  is  being  undertaken  by  ADB  in 
accordance with the ADB Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to 
time)  and  it  is  planned  that  the  contract  will  be  signed  with  DPWH  upon  effectiveness  of  the 
technical assistance loan expected on January 2018.  
14. 
The  Consultant  will  be  recruited  following  quality  based  selection  procedures  with  full 
technical proposal. The successful proposal will constitute the basis for a retainer contract to be 
signed between DPWH and the Consultant for the entirety of the works to be carried out under 
Output 1. Detailed TORs will be prepared by the PMU for each assignment under the contract 
and the Consultant will be requested to submit detailed technical and financial propositions for 
each  assignment.  The  propositions  including  proposed  approach  and  methodology,  work  plan 
and  technical  and  financial  information,  will  be  reviewed  by  the  implementing  agencies  and,  if 
satisfactory,  the  Consultant  will  be  requested  to  carry  out  the  assignment  at  an  agreed  price 
generally  on  a  lump  sum  basis.  This  process  has  been  chosen  to  ensure  expeditious 
implementation of the Project by reducing the number of consultants to be selected and therefore 
eliminating the repetitive and lengthy selection process for each assignment.   
2. 
Consulting Services 
The key objective of the consulting services is to assist the government in planning and 
15. 
preparation of public sector priority infrastructure investments. For each priority investment sub-
project  the  Consultant  may  be  required  to  carry  out  the  following  activities:  (i)  pre-feasibility 
studies (which may include preparation of master plans or other studies); (ii) feasibility studies; 
(iii) preliminary design studies and surveys; (iv) detailed engineering design; (v) preparation of 
bidding documents and assistance to the implementing agencies in the tendering process; and 
(vi)  preparation  of  consultant  selection  documents  and  assistance  in  the  recruitment  of 
construction supervision consultants. The Consultant may be required to carry out any or all of 
those activities for each sub-project, or in cases where some or all of the activities have been 
completed or partly completed by a third party, the Consultant may be required to perform a due 
diligence review for the activities that have been carried out to ensure that the outputs meet the 
highest technical standards as well as conformance to norms and regulations of the government 
and the financing institution including social and environmental safeguards. The exact scope of 
each  assignment  as  well  as  the  required  outputs  will  be  described  in  the  detailed  TORs  and 
request for proposition for each assignment.

including  a  Project  Management  Specialist/Team  Leader,  a  Senior  Highway  Engineer,  and  a 
Senior  Bridge  Engineer  which  will  be  constituted  preferably  with  permanent  employees  of  the 
consulting  firm  or  experts  working  exclusively  for  the  firm  or  JV  member,  with  significant 
experience with the firm in relevant field of activities. The team will be based at the implementing 
agencies  office  in  Manila  but  may  be  required  to  travel  to  project  sites  frequently.  Only  one 
curriculum vitae (CV) must be submitted for each key and non-key expert included in the proposal. 
Only the CVs of key experts will be scored as part of the technical evaluation of proposals. The 
CVs of non-key experts will not be scored, however ADB will review the individual CVs and may 
reject the CVs of non-key experts if the experience and qualification of the experts are considered 
inadequate or substandard. The overall composition of the Core Team, the credentials of non-
key experts, and the design of the team as a whole – including the appropriateness of the level 
of  inputs  (home,  field,  total)  –  will  be  taken  into  consideration  in  the  evaluation  of  Quality  of 
Approach and Work Plan and Personnel Schedule criteria. 
31. 
All positions under the contract, both key and non-key experts for the Core Team, must 
be  included  and  budgeted  for  in  the  financial  proposal  in  accordance  with  the  person-month 
allocation required for each as defined by the Consultant’s proposed approach and methodology 
and  work  plan.  The  budget  for  the  key  and  non-key  experts  to  be  appointed  for  individual 
assignments/sub-projects will be the object of separate propositions during implementation and 
will  be  paid  from  the  unallocated  fund  category  reserved  under  the  contract  for  those 
assignments/subprojects.  Likewise,  travel  costs  of  the  Core  Team  to  cover  expenses  of  travel 
between  the  implementing  agencies  headquarters  and  the  project  sites,  which  cannot  be 
determined  until  the  project  sites  are  selected,  will  be  allocated  from  unallocated  funds  during 
implementation. 
32. 
The proposal should also include a confirmation of availability of key experts listed in Table 
2  above  that  may  be  assigned  senior  positions  in  various  sub-project  assignments.  The 
qualifications and expertise of those key experts will be a key consideration in the evaluation of 
the qualification of the firm or JV. 
1. 
Key Experts (Core Team) 
33. 
The Consultant has full discretion over the composition and structure of the proposed core 
team of experts, and is responsible to provide all necessary expertise and qualifications to deliver 
Appendix 2 
53 
the  required  output  of  the  assignment.  However,  as  a  minimum  requirement,  the  team  must 
comprise  54  person  months  of  input  for  3  key  positions  including:  (i)  Project  Management 
Specialist/Team  Leader  (42  person-months);  (ii)  Senior  Highway  Engineer  (6  person-months); 
and  (iii)  Senior  Bridge  Engineer  (6  person-months)  (see  Table  3  below).  The  person-months 
indicated in the table below are strict minimum and the Consultant may propose longer inputs if it 
is deemed necessary to meet the objectives of the approach and methodology.

TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR WATER (FLOOD CONTROL) CONSULTANTS 
A. 
Project Background 
The Government of the Philippines (the Government) has requested Asian Development 
1. 
Bank (ADB) assistance for a technical assistance loan (the Project) for Infrastructure Preparation 
and  Innovation  Facility  (IPIF).  The  Project  will  support  the  two  key  agencies  responsible  for 
national public infrastructure investments, namely the Department of Public Works and Highways 
(DPWH)  and  Department  of  Transportation  (DOTr).  Specifically,  the  Project  will  assist  the  two 
implementing  agencies (implementing  agencies)  in  (i)  making  sound  and  objective  investment 
decisions; (ii) providing robust project pipelines; and (iii) helping fill the infrastructure gap of the 
country. The Project is estimated to cost $160 million; of which $100 million will be financed by 
ADB. The Government will finance $60 million to finance part of the consulting services as well 
as  taxes  and  duties  during  implementation.  The  major  expenditure  items,  representing 
approximately 87% of the total cost (including taxes and duties), will comprise consulting services 
to  support  the  Government  project  preparation  and  implementation  activities  for  public  sector 
investments.  
2. 
Status of the Infrastructure in the Philippines. Despite steady economic improvement, 
the quality of infrastructure of the Philippines continues to lag significantly behind other emerging 
Southeast Asian countries. In 2016–2017, the Philippines ranked 112th out of 138 countries in 
terms  of  quality  of  its  infrastructure.  Less  than  optimal  infrastructure  leads  to  higher  economic 
cost,  which  in  turn,  undermines  business  potential  and  economic  opportunities,  especially  in 
rapidly growing urban areas. 
3. 
The  poor  state  of  the  Philippines  infrastructure  is  attributed  to  a  number  of  factors 
including:  (i)  inadequate  infrastructure  investment;  (ii)  lack  of  inter-agency  coordination;  (iii) 
inadequate  or  incomplete  infrastructure  plans  and  implementation  programs;  (iv)  restricted 
access to international expertise and constrained technical and management know-how in project 
preparation  and  implementation;  and  (v)  reduced  sustainability  due  to  lack  of  resources  for 
operation  and  maintenance.  Complex  government  approval  process,  and  limited  and  difficult 
coordination  between  the  two  main  agencies  responsible for  infrastructure (DPWH  and  DOTr) 
and  other  key  agencies  also  impedes  project  preparation  and  implementation.  As  a  result, 
infrastructure projects are often not delivered as planned due to either poor project formulation or 
inadequate project implementation, or both. Delays in safeguard compliance, procurement, and 
land  acquisition,  as  well  as  poor  project  management  systems  also  contribute  significantly  to 
delays and higher cost of infrastructure projects. 
4. 
Rationale. Against this backdrop, the Project is expected to enable DPWH and DOTr to 
plan,  execute  and  implement  public  infrastructure  projects  more  efficiently  and  effectively  by 
addressing some of the key constraints to infrastructure planning,  design, and implementation, 
and  by  providing  access  to  international  sources  of  innovation,  expertise,  advice,  and  best 
practices. The project will support both DPWH and DOTr to undertake project preparation work 
for  priority  infrastructure  projects  to  be  financed  by  official  development  assistance  (ODA)  or 
through the Government’s internal resources.  
5. 
The Government’s socioeconomic agenda aims to increase public infrastructure spending 
from 2.6% of gross domestic product in 2015 to 7% by 2022 representing approximately $14.5 
billion  annually.  Priority  infrastructure  investments  identified by  the government for  preparation 
under  the  Project  include  national  expressways,  inter-island  bridges,  flood  control  structures, 
airports, subways, urban transportation and railways. Recent large ODA programs of assistance 
58 
Appendix 2 
have  been  pledged  from  the  governments  of  the  People’s  Republic  of  China,  Japan,  and  the 
Republic  of  Korea,  in  support  of  the  government  priority  investments  to  accelerate  public 
infrastructure  development  as  well  as  to  expand  its  public  private  partnership  (PPP)  project 
program. 
6. 
To more effectively use the pool of ODA and domestic funds pledged and budgeted, and 
to realize the goal of improving the efficiency of infrastructure pre-investment activities the Project 
will provide financing for consulting services to accelerate progress in infrastructure delivery for 
inclusive  and  sustainable  socioeconomic  development  through  improved  preparation  of  public 
infrastructure projects. The Project comprises four outputs:  
1. 
Output 1: Preparation of Roads and Bridges Projects 
7. 
Under this output, support will be provided to DPWH in planning and preparation of roads 
and bridges investment projects, including: (i) preparation of prefeasibility and feasibility studies, 
including economic and financial analysis; (ii) preparation of preliminary engineering studies; (iii) 
preparation  of  detailed  engineering  design;  (iv)  preparation  of  procurement  documents  and 
assistance in the tendering process; and v) preparation of social and environmental safeguard 
assessment studies. Selection of consultants for Output 1 is the object of a separate request for 
proposal (RFP). 
2. 
Output 2: Preparation of Water Projects 
8. 
Under this output, support will be provided to DPWH in planning and preparation for flood 
control  investment  projects  including  (i)  preparation  of  river  basin  master  plans  including 
identification of priority flood control and drainage improvement works; (ii) preparation of feasibility 
study, including economic and financial analysis; (iii) preparation of preliminary design studies; 
(iv)  preparation  of  detailed  engineering  design  of  priority  infrastructures;  (v)  preparation  of 
procurement documents and assistance in the tendering process; and (vi) preparation of social 
and environmental safeguard assessment studies. An indicative list of water investment projects 
to be the object of preparation under this output is provided in Table 2 below. While all projects in 
Table 2 are considered priority investments, the Government may substitute any or all of the listed 
project with other water or flood protection projects within or outside the initial regions. Additional 
details of each project are available through the ADB CMS. This Terms of Reference (TOR) and 
RFP are for the recruitment of consultants for Output 2 only.

preparation  of  documentation  and  manuals  for  project  preparation  activities  to  ensure 
sustainability of knowledge transfer and to embed project management systems in NEDA, DPWH 
and DOTr. Additional expertise may also be recruited under Output 4 to review work carried out 
by  the  Consultants  under  Outputs  1,  2  and  3,  particularly  when  the  assignment  consists  or 
requires advanced technologies and expertise which are not currently available from within the 
client’s  organization.  Selection  of  consultants  for  Output  4  will  be  the  object  of  separate 
recruitment and is not covered by this TOR and RFP. 
B. 
Consulting Assignment 
11. 
The Government recognizes the need for consultants to be mobilized as soon as possible 
after  loan  effectiveness  and  to  expedite  the  recruitment  process  and  ensure  prompt 
implementation of the priority infrastructure investments.  For this reason, the government has 
requested  ADB  to  carry  out  the  consultant  selection  on  its  behalf  under  advance  action.  The 
government also wishes to ensure that world class consultants with experience and qualifications 
in advanced technologies be recruited to provide appropriate innovative technologies, and help 
build high quality climate resilience infrastructures more efficiently. In line with this objective, a 
consulting firm will be recruited for Output 2 with a contract valued at approximately US$31.36 
million (exclusive of taxes and contingencies).  
1. 
Implementation Arrangements 
12. 
DPWH  thru  its  UPMO  Flood  Control  Management  Cluster  will  be  the  implementing 
agency  responsible  for  the  day-to-day  management  of  the  project  outputs  of  the  Consultant 
under Output 2.  
60 
Appendix 2 
The recruitment of the consulting firms (the Consultant) is being undertaken by ADB in 
13. 
accordance with the ADB Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to 
time)  and  it  is  planned  that  the  contract  will  be  signed  with  DPWH  upon  effectiveness  of  the 
technical assistance loan expected on January 2018.  
14. 
The  Consultant  will  be  recruited  following  Quality  Based  Selection  procedures  with  full 
technical proposal. The successful proposal will constitute the basis for a retainer contract to be 
signed between DPWH and the Consultant for the entirety of the works to be carried out under 
Output  2.  Detailed  TORs  will  be  prepared  by  the  DPWH  UPMO-Flood  Control  Management 
Cluster for each assignment under the contract and the Consultant will be requested to submit 
detailed  technical  and  financial  propositions  for  each  assignment.  The  propositions  including 
proposed approach and methodology, work plan and technical and financial information, will be 
reviewed by the implementing agencies and, if satisfactory, the Consultant will be requested to 
carry out the assignment at an agreed price generally on a lump sum basis. This process has 
been  chosen  to  ensure  expeditious  implementation  of  the  Project  by  reducing  the  number  of 
consultants to be selected and therefore eliminating the repetitive and lengthy selection process 
for each assignment. 
2. 
Consulting Services 
The key objective of the consulting services is to assist the government in planning and 
15. 
preparation of public sector priority infrastructure investments. For each priority investment sub-
project  the  Consultant  may  be  required  to  carry  out  the  following  activities:  (i)  pre-feasibility 
studies (which may include preparation of master plans or other studies); (ii) feasibility studies; 
(iii) preliminary design studies and surveys; (iv) detailed engineering design; (v) preparation of 
bidding documents and assistance to the implementing agencies in the tendering process; and 
vi)  preparation  of  consultant  selection  documents  and  assistance  in  the  recruitment  of 
construction supervision consultants. The Consultant may be required to carry out any or all of 
those activities for each sub-project, or in cases where some or all of the activities have been 
completed or partly completed by a third party, the Consultant may be required to perform a due 
diligence review for the activities that have been carried out to ensure that the outputs meet the 
highest technical standards as well as conformance to norms and regulations of the government 
and the financing institution including social and environmental safeguards. The exact scope of 
each  assignment  as  well  as  the  required  outputs  will  be  described  in  the  detailed  TORs  and 
request for proposition for each assignment. 
3. 
Outputs 
16. 
Under each assignment, the Consultants will be required to deliver specific outputs. The 
outputs will be described in the detailed TORs for each assignment and will depend on whether 
the Consultants will be required to carry out the activity or carry out due diligence review of the 
output of a third party. For each type of activity, the typical required outputs may be as follows: 
a. 
Pre-feasibility Study (Master Plan) 
17. 
The Consultant will prepare a master plan for flood control and drainage investments in 
the identified river basins.  In cases where the Master Plan has already been carried out by a third 
party, the Consultant will carry a due diligence review of  the master plan prepared by the third 
party. If the due diligence review reveals insufficient or inadequate analysis, the Consultant will 
be required to carry out additional studies and analysis and update/upgrade the master plan to 
meet  the  highest  standards  as  well  as  the  norms  and  regulations  of  the  Government  and  the 
Appendix 2 
61 
financing institution including social and environmental safeguards. The master plan will include 
but shall not be limited to: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Hydro-topographic survey (Master Plan level); 
Hydrologic and hydraulic analysis; 
Sediment transport analysis; 
Formulation of river improvement plan (sabo, coastal protection works and multi-
purpose dams, if necessary); 
Establishment of alternative structural measures 
Identification of key flood control and urban drainage infrastructures; 
Social gender analysis 
General Environmental Impact Assessment; 
Preliminary design concept of key flood control and urban drainage infrastructures; 
and 
Preliminary cost estimates of key flood control infrastructures. 
b. 
Feasibility Study 
18. 
The  Consultant  will  prepare  a  feasibility  study  report  for  flood  control  and  drainage 
investments in the identified river basins. In cases where the feasibility study has already been 
carried out by a third party, the Consultant will carry out a due diligence review of the feasibility 
study carried out by the third party. If the due diligence review reveals insufficient or inadequate 
analysis,  the  Consultants  will  be  required  to  carry  out  additional  studies  and  analysis  and 
update/upgrade  the  feasibility  study  to  meet  the  highest  standards  as  well  as  the  norms  and 
regulations of the Government  and the financing  institution  including  social  and environmental

These key experts will not necessarily be part of the core team (as defined under para. 
29)  but  will  be  expected to  lead or  be  responsible to  oversee the  work  of  sub-team  of  experts 
during the various assignments. During the assignments, it may be necessary for the Consultant 
to bring additional external expertise required with prior approval of the client. 
D. 
Proposal Preparation 
28. 
The  shortlisted  consulting  firms  are  requested  to  prepare  a  detailed  description  of  how 
they propose to deliver the outputs of the contract in the section of their proposal called “Approach 
and Methodology.” In this narrative, firms should clearly explain how they will achieve the outputs 
and  defined  deliverable,  and  include  detailed  information  on  key  and  non-key  experts  that  will 
comprise the core project team and their proposed input. The Consultant must also describe the 
experience of the firm or joint venture (JV), and core team key experts in the Philippines or similar 
geopolitical environment. 
29. 
Core team of experts. The Consultant must provide a minimum of 54 person months of 
key experts (Core Team) to be posted at the PMU for the duration of the contract. The Core Team, 
including  a  full-time  Project  Management  Specialist/Team  Leader,  a  Senior  Flood  Control 
Engineer,  and  Senior  Drainage  Engineer,  which  will  be  constituted  preferably  with  permanent 
employees of the consulting firm or JV or experts working exclusively for the firm or JV member, 
with significant experience with the firm in relevant field of activities. The team will be based at 
the implementing agencies office in Pasig, but may be required to travel to project sites frequently. 
Only one curriculum vitae (CV) must be submitted for each key and non-key expert included in 
the proposal. Only the CVs of key experts will be scored as part of the technical evaluation of 
proposals. The CVs of non-key experts will not be scored, however ADB will review the individual 
CVs and may reject the CVs of non-key experts if the experience and qualification of the experts 
are  considered  inadequate  or  substandard.  The  overall  composition  of  the  Core  Team,  the 
credentials  of  non-key  experts,  and  the  design  of  the  team  as  a  whole  –  including  the 
appropriateness of the level of inputs (home, field, total) – will be taken into consideration in the

Appendix 2

TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR TRANSPORTATION CONSULTANTS 
A. 
Project Background 
The Government of the Philippines (the Government) has requested Asian Development 
1. 
Bank (ADB) assistance for a technical assistance loan (the Project) for Infrastructure Preparation 
and  Innovation  Facility  (IPIF).  The  Project  will  support  the  two  key  agencies  responsible  for 
national public infrastructure investments, namely the Department of Public Works and Highways 
(DPWH)  and  Department  of  Transportation  (DOTr).  Specifically,  the  Project  will  assist  the  two 
implementing  agencies (implementing  agencies)  in  (i)  making  sound  and  objective  investment 
decisions; (ii) providing robust project pipelines; and (iii) helping fill the infrastructure gap of the 
country. The Project is estimated to cost $160 million, of which $100 million will be financed by 
ADB. The Government will finance $60 million to finance part of the consulting services as well 
as  taxes  and  duties  during  implementation.  The  major  expenditure  items,  representing 
approximately 87% of the total cost (including taxes and duties), will comprise consulting services 
to support the Government’s project preparation and implementation activities for public sector 
investments.  
2. 
Status of the Infrastructure in the Philippines. Despite steady economic improvement, 
the quality of infrastructure of the Philippines continues to lag significantly behind other emerging 
Southeast Asian countries. In 2016–2017, the Philippines ranked 112th out of 138 countries in 
terms  of  quality  of  its  infrastructure.  Less  than  optimal  infrastructure  leads  to  higher  economic 
cost,  which  in  turn,  undermines  business  potential  and  economic  opportunities,  especially  in 
rapidly growing urban areas. 
3. 
The  poor  state  of  the  Philippines  infrastructure  is  attributed  to  a  number  of  factors 
including:  (i)  inadequate  infrastructure  investment;  (ii)  lack  of  inter-agency  coordination;  (iii) 
inadequate  or  incomplete  infrastructure  plans  and  implementation  programs;  (iv)  restricted 
access to international expertise and constrained technical and management know-how in project 
preparation  and  implementation;  and  (v)  reduced  sustainability  due  to  lack  of  resources  for 
operation  and  maintenance.  Complex  government  approval  process,  and  limited  and  difficult 
coordination  between  the  two  main  agencies  responsible for  infrastructure (DPWH  and  DOTr) 
and  other  key  agencies  also  impedes  project  preparation  and  implementation.  As  a  result, 
infrastructure projects are often not delivered as planned due to either poor project formulation or 
inadequate project implementation, or both. Delays in safeguard compliance, procurement, and 
land  acquisition,  as  well  as  poor  project  management  systems  also  contribute  significantly  to 
delays and higher cost of infrastructure projects. 
4. 
Rationale. Against this backdrop, the Project is expected to enable DPWH and DOTr to 
plan,  execute  and  implement  public  infrastructure  projects  more  efficiently  and  effectively  by 
addressing some of the key constraints to infrastructure planning, design, and implementation, 
and by providing easier access to international sources of innovation, expertise, advice, and best 
practices. The project will support both DPWH and DOTr to undertake project preparation work 
for  priority  infrastructure  projects  to  be  financed  by  official  development  assistance  (ODA)  or 
through the Government’s internal resources.  
5. 
The Government’s socioeconomic agenda aims to increase public infrastructure spending 
from 2.6% of gross domestic product in 2015 to 7% by 2022 representing approximately $14.5 
billion annually. Priority infrastructure investments identified by the Government for preparation 
under  the  Project  include  national  expressways,  inter-island  bridges,  flood  control  structures, 
airports, subways, urban transportation and railways. Recent large ODA programs of assistance 
70 
Appendix 2 
have  been  pledged  from  the  governments  of  the  People’s  Republic  of  China,  Japan,  and  the 
Republic  of  Korea,  in  support  of  the  government  priority  investments  to  accelerate  public 
infrastructure  development  as  well  as  to  expand  its  public  private  partnership  (PPP)  project 
program. 
6. 
To more effectively use the pool of ODA and domestic funds pledged and budgeted, and 
to realize the goal of improving the efficiency of infrastructure pre-investment activities the Project 
will provide financing for consulting services to accelerate progress in infrastructure delivery for 
inclusive  and  sustainable  socioeconomic  development  through  improved  preparation  of  public 
infrastructure projects. The Project comprises four outputs:  
1. 
Output 1: Preparation of Roads and Bridges Projects:  
7. 
Under this output, support will be provided to DPWH in planning and preparation of roads 
and bridges investment projects, including: (i) preparation of pre-feasibility and feasibility studies, 
including economic and financial analysis; (ii) preparation of preliminary engineering studies; (iii) 
preparation  of  detailed  engineering  design;  (iv)  preparation  of  procurement  documents  and 
assistance in the tendering process; and v) preparation of social and environmental safeguard 
assessment studies. Selection of consultants for Output 1 is the object of a separate request for 
proposal (RFP). 
2. 
Output 2: Preparation of Water Projects:  
8. 
Under this output, support will be provided to DPWH in planning and preparation for flood 
control  investment  projects  including  (i)  preparation  of  river  basin  master  plans  including 
identification  of  priority  flood  control  structures;  (ii)  preparation  of  feasibility  study,  including 
economic and financial analysis; (iii) preparation of preliminary design studies; (iv) preparation of 
detailed engineering design of priority infrastructures; (v) preparation of procurement documents 
and assistance in the tendering process; and (vi) preparation of social and environmental safeguard 
assessment studies. Selection of consultants for Output 2 is the object of a separate RFP. 
3. 
Output 3: Preparation of Transportation Projects  
9. 
Under this output, support will be provided to DOTr in the planning and preparation of rail, 
public  transport,  and  port  and  airport  investment  projects,  including:  (i)  preparation  of  pre-
feasibility  and  feasibility  studies  including  economic  and  financial  analysis;  (ii)  preparation  of 
preliminary  design  studies;  (iii)  preparation  of  detailed  engineering  design;  (iii)  preparation  of 
procurement documents and assistance in the tendering process; and (iv) preparation of social 
and environmental safeguards assessment studies. The indicative list of transportation projects 
to  be  the  object  of  this  output  is  provided  in  Table  3  below.  While  all  projects  in  Table  3  are 
considered  priority  investments,  the  Government  may  substitute  any  or  all  of the  listed  project 
with other transportation projects within or outside the initial regions. Additional details of each 
project are available through the ADB CMS. This Terms of Reference (TOR) and RFP is for the 
recruitment of consultants for Output 3 only.

Output 4: Improvement of Project Development Management System  
10. 
Under this output, assistance will be provided to DPWH, DOTr and the National Economic 
Development Authority (NEDA) for development and implementation of project management and 
monitoring  systems.  The  Project  will  also  support  capacity  building  of  the  agencies  through 
preparation  of  documentation  and  manuals  for  project  preparation  activities  to  ensure 
sustainability of knowledge transfer and to embed project management systems in NEDA, DPWH 
and DOTr. Additional expertise may also be recruited under Output 4 to review work carried out 
by the consultants under Outputs 1, 2 and 3, particularly when the assignment consists or requires 
advanced  technologies  and  expertise  which  are  not  currently  available  within  the  client’s 
organization. Selection of consultants for Output 4 will be the object of separate recruitment and 
is not covered by this TOR and RFP.

B. 
Consulting Assignment 
11. 
The Government recognizes the need for consultants to be mobilized as soon as possible 
after  loan  effectiveness  and  to  expedite  the  recruitment  process  and  ensure  prompt 
implementation  of  the  priority  infrastructure  investments.  For  this  reason,  the  government  has 
requested  ADB  to  carry  out  the  consultant  selection  on  its  behalf  under  advance  action.  The 
government also wishes to ensure that world class consultants with experience and qualifications 
in advanced technologies be recruited to provide appropriate innovative technologies, and help 
build high quality climate resilience infrastructures more efficiently. In line with this objective, a 
consulting  firm  will  be  recruited  for  Output  3  with  a  contract  valued  at  approximately  US$35.5 
million (exclusive of taxes and contingencies).  
1. 
Implementation Arrangements 
12. 
DOTr  will  be  the  implementing  agency  for  Output  3  and  will  establish  a  Project 
Management Unit (PMU) to be responsible for planning, and preparation of infrastructure projects 
will oversee the outputs of their respective consultants.  
13. 
The  recruitment  of  the  consulting  firm  (the  Consultant)  is  being  undertaken  by  ADB  in 
accordance with the ADB Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to 
time)  and  it  is  planned  that  the  contract  will  be  signed  with  DOTr  upon  effectiveness  of  the 
technical assistance loan expected on January 2018.  
The  Consultant  will  be  recruited  following  Quality  Based  Selection  procedures  with  full 
14. 
technical proposal. The successful proposal will constitute the basis for a retainer contract to be 
signed between DOTr and the Consultant for the entirety of the works to be carried out under 
Output 3. Detailed TORs will be prepared by the PMU for each assignment under the contract 
and the Consultant will be requested to submit detailed technical and financial propositions for 
each  assignment.  The  propositions  including  proposed  approach  and  methodology,  work  plan 
and  technical  and  financial  information,  will  be  reviewed  by  the  implementing  agencies  and,  if 
satisfactory,  the  Consultant  will  be  requested  to  carry  out  the  assignment  at  an  agreed  price 
generally  on  a  lump  sum  basis.  This  process  has  been  chosen  to  ensure  expeditious 
implementation of the Project by reducing the number of consultants to be selected and therefore 
eliminating the repetitive and lengthy selection process for each assignment.   
2. 
Consulting Services 
15. 
The key objective of the consulting services is to assist the government in planning and 
preparation of public sector priority infrastructure investments. For each priority investment sub-
project  the  Consultant  may  be  required  to  carry  out  the  following  activities:  (i)  pre-feasibility 
studies (which may include preparation of master plans or other studies); (ii) feasibility studies; 
(iii) preliminary design studies and surveys; (iv) detailed engineering design; (v) preparation of 
bidding documents and assistance to the implementing agencies in the tendering process; and 
vi)  preparation  of  consultant  selection  documents  and  assistance  in  the  recruitment  of 
construction supervision consultants. The Consultant may be required to carry out any or all of 
those activities for each sub-project, or in cases where some or all of the activities have been 
completed or partly completed by a third party, the Consultant may be required to perform a due 
diligence review for the activities that have been carried out to ensure that the outputs meet the 
highest technical standards as well as conformance to norms and regulations of the government 
and the financing institution including social and environmental safeguards. The exact scope of 
Appendix 2

each  assignment  as  well  as  the  required  outputs  will  be  described  in  the  detailed  TORs  and 
request for proposition for each assignment. 
3. 
Outputs 
16. 
Under each assignment, the Consultant will be required to deliver specific outputs. These 
outputs will be listed and described in the detailed TORs for each assignment and will depend on 
whether the Consultant will be required to carry out the activity or carry out due diligence review 
of the  output  of  a third  party.  For  each type  of  activity,  the typical  required  outputs  may  be  as 
follows:

34. 
The key experts listed in Tables 2a to 2e above will not necessarily be part of the Core 
Team (as defined under par. 35) but will be expected to lead or be responsible to oversee the 
work of sub-team of experts during the various assignments. During the assignments, it may be 
necessary for the Consultant to bring additional external expertise required with prior approval of 
the client. 
D. 
Proposal Preparation 
35. 
The  shortlisted  consulting  firms  are  requested  to  prepare  a  detailed  description  of  how 
they propose to deliver the outputs of the contract in the section of their proposal called “Approach 
and Methodology.” In this narrative, firms should clearly explain how they will achieve the outputs 
and  defined  deliverable,  and  include  detailed  information  on  key  and  non-key  experts  that  will 
comprise the core project team and their proposed input. The Consultants must also describe the 
experience of the firm or joint venture (JV), and core team key experts in the Philippines or similar 
geopolitical environment. 
36. 
Core team of experts. The Consultant must provide a minimum of 42 person-months of 
key experts (Core Team) to be posted at the PMU for the duration of the contract. The core team, 
including a Project Management Specialist/Team Leader, which will be constituted preferably by 
permanent employees of the consulting firm or JV or experts working exclusively for the firm or 
JV  member,  the  team  will  be  based  at  the  implementing  agencies  office  in  Clark  but  may  be 
required to travel to project sites frequently. Only one curriculum vitae (CV) must be submitted for 
each key and non-key expert included in the proposal. Only the CVs of key experts will be scored 
as part of the technical evaluation of proposals. The CVs of non-key experts will not be scored, 
however  ADB  will  review  the  individual  CVs  and  may  reject  the  CVs  of  non-key  experts  if  the 
experience and qualification of the experts is considered inadequate or substandard. The overall 
composition of the Core Team, the credentials of non-key experts, and the design of the team as 
a whole – including the appropriateness of the level of inputs (home, field, total) – will be taken 
into  consideration  in  the  evaluation  of  Quality  of  Approach  and  Work  Plan  and  Personnel 
Schedule criteria. 
All positions under the contract, both key and non-key experts for the Core Team, must 
37. 
be  included  and  budgeted  for  in  the  financial  proposal  in  accordance  with  the  person-month 
allocation required for each as defined by the Consultant’s proposed approach and methodology 
and work plan. The budget for the key and non-key experts to be appointed for each individual 
sub-project  assignments  will  be  the  object  of  separate  propositions  during  implementation  and 
will be paid from the unallocated fund category reserved under the contract for those subproject 
assignments. Likewise, travel costs of the Core Team to cover expenses of travel between the 
Appendix 2 
85 
implementing agencies headquarters and the project sites, which cannot be determined until the 
project sites are selected, will be allocated from unallocated funds during implementation. 
38. 
The proposal should also include a confirmation of availability of key experts listed in Table 
2a to 2e above that may be assigned senior positions in various sub-project assignments. The 
qualifications and expertise of those key experts will be a key consideration in the evaluation of 
the qualification of the firm or JV. 
1. 
Key Experts (Core Team) 
39. 
The Consultant has full discretion over the composition and structure of the proposed core 
team of experts, and is responsible to provide all necessary expertise and qualifications to deliver 
the  required  output  of  the  assignment.  However,  as  a  minimum  requirement,  the  team  must 
comprise 42 person months of input for a project management specialist/team leader (See Table 
3 below). The person-months indicated in the table below are strict minimum and the Consultant 
may propose longer inputs if it is deemed necessary to meet the objectives of the approach and 
methodology.

including ADB or ODA financed projects 
40. 
Non-Key Experts. In addition to the mandatory key expert described in Table 3 above, 
the Consultant is expected to provide non-key experts for the Core Team to ensure all aspects of 
the work can be undertaken, and all deliverables and reports are completed, in accordance with 
the  implementation  schedule.  All  non-key  experts  must  have  adequate  qualifications  and 
experience in a relevant field with a minimum of 5 years of experience. 
41. 
In  addition,  the  Consultant  is  required  to  provide  technical  and  administrative  staff 
necessary for the Core Team to achieve its role and objectives. The proposal must provide a list 
of technical and administrative personnel to be provided. The Consultant is responsible to ensure 
that the technical and administrative personnel is sufficient to effectively carry out its functions. 
The cost of technical and administrative staff may be included in the financial proposal, but it is 
understood  that  if  additional  staff  is  required  during  implementation  of  the  contract  to meet  its 
objective and schedule, the cost of such additional staff will be borne by the Consultant and will 
not be compensated. 
42. 
The  project  list  in  Table  1  above  is  indicative.  While  all  projects  listed  are  considered 
priority  investments,  the  Government  may  substitute  any  of  the  listed  projects  with  other 
transportation projects within or outside the initial regions.  
2. 
Specific Tasks of the Project Management Specialist /Team Leader 
43. 
The Project Management Specialist/Team Leader will be responsible for: 
(i) 
overall liaison with the implementing agencies;  
86 
Appendix 2 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
(v) 
(vi) 
preparation of propositions for each individual assignment and negotiations with 
the implementing agencies;  
coordination of the input and output of the sub-teams of consultants (both in the 
field and home based) involved in the individual assignments; 
quality control of work carried out and output delivered by the sub-teams;  
overall management and administration of the contract; and  
reporting to the implementing agencies on progress of work being carried out by 
the Core Team and the sub-teams.  
44. 
The Project Management Specialist/Team Leader must have an advanced degree from a 
recognized institution in Engineering, Urban Planning, Transport or other relevant field, and have 
at  least  20  years  of  professional  experience  including  15  years  in  management  of  transport 
projects. Experience in the Philippines or similar geopolitical environment would be considered 
an asset. 
3. 
Services Provided by the Employer 
45. 
DOTr  will  assign  relevant  counterpart  staff  to  the  project  on  a  full-time  basis,  and  will 
provide office space, furniture, fixtures, and other assistance in Clark that may be required for the 
Core Team to carry out its duties and responsibilities for the successful completion of the Project. 
In  addition,  DOTr  shall  assist  in  obtaining  the  necessary  permits,  visas  and  other  documents 
necessary by the Consultant to carry out the services under contract. DOTr will facilitate field visits 
and arrange meetings with relevant authorities and agencies when necessary. In addition, DOTr 
shall coordinate with the respective authorities responsible for maintenance of peace and order 
at  project  locations  when  and  if  necessary  upon  request  of  the  Consultant.  Any  other  office 
requirements,  facilities  (equipment  and  consumables)  and  transport  requirements  should  be 
provided by the Consultant. The Government will pay, or cover through other allowed means in 
line  with the  Philippine’s  taxation framework,  the  applicable  Philippine  taxes and duties  on  the 
contract on behalf of the Consultant. Additional information regarding the tax law in the Philippines 
can be found at the Government of the Philippines website (https://www.bir.gov.ph/index.PhP/tax-
code.html).  
4. 
Equipment 
46. 
The proposal should identify the critical element of equipment that will be required by the 
Core  Team.  In  addition,  the  Consultant  will  be  requested  to  procure  equipment  to  assist  the 
implementing  agency  and  the  sub-project  teams  in  their  assignments.    The  equipment  and 
supplies  for  the  sub-project  teams  will  be  the  object  of  propositions  for  each  sub-project  and 
should  not  be  included  in  the  Core  Team  requirements.  All  equipment  and  assets  purchased 
under the Project and paid by the Project will adhere to ADB's Procurement Guidelines (2015, as 
amended from time to time), and upon completion of the Project, these assets will be turned over 
to the Government. The equipment may include but not limited to: 
- 
- 
- 
Geographic Information System Software and associated hardware; 
Railway Operations Simulation Software and associated hardware; and 
Transport Planning/Modelling Software and associated hardware. 
E. 
Request for Proposition 
47. 
As part of its proposal, the Consultant is required to prepare the first proposition for a sub-
project. The proposition should contain both technical and financial components. This will allow 
Appendix 2 
87 
for  early  mobilization,  not  only  of  the  Core  Team,  but  also  the  first  sub-project  team,  towards 
meeting the objective of expediting implementation of the Project.  The technical component shall 
include  the  detailed  approach  and  methodology  for  the  proposition,  CVs  of  key  and  non-key 
experts, as well as proposed work plan and personnel schedule for the sub-project.  The financial 
component shall include all costs associated with the sub-project. 
48. 
For each of the sub-projects where a Request for Proposition will be issued during contract 
implementation, the  Consultant  shall  include a minimum  of two and maximum  of three  CVs  of 
experts that may be deployed as team leader for the sub-project(s). 
F. 
Evaluation of Proposals 
The evaluation of proposals will follow the evaluation criteria provided in the RFP.  The 
49. 
approach and methodology will consider both how the Consultant envisages the use of the Core 
Team as well as the response to the proposition/sub-project included in this RFP.  Furthermore, 
in  the  evaluation  of  the  Quality  of  Methodology,  Work  Program  and  Personnel  Schedule, 
consideration will be given on whether the overall team composition (key and non-key experts) is 
appropriate to meet the TOR and how it matches the proposed methodology.  The extent by which 
proposed  key  and  non-key  experts  are  full  time  staff  of  the  Consultant  will  also  influence  the 
evaluation  of  the  Quality  of  Methodology,  Work  Program  and  Personnel  Schedule.  The 
qualification  of  the  firm  will,  in  addition  to  previous  experiences  on  similar  projects,  take  into 
consideration the CVs provided for potential team leader/s of subsequent sub-project/s.

OBJECTIVES 
The objectives of the audit of the project financial statements is to enable the auditor to (i) 
4. 
express  an  independent  and  objective  opinion  as  to  whether  the  project  financial  statements 
present fairly, in all material respects, or give a true and fair view of the project’s financial position, 
its financial performance and cash flows, and (ii) provide a reasonable assurance opinion over 
certain specific representations made in the Statement of Compliance (please refer to para. 10). 
IV. 
AUDITING STANDARDS 
The [statutory] audit is required to be conducted in accordance with [specify the relevant 
5. 
auditing standards]. These standards require that the auditor comply with ethical requirements 
and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the project financial 
Appendix 4 
91 
statements  are  free  from  material  misstatement.  An  audit  involves  performing  procedures  to 
obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the project financial statements. The 
procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of 
material misstatement of the project financial statements whether due to fraud or error. In making 
those  risk  assessments,  the  auditor  considers  the  internal  control  relevant  to  the  entity’s 
preparation and fair presentation of the project financial statements to design audit procedures 
that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not to expressing an opinion on the effectiveness 
of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting 
policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as 
evaluating the overall presentation of the project financial statements. 
The standards to be applied will be documented in the project/loan documents, and will 
6. 
include:  
Option A: Standards promulgated by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards 
Board: 
1. 
2. 
International Standards on Auditing (ISA); and 
International Standards on Assurance Engagements (ISAE). 
Option  B:  Standards  promulgated  by  the  International  Organization  of  Supreme  Audit 
Institutions: 
1. 
International Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions (ISSAI) 
Option C: National Auditing Standards: 
1. 
2. 
The auditing standards promulgated by {national authority}. 
In complying with ISA, the auditor will pay attention to the following standards: 
 
ISA  800/ISSAI  1800  –  Special  Considerations  –  Audits  of  Financial 
Statements Prepared in Accordance with Special Purpose Frameworks. 
ISA 240/ISSAI 1240 – The Auditor’s Responsibilities Relating to Fraud in
