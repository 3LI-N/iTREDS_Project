PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
A. 
Rationale 
Falling  groundwater  tables  as  a  result  of  over  extraction  of  groundwater  is  a  major 
1. 
concern  in  the  People’s  Republic  of  China  (PRC),  particularly  in  the  northern  parts  of  the 
country. The PRC heavily depends on extraction of groundwater, with an estimated 20% of its 
annual water supply coming from groundwater, reportedly ranging from 110 billion cubic meters 
(m3)  to  150  billion  m3  per  year.  The  largest  groundwater  user  is  the  agricultural  sector  (60%), 
with domestic and industrial usage sharing the remaining 40%. There are more than 100 large 
cones of groundwater depression with an estimated total area of 150,000 square kilometers in 
the PRC. In the North China Plain (NCP), the total area of the cone of groundwater depression 
already extends to 70,000 square kilometers. 
Weifang  and  Zibo  prefectures 
2. 
in  Shandong  Province  also  depend  heavily  on 
groundwater,  especially  for  its  intensive  and  high-value  agricultural  production.  Domestic  and 
industrial water use, although still less than agricultural water use, is also on the rise as a result 
of the rapid economic development in the area. The project area, covering Changle and Huantai 
counties,  and  Gaomi,  Qingzhou,  and  Shouguang  cities,  is  the  main  vegetable  producer  for 
Beijing and has a high concentration of greenhouses. The greenhouses that use drip irrigation 
require  fresh  and  sediment-free  water,  which,  in  most  cases,  is  provided  from  shallow 
groundwater  sources.  As  a  result  of  extensive  groundwater  abstraction,  the  project  area  has 
become the largest overexploited aquifer in Shandong Province, and the second largest in the 
PRC.1 In some downstream areas, agricultural production stopped due to lack of suitable water 
sources.  Some  of  the  industrial  or  domestic  water  users  that  are  still  using  groundwater  are 
encouraged by the government to switch to surface water.2 
3. 
Current  groundwater  recharge  of  both  shallow  and  deep  groundwater  resources  is 
insufficient  to  recover  from  the  excessive  pumping  during  the  dry  periods.  Seasonal  rainfall 
fluctuates  widely,  with  an  average  of  70%  of  the  rainfall  occurring  from  June  to  September, 
followed by drought during the rest of the year. Flooding occurs during the summer months, but 
storm waters flow to the sea unutilized. The pattern of irregular rainfall is expected to worsen as 
a result of climate change, and rainfall is predicted to decrease. Excessive groundwater usage 
also occurs because of lack of pricing of the resource, a weak licensing and permitting system, 
and insufficient abstraction metering and groundwater level monitoring. 
The  consequences  of  the  current  unsustainable  groundwater  utilization  are  serious:  (i) 
4. 
pumping costs have increased; (ii) groundwater quality is deteriorating due to seawater intrusion 
and  environmental  pollution;  (iii)  domestic  water  supplies  and  agricultural  (particularly 
vegetable) production are at risk; and (iv) the project area is suffering from significant financial 
and  economic  damages  caused  by  land  subsidence.  Seawater  intrusion  and  upconing  has 
extended  35  kilometers  inland  from  the  coast,  and  some  areas  have  already  experienced 
subsidence of more than 2 meters.3 The process of land subsidence is irreversible, and urgent 
action is needed to avoid worsening. 
1  The overexploited area of the Weifang–Zibo aquifer covers approximately 5,422 square kilometers. 
2  Usage  of  shallow  (unconfined)  groundwater  causes  overexploitation  of  groundwater  sources  that  are  used  by 
many farmers. The use of deep (confined) groundwater causes land subsidence. 
3  Process  by  which  saline  water  underlying  freshwater  in  an  aquifer  rises  upward  into  the  freshwater  zone  as  a 
result of pumping water from the freshwater zone. 
2 
Acknowledging  the  serious  concerns,  the  PRC  Government  selected  Shandong 
5. 
Province  as  a  demonstration  province  for  modernized  water  administration.  The  Shandong 
Provincial Government (SPG) has already taken multiple initiatives to address water scarcity in 
the  NCP,  including  promoting  water  productivity  and  reuse,  and  introducing  regulations  on 
groundwater  pumping.  Several  water-saving  technologies,  such  as  drip  irrigation,  are  already 
widely used in the project area.4 The results have been successful, but more efforts are needed 
to  fully  address  the  risk  of  further  decline  of  groundwater  levels  in  the  NCP.5 The  national 
government  has  constructed  the  South–North  Water  Transfer  Project,  which  started  providing 
additional  water for  Shandong  Province  in 2014.  The  diverted  water,  which is  mainly  intended 
for domestic and industrial use, will not be sufficient to mitigate the current overexploitations of 
the groundwater resources in the NCP. 
Lessons  learned  from  past  and  ongoing  support  for  the  water  sector,  including  the 
6. 
preparation  of  policy  recommendations  for  the  PRC’s  Thirteenth  Five-Year  Plan,  2016–2020, 
show  that  there  is  still  lack  of  good  examples  of  implementing  integrated  water  management 
approaches and increasing water productivity in the PRC. Most counties in the project area lack 
(i)  integration  of  good  international  practices  to  provide  new  alternatives  for  groundwater 
conservation, (ii) adequate implementation of water-saving strategies and regulatory stipulations, 
and  (iii)  introduction  of  up-to-date  water  environmental  monitoring  technologies.  Existing 
government  programs  also  lack  the  support  to  link  efficient  and  reduced  groundwater  usage 
with  the  retention  of  surface  and  storm  water  to  increase  groundwater  recharge  and  water 
availability for water-scarce areas. 
7. 
The project will be the first Asian Development Bank (ADB) supported major investment 
in the PRC that specifically focus on groundwater resources protection, recognizing the strategic 
importance  of  these  resources.  Moreover,  the  project  will  support  the  development  and 
introduction  of  economic  policy  instruments,  critical  to  controlling  groundwater  usage.  The 
project  will  contribute  to  the  PRC’s  Thirteenth  Five-Year  Plan,  2016–2020,  which  pursues 
regionally balanced and environmentally sustainable growth; and the PRC’s first National Plan 
to Protect the Safety of Groundwater Resources, 2011–2020.6 The project will support the PRC 
in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, in particular Goal 2: End hunger, achieve food 
security  and  improved  nutrition  and  promote  sustainable  agriculture  and  Goal  6:  Ensure 
availability  and  sustainable  management  of  water  and  sanitation  for  all.  The  project  is  in  line 
with  the  country  partnership  strategy,  2016–2020  for  the  PRC  of  ADB  in  supporting  the 
government’s  overarching  strategic  goal  by  focusing  on  environmentally  sustainable  growth.7 
The  project  will  contribute  to  ADB's  Water  Operational  Plan,  2011–2020  to  (i)  increase  water 
productivity  across  the  range  of  users;  (ii)  embed  integrated  water  resources  management, 
including  improved  risk  management,  to  mitigate  floods,  droughts,  and  other  water-related 
4 
In  Shouguang  City,  which  is  among  the  worst  affected  in  the  project  area,  two-thirds  of  the  farmers  reportedly 
apply drip irrigation already. 
5  The amount of groundwater usage in Shandong Province declined from 13.4 billion m3 in 2001 to 8.9 billion m3 in 
2012. 
6  On  10  October  2011,  the  PRC  Government  approved  the  National  Plan  to  Protect  the  Safety  of  Groundwater 
Resources, 2011–2020. The adoption of the plan is an important step to mobilize additional financial resources to 
protect  groundwater  resources  in  the  PRC.  On  16  April  2015,  the  government  also  announced  an  associated 
action plan that includes a list of measures to tackle water pollution, with the aim of improving the quality of the 
water environment around the country by 2030. With regards to groundwater, the plan envisages that by  2020, 
groundwater overdraft will be reduced and the aggravated pollution of groundwater will be preliminarily controlled.

disasters;  and  (iii)  expand  knowledge  and  capacity  development  that  uses  technology  and 
innovation more directly.8 
B. 
Impact and Outcome 
8. 
The  impact  will  be  a  sustained  groundwater  supply  for  the  agriculture  sector  in  the 
Weifang–Zibo  area.  The  outcome  will  be  improved  conservation  and  sustainable  use  of 
groundwater  resources  in  Weifang  and  Zibo  prefectures.  The  project  will  serve  as  a 
demonstration  of  different  integrated  approaches  for  environmental  restoration  and  improved 
management  of  overexploited  groundwater  areas.  The  project  will  promote  the  integration  of 
innovative  demonstration  activities  like  (i)  groundwater  recharge through  water  harvesting  and 
storage  in  smart  greenhouses;  (ii)  demonstration  of  comprehensive  water  management 
information systems; and (iii) capacity development in water resources management, including 
water resource policy and regulation, water pricing, and water markets. 
C. 
Outputs 
9. 
The  project  will  have  three  outputs:  (i)  groundwater  recharged  and  conserved,  (ii) 
surface  water  allocation  improved  and  monitored,  and  (iii)  capacity  development  for  water 
resources management enhanced. Demonstration activities will be implemented in Changle and 
Huantai counties, and Gaomi, Qingzhou, and Shouguang cities in Weifang and Zibo, which are 
representative  for  critical  water-scarce  conditions  in  intensive  agricultural  production  bases  in 
the Weifang–Zibo area. 
Output  1:  Groundwater  recharged  and  conserved.  Output  1  will  support  the 
10. 
introduction  of  groundwater  recharge  technologies  in  the  project  area  to  increase  shallow 
groundwater  recharge  and  reduce  usage  of  deep  groundwater.  Output  1  will  have  two 
components: (i) rehabilitation and construction of about 880 hectares of wetland areas, including 
canals,  which  will  contribute  to  the  recharge  of  shallow  groundwater  resources; 9  and  (ii) 
technological innovation for monitoring shallow groundwater recharge in Huantai County. Under 
component 1, two wetland areas will be rehabilitated in Huantai County and Shouguang City to 
improve  the  reservoir  and  ecological  functions  of  the  wetlands,  and  increase  shallow 
groundwater  recharge  through  the  canal  network.  These  wetland  areas  currently  suffer  from 
water  shortages  and  are  not  operational.  Component  2  includes  the  development  of  a 
comprehensive  management 
for  water  resources  monitoring  and 
management in Huantai County, including monitoring and dissemination of groundwater levels, 
quality, and abstraction. The management information system will be developed to complement 
an  existing  urban  water supply  management system. The  existing  system  will  be  expanded to 
include  monitoring  of  water  resources,  data  analysis,  optimizing  the  allocation  of  water 
resources, water regime forecasting, and decision-making support for flood control. 
information  system 
11. 
Output  2:  Surface  water  allocation  improved  and  monitored. Output 2 will improve 
water allocation and monitoring to increase water availability in water-scarce parts of the project 
area  and indirectly  reduce  the  pressure  on groundwater  resources. The output  will  have three 
components:  (i)  improvement  of  surface  water  allocation,  (ii)  retention  of  storm  water,  and  (iii) 
establishment of hydrological facilities in Changle County. Through the improvement of surface

water resources allocations, the exploitation of groundwater can be reduced. Component 1 will 
support  Gaomi  and  Qingzhou  cities  and  Huantai  County  to  rehabilitate  surface  water  flow 
systems and construct connections between the wide network of small rivers, canals, and small-
sized  reservoirs  that  exist  in  the  Weifang–Zibo  area.  The  connections  will  enable  the  local 
governments to supply areas with additional surface water resources to reduce the pressure on 
groundwater resources. Similarly, component 2 will support Changle County and Gaomi City to 
increase their reservoir capacity for improved storage of surface water. It is envisaged that the 
total  storage  capacity  of  the  Nanzhai  and  Juchenghe  reservoirs  will  be  increased  from  3.7 
million m3 per year to 8.3 million m3 per year. Output 3 will support Changle County to establish 
precipitation and flow monitoring capabilities in the Nanzhai Reservoir watershed.

Output  3:  Capacity  development  for  water  resources  management  enhanced. 
Output 3 will have two components: (i) institutional strengthening of ADB’s project management 
procedures  and  policy  development  support,  and  (ii)  project  management.  Component  1  will 
provide support for and training on groundwater policy and new approaches and techniques in 
water  management, 
the 
agriculture  sector  such  as  smart  greenhouses,  the  establishment  of  a  groundwater  trading 
system  through  pilot  water  user  associations,  and  an  integrated  circuit  card-controlled  water 
usage  system  to  be  developed  in  Huantai  County  for  monitoring  and  managing  groundwater 
demand  for  agricultural  and  rural  water  users.  Knowledge  products  will  be  prepared  to 
document  the  experiences  and  achievements.  Component  1  will  also  support  capacity 
development  and  training  of  staff  from  the  SPG  and  local  governments  in  ADB  project 
management procedures, technical design and implementation, and safeguard supervision and 
monitoring.  Component  2  will  provide  overall  project  implementation  support  for  staff  from  the 
SPG and cities and counties, including the implementation of land acquisition and resettlement.

COSTS AND FINANCING 
13. 
The  government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $150  million  from  ADB’s  ordinary  capital 
resources to finance the project. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 
years,  will  follow  the  straight-line  method,10 will  have  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in 
accordance  with  ADB’s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a 
commitment  charge  of  0.15%  per  year  on  undisbursed  funds  (the  interest  and  other  charges 
during construction will be capitalized), and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft 
loan  and  project  agreements.  The  average  maturity  is  15.25  years,  and the  maturity  premium 
payable to ADB is 0.10% per annum.

Cost Estimates Preparation and Revisions  
14. 
Preparation.  The  project  management  office  (PMO)  prepared  the  cost  estimates  in 
consultation  with  the  implementing  agencies  and  project  preparatory  technical  assistance 
(PPTA) consultants, and under the guidance of ADB project officer. The file entitled “Shandong 
Project-Financial and Economic Model V14” in MS Excel format was retained at the  PMO and 
by ADB project officer.  
Revisions. The PMO staff will revise the cost estimates when deemed necessary, under 
15. 
the guidance of ADB project officer during implementation based on  the government’s request 
for project cost reallocation and subsequent ADB’s approval.  
10  This is based on the loan terms and the government’s choice of repayment option and dates.

FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT 
A. 
Financial Management Assessment 
The  financial  management  assessment  (FMA)  was  conducted  in  January  2015  in 
17. 
accordance with ADB’s Guidelines for the Financial Management and Analysis of Projects and 
the Financial Due Diligence: a Methodology Note to assess the financial management capacity 
of  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies.  The  FMA  includes  fund  flow  arrangements, 
staffing,  accounting  policies  and  procedures,  internal  and  external  auditing  arrangements, 
reporting  and  monitoring,  and  financial  information  system.  The  FMA  concluded  that  the  pre-
mitigation  financial  management  risk  of  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies  is  “low”. 
Based  on  the  assessment,  the  key  financial  management  risks  identified  are  limited  to  the 
implementing  agencies and  include  a  lack  of  experience  of  ADB  project  management,  lack  of 
accounting  staff  for  review  procedure,  and  insufficient  internal  auditing.  Agreed  mitigation 
measures  include  to  (i)  conduct  training  on  ADB's  disbursement  procedures  and  project 
accounting requirements; and (ii) engage consultant services support to the PMO, implementing 
agencies,  and  other  project  agencies  on  project  management  and  supervision.  The  identified 
risks  in  financial  management  will  be  closely  monitored  during  project  implementation.  The 
overall  financial  management  risk  of  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies  with  the 
mitigation measures is considered is “low”.  
B. 
Disbursement 
1. 
Disbursement Arrangements for ADB 
The  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  Loan  Disbursement 
18. 
Handbook  (2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time),11 and  detailed  arrangements  agreed  upon 
between the government and ADB. Online training for project staff on disbursement policies and 
procedures  is  available  at  http://wpqr4.adb.org/disbursement_elearning.  Project  staffs  are 
encouraged to avail of this training to help ensure efficient disbursement and fiduciary control.  
19. 
To  facilitate  project  implementation  through  timely  release  of  loan  proceeds,  the  SPG, 
through  Shandong Finance Department (SFD) will  establish an  imprest  account  promptly  after 
loan effectiveness at a commercial bank acceptable to ADB.12 The SFD, who will establish the 
imprest account in its name, is accountable and responsible for proper use of advances made to 
the  imprest  account.  The  government  may  request  for  initial  and  additional  advances  to  the 
imprest account based on 6 months estimated expenditures to be financed through the imprest 
account. The imprest account will be established, managed, and liquidated in accordance with 
ADB’s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  detailed 
arrangements  agreed  by  the  government  and  ADB.  The  handbook  describes  which  (i) 
supporting  documents  should  be  submitted  to  ADB,  and  (ii)  should  be  retained  by  the 
government for liquidation and replenishment of an imprest account.  
20. 
The PMO will submit project level disbursement projections to ADB based on projections 
prepared  by  the  implementing  agencies.  The  implementing  agencies  will  be  responsible  for 
arranging counterpart financing or requesting budgetary allocations for counterpart funding, as 
appropriate.  The  implementing  agencies  will  prepare  disbursement  claims  and  collect 
11  Loan Disbursement Handbook: http://www.adb.org/Documents/loan-disbursement-handbook. 
12  The bank charges incurred in the operation of the imprest account may be financed from the loan proceeds. 
21 
supporting  documents,  which  will  then  be  passed  to  the  PMO  for  review  and  endorsement 
before  onward  transmission  to  their  prefecture  finance  bureaus.  Cities  and  counties  are 
responsible  for  initiating  payments  by  the  SFD  and  the  SFD  is  responsible  for  sending  loan 
withdrawal applications to ADB.  
21. 
The  minimum  value  per  withdrawal  application  is  $100,000  equivalent.  Individual 
payments  below  this  amount  should  be  paid  from  the  imprest  account  or  by  the  executing 
agency  and  subsequently  claimed  to  ADB  through  reimbursement,  unless  otherwise  accepted 
by ADB.  
22. 
The  statement  of  expenditure  (SOE)  procedure  may  be  used  for  reimbursement  of 
eligible  expenditures  or  liquidation  of  advances  to  the  imprest  account(s). 13  Supporting 
documents and records for the expenditures claimed under the SOE should be maintained and 
made  readily  available  for  review  by  ADB's  disbursement  and  review  missions,  upon  ADB's 
request  for  submission  of  supporting  documents  on  a  sampling  basis,  and  for  independent 
audit. Before the submission of the first withdrawal application, the  SPG, through SFD, should 
submit to ADB sufficient evidence of the authority of the person(s) who will sign the withdrawal 
applications, on behalf of the borrower, together with the authenticated specimen signatures of 
each authorized person.  
2. 
Disbursement Arrangements for Counterpart Fund 
23. 
The  SPG  will  ensure  that  (i)  all  local  and foreign  currency  counterpart  funds,  including 
cash advances, necessary for the smooth and successful completion of the project are provided 
in a timely manner; and (ii) additional funds, as and when needed, will be provided to meet any 
project shortfall or cost overruns. The SPG will also ensure that operation and maintenance of 
all project facilities is fully funded from the government budget.  
C. 
Accounting 
24. 
The  Shandong  Water  Resources  Department  (SWRD),  on  behalf  of  the  executing 
agency, will maintain, or cause to be maintained, separate books and records by funding source 
for  all  expenditures  incurred  on  the  project.  The  SWRD  will  prepare  consolidated  project 
financial statements annually following international accounting principles and practices or those 
prescribed by the government's accounting laws and regulations.  
D. 
Auditing and Public Disclosure 
25. 
The  SWRD,  on  behalf  of  the  executing  agency,  will  cause  the  detailed  consolidated 
project  financial  statements  to  be  audited  in  accordance  with  International  Standards  on 
Auditing and the Government Auditing Standards of the PRC (where these are consistent with 
International  Standards  on  Auditing),  by  an  auditor  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  audited  project 
financial statements will be submitted in English language to ADB within 6 months of the end of 
the fiscal year by the executing agency.  
26. 
The  annual  audit  report  for  the  project  financial  statements  will  include  a  management 
letter  and  auditor’s  opinions  which  cover  (i)  whether the  project financial statements  present  a 
13  The  relevant  forms  are  available  in  Appendix  9B  and  9C  of  ADB’s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2015,  as 
amended from time to time). 
22 
true  and  fair  view  or  are  presented  fairly,  in  all  material  respects,  in  accordance  with  the 
applicable financial reporting standards; (ii) whether the proceeds of the loan were used only for 
the purpose(s) of the project; (iii) whether the borrower or executing agency was in compliance 
with  the  financial  covenants  contained  in  the  legal  agreements  (where  applicable);  (iv)  use  of 
the imprest fund procedure; and (v) use of the SOE procedure certifying  the eligibility of those 
expenditures  claimed  under  SOE  procedure,  and  proper  use  of  the  SOE  and  imprest 
procedures in accordance with ADB’s  Loan Disbursement Handbook (2015, as amended from 
time to time), and project documents.  
27. 
Compliance  with  financial  reporting  and  auditing  requirements  will  be  monitored  by 
review  missions  and  during  normal  program  supervision,  and  followed  up  regularly  with  all 
concerned, including the external auditor.  
28. 
The government, SWRD, and the five implementing agencies have been made aware of 
ADB’s  approach  to  delayed  submission,  and  the  requirements  for  satisfactory  and  acceptable 
quality of the audited project financial statements.14 ADB reserves the right to require a change 
in  the  auditor  (in  a  manner  consistent  with  the  constitution  of  the  borrower),  or  for  additional 
support  to  be  provided  to  the  auditor,  if  the  audits  required  are  not  conducted  in  a  manner 
satisfactory  to ADB,  or  if  the  audits  are  substantially  delayed.  ADB  reserves the  right to verify 
the  project's  financial  accounts  to  confirm  that  the  share  of  ADB’s  financing  is  used  in 
accordance with ADB’s policies and procedures.  
29. 
Public  disclosure  of  the  audited  project  financial  statements,  including  the  auditor’s 
opinion  on  the  project  financial  statements,  will  be  guided  by  ADB’s  Public  Communications 
Policy (2011).15 After review, ADB will disclose the audited project financial statements and the 
opinion  of  the  auditors  on  the  project  financial  statements  no  later  than  30  days  of  ADB’s 
confirmation  of  their  acceptability  by  posting  them  on  ADB’s  website.  The  management  letter, 
additional auditor’s opinions, and audited entity financial statements will not be disclosed.16  
VI. 
PROCUREMENT AND CONSULTING SERVICES 
A. 
Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing 
30. 
To expedite project implementation, the government requested ADB to approve advance 
contracting  and  retroactive  financing  of  consultant  services  and  works  packages.  Use  of 
retroactive financing of eligible expenditures will be restricted to 20% of the loan amount. When 
14  ADB’s approach and procedures regarding delayed submission of audited project financial statements:  
  When  audited  project  financial  statements  are  not  received  by  the  due  date,  ADB  will  write  to  the  executing 
agency  advising  that  (i)  the  audit  documents  are  overdue;  and  (ii)  if  they  are  not  received  within  the  next  6 
months, requests for new contract awards and disbursements, such as new replenishment of imprest accounts, 
processing of new reimbursement, and issuance of new commitment letters will not be processed. 
  When audited project financial statements are not received within 6 months after the due date, ADB will withhold 
processing  of  requests  for  new  contract  awards  and  disbursements,  such  as  new  replenishment  of  imprest 
accounts,  processing  of  new  reimbursement,  and  issuance  of  new  commitment  letters.  ADB  will  (i)  inform  the 
executing agency of ADB’s actions, and (ii) advise that the loan may be suspended if the audit documents are 
not received within the next 6 months. 
  When  audited  project  financial  statements  are  not  received  within  12  months  after  the  due  date,  ADB  may 
suspend the loan.

Advance  contracting  will  include  (i)  tendering  and  bid  evaluation  for  civil  works 
31. 
packages, (ii) preparation of tendering documents for procurement of materials and equipment, 
and (iii) recruitment of consultants. The issuance of invitations to bid under advance contracting 
will be subject to ADB’s approval. According to the preliminary procurement plan, 10 civil works 
contracts, 1 equipment contract, and 3 individual consultant contracts will be procured through 
advance  contracting.  In  preparing  the  bidding  documents  under  the  advance  contracting 
arrangement,  the  SPG,  through  the  PMO,  must  ensure  that  the  provisions  of  all  loan 
assurances agreed at loan fact-finding (or as modified at loan negotiations) are incorporated in 
their  latest  form.  These  assurances  include  monitoring  and  reporting  requirements  placed  on 
contractors, compliance with labor laws and regulations, specific measures in the environmental 
management plan (EMP), and social and gender action plan (SGAP).  
B. 
Procurement of Goods, Works and Consulting Services

provincial  water  resources  studies,  including  for  the  Shandong  Science  and  Technology 
Department and Shandong Water Resources Department, which are relevant for the proposed 
project interventions. The WRRI is proposed to be engaged through SSS method because (i) it 
is considered to have unique knowledge of and access to ongoing discussions on national and 
provincial  water  policy  development,  amongst  others  through  its  previous  assignments  for  the 
Ministry  of  Water  Resources  and  SWRD;  (ii)  it  has  an  extensive  network  of  professional 
contacts  that  will  be  required  to  be  an  effective  stakeholder  to  discuss  and  promote  water 
related policy changes; and (iii) it has accumulated and possesses relevant water assessment 
data that is needed for this assignment. The WRRI is not affiliated with the SWRD.  
The detailed scope of consulting service on capacity development is summarized in the 
68. 
following:  
(i) 
(ii) 
Water  resources  policy  and  regulation.  Assist  the  executing  agency  and 
implementing  agencies  in  conducting  a  pilot  study  on  water  right  and  policy 
development  to  introduce  innovative  water  management  practices,  and  a  trial 
regional  market  for  water  right  trading  in  the  project  area.    The  pilot  study  is  to 
establish a most strict pilot water resources management system for implementation 
over  the  project  area.  The  scope  will  include  policy  studies  on  water  quota  setting, 
water  right  determination,  water  right  trading,  water  tariff  improvement,  water 
resources allocation, law enforcement, farming user association and administration, 
etc. with an emphasis on agricultural water uses and savings.  The policy research 
will  create  new  policies  for  the  comprehensive  improvement  to  the  area  and 
sustainable management of the water resources. 
Support and preparation of IC-card enabled demand management systems. An 
upgraded  IC  Card  system  will  be  developed  to  introduce  controlled  demand 
management  for  agricultural  water  management  in  a  selected  pilot  location  in 
Huantai  County.  The  IC  controlled  demand  system  will  consist  of  IC  card  operated 
wells, a data transmission system and a central data unit. The central data unit will 
be  integrated  with the  MIS systems that  will  be put  in place for the  Huantai  County 
and that  will  among others  have groundwater  level  recorders  that can measure the 
impact. The central data unit will also be used to analyze and discuss water uses by 
different farmers. The physical systems are complemented by a set of rules that deal 
with  registering  water  users,  determining  user  quota  and  tariff  for  the  use  of 
groundwater.  The  well  users  will  be  united  in  a  water  users  association,  which  will 
facilitate  the  introduction  and  co-manage  the  system  to  promote  water  trading  and 
improved water management among members. 
(iii) 
Innovative  greenhouse  roof  top  water  harvesting.  The  smart  greenhouse  pilot 
activity  will  introduce  water  harvesting  in green house  areas  in  Shouguang  County, 
as  a  future  strategy  to  secure  good  quality  water  for  the  horticultural  industry.  In 
water  harvesting  from  greenhouses  there  are  several  options  with  respect  to 
collection and  particular storage:  open surface  storage, closed surface storage and 
aquifer  storage.  The  Design  Institute  as  part  of  the  Feasibility  Report  prepared  a 
41 
preliminary design for water harvesting from greenhouses, based on closed surface 
storage.

(SPS)  (2009),  ADB  funds  may  not  be  applied  to  the  activities  described  on  ADB  Prohibited 
Investment Activities List set forth at Appendix 5 of the SPS.  
A. 
Environment 
1. 
Objectives 
The  project  is  classified  as  category  A  for  environment.  An  environmental  impact 
91. 
assessment  (EIA)  and  EMP  have  been  prepared  and  were  disclosed  on  ADB  website  on  9 
March 2015. The project EIA and EMP (not the domestic EIAs) form the basis of the official loan 
agreement  between  ADB  and  the  SPG.  The  SPG,  through  the  PMO,  holds  final  responsibility 
for implementation and compliance with the EMP. The EMP will be implemented in all phases of 
the project—design, pre-construction, construction, and operation. The EMP  complies with the 
PRC’s  environmental  laws  and  ADB’s  SPS  (2009).  The  EMP  contains:  (i)  objectives;  (ii)  roles 
and  responsibilities;  (iii)  mitigation  measures;  (iv)  inspection,  monitoring,  and  reporting 
arrangements;  (v)  training  and  institutional  strengthening;  (vi)  GRM;  (vii)  future  public 
consultation; and (viii) a feedback and adjustment mechanism.  
92. 
A  full  time  environmental  officer  has  been  assigned  in  the  PMO  to  coordinate  EMP 
implementation.  The  loan  implementation  environment  consultants  will  support  the  PMO  and 
contractors  to  implement  the  EMP.  In  the  design  stage,  the  PMO  will  pass  the  EMP  to  the 
design institutes for  incorporating  mitigation  measures  into  the  detailed  designs. The  EMP  will 
be updated at the end of the detailed design, as needed. To ensure that bidders will respond to 
the EMP’s provisions, the PMO and local project implementation offices (PIOs) will prepare and 
provide the following specification clauses for incorporation into the bidding documents: (i) a list 
of environmental management requirements to be budgeted by the bidders in their proposals; (ii) 
environmental clauses for contractual terms and conditions; and (iii) component domestic EIAs, 
and project EIA including updated EMP for compliance.  
93. 
Climate  change. A climate risk vulnerability assessment was conducted to identify the 
threat that  climate  change  presents  to  project  viability,  assuming  a  design  life  of  30–40  years. 
The  project  area  may  be  subject  to  increasing  frequency  and  duration  of  winter  drought, 
variability in precipitation, and flood severity in summer. Flood volumes and higher flows could 
exceed the  capacity  of embankments,  channels,  pipelines,  and  the  two project  pump stations. 
To  accommodate  these:  (i)  all  structures  will  be  constructed  to  a  flood  protection  standard  of 
one  in  20  years  or  one  in  50  years,  and  (ii)  embankments  will  be  designed  to  be  porous  for 
infiltration.  The  project  is  oriented  to  strengthen  resilience  to  climate  risks:  (i)  increased  storm 
water retention and improved water monitoring and allocation will strengthen water security, (ii) 
channel  rehabilitation  will  improve  water  flows  and  reduce  flood risk,  and  (iii)  training  in  water 
conservation  and  wetland  management  will  help  secure  the  freshwater  resources  of  two  large 
project wetlands.

Organizations and their Responsibilities for EMP Implementation 
94. 
The  SPG,  represented  by  the  SWRD,  is  the  executing  agency  of  the  project.  At  the 
provincial level, the SPG has established the comprehensive project management office (PMO) 
to provide policy guidance and coordinate overall project implementation. The PMO comprises 
representatives  from  the  SFD,  Shandong  Development  and  Reform  Commission,  SWRD,  and 
other relevant agencies. The five project city and county governments will be the implementing 
agencies. Each city and county has established a city or county PIO to implement their project 
components  and  subprojects.  The  EMP  implementation  arrangements  and  responsibilities  of 
governmental organizations are summarized below.

The project does not involve any distinct ethnic minority and thus does not trigger ADB’s 
SPS (2009) indigenous peoples requirements. Therefore, an ethnic minority development plan 
is not required.  
C. 
Land Acquisition and Resettlement 
1. 
Land Acquisition and Resettlement Impacts 
100.  There  are  five  project  components  that  have  involuntary  resettlement  impacts,  so 
resettlement plans have been prepared by county and city PIOs for each. The project will affect 
50 
a  total  of  five  villages  and/or  urban  communities,  and  two  townships  and/or  sub-districts  by 
permanent land acquisition in Changle County and Shouguang City, respectively. The Changle 
component  will  involve  both  permanent  land  acquisition  and  house  demolition,  while  the 
Shouguang  component will  involve  permanent  acquisition  of  collective land  without  contracted 
to  villagers  but  no  house  demolition.  The  Gaomi,  Huantai,  and  Qingzhou  components  will  be 
constructed  within  existing  river  channels,  and  involve  temporary  land  occupation  only,  but  no 
permanent land acquisition and house demolition. Detailed impacts are presented in Table 6.  
101.  The  total  area  of  permanent  land  acquisition  is  2,147.19  mu,  of  which  740.75  is  state-
owned  and  1,408  mu  is  collective-owned  land.  The  collective  land  included  farmland,  forestry 
land,  house  plot,  and  wetland  or  waste  land  accounting  for  38.8%,  18.1%,  4.5%,  and  38.6%, 
respectively.  About  9,422  mu  of  temporary  land  occupation  is  involved,  most  of  which  is 
collective land. The building demolition area is 47,781 m2, including residential houses of 44,924 
m2, and rural shanties of 2,857 m2. No houses on state-owned land will be demolished.  
102. 
It  is  estimated  that  a  total  of  1,697  persons  from  446  households  are  affected  by 
permanent land acquisition and resettlement, including 136 households (530 persons) affected 
by  land  acquisition  only,  191  households  (668  persons)  by  house  demolition  only,  and  119 
households  (499  persons)  by  both.  In  addition,  about  3,390  households  will  be  affected  by 
temporary land occupation.  
2. 
Resettlement Principles and Entitlements 
103.  The resettlement plans are prepared in compliance with the Land Administration Law of 
the PRC (2004), Decisions on Deepening Reform and Strengthening Land Administration by the 
State  Council  of  the  PRC  (GuoFa  [2004]  No.  28),  Notices  on  Formulation  of  Land  Acquisition 
Uniform Annual Yield Value Standard and Land Acquisition District Comprehensive Land Price 
by  Ministry  of  Land  and  Resources  (GuoTuZiFa  [2005]  No.144),  and  other  applicable 
guidelines.  They  are  also  based  on  local  policies  regarding  land  acquisition  and  resettlement 
(LAR)  in  Shandong  Province  and  the  project  cities  and/or  counties,  and  ADB’s  SPS  (2009). 
Based on consultations with the local governments and affected persons and general practices 
in  the  project  area,  the  implementing  agencies  have  adopted  a  set  of  resettlement  principles 
and an entitlement matrix has been prepared for each resettlement plan.

104.  Compensation  for  land  acquisition,  residential  housing,  and  non-residential  buildings 
(shops  and  enterprises)  are  paid  to  the  affected  owners  or  users.  For  land  acquisition, 
compensation  fees  include  land  compensation,  resettlement  subsidy,  and  compensation  for 
young  crops  and/or 
land  acquisition  compensation  rates  are  based  on 
comprehensive  district  prices of different  areas  in  Shandong  Province. The  compensation rate

component,  respectively.  Temporary  land  occupation  involved  in  the  five  project  cities  and/or 
counties will be taken for 1–1.5 years, and the compensation in CNY1,800/mu per year will be 
paid to affected peoples directly.

105.  For  affected  rural  households  suffering  house  demolition  of  the  Changle  component, 
both  an  apartment  in  new  resettlement  community  and  cash  compensation  can  be  provided. 
The  standards  for  housing  replacement  cost  of  main  houses  are  as  follows:  CNY750/m2  for 
brick-concrete  structure,  CNY600/m2  for  brick-wood  structure,  CNY200/m2  for  earth-wood 
structure, and CNY200/m2 for simple structure. A moving subsidy of CNY350 per person will be 
51 
paid  for.  The  Changle  County  Government  will  provide  unified  transition  housing  for  affected 
persons.  In  addition,  households  will  also  receive  compensation  at  replacement  costs  for  the 
loss  of  ground  attachment  and  utilities.  The  components  of  Gaomi,  Huantai,  Qingzhou,  and 
Shouguang will not involve house demolition.  
106.  A fund  of  CNY50,000  in  total  of  the components  is  set  up to  provide  assistance to the 
vulnerable  groups.  Every  relocated  household  that  lives  below  local  poverty  lines  will  get  the 
living  subsidy.  The  subsidy  will  be  delivered  as  following  procedures:  (i)  individual  application, 
(ii) community verification, and (iii) city and/or county PMO confirmation.  
3. 
Public Participation and Grievance 
107.  Public  consultation has been  the key for  the  preparation of the  five  resettlement  plans. 
From  July  2011  to  January  2015,  a  series  of  consultation  activities  were  carried  out  with  the 
affected  persons,  resettlement  communities,  institutions  and  enterprises,  and  other  project 
stakeholders.  The  physical  object  survey  on  land  and  building  asset  inventory,  and  socio-
economic  survey  of  sample  households,  enterprises,  and  institutions  have  performed.  The 
affected persons have participated in the preparation of the resettlement plans through the initial 
measurement  and  socio-economic  surveys,  and  community  meetings.  Their  concerns  and 
comments  have been  integrated  into  the  resettlement  plans.  Further  consultations  will  be  held 
during the implementation of the resettlement plans. 31 March 2015 is set as the cut-off date of 
existing  physical  status  in  the  affected  areas  for  all  five  components.  A  GRM  has  been 
established  for  the  affected  persons  to  redress  their  LAR  issues,  including  three  steps:  (i) 
townships resettlement offices, (ii) resettlement offices of subprojects of the project cities and/or 
counties, and (iii) Shandong PMO. The resettlement information booklets have been disclosed 
to the affected persons in local language (Chinese) and resettlement plans will be distributed to 
affected  households,  village  and/or  community  committees,  and  town  and/or  street  offices 
before the resettlement implementation. In addition, the resettlement plans will be uploaded on 
ADB  website  in  both  English  and  Chinese.  The  PMO  and  PIOs  will  be  assisted  by  a  national 
resettlement specialist (7 pm).  
4. 
Resettlement and Livelihood Rehabilitation 
108.  To minimize the resettlement impacts to affected persons and restore their income and 
living  standards,  detailed  programs  of  restoration  and  relocation  have  been  arranged  in  the 
resettlement plans. The affected persons can choose the available programs according to their 
requirements. Based on the socioeconomic survey and analysis of the affected households, and 
local  experiences  in  relocation  and  resettlement  of  similar  projects,  measures  for  resettlement 
and  income  restoration  have  been  prepared.  These  measures  include  unified  resettlement 
housing, distribution of temporary living expenses to the affected persons, employment creation 
by  the  local  labor  bureaus,  skill  training  for  the  affected  persons,  employment  related  to  the 
project, non-monetary support, etc.  
109.  About  11,407.86 mu  of collective  land  acquired will  be  compensated  in cash  based  on 
the type of land loss. About 9,398 mu of land will be occupied temporarily for channel dredging, 
dam rehabilitation, and facility pipe installation, for which there will be temporary income losses 
and  the  compensation  will  be  paid  in  cash.  In  terms  of  house  relocation  of  the  Changle 
component, 310 rural households will be provided unified apartment units in a new resettlement 
community  based  on  “get  same  construction  area  to  the  area  of  houses  to  be  demolished”. 
Local  governments  will  build  the  unified  resettlement  houses.  In  addition,  affected  households 
will be compensated by cash in standards of different housing structures. About 13 small stores 
52 
and/or  shops  operating  with  their  houses  will  suffer  demolition  impacts.  They  will  be 
compensated  for  their  lost  assets,  and  relocation  and  transitional  allowances  will  be  paid  to 
them.

VIII. 
GENDER AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS 
A. 
Social and Gender Action Plan 
1. 
Introduction 
113.  A social and gender action plan (SGAP) was prepared jointly by the Shandong Province 
PMO; and participating local governments of Changle and Huantai counties, Gaomi, Qingzhou, 
and Shouguang cities, with the assistance of the PPTA social experts.  
2. 
Purpose 
114.  The purpose of the SGAP is to ensure that important social, poverty, and gender issues 
are addressed during project implementation to enhance project benefits and mitigate any likely 
negative  impacts.  Any  adverse  impacts  need  to  be  avoided  or  mitigated,  and  project  benefits 
should  be  inclusive  of  vulnerable  groups  (e.g.,  poor,  women,  and  others).  The  SGAP 
emphasizes social inclusion and equitable access to project benefits.  
3. 
Basis for the Social and Gender Action Plan 
115.  The SGAP has focused on issues related to directly affected people, vulnerable people, 
gender, and local social and agricultural development. Measures to address these issues have 
been  formulated  based  on  the  poverty  and  social  assessment  report  and  adopted  based  on 
extensive  stakeholder  consultation.  The  main  actions  can  be  grouped  into  three  types:  (i)  for 
structure components in outputs 1 and 2, the project benefits enhancement measures such as 
employment promotion and social risks mitigation measures such as pro-poor activities will be 
within  the  direct  control  of  the  implementing  agencies;  (ii)  for  non-structure  components  in 
outputs  1  and  2,  public  awareness  activities  and  campaigns  on  water  saving  technology, 
irrigation water quota, water rights trading, ascending water pricing, etc. will be organized in the 
subproject  areas  each  year,  being  the  responsibility  of  the  Shandong  Province  PMO  and 
country PIOs.21 In the case of Huantai subproject, public hearings on water quota, water rights 
trading, and ascending water pricing will be arranged in case of any changes in water price; and 
(iii)  for  two  capacity  development  components  in  output  3,  training,  meetings,  consultations, 
case  studies,  workshops  and  seminars  on  decision  making,  ADB  project  management 
procedures, technical design and implementation, public awareness, and consultation capacity 
enhancement will be arranged by the Shandong Province PMO and exchange opportunities for 
the five subproject counties/cities to learn local good practices from each other will be provided. 
Examples of good practices may include but are not limited to precise agriculture, sophisticated 
greenhouse  cultivation,  agricultural  water  saving  technologies,  rain  water  and  dew  water 
collection,  groundwater  and  surface  water  monitoring,  farmers’  training  experiment  base,  and 
farmers’  water  user  association.  Table  9  presents  the  SGAP,  including  the  proposed  actions, 
target groups, implementing agencies, timing, funding source, and monitoring indicators.  
21  For example, local school’s regular classes and activities on water saving, water resource protection, and pollution 
control  will  continue  to  play  a  fundamental  role  in  youth  education  and  students  are  invited  to  involve  in  the 
promotion of the project’s new concepts. 
55 
4. 
Gender Aspects 
116.  The  project  is  classified  by  ADB  as  “some  gender  elements”.  The  Shandong  Province 
PMO and the participating local governments have agreed to take following actions to enhance 
project benefits for women: (i) contractors hire women for project implementation with a target of 
30% of newly created civil work positions; (ii) hire women for facilities’ operation with a target of 
30%  of  newly  created  positions  in  reservoirs,  river  courses,  open  canals,  etc.;  (iii)  conduct 
workshops  and  seminars  on  capacity  development  and  public  awareness  enhancement  and 
rotation show cases by the five subprojects with a target of 30% of female participants; and (iv) 
hold public hearings for irrigation water quota, ascending pricing, and trading with a target of 40% 
of female residents of the Huantai component.  
117.  The gender actions stress inclusion of all the society through:  
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
Public  participation  and  awareness  enhancement.  During  the  four-year  project 
implementation  phase,  campaigns  each  year  on  agricultural  water  saving 
technology  application;  and  promotion  of  agricultural  water  quota,  water  right 
trade,  and  ascending  water  pricing  will  require  participation  by  women  all  over 
the  project  area.  Local  school’s  regular  classes  and  activities  on  water  saving, 
water  resource  protection,  and  pollution  control  will  continue  to  play  a 
fundamental  role  in  education,  and  school  girls  are  invited  to  involve  in  the 
promotion of the project’s new concepts. In the case of Huantai, public hearings 
on  water  quota,  water  right  trade,  and  ascending  water  pricing  will  require 
participation by 40% female representatives. Results will be regularly reported on 
the project performance monitoring system. 
Employment  enhancement.  Employment  enhancement  measures  will  include 
consultation  and  participation  of  women  during  project  design  and 
implementation,  and  preferential  employment  of  women  as  unskilled  laborers 
during and after project implementation. The employment plan includes a target 
of 30% for women in civil work during project implementation and in operation of 
reservoirs, river coarse and open canals, etc. 
Capacity  development.  Measures  will  include  training,  meetings,  consultations, 
case  studies,  and  workshops  on  topics  including  decision  making,  project 
management,  safeguard  supervision  and  monitoring,  implementation  of  land 
acquisition  and  resettlement,  public  awareness,  and  consultation  on  capability 
enhancement. The training plan for capacity development has a target of 30% for 
women’s  participation. The  project  will  also  organize  subproject  cities  and/or 
counties to learn good practices from each other with a target of 30% for female 
participants. 
5. 
Poverty Reduction Aspects 
118.  The  Shandong  Province  PMO  and  county  and city  PIOs  have agreed  to  take following 
actions to enhance project benefits for the poor: (i) coordinating with contractors and local street 
offices or the affected villages to hire laborers from poverty villagers and/or households with a 
target of 15% of newly created positions for project construction; (ii) hiring laborers from poverty 
villagers/households  with  a  target  of  15%  of  newly  created  positions  for  project  operation;  (iii) 
public hearings for irrigation water quota, ascending pricing and trading with a target of 15% of 
representatives  from  low-income  households;  (iv)  supporting  local  governments  in  technical 
56 
training  programs  or  providing  training  for  new  workers  before  taking  positions;  and  (v) 
promoting non-farm employment opportunities.  
6. 
Implementation Arrangements 
119.  The  SGAP  will  be  implemented  by  the  county  and  city  PIOs  of  the  five  subprojects  in 
coordination with local governments as indicated in Table 9. Each PIO will appoint at least one 
staff to manage the SGAP implementation. The Shandong Province PMO will be responsible for 
overseeing  the  PIOs  implementing  those  actions  within  their  direct  control,  as  well  as 
supervision of related activities that involve the construction contractors. For actions outside the 
direct mandates of the PMO and PIOs, the assigned staff will be responsible to liaise with the 
relevant  local  government  agencies,  township  governments,  or  village  committees.  This  will 
ensure that appropriate measures are taken in a timely and satisfactory manner. The SPMO will 
also  be  responsible for monitoring  and  reporting  progress,  issues,  and  results.  The  Shandong 
Province  PMO  will  provide  ADB  with  SGAP  monitoring  reports  for  review  semiannually  and 
follow-up  during  loan  supervision  missions.  If  necessary,  ADB  and  the  executing  agency  may 
agree to revise the SGAP to improve the effectiveness of the proposed measures.  
7. 
Funding Sources 
120.  There are no specific funding sources for the SGAP other than: (i) the project cost (e.g., 
civil  works,  environmental  management  plan,  or  resettlement  plan  costs);  (ii)  support  from  the 
project implementation consultants; and (iii) local government funding for poverty reduction, etc. 
In this manner, some activities in the SGAP will be part of the project implementation and others 
will  be  integrated  with  ongoing  government  programs.  The  Shandong  Province  PMO  will 
monitor implementation to ensure that sufficient funding is made available in a timely manner.

Monitoring 
1. 
Project performance monitoring 
123.  Project performance monitoring. To monitor project progress in achieving the planned 
outcome  and  outputs,  the  PMO  will  establish  and  maintain  PPMS,  which  will  be  designed  to 
permit  adequate  flexibility  to  adopt  remedial  action  regarding  project  design,  schedules, 
activities,  and  development  impacts.  The  PPMS  will  adopt  agreed  indicators  relating  to  the 
following  aspects  of  the  project:  (i)  project  physical  and financial  progress,  (ii)  improvement  in 
groundwater level and groundwater conservation, (iii) improvement in surface water allocation, 
(iv) safeguard compliance and SGAP implementation, and (v) results of project implementation 
support through training and management.  
124.  At the beginning of project implementation, the PMO will develop comprehensive PPMS 
procedures  to  systematically  generate  data  in  the  above  areas  in  consultation  with  the 
implementing  agency,  and  with  the  assistance  of  consultants.  The  PMO  will  refine  the  PPMS 
framework,  confirm  achievable  targets,  monitoring  and  recording  arrangements,  and  establish 
relevant systems and procedures not later than 6 months after loan effectiveness. The PMO will 
assign  staff,  or  contract consultants to  collect  baseline  and  progress  data at  the requisite  time 
intervals,  including  annual  reporting.  The  PMO  will  be  responsible  for  analyzing  and 
consolidating  reported  data  through  its  management  information  system,  and  reporting 
outcomes to ADB through semiannual progress reports.  
125.  Compliance monitoring. During project implementation, ADB and the PMO will closely 
monitor the compliance of all the covenants under the project and will take necessary remedial 
actions for any noncompliance. The compliance status will be reported in the quarterly progress 
report by the PMO and will be reviewed during project review missions.  
2. 
Safeguards monitoring  
a) 
Environment 
126.  The  project  monitoring  program  focuses  on  the  environment  in  the  project  areas  of 
influence  in  the  five  project  cities/counties.  A  detailed  environmental  monitoring  program  is  in 
Table EMP-8 of the project EMP (including parameters, time and frequency, implementing and 
supervising agencies, and estimated costs). The monitoring shall comply with the methodology 
provided  in  the  relevant  national  environmental  monitoring  standards.  Other  associated 
standards to be followed are the national environmental quality standards of air, surface water, 
groundwater and noise, and the pollutant discharge standards.  
Internal  monitoring  and  supervision  and  reporting  by  CSCs.  During  construction, 
127. 
the  CSCs  will  be  responsible  for  conducting  internal  environmental  monitoring  in  accordance 
with  the  monitoring  plan  (Table  EMP-7,  Table  EMP-8  of  the  EMP).  Supervision  results  will  be 
reported through the CSC reports to the PIOs.  
128.  EMP  implementation  monitoring  and  progress  reporting.  The  LIEC  will  review 
project  progress  and  compliance  with  the  EMP  based  on  field  visits,  and  the  review  of  the 
environmental monitoring conducted by the EMS. The findings of the LIECs will be reported to 
ADB through the semiannual EMP monitoring and progress reports. The reports will include (i) 
progress  made  in  EMP  implementation,  (ii)  overall  effectiveness  of  the  EMP  implementation 
(including  public  and  occupational  health  and  safety),  (iii)  environmental  monitoring  and 
65 
compliance, (iv) institutional strengthening and training, (v) public consultation (including GRM), 
and  (vi)  any  problems  encountered  during  construction  and  operation,  and  the  relevant 
corrective  actions  undertaken.  The  LIEC  will  help  PMO  prepare  the  reports  and  submit  the 
English report to ADB for appraisal and disclosure.  
129.  Project  completion  environmental  audits.  Upon  completion  of  each  subproject, 
environmental  acceptance  monitoring  and  audit  reports  shall  be  (i)  prepared  by  a  licensed 
environmental  monitoring  institute  in  accordance  with  the  PRC’s  Guideline  on  Project 
Completion Environmental Audit (2001), (ii) reviewed for approval of the official commencement 
of individual subproject operation by environmental authorities, and (iii) finally reported to ADB 
through  the  semiannual  EMP  monitoring  and  progress  reporting  process.  These  subproject 
completion  reports  shall  be  finalized  within  3  months  after  each  subproject  completion,  or  no 
later than 1 year with permission of the local environment protection bureaus.  
130.  Environmental compliance monitoring by local EMS. The PIOs in each city or county 
will contract the city or county EMS to conduct environmental monitoring in accordance with the 
monitoring  program.  A  detailed  cost  breakdown will  be  provided by  the  county  EMS  when the 
environmental  monitoring  program  is  updated  at  the  start  of  each  component  implementation. 
Monitoring  will  be  conducted  during  construction  and  operation  period,  until  a  PCR  is  issued. 
Semiannual  monitoring  reports  will  be  prepared  by  the  EMSs  and  submitted  to  PMO  and  the 
PIOs.  
131.  Quality assurance/quality control for compliance monitoring. To ensure accuracy of 
the  monitoring,  the  QA/QC  procedures  will  be  conducted  in  accordance  with  the  following 
regulations:  
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
Regulations  of  QA/AC Management for  Environmental  Monitoring  issued by  the 
State Environmental Protection Administration in July 2006;  
QA/QC  Manual  for  Environmental Water  Monitoring (Second  edition),  published 
by the State Environmental Monitoring Centre in 2001; and  
QA/QC  Manual  for  Environmental  Air  Monitoring  published  by  the  State 
Environmental Monitoring Centre in 2001. 
b) 
Land Acquisition and Resettlement 
132.  Requirements  for  both  the  internal  and  external  monitoring  and  evaluation  (M&E)  are 
included in the resettlement plans. The Shandong Province PMO will summarize LAR progress 
in the quarterly progress reports to ADB. Furthermore, the Shandong Province PMO will ensure 
an external resettlement monitoring institute or firm is engaged to assess progress and evaluate 
results.  Resettlement  baseline  surveys  will  be  completed  before  the  LAR  begins  and  the  first 
monitoring  report  will  be  submitted  in  December  2015.  After  that  and  until  the  project 
completion,  semiannual  monitoring  reports  will  be  prepared  and  submitted  to  ADB  and  the 
PMO.  
3. 
Social and gender monitoring 
133.  Social  and  gender  action  plan.  Monitoring  and  evaluation  of  the  SGAP  will  be 
incorporated into the overall monitoring and evaluation plan for the project. The PMO and PIOs 
will  be  responsible  for  establishing  and  coordinating  regular  monitoring  and  evaluation.  ADB 
staff  with  expertise  in  gender  issues  will  participate  in  the  midterm  review.  The  project 
implementation  consultant  will  work  with  Shandong  PMO  and  PIO  staff  to  create  an

semiannual  progress  report,  and  review  the  second  semiannual  report  prepared  by  the  PMO 
and PIOs.  
C. 
Evaluation 
134. 
In  addition  to  regular  monitoring,  project  performance  will  be  reviewed  at  least  once  a 
year  jointly  by  ADB  and  the  SWRD.  The  review  will  assess  implementation  performance  and 
achievement  of  project  outcomes  and  outputs,  assess  financial  progress,  identify  issues  and 
constraints affecting implementation, and work out a time-bound action plan for their resolution. 
ADB  and  SWRD  will  undertake  a  midterm  review  to  assess  implementation  status  and  take 
appropriate measures—including modification of scope and implementation arrangements, and 
reallocation  of  loan  proceeds,  as  appropriate—to  achieve  the  project  impact  and  outcome. 
Within 3 months of physical completion of the project, SWRD will submit a PCR to ADB.  
D. 
Reporting 
135.  SWRD  will  provide  ADB  with  (i)  quarterly  progress  reports  in  a  format  consistent  with 
ADB's  project  performance  reporting  system;  (ii)  consolidated  annual  reports  including  (a) 
progress achieved by output as measured through the indicator's performance targets, (b) key 
implementation  issues  and  solutions;  (c)  updated  procurement  plan  and  (d)  updated 
implementation plan for next 12 months; and (iii) a PCR within 6 months of physical completion 
of the project. To ensure projects continue to be both viable and sustainable, project accounts 
and  the  executing  agency  AFSs,  together  with  the  associated  auditor's  report,  should  be 
adequately reviewed.  
136.  Within 6 months after project completion, the PMO will prepare, in coordination with the 
PIO and SPG, and submit to ADB a PCR evaluating the performance of the PMO and PIO; and 
summarizing  the  loan  funds  utilization,  project  implementation,  attainment  of  project  impact, 
outcome,  and  outputs,  implementation  experience,  project  performance,  actual  costs  incurred, 
benefits,  and  other  information  requested  by  ADB,  and  assessing  the  accomplishment  of  the 
purposes of the loan.  
E. 
Stakeholder Communication Strategy 
137.  Relevant  project  information,  including  implementation  progress,  will  be  disclosed  in 
ADB  website  and  at  the  PMO  and  PIOs.  This  may  include  the  DMF,  the  environmental 
assessment,  the  EMP,  resettlement  plans,  and  SGAP.  Stakeholder  workshops  will  be  held 
throughout  project  implementation  to  encourage  key  stakeholders,  particularly  workers  and 
residents  in project  areas,  to  participate  in  achieving  the  project  benefits  and to make sure all 
stakeholders, including women, poor and other vulnerable groups, benefit from the project.  
X. 
ANTICORRUPTION POLICY 
138.  ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any violations of the 
Anticorruption  Policy  relating  to  the  project. 22  All  contracts  financed  by  ADB  shall  include 
provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the 
executing agency and all project contractors, suppliers, consultants and other service providers. 
22  Available at: http://www.adb.org/Documents/Policies/Anticorruption-Integrity/Policies-Strategies.pdf 
67 
Individuals/entities  on  ADB’s  anticorruption  debarment  list  are  ineligible  to  participate  in  ADB-
financed activity and may not be awarded any contracts under the project.23  
139.  To support these efforts, relevant provisions are included in the loan agreement and the 
bidding documents for the project.  
XI. 
ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISM 
140.  People  who  are,  or may  in the future  be,  adversely  affected  by the  project  may  submit 
complaints  to  ADB’s  Accountability  Mechanism.  The  Accountability  Mechanism  provides  an 
independent  forum  and  process  whereby  people  adversely  affected  by  ADB-assisted  projects 
can voice, and seek a resolution of their problems, as well as report alleged violations of ADB’s 
operational  policies  and  procedures.  Before  submitting  a  complaint  to  the  Accountability 
Mechanism, affected people should make a good faith effort to solve their problems by working 
with  the  concerned  ADB  operations  department.    Only  after  doing  that,  and  if  they  are  still 
dissatisfied, should they approach the Accountability Mechanism.24  
XII. 
RECORD OF PAM CHANGES 
141.  All revisions and/or updates during course of implementation should  be retained in this 
Section to provide a chronological history of changes to implemented arrangements recorded in 
the PAM.
