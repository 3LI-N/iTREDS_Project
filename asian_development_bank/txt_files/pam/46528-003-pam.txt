Project Administration Manual for the Project Design Advance: Purpose and 
Process 
The  project  administration  manual  (PAM)  for  the  Project  Design  Advance  (PDA)  is  an 
abridged  version  of  ADB’s  regular  PAM  and  describes  the  essential  administrative  and 
management requirements to implement the PDA on time, within budget, and in accordance 
with  Government  and  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  policies  and  procedures.  The  PDA 
PAM  should  include  references  to  all  available  templates  and  instructions  either  through 
linkages to relevant URLs or directly incorporated in the PAM. 
The  Punjab  Irrigation  Department  (PID)  and  Project  Management  Unit  (PMU)  are  wholly 
responsible for the implementation of ADB financed PDA projects, as agreed jointly between 
the  borrower  and  ADB,  and  in  accordance  with  Government  and  ADB’s  policies  and 
procedures. ADB staff is responsible to support implementation including compliance by PID 
and  PMU  of  their  obligations  and  responsibilities  for  PDA  project  implementation  in 
accordance with ADB’s policies and procedures. 
At  PDA  Loan  Negotiations, the  borrower  and ADB  shall  agree to the  PDA  PAM  and ensure 
consistency with the PDA Loan Agreement. Such agreement shall be reflected in the minutes 
of the PDA Loan Negotiations. In the event of any discrepancy or contradiction between the 
PDA  PAM  and  the  PDA  Loan  Agreement,  the  provisions  of  the  PDA  Loan  Agreement  shall 
prevail. 
After  ADB’s  approval  of  the  PDA  proposal,  changes  in  implementation  arrangements  are 
subject to agreement and approval pursuant to relevant Government and ADB administrative 
procedures  (including  the  Project  Administration  Instructions),  and  upon  such  approval  they 
will be subsequently incorporated in the PDA PAM.

PROPOSED PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
1. 
The proposed Jalalpur Irrigation Project (JIP) is located in Punjab, Pakistan. The project 
will  provide  non-perennial  irrigation  supplies  to  about  65,000  ha  and  will  increase  agricultural 
production  in  two  districts  of  Jhelum  and  Khushab.  The  project  will  (i)  construct  over  200  km 
new  irrigation  canals,  (ii)  introduce  participatory  irrigation  management  structure,  and (iii)  build 
the farmers capacity. It will directly benefit over 200,000 rural people, mostly poor. The Project 
Design  Advance  (PDA)  and  the  ensuing  project  are  listed  in  the  country  operations  business 
plan (COBP: 2016-2018) and will be financed from ADB ordinary capital resources (OCR). The 
project  follows  the  priorities  set  in  the  Country  Partnership  Strategy  (CPS;  2015-2019).  The 
Province of Punjab, acting through the Punjab Irrigation Department (PID), will be the executing 
agency (EA) for the PDA and the ensuing loan.   
2. 
The  project  impact  will  be  the  increased  agricultural  production  in  the  project  area 
(Jhelum  and  Khushab  districts).  The  project  outcome  will  be  irrigation  water  supplies  and 
agricultural  support  services  available  in  the  project  area.  The  project  outputs  will  be  (i)  new 
irrigation  canals  and  appurtenant structures  constructed, (ii) farmers  organizations established, 
(iii) private agriculture support services (PASS) functional, and (iv) capacity of the farmers and 
the staff from PID and Punjab Irrigation and Drainage Authority (PIDA) improved. 
The PDA is required to achieve better project readiness and is listed in the COBP 2015-
3. 
2017 for $5 million from the OCR. The ensuing project is also listed in the COBP 2016-2018 in 
the  year  2017,  estimated  to  cost  $100  million  (ADB’s  share).  Indus  River  System  Authority 
(IRSA) has already issued a no objection to this project on 9 September 2014 following para. 8 
and 14(d) of the Water Apportionment Accord 1991 for the allocated share for the provinces.1  
4. 
The  project’s  feasibility  study  was  prepared  under  ADB  project  preparatory  technical 
assistance  (TA  8404-PAK).  The  feasibility  study,  including  technical  assessment,  preliminary 
design  and  cost  estimates,  a  project-level  draft  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plan  (LARP) 
and agricultural and social studies, is available. The project will construct about 110 km of main 
canal,  176  km  of  distributary  canals  and  59  cross  drainage  structures  for  safe  disposal  of 
floodwater  from  the  nearby  hill  torrents.  The  main  canal  will  be  designed  for  a  discharge 
capacity  of  38.2 cubic meters  per  second  (cumecs)  at the  Rasul  Barrage. The  main canal  will 
run along the right bank of river Jhelum from Rasul Barrage to Khushab town. No modification 
to the Rasul Barrage will be made as it already has a provision for canal head regulator.

IMPLEMENTATION PLANS 
A. 
PDA Readiness Activities 
The  existing  project  management  unit  (PMU)  of  the  Lower  Bari  Doab  Canal 
5. 
Improvement  Project  (LBDCIP)  has  experienced and qualified  staff  and  will  be  responsible for 
procurement and administration of PDA. The consultant selection process was initiated in March 
2015  and  is  substantially  completed:  shortlisting  is  complete  and  technical  and  financial 
proposals  evaluated.  The  consultancy  contract  agreement  will  be  ready  for  signing  upon 
effectiveness of the PDA agreement. 
1  For development of new irrigation systems that divert more than the existing flows from Indus rivers system, IRSA’s 
permission  is  required  to  ensure  that  each  province  draws  its  allocated  share  of  water  as  defined  in  the  Water 
Apportionment Accord, 1991.  
The  existing  PMU  has  qualified  staff  for  its  technical,  safeguards  and  financial 
6. 
management  departments.  For  PDA  implementation,  the  PMU  will  be  further  strengthened  by 
support consultants for procurement, safeguards and engineering matters. The EA ensured that 
PMU has adequate capacity to implement both LBDCIP and JIP and that PMU will continue to 
implement JIP after completion of LBDCIP on 30 September 2016. The Consultants under the 
PDA will update the safeguards and other technical documents for the project. Overall PDA and 
project implementation plan is hereunder.

V. 
FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT 
A. 
Financial Management Assessment 
A  financial  management  assessment  (FMA)  and  a  risk  assessment  of  country  level 
10. 
systems  were  conducted  by  ADB  in  2014  focusing  on  financial  accounting,  auditing,  and 
mitigation measures. Final risk rating of financial risk management arrangements for the project 
is assessed as substantial. The financial management risks for PID identified during the earlier 
assessment for Trimmu and Panjnad Barrages Improvement Project in 2014 included the lack 
of an internal audit function, vacant financial management positions in the project management 
office,  required  development  of  accounting  and  financial  management  manuals,  etc.  It  was 
8 
assessed  that  PID  has  satisfactory  financial  management  capacity  to  record  financial 
transactions  and  balances,  maintain  regular  records  and  monitoring  reports,  and  safeguard 
assets.  The  assessment  was  conducted  in  accordance  with  the  financial  management 
guidelines and financial due diligence methodology note. PID ensured to fill the vacant position 
of  financial  management  expert  and  arrange  the  internal  audit  by  31  January  2016  and 
accounting and finance manual will be available by 30 June 2016.   
B. 
Disbursement 
11. 
The PDA loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB’s Loan Disbursement 
Handbook  (2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time),2 and  detailed  arrangements  agreed  upon 
between  the  Government  and  ADB.  Online  training  for  project  staff  on  disbursement  policies 
and  procedures  is  available  at:  http://wpqr4.adb.org/disbursement_elearning.  Project  staff  is 
encouraged  to  avail  this  training  to  help  ensure  efficient  disbursement  and  fiduciary  control. 
Direct  payments  procedures  will  be  used  for  consulting  services.  Before  submitting  the  first 
withdrawal  application,  EAD  should  submit  to  ADB  sufficient  evidence  of  the  authority  of  the 
person(s) who will sign the withdrawal applications on behalf of the government, together with 
the  authenticated  specimen  signatures  of  each  authorized  person.  The  minimum  value  per 
withdrawal  application  is  US$100,000  equivalent.    Individual  payments  below  this  amount 
should  be  paid  by  the  EA  or  IA  and  subsequently  claimed  to  ADB  through  reimbursement, 
unless otherwise approved by ADB.  
C. 
Accounting  
PMU will maintain separate PDA project accounts and records by funding source for all 
12. 
expenditures  incurred  on  the  PDA  project.  PID  will  use  the  International  Public  Sector 
Accounting  Standards  by  International  Federation  of  Accountants  and  consolidates  project 
financial statements accordingly.  
D. 
Auditing 
13. 
PID  will  cause  the  detailed  consolidated  project  financial  statements  to  be  audited  in 
accordance  with  International  Standards  on  Auditing  and  with  the  Government's  audit 
regulations,  by  an  independent  auditor  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  audited  project  financial 
statements will be submitted in the English language to ADB within six months of the end of the 
fiscal year by the PID.  
14. 
The annual audit report for the project accounts will include an audit management letter 
and  audit  opinions  which  cover  (i)  whether the project financial  statements  present  a true  and 
fair  view  or  are  presented  fairly,  in  all  material  respects,  in  accordance  with  the  applicable 
financial reporting framework; (ii) whether PDA loan proceeds were used only for the purposes 
of the project or not; and (iii) the level of compliance for each financial covenant contained in the 
legal agreements for the PDA project. 
Compliance  with  financial  reporting  and  auditing  requirements  will  be  monitored  by 
15. 
review  missions  and  during  normal  program  supervision,  and  followed  up  regularly  with  all 
concerned, including the external auditor.

The  Government,  PID,  and  PMU  have  been  made  aware  of  ADB’s  policy  on  delayed 
16. 
submission, and the requirements for satisfactory and acceptable quality of the audited project 
financial  statements.3 ADB  reserves  the  right  to  require  a  change  in  the  auditor  (in  a  manner 
consistent with the constitution of the borrower), or for additional support to be provided to the 
auditor, if the audits required are not conducted in a manner satisfactory to ADB, or if the audits 
are  substantially  delayed.  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  verify  the  project's  financial  accounts  to 
confirm  that  the  share  of  ADB’s  financing  is  used  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  policies  and 
procedures.  
17. 
Public  disclosure  of  the  project  financial  statements,  including  the  audit  report  on  the 
project  financial  statements,  will  be  guided  by  ADB’s  Public  Communications  Policy  (2011).4 
After review, ADB will disclose the project financial statements for the project and the opinion of 
the  auditors  on  the  financial  statements  within  30  days  of  the  date  of  their  receipt  by  posting 
them on ADB’s website. The Audit Management Letter will not be disclosed.

detailed  in  Section  D.  The  three  consultancy  services  with  an  estimated  823  person-months 
including  4  person-months  of  international  and  819  person-months  of  national  experts  are 
required  to  (i)  facilitate  PDA  project  management  and  implementation,  (ii)  strengthen  the 
institutional  and  operational  capacity  of  the  implementing  agency,  and  (iii)  design  review  for 
quality assurance and efficiency.8 The national consulting services will be used due to adequate 
in-country capacity of similar assignments, lack of availability of quality international experts due 
to  security  reasons  and  cost  effectiveness.  Consulting  firm  for  the  detailed  design  will  be 
engaged using the quality- and cost-based selection (QCBS) method with a quality: cost ratio of 
90:10.  The  Consultant  will  field  their  core  staff  for  all  key  components.  The  consultants,  who 
were involved in the upstream work such  as feasibility study of this project, will be considered 
eligible  to  compete  for  detailed  design,  should  they  express  interest  in  doing  so,  their  current 
activities  do  not  grant  them  an  unfair  competitive  advantage  (see  para.  1.12  of  the  ADB’s 
Guidelines on the Use of Consultants; 2013).

the project documents. 
31. 
At  detailed  design  stage,  the  Consultant  under  PDA  will  closely  work  with  the 
communities  in  identification,  planning  and  design  of  distribution  canals  to  be  implemented 
under  community  contracting.  The  PDA  will  help  determining  dimensions  and  extent  of  the 
canals  and  appurtenant  structures  and  updating  the  list  of  affected  persons  and  the  LARPs 
accordingly. The communities in general and affected persons in particular. PID will announce 
the award of consultancy services and disclosed draft LARPs and EIA on their website. 
32. 
At  project  implementation  stage  for  safeguards,  PID  will  publicly  disclose  the  EIA  and 
ensure  that  meaningful  public  consultations  (including  both  men  and  women)  are  undertaken 
with  affected  groups  and  local  NGOs.  The  list  of  people  attending  the  consultation,  time, 
locations, and subjects discussed during consultation will be recorded in a systematic manner. 
The  updated  and  final  LARPs  will  be  translated  into  local  languages  and  disclosed  through 
public  notices  posted  at  the  PID  offices,  published  in  newspapers,  and  posted  on  ADB’s 
website. Affected people will be consulted in all aspects of LAR as required.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION 
The  proposed  Jalalpur  Irrigation  Project  is  located  between  longitude  from  72o-20’  to 
6. 
73o-31’  (east)  and  latitude  from  32o-25  to  32o-43’  (north)  along  right  bank  of  River  Jhelum  in 
Punjab, Pakistan. The project area is bounded by the salt range hills in the northwest and the 
River Jhelum in the southwest. The groundwater is mainly recharges by the nearby hill torrents 
and is largely saline. The project area is assessable through a six lane motorway and a National 
Highway  and  at  a  two  hour  drive  from  the  Capital  Islamabad  and  three  hour  drive  from  the 
provincial capital, Lahore. 
7. 
The  Government  of  Punjab  planned  Jalalpur  Irrigation  Project,  a  new  non-perennial 
irrigation  system  to  enhance  the  agricultural  production  in  Districts  Jhelum  and  Khushab.  The 
irrigation system to be developed shall irrigate about  65,000 hectares of land located in Tehsil 
Pind  Daden  Khan  and  Khushab  of  the  two  districts.  Indus  River  System  Authority  (IRSA)  has 
issued a no objection to the subject project on 9 September 2014 following paras. 8 and 14(d) of 
Water Apportionment Accord 1991. 
The  area  is  located  between  river  Jhelum  and  Salt  range  from  Shahpur  to  Khushab 
8. 
town. Presently, irrigation is practiced only on edge of river Jhelum and remaining area of about 
65,000 hectares is rainfed or tubewell irrigation, which is largely saline. Under the proposed JIP, 
a new non-perennial irrigation system will be constructed. The main canal of about 110 km will 
start from  Rasul  Barrage  and  will follow  along the  right  bank  of Jhelum River.  The main canal 
will  have  a  discharge  of  about  38.2  cubic  meters  per  second  (cumecs)  (1350  cusec)  at  Rasul 
Barrage. Space for the canal Head regulator is already available at the existing Rasul Barrage.   
The command area of JIP is in the form of a long strip of land bounded by the salt range 
9. 
hills  on  northern side  and Jhelum  River  (right  bank)  on southern  side. The  distribution  system 
about  176  km  comprising  of  distributaries  and  minors  extends  up  to  the  right  bank  of  Jhelum 
River. There are about 59 hill torrents of varying catchment size which flow across the project 
area and ultimately fall in Jhelum River. The climate in the project area is hot and arid. Summer 
(May-August) temperatures vary from 180 C to 460 C and winter (November-February from 00 C 
to 240 C). In spring and autumn, temperatures are moderate. The rainfall is low and erratic and 
the  pan  evaporation  is  three  times  of  average  yearly  rainfall,  requiring  irrigation  essential  for 
crop production. 
10. 
Presently,  farmers  in  the  project  area  are  practicing  mainly  rain  fed  agriculture 
18 
associated  with  tube  well  farming.  Dominant  crops  in  the  area  are  wheat,  cotton,  rice, 
sugarcane, maize, fodder, potatoes, vegetables, citrus and onion crops. Farmers in the project 
area face low agricultural production and low farm incomes as the result of frequent crop failure, 
low crop yields, low farm profitability and secondary salinization. 
11. 
The project is expected to increase crop production and reduce the land degradation by 
minimizing  the  marginal  quality  groundwater  use.  The  project  will  (i)  construct  main  canal, 
distribution system and appurtenant structures; (ii) introduce institutional reforms and establish 
farmer’s  organizations  (FOs);  and  (iii)  build  capacity  of  the  farmers,  FOs,  and  staff  from  the 
Punjab Irrigation Department (PID) and Punjab Irrigation and Drainage Authority (PIDA). 
12. 
The  Government  of  Punjab  has  approached  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for 
providing  facility  of  Project  Design  Advance  (PDA)  for  carrying  out  detailed  design,  drawings 
and bidding documents preparation of Jalalpur Irrigation Project. This PDA equivalent to US$5.0 
million will be used for procurement of Consulting Services for JIP.  
III.
