Project Administration Manual Purpose and Process 
The  project  administration  manual  (PAM)  describes  the  essential  administrative  and  management 
requirements to implement the project on time, within budget, and in accordance with  Government and 
Asian Development Bank (ADB) policies and procedures. The PAM includes references to all available 
templates and instructions either through linkages to relevant URLs or directly incorporated in the PAM. 
The Gansu Provincial Government (GPG), the project executing agency, Gansu Department of Finance 
(DOF) on behalf of GPG, and the implementing agencies, including  Bureaus of Agriculture and Animal 
Husbandry  (BAAHs)  of  11  project  counties,  and  3  financial  intermediaries  (FIs),  i.e.  Bank  of  Lanzhou 
(BOL),  Bank  of  Gansu  (BOG),  and  Yuzhong  Shanghai  Pudong  Development  Rural  Bank  are  wholly 
responsible  for  the  project  implementation,  as  agreed  jointly  between  the  borrower  and  ADB,  in 
accordance  with  Government  and  ADB’s  policies  and  procedures.  ADB  staff  is  responsible  to  support 
implementation  including  compliance  by  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies  of  their  obligations 
and responsibilities for project implementation in accordance with ADB’s policies and procedures. 
At Loan Negotiations the borrower and ADB agreed to the PAM and ensured consistency with the Loan 
Agreement.  Such  agreement  is  reflected  in  the  minutes  of  the  Loan  Negotiations.  In  the  event  of  any 
discrepancy  or  contradiction  between  the  PAM  and  the  Loan  Agreement,  the  provisions  of  the  Loan 
Agreement shall prevail. 
After ADB Board approval of the project's report and recommendations of the President (RRP) changes 
in  implementation  arrangements  are  subject  to  agreement  and  approval  pursuant  to  relevant 
Government  and  ADB  administrative procedures  (including the  Project  Administration Instructions)  and 
upon such approval they will be subsequently incorporated in the PAM.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
1. 
The  proposed  project  aims  to  support  the  production  and  access to market  of featured 
agricultural products in the southeastern Gansu Province. The project will also help develop the 
rural  financial  service  system,  which  plays  a  key  role  in  agricultural  development.  The  project 
proposes  to  adopt  the  financial  intermediation  loan  (FIL)  modality,  which  through  establishing 
partnerships with local commercial banks, can promote the development of the agriculture and 
rural finance sectors in a market-oriented approach. The project is expected to help increase the 
income of farmer households as well as other rural residents in the project area. 
2. 
While the People’s Republic of China (PRC) has achieved remarkable economic growth 
since the late 1970s, rural development remains an important challenge. Rural poverty is more 
pervasive and  persistent  in the  western and  inland provinces  than  the more  advanced coastal 
regions.  Some  key  policy  challenges  include  how  to  (i)  restructure  and  modernize  the 
agriculture  sector  toward  sustainable  and  faster  productivity  growth,  (ii)  diversify  agriculture 
production and create modern agricultural value chains that allow for the professionalization of 
farmers and support rural income growth, (iii) reform rural institutions and improve the financial 
institutions serving the rural sector, and (iv) protect land and water resources for food security 
and environmental sustainability. 
The project area covers 11 counties in the sourtheastern Gansu, which have enormous 
3. 
demand and potential for modern agricultural development. The project area is located in one of 
14  areas  of  national  focus  for  poverty  reduction  designated  in  the  Outline  for  Development-
Oriented  Poverty  Reduction  for  China’s  Rural  Areas,  2011–2020.  Most  people  in  the  project 
area depend on agriculture and livestock, and are poor and vulnerable. The average rural per 
capita  net  income  in  2013  was  CNY4,122—81%  of  the  provincial  average  and  46%  of  the 
national  average.  All  the  farms  are  very  small,  averaging  about  2.5  mu  per  capita  or  0.17 
hectare.1 About 51% of household income in the project area is from farming and livestock, and 
rural  unemployment  and  underemployment  are  significant.  Grain  crop  production,  which 
accounts for about 59% of the total sown area and 33% of household income, is mainly based 
on  small-scale  and  fragmented  household  operations  with  limited  productive  assets  at  the 
household level. Grain crop production usually only generates marginal profit, if any, since input 
costs have increased more than grain prices.2 
4. 
Alternatives to grain crops include a number of cash and tree crops that are suitable in 
the  arid  and  semiarid  climatic  and  soil  conditions  of  the  project  area.  These  include  various 
types  of  vegetables  such  as  potatoes,  edible  lilies,  eggplants,  peppers,  tomatoes,  and  celery; 
medicinal  plants  such  as  angelica  and  Asia  bell;  and  tree  crops  such  as  apples  and  pears. 
These  cash  crops,  often  referred  to  as  featured  agriculture,  have  potential  for  higher  market 
value  if  produced  efficiently  on  scale  and  with  improved  quality.  The  government  has  tried  to 
promote restructuring of the sector by increasing the proportion of featured agriculture activities, 
mainly through financial and technical assistance to farmers and farmer cooperatives to develop 
large-scale production bases for these crops. The production base approach is also desirable to 
promote  the  application  of  environment-friendly  measures  such  as  climate-smart  agriculture 
practices  and  water  efficiency  techniques.  However,  progress  has  been  slow  because  of  the 
limited financial and technical resources available to the government and farmers. 
1  A mu is a Chinese unit of measurement (1 mu = 666.67 square meters). 
2  Data  in  this  section  come  from  government  statistic  data  provided  by  the  provincial  project  management  office 
(PMO) unless otherwise indicated.

Livestock production, such as sheep, dairy cow, cattle, and pig rearing, is also part of the 
5. 
featured agriculture and has been another main source of income for farmer households in the 
project area, contributing 17.6% to total household income. However, livestock and associated 
income  growth  is  severely  constrained  by  the  limited  scale  of  production  and  traditional 
technologies applied. Establishing specialized livestock farms with up-to-date technologies has 
become  a  priority  for  livestock  development.  The  Gansu  Provincial  12th  Five-Year  Plan  for 
Animal  Husbandry  particularly  encourages 
for 
standardized livestock farming to enhance productivity and quality of livestock sector. 
the  establishment  of  production  bases 
6. 
Farmers  also  need  to  access  broad  markets  and  understand  consumer  demands  to 
diversify  into  higher-value  crops  and  livestock.  The  challenges  of  smallholder  farmers  in  this 
regard are characterized by the small quantity and moderate or poor quality of products brought 
to the market. As a result, 70%–80% of vegetables produced in Gansu Province are marketed 
through  local  brokers,  who  go  from  village  to  village  to  collect  the  products  after  they  have 
obtained contracts from the big buyers. Low levels of organization and weak marketing capacity 
of  individual  farmers  give  brokers  strong  bargaining  power.  Brokers  thus  earn  a  big  share  of 
profits  in  the  supply  chain  when  dealing  with  farmers  at  the  farm  gate.  Although  farmer 
cooperatives  and  agricultural  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises  (ASMEs)  have  played  an 
increasing  role  in linking farmers  to markets,  they  are  still  at  an  early  stage  of  development  in 
the project area.3 They are generally small in scale, having limited capacity to develop a value 
chain or to service their members, have weak governance, and face difficulties obtaining credit. 
External  assistance  is  needed  for  them  to  (i)  expand  operations  with  diversified  business 
models;  (ii)  enhance  capacity  for  grading,  processing,  packing,  storing,  and  marketing;  and 
(iii) strengthen governance and management. This would also make them more bankable. 
7. 
Strong rural financial markets and institutions with sizable outreach is another key factor 
to develop featured agriculture. Although 67 traditional financial institutions or branches, mainly 
rural credit cooperatives and commercial banks, are present in the project counties, they fail to 
meet  the  demand,  especially  that  of  smallholder  farmers  and  ASMEs,  because  both  their 
priorities and expertise focus on industrial and commercial lending.4 Following recent policies for 
rural  financial  market  development,  rural  financial  service  providers  (RFSPs)  have  emerged. 
These  include  some  53  microcredit  companies,  six  village  and  township  banks,  and  384  rural 
mutual  cooperatives  that  were  in  the  project  counties  by  2014.  The  RFSPs  are  generally 
smaller,  better  appreciating  the  potential  of  agricultural  projects,  and  more  accustomed  to 
dealing  with small  customers.  As a result,  relatively  small  loans to agriculture  have  increased. 
However, the RFSPs are still at an early stage of development and are either prohibited by law 
or constrained by their short history to take deposits from the public. In addition, they are also 
short  on  capable  staff  and  physical  and  technical  capacity  to  provide  more  services  for  rural 
customers. 
Previous  experience  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  other  development 
8. 
partners in the sector in the PRC indicates that the government is generally constrained by its 
capacity  and often  assumes  large credit  risks  acting  as  direct  lender to agricultural  borrowers. 
To address the issue, the project, whose target subborrowers are all from the private sector with 
demand  for  small  and  short-term  (1–3  years)  credit,  proposes  to  adopt  the  financial 
intermediation loan modality. Active rural financial market reform since the 1990s has led to the 
rise of many local commercial banks in the PRC. Some of them have properly aligned interest 
and  capacity  in  agricultural  finance  as  well  as  sound  governance  and  incentive  systems,  and 
3  Agricultural  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises  are  those  with  annual  sales  revenue  below  or  equal  to 
CNY200 million, which follows the PRC’s national standard issued in 2011.

thus can serve as good financial intermediaries to onlend to farmers, cooperatives, ASMEs, and 
RFSPs.  Through  partnerships  with  local  commercial  banks  and  careful  implementation,  the 
project could (i) eliminate government exposure to agricultural borrowers by onlending through 
financial  intermediaries  that  are  better  positioned  to  assess  and  assume  sub-borrower  credit 
risk,  (ii)  use  loan  resources  more  efficiently  by  revolving  loan  proceeds,  and  (iii)  mobilize 
additional funding resources from financial intermediaries to support agriculture. 
9. 
The project will assist the project counties in (i) developing market-oriented production of 
locally featured cash crops, tree crops, and livestock products; (ii) improving market linkages for 
featured  agricultural  products  by  supporting  profitable  and  promising  farmer  cooperatives  and 
ASMEs; and (iii) enhancing rural financial services with increased funding, service capacity, and 
technical  skills.  The  project  is  fully  aligned  with  the  government’s  agricultural  development 
strategies and policies in the western regions, which encourage farmers to organize themselves 
for  specialized  production  and  call  for  transforming  fragmented  production  to  economic  scale 
market-oriented  production  through  land  transfer,  growth  of  farmer  cooperatives  and  agro-
enterprises, and enhanced rural financial services. The project is also in line with the upcoming 
ADB country partnership strategy for the PRC, 2016–2020, which identifies inclusive growth as 
one of its three pillars, supported by boosting rural livelihoods and improving access to finance, 
and with ADB’s strategic priorities of the Midterm Review of Strategy 2020.5 
The  impact  will  be  increased  income  of  rural  residents  in  Gansu  Province,  which  is  in 
10. 
line with the upcoming 13th Five Year Plan of Gansu Province, 2016–2020. The outcome will be 
more productive, market-oriented agricultural activities in 11 project counties. 
Output  1:  Inclusive  and  environment-friendly  featured  agricultural  production

bases  developed. This output aims to address low agricultural productivity and value addition 
caused  by  fragmented  production  by  (i)  developing  commercial  production  bases  to  gain 
economy  of  scale,  and  (ii)  improving  the  quality  of  products  for  locally  featured  cash  and tree 
crops and livestock. The production bases will be developed by farmers, farmer cooperatives, or 
ASMEs in various models, which will organize or engage individual farmers into more efficient 
and  market-oriented  production  activities.  Capacity  development  will  be  also  conducted  for 
farmers, technicians, and other stakeholders in developing the production bases. 
12. 
Output  2:  Farmer  cooperatives  and  agricultural  enterprises  financed  and 
strengthened. This output will improve the value chain for locally featured agricultural products 
with good market potential to link farmers to profitable markets. The project will support farmer 
cooperatives  and  ASMEs  in  (i)  business  development  or  expansion  through  the  acquisition  of 
packing, grading,  and  processing  equipment; transportation,  technical  equipment;  and  building 
storage;  (ii)  market  development,  including  information  access,  sales  promotion,  and  building 
marketing networks; (iii) branding, including certification and trademark registration for featured 
products;  and  (iv)  capacity  development  for  the  managers  and  key  staff  of  cooperatives  and 
ASMEs  on  business  and  financial  management,  storing  and  processing  techniques,  branding 
and market development, and establishing and implementing governance rules and regulations. 
Output 3: Rural financial service system developed and enhanced. This output aims 
13. 
to  promote  the  financial  viability,  coverage,  and  sustainability  of  the  rural  financial  service 
system. The project will (i) onlend part of the loan proceeds to RFSPs to expand their funding 
resources. The RFSPs will use the loan proceeds to lend to farmers, farmer cooperatives, and 
ASMEs  following  agreed  eligibility  criteria  of  sub-borrowers;  (ii)  establish  grassroots  financial 
service  units  such  as  village  offices  to  extend  rural  financial  service  coverage;  (iii)  develop  or

pilot  test  innovative  financial  services  and  products,  such  as  credit  rating,  bank–insurance 
cooperation, and lending with new types of collateral; and (iv) provide capacity development for 
loan  officers  and  rural  financial  professionals  to  improve  their  lending  skills  to  serve  rural 
customers. 
14. 
Output 4: Capacity for project implementation and management strengthened. To 
ensure  the  successful  implementation  of  the  project,  the  following  activities  will  be  supported 
under  this  output:  (i)  strengthening  the  management  capacity  of  staff  at  provincial  and  county 
project  management  offices  (PMOs);  (ii)  acquiring  office  equipment  to  enhance  the  physical 
capacity  of  provincial  and  county  PMOs;  (iii)  holding  project  management  workshops; 
(iv) project  monitoring  and  evaluation,  including  guiding  and  supporting  the  implementation  of 
the environmental and social management systems (ESMSs); (v) knowledge management; and 
(vi) ensuring financial capacity for daily operations of provincial and county PMOs. 
15. 
Special features. The project design embodies the following innovative features: 
(i) 
financial  support 
linkages  between 
farmer  producers  and  markets 
Promoting agricultural development with a systematic and market-oriented 
to  address  challenges  of  agricultural 
approach.  The  project  attempts 
development  and  rural  income  growth  by  improving  productivity,  market 
connectivity,  and  access  to  finance.  Besides  engaging  farmers  in  more 
productive agricultural activities via production base development, the project will 
through 
strengthen 
cooperatives  and  ASMEs,  and  promote  continuous 
to 
agriculture  and  rural  residents  in  the  long  term.  Moreover,  with  partnership 
between  the  government  and  financial  intermediaries,  loan  resources  could  be 
allocated  in  a  more  market-oriented  manner  to  support  sustainable  agricultural 
projects.  The  government,  through  its  extensive  agricultural  administrative  and 
technical  systems,  could  help  identify  and  develop  subprojects  with  significant 
market  potential  and  apply  environmentally  sound  practices.  The  financial 
intermediaries’  screening,  monitoring,  and  management  of  subloans  will  help 
ensure the subprojects are financially viable and sustainable. 
Supporting a dynamic and competitive rural financial market. A dynamic and 
competitive rural financial market is  important to meet growing demand for rural 
financial  services,  in  which  RFSPs  could  play  a  significant  role.  Under  the 
existing policy framework, commercial banks, especially those large- or medium-
sized, could lend to RFSPs to increase their capital capacity and support RFSPs 
through knowledge sharing. This market link is currently missing. The project will 
help build such linkages, as financial intermediaries will onlend the loan proceeds 
to  RFSPs  together  with their  own  resources  and  provide  training  to  RFSP  staff. 
This will be on a pilot scale, but could generate a large demonstration effect.  
Partnership  with  local  banks.  Three  local  commercial  banks—the  Bank  of 
Lanzhou, the Bank of Gansu, and the Yuzhong Shanghai Pudong Development 
Rural  Bank—are  identified  as  project  financial  intermediaries.  As  small  to 
medium-sized banks, they share the project’s goals of promoting local agriculture 
and  rural  finance  development  in  the  project  area.  The  financial  intermediaries 
will  onlend  the  majority  of  loan  proceeds  to  targeted  sub-borrowers  for 
agricultural  production  base  development  under  output  1  and  business 
development or expansion under output 2, and onlend to RFSPs under output 3. 
They will also contribute about $68.58 million as counterpart funds to be onlent to 
the  targeted  sub-borrowers  of  the  project,  applying  the  same  requirements  and 
eligibility, and to strengthen rural financial services in the project area.

COSTS AND FINANCING 
A. 
Cost Estimates Preparation and Revisions  
Preparation.  The  cost  estimates  were  prepared  jointly  by  the  PPMO  and  ADB  with 
16. 
assistance  from  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (PPTA)  consultant.  The  sources 
and  basis  for  cost  estimates  were  reviewed  during  the  project  preparation  and  had  been 
confirmed  by  related  parties.  The  process  was  facilitated  by  a  model  in  excel  software  which 
enabled  easy  updating  or  revision  if  necessary.  The  model  is  maintained  by  both  PPMO  and 
ADB. 
17. 
Revisions.  Revision  of  cost  estimates  will  be  conducted  when  deemed  necessary 
during  implementation.  The  PPMO  will  be  responsible  in  proposing  and  drafting  the  revision 
which will be subject to ADB approval.

Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan 
The  project  will  take  the  financial  intermediation  loan  (FIL)  modality  for  its  majority  of 
20. 
loan proceeds. The project is estimated to cost $200.0 million (Table 1) based on the projected 
first  batch  of  subprojects. 6  Loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  according  to  ADB’s  Loan 
Disbursement  Handbook  (2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time),  and subject to the provisions 
of the loan agreement. Financial intermediaries (FIs) will revolve the ADB loan proceeds to make 
them available for the subsequent subprojects.7

a    Includes  taxes  and  duties  of  $9.77  million,  to  be  financed  by  the  beneficiaries,  government,  and  Asian 
Development Bank (ADB)  loan resources. The following principles were followed in determining the amount of 
taxes  and  duties  to  be  financed  by  ADB:  (i)  the  amount  is  within  reasonable  country  thresholds,  (ii)  the 
amount  does  not  represent  an  excessive  share  of  the  project  investment  plan,  (iii)  taxes  and  duties  apply 
only  to  ADB-financed expenditures, and  (iv)  the  financing of the taxes and duties is material and relevant to 
the success of the project. 
b   In December 2014 prices. 
c      Physical  contingencies  are  computed  at    5%  for  works  and  goods.  Price  contingencies  are  computed 
using  domestic inflation rates: 3.0% for 2015 onwards; and foreign inflation rates: 1.0% for 2015 and 1.4% for 
2016 onwards. 
d   Includes interest and commitment charges to be capitalized under the ADB loan. Interest during construction 
for the ADB loan has been computed using the  5-year US dollar fixed swap rate plus a spread of 0.50% and 
a  maturity  premium  of  0%.  Commitment  charge  is  0.15%  per  year  to  be  charged  on  the  undisbursed  loan 
amount.  
Note: Numbers may not sum precisely because of rounding.

6   The first batch refers to subprojects financed by loan proceeds initially disbursed by ADB and financial intermediary 
(FI) funds provided in parallel during the loan implementation period. The first batch of subprojects under outputs 1 
and  2  will  be  selected  from  a  long  list  of  subprojects  proposed  and  updated  by  the  government.  Appendix  1 
describes the selection and approval procedures for these subprojects. 
7   For these subprojects, as well as loans made by the FIs to RFSPs and by RFSPs to sub-borrowers under Output 
3, FIs and RFSPs will adopt the eligibility criteria in screening the sub-borrowers, which are described in Appendix 
2. 
13 
The  government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $100  million  from  ADB’s  ordinary  capital 
21. 
resources  to  help  finance  the  project.  The  loan  will  have  a  15-year  term,  including  a  grace 
period  of  9  years,  a  straight  line  repayment  option,  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in 
accordance  with  ADB’s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a 
commitment charge of 0.15% per year,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  to  be  set  forth  in 
the  draft  loan  and  project  agreements.  The  longer  grace  period  is  essential  to  make  the  loan 
proceeds  available  in  full  amount  for  a  greater  number  of  sub-borrowers  to  maximize  the 
benefits  of  FIL.  Based  on  this,  the  average  loan  maturity  is  12.25  years  and  the  maturity 
premium  payable  to  ADB  is  zero  per  annum.  The  ADB  loan  will  also  finance  taxes  and 
duties  for  eligible  ADB-financed expenditures, and transportation  and  insurance  costs  included 
in  the  base  cost  for  ensuring  smooth  project  implementation.  The  interest  during  construction 
and commitment charges will be capitalized. The loan will finance 50% of the project cost. 
22. 
Three local commercials banks have been identified to serve as FIs under the project. FIs 
have agreed to contribute about $68.58 million equivalent, or 34.3% of the project cost, from their 
own  resources  to  the  project.  The  counterpart  funds  from  FIs  will  (i)  finance  a  subset  of 
subprojects for the first batch.8 (ii) be onlent to RFSPs together with ADB funds, and (iii) expand 
rural finance service units, develop innovative financial services, and strengthen capacity of rural 
loan officers of FIs and RFSPs. Subproject beneficiaries under outputs 1 and 2 are expected to 
contribute  in  equity  about  $24.67  million  equivalent,  or  12.3%  of  the  project  cost,  in  kind  or  in 
cash. The rest of the project cost, about $6.75 million equivalent or 3.4% of the total cost, will be 
financed by the GPG.  
23. 
The summary financing plan is in Table 2. The People’s Republic of China (PRC), GPG, 
and  FIs  have  assured  ADB  that  counterpart  funding  will  be  provided  or  secured  in  a  timely 
manner,  including  any  additional  counterpart funding  required for  any  shortfall  of  funds  or  cost 
overruns.

The PRC Government will be the borrower of the loan and re-lend the loan to the GPG. 
GPG will in turn re-lend the loan to the participating county governments. For the loan proceeds 
to be onlent to the sub-borrowers and RFSPs by FIs, each county government will relend to the 
FI assigned to the county in US dollar on the same terms and conditions as those of the ADB 
loan.  The  relending  agreement  between  the  government  and  FI  will  cover,  among  others, 
repayment schedule, risk management, FI’s counterpart funds, and monitoring and reporting. 
25. 
The subloans from FIs to farmers, cooperatives and ASMEs will be in local currency and 
interest rates will be set taking into account the cost of ADB loan, FIs’ operational costs, costs to 
cover  credit  risk  and  exchange  risk,  and  reasonable  profit  margin  for  FIs,  and  subject  to  a

expected for the interest cap (see para. 24).    
14 
maximum  ceiling.9 The  current  ceiling  of  subloan  interest  rate  (6.5%)  falls  into  the  range  of  the 
prevailing market rates in the project area, which range from 6.5% to 12%, and entails a spread 
for the  FIs  equivalent to what they have  on their other funding resources.10 Subloan  tenors  will 
generally be coordinated with subproject needs. For loan proceeds to be re-lent to RFSPs and 
onlent by RFSPs to sub-borrowers, there is no ceiling on the interest rates applied. 
9   FIs  have  agreed  with  the  government  that  (i)  when  ADB  loan  interest  rate  is  below  or  equal  to  2%,  the  ceiling  is 
6.5%; and (ii) the ceiling will be increased by adding 0.5 percentage point if ADB’s interest rate exceeds 2% and by 
adding  an  additional  0.5  percentage  point  each  time  ADB’s  interest  rate  increases  by  0.5  percentage  point 
thereafter. For instance, if ADB loan interest rate falls in 2+~2.5%, the ceiling is 7%, and so on. 
10  The information is based on the reports by the provincial project management office, FIs, and project preparatory 
technical assistance team.

FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT 
A. 
Financial Management Assessment 
The  financial  management  assessment  (FMA)  was  carried  out  in  accordance  with 
26. 
ADB’s  Guidelines  for  the  Financial  Management  and  Analysis  of  Projects,11  and  Financial  Due 
Diligence: a Methodology Note,12  to assess the financial management capacity of the executing 
agency:  GPG  (involving  Department  of  Finance  (DOF),  Department  of  Agriculture  and  Animal 
Husbandry,  and  bureaus  of  finance);  implementing  agencies,  i.e.  bureaus  of  agriculture  and 
animal husbandry (BAAHs) in 11 project counties (Jingchuan, Kongtong, Zhenyuan, Hezheng, 
Jishishan,  Yongjing,  Yuzhong,  Huan,  Min,  Lintao  and  Lingtai)  and  three  FI  banks  (Bank  of 
Gansu,  Bank  of  Lanzhou,  and  Yuzhong  Shanghai  Pudong  Development  Rural  Bank).  The 
FMA  includes  funds-flow  arrangements,  staffing,  accounting  policies  and  procedures,  internal 
and  external  auditing  arrangements,  reporting  and  monitoring,  and  financial  information 
systems.   
The  assessment  indicated  that  (i)  there  are  established  accounting  and  financial 
27. 
management  policies  and  procedures  in  the  PRC,  which  are  strictly  followed  by  the 
executing agency and implementing agencies;  and  (ii) the executing agency and implementing 
agencies have  sound  accounting  and  financial  management  capability  and  are experienced  in 
managing  projects  of  similar  type  and  scale.  However,  the  implementing  agencies)  have  very 
limited  experience  in  implementing  foreign-funded  projects,  and  the  managers  and  financial 
personnel  have  limited  knowledge  and  experience  of  ADB  policies  and  procedures.  It  is 
concluded  that  the  overall  pre-mitigation  financial  management  risk  of  the  implementing 
agencies is  moderate.  
the 
that 
their 
It  was  agreed 
implementing  agencies  will  strengthen

financial 
management  capability  to  manage  the  project,  including  (a)  appointing  full  time  financial 
management staff in PPMO and project accountants in all CPMOs and minimizing the turnover 
of staff; (b) undertaking training on ADB disbursement and financial management requirements 
to all financial management staff; (c) developing an uniformed FM guidelines for the budgeting, 
accounting,  internal  controls,  reporting  and  auditing  arrangements  in  line  with project  activities; 
(d)  streamlining  of  approval  processes  and  following  the  same  financial  reporting  system  in  all 
concerned agencies to ensure accurate and timely reporting of the use of the loan proceeds; (e) 
streamlining of approval processes in terms of budgeting and disbursement at all levels; (f) close 
monitoring  of  loan  covenants  and  compliance  status  during  project  implementation;  and  (g) 
developing  internal  auditing  system  at  county  level  agencies.  Along  with  the  credit  lines  to  be 
provided  to  ASMEs  and  farmer  cooperatives,  dedicated  training  program  will  be  conducted  to 
strengthen  their  capacity  in  financial  management  and  corporative  governance  in  line  with  the 
Law  of  the  People's  Republic  of  China  on  Specialized  Farmers  Cooperatives  and  other 
regulations.  
29. 
To  ensure  that  the  FIs  continue  to  meet  the  prudential  regulatory  requirements  of  the 
China  Banking  Regulatory  Commission  (CBRC)  during  the  project  implementation,  the  PPMO 
will  review  the  annual  prudential  regulatory  rating  for  each  FI  promptly  as  it  is  produced  and 
shall advise ADB if any FI’s rating falls below grade C (or the equivalent if the scale is changed) 
in  the  CBRC  rating  scale  for  commercial  banks.  Necessary  remedial  actions  may  include  an

26 
agreed  action  plan to improve  performance,  acceleration  of the  loan to  the  FI  or  other  actions 
until the FIs’ rating returns to above the minimum acceptable grade. 
30. 
To mitigate the specific risk that ADB loan proceeds are commingled with other funds 
being administered by FIs, a separate ledger account that tracks the receipt and use of the ADB 
loan proceeds, as well as interest payments and principal repayments from the sub-borrowers 
will  be  established  and  maintained  in  each  of  the  FI  banks.  This  will  also  ensure  that  the 
proceeds  utilized  under  the  project  will  be  kept  distinct  from  FIs’  own  assets  and  provide 
protection against adverse results from other financial operations of the FIs. 
B. 
Disbursement 
i. 
Disbursement Arrangements for ADB Funds 
The 
loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed 
in  accordance  with  ADB’s  Loan 
31. 
Disbursement  Handbook  (2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  detailed  arrangements 
agreed  upon  between the government and ADB.13  
32. 
The  Gansu provincial  DOF  has the  primary responsibility for  the  administration  of the 
overall  disbursement  arrangements  of  the  project.  The  imprest  account  is  to  be  used 
exclusively  for  ADB’s  share  of  eligible  expenditures.  The  GPG,  through  DOF,  who  establishes 
the  imprest  account  in  its  name,  is  accountable  and  responsible  for  proper  use  of  advances 
to  the  imprest  account.14  The  government  may  request  for  initial  and  additional  advances  to 
the  imprest  account  based  on  6  months  estimated  expenditures  to  be  financed  through  the 
imprest  account.  The  imprest  account  will  be  established,  managed,  and  liquidated  in 
accordance  with  ADB’s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  and  detailed  arrangements  agreed  by 
the  government  and  ADB.  The  currency  of  the  imprest  account  is  US  dollar.  The  handbook 
describes  (i)  which  supporting  documents  should  be  submitted  to  ADB,  and  (ii)  which  should 
be retained by  the government for liquidation and replenishment of an imprest account. 
33. 
The  implementing  agencies  will  be  responsible  for  the  disbursement  arrangements 
for  each  of  the  subprojects,  including  (i)  preparing  disbursement  projections,  (ii)  requesting 
budgetary  allocations  for  counterpart  funds,  (iii)  collecting  supporting  documents,  and  (iv) 
preparing  withdrawal  applications.  The  county  bureaus  of  finance  will  review  and  verify  the 
withdrawal applications from the respective BAAHs and FIs through CPMOs and submit to DOF 
through PPMO for review and consolidation before the withdrawal application is sent to ADB. 
34. 
The  minimum  value  per  withdrawal  application  is  $100,000  equivalent.  Individual 
payments  below  this  amount  should  generally  be  paid  from  the  imprest  account  or  by  the 
executing  agency  (or  the  implementing  agency)  and  subsequently  claimed  to  ADB  through 
reimbursement,  unless  otherwise  accepted  by  ADB. 
35. 
For loan amount used by the government directly, direct payment, reimbursement, and 
imprest fund procedures may be used to withdraw funds from the loan account. To expedite the 
flow of funds and simplify document processing, the statement of expenditures (SOE) procedure 
may  be  used  to  reimburse,  replenish,  and  liquidate  eligible  expenditures  for  any  individual 
payment  not  exceeding $200,000 equivalent for project  activities other  than  those financed  by 
subloans.  SOE  records should be  maintained  and  made readily  available for  review  by  ADB’s 
13  http://www.adb.org/documents/loan-disbursement-handbook 
14  The bank charges in the operation of the imprest account may be financed from the loan proceeds. 
27 
disbursement  and  review  mission,  or  upon  ADB’s  request  for  submission  of  supporting 
documents on a sampling basis and for independent audit.15 Before the submission of the first 
withdrawal  application,  GPG  should  submit  to  ADB  sufficient  evidence  of  the  authority  of  the 
person(s) who will sign the withdrawal applications on behalf of the borrower, together with the 
authenticated specimen signatures of each authorized person. 
36. 
For  the  ADB  loan  proceeds  that  will  be  onlent  via  FIs,  the  withdrawal  application  will 
follow  the  procedures  for  financial  intermediation  loans  as  specified  in  section  11  of  the  Loan 
Disbursement  Handbook.16 The  basis  of  disbursement  will  be  the  signed  subloan  agreement. 
The  SOE  procedure  will  be  used  in  view  of  the  anticipated  voluminous  documentation  for 
numerous  and  small  amounts  of  individual  payments  for  subloans.  The  SOE  ceilings  for  the 
non-submission  of  full  supporting  documentation  are  the  free  limits  agreed  for  the  FIL.17 The 
withdrawal application should include a statement from the PPMO that all listed subloans satisfy 
the  terms  and  conditions  specified  in  the  relending  agreements  between  the  government  and 
FIs. 
For  subloans  for  retroactive  financing,  subloans  above  the  free  limit,  and  the  first 
37. 
subloan  in  each  county,  subloan  proposals  need  to  be  submitted  by  the  FIs,  through  PMO  to 
ADB  for  prior  review  and  approval.  This  enables  ADB  to  satisfy  itself  on  the  quality  of  the  FIs’ 
appraisal of projects and advise on appraisal techniques and methodology. 
38. 
Except as ADB and GPG otherwise agree, the Relending Agreement will provide for the 
FIs  to  relend  the  loan  proceeds  on  repayment  by  sub-borrowers  on  the  following  terms  (all 
terms as defined in the Loan Agreement):  
(i) 
(ii) 
At  all  times,  each  FI  should  endeavor  to  have  a  percentage,  as  agreed  between 
ADB,  GPG,  and  FI,  of  the  amount  it  has  borrowed  under  its  relending  agreement 
outstanding in subloans to qualified sub-borrowers for qualified subprojects; 
Each FI will report to the PMO the outstanding amount of its subloans as of the last 
date  of  each  calendar  quarter  and  the  PMO  shall  report  this  information  to  ADB  in 
each semiannual project progress report; and 
(iii)  Where  an  FI  has failed to meet  the  percentage  target for  two  consecutive calendar 
quarters  it  will  immediately  repay  to  GPG  the  difference  between  the  target  above 
and the average actual outstanding amount at the end of such two quarters. 
39.  Where repayments are made to GPG as provided above, GPG will report that to ADB, 
and ADB and GPG will discuss how best to immediately commence using such repaid amounts 
for project purposes.        
ii. 
Disbursement Arrangements for Counterpart Fund 
40. 
For  counterpart  funds  of  FIs  for  outputs  1  and  2,  FIs  will  use  their  own  resources  to 
make subloans, applying the same requirements, except for the interest cap and eligibility. The 
15  Checklist  for  SOE  procedures  available  in    Chapter    9    and    formats    in    Appendix    9B    of    the    Loan 
(http://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/institutional-document/33606/files/loan- 
Handbook 
Disbursement 
disbursement-handbook.pdf) 
16  Section 11: Financial Intermediation Loans and Policy-Based Loans, para. 11. 11.1-11.9 of the Loan Disbursement 
Handbook. SOE form for FIL loans is available in Appendix 9C of the handbook. 
17  Free limits are defined as (i) in the case of enterprises and cooperatives, the CNY equivalent (at the time of making 
the subloan) of US$1,000,000 (one million USD) and, (ii) in the case of farm households, the CNY equivalent (at 
the time of making the subloan) of US$100,000 (one hundred thousand USD). 
28 
contract  awards  and  disbursement  plan  should  include  the  subloans  to  be  made  with  FIs’  own 
funding. For each calendar year, FIs need to provide detailed information on these subloans for 
government  and  ADB’s review.  ADB  will continue to disburse for the  subloans  under outputs 1 
and  2  in  the  next  year  only  if  evidence  shows  that  sufficient  counterpart  funds  have  been 
provided by FIs in the past year. For subloans to the RFSPs, ADB will disburse 65% of the total 
subloan  amount  and  FIs  finance  the  remaining  35%.  FIs  will  also  use  their  own  resources  to 
establish grassroots  financial  services  units,  pilot  innovative financial  services  or  products,  and 
conduct capacity building for loan officers of FIs and RFSPs. The information on these activities 
and expenditure should be reported to the government and ADB timely.  
41. 
Subproject  beneficiaries  will  be  required  to  provide  counterpart  funds  in  equity  when 
they  receive  subloans  from  FIs.  The  government  is  responsible  for  providing  government 
counterpart  funds  timely  from  their  fiscal  budgetary  sources  and  uses  the  funds  following 
domestic regulation and requirements on use and management of public funds. 
C. 
Accounting 
42. 
The  GPG  will  maintain,  or  cause  to  be  maintained,  separate  books  and  records  by 
funding  source  for  all  expenditures  incurred  on  the  project.  Consolidated  project  financial 
statements  will  be  prepared  annually  in  accordance  with  the  government’s  accounting  laws 
and  regulations,  which are consistent with international accounting principles and practices.18
43. 
Each  FI  bank  will  maintain  and  cause  any  RFSPs  that  they  onlend  to  maintain  a 
separate  ledger  account  that  tracks  the  receipt  and  use  of  the  ADB  loan  proceeds,  as  well  as 
interest payments and principal repayments from the sub-borrowers.   
44. 
The project financial statements also include a statement of subloans which indicate: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
 (v) 
(vi) 
the opening balance; 
the name of financial intermediaries; 
details of subloans (committed lines of credit and amounts disbursed); 
closing balance (gross and net amounts); 
comparative figures for prior year; and 
cumulative amount to date (gross). 
45. 
The  statement  will  be  also  accompanied  by  adequate  explanatory  notes.  These  notes 
include the basis of preparation, reporting currency, undrawn external assistance, and details of 
subloans such as amounts committed, disbursed up to the previous year, disbursed during the 
current  reporting  period,  cumulative  disbursement,  undisbursed  commitments,  percentage  of 
loan utilized, etc. The formats of project financial statements are provided in Appendix 3. 
D. 
Auditing and Public Disclosure 
46. 
The  GPG  will  cause  the  detailed  consolidated  project  financial  statements  to  be 
audited  in  accordance  with  International  Standards  on  Auditing  and  the  Government  Auditing 
Standards  of the PRC (where these are consistent with International Standards on Auditing), by 
an  auditor  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  audited  project  financial  statement  will  be  submitted  in 
the  English  language to ADB within 6 months of the end of the financial year by the executing 
18 Applicable  laws,  regulations,  and  guidelines  include:  (i)  The  Accounting  Law  of  the  PRC  (2000),  (ii)  State-owned 
Construction Enterprise Accounting Control Regulations, (iii) Capital Construction Financial Control Regulations, and 
(iv) Accounting Methods for Projects Financed by the World Bank. 
29 
agency.  
The  annual  audit  report  for  the  project  will  include  an  audit  management  letter, 19 
47. 
and  auditor’s  opinions  which  cover  (i)  whether  the  project  financial  statements  present  a  true 
and fair  view  or  are presented fairly,  in  all material respects,  in  accordance  with  the  applicable 
financial  reporting  framework;  (ii)  whether  loan  proceeds  were  used  only  for  the  purposes  of 
the project or not; (iii) the level of compliance for each financial covenant contained in the legal 
agreements  for  the  project;  (iv)  use  of  the  imprest  fund  procedure;  and  (v)  use  of  the  SOE 
procedure certifying to the eligibility of those expenditures claimed under SOE procedures, and 
proper  use  of  the  SOE  and  imprest  procedures  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  Loan  Disbursement 
Handbook and the project documents. 
48. 
The GPG shall ensure that each FI shall (i) prepare entity annual financial statements 
in accordance with accounting principles acceptable to ADB; (ii) have such financial statements 
audited  by  independent  auditors  whose  qualifications,  experience  and  terms  of  reference  are 
acceptable  to  ADB,  in  accordance  with  international  standards  for  auditing  or  the  national 
equivalent acceptable to ADB; (iii) as part of each such audit, have the auditors prepare a report 
(which includes the  auditors’ opinion  on the financial  statements);  (iv) furnish to ADB,  no  later 
than  6  months  after  the  close  of  the  fiscal  year  to  which  they  relate,  copies  of  such  audited 
financial  statements,  and  audit  report,  all  in  the  English  language,  and  such  other  information 
concerning  these documents  and the  audit  thereof  as ADB  shall from  time to  time reasonably 
request. 
49. 
Compliance  with  financial  reporting  and  auditing  requirements  will  be  monitored  by 
review  missions  and  during  normal  program  supervision,  and  followed  up  regularly  with  all 
concerned, including the external auditor. 
50. 
The  government  has  been  made  aware  of  ADB’s  policy  on  delayed  submission,  and 
the  requirements  for  satisfactory  and  acceptable  quality  of  the  audited  project  financial 
statements.  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  require  a  change  in  the  auditor  (in  a  manner 
consistent  with  the  constitution of the borrower), or for additional support to be provided to the 
auditor,  if  the  audits  required  are  not  conducted  in  a  manner  satisfactory  to  ADB,  or  if  the 
audits  are  substantially  delayed.  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  verify  the  project's  financial 
accounts  to  confirm  that  the  share  of  ADB’s  financing  is  used  in  accordance  with  ADB’s 
policies and procedures. 
51. 
Public  disclosure  of  the  project  financial  statements,  including  the  audit  report  on 
the  project  financial  statements,  will  be  guided  by  ADB’s  Public  Communications  Policy 
(2011).20 
52. 
After  review,  ADB  will  disclose  the  financial  statements  for  the  project  and  the 
opinion  of  the  auditors  on  the  financial  statements  within  30  days  of  the  date  of  their  receipt 
by posting them  on ADB’s website. The Audit Management Letter will not be disclosed. 
19  A management letter means formal communications from the auditor to the client management in accordance with 
the  International  Standard  on  Auditing  265  (communicating  deficiencies  in  internal  control  to  those  charged  with 
governance  and  management),  which  is  not  required  to  be  provided  separately  as  it  is  equivalent  to  the  Audit 
Findings and Recommendations prepared by the project auditor and submitted to ADB.

PROCUREMENT AND CONSULTING SERVICES 
A. 
Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing 
GPG and FIs have requested for advance contracting and retroactive financing to enable 
53. 
early commencement of procurement of goods and training by the government and issuance of 
subloans by FIs. The details of activities to be financed and their justification will be set out in a 
written  request  to  ADB.  The  executing  and  implementing  agencies  have  been  advised  that  (i) 
approval of advance contracting and retroactive financing does not commit ADB to financing the 
project,  and  (ii)  retroactive  financing  may  only  apply  up  to  20%  of  the  amount  of  ADB  loan  in 
respect  for  expenditures  incurred  before  loan  effectiveness,  but  not  earlier  than  12  months 
before the date of the loan agreement. All advance contracting and retroactive financing will be 
undertaken in conformity with ADB’s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to 
time) 21  and  ADB’s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to 
time). 22  The 
for  bids,  bidding  documents,  bid  evaluations, 
recommendation  of  contract  awards,  and  subloan  contracts  under  advance  contracting  and 
retroactive financing will  be subject to ADB approval. ESMS should be established by FIs and 
approved  by  ADB  before  FIs  start  to  review  subloan  applications.  Disbursement  for  the 
retroactive  financing  can  be  paid  through  the  imprest  account  in  accordance  with  ADB’s 
disbursement guidelines.

Procurement of Goods, Works and Consulting Services 
54. 
All  procurement  fully  or  partly  financed  out  of  the  loan  proceeds  will  be  undertaken  in 
accordance  with  ADB’s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  For 
subloans  through  FIs  and  RFSPs,  the  procurement  will  be  undertaken  by  the  respective  sub-
borrowers  in  accordance  with  established  private  sector  or  commercial  practices,  which  are 
acceptable  to  ADB.  The  GPG  will,  through  the  relending  agreement,  ensure  that  the  sub-
borrowers use procurement practices acceptable to ADB. Sub-borrowers will be encouraged to 
procure through competitive bidding or shopping when such procurements are most appropriate 
in the interest of economy and efficiency.  
The  Government  will  use  a  portion  of  loan  funds  (below  $1  million  equivalent)  for 
55. 
procurement  of  small  contracts  below  $100,000  equivalent  for  office  equipment  and  furniture 
under ADB's shopping procedures. 
A  procurement  plan  of  18  months,  indicating  contract  value,  procurement  method, 
56. 
threshold and review procedures, goods, works, and consulting services contract packages, and 
national competitive bidding guidelines, is in subsection C.  
All 28 person-months consulting services required for the project will be financed by the

SAFEGUARDS 
A. 
Environment and Social Management System 
The  project  is  classified  as  financial  intermediary  (FI)  for  safeguards.  A  template 
60. 
environmental  and  social  management  system  (ESMS)  has  been  prepared  following  ADB’s 
Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) (SPS) and with the involvement of the three project FIs and 
PPMO.  This  describes  the  roles  and  responsibilities  of  the  FIs  and  PMOs,  procedures  for 
screening, improving, categorization, assessment, monitoring and reporting, and integration with 
FI  business  procedures.  All  project  FIs  and  RFSPs  will  establish  and  implement  an  ESMS, 
which  is  based  on  the  template  and  is  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  ESMSs  for  the  RFSPs  will  be 
appropriately  simplified  to  reflect  the  smaller  subloans  they  will  make.  All  subprojects  to  be 
supported by onlending from FIs and RFSPs will be subject to the procedures described in the 
template  ESMS.  The  FIs  will  be  responsible  for  implementing,  and  requiring  RFSPs  to 
implement, the ESMSs. Each FI will have an ESMS established and operational, at least three 
months before disbursement from government to the FIs. The PPMO will provide oversight and 
coordination with the FIs and other stakeholders, and recruit project implementation consultants 
to  provide  assistance  and  training  to  FI  staff  for  ESMS  implementation,  and  ensure  that  key 
agencies possess a copy of the ESMS and understand their roles and responsibilities.  
B. 
Environment 
61. 
The  project  will  encourage  and  favor  loans  which  promote  agricultural  innovation, 
efficiency,  and  the  sustainable  use  of  natural  resources,  especially  water,  soil,  and  energy. 
Agricultural  and  environmental  issues  in  the  project  area  include  inefficient  and/or  outdated 
farming technology, limited water resources, severe drought, and excessive use of agricultural 
chemicals  and  plastic  mulch.  Project  funds  will  support  a  range  of  agricultural  activities, 
including cash crops, fruit trees, and greenhouse and livestock production. These may result in 
impacts  to  surface  water,  groundwater,  soil,  air  quality,  noise  levels,  ecology,  communities, 
physical  cultural  resources,  and  land  use  rights  transfer.  The  identification,  screening,  and 
management of such impacts are key objectives of the ESMS. 
ESMS implementation. ESMS implementation comprises six steps, to be conducted for 
62. 
each 
loan  application:  A–screening,  B–improving,  C–categorization,  D–assessment,  E–
safeguard  implementation,  and  F–monitoring and  reporting.  Steps  A  to  D  are to  be  conducted 
as  part  of  the  due  diligence  before  a  subloan  is  approved.  Steps  E  to  F  are  to  be  conducted 
during  implementation  of  a  subproject.  All  steps  are  to  be  conducted  by  the  FI  or  RFSP  loan 
officers  and,  working  with  the  sub-borrower,  with  the  assistance  of  the  PPMO  and  CPMOs 
environment  and  social  officers,  and  loan  implementation  consultants.  Information  disclosure, 
public  consultation,  and  the  participation  of  communities  which  may  be  impacted  by  a 
subproject, are a key requirement under PRC laws and the ADB SPS. Steps A to F need to be 
integrated into the business procedures of each FI or RFSP.  
C. 
Involuntary Resettlement 
63. 
The project is classified as category FI treated as C in terms of involuntary resettlement. 
FIs  will  not  finance  any  subproject  that  will  involve  physical  displacement  or  involuntary 
resettlement.  FIs  will  utilize  Worksheet  2  in  the  ESMS  to  screen  out  any  subprojects  with 
potential involuntary resettlement issues.  
34 
D. 
Land Use Rights Transfer Agreements 
64. 
 Many of the subprojects that are on the government’s initial list of proposed subprojects 
involve pre-existing or new land use rights transfer agreements which involve large amounts of 
land  and  impact  many  households.23 For  existing  land  use  rights  transfer  agreements,  a  due 
diligence  report  has  been  prepared  and  it  concluded  that  (i)  all  the  land  use  rights  transfer 
agreements were in accordance with national, provincial, and local policies and regulations; (ii) 
the  land  use  rights  transfer  rents  were  paid  timely;  (iii)  livelihoods  of  households  who  had 
transferred land were not negatively affected; and (iv) all  households who transferred land are 
satisfied  with  the  land  use  rights  transfer  procedures,  contract  conclusion,  and  compensation 
payments. 
To  guide  the  land  use  rights  transfer  agreements  during  the  implementation  of  the 
65. 
project, a Land Use Rights Transfer Framework (LURTF) has been prepared (Appendix 6 of the 
ESMS).  The  policy  framework  of  the  LURTF  incorporated  current  PRC  and  Gansu  provincial 
and  local  polices,  ADB’s  SPS  requirement  for  negotiated  settlement,  as  well  as  the  best 
practices in the project area as concluded in the due diligence report.24 
66. 
The staff of FIs and the social safeguards officers of PPMO and CPMOs will ensure that 
(i)  new  LURT  agreements  will  follow  the  LURTF;  and  (ii)  all  LURT  agreements  will  be  well 
documented  and  reported.  The  loan  implementation  consultant  will  help  PPMO  and  FIs  end-
borrowers to develop an appropriate annual documentation and reporting mechanism to the FIs, 
PPMO, and ADB. Subproject with potential LURT issues will need to be monitored more closely. 
E. 
Ethnic Minorities25 
67. 
The  project  will  target  Han  as  well  as  ethnic  minorities  (EM)  in  the  project  counties. 
Specifically, the project will target three distinct EM groups of Dongxiang, Bao’an, and Salar in 
Hezheng  County  and  Jishishan  Autonomous  County.26   The  project  will  also  target  many  Hui 
people.  This  is  consistent  with  ADB’s  policy  for  social  inclusive  development.  The  Dongxiang 
and  Bao’an  are  unique  and  only  exist  in  Gansu;  while  the  Bao’an  and  Salar  are  small  EMs 
eligible  for  special  central  government  policy  assistances.27 The  Hui  have  economic  systems 
similar to the Han, but they have different religious and social customs and in some areas may 
be  poor.  Consequently,  a  project  level  ethnic  minority  development  plan  (EMDP)  has  been 
prepared  for  strengthening  the  project’s  positive  effects  and  for  mitigating  any  likely  negative 
impacts  on  these  three  distinct  EM  groups  in  Hezheng  and  Jishishan  counties.  PPMO  and 
CPMOs,  with  support  from  the  county  governments,  will  be  responsible  for  implementing  the 
project  level  EMDP  actions.  The  social  safeguards  officer  of  PPMO  will  be  responsible  for 
internal monitoring of the EMDP implementation, with the assistance of the loan implementation 
social  consultant (LISC),  and will  submit  a consolidated  social  monitoring  report to ADB  semi-
annually. 
23  It is farmland use right leasing without change of ownership and agricultural usage. 
24 There are (i) mutual consultation and negotiated settlements between land use rights transferor and transferee; (ii) 
land use rights transfer duration of 5-10 years; (iii) land use rights transfer rates were equivalent to output values of 
grains; and (iv) endorsement of land use rights transfer contract by a third party. 
25  Ethnic minority groups are covered by ADB’s indigenous peoples’ policy requirements. 
26  Full name is Jishishan Bao’an, Dongxiang and Salar Ethnic Minority Autonomous County. 
27  An  ethnic  minority  with  population  below  0.3  million  by  2010  is  defined  as  small  EM  group,  enjoying  special 
assistance by the outline of supporting small EM development.  
  http://www.seac.gov.cn/art/2011/7/1/art_149_129390.html. 
35 
 For the FI subprojects, FIs will need to screen loan proposals for potential EM impacts 
68. 
(see Worksheet 4 in the ESMS). Subprojects will be categorized as A, B, or C. The category A 
subprojects will be excluded or redesigned; category B subprojects will require the end-borrower 
to  prepare  an  EMDP  in  accordance  with  the  Ethnic  Minority  Development  Framework  in 
Appendix  7  of  the  ESMS;  and  category  C  requires  no  ethnic  minority  specific  actions  but 
measures  in  the  social  and gender  action  plan  (SGAP)  (see  Appendix  8  in  the  ESMS)  will  be 
applied  and  monitored.  Some  subprojects  that  require  no  specific  ethnic  minority  actions  may 
still  require  monitoring  of  results.  The  end-borrowers  will  be  responsible  for  implementing  the 
actions set out in the subproject EMDP and SGAP, and for semi-annual reporting to the FIs and 
PPMO.  Should  unanticipated  impacts  be  identified  (e.g.,  during  monitoring  or  through  the 
grievance redress mechanisms), the relevant BAAH will either the resolve the issue directly or 
agree  on  correction  actions  with  the  relevant  enterprise  or  cooperative.  Further  follow-up  and 
monitoring will be carried to ensure the issue has been adequately resolved. 
F. 
Capacity Development and Training 
The  PPMO  will  assist  the  FIs  and  RFSPs  to  establish  and  implement  their  ESMSs. 
69. 
Assistance  will  be  provided  through  the  PPMO  environmental  and  social  officers  and  loan 
implementation environment consultant (LIEC) and LISC (see terms of reference in Appendix 5 
of the ESMS). Most of the hands-on support from the PPMO will be provided in the first two and 
a half years of the project. The roles of the LIEC and LISC are especially important in the first 
year  of  project  implementation,  since  the  FIs  do  not  have  technically-qualified  environmental 
and  social  staff  at  this  stage.  It  is  anticipated  that  from  year  two  onward,  as  support  from  the 
PPMO is reduced, such staff will be in place at the FIs to operate the ESMS. As FI capacity is 
strengthened,  and  the  ESMS  becomes  firmly  integrated  into  business  procedures,  the  FIs  will 
play a larger role to support the RFSPs implement the ESMS. 
70. 
The  current  capacity  of the  FIs for  environmental  and  social  safeguard management  is 
inadequate.  The  project  includes  a  training  program  to  strengthen  FI  capacity,  and  includes 
principles and practice of environmental and social impact assessment in the agriculture sector, 
ESMS implementation, and the efficient use of natural resources.   
G. 
Grievance redress mechanisms  
71. 
The  project  includes  grievance  redress  mechanisms  (GRM)  to  identify,  address,  and 
resolve any public concerns for safeguard issues of the project activities. The GRMs need to be 
separate  to  address  different  types  of  issues,  e.g.  environment  versus  social.  The  GRMs 
comprise  a  series  of  steps  to  receive,  document,  and  address  the  concerns  of  any  affected 
persons.  The  GRMs  will  be  made  accessible  to  all  members  of  the  community.  Multiple  entry 
points  will  be  made  available,  including  face-to-face  meetings,  written  complaints,  telephone 
conversations,  e-mail,  and  social  media  (see  Section  IV  in  the  ESMS).  The  GRMs  will  be 
implemented by the PPMO and CPMOs, with the support of the BAAHs, FIs, and RFSPs. 
H. 
Monitoring and Reporting 
72. 
Each  FI  will  develop  and  maintain  internal  monitoring  systems  to  record  the  safeguard 
procedures undertaken for each subloan application. The reporting procedure is as follows: (1) 
semi-annual ESMS reports covering SGAP implementation (related to FI responsibilities) will be 
provided  by  the  FIs  to  the  CPMOs;  (2)  the  CPMOs  will  provide  semi-annual  Safeguard 
Monitoring Reports, covering the ESMS, GRMs, SGAP (related to government responsibilities), 
training, and other safeguard-related issues, to the PPMO for review and consolidation. These 
36 
reports  will  include  the  results  of  the  FI  semi-annual  ESMS  reports.  The  PPMO  will  guide  the 
CPMOs  in  preparing  county-level  Safeguard  Monitoring  Reports  and  consolidate  them  into 
project-level Safeguard Monitoring Reports with support of LIEC and LISC; and (3) the PPMO 
will submit semi-annual project Safeguard Monitoring Reports to ADB for review and disclosure. 
ADB will check and verify all the safeguard documents periodically, such as ESMS worksheets, 
and  may  request  additional  supporting  information.  See  Step  F  in  Section  III  of  the  ESMS  for 
further details.  
37 
VIII.  GENDER AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS 
73. 
A  social,  poverty,  and  gender  analysis  was  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB’s 
policies on Gender and Development in ADB Operations (Operations Manual Section C2), and 
Incorporation of Social Dimensions into ADB Operations (Operations Manual Section C3). The 
analysis  collected  information  to  assist  in  the  design  of  the  project  by  identifying  the  poor, 
examining causes of poverty, and recommending poverty reduction measures within the project 
scope. 
74. 
Social  and  poverty  dimensions.  The  project  will  implement  socially  inclusive 
interventions  and  will  target  benefits  to  EM  people,  women,  and  the  poor  to  the  extent 
possible.28 Of the total beneficiary households in the government’s initially proposed subprojects, 
29.6% are poor, almost the same as the overall poverty incidence of 30.4% of the project area 
in 2012.29  
75. 
Gender  dimension. Of the 122,000 beneficiaries in the government’s initially proposed 
subprojects,  59,170  (48.5%)  are  women.  Women  will  benefit  more  from  the  project  as  more 
female  laborers  are  engaged  given  that  women  are  the  major  labor  force  for  agricultural 
production.30 The project is classified by ADB as effective gender mainstreaming and the SGAP 
was developed to enhance gender inclusive development. 
76. 
Social and gender action plan. The SGAP prepared for the project, shown in Table 1, 
will ensure that social and gender activities are implemented and monitored at regular intervals. 
The  purpose  of  the  SGAP  is  to  ensure  that  salient  social  and  gender  issues  are  addressed 
during the project implementation, and its implementation mitigates likely negative impacts and 
enhances project benefits for these vulnerable groups. The SGAP will ensure suitable avenues 
will  be  available  for  participation  of  all  beneficiaries  including  women  and  the  poor,  and  it 
includes  measures  for  maximizing  their  participation  in  local  decision-making.  The  SGAP  also 
provides details of the target indicators and responsibilities for implementation. 
77. 
Institutional  responsibilities.  PPMO  and  CPMOs,  with  support  from  the  county 
governments,  will  be  responsible  for  implementing  the  project  level  SGAP  actions.  The  end-
borrowers  and  BAAHs,  with  assistance  of  CPMOs  and  other  county  government  agencies, 
PPMO,  and  FIs,  will  implement  the  subproject  SGAP  actions.  The  social  safeguards  officer  of 
the PPMO will be responsible for overall SGAP monitoring and reporting to ADB. 
78.  Monitoring  and  Reporting.  FIs  will  monitor  SGAP  implementation  related  to  FI 
responsibilities  and  report  in  the  ESMS  reports.  CPMOs  will  monitor  SGAP  implementation 
related  to  government  responsibilities  and  report  in  the  Safeguard  Monitoring  Reports.  The 
PPMO  social  Safeguard  Monitoring  Officer  will 
the  SGAP 
implementation status in the semi-annual Safeguard Monitoring Reports and submit to ADB for 
review. The LISC will help the PPMO to develop monitoring and reporting mechanism in detail. 
review  and  consolidate 
28 The FIs and RFSPs will lend based on financial capacity for repayment. For this reason, some support actions will 
be implemented by local government through PPMO and CPMOs and some actions will be  implemented by end-
borrowers for FI subprojects. 
29 The rural poverty level is based on CNY 2,300 net income per capita per year. 
30 According to PPTA household surveys, 60.4% of female laborers are engaged in agriculture, while only 48.4% are 
male labourers.

A.  Monitoring  
Project  performance  monitoring.  The  PPMO  will  be  responsible  for  monitoring  and 
79. 
reporting  on  project  performance.  The  basis  for  project  performance  monitoring  and  reporting 
will  be  the  design  and  monitoring  framework,  which  identifies  performance  targets  for  the 
outcomes  and  outputs  of  the  project.  The  PPMO  will  establish  and  maintain  a  project 
performance monitoring system (PPMS), which will be designed to permit adequate flexibility to 
adopt remedial action regarding project design, schedules, activities, and development impacts. 
The PPMS will cover, but is not limited to, the following aspects of the project implementation: (i) 
project  physical  and  financial  progress,  (ii)  results  of  capacity  development  programs,  (iii) 
establishment  of  grassroots  financial  units  and  introduction  of  innovative  rural  financial 
services/products, (iv) detailed information on beneficiaries of the project, (v) implementation of 
EMDP  and  SGAP,  and  compliance  with  the  loan  and  project  covenants  (policy,  financial, 
43 
economic, sector, and others). The PPMO agreed and confirmed that they will (i) establish the 
PPMS  framework  at  the  start  of  project  implementation  (within  6  months  after  loan 
effectiveness),  (ii)  confirm  that  targets  are  achievable,  and  (iii)  develop  systematical  data 
generation and collection procedures or arrangements. 
80.  With inputs from the CPMOs, implementing agencies and other stakeholders, the PPMO 
will  collect  and  analyze  the  data,  and  prepare  project  progress  reports  semi-annually. 
Disaggregated  baseline  data  for  output  and  outcome  indicators  gathered  during  project 
preparation will be updated and reported in the semi-annual project progress reports and after 
each  ADB  review  mission.  They  will  provide  information  necessary  to  update  ADB's  project 
performance reporting system.31  
81. 
Safeguards and social dimensions monitoring are elaborated in sections VII and VIII. 
B.  Evaluation 
In  addition  to  regular  monitoring,  project  performance  will  be  reviewed  at  least  once  a 
82. 
year  jointly  by  ADB  and  GPG.  The  review  will  assess  implementation  performance  and 
achievement  of  project  outcomes  and  outputs,  assess  financial  progress,  identify  issues  and 
constraints affecting implementation, and work out a time-bound action plan for their resolution. 
ADB  will  undertake  annual  project  reviews  during  the  project  period.  Within  the  third  year  of 
project implementation, ADB and GPG will undertake a midterm review of the project, covering 
all 
technical,  environmental,  social,  poverty 
reduction,  economic,  financial,  procurement,  and  other  relevant  aspects  that  may  have  an 
impact  on  the  performance  of  the  project  and  its  continuing  viability.  Within  6  months  of 
completion of the project (i.e. end of the loan implementation period), GPG will submit a project 
completion report to ADB.32

D.  Stakeholder Communication Strategy  
84. 
Project  information  will  be  communicated  through  public  consultation,  information 
disclosure  mechanism  in  ADB’s  and  government’s  website,  meetings,  interviews,  focus  group 
in 
discussions,  community  consultation  meetings,  and  capacity  development 
accordance with ADB’s requirements of information disclosure policy. The farmers, RFSPs, and 
ASMEs  participating  in  the  project  will  be  informed  culturally  appropriate  and gender-sensitive 
about the project benefits and potential project risks prior to the start of project activities. In the 
consultative  meetings,  participants—including  male,  female,  and  the  poor  and  vulnerable 
residents,  and  other  significant  stakeholders—will  be  consulted  about  concerns  or  complaints 
raising mechanisms, information needs, and further consultation expectations.  
training, 
FIs,  RFSPs,  and  ASMEs  will  also  help  convey  opinions  and  advise  from  the  subloans 
85. 
through the implementation and monitoring of ESMS.  
45 
X. 
ANTICORRUPTION POLICY  
86. 
ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any violations of the 
Anticorruption  Policy  relating  to  the  project. 33  All  contracts  financed  by  ADB  shall  include 
provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the 
executing agency and all Project contractors, suppliers, consultants and other service providers. 
Individuals/entities  on  ADB’s  anticorruption  debarment  list  are  ineligible  to  participate  in  ADB-
financed activity and may not be awarded any contracts under the project.34  
87. 
To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  are  included  in  the  loan  and  project 
agreements and the bidding documents for the project. The project design and implementation 
arrangements provide for mitigating corruption risks. Risks associated with project management 
will  be  mitigated  by  (i)  training  of  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies’  staff  in  the 
procurement of civil works, goods, and services under the project; and (ii) periodic inspection of 
contractors’  activities  related  to  fund  withdrawals  and  settlements  by  the  executing  agency’s 
staff. 
88. 
Selection  of  consultants  fully  or  partly  financed  out  of  ADB  loan  proceeds  will  adopt 
ADB’s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time),  and 
disbursement  will  be  made  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  disbursement  policies,  guidelines, 
practices, and procedures.

XI. 
ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISM 
89. 
People  who  are,  or may  in the future  be,  adversely  affected  by the  project  may  submit 
complaints  to  ADB’s  Accountability  Mechanism.  The  Accountability  Mechanism  provides  an 
independent  forum  and  process  whereby  people  adversely  affected  by  ADB-assisted  projects 
can voice, and seek a resolution of their problems, as well as report alleged violations of ADB’s 
operational  policies  and  procedures.  Before  submitting  a  complaint  to  the  Accountability 
Mechanism, affected people should make a good faith effort to solve their problems by working 
with the concerned ADB operations department (in this case the ADB East Asia Department  – 
Environment, Natural Resources, and Agriculture Division). Only after doing that, and if they are 
still dissatisfied, should they approach the Accountability Mechanism.35

APPENDIX 1: SELECTION AND APPROVAL PROCEDURE FOR THE FIRST BATCH OF 
SUBLOANS UNDER OUTPUTS 1 AND 2 
For  the  first  batch  of  subloans  under  outputs  1 and  2,  the  government  will  prepare  and 
1. 
provide a long list of candidate subprojects for financial intermediaries (FIs) to consider. The FIs 
will  then  decide  which  subprojects  on  the  list  to finance  based  on  their  assessment  regarding 
sub-borrowers’  creditworthiness  and  compliance with  ADB  safeguards  requirements.  The  long 
list is a key vehicle used by the government to achieve sector project objectives as specified in 
the  design  and  monitoring  framework  through  the  first  batch  of  subloans.  The  long  list  will  be 
updated  regularly  within  the  loan  implementation  period  until  the  loan  proceeds  from  ADB  are 
fully disbursed. FIs may also identify subprojects which the government will review and include 
in the long list if they contribute to project goals. 
The  following  diagram  illustrates  how  the  first  batch  of  subloans  will  be  selected  and 
2. 
approved:  
County  BAAHs  and  sub-borrowers  develop  candidate 
subprojects  in  line  with  the  project  objectives  and  submit 
proposals to county PMOs.

49 
A  preliminary  long  list  of  subprojects  has  been  identified  by  the  government,  which 
3.  
consists  of  145  production  base  subprojects for  output  1  and 151 farmer  cooperatives  and 66 
ASMEs  as  potential  sub-borrowers  for  output  2.  The  following  conditions  were  taken  into 
consideration in making the preliminary list: (i) willingness to develop the production bases that 
produce  locally  featured  cash  crops,  tree  crops  or  livestock;  (ii)  engaged  in  business  on  the 
development of locally featured agriculture and playing a leading role on production, processing 
or  market  development;  (iii)  capacity  and  potentials  for  demonstrating  advanced  technologies 
and  bringing  along  agricultural  development  of  local  farmers;  (iv)  strong  demand  for  business 
expansion  and  lack  of  capital  inputs;  and  (v)  capacity  on  financial  management  and  self-
governance. These candidate subprojects will be provided to the FIs for assessment when the 
project commences.

APPENDIX 2: ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA 
1. 
Eligibility criteria of rural financial service providers (RFSPs): A portion of loan funds 
are  intended  to  be  onlent  by  the  financial  intermediary  banks  through  wholesale  lending 
structures  to  eligible  rural  financial  service  providers  (RFSPs),  such  as  village  and  township 
banks (VTBs), microcredit companies (MCCs), and rural mutual cooperatives (RMCs). Eligibility 
requirements  of  RFSPs  include  a  clearly  stated  commitment  to  the  rural  financial  service 
business  and  an  institutional  culture,  structure,  capability,  operating  system,  and  financial 
position  that  can  support  the  sustained  delivery  of  rural  financial  services  to  farmers,  farmer 
cooperatives, and agricultural small and medium enterprises (ASMEs) in the project areas. The 
basic  principles  for  selecting  eligible  RFSPs  include  (i)  RFSPs  must  have  a  local  presence  in 
the  project  county  with  a  commitment  to  provide  financial  services  to  farmers,  farmer 
cooperatives  and  ASMEs;  (ii)  RFSPs  are  financially  sound  with  acceptable  credit  and  risk 
management  systems  and  procedures;  and  (iii)  RFSPs  have  commitment  to  develop  and 
adhere  to  basic  ESMS  requirements  in  accordance  with  Asian  Development  Bank’s  (ADB’s) 
Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). The specific eligibility criteria of RFSPs would also include:  
Legally registered within the project counties;  
(i) 
(ii)  A stated commitment to cooperate with executing agency, implementing agencies, 
provincial  project  management  office,  and  county  project  management  offices  to 
achieve the project objectives;  
(iii)  More than one year operating history, no violation of regulatory requirements, and 
no noted financial irregularities in the past year;  
(iv)  For  VTBs,  they  must  have  a  non-performing  loan  ratio  not  more  than  4%,  and  a 
“Shenong”1 loan ratio not less than 50%;  
(v)  For  RMCs,  they  must  have  a non-performing  loan  ratio  not more  than 5%,  and  a 
“Shenong” loan ratio not less than 60%; and 
(vi)  For  MCCs,  they  must  have  a  non-performing  loan  ratio  not more  than 8%,  and  a 
“Shenong” loan ratio not less than 30%.  
2. 
Guiding eligibility criteria of sub-borrowers for Output 3: Sub-borrowers for output 3 
will take subloans from the RFSPs participating in the project. These  sub-borrowers in general 
are a broad group, and their needs for credit are more diverse qualitatively and quantitatively. In 
many cases, the sub-borrowers would take the loans in a shorter term due to the high available 
interest rate, which could be up to four times of the benchmark rate determined by the People’s 
Republic of China. Actual eligibility criteria for these sub-borrowers could be specified by each 
RFSP  based  on  their  understanding  of  their  existing  and  potential  clients  following  guiding 
criteria which include:  
(i)  Capacity and commitment in carrying out commercially profitable activities related 
to  agriculture  and  livestock  production,  agro-processing,  transportation,  and 
marketing;  
(ii)  Willingness  to  adopt  new  technologies  for  enhancing  business  in  a  commercially 
sustainable manner and to take part in associated training programs;  
(iii)  Meeting  environmental  and  social  management  system  (ESMS)  requirements  of 
the  RFSPs,  and  commitment 
to  adopt  environment-friendly  practices  and 
measures  in  the  activities  to  be  supported  including  use  of  fertilizer,  chemicals, 
1   “Shenong” refers to loans to farmers and agricultural activities and in rural areas, which are official defined by the 
People’s Bank of China. 
51 
(iv) 
integrated  pest  management  and  water  saving  technologies  that  meet  ESMS 
requirements; and 
Livestock  farmers  to  understand  and  meet  at  least  minimum  animal  welfare 
standards  with  respect  to  housing,  feeding,  health  requirements  and  general 
animal care and handling.  
3. 
Preference  would  go  to:  (i)  those  who  meet  all  other  criteria  and  who  are  willing  to  be 
become  “demonstration”  farms  for  the  training  and  sharing  of  information  with  other  farmers; 
and (ii) economically active  vulnerable groups such as the poor, women and ethnic minorities, 
for  the  development  of  sufficiently  profitable  income  generation  activities  through  the  use  of 
micro-credit in the project area.

sub-borrowers  to  finance  additional  subloans.  The  government  will  not  provide  long-list  of 
subprojects  or  sub-borrowers  for  these  subloans.  In  this  case,  the  selection  of  sub-borrowers 
will  be  guided  by  the  following  eligibility  criteria  as  well  as  FIs’  due  diligence  on  the  loan 
applicants.
