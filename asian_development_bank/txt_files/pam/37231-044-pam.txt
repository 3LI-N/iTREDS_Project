PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
In  December  2006,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  approved  a  $900  million1 
1. 
multitranche  financing  facility  (MFF)  for  the  Punjab  Irrigated  Agriculture  Investment  Program 
(PIAIP) to co-finance investments in the irrigation sector in Punjab. Two loans for the first project 
totaling $227.8 million were approved at the same time; $217.8 million equivalent from ordinary 
capital  resources  (OCR)  and  $10  million  equivalent  from  the  ADB’s  Special  Fund  (ADF) 
resources.  The  Project  1  (the  project)  included  Lower  Bari  Doab  Canal  Improvement  Project 
(LBDCIP) and Punjab Irrigated Agriculture Project Preparation Facility (PIAPPF), financed under 
MFF  tranche  1.  The  LBDCIP  is  improving  the  Balloki  Barrage  on  the  Ravi  River,  Lower  Bari 
Doab Canal (LBDC), and distributary and minor canals that supply water to more than 700,000 
ha  vis-à-vis  supporting  institutional  reforms,  on-farm  productivity  and  improved  groundwater 
management. The PIAPPF included preparation of subsequent projects under the MFF. 
2. 
The  Balloki  Barrage  (Barrage)  was  constructed  in  1911-13  to  create  a  level  crossing 
between  the  Upper  Chenab  Canal  and  the  Lower  Bari  Doab  Canal.  It  underwent  major 
remodeling  as  part  of  the  Indus  Basin  replacement  works  in  1964-65  to  increase  the  design 
flows into the LBDC and Balloki Sulemanki Link (B-S Link) as well as the capacity to pass flood 
flows.  The  Barrage  supplies  water  to  over  1.9  million  hectares.  The  Barrage  needs  major 
rehabilitation and upgrading for reducing flood and its failure risks. The project will increase the 
Barrage complex including its spillway flood capacity from 1 in 20 to 1 in 100 years.      
3. 
The LBDC was constructed during 1909-12. It has a total length of 201 km. It branches 
from the Ravi River at Balloki Barrage which is about 75 km south west of Lahore. It serves a 
gross area of 740,674 hectares and a cultivable command area of 675,667 hectares. Its current 
sanctioned discharge is 278 cumecs however the canal can only take 244 cumecs due to lesser 
capacity.  
A  project  entitled  Lower  Bari  Doab  Canal  Improvement  Project  (LBDCIP)  started  to 
4. 
efficiently irrigate the lands of Okara, Sahiwal, Kasur and Khanewal districts in the province of 
Punjab.  The  purpose  of  LBDCIP  project  is  the  provision  of  additional  canal  water  supplies, 
reducing  continued  degradation  of  the  LBDC,  limiting  groundwater  recharge,  decline  in 
watertable, increased pumping and loss of access to water in tail and saline-affected areas 
5. 
The  Project  nonphysical  components  includes  (i)  establishment  of  3,779  water  user 
associations, 52 farmer organizations (FOs) and one Area Water Board (AWB) completing the 
decentralized farmers’ management structures for operation, maintenance and management of 
the minor and distributary canals; (ii)  a groundwater modeling study and institutionalization of its 
recommendations within the PID; and (iii) on-farm demonstration plots with the FOs established.  
The  proposed  tranche  provides  additional  financing  to  meet  financing  gap  and  cost 
6. 
overruns  in  LBDCIP  through  OCR  loan  of  $26.6  million  for  completing  rehabilitation  and 
upgrade of Branch Canals and Distributary System of all four districts. The expenditure on these 
items must not change the project’s scope or its impact, outcomes, and outputs. 
1  This amount comprised (i) up to $890 million equivalent form ADB’s ordinary capital resources; and (ii) up to $10 
million equivalent in Special Drawing Rights (SDR) from ADB’s special funds resources (ADF). On 15 December 
2011,  ADB’s  Board of  Directors  approved  an  amendment  to  the  MFF  for  Punjab  Irrigated  Agriculture  Investment 
Program (PIAIP), which (i) reduced the facility amount to an amount not exceeding the equivalent of $700 million; 
and (ii) increased the limit on the use of ADF resources for the MFF to an amount not exceeding the equivalent of 
$280 million. 
2 
Impact and Outcome  
7. 
Impacts: The impact of the overall project  - increased agricultural production and farm 
income - will remain unchanged.2 The 10% increase in cropping intensity and farm income will 
be achieved by 2021 over the baseline of 2006.  
8. 
Outcome: The outcome of the project will remain the same, i.e. LBDC command area 
receives a sustainably improved delivery of water services and management through more than 
3,500  outlets  receiving  the  design  water  supply  and,  design  discharge  is  diverted  to  the 
distributary  and  minor  canals  throughout  the  year  by  2016.  The  additional  financing  will  not 
change the outcome or outcome indicators. 
Output: The  additional  finance  will  not  change the  result  chain of  outputs.  The  project 
9. 
outputs will be (i) operationalized groundwater management plan and conjunctive use strategy 
for  LBDC, (ii)  established  1  AWBs  and  52  FOs and more  than 3,000 water  user  associations, 
taking  over  the responsibility  for  operations  of  canal  system,  (iii)  rehabilitated  2,450 km  LBDC 
and  distribution  canals  in  LBDC  command  area,  and  increased  Balloki  Barrage’s  safe  flood 
capacity  from  6,400  m3s-1  to  10,700  m3s-1,  based  on  findings  of  the  detail  design  and  model 
studies,  (iv)  improved  use  of  on-farm  water  management  practices  by  farmers  through  40 
demonstration plots, and (iv) completed due diligence and approved subsequent tranches under 
MFF. The details are in the design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1).

FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT 
12. 
Financial  management  assessment  has  been  conducted  for  the  EA  and  IAs  of  the 
Punjab  Government  in  accordance  with  ADB’s  Guidelines  for  the  Financial  Management  and 
Analysis  of  Projects4  and  A  Methodology  Note  on  Financial  Due  Diligence5.  Key  findings  are 
given below.   
A. 
Financial Management Assessment 
13. 
Financial  Management  Assessment  is  based  on  ADB’s  experience  with  the  EA 
implementing  Loan  No.  2299-PAK  since  2007.  The  EA  has  considerable  experience  in 
implementing  ADB  Project  and  during  this  period  ADB  did  not  find  any  major  disbursement 
issues  under  the  loan.  In  order  to  have  an  updated  assessment,  a  Statement  of  Expenditure 
(SOE)  and  Financial  Management  Assessment  review  according  to  CTLA  guidelines  was 
conducted  in  September  2015.  Key  findings  are  given  in  the  table  below.  In  summary,  the 
maintenance of accounting records and financial reporting are adequate. No major audit issues 
were  noted  since  Loan  No.  2299-PAK  start-up.  The  only  significant  shortcoming  is  lack  of 
internal audit unit, the EA has assured to liaise with line department to operationalize an internal 
audit unit prior to project start-up. ADB will follow up to ensure that the internal audit unit is in 
place within the year.

satisfactory to ADB, or if the audit is substantially delayed.  ADB reserves the right to verify the 
project's financial accounts to confirm that the share of ADB’s financing is used in accordance 
with  ADB’s  policies  and  procedures.  Public  disclosure  of  the  project  financial  statements,

SAFEGUARDS 
31. 
The  EA  will  ensure  that  the  components  of  civil  works  financed  through  additional 
financing  continues  to  be  implemented  in  full  compliance  with  (i)  all  applicable  laws  and 
regulations  of  the  Government  of  Pakistan  and  the  Government  of  Punjab,  and  ADB‘s  SPS 
(2009),  including  the  policies  on  involuntary  resettlement,  indigenous  people  and  the 
environment; and (iii) respective resettlement plans, and environmental management plans. In 
the  event  that  there  is  a  discrepancy  between  the  laws  and  regulations  of  Punjab  and  ADB 
safeguard  policies,  the  ADB  safeguard  policies  will  prevail.  The  PID  prepared  the  updated 
resettlement  plan.  The  project  team  carried  out  social  and  environmental  due  diligence. 
Following sections provide details of safeguards related actions, which along with assurances in 
section VIII, will be incorporated into the related loan agreements. 
32. 
Punjab shall cause PID to ensure that no new activities or additional activities which will 
have environmental, indigenous peoples or involuntary resettlement impacts within the meaning 
of ADB’s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) are undertaken in connection with the Project. In 
the  event  that  any  such  activities  are  undertaken,  Punjab  shall  cause  PID  to  take  all  steps 
required  to  ensure  that  such  activities  comply  with  the  applicable  laws  and  regulations  of  the 
Borrower and with ADB’s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009).

33. 
Environment.  The  EA  will  continue  to  ensure  that  the  construction,  operation  and 
maintenance of the components of civil works financed through additional financing are carried 
out  in  accordance  with  ADB‘s  SPS  (2009).  The  EA  will  ensure  that  (i)  potential  adverse 
environmental impacts arising from the Project are minimized by implementing all mitigation and 
monitoring measures, as presented in the environment management plan (EMP) or site specific 
environment  management  plan  (SSEMP)  or  corrective  action  plans  (CAP);  (ii)  sufficient 
resources are available to implement and record the implementation of the EMPs, SSEMPs and 
CAPs; (iii)  bi-annual environmental reports are submitted within 1 month of the close of each 
half of the calendar year during the implementation of the project; and (iv) civil works contractors 
are  supervised  to  ensure  compliance  with  the  requirements  of  the  IEE  and  EMP.  The  overall 
responsibility  for  environmental  management  and  monitoring  will  rest  with  the  PMU  of  the  PID, 
which  is  already  established.  Within  the  PMU,  the  Directorate  of  Environment  and  Social 
Safeguards act as the Environmental Management Office. The environmental team of PMU will be 
responsible for the following: 
i. 
ii. 
iii. 
Ensuring that the EMPs are included in tender documents. 
Ensuring that all regulatory clearances are obtained before starting civil works for the 
subproject. 
Ensuring that the EMPs, including all proposed mitigation measures and monitoring 
programs are properly implemented. 
iv.  Undertaking  monitoring  of  subprojects  and  preparing  environmental  monitoring 
reports  every  six  months  (in  case  of  projects  with  long  duration)  and  post-project 
reports (for shorter projects), to be delivered to ADB.

34. 
Land  Acquisition  and  Resettlement,  and  Indigenous  Peoples.  Punjab  government 
will  ensure  that  land  acquisition  and  involuntary  resettlement  plans  are  updated  and/or 
implemented  in  accordance  with  SPS  (2009)  and  the  LARF.  Punjab  government  will  ensure 
that:  (i)  the  funds  to  pay  compensation  and  entitlements  under  the  resettlement  plan  are 
available in a timely manner and in accordance with the provisions of the resettlement plan; (ii) 
all  land  and  rights  of  way  required  are  made  available  in  a  timely  manner;  (iii)  contractors’ 
activities are in compliance with the requirements of the LARPs and EMPs; and (iv) internal and 
external monitoring continues on the project.  
35. 
The  overall  project  was  originally  classified  as  resettlement  category  A,  indigenous 
people category C and environmental category B. Since the additional financing is provided to 
cover  cost  overruns  and  financing  gaps  within  the  existing  project  scale  and  scope,  it  is 
classified  category  C  for  environment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous  people 
safeguards.  Under  Tranche  1,  all  nine  Resettlement  Plans  (RP)  were  updated,  approved  and 
disclosed,  of  which  six  are  completed  while  the  rest  are  at  various  stages  of  implementation. 
The  implementation  of  RPs  is  validated  through  external  monitoring  agency  and  PMU  will 
provide to ADB a monitoring report confirming the safeguards progress-implementation of RPs 
27 
and payments to APs. The safeguard requirements of the MFF are managed by an environment 
and  social  unit,  established  within  PMU  and  presently  staffed  with  environment,  community 
relations  and  social  safeguards  specialists  (one  each).  The  PID  will  fill  the  post  of  Director 
Environment and Social to strengthen ESU’s weak capacity in safeguards management.  
36. 
The  EA  will  continue  to  monitor  and  submit  the  quarterly  progress  and  completion 
reports  on  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  and  ensure  that  reports  are  simultaneously 
submitted to ADB. The PID will continue to submit the external monitoring reports to assess the 
implementation  processes  regarding  resettlement. The  PID  will  promptly  revise  the  LARP  and 
seek ADB approval in case of any change in the scope occurs. The Government will bear any 
increase in resettlement cost as a result of revisions in the LARP. In case of change, the PID 
will  ensure  that  (i)  displaced  persons  are  meaningfully  consulted  in  the  price  assessment 
process,  and  their  viewpoint  clearly  documented  in  the  LARP  together  with  the  steps/actions 
taken/proposed  to  ensure  payments  at  full  replacement  value.  The  PMU  will  manage  the 
resettlement  funds,  which  will  be  kept  in  a  bank  account  specifically  for  the  purpose  of 
disbursement of compensation to the displaced persons.  
VIII.  GENDER AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS 
37. 
Social and gender dimensions as detailed in the attached summary of social and poverty 
with  actions  completed  in  the  overall  project  which  includes,  (i)  conducting  consultations  with 
local women to identify their needs and concerns; (ii) gender orientation training for the staff of 
OFWM and PIDA staff; (iii) formation of more Rural Women Groups (RWGs); (iv) strengthening 
RWGs  through  systematic  mentoring  process  and  trainings;  (v)  conducting  coordination 
meetings with all the stakeholders, males and females alike, at provincial and district levels; (vi)  
conducting  additional  trainings  improving  specific  farm  and  livestock  management  skills  for 
women in various FOs/DCs. The remaining component of civil works associated with additional 
financing  does not  have specific gender  action other than  obligations of  the  contractors  in the 
contract, (i) to use their best efforts to employ women; and (ii) not to differentiate between men 
and women’s wages or benefits for work of equal value.

B.  Monitoring 
38. 
The  project  performance  management  system  (PPMS)  already  established  for  the 
LBDCIP  will  be  updated  after  approval  of  the  additional  financing.  The  PPMS  will  continue  to 
provide information on the project-specific requirements and updated in consultation with EA. A 
database  of  key  benchmark  indicators  is  used  by  the  PMU  and  forms  a  part  of  the  project 
monitoring  system  and  is  routinely  updated  and  monitored  bi-annually.  The  PID  is  also 
submitting  quarterly  progress  reports  (QPRs).  ADB  will  monitor  the  project  progress  and 
performance  through  the  QPRs  and  PPMS.  ADB  will  also  field  regular  review  missions,  bi-
annually, to monitor the progress. The QPRs information will be used to regularly update ADB's 
project performance reporting system.  
39. 
Compliance  monitoring.  The  loan  covenants  on  policy,  legal,  financial,  economic, 
environmental, labor standards and others will be monitored regularly through QPRs, bi-annual 
and annual reports and discussions during missions.  
40. 
Safeguard monitoring. The EA will integrate status of LARP and SSEMP in each QPR. 
QPRs, bi-annual internal and external monitoring reports and ADB review missions will provide 
comprehensive progress and status of the safeguards implementation.  
Gender and social dimension monitoring. EA’s QPR, PPMS (twice a year) and ADB’s 
41. 
review missions will monitor the implementation progress.

C.  Evaluation 
42. 
Review missions will be carried out on a semiannual basis jointly by representatives of 
ADB,  Borrower,  and  the  PID.  The  review  missions  will  assess  the  status  of  the  project 
implementation including procurement, civil works, and financing, compliance to environmental 
and social safeguards. The review will allow for any necessary midcourse corrections to ensure 
successful  implementation  and  the  achievement  of  the  project  objectives.  Within  6  months  of 
physical completion of the Project, the EA will submit a project completion report to ADB.14 
D.  Reporting  
43. 
The  PID  will  continue  to  provide  ADB  with  (i)  quarterly  progress  reports  in  approved 
format  consistent  with  ADB's  project  performance reporting  system;  (ii)  consolidated  bi-annual 
report  including  (a)  progress  achieved  by  output  as  measured  through  the  indicator's 
performance  targets,  (b)  key  implementation  issues  and  solutions;  (c)  updated  procurement 
plan  and  (d)  updated  implementation  plan  for  next  12  months;  and  (iii)  a  project  completion 
report within 6 months of physical completion of the Project. To ensure projects continue to be 
both viable and sustainable, project accounts and the executing agency AFSs, together with the 
associated auditor's report, should be adequately reviewed.

ANTICORRUPTION POLICY  
45. 
ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any violations of the 
Anticorruption  Policy  relating  to  the  Project.15  All  contracts  financed  by  ADB  shall  include 
provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the 
executing agency and all Project contractors, suppliers, consultants and other service providers. 
Individuals/entities  on  ADB’s  anticorruption  debarment  list  are  ineligible  to  participate  in  ADB-
financed activity and may not be awarded any contracts under the Project.16  
46. 
The  Government  will  comply  with,  and  will  ensure  that  the  PID  complies  with,  ADB‘s 
Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date).  The  Government,  consistent  with  its 
commitment to good governance, accountability and transparency, agrees (a) that ADB has the 
right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its  agents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive  or 
coercive practices relating to the Project; and (b) to cooperate fully with any such investigation 
and  to  extend  all  necessary  assistance,  including  providing  access  to  all  relevant  books  and 
records,  as  may  be  necessary  for  the  satisfactory  completion  of  any  such  investigation.  In 
addition,  the  Government  will  (a)  conduct  periodic  inspections  on  the  contractors‘  activities 
related  to  fund  withdrawals  and  settlements;  (b)  ensure  that  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in 
connection with the Project include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine 
the records and accounts of all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers 
as  they  relate  to  the  project;  and  (c)  ensure  that  the  construction  supervision  consultant  shall 
verify the contractors‘ invoices in accordance with working drawings and contract specifications.  
XI. 
ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISM 
47. 
People who are, or may in the future be, adversely affected by the project may submit 
complaints  to  ADB’s  Accountability  Mechanism.  The  Accountability  Mechanism  provides  an 
independent  forum  and  process  whereby  people  adversely  affected  by  ADB-assisted  projects 
can voice, and seek a resolution of their problems, as well as report alleged violations of ADB’s 
operational  policies  and  procedures.  Before  submitting  a  complaint  to  the  Accountability 
Mechanism, affected people should make a good faith effort to solve their problems by working 
with  the  concerned  ADB  operations  department.    Only  after  doing  that,  and  if  they  are  still 
dissatisfied, should they approach the Accountability Mechanism.17 
XII. 
RECORD OF PAM CHANGES  
48. 
All  revisions/updates  during  the  course  of  implementation  should  be  retained  in  this 
section to provide a chronological history of changes to implemented arrangements recorded in 
the PAM.
