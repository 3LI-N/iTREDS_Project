Project Administration Manual Purpose and Process 
The  project  administration  manual  (PAM)  describes  the  essential  administrative  and 
management requirements to implement the project on time, within budget, and in accordance 
with the policies and procedures of the government and the Asian Development Bank (ADB). 
The  PAM  should include  references to  all  available  templates and  instructions  either through 
linkages to relevant URLs or directly incorporated in the PAM. 
The Ministry of Food, Agriculture, and Light Industry (MOFALI) is the executing agency and the 
Crop  Production  Development  Policy  and  Coordination  Department  of  MOFALI  is  the 
implementing agency who are wholly responsible for the implementation of the ADB-financed 
projects, as agreed jointly between the borrower and ADB, and in accordance with the policies 
and  procedures  of  the  government  and  ADB.  The  ADB  staff  is  responsible  for  supporting 
implementation, including compliance by the executing agency and the implementing agency of 
their obligations and responsibilities for project implementation in accordance with ADB policies 
and procedures. 
At loan negotiations, the borrower and ADB shall agree  to the PAM; and ensure consistency 
with the loan and grant agreements. Such agreements shall be reflected in the minutes of the 
loan negotiations. In the event of any discrepancy or contradiction between the PAM and the 
loan,  project  and  grant  agreements,  the  provisions  of  the  loan  and  grant  agreements  shall 
prevail. 
After  ADB  Board  approval  of  the  project’s  report  and  recommendations  of  the  President, 
changes in implementation arrangements are subject to agreement and approval pursuant to 
relevant  government  and ADB  administrative  procedures  (including the  project  administration 
instructions) and upon such approval, they will be subsequently incorporated in the PAM. 
A. 
Rationale  
I. 
PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
The  Mongolian  agriculture  sector  has  high  potential  for  growth  and  livelihood 
1. 
opportunities.  In  line  with  the  Government  of  Mongolia’s  focus  to  accelerate  economic 
diversification and job creation, agriculture has fast become a priority for growth.1 Mongolia has 
made  strides  over  the  past  decade  to  become  self-sufficient  in  mechanized  cereal  and  potato 
production,  but  vegetable  farming  has  been  neglected  and  is  not  yet  very  productive.  This 
perpetuates low income for vegetable farmers and high reliance on imported products, which in 
turn  threatens  national  food  security.  On  average,  only  about  51%  of  the  country’s  annual 
vegetable  demand  is  met  by  domestic  production  (2008‒2016).2 Mongolia’s  vegetable  farming 
sector is typically characterized by smallholdings of up to 5 hectares (ha), fragmented farmland, 
lack of reliable access to water, and lack of value chain services and financial resources. There 
are about 300 cooperatives and 35,000 households across the country, growing vegetables on 
plots of up to 100 ha, but with a total sown area of only 8,904 ha in 2018.3 
2. 
Irrigation services are supported by the Ministry of Food, Agriculture, and Light Industry 
(MOFALI), which owns most of the irrigation infrastructure and provides support for maintenance. 
There are currently more than 380 irrigation schemes in Mongolia, with most found in the Kharaa 
River Basin and the downstream part of the Selenge and Orkhon river basins. Almost all irrigation 
systems  are  recognized  as  being  inefficient  in  use  of  water  resources,  have  outdated  and 
unsustainable  infrastructure,  and  with  insufficient  investment  in  maintenance.  Currently,  about 
54,000 ha are under irrigation against a potential area of around 400,000 ha, with the government 
aiming to increase irrigated land to 120,000 ha by 2030. Harmonized with Mongolia’s National 
Programme for  Food  Security  (2009−2016),4 the government  aims to  develop  and expand the 
country’s irrigated land and manage its water resources more effectively by improving existing 
irrigation systems, making CGGs more efficient, building capacity of the water users, and reducing 
vulnerability of farmers to climate-induced disasters. However, this remains a challenge with many 
of the irrigation systems being old and requiring substantial maintenance and rehabilitation. 
3. 
Cooperatives and farming households lack access to high-value markets in urban centers 
due to the absence of value chain services. Only a small fraction of the added value is captured: 
smallholder farmers only capture about 30%−60% of potato, carrot, cabbage, turnip, and onion 
retail  value. 5  Cooperative  and  farmer  incomes  are  low,  and  opportunities  curtailed  not  only 
because of lack of market access, but also because of poor agricultural practices with seasonally 
fluctuating  supply  and  quality  of  farming  outputs.  Access to  credit  is  hindered  by  high  interest 
rates  and  collateral  requirements  which  are  a  major  obstacle  for  small  farmers’  access  to 
financing.  Short  summers  with  frequent  droughts  limit  the  cropping  season,  resulting  in 
seasonality of vegetables, price fluctuations, and reliance on imported vegetables. The absence 
of irrigation systems and water-saving technologies results in high-risk production with frequent 
yield  losses.  In  the  absence  of  post-harvest  and  storage  facilities,  and  with  little  access  to 
wholesale  price  information  and  low  awareness  on  value-added  opportunities  and  marketing, 
farming households mainly sell their vegetables to middlemen.

infrastructure,  support 
Agriculture  and  its  associated  facilities  are  highly  vulnerable  to climate change.  Coping 
4. 
with significant variability in future climatic impacts requires efficient water resource management, 
increased  capacity  of  agricultural 
institutions,  and  stakeholders, 
improvement of the support services to farmers, and more resilient production and ecosystems. 
Some studies have indicated that Mongolia’s agriculture sector could benefit from increased crop 
yields  due  to  longer  growing  season,  earlier  rains,  higher  temperatures,  and  increased 
precipitation:  however,  the  increased  winds,  warmer  temperatures,  and  higher  potential 
evapotranspiration would surely increase water requirements. Other studies have indicated that 
there  could  be  negative  impacts  on  yield  from  extreme  high-  and  low-temperature  events. 
Expansion of irrigation and improved cultivation techniques would form an important measure to 
adapt to climate change. 
Government  policy.  On  the  back  of  its  Sustainable  Development  Vision  2030, 
5. 
Government  Action  Plan,  2016–2020,  and  State  Policy  on  Food  and  Agriculture  and  Crop 
Production  Law,  Mongolia  is  committed  to  improve  vegetable  production. 6 The  State  Policy 
stresses  the  need  to  improve  agricultural  productivity  and  production  management  through  a 
value chain approach, adaptation to climate change, and capacity-building for farmers. To support 
innovative initiatives in agriculture such as on-farm mechanization, climate-resilient greenhouses 
and water-saving irrigation technology, the government targets for local vegetable production to 
meet 70% domestic demand by 2020 and 100% by 2025. Policies prioritizing smallholder farming 
offer an enabling environment for meeting these targets. 
6. 
Strategic  fit.  The  project  will  support  ADB’s  Strategy  2030  through  both  creating 
knowledge and promoting rural development and food security.7 Supporting inclusive economic 
growth  is  a  key  strategic  priority for  ADB  in  its  country  partnership strategy for  Mongolia.8 The 
project supports the  improvement  of  irrigation systems  and  expansion  of  vegetable  production 
and  value-chain  linkages  as  well  as  residue  testing  of  food  and  agro-chemicals,  which  is 
consistent  with  the  four  priority  areas  of  ADB’s  Operational  Plan  for  Agriculture  and  Natural 
Resources.9 
7. 
Lessons.  The  project  design  incorporates  lessons  from  previous  and  ongoing  projects 
financed  by  ADB  and  others  in  Mongolia  as  well  as  from  project  preparation.  These  include:            
(i)  the  need  for  support  to  government  executing  and  implementing  agencies  to  develop  their 
project implementation capacity; (ii) the limited capacity of domestic design institutes to identify 
and  apply  modern  water-efficient  irrigation  methods  in  their  project  designs;  (iii)  the  need  for 
careful design of irrigation systems to ensure efficient irrigation water use; (iv) the need to focus 
on operation and maintenance of the upgraded systems, particularly through CGGs, to promote 
their  long-term  sustainability;  (v)  the  limited  capacity  for  production  of  climate  resilient  seeds, 
particularly vegetable seeds, suited to production under Mongolian conditions; and (vi) the need 
for long-term support for farmer groups to promote adoption of modern production technologies 
particularly for vegetables. 
6   Sustainable  Development  Vision  2030  aims  to  increase  irrigated  land  by  adopting  new  and  efficient  irrigation 
technologies  on  65,000  ha  by  2020  (100,000  ha  by  2015,  120,000  ha  by  2030),  increase  farmland  fertility,  and 
decrease soil degradation.

Impact and Outcome 
8. 
The project is aligned with the following impact: income generation and enterprise support 
for  smallholder  vegetable  farmers  increased.  The  project  will  have  the  following  outcome: 
efficiency of climate resilient agricultural production and marketing increased.  
C. 
Outputs 
The outputs of the project will be (i) efficient and climate-resilient irrigation infrastructure 
9. 
and  management  systems  installed;  (ii)  environmentally  sustainable  agriculture  production 
systems  improved;  and  (iii)  technical  Institutional,  and  management  capacity  and  coordination 
strengthened.  The  project  design  follows  the  principles  of  (i)  upgrading  irrigation  systems;  (ii) 
improving the efficiency of resource use in agricultural production through improved seeds and 
investment  in  farming  equipment;  (iii)  improving  the  quality  and  safety  of  end-products  for 
consumers; and (iv) ensuring that there is an opportunity to participate in equitable benefit sharing 
from the project. 
10. 
Output  1:  Efficient  and  climate-resilient irrigation  infrastructure and  management 
systems  installed.  This  output  will  focus  on  (i)  upgrading,  modernizing,  and  climate  proofing 
irrigation  and  drainage  infrastructure; 10  (ii)  strengthening  coordination  and  management  of 
irrigation  services,  irrigated  land,  irrigation  infrastructure,  including  storage  ponds  to  build 
resilience against prolonged droughts and canals in irrigation systems, ensuring efficient, reliable, 
and equitable irrigation supplies for agricultural land; and (iii) tree planting for shelter belts around 
the modernized irrigated areas. The project will upgrade, modernize and climate proof 12 selected 
schemes along with directly associated infrastructure providing irrigation services for 7,000 ha. 
The project will finance remodeling and improvement of main, secondary, and tertiary canals or 
pipes, drainage facilities, field application systems such as high efficiency center pivot sprinkler 
systems and drip irrigation for 240 ha, and associated structures, and where needed construction 
of  new,  access  roads  and  windbreaks.  Soum  governments  will  be  strengthened  to  conduct 
operation and maintenance (O&M) of irrigation system and will pilot a modern asset management 
system. A total of 240 jobs will be created during construction, including 40% women and 10% 
from female headed households; and all contracts for 3,094 households to be engaged in new 
vegetable farming plots will be signed or co-signed by women. 
11. 
Output  2:  Environmentally  sustainable  agriculture  production  systems  improved. 
This  output  aims  to  improve  food  safety,  environment  sustainability  and  climate  resilience  of 
agriculture  production  systems,  focusing  specifically  on  agrochemical  residue  testing  and 
supporting the implementation of a new law on plant seeds by promoting the introduction of new 
high yielding and climate resilient vegetable seeds varieties. The project will support the National 
Institute  for  Plant  Protection  (IPP)  with  testing  equipment  and  reagents  for  additional  testing 
capacity of 4,000 tests to ensure the safety of imported pesticides and residues in food products. 
This  is  expected  to  reduce  use  of  harmful  agrochemicals  and  to  build  consumer  trust  in 
domestically  produced  vegetables.  The  project  will  support,  through  the  coordination  of  the 
national  extension  center,  four  regional  crop  research  institutes  (CRI)  with:  (i)  provision  of 
equipment and facilities such as climate controlled growth chambers, storage cool rooms, sheds, 
fencing, mechanization packages, seed cleaning and packaging equipment, conservation farming 
equipment, and teaching facilities; (ii) small-scale irrigation rehabilitation and modernization; and 
(iii)  greenhouses  including  low-carbon  options  for  extending  cropping  seasons,  high  value 
10  Climate  proof  irrigation  systems  increase  the  seasonal  availability  of  crop  water  and  are  resilient  against  severe 
weather events such as storms and floods and are well operated with efficient water allocation and monitoring.   
4 
vegetable  cultivation  and  quality  seedling  production.  This  is  expected  to  increase  production 
capacity for vegetable seeds by 0.65 tons and for seed potatoes by 10 tons.11 A total of 20 women 
researchers and 192 women from CGGs will be provided technical support and training on best 
practices.  
12. 
Output  3:  Technical,  institutional,  and  management  capacity  and  coordination 
strengthened.  The  project  will  set  up  48  CGGs  in  the  12  irrigation  schemes,  including  40% 
women as members and 25% in leadership positions; and provide training on improved vegetable 
production for 480 CGG participating farmers, including 40% women, in collaboration with CRIs. 
The two main providers of extension services to vegetable farmers will be crop research centers 
such as the Institute of Plant and Agriculture Science, and a facilitation partner such as a local 
non-government  organization.  Project  supported  CRIs  will  provide  capacity  building  in  good 
agricultural  practice  and  integrated  pest  management  for  farmers’  improved  management  of 
natural resources with minimized use of agrochemicals, use of climate smart agriculture practices 
and  the  introduction  of  enhanced  vegetable  production  and  processing  techniques.  To  further 
strengthen  CGGs,  Output  3  will  provide  mechanization  technology  packages,  all  weather 
greenhouses  with  solar  powered  heating  and  long-life  films,  and  small  cool  rooms  for  product 
storage.  The  equipment  will  be  provided  through  a  combination  of  Asian  Development  Bank 
(ADB)  loan  and  the  proposed  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  (JFPR)  grant  to  the  soum 
government which can then be provided to CGGs based on eligibility criteria.12  
13. 
To  strengthen  institutional  and  management capacity, Output  3  will  (i)  raise awareness 
and improve agricultural extension services for farmers and CGGs; (ii) promote business planning 
and  marketing  development  skills,  including  building  and  maintaining  formal  supply  chain 
partnerships, to increase income and sustainable livelihoods for farmers; (iii) promote improved 
management of natural resources, especially water resources and soils through strengthening of 
farmer capacity on proper use of chemicals and fertilizers (e.g. integrated pest management and 
other  climate-smart  agriculture  practice);  and (iv)  provide  organizational  management  training. 
The  two  main  providers  of  extension  services  to  vegetable  farmers  will  include  crop  research 
centers such as Institute of Plant and Agriculture Sciences (IPAS), and a facilitation partner such 
as  a  local  NGO  financed  through  the  JFPR  grant.  Capacity  development  consultants  will  be 
engaged to (i) oversee the upgrading of the irrigation schemes, (ii) support the development of 
CGGs  and  train  them  on  operation  and  maintenance  of  irrigation  systems,  and  (iii)  provide 
technical  support  to  the  4  regional  seed  centers  including  seed  production  and  conservation 
agriculture experts. 
Innovations.  The  project  design  contains  innovative  agriculture  features  such  as  (i) 
14. 
adoption of high-efficiency irrigation equipment, (ii) enhanced food safety and reduced environment 
pollution, (iii) summer and winter greenhouses for production of high value crops, and (iv) promoting 
the allocation of land within the upgraded irrigation schemes to poor and disadvantaged households 
and training them in the production of high value crops, including vegetables. 
15. 
Knowledge sharing. The lessons learned have been incorporated into the project design 
by:  (i)  engaging  national  consultants to  staff  the  project  implementation  unit (PIU)  and to  work 
with MOFALI to improve its capacity; (ii) supporting the domestic design institutes to be contracted 
for  subproject  detailed  design  by  construction  supervision  consultants  in  the  capacity 
11 This  will  build  on  achievements of  other donor  funded  interventions  for  drought-resilient  seeds, e.g.  CIMMIT and 
Swiss Agency for Development Cooperation (SDC). 
12 The criteria for determining eligibility will include: (i) community grower group in place with effective government and 
management arrangements; and (ii) a plan agreed by all members as to how farmers in the group will have equitable 
access to machinery and facilities. 
5 
development team who will ensure design quality (iii) engagement of consultants experienced in 
CGGs  and  operation  and  maintenance  to  assist  the  soums  in  establishing  the  necessary 
arrangements; and (iv) the focus of the proposed JFPR grant activities on vegetable production 
in the subproject areas.

PROJECT MANAGEMENT ARRANGEMENTS 
A. 
Project Implementation Organizations: Roles and Responsibilities 
The Ministry of Food, Agriculture, and Light Industry (MOFALI) is the executing agency 
17. 
responsible  for  overall  project  implementation.  Crop  Production  Development  Policy  and 
Coordination Department (CPDPCD) will be the implementing agency for the project. Guidance 
and sector coordination will be through a national project steering committee (PSC). The PSC will 
be chaired by the State Secretary of MOFALI and will meet at least twice a year during project 
implementation.  
18. 
A  project  implementation unit  (PIU)  will  be  established  at  MOFALI  in Ulaanbaatar.  The 
PIU will be responsible for daily project management, including accounting, procurement, training, 
monitoring,  and  reporting.  The  PIU  will  be  chaired  by  the  Director  General  of  CDPCD.  The 
executing  and  implementing  agencies  lack  the  personnel  and  resources  needed  to  fully 
implement the project, and the PIU staff will be recruited for the administrative and technical tasks.  
19. 
Once the PIU structure is approved by the Ministry of Finance (MOF), MOFALI will finalize 
and  acquire  no  objection  from  ADB  on  the  TOR  of  the  PIU  staff,  and  publicly  announce  the 
vacancies through local newspapers and MOFALI website. The selections of all PIU staff shall be 
subject  to  ADB’s  prior-review  and  approval  to  ensure  that  qualified  candidates  are  selected.  
Project  implementation  arrangements,  including  the  establishment  of  the  PSC,  selection  and 
hiring of the PIU staff, reporting, and other relevant arrangements, will comply with Mongolia’s 
Regulation  on  Utilization  of  Proceeds  of  Foreign  Loans  of  the  Government;  Implementation, 
Administration, Financing, Monitoring and Evaluation of Projects and Programs Funded by Such 
Proceeds, approved under the Resolution NO. 196 of the Minister of Finance and other relevant 
regulations  approved  and  amended  from  time  to  time,  provided  they  do  not  conflict  with  the 
provisions of the loan and grant agreements13, this project administration manual or ADB policies.

IV. 
COSTS AND FINANCING 
22. 
The  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $46.25  million.  The  project  investment  costs  include 
goods,  works,  and  consulting  services  to  support  upgrading  of  12  irrigation  systems; 
modernization of seed production facilities, pesticide and food quality testing; and modernization 
of vegetable production; as well as project management.  
23. 
The  government  has  requested  $14.7  million  regular  loan  from  ADB’s  ordinary  capital 
resources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period 
of 6 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB’s London interbank offered 
rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%  per  year;  and  such  other 
terms  and  conditions  as  are  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  grant  agreements.  Based  on  the 
straight-line repayment method, the average maturity is 15.25 years, and the maturity premium 
payable  to  ADB  is  0.1%.  The  government  has  also  requested  $25.3  million  concessional  loan 
from ADB’s ordinary capital resources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 25-year 
term, including a grace period of 5 years; an annual interest rate of 2%. The government has also 
requested a grant of $2 million from the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction. 
24. 
The ADB loan will finance 86% of the total project costs through a regular loan (31.8%) 
and  a  concessional  loan  (54.7%),  including  expenditures  relating  to  civil  works,  goods,  and 
services. A cofinanced grant will finance 4.3% of the total project costs, including expenditures 
relating to irrigation equipment for poor households and capacity building.  
25. 
Central and local governments will contribute 9.2% of the total project costs through in-
kind contribution of work time by government personnel and exemption of value added taxes and 
duties for works and goods. The value added tax and custom duties exemptions will be accounted 
and recorded by the PIU, to properly account for the government counterpart financing for the 
project. The amounts exempted will be recorded as part of the cost of the assets purchased and/or 
services contracted. All PIU staff and national consultant salaries are inclusive of personal income 
taxes;  such  personnel  are  responsible  for  fulfilling  their  Mongolian  tax  obligations.  Salaries  for 
international  consultants  and  resource  persons  who  are  required  to  pay  tax  on  their  income 
earned in Mongolia are inclusive of relevant taxes, i.e. the project will pay the relevant tax; the 
treaties for the avoidance of double taxation will need to be checked to determine whether income 
taxes need to be paid by the international consultants or not. The government has assured ADB 
that  it  will  provide  additional  funding  for  any  shortfall  of  funds  or  cost  overruns  to  ensure  the 
success of the project. 
26. 
Administrative budget support of 3% of the total grant amount ($60,000), exclusive from 
the project grant, will be provided given the wide spread of the project (covering the full end to 
end value chain for an underexplored sector in Mongolia in four soums) which warrants additional 
resources  beyond  those  provided  by  the  regular  administration  budget.  This  budget  will  be 
financed  from  the  JFPR  administrative  budget,  not  from  the  project  grant.  The  administrative 
budget support will be used to (i) hire a staff consultant to provide overall support to ADB as well 
as  the  government’s  executing  agency  in  project  implementation,  if  and  when  needed  and 
deemed necessary, by the implementing project officer, to (a) monitor and evaluate activities and 
project  progress  beyond  the  regular  progress  checks  conducted  by  the  ADB  staff  team  and 
resources,  (b)  evaluate  status  and  progress  of  the  community  growers  groups  farming  action 
plans,  (c)  monitor  the  project’s  outreach  to  the  intended  beneficiaries,  (d)  conduct  periodical 
community level consultations; and (e) review performances of the project executing agency, PIU, 
and  consultants  to  ensure  intended  outputs  are  delivered  on  time;  (ii)  knowledge  product 
development  and  dissemination,  including  a  written  impact  report,  multi-media  story  (video  or 
23 
pictorial), and organization of the final project completion symposium for showcasing success and 
sharing  lessons  learned;  and  (iii)  facilitate  community  participation  or  civil  society  organization 
collaboration in consultations, field activities, or the final project completion symposium planned. 
Final details will be confirmed during inception phase once project implementation starts. 
27. 
The special administrative budget support will be administered by ADB. The processing 
and implementing project officer will manage and track the utilization of the administration budget 
support and will provide the ADB Partner Funds Division (SDPF) on a periodic basis (annual) an 
update of its utilization. Any deviation from the proposed expenditures should be consulted with, 
and endorsed by, SDPF. 
A. 
Cost Estimates Preparation and Revisions  
28. 
Preparation. The cost estimates were prepared jointly by the implementing agency and 
ADB with assistance from the transaction technical assistance (TA) consultants. The sources and 
basis of cost estimates were reviewed during project preparation and confirmed by related parties. 
The process was facilitated by a model in excel software which enabled easy updating or revision, 
if necessary. The model is maintained by both the implementing agency (IA) and ADB. 
29. 
Revision. Revision of cost estimates will be conducted when deemed necessary during 
implementation. The PIU will be responsible in proposing and drafting the revisions which will be 
subject to ADB’s approval. 
B. 
Key Assumptions

of  accounting  procedures,  financial  controls,  audit  arrangements  and the  capacity  of  MOFALI. 
The  FMA  was  conducted  with  the  aid  of  the  ADB  Financial  Management  Assessment 
Questionnaire  (FMAQ)  and  was  undertaken  between  June-July  2019  by  the  financial 
management specialist engaged for the project transaction technical assistance and included the 
personnel of MOFALI’s Accounting Division, MOFALI’s Crop Production Development Policy and 
Coordination Department (CPDPCD).  In addition to the FMA conducted for the project, additional 
information was derived from: (i) a Public Financial Management Performance Report15 prepared 
by the World Bank for Mongolia; (ii) a report by the International Monetary Fund (IMF);16 and (iii) 
ADB’s  Country  Partnership  Strategy  (CPS).17 ADB’s  CPS  finds  that  efforts  to  improve  public 
financial management are still needed, though Mongolia has succeeded in recent years to rein in 
fiscal imbalances. 
33. 
The  pre-mitigation  risk  for  financial  management  of  the  project  was  assessed  to  be 
moderate.  Inherent risks concern the volatility of the national economy based on mineral sector, 
which  causes  optimistic  macroeconomic  parameters  and  weak  fiscal  management.  However, 
these  are  being  addressed  by  the  government  with  coordinated  assistance  from  the  donor 
community, in parallel with efforts to improve the economy through support in agriculture.   
Project risk comprise of the unavailability of MOFALI staff to be assigned to the Project 
34. 
Implementation Unit (PIU) to perform day to day project management work.  Identified control risk 
in implementation of financial management  is limited knowledge of MOF internal audit staff on 
ADB rules and procedures. These weaknesses will be mitigated by the recruitment of long-term 
consultants  on  an  individual  basis  for  staffing  of  the  PIU  which  will  be  established  to  assist 
implementation of the project, including a Finance Specialist who is familiar with accounting and 
disbursement for ADB projects. This will enable MOFALI, with the support of PIU, to effectively 
administer the advance accounts for the project. The consultants to be hired will be appropriately 
qualified and experienced in project management. Additional training will be provided as required 
to introduce the PIU staff to ADB’s and MOFALI’s requirements and procedures.  
The identified financial management risks will be mitigated by the proposed action plan as 
35. 
shown in Table 11 and will be closely monitored during project implementation.

Disbursement 
1.  Disbursement Arrangements for ADB Funds 
36. 
Loan and grant proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB’s Loan Disbursement 
Handbook  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time),  and  detailed  arrangements  agreed  upon 
between the government and ADB. MOF will maintain separate accounts and records for the loan. 
The PIU will be responsible for project implementation, including daily management, accounting, 
procurement, training, monitoring, and reporting. 
The  project  will  use  a  combination  of  direct  payment,  reimbursement,  statement  of 
37. 
expenditures, and advance account procedure of ADB. 
38. 
Direct  payment  procedure.  ADB,  at  the  borrower’s  request,  can  directly  pay  a 
designated beneficiary stipulated in the contract and approved by ADB (e.g., supplier, contractor, 
or consultant). A signed withdrawal application (WA) must be submitted to ADB together with the 
supporting documents. 
39. 
Reimbursement  procedure.    ADB  can  pay  from  the  loan  account  to  the  borrower’s 
account for eligible expenditures which have been incurred and paid for by the borrower out of its 
own  resources.  A  signed  withdrawal  application  must  be  submitted  to  ADB  together  with  a 
summary/statement of expenditures (SOE).  
40. 
Advance fund procedure.   MOFALI  has  the  capacity  to  administer  advance accounts 
and statement of expenditure procedure. To facilitate project implementation and timely release 
of loan proceeds, the Government of Mongolia, through the MOF, after loan effectiveness, will 
establish  three  advance  accounts,  one  for  each  financing  source,  at  a  commercial  bank 
acceptable to ADB. MOF is working towards enabling the establishment of USD accounts under 
the Treasury Single Account (TSA) at the MOF. Once in place, upon consultation with ADB the 
MOF will transfer projects’ USD accounts at the commercial banks to the TSA.  The currency of 
the advance accounts will be in US dollar. The loan and the grant proceeds will be paid into the 
advance  accounts,  which  will  be  operated  by  MOFALI,  the  executing  agency.  The  advance 
accounts  will  be  used  exclusively  for  ADB’s  share  of  the  eligible  expenditures.  MOFALI,  with 
support of the PIU, will be responsible for the management, monitoring, and reconciliation of the 
advance accounts. The PIU will process the invoices of contractors and will generate requests for 
replenishments of the advance accounts and provide detailed reporting of all financial flows.  MOF 
will establish 3 separate accounts in MNT, one for each advance account. These accounts will be 
held under the TSA at MOF. The MNT accounts will be managed by MOFALI, with the support of 
the PIU, and will be for daily expenditures including for payment to contractors, suppliers, and 
consultants.  MOFALI’s  will  ensure  that  every  liquidation  and  replenishment  from  the  project 
accounts is supported by documentation in accordance with ADB’s Loan Disbursement Handbook 
(2017, as amended from time to time).  
35 
The total outstanding advance to the advance accounts should not exceed the estimate 
41. 
of ADB’s/JPFR’s share of expenditures to be paid through the respective advance accounts for 
the forthcoming 6 months. MOF may request for initial and additional advances to the advance 
account based on an Estimate of Expenditure Sheet setting out the estimated expenditures to be 
financed through the accounts for the forthcoming 6 months.18 Supporting documents should be 
submitted to ADB or retained by MOF in accordance with ADB’s Loan Disbursement Handbook 
(2017, as amended from time to time), and other detailed arrangements agreed by ADB and the 
government. The Loan Disbursement Handbook 2017, as amended from time to time), describes 
which supporting documents should be submitted to ADB and which should be retained by the 
government for liquidation and replenishment of the advance account. 
Statement  of  expenditure  procedure.19 The  statement  of  expenditure  procedure may 
42. 
be  used  for  reimbursement  of  eligible  expenditures  or  liquidation  of  advances  to  the  advance 
accounts. Supporting documents and records for the expenditures claimed under the statement 
of  expenditure  should  be  maintained  and  made  readily  available  for  review  by  ADB’s 
disbursement and review missions, upon ADB’s request for submission of supporting documents 
on a sampling basis, and for independent audit.  
43. 
Before the submission of the first withdrawal application, the government should submit 
to  ADB  sufficient  evidence  of  the  authority  of  the  person(s)  who  will  sign  the  withdrawal 
applications on behalf of the government, together with the authenticated specimen signatures of 
each  authorized  person.  The  minimum  value  per  withdrawal  application  is  stipulated  in  ADB’s 
Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time). Individual payments below 
such  amount  should  be  paid  (i)  by  MOFALI,  and  subsequently  claimed  to  ADB  through 
reimbursement; or (ii) through the advance fund procedure, unless otherwise accepted by ADB. 
MOF should ensure sufficient category and contract balances before requesting disbursements. 
Use of ADB’s Client Portal for Disbursements system is encouraged for submission of withdrawal 
applications to ADB.20  
C. 
Accounting 
44.  MOFALI will maintain, or cause to be maintained, separate books and records by funding 
source for all expenditures incurred on the project following International Public Sector Accounting 
Standard  for  accrual-based  accounting.  MOFALI  will  prepare  project  financial  statements  in 
accordance  with  the  government's  accounting  laws  and  regulations  which  are  consistent  with 
international accounting principles and practices.  
D. 
Auditing and Public Disclosure 
45.  MOFALI will cause the detailed project financial statements to be audited in accordance 
with  International  Standards  on  Auditing  by  an  independent  auditor  acceptable  to  ADB.  The 
audited project financial statements together with the auditor’s  opinion will be presented in the 
English language to ADB within 6 months from the end of the fiscal year by MOFALI. 
18 The estimate of expenditure sheet is available in Appendix 8A of ADB’s  Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as 
amended from time to time). 
19 The statement of expenditure forms are available in Appendixes 7B and 7D of ADB’s Loan Disbursement Handbook 
(2017, as amended from time to time). 
20 The Client Portal for Disbursement system facilitates online submission of withdrawal applications to ADB, resulting 
in  faster  disbursement.  The  forms  to  be  completed  by  the  borrower  are  available  online  at  https://www.adb.org/ 
documents/client-portal-disbursements-guide.     
36 
The audit report for the project financial statements will include a management letter and 
46. 
auditor’s opinions, which cover (i) whether the project financial statements present an accurate 
and fair view or are presented fairly, in all material respects, in accordance with the applicable 
financial reporting standards; (ii) whether the proceeds of the loans and grant were used only for 
the  purpose(s)  of  the  project;  and  (iii)  whether  the  borrower  or  executing  agency  was  in 
compliance with the financial covenants contained in the legal agreements (where applicable). 
47. 
Compliance with financial reporting and auditing requirements will be monitored by review 
missions and during normal program supervision; and followed up regularly with all concerned, 
including the external auditor.  
48. 
The government, MOFALI, and the Crop Production Development Policy and Coordination 
Department  have  been  made  aware  of  ADB’s  approach  to  delayed  submission;  and  the 
requirements for satisfactory and acceptable quality of the audited project financial statements.21 
ADB  reserves  the  right  to  require  a  change  in  the  auditor  (in  a  manner  consistent  with  the 
constitution of the borrower); or for additional support to be provided to the auditor, if the audits 
required  are  not  conducted  in  a  manner  satisfactory  to  ADB;  or  if  the  audits  are  substantially 
delayed. ADB reserves the right to verify the project's financial account to confirm that the share 
of ADB’s financing is used in accordance with ADB’s policies and procedures.  
Public disclosure of the audited project financial statements, including the auditor’s opinion 
49. 
on the project financial statements, will be guided by ADB’s Access to Information Policy22.  After 
the  review,  ADB  will  disclose  the  audited  project  financial  statements  and  the  opinion  of  the 
auditors on the project financial statements not later than 14 days of ADB’s confirmation of their 
acceptability by posting them on ADB’s website. The management letter and additional auditor’s 
opinions will not be disclosed. 
21 ADB’s approach and procedures regarding delayed submission of audited project financial statements:  
(i)  When audited project financial statements are not received by the due date, ADB will write to the executing 
agency advising that (a) the audit documents are overdue; and (b) if they are not received within the next 6 
months, requests for new contract awards and disbursement such as new replenishment of advance accounts, 
processing of new reimbursement, and issuance of new commitment letters will not be processed. 
(ii)  When  audited  project  financial  statements  are  not  received  within  6  months  after  the  due  date,  ADB  will 
withhold processing of requests for new contract awards and disbursement such as new replenishment of 
advance accounts, processing of new reimbursement, and issuance of new commitment letters. ADB will (a) 
inform the executing agency  of ADB’s actions; and (b) advise that the loan may be suspended if the audit 
documents are not received within the next 6 months. 
(iii)  When audited project financial statements  are not received within 12 months after the due date, ADB may 
suspend the loan.

VI. 
PROCUREMENT AND CONSULTING SERVICES 
50. 
A project procurement risk assessment was conducted for the project, in accordance with 
the ADB’s Guidance Note on Strategic Procurement Planning. Overall project procurement risk 
is assessed as high. The main weaknesses are: (i) the EA and the IA are unfamiliar with the newly 
adopted  ADB's  Procurement  Policy  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time),  Procurement 
Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time); (ii) insufficient number of 
dedicated  procurement units/professionals  in  government  agencies  contributes to  low  capacity 
and  delay  in  procurement;  and  (iii)  lack  of  procedures  in  place  for  procurement  and  contract 
management. 
51. 
Proposed  mitigation  measures  include  the  trainings  for  the  EA/IA  staff  and  PIU  and 
technical  supports  by  the  project  procurement  professionals.  The  procurement  trainings  were 
delivered  by  the  ADB  officials  during  the  project  preparation  on  topics  of  ADB's  Procurement 
Policy and Regulations to address the EA/IA’s non-familiarity with these policy and regulations. 
The subsequent procurement trainings will be delivered on a well-defined interval by the Project 
Implementation  Start-up  Consultant  to  ensure that  procurement  activities  are  in  full  conformity 
with ADB Procurement Policy and Regulations. 
52. 
The project implementation start-up consultant will support the EA/IA recruiting the  PIU 
staff  and  all  consulting  firms  and  individuals  for  the  project,  including  advance  procurement 
contracts,  in  accordance  with  ADB  Procurement  Policy  and  Regulations  and  procedural 
requirements.  
Detailed  engineering  design  firms  will  develop  Technical  Specifications  and  Bill  of 
53. 
Quantities  (BoQ)  for  civil  works  for  irrigation  schemes  and  goods  included  in  the  civil  works 
packages for irrigation schemes and prepare the Section 6 of the DBDs. The responsibilities will 
include but not be limited to: (i) prepare Technical Specifications and BoQ for goods and works 
to  be  implemented;  (ii)  prepare  cost  estimations  (unit  rate  breakdown  by  resources  and 
summarized unit rates); (iii) develop detailed and general specifications of bidding documents and 
Section 6 of Bidding Documents. Technical specifications shall include general instructions and 
recommendations  for  the  contractor  (bidders)  as  well  as  detailed  specifications  (specifying  all 
mandatory standards) for controlling materials used, methods of work performance and quality. 
54. 
Detailed  description  of  the  procurement  tasks  of  the  PIU  will  be,  but  not  limited  to:  (i) 
prepare, on behalf of the executing and implementing agencies, bidding documents, reports, and 
other supporting documents and submit these for EA/BEC/CSC’s review and use; (ii) ensure all 
procurement of goods and recruitment of consultants are in compliance with ADB relevant rules 
and procedures; (iii) manage communications and timely advise the EA/IA on procurement issues 
that may impact the achievement of project outcomes (including issues of pre-award and post-
award); (iv) ensure procurement activities are scheduled in a timely manner, and that the relevant 
documents are completed on time; (v) provide required technical assistance to the EA/IA/CSC 
and  BEC  when 
final 
products/deliverables/outputs. 
the  EA/IA 
necessary; 
accepting

and 
(vi) 
55. 
For  purposes  of  evaluating  the  various  bids,  proposals,  expressions  of  interest  of 
individual  consultants  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Procurement  Policy  (2017,  as  amended  from 
time to time) and Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to 
time),  an  independent  evaluation  committee  will  be  formed  following  Public  Procurement  Law. 
Members  of  the  committee  must  not  in  any  way  be  involved  with  any  of  the  bidders  that  may 
constitute a conflict of interest. 
38 
56. 
The procurement plan comprises a total of 69 contracts: 1 civil works contract for OCB for 
international advertisement; 2 goods contracts for OCB for international advertisement; 25 OCB 
contracts  for  goods  and  works  for  national  advertisement;  6  goods  contracts  for  requests  for 
quotation; 24 community participation contracts; 2 consulting services contracts through quality- 
and  cost-based  selection;  3  consulting  services  contracts  through  consultants’  qualification 
selection; 1 consulting services contract through least-cost selection, 1 consulting service contract 
through  direct  contracting,  and  4  contracts  for  individual  consultants.  The  3  contracts  for 
international  advertisement  were  assessed  of  high  value  therefore  would  require  advertising 
internationally to attract enough qualified bidders. 
A. 
Advance Contracting 
57. 
Advance contracting will apply to the urgent recruitment of consulting services, which will 
have major impacts on timely and successful start-up of the project. Advance contracting may be 
applied  for  hiring  of  PIU  staff  to  engage  consulting  firms  for  design  and  supervision.  Advance 
actions will include preparation of bidding documents, advertisement, and proposal evaluation, 
which  require  ADB  prior  approval.  Consulting  firm  contracts  will  be  signed  after  the  loan  has 
become effective. All advance contracting will be undertaken in conformity with ADB Procurement 
Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers 
(2017, as amended from time to time).23 
B. 
Procurement of Goods, Works, and Consulting Services 
All  procurement  of  the  ADB-financed  works,  goods,  non-consulting  services,  and 
58. 
consulting services will be undertaken in accordance with ADB’s Procurement Policy (2017, as 
amended from time to time) and ADB’s Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as 
amended from time to time). 
59. 
A  procurement  plan  for  the  initial  18  months  period  indicating  methods  and  review 
procedures;  works,  goods,  and  consulting  service  contract  packages;  and  guidelines  for  open 
competitive bidding national advertising are in Section C. 
1.  Open Competitive Bidding  
60. 
Open competitive bidding will used for all goods and works contracts except small value, 
readily available off-the shelves goods and services. OCB for national advertising will be used for 
all goods and civil works contracts except one contract for each category. One contract for civil 
works  and  two  contracts  for  goods  were  assessed  of  high  value  therefore  would  require 
international  advertising  to  attract  enough  qualified  bidder.  The  procurement  assessment 
examined the  potential  for  attracting  enough  qualified  bidders to  ensure the  contract  would  be 
delivered on time, to requisite quality and exhibit value for money. It was concluded that relevant 
national  markets  are  matured  enough  with  sufficient  number  of  qualified  national  bidders  and 
unlikely to attract qualified foreign bidders for most packages. 
61. 
For procurement under OCB to be advertised nationally, the following provisions will be 
applied: (i) the advertisement will be limited to the national press, an official gazette, or an open-
access website; (ii) standard bidding documents developed by MOF and approved by ADB will 
be used; and (iii) bidding documents will  be in Mongolian language (except for contracts which 
23 Available at: https://www.adb.org/documents/adb-procurement-policy  
39 
require  international  advertising),  and  the  currency  for  bidding  and  payment  will  be  Mongolian 
Tugrik,  unless  otherwise  agreed  between  MOF/MOFALI  and  ADB;  and  set  forth  in  the 
procurement plan. Procurement under OCB will use the single-stage, one-envelope procedure. 
The relevant sections of ADB’s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended from time to time) will 
be included in all procurement documents and contracts.24  
2.  Request for Quotation 
Request for quotation will be used for ADB-financed simple civil works and non-consulting 
62. 
services of small value and readily available goods and or standard-specification commodities of 
small-value goods. Request for quotation shall indicate the description and quantity of the goods, 
a description of the services or specifications of works, as well as desired delivery (or completion) 
time and place. 
3.  Community Participation in Procurement 
Community-driven works, goods and services for planting the windbreaks will be procured 
63. 
using community participation in procurement (CPP) method. This method may be suitable for 
planting  the  windbreaks  since  the  nature  of  the  work  is  labor-intensive;  requires  permanent 
maintenance  services;  the  water  resource  and  irrigation  equipment  will  be  provided  with 
subprojects  that  may  result  into  cost  saving.  The  contractors  will  be  local  community  groups 
registered  with  the  soum  governments  of  the  12  project  soums;  and  are  expected  to  be  the 
reforestation community partnerships registered by Ministry of Environment and Tourism and the 
CGGs with technical members on reforestation. The technical members will be a forest engineer, 
a soil specialist and an agronomist. 
64. 
PIU, Capacity Development and Vegetable Production Facilitation firms will conduct the 
workshops  for  community  groups  explaining  required  documents  for  contracting  and  provide 
technical guidance. The procurement will be carried out under OCB procedure to be advertised 
locally.  MOF’s standard bidding documents for community participation improvised to the ADB 
procurement procedures will be used. At least three community groups shall be considered for 
executing a subject contract and be competitively selected based on community groups’ previous 
experience and qualifications. For each package, the PIU with support of Capacity Development 
and  Vegetable  Production  Facilitation  firms  will  closely  supervise  the  technical  specifications, 
procurement, financial administration, monitoring, and reporting. 
Fresh-lifted stock by local tree farms or community planters will be preferred. Planting will 
65. 
be carried out in accordance to the client's specifications, and planters should comply with the 
following  Mongolian  quality  standards  namely,  (i)  Feasibility  Study  on  Planting  Crop  Field 
Windbreak by MOFALI (2018), (ii) Windbreak planting technology, (iii) Technical Standard and 
Requirements for Plantation of Spruce, Mongolian Standard 6139: 2010, (iv) Technical Standard 
and  Requirements  for  Plantation  of  Deciduous  Trees,  MNS  6141:  2010,  and  (v)  Technical 
Standard and Requirements for Plantation of Bushes, MNS 6140 : 2010. The regular maintenance 
for  three  years  to  ensure  long-term  health  and  safety  of  the  trees  will  be  required.  The 
maintenance  services  will  include  watering,  mulching,  preventing  from  pests  and  diseases, 
prepare the trees for winter.

40 
4.  Consulting Services 
66. 
All consultants will be recruited according to ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended 
from time to time) and Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time 
to  time).  Appendix  1  contains  the  indicative  terms  of  references  for  the  individual  start-up 
consultants and capacity development consultants.25 Appendix 2 contains the indicative terms of 
reference  for  the  proposed  JFPR  consulting  services,  including  the  facilitation  consultants. 
Consulting  firms  will  be  engaged  using  the  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  with  a  standard 
quality:  cost  ratio  of  90:10,  consultant’s  qualifications  selection,  least-cost  selection  and  direct 
contracting using full, simple and biodata technical proposal procedures. Individual consultants 
will be engaged through an individual consultant selection procedure. 
5.  ADB Review 
67. 
Prior review procedure is required for (i) all the ADB-financed OCB contracts for civil works 
and goods, (ii) first contracts for each of goods and civil works contract under the RFQ method. 
Subsequent RFQ contracts will be post review (sampling). (iii) The first two contracts for goods 
and first two contracts for works under CP method will be prior review. Subsequent CP contracts 
will be post review (sampling), (iv) all the ADB-financed contracts for consulting services, and (v) 
ADB-financed  contracts  under  advance  contracting  arrangement.  ADB’s  prior  review  and 
approval  of  the  following  procurement  documents  will  be  required:  invitation  for  bids,  bidding 
documents,  bid  evaluation  report,  signed  contract,  and  contract  variations.  For  all  consultant 
recruitments, ADB’s prior review and approval of each step will be required. MOFALI and the PIU 
will maintain all documents related to the procurement of all the contracts (procurement file) for 
ADB  reviews  and  other  supervision  process  including  complaint  handling.  Procurement  files 
include,  but  not  limited  to,  invitation  for  bids,  request  for  expressions  of  interests,  the  issued 
bidding  documents,  the  issued  request  for  proposals  and  amendments  (if  any),  bid  evaluation 
reports,  technical  and  financial  evaluation  reports,  proposals/bids  submitted  by  the  bidders, 
minutes/records, contract award letters, and signed contracts etc.   
C. 
Procurement Plan 
68. 
The procurement plan shall be updated as needed throughout the duration of the project. 
25 TORs for the PIU staff are also included in Appendix 1 although they are not considered to be consultants.

SAFEGUARDS 
Environment  due  diligence.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  B  for  environment 
74. 
according  to ADB’s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  The  initial  environmental  examination 
(IEE), including an environmental management plan (EMP), was prepared and will be disclosed 
on the ADB website. The IEE concluded that full and effective implementation of the project EMP, 
together  with  the  training  and  project  assurances,  will  minimize  the  environmental  risks  of  the 
project and achieve compliance with the policy and regulatory standards applied in this project 
environmental impact assessment. 
Environmental management plan. The project EMP (Appendix 5) is to be implemented 
75. 
in all phases of the project: detailed design, pre-construction, construction, and operation. The 
EMP is to ensure project compliance with Mongolia’s environmental laws and ADB’s Safeguard 
Policy Statement (2009). The EMP describes: the roles and responsibilities of project agencies to 
implement the  EMP;  anticipated  impacts  and  mitigation  measures;  inspection, monitoring,  and 
reporting arrangements; training and institutional strengthening; grievance redress mechanism; 
and  future  public consultation.  In  the  engineering  design stage, MOFALI,  through  the  PIU,  will 
pass the EMP to the firms contracted to prepare the detailed engineering designs for the project 
facilities. The EMP will be updated at the end of the detailed design, as needed. To ensure that 
bidders will respond to the EMP’s provisions, MOFALI, through the PIU, will prepare and provide 
the specification clauses for incorporation into the bidding documents: (i) a list of environmental 
management requirements to be budgeted by the bidders in their bids; (ii) environmental clauses 
for contractual terms and conditions; and (iii) the project IEE and updated EMP. 
76. 
Environmental  management  plan  implementation.  The  PIU  will  be  responsible  for 
ensuring  that  the  project  will  be  designed,  constructed,  commissioned,  and  operated  in 
accordance with (i) the domestic environmental, health, and safety laws, regulations, procedures, 
and  guidelines;  (ii)  ADB’s  Safeguards  Policy  Statement,  and  (iii)  the  project  IEE  and  EMP. 
MOFALI holds the final responsibility for the implementation and compliance with the EMP. A PIU 
Environment  Safeguards  Specialist  coordinate  and/or  implement  the  EMP.  Draft  terms  of 
reference are in Appendix 1. 
77. 
Costs of EMP implementation are provided in the EMP. The ADB loan will bear the salary 
costs  for  the  PIU  environment  officer  and  costs  for  establishment  of  the  grievance  redress 
mechanism. The PIU will bear the cost of assigning a social and environmental focal staff, and, 
engaging an environmental monitoring agency to undertake the external monitoring specified in 
the  EMP.  The  costs  for  mitigation  measures  to  be  undertaken  by  the  contractors  during 
construction  will  be  included  in  the  contract  documents.  The  estimated  costs  for  EMP 
implementation are described in the EMP. During project implementation, cost estimates will be 
updated as needed.  
78. 
Climate change. Climate mitigation is estimated as $7.1 million and climate adaptation is 
estimated as $22.2 million. ADB and the ADB-administered fund will finance 100% of mitigation 
and adaptation costs.26

B. 
Involuntary Resettlement 
79. 
The project is classified by ADB as category C on involuntary resettlement according to 
ADB’s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  The  project  is  not  expected  to  involve  involuntary 
resettlement.  All  civil  works  will  be  implemented  on  state-owned  lands  and  will  not  involve 
acquisition of non-state lands, physical or economic displacement, or restriction on land use. No 
legacy issues have been found in any of the 12 irrigation schemes. In Nogoon Khashaa (Uliastai 
soum) the existing main canal goes through a built-up area where 8 households and one company 
have land ownership or possession rights along the canal. The canal will be covered and lined. 
Gardens and structures (fences and secondary structures) may be affected during construction 
and will need to be compensated. No household will need to be relocated. No permanent LAR 
impacts are anticipated. Households were met and support the canal upgrading. A Resettlement 
Framework  has  been  prepared  to  cover  impacts  during  construction  and  any  unanticipated 
impacts  that  may  occur  during  construction  and  operation  (Appendix  6).  The  EA/IA/PIU  will 
implement  the  Resettlement  Framework  with  the  help  of  social  focal  staff  and  consultants. 
MOFALI  will  be  the  executing  agency;  and  the  Crop  Production  Development  Policy  and 
Coordination  Department  of  MOFALI  will  be  the  implementing  agency.  Local  government  in 
relevant project soum will also involve in project implementation. A social and gender specialist 
to be recruited at PIU will support the EA/IA/PIU to follow the resettlement framework during the 
project implementation. Appendix 1 includes the TOR of the consultant.   
C. 
Indigenous Peoples 
80. 
The  project  is  classified  as  category  C  on  indigenous  peoples  according  to  ADB’s 
Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). The project is not expected to impact distinct and vulnerable 
communities  of  ethnic  minorities  that  would  trigger  ADB’s  SPS  requirements  on  indigenous 
people.  
D. 
Grievance Redress Mechanism 
81. 
A project grievance redress mechanism (GRM) has been developed in compliance with 
ADB’s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) requirement to address environmental, health, safety, 
and  social  concerns  associated  with  project.  The  GRM  is  designed  to  achieve  the  following 
objectives: (i) provide channels of communication for local communities to raise concerns about 
environmental and social-related grievances which might result from the project; (ii) prevent and 
mitigate adverse environmental and social impacts to communities caused by project construction 
and operation; and (iii) contribute to cooperation between the project agencies and communities. 
Public grievances related to the project components to be addressed by the GRM may include 
damage  to  public  roads,  interruption  of  public  services,  dust  emissions,  noise,  soil  erosion, 
inappropriate  disposal  of  waste  materials,  and  safety  for  the  general  public  and  construction 
workers. The GRM is accessible to all members of the communities, including women, elderly, 
disabled youth, minorities, and poverty-stricken residents. Multiple points of entry are available, 
including face-to-face meetings, written complaints, telephone conversations, e-mail, and social 
media. The details of the GRM, including a time-bound flow chart of procedures, are included in 
the project EMP (Appendix 5).  
VIII.  POVERTY, SOCIAL AND GENDER DIMENSIONS 
Poverty  and  social.  The  project  offers  opportunities  for  inclusive  development  and 
82. 
poverty reduction by enhancing productivity for vegetable production through stable water supply, 
training and provision of technology packages leading to income generation for farmers. Local 
54 
people, including the poor households, are expected to benefit from socio-economic opportunities 
during  the  project  implementation  and  operation  phases.  A  total  of  3,548  households  (12,261 
population)  including  1,041 poor  households (3,599  persons)  are expected to benefit from the 
project. This includes 454 households that currently farm vegetable in old land plots in irrigation 
areas and  3,094  households  that  will  be  engaged in vegetable farming  in new  land plots.  The 
project will create about 240 local jobs during construction. The project will also provide training 
to farming households to strengthen vegetable value chains. A social development action plan 
(SDAP) has been prepared based on the poverty and social analysis, with specific targets for the 
poor and vulnerable people (Table 12). The SDAP comprises necessary actions and indicators 
under each output to ensure benefit for smallholder farmers, including the poor. The SDAP also 
includes  measures  to  mitigate  social  risks.  Consultations  were  undertaken  with  stakeholders 
during project preparation and will be continued during project implementation. The consultation 
and participation plan for the project implementation stage has been included as Appendix 7. 
83. 
Gender.  The  project  is  classified  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming,  following  ADB’s 
Guidelines for Gender Mainstreaming Categories of ADB Projects (2012).  Women are actively 
involved in vegetable production and post-harvest value chain activities (vegetable pickling, jams 
and  jellies)  and  will  directly  benefit  from  the  project.  A  gender  action  plan  (GAP)  has  been 
prepared based on the gender analysis to ensure that the project contributes to improved gender 
equality. The GAP includes: (i) 100% of contracts/documents for engagement of households in 
vegetable production, including allocation of new land plots are co-signed by women; (ii) 40% of 
jobs  for  women  during  construction;  (iii)  40%  women  among  participants  during  consultations, 
50% women in awareness raising and 30-50% women in various training activities; iv) 40% of 
members and 25% of leadership positions in CGGs are women; v) 50% women among farmers 
receiving  improved  seeds  and  technology  packages;  and  vi)  specific  training  for  women  on 
vegetable processing and marketing techniques. Key gender targets have also been included in 
the design and monitoring framework. 
Capacity for Implementation and Monitoring of Social and Gender Measures. MOFALI has 
84. 
experience  in  implementation  of  ADB  projects,  including  an  ongoing  ADB-financed  vegetable 
production project. A PIU will be established under MOFALI to implement the project including 
social and gender issues. To implement social and gender measures properly, (i) the  MOFALI 
and project soums will appoint social and gender focal staff; and (ii) the PIU will include a social 
and gender consultant with an input of 12 person-months to provide training and capacity building 
to  the  focal  staff  for  implementation,  monitoring,  and  reporting  of  social  and  gender  measures 
included in the SDAP and the GAP. The terms of reference for the position are in Appendix 1.

Monitoring 
85. 
Project performance monitoring. To monitor the progress of the project in achieving the 
planned outcome  and  outputs, MOFALI  will  coordinate with the  PIU  for the  establishment  and 
maintenance  of  the  project  performance  management  system  (PPMS)—equivalent  to  the 
management information system—which will permit adequate flexibility to adopt remedial action 
regarding  project  design,  schedules,  activities,  and  development  impacts. 27  In  addition,  risk 
management  for  the  project  shall  be  incorporated  in  the  PPMS.  The  monitoring  will  cover  all 
indicators listed in the design and monitoring framework as well as the indicators reflecting the 
development results contributed by the project. The PPMS will cover the following aspects of the 
project  implementation:  (i)  project  physical  and  financial  progress;  (ii)  progress  and  results  of 
capacity development; (iii) implementation of the EMP; (iv) implementation of the GAP and SDAP; 
and (v) compliance with loan covenants (policy, financial, economic, sector, and others). 
86. 
The  MOFALI  agrees  that  they  will  (i)  establish  the  PPMS;  (ii)  recruit  the  loan 
implementation consultants to provide consulting service as described in Appendix 1; (iii) confirm 
that targets are achievable; and (iv) develop recording, monitoring, and reporting arrangements. 
87. 
At the beginning of project implementation, the PIU will finalize the comprehensive PPMS 
procedures  to  systematically  generate  data  in  the  above  areas.  The  PIU  will  refine the  PPMS 
framework,  confirm  achievable  targets  and  the  monitoring  and  recording  arrangements,  and 
establish relevant systems and procedures not later than 6 months after project implementation 
begins. The implementing agency, and the PIU will assign staff or consultants to collect baseline 
and progress data at the requisite time intervals, including progress report on the implementation 
of the EMP, GAP, and SDAP. The PIU will be responsible for analyzing and consolidating reported 
data  through  its  management  information  system,  and  reporting  outcomes  to  ADB  through 
semiannual progress reports.  
88. 
A project progress report, monitoring the project inputs and activities, should be submitted 
to  ADB  semiannually  starting  from  project  inception.  These  semiannual  progress  reports  and 
project  monitoring  and  evaluation  reports  will  provide  information  necessary  to  update  ADB‘s 
PPMS. 
Promptly after physical completion of the project, but in any event not later than 6 months 
89. 
thereafter or such later date as ADB may agree for this purpose, MOFALI will prepare and submit 
to  ADB  a  project  completion  report,  in  such  form  and  in  such  detail  as  ADB  shall  reasonably 
request,  on  the  implementation  and  evaluation  of  the  project,  including  project  description,

evaluation of design and implementation, evaluation of performance, and overall assessment and 
recommendations. 
90. 
Compliance monitoring. During project implementation, ADB and MOFALI will closely 
monitor the compliance of all the covenants under the project; and will take necessary remedy 
actions for any noncompliance. The compliance status will be reported in the semiannual progress 
report by MOFALI and will be reviewed during project review missions. 
Environmental  safeguard  monitoring.  PIU  environment  safeguards  specialist  will 
91. 
monitor the implementation of the EMP, including the GRM, and include progress as part of the 
overall reporting to the PIU. Progress reporting will be: (i) semi-annual, during construction and 
implementation of the EMP; and (ii) annual, during operation of the project facilities until issuance 
of  the  project  completion  report.  In  the  event  of  any  environmental  incidents,  accidents,  or 
complaints, the PIU will immediately report these to MOFALI, who will inform ADB. If required, 
corrective actions will be developed and agreed upon between the executing and implementing 
agencies, PIU, ADB and other relevant agencies. 
92. 
Involuntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples.  The  project  will  not  involve  any 
involuntary  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  impacts  or  any  impacts  on  communities  of 
indigenous peoples as defined under ADB SPS. No legacy issues have been found in any of the 
12  irrigation  schemes.  The  executing  and  implementing  agency  will  ensure  that  the  project 
remains  category  C  on  for  involuntary  resettlement  and  Indigenous  peoples’  impacts  and  any 
activities  that  would  trigger  ADB  safeguard  requirements  for  involuntary  resettlement  and 
Indigenous  peoples  would  not  be  included  in  the  project  scope  in  the  future.  A  resettlement 
framework  has  been  prepared  to  address  potential  temporary  impacts  particularly  in  Nogoon 
Kashaa  subproject;  and  the  project’s  progress  report  will  include  information  on  the  status  of 
implementation of the resettlement framework.  
Social and gender monitoring. Monitoring of the GAP and SDAP implementation will be 
93. 
conducted and the targets are specified in the relevant action plans, and some indicators are also 
included  in  the  design  and  monitoring  framework.  To  implement  social  and  gender  measures 
properly,  MOFALI  and  project  soums  will  appoint  social  and  gender  focal  points  for 
implementation  and  internal  social  monitoring.  A  national  social  and  gender  specialist  will  be 
engaged under the PIU. The specialist will assist the implementing agency and PIU in setting up 
effective  internal  social  and  gender  monitoring  system  and  will  provide  training  and  capacity 
building to the focal staff for implementation. Results of internal monitoring on social and gender 
measures included in the SDAP and the GAP will be reported through regular progress reports. 
C. 
Evaluation  
In addition to regular monitoring, project progress and performance will be monitored at 
94. 
least once a year jointly by ADB and MOFALI during the ADB review missions. The review will 
assess implementation performance and achievement of project outcome and outputs, assess 
financial progress, identify issues and constraints affecting implementation, and work out a time-
bound action plan for their resolution. ADB and MOFALI will undertake a midterm review in the 
mid-year of the project implementation period to (i) conduct a detailed evaluation of the project 
scope, implementation arrangements, progress of the overall project and each component, and 
status of achieving the performance targets; and (ii) recommend appropriate measures, including 
changes in the project scope and/or implementation arrangements, reallocation of loan proceeds, 
changes  in  the  ADB  financing  ratios,  and  extension  of  the  loan  closing  date.  Promptly  after 
physical completion of the project, but in any event not later than 6 months thereafter or such later 
67 
date  as  ADB  may  agree  for  this  purpose,  MOFALI  will  prepare  and  submit  to  ADB  a  project 
completion  report,  in  such  form  and  in  such  detail  as  ADB  shall  reasonably  request,  on  the 
implementation and evaluation of the project.28 
D. 
Reporting  
95.  MOFALI  will  provide  ADB  with  (i)  semiannual  progress  reports  in  a  format  that  is 
acceptable to ADB (format of the progress report included in appendix 7), including (a) progress 
achieved  by  output  as  measured  through  the  indicator's  performance  targets,  (b)  key 
implementation issues and solutions, (c) updated procurement plan, (d) compliance status with 
loan covenants, and (e) updated implementation plan for the next reporting period; (ii) audited 
annual report; (iii) consolidated financial statements; and (iv) a project completion report within 6 
months of physical completion of the project.  
96.  MOFALI has agreed on the following reporting commitments:

communities in the project areas during project implementation. Consultations will be arranged 
and facilitated by the PIU environment and social officers and PIU social and environmental focal 
staff. Methods of consultation and information disclosure may include household visits and village 
meetings. In  particular, consultations  will  be  made  with residents  living close  to the  subproject 
sites and who may be affected by construction or operational noise, dust, or other issues. Such 
communities are identified in the IEE and EMP. 
99. 
Social and gender. Consultations with communities were conducted during preparation; 
and will be continued during the implementation of the GAP, and SDAP. Project information will 
be  shared  with  communities  during  implementation,  covering  (i)  project  contents,  scope,  and 
implementation  arrangements;  (ii)  cooperation  mechanisms  for  farmers/CGGs    (iii)  local 
employment  opportunities;  (iii)  SDAP/GAP  targets;  (iv)  construction  periods  and  timing;  (v) 
Grievance  Redress  Mechanism;  and  (vi)  project  training  and  other  information.  Feedbacks 
received during consultation will be incorporated in the project design. Special attention will be 
paid  to  the  participation  of  women,  the  poor,  and  other  vulnerable  groups.  In  Sagsai  and 
Bayannuur soums (Bayan-Ulgii aimag), all meetings, activities and training to be provided in the 
presence of an interpreter; and all key project documents will be translated in Kazakh language. 
Social monitoring reports will be disclosed publicly. 
100.  Public  disclosure.  ADB,  the  government,  and  MOFALI  will  disclose  relevant  project 
information  to  the  public  and  interested  parties.  This  includes  particularly  the  information 
regarding the overall project and environment and social safeguards. The information disclosure

ANTICORRUPTION POLICY 
102.  ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any violations of the 
Anticorruption  Policy  relating  to  the  project. 29  All  contracts  financed  by  ADB  shall  include 
provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the 
executing agency and all project contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers. 
Individuals and/or entities on ADB’s anticorruption debarment list are ineligible to participate in 
the ADB-financed activity and may not be awarded any contracts under the project.30  
103.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  are  included  in  the  loan  and  project 
agreements and the bidding documents for the project.  
XI. 
ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISM 
104.  People  who  are,  or may  in the  future  be,  adversely  affected  by the  project  may  submit 
complaints  to  ADB’s  Accountability  Mechanism.  The  Accountability  Mechanism  provides  an 
independent forum and process whereby people adversely affected by the ADB-assisted projects 
can voice and seek a resolution of their problems, as well as report alleged violations of ADB’s 
operational  policies  and  procedures.  Before  submitting  a  complaint  to  the  Accountability 
Mechanism, affected people should make an effort in good faith to solve their problems by working 
with  the  concerned  ADB  operations  department.  Only  after  doing  that,  and  if  they  are  still 
dissatisfied, should they approach the Accountability Mechanism.31 
XII. 
RECORD OF CHANGES TO THE PROJECT ADMINISTRATION MANUAL 
105.  All revisions and/or updates during the course of implementation should be retained in this 
section to provide a chronological history of changes to implemented arrangements recorded in 
the  project  administration  manual,  including  revision  to  contract  awards  and  disbursement  s-
curves.

The  project  objective  is  to  increase  income  generation  and  enterprise  support  for 
smallholder  vegetable  farmers.  This  will  be  achieved  through  a  number  of  components,  most 
notably  to  upgrade  and  modernize  existing  (or  new)  government-owned  irrigation  systems 
(schemes). Support will also be provided to farmers on each scheme including: support to the 
formation  of  community  grower  groups  for  the  operation  and  maintenance  of  irrigation 
infrastructure, and the improved production and marketing of vegetables; improved access to on-
farm  infrastructure  and technology  (e.g.  seeders,  harvesters,  (conservation)  tillage  equipment, 
tube-wells, storage facilities, small-scale winter greenhouses, water-saving technologies such as 
drip irrigation technology, and community ponds / water tanks (linked to pipes, sprinklers, drop 
irrigation);  and  training  on  good  agricultural  practice  (e.g.  on  correct  use  of  pesticides  and 
fertilizers, on efficient water use,etc).

Introduction 
Contract type: Desk and field based 
Duration of assignment: upto 1 month  
Location:  List is attached. 
b. 
Background 
78. 
The  project  objective  is  to  increase  income  generation  and  enterprise  support  for 
smallholder  vegetable  farmers.  This  will  be  achieved  through  a  number  of  components,  most 
notably  to  upgrade  and  modernize  existing  (or  new)  government-owned  irrigation  systems 
(schemes). Support will also be provided to farmers on each scheme including: support to the 
formation  of  CGGs/farmer  vegetable  grower  groups  for  the  operation  and  maintenance  of 
irrigation  infrastructure,  and  the  improved  production  and  marketing  of  vegetables;  improved 
access to on-farm infrastructure and technology (e.g. seed producers, harvesters, (conservation) 
tillage  equipment,  tube-wells,  storage  facilities,  small-scale  winter  greenhouses,  water-saving 
technologies  such  as  drip  irrigation  technology,  and  community  ponds  /  water  tanks  (linked to 
pipes, sprinklers, drop irrigation), etc.); and training on good agricultural practice (e.g. on correct 
use  of  pesticides  and  fertilizers,  on  efficient  water  use,  etc.).  Project  investments  in  irrigation 
infrastructure will safeguarded by investments into shelter belts (tree windbreaks) surrounding the 
irrigated area.  
c. 
Objective 
The main  objective  of  the  Detailed Irrigation  Scheme  Design  is to assess  the technical 
79. 
feasibility of proposed works and to prepare detailed designs ready for construction.  
d. 
Scope of Work  
Scheme  Investigation.  On the  base  of  the  review  of  the  feasibility  study  report  of  the 
80. 
proposed irrigation schemes the further following detailed activities are to be undertaken: 
Appendix 1 
95 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
Discussion  with  Aimag  and/or  Soum  Governments  to  confirm  the  overall  scope 
and objectives for the proposed scheme. 
Site inspections and determination of optimal options and constraints to be taken 
into account when formulating the scheme (see provisional proposed design). 
Soil testing/verification – take representative soil samples to depth to be evaluated 
for water holding capacity, minerals/salts composition, structure and suitability for 
particular crops, to root zone depth + 1 m (auger holes and graded samples for 
examination and testing). 
(v) 
(vi) 
(vii) 
(viii) 
(iv)  Water  source  evaluation/verification  –  hydrology  to  confirm  water  source  flow 
regime  and  variance  through  the  growing  season,  water  quality  and  possible 
variance through the growing season, and identification of any salinity risks, and 
potential constraints to particular crops. 
Confirmation  of  planned  cropping  pattern  (broad  area,  row  crop,  vegetables, 
greenhouses), and based on climate, soils water holding capacity, rainfall pattern 
and drainage/flood factors, determine the water demand pattern over the growing 
season for each crop, and aggregated for the overall scheme. 
On the basis of crops, soils, and provisional design identify the optimal irrigation 
systems to be adopted – open canal or piped conveyance, surface, sprinkler or 
drip irrigation, application rates for efficient land and crop watering between soil 
moisture depletion limit and adopted full capacity limit (circa 30% to 85%, specifics 
to be confirmed). 
Assess and set the water supply pattern against the crop water demand pattern, 
allowing  for  all  system  inefficiencies  (conveyance,  application,  storage)  and 
modify/improve  the  scale  (if  any)  of  required  balancing  water  storage(s)  to  be 
incorporated on the supply side, and the optimal location related to whether gravity, 
low  pressure  or  pressurized  system  irrigation  to  be  adopted  (for  sprinkler,  drip, 
micro-spray). 
Implement a detailed examination of the planned intake area (river, intake location, 
main  canal  alignment)  and  consider  whether  optimal  for  appropriate  sediment 
management and exclusion, pre-intake or post intake (or both), whether specific 
works  are  required  to  ensure  river  flow  (environmental  flow  maintained)  to  the 
intake at all times (low flows particularly, but sufficient for capture of high flows to 
storage, with passage of major floods safely away from the intake). 
In  settling  on  the  broad  intake  requirements  and  location,  check  to  see  if  any 
alternative  site  options  are  available,  and  whether  these  might  provide  any 
advantage  for  safer  and  more  certain  water  intake,  sediment  management, 
provision of pressure (if main canal is pipeline). 
In  determining  the  form  of  intake  and  associated  works,  make  allowance  and 
consideration for the impacts of snow/ice on the structures and fixtures (gates, stop 
logs, sluices etc.). 
Complete the assessment with a pros and cons decision matrix.  
Prepare  detailed  designs  and  cost  estimates  to  inform  intake  site  and  size 
selection  (river  works,  intake  with  flow  control  (gates,  sluice)  and  sediment 
management, storage tank (if needed) and main canal (or pipe).  
Include costs estimates for all appurtenant control and safety infrastructure (gated 
sluices, overspill weir and channel, as needed for safety, protection of works, and 
long term safe and durable operation). 
(xi) 
(xii) 
(xiii) 
(ix) 
(x) 
(xiv)  Confirm the main canal (or pipeline) alignment, whether to be lined canal or buried 
pipe (depth), and scope and cost all details and requirements up to and including 
the first bifurcation (whether to distributary canal/pipe) or into balancing storage. 
96 
Appendix 1 
(xv)  Scale,  design  and  cost  all  required  storage  tanks,  inclusive  of  effective 
inflow/outflow  control  structures,  and  any  details  for  periodic  sediment  flushing 
and/or removal. It is suggested that such storage be provided with from 10 to 15% 
additional  dead  storage  ‘depth’  to  accommodate  any  entrained  sediment, 
especially where using open channel conveyance.  
(xvi)  Design siting and setting levels for storage that could enable periodic flushing of 
sediment to drains, or else if fine sediment, whether this could be useful as added 
value topsoil in vegetable areas. 
(xvii)  Prepare  Technical  Specifications  and  BoQ;  prepare  cost  estimations  (unit  rate 
breakdown by  resources  and summarized unit rates);  and  develop  detailed  and 
general specifications of bidding documents and Section 6 of Bidding Documents. 
Technical specifications shall include general instructions and recommendations 
for  the  contractor  (bidders)  as  well  as  detailed  specifications  (specifying  all 
mandatory standards) for controlling materials used, methods of work performance 
and quality. 
81. 
The important part of the detailed design is to design on whether the scheme is to be:  
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
surface irrigation;  
sprinkler system;  
drip/micro-spray system; or  
a combination scheme, with two or more of these types.  
The main differences to consider in selecting the appropriate technical irrigation system 
82. 
for the schemes (in logical sequence) are:  
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
(v) 
(vi) 
(vii) 
(viii) 
suitability for landform, and required or acceptable water application rates;  
suitability of the area and soils for the planned crops;  
areas of the planned scheme, for vegetables, greenhouse, row crops or large area 
crops;  
the required application efficiency (depends if water is limiting);  
pressure requirements and this is to be provided (gravity pipeline, pumps) for the 
particular irrigation system;  
power requirements and costs, if pumping is required;  
operation  and  maintenance  requirements  (labor,  durability,  recurrent  costs)  to 
ensure long term sustainability of the project (infrastructure, equipment, land/soil 
condition); 
any requirements for crop handling, storage and/or processing at site in readiness 
for market or consumption; 
83. 
Taking these factors in turn: 
(i) 
Surface system 
a) 
b) 
Water source – catchment and management for low to flood flows; 
Intake  structure  –  diversion,  sediment  management,  flow  regulation  and 
protection; 
Main  canal  –  lined  or  unlined,  graded  or  as  per  contour,  velocity 
management  for  self-cleaning  and/or  non-scour  (if  unlined)  and  energy 
control  (intermediate  structures  –  drops,  bifurcations,  gated  or  ungated), 
sediment exclusion and/or management as part of long-term operations; 
Storage  –  is  some  short  term  off-stream,  on-stream  storage  needed  to 
balance source supply against irrigation demand; in river, at headworks, or 
near command area (1 or more storages) to be matched against particular

sub-area  and  crop  requirements,  safety  escape  and  flow  management 
works around or through the irrigated area; 
Distributary canals – open ditches, graded, control structures, alignments, 
land  block  sizes,  regular  or  irregular,  needs  to  isolate  some  parts  of  the 
scheme  from  other  areas  due  to  different  crops  and  growing  seasons 
(generally in consideration of the broader operation of irrigation for effective 
crop production in the command areas); 
Drainage requirements within the irrigation command area for storm runoff 
and/or safe passage of excess irrigation supply water; 
Flood protection  requirements  –  against meandering river flows  (normal, 
flood)  and  overland  runoff  from  storms,  with  safe  passage  around  the 
irrigated area and away from critical infrastructure (intake, canals, storages, 
drains); 
Location  and  provisions for  moving  harvest  and other  equipment  around 
and over key infrastructure (culverts, bridges etc.) and general access for 
farmers without damaging constructed works; 
Sprinkler system 
a) 
irrigation  performance  requirements  across 
Many  of  the  points  mentioned  for  surface  systems  may  be  relevant  for 
sprinkler system installations so review and design accordingly; 
Identify  the  optimal  form  of  irrigation  equipment  required  to  match  area, 
the 
crop,  and  general 
command  area  (soils,  infiltration  rates,  runoff  on  slopes,  range  of  soil 
moisture profile and application rates to be adopted); 
Ensure adequacy of water supply to match equipment water delivery rate 
– whether open canals to sump, canal to storage pond, pipes and pumping 
rates etc.; 
Ensure adequate provision in water supply system to remove any harmful 
sediment, with effective settlement, flushing and safe disposal away from 
the irrigation infrastructure; 
Assess  power  requirements  and  make  estimates  for  appropriate  power 
supply and resourcing, fuel storage etc. as may be required (power lines, 
fuel  tanks,  hard  standing,  engine  set  ups  and  connections  required  for 
equipment to work reliably as required; 
Consider needs for draining equipment, storing over winter, servicing and 
maintenance, with provision and handling of critical parts; 
Ensure  irrigation  layout  is  optimized  for  the  particular  types  of  irrigation 
equipment to be used; 
Consider  what  monitoring  and  warning  systems  are  needed  for  safe 
operation and protection of the equipment; 
Assess  any  special  training  that  is  needed,  and  how  many  trainees  are 
required  for  the  mode  of  operation  (part  time,  full  time,  fixed  system  or 
mobile system that has to be moved periodically between irrigated areas). 
Again,  some  aspects  of  the  irrigations  systems  for  surface  and  sprinkler 
may have relevance for installing and operating drip systems, so refer to 
the above and take into account as necessary when preparing designs; 
Take  note  of  any  particular  scheme  layout  and  grading  requirements  to 
even out pressure variance in drip lines; 
Ensure clean water will be supplied to the drip system intake sump, and 
allow  for  flushable micro-filter  systems  on the  suction  side;  with  this  and 
pumps installed in a suitably sized protected shed, with flushing drainage

The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  is  supporting  the  Government  of  Mongolia  to 
88. 
implement the Vegetable Production and Irrigated Agriculture Project. The project will establish 
or  revitalize  agricultural  production  in  12  subproject  locations  in  central,  eastern,  and  western 
Mongolia.  Several  of  the  subprojects  will  be  located  close  to  rivers  or  shallow  groundwater 
aquifers, and there is a risk that project operations could lead to water contamination e.g. from 
the use of agricultural chemicals. A national firm with certified monitoring capacity will be recruited 
to conduct water quality monitoring for these subprojects. The firm will be recruited through the 
project executing agency, the Ministry of Agriculture and Light Industry (MOFALI), and work under 
the coordination of the project implementation unit (PIU). The firm will liaise with aimag (province) 
and soum (district) governments and other stakeholders as needed to develop and implement the 
program.  
100

Qualifications 
89. 
National firm, intermittent over 6 years, annual field assignments. The firm will have: (i) 
relevant  domestic  certification  for  the  design  and  implementation  of  water  quality  monitoring 
programs; (ii) staff with undergraduate degrees (postgraduate is preferred) in hydrology, water 
resources management, wastewater monitoring and treatment, and/or related field; (iii) at least 
10 years demonstrated experience in the design and implementation of water quality monitoring 
programs to high standards; (iv) the necessary resources and equipment to collect and analyze 
water  samples,  especially  for  a  range  of  pollution  parameters;  (v)  established  professional 
networks  with  key  monitoring  and  research  agencies  in  Mongolia  that  may  be  involved  in  the 
project,  including  the  Information  and  Research  Institute  of  Meteorology,  Hydrology  and 
Environment (IRIMHE) and National University of Mongolia (NUM); and (vi) experience in capacity 
building and training of other agencies and personnel. Proposals that include collaboration with 
monitoring and research agencies, local groups, and/or civil society organizations will be highly 
regarded.  Basic  command  of  English  by  the  nominated  staff  will  be  an  advantage.  Under  the 
supervision  of  the  PIU  coordinator  and  field  coordinator,  the  firm  will  design  and  implement  a 
water quality monitoring program tailored to detecting water contamination that may occur from 
operation of the subprojects specified below. The assignment will comprise a single lump-sum 
contract that is expected to support all costs (including staff, resources, analyses, reporting, and 
travel) to conduct the following. 
(i) 
Design  and  implement  a  water  quality  monitoring  program  that  is  as  simple  and  cost-
effective  as  possible  to  measure  whether  the  following  subprojects  are  causing  water 
contamination as a result of operational activities, specifically including the use of fertilizers 
and/or pesticides: 
For  surface  water  quality  –  4  subprojects:  Yolton,  Iven  Gol,  Dulaanii  Tal,  Sugunur. 
Rationale: subproject operations will be close (<100 m) to river, and/or additional fertilizer 
will be added as part of operations due to low soil nutrient levels. Anticipated method: 2 
monitoring points: 100 m and 500 m downstream of subproject.  
For  groundwater  quality  –  3  subprojects:  Tsul-Ulaan,  Khuren  Tal,  Nogoon  Khashaa. 
Rationale:  subproject  operations  will  be  close  to  shallow  aquifers.  Anticipated  method: 
minimum of 1 monitoring point (well or borehole) per subproject, downstream of subproject 
site. 
(ii) 
Parameters to monitor should include nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorous levels, and, 
the detection of pesticides. The selection of specific pesticides to be tested for should be 
identified by the firm based on consultations with the PIU, soum governments and farmers 
on  the most  commonly used (if  any)  pesticides and/or  professional  estimation of  which 
pesticides are most likely to be used, based on national regulations and common practice 
in other agricultural areas.  
(iii)  Monitoring  will  be  conducted  at  least  annually.  The  first  monitoring  session  will  be 
conducted prior to any project works and will establish a baseline. Subsequent monitoring 
will be conducted in August or September – to coincide with the growing season – and the 
results compared with national water quality standards. 
(iv) 
The program will include specific monitoring locations, sampling frequency (sufficient to 
provide  a rigorous  baseline  against  which to measure project  efforts),  a consistent  and 
Appendix 1 
101 
replicable method for sampling and analysis, key stakeholders, roles and responsibilities, 
and costs. 
(v) 
(vi) 
The program will be designed to be as simple and low cost as possible, in order to increase 
the likelihood of successful handover and sustainability after the consultancy is completed. 
Early in the consultancy, identify potential agencies that may take over the program after 
the project and assess their financial and technical capacity and resources to undertake 
such works. 
(vii)  Establish  a  program  database,  in  a  format  that  is  (i)  accessible  to  the  executing  and 
implementing agencies, (ii) compatible with the monitoring databases of IRIMHE, and (iii) 
enables  statistical  analyses,  including  the  rapid  preparation  of  summary  statistics  for 
reporting. 
(viii)  Prepare  a  monitoring  manual  in  Mongolian  and  English  language  that  describes  all 
aspects of the program and is a reference guide for all stakeholders. 
(ix) 
(x) 
(xi) 
In the event that monitoring detects water contamination, immediately inform the executing 
agency and PIU, so that these agencies can initiate corrective actions with the relevant 
subproject stakeholders. 
Provide capacity building in water quality monitoring tailored to the  agency that is most 
likely  to  take  over  the  program  after  completion  of  the  consultancy,  through  training 
sessions and involving them in the field sampling, analyses and reporting. 
Collaborate  with  local  schools,  NUM,  Mongolian  Academy  of  Sciences  and/or  other 
relevant civil society organizations to facilitate their involvement in the program, including 
the possibility of student studies which complement the program. 
(xii)  With  the  executing  agency  and  PIU,  prepare  a  clear  hand-over  strategy  for  the  water 
quality  monitoring  program.  This  will  include  costs,  proposed  financing  source, 
recommended  agency(s)  to  continue  the  program  after  project  completion,  and 
assessment of their existing technical and financial capacity and resources to continue to 
program.

13.  National Biodiversity Specialist for Ecological Survey of Okhindiin Tal Subproject: 
(CS-20) 
96. 
The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  is  supporting  the  Government  of  Mongolia  to 
implement the Vegetable Production and Irrigated Agriculture Project. The project will establish 
or  revitalize  agricultural  production  in  12  subproject  locations  in  central,  eastern,  and  western 
Mongolia. One of the subprojects is the Okhindiin Tal subproject in Selenge  Aimag (province). 
The subproject area comprises existing agricultural and pasture land within a delta between the 
Selenge and Orkhon rivers. The entire subproject is located within an internationally designated 
Important Bird and Biodiversity Area (IBBA): MN054 Delta of Orkhon and Selenge Rivers (26,800 
ha). The IBBA supports: (i) seasonal and/or breeding populations of at least globally threatened 
bird species – Swan Goose Anser cygnoides, Baikal Teal Anas Formosa, Lesser Kestrel Falco 
naumanni, and Great Bustard Otis tarda; (ii) at least 1% of the East Asian-Australasian Migratory 
Bird Flyway populations of at least five bird species: Bean Goose Anser fabalis, Greylag Goose 
A. answer, Ruddy Shelduck Tadorna ferruginea, and Demoiselle Crane Anthropoides virgo; (iii) 
nationally threatened mammal species, including Red Fox Vulpes vulpes, Corsac Fox V. corsac, 
Grey Wolf Canis lupus and Siberian Marmot Marmota sibirica; and (iv) nationally threatened fish 
species  including  Mongolian  Grayling  Thymallus  revirostris,  Lenok  Brachymystax  lenok  and 
Taimen Hucho taimen. 
97. 
Activities  for  the  proposed  subproject  comprise  the  establishment  of  a  new  “command 
area”  (the  area  under  irrigation)  of  2,700  ha  on  current  pastureland,  to  improve  pasture 
management and cereal, vegetable and fruit growing. The main characteristics of the new scheme 
will be: water extraction directly by pump into a main canal thence by gravity to balancing storage, 
pump, pipes, command area by sprinkler and drip.  
98. 
Although the subproject site is located on existing agricultural land, Google Earth imagery 
and  comparison  of  the  IBBA  and  subproject  areas  indicate  that  (i)  the  subproject  is  within  the 
Appendix 1 
103 
IBBA,  and (ii)  the  subproject  area  encompasses  at  least  one main tributary  and many  smaller 
waterways. These waterways may support wet meadows, marshes, and other wetland habitats, 
and biodiversity values that are part of the overall IBBA values. Under the ADB Safeguard Policy 
(SPS,  2009),  these  habitats  may  qualify  as  ‘critical  habitat’  e.g.  “sites  that  are  critical  for  the 
survival  of  migratory  species”  and/or  “areas  supporting  globally  significant  concentrations  or 
numbers of individuals of congregatory species”. 
99. 
There is limited available data on the ecological values of the IBBA in general and of the 
subproject area specifically. The technical designs for the subproject are at the preliminary stage 
of development (detailed engineering designs have not yet been prepared). There is insufficient 
data  to  ascertain  whether  the  subproject  area  qualifies  as  critical  habitat  and  to  conduct  an 
ecological  impact  assessment  for  the  subproject.  The  SPS  requires  that  “when  the  project 
involves  activities  in  a  critical  habitat,  the  borrower/client  will  retain  qualified  and  experienced 
external experts to assist in conducting the assessment”. 
100.  One national migratory waterbirds biodiversity specialist is required to implement a eight-
week  consultancy,  including  a  four-week  field  survey  in  September  (presumed  to  be  peak 
migration season). The key objective of the survey is to assess the ecological significance of the 
area for migratory waterbirds and other biodiversity, including its global and national significance; 
and  to  conduct  an  ecological  impact  assessment  of  the  proposed  subproject  construction  and 
operation, to inform the detailed engineering designs. The findings will assist the Government and 
ADB in making a determination on the presence of “critical habitat” as defined under the SPS, 
and appropriate mitigation and management responses for any potential project impacts. 
101.  The specialists will be recruited by the Ministry of Agriculture and Light Industry (MOFALI, 
the  executing  agency),  through  the  project  implementation  unit  (PIU).  It  is  anticipated  the 
specialist  will  be  joined  in  the  field  for  some  of  the  time  by  the  PIU  Environment  Safeguard 
Specialist, soum environment officers, and other personnel as needed. 
102.  The  national  specialist  will  have:  (i)  demonstrated  experience  in  the  survey  and 
conservation  of  fauna  in  Mongolia,  especially  birds  and  mammals,  but  with  strong  working 
knowledge of fish and amphibians as well; (ii) demonstrated experience in environmental impact 
assessment, focusing specifically on issues related to ecology and biodiversity management; (iii) 
a postgraduate degree and/or equivalent experience in biology/ecology; (iv) demonstrated ability 
to work effectively in teams, analyse data, and prepare reports; and (v) proficiency in spoken and 
written  English.  The  specialist  will  supply  their  own  technical  equipment  for  their  use  (e.g. 
telescope, binoculars, field guide, GPS). 
103.  The specialist will do the following: 
(i)  Design and implement a two-week waterbird survey, to be conducted in May 2020, in the 
subproject area and overall IBBA. The survey design will reflect what can be achieved in 
the  two-week  period  and  given  the  number  of  team  members  (assumed  to  be  2  to  5), 
resources, and the need to ensure that at least one person skilled in waterbird census and 
identification  is  present  in  each survey  group.  The  design  will  ensure  that representative 
areas  of  the  IBBA  can  be  surveyed  as  well  as  the  subproject  area,  to  enable  site 
comparisons. 
(ii)  Be responsible for the daily collection and entry of field data, including quality control for 
count data and species identification. 
104 
Appendix 1 
(iii)  Document and describe the current management status of the IBBA, including the presence 
of any local protected areas and/or plans for protection or Ramsar designation. This may 
include:  (a)  master  plans  (if  any);  (b)  existing  management  zones  and  regulations;  (c) 
existing operations, including park infrastructure, staff, management activities, monitoring, 
reporting,  and  budget;  (d)  the  stated  values  of  the  park,  including  hydrological  function, 
ecology,  biodiversity,  recreation  and  education;  (e)  existing  threats  and  management 
issues. 
(iv)  Assess  the  global  and  national  significance  of  the  subproject  project  area  based  on 
established  international  criteria,  including  the  determination  of  wetlands  of  international 
importance  under  the  Ramsar  Convention,  and  other  relevant  national  and  international 
criteria and agreements for the conservation and protection of waterbirds.  
(v)  Review the preliminary technical designs for the subproject. 
(vi)  Assess potential impacts from the subproject construction and operation to the ecological 
and biodiversity values within and adjacent to the subproject area, and to the IBBA overall. 
The  impact  assessment  will  consider  impacts  at  different  scales  e.g.  national  and 
international, to place the scale of impacts in context.  
(vii)  Assess the extent to which the project design could be improved to avoid or reduce impacts 
to the documented ecological values. 
(viii)  Develop mitigation measures to avoid and/or reduce potential subproject impacts, focusing 
especially  on  sites  of  highest  ecological  value.  This  might  include,  but  not  be  limited  to: 
offsite measures; subproject operational procedures to ensure that farmers and other on-
site  personnel  do  not  impact  nearby  ecological  values  (e.g.  nesting  waterbirds);  a 
biodiversity conservation action plan for the subproject. Proactive measures that contribute 
to the protection of the overall IBBA area will be well regarded.  
(ix)  Work  with  the  detailed  design  engineers,  to  assess  whether  designs  can  be  modified  to 
avoid, reduce, or mitigate potential ecological impacts of the subproject. 
(x)  Assess  the  net  (residual)  impacts  assuming  that  the  identified  mitigation  measures  are 
implemented. Facilitate discussions with the Government and ADB to assess the extent of 
these net impacts and their implications under national regulations and ADB’s SPS. 
(xi)  Design  a  six-year  waterbird  monitoring  program,  using  a  Before-After-Control-Impact 
(BACI)  framework,  to  assess  construction  and  operation  impacts  of  the  project.  The 
program will focus on comparing seasonal species richness and abundance of migratory 
waterbirds  (waterfowl,  waders)  in the  subproject area (the  impact  site)  with  nearby IBBA 
areas (the control site). 
(xii)  Develop recommendations, including time-based next steps. 
(xiii)  Prepare a report on the findings. 
(xiv) 
Design  a  survey  for  other  fauna,  to  be  conducted  in  parallel  with  the  waterbird 
survey, for mammals and amphibians. This might include a combination of systematic field 
surveys, consultations with residents, and desktop review. 
Appendix 1 
105 
(xv) 
Conduct original field work, data collection and analyses as necessary and realistic 
within the time available to address major information gaps or shortcomings in domestic 
studies. Undertake the majority of fieldwork and coordination required for the tasks of the 
national and international environment specialists. 
(xvi) 
For any key information gaps that cannot reasonably be addressed with the time 
and resources available, discuss these with the international specialist and ADB as soon 
as possible so that solutions can be discussed. 
(xvii) 
Assess the extent to which the project design could be improved to avoid or reduce 
impacts to the documented ecological values. 
104.  Deliverable 1: a report addressing the outputs above, in a digital format agreed with ADB 
and the Government. A draft report will first be provided to ADB for review. The report will 
include: 
•  review of existing data and description of survey methods, including a map of survey sites; 
•  survey results, including analysis of count numbers by site and broad habitat, and all raw 
data (summarized in an appendix); 
•  an  estimate(s)  of  the  total  number  of  migratory  waterbirds  which  visited  the  study  area 
over  the  two-week  survey  period,  with  clear  description  of  definitions  and  assumptions 
used to derive these estimates; 
•  identification of any species found in the study area that are listed under the IUCN Red 
List  of  Threatened  Species,  Mongolian  Red  Data  Book,  or  other  relevant  national 
regulations or international agreements; 
•  an  assessment  of  the  significance  of  the  subproject  area  with  respect  to  established 
international criteria including the documented conservation values of the IBBA and criteria 
of the Ramsar Convention; 
•  a  five-year  waterbird  monitoring  program,  designed  to  monitor  the  impacts  of  the

APPENDIX 3: SUBPROJECT SELECTION CRITERIA AND GUIDING PRINCIPLES 
A. 
Introduction 
The  project  aims  to  upgrade  and  modernize  existing  irrigation  systems  with  a  primary 
1. 
focus to improve water management to enhance agricultural production in selected schemes. In 
particular, the emphasis is to increase vegetable production to meet increasing national demand 
and  reduce  reliance  on  imports.  Current  annual  vegetable  production  is  about  54%  of 
requirements and, with population growth, this proportion is likely to decline without appropriate 
investment in improved irrigation and crop production technologies. 
2. 
Mongolia has a history of developed irrigated agriculture, which is reported to have worked 
well under the old soviet style practices through to the end of the 1980s. With the decline of the 
soviet system, and introduction of democracy, the government opted to sell off the old collective 
irrigation farms to farmers (groups) and/or new enterprises forming post centralized management. 
The  decentralization  did  not  result  in  stronger  self-managed  irrigated  farms  as  expected,  and 
during  the  transition,  many  of  the  assets  of  the  irrigation  schemes  were  sold  off  rather  than 
retained  and  utilized.  The  consequence  is  that  now  irrigated  agriculture  has  declined,  many 
schemes are stripped of physical assets (fixed and moveable) and many of the schemes have 
ceased crop production. 
Under the propose project,34 the Government of Mongolia aims to upgrade and modernize 
3. 
selected  schemes  that  have  been  returned  to  government  ownership,  working  with  interested 
farmers  to  restore  them  to  optimal  production.  With  a  primary  focus  to  increase  vegetable 
production, efforts will also be made to rebuild fodder and cereal production on suitable land to 
support the large livestock industry across the country.

Overall Process 
4. 
There are over 380 irrigation schemes of varying size in Mongolia. From this long-list of 
potential projects presented through the Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Light Industry (MOFALI) 
by  soum  and  aimag  governments,  a  short-list  of  48  schemes  was  agreed  between  the  Asian 
Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  the  EA  with  the  assistance  of  the  technical  assistance  (TA) 
consultant  (Table  1).  Forty-eight  schemes  were  identified  for  further  study.  Most  of  them  are 
located across the Western, Central and Eastern Regions of Mongolia, and have been reviewed 
and inspected during project preparation.  
5. 
Based on review and inspection, a list of 17 priority schemes was prepared (Table 1). The 
primary criteria for priority selection were: (i) smallholder farmers’ access to irrigated land through 
a  transparent  and  fair  land  lease  distribution  system;  (ii)  public  ownership  of  irrigation 
infrastructure  with  no  resettlement  issues  (Cat  C  only);  (iii)  reliable  water  source  in  terms  of 
quantity and quality; (iv) market access with at least 9% economic return on project investment; 
(v) no significant or irreversible environment issues: (Cat B and C only) with sustainable water 
resource use. Of 17 irrigation schemes selected as first priority for feasibility and environmental 
studies prior to inclusion in the project, 10 are located in the Western Region, 5 in the Central 
Region and 2 in the Eastern Region (Table 1). The list was reviewed and agreed during the interim 
review mission for project preparation.

6. 
Three of the prioritized irrigation schemes were defined as representative subprojects for 
which  detailed  feasibility  studies  and  environmental  baseline  studies  would  be  contracted  to 
licensed companies during project preparation. The schemes are: 
Appendix 3 
119 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
Boomin  Am  irrigation  scheme  in  Altai  Soum  of  Khovd  Aimag  of  the  Western 
Region, an existing small scheme with a designed area of 300 ha out of a potential 
of  700  ha  but  no  plan  for  expansion  under  the  current  project.  The  scheme  is 
considered  representative  of  small  schemes  that  will  be  upgraded  under  the 
project. 
Khuren Tal irrigation scheme in Telmen Soum of Zavkhan Aimag in the Western 
Region,  an  existing  medium  scheme  with  a  designed  area  of  200  ha  out  of  a 
potential 3,000 ha and with plans for expansion to 500 ha under the current project. 
The scheme is considered representative of medium to large schemes that will be 
upgraded under the project. 
Okhindin  Tal  irrigation  scheme  in  Zuunburen  Soum  of  Selenge  Aimag  of  the 
Central Region, a new large scheme for which 3,000 ha out of potential 12,000 ha 
is  planned  for  development  under  the  project.  The  scheme  is  considered 
representative of new schemes that will be developed under the project, of which 
there are three. 
During  preparation  of  the  feasibility  study  report  four  schemes  were  identified  as  being 
7. 
unsuitable for inclusion in the project and were therefore dropped. Three schemes, Ulaantolgoi in 
the  Western  Region,  Tsagaan  Tolgoi  in  the  Central  Region,  and  Kherlen  Bayan-Ulaan  in  the 
Eastern Region were dropped due to social issues, specifically that the land is currently occupied 
by a few large companies, although in some cases it is rented to individual farm households on an 
annual  basis,  and  there  is  no  guarantee  that  the  land  will  be  available  to  for  farmers  following 
upgrading. One scheme, Ulaantolgoi in the Central Region, was dropped due to the very poor water 
quality, which impacts on vegetable quality and would trigger environmental concerns. 
8. 
All  five  irrigation  schemes,  Ulaantolgoi  and  Khoid  gol  in  the  Western  Region,  Tsagaan 
Tolgoi and Ulaantolgoi in the Central Region, Kherlen Bayan-Ulaan in the Eastern Region, that 
had to be dropped after the interim mission due to budget limitations or not meeting the selection 
criteria  can  be  considered  during  project  implementation  in  case  budget  is  available  and  the 
conditions of the irrigation schemes changed to that selection criteria can be met.  
9. 
A  quick  feasibility  study  and  collection  of  data  required  for  ADB’s  initial  environmental 
examination were undertaken by the TA Consultant for the remaining 10 subprojects. EBAs will 
be conducted for these during project implementation. Detailed design and national environmental 
impact assessments, as required, will be conducted for all subprojects included in the project. 
Subsequently one subproject, Khoid gol, was dropped from the final project preparation 
10. 
due to financial constraints. 
3.  
Subproject Selection Criteria 
11. 
A final list of 12 irrigation schemes for project support was selected based on further field 
visits for due diligence (Table 2). The four irrigation schemes, Ulaantolgoi in the Western Region, 
Tsagaan  Tolgoi  in  the  Central  Region,  Kherlen  Bayan-Ulaan  in  the  Eastern  Region,  and 
Ulaantolgoi in the Central Region that had to be dropped due to budget limitations or not meeting 
the selection criteria can be considered during project implementation in case budget is available 
and the conditions of the irrigation schemes changed to that selection criteria can be met.

Technical Guiding Principles – Subprojects 
12. 
Technical  guiding  principles  required  to  ensure  priority  subprojects  fulfil  development 
objectives  include  (i)  developing  efficient  and  climate-resilient  irrigation  infrastructure;  (ii) 
promoting  improved  climate  smart  agriculture  production  systems;  and  (iii)  modernizing 
agricultural  production.  Further  information  on  these  technical  guiding  principles  are  detailed 
below. 
1.  
Developing Efficient and Climate-Resilient Irrigation Infrastructure 
Technical guiding principles related to developing efficient and climate-resilient irrigation 
13. 
infrastructure include: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
(v) 
(vi) 
Improved  and  reliable  access  to  a  reliable  water  source,  which  predominantly 
means  perennial rivers flowing  due to  upstream snow melt  and/or  rainfall  runoff 
throughout the growing season; 
Improved  surface  water  source  headworks  with  controlled  intakes,  sediment 
exclusion/management  and  protection  from  flood  (river  flows  and/or  overland 
runoff) to feed secure and durable main supply canals or pipes to efficiently convey 
water  to  the  irrigated  command  area  (for  various  crops  and  cropping  pattern 
defined in the FSRs and preliminary design details); 
Improved command area water distribution and on-farm water application methods 
appropriate to the terrain, crops and water source, lifting overall water conveyance 
and water use efficiency in the irrigation scheme; 
Appropriate  irrigated  area  protection  works  against  short-term  flood  impacts 
(intense  rainfall  runoff  events),  and  potential  wind  erosion  (provision  of 
windbreaks); 
Inclusion,  if  and  where  necessary,  of  appropriate  drainage  works  and  capacity 
particularly  for  safe  passage  of  overland  runoff  around  or  through  the  irrigated 
command areas; 
Adoption of relevant irrigation equipment, where required, to optimize water use 
efficiency on permeable soils when high water use efficiency would be unattainable 
if relying solely on surface water application; 
Appendix 3 
121 
(vii) 
(viii) 
(ix) 
(x) 
(xi) 
(xii) 
Adoption of improved soil moisture monitoring to guide irrigation scheduling and 
water  applications  that  more  appropriately  keep  soil  moisture  between  soil 
saturation  and  excessive depletion,  thus  reducing  the  risk  for  crop  waterlogging 
and/or extended water stress that could impede crop growth and yield; 
Inclusion of water storage facilities to minimize drought risk for crops between the 
early spring snow melt runoff and the late summer rainfall period; 
Incorporation of  sediment  exclusion/management  and  disposal  features  into  the 
design to mitigate regular maintenance requirements, risks for reduced irrigation 
system  capacity  over  time,  and  ensure  water  availability  for  crops  when  water 
source flows decline between spring melt and summer rains; 
Inclusion  of  flow  control  mechanisms  (gated  canal  and  outlet  structures,  piped 
system  valves,  and  overflow  safety  release  outlets,  as  required,  to  ensure  the 
sustainable  use  of  the  irrigation  infrastructure  with  optimized  system  operations 
and water use efficiency; 
Provisions within the canal/pipe network to facilitate effective drainage ahead of 
winter conditions; and 
Effective water capture and use from overland runoff where feasible to supplement 
the main supply from the primary water source (river or springs). 
2.  
Promoting Improved Climate Smart Agriculture Production Systems

14. 
production systems include: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
(v) 
(vi) 
(vii) 
Assessing the risks for altered river flows and rainfall runoff change in the event of 
specified changes in rainfall, temperature and other climate related factors, as per 
the  indicators  on  climate  change  identified  for  the  locations  of  the  irrigation 
schemes; 
Consideration  of  the  possible  impacts  on  scheme  water  use  efficiency,  scheme 
size  and  crop  mix  that  is  possible  both  now  and,  if  expected  climate  change 
scenarios occur, in the future and ensure scheme scale and details remain viable 
under expected climate change scenarios; 
For mitigation of excessive water use and system losses, assess the benefits for 
and  adopt  modernization  plans  for  the  irrigation  systems  through  a  switch  from 
surface irrigation to more technically efficient sprinkler or drip systems as may be 
best suited to defined crops and soils, whether in part or the whole of the irrigation 
system command area; 
Consideration  of  the  possibility  for,  and  interest  of,  participating  communities  to 
adopt a changed crop mix and cropping pattern under expected climate change 
conditions for the irrigation system; 
Allowing for the adverse consequences and need for managing excessive runoff 
around and across the irrigation system command area that arises in the event of 
more  intense  storm  events  –  both  potential  to  capture  water  for  use  within  the 
scheme,  and  also  evacuation  through  drainage  of  any  short-term  flooding  that 
could be deleterious to the crop; 
Assessment  of  whether  any  adverse  climate  change  impacts  might  mean  that 
some crops would not be sustainable within the irrigation system; and 
Assessment on whether climate change extremes might necessitate altered crop 
seasons,  varieties,  harvesting  schedules  and  crop  handling/storage  to  optimize 
market benefits.

Assess potential for introduction of greenhouse vegetable production to extend the 
vegetable production season for greenhouse and field transplanted vegetables; 
Promote  linkages  to  the  seed  systems  to  promote  the  use  of  best  available 
varieties  from  the  Mongolian  seed  system  to  improve  climatic  adaptation  and 
resilience in production; 
Assess the potential for technical/extension support available at aimag and soum 
to introduce water efficient irrigation for greenhouse and field vegetable production 
including drip and sprinkle irrigation to improve water use efficiency and limit salting 
in susceptible areas; 
Assess the ability of the technical/extension support available at aimag and soum 
to  support  the  adoption  of  machinery  to  increase  production  efficiency  through 
improved timeliness of operations and improved labor efficiency; 
Assess  the  resources  available  to  increase  farmer  understanding  of  farming 
practices  through  training  in  production  in  association  with  other  vegetable 
production projects; 
Assess  aimag  and  soum  resources  to  manage  local  storage  facilities  and  to 
increase the understanding of vegetable storage practices and use of local storage 
facilities to improve farmer returns; 
(vii)  Support  soil  conservation  practices  to  improve  soil  fertility  and  increase 
sustainability of production for vegetables and field crops with the use of legume 
rotations; and 
(viii)  Promotion of linkages to local, regional and UB markets.

vegetation; 
•  Maintain  the  planted  seedlings  until  the  start  of  project  operation  and  then  hand  over 
responsibility for maintenance to the soum government; 
• Maintain strict speed limits (maximum 50 km/h) for work vehicles; 
•  Restrict  construction  activity  and  project  vehicle  activity  between  18.00  and  06.00  to 
minimize the risk of collisions with fauna at night 
•  To reduce the risk of spreading weeds, pest animals, and/or soil-based organisms, the 
project will allow only use of native plant species. 
•  All re-vegetation activities under the project, including for the rehabilitation of construction 
sites, and for landscaping, will be subject to operation and maintenance procedures after 
planting, to ensure the planted vegetation is adequately protected and maintained. 
•  To avoid soil and water pollution, no pesticides and no top-dressing fertilizers will be used 
for any of the re-vegetation, planting, or landscaping activities under the project 
• Implement the following chance-find procedure at all sites, if an artefact is found:  
• Stop  works  immediately;  notify  soum  government,  park  administration,  PIU,  Ministry  of 
Education, Culture and Science; isolate site; document and photograph it; await specific 
instructions from Ministry of Education, Culture and Science on how to manage the site 
and for approval to proceed with works

Mitigation measures 
• Signs will be placed at construction sites informing people of the project GRM, potential 
dangers (e.g. moving vehicles, hazardous materials, excavations) and safety issues; 
• Prior to works, re-confirm the planned construction schedule and site EMP actions; 
• Information disclosure.  Villagers, residents and businesses will be informed in advance 
through media and information boards at construction sites of the construction activities, 
given the dates and duration of expected disruption;  
• Posting of billboards on road/lane closure, traffic rerouting plan at strategic places, at least 
1 week prior to works; 
• Prepare  and  implement  a  traffic  control  plan,  for  approval  by  local  traffic  management 
administration before construction. This will include scheduling or diverting construction 
traffic to avoid peak hours, regulating traffic at road crossings, selecting routes to reduce 
disturbance,  reinstating  roads,  and  opening  them  to  traffic  when  construction  is 
completed; 
• Posting of traffic (flag) persons during entire working hours; 
• Spread out the schedule for materials delivery in non-peak hours; 
• Efficient management of truck arrival/ departure; 
• In  case  of  accidental  interruption,  immediately  inform  affected  communities  and  assist 
with water supply until the issue is resolved; 
• Heavy machinery will not be used at night; 
• All sites will be secured from unauthorized public access. 
• Public  consultations  on  work  phasing  and  schedules,  anticipated  access  blocking, 
provisions  for  safe  access  for  blocked  properties  and  temporary  parking  for  blocked 
garages/driveways; 
• Provision of safe access, if needed, to blocked properties, e.g., steel planks of adequate 
grade, width and length, and if necessary, with guide rail; 
• For power utilities, coordinate with soum governments and power substations as needed 
and  establish  contact  arrangements  and  procedures  in  case  of  accidental  damage  to 
power lines. 
• In  case  of  accidental  interruption,  immediately  inform  affected  communities  and  assist 
with water supply until the issue is resolved. 
• Prepare environmental, health and safety plan, to include: i) Clean and sufficient supply 
of fresh water for construction sites, camps, offices; ii) Sufficient latrines and other sanitary 
arrangements at construction sites and work camps; iii) Garbage receptacles and regular 
emptying;  and  iv)  Provide  safety  clothing  to  workers  as  needed  (e.g.  boots,  helmets, 
gloves, goggles, ear protection) in accordance with health and safety regulations;

expanding  local  agricultural  production  (vegetables) for  increasing  domestic  demand, reducing 
climate vulnerability, and improving employment opportunities and income for rural households. 
The project will be aligned with the following impact: Income generation and enterprise support 
for smallholder vegetable farmers increased. The project outcome will be: Efficiency of climate 
resilient agricultural production and marketing increased. The proposed outputs are. 
- 
- 
- 
Output  1:  Efficient  and  climate-resilient  irrigation  infrastructure  and  management 
systems installed. This output will focus on (i) upgrading, modernizing, and climate-proofing 
irrigation  and  (if  needed)  drainage  infrastructure;  and  (ii)  strengthening  coordination  and 
management of irrigation services, irrigated land areas, including storage ponds and canals 
in irrigation systems, ensuring irrigation supplies for agricultural land. The project will finance 
remodeling  and  improvement  of  main,  secondary,  and  tertiary  canals,  drainage  facilities 
(where required), flood management facilities, and associated structures.  
Output 2: Climate smart agriculture production systems improved. Through this output, the 
project  aims  to  improve  productivity  and  resilience  of  agriculture  production  systems, 
focusing specifically on (i) improving the quality of inputs, specifically the production of high-
yielding  and  climate-resilient  vegetable  seeds,  and  (ii)  measures  to  combat  crop  damage 
from pests (rodents) and improve the quality of pesticides on the market (and test for their 
occurrence in food products). 
Output  3:  Technical  Institutional,  and  management  capacity  and  coordination 
strengthened.  Through  this  output,  the  project  aims  to  improve  efficiency  and  increase 
farmers’ share of the value addition along the value chain, focusing on production, storage, 
and to a limited extent the marketing of vegetables. The project will finance investments in 
small-scale  civil  works,  equipment  and  extension  services  (training)  for  climate-smart 
vegetable production (including post-harvest storage facilities).  
 The  proposed  project  will  cover  12  selected  irrigation  schemes  in  3 regions  (Western, 
2. 
Central, and Eastern), 9 aimags and 12 soums. 
B.  Works to be Undertaken under the Project 
3. 
The project aims to upgrade and modernize a number of the existing irrigation systems that 
have fallen into disrepair. The functional deterioration for some of these schemes is substantial, to 
the extent that virtually new schemes have to be designed and built. The work required includes: i) 
upgrading  and/or  reforming  intake  headworks  and  associated  water  storage  and  sediment 
management facilities; and ii) redevelopment of secure main and distributary canals, with gated flow 
control structures. Wherever feasible, use will be made of the existing infrastructure, with or without 
structural  upgrade,  to  improve  overall  water  flow  and  distribution  management  to  the  command 
areas. 
Due  diligence  has  confirmed  that  the  project  will  not  require  any  land  acquisition  or 
4. 
involuntary resettlement as no ownership rights have been issued in all the irrigation schemes 
areas. Therefore, all the land of the 12 irrigation schemes is owned by the soums governments. 
152 
Appendix 6 
In addition, when an existing canal network is present and will be upgraded, the works will be 
undertaken within the footprint of the existing canal network. Therefore, the project is categorized 
“C” for Involuntary Resettlement (IR) 
For the Nogoon Khashaa irrigation scheme (Uliastai soum Zavkhan aimag), the existing 
5. 
canal, built in 1974, is going through a built-up area. A total of 8 households and one company 
have been issued possession or ownership rights on the adjacent land along the canal (see Figure 
1  below).  The  canal  will  be  lined  canal  and  will  be  covered  at  the  locations  nearby  the  lands 
involving  possession/ownership  rights  of  these  households/company  (to  limit  contamination  of 
water and to provide safety). The current design can be changed to a pipe (without realignment) 
after detailed investigation during detailed design. The RoW will be 1.2m which is approximately 
the same as the current RoW width. No permanent LAR impacts are anticipated. 
6. 
The  households/company have agreed to provide access to workers for the upgrading of 
the  canal  during  construction  and  for  Operation  &  Maintenance  as  needed. 35  The  owners 
recognize that the canal is public land and they will not claim any rights on the canal (See Annex 
1). 
7. 
 However,  the  Nogoon Kashaa  irrigation  scheme  may  involve some  temporary  impacts 
during  project  construction  (e.g.,  structures  like  walls  may  be  affected  or  land  occupied 
temporarily). This Resettlement Framework has been prepared to manage such impacts during 
construction and any other unforeseen impacts that may arise during project implementation.
35 For the HH that is not currently available in the village, best efforts will be done to find and seek this HH’s written 
agreement prior to construction.

LEGAL FRAMEWORK AND ADB SAFEGUARD POLICY STATEMENT 
Mongolian Laws and Regulations.  
 In Mongolia there is no dedicated and comprehensive law that regulates issues of land 
8. 
acquisition  and  resettlement.  Although  the  Constitution  of  Mongolia  has  provisions  that  justify 
exercising of eminent domain power, none of the land related legislation provides the power of 
eminent domain to the state or any other entity. According to the current Mongolian legislation, 
any  land  acquisition,  including  the  ones  for  public  needs  such  as  land  for  public  sewer  main 
collector pipes, shall take place through negotiation and agreement. If negotiations fail, then the 
case must be resolved at the courts. The laws are silent on land expropriation, but do provide 
provisions on exchange of land or taking over land with compensation for state special needs. 
However, the related procedures are incomplete, imprecise and fail to properly protect the rights 
of  affected  persons  and  property  rights.  The  basic  legislative  framework  for  LAR  and  related 
issues consists of: i) Constitution of Mongolia, ii) Law on Land, iii) Law on Allocation of Land to 
Mongolian Citizens for Ownership and iv) Civil Code of Mongolia. In addition to these laws, Annex 
4  of  the  Government  Decree  No.  28  from  2003,  “Regulation  on  Taking  Over  Land  for  and 
Releasing Land from State Special Needs”, is used in the LAR activities. 
B. 
ADB Involuntary Resettlement Policy Requirements.   
9. 
The  2009  ADB  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  outlines  the  requirements  that  ADB 
borrowers/clients are required to meet in delivering involuntary resettlement safeguards to ADB 
supported  projects.    The  overriding  objectives  of  the  safeguards  are:  “to  avoid  involuntary 
resettlement  wherever  possible;  to  minimize  involuntary  resettlement  by  exploring  project  and 
design alternatives; to enhance, or at least restore, the livelihoods of all displaced persons in real 
terms relative to pre-project levels; and to improve the standards of living of the displaced poor 
and other vulnerable groups.” 
10. 
The ADB’s IR safeguards state that eligibility includes all people with formal legal rights to 
affected land (in whole or part) and those who have claims to the affected land that is recognized 
under  national  laws.  People  without  formal  legal  rights  or  recognized  claims,  but  who  have 
occupied the land or structure prior to the agreed upon and publicized cut-off date, are eligible for 
compensation for non-land assets and resettlement assistance. 
11. 
The  ADB’s  IR  principles  also  describe  the  compensation  and  assistance  that  will  be 
provided,  including:  adequate  and  appropriate  replacement  land  and  structures,  or  cash 
compensation at full replacement cost without depreciation, transaction costs, accrued interest, 
transitional/restoration  costs  and  any  other  payments;  preference  for  land-based  (not  cash) 
resettlement strategies; assistance with relocation and improved housing with comparable access 
to employment/productive opportunities, civic infrastructure and community services; transitional 
support  and development  assistance;  and  opportunities to share in project  benefits.  For  those 
who  are  economically  displaced,  they  will  be  compensated  for  loss  of  income,  and  as  well  be 
assisted in restoring, and where possible improving, their earning capacity, production levels and 
standard of living. 
C. 
Assessment of Policy Gaps. 
There are several significant policy gaps between the Mongolian legal framework and the 
12. 
ADB  IR  safeguards.  According  to  Mongolian  law  or  practice:  (i)  non-titled  occupants  of  land 
(without  ownership  or  possession  license),  including  lessees  of  land  and  structures,  are  not 
Appendix 6 
155 
eligible for compensation and rehabilitation entitlements; (ii) income and livelihood rehabilitation 
is not normally considered in local land acquisition practice; (iii) transaction costs are not included 
in  compensation  payments;  (iv)  there  are  no  project  internal  grievance  procedures  preceding 
dispute resolution by governors and the courts; (v) public consultation and information disclosure 
is  not  practiced;  (vi)  an  eligibility  cut-off  date  is  not  declared;  (vii)  there  is  no  limitation  on 
commencement of civil works until after completion of all land acquisition procedures, and (viii) 
there is no need to prepare a  resettlement plan (RP) or to undertake monitoring and evaluation 
activities.  
13. 
The  table  below  outlines  the  key  provisions  of  existing  Mongolian  laws  and  practices 
relevant  to  structure  demolition  and  temporary  impacts;  and  indicates  their  compatibility  or 
inconsistency with the ADB IR safeguards.

PROJECT ENTITLEMENT AND ELIGIBILITY 
14.  While the loan project will not finance any infrastructure that will entail land acquisition, 
there may be some temporary impacts, such as temporary impacts on structures and temporary 
occupation of public land during project construction. 
To ensure that any such impacts are properly addressed, the following entitlement matrix 
15. 
will be adopted:

IV. 
INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS, MONITORING, AND REPORTING 
The Ministry of Food Agriculture and Light Industry (MOFALI) will be the executing agency. 
16. 
The Crop Production Development Policy and Coordination Department of MOFALI will be the 
implementing  agency.  Local  governments  in  relevant  project  soums  will  be  involved  in  project 
implementation.  
17. 
 A  Project  Implementation  Unit  (PIU)  will  be  established  under  MOFALI.  A  social  and 
gender specialist will be recruited at PIU to ensure the effective implementation of the SDAP/GAP, 
the RF and other social aspects. MOFALI and soums will also appoint their staff as focal persons 
(officers) for social tasks. 
18. The  MOFALI/PIU  will  immediately  inform  ADB  of  any  LAR  impacts  during  implementation. 
Resettlement Plan (RP) will be prepared as needed in accordance with this RF and ADB SPS 
before awarding any civil works contracts involving LAR impacts. An indicative outline of the 
RP is available in the SPS Appendix 2, which will be adopted in preparing an RP with details 
commensurate to the level of impacts.   
The social and gender specialist will also cover safeguards monitoring for the project; and 
19. 
reporting will be included in semi-annual progress reports by the PIU to ADB. The project will be 
implemented for seven years from January 2020 to December 2026. 
V. 
GRIEVANCE REDRESS MECHANISM 
The project includes a grievance redress mechanism (GRM) for potential environmental 
20. 
and social impacts that may occur during project construction and implementation.  
21. 
A  project  grievance  is  defined  as  an  actual  or  perceived  project-related  problem  that 
results in a complaint by an affected person (including workers). The PIU will work proactively 
toward preventing grievances through the implementation of mitigation measures and community 
consultations. To address any complaints that do arise, this project grievance redress mechanism 
(GRM) will be established. The GRM is a simple and time-based process for receiving, recording, 
and addressing project-related grievances transparently and quickly. The GRM will be accessible 
to diverse members of the local communities, including more vulnerable groups such as women, 
youth and elderly. Multiple  points  of  entry,  including  face-to-face meetings,  written  complaints, 
telephone  calls,  or  e-mail,  will  be  available.  Opportunities  for  confidentiality  and  privacy  for 
162 
Appendix 6 
complainants  will  be  honored  where  requested.  The  GRM  does  not  impede  or  replace  legal 
procedures and Mongolia’s judicial system. 
In Mongolia, residents' complaints or concerns are generally communicated taken to the 
22. 
soum representatives, and this system has been integrated into the GRM. 
23. 
The  PIU  environment  officer  and  social  officer  will  be  the  lead  coordinators  for  GRM 
implementation. All project agencies and staff will be trained in the GRM and will take an active 
role in supporting these staffs as and when necessary. The PIU environment officer and social 
officer will establish a GRM tracking and documentation system, instruct all project agencies in 
the  GRM  procedures,  conduct  daily  coordination  with  project  agencies,  arrange  meetings  and 
conduct  site visits  as  necessary,  maintain the  overall  project  GRM  database,  and  prepare the 
reporting  inputs  for  progress  reports  to  ADB.  In  each  project  soum,  the  government  will 
nominate a focal person for the GRM36. The names and contact details of the PIU, soum focal 
points  will  be  disseminated  to  the  project  agencies  and  communities.  Upon  receiving  any 
complaints,  the  soum  focal  points  will  immediately  inform  the  PIU  environment  and/or  social 
officer. 
24. 
Once  a  complaint  is  received  and  filed,  the  MOFALI  and  PIU  officers  will  identify  if 
complaints are eligible. Eligible complaints include those where (i) the complaint pertains to the 
project; and (ii) the issues arising in the complaint fall within the scope of issues that the GRM is 
authorized to address. Ineligible complaints include those where: (i) the complaint is clearly not 
project-related; (ii) the nature of the issue is outside the mandate of the GRM (such as allegations 
of  fraud  or  corruption);  and  (iii)  other  procedures  are  more  appropriate  to  address  the  issue. 
Ineligible complaints will be recorded and passed to the relevant authorities and the complainant 
will be informed of the decision and reasons for rejection. The procedure and timeframe for the 
GRM is as follows; and see Figure 3. 
•  Stage 1 (5 working days): If a concern arises, the affected person may resolve the issue 
directly  with  the  contractor  or  make  the  complaint  known  to  the  soum  focal  point, 
other local authorities, PIU, or any level of authority they are comfortable with. Whenever 
possible, the contractor will resolve the issue directly with the affected person. The issue 
shall be immediately reported to the PIU. 
•  Stage 2 (5 working days): If the issue cannot be resolved in Stage 1, after five days, the 
PIU  will  take  over  responsibility  in  close  coordination  with  the  soum  focal  point.  The 
eligibility  of  the  complaint  will  be  assessed  and  a  recommended  solution  given  to  the 
complainant and contractors within five (5) working days. If the solution is agreed by the 
complainant,  the  contractors  and/or  irrigation  scheme  operators  will  implement  the 
solution within seven days. Written records will be made of all stages and outcomes. 
is  not  satisfied  with 
•  Stage  3  (10  working  days):  If  no  solution  can  be  identified  in  Stage  2  and/or  the 
the  PIU  and  soum  
complainant 
focal  points  will  organize,  within  ten  (10)  days,  a  stakeholder  meeting  (including  the 
complainant,  contractor  and/or  irrigation  scheme  operator,  and  local  government 
agencies).  A  solution  acceptable  to  all  shall  be  identified  including  clear  steps.  The 
contractors (during construction) and irrigation scheme operators (during operation) will 
immediately implement the agreed solution. Written records will be made of all stages and 
outcomes. 
the  proposed  solution, 
36 This focal person could be the citizen representative at both and bag levels 
Appendix 6 
163 
25. 
The executing and/or implementing agencies shall bear any and all costs of implementing 
the  GRM,  including  meeting,  travel,  and/or  accommodation  costs  of  the  government  staff  or 
affected person. The GRM will be implemented throughout project construction and at least the 
first year of operation for each irrigation scheme. The PIU will include any grievances, steps taken, 
and results, within the semi-annual reports to ADB. The GRM is included in the PAM (Appendix 
5). 
 Accountability mechanism. ADB implements an “accountability mechanism” as a forum 
26. 
where people adversely affected by ADB-assisted projects can voice and seek solutions to their 
problems and report alleged noncompliance of ADB's operational policies and procedures. The 
policy is available at: http://www.adb.org/documents/accountabilitymechanism-policy-2012. The 
mechanism is designed to: (i) enhance ADB's development effectiveness and project quality; (ii) 
be responsive to the concerns of project-affected people and fair to all stakeholders; (iii) reflect 
the  highest  professional  and  technical  standards  in  its  staffing  and  operations;  (iv)  be  as 
independent and transparent as possible; and (v) be cost-effective, efficient, and complementary 
to the other supervision, audit, quality control, and evaluation systems at ADB. The mechanism 
provides two approaches to which affected persons may apply: (i) review of perceived grievances 
and complaints, which is undertaken by ADB’s Office of Special Project Facilitator (OSPF); and 
(ii) review of whether non-compliance with ADB’s policies has occurred, which is undertaken by 
ADB’s Compliance Review Panel. 
The  PIU,  in  its  trainings  and  consultations,  shall  inform  project  stakeholders  about  the 
27. 
Accountability Mechanism.  
28. 
Before submitting  a  complaint  to  the  Accountability  Mechanism,  the  affected  people 
should make a good faith effort to solve their problems by working with the concerned project staff 
and  ADB  operations  department. Only  after  doing  that,  and  if they  are still  dissatisfied,  should 
they approach the Accountability Mechanism.
