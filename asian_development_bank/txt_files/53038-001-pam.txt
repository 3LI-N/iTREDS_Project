Project Administration Manual Purpose and Process 
1.  The  project  administration  manual  (PAM)  describes  the  essential  administrative  and 
management requirements to implement the project on time, within budget, and in accordance 
with the policies and procedures of the government and Asian Development Bank (ADB). The 
PAM should include references to all available templates and instructions either through linkages 
to relevant URLs or directly incorporated in the PAM. 
2.  The Ministry of Food, Agriculture, and Light Industry (MOFALI) is the executing agency and the 
Livestock Policy Implementation and Coordination Department of MOFALI is the implementing 
agency who are wholly responsible for the implementation of ADB financed projects, as agreed 
jointly between the borrower and ADB, and in accordance with the policies and procedures of 
the government and ADB. The ADB staff is responsible for supporting implementation including 
compliance  by  the  executing  agency  and  the  implementing  agency  of  their  obligations  and 
responsibilities for project implementation in accordance with ADB’s policies and procedures. 
3.  At loan negotiations, the borrower and ADB shall agree  to the PAM; and ensure consistency 
with the loan and grant agreements. Such agreements shall be reflected in the minutes of the 
loan negotiations. In the event of any discrepancy or contradiction between the PAM and the 
loan and project agreements, the provisions of the loan agreements shall prevail. 
4.  After ADB Board approval of the project's report and recommendations of the President (RRP), 
changes in implementation arrangements are subject to agreement and approval pursuant to 
relevant  government  and ADB  administrative  procedures  (including the  project  administration 
instructions) and upon such approval, they will be subsequently incorporated in the PAM. 
I.  
PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
A. 
Rationale  
Mongolia has witnessed a gradual decline in poverty levels since the early 1990s, when 
1. 
an estimated 40.0% of the total population was found to be poor.1 While the incidence of poverty 
fell significantly from 38.8% in 2010 to 21.6% in 2014, recent estimates indicate that it has climbed 
back to 29.6%.2 As per the statistics available for 2018, the poverty rate was also higher in rural 
areas (30.8%) compared to urban areas (27.2%) in 2018. 3 In addition, only 35.3% of households 
were  food  secure  in  2016  while  half  the  population  experienced  moderate  to  severe  food 
insecurity. The high incidence of poverty and food insecurity in rural areas is particularly alarming, 
where the majority of the poor are dependent on agriculture and extensive livestock production to 
sustain livelihoods. 
2. 
The  agriculture  sector  remains  a  key  backbone  of  the  economy.  In  2019,  agriculture 
accounted for 10.8% of gross domestic product (GDP), with the sector growing at a similar rate 
(compounded annually) over the period from 2007 to 2019. The share of livestock in agriculture 
output is 84.2%, providing employment to one-fourth of Mongolia’s total employment. Currently, 
meat,  and  milk  are  the  primary  products  of  the  livestock  subsector,  contributing  to  61.0%  of 
livestock output and 7.0% of GDP. In contrast, mining sector provides 5.1% of total employment 
in the country. As such, the agriculture sector translates far more directly into improved lives for 
vulnerable Mongolians than mining and has the potential to reduce rural poverty, boost incomes, 
and diversify economic growth through food production and export of high-quality meat and wool 
products.  ADB  supports Mongolia’s  economic  diversification  with several projects  encouraging 
labor  intensive  growth  through  utilizing  and  preserving  Mongolia’s  natural  capital  outside  the 
mining sector, especially by small- and medium-sized enterprises engaged in agribusiness value 
chains and building climate resilience of the livestock subsector.4 
Despite the significant importance of agriculture and particularly the livestock subsector, 
3. 
several constraints and risks threaten the sustainability and competitiveness of the sector. The 
lack  of  a  regulatory  framework,  enforcement  capacity,  and  coordinated  policies  of  central  and 
local-level administrations to control livestock numbers within the carrying capacity of grasslands, 
has created an alarming situation where livestock numbers, in sheep equivalents,5 have increased 
by  71%  between  2009  and  2019,  from  69.5  million  to  119.0  million,6  and  70.0%  of  Mongolia’s 
pastureland  is  now  degraded.  These  constraints  are  further  exacerbated  by  extreme  climatic 
events  such  as  droughts  and  dzuds,  which  have  resulted  in  significant  livestock  deaths  and 
removed  the  means  of  livelihood  for  many  herder  households.  The  government  has  adopted 
policy actions to adjust the livestock flock structure and grassland use rights to reduce pasture

deterioration.7 These have been included in recently developed projects and are expected to be 
a major part of the proposed project. 
4. 
Climate  vulnerable  livestock  production  systems.  The  livestock  subsector  is 
dominated by an extensive livestock production system dependent on access to pasturelands. 
Lack  of  appropriate  water  points,  animal  shelter,  and  feeding  throughout  the  winter  leads  to 
concentrated  use  of  surrounding  pasture  and  undermines  pasture  management  during  winter. 
This  remains  a  key  concern  for  herders  in  view  of  the  increased  frequency  of  climate  change 
induced  severe  weather  events.  The  absence  of  coordinated  grazing  management  between 
herders  has  impaired  the  development  of  more  climate-resilient  and  profitable  livestock 
production and marketing systems. Pasture land use agreements are the key legal instrument for 
pastureland management of rangeland user groups. Only between 12% and 39% of the pasture 
in  each  project  aimag  is  used  by  herder  groups  of  which  few  have  formalized  the  use  in 
pastureland use agreements. The current land law allows open access to summer and autumn 
pastures and this is regarded as the fundamental cause of pasture degradation. Although it does 
provide  local  governments  sufficient  authority  to  manage  winter  and  spring  pasture  through 
agreements with herders of the  soum, few soum governors exercise their authority.  The major 
hindrances  include  the  governors’  limited  knowledge  of  how  to  exercise  their  authority,  the 
difficulty of coordinating with the widely scattered herders, and the herders’ limited awareness of 
sustainable pasture management. 
5. 
Poorly  developed  meat  value  chain.  Mongolia  also  faces  challenges  throughout  the 
meat value chain limiting access to export markets that are vital for lifting incomes and overall 
sector growth. First, transboundary animal diseases are prevalent, and the veterinary system has 
been  unable  to  effectively  manage  outbreaks.  These  animal  disease  outbreaks  have  led 
Mongolia’s  neighbors  to  periodically  ban  Mongolian  meat  exports.8  Second,  some  meat, 
especially beef, is unable to compete in export markets on quality because of livestock producers’ 
limited nutrition and breeding practices.9 Third, food hygiene practices and sanitary standards fall 
short of international standards, only 10% of national meat supply in 2017 was met by livestock 
slaughtered and processed at abattoirs and the remainder was processed informally.10 Mongolia’s 
veterinary, breeding, and agriculture extension services, and livestock production systems require 
significant  investment  and  improvement  to  meet  international  standards.  Furthermore,  while 
Mongolia’s new law on Animal Health came into effect in June 2018, secondary legislation is still 
underway and the national veterinary structure needs to be enhanced for effective surveillance 
and animal disease control. Establishment of the General Authority of Veterinary Services (GAVS) 
is  an  important  step  in  instituting  a  national  veterinary  service,  but  substantial  assistance  is 
needed to enable to GAVs to function properly. As a result of these constraints, Mongolia exported 
only 70,400 tons of meat in 2018, despite producing 448,000 tons of meat.11 Given that domestic 
production of meat far exceeds consumption, simply increasing productivity along the value chain 
without  accessing  new  markets  could  lower  prices  and  potentially  hurt  herder  incomes.  The

current  demand-supply  configuration,  combined  with  Mongolia’s  proximity  to  major  markets  in 
Northeast  and  Central  Asia,  and  reputation  for  pastoralist  traditions,  suggests  that  there  is 
potential  to  significantly  boost  exports  and  increase  income  generation  if  the  key  binding 
constraints are addressed in a sustainable manner.

Inadequate 
technical  and 
institutional  management  capacity.  Due 
6. 
the 
predominantly small livestock herds of individual herders, there is limited scope for productivity 
and  quality  enhancing  interventions  without  government  regulation  for  better  coordination  on 
natural resource use. However, the limited capacity and policies of Ministry of Food, Agriculture, 
and Light Industry (MOFALI) and local governments to enforce sustainable pasture management 
and to provide extension services severely impact their capacity to deliver the required guidance. 
The  lack  of  regulations  and  guidelines  for  good  livestock  husbandry  practice  further  limit  the 
options that can be offered to herders. This is further complicated by the limited capacity of public 
and  private  veterinary  servicers  to  ensure  livestock  health  and  meat  safety  inspection  with 
traceability. In the absence of a geographic information system (GIS)-based information system 
on livestock and pasture condition, governments lack evidence-based policy revisions for pasture 
rehabilitation and improving livestock quality. 
to 
7. 
Government policy. The action plan for the Mongolian Agenda for Sustainable Livestock 
(MASL) focuses on the principles of (i) implementation of sustainable pastureland management, 
and adaptation to climate change; (ii) improving the economic efficiency of the livestock sector; 
(iii)  enhancing  livestock  health,  food  security  and  safety;  (iv)  improving  social  inclusiveness  in 
rural  areas;  and  (v)  strengthening  partnership  and  participation.12  Despite  extensive  policy, 
institutional, legal, and regulatory frameworks, the capacity of concerned agencies is limited by 
the  lack  of  availability  of  staff  and  operational  funds  together  with  frequent  changes  to  the 
available  staff  at  central  and  local  levels.  Substantial  assistance  is  required  to  support  the 
institutions to strengthen their capacity in order to achieve their targets. 
COVID-19 pandemic. The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has amplified the 
8. 
interlinkages between human health, livestock health and environmental degradation, particularly 
in  pastoral  production  systems.  Herders  have  suffered  particularly  from  reduced  prices  for 
cashmere  because  of  the  restrictions  in  international  trade  and  tourism.  COVID-19  has  been 
largely contained in both rural and urban areas, but it remains a risk. 
9. 
Strategic  fit.  The  project  is  in  line  with  ADB’s  Strategy  2030  by  creating  knowledge, 
tackling  climate  change  and  enhancing  environmental  sustainability,  and  promoting  rural 
development and food security.13 Fostering of economic growth through strengthening of vertically 
integrated  value  chains  and  strengthening  environmental  sustainability  particularly  through 
improved  natural  resource  management  are  key  strategic  priorities  for  ADB  in  its  country 
partnership  strategy  for  Mongolia,  2017–2020.14  The  project  supports  improving  livestock 
production  through  establishment  of  PUGs  and  RUAs  with  the  objective  of  reducing  livestock 
numbers, increasing output quality and, as a result, reducing pasture degradation. 
10. 
Lessons.  The  project  design  incorporates  lessons  from  previous  and  ongoing  projects 
financed by ADB and others in Mongolia as well as from project preparation. These include the 
need  to: (i)  support  government  executing  and  implementing  agencies to develop  their  project 
implementation capacity; (ii) focus on the formation and strengthening of herder groups, including

ensuring that they understand the need for, and benefits from, pasture protection and reduction 
in livestock numbers; and (iii) improve livestock production support facilities such as feed supply, 
veterinary services, livestock breeds, and output processing. 
B. 
Impact and Outcome 
11. 
The  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  competitiveness  and  sustainability  of 
Mongolia’s  livestock  sector  improved  (Mongolia  Sustainable  Development  Vision  2030).15  The 
project will have the following outcome: efficiency and sustainability of climate-resilient livestock 
production in the project areas increased.16 
C. 
Outputs 
12. 
Output 1: Climate resilience of livestock, pasture, and water management improved. 
This output will build climate resilience of herders against increased frequency of severe weather 
events. Grassland management is the main driver for soil carbon sequestration and will result in 
reduced greenhouse gas emissions for the overall project.17 Compliance with pasture’s livestock 
carrying capacity limits will be achieved through (i) improved grazing management and stocking 
rate reductions through establishment of 466 herder groups and 466 Rangeland Use Agreements 
covering  11,660  herders;  improvement  of  14,000  livestock  shelters  for  herders;  (iii)  improving 
livestock drinking water access by constructing or rehabilitating 382 new wells and developing 
466  water  use  agreements;  (iv)  improving  livestock  feeding  through  establishment  of  14,000 
hayfields and hay storage for 466 herder groups; (v) establishing 20 soum pasture reserve areas. 
Output 2: Livestock value chains strengthened. This output will improve the quality and 
13. 
health standard of livestock herds and products though better integration and coordination of the 
respective livestock value chain participants. Project supported herders can obtain higher output 
her head of livestock and thus reduce the need to maintain large herds. This will also reduce the 
stress  and  impact  on  pasturelands  and  allow  Mongolia  to  pivot  toward  a  more  sustainable 
livestock development model. This will be achieved by strengthening livestock value chains through 
improved  (i)  livestock marketing  by  establishing  linkages  between  2,915  herder  households  and 
processors to meet processor and market standards of health and carcass quality, and feedback to 
herders; (ii) livestock feeding for 466 herder groups through support to hay production and fodder 
storage;  (iii)  animal  health  for  11,660  herders through  support  to  54  private  veterinary  units;  (iv) 
animal breeding through establishment of 20 nucleus flocks for sheep and goats; (v) livestock turnoff 
through lamb fattening in 20 small scale lamb fattening farms; (vi) improved cashmere marketing 
through  establishing  20  soum  level  cashmere  sorting  facilities.  Supported  livestock  value  chain 
investments  will  be  demand-driven.  Herders  in  the  project  area  are  eligible  submit  business 
proposals  which  outline  investment  costs,  operation  and  maintenance,  technical  support,  and 
income over the project period.  
14. 
Output 3: Livestock sector regulatory framework and capacity enhanced. This output 
will strengthen the livestock regulatory framework and institutional capacity through (i) development 
of  implementing  finregulations,  awareness  raising  and  promotion  activities  for  improved  pasture 
management; (ii) establishment of a GIS based Livestock Management Information System (LMIS) 
and the Rangeland and Fodder Division within MOFALI; (iii) development of systems for carcass 
traceability  and  feedback  in  order  to  reach  market  standards;  (iv)  expansion  of  the  Mongolian

inter-aimag pasture reserve areas. 
Value added by ADB. The project’s innovative organization of pasture management and 
15. 
small  and  medium  agro-enterprises  will  offer  a  unique  opportunity  to  showcase  value  added 
interventions  which  preserve  the  natural  capital  of  rangelands.  Lessons  learned  from  JFPR 
funded ADB projects targeted at supporting collaborative pasture management have informed the 
project  design,18  in  particular:  (i)  adoption  of  a  demand-driven  approach  to  providing  project 
investments,  (ii)  linking  of  reductions  in  livestock  numbers  to  reducing  pasture  degradation 
through  rangeland  use  agreements  between  herder  groups  and  local  government,  and  (iii) 
developing the proposed LMIS to improve the government’s capacity for livestock management 
and policy development. During implementation, the project team will liaise with the Central Asia 
Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) program, the CAREC Institute, World Organisation for 
Animal Health (OIE), Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and other development partners 
to  disseminate  best  practices  and  prepared  technical  guidelines  and  encourage  knowledge-
sharing by participating in regional events. The project design ensures that these connections are 
promoted, and value added is maximized.

III. 
PROJECT MANAGEMENT ARRANGEMENTS 
A. 
Project Implementation Organizations: Roles and Responsibilities 
The Ministry of Food, Agriculture, and Light Industry (MOFALI) is the executing agency 
16. 
responsible  for  overall  project  implementation.  MOFALI’s  Livestock  Policy  Implementation 
Coordination Department (LPICD) will be the implementing agency for the project. Guidance and 
sector coordination will be through a national project steering committee (PSC). The PSC will be 
chaired  by  the  State  Secretary  of  MOFALI  and  will  meet  at  least  twice  a  year  during  project 
implementation. 
17. 
A  project  management  unit  (PMU)  will  be  established  at  MOFALI  in  Ulaanbaatar.  The 
PMU  will  be  responsible  for  daily  project  management,  including  accounting,  procurement, 
training, monitoring, and reporting. The PMU will be supervised by the Director General of LPICD 
and headed by the project coordinator. All procurement contracts will be signed by the Project 
Director. The executing and implementing agencies lack the personnel and resources needed to 
fully implement the project, and the PMU staff will be recruited for the administrative and technical 
tasks. 
Project  implementation  units  (PIUs)  will  be  established  at  the  aimag  agricultural 
18. 
departments  in each of  the  four  participating  aimags.  The project  will  implement  activities in 4 
aimags  and  20  soums:  Bulgan  aimag  with  the  soums  Mogod,  Saikhan,  Khishigundur,  and 
Gurvanbulag;  Arkhangai  aimag  with  the  soums  Khairkhan,  Ulziit,  Erdenemandal,  Battsengel, 
Ugiinuur, and Khashaat; Bayankhongor aimag with the soums Erdenetsogt, Bayan Ovoo, Ulziit, 
Jinst, and Bogd; and Uvurkhangai aimag with the soums Baruunbayanulaan, Khairkhandulaan, 
Nariinteel, Taragt, and Guchin Us. The PIUs will be responsible for supporting the activities of the 
aimag-based project implementation consultant, day-to-day implementation of the project in their 
participating soums, and ensuring full coordination between the soums and the aimags. 
19. 
Once  the  PMU  and  PIU  structures  are  approved  by  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF), 
MOFALI will finalize and acquire no objection from ADB on the TOR of the PMU and PIU staff, 
and  publicly  announce  the  vacancies  through  local  newspapers,  MOFALI  website,  and  ADB 
Consultant  Management  System.  The  selections  of  all  PMU  and  PIU  staff  shall  be  subject  to 
ADB’s  prior  review  and  approval  to  ensure  that  qualified  candidates  are  selected.  Project 
implementation arrangements, including the establishment of the PSC, selection and hiring of the 
PMU  and  PIU  staff,  reporting,  and  other  relevant  arrangements,  will  comply  with  Mongolia’s 
Regulation  on  Utilization  of  Proceeds  of  Foreign  Loans  of  the  Government;  Implementation, 
Administration, Financing, Monitoring, and Evaluation of Projects and Programs Funded by Such 
Proceeds, approved under the Resolution No. 196 of the Minister of Finance and other relevant 
regulations  approved  and  amended  from  time  to  time,  provided  they  do  not  conflict  with  the 
provisions of the loan and grant agreements,19 this project administration manual, or ADB policies. 
20.  MOFALI  will  assume  overall  responsibility  for  the  project  implementation,  including 
authorization of the PMU and PIU staff contracts (with contracting of the PMU procurement and 
financial  specialists  to be undertaken  by MOF upon request  by MOFALI)  based  on  ADB’s  no-
objection. The Director General of LPICD will be responsible for the annual review of PMU and 
PIU  staff  performance,  overall  project  reporting,  and/or  other  management  issues,  and  will 
coordinate closely throughout project implementation.

IV. 
COSTS AND FINANCING 
22. 
The  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $34.50  million.  The  project  investment  costs  include 
goods, works, and consulting services to support improvement of livestock production systems in 
20  soums  in  four  aimags  with  the  objective  of  reducing  livestock  numbers  and  pasture 
degradation, and capacity building of government institutions involved in livestock production. 
23. 
The government has requested a regular loan of $23.0 million from ADB’s ordinary capital 
resources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period 
of 6 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB’s London interbank offered 
rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%  per  year;  and  such  other 
terms  and  conditions  as  are  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  agreement.  Based  on  the  straight-line 
method, the average maturity is 15.75 years, and the maturity premium payable to ADB is 0.10% 
per  year.  The  government  has  also  requested  a  concessional  loan  of  $7.0 million  from  ADB’s 
ordinary capital resources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 25-year term, including 
a grace period of 5 years; an annual interest rate of 2% during the grace period and thereafter; 
and such other terms and conditions as are set forth in the draft loan agreement. The government 
has  provided  ADB  with  (i)  the  reasons  for  its  decision  to  borrow  under  ADB’s  LIBOR-based 
lending facility, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and 
not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. 
24. 
The ADB loan will finance 86.9% of the total project costs through a regular loan (66.7%) 
and  a  concessional  loan  (20.3%),  including  expenditures  relating  to  civil  works,  goods,  and 
services.  
Central  and  aimag  governments  will  contribute  6.0%  of  the  total  project  costs  through 
25. 
counterpart staff and exemption of value added taxes and duties for works and goods. The value 
added tax and custom duties exemptions will be accounted and recorded by the PMU, to properly 
account for the government counterpart financing for the project. The amounts exempted will be 
recorded as part of the cost of the assets purchased and/or services contracted. All PMU staff 
and  national  consultant  salaries  are  inclusive  of  personal  income  taxes;  such  personnel  are 
responsible for fulfilling their Mongolian tax obligations. The government has assured ADB that it 
will provide additional funding for any shortfall of funds or cost overruns to ensure the success of 
the project. 
26. 
Beneficiaries will contribute 7.0% of the total project costs through in-kind contributions to 
the rehabilitation of existing deep wells, the construction of new wells, upgrading of winter camps, 
and hay field development. 
A. 
Cost Estimates Preparation and Revisions  
27. 
Preparation. The cost estimates were prepared jointly by the implementing agency and 
ADB with assistance from the transaction technical assistance (TA) consultants. The sources and 
basis of cost estimates were reviewed during project preparation and confirmed by related parties. 
The process was facilitated by a model in excel software which enabled easy updating or revision, 
if necessary. The model is maintained by both the implementing agency (IA) and ADB. 
28. 
Revision. Revision of cost estimates will be conducted when deemed necessary during 
implementation. The PMU will be responsible for proposing and drafting the revisions which will 
be subject to ADB’s approval.

FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT 
A. 
Financial Management Assessment 
The  Financial  Management  Assessment  (FMA)  was  prepared  in  accordance  with  the 
31. 
ADB’s  Financial  Management  Technical  Guidance  Note 
for  Financial  Management 
Assessment.20 The purpose of this FMA to determine the robustness of accounting procedures, 
financial controls, audit arrangements, and the capacity of MOFALI. The FMA was undertaken 
between March-July 2020 by the financial management specialist engaged in the project technical 
assistance and has been progressively updated through September 2020 as the project has been 
further  developed  in  dialogue  with  the  GOM.  The  assessment  based  on  ADB’s  Financial 
Management  Assessment  Questionnaire  (FMAQ)  and  interviews  were  conducted  with  officers 
and financial management specialist of the Finance and Investment Department (FID), LPICD, 
Monitoring, Evaluation, Auditing and Control Department (MEACD) of MOFALI in Ulaanbaatar, in 
March 2020. Furthermore, based on the project implementation arrangements, FMA was carried 
out in four aimags, namely Arkhangai, Bayankhongor, Bulgan and Uvurkhangai, in June 2020. 
The  officers  and  financial  management  specialist  of  the  Finance  and  State  Treasury  Fund 
Department  (FSTFD), 
Investment,  Development  Policy  Planning  Department  (IDPPD), 
Monitoring, Evaluation, and Internal Audit Department (MEIAD) of Aimag Governor’s Office and 
Financial Control and Auditing Agency of aimag were also interviewed. During the interviews, all 
necessary  precautions  were  taken  and  government  regulations  on  the  coronavirus  disease 
(COVID-19) were followed. 
32. 
The overall pre-mitigation financial management risk of the executing and implementing 
agencies is moderate (defined as “likely to occur, will have low impact if occurs”), (footnote 20) 
based on the FMA results which indicate (i) low in-house financial capacity, and (ii) low capacity 
of the EA and IA to perform annual monitoring and internal auditing, hence it seems likely that 
some errors or deficiencies in project financial management will occur. 
33. 
The identified financial management risks will be mitigated by the proposed action plan as 
shown in Table 11 and will be closely monitored during project implementation. Advance fund and 
SOE procedures are proposed to be used and it is concluded that the EA’s financial management 
capacity to administer such procedures is adequate.

B. 
Disbursement 
1. 
Disbursement Arrangements for ADB Funds 
Loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB’s Loan Disbursement Handbook 
34. 
(2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time),  and  detailed  arrangements  agreed  upon  between  the 
government and ADB. MOF will maintain separate accounts and records for two loans. The PMU 
will  be  responsible  for  project  implementation,  including  daily  management,  accounting, 
procurement, training, monitoring, and reporting. It will prepare (i) disbursement projections, (ii) 
supporting documents, and (iii) withdrawal applications.  
35. 
Advance fund procedure and project sub-account. The advance account (zero balance 
account) will be established at the State Bank and the funds will be transferred to the Treasury 
Single  Account  of  the  MOF.  Local  currency  and  USD  accounts  will  be  established  under  the 
Treasury Single Account (TSA) of the MOF. After loan effectiveness the GOM will establish USD 
accounts under the Treasury Single Account (TSA) of MOF, one for each financing source (OCR 
and  COL).  The  advance  accounts  will  be  used  exclusively  for  ADB’s  share  of  the  eligible 
expenditures and will be operated by MOF. To receive funding to TSA, the MOF will establish pass-
through accounts in USD currency at a commercial State Bank. At the same day of replenishment 
through the State Bank account the funds will be transferred to the advance accounts at the TSA.  
Project  sub-account.  MOFALI  with  support  of  PMU  will  submit  request  for  approval  to 
36. 
open sub-accounts to MOF, after which four sub-accounts in local currency (one investment sub-
account for payment to contractors and one operational sub-account for daily expenditures under 
each USD advance account) will be established. These sub-accounts will be held under the TSA at 
MOF, but MOFALI, with support of the PMU, will be responsible for the management, monitoring, 
and reconciliation of them. While the investment sub-accounts will be exclusively for payment to 
contractors,  the  operational  sub-account  will  be  used  exclusively  for  ADB’s  share  of  eligible 
28 
expenditures to finance office management, vehicle operation, PMU and PIU salary costs, and 
workshop, and training activities. Every liquidation and replenishment of the sub-account shall be 
supported by sufficient documentation in accordance with Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, 
as amended from time to time).  
37. 
The total outstanding advance to the respective advance account should not exceed the 
estimate of ADB’s share of expenditures to be paid through the respective advance account for 
the forthcoming 6 months. MOF may request for initial and additional advances to the advance 
account based on an Estimate of Expenditure Sheet setting out the estimated expenditures to be 
financed through the accounts for the forthcoming 6 months.21 Supporting documents should be 
submitted to ADB or retained by MOF in accordance with ADB’s Loan Disbursement Handbook 
(2017, as amended from time to time),22 and other detailed arrangements agreed by ADB and the 
government.  
Statement of expenditure procedure.23 The statement of expenditure procedure may be 
38. 
used  for  reimbursement  of  eligible  expenditures  or  liquidation  of  advances  to  the  advance 
accounts that do not exceed more than $200,000 per individual payment. Supporting documents 
and records for the expenditures claimed under the statement of expenditure procedure should 
be maintained and made readily available for review by ADB’s disbursement and review missions, 
upon  ADB’s  request  for  submission  of  supporting  documents  on  a  sampling  basis,  and  for 
independent audit. 
39.  Withdrawal  application.  Before  the  submission  of  the  first  withdrawal  application,  the 
government should submit to ADB sufficient evidence of the authority of the person(s) who will 
sign  the  withdrawal  applications  on  behalf  of  the  government,  together  with  the  authenticated 
specimen  signatures  of  each  authorized  person.  Co-signing  responsibilities  are  as  follows:  (i) 
withdrawal  applications  submitted  to  ADB  will  be  co-signed  by  MOF  and  MOFALI,  (ii) 
disbursements from the advance and investment sub-accounts will be co-signed by MOFALI and 
MOF,  and  (iii)  disbursement  from  operational  sub-account  will  be  co-signed  by  PMU  project 
coordinator and Project Finance Specialist.  
The minimum value per withdrawal application is stipulated in ADB’s Loan Disbursement 
40. 
Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time). Individual payments below such amount should 
be  paid  (i)  by  MOFALI,  and  subsequently  claimed  from  ADB  through  reimbursement;  or  (ii) 
through the advance fund procedure, unless otherwise accepted by ADB. MOF should ensure 
sufficient category and contract balances before requesting disbursements. Use of ADB’s Client 
Portal  for  Disbursements  system  is  encouraged  for  submission  of  withdrawal  applications  to 
ADB.24 
2. 
Disbursement Arrangements for Counterpart Fund 
41. 
Government counterpart contributions to the project are in-kind only in terms of financing 
21 The estimate of expenditure sheet is available in Appendix 8A of ADB’s  Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as 
amended from time to time). 
22 The Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time), describes which supporting documents 
should be submitted to ADB and which should be retained by the government for liquidation and replenishment of 
the advance account. 
23 The statement of expenditure form is available in Appendix 7B of ADB’s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as 
amended from time to time).

of  value  added  taxes  and  custom  duties  on  goods  in  the  form  of  tax  exemption  estimated  at 
MNT5.6 billion ($1.96 million equivalent). The exemption from value added tax will be regulated 
by MOF Decree #4625 while custom duties exemptions under MOF Decree #317.26 The PMU shall 
obtain the  registration  number  from  the  state  administrative organization  in charge  of  customs 
and tax matters, and submit requests for tax exemption to MOF each quarter. MOF approves the 
list  of  project  implementers  receiving  tax  exemptions.  The  value  added  tax  and  custom  duties 
exemptions  will  be  accounted  for  and  recorded  by  the  PMU,  to  properly  account  for  the 
government counterpart financing for the project. The amounts exempted will be recorded as part 
of the cost of the assets purchased and/or services contracted. 
C. 
Accounting 
42.  MOFALI will maintain, or cause to be maintained, separate books and records by funding 
source for all expenditures incurred on the project following International Public Sector Accounting 
Standard  for  accrual-based  accounting.  MOFALI  will  prepare  project  financial  statements  in 
accordance  with  the  government's  accounting  laws  and  regulations  which  are  consistent  with 
international accounting principles and practices. 
D. 
Auditing and Public Disclosure 
43.  MOFALI will cause the detailed project financial statements to be audited in accordance 
with  International  Standards  on  Auditing  by  an  independent  auditor  acceptable  to  ADB.  The 
audited project financial statements together with the auditor’s opinion will be presented in the 
English language to ADB within 6 months from the end of the fiscal year by MOFALI. 
44. 
The audit report for the project financial statements will include a management letter and 
auditor’s opinions, which cover (i) whether the project financial statements present an accurate 
and fair view or are presented fairly, in all material respects, in accordance with the applicable 
financial reporting standards; (ii) whether the proceeds of the loans and grant were used only for 
the  purpose(s)  of  the  project;  and  (iii)  whether  the  borrower  or  executing  agency  was  in 
compliance with the financial covenants contained in the legal agreements (where applicable). 
Compliance with financial reporting and auditing requirements will be monitored by review 
45. 
missions and during normal program supervision; and followed up regularly with all concerned, 
including the external auditor. 
The government, MOFALI, and the LPICD have been made aware of ADB’s approach to 
46. 
delayed  submission;  and  the requirements  for  satisfactory  and  acceptable quality  of the  audited 
project financial statements.27 ADB reserves the right to require a change in the auditor (in a manner

Purchased from the Domestic Market with Humanitarian and Grant Assistance and Concessional Loans provided to 
Mongolia by International Organizations and Donor Countries through the Government. 
26 MOF Decree #317. 20 Nov 2015. Procedure for exemption from value added tax and customs duty on humanitarian 
and grant aid goods received from foreign governments and international organizations. 
27 ADB’s approach and procedures regarding delayed submission of audited project financial statements:  
(i)  When audited project financial statements are not received by the due date, ADB will write to the executing 
agency advising that (a) the audit documents are overdue; and (b) if they are not received within the next 6 
months, requests for new contract awards and disbursement such as new replenishment of advance accounts, 
processing of new reimbursement, and issuance of new commitment letters will not be processed. 
(ii)  When  audited  project  financial  statements  are  not  received  within  6  months  after  the  due  date,  ADB  will 
withhold processing of requests for new contract awards and disbursement such as new replenishment of 
advance accounts, processing of new reimbursement, and issuance of new commitment letters. ADB will (a)

consistent  with  the  constitution  of  the  borrower);  or  for  additional  support  to  be  provided  to  the 
auditor, if the audits required are not conducted in a manner satisfactory to ADB; or if the audits are 
substantially delayed. ADB reserves the right to verify the project's financial account to confirm that 
the share of ADB’s financing is used in accordance with ADB’s policies and procedures. 
47. 
Public disclosure of the audited project financial statements, including the auditor’s opinion 
on the project financial statements, will be guided by ADB’s Access to Information Policy.28 After 
the  review,  ADB  will  disclose  the  audited  project  financial  statements  and  the  opinion  of  the 
auditors on the project financial statements not later than 14 days of ADB’s confirmation of their 
acceptability by posting them on ADB’s website. The management letter and additional auditor’s 
opinions will not be disclosed. 
VI. 
PROCUREMENT AND CONSULTING SERVICES 
48. 
A project procurement risk assessment (PPRA) was conducted in accordance with ADB’s 
Guidance Note on Procurement−Procurement Risk Framework (2018),29 and Guidance Note on 
Procurement−Strategic  Procurement  Planning  (2018).30  Overall  project  procurement  risk  is 
assessed as medium. The main weaknesses are: (i) the EA and the IA have limited experience 
with the newly adopted ADB's Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time), and the 
Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time) – (hereinafter 
referred  to  as  the  ADB Procurement  Policy  and  Regulations);  and  (ii)  they  lack personnel  and 
resources needed to carry out project procurement and manage the contracts. 
49. 
The  PPRA  also  examined  market  conditions.  It  was  concluded  that  relevant  national 
market  is  matured  enough  with  sufficient  number  of  qualified  local  bidders  to  ensure  effective 
competition. It was also found that the project would unlikely attract foreign bidders because all 
the  contracts  under  the  project  are  small,  simple,  and  geographically  dispersed.  The  Project 
Implementation Consultant (PIC) contract is considered big in terms of value. However, it requires 
all national experts, therefore, foreign bidders may not be interested. 
50. 
The proposed preventive and mitigating measures set forth in the PPRA include hiring of 
a PMU procurement specialist and a PMU contract management specialist. These specialists will 
work full-time with the PMU to assist the EA/ IA to ensure that the project procurements are carried 
out in accordance with the ADB Procurement Policy and Regulations and that all parties meet 
their contractual obligations after contract award and during contract implementation. In addition, 
procurement trainings will be delivered on a well-defined interval by ADB procurement staff and 
PMU procurement specialist once recruited, to strengthen procurement skills of  Bid Evaluation 
Committee (BEC)/consultant selection committee (CSC) members and EA/IA staff. 
51. 
Detailed description of procurement tasks of the PMU will be, but not limited to: (i) develop 
required  procurement  documents  such  as  invitation  for  bids  (IFB),  request  for  expressions  of 
interest  (REOI),  request  for  proposals  (RFP),  bidding  documents  (BD),  bid  evaluation  report 
(BER), technical and financial evaluation Reports (TER and FER), draft contracts, and any other 
procurement documents and submit these documents for BEC/CSC’s review and use; (ii) ensure 
inform the executing agency of ADB’s actions; and (b) advise that the loan may be suspended if the audit 
documents are not received within the next 6 months. 
(iii)  When audited project financial statements  are not received within 12 months after the due date, ADB may 
suspend the loan.

31 
that all procurement of goods and works, and recruitment of consultants are in compliance with 
ADB relevant rules and procedures; (iii) manage communications and timely advise ADB and the 
EA/IA on procurement issues that may impact the achievement of project outcomes; (iv) ensure 
that  procurement  activities  are  scheduled  in  a  timely  manner,  and  relevant  documents  are 
completed on time with high-quality; (v) provide technical assistance to BEC/CSC when required; 
(vi)  build  procurement  capacity  of  BEC/CSC  members;  (vii)  assist  the  EA/IA  in  accepting  final 
products/deliverables/ outputs; (viii) update procurement plan for approval by the PSC and ADB; 
and (ix) prepare quarterly and yearly procurement management reports and submit to ADB, the 
EA/IA and the PSC. 
52. 
In  order  to  achieve  value  for  money,  items  with  similar  nature,  delivery  schedule,  and 
location  are  grouped  into  same  package  in  order  to  minimize  the  number  bidding  processes, 
hence  reducing  administrative  costs.  In  addition,  the  Community  Participation  in  Procurement 
method is adopted to reduce operational costs for labor intensive small works and to increase 
income for local communities. In-kind contribution by beneficiaries is also introduced to increase 
ownership  of  the  investment.  Moreover,  the  national  e-procurement  system  will  be  used  for 
publication  of  procurement  notices  and  for  bidding  of  OCB  (national  advertisement)  and  RFQ 
contracts on a pilot basis, to improve competition, transparency, economy, and efficiency. 
A. 
Advance Contracting 
53. 
All  advance contracting will  be  undertaken  in  conformity  with  ADB  Procurement  Policy: 
Goods, Works, Non-consulting and Consulting Services and Procurement Regulations for ADB 
Borrowers: Goods, Works, Non-consulting and Consulting Services (2017, as amended from time 
to time). The executing agency shall submit an official request to MOF and acquire necessary 
endorsements to conduct advance procurement in accordance to the Government Regulation on 
Advance Procurement. The issuance of IFBs under advance contracting will be subject to ADB 
approval. Advance contracting will be applied for hiring four PMU core staff. Advance actions will 
include advertisement, selection, and endorsement of proposed PMU positions by ADB. However, 
contract  signing  can  only  occur  after  loan  signing.  All  advance  actions  will  be  undertaken  in 
conformity with ADB Procurement Policy and Regulations.31 
B. 
Procurement of Goods, Works, and Consulting Services 
54. 
The  procurement  of  all  ADB  financed  works,  goods,  non-consulting  services,  and 
consulting  services  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB  Procurement  Policy  and 
Regulations.  The  project  will  be  the  pilot  project  to  use  the  national  e-procurement  system  for 
publication  of  procurement  notices  and  for  bidding  of  OCB  (national  advertisement)  and  RFQ 
contracts as agreed with the IT and e-Procurement Division of the State Procurement Agency. 
The project procurement risk assessment confirmed  that the national e-procurement system is 
generally well-functioning and secured, and it does not prevent participation of potential bidders. 
55. 
A  procurement  plan,  indicating methods,  and  review  procedures  for  works,  goods,  and 
consulting service packages, is developed for the project. The project will take a demand-driven 
approach to the investments at the soum level. The package estimates in the procurement plan 
are  based  on  the  FSR.  However,  the  actual  demands  will  be  defined  by  the  sub-agreements 
approved by the Soum Steering Committee and may be subject to changes in each year. The 
actual demands at the soum level will be determined and sub-agreements will be submitted to 
the PMU no later than 15 December of each fiscal year, based on which the PMU will update the 
31 Available at: https://www.adb.org/documents/adb-procurement-policy  
32 
procurement plan for approval by the PSC and ADB. 
1. 
Open Competitive Bidding 
Open  competitive  bidding  (OCB)  with  national  advertisement  will  be  used  for  all  goods 
56. 
and works contracts except small value, readily available off-the shelves goods and works. OCB 
with international advertisement is not envisaged under this project. 
For procurement under OCB to be advertised nationally, the procurement notice will be 
57. 
advertised on the e-procurement system of Mongolia or a national press; the standard bidding 
documents developed by MOF and approved by ADB in Mongolian language will be used; the 
currency  for  bidding  and  payment  will  be  Mongolian  Tugrik,  unless  otherwise  agreed  between 
MOF/MOFALI and ADB; and the single-stage, one-envelope bidding procedure will be followed. 
2. 
Request for Quotations 
Request  for  quotations  (RFQ)  will  be  used  for  readily  available  goods,  standard-
58. 
specification commodities  of  small  value, standard or  routine  services,  or  simple  civil  works  of 
small value. RFQs shall indicate the description and quantity of the goods, a description of the 
services or specifications of works, as well as desired delivery (or completion) time and place. 
3. 
Direct Contracting 
59. 
Direct contracting (DC) will be used to procure livestock management information system 
(LMIS),  GIS  desktop  software,  and  statistical  software.  LMIS  ArcGIS  desktop  software  and 
statistical software will be directly procured from Monmap LLC as it is the official sole distributor 
of ESRI in Mongolia. The DC method is proposed because there is only one established software 
service provider and the contract amount is very small. 
4. 
Community Participation in Procurement 
60. 
Community-driven  works,  goods  and  services  will  be  procured  using  the  community 
participation in procurement (CPP) method. CPP will follow the national procedures and sample 
bidding  documents  for  this  method.  Citizens  shall  enter  into  a  cooperation  agreement  in

SAFEGUARDS 
72. 
Prohibited  investment  activities.  Pursuant  to  ADB’s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement 
(2009),  ADB  funds  may  not  be  applied  to  the  activities  described  on  the  ADB  Prohibited 
Investment Activities List set forth at Appendix 5 of the Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). 
A. 
Environment 
Institutional  arrangements.  The  project  is  classified  by  ADB  as  Category  B  for 
73. 
environment.  The  project  environmental  safeguard  assessments  and  documents  comprise  an 
initial environmental examination (IEE) including an environmental management plan (EMP). The 
EMP  is  in  Appendix  1  of  the  IEE,  and  Appendix  5  of  the  PAM.  The  EMP  covers  all  project 
components. The IEE, and EMP have been prepared in compliance with ADB’s Safeguard Policy 
Statement (2009). For all project matters relating to environmental safeguards, the EMP forms 
the basis of the official loan agreement between ADB and the executing agency. For domestic 
requirements,  in  accordance  with  Mongolia’s  Law  on  EIA  (2012),  environmental  baseline 
assessments  have  been  prepared  and  General EIA (GEIA)  Letters for the  project  investments 
have been issued by the EIA Division of the Ministry of Environment and Tourism (MET). The 
GEIA Letters issued by MET indicated that no Detailed EIAs (a requirement under national law 
for projects assessed to have potentially significant environmental safeguard risks) are required. 
Public consultation will continue during project implementation, and additional due diligence will 
occur  if  warranted  by  the  finalized  project  investment  designs  including  additional  EBAs  and 
preparation of GEIA applications for the MET to meet national EIA requirements. For each project 
soum, the specific locations of the individual project facilities – including PIU buildings, livestock 
shelters, and wells – will be finalized during project implementation and will need to comply with 
site selection criteria described in the IEE and EMP. 
40 
Content  of  the  EMP.  The  EMP  describes  (i)  the  project  environmental  safeguard 
74. 
objectives,  (ii)  roles  and  responsibilities  for  EMP  implementation,  (iii)  mitigation  measures,  (iv) 
inspection, monitoring, and reporting arrangements, (v) training and institutional strengthening, 
(vi)  a  project-specific  grievance  redress  mechanism,  (vii)  public  consultation  during  project 
implementation,  (viii)  a  COVID-19  risk  management  plan,  and  (ix)  a  feedback  and  adjustment 
mechanism.  The  EMP  identifies  specific  roles  and  responsibilities  for  all  agencies  that  will  be 
involved  in  EMP  implementation.  The  scope  and  content  of  the  EMP  comply  with  ADB’s 
Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) for environmental safeguards and Mongolia’s environmental 
laws and regulations. The EMP also describes the site selection criteria that all project locations 
are required to comply with (see Table EMP-2 in the EMP: row “Site Selection Criteria”). All project 
agencies are required to comply with the EMP. After the project sites are confirmed and finalized, 
the IEE and EMP will be updated as needed: specifically, to ensure that (i) any new risks arising 
from the project sites, and which are not covered by the IEE and EMP, are identified, and (ii) the 
mitigation, monitoring, and reporting measures in the EMP adequately address the environmental 
safeguard management for all sites. No site works will proceed until the IEE and EMP has been 
updated as needed and re-disclosed on the ADB website. 
75. 
EMP implementation. The EMP will be implemented in all phases of the project: design, 
pre-construction, construction, and operation. The PMU will be responsible for ensuring that the 
project will be designed, constructed, decommissioned, and operated in accordance with (i) the 
national and local government environmental, health, and safety laws, regulations, procedures, 
and guidelines; (ii) the ADB’s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), and (iii) the IEE including the 
EMP.  The  executing  agency, through  the  PMU,  holds final  responsibility  for  implementation  of 
and compliance with the EMP. As a high priority, MOFALI and the PMU will ensure compliance 
with  the  EMP  requirements  to  address  risks  to  sustainable  use  of  groundwater  and  waste 
management for human and livestock facilities. 
76. 
For preparation of the detailed engineering designs for the project, the PMU will forward 
the  EMP  to  the  design  firms  that  will  be  recruited  for  each  package.  The  PMU  environment 
safeguard specialist and PIU technical teams will work with these firms to ensure that safeguard 
risks  identified  in  the  EMP  are  considered  in  the  detailed  designs  and  avoided,  minimized,  or 
mitigated. The EMP will be further updated upon finalization of sites and upon completion of the 
detailed design, as needed. To ensure that bidders respond to the EMP provisions, the PMU will 
prepare  and  provide  the  following  specification  clauses  for  incorporation  into  the  bidding 
documents: (i) a list of environmental management requirements to be budgeted by the bidders 
in  their  proposals;  (ii)  environmental  clauses  for  contractual  terms  and  conditions;  and  (iii)  the 
EMP, and domestic environmental assessments, for compliance. All tenders involving civil works 
will be required to include and fully address the EMP requirements, especially the mitigation and 
monitoring measures.  
Personnel.  The  EMP  will  be  under  the  responsibility  and  coordination  of  the  following 
77. 
agencies: (i) MOFALI, the executing agency, is responsible for the overall implementation of the 
EMP, (ii) the Livestock Policy Implementation and Coordination Department of MOFALI, the IA, 
will oversee EMP implementation, and (iii) the PMU environmental safeguard specialist (national; 
part-time  over  6  years),  supported  by  the  PMU  coordinator  and  other  PMU  positions,  will  be 
responsible for overall coordination of EMP implementation. The PIC, led by the PIC team leader 
and supported by the other PIC positions, will assist the environmental safeguard officer of the 
PMU will updating and implementing the EMP. At the aimag level, the four aimag PIUs will assist 
the  PMU  with  day-to-day  implementation  of  the  EMP.  Each  PIU  will  include  one  aimag 
environment safeguard focal officer (from the Aimag Department of Environment and Tourism) 
and one water resources officer (a representative from the MET river basin authority covering the 
41 
relevant river basins and soums) i.e. a minimum of two focal officers per aimag. These focal points 
will  be  part  of  the  project  counterpart  support,  and  they  will  work  with  the  PMU  environment 
safeguard specialist and loan-funded PIU teams to ensure effective implementation of the EMP 
at the aimag, soum, and site levels. At the end of the first year of project implementation, the EA 
and  ADB  will  assess  whether  the  number  of  person-months  allocated  for  the  position  of  PMU 
environment safeguard specialist position is sufficient to ensure effective implementation of the 
project EMP. Pending the results of this assessment, a portion of the loan budget will be allocated 
toward supporting additional person-months for the position, as needed. 
78. 
Capacity building. MOFALI has previous experience in implementing ADB projects, but 
the  aimag  and  soum  governments  do  not  have  such  experience.  To  ensure  effective 
implementation  of the  EMP,  a  capacity  building program  is  included  in the  EMP for training  of 
project agencies in EMP implementation, mitigation measures, supervision, monitoring, reporting, 
and  the  grievance  redress  mechanism.  Training  will  be  provided  by  the  PMU  environment 
safeguard  specialist.  Trainees  will  include  staff  of  the  IA,  PIUs,  contractors,  construction 
supervision companies, and aimag and soum staff. 
79. 
Procedures for feedback and adjustment of the EMP, including in the event of non-
compliance.  Based  on-site  inspections  and  monitoring  reports,  the  PMU  shall  decide,  in 
consultation with the IA and PIC, whether (i) further mitigation measures are required as corrective 
actions,  or  (ii)  improvements  are  required  for  environmental  management  practices.  The 
effectiveness  of  mitigation  measures  and  monitoring  plans  will  be  evaluated  by  a  feedback 
reporting  system.  Adjustment  to  the  EMP  will  be  made,  if  necessary,  after  the  proposed 
adjustments  are  reviewed  and  endorsed  by  the  executing  agency  and  ADB.  The  PMU 
environment safeguard specialist and PMU social and gender specialist will play critical roles in 
the feedback and adjustment mechanism. If during inspection and monitoring, non-compliance 
with the EMP is observed, or any changes are made to the project that may cause substantial 
adverse  environmental  impacts  or  increase  the  number  of  affected  people,  then  the  PMU  will 
immediately report to the IA, who will consult with ADB and form an environmental assessment 
team to conduct additional environmental assessment. If necessary, further public consultation 
will be undertaken. A new or updated domestic environmental assessment(s) and IEE (including 
EMP)  will  be  prepared  and  submitted  to  ADB  for  review,  appraisal,  and public  disclosure.  The 
revised EMP will be passed to the contractors, construction supervision consultants (CSC) and 
operators of the project facilities, for implementation.

Climate  change.  Climate  mitigation  is  estimated  to  cost  $16.8  million  and  climate 
adaptation is  estimated  to  cost  $5.2 million.  ADB  will  finance  100%  of mitigation  and 100%  of 
adaptation costs.33 
B. 
Involuntary Resettlement 
82. 
The project is classified as category B on involuntary resettlement safeguards. The project 
will  adopt  a  community  demand-driven  approach  and  civil  works  will  be  based  on  proposals 
submitted by PUGs during the project implementation. All civil works are expected to be located 
on state-owned land or existing right-of-way without acquisition of private or community owned 
lands.  However,  specific  locations  of  the  civil  works  will  be  decided  by  the  PUGs  during 
33  Details  are  in  the  Climate  Change  Assessment  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in  the  report  and 
recommendation of the President to the Board). 
42 
implementation and there may be some unavoidable minor involuntary resettlement impacts, such 
as temporary land uses and damages to structures during construction. A resettlement framework 
has been prepared since the project adopts the demand-driven approach and the footprint of the 
civil works will be known only during the project implementation.34 The resettlement framework 
describes  key  principles  for  selection  of  sites  for  civil  works,  screening  processes,  situations 
where a due diligence report or a resettlement plan may be required, and allocation of counterpart 
funds  and  implementation  in  case  there  will  be  involuntary  resettlement  impacts.  The  project 
executing/implementing agencies have experience of ADB projects, but no specific experience 
on  ADB  social  safeguards.  The  project  design  includes  measures  for  capacity  building  of  the 
project executing/implementing agencies and inputs of a social safeguard and gender specialist 
support for implementation of the resettlement framework. 
The EA/IA/PMU will implement the Resettlement Framework with the help of social focal 
83. 
staff and project implementation consultants. Local government in relevant project soum will also 
be involved in project implementation. A social safeguard and gender specialist to be recruited at 
PMU  will  support  the  EA/IA/PMU  to  follow  the  resettlement  framework  during  the  project 
implementation.  Appendix  1  includes  the  TORs  of  the  social  safeguard and  gender  specialist. 
MOFALI/aimags will also assign one of their staff as the focal point for social safeguard issues. 
C. 
Indigenous Peoples 
84. 
The  project  is  classified  as  category  C  on  indigenous  peoples  according  to  ADB’s 
Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). The project is not expected to impact distinct and vulnerable 
communities  of  indigenous  peoples  or  ethnic  minorities  that  would  trigger  ADB’s  SPS 
requirements on indigenous peoples. A Due Diligence Report on Indigenous Peoples (DDR-IP) 
was prepared as part of the TRTA to confirm that the project does not trigger ADB’s Safeguard 
Policy  Statement  (2009)  on  Indigenous  Peoples  and  will  not  impact  distinct  and  vulnerable 
communities of indigenous peoples. The EA/IA will ensure that the project remains category C 
during the project implementation as well.  
D. 
Grievance Redress Mechanism 
A project grievance redress mechanism (GRM) has been developed in compliance with 
85. 
ADB’s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) requirement to address environmental, health, safety, 
and  social  concerns  associated  with  project.  The  GRM  is  designed  to  achieve  the  following 
objectives: (i) provide channels of communication for local communities to raise concerns about 
environmental and social-related grievances which might result from the project, (ii) prevent and 
mitigate adverse environmental and social impacts to communities caused by project construction 
and operation, and (iii) contribute to cooperation between the project agencies and communities. 
Public grievances related to the project components to be addressed by the GRM may include 
damage  to  public  roads,  interruption  of  public  services,  dust  emissions,  noise,  soil  erosion, 
inappropriate  disposal  of  waste  materials,  and  safety  for  the  general  public  and  construction 
workers. The GRM is accessible to all members of the communities, including women, elderly, 
disabled  youth,  ethnic  groups,  and  poverty-stricken  residents.  Multiple  points  of  entry  are 
available, including face-to-face meetings, written complaints, telephone conversations, e-mail, 
and social media. The details of the GRM, including a time-bound flow chart of procedures, are 
included  in  the  project  EMP  (Appendix  5)  and  in  the  Resettlement  Framework.  The  PMU  will 
maintain an integrated reporting system to document, follow-up, and report all cases. The PMU 
34 Resettlement framework has been disclosed under: https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/mon-53038-001-rf 
43 
environment safeguard specialist and PMU social safeguard and gender specialist will train all 
relevant staff in the GRMs. All project agencies will appoint GRM focal points and actively support 
implementation of the GRM. 
VIII.   POVERTY, SOCIAL AND GENDER DIMENSIONS 
86. 
Poverty  and  social.  The  project  offers  opportunities  for  inclusive  development  and 
poverty  reduction  by  improved  rangeland  conditions,  better  quality  and  hygiene  of  livestock 
products and better traceability leading to income generation for herders. Local people, including 
the poor households, are expected to benefit from socioeconomic opportunities during the project 
implementation  and  operation  phases.  The  total  number  of  herders  in  2019  was  14,576 
households (48,243 persons) including 4,417 poor households. It is estimated that 80% of herders 
will enter into pasture user groups (PUGs)/Rangeland User Agreement (RUAs). About 466 PUGs 
will  be  established  (11,661  households,  38,587  persons)  including  2,332  poor  HH  (7,709 
persons).  Under  Output  1,  herders  who  enter  into  PUGs/RUAs  will  gain  access  to  additional 
project  support  based  on  their  needs  (i.e.,  winter  livestock  shelters,  wells,  fodder  storage, 
equipment  for  haymaking  etc.).  Through  sustainable  pasture  management  and  reduction  of 
animal losses, herders will have higher income. Under output 2, the project will strengthen the 
value chains through improved veterinary and breeding services and creation of cooperatives to 
market their livestock. PUGs members will also receive training on animal health, nutrition, breed 
improvement and feeding. Better quality of livestock products, better access to current markets 
and better prices for their produce, will result in improved incomes. A social development action 
plan (SDAP) has been prepared based on the poverty and social analysis, with specific targets 
for  the  poor  and  vulnerable  people  (Table  12).  The  SDAP  comprises  necessary  actions  and 
indicators under each output to ensure benefit for herders, including the poor. The SDAP also 
includes  measures  to  mitigate  social  risks.  Consultations  were  undertaken  with  stakeholders 
during project preparation and will be continued during project implementation. The consultation 
and participation plan for the project implementation stage has been included as Appendix 6. 
Gender.  The  project  is  classified  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming,  following  ADB’s 
87. 
Guidelines for Gender Mainstreaming Categories of ADB Projects (2012). Women are involved 
in the livestock value chain in all project soums. Women are responsible for herding small stock 
(sheep  and  goats),  milking,  and  the  shearing  and  clipping  of  all  animals.  Women  are  already 
active members of existing PUGs and cooperatives, but they are not actively engaged in decision-
making. Women also need support in capacity building, use of technology and marketing. Women 
were consulted during project preparation and they expressed their strong support for the project. 
A gender action plan (GAP) has been prepared based on the gender analysis to ensure that the 
project  contributes  to  improved  gender  equality.  The  GAP  includes:  (i)  Gender-targeted 
information campaign, on project objectives and activities; (ii) 40% of PUGs members are women 
and  30%  of  PUGs  have  female  leaders;  (iii)  40%  jobs  for  women  during  construction  and 
operation and maintenance (O&M); (iv) 30-50% women among participants during consultations, 
workshop awareness raising and training activities; (v) specific training for women beneficiaries 
on  leadership,  income  generation  activities  and  marketing  techniques;  and  (vi)  30%  of 
PVUs/SVUs are led by women. Key gender targets have also been included in the design and 
monitoring framework.

B. 
Monitoring  
Project performance monitoring. To monitor the progress of the project in achieving the 
88. 
planned outcome and outputs, MOFALI will coordinate with the PMU for the establishment and 
maintenance  of  the  project  performance  management  system  (PPMS)—equivalent  to  the 
management information system—which will permit adequate flexibility to adopt remedial action 
regarding  project  design,  schedules,  activities,  and  development  impacts.35  In  addition,  risk 
management  for  the  project  shall  be  incorporated  in  the  PPMS.  The  monitoring  will  cover  all 
indicators listed in the design and monitoring framework as well as the indicators reflecting the 
development results contributed by the project. The PPMS will cover the following aspects of the 
project  implementation:  (i)  project  physical  and  financial  progress;  (ii)  progress  and  results  of 
capacity development; (iii) implementation of the EMP; (iv) implementation of the GAP, SDAP, 
and RF; and (v) compliance with loan covenants (policy, financial, economic, sector, and others). 
The  MOFALI  agrees  that  they  will  (i)  establish  the  PPMS;  (ii)  recruit  the  loan 
89. 
implementation consultants to provide consulting service as described in Appendix 1; (iii) confirm 
that targets are achievable; and (iv) develop recording, monitoring, and reporting arrangements. 
At the beginning of project implementation, the PMU will finalize the comprehensive PPMS 
90. 
procedures to systematically generate data in the above areas. The PMU will refine the PPMS 
framework,  confirm  achievable  targets  and  the  monitoring  and  recording  arrangements,  and 
establish relevant systems, and procedures not later than 6 months after project implementation 
begins. The IA, and the PMU will assign staff or consultants to collect baseline and progress data 
at the requisite time intervals, including progress report on the implementation of the EMP, GAP, 
SDAP,  and  RF.  The  PMU  will  be  responsible  for  analyzing  and  consolidating  reported  data 
through its management information system, and reporting outcomes to ADB through semiannual 
progress reports. 
91. 
A project progress report, monitoring the project inputs and activities, should be submitted 
to  ADB  semi-annually  starting  from  project  inception.  These  semiannual  progress  reports  and 
project  monitoring  and  evaluation  reports  will  provide  information  necessary  to  update  ADB‘s 
PPMS. 
92. 
Promptly after physical completion of the project, but in any event not later than 6 months 
thereafter or such later date as ADB may agree for this purpose, MOFALI will prepare and submit 
to  ADB  a  project  completion  report,  in  such  form  and  in  such  detail  as  ADB  shall  reasonably 
request,  on  the  implementation  and  evaluation  of  the  project,  including  project  description,

document/33431/pai-5-08.pdf 
56 
evaluation of design and implementation, evaluation of performance, and overall assessment and 
recommendations. 
93. 
Compliance monitoring. During project implementation, ADB and MOFALI will closely 
monitor the compliance of all the covenants under the project; and will take necessary remedy 
actions  for  any  non-compliance.  The  compliance  status  will  be  reported  in  the  semiannual 
progress  report  by  MOFALI  and  will  be  reviewed  during  project  review  missions.  Compliance 
monitoring will also be undertaken by (i) the PMU environment safeguard specialist, supported 
by the PMU, PIUs, and PIC to ensure overall compliance of all relevant agencies with the EMP 
(see below), and (ii) the PMU social and gender specialist, to ensure overall compliance with the 
relevant  social,  gender,  and  resettlement  framework.  Semiannual  environmental  monitoring 
reports and social monitoring reports will be prepared by the PMU and submitted by the PMU to 
ADB. 
94. 
Environmental safeguards monitoring. The EMP (Appendix 5) includes a monitoring 
plan  for  the  pre-construction,  construction,  and  operation  phases  of  the  project.  Two  types  of 
monitoring will be conducted in accordance with the EMP: (i) environmental impact monitoring, to 
be conducted by the contractors and supervised by the PMU environment safeguard specialist 
and PIUs; and (ii), overall compliance monitoring, to ensure the EMP requirements  – including 
the impact monitoring as well as mitigation and reporting requirements – are being implemented. 
The compliance monitoring will be conducted by the PMU environment safeguard specialist. The 
monitoring  will  in  particular  assess  compliance  with  project  measures to manage  groundwater 
use and waste management. ADB will review project compliance with the EMP on the basis of 
semiannual  environmental  monitoring  reports  provided  by  the  PMU  and  review  missions.  The 
monitoring plan will determine how well prescribed mitigation measures of EMP are working and 
will document any unexpected impacts of the project investments on the environment. 
95. 
Environment  safeguard  reporting  and  disclosure.  The  PMU  will  submit  semiannual 
environmental  monitoring  reports  to  ADB.  The  reports  will  include:  (i)  progress  made  for  EMP 
implementation,  (ii)  overall  effectiveness  of  the  EMP  implementation  (including  public  and 
occupational health and safety), (iii) environmental monitoring and compliance, (iv) institutional 
strengthening  and  training,  (v)  public  consultation  (including  GRM),  and  (vi)  any  problems 
encountered during construction and operation, and the relevant corrective actions undertaken. 
ADB will review and disclose the reports on the ADB website. 
96. 
Environmental completion auditing. Following national regulations, upon completion of 
the  project  facilities,  environmental  completion  audits  will  be  issued  by  the  relevant  national 
agencies e.g., General Agency for Specialized Inspection. These audits will be included in the 
semiannual EMP monitoring reports to ADB. 
Social  safeguard  monitoring.  A  resettlement  framework  has  been  prepared  which 
97. 
includes key principles for site selection for civil works, screening procedures and situations where 
a due diligence report or a resettlement plan are required. The PMU with the assistance of social 
and  gender  specialist  will  ensure  overall  compliance  and  implementation  of  the  resettlement 
framework. The project’s progress reports will include information on the status of implementation 
of resettlement framework. 
98. 
Gender  and  social  dimensions  monitoring.  Monitoring  of  the  GAP  and  SDAP 
implementation will be conducted, and the targets are specified in the relevant action plans, and 
some  indicators  are  also  included  in  the  design  and monitoring  framework.  To  implement  and 
monitor  social  and  gender  measures  properly,  MOFALI  and  project  aimags  will  appoint  social 
57 
safeguard  and  gender  focal  points  for  implementation  and  social  monitoring.  A  national  social 
safeguard  and  gender  specialist  will  be  engaged  under  the  PMU.  The  specialist  will  assist the 
PMU  in setting  up  effective  social  and  gender monitoring system  and will  provide  training  and 
capacity building to the focal staff for implementation. Results of monitoring on social and gender 
measures in the SDAP and the GAP will be reported through regular progress reports. 
C. 
Evaluation 
In addition to regular monitoring, project progress and performance will be monitored at 
99. 
least once a year jointly by ADB and MOFALI during the ADB review missions. The review will 
assess implementation performance and achievement of project outcome and outputs, assess 
financial progress, identify issues and constraints affecting implementation, and work out a time-
bound action plan for their resolution. ADB and MOFALI will undertake a midterm review in the 
mid-year of the project implementation period to (i) conduct a detailed evaluation of the project 
scope, implementation arrangements, progress of the overall project and each component, and 
status of achieving the performance targets; and (ii) recommend appropriate measures, including 
changes in the project scope and/or implementation arrangements, reallocation of loan proceeds, 
changes  in  the  ADB  financing  ratios,  and  extension  of  the  loan  closing  date.  Promptly  after 
physical completion of the project, but in any event not later than 6 months thereafter or such later 
date  as  ADB  may  agree  for  this  purpose,  MOFALI  will  prepare  and  submit  to  ADB  a  project 
completion  report,  in  such  form  and  in  such  detail  as  ADB  shall  reasonably  request,  on  the 
implementation and evaluation of the project.36
D. 
Reporting 
100.  MOFALI  will  provide  ADB  with  (i)  semiannual  progress  reports  in  a  format  that  is 
acceptable to ADB (format of the progress report included in Appendix 7), including (a) progress 
achieved  by  output  as  measured  through  the  indicator's  performance  targets,  (b)  key

Stakeholder Communication Strategy 
102.  Project  information  will  be  disclosed  through  ADB’s  and  government’s  websites,  the 
Consultation and Participation Plan (CPP), meetings, interviews, focus group discussions, and 
community  consultation  meetings,  in  accordance  with  requirements  of  ADB’s  information 
disclosure  policy.  Main  stakeholders  are  MOFALI,  participating  soums,  herders, 
PUGs/RUAs/Cooperatives members, public, and private veterinary units and participants in the 
project implementation.  
103.  Environment.  Meaningful  consultation,  participation,  and  information  disclosure  were 
conducted  during  preparation  of  the  IEE  pursuant  to  the  SPS  (2009).  However,  because  of 
COVID-19 the consultations were modified in accordance with national requirements for safety 
and  distancing,  as  follows:  (i)  an  initial  questionnaire  was  given  to  the  soum  governors  who 
distributed questionnaire to bagh representatives for their residents; and (ii) after the results of 
the questionnaires were compiled, face-to-face consultations in groups of 4-5 in the soums were 
conducted.  The  results  of  the  questionnaires  and  in-person  consultations  were  compiled 
separately and reported in the IEE. Public consultations and information disclosure will continue 
with the project soum communities during implementation: these consultations will be arranged 
and  facilitated  by  the  PMU  environment  safeguard  specialist  and  PMU  social  and  gender 
specialist, supported by the PIU teams and aimag and soum focal points. It is possible that for at 
least the first year of implementation, consultation procedures will be required to follow the same 
approach as during project preparation because of COVID-19 risks. 
and 
104.  Social  and  gender.  Consultations  with  communities  were  conducted  during  project 
preparation; and will be continued during the implementation of the GAP, SDAP, and RF. Project 
information will be shared with communities during implementation, covering (i) project contents, 
for 
scope, 
PUGs/RUAs/Cooperatives; (iii) local employment opportunities; (iii) SDAP/GAP targets and RF 
measures;  (iv)  construction  periods  and  timing;  (v)  Grievance  Redress  Mechanism;  and  (vi) 
project  training  and  other  information.  Feedbacks  received  during  consultation  will  be 
incorporated in the project design. Special attention will be paid to the participation of women, the 
poor, and other vulnerable groups.

ANTICORRUPTION POLICY 
107.  ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any violations of the 
Anticorruption  Policy  relating  to  the  project.37  All  contracts  financed  by  ADB  shall  include 
provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the 
executing agency and all project contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers. 
Individuals and/or entities on ADB’s anticorruption debarment list are ineligible to participate in 
the ADB financed activity and may not be awarded any contracts under the project.38
108.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  are  included  in  the  loan  and  project 
agreements and the bidding documents for the project.  
XI. 
ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISM 
109.  People  who  are,  or may  in the  future  be,  adversely  affected  by the  project  may  submit 
complaints  to  ADB’s  Accountability  Mechanism.  The  Accountability  Mechanism  provides  an 
independent forum and process whereby people adversely affected by the ADB-assisted projects 
can voice and seek a resolution of their problems, as well as report alleged violations of ADB’s 
operational  policies  and  procedures.  Before  submitting  a  complaint  to  the  Accountability 
Mechanism, affected people should make an effort in good faith to solve their problems by working 
with  the  concerned  ADB  operations  department.  Only  after  doing  that,  and  if  they  are  still

XII. 
RECORD OF CHANGES TO THE PROJECT ADMINISTRATION MANUAL 
110.  All revisions and/or updates during the course of implementation should be retained in this 
section to provide a chronological history of changes to implemented arrangements recorded in 
the  project  administration  manual,  including  revision  to  contract  awards  and  disbursement  s-
curves.

a. 
Background 
The  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  competitiveness  and  sustainability  of 
66. 
Mongolia’s livestock sector improved (Mongolia Sustainable Development Vision 2030).1 
67. 
 The  project  has  the  following  outcome:  efficiency  and  sustainability  of  climate-resilient 
livestock  production  increased  in  the  project  areas.  The  project  has  three  outputs:  (i)  climate 
resilience of livestock, pasture, and water management improved; (ii) Meat and dairy value chains 
strengthened; and (iii) livestock sector regulatory framework and capacity enhanced.2 
b. 
Objective 
Due to the demand-driven approach agreed for project implementation, it was not possible 
68. 
during  project  preparation  to  identify  all  specific  activities  that  would  be  included  at 
implementation.  As  a  result  it  is  necessary  to  undertake  additional  Environmental  Baseline 
Assessments  (EBAs)  as  required  by  the  Aimag  Environmental  Departments  to  ensure  the 
environmental acceptability of specific activities proposed for financing under the project 
69. 
The main  objective  of  each  EBA  is  to  contribute  to  the  planning  and  developing  of  the 
project  by  describing  the  state  of  the  environment  affected  by  the  project  with  participation  of 
professional organizations and scientific research methodology to ensure success toward project 
objectives. 
70. 
The purpose of the assignment is to identify potential impacts of planned activities on the 
environment  before  commencement  of  their  implementation  and  to  support  MOFALI  and  the 
aimag  in  ensuring  compliance  with  the  Mongolian  Law  on  Environmental  Impact  Assessment 
(passed in 1998, last amended in 2012) and ADB’s Safeguard Policy Statement (SPS) (2009).3 
71. 
This will include following: 
(i) 
(ii) 
Develop complete description of the environment of the project sites; 
Identify the project potential risks and scope of impacts during (construction phase) 
and after the project implementation (operation phase); 
Suggest needs for safeguarding of each affected environmental component; 
Suggest  mitigation  measures  for  each  potential  impact  on  each  affected 
environmental component; 
Preparation of stakeholder analysis, participation plan; 
Prepare EBA report that provides all required data and information; 
Prepare and submit complete GEIA application for project to Aimag Environmental 
Department and obtain official letter from the Aimag Environmental Department.

should  be  willing  to  contribute to a  soum  pasture  development  fund  (existing  or 
newly created), equal to at least 20% of the project investments. 
The  specific  location  of  the  project  facilities  will  be  finalized  as  part  of  the  detailed 
5. 
engineering designs. Sites will be selected to fully comply with the following criteria: 
•  All  activities  will  be  strictly  limited  to modified  lands already  used for  livestock  grazing  (for 
livestock  grazing,  fodder  plots,  and  wells)  and  rural  use  (for  the  office  buildings,  livestock 
holding  facilities,  and  cashmere  sorting  facilities).  The  project  will  not  involve  any  land 
conversion or the establishment of new pasture lands. 
•  No project activities, including new wells, will be located in any protected areas  – whether 
national-  or  local-level,  or  other  sites  of  designated  environmental  or  cultural  significance, 
including  documented  Important  Bird  and  Biodiversity  Areas,  Ramsar  wetlands,  and 
UNESCO  Biosphere  Reserves,  even  if  these  sites  are  not  officially  designated  by 
government. 
•  No clearance or damage of natural habitats. 
•  New wells will be located in areas where the groundwater supply has been demonstrated by 
the  follow-up  aquifer  assessments  (to  be  conducted  during  project  implementation)  to  be 
sustainable. No sites for wells and/or aquifers will be used in which the hydrological surveys 
indicate  a  risk  of  unsustainability,  especially  when  cumulative  use  (existing  demand)  and 
projected declines in aquifer recharge because of climate change are considered. 
•  Siting of the office buildings, livestock holding facilities, cashmere sorting facilities, and new 
wells will not be located upslope of physical cultural resources and sacred sites, including the 
documented sites listed in Section IV.H of the IEE, to minimize direct or indirect disturbance 
and to avoid potential cultural disrespect. Exceptions to this criterion will only be accepted if 
based  on  clear  documentation  of  public  consultations  agreeing  to  such  exception, 
accompanied by government endorsement.  
•  For the livestock holding facilities, these will be located at least 500 meters and downwind 
from the nearest residences, to minimize odor-related disturbance. 
Selection criteria for the locations of  all project investments including proposed  pasture 
6. 
water points are as follows: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
not  in  or  near  national  protected  areas,  or  international  protected  areas  (e.g., 
UNESCO Biosphere Reserves, IBA sites, Ramsar wetland sites), or not near or 
within the drainage catchments of national or international protected sites; 
intended water users must meet with the above-mentioned criteria set for herder 
groups; and 
intended water point must be used following the pasture use plan of herder groups.

SUBPROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS 
A. 
Aimag Level Subprojects 
The investments in project soums will be structured through four aimag subprojects. Each 
1. 
aimag subproject will consist of an aggregation of soum level annual targets which align with the 
project  outputs:  grazing  management,  animal  health,  breeding,  feeding,  marketing,  and 
environment. The structure for soum indicators and targets is shown in Table 1.

The soum- and aimag-targets are living targets that can be updated each year, based on 
2. 
experiences during implementation. The development of the targets for the aimag subprojects, 
based  on  the  targets  for  each  soum,  will  be  a  participatory  process.  However,  it  is  part  of  the 
overall project agreement that each soum should have reached 88% of starting livestock units 
(LSU) by the end of the project, and have rangeland use agreement (RUA) in place by the end of 
the project that will lead to a level of 82% of starting LSU by the end of Year 8. 
B. 
Soum Level Subprojects 
Once the aimag subprojects are agreed, soum level entities can submit proposals for first-
3. 
generation  sub-agreements.  The  Project  Management  Unit  (PMU)  in  collaboration  with  the 
Project Implementation Consultant (PIC), will provide the templates, and guidelines for the sub-
agreement proposals, the basic structure of which will be similar across all soums for the specific 
types  of  sub-agreements.  The  process  is  therefore  demand-driven  but  within  an  agreed 
Appendix 4 
105 
framework. 
4. 
The sub-agreement proposal process of itself builds capacity in business planning, and 
principles  of  investment.  The  approach  recognizes  that  the  major  factor  affecting  success  or 
otherwise of an investment is the motivation of the people involved. 
Objectives.  The  sub-agreements  aim  to  establish  the  organizational  structures, 
5. 
relationships,  and  agreements  to  create  an  enabling  environment  for  value  chains  to  function. 
They support the development of value chains through project support to the key private or public 
sector entities along the value chain, and to the support to forward and backward linkages along 
the value chain. 
Project support is designed to reduce some of the risk of investment in improving the value 
6. 
chains, through financing civil works, equipment and supplies, and services. The sub-agreements 
will contribute to all three project outputs. The general structure of a sub-agreement is shown in 
(Figure  1).  The  project  finances  civil  works,  equipment,  and  supplies  and  services  to  soum 
government  bodies  or  equipment,  supplies,  and  services  to  various  business  units  that  are 
engaged in a value chain. The project des not finance any civil works that go directly to private 
business units. The project can finance construction of civil works in the soum that belong to the 
soum government. The soum can rent or (issue of user-rights) to private business units. In any 
sub-agreement, the soum government or the business units will be expected to contribute their 
own human, physical, and financial resources. The feasibility of the sub-agreement is measured 
by the feasibility of the individual business plans of the business units and the soum government, 
and  the  functionality  of  the  linkages  between  them.  The  investment  analysis  of  the  project  is 
measured against the project costs and the contribution to the project outputs, comparing with- 
and  without-project  scenarios.  The  general structure  of  a sub-agreement proposal  is  shown in 
Figure 1.

7. 
The sub-agreements in combination with the capacity building aim to strengthen vertical 
and horizontal linkages at the soum, aimag, and national level. This is explained further under 
each sub-agreement description. 
Types  of  sub-agreements.  There  are  seven  types  of  sub-agreement  falling  into  two 
8. 
major categories – first- and second-generation sub-agreements (Figure 2).

First-Generation  sub-agreements.  The  soum  can  submit  proposals  for  PUG/RUA 
11. 
establishment sub-agreements from the start of the project. When an individual bag has 80% of 
herders  in  the  bag  registered  as  PUGs  and  with  RUAs,  a  proposal  can  be  submitted  for  a 
PUG/RUA implementation sub-agreement. The PUG/RUA sub-agreement continues until either 
PUG/RUA targets are reached or the soum believes it cannot develop any more. 
Second-Generation  sub-agreements.  Proposals 
12. 
for  second-generation  sub-
agreements will only be accepted when two pre-conditions have been met. Firstly, that two bagh-
level  PUG/Neg  nutag  Pasture  Alliances  have  been  established,  with  membership  of  80%  of 
herders  in  the  bagh  who  have  established  PUGs  and  entered  into  RUA  agreements  with  the 
soum; and that the minutes of the first Alliance meeting have been tabled. Secondly that the soum 
level  Soum  Pasture  Society  has  been  established  based  on  the  membership  of  at  least  two 
PUG/Neg  nutag  Pasture  Alliances,  and  the  chiefs  of  the  other  baghs,  which  have  not  formed 
PUG/Neg nutag Pasture Alliances, and the minutes of one meeting have been tabled. 
13. 
improving 
productivity  and protecting  the  natural resource is  the most  important  work  of  the  project.  The 
Improving  grazing  management  and  reducing  stocking  rates 
thereby 
108 
Appendix 4 
PUG/RUA implementation sub-agreements, and those on breeding, feeding and marketing are 
part of the incentive system for herders to form RUAs and agree on RUAs with the soum. Another 
way of  stating this  is  that  if  herders  are  interested in improving  productivity  and  protecting  the 
natural  resource  for  future  generations,  the  most  important  thing  they  need  to  do  is  reduce 
stocking rates to increase the average dry matter intake per head which is the most important 
determinant of productivity. 
Process: The sub-agreement proposal process varies between sub-agreements but will 
14. 
generally be a two-stage process. In the first stage, the applicants will submit a sub-agreement 
profile to the Soum Steering Committee (SSC) with a copy to the PMU. If the profile is approved 
by the SSC for further development, the business units will develop a full proposal. The business 
units submit the final proposal to the GS, with SSC in copy. The GS makes recommendations to 
the project coordinator to approve or otherwise the proposal. 
Content: The sub-agreement proposals include a business plan for each of the business 
15. 
units along the value chain, whether they be public or private sector entities. The business plan 
should include a with- and without-project analysis to show how each unit will benefit from the 
sub-agreement. For private sector units the business plan should show costs and income, while 
for public sector units only costs will be relevant. The final business unit in each proposal should 
either  be  herders,  or  downstream  processors  of  livestock  or  livestock  products.  The  sub-
agreement proposal must show how the sub-agreement will contribute to one or more of the three 
project outputs. The investment analysis takes account of the whole of the investment measured 
against the contribution to the project outputs, as well as the feasibility of the business plans for 
each entity in the value chain. The proposal should show the proposed contributions of each of 
the entities to the sub-agreement implementation. 
16. 
The period of the business plan may well go beyond the period of the sub-agreement or 
the period of the project. The business plan should reflect the actual plan to make the business 
work, including replacement of major capital items. 
17. 
The  project  loan  contribution  to  the  sub-agreement  includes  provision  of  civil  works, 
equipment, and supplies and services. Where the project loan procures items that fall into various 
categories  of  assets,  the  ownership,  and  use  of  such  assets,  including  operation  and 
maintenance, will be determined by government regulations. 
18. 
The business units’ contributions will be the human and physical and financial resources 
that  they  can  bring  to  the  sub-agreement.  The  project  will  not  finance  salaries  of  the  staff  or 
members  of  the  submitting  entities.  If  business  units  can  raise  loans  to  contribute  to  the  sub-
agreement, then they are free to propose as such. 
The proposal should include a description of the number and type of beneficiaries, how 
19. 
they will benefit, and the system of monitoring and evaluation. 
20. 
The proposal should be signed by any entities who propose to receive project-financed 
items or services. Depending on the value chain, which is the topic of the proposal, it may need 
to be co-signed or have a supporting letter from government agencies responsible for regulations 
or guidelines related to the value chain. 
Period of the proposal: The period of the sub-agreement should be sufficient to show the 
21. 
business units making a return on investment, and of sufficient period to be able to show how the 
investment is contributing to one or more of three project outputs. The period of the business plan 
Appendix 4 
109 
should  be  sufficient  to  show  when  major  capital  items  are  replaced.  Business  plans  will  often 
extend beyond the life of the project, although obviously there can be no contributions from the 
project after the end of the project. For private sector units, return on investment is measured in 
income; for public sector units, the return can be estimated by monetizing against project outputs. 
22. 
The  proposal  should  describe  with-  and  without-project  scenarios.  It  should  show 
investment costs, operation and maintenance, technical support, and income over a period long 
enough to include replacement of major capital items. The proposal should include the with- and 
without-project analysis of herders downstream from submitting entity. This is to ensure that the 
sub-agreements impact on herder productivity can be clearly shown. 
Approval: Upon approval, the sub-agreement proposal becomes a tri-partite agreement 
23. 
between  the  soum,  the  project,  and  the  entities  who  submitted  the  proposal.  Sub-agreement 
proposals should be signed by the submitting entity, with supporting letters from other important 
stakeholders. Since there will be many similar sub-agreements across the 20 soums, PMU works 
to  aggregate  project  financial  commitments  from  a  number  of  approved  sub-agreements.  This 
includes procurement of civil works, equipment, and supplies and consulting and non-consulting 
services. The consulting firm will sub-contract services, based on the list of pre-approved service 
providers developed by the PMU. 
Amendments: While the approved sub-agreements have a specified period, they can be 
24. 
amended  by mutual  agreement  between  the  parties  to the  agreement.  The  amendment  could 
extend the period of the agreement. The amendment can modify the total budget or budget lines 
according to internal project guidelines, for example in cases where costs vary from estimates in 
the proposal. 
Civil works: The ownership and maintenance of assets and replacement, if necessary, at 
25. 
the end of the asset useful use will be decided according to standard government procedures. In 
general, buildings and other civil works will be the property of the soum and use of them by private 
entities  will  be  through  rental  or  other  arrangements,  such  as  operation  and  maintenance  and 
replacement, according to government regulations. 
Services: The Project Implementation Consultants (PIC) and the JFPR consultants will be 
26. 
the main source of services for each of the sub-agreements. The aimag PIC will assist with aimag 
coordination. 
Equipment  and  Supplies:  The  project  will  procure  these  items  according  to  standard 
27. 
procedures. The ownership of these assets will follow government and project guidelines. 
The  PMU  will  aggregate  the  civil  works,  equipment,  and  supplies  and  services  to  be 
28. 
produced across sub-agreements from various soums to facilitate procurement procedures. 
A central theme across several of the sub-agreements is that the soum authority will be 
29. 
supported by the project to build facilities that  will be rented to private sector entities (or user-
rights  agreement)  under  arrangements  to  be  included  into  tripartite  agreements  between  the 
soum, the entity and herder’s Bagh or Soum Khural representatives (Figure A4.3). Rental costs 
should be included in the business plans of the business units. Any income should be included in 
the business plan of the soum for the relevant sub-agreement. 
110

30.  Monitoring: The soum will appoint a Monitoring Focal Point. The focal point should join a 
six-monthly  monitoring  workshop  with  all  soum  monitoring  focal  points  from  all  20  soums, 
organized by the PMU M&E officer. The focal points should enter key sub-agreement activity and 
indicator  data  into  the  MIS  developed  by  the  PMU.  The  soum  coordinator  should  submit  a  6-
monthly and annual report of all sub-agreements being implemented in the soum, according to 
templates developed by the PMU. 
Capacity building: Structures and units involved in sub-agreements will have their capacity 
31. 
increased through the processes of developing and implementing sub-agreements. But there will 
be a need for capacity building driven from the national level, such as training, and accreditation 
programs  to  support  the  systems  being  developed  by  the  subprojects.  These  activities  will  be 
addressed in the capacity building output. 
Governance. Issues around governance of the value chains or institutions involved in the 
32. 
sub-agreements  will  be  addressed  in  the  capacity  building  component,  not  within  the  sub-
agreements.

Subproject  and  Sub-Agreement  Planning  and  Training  Workshop.  The  project  will 
33. 
support a three-day workshop for all PMU and PIC staff to discuss and clarify the subproject and 
sub-agreement  systems  and  processes.  The  procedures 
for  sub-agreement  proposal 
development will be agreed for the different types of sub-agreements. The emphasis will be on 
first-generation sub-agreements, that is PUG/RUA establishment and PUG/RUA implementation. 
The  workshop will  also  include  discussion  on  sub-agreement  processes and  content  including 
business  planning  and  investment  analysis.  Workshop  costs  are  included  under  project

Soum Technical Team Training Workshop. The project will support a three-day training 
course held in Ulaanbaatar. The Consultant and relevant staff from the PMU will train the Aimag 
Focal Points, and Soum Technical Team (STT) on the project overview, aimag subproject and 
sub-agreement structures, processes, and M&E systems. As a part of the training, all participants 
will  develop  example  soum  targets  and  indicators  to  be  aggregated  into  aimag  subprojects. 
Participants  will  develop  example  sub-agreement  profiles  and  proposals,  and  present  to  the 
group. The budget for this activity is in the project management budget (Output 4). 
Aimag  subproject  development  workshop.  The  PMU,  PIC,  STT  from  all  soums  and 
35. 
Aimag Focal Points from all aimags will participate in a regional (four aimag) workshop to agree 
on the targets for each soum, to be aggregated to an aimag subproject. For budgeting purposes 
during  detailed  subproject  design,  each  soum  will  have  one  sub-agreement  on  PUG/RUA 
establishment. There will be one PUG/RUA implementation sub-agreement per bagh. This will 
form the basis for targets related to these sub-agreements. However, it will be up to the soums 
and aimags, in consultation to develop targets for LSU targets and degradation levels. Each soum 
should have a minimum target of 12% reduction in LSU at the end of the project, and a minimum 
of 18% reduction in LSU by the time all LSU reductions have taken place according to the RUAs. 
The budget for this activity is in project management (Output 4). 
Annual Aimag subproject workshop. The PMU, PIC, STT and Aimag Focal Points will 
36. 
participate in annual workshops to be held in each aimag to report progress on the targets and 
indicators  and  to  update  aimag  indicators  and  targets  in  light  of  field  experience  to  date.  The 
budget for this activity is in project management (Output 4). 
Information Campaign in the soums. After the aimag subprojects are agreed, the STT 
37. 
and  PIC  will  make  a concerted  effort  to  make  soum  stakeholders  aware  of the  objectives and 
activities of the project, especially those who are eligible to submit proposal for sub-agreements. 
The project will procure communication materials on the project with contact details and distribute 
them in the target soums. The budget for this activity is in project management (Output 4). This 
will include: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
(v) 
large signboards in each soum showing the soum targets and indicators; 
posters for distribution in soum offices; 
leaflets to explain the project to distribute to herders; 
hats and jackets with project logo for distribution; and 
writing pens with project logo, and writing books with project information. 
Soum  authorities  and  PIC  will  hold  specific  meetings  and  training  for  entities  who  are 
38. 
eligible  to  submit  sub-agreement  proposals.  Eligible  entities  will  need  support  from  the  PIC 
through  the  process  of  submission  of  profiles  and  full  proposals  to  ensure  that  they  are  of 
adequate  quality  before  submission.  The  PMU  will  develop  the  templates  for  profiles  and 
proposals. The PIC will be able to inform the submitting entity of the project and submitting entity 
contributions to the sub-agreement.

First Generation Sub-agreements 
a. 
PUG /RUA establishment sub-agreement 
Objective: The objective of the sub-agreement is to establish the organizational structures, 
39. 
relationships, and agreements that can lead to sustainable pasture management in the soum. At 
the heart of these arrangements is that of the PUG, and the RUA that the PUG enters into with 
the soum government. 
Structures: The overall structure is summarized in Figure 4. There is an average of 120 
40. 
herder households per bagh. Each five households form a Khot ail. Five of the Khot ails form a 
Neg  nutag  Alliance  (each  of  25  herders).  About  five  of  the  Neg  nutag  Alliance  form  a  Nutag 
Pasture Council (each of 125 herders). The Nutag Pasture Council should include all herders in 
the bagh. There should be six Nutag Pasture Councils per soum. The term PUG is considered to 
be equivalent to the more traditional term “Neg nutag Alliance.” 
Figure A4.4: PUG Development Structures and Relationships 
Source: Asian Development Bank. 
The  neg  nutag/usniikhan  is  the  people  live  in  the  same  ecological  environment,  where 
41. 
herders  together  possess  the  same  pasture  or  water  resources,  and  salt  marshes.  There  are 
several neg nutag in a bagh. The khot ail is a few (about five) herder families who stay together 
and have the same pasture or water sources. The saakhalt ail is the few khot ails or families that 
live nearby. 
Appendix 4 
113 
The  key  organizational  unit  is  the  Neg  nutag  Alliance  (or  PUG)  which  makes  the 
42. 
Rangeland Use Agreement (RUA) with the soum government. 
Once 80% of herders in a bagh have joined into PUGs/RUAs, they can establish a bagh-
43. 
level  Nutag  Pasture  Council.  Once  there  are  at  least  two  Nutag  Pasture  Councils,  the  Soum 
Pasture Society can be established. 
The  Soum  Pasture  Management  Working  Group  (SPMWG)  acts  to  bring  together  the 
44. 
Soum and Bagh Khural, the Soum Pasture Society, and the Soum Government. Until the Soum 
Pasture Society is formed, the SPMWG can operate with the other entities. 
45. 
The  Terms  of  Reference  and  by-laws,  and  other  functions  of  these  bodies  will  be 
developed in the capacity building component of the project in order to be standard across the 
project  area,  and  be  consistent  with  national  practices  already  in  place  in  other  areas  of  the 
country, in particular based on experiences of the SDC-supported projects. Structures above the 
level of aimag will be addressed in the capacity building component of the project. 
There are 73 pasture user groups in the project soums. However there appears to be a 
46. 
lack of formal structures and processes in many of them, and lack of RUAs. Given this, the first 
work of the soums is to establish PUGs in a formal sense consistent with national standards and 
agree on RUAs. The RUAs should include a both a long-term target for total livestock numbers, 
numbers of herder households and stocking rates and productivity to match the environment of 
the PUG grazing area, and the achievable annual, and end of project targets. 
There  are  four  Soum  Pasture  Associations  (SPA)  in  the  target  soum:  two  in  Bulgan 
47. 
(Mogod, Saikhan) and two in Bayankhongor (Jinst, Bogd). 
A key issue for the project will be to clearly define what is a PUG and what is an RUA, 
48. 
especially since there are many types of herder groups and cooperatives in the project area. In 
the project,  a  PUG  will be  defined as  group  of herders  who  have  entered  into  a  RUA  with the 
soum that includes: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
a grazing management plan for the PUG area and soum reserve areas 
annual  targets  over  a  15-year  period  for  matching  stocking  rates  to  the 
environment of the PUG grazing area, and a strategy for managing the transition 
from current stocking rates to the target. In keeping with the approach of the project 
across all activities, the RUA should include a with- and without-project analysis. 
As a guide, the RUA should have a target of 80% of initial LSU by the end of year 
four, with annual targets of 95%, 90%, 85% and 80%. The final LSU should be a 
minimum of 80% of the starting LSU. 
the RUA should include a description of the baseline of the PUG herders, including 
livestock  ownership  (species,  age  and  sex),  and  details  of  head  of  herder 
household (age, gender, education level), and transition plan, and target for each 
herder household.  
Proposal: The soum government in collaboration with bagh governor (as representative 
49. 
of herders) will develop the proposal. The proposal will describe the activities required to establish 
the PUGs/RUAS, the Nutag pasture council at the level of the bagh, the soum pasture council at 
the level of the soum, and the soum pasture management working group (SMPWG). The SMPWG 
will  consist  of  representatives  of  the  bagh  and  soum  khurals,  soum  government,  and  soum 
114 
Appendix 4 
pasture society. The proposal will specify the civil works, equipment and supplies and services 
required to support implementation. 
50. 
The sub-agreement proposal should include baselines and targets for key structures and 
arrangements.  These  indicators  will  form  the  core  of  reporting  and  feed  into  the  reporting  of 
against the targets in the aimag subprojects (Table A4.2).

Soum and bagh authorities will facilitate a series of meetings, workshops, and site 
visits with groups of herders that the bagh considers are likely, because of their 
traditional  grazing  areas,  to  be  interested  in  forming  into  PUGs,  and  then 
developing  RUAs. Initial  meetings  will  be  with  large  numbers  of  herders but  will 
then break up into smaller groups of herders who are likely to join into individual

Civil works: There are no civil works envisaged to be needed in the sub-agreement. 
55. 
Period:  The  sub-agreement  proposal  should  cover  the  whole  period  estimated  by  the 
Appendix 4 
115 
soum/baghs to be able to reach the targets for PUGs/RUAs as stated in the aimag subproject. 
Given the time to establish PUGs/RUAs, the period should be at least three years. 
Investment analysis: The sub-agreement is non-income generating and the output cannot 
56. 
be monetized so there is no need to do an investment analysis. However, an estimate of cost per 
PUG/RUA  should  be  calculated  as  simply  the  total  cost  of  the  sub-agreement  divided  by  the 
expected number of PUGs/RUAs. 
Approval process: The sub-agreement proposal should be submitted directly to the Grants 
57. 
Secretariat of PMU with a cover letter from the Soum Steering Committee. 
58. 
The  services  should  include  the  entering  into  national  databases  related  to  PUGs 
registration, ESD mapping, PUG area mapping, stocking rate estimates, and adjustments, and 
RUAs. 
Potential scope of the PUGs/RUAs: There will only be one PUG/RUA development sub-
59. 
agreement per soum. Assuming an average of 25 herders per PUG/RUA and that 80% of herders 
will join, then there is scope for 466 PUGs/RUAs in the 20 soums. These figures are shown in 
Table 3.  This  could  vary  during  implementation, with the  baseline  suggesting  up to  585  PUGs 
may be needed in the 20 project soums. The establishment of the PUGs and RUAs will be a major 
effort for the project. The existing pasture user groups could prove to be a basis on which to start.

PUG/RUA Implementation Sub-agreement 
Objective: Herders who have joined into PUGs/RUAs have improved productivity through 
61. 
improved grazing management, stocking rates, and herd structures.  
Justification:  Support  is  needed  to  implement  the  RUAs  and  the  implementation  sub-
62. 
agreement embodies some of the incentives that provide motivation for herders to form into PUGs 
and develop RUAs. 
Proposal:  The  sub-agreement  proposal  should  be  submitted  by  the  business  units 
63. 
involved in implementation: a grouping of a minimum of five PUGs/RUAs in a contiguous area, 
preferably within one bagh; the soum land manager; and the SAU. 
64.  While there is scope for 585 PUGs/ RUAs in the project soums, it would be impractical to 
have this many sub-agreements. Ideally, the sub-agreement proposals would be lumped at the 
level of the bagh Nutag Pasture Council. This would suggest that a single sub-agreement would 
consist of five PUGs. If PUGs from more than one Nutag Pasture Council could be lumped with 
another, this would be acceptable. Preferably, PUGs from different baghs would not be included 
into  the  same  sub-agreement  proposal.  The  proposal  should  be  co-signed  by  Nutag  Pasture 
Council,  the  Soum  Pasture  Council,  and  the  Soum  Pasture  Management  Working  Group 
(SMPWG), the soum land manager, and SAU. 
65. 
The  proposal  should  include  a  business  plan  for  each  of  the  individual  PUGs/RUAs.  It 
should  describe  the  civil  works,  equipment,  and  supplies  and  services  required  to  support 
implementation. If the PUGs/RUAs wish to put in place a system of grazing fee collection and 
use, this should be included in the business plan. The business plan will be based on the RUA. 
Targets: The sub-agreement proposal should include baselines and targets for key 
66. 
indicators. These indicators will form the core of reporting and feed into the reporting of against 
the targets in the aimag subprojects (Table 5).

Private Veterinary Unit (PVU) Sub-agreement 
Objective: The objective is to strengthen the organizational structures, relationships and 
75. 
agreements  that  can  lead  to  improved  animal  health  in  the  soum  and  strengthen  one  health 
linkages and processes. These are shown in Figure A4.5.

Structures: At the heart of these arrangements is the PVU which has a tripartite agreement 
76. 
with the soum and herder representatives to provide services. The PVU also has contracts with 
the government to deliver vaccines. 
Justification:  Animal health  services  are critical for  improving  productivity  and  detecting 
77. 
any  disease  that  could  be  harmful  for  animals  and  humans.  Project  investment  is  justified  to 
improve quality and quantity of services. Linkages between local-level.  
Proposal: The sub-agreement proposal pertains to a whole soum and should be submitted 
78. 
by the soum, co-signed by the SVU, the AVD, the existing PVUs and bagh governors representing 
herders. The proposal should have a supporting letter from the GAVS confirming that the proposal 
is consistent with provisions of the Animal Health Law and related guidelines. 
There are four business units involved in the provision of animal health services that can 
79. 
be included in a sub-agreement: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii)

treatment  services  from  the  PVUs.  Herders  keep  animal  health  records  in  a 
standardized booklet. 
The proposal should include business plans for the four business units for an eight-year 
80. 
period. The proposal should strengthen each business unit linkages between them. The proposal 
should show the with- and without- project analysis for each business unit. 
Targets:  The  sub-agreement  proposal  should  include  baselines  and  targets  for  key 
81. 
indicators (Table A4.6). These indicators will form the core of reporting and feed into the reporting 
of against the targets in the aimag subprojects.

IT.  
(ii) 
For SVU: Building for vaccine storage, including vaccine storage units. 
Period: The sub-agreement proposal should cover the whole period estimated to complete 
86. 
the activities. It is expected that the period should be at least three years. 
Investment analysis: The sub-agreement investment analysis should include all costs one 
87. 
side, and return measured in an estimate of increased productivity because of improved animal 
health. This calculation will be automatically generated based on models developed by the PMU. 
The analysis should also take into account the business plan of PVUs. 
Approval process: The sub-agreement proposal should be submitted to the Soum Steering 
88. 
Committee with a copy to the PMU. Once cleared by the SSC, the proposal should be sent to 
PMU with SSC in copy. 
Potential  scope  of  the  sub-agreements:  There  is  scope for  one  sub-agreement  in  each 
89. 
soum. It is assumed that all PVUs in each soum will enter into the sub-agreement proposal. It is 
critical that there is good coordination between the project and the World Bank-funded Livestock 
Competitiveness  Project  (LCP),  which  is  investing  heavily  in  animal  health  and  veterinary 
services. The LCP is working in three of the four aimags: it is not working in Bayankhongor aimag.  
b. 
Private Livestock Marketing Unit (PLMU) Sub-Agreement 
Objective: The objective of the sub-agreement is to establish the organizational structures, 
90. 
relationships, agreements, and processes that can lead to an improved sheep and goat marketing 
system.  
Structure: At the heart of the structure is a Private Livestock Marketing Unit (PLMU), which 
91. 
operates a livestock exchange facility owned by the soum and constructed with the support of the 
project. The PLMU has an agreement with the soum to operate the facility. In the project, the only 
eligible entities to submit a proposal to develop such a facility is a herder cooperative made up 
solely  of  members  who  have  entered  in  to  PUGs/RUAS,  or  a  PVU  registered  in the  soum,  or 
Private Feeds Unit registered in the soum (see sub-agreement on Feeds). 
Other  structures  relate  to  vertical  and  horizontal  linkages  at  soum,  aimag  and  national 
92. 
level  allowing  for  information  exchange  and  raising  and  solving  issues  on  technology, 
governance, policy and so on (Figure A4.6). 
122 
Appendix 4 
Figure A4.6: Structures and Relationships on Livestock and Meat Marketing  
Source: Asian Development Bank. 
Justification:  There  is  an  opportunity  to  reduce  livestock  trading  transaction  costs  and 
93. 
establish downstream  linkages to processors  if  there is  a central  location  for  livestock for  pre-
processing  before  transport  to  markets.  The  pre-processing  will  depend  on  processor 
specifications, but could include weighing, ear-tagging, health checks and health certification. This 
process will be useful for herders who have joined into PUGs/RUAs who will need to sell livestock 
to reach targets for livestock population and stocking rate reductions, as well as other herders in 
the soum. This is a potential business opportunity for a herder cooperative to market their own 
livestock through this channel, and potentially charge fees (on cash or livestock-barter basis) for 
other herders if it can be shown to be advantageous. If successful, a regulatory framework could 
be established to support livestock marketing through such a channel. This policy and regulatory 
work will be addressed in the capacity building part of the project.  
Proposal: The proposal should be submitted by five entities: the entity wishing to establish 
94. 
and manage the PLMU (e.g. herder cooperative or who have agreed PUGs /RUAs, and formed 
cooperatives), the  soum,  suppliers  (e.g.  herder  cooperatives  or  PUG/RUAs  herders),  livestock 
processors  who  will  process the  livestock  marketed  through  the  PLMU  for  at  least  one  selling 
season, and SVU. The proposal should include a business plan for the business units involved. 
The  period  of  the  business  plan  should  cover  at  least  five  years,  and  include  provision  for 
replacement of capital items. 
95. 
Targets: The targets for Marketing are shown in Table A4.7.

Activities: The activities include (for one cycle of livestock trade after the civil works) are: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
(v) 
(vi) 
(vii) 
Soum constructs a livestock trade facility at the soum with fencing, feed and water 
troughs for sheep, and yards with facilities for identification, weighing, and loading 
onto trucks. An office for storing equipment and supplies and meeting room and 
office  with  computer  and  IT  systems.  Herder  cooperatives  can  rent  the  facility 
according to an agreement with the soum. 
Herders enter into a cooperative agreement to market their livestock in a planned 
fashion,  to  meet  the  specifications  of  processors  in  terms  of  quality,  timing  and 
condition, and to agree on a price structure, and carcass quality feedback. 
Agreements  made  with  registered  processors  on  logistics  and  price  indicators 
through  facilitation  of  the  project,  in  form  of  tripartite  agreement  with  herders, 
PLMU and soum. 
SVU  provides  technical  support  to  compliance  with  processor  specifications  on 
livestock health inspection and certification and animal identification. 
Herders bring livestock to  exchange  facility,  the sheep  are  weighed,  ear-tagged 
and checked for health by SVU, health certificates. Livestock are fed for a short 
period,  if  necessary,  until  the  processor  brings  trucks  to  collect  the  livestock. 
Livestock  data  is  managed  by  the  PLMU  and  the  SVU  as  per  regulations.  The 
LPMU sends livestock data to the processor. 
The  transporter  checks  the  ear-tags  and  manages  the  data  according  to 
regulations and sends data to the processor as per agreements made. 
Processor reads the ear-tags, manages data according to regulations, slaughters 
livestock  and  grades  carcass  according  to  standard  procedures.  Sale  money  is 
paid  into  the  account  of  the  cooperative,  with  a  portion  to  SVU  and/or  soum 
account  and  PLMU  according  to  guidelines  and  agreements.  Cooperative  and 
soum meet to sign off on completion of the agreement.  
(viii)  Processor provides feedback on carcass weights and quality as specified in the 
agreement with herders, and according to standards. 
Herder cooperate meets to decide on income-sharing. 
Operation and maintenance of the facility according to the agreement of the soum. 
(ix) 
(x) 
97. 
The expected number of livestock trades per year, the timing and volume of sales should 
be  specified  in  the  proposal.  The  proposal  should  also  include  provision  for  maintenance  and 
repair of the facility. The facility will be used primarily for sheep and goat trading but can include 
facilities for cattle by mutual agreement.

Equipment and Supplies: The project will supply: 
(i) 
(ii) 
Ear-tags, ear tag applicators, weighing scales, according to the needs of suppliers 
and existing regulations 
Manuals  on  livestock  facility  maintenance  and  on  technical  issues  related  to

100.  Civil Works: The project will support construction of the livestock trade facility. The size of 
the facility will depend on soum estimation of the demand for the facility, which will be specified 
in the proposal. 
101.  Period: The period of the sub-agreement should be five years.  
Investment Analysis: The investment analysis will depend on the business plans of the 
102. 
herder cooperatives (suppliers), the soum, the PLMU managing the facility, and the SVU. 
103.  Approval process: The sub-agreement proposal should be submitted to the Soum Steering 
Committee with a copy to the PMU. Once cleared by the SSC, the proposal should be sent to 
PMU  with  SSC  in  copy.  The  sub-agreement  will  be  a  tripartite  agreement  between  the  herder 
cooperative, the soum and the processors. 
104.  Governance: A number of regulations are currently being developed for the meat value 
chain  from  production  through  to  transport,  slaughter  and  consumption.  The  sub-agreement 
details will naturally have to follow these regulations as they come into force. 
c. 
Private Feeds Unit, Herder Feeding and Private Feedlot Unit Sub-
agreement 
to  establish 
105.  Objective:  This  sub-agreement  aims 
the  organizational  structures, 
relationships,  agreements  and  processes  at  the  soum  and  aimag  levels  that  can  lead  to  a 
functioning  value  chain  with  five  main  components:  (i)  Private  Feeds  Unit  (PFU)  based  in  the 
soum that can supply feeds to meet the demands of herders in the soum; (ii) a sufficient demand 
for the feeds from herders and herder cooperatives; (iii) a Private Feedlot Unit (PFLU); and (iv) 
processors who will buy fattened lambs (v) the soum that rents facilities to the PFU. It is important 
to note that the Private Feedlot Unit (PFLU) can in practice be integrated into the Private Livestock 
Marketing Unit (PLMU). The two functions could be merged into one facility. This will need to be 
worked out during implementation and could vary from soum to soum.  
106.  Structures: The most important structure in the supplementary feeds supply chain is the 
Private Feeds Unit (PFU). The PFU has an agreement with the soum. The structures are shown 
in  Figure  A4.7.  The  sub-agreement  will  support  the  establish  and  function  of  structures  at  the 
soum and aimag level. These include a Soum Feeds Working Group, and Feeds Associations at 
aimag level. These bodies serve to act as information sharing bodies on technical, governance, 
and other issues as they arise.

107.  A second important structure is the Private Feedlot Unit (PFLU). The PFLU has a tripartite 
agreement  with  the  soum  and  herder  representatives  (e.g.  bagh  authorities).  The  agreement 
includes the user-rights for a feedlot facility owned by the soum and constructed through project 
support.  The  PFLU  can join the  structures  outlined in the  Livestock  Marketing Sub-Agreement 
description, as can the processors. 
108.  Other structures include those that promote horizontal and vertical information-sharing - a 
soum feeds working group, an aimag and national feeds association. A link to policy makers is 
through a national consultative committee on animal feeds. 
109.  Downstream processors of fattened lambs are also important structures. 
Justification: There is potential for demand for feeds for livestock for winter survival, late 
110. 
pregnancy feeding of ewes and does, and lamb fattening but there is generally lack of an enabling 
environment  for  investments  to  meet  this  demand.  The  demand  for  lamb  fattening  by  herders 
assumes  there  is  a  demand  for  fattened  lambs  by  processors.  The  work,  to  be  conducted  in 
parallel, aims to establish a PFU, to create the demand from herders; and to create the link to 
downstream processors of fattened lambs. 
111.  Proposal:  The  proposal  should  include  business  plans  for  all  the  business  units  in  the 
value chain a five-year period, or at least until the replacement of major capital items – for example 
a tractor and related equipment. The proposal should also show business plans for business units 
that will buy items or services from the PFU – the herders, herders cooperative, and male flock 
managers. If in any soum, the demand for fodder cannot be met by local production by herders 
or the PFU, then fodder suppliers outside the soum can be included as a business unit. If this 
business unit is at the aimag, then coordination with sub-agreements in four project soums will be 
needed. 
112.  Business Units: The business units in the proposal, as shown in Figure A4.8, can include: 
126 
Appendix 4 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
(v) 
PFU: Private feed producers or traders in the  soum. These may produce fodder 
(e.g., hay/silage), process fodder into feeds such as pellets, or procure other feeds 
such as bran, mineral and vitamin supplements for on-selling to herders. 
Herders:  Herders  acting  largely  as  individuals  who  procure  the  various  types  of 
feeds, and may have fodder-growing plots themselves. As individual herders they 
can  feed  their  livestock  over  winter  to  improve  survival,  or  specifically  to  late 
pregnant  ewes  and/or  does  to  improve  birthweights,  mothering  ability,  and  milk 
production. There are also some other minor options such as feeding horses, or 
cattle,  and  yaks.  Herders  who  have  fodder  plots,  and  fodder  storage  facilities 
(these could be the same as the herders who do feeding). Herders who have joined 
into a cooperative for fattening lambs (autumn). It is unlikely that individual herders 
will  engage  lamb  fattening  because  of  economies  of  scale  issues  with 
management and marketing. 
A Private Feedlot Unit (PFLU) that uses the soum-owned feedlot facility under a 
tripartite  agreement  with  the  soum.  The  linkage  between  the  PFLU  and  herder 
cooperatives who wish to fatten lambs will be an important one that has a number 
of potential business relationship options. 
The soum who owns the feedlot facility and has an agreement with the PFLU.  
Processors  who  would  buy  fattened  lambs.  Winter  feeding  or  feeding  pregnant 
ewes does not have a direct connection to the market. 
Figure A4.8: Fodder-Livestock- Market Value Chain 
Source: Asian Development Bank. 
113.  The feed supplier outside the soum is also a business unit engaged in the value chain. If 
there is a high level of interest in the soum for feeds, and the local supply falls far short of demand, 
these feed suppliers could be involved in the sub-agreement. 
114.  Activities: 
(i) 
SAU  and  SVU:  to  provide  technical  support  including  data  management  and 
performance recording; establish a lamb fattening facility for rental by the herder 
cooperative; establish a fodder storage facility for rental by the PFU. 
Appendix 4 
127 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
(v) 
The soum should also confirm its role on fodder supply; as to whether it will act as 
a competitor to the PFU at any point in fodder supply. 
PVU: To provide veterinary services to the herders. 
PFU: To establish fodder plot to produce fodder, process feeds (e.g. pellets, silage) 
or procure feeds to meet herder demand. 
Herders  cooperative  to  fatten  lambs.  Collect  lambs  from  members  to  fatten  at 
feedlot site in October under arrangements made with the PFLU; procure feeds; 
arrange market for fattened lambs; keep technical and financial data and provide 
feedback to the PFU. Market lambs in mid-November. 
(vi) 
Herder feeding: Individual herders to feed late pregnant ewes or does. Buy feeds 
and manage feeding; identify sheep and keep records for performance recording.  
(vii)  Male  flock  managers  to  feed  breeding  males  before  mating.  Buy  feeds  and 
manage feeding; identify sheep and keep records for performance recording. The 
purpose of this feeding is that males are in good condition before mating, with good 
quality, and quantity of semen production. 
(viii) 
(ix) 
Individual  herders  to  feed  livestock  over  winter;  buy  feeds,  goats,  and  sheep 
should be condition scored to assess those most at risk and given more feed.  
Individual  herders  produce  and  store  fodder.  Herders  identify  a  1  ha  area  to 
produce fodder; or identify an area for pasture hay, and receive support to grow 
fodder.  A  representative  spread  of  herders  over  quintiles  should  be  used  for 
feeding. 
(x) 
Processor  –  lamb  buyer:  Enter  into  agreement  with  lamb  fattening  cooperative; 
provide feedback on carcass after slaughter.  
115.  The system of fees paid to the PFLU by the lamb fattening cooperative and by the PFLU 
to the soum will be an important part of the business plans in the proposal. The system should 
allow for a lower fee scale for cooperatives of herders in PUGs/RUAs compared to other herders. 
This acts as part of the incentive system for herders to enter into PUGs/RUAs. 
116.  Services:  Consultants  provide  technical  support  to  sub-agreement  development  and 
implementation.  
117.  Equipment and supplies: These include: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
For PFU the project will support fodder plot fencing and water supply (e.g. deep 
well), a tractor, and related attachments, equipment for feed processing, and hay 
making, a water tank, and sprinklers for irrigation.  
For PLFU the project will support ear-tags and weighing scales.  
The project will supply record books for PLFU. 
118.  Civil Works: The project will support: 
(i) 
construction  of  a  lamb  feedlot  facility,  the  capacity  of  which  will  depend  on  the 
proposal, including well, feeders, water troughs, feed, and equipment storage and 
office, fence, and water supply for a fodder plot. The feedlot is a soum asset that 
can be rented by the PFLU.  
128 
Appendix 4 
(ii) 
For  PFU:  office  and  feeds  processing  and storage  building.  The  fodder  storage 
facility is a soum asset that can be rented by the PFU. The PFU office including a 
meeting room, and a building for feed processing will be an asset of the soum for 
rent by the PFU. A deep well for water supply.  
119.  Period: The sub-agreement proposal should cover at least five years. 
Investment  analysis:  The  sub-agreement  investment  analysis  should  include  business 
120. 
plans for all the business units in the sub-agreement. 
121.  Approval process: The sub-agreement proposal should be submitted to the Soum Steering 
Committee with a copy to the PMU. Once cleared by the SSC, the proposal should be sent to 
PMU  with  SSC  in  copy.  The  sub-agreement  is  a  tripartite  agreement  between  the  soum,  the 
project, and the business units who submitted the proposal. 
122.  Scope: About 800,000 lambs are born each year in the project soums, at an average of 
40,000 per soum. At current herd structures, it can be estimated that 100,000 of these lambs are 
sold each year, at an average of 5,000 per soum. If 50% of herders are interested in joining a 
lamb  fattening  cooperative,  then  2,500  lambs  could  be  fattened  per  year  on  average  from  the 
project soums. While the initial sub-agreement is to establish a 500-lamb feedlot, there is potential 
to expand if successful. Assuming lambs grow at 150 grams per day for 40 days, the weight gain 
is  6  kg,  which  require about  42  kg of  dry matter  feed  –  a combination  of  roughage,  grain and 
minerals - at a conversion ratio of 7:1. For 500 lambs, a total of 21 tons of feed would be required, 
as  well  as  good  supply  of  drinking  water.  The  planning  and  implementation  process  will  show 
what will be the limiting component of the value chain. 
123.  The potential market for late pregnancy supplementary feeding remains to be determined. 
The most likely market is for ewes in relatively poor condition. Of the 1.1 million ewes and 760,000 
does mated each year, 70-80% become pregnant. Assuming 20% of ewes are in poor condition, 
this makes a potential demand for about 200,000 ewes to supplementary feed, or 10,000 ewes 
per soum on average. Whether livestock herders in different herd-size quintiles are interested in 
feeding  is  yet  to  be  determined.  Whether  herders  will  simply  use  whatever  fodder  they  have 
access to from their own production, or whether they will be interested in buying feed, is also an 
open question. 
124.  Feeding ewes at 1% of bodyweight per day in dry matter for 40 days, will require about 18 
kg of feed per ewe, or 1.8 tons per 100 ewes; about 1.2 tons will be needed for 100 does. Herder 
interest in feeding ewes or does will depend on their attitudes and prices during implementation. 
Without an ultrasound pregnancy test, it is not possible to accurately differentiate pregnant and 
non-pregnant ewes and does as they enter the last six weeks of pregnancy, so there will be some 
losses because of feeding non-pregnant ewes. 
125.  The best response to feeding will be shown by ewes in poor condition, or maiden ewes 
which may be poor mothers if they are in poor condition; feeding these ewes has an element of 
survival  feeding  for  both  ewes  and  unborn  and  newly-born  lambs  as  well  as  a  production 
response.  Among  herders,  it  is  more  likely  that herders  with  above  average  size  flocks  will  be 
more interested in feeding than those with smaller flocks who are less interested in productivity 
gains, and who have less to spend on feed. 
126.  The  demand  for  winter  feeding  would  be  expected  to  be  very  high  in  dzud  years,  with 
Appendix 4 
129 
expected high prices for feed, and access problems. This will also need to be estimated during 
sub-agreement proposal development. 
d. 
Private Animal Breeding Unit (PABU) Sub-agreement 
127.  Soums  can  submit  one  sub-agreement  proposal  for  a  Private  Animal  Breeding  Unit 
(PABU), from which they can one of three options, namely 
(i) 
(ii) 
Sheep Nucleus Flock PABU 
Goat Nucleus Flock PABU 
(iii) 
Sheep Terminal Sire Flock PABU 
128.  Sheep  Nucleus  Flock  PABU:  Objective:  The  objective  of  the  sub-agreement  is  to 
establish  the  organizational  structure,  relationship,  agreement  and  process  at  the  soum  and 
aimag levels that can lead to sustainable sheep or goat breeding improvement in the soum. At 
the heart of these arrangements is the Private Animal Breeding Unit (PABU) and the agreement 
that the PABU has with the soum government. The relevant structure is shown in Figure A4.9. 
Structures above the level of aimag will be addressed in capacity building. 
Figure A4.9: Sheep and Goat Breed Improvement Structures and Relationships  
Source: Asian Development Bank. 
129.  Structure: The key organizational unit is the PABU which makes a tripartite Sheep/Goat 
Breeding Improvement Agreement with the soum and herder representative (e.g. bagh authority). 
By this agreement, the PABU gets access to public sector support. This unit manages a nucleus 
flock that produces improved breed males (rams or bucks) for use by herders, and for use by their 
own nucleus flock. The nucleus flock should be large enough (e.g. 1,000 ewes/does) to be able 
to supply a significant number of males. In practice, it is likely that such a flock will be made up of 
several  physically  separated  individual  flocks.  The  PABU  also  manages  a  male  flock  which 
130 
Appendix 4 
comprises young males before they are distributed to herders and some of the males from the 
herders during the non-mating season. The template for the Sheep/Goat Breeding Improvement 
Agreement  should  be  developed  by  the  Livestock  Genetic  Resources  Centre  to  ensure 
consistency with national standards and processes. 
130.  For  sheep  breeding  one  PABU  with  1,000  ewes  can  provide  improved  rams  for  about 
20,000 ewes There is an average of about 700 herders and 64,000 breeding ewes per soum in 
the  project  area.  Therefore,  there  is  scope for more  than  on  sheep  PABU  per  soum.  For  goat 
breeding one PABU with 1,000 does can provide improved rams for about 15,000 does assuming 
the nucleus flock will produce 300 ram lambs each year of which about 12 will be retained for the 
nucleus flock, 120 available for mating to herders and 168 culled. Under these assumptions, there 
is a potential scope for 55 goat PABUs in the project area. However, given the current level of 
experience it is considered prudent to start with establishing a single PABU for sheep or goats in 
each soum to get experience in understanding the market for rams. 
131.  The Soum Breed Improvement Working Group is a structure that brings together the bagh 
and soum khurals, the soum government and the PABUs in the soum (including those involved 
with  sheep  and  goats,  but  also  cattle  if  there  is  any  breed  improvement  activity).  This  is  an 
opportunity for information sharing on breed improvement. 
132.  Aimag and national PABU associations aim to strengthen the PABUs. The aimag can also 
have a Working Group structure. There are four project aimags, and under the project a “regional” 
or  four  aimag  structure  can  be  established.  At  the  national  level,  the  National  Consultative 
Committee  on  Animal  Genetic  Resources,  established  under  the  Animal  Genetics  Law,  is  the 
forum  for  exchange  between  the  Livestock  Genetic  Resources  Centre,  meat,  and  wool  sector 
companies, and PABU associations. This structure is important in discussing breeding objectives 
and overall structures of breeds and genetic improvement strategies. 
133.  The  Terms  of  Reference  and  by-laws,  and  other  functions  of  these  bodies  will  be 
developed in the capacity building component of the project in order to be standard across the 
country. 
Justification:  The  establishment  and  operation  of  sheep  and  goat  breed  improvement 
134. 
programs based on PABUs requires public sector support because the system requires a high 
degree of technical input, as well as significant start-up costs. Project support for such a system 
embodies  some  of  the  incentives  that  provide  motivation  for  herders  to  form  into  PUGs  and 
develop RUAs. 
135.  Proposal: The sub-agreement proposal should be submitted by the members of the PUGs 
who are interested in establishing the system, co-signed by relevant bagh authorities,, and the 
SAU,  and  SVU.  The  proposal  should  have  a  supporting  letter  from  the  Livestock  Genetic 
Resources Centre confirming that the proposal is consistent with provisions of the Genetics Law 
and related guidelines. The proposal describes the activities of the sub-agreement. The proposal 
should describe the civil works, equipment, and supplies and services required from the project 
to support implementation. 
136.  There are five business units in this value chain in the soum. These are: 
(i) 
Private Animal Breeding Unit (PABU), a cooperative of herders. 
Appendix 4 
131 
(ii) 
Herders who buy (or rent) the improved males. They mate the males to the females 
in the breeding season, then return the males to the PABU male flock for the non-
mating period.  
(iii)  Male flocks (not belonging to PABU) where some herders may put the males into 
other bagh-level male flocks if they prefer. 
(iv) 
SAU  and  SVU  provide  technical  and  operational  support  to  the  activities  of  the 
PABU,  especially  for  animal  identification  and  performance  recording,  and  non-
PABU male flocks.  
(v) 
PVU provides animal health services. 
137.  There are a range of business models that  can be used for the PABU. The PABU can 
manage the nucleus flock as a private business, with rams being sold or rented out on the open 
market. There can be alternative business models, such as herders who wish to plan ahead to 
buy or rent improved males can join a cooperative to “book” males in advance. Such herders are 
termed “base flock herders.” 
138. 
In  a  “closed  nucleus  flock”  model,  the  sub-agreement  proposal  should  name  from  1-5 
herders  who  between  them  should  have  1,000  breeding  ewes/does  to  register  in  the  nucleus 
flock, with a minimum of 150/does ewes from any individual herder. At a mating ratio of 40:1 this 
means there will be about 25 rams in the nucleus flock. Selection of the initial rams for the nucleus 
flock  is  an  important  activity.  The  proposal  should  nominate  one  herder  as  the  nucleus  flock 
coordinator, the other herders are termed nucleus flock managers. The coordinator and managers 
together make up the PABU. In technical terms, this is called a dispersed nucleus flock because 
several physically separate flocks make up the nucleus flock. The reason for this is that there are 
very  few,  if  any,  herders  that  have  1,000  breeding  ewes/does.  Decisions  on  the  number  of 
ewes/does and number of physical flocks in a nucleus flock can be made on a case-by-case basis 
depending on local conditions. 
139. 
It  is  important  that  the  performance  of  sheep/goats  in  the  nucleus  flock  is  able  to  be 
compared with individuals in other flocks. For example, introducing rams from other nucleus flock 
in similar environments may add a degree of hybrid vigor. As time goes on, a “three-tier” breed 
improvement system can be established by the selection of elite animals for establishment in an 
Elite Nucleus Flock. While steps can be made in this direction, it is unlikely such a flock will be 
established during the life of the project. 
140.  An “open nucleus flock” model is the same as the closed nucleus except that the nucleus 
flock  is  managed  in  a  cooperative  structure,  as  a  so-called  “Group  Breeding  Scheme.”  In  the 
scheme, cooperative member herders who have the ”base flock,” contribute their best performing 
ewes/does to create a nucleus flock, a proportion of second-grade culls from the nucleus flock 
can be returned to members, and members receive rams from  the nucleus flock at a discount 
rate.  To  reach  a  worthwhile  selection  pressure  on  females,  the  ratio  between  the  base  flock 
ewes/does and nucleus flock should be about 20:1. An open nucleus flock results in more rapid 
genetic gain than a closed flock, and there can be advantages in the social and technical linkages 
between the base flock and nucleus herders. There would be more pressure on the base flock to 
have good health since they contribute ewes/does. The disadvantages are the high transaction 
costs  and  time  in  developing  the  group  breeding  scheme,  and  health  risks  from  contributing 
livestock. 
141.  The proposal should include a business plan including with- and without-project analysis 
132 
Appendix 4 
over a ten-year period for the three business units. A key part of the analysis for the PABU will be 
the value added income of selling (or renting out) a portion of young entire males for breeding as 
opposed to castrating them and selling them for meat. This requires a market description of the 
quantity and price demand for improved rams. The business plan for herders should include a 
with- and without-project analysis of herder productivity and incomes who use or do not use the 
improved ram or have access to an improved male flock. 
142.  The essential component of a breed improvement program based on selection is accurate 
performance recording data to identify superior-performing males, and to lesser extent females. 
143. 
It is important that the various flocks that make up the nucleus flock are managed under 
as similar conditions as possible, especially in relation health, grazing and feeding, so that lambs 
from each flock can be fairly compared when they are ranked. This will be an important job for 
the coordinator and flock managers. Each flock manager should have a flock management record 
book to keep records of feeding and health, and flock dynamics (e.g., mortality and sickness). 
The coordinator will play an important role in harmonizing performance recording and decisions 
on ranking across the several separate physical flocks that make up the nucleus flock.

144.  There  would  not  be  expected  to  be  any  specific  changes  to  marketing  of  livestock 
processors as a result of the breed improvement program, so processors are not included as a 
business  unit.  However  meat  and  fiber,  and  to  a  lesser  extent  skin  processors  will  have  an 
important  role  in  the  National  Consultative  Committee  on  Animal  Genetic  Resources  as  they 
engage with the LGNRC on breeding objectives for sheep, most importantly the balance in the 
Appendix 4 
133 
breeding objectives between meat and wool, and engagement on objectives in relation to carcass 
and meat quality. 
145.  Targets:  The  sub-agreement  proposal  should  include  baselines  and  targets  for  key 
indicators (Table 8). These indicators will form the core of reporting and feed into the reporting of 
against the targets in the aimag subprojects.

146.  Activities: The activities of the PABU include: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
(v) 
Registration of the PABU by the Livestock Genetic Resource National Centre and 
Sheep Breeding Improvement Agreement with the Soum. 
Construction  of  an  office  building  and  equipping  with  computers  and IT system, 
printers, desks, chairs, meeting table and whiteboards.  
Identification. All livestock in the nucleus flock will have an electronic ear tag based 
on a national standard system for breed improvement. 
Performance  Recording.  The  managers  will  carry  out  animal  performance 
recording.  Animal  weight  is  the  main  piece  of  data  to  collect  on  lambs.  The 
managers  will  weigh  and  ear  tag  all  male and female lambs  at  birth,  record the 
birth date and weight and identify mothers, and record whether they are twins. It 
will usually not be possible to identify the individual ram parent because of mating 
in multiple ram flocks, but the ram parents in the flock can be recorded. The lambs 
will be weighed in summer and again in October. It can be assumed that with an 
80%  reproductive  rate  there  will  be  400  female  and  400  male  lambs/kids.  In 
summer,  only  those  males  identified  as  especially  inferior  –  maybe  10%  or  40 
lambs  will  be  castrated.  The  performance  data  will  be  entered  into  a  database 
consistent with national standards. It is assumed that meat is the major market for 
sheep, and that wool weight or quality is not included in the selection index.  
Male flock management. A separate male flock is needed to manage the young 
rams as they mature, as they need to be separated from the ewes to avoid them 
mating. The male flock is also needed to manage the improved rams during the 
non-mating season. If the improved rams are rented out, and not sold, then the 
PABU  should operate the male  flock  as  one  of the  flocks with the  PABU.  If  the 
PABU sells rams, then the herders who bought the rams can apply for a separate 
sub-agreement on Male Flock Management.  
(vi) 
First  stage  ranking  of  lambs.  The  male  and  female  lambs  will  be  weighed  in 
November.  Females  and  males  based  on  objective  data  from  the  weighing  as 
entered into the breeding index, and some visual assessment. Males are ranked 
134 
Appendix 4 
into  first,  second  or  third  categories.  Some  rams  or  ewes  may  be  culled  at  this 
stage.  
(vii) 
Young rams for mating and distribution. It may be possible for some of the older 
and larger rams to be used in the NF or distributed for mating after the ranking in 
November.  This  practice  allows  for  more rapid genetic improvement.  To reduce 
the risk of poor mating performance, testicles should be checked and mating ratios 
reduced.  
(viii)  Second-stage  ranking  of  lambs.  Lambs  will  be  weighed  again  the  following 
summer and October. Their wool will be weighed and assessed when shorn. They 
will be ranked and distributed accordingly to the nucleus flock or for distribution.  
(ix) 
(x) 
(xi) 
Rams for mating and distribution. After the second-stage raking, all males should 
be categorized for mating in the NF, distribution (sale or rent) or culling. 
Ewe management: Ewes should be assessed annually for condition of teeth, feet 
and  general  visual  assessment  for  decisions  on  culling.  If  wool  weight,  color  or 
quality is included in the selection index, then data needs to be collected on these 
characteristics. 
Doe  management:  For  does  cashmere  weight,  and  quality  are  the  key  data 
required to input into indexes for selection. Cashmere samples of all young goats 
need to be sent to a laboratory for testing. The first cashmere sample will be when 
the goats are about 15 months old, but bodyweight data can be collected at the 
same time as occurs with sheep. Special bags and identifiers will be needed for 
individual packaging of cashmere samples for visual assessment (color) and fiber 
testing for strength and micron. 
(xii)  Ram management. Ideally, rams should only be used in the nucleus flock for two 
years to make genetic improvement as rapid as possible. During the non-breeding 
season, rams are managed male flock along with rams being used in other flocks. 
It will be essential that rams are in good condition at mating and have good testicle 
and  semen  quality.  Male  Flock  Management  is  covered  under  a  separate  sub-
agreement. 
(xiii)  Veterinary  service  delivery  for  preventive  measures  such  as  vaccination  and 
parasite control and treatment. 
(xiv)  Supplementary  feeding  plan  and  implementation,  including  forage  production  if 
requested and feasible. 
(xv)  Marketing.  Marketing  of  the  young  males  for  sale  or  rent  will  be  an  important 
activity. Marketing includes the analysis of the potential market (price and quantity) 
for rams and explain to potential herder-customers the advantages of using rams 
from the nucleus flock. Marketing materials including pricing of rams can include 
leaflets, signboards at the nucleus flock camps. The coordinator and nucleus flock 
should try to get feedback from herders who use the rams. 
(xvi)  After sales service. Operating an “after sales” service with herders who have used 
the  improved  rams  is  an  important  activity  to  provide  feedback  to  the  PABU. 
Herders who buy the rams should be trained to condition score the rams at the 
start of mating and again at the end of mating, and again at the end of mating to 
indicate how hard they have worked. These herders should also collect data on 
lambing  and  survival  rates.  These  herders  are  an  ideal  group  with  which  to 
conduct.

147.  The activities of the SAU include: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
Registration of all non-PABU male flocks 
Identification of all males in the male flocks 
Ensuring that herders do not use home-bred males in their own flocks 
Inspection  of  male  flocks  two  months  before  mating  and  at  point  of  mating  to 
ensure they meet standards on condition for mating and advising on management 
(v) 
Ensuring standard quality contracts for male flock managers 
148.  Services.  Consultants  provide  technical  support  to  sub-agreement  development  and 
implementation.  The  services  of  a  number  of  specialized  entities  will  be  required  some  of  the 
activities. The sub-agreement proposal should include provision for 
(i) 
(ii) 
Market study of the potential market for PABU improved males; including baseline 
of  breeding  in  the  soum,  including  baseline  of  male  flocks,  and  knowledge 
practices of herders with respect to breed improvement and reproduction.  
Genetic  Services:  Development  of  breeding  objectives  and  indexes  based  on 
value of sheep/goats (meat and wool). Ongoing management of data generated 
from the performance recording and recommendations on ranking of males and 
females.  Development  of  visual  assessment  guidelines  and  manuals  for 
sheep/goat selection.  
(iii) 
Livestock Genetic Resource National Centre assessment of PABU standards 
149.  Equipment and supplies: The sub-agreement proposal should include: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
For  PABU:  ear-tags  for  individual  identification  of  all  sheep  in  the  NF  and 
applicators for each of the NFMs; animal weighing scales for adult animals, small 
digital  scales  for  lamb  weighing;  livestock  housing  improvements  to  improve 
overall  design  for  good  animal  health  and  survival,  and  to  facilitate  animal  ear-
tagging, technical guideline booklets; a signboard for each of the camps of each 
of the  NFs;  items  to  assist  in marketing,  including  information  leaflets  about the 
nucleus  flock  and  ram  availability  and  price;  and  results  of  ram  and  flock 
performance details for distribution within the soum, or beyond; computer and IT 
system for PABU office 
For SAU; recording books and pens 
For  male  flocks:  ear-tags,  tagging  applicators,  housing  improvements,  record 
books, technical manuals 
150.  The  PABU  marketing  material  should  include  technical  details  of  the  performance  of 
individual rams; and an estimate of the benefit that a herder will get if they purchase (or rent) an 
improved breed ram for a higher cost than the traditional system of using a home-bred ram that 
leads to a degree of in-breeding and lack of genetic progress. As a guide, the ram will produce 
100 lambs over three years assuming it is mated with 40 ewes per year at a reproductive rate of 
80%.  Of  the  100  lambs,  70  would  expect  to  have  been  sold,  with  the  other  30  being  retained 
females.  Each  lamb  sold  would  be  expected  to  be  1-2%  heavier  than  the  home-bred  lamb, 
equivalent to 0.3-0.6 kg per head. This would need to be monetized by expected value to establish 
pricing. In addition to this is the advantage of improved genes that will be spread into the breeding 
ewes  and  provide  long-term  benefits.  In  practice,  it  may  take  some  time  for  the  sale  price  of 
136 
Appendix 4 
improved rams to be established and a full economic analysis of a NF as opposed to a normal 
self-replacing flock can be conducted. 
151.  Civil Works: The project will support: 
(i) 
(ii) 
upgrade of the livestock housing for PABU flocks (NFs and MFs) to be suitable for 
good livestock management and for easy performance recording (ear-tagging and 
weighing). 
Construction  of  a  building  in  the  soum  adequate  for  PABUs  to  work  to  manage 
data,  hold  local  meetings,  connect  to meetings by internet  and  store  equipment 
and supplies such as ear-tags, applicators, stocks of record books and extension 
materials. The office should be sufficient to allow for expansion in the number of 
PABUs  or  be  adaptable  for  organizational  development  such  as  soum  PABU 
associations or soum association of Group Breeding Schemes. 
152.  Period: The sub-agreement proposal should be five years. 
Investment analysis: The sub-agreement investment analysis should include all costs one 
153. 
side, and return measured in an estimate of increased productivity because of improved animal 
health. This calculation will be automatically generated based on models developed by the PMU. 
The analysis should also consider the business plan of PVUs. 
154.  Approval process: The sub-agreement proposal should be submitted to the Soum Steering 
Committee with a copy to the Grants Secretariat of PMU. Once cleared by the SSC, the proposal 
should be sent to GS of PMU with SSC in copy. 
155.  Potential scope: One sheep PABU with 1,000 ewes can provide improved rams for about 
20,000 ewes. This assumes the nucleus flock will produce 400 ram lambs each year of which 
about 12 will be kept for the nucleus flock, 160 available for mating to herders and 228 culled. 
The 160 rams can be mated to 6,400 ewes (assuming mating ratio of 40:1) and be used for three 
years.  Under  these  assumptions,  there  is  scope  for  64  PABUs  in  the  20  project  soum,  and 
average of over 3 per soum, with a range of 1-5 PABUs per soum. Whether individual PABUs in 
the larger soum will expand to reach the market over the whole soum will depend on the local 
situation. In any case, the project will budget for one sheep PABU per soum. 
156.  Goats  Nucleus  Flock  PABU:  For  goats,  one  PABU  with  1,000  does  can  provide 
improved bucks for about 15,000 does. This assumes the NF will produce 300 buck kids each 
year of which about 12 will be kept for the NF, 120 available for mating to herders and 168 culled. 
The 120 bucks can be mated to 6,400 does (assuming mating ratio of 40:1) and be used for three 
years.  Under  these  assumptions,  there  is  scope  for  55  PABUs  in  the  20  project  soums,  and 
average of nearly 3 per soum, with a range of 2-4 PABUs per soum. Whether individual PABUs 
in the larger soums will expand to reach the market over the whole soum will depend on the local 
situation.  
It is important that the breeding objectives and index for objective assessment and ranking 
157. 
of young sheep and goats be fully informed by the demands of the market for meat and wool. The 
engagement with the private sector meat and wool industry, as described in the Animal Genetic 
Law will be critical in this regard, will be important in establishing breeding objectives and selection 
indices. This is described more fully in the capacity building component. 
158.  Sheep Terminal Sire Flock: Objective:  The  objective  of  the  sub-agreement  is  to 
Appendix 4 
137 
establish the organizational structures, relationships, agreements and processes at the soum and 
aimag levels that can lead to sustainable system of terminal sire sheep breeding (Figure A4.11). 
159.  Structures:  The  most  important  structure  in  the  terminal  sire  sheep  breeding  is  the 
Terminal Sire Flock (TSF), and the flocks that contribute ewes to the TSF. The TSF is a flock of 
local-breed ewes that  is  mated to  a  specialist meat  breed ram  to  produce lambs  of  high  meat 
content and high growth potential. The aim is to sell all lambs both female and male before the 
winter. The TSF is not a self-replacing flock. It is established through TSF-cooperative herders 
contributing  ewes  at  the  time  of  establishment,  and  then  annual  contributions  of  ewes  as 
replacements for ewes culled from the TSF. 
160.  The TSF-cooperative members can join the same breed improvement associations and 
working groups as do the sheep and goat PABUs. The TSF is a special kind of PABU. 
Figure A4.11: Structures and Relationships for Terminal Sire Flocks 
Source: Asian Dvelopment Bank. 
161.  The  TSF  should  have  a  minimum  of  300  ewes  as  the  sole  sheep  enterprise  (no  other 
sheep). The herder members are those who contribute the ewes – “TSF contributors” - and the 
herder who manages the flock – the “TSF Manager.” The arrangements for management of the 
TSF – cost- sharing, income-sharing, and so on, is up to the members. As this is a relatively new 
process,  experience  will  build  up  over  time,  and  guidelines  from  lessons  learned  can  be 
developed. 
162.  The TSF flock will provide first cross (“F1”) lambs with a 50/50 breed mix that are mostly 
intended for sale. However, it is an option to experiment with mating F1 males back to local ewes 
to get an F2, 75/25 mix to see if such lambs perform better that the F1 lambs. Management of the 
meat breed rams need to be carefully monitored as they are not as adapted to the local conditions 
as are local sheep. It is important also to avoid unwanted mating with local ewes. 
138 
Appendix 4 
Justification:  The  TSF  should  be  considered  at  the  experimental  stage  but  could  yield 
163. 
quality lambs that suit some markets. Therefore, government and project support are justified. 
164.  Proposal: Herders who have agreed on PUGs/RUAS are eligible to submit a proposal for 
a sub-agreement to establish a terminal sire flock program. Either a group of herders can form a 
cooperative or an individual herder can change from a self-replacing flock to a terminal sire flock. 
165.  The relevant business units related to the TSF are shown in Figure A4.12. These are:

(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
(v) 
The TSF flock, managed by the TSF manager, and the contributing herders 
The male flock where meat breed males are kept when no mating 
The processors with whom the TSF flock have developed a linkage to market the 
lambs 
The SAU and SVU who provide technical and operational support 
The PVU that provides animal health services.

166.  Activities: The main activities for the cooperative system are: 
Appendix 4 
139 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
(v) 
A group of herders will form a cooperative and supply a portion of their cull ewes, 
either older ewes, young ewes or a combination, to a “terminal sire flock (TSF)”.  
Terminal sire rams need to be introduced for a period 3-4 months before mating to 
allow acclimatization. The rams should have individual electronic ear-tags. Rams 
should be at a ratio of 1:40 ewes, meaning seven rams for 300 ewes. Rams can 
be  used  for  3-4  years,  so  1-2  replacements  per  year  should  be  planned.  The 
introduction of rams to existing male flocks needs be monitored carefully to watch 
for fighting, so they may need to be yarded separately at night. Rams should have 
supplementary feeding if required to reach target condition score at mating, and 
have all recommended veterinary procedures. Their testicles, teeth and feet should 
be checked both two months before and immediately before mating. 
Ewes are mated to the rams at the normal mating time for a six-week period. The 
lamb progeny should have higher growth rates because of the high level of hybrid 
vigor because of being crossbreeds, and high meat quality because of the genetic 
qualities  of  the  ram.  However,  if  the  ewes  are  culled  from  other  flocks,  their 
lactation may be  less  because  of  lower  lactation potential,  which may  decrease 
lamb growth potential.  
Ewes  should  be  supplementary  fed  during  late  pregnancy  (last  6-8  weeks)  to 
increase  mammary  gland  development,  which  will  improve  mothering  ability, 
lactation and lead to better lamb growth. 
All lambs will be ear-tagged electronically at birth, and have date, sex, mother, twin 
or single recorded. 
(vi) 
Rams are managed in a male flock during the non-mating period. 
(vii)  Male lambs should be castrated using cauterize-cut method. 
(viii)  All lambs will be sold for meat before winter. These lambs will be good candidates 
for  fattening  with  supplementary  feed.  Data  on  bodyweights,  eye  muscle  score, 
and feeding regime should be collected.  
(ix) 
(x) 
(xi) 
(xii) 
Any ewes that do not produce a lamb will be culled, as well as a portion of the older 
ewes who had lambs.  
Before  the  next  mating  time,  the  culled  ewes  will  be  replaced  by  further 
contributions  from  the  herder  group  members  each  year.  During  non-mating 
periods, the rams will be managed in a Male Flock as is done with other rams in 
the soums and bags. Since the rams are not well adapted locally, they may need 
special attention especially during the winter. 
Housing  improvements  will  be  constructed  at  the  animal  camps  to  facilitate 
management of the identification and performance recording. 
Lambs marketed by contract and feedback from the processor on carcass quality 
and consumer interest. 
(xiii)  The  SAU  and  SVU  provide  technical  support  for  animal  identification  and 
performance recording including data management. 
(xiv)  The PVU provides animal health services. 
167.  The  performance  recording  system  should  be  consistent  with  national  guidelines  as 
140 
Appendix 4 
recommended by the Livestock Genetic Resource National Centre. Data should be included in 
national  systems  so  that  the  effectiveness  of  the  TSF  system  can  be  compared  in  different 
environments and management systems. The TSF will have access to the PABU building in the 
soum. 
168.  The  improved  meat  breed  ram  will  be  supplied  by  the  TSF  manager  or  the  Livestock 
Genetic Resource National Centre. Over time, the data collected on lamb growth will be used to 
modify the TSF program. For example, while a 50/50 mix of local and meat breed ram will be the 
first attempt at establishing a TSF system, it may be modified in time to a 75/25 local/meat breed 
mix. In such a case, some of the male lambs from the first cross 50/50 mix may be left entire (not 
castrated)  so  they  can  be  used  to  create  a  75/25  mix.  This  process  will  need  to  be  closely 
monitored locally and by the Livestock Genetic Resource National Centre. 
169.  Services: The project sub-agreement can include: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
Market  study  of  the  potential  market  for  TSF  lambs,  including  discussions  with 
meat  processors  and  skin  buyers;  and  visits  to  other  areas  of  Mongolia  with 
specialist meat breed rams;  
Performance Review: Review of flock performance and lamb growth and carcass 
data to make recommendations on future structure of TSF breeding programs; 
Livestock Genetic Resource National Centre data management and assessment 
of TSF standards; 
PABU local assistant (labor) to assist with NF management, as sub-contract with 
Consulting Firm; 
(v) 
PVU under contract to Consulting Firm to provide services 
170.  Equipment and supplies: The sub-agreement proposal should include 
(i) 
For TSF: electronic ear-tags for individual identification of all lambs in the TSF and 
applicators and readers; weighing scales for grown lambs, and small digital scales 
for lamb birthweight weighing; livestock housing improvements to improve overall 
design for good animal health and survival, and to facilitate animal ear-tagging and 
weighing; tablets for data entry; recording books and pens, and technical guideline 
booklets; a signboard for each of the camps of the TSF; TSF promotion including 
information leaflets about the TSF flock and terminal sire ram availability and price; 
and results of lamb and flock performance details for distribution within the soum, 
or beyond.  
(ii) 
Improved meat breed rams at a rate 1:40 ewes, or eight per 300-ewe TSF, with 
annual replacements of 3 head. 
171.  Civil  Works:  The  project  will  support  upgrade  of  the  livestock  housing  at  TSFs  to  be 
suitable  for  good  livestock  management  and  for  easy  performance  recording  (ear-tagging  and 
weighing). 
e. 
Private Cashmere Processing Unit Sub-agreement 
172.  Objective: The objective of the sub-agreement is to establish the organizational structures, 
relationships,  agreements  and  processes  that  can  lead  to  a  cashmere  processing  and  value-
adding in the soum (Figure A4.13). 
Appendix 4 
141 
173.  Structures: At the heart of the structures is a Private Cashmere Processing Unit (PCPU), 
which operates a cashmere sorting facility owned by the soum and constructed with the support 
of the project. The PCPU has an agreement with the soum to operate the facility. The PCPU has 
a tripartite agreement with the soum and herder representatives. 
174.  Herder cooperatives for cashmere marketing are also important structures. 
175.  Other  structures  relate  to  vertical  and  horizontal  linkages  at  soum,  aimag  and  national 
level  allowing  for  information  exchange  and  raising  and  solving  issues  on  technology, 
governance, policy and so on. 
Justification: There are a number of examples in the country of cashmere sorting at soum 
176. 
level,  which  adds  value  and  provides  employment,  and  such  opportunities  exist  in  the  project 
soums. 
Figure A4.13: Structures and Relationships on Cashmere Marketing 
Source: Asian Development Bank 
177.  Proposal: The proposal should be submitted by herders who have agreed PUGs /RUAs, 
livestock  processors,  and  SVU.  The  proposal  should  include  a  business  plan  for  the  three 
business units involved: the herder cooperative, the SVU and the processors. The period of the 
business plan should cover at least five years, and include provision for replacement of capital 
items.

and individual business plans. 
185.  Approval process: The sub-agreement proposal should be submitted to the Soum Steering 
Committee with a copy to the Grants Secretariat of PMU. Once cleared by the SSC, the proposal 
should be sent to GS of PMU with SSC in copy. The sub-agreement will be a tripartite agreement 
between the herder cooperative, the PCPU, the soum and the processors. 
186.  Scope: There is scope for one or more PCPU per soum, but the project will start with one 
per soum.

• The draft COVID-19 management plan in Appendix C of IEE will be reviewed by 
MOFALI  and  the  Ministry  of  Health  and  COVID-19  epidemiologists  and  then 
finalized with their input 
• Prior to the arrival of all external project personnel (e.g., workers and consultants), 
the  PMU  with  support  from  MOFALI  will  implement  government-approved  safety 
procedures and screening to ensure that all staff are tested negative for COVID-19 
and  do  not  pose  a  threat  to  local  human  populations.  This  will  include:  (i) 
requirement that all project personnel is tested negative for COVID-19, (ii) external 
workers  and  consultants  confirm  their  COVID-19  –  free  status  to  PMU  prior  to 
arrival,  and  (iii)  project  safety  and  sanitation  measures  are  distributed  to  all 
personnel and are included as contractual requirements for all staff 
• Reconfirm with MET; (i) that a DEIA is not required for the project investments in 
the  four  project  aimags;  and  (ii)  that  the  environmental  protection  conditions 
specified by the General EIA (GEIA) Letters issued by the MET still stand as is  
• Confirm  with  MET  whether  an  additional  Environmental  Baseline  Assessment 
(EBA) is required for the finalized project investments 
• No  civil  works  for  any  investment  will  proceed  until  all  domestic  environmental 
approvals are completed which are submitted to ADB 
• Prepare additional EBA(s) if required by the MET 
• Ensure GEIA Letters are issued for the EBAs 
• Submit General EIA Letters to ESS 
The specific location  of the project facilities will be finalized as part of  the  detailed 
engineering designs. Sites will be selected to fully comply with the following criteria: 
• All  activities  will  be  strictly  limited  to  modified  lands  already  used  for  livestock 
grazing (for livestock grazing, fodder plots, and wells) and rural use (for the office 
buildings,  livestock holding facilities, and cashmere sorting facilities). The  project 
will not involve any land conversion or the establishment of new pasture lands. 
• No project activities, including new wells, will be located in any protected areas  – 
whether  national-  or  local-level,  or  other  sites  of  designated  environmental  or 
cultural significance, including documented Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas, 
Ramsar wetlands, and UNESCO Biosphere Reserves, even if these sites are not 
officially designated by government. 
• No clearance or damage of natural habitats. 
• New  wells  will  be  located  in  areas  where  the  groundwater  supply  has  been 
demonstrated by the follow-up aquifer assessments (to be conducted during project 
implementation) to be sustainable. No sites for wells and/or aquifers will be used in 
which the hydrological surveys indicate a risk of unsustainability, especially when

•  The project does not involve the use of chemical pesticides, fertilizers, or poisons. 
•  A  registry  of  all  activities  that  involve  the  handling  of  potentially  hazardous 
substances will be developed, including protocols for the storage, handling and spill 
response. 
•  Chemicals, vaccines etc. used by the PVUs will only be managed by staff trained 
and certificate in chemicals handling. 
•  Each soum that will receive a new or upgraded PVU will be supported by the project 
with include clear procedures for the handling, storage, and disposal of chemicals. 
Chemicals will be stored in cool, dry, and locked rooms and will be appropriately 
labeled.  
•  Waste chemicals will not be discharged into drains but will be collected in closed 
containers and stored in the locked chemicals room.  
•  Full  containers  will  be  periodically  collected  by  a  certified  agency  for  hazardous 
waste collection, which will also treat and dispose the liquid waste in accordance

• The water extraction volumes and water table depths for each well will be reviewed 
once per year by the ABWA. Also reviewed will be the incidence of reported 
groundwater shortages by local users. In the event that groundwater yield appears 
to be decreasing, the soum government with AWBA will immediately discuss this 
with the aimag government, and MOFALI and will inform ADB. Corrective time-
based actions will be developed to ensure groundwater supply is sustainable for all 
users. 
• Follow assessment results in pre-construction phase as they relate to deep well 
groundwater sustainability.  
• All project wells will only be used for the provision of water for livestock. The wells 
will not be used for irrigation or other purposes 
•  At implementation stage the final scale and locations of the livestock facilities in 
soum  centers  will  be  completed.  The  designs  will  specify  required  waste 
management technologies (e.g., bio-digestion) and methods that will be used to 
manage  solid  waste  and  wastewater  that  will  be  generated  at  the  livestock 
facilities.  
•  Follow  results  of  waste  management  assessments  conducted  during  pre-
construction phase. 
•  Management  of  livestock  waste  will  follow  the  EHS  Guidelines  for  Mammalian 
Livestock  Production  (2007),  as  well  as  the  general  EHS  Guideline  on  Waste 
management (2007).  
•  During the operation of the livestock facilities, the owner/operators of the facilities 
must  commission  a  qualified  environmental  firm  to  sample  groundwater  and 
surface  water  quality  in  the  area  of  the  livestock  facilities  quarterly  for  coliform 
bacteria,  nutrient  levels  (e.g.,  PO4,  NH3,  NOx)  and  BOD  to  determine  potential 
surface and sub-surface contamination from the livestock. 
•  The Aimag Environment Dept. will oversee the monitoring 
•  Operation of the finalized livestock facilities will generate noise from the operations 
with livestock. 
•  Along with appropriate siting away from residential areas, the livestock facilities will 
maintain solid fencing around the property to contain noise. 
•  Quarterly  noise  measurements  will  be  taken  by  the  operators  of  the  facilities  to 
document noise along with input from local residents. 
•  The EHS Guidelines for Noise (2007) will be applied to set allowable limits for noise

Appendix 5 
167 
(i)  Stage 1 (maximum 7 days): If a concern arises during construction, the affected person(s) 
may  raise  the  issue  with  the  contractor,  soum  coordinator,  directly  at  the  PIU  -  Aimag 
project office, Project Implementation Consultant (PIC), or community representatives. All 
agencies  will  be  aware  of  the  GRM  and  will  be  requested  to  immediately  report  any 
incidents to the Aimag PIU GRM staff. If the issue is resolved directly between the affected 
person(s) and contractor, no follow-up is required. But the log/record shall be saved in the 
GRM logbook at the PIU office in the Aimag center and soum center. 
(ii)  Stage  2  (maximum  15  days):  If  the  issue  is  not  resolved  at  Aimag  field  office,  the 
affected person(s) can submit an oral or written complaint to the PMU/IA in Ulaanbaatar 
One Stop Shop where representatives of MOFALI can intervene. The IA One Stop Shop 
and MOFALI will reply within two weeks and keep a written record of the whole process.  
(iii)  Stage 3 (maximum 15 days): If the issue is still not resolved, the IA will, if agreed by the 
affected  person(s),  arrange  a  meeting  with  MOFALI,  and  relevant  community 
representatives to identify a solution. If the issue still cannot be resolved it will be referred 
to the relevant higher-level authorities. The MOFALI with support from PMU/IA may report 
the process to ADB at any of Stages 1–3 but will do so immediately if Stage 3 is reached.

even if these sites are not officially designated by government. 
No clearance or damage of natural habitats. 
New wells will be located in areas where the groundwater supply has been 
demonstrated  by  the  follow-up  aquifer  assessments  (to  be  conducted 
during project implementation) to be sustainable. No sites for wells and/or 
aquifers  will  be  used  in  which  the  hydrological  surveys  indicate  a  risk  of 
unsustainability,  especially  when  cumulative  use  (existing  demand)  and 
projected  declines  in  aquifer  recharge  due  to  climate  change  are 
considered. 
Siting of the office buildings, livestock holding facilities, cashmere sorting 
facilities,  and  new  wells  will  not  be  located  upslope  of  physical  cultural 
resources  and  sacred  sites,  including  the  documented  sites  listed  in 
Section IV.H of this IEE, to minimize direct or indirect disturbance and to 
avoid potential cultural disrespect. Exceptions to this criterion will only be 
accepted if based on clear documentation of public consultations agreeing 
to such exception, accompanied by government endorsement.

workers and other parties. 
•   Prevent sick workers from entering the site through checking 
temperatures of workers and other people entering the site. 
Require self-reporting prior to entering the site. 
•  All workers to self-monitor their health, possibly with the use 
of questionnaires, and take their body temperature regularly. 
•  Thermal screening at the workplace to be considered only in 
the context of a combination of measures for prevention and 
control  of  COVID-19  at  the  workplace  and  along  with  risk 
communication 
•  Keep  a  distance  of  at  least  1  meter  between  workers  and 
minimize physical contact, ensure strict control over external 
access,  and  queue  management  (marking  on  the  floor, 
barriers). 
•  Reduce  density  of  people  in  the  building  (no  more  than  1 
person  per  every  10  square  meters),  physical  spacing  at 
least  1 meter apart for work stations  and common spaces, 
such  as  entrances/exits,  lifts,  pantries/canteens,  stairs, 
where  congregation  or  queuing  of  employees  or 
visitors/clients might occur. 
•  Avoid  crowding  by  staggering  working  hours  to  reduce  the 
congregation  of  employees  at  common  spaces  such  as 
entrances or exits. 
•  Implement  or  enhance  shift  or  split-team  arrangements,  or 
teleworking. 
•  Minimize the movement of local workers in and out of the site 
(e.g.,  avoid  workers  returning  home  to  affected  areas,  or 
returning to site form affected areas). 
•  Minimize the workers’ contact with local community. 
•  All workers will wear a face mask.  
•  If a worker is sick, they will not come to work if a member of 
staff or a worker feels unwell while at work, provide a medical 
mask so that they may get home safely. 
•  Where  masks  are  used,  whether  in  line  with  government 
policy  or  by  personal  choice,  it  is  very  important  to  ensure 
safe and proper use, care, and disposal 
•  Regular and thorough handwashing with soap and water or 
hand hygiene with alcohol-based hand rub (a) before starting 
work,  before  eating,  frequently  during  the  work  shift, 
especially  after  contact  with  co-workers  or  customers,  (b) 
after  going  to  the  bathroom,  after  contact  with  secretions, 
excretions,  and  body  fluids,  after  contact  with  potentially 
contaminated objects (gloves, clothing, masks, used tissues, 
waste),  and  immediately  after  removing  gloves  and  other 
protective  equipment  but  before  touching  eyes,  nose,  or

of dirty surfaces and objects only after cleaning. 
•  Most common disinfectants – sodium hypochlorite (bleach) 
of  surface  at  concentration  0.1%  or  alcohol  at  least  70% 
concentration for surfaces which can be damaged by sodium 
hypochlorite. 
•  Priority disinfection of high-touch surfaces - commonly used 
areas,  door,  and  window  handles,  light  switches,  kitchen, 
and food preparation areas, bathroom surfaces, toilets, and 
taps,  touchscreen  personal  devices,  personal  computer 
keyboards, and work surfaces. 
•  Disinfectant  solutions  must  always  be  prepared  and  used 
according  to  the  manufacturer’s  instructions,  including 
instructions  to  protect  the  safety  and  health  of  disinfection

Appendix 8 
COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION IN PROCUREMENT 
1. 
This Appendix needs to be read in conjunction with the PAM that outlines the general scope 
and  objectives  of  the  project  and  its  components.  This  Appendix  specifically  outlines  the 
processes for procurement of works under Community Participation in Procurement method.  
A. 
Planning Community Participation in Procurement (CPP) 
Procurement planning means the process by which the efforts of all personnel responsible 
2. 
for  procurement  are  coordinated  and  integrated  through  a comprehensive plan for fulfilling  the 
need in a timely manner and at a reasonable cost.  
Since,  the  actual  demands  will  be  defined  by  the  subprojects  approved  by  the  Soum 
3. 
Steering  Committee  (SSC)  and  subject  to  change  in  each  year  based  on  the  demands  at  the 
soum level. Thus, the demands at the soum level should be determined and subprojects should 
be submitted to the PMU no later than 15 December of each fiscal year in order for the PMU to 
develop procurement plan and have it approved by the PSC and ADB. 
Once cleared by the SSC, the PIU will compile all proposals and send to the PMU with the 
4. 
SSC in copy along with the budget proposal prior to the date indicated in para. 3.  
Procurement  planning  consist  of  the  following  milestones  and  should  allow  appropriate 
5. 
time to implement the below:  
i)  Preparation and approval of sub-agreements by the Soum Steering Committee; 
ii)  PIU’s submission of the sub-agreements proposals to the PMU to include the package 
B. 
6. 
into project procurement plan;  
iii)  Approval of procurement plan by the Project Steering Committee and ADB; 
iv)  Preparation of CPP Invitation to Quotation; 
v)  Advertise and solicit CPP Invitation to Quotation; 
vi)  Opening and evaluation of quotations; 
vii) Award of Contract; 
viii) Contract signing; 
ix)  Contract implementation. 
Subproject Criteria for CPP 
Subproject criteria for CPP may be below but not limited to:  
i)  The proposed subproject should benefit the target beneficiaries. 
ii)  The  community  should  demonstrate  adequate  capacity  to  execute  or  supervise  the 
project.  If  not,  acceptable  arrangements  should  exist  to  appoint  a  capable  qualified 
service provider. 
iii)  Construction methods should be labor intensive.  
iv)  The community should indicate its willingness to participate with counterpart funds or 
in kind, such as labor and should confirm such to ensure suitability of the facilities by 
organizing recurrent operation and maintenance (O&M) works, if required. 
v)  The scope of work should be simple so that implementation by the community is the 
most practical solution.  
vi)  The  community  should  not  have  been  declared  ineligible  by  the  government  due  to 
unsatisfactory performance or otherwise in earlier executed projects.  
vii) The  community  group  leader  should  be  authorized  legally  to  sign  a  contract  for 
procurement purposes and should follow approved procurement procedures.

C. 
Organizing CPP Procurement  
7. 
For  subproject  financing,  after  the  PCS  approval  on  the  Procurement  plan,  the  EA  will 
establish a Bid Evaluation Committee (BEC), consisting of not less than two (2) representatives 
from NGO members, of which one member must be project procurement specialist. The BEC is 
expected to (i) advertise Request for CPP Quotations through www.tender.gov.mn and meantime 
solicit Request for CPP Quotations from four to five prospective qualified Community Groups (CG) 
in order to minimize the risk of obtaining only one or two quotations, (ii) evaluate all quotations 
and recommend contract award.  
The award decision should be made to the lowest evaluated CG. The responsible person 
8. 
of the EA signs the contract with the recommended CG.  
D. 
Procurement Procedures and Ceiling 
All  procurement  for  goods  and  works  under  CPP  will  follow  National  Community 
9. 
Participation in Procurement Guidelines and Sample Quotation Documents developed by Ministry 
of  Finance.  In  community  participation  in  procurement,  the  bidder  shall  be  a  group  of  citizens 
(community  group)  established  on  the  basis  of  a  cooperation  agreement  that  meets  the 
requirements of the Civil Law. 
10.  Works  under  CPP  are  labor  intensive  and  do  not  require  professional  contractors, 
estimated  to  cost  less  than  $30,000  equivalent  per  assignment  up  to  an  aggregate  amount  of 
$4.910 million, would be carried out using Community Participation in Procurement method. 
11.  Under  this  arrangement,  the  communities  would  purchase  materials  from  local  markets 
and  mobilize  the  labor  required  to  undertake  the  works.  CG  should  purchase  the  construction 
materials such as cement, wood, stone aggregate, and sand in bulk through shopping procedures 
by  inviting  at  least  three  quotations,  preferably  from  local  suppliers.  Labor  component  of  the 
subprojects  can  be  extended  by  the  members  of  the  community,  provided  adequate  expertise 
exists, who should be reimbursed adequately for the services rendered. It should be ensured that 
children  are  not  employed  for  the  subprojects.  To  the  extent  possible,  members  of  the  local 
community should be employed by the contractors as labor.  
E. 
Subproject Management  
The  PMU/PIU,  or  both,  will  have  to  assume  certain  responsibilities  of  overseeing  the 
12. 
subprojects implemented through community participation, such as the following:  
i)  Oversee the award of contract and signing of the contract agreement, if necessary, in 
certain situations, also countersigning the contracts,  
ii)  Allocate funds for each subproject,  
iii)  Monitor progress and quality of works regularly,  
iv)  Release funds to CG leaders as per schedule or stage-wise completion,  
v)  Certify subproject completion,  
vi)  Provide  regular  progress  reports  on  subproject  implementation  status  and  fund 
utilization to the EA and ADB,  
vii) Prepare statements of expenditures, maintain proper accounts, and conduct selective 
audits, and  
viii) Provide advice to CGs concerned regarding ADB’s policies and guidelines, especially 
on procurement, indigenous people, involuntary resettlement, and gender.

F. 
Subproject Implementation 
13.  A realistic implementation plan should be prepared and approved by all concerned parties. 
Soum Monitoring Focal Point and PIU coordinator will directly monitor the contract implementation 
with support of PIU M&E Specialist and report the progress to the PMU and the EA. The soum 
coordinator should submit a 6-monthly and annual report of all sub-agreements/subprojects being 
implemented in the soum, according to templates developed by the PMU. 
The CG leader will submit monthly progress status to the PIU and the PMU. The PMU will 
14. 
handle the project finances and pay the contractors directly. The CG leader should also apprise 
the community on the status of project implementation either by way of general meetings, posting 
on notice boards, or both.  
15.  On  completion  of  the  project,  the  CG  leader  shall  prepare  a  comprehensive  completion 
report which will be submitted to the PIU for review and approval. Following the completion of 
works,  the  technical  group  established  at  soum  level  will  conduct  final  inspection  and  certify 
completion to an acceptable standard. If the inspection technical group concludes that a project 
has  been  implemented  satisfactorily,  a  completion  certificate  will  be  issued  by  the  PMU, 
countersigned by the CG Leader, PIU, and EA representative. In case of defects, the CG shall be 
provided in writing the list of defects that have to be made good. A time limit for correction of the 
defects should also be indicated.  
16.  On final acceptance, final payments should be released with the approval of the PIU/PMU 
or EA to the CG.  
G. 
Fund Flow  
17. 
Fund flow mechanisms should follow PAM Section IV., I. Fund flow diagram. Supporting 
documents  for  payments  and  due  diligence  checks  should  be  same  as  other  contracts  under 
different procurement methods.  
18.  Members of the communities who provide labor are eligible for payments.  
19. 
The EA’s internal audit department or an externally appointed auditor will conduct selective 
audits  of  the  subprojects  under  the  loan  which  has  community  participation.  This  audit  report 
should  form  a  part  of  the  overall  audit  of  the  Project  and  should  be  submitted  to  ADB  in 
accordance with loan covenants.
