Project Administration Manual Purpose and Process 
1.  The  project  administration  manual  (PAM)  describes  the  essential  administrative  and 
management requirements to implement the project on time, within budget, and in accordance 
with the policies and procedures of the government and Asian Development Bank (ADB). The 
PAM  should  include  references  to  all  available  templates  and  instructions  either  through 
linkages to relevant URLs or directly incorporated in the PAM. 
2.  The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF), in coordination with the Ministry of 
Water  Resources  and  Meteorology  (MOWRAM),  and  the  Ministry  of  Rural  Development 
(MRD), and their provincial departments are wholly responsible for the implementation of ADB-
financed projects, as agreed jointly between the borrower and ADB, and in accordance with 
the  policies  and  procedures  of  the  government  and  ADB.  ADB  staff  is  responsible  for 
supporting  implementation,  including  compliance  by  MAFF,  MOWRAM  and  MRD  of  their 
obligations and responsibilities for project implementation, in accordance with ADB’s policies 
and procedures. 
3.  At loan negotiations, the borrower and ADB shall agree to the PAM and ensure consistency 
with the financing agreements. Such agreements shall be reflected in the minutes of the loan 
and grant negotiations. In the event of any discrepancy or contradiction between the PAM and 
the financing agreements, the provisions of the financing agreement shall prevail. 
4.  After ADB Board approval of the project's report and recommendations of the President (RRP), 
changes in implementation arrangements are subject to agreement and approval pursuant to 
relevant government and ADB administrative procedures (including the Project Administration 
Instructions) and upon such approval, they will be subsequently incorporated in the PAM. 
I. 
PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
The  Climate-Friendly  Agribusiness  Value  Chains  Sector  Project1  will  support  the

implementation of the government’s Agriculture Sector Strategic Development Plan, 2014−20182 
and the Industrial Development Policy, 2015−20253 aimed at improving the competitiveness of 
agricultural  value  chains  in  Kampong  Cham  and  Tboung  Khmum  provinces  along  the  Greater 
Mekong Sub-region (GMS) southern economic corridor, and Kampot and Takeo provinces along 
the  south-coastal  economic  corridor.  The  project  will  boost  the  climate  resilience  of  critical 
agricultural infrastructure and help commercialize rice, maize, cassava, and mango production. It 
will  help  increase  crop  productivity  and  diversification;  improve  the  capacity  for  storage, 
processing,  and quality  and  safety  testing;  and promote the  use  of  solar  and bioenergy. It  will 
strengthen the technical and institutional capacity for climate-smart agriculture (CSA) and create 
an enabling policy environment for climate-friendly agribusinesses. This will in turn promote long-
term environmental sustainability and enhance the profitability for farmers and agribusinesses.

Project Organization Structure 
7. 
MAFF is the executing agency (EA), in close coordination with MOWRAM and MRD. A 
project management unit (PMU) (Figure 1) will be responsible for overall project management, 
procurement and financial management. The PMU updates the project implementation progress 
to the project steering committee. Project implementation consultants (PIC) (package: CS1) will 
be mobilized to support MEF, MAFF, MOWRAM, MRD, and the PMU and PPIUs. 
8. 
The  General  Directorate  of  Agriculture,  CARDI,  GDAHP,  the  General  Directorate  of 
Technical Affairs of MOWRAM and the General Directorate of Technical Affairs of MRD will be 
the implementing agencies (IAs). 
9. 
As strengthening the competitiveness of agricultural value chains will require cooperation 
from multiple institutions. At provincial level, the PDAFF, PDWRAM and Provincial Department of 
Rural  Development (PDRD)  will  be key  agencies working with guidance  and  technical  support 
from  relevant  national  departments.  A  provincial  project  implementation  unit  (PPIU)  will  be 
established in each of the four targeted provinces. The PPIU will be chaired by the director of 
PDAFF,  and  comprising  representatives  of  PDWRAM  and  PDRD,  and  PDAFF  staff  related  to 
cooperatives,  agricultural  extension,  and  animal  health  and  production.  PDWRAMs  will  be 
responsible for coordinating all field activities with FWUCs, while PDRDs will be responsible for 
12 
all  farm  roads  and  connectivity  to  agricultural  cooperatives  (see  Figure  2).  Detailed  terms  of 
reference for the PMU and PPIU staff is in Annex 6. 
10. 
A  public-private  partnership  inter-ministerial  committee  (PPP  IMC)  will  be  formed  and 
chaired by MEF and will have a maximum of 10 representatives solely to review potential PPP 
agribusiness projects and will meet once every two months. The private sector related to the value 
chains  will  have  an  input  though  the  business  forums,  federations  and  associations  that  will 
provide feedback and information to the proposed PPP IMC and on to the steering committee. 
The forums, federations and associations can circumvent the IMC for non-PPP initiatives. 
11. 
The CSA policy activity will be led by the working group that comprises representatives 
from  MAFF,  MEF,  MOC,  MIH  and  MOE.  As  MEF  is  the  EA  of  ADB’s  Rice  Commercialization 
project  which  has  sponsored  a  feasibility  study  on  how  best  to  approach  and  implement  crop 
insurance activities, MEF will also be providing assistance in the crop insurance initiative as well 
as the green finance initiatives.  MEF is also working on and being supported by ADB on PPP 
initiatives. 
12. 
CARDI  and  the  International  Rice  Research  Institute  (IRRI)  will  be  responsible  for  the 
climate resilient variety development activities, but field demonstrations and trials will include full 
coordination with PDAFF. 
13. 
PIC and other technical specialists as well as service providers including government staff 
as  resource  persons  will  carry  out  a  range  of  capacity  building,  training  activities,  pilot 
demonstrations and detailed engineering designs. 
14. 
The  project  steering  committee  (see  Figure  3),  chaired  by  the  Minister  of  MAFF,  vice-
chaired  by  MEF  with  representatives  (at  the  level  of  Under  Secretary  of  State  or  above)  of 
MOWRAM, MRD, MOC, MIH and MOE, will provide oversight, coordination and policy guidance 
in  all  aspects  of  project  implementation,  except  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  which  is  the 
responsibility  of  the  Inter-Ministerial  Resettlement  Committee  (IRC).  Other  ministries  may  be 
invited to attend as observers when specific issues of their concern are for discussion. To make 
decisions quickly, it is recommended that the various steering committee members will be at least 
the rank of director general. The steering committee may invite persons and agencies to discuss 
specific agenda items, when required. For effective decision making, no more than 20 persons 
shall attend at any one meeting. The project steering committee will meet quarterly during the first 
year of the project implementation and semi-annually for subsequent years.

The total project cost is estimated at $141.04 million. The government has requested 
a (i) concessional loan of $90 million from ADB’s ordinary capital resources, and (ii) loan of 
$10 million and a grant of $30 million from the Green Climate Fund (GCF) to be administered 
by ADB on a cost sharing basis, to help finance the project. 
16. 
ADB loan will have a 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years; an interest 
rate of 1.0% per year during the grace period and 1.5% per year thereafter; and such other 
terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. GCF loan will have a 32-year term, 
including a grace period of 8 years; a service charge of 0.25% per year; and such other terms 
and conditions set forth in the draft GCF loan agreement.

FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT 
A. 
Financial Management Assessment 
The financial management assessment (FMA) was conducted in July and August 2016 in 
21. 
accordance with ADB’s Guidelines for the Financial Management and Analysis of Projects, and 
the Financial Due Diligence A Methodology Note. The FMA assessed the capacity of MAFF as 
the executing agency and the provincial offices of MAFF, MOWRAM and MRD in the four project 
provinces, as implementing agencies including funds flow arrangements, staffing, accounting and 
financial  reporting  systems,  financial  information  systems,  and  internal  and  external  auditing 
arrangements. Based on the assessment, the key financial management risks identified are  (i) 
needs  improvements  in  control  of  budget  execution;  accounting  and  reporting,  and  budget 
credibility; (ii) limited financial management capacity of the public-sector institutions; (iii) transfer 
of responsibilities for budget management from MEF to line ministries, including the rolling out of 
the  Financial  Management  Information  System;  and  (iv)  transfer  of functions  and resources to 
sub-national  administrations  (SNAs).  Uncertainty,  delays  in  the  delegation  of  functions,  and 
inadequate  delegation  will  postpone  the  buildup  of  capacity  in  SNAs;  and  (v)  quality  of  both 
internal and external audit reports is improving but remains a concern. It is concluded that the 
overall pre-mitigation financial management risk of the executing and implementing agencies is 
moderate.  The  MEF  has  capacity  to  administer  the  advance  fund  and  implement  SOE 
procedures. The borrower, executing and implementing agencies have agreed to implement an 
action plan as key measures to address the deficiencies. The financial management action plan 
is provided in Table 10.

Disbursement 
1.  Disbursement Arrangements for ADB Funds 
22. 
ADB loan and ADB-administered loan and grant proceeds will be disbursed in accordance 
with ADB’s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time), and detailed 
arrangements agreed upon between the government and ADB. The project staff will undertake  
the  ADB’s  online  training  on  ADB  disbursement  policies  and  procedures  to  ensure  efficient 
disbursement and fiduciary control.4 In addition, they will attend training courses on disbursement 
offered by ADB and Cambodia Resident Mission. 
23. 
The PMU is required to prepare budgets for significant activities as stated in the financing 
agreements and this PAM with sufficient details to allow meaningful monitoring of the subsequent 
performance.  Actual  expenditures  are  required  to  compare  with  the  budgets.  Any  variation 
between the actual expenditure and budgets need to be justified. The detailed budget preparation 
for the project is stated in the Financial Management Manual (FMM).  
4  Disbursement eLearning. http://wpqr4.adb.org/disbursement_elearning 
26 
The funds flow is arranged and disbursed based on the government’s standard operating 
24. 
procedures  (SOP),  FMM,  and  ADB’s  procedures  with  further  discussions  among  concerned 
parties, such as MEF, MAFF, MOWRAM, and MRD. The funds flow of the proposed project is 
detailed in Figure 5. For cofinancing, the GCF will channel all funds through ADB project following 
the ADB’s lending and granting principles and procedures. This includes compliance with ADB’s 
reporting  and  monitoring  systems.  Therefore,  any  cofinancing  would  be  under  ADB  and  the 
government’s standard operating procedures. 
Advance fund procedure. Three advance accounts, one for each funding source will be 
25. 
opened  by  MEF  to  receive  ADB  loan  and  ADB’s  administered  loan  and  grant  separately. 
Correspondingly three designated sub-accounts, one for each funding source, will be opened by 
each of MAFF, MOWRAM and MRD. In each province, PDAFF, PDWRAM and PDRD will open 
three  separate  subaccounts  for  each  funding  source  with  a  threshold  acceptable  to  the 
government  to  cover  the  project’s  day  to  day  operations.  The  respective  directors  of  PDAFF, 
PDWRAM  and  PDRD  in  each  province  will  be  accountable  and  responsible  for  proper  use  of 
advances and reconciliation of the subaccounts. The advance and sub-accounts are to be used 
exclusively for ADB’s and ADB-administered financing’s share of eligible expenditures. MEF is 
accountable  and  responsible  for  proper  use  of  advances  to  the  advance  accounts,  including 
advances to any sub-accounts. 
The total outstanding advance for each advance account should not exceed the estimated 
26. 
expenditure of ADB’s and ADB administered financing’s share to be paid through the advance 
account for the forthcoming six months. MEF may request initial and additional advances to the 
advance  accounts  based  on  an  estimate  of  expenditures  sheet  setting  out  the  estimated 
expenditures  to  be  financed  through  the  accounts  for  the  forthcoming  six  months.5  Supporting 
documents should be submitted to ADB or retained by the executing agency in accordance with 
ADB’s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time) when liquidating or 
replenishing the advance account. 
Statement  of  expenditures  (SOE)  procedure.6  The  SOE  procedure  may  be  used  for 
27. 
reimbursement and to liquidate and replenish the advance accounts for eligible expenditures. Any 
individual payment to be reimbursed or liquidated under this procedure shall not exceed a ceiling 
of  $50,000.  Supporting  documents  and  records  for  the  expenditures  claimed  under  the  SOE 
should be maintained and made readily available for review by ADB's disbursement and review 
missions, upon ADB's request for submission of supporting documents on a sampling basis, and 
for  independent  audit.  Reimbursement  and  liquidation  of  individual  payments  in  excess  of  the 
SOE  ceiling  should  be  supported  by  full  documentation  when  submitting  the  withdrawal 
application to ADB. 
28. 
Before the submission of the first withdrawal application (WA), the borrower should submit 
to  ADB  sufficient  evidence  of  the  authority  of  the  person(s)  who  will  sign  the  withdrawal 
applications on behalf of the government, together with the authenticated specimen signatures of 
each  authorized  person.  The  minimum  value  per  WA  is  stipulated  in  the  Loan  Disbursement 
Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time). Individual payments below this amount should 
be  paid (i)  by  the  executing  agency  and/or  implementing agency  and  subsequently  claimed to 
ADB  through  reimbursement,  or  (ii)  through  the  advance  fund  procedure,  unless  otherwise 
accepted by ADB. The borrower should ensure sufficient category and contract balances before

27 
requesting disbursements. The withdrawal applications must be sequentially numbered starting 
with number one.   
29. 
Disbursement arrangements for counterpart fund. The PMU will be responsible for the 
disbursement and liquidation procedures for government funds and will:(i) prepare disbursement 
projections,  and  (ii)  request  budgetary  allocations  for  counterpart  funds.  The  government  will 
finance all taxes and duties including insurance for all cost categories except civil works, training 
and  project funded  incremental  operating cost,  through tax  exemption.  Priority  operating  costs 
(salary supplements) will also be covered by counterpart funds. 
30. 
Counterpart  funds  replenishment.  The  PMU  completes  the  government  withdrawal 
application (WA) form and attaches a statement of actual expenditure. Supporting expenditure 
documentation must be maintained by the project team for subsequent review by MEF or audit. 
The government’s WA form must be signed by the authorized signatories of MAFF, MOWRAM 
and MRD and submitted to the Department of Multilateral Cooperation (DMC) of GDICDM/MAFF. 
The government’s WA must be recorded in the project counterpart funds WA register. 
31. 
The  DMC  will  review  the  completed  forms  and  transfer  the  funds  to  the  project’s 
counterpart fund account and advises the MAFF of the transfer. On receipt of advice from the 
National  Bank  of  Cambodia  that  the  funds  have  been  deposited  into  the  counterpart  funds 
account, the receipt of the funds should be recorded in the general ledger and the government’s 
WA register must be updated. 
C. 
Accounting 
32.  MEF,  MAFF,  MOWRAM  and  MRD  will  maintain,  or  cause  to  be  maintained,  separate 
books and records by funding source for all expenditures incurred on the project. The executing 
agency  will  prepare  consolidated  project  financial  statements  in  accordance  with  the 
government's accounting laws and regulations which are consistent with international accounting 
principles and practices. 
D. 
Auditing and Public Disclosure 
33.  MAFF will provide detailed consolidated project financial statements to MEF to be audited 
in  accordance  with  the  International  Standards  on  Auditing  and  with  the  government’s  audit 
regulations,  by  an  independent  auditor  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  audited  project  financial 
statements together with the auditor’s opinion will be presented in English language to ADB within 
six months from the end of the fiscal year by MEF. 
34. 
The audit report for the project financial statements will include a management letter and 
auditor’s opinions, which cover (i) whether the project financial statements present an accurate 
and fair view or are presented fairly, in all material respects, in accordance with the applicable 
financial reporting standards; (ii) whether the proceeds of the loan and grant were used only for 
the  purpose(s)  of  the  project;  and  (iii)  whether  the  borrower  or  executing  agency  was  in 
compliance with the financial covenants contained in the legal agreements (where applicable). 
35. 
Compliance with financial reporting and auditing requirements will be monitored by review 
missions and during normal program supervision, and followed up regularly with all concerned, 
including the external auditor. 
28 
The government, MAFF and the implementing agencies have been made aware of ADB’s 
36. 
approach to delayed submission, and the requirements for satisfactory and acceptable quality of 
the audited project financial statements.7 ADB reserves the right to require a change in the auditor 
(in  a  manner  consistent  with  the  constitution  of  the  borrower),  or  for  additional  support  to  be 
provided to the auditor, if the audits required are not conducted in a manner satisfactory to ADB, 
or if the audits are substantially delayed. ADB reserves the right to verify the project's financial 
accounts to confirm that the share of ADB’s financing is used in accordance with ADB’s policies 
and procedures.  
37. 
Public disclosure of the audited project financial statements, including the auditor’s opinion 
on the project financial statements, will be guided by ADB’s Public Communications Policy 2011.8 
After the review, ADB will disclose the audited project financial statements and the opinion of the 
auditors on the project financial statements no later than 14 days of ADB’s confirmation of their 
acceptability  by  posting  them  on  ADB’s  website.  The  management  letter,  additional  auditor’s 
opinions, and audited entity financial statements will not be disclosed.9 
VI. 
PROCUREMENT AND CONSULTING SERVICES 
A. 
Advance Contracting 
All  advance  contracting  will  be  undertaken  in  conformity  with  ADB’s  Procurement 
38. 
Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time) and ADB’s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants 
(2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).10  The  issuance  of  invitations  to  bid  under  advance 
contracting will be subject to ADB’s prior approval. The government, MAFF and the implementing 
agencies  have  been  advised  that  approval  of  advance  contracting  does  not  commit  ADB  to 
finance the project. 
39. 
Advance  contracting.  The  project  will  proceed  to  recruit  the  project  implementation 
consultant  (PIC),  feasibility  study  and  detailed  engineering  design  consulting  firm;  capacity 
building  and  climate  smart  agriculture  consulting  firm;  and  issue  invitation  for  bids  for  the 
construction of the Trapaing Run irrigation subproject.11 
7  ADB’s approach and procedures regarding delayed submission of audited project financial statements:  
(i)  When audited project financial  statements  are  not  received  by  the  due  date,  ADB  will  write  to  the  executing 
agency advising that (a) the audit documents are overdue; and (b) if they are not received within the next six 
months, requests for new contract awards and disbursement such as new replenishment of advance accounts, 
processing of new reimbursement, and issuance of new commitment letters will not be processed. 
(ii)  When  audited  project  financial  statements  are  not  received  within  six  months  after  the  due  date,  ADB  will 
withhold  processing  of  requests  for  new  contract  awards  and  disbursement  such  as  new  replenishment  of 
advance  accounts,  processing  of  new  reimbursement,  and  issuance  of  new  commitment  letters.  ADB  will 
(a) inform the executing agency of ADB’s actions; and (b) advise that the loan may be suspended if the audit 
documents are not received within the next 6 months. 
(iii) When  audited  project  financial  statements  are  not  received  within  12  months  after  the  due  date,  ADB  may 
suspend the loan.

B. 
Procurement of Goods, Works, and Consulting Services 
All procurement of goods, works, and consulting services will be undertaken in accordance 
40. 
with ADB’s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time).  
41. 
International  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  procedures  will  be  used  for  works  contracts 
estimated to cost from $3 million and above, and for goods contracts estimated to cost $1 million 
and  above.  Works  contracts  estimated  to  cost  below  $3  million  up  to  $100,000,  and  goods 
contract below $1 million up to $100,000 will be procured through the national competitive bidding 
(NCB) procedures. Minor items estimated to cost below $100,000 for both works and goods will 
be procured through shopping method.  
42.  When NCB is proposed, before the start of any procurement, ADB and the government 
will  review  the  public  procurement  laws  of  the  central  and  state  governments  to  ensure 
consistency with ADB’s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time).  
An 18-month procurement plan indicating threshold and review procedures, goods, works,

National Competitive Bidding  
i. 
Regulation and Reference Documents  
The procedures to be followed for national competitive bidding shall be those set forth for 
49. 
the National Competitive Bidding (NCB) method in the government’s procurement manual issued 
under  Sub-Decree  Number  74  ANKR.BK,  updated  version  dated  22  May  2012  with  the 
clarifications  and  modifications  described  in the  following  paragraphs.  These  clarifications  and 
modifications are required for compliance with the provisions of the procurement guidelines.  
50. 
For  the  procurement  of  ADB  financed  contracts  under  NCB  procedures,  the  use  of 
harmonized national bidding documents (NCB and National Shopping) developed in consultation 
with development partners including ADB, is mandatory except where the government and ADB 
have agreed to amendments to any part of the documents. The procurement manual also advises 
users to check the ADB website from time to time for any update on ADB documents, which form 
the basis, among others, of the existing harmonized national bidding documents.  
ii. 
Procurement Procedures  
1. 
Application  
51. 
Contract  packages  subject  to  NCB  procedures  will  be  those  identified  as  such  in  the 
project procurement plan. Any change to the mode of procurement of any procurement package 
in the procurement plan shall be made through updating of the procurement plan, and only with 
prior approval of ADB.  
2. 
Sanctioning  
Bidders shall not be declared ineligible or prohibited from bidding on the basis of barring 
52. 
procedures  or  sanction  lists,  except  individuals  and  firms  sanctioned  by  ADB,  without  prior 
approval of ADB.  
3. 
Rejection of All Bids and Rebidding 
53. 
The borrower shall not reject all bids and solicit new bids without ADB’s prior concurrence.  
Even when only one or a few bids is/are submitted, the bidding process may still be considered 
valid if the bid was satisfactorily advertised and prices are reasonable in comparison to market 
values.  
4. 
Advertising  
Bidding of NCB contracts shall be advertised on the ADB website via the posting of the 
54. 
procurement plan. Borrowers have the option of requesting ADB to post specific notices in the 
ADB website.  
iii. 
Bidding Documents  
1. 
Use of Bidding Documents  
The standard NCB documents provided with the government’s procurement manual shall 
55. 
be used to the extent possible both for the master bidding documents and the contract-specific 
bidding  documents.  The  English  language  version  of  the  procurement  documents  shall  be 
38 
submitted for ADB review and approval in accordance with agreed review procedures (post and 
prior review) as indicated in the procurement plan. The ADB-approved procurement documents 
will then be used as a model for all procurement financed by ADB for the project. 
2. 
Bid Evaluation  
Bidders  shall  not  be  eliminated  from  detailed  evaluation  on  the  basis  of  minor,  non-
56. 
substantial deviations.  
57. 
A  bidder  shall  not  be  required,  as  a  condition  for  award  of  contract,  to  undertake 
obligations  not  specified  in  the  bidding  documents  or  otherwise  to  modify  the  bid  as  originally 
submitted.  
3. 
Employer’s Right to Accept or Reject Any or All Bids 
58. 
The  decision  of  the  employer  to  accept  or  reject  any  or  all  bids  shall  be  made  in  a 
transparent manner and involve an obligation to inform of the grounds for the decision through 
the bid evaluation report.  
iv. 
ADB Policy Clauses  
59. 
A  provision  shall  be  included  in  all  NCB  works  and  goods  contracts  financed  by  ADB 
requiring suppliers and contractors to permit ADB to inspect their accounts and records and other 
documents relating to the bid submission and the performance of the contract, and to have them 
audited by auditors appointed by ADB. 
60. 
A provision shall be included in all bidding documents for NCB works and goods contracts 
financed by ADB stating that the borrower shall reject a proposal for award if it determines that 
the  bidder  recommended  for  award  has,  directly  or  through  an  agent,  engaged  in  corrupt, 
fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices in competing for the contract in question. 
61. 
A provision shall be included in all bidding documents for NCB works and goods contracts 
financed by ADB stating that ADB will declare a firm or individual ineligible, either indefinitely or 
for a stated period, to be awarded a contract financed by ADB, if it at any time determines that 
the firm or individual has, directly or through an agent, engaged in corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, 
coercive or obstructive practices or any integrity violation in competing for, or in executing, ADB-
financed contract.

The PIC will provide support and guidance to the feasibility study and detailed engineering 
design  consultants  (package:  CS5)  particularly  in  the  areas  of  preparation  of  social  and 
environmental safeguard studies, economic analysis to ensure compliance with the borrower’s 
and ADB requirement, and climate change resilience and adaptation options, as required. The 
Technical Services consultants will provide support to: (i) on-farm and formal training; (ii) National 
Agriculture Laboratory; (iii) green financing initiatives; and (iv) renewable energy.  
64. 
The International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) (package:CS3), will be recruited using the 
single-source selection method for output 2 in coordination with CARDI. IRRI has been working 
with Cambodia since 1986 and on crops and climate change research since 1991 - a time when 
climate  change  was  considered  a  marginal  topic  within  agriculture  research.  The  institute  has 
defined a coherent research portfolio on climate change emphasizing on three areas: adaptation, 
mitigation, and policy. This sets crop production into the broader context of food supply and food 
security alongside socioeconomic issues, such as rural development and gender mainstreaming. 
IRRI also maintains solid working relationships with other international crop research institutes 
belonging  to  the  Consortium  of  International  Agricultural  Research  Centers  (CGIAR)  and  has 
agreed to deliver their solutions to Cambodia in a seamless manner.13  Detailed terms of reference 
for each package are provided in Annex 2.

A. 
Resettlement and Land Acquisition 
VII. 
SAFEGUARDS 
The project is Category B for involuntary resettlement (IR). The due diligence conducted 
65. 
during the project preparatory stage for three representative subproject suggests that the project 
will  not  entail  significant  impact,  physical  or  economic  displacement,  or  loss  of  livelihood. 
However, given that some subprojects will only be prepared after ADB’s Board approval, a Land 
Acquisition and Resettlement Framework (LARF) has been prepared to set out procedures to be 
used  to  guide  screening  and  selecting  subprojects  during  implementation  as  well  as  the 
subprojects'  Land  Acquisition  and  Resettlement  Planning  (LARP)  if  land  acquisition  and 
involuntary resettlement impacts or related unanticipated impacts are identified. It will also guide 
the due diligence process following completion of the detailed engineering design to justify the 
subproject's category, in case it does not have any impact. The draft resettlement due diligence 
reports for the representative subproject will be updated and finalized, and due diligence report 
for all subsequent subprojects prepared based on detailed engineering design. The LARP will be 
prepared  in  accordance  with  LARF,  ADB's  SPS  and  submitted  to  ADB  for  review  before  any 
contracts are awarded. The LARP should be implemented first before civil works start. 
66. 
Subproject screening will be used during project implementation in identifying additional 
subprojects  and  only  subprojects  classified  as  category  B  or  C  for  IR  will  be  considered  for 
financing.  Projects requiring any significant involuntary resettlement or land acquisition will be 
rejected.  
 The  General  Department  of  Resettlement  (GDR)  will  assume  responsibility  drafting 
67. 
LARPs for the subprojects with IR impact and for internal monitoring during its implementation. 
GDR will ensure that the final LARP: (i) adequately addresses all involuntary resettlement issues 
pertaining to the project, (ii) describes specific mitigation measures that will be taken to address 
the  issues,  and  (iii)  ensures  the  availability  of  sufficient  resources  to  address  the  issues 
satisfactorily.  No  physical  and  economic  displacement  will  occur  until  compensation  in  full  at 
replacement cost and all other entitlements are paid to the displaced person (DP) in accordance 
with the approved LARP.  
68. 
The due diligence report (DDR) prepared for the Trapaing Run irrigation scheme, drafted 
based  on  the  preliminary  design  outcomes,  must  be  updated  upon  completion  of  the  detailed 
engineering  design.  Based  on  the  preliminary  design,  through  a  participatory  detailed 
measurement conducted together with villagers, some 11 households agreed donating a total of 
298m2  mainly  bunds  of  their  farmlands  and  not  exceeding  1.3%  of  the  total  plot  size  per 
household.  Forms  indicating  each  household's  willingness  to  donate  were  signed  by  each 
household  however  the  formal  donation  form  prescribed  by  ADB  has  yet  to  be  signed  and 
witnessed  by  commune  and  village  authorities  as  it  was  agreed  with  the  community  that  this 
should not be done until the final detailed engineering design has been completed and accepted 
by the community.  
IRC shall ensure: (i) efficient project-specific grievance redress mechanisms are in place 
69. 
and functional to assist the affected persons resolve queries and complaints, if any, in a timely 
manner; (ii) all complaints are registered, investigated and resolved in a manner consistent with 
the  provisions  of  the  grievance  redress  mechanism  described  in  the  LARF/LARP;  (iii)  the 
complainants are kept informed about status of their grievances and remedies available to them; 
and  (iv)  adequate  staff  and  resources  are  available  for  supervising  and  monitoring  the 
mechanism. 
42 
The  EA,  IAs,  and  ADB  shall  ensure  that  all  the  safeguards  documents  including  due 
70. 
diligence and monitoring reports are disclosed by: (i) uploading the draft and ADB approved final 
safeguards documents on PMU, and ADB website, (ii) information pamphlet containing summary 
of the projects impacts, if required in local language is distributed among the displaced persons. 
The international and national safeguards specialists will work closely with the project engineer 
to ensure that the detailed engineering design closely accords with the preliminary design already 
accepted by the Trapaing Run community and will ensure that the final design is presented and 
passed  at  subsequent  community  meetings  and  specifically  by  those  affected  households 
donating  land.  The  specialists  will  ensure  that  the  donation  forms  are  completed,  one  per 
household, duly signed by husband and wife, and witnessed by village and commune officials. 
These completed forms must be retained in the project office and made available for case audit 
by an independent agent. 
71. 
The  specialists  will  then  screen  all  additional  subprojects  identified  during  project 
implementation  and  rigidly  apply  both  the  'involuntary"  and  "voluntary"  screening  checklists. 
Where  involuntary  acquisition  or  voluntary  land  donation  will  take  place,  GDR  of  MEF  in 
coordination  with  the  executing  agency  and  specialists  must  prepare  a  LARP  or  DDR  in 
accordance with LARF. This LARP must clearly outline the community consultation process and 
detail  the  benefits  to  be received  by  the  affected  households.  LARPs  will  be  subject to a  10% 
case audit by an independent agent selected through a transparent bidding process conducted 
by the PMU. Because there are no major involuntary resettlement impacts there is no need for an 
external monitoring agency (EMA). 
72. 
Land  for  the  project  purposes  may  be  acquired  through  a  negotiated  settlement  from 
private  land  owners  under  a  commercial  contract.  The  price  will  be  negotiated  as  part  of 
commercial norms based on the replacement cost, and the owner will have the right to refuse the 
offer. In this case, the site will be changed, and the same procedure will be undertaken for the 
newly identified site and private landowner. The government will ensure that any negotiations with 
displaced persons openly address the risks of asymmetry of information and bargaining power of 
the parties involved in the negotiated settlement. For this purpose, government will engage an 
independent external party to document the negotiation and settlement processes in line with the 
requirements of the ADB SPS (2009).  
73.  Where market rates for land might be largely absent, the Replacement Cost Study for the 
Project will consult with affected landowners/users to determine compensation amounts for land 
to be purchased and assets on such land. This will be based on (i) information about recent land 
transactions - if any; (ii) land types; (iii) cropping patterns and crop production; and (iv) availability 
of  land  in  pilot  areas.  The  project  will  ensure  that  compensation  amounts  are  based  on  the 
replacement cost principle in accordance with ADB SPS (2009). 
IRC/GDR in case of involuntary resettlement, shall provide the independent verification of 
74. 
the  agreements  reflecting  that:  (i)  consultation/s  with  landowner/s  have  been  undertaken 
meaningfully, freely and in good faith and the landowners have made informed decisions on use 
of  land,  and  (ii)  terms  and  conditions  of  the  agreements  have  been  explained  to  them  and 
understood  and  agreed  by  the  landowner/s.  (iii)  validate  that  landowner/s  or  any  other 
users/occupants  will  not  experience  major  adverse  impacts  from  land  use  or  purchase  by  the 
Project;  (iv)  validate  that  any  minor  impacts  have  been  identified,  sufficiently  addressed  and 
documented by the project; (v) validate that compensation for any land purchase represents a fair 
and reasonable replacement cost based on market prices; and (vi) validate that the agreement is 
in compliance with safeguard requirements stipulated in this framework 
43 
The PMU in coordination with the local authority will perform following tasks: (i) review of 
75. 
the  documentation  on  the  identification  of  affected  landowners  and  the  consultation  and 
negotiation process leading up to the signing of the agreements; (ii)  validate that consultations 
with the landowners have been undertaken and that they were provided with relevant information 
as per the resettlement framework; (iii) validate that the agreement is voluntary (free of coercion) 
and  that  the  landowner/s  have  fully  understood  and  agreed  to  the  agreement's  terms  and 
conditions;  and  (iv)  validate  that  the  landowner  representative/s  signing  the  agreement  duly 
represent the landowners;. 
76. 
The  external  validation  report  will  not  be  publicly  disclosed  because  transaction  will  be 
based on the commercial contract, and not under involuntary acquisition under the Expropriation 
Law. The external party validation report will be kept in files of IRC/GDR and copy sent to ADB 
for internal concurrence.  
In case if negotiations fail, expropriation will be followed, and LARP will be prepared based 
77. 
on LARF and according to ADB SPS (2009). 
78.  Meaningful consultations were carried out during the project preparatory stage for three 
representative subprojects during resettlement due diligence. However, for continued information 
sharing,  MAFF  and  GDR  shall  ensure  that:  (i)  additional  consultations  are  conducted  during 
updating and implementation of the safeguards documents; (ii) the displaced persons if any  are 
informed  about:  (a)  resettlement  impacts,  asset  valuation,  entitlements  and  compensation 
payment modalities with timelines, (b) rehabilitation and income restoration measures suggested 
for  the  project  displaced  persons,  and  (c)  project-specific grievance  redress mechanism  put  in 
place with status of redress of grievances; and (iii) liaison is maintained with affected persons and 
community,  and  consultation  meetings  are  held  regularly  with  surrounding  communities  and 
project  displaced  persons  including  women  and  vulnerable  groups  to  share  project  related 
information during project implementation period. 
B. 
Indigenous People and / or Ethnic Minority Groups 
79. 
The project is Category B for indigenous people or ethnic minorities as there are ethnic 
minority communities in target provinces (mainly ethnic Cham and Vietnamese). Although there 
are ethnic minorities living in the project target provinces, no such communities or households 
were encountered in the three representative subproject feasibility studies. However, it is possible 
that  additional  subprojects  identified  during  implementation  may  affect  ethnic  minority 
communities or households. 
80. 
An  ethnic  minority  development  framework  (EMDF)  has  been  prepared  during  project 
preparation. The underlying feature of the EMDF is inclusion and participation, although there are 
some constraints beyond the parameters of influence of the project that could affect the degree 
of benefit available. The EMDF recommends action to maximize participation and consultation 
with any minority households should they be encountered. 
If during detailed engineering design or implementation, any change to the scope, location 
81. 
with prior approval of ADB, causes to have any impact on indigenous peoples or ethnic minorities, 
EA/IA shall take all steps required to ensure that the  project complies with the applicable laws 
and  regulations  of  Cambodia  and  ADB’s  SPS  2009.The  national  safeguards  specialist  will 
undertake subproject screening to ascertain the presence of any ethnic minorities and where they 
are present, will include actions from the EMDF as appropriate. 
44 
C. 
Environment 
82. 
Environmental  safeguard  category.  Based  on  ADB’s  rapid  environment  assessment 
checklist,  the  project  is  classified  as  Category  B.  An  environmental  assessment  and  review 
framework  (EARF)  has  been  prepared  to  guide  future  subproject  selection,  screening, 
assessment  and  reporting.  An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  was  prepared  for  the 
Trapaing Run Irrigation Subproject in Kampot province; and environmental codes of conduct were 
prepared  for  the  Mango  Drip  Irrigation  Subproject  in  Takeo  province,  and  the  Cassava  Chip 
Drying  and  Storage  Unit  in  Tboung  Khmum  province.  These  confirmed  that  the  proposed 
investments are not likely to cause significant adverse environmental impacts.  
83. 
Environmental management plan (EMP). An EMP has been prepared for the Trapaing 
Run Irrigation Subproject in Kampot province and included in its IEE. For future subprojects, the 
EMP presents impacts, mitigation and monitoring measures, institutional arrangements, training 
requirements and implementation budget.  Budgets for EMP implementation will be included in 
the design, construction and operation and maintenance costs. The EMP will be implemented by 
the  contractors  and  supervised  by  PIC  and  implementing  agencies.  The  EMP  is  a  critical 
document  for  project  implementation  and  requirements  are  subject  to  project  assurances  and 
contractor requirements.  
Grievance  redress  mechanism.  A  grievance  redress  mechanism  (GRM)  will  be 
84. 
established  in  each  subproject  province  in  compliance  with  ADB’s  SPS  (2009)  requirement  to 
prevent and address community concerns and assist the project to maximize environmental and 
social benefits. The GRM will be accessible to diverse members of the community, including more 
vulnerable  groups  such  as  women  and  youth.  Multiple  points  of  entry,  including  face-to-face 
meetings, written complaints, telephone conversations, or e-mail, will be available. Details about 
the GRM can be found in the EARF and IEE. 
Institutional arrangements for environmental management. MAFF will be responsible 
85. 
for ensuring that project performance is monitored throughout implementation and the project is 
implemented  in  line  with  ADB  and  government  requirements  for  environmental  safeguards.  
MAFF will appoint a National Safeguards Officer at PMU to coordinate with MRD and MOWRAM 
at the national and provincial level to oversee implementation of project environmental safeguard 
requirements.  An International Environment and Climate Change Specialist (8 person-months), 
and a National Environmental and Climate Change Specialist (50 person-months) will be recruited 
under PIC to support PMU National Safeguards Officer with climate risk screening of subprojects, 
environmental  training,  environmental  supervision  and  monitoring  and  preparation  of  quarterly 
project progress reports and semi-annual environmental monitoring reports in accordance with 
the  EARF.  In  addition,  an international  environmental  safeguards  specialist  (2 person-months) 
and a national environmental safeguards specialist (10 person-months) will also be recruited as 
part of the Package CS5: Feasibility and Detailed Engineering Design to assist with environmental 
and screening of subprojects and preparation of assessment reports and management plans as 
part of the feasibility studies and detailed engineering design.  
Prohibited investment activities. Pursuant to ADB’s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), 
86. 
ADB  funds  may  not  be  applied  to  the  activities  described  on  the  ADB  Prohibited  Investment 
Activities List set forth at Annex 5 of the Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). 
Disclosure.  The  executing  agency  and  implementing  agencies  will  be  responsible  for 
87. 
disclosing  all  safeguard  reports  at  the  provincial  level  and  on  the  project  website.  During  the 
project  implementation  period,  all  IEEs  and  semi-annual  environmental  safeguard  monitoring 
45 
reports will be submitted to ADB every July, which will cover the reporting period of January to 
June, and every January, which covers the reporting period of July to December for disclosure on 
ADB website.   
VIII.  GENDER AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS 
88.  Gender dimensions. Women are key actors in the value chains especially for rice and 
cassava.  They  are  producers,  collectors/intermediaries  and  rice  millers,  and  own  and  operate 
their own enterprises. Rural women generally have joint access and control to land and capital 
together with their husbands and are solely responsible for managing finances for the household. 
There is equal access of men and women to markets. Both husband and wife jointly agree when, 
where  and  to  whom  to sell  the  crop,  but  it  is  the  responsibility  of  the  wife  to  contact  the  local 
(usually  female)  collector.  Nationally,  women  represent  about  60%  of  agricultural  cooperative 
members, and they run over a third of fruit and vegetable processing enterprises and almost half 
of all wholesale agricultural raw materials enterprises. Majority of women’s businesses are micro-
enterprises. 
89.  Women are aware of their own technical shortcomings and express an eagerness to learn 
new techniques. They are also aware that they have had fewer agricultural training opportunities 
than men, which may be partly explained with the current practice of addressing invitations for 
agricultural trainings and meetings to the heads of the household (thus mostly men). The use of 
visual  teaching  aids  during  information  and  training  sessions  was  also  found  to  be  crucial  to 
enhance farmers’ understanding, especially women who continue to have lower literacy levels. 
During   PPTA  consultations,  some women expressed interest to learn  how  to drive two-wheel 
tractors and operate other agricultural machinery, which would allow them the opportunity to have 
paid  work  as drivers  and  prepare  them for future farm mechanization. Other major  challenges 
related  to  the  sector  and  project  faced  by  both  women  and men  although  more  so  by  women 
include lack of access to year-round water, labor force for agricultural production, affordable credit 
and market related information.   
90. 
Nationally, 22% of all households are headed by women. Female-headed households with 
more than two children and no adult males are much more likely to be poor and the girls more 
likely to be working. Households headed by women are likely to be more vulnerable, have smaller 
land holdings than men, and more frequently suffer from labor shortages. For households headed 
by older women where adult children have migrated and left grandchildren in their care, it was 
found  during  the  PPTA  that  their  workload  is  very  substantial.  In  addition  to  taking  care  of 
numerous small children and livestock, they also in many cases need to work as day laborers to 
make ends meet. 
91.  MAFF prepared the Gender Mainstreaming Policy and Strategic Framework in Agriculture 
2016–2020 (GMPS). The GMPS contains strategic objectives to: (1) promote women’s economic 
empowerment through women’s access to goods and services for agricultural development and 
markets; (2) strengthen capacities, resources and commitment within MAFF to ensure effective 
mainstreaming  of  gender  perspectives  into  agriculture  sector;  and  (3)  increase  women’s  and 
men’s equal representation and participation in agriculture sector. 
92. 
Gender Action Plan (GAP). A GAP (Table 15) has been prepared for this project, which 
includes gender actions, performance indicators and targets to promote women’s voice and active 
participation  in  all  project  activities.  It  will  support  the  strengthening  of  national  systems  for 
mainstreaming  gender  in  MAFF,  such  as  the  MAFF  Gender  &  Children  Project  Support  Unit 
(GCPSU), the Women Farmers Network (WFN) and the operationalization of the MAFF GMPS, 
46 
in particular specific outputs under the Strategic Framework and components that are relevant to 
this  project.  During  implementation,  GAP  actions  will  align  to  build  on  and  synergize  with  the 
MOWA Climate Change Strategy and Plan and the ADB Mainstreaming Climate Resilience into 
Development Planning (MCRDP) project (CSO and MOWA/Gender Components). 
93.  GAP Implementation. The executing and implementing agencies, especially PMU and 
PPIUs, will be responsible for the implementation and monitoring of GAP, and will work in close 
partnership  with  MAFF  GCPSU  and  provincial  gender  focal  points,  as  well  as  the  WFN,  and 
to  ensure  sustainable 
agricultural  cooperatives.  The  principles  underpinning  GAP  are 
improvements in gender processes and outcomes at an institutional and policy level by building 
capacity as follows:  
(i) 
(ii) 
To mainstream gender into partner institutions such as: executing agency (MAFF), 
implementing  agency,  at  national  and  sub-national  levels  (i.e.  Department  of 
Agriculture Extension, etc.), agribusinesses and cooperatives, FWUCs, MFIs, etc.; 
and 
Of existing gender, responsive entities such as the MAFF GCPSU and WFN, to 
advocate for, facilitate and monitor expanding women farmers’ access to services 
and opportunities through collaboration and partnership in all project activities.  
94. 
Close partnership with WFN is particularly important for the following reasons:  
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
The WFN was established in 2015 with the support from the MAFF GCPSU, and 
is represented by two women farmers in each province; 
Many of the network members are also local leaders such as commune council 
members, cooperative members or savings group members, and they are invited 
and  encouraged  to  attend  province-level  MAFF  workshops for  capacity  building 
and training of trainers; 
Technical information to women farmers in the network is disseminated through 
social media pages (which the project can tap into); and 
The Network has links to local Community Innovation Centers (which can be used 
for  training  activities),  one  of  which  is  in  Takeo.  Note  that  the  most  important 
demands of the WFN include increase women’s access to credit (with low interest 
rates),  and management  and  business  training  and  support  –  which  the  project 
aims to address. 
95. 
The PMU will appoint a safeguard and gender focal point, who will work closely with the 
MAFF GCPSU at national level, and the provincial implementing units will work closely with the 
provincial  gender focal  points  in each  of the  four  provinces.  A  social  development  and gender 
consultants  (for  international,6  person-months  and  for  national,  50  person-months)  will  be 
recruited  as  part  of  the  PIC  team,  will  build  capacity  of  the  gender  focal  points,  the  PMU  and 
provincial  implementing  unit  staff  as  well  as  the  MAFF  GCPSU,  in  gender  analysis  and 
mainstreaming,  and  support  GAP  implementation,  monitoring  and  reporting.  Work  plans  and 
budget to implement the GAP activities will be prepared annually.  
96. 
Adequate financial resources have been allocated to implement the GAP. Implementation 
of its activities should be covered by the budget allocated for implementation of the regular project 
activities  under  the  corresponding  outputs,  including  any  extra  costs  implied  by  special 
arrangements that shall be made to facilitate and increase women’s participation in the regular 
project  activities  (e.g.  such  as  series  of  shorter  training  sessions  at  venue  closer  to  their 
communities and provision of on-site child supervision for women trainees as needed, etc.).

sector 
3.1.1 At project inception, refine the gender analysis for 
each of the 4 targeted value chains and develop a set of 
clear policy and program recommendations to strengthen 
women farmers’ involvement along the different value 
chains. Ensure that capacity is built within MAFF/ Gender 
& Children Project Support Unit (GCPSU) for gender 
responsive value chain analysis and develop 
methodology/guidelines that can be used in future 
analysis.  
3.1.2 Integrate key recommendations from the above-
mentioned gender analysis of value chains and key 
features of the MAFF Gender Policy into the Agribusiness 
policy and other related documents prepared under the 
project. 
- This would also mean that gender stakeholders (MAFF 
GCPSU representatives, gender focal points, and WFN) 
participate in policy committees and meetings. 
3.1.3 Integrate a session on gender equality in climate-
friendly agribusiness value chains (based on gender 
analysis report mentioned above) into the training and 
awareness raising activities for relevant project 
stakeholders (i.e. relevant departments in MAFF, 
agricultural extension agents, local leaders and 
government officials, GCPSU and Gender Focal Points, 
and WFN).

could  increase  community  exposure  to  HIV/AIDS,  nevertheless  the  impact  of  risk  from 
communicable diseases (HIV/AIDS) is low and the impact of other social risks such as human 
trafficking is not a risk in the locations. The contractors will be obliged to comply with health and 
safety standards for all infrastructure works during the project life-time. The contractors will need 
to be compliant with remuneration and gender requirements including equal pay for work of equal 
value. Employment opportunities for ID-Poor households and women will be available. Wherever 
feasible the contractor will employ local people to undertake the infrastructure development tasks.

B. 
Monitoring 
100.  Project  performance  monitoring.  A  draft  project  performance  monitoring  system 
(PPMS), has been developed (Annex 3) based on the key indicators and targets outlined in DMF. 
It shall be implemented by the PMU in conjunction with the implementing agencies and support 
from the PIC in accordance with ADB's Project Performance Monitoring System Handbook within 
six  months  of  project  effectiveness.  The  PPMS  procedures,  performance  indicators,  and  their 
targets will be reviewed and approved by ADB. Benchmark review mainly focusing on secondary 
data  will  be  conducted.  With  the  help  of  PIC,  the  PMU  will  then  undertake  every  six  months 
quantitative  and  qualitative  project-performance  monitoring  for  each  subproject  activity  to 
evaluate the delivery of planned facilities and the project benefits that accrued.   
101.  Compliance monitoring. A number of assurances have been given by the government 
to ensure smooth implementation of the project as reflected in the financing covenants. ADB will 
monitor compliance with those covenants during project implementation through regular review 
missions, quarterly progress reports submitted by the PMU, and review of project accounts and 
procurement procedures.  
102.  Safeguards monitoring. The implementing agencies, assisted by PIC, will prepare and 
submit  to  the  executing  agency  semi-annual  reports  on  the  environmental  impacts  identified 
during implementation. The report will cover environment performance based on implementation 
of the environmental management plans. The executing agency, through PIC, will be responsible 
for  the  consolidation  and  submission  of  the  reports  to  ADB  in  accordance  to  the  format  and 
process described in the IEEs and EARF. 
103.  LARF details on monitoring and reporting requirements for involuntary resettlement. PMU 
will be responsible for internal monitoring for the project, which they will conduct in cooperation 
with monitoring department under the GDR, while an external monitoring agency will be hired to 
conduct external monitoring and evaluation for involuntary resettlement, if necessary. A summary 
of the results from these monitoring will feed into the quarterly monitoring reports. During detailed 
engineering design, the draft social safeguards due diligence report will be updated. If there are 
any changes, additional land requirements or resettlement impacts are identified, LARP will be 
prepared by GDR in close coordination with EA and PMU. The LARP will be reviewed by ADB 
prior  to  award  of  civil  works  and  implemented  before  implementation  of  civil  works. 
Implementation shall be monitored internally by GDR and EA with support of PMU. During LARP 
implementation, the monitoring results shall be consolidated into semiannual monitoring reports 
and  shared  with  ADB  for  review,  clearance  and  disclosure  on  ADB  and  EA’s  websites.  Once 
LARP  implementation  is  completed,  semi-annual  monitoring  reports  will  be  prepared  and 
submitted to ADB for review and clearance. Upon clearance of monitoring reports by ADB, these 
will be disclosed by uploading on MAFF and ADB websites. PMU will be adequately staffed with 
social safeguards and resettlement specialists. 
104.  Climate  change.  The  overall  project  is  categorized  as  medium.  However,  it  was  rated 
high as per the AWARE risk screening tool. It is therefore important that the PIC responsible for 
infrastructure development and capacity building have sufficient climate change experience and 
capability  to  ensure  and  maximize  adaptation  possibilities,  promote  climate  smart  agricultural 
practices, and ensure that the project satisfactorily ensures that farmers are aware of the risks 
and the steps they can take to adapt. 
105.  Gender  and  social  dimensions monitoring.  Sex-disaggregated  data  will  be  collected 
wherever relevant and gender specific and sensitive indicators (from the DMF and GAP) will be 
56 
integrated as part of the PPMS. The progress of gender and social activities and targets outlined 
in the GAP will be monitored and reported regularly (at least semi-annually) by the PMU together 
with the project progress  reports; the template to be used for GAP monitoring and reporting is 
included as Annex 4. Achievement of performance indicators of the GAP outlined in the DMF will 
be updated semi-annually in the PPMS.  
C. 
Evaluation 
106.  ADB  will  conduct  regular  (i.e.  at  least  twice  per  year)  reviews  throughout  project 
implementation to (i) assess the progress of project activities and outputs and effectiveness of 
implementation  arrangements;  (ii)  monitor  safeguard  compliance  with  ADB  Safeguard  Policy 
Statement (2009); (iii) review compliance with loan and grant agreements and related matters; 
(iv) follow up on decisions and actions agreed during previous review missions; and (v) resolve 
any project implementation issues that may arise.  
D. 
Reporting 
107.  MAFF PMU will provide ADB with (i) quarterly progress reports in a format consistent with 
ADB's  project  performance  reporting;  (ii)  consolidated  annual  reports  including  (a)  progress 
achieved  by  output  as  measured  through  the  indicator's  performance  targets,  (b)  key 
implementation  issues  and  solutions,  (c)  updated  procurement  plan,  and  (d)  updated 
implementation plan for the next 12 months; and (iii) a project completion report within six months 
of physical completion of the project. To ensure that the project will continue to be both viable and 
sustainable,  project  accounts  and  the  project’s  audited  financial  statement  together  with  the 
associated auditor's report should be adequately reviewed. 
E. 
Stakeholder Communication Strategy 
108.  A  stakeholder  communication  strategy  has  been  prepared  to  ensure  that  vulnerable 
groups, such as the poor and female-headed households, who risk marginalization, are provided 
with  opportunities  for  receiving  timely  information,  and  can  provide  feedback  during  project 
implementation. Table 16 explains further on what project information will be communicated, the 
means of communication, who will provide the information, the audiences and the frequency.

ANTICORRUPTION POLICY 
109.  ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any violations of the 
Anticorruption  Policy  relating  to  the  project.15  All  contracts  financed  by  ADB  shall  include 
provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the 
executing agency and all project contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers. 
Individuals and/or entities on ADB’s anticorruption debarment list are ineligible to participate in 
ADB-financed activity and may not be awarded any contracts under the project.16 
110. 
To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  the  ADB’s  Anticorruption  Policy  are 
included in the financing agreement and the bidding documents for the project. The project design 
and implementation arrangements provide for mitigation of corruption risks. Risks associated with 
project  management,  including  procurement  and  disbursement,  will  be  mitigated  by  the 
engagement  of  PIU  to  advise  and  assist  in  the  procurement  of  goods  and  services,  and  the 
engagement of other consultants. The project will also establish a website in which it will disclose 
implementation  progress,  bid notifications  and  their  results,  and  provide grievance mechanism 
against any corrupt practice. References on ADB’s Anticorruption Policy can be accessed through 
the  following  link:  http://www.adb.org/integrity/.  Guidelines  on  governance  and  anticorruption 
action plan are also available.17 
XI. 
ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISM 
111.  People who  are,  or may  in the future  be,  adversely  affected  by  the  project may  submit 
complaints  to  ADB’s  Accountability  Mechanism.  The  Accountability  Mechanism  provides  an 
independent forum and process whereby people adversely affected by ADB-assisted projects can 
voice,  and  seek  a  resolution  of  their  problems,  as  well  as  report  alleged  violations  of  ADB’s 
operational  policies  and  procedures.  Before  submitting  a  complaint  to  the  Accountability 
Mechanism, affected people should make an effort in good faith to solve their problems by working 
with  the  concerned  ADB  operations  department.    Only  after  doing  that,  and  if  they  are  still 
dissatisfied, they then approach the Accountability Mechanism.18

Implementation Arrangements per Project Outputs 
IMPLEMENTATION PROCEDURES 
Output  1:  Critical  agribusiness  value  chain  infrastructure  improved  and  made 
1. 
climate resilient. Include the following key activities: 
Activity 1.1. Rehabilitating water management infrastructure to climate resilient condition: 
2. 
The lack of irrigation systems, surface and ground water extraction infrastructure restricts most 
farmers to a single rainfed crop per year, while poor on-farm water management is constraining 
production. High rainfall variability and expected changes in rainfall regimes from climate change 
are  expected  to  exacerbate  this  situation.  Under  this  activity,  at  least  27  irrigation  and  water 
management  systems  are  rehabilitated  and  modernized  to  become  climate  resilient.  The 
improved  infrastructure  will  cover  a  minimum  of  15,000  ha  under  irrigation  command  and  will 
benefit at least 25,000 households. At least 60% of these households will then have the capacity 
to have sufficient water resources to irrigate a second crop and 30% of households, a third crop. 
Several potential subproject investments have been screened by the PPTA consultants. 
3. 
Critical  design  features  contributing  to  climate  resilience  include  (i)  enhanced  storage 
capacity; (ii) improved regulation of flow rates, including adequate flow capacity of regulators and 
other structures to prevent or reduce scour; (iii) improved water allocation within the command 
area, including division of the command area into compartments to allow for orderly cultivation of 
a part of the area in case of water shortage; (iv) concrete lining of distribution canals to reduce 
the seepage losses; (v) enhanced flood resilience; and (vi) improved drainage and salinity control 
(in affected areas). In addition, climate resilience in infrastructure interventions can be enhanced 
by the following measures: (i) high overall efficiencies (high output per m3 of water); (ii) optimal 
balance  between  water  demand  and  water  availability;  (iii)  limited  reliance  on  pumping;  (iv) 
predictable  and  reliable  water  allocation  over  time  and  within  the  scheme;  and  (v)  effective 
cooperation between farmer water user groups (FWUGs) in terms of sharing knowledge about 
management options, covering both cultivation and water management. 
4. 
The selection criteria applied were, the subproject: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
(v) 
(vi) 
Is an existing small to medium scale irrigation system with good balance between 
water demand and raw water availability; 
The command area of the subproject should be sufficient to demonstrate climate 
change adaptation  measures  (improved  technical  design,  enhanced water  used 
efficiency, good agricultural practices, and improved water use governance), and 
to ensure that the subproject would be more climate resilient than its current status.  
Should have strong political and community ownership in terms of commitment to 
implement climate change adaptation measures and ensure effective operations 
and maintenance (O&M);  
Is not supported by other ongoing or proposed development projects financed by 
ADB or other development partners; 
Has  existing  farmer  water  user  group  (FWUG)  or  farmer  water  user  community 
(FWUC) or is ready for registration; 
Should involve rehabilitation of both primary canals and distribution canal networks 
(secondary  and  tertiary  canals)  to  ensure  that  water  reaches  the  farms,  with 
minimum water loss; 
(vii)  Has  low  irrigation  efficiency  and  low  water  productivity,  and  scope  for 
improvement, with sufficient water resources; 
68 
Annex 1  
(viii)  Should have viable economic returns (a minimum economic internal rate of return 
(ix) 
(x) 
(xi) 
of 12%) and a realistic and technically viable O&M plan; 
Should be category B or C for involuntary resettlement, environmental impact and 
ethnic minority; 
Should  have  high  potential  for  cluster  (cooperative)  development  and  include 
vulnerable communities, poor and women farmers as beneficiaries. 
Should  enhance  capacity  of  the  beneficiaries  to  operate  and  maintain  irrigation 
schemes sustainably with little or no external intervention other than the normal 
extension services. 
5. 
At least 800 on farm surface water catchment ponds will be dug and commissioned. Each 
pond will be used for supplementary irrigation not only for the target crops but will be used for 
more intensive horticulture and tree crop production and will be sited to collect surface run-off and 
have sediment traps to avoid excessive sedimentation. Selection criteria applied were: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
(v) 
(vi) 
(vii) 
(viii) 
The recipient must be a smallholder willing to work with the project to implement 
climate resilient agricultural practices associated with surface water catchment; 
The recipient must have a land title, or equivalent;  
Preference is given to female headed households; 
The plot of land has problems relating to excessive rainwater run-off or drainage 
channels  or  gullies  running  through  the  plot,  both  of  which  can  be  “tapped”  to 
provide supplementary irrigation; 
The  smallholder  can  show  that  there  will  be  benefits  to  intensive  agricultural 
production through using of the pond as a supplementary irrigation source; 
The farmer commits not to sell or transfer the land to a third party during the life of 
the project, to ensure capital gain;  
The farmer commits to contribute to necessary O&M of water catchment pond; and 
If required, the farmer has no objection for his or her farm to be used as a training 
and demonstration location for the duration of the project. 
6. 
The  project  will  support  establishment  of  drip  irrigation  demonstration  units  on  mango 
farmers’  land  mainly  in  Kampot  and  Takeo  provinces.19  The  demonstrations  will  be  used  for 
training  of  not  only  the  recipient  farmer  but  also  for  surrounding  mango  farmers  and  MAFF 
nominated training of trainers. So far, there are no mango producers and marketing associations 
in the target provinces. It is hoped that through meetings at the demonstrations and field days, a 
producers’ association can be created. The demonstrations on drip irrigation will also involve the 
use of solar energy for pumping, wherever feasible. The use of solar energy is expected to reduce 
overall energy costs in operating the drip irrigation scheme. The selection criteria for drip irrigation 
demonstration sites include the following, the recipient: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
Must be a smallholder and not an absentee farmer; 
Must have a land title, or equivalent;  
Has marketing contacts that require Grade A fruit or has the potential of gaining 
such contracts; 
(iv)  Must grow the Keo Romeat mango variety or other climate resilient varieties that 
(v) 
are amenable to floral manipulation and have market potential 
Has access to the water or water is available for a borehole and pond construction 
(if  of  sufficient  size  or  replenishment  to  satisfy  the  water  demands  of  irrigating 
mango); 
19 MAFF has requested at least one demonstration drip irrigation unit to be located in Kampong Speu province which 
borders Takeo and is the most important mango producing province in the east of the country.

Is  willing  to  work  with  the  project  and  accepts  the  technical  innovation  of  drip 
irrigation and solar pumping; 
(vii)  Commits not to sell or transfer the land to a third party during the life of the project, 
to achieve capital gain and; and 
(viii)  Has no objection for his or her farm to be used as a training and demonstration 
location for the duration of the project.  
Activity  1.2  Upgrading  agricultural  cooperative  value  chain  infrastructure  (drying, 
7. 
processing  and  storage  facilities)  is  aimed  at  strengthening  the  agricultural  cooperative  value 
chain  infrastructure.  Currently  the  drying,  storage,  and  processing  facilities  at  agricultural 
cooperatives are rudimentary and are highly vulnerable to impacts of climate change. The drying 
process is undertaken on the ground, over tarpaulin. For instance, in case of cassava chips, a 
stable product is attained when the moisture content is below 14%, as anything higher leads to 
black spot and molds, as well as a reduction in the starch percentage. In terms of cleanliness, 
gravel and dirt in the sample can be problematic for the traders and processors. If not processed 
within  4  days,  the  roots  of  fresh  cassava  will  deteriorate.  Humidity  and  high  temperatures  in 
storage negatively impacts the quality of the product, and can also encourage the appearance of 
insects,  pests  and  diseases.  In  addition  to  poor  post-harvest  management,  infrequent  and 
unexpected  rainfall  increases  the  exposure  of  harvested  crops  to  humidity,  leading  to  the 
development of aflatoxins, and resulting in food safety threats to the whole food chain. 
8. 
The project will support selected agricultural cooperatives by installing 50 (12 units), 100 
(44 units) or 200 (24 units) ton cleaning, drying and storage units. The size of the storage will 
depend on the crop commodity or the trade that the cooperative deals in seed grain, grain for 
processing or cassava chips. The objectives of such support are to: (i) reduce post-harvest losses; 
(ii) manage the grain or cassava chip materials and its moisture content particularly in the rainy 
season; (iii) ensure a better price by providing delivery flexibility to processors within the value 
chain; and (v) encourage processors and buyers to form linkages with cooperatives to stabilize 
supply  and  demand.  Storage  units  will  be  climate-proofed  by  considering  current  climate 
variability  and  projected  climate  change  extremes  and  associated  pests  and  diseases.  The 
measures will include providing for improved aeration, drainage and runoff management, humidity 
control, pest control, and waste management.  In addition, solar power will be introduced within 
the  stores  for  ventilation  and  drying,  lighting  and  powering  management  systems.  Energy 
efficiency measures will be implemented in the infrastructure for drying, processing and storage 
to  reduce  carbon  emissions  from  fuel  wood  currently  used  to  operate  these  facilities.  The 
cooperatives will be prioritized as per eligibility criteria:  
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
The  cooperative must  be registered for more  than  a year  and  is  able  to  access 
loans;20 
The cooperative stores seed and/or is trading or has a business plan (that includes 
O&M)  to  develop  a  trading  agribusiness  with  potential  downstream  value  chain 
linkages; 
It should have at least 1,000 m2 land available or planning to buy similar area; 
It should have a reserve fund, with preference to those reinvesting at least 10% 
above the minimum legal requirement of 20% gross profit (the minimum stipulated 
in the Law on Agricultural Cooperatives 2013) into the reserve fund; 
20 Agricultural cooperatives can be registered with MAFF and those that have access to formal financing. The Rural Development 
Bank will support those cooperatives with good management and business plans with loans, this is a recent move (June 2016) and 
is backed by an AFD guarantee which commits to cover 65% of any losses; average loan size $5,000. 
70 
Annex 1  
(v) 
(vi) 
The  cooperative  should  have  strong  commitment  to  implement  climate  change 
measures to reduce vulnerability to impacts of climate change and reduce carbon 
footprint of its operations through promoting bioenergy (biodigesters), renewable 
energy (e.g., solar roofs) and improving energy efficiency. 
It should have strong commitment of cooperative management team and approved 
by  at  least  2/3  of  members  as  detailed  in  Article  43  on  the  Law  of  Agricultural 
Cooperatives.21 However, the 2/3 majority will be for all members and not just those 
attending general meetings; 
The  cooperative  should  develop  a  realistic  and  technically  viable  O&M  plan  for 
post-harvest and renewable energy infrastructure at the cooperative; 
(viii)  There is full social and gender inclusion within its membership;22 and 
(ix) 
The area under cooperative primarily grows rice, maize and/or cassava. 
(vii) 
Activity 1.3 Improving connectivity to cooperatives and markets through climate resilient 
9. 
farm road networks provides access to markets and road networks by improving rural roads and 
tracks within communes for at least 250 km with a mix of gravel or concrete bases depending on 
the traffic volumes and community needs. It will focus on linking the proposed cooperative storage 
and drying units in two ways: (i) linking farm units and the production zones to the storage units; 
and (ii) connectivity of the stores to all-weather and or climate resilient roads, the latter being more 
durable structures to tolerate heavy transport and delivery trucks. 
10. 
During  the  feasibility  study,  three  climate  resilient  design  features  were  considered: 
(i) increasing embankment heights; (ii) providing cross drainage; and (iii) selecting embankment 
materials  suitable  for  increased  permeability.  In  addition,  green  planting  (bioengineering)  has 
been considered for strengthening embankments for road sections that are exposed to higher risk 
of damage due to flooding. Regarding increased embankment heights, an average 0.2 m design 
height  above  the  conventional  road  design  height  has  been  adopted.  However,  this  will  be 
reconfirmed during the detailed engineering design stage based on detailed hydrological data. As 
for  cross  drainage,  the  preliminary  design  has  considered  the  adequacy  of  existing  structures 
(pipe and box culverts, and small bridges of single span, as there are no larger bridges) and has 
included readjustments with additional structures for strengthening cross drainage. This again will 
be reconfirmed during detailed engineering design while refurbishing the existing structures for 
their  optimal  use.  For  embankment  materials,  laterite  has  been  cost  optimal,  again  to  be 
reconfirmed during detailed engineering design, especially for road sections that are exposed to 
higher risk of damage due to flooding. 
11. 
In addition to improving climate resilience of farm roads in target provinces, the project will 
strengthen capacity of the Ministry of Rural Development (MRD), and the Provincial Departments 
of  Rural  Development  (PDRD)  to  develop  guidelines  for  improving  climate  resilience  of  rural 
infrastructure.  In cooperation with MRD, the project will also build capacity of civil engineers in 
design, construction, maintenance and climate proofing of rural road networks. Operations and 
maintenance costs will be jointly borne by MRD and the communities. Selection criteria include 
the following: 
21  Article 43: decisions relating to statute, internal regulations, division, amalgamation or dismissal of members shall be made by two 
thirds  majority  of  votes  of  members  present  in  the  general  meeting.  Other  decisions  of  the  general  meeting  shall  be  made  by 
majority of votes of members present.

movement of farm produce to agricultural markets; 
Should  have  a  strong  political  and  community  commitment  to  implement 
adaptation measures and support a realistic and technically viable O&M plan; 
Should  be  consistent  with  MRD’s  priorities  for  rural  development  and 
decentralization; 
Should  be  Category  B  or  C  for  involuntary  resettlement,  ethnic  minority  / 
indigenous people, and environment; 
Should achieve the economic threshold limit of 12% for the economic internal 
rate of return; and 
(vii)  Must have at least 40% female beneficiaries. 
Activity  1.4  Strengthening  infrastructure  for  agricultural  quality  and  safety  testing  at  the 
12. 
National Agricultural Laboratory (NAL). The newly inaugurated Plant Biotechnology Laboratory 
(PBL) will be supported; no building is required as the sanitary and phytosanitary measures (SPS) 
and Plant Protection Unit will be moving from the existing laboratory building to a new building; 
however,  some  building  redesign  and  reorientation  is  required  to  satisfy  future  International 
Standards  Organization  (ISO)  17025  accreditation.  The  activities  will  include:  (i)  establishing 
genetically  modified  organism  (GMO),  plant  toxins,  bio-fertilizer  and  organic  fertilizer  testing 
capacity;  (ii)  supporting  ISO  17025  accreditation;  (iii) developing  tissue  culture  protocols  for 
banana  and  cassava;23  and  (iv)  assisting  the  laboratory  commercialization  process  to  achieve 
partial cost recovery. The project will supply analytical testing equipment for GMO analysis and 
bio-fertilizer  and  organic  fertilizer  testing,  the  supply  of  tissue  culture  equipment  and  materials 
that will include making the tissue culture laboratory aseptic and the supply of growth media, etc. 
and plantlet weaning facilities. Pesticide residue rapid test kits for field testing and desktop testing 
equipment  for  plant  toxins  will  also  be  supplied.  The  main  strategy  will  be  to  gain  ISO  17025 
accreditation for the range of tests supported by the project but also those tests in which NAL 
feels  confident  that  accreditation  can  be  achieved.  The  other  targets  are  for  PBL  to  generate 
revenue at least $75,000 per annum by year 6 and to license tissue culture technology to two 
companies.  On  matters  of  biosafety  and  biotechnology  policy  and  standards,  as  well  as 
upgradation of the laboratory infrastructure and capacity, biosafety experts from the Ministry of 
Environment (MOE) will be involved. 
Activity 1.5 Promoting renewable energy) biodigesters and use of solar energy in target 
13. 
cooperative areas) for value chain improvement includes (i) installation of at least 12,000 more 
biodigesters  in target  agricultural  cooperative  areas  by the  sixth year from  a  baseline figure  of 
11,468 units, benefitting 80,000 persons including 40,000 females; (ii) supporting the construction 
of  6,000  compost  huts,  to  process  bio-slurry;  and  (iii)  establish  a  national  framework  on  the 
biodigester quality (standard development) and harmonize biogas initiatives in a private sector 
friendly manner. As noted under Activity 1.2, the project will also promote the use of solar energy 
within  post-harvest  and processing units  at  cooperatives.  Likewise,  photovoltaic  energy  will  be 
used in the submersible pumps to supply water to the drip irrigation demonstration sites under 
activity 1.1. The quality of solar systems will be ensured through using certified companies and 
products. 
23 The laboratory is already working in developing Banana TC protocols. 
72 
Annex 1  
The target provinces are endowed with a relatively high animal population (860,000 cattle 
14. 
and 550,000 pigs) and represent around 27% of the total biodigester potential of whole Cambodia. 
The  National  Biodigester  Program  (NBP)  estimated  biodigester  potential  for  the  country  as  1 
million.  The  total  number  of  installed  biodigesters  under  NBP  reached  25,383  country-wide  in 
2016 (of which 2,835 in Kampong Cham, 34 in Tboung Khmum, 3,515 in Kampot and 4,101 in 
Takeo), far below the anticipated target and well beneath the country’s potential.24 The biodigester 
potential  has  been  estimated  at  268,000  units  in  the  four  target  provinces,  but  the  project  will 
support  only  12,000,  subject  to  meeting  strict  selection  criteria  such  as  counterpart  funds, 
memberships in agricultural cooperatives, etc. The project will improve health and productivity for 
40,000  women  due  to  better  household  air  quality  and  by  averting  648  additional  disabilities 
adjusted  life-years  and  14  less  premature  deaths.  Beneficiary  households  will  be  required  to 
provide cofinancing prior to the installation of the digesters. In line with the operational modalities 
of  the  NBP, the  project will  provide  a flat rate  subsidy  of  $150,  independent  of the  size  of  the 
biodigester. 
15. 
The project will promote bio-slurry management and storage, including the introduction of 
6,000  standardized  compost  huts  with  a  durable  roof  and  improved  user  training  on  slurry 
management. According to the NBP, a compost hut with brick wall and a long-lasting roof made 
of corrugated iron is relatively expensive and costs around $200. As this investment comes on 
top of the investment in a biodigester, most farmers will not be able to afford it. To alleviate some 
of  the  additional  investment,  it  is  proposed  to  provide  an  incentive  of  $100  per  standardized 
compost hut. It is expected that around 50% of the farmers will invest in such a compost hut, a 
significant increase compared to a baseline of 15%.  
The biodigesters are expected to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through three 
16. 
pathways: (i) substitution of non-renewable cooking and lighting fuel by a renewable fuel (biogas), 
(ii) reduction of methane emissions from manure by capturing and burning methane for thermal 
energy (cooking and lighting) and (iii) displacement of chemical fertilizers by bio-slurry. The design 
criteria  of biodigesters  include:  (i)  durability, reliability  and maintenance requirements;  (ii)  local 
availability of construction materials; (iii) appropriateness of the design for areas with high water 
tables; and (iv) costs. The selection criteria for households eligible for a biodigester include the 
following: 
(i) 
Commune  members  who  are  located  within  the  catchment  area  of  those 
agricultural cooperatives supported by the project; 
Households having at least 15 kg manure available daily and a maximum of 150 
kg per day; 
Commitment  to  adopt  climate  smart  and  good  agricultural  practices  such  as 
composting, mulching, organic agriculture, climate resilient varieties; 
Preference to female headed households and those committing to a realistic and 
technically viable O&M plan; 
Preference to households with presence of respiratory related illnesses due to air 
pollution or those households at risk that use biomass for cooking; 
Preference to households with capacity to contribute funds either by having own 
funds or taking loans; and 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
(v) 
(vi) 
(vii)  Commitment to use bio-slurry as a fertilizer substitute.  
17. 
The project will also advise agribusinesses to reduce energy costs and support those that 
are prepared to invest in solar energy through: (i) sponsoring feasibility studies on the potential 
24 Government of Cambodia. National Biodigester Program. http://nbp.org.kh/ProgrammeArea.aspx.  
Annex 1 
73 
for photo voltaic energy to reduce energy costs in the value chain; (ii) providing advice to at least 
10 agribusinesses that have the potential to reduce energy costs with photovoltaic energy; and 
(iii) linking of such agribusinesses with the green financing interventions.  
Output  2:  Climate  smart  agriculture  and  agribusiness  promoted.  Under  this  output 
18. 
three key  activities include  deployment  of  climate  resilient  varieties,  capacity  strengthening for 
climate smart agriculture (CSA), and promotion of farm mechanization. 
Activity 2.1 Deploying climate-resilient varieties. Yields of target crops grown currently in 
19. 
the four targeted provinces are adversely impacted by climate change. The project will support 
the  Cambodian  Agricultural  Research  and  Development  Institute  (CARDI)  to  trial  and  release 
climate  resilient  rice  and  maize  varieties  including  seed  production  and  multiplication,25  in 
cooperation with the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI). The varietal characteristics or 
traits  that  will  be  selected  will  include  tolerance  to  higher  temperatures,  drought,  prolonged 
submergence as well as the release of varieties with shorter cropping cycles. This will not be a 
basic plant breeding program which will take 10 years to develop. CARDI and IRRI already have 
over 200 climate resilient lines that can be trialed within a 5-year program that includes continued 
selection,  agro-climatic  adaptation,  climate  resilient  trait  evaluations,  yield  comparisons  and 
farmer and processor evaluation. The project will also support large scale seed multiplication of 
climate resilient varieties for each target crop in target provinces and distribution of quality seed 
to farmers. For example, new rice varieties suitable for direct seeding, and for alternate wetting 
and drying technologies will be demonstrated together with the full technology package on about 
100 hectares in each target province. The project will recommend standards for seed certification 
procedures for different grades of seed, and seed certification procedures for the approval of and 
implementation by the government. 
20. 
Technical  assistance  will  also  be  provided  to  CARDI  to  develop  a  commercialization 
program with recommendations on the legal framework to develop intellectual property rights and 
partial cost recovery for the institution. The expected results will be: (i) at least two climate resilient 
rice varieties released for commercial production and one climate resilient glutinous maize variety 
released for commercial production; and (ii) CARDI would be able to achieve partial cost recovery 
in  variety  development  and  foundation  seed  supply  with  the  corresponding  legal  framework  in 
place. 
Activity  2.2  Strengthening  capacity  in  climate  friendly  production  practices  and 
21. 
technologies.  Utilizing  some  of  the  infrastructure  developed  under  output  1,  the  project  will 
strengthen  capacity  of  farmers,  cooperatives  and  agribusinesses  on  CSA  and  climate  friendly 
practices. The lack of access to reliable extension services and the absence of climate information 
services prevent farmers from not only developing into professional agricultural cooperatives, but 
also from effectively coping with climate change. On the other hand, CSA, when combined with 
investments  in rural  infrastructure  and  inputs  offers  significant  potential  to  increase  yields to a 
profitable  and  sustainable  level.  For  example,  the  combination  of  sound  CSA  practices  with 
improved germplasm  has  the  potential to  increase  yields for  premium  aromatic  rice  to  4.5t/ha, 
aromatic rice 5.5t/ha and white rice 6t/ha, for maize 8-10t/ha and for cassava above 40t/ha, while 
CSA combined with drip irrigation in mangoes can increase yields by 30%.  
25  CARDI is the semi-autonomous government research agency responsible for increasing agricultural productivity, 
improving  crop  diversification  and  ensuring  environmental  sustainability  and  stability  of  rural  livelihoods  through 
agricultural research and technology utilization.  
74 
Annex 1  
Under this  activity,  the  project  will  support the deployment  of  a farmer-oriented training 
22. 
program  on  CSA,  reaching  at  least  40,000  farmers  (16,000  women),  focusing  on  the  rice, 
cassava,  maize  and  mango  value  chains.  The  project  will  train  youth,  landless  and  women. 
Farmers, FWUCs, agricultural cooperative boards and their members, and government officials 
from the Provincial Departments of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (PDAFFs) will receive both 
formal training and on-farm demonstrations on the following topics:  
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
CSA practices, including laser land levelling, alternate wetting and drying, sustainable 
agricultural waste management, rational use of inputs (water, energy, fertilizers, and 
pesticides),  agro-forestry  and  soil  cover  maintenance  techniques,  anti-erosive 
landscaping, and other practices leading to reduction of GHG emissions;  
Standards  compliance  such  as  CAMGAP  and  sustainable  rice  platform  (SRP).  The 
project will prepare training manuals and materials for SRP standards for sustainable 
rice cultivation, for CSA, and for CAMGAP for tropical fruit.  
Agricultural  cooperative  management  and  business  development  plans  including 
bookkeeping,  accounting  and  the  importance  of  access  to  crop  value  chains  and 
marketing;  
(iv)  Management  and  operation  of  provincial  agricultural  development  centers  and 
(v) 
mechanization workshops for government staff (see Activity 2.3); and 
Management,  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  of  irrigation  infrastructure,  drying 
and storage units for maize, rice and cassava as well as all other infrastructure. 
23. 
Building on experiences of ADB’s Climate Resilient Rice Commercialization project, and 
in collaboration with institutions such as IRRI, the project will support laser land levelling up to 
4,000 ha (approximately 1,000 ha per province) to improve water use efficiency and enhance crop 
yields in  selected  climate resilient  irrigation  and water  management  systems  supported  by  the 
project  under  output  1.  Besides  reducing  labor  costs  and  greenhouse  gas  emissions,  the 
technology is expected to reduce seed broadcasting application rates. The laser land levelling, 
including an orientation on basic tractor operation and laser leveling equipment troubleshooting, 
will also serve as a training exercise for potential service providers. 
24. 
The  project  will  conduct  “learning  by  doing”  training  by  demonstrating  and  training  in 
farmer fields in specific locations with three sites in each province. The farmer will be contracted 
to undertake CSA practices, which for rice will link into SRP procedures or CAMGAP in the case 
of mango production areas. CAMGAP on mangoes will be demonstrated on one of the three sites. 
If appropriate to CSA, some of the mechanization demonstration work will be cross-cutting with 
the  on-farmer  field  training  activities  of  farm  mechanization  particularly  in:  (i)  minimum  tillage; 
(ii) rice alternate wetting and drying; and (iii) post-harvest technology. Demonstrations in CSA can 
also be established on farmer fields that relate to soil improvement through crop rotation with such 
crops  as  mung  beans,  sesame,  millet,  cucurbits  and  or  green  manures.  The  SRP  Alliance  is 
planning to pilot SRP in Cambodia and the alliance needs to be encouraged to establish a pilot 
demonstration in at least in one of the four targeted provinces. Wherever possible, private sector 
service  providers  will  be  invited  to  undertake  training  programs,  particularly  in farm  machinery 
operation, operation and maintenance and equipment and tool fabrication, standards compliance, 
and accountancy and agribusiness. The expected results of this activity by 2025 will be as follows: 
16  certified  trainers  on  CSA  from  the  General  Directorate  of  Agriculture 
Department of Industrial Crops and Extension; 
40,000 farmers (at least 16,000 women) trained in CSA with productivity increases 
of at least 15%; 
20,000  farmers  (at  least  8,000  women)  trained  and  compliant  with  SRP,  which 
leads to direct paddy marketing links with SRP affiliated millers and traders;

improve water use efficiency; and 
At least 15 training workshops for government staff and farmers’ groups held on 
project  management,  and  agronomic  resource  efficiency,  climate  resilience  in 
value chains and agribusiness. 
Activity 2.3 Promoting farm mechanization and extension. The lack of access to reliable 
25. 
farm mechanization and extension services is a critical constraint in target provinces. The project 
will provide the training facilities at the provincial level by establishing four provincial agricultural 
development centers (PADCs) and four provincial agricultural engineering workshops so that they 
are fully operational to improve and create resource and training centers for service provision, 
agribusinesses and farmer value chain linkages. The project will finance the building of a PADC 
in Takeo, Tboung Khmum and Kampong Cham provinces and the rehabilitation of the existing 
extension/agricultural  development  center  in  Kampot.  Technical  assistance  will  be  provided  to 
manage  the  training  facility  and  undertake  a  needs  assessment  to  ensure  good  training  unit 
management  and  appropriate  procurement.  This  is  to  improve  the  formal  training  facilities  for 
provincial training and capacity building of CSA, Sustainable Rice Platform (SRP) and Cambodia 
Good Agricultural Practice (CAMGAP) standards, as well as agricultural cooperatives and FWUC 
accountancy,  bookkeeping  and  business  planning,  together  with  the  theory  of  agricultural 
machinery and equipment repair, operation and maintenance. Training and classroom equipment 
will also be provided.  
26. 
The project will support the construction of three farm mechanization workshops, including 
classrooms  in  Kampot,  Kampong  Cham  and  Tboung  Khmum  and  commissioning  the  new 
workshop  and  classroom  in  Takeo.  Technical  assistance  will  be  provided  for  agricultural 
engineering design and fabrication, repair, operation and maintenance. Equipment and tools for 
the repair and maintenance of agricultural production and processing equipment will be supplied. 
The  equipment  and  tools  for  the  manufacture  and  assembly  of  agricultural  production  and 
processing equipment, together with the supply of design, training and classroom equipment to 
the provincial workshop units will also be supplied. 
27. 
Output 3: Enabling environment for climate smart agri-business enhanced. Under 
this output, the project will invest in the creation of an enabling policy and regulatory environment 
for  agribusinesses,  the  identification  of  opportunities  for  private  sector  engagement  in  climate 
change mitigation and adaptation, and provision of improved climate information services to allow 
farmers to plan their cropping season. This output will include three key activities (i) formulating 
climate friendly agribusiness policies and standards; (ii) promoting green finance and risk sharing

through 
information  and 
Activity  3.1:  Formulating  climate  friendly  agribusiness  policies  and  standards.  In 
28. 
Cambodia,  there  is  a  need  for  agribusinesses  to  achieve  competitive  advantage,  to  realize 
economies  of  scale  and  continuity  of  supply,  and  to  break  into  new  markets.  To  facilitate 
competitiveness  and  growth  among  agri-businesses,  enabling  conditions  must  be  set.  For 
instance, MAFF and the Ministry of Commerce (MOC) have not yet developed a comprehensive 
policy for agribusiness and sought ADB support. Climate change needs to be mainstreamed into 
an agribusiness policy at national level with a view to developing a strong and dynamic market-
driven private agribusiness sector and a long-term agribusiness strategy with a climate-friendly 
vision.  Any  agribusiness  policy  would  provide  stability  in  the  sector  to  encourage  private 
investment (including “green” investment) and should fully integrate climate change concerns, to 
imprint  a  climate friendly  vision  for  businesses  in  the  sector.    The  policy  should  promote  both 
mitigation  and  adaptation  opportunities  and  socially  appropriate  best  practices.  The  project’s 
support to climate friendly agribusiness policy development will include:  
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
identification of measures to remove barriers for private sector investment in climate 
friendly agribusiness;  
identification of investment strategies for the public sector to enhance climate smart 
agribusiness growth;  
promotion  of  the  development  of  climate-friendly  infrastructure  so  that  Cambodia’s 
agribusinesses  have  a  comparative  and  competitive  advantage  with  their  regional 
counterparts; and  
creation  of  institutional  and  legal frameworks  conducive to  supporting  and  assisting 
climate friendly agribusiness, particularly with respect to regulations, taxes, business 
registration,  licenses  and  the  multiplicity  of  government  institutions  involved  in  the 
sector.  The  project  will  seek  to  identify  reforms  required  to  ease  freedom  to  do 
business  while  promoting  adequate  social,  environmental  and  climate-related 
standards, and to improve efficiencies in logistics and administration. 
29. 
In developing specific policy recommendations, the project will support MAFF to lead an 
inter-ministerial and development partner coordination mechanism, especially  with MOC, MRD 
and MOE among ministries, and International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), FAO, 
USAID and Australia’s DFAT among development partners. This coordination mechanism is to 
ensure synergies and avoid overlaps with other initiatives and contribute to policy harmonization 
across the government. The coordination mechanism will also ensure that various projects do not 
produce  different  guidelines  or  policy  tools  on  the  same  topics.  The  project  will  also  provide 
support  to  the  technical  working  group  on  climate  change  in  agriculture,  forestry  and  fisheries 
(TWG-CCAFF) to promote policies to facilitate the adoption of CSA. 
The climate smart agribusiness policy work will entail working with MAFF and MOC within 
30. 
the  framework  of  the  Industrial  Development  Policy  (IDP)  2015-2025,  particularly  to  conduct 
studies identifying priority products with processing potential and prepare a comprehensive action 
plan based on value chains to enable the government to provide concrete support to those sectors 
within the scope of the IDP. 
Climate-conscious agricultural product standards. Currently, the International Standards 
31. 
Organization (ISO) is developing ISO 14080 towards climate neutrality in different operations and 
ISO 26000 to consider climate change adaptation. The project will support developing at least 8 
climate-conscious standards for agribusiness operations aimed at climate neutrality and effective 
adaptation. The activities may be broadly divided into two categories: (i) for standards that have 
Annex 1 
77 
been drafted already, a technical review followed by public consultation is needed to determine 
impact for the eventual endorsement by the National Standard Council (NSC), in order that the 
standards can be national standard with the Cambodia Standard mark; and (ii) for the standards 
that are yet to be drafted, working groups will need to be formed to develop the first draft, followed 
by  technical  committees  for  the  review  of  the  drafts,  followed  by  public  consultation  with  the 
eventual endorsement by the NSC. For climate-conscious standards, most of the work may fall 
into category 2. For example, standards for climate-resilient post-harvest infrastructure facilities 
(e.g., storage, milling, processing) will need to be developed to guide the development of future 
infrastructure.  
32. 
The  project  will  support  activities  related  to  certification  and  compliance  that  concerns 
climate change issues and human health and welfare in line with corporate social responsibility 
(CSR) guidelines. It includes support to good agricultural practices (GAP) for mangoes to develop 
a CAMGAP standard for fair trade, organic production, tropical fruit, and support to the SRP. All 
standards are aimed at strengthening environmental protection and, for those compliant, enter in 
specific value chains demanding such standards. The CSR and SRP standards are expected to 
go further in ensuring worker health and safety as well as guaranteeing that there is no child or 
bonded labor, and ensuring workers have a living wage and an equitable share of the profits within 
the supply chain. The project will support a human resource development program for government 
staff to build capacity in policy and standards development and elaboration, and link with the work 
on regulatory impact assessment, already supported by ADB.27 The expected results of the sub-
output by 2024 will be as follows: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
(v) 
CSA policy drafted and reviewed by MOC and MAFF and jointly endorsed by both 
ministries; 
Guidance manuals for climate neutrality and adaptation standards for agribusiness 
operations developed; 
Climate-friendly  SRP  becomes  more  widely  utilized  with  eight  of  the  largest 
Cambodia millers/exporters being part of the Alliance;28 
CAMGAP for tropical fruit standard drafted and becomes a Cambodia Standard 
with Cambodia standard mark; and 
IDP strategies for climate friendly agribusiness developed. 
Activity  3.2  Promoting  green  finance  and  risk  sharing  mechanisms.  Private  sector 
33. 
participation in agribusiness value chains in Cambodia is currently low, due to a difficult business 
environment  in  the  target  provinces.    Linkages  between  producers  and  processers  or  traders 
remain weak.  There currently exists a framework for PPPs,  supported by ADB.  However, the 
current framework, legal and institutional setting, is not conducive to climate friendly investments. 
Furthermore,  there  are  no  adequate  risk-sharing  mechanisms  between  government,  local 
producers  and  the  private  sector,  meaning  that  smallholders  are  often  left  bearing  a 
disproportionate  amount  of  risk.  This  limits  innovation  and  the  potential  upscale  of  innovative 
climate friendly technologies. The project will make recommendations to fill these current gaps 
based on lessons learned and feasibility assessments from previous and ongoing projects, and 
to introduce innovative mechanisms that can be applied in the project sites.  
27 CREST Project – Regulatory Impact Assessment Subproject No. 38421-023. 
28 At present, only two Cambodian millers are part of the Alliance, which are not located in the project area of influence. 
Those that are in the project area of influence: Golden Daun Keo Mill, Cristal Rice Mill and Sek Meas Rice Mill will 
participate in the SRP scheme. 
78 
Annex 1  
The project will support in (i) creating an enabling environment for PPPs in agribusiness 
34. 
in  the  four  value  chains;  (ii)  the  identification  of  incentives  for  private  sector  participation  in 
agribusiness  particularly  improving  the  private  sector´s  access  to  green  finance  and  ways  to 
reduce  the  risk  aversion  of  commercial  banks;  and  (iii)  reducing  the  financial  risks  associated 
impacts climate change on the raw material base.  
35. 
To  achieve  the  PPP  objectives,  the  project  will  support  dialogues  between  public  and 
private sector stakeholders at the national level through convening an Inter-Ministerial Committee 
(IMC) and promote the establishment of crop centric PPP forums for each value chain (cassava, 
maize, and mango) both of which will meet twice a year.29 After each forum is held, the IMC would 
meet to review the crop forum points raised and to respond to the recommendations. The Project 
Manager will represent the PMU at each of the committee meetings and crop-centric forums. 
36. 
The  project  preparation  technical  assistance  (PPTA)  consultants  identified  eight  PPP 
projects within the value chains.30 The project will conduct detailed feasibility studies within the 
project implementation. Two study tours for selected representatives from the government will be 
conducted  during  the  fourth  year  of  project  implementation  to  learn  best  practices  and 
benchmarking of potential Cambodian PPP initiatives.   
37. 
To further encourage climate-friendly private sector engagement and to orient the market 
towards “greening” the value chains, the project will strengthen the capacity of financial institutions 
on green finance to devise and channel climate-friendly agribusiness investments. This will build 
on  the  Mekong  Sustainable  Finance  Working  Group  and  the  Micro-Finance  Institutions  (MFI) 
Client  Protection  Principle  to  help  Cambodian  financial  institutions  develop  environmental  and 
climate  screening  criteria  and  tools  to  guide  their  lending  activities.  Coordination  and  lessons 
sharing will also be pursued with the Association of Banks in Cambodia (ABC), which has recently 
launched the Cambodian Sustainable Finance Initiative (CSFI), an effort to develop sustainable 
finance  principles  and  announced  plans  to  work  towards  integrating  environmental  and  social 
safeguards  and lending standards  into their  business  decisions.  CSFI  is supported  by  USAID, 
Pact, Wildlife  Conservation Society (WCS)  and  Mekong Strategic  Partners,  in  partnership  with 
the National Bank of Cambodia and MOE. CSFI is aimed at developing and strengthening finance 
sector safeguards and risk management standards related to social and environmental impacts 
which are potentially created through the private sector. 
38. 
The  project  will  complement  CSFI  activities  by  providing  training  for  commercial  banks 
and microfinance institutions in targeted areas on (i) identification, benefits and opportunities of 
green  financing,  especially  through  environmental  and  climate  risk  screening  criteria;  (ii) 
awareness of green financing principles, operations and requirements; (iii) integration of green 
finance  criteria  into  credit  application  and  reporting  procedures;  and  (iv)  reporting  on  green 
finance.  This  training  is  expected  to  reduce  the  risk  aversion  of  commercial  banks,  while  also 
strengthening linkages, trust and shared understanding between lenders, borrowers, and input 
and services providers regarding climate friendly agribusiness investment opportunities. 
The project will seek to reduce risks associated with impacts of climate change, particularly 
39. 
for  smallholder  farmers,  through  creating  an  enabling  environment  for  climate  risk  sharing 
29 It is not necessary for a rice forum as the Cambodia Rice Federation can fulfill that role. 
30 The PPP initiatives identified were mango nursery development and seedling certification, the establishment of a 
Mango Producers Association, cassava chip storage, value added product development and sales, paddy cleaning, 
drying and storage, Mechanization workshop and resource center, seed multiplication and storage and the promotion 
of aromatic rice seed and licensing and establishing tissue culture enterprises.

mechanisms such as crop insurance under the guidance of inter-ministerial committee on crop 
insurance headed by the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF). Because penetration of crop 
insurance and other risk sharing instruments is extremely low, the project will first provide policy 
support by examining financial and regulatory constraints specific to target provinces and identify 
mechanisms to overcome such barriers.The project will build on the experiences of the Climate 
Resilient  Rice  Commercialization  project  which focuses  on  Battambang,  Kampong  Thom,  and 
Prey  Veng  provinces  and  the  work  of  the  Cambodian  Center  for  Study  and  Development  in 
Agriculture  (CEDAC)in  five  provinces,  including  Kampot  and  Takeo.  The  project  will  examine 
opportunities  to  expand  such  services  to  Kampong  Cham  and  Tboung  Khmum  and  consider 
including cassava and maize to rice as the portfolio of insurable crops.  
40. 
As part of the policy support on green finance and risk sharing mechanisms, the project 
may  explore  additional  opportunities  to  enhance  financial  sector  participation  in  agribusiness 
investments. The opportunities for establishing an agricultural supply chain adaptation facility, in 
which a partner financial institution (e.g., Rural Development Bank which is being encouraged to 
lend  to  cooperatives)  can  share  some  of  the  contract  farmers’  credit  risk  through  first-loss 
guarantee,  may  be  explored.31  Feasibility  of  climate  smart  lending  platform  and  value  chain 
financing options such as warehouse receipt financing scheme may  also be considered.32 The 
credit facility and guarantee scheme are expected to be available for only those projects that meet 
specific climate safe screening criteria which will be developed. It can also be made available for 
commercial  banks  when  lending  to  SMEs  meeting  those  same  criteria.  This  will  serve  two 
purposes, to provide: (i) a commercial incentive for banks to abide by the agreed best practice 
and climate change screening principles; and (ii) an extra degree of confidence for commercial 
banks  to  lend  to  the  underserved  SME  market,  provided  the  borrowers  meet  the  guaranty 
eligibility criteria. The technical assistance related to credit guarantee program may involve: (i) 
finalizing the design of the guarantee scheme with all key stakeholders (Cambodian banks and 
ADB, MFIs, and RDB) in such a way that the scheme remains simple to operate while offsetting 
against additional risks; and (ii) designing a guarantee training program for banks/MFIs and RDB 
to understand guarantee criteria and eligibility, usage, and administration.  
Activity 3.3 Supporting climate risk management through Information and Communication 
41. 
Technologies  (ICT).  To  support  the  enabling  environment  for  low-carbon  climate  resilient 
agricultural value chains, the project will strengthen capacity of local stakeholders to use improved 
ICT  and  agro-meteorological  services.  It  will  include  provision  of  training  to  MAFF  on  the 
formulation  and  dissemination  of  dynamic  or  updated  crop  calendars,  the  formulation  and 
distribution  of  advisories  for  slow-onset  climate  events  such  as  droughts,  improved  delivery  of 
seasonal climate forecasts, as well as early warnings for extreme rainfall events. The project will 
support the acquisition and collection of climate and crop data to support crop modeling, as well 
as the design of tools and guidelines for managing climate risks at farm and landscape levels. 
42. 
An ICT platform for CSA will be established in Kampong Cham province using innovative 
technologies  such  as  cloud  computing,  and  internet-of-things  solutions  on  a  pilot  basis.  The 
platform will facilitate adoption of more energy-efficient and water use efficient measures, climate 
friendly agriculture practices and farm credit services. The platform will have three modules: 
•  Module 1: Information advisory systems such as market information systems and weather 
information services; 
•  Module 2: Digital technologies for CSA practices; and 
•  Module 3: Information systems to monitor and manage climate risk management activities.

Annex 1  
43.  Module 1 will use the existing market information system and improve the organization of 
contents, modes of dissemination, enable price simulation and forecasting capabilities. Targeted 
information and additional data points will be introduced to add value to Kampong Cham farmers, 
traders,  rice  mills,  and  animal  feed  manufacturers.  Agrometeorological  capabilities  will  be 
introduced to deliver weather forecast and early warning messages to the farmers in the province. 
Module 2 will enable selected farms with Internet of Things (IoT) based capabilities that will collect 
information related to  soil  chemistry,  and  agriculture  inputs. The  data  collected  will  be  used to 
provide  advisory  information  to  farmers  to  improve  farm  productivity.  Module  3  will  introduce 
systemic  platforms  to  capture  climate  risk  management  services  such  as  emergency  aid 
disbursement activities and integrate digital payment methods. 
This  will  be  a  pilot  initiative  of  e-agriculture  components  such  as  agro-meteorological 
44. 
algorithms, upgrades to the existing market information system and capacity development that 
are  conceptually  applicable  to  all  provinces,  as  well  as  specific  components,  such  as  CSA 
practices and technologies, farm credit information systems and procedures and emergency fund 
disbursement systems. These will enable better planning of agribusiness activities, which in turn 
will lead to adoption of better farming practices that are climate friendly. Developing data collection 
and strengthening activities will support the sustainability of climate friendly actions of the project. 
B. 
Subproject Feasibility, Design and Approval Process 
45. 
For  all  subprojects,  the  national  feasibility  study  and  detailed  engineering  design 
consultants (package: CS5) will prepare the feasibility study for each subproject and will include 
a survey, technical specification criteria, social and gender safeguards, land compensation and 
resettlement,  environment  and  the  economic  feasibility.  The  studies  will  be  reviewed  by  the 
project implementation consulting firm (PIC, CS1) and if satisfactory will be passed onto the IA 
for further scrutiny, and through PMU submit to ADB for no-objection (for each of the first type of 
intervention), succeeding feasibility studies will be submitted to ADB and PSC for information). 
46. 
If unsatisfactory, the feasibility study will be returned to the “national feasibility study and 
detailed engineering design consultants” for revision. For subprojects included in the longlist from 
PPTA,  upon  receipt  of  ADB’s  no-objection  will  be  returned  to  PMU  for  preparation  of  detailed 
engineering design. All approved subprojects will be submitted to the project steering committee 
(PSC) for information. 
The review must confirm the eligibility of each subprojects based on the eligibility criteria 
47. 
defined in PAM. However, if there is justification for revision then the PMU can update the criteria 
with endorsement from PSC and ADB.  
In case a candidate subproject does not meet the above criteria, it will be replaced by the 
48. 
next  priority  candidate  subproject  from  that  respective  province  under  the  list  of  eligible 
subprojects identified during PPTA and refined during project implementation based on provincial 
priorities and recommendations from provincial technical specialists. If not listed subprojects are 
considered, they will be examined and screened by PMU supported by PIC and submitted to PSC 
for endorsement and to ADB for approval. 
49.  Once  the  feasibility  studies  have  been  approved,  the  CS5  consultants  will  prepare  the 
detailed engineering design. Detailed engineering design of subprojects will take due account of 
projected climate change impacts and incorporate design features that enhance resilience of the 
Annex 1 
81 
interventions,  as  appropriate.  The  provincial  line  agencies  will  assist  CS5  in  carrying  out  the 
necessary surveys and the relevant line agencies as well as the PIC will provide technical support 
to  CS5  consultants  as  required.  Provincial  technical  specialists  of  PPIUs  will  also  assist  in 
providing local knowledge and facilitate the feasibility. The detailed engineering designs will be 
reviewed by the relevant line agencies to ensure compliance with standards and regulations of 
the government. Once approved by the relevant technical line agencies, resettlement action will 
be initiated if required. The PIC will review the detailed engineering design to ensure compliance 
with  appropriate  standards  and  resettlement  as  well  as  the  environmental  management  plan 
(EMP). The PMU will review and approve the detailed engineering design and then initiate the 
bidding process.

department (NTD) of MOWRAM, MRD and MAFF with assistance from the PMU and the PIC will 
prepare bid documents following ICB or NCB procedures depending on the estimated value of 
the contracts. For irrigation subprojects, MOWRAM will prepare the bid documents; for AC drying 
and storage units GDA MAFF  will prepare the bid documents, as well as for on-farm irrigation 
systems and MRD for AC market connectivity. The bid documents will be prepared based on ADB 
standard format documents. The draft English language version of the procurement documents 
for the first ICB and NCB contracts will be submitted for ADB review and prior approval regardless 
of the estimated contract amount. ADB-approved procurement documents will be used as a model 
for all subsequent ICB and NCB procurement. The PIC will review the bidding documents before 
they are submitted to ADB for approval (Figure 2).

Infrastructure Operation and Maintenance Arrangements 
Infrastructure O&M is critical to ensuring its continued effectiveness and productivity, and 
54. 
improper or inadequate O&M arrangements can undermine the long-term utility of the investments 
and lead to more costly rehabilitation efforts. The root causes  of underperformance of O&M in 
Cambodia are insufficient funding, inadequate capacity, and inappropriate governance structures. 
The government’s manual on Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) requires that the EA/IA must 
determine  the  impact  of  the  project  on  its  annual  resources/budgets  for  O&M  and  how  these 
additional future costs will be covered by the Royal Government of Cambodia or EA to ensure 
sustainability.  SOP,  para  50  also  recommends  that  a  comprehensive  O&M  plan  must  be 
developed at an early stage of project development. MEF established an O&M budget of about 
$15 million per year for all types of infrastructure. The amount is limited, but the ministry plans to 
increase  O&M  budget  gradually.  The  project  aims  to  address  the  O&M  barriers  related  to 
governance, capacity, funding and technology as follows: 
55. 
Institutional arrangements. For each water management infrastructure sub-project, the 
PDWRAM will encourage FWUGs or FWUCs to establish O&M committees and prepare O&M 
plans. Likewise, each agricultural cooperative will be required to prepare a realistic and technically 
viable O&M plan for infrastructure related to renewable energy and post-harvest operations. The 
O&M plans will clearly define the roles and responsibilities of the different stakeholders, include 
a  schedule  of  routine  maintenance  activities,  initial  user  tariffs  (wherever  applicable),  and

collection mechanisms for at least the first few years after construction, as well as estimated O&M 
costs for the lifespan of the infrastructure. O&M plans will be updated and finalized on completion 
of the subproject and agreed upon. Formal links with PDAFF, PDWRAM, PDRD at provincial level 
and MAFF, MOWRAM and MRD will be established, with their roles and contributions to O&M 
included in the plans. The number of completed subprojects that have O&M plans in place, and 
the number of subprojects that are functional and used by communities a year after completion 
will also be monitored. The PMU staff will visit a sample of the subprojects after completion to 
evaluate  O&M.  The  project  will  also  have  a  mechanism  for  effective  complaints  handling  or 
grievance redress mechanism on O&M. 
56. 
Capacity  building.  As  part  of  output  2,  the  project  will  have  a  strong  focus  on  O&M 
learning.  O&M  training  will  be  provided  at  regular  intervals  to  FWUGs,  FWUCs,  agricultural 
cooperative  members,  biodigester  beneficiaries  and  other  stakeholders,  including  provincial 
government  authorities,  and,  where  appropriate,  small-scale  contractors  or  private  companies 
involved in O&M. The project will raise awareness of the need for O&M through several channels 
including  videos  and  distribute  simple  pictorial  manuals  or  user-friendly  guides  to  help 
communities  in  carrying  out  O&M  activities.  Capacity  building  will  also  include  communication 
materials and information campaigns to encourage appropriate behavior in support of O&M, such 
as proper use of infrastructure, fee payment, and so forth. Some efforts will also be devoted to 
enhancing organizational and managerial capacity of FWUC/FWUGs on O&M. The project will 
support  a  community  networking  strategy  -a  peer-to-peer  learning  initiative-  that  supports  the 
sharing  and  dissemination  of  best  practices  and  lessons  learned  on  O&M  and  will  facilitate 
integration,  business  relations  formation,  and  cross-fertilization  throughout.  Finally,  the  project 
budget includes post-construction training and technical support to O&M. The project design and 
monitoring framework (DMF) includes that at least 27 FWUCs will develop capacity to operate 
and maintain their irrigation schemes.  
57. 
Financing. The project budget covers short-term financing needs for routine O&M.  To 
the extent possible, O&M financing of irrigation subprojects would be partly covered by user fees 
from  FWUGs  or  FWUCs.  In  addition,  MOWRAM  will  seek  support  from  MEF’s  O&M  budget 
(currently  about  $15  million  annually).  The  Department  of  Agricultural  Cooperative  Promotion 
(DACP) of MAFF will also allocate limited O&M budget for cooperatives to be supported under 
the  project.  Farmers'  willingness  to  contribute  labor  or  cash  for  O&M  of  infrastructure  at 
agricultural cooperatives will also be a criterion for support. The project will establish appropriate 
incentives for O&M wherever feasible, by exploring public-private partnerships (PPPs) that can 
play in commercializing O&M efforts. Financial support for each major subproject will be made 
conditional on the set up and operationalization of relevant O&M arrangements. The subprojects 
that  provide  information  on  O&M  costs  and  responsibilities  will  be  prioritized  for  support.  The 
information may include: O&M costs to be financed (e.g., operations and minor repairs versus 
major repairs or capital costs), ways to finance O&M costs after subproject completion (e.g., water 
user  fees,  post-harvest  infrastructure  usage  fee),  and  responsibility  to  pay  for  O&M  (FWUCs, 
cooperative members and/or local government authorities). 
58. 
Technical  issues.  This  project  aims  to  rehabilitate  infrastructure  to  a  climate  resilient 
condition through good design, proper materials, and appropriate supervision. It is expected that 
such  infrastructure  will  have  lower  long-term  O&M  costs.  In  this  process,  the  best  practices 
learned from other ADB projects regarding design quality and construction will be followed. Efforts 
will be made to select appropriate design and technology, use local materials of required quality, 
and  provide  supervision  to  ensure  construction  is  in  accordance  with  the  specifications.  Such 
efforts will help optimize the trade-offs between the lifecycle costs (investment costs and O&M 
requirements)  and  the  scale  of  benefits  to  the  community.  For  biodigesters,  only  those 
Annex 1 
87 
biodigesters  meeting  national  biodigester  standards  will  be  commissioned.  The  project 
implementation consultants (PIC, package CS1) will assess alternative technical solutions and 
inform communities of associated lifecycle costs, including future O&M costs. The following table

Cambodia  is  one  of  the  most  vulnerable  countries  in  the  world  to  climate  change. 
Agriculture  sector  is  one  of  the  most  vulnerable  sectors  to  such  impacts.  The  climate  change 
events reflected in terms of increased frequencies of temperature extremes, frequent droughts, 
floods,  and  increased  salinity  have  already  started  affecting  agricultural  production  and 
productivity and particularly more so in marginal or low input environments like Cambodia. 
The  climate  friendly  agribusiness  value  chains  sector  project  aims  to  support  the 
92. 
Cambodian  Agricultural  Research  and  Development  Institute  (CARDI)  in  production  and 
multiplication  of  climate  resilient  varieties  of  rice,  maize,  cassava  and  mango.  In  addition, 
assistance  will  be  provided 
to  develop  a  commercialization  program  with 
recommendations on the legal framework to develop intellectual property rights and partial cost 
recovery for the institution.  
to  CARDI 
93. 
The  climate  resilient  traits  to  be  selected  in  new varieties shall  include shorter maturity 
duration,  tolerance  to  drought,  tolerance  to  high  temperature,  tolerance  to  prolonged  flooding, 
anaerobic germination, as well as traits supporting better adaptation to water saving cultivation 
practices-  dry  direct  seeding  and  alternate  wetting  and  drying.  This  will  not  be  a  basic  plant 
breeding  program  which  will  take  10  years  to  develop.  Instead,  the  focus  would  be  on  testing 
available climate resilient lines within a 5-year program that includes continued selection, agro-
climatic adaptation, climate resilient trait evaluations, yield comparisons and farmer and processor 
evaluation.  Ensuring  the  availability  of  quality  seed  of  climate  resilient  varieties  in  adequate 
quantity at right time poses greater challenge rather than production per se. 
94. 
The project will also support large scale seed multiplication of climate resilient varieties for 
each target crop in target provinces and distribution of quality seed to farmers. For example, new 
rice varieties suitable for direct seeding, and for alternate wetting and drying technologies will be 
demonstrated  together  with  the  full  technology  package  on  about  100 hectares  in  each  target 
province.  The  project  will  recommend  standards  for  seed  certification  procedures  for  different 
grades of seed, and seed certification procedures for the approval of and implementation by the 
government. 
95. 
By  2024,  it  is  expected  that  at  least  two  climate resilient  rice varieties and one climate 
resilient glutinous maize variety would be released for commercial production;  and that CARDI 
would be able to achieve partial cost recovery in variety development and foundation seed supply 
with the corresponding legal framework in place. The project will develop seed quality standards, 
seed certification standards for different classes of seeds for the four crops and maintain such 
standards in the quality seed production in the current project.   
The  scope  of  work  also  covers  the  development  and  dissemination  of  climate  smart 
96. 
agriculture  (CSA)  practices  including  improved  land-water-nutrient  management  and  crop 
establishment practices. The work includes dissemination of mechanized cultivation practices that 
have  reduced  risk  and  drudgery  and generate  avenues  for  employment  for  youth  and  women 
farmers. The project will work closely with CARDI and other key institutions as well as private-
sector  partners for the  deployment  of the  climate  resilient  varieties and technology  of  different 
Annex 2 
127 
crops.  In  addition,  the  work  includes  efforts  to  reduce  postharvest  losses  during  harvesting, 
drying,  storage,  and processing through  implementation of  modernized  post-harvest  practices, 
capacity development and training on postharvest technology, and the development of linkages 
between the public and private sector. 
97. 
An international research institution of high repute will be recruited to deliver the above 
services. Based on assessment of various institutions in the region focusing on development and 
deployment  of  climate  resilient  varieties,  and  substantial  contributions  made  so  far  on  climate 
smart agriculture in various countries including Cambodia, it is proposed to select the International 
Rice Research Institute (IRRI) to deliver the above services.  The detailed terms of reference will 
be developed by CARDI with cooperation from the project implementation consultants during the 
first year of project implementation after assessing needs of target crops in target provinces.  
98. 
IRRI  has  been  working  with  Cambodia  since  1986  and  on  crops  and  climate  change 
research  since  1991  –  a  time  when  climate  change  was  considered  a  marginal  topic  within 
agriculture research. The Institute has defined a coherent research portfolio on climate change 
emphasizing on three areas: adaptation, mitigation, and policy. This sets crop production into the 
broader context of food supply and food security alongside socioeconomic issues, such as rural 
development  and  gender  mainstreaming.  IRRI  also  maintains  solid  working  relationships  with 
other  international  crop research  institutes  belonging to the  Consultative Group  on  Agricultural 
Research (CGIAR) and has agreed to deliver their solutions to Cambodia in a seamless manner.   
99. 
Currently, Cambodia and IRRI are conducting joint research projects on climate change 
adaptation and mitigation, climate-resilient rice varieties, remote sensing-based crop monitoring, 
improvement of farmers’ livelihoods, and postharvest technology. Many Cambodian researchers 
are also benefiting from IRRI’s training  and  capacity-building  activities.  Some  achievements  of 
IRRI in relation to the development of climate resilient varieties are listed below: 
100.  Flood  tolerance:  The  erratic floods  experienced  in  rainfed  and  flood-affected  areas  are 
usually  caused  by  heavy  rainfall,  overflow  of  nearby  rivers  and  canals  or  sometimes  tidal 
movements as in coastal areas. These floods cause serious problems for rice and other crops 
because  of  the  poor  or  non-existent  drainage  and,  in  some  cases,  the  topography  of  the  land 
prevents  fast  water  movement  to  drain  flooded  fields.  Through  conventional  breeding,  IRRI 
developed a rice variety that can withstand being submerged under water for two weeks. After 
the gene (called SUB1 gene) was found, it was infused into popularly grown rice varieties in rice-
growing countries in Asia. Scuba rice is spreading fast in several countries over the last few years 
and are currently grown by more than 5 million farmers in Asia.  
101.  Drought  tolerance:  Drought  is  the most  widespread and  damaging  of  all  environmental 
stresses, affecting 23 million hectares of rainfed rice in South and Southeast Asia. IRRI scientists 
have identified several key regions of the rice genome that give the rice drought tolerance and 
improve rice grain yield under drought. IRRI is working towards introducing drought tolerance into 
popular high-yielding rice varieties. By using drought-tolerant rice, farmers can enjoy 0.8-1.2 tons 
per hectare yield advantage than non-drought-tolerant varieties. This yield advantage will make 
the drought prone areas of target provinces in Cambodia to be much more productive, contributing 
to food security in poor rural communities. 
102.  Some achievements of IRRI on climate smart agriculture techniques are listed below: 
128 
Annex 2  
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
(v) 
Climate smart water management: IRRI has developed the alternate wetting and 
drying technology (AWD) or intermittent irrigation of the rice field as an effective 
water-saving measure.  It  reduces  water  consumption  in  paddy  rice  by  30%  and 
consequently,  reduces  the  cost  of  pumping  water.  Additionally,  AWD  helps 
mitigate emissions of methane—a greenhouse gas—in rice production by 50%.  
Laser  leveling:  In  1998,  IRRI  piloted  laser-assisted  land  leveling  in  Cambodia 
under CIAP. By year 2000, around 200 fields had been leveled to demonstrate the 
technology.  In  2012,  the  ADB-funded  IRRI  postharvest  project  reintroduced  the 
technology and, to date, eight units are in use around the country. 
Nutrient management: Fertilizer often represents the highest input cost for farmers 
after labor, accounting for about 20% of the total cost of production. Soil nutrient 
knowledge can guide the development of practical tools to help farmers increase 
rice production and reduce costs through smart nutrient management. Importantly, 
the work shows that when fertilizer is used appropriately, yield can boost without 
negative impact on soil health.  
Pest  management:  Through  a  collaborative  research  network  with  national 
scientists in Asia, IRRI and ADB initiated the Rice Planthopper Project. It promotes 
ecological  engineering  as  a  management  strategy  to  build  ecological  diversity 
which strengthens the rice field’s natural capacity to cope with pests. 
Postharvest  management:  From  2005  to  2008,  IRRI  and  MAFF  pilot  tested 
postharvest  technologies  such  as  airtight  storage  systems;  improvements  in 
farmer granaries and grain quality assessment kits; and methods for improving rice 
mills and providing rice market information in 8 villages in Battambang and Prey 
Veng.  IRRI  also  helped  introduce  combine  harvesters  and  flatbed  dryers  in 
Cambodia. In 2009-2013,  ADB funded  the  pilot testing  and  out  scaling of  these 
technologies in six provinces. By the end of 2013, about 200 flatbed dryers have 
been installed by the private sector, about 5,000 combine harvesters were in use, 
and  the  supply  chain  for  airtight  storage  systems  has  been  established. 
Recommendations developed by the ADB-supported project have been included 
in the Cambodia Rice Strategy. 
In view of the wide-ranging achievements in development of climate resilient varieties and 
103. 
dissemination of climate smart agricultural practices and technologies to various countries, and 
in recognition of outstanding contributions to the Cambodian research institutions, IRRI is ideally 
placed  to  provide  its  services  under  this  package  in  a  comprehensive  manner.  The  estimated

Package CS4: Information Communication Technology Platform 
104.  General  scope  of  work.  Information  and  Communication  Technology  (ICT)  based 
solutions will be piloted in the Kampong Cham province of Cambodia. The pilot will establish ICT 
platforms to support climate risk management components of the Agribusiness project based on 
a feasibility study completed during 2017. Among the pilots identified, the following were chosen 
for implementation. 
Module 1: Information advisory systems such as market information systems and weather 
information services; 
Module  2:  Digital  technologies  for  climate  smart  agriculture  practices  that  support 
precision farming activities; and 
Module 3: Information systems to monitor and manage climate risk management activities. 
105.  Module 1 will provide information advisory services related to market information. It will 
use the existing market information system and improve the organization of contents, modes of 
dissemination,  enable  price  simulation  and  forecasting  capabilities.  Targeted  information  and 
additional data points will be introduced to add value to Kampong Cham farmers, traders, rice 
mills, and animal feed manufacturers. Further, agrometeorological capabilities will be introduced 
to deliver weather forecast and early warning messages to the farmers in the province. Module 2 
will develop model farms in the province. These farms will be enabled with Internet of Things (IoT) 
based capabilities that will collect information related to soil chemistry, and agriculture inputs. The 
data collected will be used to provide advisory information to farmers to improve farm productivity. 
Module 3 will introduce systemic platforms to capture climate risk management services such as 
emergency aid disbursement activities and integrate digital payment methods.  
106.  The  ICT  components  involve  software  development,  ICT  infrastructure  (hardware)  and 
communication services, policy and data exchange standards development, training and support 
services, and equipment. The project will be implemented through engaging system integrators 
and using service-oriented architecture such as cloud technology solutions. A firm will be used 
for  developing  detailed 
requirements,  developing  equipment 
specifications, selecting the system integrators, and overseeing implementation.

Package CS5: Feasibility Studies and Detailed Engineering Design Consulting 
Firm (FSDD) 
a. 
b. 
Feasibility Studies and Detailed Engineering Design for Irrigation 
Feasibility Studies and Detailed Engineering Design for Rural Roads 
115.  Scope of work. The consultancy firm for the feasibility studies and detailed engineering 
design  (FSDD)  will  assist  the  project  management  unit  (PMU),  and  the  provincial  project 
implementation units (PPIU) in the preparation of feasibility study and detailed engineering design 
of  each  subprojects.  The  project  implementation  consultants  (PIC-CS1)  will  review  FSDD  in 
coordination with MOWRAM / MRD prior to submission to ADB. 
116.  To ensure that the subprojects are designed in a logical and efficient manner, these will 
be grouped and packaged. The FSDD firm will start feasibility study and design work on a package 
by package basis and will allocate resources as required for these to be completed. Given the 
time needed to undertake feasibility studies and detailed engineering design for each package, 
as well as preparing tender documents (approximately six months), packages will likely have to 
be undertaken one after the other. However, there may be some overlap depending on the speed 
and resources of the FSDD firm. It is recommended that grouping of packages will be done based 
on location (with subprojects grouped according to province to the extent possible), as well as 
total  estimated  works  contract  size.  Viable  subprojects  will  then  be  approved  by  the  Project 
Steering  Committee  (PSC)  after  submission  and  following  recommendations  from  PMU. 
Prioritizing of the subprojects within each province should be agreed upon in consultation with 
PPIU and local authorities. 
I. 
FOR IRRIGATION SUBPROJECTS 
117.  Activities shall include, but not be limited to the following: 
Step  1.  Reconnaissance  and  feasibility.  The  contractor  needs  to  determine  that  the 
subproject is technically, environmentally, socially and economically feasible: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
Detailed field surveys and analysis will be undertaken to determine that the sub-
project:  (a)    is  pro-poor  (i.e.  benefits  will  mainly  accrue  to  poor  farming 
households); (b) for irrigation projects, there is demonstrated water availability in 
sufficient quantity and quality to ensure the intended benefits of the project can be 
achieved;  (c)  works  are  technically  feasible;  (d)  has  demonstrated  commitment 
from local government authorities; (e) has commitment from cooperatives and or 
water users to operate and maintain structures post project and to distribute water 
and  resources  in  an  equitable  manner;  and  (f)    is  economically  feasible  (EIRR 
>12%).  For  estimation  of  EIRR,  farm  budgets  will  need  to  be  estimated.  The 
methodology used during project preparation for the representative subproject can 
be used. 
Hold  meetings  and  discussions  with  community  groups,  commune  leaders  and 
potential cooperatives and water users, to understand the issues and expectation 
of local people. 
Socioeconomic  data  will  be  collected  on  each  subproject  site.  If  required,  land 
acquisition  and  resettlement  plans  (LARPs),  initial  environmental  examination 
(IEEs) and environment management plans (EMP) will be prepared. These should 
follow  the  project’s  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  framework  (LARF)  and 
134 
Annex 2  
environment  assessment  and  review  framework  (EARF).  Due  diligence  report 
(DDR) and IEE for the representative subprojects were prepared in PPTA stage

and water users; 
Take  due  account  of  projected  climate  change  impacts  and  incorporate  design 
features that enhance resilience; 
Existing  design  procedures  practice  under  national  standards  will  be  used. 
However,  where  innovative  climate  resilient  improvements  can  be  used,  FSDD 
consultants  will  incorporate  such  innovations  in  the  design  providing  sufficient 
justification for such additional costs, structures or practices can be proven. 
Update LARP, DDR, IEE, EMP and environmental code of conduct as necessary 
upon finalization of design. 
Submit  to  PIC  for  review  with  relevant  line  agencies  to  ensure  compliance  with 
standards and regulations of the government.

The project will rehabilitate water management infrastructure through de-silting works and 
upgrading design standards to withstand climate variability and projected climate changes and 
install drip irrigation systems to improve yields and deliver exportable mango fruit. The project will 
support construction of climate-proofed post-harvest units for cleaning, drying and storage at farm 
cooperatives. It will improve climate resilience of farm to market roads through measures such as 
increasing height of embankments, promoting cross drainage and selecting permeable materials. 
4. 
Output 2: Climate smart agriculture and agribusiness promoted. Key activities under 
this  output  include (i)  deploying  climate  resilient varieties;  (ii)  strengthening  capacity  in  climate 
friendly  production  practices  and  technologies;  and  (iii)  promoting  farm  mechanization  and 
extension.  The  project  will  support  the  Cambodian  Agricultural  Research  and  Development 
Institute  to  produce,  multiply  and  distribute  climate  resilient  varieties  of  rice  and  maize  and  to 
improve weaning and acclimatization of mango and cassava germplasm. The project will train at 
least 40,000 farmers (16,000 women) on climate smart agriculture practices. It will demonstrate 
laser land levelling to improve water use efficiency and enhance capacity of farmer water user 
groups to operate and manage irrigation schemes. The project will construct and upgrade four 
farm mechanization workshops and four agribusiness training facilities to train farmer water user 
in  operation  and 
communities,  women

Output  3:  Enabling  environment  for  climate  friendly  agribusiness  enhanced.  The 
project will assist the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) and the Ministry of 
Commerce  in  creating  an  appropriate  enabling  policy  environment  for  agribusinesses.  Key 
activities  include:  (i)  formulating  climate  friendly  agribusiness  policies  and  standards;  (ii) 
promoting  green  finance  and  risk  sharing  mechanisms;  and  (iii)  supporting  climate  risk 
management  through  information  and  communication  technologies.  The  project  will  provide 
support for agricultural product certification, quality and resilience standards, including Cambodia 
Good Agricultural Practice (CAMGAP) and organic fertilizer standards. The project will support 
Annex 3 
143 
cooperatives in becoming sustainable agribusiness ventures by linking up with the private sector 
and  by  establishing  crop-centric  public  private  partnership  forums  for  each  commodity  value 
chain. The project will raise financial institutions’ awareness on green finance and integration of 
environmental and climate risk screening criteria into credit application and reporting procedures. 
Using information and communication technologies, the project will provide weather, market and 
agronomic information with a view to create an enabling environment for more effective climate 
risk management. 
Project  Area of Influence. In line with the principle of promoting regional cooperation, 
6. 
integration, and trade, the proposed project will focus on strengthening agribusiness value chains 
in Kampong Cham and Tboung Khmum provinces along the GMS southern economic corridor 
and Kampot and Takeo provinces along the GMS southern coastal economic corridor. 
7. 
Project Costing. The project cost is estimated at $141.04 million. (i) ADB will provide $90 
million in loan (ii) $40 million from GCF ($10 million loan and $30 million grant), (iii) $ 3.66 million 
from beneficiaries and (iv) $7.38 million from the Government of Cambodia. Both (iii) and (iv) can 
be in cash or in-kind.  
8. 
Project Implementation Arrangements. The national level coordination will be provided 
by a Project Steering Committee (PSC) which will be chaired by MAFF (Secretary of State), vice 
chaired  by  the  Ministry  of  Economy  and  Finance  (MEF)  with  representatives  from  MOWRAM, 
Ministry  of  Industry  and  Handicraft  (MIH),  Ministry  of  Rural  Development  (MRD),  Ministry  of 
Environment (MOE) and Ministry of Commerce (MOC). In order that decisions are made quickly, 
it  is  recommended  that  the  various  steering  committee  members  will  be  at  least  the  rank  of 
Director General. 
9. 
MAFF  will  be  the  executing  agency  (EA)  and  will  be  responsible  for  overall  project 
management,  coordination  and  reporting  and  will  host  the  PMU.  The  PMU  will  have  the 
responsibility for the day to day management, coordination and supervision of the project, as well 
as  consultant  recruitment,  financing  and  fund  flow,  and  the  oversight  of  safeguard  issues  and 
measures. The PMU organization will house the project implementation consultants (PIC) and will 
have  a  full-time  project  manager  and  staff  with  responsibilities  for  finance,  procurement, 
safeguards and monitoring and evaluation.  
10. 
Specific  MAFF  implementation  departments  will  include  those  within  the  General 
Directorate  of  Agriculture  (GDA):  National  Agricultural  Laboratory,  Department  of  Agricultural 
Engineering  (DAEng),  and  Department  of  Agricultural  Cooperative  Promotion  (DACP).  The 
General Directorate of Animal Health and Production (GDAHP) will have a role at central level. 
Support from GDA departments such as the Department of Rice, Department of Industrial Crops 
and Department of Agroindustry will also be critical. All these departments will serve as resource 
providers  to  the  provincial  activities,  primarily  within  the  remit  of  PDAFF  sub-output 
responsibilities. 
11. 
Although MAFF is the EA for the project, land acquisition and resettlement is mandated to 
the  Inter-Ministerial  Resettlement  Committee/General  Department  of  Resettlement  (IRC/GDR) 
except for the preparation of LARF during the feasibility study. IRC has the mandate to review 
and  evaluate  the  resettlement  impact  and  land  acquisition  for  public  physical  infrastructure 
development projects in the Kingdom of Cambodia. IRC is a collective entity, permanently chaired 
and led by MEF, with members from different line ministries. IRC will carry out its roles through a 
Working Group (IRC-WG) which will be established by MEF for this project.  IRC is the approving 
authority for all RFs, RPs and DRPs prior to submission to the ADB for its approval.  The General 
144 
Annex 3  
Department  of  Resettlement  (GDR)  is  the  permanent  Secretariat  of  the  IRC  and  the  General 
Department of the MEF and is the lead agency for the preparation, implementation, monitoring 
and reporting of land acquisition and resettlement. GDR will be responsible for all land acquisition 
and  resettlement  activities,  including  grievance  redress  mechanism  (maintenance  of  the 
Grievance  Database,  update  and  reporting)  and  preparing  LARP  Compliance  report  upon 
completing compensation payment/RP implementation for this project. 
12. 
The IRC-WG will carry out the day to day land acquisition and resettlement activities under 
the project and led by the Deputy Director/Chief of the GDR and comprise of technical staff from 
PMU, GDR, the Ministry of Land Management, Urban Planning and Construction. The IRC-WG 
will  be  responsible  for  all  the  field  work  under  the  supervision  of  the  Director  of  the  GDR  and 
overall guidance and direction of the Director General of the GDR 
CARDI and IRRI will be responsible for the climate resilient variety development activities, 
13. 
but field demonstrations and trials will include full coordination with the PDAFF. 
14.  MOWRAM and MRD will be represented in PMU which will be staffed by project director, 
civil or irrigation engineers, financial officer, procurement officer and administrative officer, that 
can  provide  and  coordinate  national  technical  department  (NTD)  as  well  as  financial  and 
procurement  activities  and  have  a  central  level  coordinating  role.  The  PMU  will  provide  the 
necessary technical expertise relevant to that ministry’s activities within the scope of the project.  
15. 
A PPP Inter-Ministerial Committee (IMC) will be formed and chaired by MEF and will have 
a maximum ten representatives purely to review potential PPP agribusiness projects and will meet 
once every two months. The private sector related to the value chains will have an input though 
the business forums, federations and associations that will provide feedback and information to 
the  proposed  PPP  IMC  and  on  to  the  steering  committee.  The  forums,  federations  and 
associations can circumvent the IMC for non-PPP initiatives. 
16. 
The  climate  smart  agribusiness  policy  activity  will  be  led  by  the  working  group  that 
comprises representatives from the MAFF, MEF, MOC, MIH and MOE. As MEF is the EA of the 
ADB  Rice  Commercialization  project  which  has  sponsored  a  feasibility  study  on  how  best  to 
approach  and  implement  crop  insurance  activities,  MEF  will  provide  assistance  to  the  crop 
insurance initiative and green financing. MEF is also working on and being supported by ADB on 
PPP initiatives. 
Provincial technical support will be provided by the provincial project implementation units 
17. 
(PPIU)  in  each  of  the  four  provinces.  The  PPIU  will  be  led  by  PDAFF  Director  and  will  be 
supported by the Deputy Directors of PDWRAM and PDRD, as well as officers in PDAFF related 
to Cooperative support and Provincial Agricultural Extension and GDAHP being responsible for 
all activities related to biodigesters and bio-slurry activities. Administration support and drivers will 
also complement the PPIU.

Data Management. The  process  of  data  management  consists  of  data  collection,  data 
communication, analysis and reporting.   Data will be collected on all the indicators defined in the 
DMF by PIC, PMU and the implementing agencies. It shall be reported to the M&E officer of the 
PMU which will be supported by the PMU Project Manager and the relevant PIC team members 
particularly  those  that  relate  to  management,  procurement  and  infrastructure/subproject 
implementation.  This  will  include  data  on  water  management  and  irrigation  infrastructure, 
cooperative agribusiness development and value chain linkages. Human resource development 
is  important  to  record;  the  capacity  of  government  officers  to  support  the  project,  gender 
mainstreaming,  the  operation  and  management  of  cooperatives  FWUCs  and  their  training 
absorption capacity.   
24. 
The PIC, PMU, MRD and PDWRAM will compile the information in respect of the individual 
subprojects carried out by the project and the PMU will collate the data after having ensured the 
necessary  details  and  data  are  relevant  to  verify  performance  to  evaluate  the  output  of  the 
activities.  The PMU will subsequently update the PPMS with support of PIC. 
25. 
Data on indicators related to off farm water management and FWUC capacity building will 
be  the  responsibility  of  MOWRAM;  rural  roads  of  MRD  and  on-farm  irrigation  and  cooperative 
storage  unit  development  of  MAFF.  All  concerned  ministries  will  monitor  gender,  social 
safeguards and development and the capacity building activities linked to the project activities.  
The PPIUs will play an important role in the collection of data during the subproject implementation 
process and capacity building activities
