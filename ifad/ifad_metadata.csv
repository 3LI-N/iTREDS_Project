Coffee is part of the “basic food basket” (household consumption); the country must import increasing quantities to cover domestic demand, while only exporting small volumes of high-quality coffee. Cocoa is not part of the basket: its trade deficit is lower, and the time when its export potential will be reached is apparently closer.
Through PRODECAFE, its third project in Cuba, IFAD can play an important role in supporting the Government's efforts to modernize and achieve sustainable growth of the country’s agroforestry sector, by increasing the physical, human, social and environmental assets in the cooperatives as the most important actors in the country’s agricultural economy.

2000001060,Ongoing,Chad,,2018,,96.65,62.9,,No report,|Chad is both a least-developed country and a low-income food-deficit country. It faces recurring droughts combined with poor (rainfed) farming practices that are highly vulnerable to climate change. Falling oil prices have also contributed to the decline of economic growth. However, the country’s agricultural sector, although underperforming, offers real development opportunities for smallholder farmers, the principal agricultural producers.
The Strengthening Productivity and Resilience of Agropastoral Family Farms Project (known as RePER) supports the Government of Chad’s National Development Plan in its efforts to modernize the agricultural sector, diversify the country's economy and improve the quality of life. It seeks to tap into the country's agricultural potential by promoting improvements in productivity that support food security, nutrition and resilience, while also fostering the development of emerging agropastoral value chains.
Among the activities aimed at sustainably increasing food and nutrition security and raising the income of rural households, the project will strengthen agricultural water infrastructure, rehabilitate rural roads, intensify and diversify family farming production systems, and support value addition for agropastoral products.
RePER will be implemented in Chad's Sahel region, mainly in the Batha, Chari Baguirmi, Guéra, Hadjer Lamis, and Salamat regions. It will complement the activities of the ongoing Project to Improve the Resilience of Agricultural Systems in Chad as well as extend activities to four new administrative areas. It is estimated that 146,000 households will benefit from RePER.

Many of them are smallholder farmers who typically cultivate traditional crops. These farmers face several significant challenges to improving their incomes and job opportunities, including remoteness, poor community infrastructure and limited access to productive assets, markets, and financial resources.
This programme will support increasing poor smallholder farmers' incomes by helping them access finance and new markets, develop agribusinesses, and participate in value chains. The overarching aim of the programme is to reduce rural poverty by strengthening local economies and providing incentives for cooperatives and agroenterprises to integrate poor smallholders into their supply chains.
The programme will directly benefit 198,847 people in Cangxi, Xuanhan, Guang’an, Xuzhou and Yilong counties in the Qinba Mountains in Sichuan Province and Pengyang, Yuanzhou, Sunjiatan, Hongsipu and Xingqing counties in the Liupanshui Mountains in Ningxia Province.
The programme includes several innovative strategies, including connecting smallholder farmers to e-commerce and supermarkets and promoting new benefit-sharing mechanisms between agroenterprises and poor farmers. Because it will operate in two different provinces, the programme will be able to test the viability of these innovative methods across varied contexts and assess the potential for replicating them at a larger scale.

The humanitarian and security crisis of 2013-2015, coupled with ongoing conflicts, have had a devastating effect on the economy, impacting food security and increasing the country’s fragility. As a result, poverty currently affects about 67 per cent of the entire population.
In addition to the effects of these conflicts, the main causes of poverty include the underperforming agropastoral sector; the lack of roads, infrastructure and public services in rural areas; vulnerability to climate change, floods and droughts; as well as scarce economic opportunities, especially for young people.
The Project to Revitalize Crop and Livestock Production in the Savannah (PREPAS) will target 30,000 vulnerable households of agricultural producers in the subprefectures of Baoro, Bossemptélé, Bouar and Yaloké, with possible expansion to Bozoum after the project’s midterm review. At least 50 per cent of the participants will be women, 30 per cent young people and 10 per cent heads of the most vulnerable households.
The project aims to strengthen the production, processing and marketing of maize, cassava, groundnut, red beans, poultry, goats, sheep and pigs. It will promote sustainable practices that help famers adapt to climate change, particularly to droughts and floods. Household members will receive training in good dietary practices, nutrition and hygiene. The availability of highly nutritious foods will be increased. In an effort to reduce tensions and promote long-term sustainability, the project will also focus on encouraging dialogue between livestock producers and farmers growing crops. 
In addition, the project will establish 800 agricultural, agropastoral and market-gardening groups while developing market gardens equipped with solar-powered irrigation devices.

Haiti's rural population suffers from a vicious cycle of low agricultural productivity, high environmental degradation and poor nutrition. The project aims to break this cycle and help smallholder farming families improve their productivity, food security and income levels. To address these challenges, PITAG will equip Haitian smallholder farmers with agricultural technologies and practices that are well suited to local conditions.
In recent decades, the Caribbean island has seen its soils, water reservoirs and woods severely degraded. PITAG will enable smallholder farmers to produce more and better while taking care of the environment – something desperately needed in a country that is both one of the world’s poorest and one of the most greatly impacted by climate change.
IFAD’s contribution to the project, which started with support from the Inter-American Development Bank and the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program, will allow PITAG to expand its outreach into eight additional “communes” (municipalities) in the South Department, an area badly damaged by Hurricane Matthew.
PITAG takes a people-centred approach, with a strong focus on community involvement. The new technologies and practices will be put in place through farmer field schools – a method of learning that involves peer-to-peer teaching programmes. After their training, small farmers will receive inputs and support to put into practice the innovations they have learned.

Two of the most significant challenges Grenada faces are common ones for small island developing states: high levels of youth unemployment (above 40 per cent) and vulnerability of agricultural production to climate change and climate variability.
The agricultural sector in Grenada suffers from low productivity levels, an ageing farming population, a large amount of idle land (up to 28 per cent of all agricultural land), a lack of irrigated areas, and inadequate storage and processing facilities. As a result, Grenada depends on food imports for up to 80 per cent of its consumption.
By combining sustainable climate-smart agricultural practices with the development of agroprocessing enterprises, the programme is expected to lead to a significant increase in production and income levels. The goal of the programme is to contribute to the reduction of poverty and vulnerability in rural communities, benefiting around 7,500 households (54 per cent of all rural poor households in the nation).
In particular, SAEP targets two of the most vulnerable groups: smallholder farmers vulnerable to climate change and variability, as well as unemployed and underemployed men and women, with a focus on youth. SAEP promotes innovation and the engagement of young people in the most promising sectors of the rural economy, including farming and non-farming activities (e.g. agroprocessing, ecotourism and renewable energy). It supports ongoing and start-up businesses in rural areas through capacity building, technical services and financing. The programme also provides extension services to farmers with the aim of improving market linkages.
To address climate vulnerability, SAEP helps small farmers adopt sustainable and climate-smart techniques, including more efficient water management as well as conservation measures like irrigation, rainwater harvesting systems, terracing, drainage and mulching.

DEFIS will operate in eight regions in southern and centre-eastern Madagascar. The direct beneficiaries of DEFIS investments and services will be 320,000 family farms, at least 30 per cent of them headed by women or young people. Eight value chains – rice, maize, cassava, groundnut, coffee, onion, small ruminants and honey – have been selected, three in each region. In addition, support will be provided for value chains of special interest, such as sorghum and millet, that can build the resilience of production systems for family farms in semiarid zones.

By developing four agricultural value chains – rice, vegetables, sesame and cowpea – the Agricultural Value Chains Promotion Project (PAPFA) will contribute to meeting this challenge. In particular, the project will improve smallholder farmers’ productivity, add value to agricultural products and promote entrepreneurship as a means to overcome slow growth in rural areas.
The project will focus on the regions of Boucle du Mouhoun, Cascades and Hauts-Bassins, where it will build on and scale up the gains made by previous programmes. PAPFA will target 57,000 households, of which 27,500 will receive production support, 27,000 will be assisted in setting up or consolidating rural microenterprises and 2,500 will be supported in value chain development. Of the target groups, PAPFA will endeavour to reach a minimum participation rate of 50 per cent women and 30 per cent young people in all interventions.

Many communities in this sector are also hosting Syrian refugees. Both the host communities and the refugee populations frequently struggle with poverty 
– yet many have the potential to graduate out of it.
This project aims to reduce poverty and enhance national food security by improving the productivity of the small ruminant sector. It is also intended to assist Syrian refugees and host communities in graduating out of poverty through access to productive assets and the skills to invest in a sustainable source of livelihood that they could not afford otherwise.
The project's activities are organized into two components:
Investment in farmer services to strengthen the complementary public and private services offered to small ruminants producers, thanks also to the establishment of a National Agriculture Advisory Group for policy dialogue.
Livelihood investments and access to financial services, through grant-based income-generating packages for on- and off-farm enterprises as well as through lending facilities for rural businesses.
The project is implemented in the six northern and central governorates of Ajloun, Irbid, Jerash, Madaba, Mafraq and the outskirts of Amman. The primary target groups include some 11,920 households (or 57,216 individuals) among vulnerable smallholder livestock farmers.

Low agricultural productivity has been a characteristic of Iraq’s agriculture for the last two decades and has made the country dependent on imports to meet its domestic food needs. Agriculture is mostly practiced on small farming units and is a low input–low output system. The agriculture extension services for technology transfer, particularly for small producers, are weak. Due to a lack of post-harvest facilities, considerable food losses are often reported.
This project aims to enable poor smallholder farmers to improve crop and livestock productivity, develop activities to diversify their income sources, and become more resilient to the effects of climate change. Activities include rehabilitating or completing irrigation schemes to supply water to 8,322 hectares in the project area, improving nutrition by diversifying crops, and developing and increasing dairy, fish and poultry production. Marshland communities who are engaged in fishing, raising livestock and hunting will also be included.
The project will also strengthen farmers' organizations and women's and youth associations by helping them undertake productive investments both on and off the farm. 
The project is being implemented in the four southern governorates of Missan, Muthanna, Qadisiya and Thi Qar. The level of poverty in these governorates is among the highest in the country. The project is expected to reach 15,795 smallholder households and benefit a total of 140,000 rural people in the target area.

The Family Farming Productivity and Resilience Support Project (PREFER) aims to help 35,000 vulnerable smallholder farmers both increase agricultural production and their ability to deal with climate change, but also raise their incomes and improve food and nutrition security.
Operating in 48 villages, PREFER promotes the production of local staple foods such as bananas, cassava and vegetables, both for the domestic market and to generate surpluses that can be sold. The project is aligned with IFAD’s strategy for small island developing states by supporting better performing, climate-smart family farming practices, links to markets and income generation.
PREFER is also consistent with the directions of the Regional Food and Nutritional Security Programme of the Indian Ocean Commission, which focuses on revitalizing the regional supply of food crops to reduce dependence upon imports. To further contribute to its success, a grant from IFAD’s ASAP fund is financing the environmental dimension and the capacity-building that will help Comorian smallholders cope with the impacts of climate change. A strategic partnership has also be established with the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture for the introduction and evaluation of improved plant material for banana and cassava, as well as for the capacity-building of producers, extension agents and researchers.

It is designed to improve food security and nutrition, increase the incomes of rural poor households, create jobs and reduce the country's dependence on food imports.
The Inclusive Value Chain Development Project (PRODEFI) will build upon IFAD's experience in Mauritania and elsewhere in the region by adopting a poverty reduction approach based on supporting production and processing to respond to market demand. The first phase of the project will focus on horticulture, poultry farming, goat milk and non-timber forest products. Inland fishing will be tested around Lake Foum Gleita. Following market studies, new income-generating crops or activities will be defined for the second phase of this eight-year project. Beneficiaries will receive training and advisory services to improve their production models and help them adapt to climate change.
Through an Adaptation for Smallholder Agriculture Programme (ASAP) grant, the project will also facilitate the widespread use of solar energy, from production to storage and processing, as well as promote sustainable management techniques for natural resources such as water, pasturelands and seeds.  
In addition, to better match supply and demand, PRODEFI will develop an inclusive approach, especially through promoting public-private-producer partnerships in the interest of facilitating smallholder farmers' access to markets. This had proved to be a powerful method for reducing poverty in the previous IFAD-supported project, the Value Chains Development Programme for Poverty Reduction.

2000001199,Ongoing,Cuba,,2016,,60.51,11.9,,President's Report,|PRODEGAN seeks to benefit 11,500 rural families in the province of Camagüey, most of whom live in the municipalities of Camagüey, Guaímaro, Jimaguayú and Sibanicú. These families belong to or have links with the livestock sector, which was once flourishing in the area but has been declining since the 1990s due to lack of investments.
The project aims to promote the sustainable growth of the livestock sector by increasing the production and sale of milk and meat. Increased deliveries of milk and increased sales of beef are expected to result in higher average net incomes for the members of the 105 cooperatives participating in the project and in greater employment opportunities for wage-earning rural workers and technicians who work as service providers for the livestock cooperatives and in the related agro-industrial processing facilities.
These objectives will be achieved by implementing cooperative development plans and services to increase these organizations' production and sales of milk and meat in a sustainable manner. The project will also improve their managerial and organizational capacities, with special emphasis on the empowerment of women and young people.
Strengthening these livestock cooperatives is expected to create a "virtuous circle" resulting in benefits for the entire economy of Camagüey's rural areas. Beyond the cooperatives, service providers will be able to substantially improve the frequency and quality of their services, including technical assistance, and the capacity to transport and process milk and meat products will be strengthened.

It expects to accomplish these aims by improving the population's skills for better integration into profitable value chains and by improving their access to climate-resilient infrastructure and microfinance services. 
It is expected that increasing the competitiveness of agribusiness will generate rural employment and increase the resilience of low-income rural people while also broadening the Government's tax base, thus helping to finance its existing strategy for poverty reduction.
The project's activities are categorized into two core components:
Improving the capacities of smallholders and agribusinesses, enhancing their resilience and promoting investments in productive rural infrastructure and agrisystems.
Supporting agribusiness development through the establishment of the Moldova Credit Guarantee Fund for micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, as well as through other measures for promoting increased quantity and quality of production.
The project is intended to cover all the country's rural areas, with the aim of targeting climate-vulnerable farmers and agribusinesses and, more generally, the poorest segments of the rural society.

2000001144,Ongoing,Eritrea,,2016,,37.71,15.0,,President's Report,|A total of 17,500 poor rural households across six regions of Eritrea will benefit from a project designed to boost coastal and inland fisheries and improve the livelihoods of the coastal communities.
Eritrea has substantial and relatively underexploited marine and fisheries resources that have been underutilized for decades compared to neighbouring countries. These resources exist in an unpolluted, underexploited and undercapitalized marine environment. The Fisheries Resources Management Programme (FReMP) intends to invest both in large fisheries and small pelagics.
The Government of Eritrea has been making significant investments in the inland regions by constructing water retention dams. It has also established 330 reservoirs, 70 of which are stocked with different fish species. However, the inland fisheries resources have hardly been utilized, largely because local communities are generally not aware of their nutritional benefits and often lack fishing skills and equipment (apart from the fact that traditionally they are not fishers). The programme aims to change this situation by raising awareness, imparting the right skills, and enabling members of communities (especially youth and women) to acquire equipment for fishing and learn fish processing and marketing.
FReMP will support the establishment of infrastructure and technologies for production, post-harvest operations and marketing of both marine and inland fisheries. It will also promote the development and capacity building of cooperatives and other enterprises and ensure that they have access to the requisite tools to undertake economically viable and sustainable fish-related businesses. 
In addition, the programme is expected to transform Eritrea's small-scale fisheries sector from subsistence to a sustainable commercial fish industry.

Climate change has only worsened the situation, making rain patterns more erratic and unpredictable. In Nicaragua, the Dry Corridor environment is undergoing severe degradation, with 52 per cent of soils overused and 40 per cent strongly or severely eroded. Falling production has led to food insecurity and a decline in household incomes in the region's rural areas.
The Government is trying to address the social, productive and environmental implications of the situation through the Dry Corridor Strategic Framework. In line with the Government's guidelines, the Nicaraguan Dry Corridor Rural Family Sustainable Development Project (NICAVIDA) aims to improve the situation of Nicaraguan smallholders living in the Dry Corridor.
NICAVIDA will contribute to rural families' and indigenous people's resilience by promoting the links between economic diversification, productive transformation, environmental protection and family nutrition. The project aims to ensure small farmers' access to nutritious food and an adequate diet and increase their capacity for natural resource management and adaptation to climate change.
Moreover, the project will develop plans to meet the communities' needs in terms of productive infrastructure, stewardship and management of natural resources, access to water, road improvement and investments in public services that will improve the living standards of families in rural areas and connect them to markets.

1100001761,Ongoing,Liberia,,2015,,32.6,26.5,,President's Report,|In Liberia, agriculture is the primary source of livelihood for more than 60 per cent of the population. Traditionally, tree crops including cocoa, rubber and timber have been one of the country’s largest sources of employment, as well as an integral part of its social fabric. However, during the country’s civil wars, the tree crop sector was devastated and many farmers displaced. Abandoned farms and plantations degenerated into forests, and necessary infrastructure for tree crop farming was damaged or destroyed. Market linkages vanished, while exports dropped to almost zero.
The Tree Crops Extension Project II (TCEP II) will try to reverse this situation by investing in the revitalization or replanting of abandoned plantations. This project, which will be implemented in Lofa County, will increase the quantity and quality of cocoa sold by smallholders and will improve post-harvest handling and quality. It is expected to reach about 10,000 smallholder cocoa producers. Crop diversity will also be promoted through intercropping, which can improve food and nutrition security, shade management and income generation. Moreover, specific measures will be put in place to include women and youth, and to promote their access to project benefits such as training and financial services.
The project will strengthen and climate-proof rural infrastructure through the rehabilitation and maintenance of roads and the construction of humidity-controlled warehouses to store cocoa beans during the wet season, when roads are not passable. It will also build the capacity of the cooperatives to deliver better services to their members.
The TCEP II will scale up the recently completed Smallholder Tree Crop Revitalization Support Project and complement the Tree Crops Extension Project I, both supported by IFAD. It will enhance the delivery of quality services to cocoa farmers and guarantee sustainability through improved extension services and greater access to inputs and markets.

South American camelids contribute significantly  to the Bolivian High Plateau economy. The welfare of the region's population is closely linked to the income derived from their breeding as well as the processing and marketing of their by-products such as wool fibre and meat.
To boost the camelid sector, the Integral Strengthening Programme for the Camelid Value Chain in the Bolivian High Plateau (Pro-Camélidos) will address challenges such as low productivity, limited availability of feed and water, low value-added of raw material and lack of access to services. It builds on previous IFAD-funded projects to further boost and improve camelid-related production in Bolivia.
The programme expands over 47 municipalities in La Paz, Oruro and Potosi departments home to 67 per cent of camelids in Bolivia. 63,942 rural families, composed of small-scale producers, artisans, micro businessmen,  indigenous peoples, women and youth, engaged in camelid breeding will benefit from this IFAD-funded intervention.
The programme will contribute to:
reduce rural poverty and child malnutrition;
increase physical assets (productive infrastructure) and financial assets (capital) of programme users;
enhance the integration of business initiatives of programme beneficiaries in the South American camelid production complex value chains;
increase the income of participating families;
further adopt practices that are conducive to sustainable natural resource management;

This  will be achieved by facilitating the transformation from a subsistence-based rural agricultural economy into a sustainable value chain and market driven sector.
CARLEP builds on prior and on-going IFAD-funded interventions focused on increased agricultural production. This intervention will place attention on marketing and climate resilient farming practices. It aims to:
Sustainably increase agricultural production
Enhance agricultural production systems to absorb climate-induced shocks
Institute value chain and marketing systems for vegetable and dairy products
The programme will be implemented initially in six southern and eastern districts. There will be differentiation between the dairy and vegetable value chain areas with some overlap.  Scaling-up interventions after the mid-term review will allow an additional four districts in the central and southwest to participate.  
The programme supports the Royal Government of Bhutan's 11th five-year plan focusing on climate-resilient agriculture production, value-chain enhancement and policy dialogue to boost agriculture commercialization.
Poverty in Bhutan is overwhelmingly a rural phenomenon as nearly 95% of poor people live in rural areas. The programme will benefit 28,975 smallholder households, of which 7,115 households will directly benefit from vegetable and dairy value chains.

Both intervention areasfollow a clear value chain development approach that includes all players from production through to processing, services and marketing.
 
The project's goal is to contribute to national poverty reduction. The development objective is to enhance food and nutrition security and incomes among smallholder producer families through diversified agricultural production and market linkages. By the end of the project, rural poverty should be reduced by 20 per cent in the targeted chiefdoms and food insecurity reduced by 50 per cent in currently food deficient households. The project's three major outcomes are: 
the project chiefdoms engage in effective planning and decision-making;
soil and water 
resources are sustainably managed for market-led smallholder agriculture in the project chiefdoms; and
smallholder producers in the project chiefdoms supply crop and livestock products to market partners, while subsistence farmers are enabled to produce sufficient nutritious food for themselves.
The project will be implemented over a six-year period in 25 chiefdoms in the rainfed Middleveld and Lowveld areas of the Lubombo and Shiselweni regions. 
It will target poor smallholder farmers that are
food-deficient and living at a subsistence level; and 
economically active and able to sell surplus production.
The farmers will be assisted in increasing their farm productivity and production through access to irrigation, inputs, training and access to services. Economically active farmers will sell surplus production to wholesalers to increase income. Along selected value chains, employment opportunities will be created for young people, 
for example in managing collection and information centres. The activities are tailored to the capacities of smallholders, including women and families affected by HIV/AIDS.

1100001659,Closed,Congo,,2015,,14.8,7.7,,Project Design Report,|This project is aligned with certain activities under the sustainable development action plan for fisheries, i.e.: (i) strengthening infrastructure and human and technical capacities; and (ii) promoting responsible and sustainable fisheries management. With respect to the sustainable development action plan for aquaculture, this project is aligned with: (i) strengthening support services; (ii) making production systems more efficient; and (iii) professionalizing the subsector.
The overall objective of PD-PAC is to bring about a sustainable improvement in income and food security for fishers and fish farmers by developing the fisheries value chain. The specific objective is to sustainably improve fish production to increase the incomes of fishers and fish farmers. The project approach is to strengthen and better structure the value chain to enable small-scale fishers and fish farmers to obtain larger profit margins.

1100001734,Closed,Ecuador,,2015,,18.47,2.4,,President's Report,|The Government of Ecuador's Popular and Solidarity Economy (PSE) initiative encourages balanced work relations based on cooperation, solidarity and reciprocity, resulting in greater opportunities for employment and increased incomes for poor and vulnerable sectors of the population. Since its inception in 2011, PSE has been demonstrated to have great potential to reduce poverty and foster economic growth. The sales from enterprises benefiting from PSE represent approximately 25.7 per cent of Ecuador's GDP, contributing 10 per cent of the total net income and generating close to 60 per cent of total jobs in the country.
The Government of Ecuador, through the Instituto de Economía Popular y Solidaria (IEPS), is promoting the PSE throughout the country as a viable and efficient instrument to alleviate poverty, enhance social mobility and ensure redistribution.
Within this context, the IFAD-funded Strengthening the Rural Actors of the Popular and Solidarity Economy Project (FAREPS) seeks to improve the conditions for the development of a solidarity economy in the provinces of Guayas and Los Rios in the coastal region; Azuay in the central highlands; and Morona Santiago and Zamora Chinchipe in the Amazon. The project is expected to reach at least 20,000 poor and vulnerable rural families engaged in farming and non-farming activities.
To achieve this overarching target, the project will work hand-in-hand with PSE organizations, associations, cooperatives, communes and communities, to strengthen their membership and their institutional and managerial abilities. It aims to build the capacities of these organizations to develop a culturally and environmentally sustainable, market-oriented production model.
FAREPS will help transform smallholder farmers' visions into viable modern businesses based on trust and cooperation operating in a competitive environment.

1100001679,Closed,Angola,,2015,,12.14,11.15,,President's Report,|The project's goal is to reduce poverty in artisanal inland fishing and small-scale fish-farming households in target communities. It will mprove food security and nutrition among artisanal inland fishing and fishfarming households while addressing  climate change issues that affect fisheries and aquaculture sectors.
It will be implemented in 
Bengo, Cuanza Norte, Luanda and Malange
 provinces in Angola's central-north region. 
The inland artisanal fisheries development will cover communes north of the Cuanza River, between Dondo (Cuanza Norte) and the mouth of the Cuanza River (Luanda); and communes traversed by the Dande and Bengo Rivers, in Bengo and Luanda. Both areas have a large number of lakes, some of which are seasonally or permanently linked to those rivers. All fishing communities are located around the lakes and along the rivers. 
The project will target an estimated 15,000 people, or about 10,000 fishers and 5,000 processors and small traders.
It will support activities that:
strengthen institutional capacity (national, provincial, local/extension services)
improve community participation in economic and wider local development 
processes
increase the quantity and quality of fish produced and sold on a sustainable basis

1100001716,Closed,Solomon Islands,,2015,,60.4,4.54,,No report,|The overall objective of the second phase of Rural Development Programme is to reduce poverty and help to develop the agriculture sector in the Solomon Islands. The programme will revitalise the agricultural sector, build small-scale infrastructure and create income opportunities for over 68,000 poor, rural households.
The national programme will cover all nine provinces. Specifically, it will support smallholder farmers who produce commodities, such as cocoa and coconut, to partner with agri-businesses to add value to agricultural products and create jobs.  It will also invest in community-managed small-scale infrastructure to provide basic services such as roads, bridges and docks.
The financing agreement includes funds specifically designated for disaster recovery assistance.  These will be used to rebuild the Guadalcanal communities that were heavily affected by flash floods in 2014. All infrastructure investments will incorporate measures to mitigate future effects of climate change and natural disaster.
The 550,000 people living in the country face huge constraints as they are scattered over 90 islands and far from neighbouring countries.  People are often living in remote areas with limited access to land and limited opportunity to earn a viable income from agriculture.
