One of the main challenges facing the Government of Burkina Faso over the coming decade is the structural transformation of the national economy through strong, sustainable and inclusive growth, underpinned largely by a modernized agriculture sector. By developing four agricultural value chains – rice, vegetables, sesame and cowpea – the Agricultural Value Chains Promotion Project (PAPFA) will contribute to meeting this challenge. In particular, the project will improve smallholder farmers’ productivity, add value to agricultural products and promote entrepreneurship as a means to overcome slow growth in rural areas.
The project will focus on the regions of Boucle du Mouhoun, Cascades and Hauts-Bassins, where it will build on and scale up the gains made by previous programmes. PAPFA will target 57,000 households, of which 27,500 will receive production support, 27,000 will be assisted in setting up or consolidating rural microenterprises and 2,500 will be supported in value chain development. Of the target groups, PAPFA will endeavour to reach a minimum participation rate of 50 per cent women and 30 per cent young people in all interventions.
