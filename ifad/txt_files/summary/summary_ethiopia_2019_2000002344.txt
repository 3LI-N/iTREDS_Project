The objective of the programme is to improve livelihoods and to reduce vulnerability and poverty through increased incomes and better risk management through financial and nonfinancial measures. This will be achieved through a nationwide network of more than 11,000 RUSACCOs, their secondary structures (the Unions) and 38 MFIs, with increased focus on marginalized areas. 
The proposed target group consists of 50 per cent women and 10 per cent youth.
