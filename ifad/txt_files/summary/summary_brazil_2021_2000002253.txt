The project objective is to reduce the impact of climate change and increase the resilience of affected population in the largely semi-arid NEB region.
The project will support family farmers and their communities in reversing the decline in productivity caused by the degradation of agroecosystems. It will introduce technologies for water harvesting, storage and recycling, and diversification strategies to strengthen rural populations’ resilience.
The project will directly reach 250,000 smallholder families, or about one million people. The main selection criterion for accessing project services will be poverty. In addition, women and youth will be specifically targeted and traditional and indigenous communities will be included as beneficiaries wherever possible.
