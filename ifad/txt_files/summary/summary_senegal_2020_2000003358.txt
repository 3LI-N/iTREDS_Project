The Joint Programme for the Sahel in Response to the Challenges of COVID-19, Conflict and Climate Change (
SD3C
) in the Sahel and Senegal aims to consolidate the livelihoods of small producers, in particular women and youth living in cross-border areas of the six targeted countries. It is implemented in partnership with the two other United Nations Rome-based agencies – the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the World Food Programme (WFP) – and the G5 Sahel. It seeks to address the trilogy of challenges posed by COVID-19, conflict and climate change in the Sahel. The programme covers six years into two phase (phase 1: 2021-2023 and phase2: 2024-2026). The programme in Senegal will reach a total of 18,000 agro-pastoral households over the 6 years for a total representing 180,000 people, with at least 50 per cent Women and 40 per cent of young people aged 18 to 40.
Some expected outcomes of SD3C in Senegal are:
7,000 producers reporting access to relevant information on existing markets and opportunities.
4,000 producers have access to production factors and resilient technology packages and practices.
3,000 ha of lands will be rehabilitated and developed.
18 pastoral infrastructures are developed/rehabilitated.
6 market infrastructures built/rehabilitated and functional.
digital financial services with the aim of securing border transactions are improved.
