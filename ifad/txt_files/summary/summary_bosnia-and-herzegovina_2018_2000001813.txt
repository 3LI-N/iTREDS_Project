The project intends to contribute to rural economic development and poverty reduction by improving livelihoods, generating revenue and enhancing the living standards of target households through their engagement in profitable agribusiness and employment opportunities. It will support the country's efforts to modernize agriculture and improve food security and incomes of commercial and non-commercial farmers as well as of on- and off-farm enterprises.
Project activities will focus on the enhancement of economic opportunities and smallholder integration in value chains through three mutually-reinforcing sub-components:
development and implementation of pro-poor business plans based on the 4Ps approach;
development of farmers’ organisations through advisory services and financial support; and
development of the required infrastructure to support the pro-poor business plans
READP aims to promote the inclusion of very poor and poor non-commercial farmers, women and youth in selected value chains by developing ten clusters across the whole country. Direct beneficiaries include some 8,650 households; indirect beneficiaries, mainly from the project's infrastructure investments, are expected to be 5,000 households.
