Project areaÂ 
PICSA and SRIWMSP share an initial focus on 15 targeted irrigation schemes in 12 districts. These schemes will serve as a springboard for linking services and markets to adjacent areas. PICSA supports the roughly 90 villages associated with the 15 SRIWMSP schemes and will expand its coverage to similar villages in other districts, bringing the total number of districts and villages to be supported to 19 and 353, respectively. This includes remote villages inhabited by different ethnic groups.
