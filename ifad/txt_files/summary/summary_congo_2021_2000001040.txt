The project will be implemented in the departments of Pool, Bouenza, Niari, Kouilou, Lékoumou and Plateaux and will directly target 25,424 households, or 127,200 people in total.
The beneficiaries of the project will be:
small-scale agricultural producers and producer groups in the target areas;
young women and men with business plans that could receive support from banks, but who lack the means to start their business;
micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) run by young people and women operating in the agrifood sector; and
disabled people and indigenous populations. 
The objective of the project is to contribute to improving the living conditions and incomes of poor rural and peri-urban populations in the target areas.
The development objective is to promote the socio-professional integration of young people and vulnerable groups in profitable activities that create income opportunities and decent and sustainable jobs in the agrifood sector.
