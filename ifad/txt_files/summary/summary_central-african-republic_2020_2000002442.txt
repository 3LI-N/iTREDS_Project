The overall goal of PRAPAM is to make a lasting contribution to poverty reduction, the improvement of the food and nutrition security of poor rural households and the economic integration of women and youth in regions 1, 2 and 3 of the Central African Republic.
Its development objective is to build rural populations’ resilience and give them greater access to market opportunities. The project will work to lay the groundwork for increased crop and livestock production and to pave the way for improvements in the marketing of products of key sectors in the project area.
Project area. PRAPAM will work in four prefectures: Nana Mamberé, Ouam Pendé, Lobaye and Ombella Mpoko.
PRAPAM’s priority target groups will be:
small-scale crop farmers and livestock producers working at subsistence levels with small plots and herds;
displaced persons, returnees and extremely vulnerable persons such as people living with HIV/AIDS, persons with disabilities, older adults, widows and widowers, youth, girls and women who are heads of household and indigenous peoples.
All of the members of the target groups will be persons who are subject to structural forms of vulnerability and who lack production capital and social/economic and employment opportunities.
