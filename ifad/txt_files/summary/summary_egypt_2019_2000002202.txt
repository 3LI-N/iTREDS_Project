The programme's goal is to contribute to improved living standards of smallholder farmers and poor and vulnerable women and youth in the rural areas of Upper Egypt. Its objective is to improve the income and resilience of smallholder and landless families.
This will be done through better marketing linkages, sustainable and climate change-adapted agricultural intensification: development of small rural businesses; and Inclusive policies and strategies that build on the untapped potential of women and youth as resources for family resilience.
The programme has three main components:
Strengthening rural institutions, enterprises and markets.
Improvement of smallholder productivity and resilience.
Programme management and policy engagement.
The programme will be implemented in three governorates of Upper Egypt: Menya, Asyut and Sohag. It will provide services to 240,000 poor rural households, of which 160,000 smallholder households will receive the full set of STAR services and 80,000 households will benefit from the STAR-supported rehabilitated water infrastructure.
