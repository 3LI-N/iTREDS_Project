The Integrated Agriculture and Marketing Development Project (IAMDP) intends to increase the household incomes and enhance the climate change resilience of the smallholder producers, rural women and youth in rainfed areas of Sudan through improving access to quality agricultural inputs and services, enhancing business skills, facilitating access to rural finance and appropriate market support, and improving the organization and entrepreneurship skills of producers’ associations.
The IAMDP builds upon and consolidates investments supported by previous IFAD projects, moving from demonstration to the scaling up of public-private partnership models between farming households and private sector suppliers of inputs and services.
The project has three interlinked components:
Enhancing the productivity and production of the main cash crops (sesame, groundnuts and gum arabic) and sorghum
Improving market linkages and value addition through village-based post-harvest crop storage
Strengthening farmers' associations and business development through improved smallholder access to finance.
The IAMDP will intervene in 129 villages across North Kordofan, South Kordofan, West Kordofan and Sinnar states. It expects to reach 27,000 smallholder households with farms of 15 or fewer feddans (6.3 hectares) in size. The project's activities will focus on rural youth and women, who represent a specific target group for IFAD due to their traditional relevance in agricultural production, their increasing social and economic responsibilities, and their vulnerable position in society.
