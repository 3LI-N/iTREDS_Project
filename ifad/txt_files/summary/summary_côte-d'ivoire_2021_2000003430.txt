The objective of the Emergency Agriculture Project is to support the Government in providing emergency assistance to the smallholder producers most affected by COVID-19 and climate change who are engaged in highly strategic value chains for food and nutritional security. The development objective is to maintain and improve household food and nutritional security while supporting the recovery with the “building back better” approach to boost small farmers’ productivity, climate resilience and long-term income-generating capacity.
