The programme’s general objective is to sustainably ensure food and nutrition security and the resilience capacities of rural households in the Diffa region. The development objective is to sustainably increase the income, adaptation to climate change and market access of family farms and promote the social and economic integration of refugee or displaced populations into the receiving communities.
