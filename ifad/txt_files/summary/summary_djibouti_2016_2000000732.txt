The Soil and Water Management Programme (PROGRES) aims to sustainably improve living conditions and reduce poverty among rural Djiboutian communities within the programme area.
The development objective is to sustainably improve rural households’ access to water and local resources, as well as their resilience to climate change. The programme's investments and activities will be implemented in two technical components, in addition to a coordination and M&amp;E component.
PROGRES responds to a request for financing from the Government of Djibouti to scale up the Programme for the Mobilization of Surface Water and Sustainable Land Management (PROMES-GDT), completed in December 2014. The programme’s raison d'être is therefore to scale up best practices in mobilizing surface water and managing environmental and climate change risks by:
(i) expanding and adding to the network of hydraulic structures and regeneration of plant cover
(ii) promoting exchanges and social organization around improving rural living conditions
(iii) developing innovative activities to raise pastureland productivity.
