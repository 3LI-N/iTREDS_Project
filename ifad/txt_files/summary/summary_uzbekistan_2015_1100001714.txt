The DVCDP programmeÂ aims to improve the assets and incomes of dairy value chain stakeholders, including dehkan and private farmers, dairy processing enterprises, input suppliers and service providers, and the rural unemployed.
It will modernize dairy production in terms of gains in technical and managerial efficiency and effectiveness at key points of the dairy value chains:
capacity development of value chain stakeholders, especially women;
innovative technology testing and development;
creation of sustainable dairy value chain stakeholder forums; and
technical and financial support to primary producers and small-scale market services and input supply entities. Project support will be delivered in the context of a management approach that is targeted, demand-driven and participatory.
