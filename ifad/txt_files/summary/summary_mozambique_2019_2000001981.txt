The programme’s goal is to contribute to poverty reduction, improved food and nutrition security and resilient livelihoods for inclusive rural transformation. The development objective is to increase net incomes from climate-resilient agrifood value chains for rural women, men and youth.
The programme will target the following value chains: (i) selected horticulture commodities under irrigation; (ii) red meat (cattle and goats); (iii) poultry; (iv) cassava; and (v) legumes.
PROCAVA will be implemented in 75 districts, selected from all 10 provinces of Mozambique, in two phases over the 10-year framework. To enhance effectiveness, value chains will be prioritized in those provinces where they have a clear comparative advantage.
