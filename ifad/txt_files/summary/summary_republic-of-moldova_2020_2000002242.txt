The overall goal of TRTP is to reduce poverty and curb outmigration from rural areas through the enhancement of smallholder resilience to climate change. The development objective of the project is to enable the rural poor (especially youth, women and smallholders) to increase their productive capacity, resilience to economic, environmental and climate-related risks and access to markets.
The primary target group is commercially oriented smallholder farmers and youth entrepreneurs cultivating up to 10 hectares. TRTP will also focus on enabling youth entrepreneurs, women and men from rural areas to access finances and business development support to establish and expand their on- and off-farm businesses. Forty per cent of the beneficiaries will be women and 40 per cent will be youth. As the project is national in scope, the geographical targeting does not limit project interventions to a specific geographical area, but prioritizes interventions in the more climate-vulnerable and deprived areas of the country.Â
