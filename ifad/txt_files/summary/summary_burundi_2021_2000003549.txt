Burundi’s socioeconomic development has been constrained by socio-political crises and by environmental, economic, social, and institutional fragility.
The goal of the Rural Entrepreneurship Development Programme (PRODER) is to reduce poverty and improve rural people’s nutrition, food security, and climate resilience.
PRODER will help young people to overcome structural fragility by promoting youth entrepreneurialism and an enabling environment for agro-pastoral enterprises. The programme will favour women’s participation and will provide support to the Ministry of Environment, Agriculture and Livestock.
