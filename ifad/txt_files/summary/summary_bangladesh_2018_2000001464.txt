Although Bangladesh is considered a lower-middle-income country overall, the proportion of people living in extreme poverty in rural areas is still three times higher than in urban areas. Food security and undernutrition continue to be major concerns. Women are particularly affected by poverty, as they have fewer opportunities for employment, and rural youth are the most likely to migrate to cities to seek employment.
The Smallholder Agricultural Competitiveness Project (SACP)Â aims to significantly increase incomes and food and nutrition security by helping smallholder farmers be more responsive and competitive in producing diverse, high-value crops and marketing fresh and processed agricultural products. The project will provide technical training and access to finance.
The project will reach 250,000 rural households in southern Bangladesh, where the highest percentage of rural poor reside. Women, youth and disadvantaged households will be specifically targeted.
