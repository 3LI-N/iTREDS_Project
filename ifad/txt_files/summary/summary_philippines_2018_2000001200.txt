Capitalizing on market opportunities for rural poverty reduction requires investments in associated agricultural value chains. The proposed Rural Agroenterprise Partnerships for Inclusive Development and Growth Project (RAPID) will provide critical public goods and services needed for the development of collaborative frameworks and financing facilities that improve agricultural performance and reduce rural poverty and malnutrition.
Upgrading these value chains entails: linking agroenterprises with smallholders; improving smallholders’ access to productive capital, knowledge and technology; and improving agroenterprises’ access to agricultural produce of sufficient quality and quantity, as well as to investment capital.
