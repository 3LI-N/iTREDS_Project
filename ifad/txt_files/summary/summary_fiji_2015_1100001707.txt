Through the Fiji Agricultural Partnerships Project, IFAD is supporting the Government of Fiji to promote the concept of â€˜farming as a business'. The project promotes effective policies to strengthen the private agribusiness sector, agricultural value chains and marketing in rural areas.
The project will also continue to encourage community development, the adoption of climate change resilient technologies and certification of organic products, thus applying good practices acquired through IFAD grant activities over the past 10 years.
