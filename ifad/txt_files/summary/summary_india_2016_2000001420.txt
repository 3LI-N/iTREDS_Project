Smallholders in the Prakasam area and Rayalseema region of the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh are affected by vulnerability to drought and depletion of groundwater resources, especially in a context of climate change and climate variability.
The Andhra Pradesh Drought Mitigation Project strategy has two main aims:
improvement of farmers' capacity to adapt to drought, through more efficient crop water management and income diversification into livestock
management of existing water resources, through building Gram Panchayat's capacity regarding water planning and monitoring activities.
This project aims improve farmers' practices in using and producing drought-tolerant crop varieties, as well as in managing soil fertility and moisture. Farmers will also be assisted in accessing weather information, crop advisories and field schools, with the goal of helping them shift toward less water-intensive and more diversified and profitable cropping systems. Livestock production systems will be improved by helping sheep producers access better housing, feeding and breeding, as well as through a backyard poultry scheme targeted at the poorest women. Farmers' organizations will also be strengthened.
