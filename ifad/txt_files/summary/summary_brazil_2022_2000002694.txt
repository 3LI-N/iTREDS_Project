The objective of the Piauí Inclusive and Sustainable Project (PSI) is to improve the income, food security, nutrition, access to basic services and adaptation to climate change of the rural population living in the semi-arid region of Piauí. The specific objectives are to:
improve access to water for domestic use and production;
improve the environmental conditions of rural families and their surroundings;
increase the adoption of agricultural technologies, with emphasis on climate change adaptation and mitigation and the integration of small-scale producers in the value chain, especially women, youth and Afro-descendants.
The project area covers 138 municipalities in the watersheds of the Piauí and Canindé rivers in Piauí’s semi-arid region.
The target population comprises poor family farmers and other poor rural populations, with priority given to women, youth and traditional communities.
