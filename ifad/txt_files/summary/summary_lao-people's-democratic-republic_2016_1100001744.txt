The government of the Lao People's Democratic Republic aims to increase the country's livestock production dramatically by 2020, in response to increasing demand for meat domestically and from neighbouring countries.
This programme will scale up commercially oriented livestock practices so that smallholder farmers can compete more effectively in regional markets and in import substitution. It aims to improve smallholders' access to rural financial services and strengthen farmers' groups. Focusing on 12 high-poverty districts, the programme will establish smallholder livestock production and marketing groups and work with their members. Village-based savings and credit schemes will provide members with access to rural financial services, and technical and financial support will be tailored to ensure access by marginalized and poor villagers through Village Funds. The initiative will also involve livestock market studies, forage production, support for livestock breeding and land use planning. Additional support will come from the Asian Development Bank, which will invest in critical infrastructure and technical support. 
The programme will also strengthen support for women and ethnic groups through intensive training.
