The overall goal of the Fisheries, Coastal Resources and Livelihood Project (FishCORAL) is to reduce poverty in poor coastal communities, improve food and nutrition security and increase household incomes in the Philippines. This will be achieved by building fishing communities' capacity to sustainably manage fishery and coastal resources and by ensuring sustainable engagement in diversified livelihood activities.
The project will target coastal areas in four regions: Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, Caraga in Northeastern Mindanao, Eastern Visayas, and Bicol in Southern Luzon.
The project's main activities will include:
Monitoring and self-regulating fishing activities to prevent overfishing
Boosting the marine ecosystem by replanting vegetation and creating fish sanctuaries
Improving coastline infrastructure
Promoting fisheries related micro-enterprises including sea weed culture and fish processing
The project will also help to rebuild fishing communities and rehabilitation of coastal resources that were affected by the recent Typhoon Haiyan especially in the Eastern Visayas Region.
More than 180,000 poor households living in coastal areas will benefit from this IFAD-funded project.
