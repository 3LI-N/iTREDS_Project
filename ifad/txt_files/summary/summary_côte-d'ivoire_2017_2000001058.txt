In Côte d'Ivoire, agricultural development projects have traditionally concentrated on boosting productivity. Meanwhile, investments in post-harvest activities have remained insufficient. The Agricultural Value Chains Development Programme (PADFA) seeks to improve post-harvest activities (packaging, storage, processing and marketing) of three strategic value chains: rice, vegetables and mango. The goal is to stimulate economic growth and improve the food and nutritional security – as well as raise the incomes – of the smallholder households in the programme area. 
PADFA will target 32,500 vulnerable households in the regions of Bagoué, Hambol, Gbêkê, Poro and Tchologo, including 20,000 households in the rice value chain, 3,000 in the vegetable chain and 5,000 in the mango value chains. It will also reach about 4,500 households engaged in processing and marketing.
To promote agriculture as a business that can generate a surplus for smallholder producers, the programme will facilitate commercial partnerships, particularly between producers' organizations and the downstream value chain actors. PADFA will also mobilize investments by the domestic private sector by promoting cofinancing, risk-sharing mechanisms and other financial products and services to foster the development of private initiatives.
