Bangladesh is highly prone to natural hazards, like floods and cyclones, and climate variability. Geographical challenges are aggravated by inadequate water management infrastructure and weak operation and maintenance.
The Climate and Disaster Resilient Small-Scale Water Resources Management Project aims to build resilience to climate change and associated variability in four climate hotspots by improving institutional capacity for effective and inclusive water management, investing in climate-resilient infrastructure, and adopting climate-resilient agricultural practices and improved value chains.
The project will also improve nutrition by investing in climate-resilient food production, improved farm incomes, promotion of diversified and safe value chains, and nutrition education.
