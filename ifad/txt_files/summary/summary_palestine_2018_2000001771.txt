The project supports the acceleration of economic growth in rural areas of Palestine's West Bank by expanding the area under cultivation and increasing the productivity and profitability of rural production, as well as expanding marketing opportunities for smallholders and landless rural poor people. Its goal is to improve livelihoods and increase climate resilience in the target areas through adapted agricultural practices and enhanced governance and management of land and water.
The project's activities are organized into three components:
Climate-resilient land development, including investments in agricultural roads and soil improvement and rainwater-harvesting facilities
Market linkages for the rural poor, by facilitating clustering of agricultural products at village level and by creating climate-resilient, income-generating activities and entrepreneurial opportunities in the rural farming and off-farm sectors
Improved public services for scaling up resilient practices through access to knowledge, transformation of livelihood strategies and creation of an enabling environment.
All three components will be activated throughout the whole territory of the West Bank, though the first two will be implemented first in the Governorates of Bethlehem, Hebron, Jenin, Nablus, Tubas and Tulkarm before a gradual expansion. Target groups include smallholders and small-scale farmers; poor, landless and unemployed youth and women; and herders. An estimated 30,000 rural households – representing 150,000 persons – are expected to directly benefit from the project.
