DINAMINGA 
– 
designed to contribute to rural development by supporting small-scale Ecuadorean farmers at every stage, from production to commercialization 
– 
will work with 20,000 families of small producers of cocoa, blackberries and golden berries. It will pay special attention to indigenous and Afro-Ecuadorian communities.
The programme will strengthen the capacity of farmers' organizations to produce more and better quality food with higher value; train them in financial, administrative and business management; and facilitate alliances with private enterprises. 
The programme will be carried out in 65 cantons (municipalities) in the provinces of Napo and Orellana (Amazon region); Imbabura (Northern Sierra); Bolívar, Cotopaxi, Chimborazo and Tungurahua (Central Sierra); and Esmeraldas, Guayas, Los Ríos and Manabí (Coast). All of these areas have very high rates of poverty. The situation is particularly dire in the provinces of Manabí and Esmeraldas, which were severely affected by the earthquake that shook the country in April 2016. 
The overall aim of the project is to improve both the quantity and quality of small farmers' products and help them add value through the promotion of good agricultural and processing practices and access to the markets.
One innovative feature of the programme is that it will introduce the public-private-producer partnership model to Ecuador. In addition, a strong knowledge component will be integrated from the beginning so that best practices and experiences can be applied to improve the programme throughout its life cycle.
