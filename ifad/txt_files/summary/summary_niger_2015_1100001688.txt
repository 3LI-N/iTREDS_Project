The programme's general objective is to help sustainably guarantee food and nutrition security and rural households' resilience to crises in the Maradi, Tahoua and Zinder regions. The development objective is to sustainably increase the income of 240,000 family farms, their resilience to external shocks, including climate change, and their access to local, urban and regional markets in the three regions.
In the programme area some 2,030,000 people – or 290,000 households – are involved in agro-sylvo-pastoral activities.
ProDAF will focus particularly on 240,000 family farms and these are:
highly vulnerable family farms
moderately vulnerable family farms
family farms with little vulnerability
The programme also targets two demographic groups: women and young people. Among the latter, special attention will be paid to young women particularly affected by early marriage. Women and young people must respectively represent at least 30 per cent of the beneficiaries of all programme activities.
The ProDAF approach is grounded in the following three intervention principles:
improvement of food and nutrition security
territorial continuity of the interventions through the economic development pole; and
scaling up the current project activities of IFAD and its partners.
