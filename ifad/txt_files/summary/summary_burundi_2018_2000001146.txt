In Burundi, a main cause of poverty is the poor performance of the agriculture sector. The sector suffers from low public and private investment, weak capacity, overexploitation of natural resources and vulnerability to climate change, floods and droughts, as well as soil degradation, diseases and pests, and barriers to market access. The Agricultural Production Intensification and Vulnerability Reduction Project (PIPARV-B) will target the provinces of Gitega, Karuzi, Kayanza, Muyinga and Ngozi, where population and malnutrition rates are among the highest in the country.
PIPARV-B aims to reduce chronic child malnutrition and improve overall nutrition rates in the project areas by training household members in good dietary practices, nutrition and hygiene. Through the organization of 20 cooperative groups, a total of 6,000 participants are expected to gain access to climate-resilient technologies, including high-quality seeds and plants, as well as storage, processing and marketing facilities for rice and milk. The project will also promote fishing, poultry farming, bee-keeping and the raising of small livestock.
The project will establish 240 farmer field schools in developed wetland areas, while also supporting 30 wetland users associations and 333 watershed committees, to train a total of 3,000 young men and women. PIPARV-B is also expected to rehabilitate 150 kilometres of rural roads to facilitate market access, and to construct 30 rice storage facilities equipped with hulling and whitening machines. In addition, 100 warehouses will be built.
