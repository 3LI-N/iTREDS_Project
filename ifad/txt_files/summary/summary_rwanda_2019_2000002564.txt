The IFAD-supported interventions will target a total of 15 districts across the northern, southern and western provinces. Districts and sectors will be selected on the basis of the incidence of poverty and food insecurity. The Enabel-funded interventions will have national coverage but will concentrate on areas with higher potential for market-oriented poultry and pig production.Â
