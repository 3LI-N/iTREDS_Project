The Goat Value Chain Development Programme (PRODECCA, from its SPANISH initials) aims to help small goat farmers in Argentina increase, enhance and market their production of meat, dairy products and fibre, especially mohair and cashmere.
The programme is expected to benefit a total of 8,000 families across the provinces of Chaco, Formosa, Mendoza, Neuquén and Santiago del Estero, home to about some 60 per cent of the country's goat herds.
It will prioritize work with existing goat farmers' organizations and promote incorporation of vulnerable groups, especially indigenous peoples, women and youth into markets for goat products. In that regard, many of the programme activities are designed to strengthen these farmers' organizations by supporting the preparation and implementation of participatory business plans, with special focus on basic financial education.
The main challenge for achieving these targets is the fact that markets for goat products are little developed in Argentina. To overcome this, the programme will strengthen goat product markets by supporting market analysis, including marketing opportunities abroad; provide technical assistance to processing companies; and promote goat product standardization and sustainable goat management.
