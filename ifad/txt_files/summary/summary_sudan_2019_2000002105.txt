SNRLP’s goal is to increase the food security, incomes and resilience of pastoralists, agropastoralists and smallholders engaging in joint natural resource-related activities. The objective is to increase production, secure access to natural resources for vulnerable users and improve the sustainability of natural resource-related livelihoods, by scaling up community-based natural resource governance practices, technologies and business models.
The objective is aligned with the strategic objectives set forth in the results-based country strategic opportunities programme agreed between IFAD and Sudan by: (i) focusing on restoring ecosystems, strengthening resilience against climate change and facilitating target groups’ access to basic agricultural services; and (ii) promoting diversification in smallholder livelihood systems, building the capacities of community institutions, producers, women and youth, and promoting target groups’ access to rural finance.
