Although Mexico is classified as an upper-middle-income country, 61.1 per cent of its rural population lives in poverty and 20.6 per cent lives in extreme poverty. In addition, 52.4 per cent of women live in households with per capita income below the well-being line, and 88 per cent of rural women are highly marginalized.
The Territory and Inclusion Project aims to help rural farmers access the support and funding provided in the Government of Mexico’s Social Economy Development Programme. It will also work to raise their productivity and increase their incomes by investing in productive projects, delivering technical assistance and strengthening access to financial services. The end goal is the comprehensive development of highly marginalized communities and social sector organizations.
The project will be implemented in four states: Chiapas, Guerrero, Oaxaca and Puebla.
An estimated 22,540 people will benefit from the project.
