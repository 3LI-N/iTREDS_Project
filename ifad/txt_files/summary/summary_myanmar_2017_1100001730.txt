The goal of the project is to develop an inclusive, sustainable and scalable model for smallholder agriculture and community agroforestry in Myanmar's eastern states of Kayin and Shan (South). 
 
The project's objectives are to: 
Promote commercialized smallholder agriculture linked to agribusiness
Improve living standards in forest communities
Reverse environmental degradation in sloping areas
Generate substantial benefits for households belonging to the Intha, Karen, Mon, Paoh and Shan ethnic groups.
The target group consists of poor rural women and men in the project areas. These include farmers in irrigated lowlands, farmers in the rainfed uplands, and agroforestry households in mountainous areas of northern Kayin.  
Landless households will have access to job opportunities as agricultural labourers or as workers in agribusiness. The project will also ensure that employment opportunities facilitate the economic reintegration of returning migrants, ex-combatants and displaced people.  
The project's rationale is anchored in IFAD's mandate of poverty reduction and the Government of Myanmar's policies to reduce economic and social disparities in rural areas. Approximately 62,400 poor rural households are expected to benefit.
