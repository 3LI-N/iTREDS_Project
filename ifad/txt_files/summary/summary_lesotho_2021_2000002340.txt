The project's objective is to ensure that rural communities adopt transformational practices for regenerated landscapes and sustainable livelihoods, leading to improved nutrition and adaptation to climate change. This objective is underpinned by four outcomes:
changed resource use practices;
reduction of environmental degradation;
improved livelihoods; and
the establishment of a facility and a fund for landscape regeneration.
Project duration is set at eight years.
