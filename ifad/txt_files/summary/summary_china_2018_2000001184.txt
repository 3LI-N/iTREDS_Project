Although China has drastically reduced poverty over the last 40 years, some 30 million people in rural areas are still living below the poverty line, according to China’s National Bureau of Statistics. They often live in remote areas with few options to improve their incomes and living conditions, including limited access to finance or markets.
The Sustaining Poverty Reduction through Agribusiness Development in South Shaanxi Project aims to reduce poverty and increase smallholder farmers’ incomes by improving access to finance and new markets – including helping farmers benefit from the growing urban demand for safe, high-quality food. The project will provide agribusiness enterprises with incentives to engage with smallholder farmers by laying the groundwork for fair and mutually beneficial contractual arrangements. 
The project aims to reduce poverty and improve incomes for 339,561 smallholder farmers in the Qinba Mountains in south Shaanxi. It aims to contribute to China's goal of eradicating rural poverty by 2020.
