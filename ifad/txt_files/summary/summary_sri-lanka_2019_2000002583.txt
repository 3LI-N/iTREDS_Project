The project aims to address the impacts of climate change on about 40,000 smallholder families, building their resilience and promoting agriculture commercialisation. The project will mobilise climate-sensitive investments and work with smallholder producers to build and expand agricultural activities that are climate resilient and part of inclusive value chains. It will operate in six districts in the country’s dry zone, namely Anuradhapura, Vavuniya, Matale, Mannar, Puttalam and Kurenagala districts.
Potential commodities include goats, dairy, chilli, and fruits and vegetables, as well as more specialised crops like aloe vera and moringa – a wide range to mitigate the risks of climate change.
Producer organisations and watershed associations will learn to manage climate risks. Women, youth, group organizations and social enterprises will also benefit from support in managing enterprises in a financially profitable and sustainable way.
