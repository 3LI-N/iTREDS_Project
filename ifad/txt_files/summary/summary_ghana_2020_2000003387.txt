The ESRF will help to protect the livelihoods and incomes and to build the resilience of the target groups suffering from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and climate change. It will mitigate the threats to production, food security and market access posed by the COVID-19 pandemic and climate change.
The ESRFâ€™s expected results are: (i) targeted households will maintain or increase their production, food security and climate change resilience relative to their pre-COVID-19 situation; and (ii) targeted households will maintain or increase their market linkages, sales volumes and income levels from market participation relative to their pre-COVID-19 situation.
