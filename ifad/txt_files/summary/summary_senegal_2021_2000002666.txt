The Agriculture and Livestock Competitiveness Programme for Results (PCAE-PforR) was designed by the World Bank Group, IFAD, and the Government of Senegal to reduce rural poverty and improve people’s food and nutrition security in the poorest regions of Senegal.
The programme aims to enhance the productivity and market access of priority commodity value chains and livestock. Stakeholders include smallholders, cooperatives, research and development agencies, traders, processors, and exporters.
