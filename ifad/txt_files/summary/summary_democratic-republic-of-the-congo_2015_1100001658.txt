The Democratic Republic of the Congo is experiencing robust economic growth following decades of political instability, insecurity and economic devastation, yet food and nutritional insecurity remain alarmingly high: 54 per cent of rural households are food-insecure, 43 per cent of children under five are chronically malnourished and 8 per cent suffer from acute malnutrition. Rural poverty rates are also persistently high, standing at 69 per cent in 2012.
PASA-NK aims to enable smallholder farmers to gain sustainable access to inputs and markets, to improve farmers’ remuneration from agricultural products, and to increase the stability of apex producer organizations. It will cover the production and commercialization of four important crops: maize, rice, potato and Arabica coffee.
As indicated by its name, PASA-NK will be implemented in the province of North Kivu, and more specifically in the territories of Beni, Lubero, Masisi, Nyiragongo and Rutshuru. Activities will involve one or two crops in each of the territories targeted. A total of 28,400 households will benefit directly from the project’s activities.
