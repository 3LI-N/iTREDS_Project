14,000 rural households in four departments in the  eastern region of Paraguay will benefit from the Project for Improved Family and Indigenous Production in the Departments of Eastern Paraguay (PROMAFI). The project will reach out to family farmers and indigenous communities in selected districts with high poverty rates.
The project's objective is to increase poor rural household incomes sustainably through:
strengthening organizations. The project will build the capacity of grass-roots organizations so that they can  identify and undertake business activities. Participatory rural appraisals undertaken by the project will culminate in plans  enhancing rural organization's (RO) capacity to participate, organize and better, their production, finances and be in a better position to market their products.
enhancing productivity. The project will provide cash transfers to support development of business plans, to engage in climate change adaptation activities, and develop community development plans. The project will contribute to the country's weather station network, set up a climate information service where smallholder farmers can receive alerts via  text messages, and provide technical support to the participating ROs to take up climate change mitigation and adaptation measures.
providing rural financial services. The project will strengthen the ROs' capacity to finance their businesses  through credit from intermediary financial institutions. To this end, once ROs have their business plans approved, they can access a guarantee trust which will provide them with the necessary certificates. Moreover, it will contribute to the Central Bank's National Financial Inclusion Strategy by supporting training-of-trainers for rural financial education.
