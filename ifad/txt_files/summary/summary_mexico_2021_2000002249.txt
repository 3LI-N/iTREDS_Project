Despite being the second largest economy in Latin America and the Caribbean, Mexico continues to face structural barriers to inclusive rural growth. In 2018, poverty and extreme poverty affected around half the country.
The Balsas Basin is one of the highest climate vulnerability regions in Mexico. This is expected to reduce agricultural productivity and forest and mangrove cover; adversely impact the availability of ecosystem services; increase coastal flooding; and impact tourism infrastructure.
The Reducing Climate Vulnerability and Emissions through Sustainable Livelihoods project aims to reduce poor rural peopleâ€™s vulnerability to climate change, recover and conserve ecosystems and their services, and strengthen the production systems of the Balsas Basin. The target population is comprised of small producers living in poverty, indigenous peoples, women, and youth.
