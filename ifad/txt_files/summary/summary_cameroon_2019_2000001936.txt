Cameroon has one of the most diversified economies in the Central Africa Economic and Monetary Community, yet poverty remains an issue, particularly in rural areas and in the North of the country. About half of the economically active population are employed in the agriculture sector, which is dominated by small family farms.
Building on the 
first phase of the project
, the Commodity Value Chain Development Support Project – Phase II (PADFA II) will help reduce poverty and improve food and nutrition security for the target populations. This will be achieved by sustainably increasing the income and resilience of family farms that grow rice and onions in the project areas.
The project will be implemented in the four PADFA regions – North, Far North, Northwest, and West – and will reach an estimated 216,642 people, half of whom will be women and 30 per cent youth.
