The project goal is to empower village communities' contributions to rural transformation and inclusive growth in eastern Indonesia by leveraging the potential of the Village Law and the Village Fund. Its development objective is to enable rural households to develop sustainable livelihoods, taking advantage of strengthened village- and district-level governance.
The project will target smallholder farming households, microentrepreneurs and households in coastal communities involved in fisheries. Primary beneficiaries will mostly be semi-subsistence households with minimal assets and resources.
