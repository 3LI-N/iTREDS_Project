This programme aims to sustainably raise the incomes and and improve the quality of diet of 57,500 smallholder households by expanding livelihood and business opportunities in the agriculture sector. It will provide a platform for smallholder farmers, particularly women and young people, to access financing and business training and will help them to form partnerships with each other and with the private sector.
Developing the agribusiness value chain – which encompasses agricultural production, processing, distribution and marketing – will help smallholder farmers increase their incomes and will improve employment opportunities and household nutrition in the programme areas.
The programme will build on lessons learned and the experiences of past and ongoing IFAD-financed programmes, including the 4P models developed under 
NADeP
. Further emphasis will be given to more farmer-led business proposals. The total cost of the programme is US$111.2 million, of which $40 million will be financed by an IFAD loan.
