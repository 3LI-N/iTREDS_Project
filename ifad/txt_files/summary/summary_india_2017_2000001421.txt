In India, the farmers of the states of Mizoram and Nagaland in the North-Eastern Region have been using a shifting cultivation system known as 
jhum
.
Although the 
jhum
 has met the needs of rural communities as a source of food, fibre and energy, it has become unsustainable due to increasing population numbers, soil fertility degradation, topsoil erosion, changing climate patterns and a shift in focus to include producing high-value crops for increased incomes.
Because 60 per cent of the area under food grain cultivation in these regions is covered by the 
jhum
 system, there is a great need for development in farming technologies and practices.
The Fostering Climate-resilient Upland Farming Systems (FOCUS) project is designed to:
provide farmers with better 
jhum
 cultivation practices that will be both more productive and more sustainable, thus creating an ecological balance, enhancing resilience to climate change, and raising farmers' incomes
assist 
jhumia
 households to adopt alternative farming systems, particularly settled farming
support improved market access and value chain development as farmers move to more market-oriented production
The project will focus on communities in the hills of both Mizoram and Nagaland. A total of 201,500 households will directly benefit from the project, most of these being members of tribal villages.
