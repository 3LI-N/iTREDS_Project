The livestock sub-sector plays an important role in the Kenyan economy, helping to improve household food and nutrition security, increase incomes, create jobs, and contribute to sustainable livelihoods of many rural people living below the poverty line.
The Kenya Livestock Commercialization Project (KeLCoP) focuses on value chains that have the potential to provide productive employment and food security opportunities for women, youth, and marginalized people.
The KeLCoPâ€™s aims to increase small-scale farmer incomes and improve opportunities for the rural poor to enable them to increase their output, access markets, and increase their resilience.
