The project's goal is to reduce poverty in artisanal inland fishing and small-scale fish-farming households in target communities. It will mprove food security and nutrition among artisanal inland fishing and fishfarming households while addressing  climate change issues that affect fisheries and aquaculture sectors.
It will be implemented in 
Bengo, Cuanza Norte, Luanda and Malange
 provinces in Angola's central-north region. 
The inland artisanal fisheries development will cover communes north of the Cuanza River, between Dondo (Cuanza Norte) and the mouth of the Cuanza River (Luanda); and communes traversed by the Dande and Bengo Rivers, in Bengo and Luanda. Both areas have a large number of lakes, some of which are seasonally or permanently linked to those rivers. All fishing communities are located around the lakes and along the rivers. 
The project will target an estimated 15,000 people, or about 10,000 fishers and 5,000 processors and small traders.
It will support activities that:
strengthen institutional capacity (national, provincial, local/extension services)
improve community participation in economic and wider local development 
processes
increase the quantity and quality of fish produced and sold on a sustainable basis
