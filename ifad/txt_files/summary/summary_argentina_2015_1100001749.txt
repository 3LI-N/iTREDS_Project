The Programme for Economic Insertion of Family Producers of Northern Argentina or PROCANOR will benefit 8,000 families in the Greater North provinces of Argentina, especially those of Catamarca, Chaco, Corrientes, Jujuy, Misiones and Salta.
The programme aims to integrate rural organizations of small-scale producers and indigenous communities in emerging and dynamic value chains, particularly quinoa, potatoes, yacón (a tuber), chia, llama and vicuña products, and horticulture. 
It will leverage opportunities for building partnerships among agribusinesses, commercial enterprises and farmers' organizations by:
developing inclusive markets. The programme will support the development of inclusive value chains, with a focus on partnerships between the rural organizations and other private-sector actors, through market promotion, brand creation, certification of origin, public procurement and creation of market infrastructure. Moreover, it will develop technologies adapted to small-scale farmers' needs and capacities, including prototyping of equipment, installation of laboratories and development of seed systems.
strengthening organizations. The programme will support participating organizations in consolidating strategic alliances, implementing business plans and improving operations along the value chain.
enhancing productivity. The project will strengthen the productive capacities of producer families through investment in on-farm assets, technical assistance and training.
