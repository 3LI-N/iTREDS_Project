The Access to Markets Project (ATMP) aims to raise incomes and enhance economic growth in Kyrgyzstan's pastoralist communities. Its development objective is the improved access and integration of smallholder livestock farmers into remunerative markets for their products, leading to improved and equitable returns.
ATMP will work within several pre-selected value chains, providing holistic and coordinated support to different actors in order to improve these value chains’ overall performance and increase their outputs. The project will invite champions in these value chains who are willing to launch or deepen their sound business models through productive partnerships with producers and other value chain actors. Smallholder livestock producers – who are the project’s primary target group – will be represented in each selected value chain. Their income opportunities are expected to improve through better integration into the market. Pasture users' unions, facilitated by Kyrgyzstan’s Community Development and Investment Agency (ARIS) and building on the positive experiences of the Livestock and Market Development Programmes I and II, will play an active role in identifying and mobilizing target groups at the community level in a transparent and participatory manner to capture project opportunities and benefits.
