The Dairy Modernization and Market Access Project (DiMMA) will equip smallholder producers at risk of losing their markets with the know-how and technologies to upgrade their milk production systems, adopt food safety standards and comply with the food hygiene regulations.
It will contribute to import substitution by increasing the local supply of high-grade milk to dairy-processing enterprises, thus reducing their dependence on imported ingredients. It will also improve the productivity of dairy animals through better nutrition, veterinary care and breed improvement activities.
In addition, DiMMA will reduce the vulnerability of pastures to the effects of climate change by supporting improved management practices and climate change mitigation/adaptation measures, and will strengthen dairy cooperatives through capacity-building measures and by involving them in dairy business development activities. The project will also develop and strengthen dairy stakeholder platforms and farmers' organizations that will support stakeholder consultations and policy dialogue.
