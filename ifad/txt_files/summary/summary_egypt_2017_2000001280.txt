The project aims at reducing poverty and enhancing food and nutrition security through remunerative, sustainable and resilient livelihoods in climate-change-affected areas by improving the productive capacities of poor rural households and assisting communities in enhancing the productive potential of newly reclaimed lands as well as in improving nutrition and socio-economic status of women and children.
Activities are organized in two components: Climate Resilient Livelihoods, and Integrated Nutrition-sensitive Investments. The first component revolves around water for agriculture and watershed management; roads and infrastructure; livestock and rangeland development; and crop production. The second component supports the promotion of gender equality and women empowerment by providing a comprehensive package that includes access to domestic water and sanitation, nutrition-sensitive interventions and social infrastructures.
The project's activities are concentrated in the Matrouh Governorate and include specific interventions for the coastal areas from Dabaa to El Salloum as well as in the Siwa Oasis and El Moghra in the Al Alamein District. While PRIDE is expected to directly benefit approximately 36,000 households or 216,000 individuals, the target group is the entire population of the Governorate, which is estimated at approximately 450,000 people or 60,000 households.
