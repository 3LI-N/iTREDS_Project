Haiti’s economic and social development continues to be hampered by political instability, governance issues, and fragility. With a population of around 11 million, Haiti is the poorest country in the Latin America and Caribbean region and is among the poorest countries in the world.
The Inclusive Blue Economy Project aims to transform the way coastal rural populations, especially women and youth, manage natural and marine resources in the north and northeast of Haiti. The purpose of the project is to reduce poverty and strengthen the climate resilience of rural coastal rural populations. Conserving these resources provides a source of sustainable income while combatting malnutrition.
