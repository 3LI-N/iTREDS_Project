KCEP-CRAL aims to reduce rural poverty and food insecurity among smallholders in Kenya’s arid and semi-arid lands by developing their economic potential, while improving their natural resource management capacity and resilience to climate change in an increasingly fragile ecosystem.
This goal will be pursued through:
(i) graduation of smallholder farmers to commercially oriented, climate-resilient agricultural practices through improvements in productivity, post-production management practices and market linkages for targeted value chains
(ii) empowerment of county governments and communities to sustainably and consensually manage their natural resources and build resilience to climate change.
