A series of political crises and armed conflicts have weakened the Democratic Republic of Congo. In rural areas, more than 82 per cent of the population live below the poverty line and 76 per cent of households are food-insecure. However, the country has vast agricultural potential, with close to 110 million hectares of non-forest arable land, only 10 per cent of which has been developed.
The Inclusive and Resilient Rural Development Programme (PADRIR) aims to reduce rural poverty and improve incomes, food security, nutrition and resilience, while sustainably improving the productivity and competitiveness of value chains for crops.
The programme will reach 2,464,000 people with investments in roads, social infrastructure, agricultural inputs, and services. It will also improve economic conditions, boost productivity for the major food crops targeted; and support entrepreneurship for young people and women.
