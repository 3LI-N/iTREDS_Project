India has made substantial progress in reducing poverty, resulting in 270 million fewer poor people. However, the country still has the worldâ€™s highest number of people living in poverty, a situation that has worsened due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Rural Enterprise Acceleration Project (REAP) aims to double the incomes of rural households and reduce distress migration from rural areas. This will be achieved by diversifying sources of income through intensified, cluster-based, climate-resilient production systems. Enterprises will be promoted and supportive ecosystems will be developed.
