Despite recent economic growth, Kenya remains a food-insecure country, with approximately 10 million Kenyans suffering from chronic food insecurity and poor nutrition. More than 75 per cent of its population live in rural areas, where poverty affects 50.5 per cent of the people. The aquaculture sector has significant potential to reduce poverty, but it is not being fully exploited.
The Aquaculture Business Development Programme will enable existing and potential aquaculture producers to benefit from fish production in an economically and environmentally sustainable manner. It will also promote local income-generating businesses that provide support services to the aquaculture sector. The proposed approach blends publicÂ and private sector investments in the aquaculture value chain with community-wide initiatives that promote good nutrition and food security.
The programme will target 15 counties and reach 35,500 households, including women, youth and landless people. Indirect beneficiaries will include rural communities, who will benefit from improved education in nutrition and improved access to affordable, nutritious food.
