Economic and political reforms have spurred rapid economic growth and transformed Viet Nam from one of the world’s poorest nations to a lower-middle-income country.
However, unsustainable exploitation of natural resources have driven this growth. In the Mekong Delta, overuse of surface and ground water is leading to water scarcity. Climate change is also taking a toll on agriculture.
The Climate-smart Agricultural Value Chain Development aims to achieve sustainable and climate-resilient rural transformation in Ben Tre and Tra Vinh Provinces. It will generate sustainable income opportunities and improved rural livelihoods for 60,000 smallholder farmers’ households, with a focus on women, youth, and ethnic minorities.
