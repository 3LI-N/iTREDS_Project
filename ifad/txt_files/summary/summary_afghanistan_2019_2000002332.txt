The projectâ€™s goal is to increase employment opportunities for the target population and stimulate GDP growth, while its developmental objective is to improve management and use of water resources in the Arghandab River sub-basin.
The geographic project target areas are the predefined irrigation command areas of the Arghandab irrigation system (AIS), with a total area of 115,000 ha, served by 120 community irrigation systems.
The project will primarily target 36,000 smallholder farmer households (approximately 324,000 people, with special attention given to women and youth) located in the Arghandab River sub-basin. The project will support the formation of farmer organizations and WUAs as community institutions.
