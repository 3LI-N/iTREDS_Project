The Gӧksu Taşeli Watershed Development Project  will be implemented in selected villages within nine districts in the Konya and Karaman provinces of Central Anatolia. It will target 32,000 households consisting of productive smallholder farming households, poor households and nomadic households,  majority of whom are engaged in producing fruit and field crops and small ruminants products.
The goal of the project is to reduce rural poverty by supporting economic diversification . The project will increase farmers' incomes through improved agricultural production and marketing activities, and strengthen resilience to climate shocks. The project will also improve the living standards of the nomadic tribes in the Taurus Mountains by improving natural resource management.
Expected outcomes are:
increased farm productivity and production
higher  prices for products produced  by smallholder producers
adoption of climate-resilient natural resource management practices.
