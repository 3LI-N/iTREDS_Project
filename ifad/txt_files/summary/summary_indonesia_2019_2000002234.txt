The project goal is to reduce poverty and enhance food security in upland areas through remunerative, sustainable and resilient livelihoods.
The target group of the project is smallholder men and women farmers and processors involved or with the potential to become involved in the selected commodities; high priority will be given to youth. UPLANDS will directly work with rural households, farmers' groups and women's groups.
