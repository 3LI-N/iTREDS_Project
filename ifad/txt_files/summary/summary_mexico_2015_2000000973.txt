The Rural Productive Inclusion Project will be implemented in 26 municipalities of the Mexican states of Guerrero, Hidalgo and Zacatecas. 12,800 families are expected to benefit from this intervention. The project facilitates the access of PROSPERA beneficiaries - the country's largest conditional cash transfer program - to other Government programmes, allowing them to develop their own productive initiatives, thus ensuring a stable source of income and enabling them to improve their living conditions.
The project will contribute to implement the Government's national strategy to reduce rural poverty. It will do so by promoting:
Productive inclusion. It will help beneficiaries to have access to the Government's existing productive programs and use the investments efficiently to increase the quantity and improve the quality of their products, enabling them to access to markets. Local promoters will assist the beneficiaries to identify profitable productive activities and facilitate their access to technical assistance.
Institutional strengthening. The project will strengthen PROSPERA's institutional capacity to fight rural poverty through the implementation of the national strategy for productive inclusion. It will contribute to develop new institutional skills through training, research, analysis and knowledge management activities.
Financial inclusion. The project will promote financial literacy of the beneficiaries and facilitate access of the beneficiary groups to existing rural financial services.
