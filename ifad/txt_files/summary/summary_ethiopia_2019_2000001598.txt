The proposed project aims to enhance livelihood resilience at scale in the most marginalized regions of Ethiopia. 
The project will benefit approximately 2.5 million people (500,000 households) as primary beneficiaries, including: (i) pastoralists and agro-pastoralists in the targeted rangelands; (ii) those opting out of pastoralism or interested in alternative livelihoods; and (iii) communities in selected woredas that have access to social services (education, health, water, veterinary services, etc.).
