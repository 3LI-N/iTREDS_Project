The project’s goal is to improve the incomes and livelihoods of rural people by increasing the inclusiveness and profitability of selected value chains through enhanced productivity and market access as well as improved natural resource management. The project will promote a demand-driven approach focused on analysing each step of the value chain and investing in those needs that have the potential to improve the productivity, profitability and competitiveness of value chain players, especially Dekhan farmers.
The Agriculture Diversification and Modernization Project (ADMP) has three interrelated components:
Inclusive value chain development, to promote the enhanced capacity and the sustainable and efficient performance of stakeholders as well as a productive environment for agribusinesses
Inclusive rural finance, to increase productivity and efficiency among targeted smallholders, enabling various actors to increase their investments in profitable value chains
Climate-resilient rural infrastructure through modernization of the inter-farm irrigation network operated by water consumer associations (WCAs), with the aim of diversifying agricultural production, increasing land productivity and improving WCAs' capacity for water management.
Project activities are concentrated in the Fergana Valley in the regions of Andijan, Fergana and Namangan. Target groups include rural low-income households on Dekhan farms, small private horticulture and livestock farmers, and agribusinesses. Special attention is paid to ensure the participation of women-headed Dekhan and private farming households as well as rural youth.
