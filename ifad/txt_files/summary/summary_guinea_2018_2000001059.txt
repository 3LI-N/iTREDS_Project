In Upper Guinea and Middle Guinea, the potential of agriculture for improving livelihoods and food security is high and soil and climate conditions are well suited to agriculture, although only 25 per cent of arable land is being cultivated.
The Family Farming, Resilience and Markets Project in Upper and Middle Guinea (AgriFARM) will target 65,000 households involved in family farming in 15 prefectures of the Upper Guinea and Middle Guinea regions. These are the poorest parts of the country, with poverty rates of 67.5 per cent and 55.4 per cent, respectively. Critical target groups are women and young people, who will account for 30 per cent and 40 per cent of beneficiaries, respectively.
AgriFARM aims to sustainably increase these households' incomes, build their resilience to external shocks such as climate change, and improve their nutritional status and their access to local, urban and regional markets. To achieve this aim, the project will train 30,000 smallholders in improved resilient cropping techniques, and 10,000 farmers will receive agricultural production kits. The project will also support 50 producers' organizations in their efforts to strengthen the market services provided to their members, as well as provide financing for agricultural and rural entrepreneurship.
AgriFARM will also rehabilitate 600 km of rural roads and sections of national highways in packed earth, construct 21 markets and install 46 management and maintenance structures for markets and rural tracks. It will set up 21 public-private partnerships for sustainable market management and provide technical and financial support for 2,000 rural businesses.
