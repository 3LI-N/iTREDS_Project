IADP’s goal is to contribute to poverty reduction and food and nutrition security in rural households. The project’s development objective is to enhance smallholder agricultural production and productivity in a sustainable and climate-resilient manner and to improve rural livelihoods. 
IADP will directly benefit some 60,000 rural households, i.e. more than 300,000 people, of which 40 per cent will be women and 40 per cent youth.
Priority beneficiaries will include: rural small-scale farmers involved in subsistence agriculture; farmers and young people interested in establishing farmers’ associations or cooperatives, or available to pilot micro enterprises; women; and youth (18–35 years), including demobilized soldiers.
