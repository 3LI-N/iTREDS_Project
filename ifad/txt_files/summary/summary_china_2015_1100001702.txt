The overall goal of the Qinghai Liupan Mountain Area Poverty Reduction project is to contribute to achieving sustainable and equitable poverty reduction while improving the livelihoods of rural households in Qinghai Province. The project's development objective is to sustainably increase the income of poor and vulnerable rural households residing in the following seven counties in the Liupan mountain area situated in the eastern part of Qinghai Province: Huangzhong, Huangyuan, Minhe, Ledu, Huzhu, Hualong and Xunhua.
The project will achieve its development objectives by:
Enhancing agriculture and livestock productivity, focusing on high-value/locally-featured products
Increasing opportunities for farmers to access markets by linking them to improved cooperatives and enterprises
Strengthening vulnerable groups' capacity to engage in off-farm income-generating activities
Providing better ecosystem services through sustainable land resources management.
The IFAD-funded project will benefit approximately 128,000 poor and vulnerable rural households living in 683 poor villages amongst which are ethnic minorities accounting for about 31% of the total population in the province and 47% of the total population in the project area.
