The Samoa Agriculture &amp; Fisheries Productivity and Marketing Project (SAFPROM) came into force in October 2019. The project aims to increase the productivity and access to markets by selected producers, to improve management of targeted productive natural resources and, to provide an immediate response to the Eligible Crisis or Emergency". The target group includes livestock and crop farmers, fisher people, and processors. The project will also support appropriate farmersâ€™ organizations and micro, small and medium Enterprises in the farming and fishing subsectors and their value chains, to improve the productivity and linkages to markets.
While SAFPROM has national coverage, activities targeting mixed tree crop systems shall be focused in Savai'i, the second most populated of Samoa's four islands.
IFAD and the World Bank will be applying integrated approach to harmonize implementation - maximising complementarities and streamlining execution, while drawing on the comparative advantages of the two institutions.
SAFPROM will include an emphasis on improving livelihoods of subsistence and semi-commercial family farms, by introducing climate-resilient solutions that combine production of nutritious foods with increased productivity in perennial crops that increase smallholder incomes. Special focus will be given to subsistence and semi-commercial farmers, particularly youth and women, who belong to some of the poorer segments of the population.
