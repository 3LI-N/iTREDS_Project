The goal of the SLRP is to contribute to improved and resilient livelihoods among the targeted rural communities. The programme development objective is to empower communities to participate in decision-making processes that will recover agriculture livelihoods, build household resilience and promote stability.
Intervention area and geographic targeting criteria. SSLRP will be implemented in three states and five counties: Eastern Equatoria (Magwi and Torit); Central Equatoria (Kajo Keji and Terekeka) and Jonglei (Bor). Targeting is guided by: food production corridors; high numbers of returnees; potential to build on previous IFAD investments and other development partners; and stability, accessibility and low risk of future conflict.
