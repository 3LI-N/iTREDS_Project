The projectâ€™s objective is to sustainably increase productivity of rural youth, enterprises and the rural economy, thus contributing to the goal of reduced poverty and enhanced food security.
Low productivity contributes to the increasing income gap between urban and rural areas, outmigration and the persistence of multidimensional poverty. SAAMBAT will contribute to the three strategic objectives (SOs) of the results-based country strategic opportunities programme (COSOP), both directly and through synergies with the Accelerating Inclusive Markets for Smallholders (AIMS) project and the Agriculture Services Programme for Innovation, Resilience and Extension (ASPIRE).
SO1 (poor smallholders enabled to take advantage of market opportunities) will be achieved through improved physical connectivity to markets and capacity development
SO2 (climate resilience) through infrastructure facilities that are climate-resilient
SO3 (improve poor households' access to strengthened rural services) through vocational training for rural youth and digital services.
