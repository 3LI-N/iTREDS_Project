 
Phase II of Project to Support Development in the Menabe and Melaky Regions (AD2M-II) will build on the achievements of the first phase. AD2M-II aims to improve sustainably the incomes and the food security of smallholder producers of Menabe and Melaky regions in Madagascar.
Through IFAD's Adaptation for Smallholder Agricultural Programme (ASAP), the project will help strengthen and build smallholder farmers resilience to the effects of climate change through the development of irrigated  agriculture including spate-irrigation and the natural resource management approaches.
The implementation of AD2M-II will be expanded from 19 to 44 communes in seven districts in the above mentioned two regions. The project will help the smallholder family farmers to improve the agricultural production and the marketing of their products. It will continue addressing the issue of land tenure security and work to safeguard land rights of the smallholder farmers so that they can investment more in their land and increase their incomes.
Furthermore, the project will build the capacity of the smallholder producers and organize them in groups to be able to better negotiate and get better price for their products. AD2M-II will also establish eight new credit unions to provide financial services in particular credits to the smallholder producers.
A total of 57,000 rural households composed of smallholder agricultural producers and rural economic initiatives promoters will benefit AD2M-II. The project will reach 35,000 new rural households and will continue to work with the 22,000 households who are already benefitting from the phase I.
