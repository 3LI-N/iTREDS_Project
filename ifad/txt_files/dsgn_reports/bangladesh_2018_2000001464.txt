Executive Summary1 
1. 
Background. Bangladesh is a lower middle-income country with medium but declining rates 
of  poverty  among  its  160  million  people.  Sustained  economic  growth  along  with  steady  agricultural 
improvement has been fundamental to this reduction. Sustainability of growth, particularly agricultural 
growth is, however particularly vulnerable to climate change. Given that the agriculture sector remains 
fundamentally  important  to  the  country’s  prosperity  and  it  utilises  three-quarters  of  the  scarce  land 
space  of  Bangladesh  and  supports  the  livelihoods  of  the  majority  of  the  population,  it  is  passing 
through  some  immediate  challenges  in  promoting  sustainable  development.  The  challenges  include 
continuing to increase production and achieve recognizable quality standards despite loss of land to 
other uses and climate change.  
2. 
Rural poverty. The proportion of the population living under $1.25 a day fell from 49 percent 
to 24.8 percent between 2000 and 20152, effectively lifting millions of people out of poverty during the 
period. Overall poverty has declined during the last decade. However, poverty in rural areas remains 
around  363percent  and  has  not  declined  as  fast  as  in  urban  areas.  Additionally,  the  proportion  of 
people living in extreme poverty in rural areas is still three times higher than in urban areas. 
3. 
Women  and  Youth.  Women  are  particularly  affected  by  poverty,  as  they  have  fewer 
opportunities for employment than men and bear the responsibility of caring for their families. With a 
‘demographic dividend’ of young adults entering the labour market in the country, rural youth may be 
more attracted by labour or employment migration to the urban areas, as they are among those who 
find difficult to be involved in agriculture due to the lack of assets and skills. In general, the youth are 
motivated and dynamic; inclusive and tailor-made measures can turn them into viable socio-economic 
actors. Needs of female and male youth will be specifically prioritised. 
4. 
Food and nutrition security. Rural poverty is closely linked to food security. For the average 
rural  household,  about  71  percent  of  calories  come  from  rice4.  In  the  last  20  years,  consumption  of 
cereals  (including  rice)  decreased,  in  absolute  and  relative  terms,  and  average  per  capita 
consumption  of  all  other  food  groups  increased,  indicating  improved  dietary  diversity.  However, 
progress in diet diversification was slower in rural areas compared to urban areas. 
5. 
Project  area.  In  Bangladesh,  24.8  percent  of  the  population  are  living  below  the  poverty 
line, with Barisal Division in Southern Region having the highest number of poor people (39.4percent). 
According  to  the  2008  agriculture  census,  there  were  about  3.1  million  farming  households  in 
southern Bangladesh, with 2.7 million rated as smallholders. The region is susceptible to exogenous 
shocks,  which  have  the  greatest  impact  on  poor  people,  including  cyclones  and  storm  surges,  land 
erosion, limited livelihood opportunities, resource degradation, salinization, flooding and water logged 
soils.  
6. 
of Bangladesh, 250 unions will be selected based on the targeting criteria. 
The project will be implemented in 11 districts covering 30 upazilas in the Southern Region

Target  group  and  targeting  strategy.  The  total  population  is  more  than  7,000,000  in  the 
target 30 upazilas of  11  project districts, representing more than  1,246,000 households.  The project 
will  directly  benefit  at  least  250,000  rural  households.  The  selection  of  project  beneficiaries  will  be 
undertaken based on an inclusive targeting strategy focusing on landless, marginal and small farmers, 
with  up  to  80  percent  of  beneficiaries  coming  from  these  categories.  Youth  will  constitute  up  to  20 
percent  of  beneficiaries  and  women  participation  will  target  at  least  30  percent  involvement.  The 
Project will be implemented over a period of six years. 
8. 
The project will take farmer groups as its entry point for support to enhance production and 
value  chain  development  in  the  project  areas.  The  project  will  focus  on  strengthening  agriculture 
competitiveness,  strengthening  sustainable  technical  support  services/facilities,  identification  of 
market  opportunities  and  linking  these  to  an  applied  research,  development  and  extension 
programme  to  support  small  farmers,  improving  access  to  income  opportunities  of  high  value  crops 
through multi-stakeholder platforms, developing market linkages, and supporting individual and group 
organizational capacity to participate in agricultural value chains. 
9. 
Project  goal is to contribute to Bangladesh’s agriculture smallholders’ responsiveness and 
competitiveness  in  high  value  crops  (HVC 5)  production  and  marketing  of  fresh  and/or  processed 
products.

Project objective 
Duration. 
11. 
The Project will be implemented over a period of six years. SACP will adopt 
a ‘push-pull’ strategy to achieve the project objective. It will enhance the capacity  of targeted farmers 
to  address  their  barriers  to  entry  into  the  market  system  (i.e.  push  strategy)  and  facilitate  the 
development  of  a  more  inclusive  market  system  (i.e.  pull  strategy). While  Component  1  focuses  on 
making  farmers  more  productive  in  producing  high  value  and  high-demanded  crops  through 
accessing improved production knowledge and technology, Component 3 supports in improving their 
access  to  irrigation  water.  The  produced  goods  need  to  be  marketed  in  a  competitive  manner  by 
conforming  to  buyers’  requirement  where  Component  2  steps  in  and  builds  producers’  capacity 
accordingly. 
Components.  The  project  will  support  production  enhancement, 
12. 
identify  market 
opportunities  for  both  fresh  and  processed  products,  value  added  post-harvest  management,  build 
competitiveness  in  HVCs  to  move  households  from  subsistence  farming  into  commercial  farming 
through three technical components supported by a project management component. They are: 
- 
- 
- 
Component 1 - Enhanced production of HVC and technology adoption 
Component 2 – Processing and marketing of HVC 
Component 3 – Climate resilient surface water management 
13. 
The  project  also  builds  on  the  assumption  that  with  the  opening  of  the  Padma  bridge  in 
2018, many farmers of the southern districts will have increased opportunities to sell their products to 
Dhaka  markets  (high  value  crops,  vegetables,  legumes  and  fruits),  the  shortened  transit  times  will 
expand the opportunities for high value fresh produce that is properly picked, packed and transported 
and  where the project can  play a significant role  in improving current practices.  The focus will be to 
enhance  production  quantity  and  quality  through  appropriate  productive  infrastructures,  quality 
agriculture inputs and training of farmers and value chain actors, as well as, linking farmers and their 
groups  to  private  dealers  and  traders  to  enhance  fair  contract  farming 6  and  postharvest  and 
processing contracts.

Component  1  -Enhanced  production  of  HVC  and  technology  adoption.  The  objective  of 
Component 1 will be the identification and prioritisation of appropriate VCs for smallholder investment 
and  associated key research gaps that need to be filled through on-farm research.   The purpose of 
the component is to develop the capacities for linking farmers to markets. This component will support 
the testing, evaluation  and adoption  of new technologies  and management practices by smallholder 
farmers  to  enhance  their  production  of  HVCs  that  have  identified  market  opportunities.  This 
component will contribute to developing agricultural competitiveness linked to market demands by: (i) 
assessing  the  market  demand  for  HVC  that  can  be  produced  in  the  south,  (ii)  identifying  research 
demands for evaluation of new cropping systems, new crops and/or new varieties and improved post-
harvest management storage options, (ii) strengthened research-extension and private sector service 
provision,  and  (iii)  organizing  producers  and  marketing  groups  to  form  greater  scale  and  bargaining 
power.  
15. 
Component  2  -  Processing  and  marketing  of  HVC.    This  component  will  support  small 
holders  to  access  market  in  a  more  efficient  manner  through  creating  a  conducive  business 
environment for private sector to reach them. In parallel, promising rural agro-enterprises (individual 
farmer,  farmer  groups  and/or  rural  entrepreneurs)  will  be  assisted  to  add  value  to  primary  products 
and  penetrate  market  through  value-added  products.  Besides,  village-level  food  processing  will  be 
promoted  to  encourage  nutrition  and  food-safety  along  the  value  chains.   Value  addition  will  be 
transport  of  agricultural 
through 
commodities.  Activities  will  focus  on  (i) capacity  building  of  DAMs  (ii)  developing  a  demand-driven 
extension  approach  within  DAE  and  DAM  and  by  engaging  private  sector,  (iii)  linking  with  private 
sector  buyers  (v)  developing  opportunities  for  village-level  food  processing,  and  (vi)  developing 
existing and potential rural enterprises’ ability to manage sustainable rural agro-enterprises.  
improved  post-harvest  practices,  processing,  storage,  and 
16. 
Component  3  -  Climate  Resilient  Surface  Water  Management.    The  activities  under 
component 3  will support  households interested in  increasing their productivity  and  diversification to 
HVCs with water infrastructure that will provide supplemental or full season water access, through a 
range  of  investments  in  water  storage  and  provision  to  cropland,  with  associated  capacity 
development  for  households  and  groups  to  manage  this  water  infrastructure.    All  activities  in  this 
Component  will  be  closely  associated  and  enhance  initiatives  of  value  addition  under  Component  1 
and 2 – the location and scale of interventions will depend on identified and prioritised food production 
and  cash  crop  production  activities  and  their  need  for  supplemental  and  full  crop  season  irrigation. 
Considering  the  experience  and  capacity  of  minor  irrigation  and  drainage  development,  the 
Bangladesh Agriculture Development Corporation (BADC) is  proposed to implement  activities under 
component  3.  The  BADC  has  a  well-organized  irrigation  division  headed  by  Chief  Engineer  (GOB 
grade  II  official).  The  activities  under  Component  3.2  (institutional  support/capacity  building)  will  be 
outsourced  through  competitive  bidding  where  applicable.  Some  short-term  consultancy  provisions 
have  been  proposed  for  ensuring  sustainable  water  user  groups  formation  and  community 
participation in O & M in line with the participatory water management rule, environmental aspects in 
water management. 
17. 
Implementation  arrangement. The overall responsibility for SACP will be assumed by the 
Ministry  of  Agriculture  (MoA),  which  is  the  implementing  ministry.  The  Project  will  be  implemented 
under  the  overall  direction  of  a  Project  Steering  Committee  (PSC).  A  Project  Implementation 
Committee (PIC) will be formed to provide technical guidance and bring in synergy with stakeholders 
and  partners  other  than  the  MoAs.  The  PIC  will  play  the  role  of  technical  exchange  platform  and 
synergy building among different development projects, where good practices and lessons learnt can 
be  drawn  to  support  the  SACP  implementation  at  operational  level,  and  shared  for  cross-benefits. 
Structure  of  operational  management  and  coordination  will  be  established  along  the  DAE  vertical 
structure from central to the Union, with DAE, DAM, BADC, and BARI participation at applicable levels 
where available, and managerial and technical officers appointed from respective agencies.  
18. 
Project Office. The implementing ministry will establish a SACP Project Office by appointing 
a  Project  Director  in  charge  of  the  SACP  operational  management  and  coordination.  The  Project 
x 
People’s Republic of Bangladesh 
Smallholder Agricultural Competitiveness Project (SACP) 
Final project design report 
Office will include a management team of government-deputed officers and support staffs provided by 
the  government,  and  a  technical  team  of  externally  recruited  experts  funded  by  the  Project.  The 
Project  Office  will  be  headed  by  the  Project  Director  and  supported  by  Component  Directors 
seconded  respectively  from  the  implementing  line  agencies  of  DAE,  BADC,  DAM  and  BARI  .  The 
Project Director at the Project Office will assume the overall responsibility for project management and 
coordination.  An  Operational  Support  Team  will  be  recruited  through  external  and  open  process  to 
assist  the  PD.  The  Project  Coordinators  will  also  have  staffs  to  manage  and  operate  day  to  day 
activities  including  financial  management,  M&E  and  Knowledge  Management,  procurement  and 
project coordination. 
19. 
District Coordination Unit (DCU). A district Coordination Unit will be established as technical 
hub and composed of one lead technical officer from each of the District DAE, DAM, BARI and BADC, 
and  other  necessary  staff  (junior  level  experts)  required  in  all  the  project  districts.  The  DCU  will  be 
embedded in the respective District DAE office. Under the over direction of the Project Director at the 
Project Office, the DCU will be led by the Deputy Director of District DAE and it will be responsible for 
coordination  of  the  project  activities  implemented  by  the  district  project  line  agencies  and/or  other 
contracted  service  providers,  ensuring  operational  coordination  through  the  structure  of  upazila  and 
union  offices  to  the  grassroots  level,  ensure  the  timely  and  operational  functions  in  the  areas  of 
project financial management, M&E and KM, procurement support and follow-ups, at its own level and 
the  lower  levels.  It  will  collect  physical  and  financial  periodic  progress  reports  from  the  involved 
implementing agencies, maintain district consolidate records, prepare reports and deliver them to the 
Project  Office.  Upazila  and  Union  DAE  Offices’  Participation.  DAE  offices  at  Upazila  and  Union  will 
participate  in  extending  the  operational  coordination  from  the  DCU  to  the  target  groups.  Upazila 
Agricultural  Officer  and  Union  Sub-Assistant  Agriculture  Office  (SAAO)  will  be  the  focal  persons  for 
the  implementation  coordination.  DAM  will  engage  through  outsourcing  Marketing  Facilitators  at 
upazila  level to  work with the farmer groups in the unions. In  each union, three lead farmers will be 
selected from the selected farmer groups and they will be engaged on a basis of daily remuneration in 
accordance with actual support to the field work of upazila officers of DAE, BADC and DAM marketing 
facilitators. 
20. 
Private  sector.  The  project  will  create  a  congenial  environment  for  Public,  Private  and 
Producers Partnership (4Ps) so that private inputs companies, agro-processors, wholesalers, traders 
and  exporters  could  also  assess  potentialities  of  HVCs  in  southern  delta,  their  business  expansion, 
market  linkages  and  work together  with  government  agencies  for  investing  with  the  SACP  producer 
and marketing groups. Private enterprises, cooperatives and farmers’ organizations engage in supply 
of goods and services, marketing or related fields will be called to support the project implementation 
as service providers. This is crucial in institutional capacity building, as there would be a closer market 
access  to  economic  opportunities  by  building  commercial  bridges  between  HVC  producers  and 
consumer  groups  using  instruments  such  as  market  information,  training,  joint  pilot  programmes, 
contract farming, applied technologies.  
Technical Assistance. 
21. 
A  separate  fund  of  USD  3  million  from  the  IFAD  SACP 
financing  will  be  used  for  Technical  Assistance  (TA)  by  FAO  to  the  SACP  Project  Office  and 
implementing agencies.  The fund  will  be managed  and implemented  by  FAO Bangladesh  under the 
direction  of  and  in  agreement  with  the  Project  Director,  with  support  from  FAO  Country  Office  and 
technical units in the Region and from HQ.  
22. 
The  TA  component  will  provide  technical  assistance  (national  and  international)  and 
capacity  building  targeted  at  specific  areas  that  will  benefit  from  strengthening  among  government 
project implementation partners. TA activities will concentrate on: a) training of trainer’s activities and 
follow-up  coaching,  b)  assisting  the  development  of  a  benefit  M&E  system  and  c)  support  to 
background  studies.  Expected  Outcome:  The  capacity  of  implementing  agencies  has  been 
strengthened  to  successfully  implement  the  Smallholder  Agriculture  Competitiveness  Project  and 
reach expected SACP results.

M&E  and  knowledge  management. Results-based  management approach  will ensure all 
processes  and  activities  of  the  project  are  in  line  with  the  project  goal,  objectives  and  expected 
outcomes.  As  part  of  this  approach,  planning,  monitoring  and  evaluation  will  be  results-oriented  to 
enable  tracking  of  progress  towards  the  project  outputs,  outcomes  and  sustainability.  Learning  and 
experience sharing will be the main part of knowledge management. 
26. 
Summary  benefits  and  economic  analysis.  The  SACP  economic  and  financial  cost 
benefit  analysis  estimated  that  the  project  investments  in  enhanced  production  of  high-value  crops, 
processing  and  marketing  of  high-value  crops,  and  surface  water  management  would  result  in 
agricultural diversification and productivity increase. The analysis estimated the following benefits: (1) 
increased  production  and  productivity  of  high  value-added  crops  (non-paddy  crops);  (2)  improved 
agricultural  technology  and  practices  that  increase  productivity;  (3)  improved  water  security  for 
agricultural production to reduce water availability risk due to salinization and seasonal fluctuation; (4) 
improved  marketing,  post-harvest  management,  and  value  addition  (agro-processing);  (5)  labor  and 
job creation.    
27. 
The  project  as  a  whole  was  estimated  to  have  an  economic  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  of  17.6 
percent, and the net present value (NPV) was around USD 43.99 million. The economic return would 
be robust, and the return could be maintained above the hurdle rate of 10% even with a cost increase 
and benefit decrease of 20% as well as a delay of benefit generation for 2 years.   
28. 
Adherence  to  IFAD  policies  and  national  policies.  The  SACP  is  well  in  line  with  the 
national  strategies  in  poverty  alleviation,  agriculture  and  rural  development  and  climate  change 
adaptation.  The  Project  responds  to  the  Government’s  Southern  Master  Plan  by  channelling  its 
investments  fostering  the  responsiveness  and  competitiveness  of  rural  smallholders  in  horticulture 
HVCs  in  Southern  Bangladesh.  The  Project  objective  and  interventions  refer  directly  to  the 
overarching  goal  of  the  IFAD  Strategic  Framework  2016  –  2025,  aligning  its  investments  with 
transforming  the  agricultural  sector  towards  higher,  sustainable  and  climate-smart  productivity, 
profitability,  commercialization,  connecting  the  smallholder  farmer  and  rural  households  to  market 
opportunities  and  improved  support  services  to  generate  more  income  for  improved  livelihood,  food 
and nutrition security. 
29. 
SECAP. The environmental and social risk of the project falls under the category B in view 
of  little  or  negligible  adverse  impact  potential  on  natural  and  social  environment,  while  it  also  falls 
under category ‘High’ regarding climate change risks. 
30. 
Risk  identification  and  mitigation.  The  Project  design  aligns  the  IFAD  investments  with 
the  Government’s  development  policies  and  strategies  in  poverty  alleviation,  agriculture  and  rural 
development;  it  is  based  on  the  development  needs  and  priorities  that  related  stakeholders  and 
beneficiaries  identified  and  proposed.  Risks  associated  to  the  Project  should  therefore  relate  to  the 
uncertainties caused by the climate changes, and the fast-changing socio-economic environment, or 
being  of  operational  nature  mostly.  Several  risk  factors  have  been  identified  and  reviewed  in 
accordance  to  their  coherence  to  the  Project.  Some  of  them  are  closely  associated  to  the  project 
implementation, others more on a continued basis. Related mitigation measures have been proposed.

Final project design report 
Strategic context and rationale 
A.  Country and rural development context 
1. 
Socio-economic  profile.  Bangladesh  is  a  lower  middle-income  country  with  high—but 
declining rates of poverty among its 160 million people. Sustained economic growth was fundamental 
to this reduction: from 2000 to 2016, Bangladesh averaged GDP growth of 5.72 percent, reaching the 
highest  in  2016  at  7.05  percent.  Bangladesh  made  strong  gains  in  education  and  healthcare  during 
that decade, and it achieved most of its MDG targets. It is transforming from an agrarian-base to an 
industrialised economy, with a ‘demographic dividend’ of young adults entering the labour market (50 
percent  of  the  population  is  under  the  age  of  25).  In  addition  to  demographics,  increasing 
urbanisation,  growing  middle  class  affluence,  and  population  growth  all  impact  Bangladesh’s 
economic prospects8. 
2. 
Vulnerability  to  climate  change.  Bangladesh is particularly vulnerable to climate change. 
Two-thirds of the country lies at less than five meters above sea level, making it one of the most flood-
prone countries in the world. Severe flooding during the monsoon season causes significant damage 
to crops and property, with major adverse impacts on rural livelihoods. According to the Third National 
Communication  of  Bangladesh  to  UNFCCC,  the  INDC  and  the  BCCSAP  have  recognized  high 
vulnerability  of Bangladesh’s coastal  zone and  its inhabitants,  especially smallholder farmers. There 
are two proven saline tolerant paddy varieties widely grown in the target area, Other than these paddy 
varieties,  there  is  a  dearth  of  information  regarding  other  crop  varieties  and  their  risk  from,  or 
tolerance to salinity thresholds, inundation thresholds, etc. 
3. 
In  2017,  monsoon  floods  have  affected  around  5.7  million  people  in  27  districts.  An 
estimated  4,680,000  hectares  of  cultivated  land  are  damaged.  The  northern  region  of  Bangladesh 
remains  particularly  vulnerable 9 .  Such  repeated  natural  disasters  have  raised  challenges  for 
sustainable agricultural development in the country, confirming the necessity of investing in integrated 
and  diversified  agricultural  development  in  Southern  Bangladesh  with  enhanced  production  and 
commercialization of high-value crops and climate-resilient water management. 
4. 
Rural and agriculture sector. The immediate challenge facing agriculture in Bangladesh is 
to  continue  to  increase  production  and  productivity,  with  an  increasing  and  more  middle-class 
population. While industrial sectors such as manufacturing have been the main drivers for economic 
expansion  in  Bangladesh,  agriculture  remains  fundamentally  important  to  the  country’s  prosperity. 
Agriculture  occupies  three-quarters  of  the  scarce  land  area  of  Bangladesh  and  supports  the 
livelihoods of the majority of the population. The contribution of agriculture to Bangladesh’s economic 
output  declined  over  the  past  decade,  but  crops,  livestock,  forestry,  fisheries  still  constitute  15.33 
(BER  2016)  percent  of  GDP.  The  rural  non-farm  sector,  accounts  for  another  36  percent  of  GDP. 
About  67  percent  of  the  population  live  in  rural  areas  and  over  45.1  (BER  2016)  percent  of  the 
country’s total labour force are engaged in agriculture, which also contributes a quarter of total export 
earnings.  
5. 
Agriculture Trade. While the volume of agricultural exports remained relatively stable during 
the past five  years, significant export  increases were seen in fishery products. Bangladesh imported 
USD 39.2 billion of goods in 2015. Food grains (rice and wheat), edible oil and oilseeds, milk and milk 
products,  spices,  sugar  and  coconut  oil  were  the  main  agricultural  imports.  The  value  of  imported 
edible  oil  and  oilseeds  surged  since  2011,  while  rice  imports  declined  due  to  increasing  domestic 
production. During the last five years imports into Bangladesh increased at an annualized rate of 16 
percent10.

Final project design report 
6. 
Rural  poverty,  food  and  nutrition  security. The proportion of the population living under 
$1.25  a  day  fell  from  49  percent  to  24.8  percent  between  2000  and  2015.  Overall  poverty  has 
therefore declined during the last decade. However, poverty in rural areas remains around 35 percent 
and has not declined as fast as in urban areas, with the proportion of people living in extreme poverty 
in rural areas being three times higher than in urban areas. 
7. 
Smallholder farmers. The government classifies farm sizes as follows: (i) Landless – no farm 
holdings; owning no land or less than 0.05 acres, (ii) Small farmer, owning 0.05 to 2.49 acres of land, 
(iii) Medium farmer, owning 2.50 to 7.49 acres of land, and (iv) Larger farmer, owning more than 7.50 
acres  of  land.  According  to  the  2008  agriculture  census,  there  were  about  3.1  million  farming 
households in southern Bangladesh, with 2.7 million rated as smallholders. This area had the largest 
concentration of poor people (26.7 percent) compared to the Bangladesh average (17.6 percent). The 
region is susceptible to exogenous shocks, which have the greatest impact on poor people, including 
cyclones  and  storm  surges,  land  erosion,  limited  livelihood  opportunities,  resource  degradation, 
salinization, flooding and water logged soils.  
8. 
Women.  There  are  fewer  opportunities  for  employment  for  women  than  men  and  women 
bear  the  majority  of  the  responsibility  of  caring  for  their  families  and  are  particularly  affected  by 
poverty.  With  increasing  out-migration  of  male  rural  labour  to  urban  areas  for  employment, 
feminization  of  rural  labour  and  agriculture  has  occurred.  Women  are  actively  involved  in  the 
production,  processing  and  trading  of  higher  value  crops,  such  as  vegetables  and  spices.  Women 
constitute  about  49  percent  of  the  total  who  are  the  most  disadvantaged  and  vulnerable  population 
segment. More than two thirds of the people under the poverty line are women.  A growing proportion 
of  households  are  headed  by  women  –  either  temporarily  where  men  have  migrated  for  work,  or 
permanently through death of a husband, divorce or abandonment. 
Youth11.  With  a  ‘demographic  dividend’  of  young  adults  entering  the  labour  market  in  the 
9. 
country, rural youth may be more attracted by labour or employment migration to the urban areas, as 
they are among those  who find  it difficult to be  involved  in  agriculture due to the lack of assets and 
skills. In general, the youth are motivated and dynamic; inclusive and tailor-made measures can turn 
them  into  viable  socio-economic  actors.  Needs  of  female  and  male  youth  will  be  specifically 
prioritized. 
10. 
Food and nutrition security. Rural poverty is closely linked to food security. For the average 
rural  household,  about  71  percent  of  calories  come  from  rice,  with  poorer  households  more  rice 
dependent than higher income households. The other differences between the diets of the poor and 
other  income  groups  are  consumption  levels  of  oils,  milk,  eggs,  meat,  and  fish.  Although  fish  is  the 
main  protein  source  for  all  income  groups,  only  about  50  percent  of  extremely  poor  households 
consume  fish  on  a  daily  basis,  compared  to  65  percent  for  the  non-poor.  Only  6  percent  of  poor 
households reported consuming meat on a given day in 2010 compared to about 13 percent for  non-
poor households12. In the last 20 years, consumption of cereals (including rice) decreased, in absolute 
and relative terms, and average per capita consumption of all other food groups increased, indicating 
improved  dietary  diversity.  However,  progress  in  diet  diversification  was  slower  in  rural  areas 
compared to urban areas. 
11. 
Government  policies.  Relevant  government  policies  align  with  the  objectives  of  Vision 
2021  to  transform  Bangladesh  into  a  middle-income country  by  2021,  eliminate  food  deficiency  and 
attain self-sufficiency in food production; and the Seventh Five Year Plan (2016-2020) which focuses 
on:  (1)  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction;  (2)  inclusiveness;  and  (3)  sustainable  development 
resilient  to  climate  change  and  natural  disasters.  Within  this  plan,  the  government  set  ambitious

population).

Agriculture  Policy.  With  regards  to  agriculture,  the  Seventh  Five  Year  Plan  aims  to 
accelerate the transformation from semi-subsistence farming to agriculture commercialisation through 
productivity  gains,  diversification,  value  addition  and  agro-processing.  The  plan  supports 
diversification into higher value-added activities and employment opportunities for surplus agriculture 
labourers into non-farm activities. The plan aims to integrate environmental, climate and disaster risk 
reduction considerations into all development assistance projects, government budgetary allocations 
and implementation processes in order to ensure sustainable and equitable growth and development. 
Within  this  policy  framework,  the  National  Agriculture  Policy  aims  to  encourage  sustainable  and 
profitable  agricultural  production,  through;  the  development  and  dissemination  of  new  technologies; 
increased productivity; employment and income generation; commercialisation; adaptation to climate 
change; marketing; enhancement of quality to meet export standards; agro-processing; encouraging 
production  of  diversified,  nutritious  crops;  and  empowering  women.  The  Government  has  been 
promoting  agricultural  development  in  Southern  Bangladesh  in  order  to  reduce  the  pressure  and 
dependency on agriculture in the Northern Region. 
13. 
The  Southern  Master  Plan  (2013–2021).  The  Master  Plan  for  Agricultural  Development  in 
the Southern Region of Bangladesh published in 2013 aims at transferring the Southern delta into a 
vibrant  economy  and  helps  putting  the  country  on  the  trajectory  to  middle  income  status.  The 
objective of the  Plan  is to  provide a road map for integrated  agricultural  development in the coastal 
districts  of  Bangladesh  to  achieve  sustainable  food  security,  poverty  reduction  and  livelihood 
development  for  the  poor  and  particularly  focuses  on,  among  others:  (i)  increasing  agricultural 
productivity,  (ii)  improving  water  management,  (iii)  developing  climate  resilient  infrastructure  and 
improving surface water irrigation system in order to achieve enhanced productivity, balanced growth, 
value chain management, increased employment and improved access to food and nutrition through 
appropriate institutional arrangement and sustainable resource management. 
IFAD-MoA partnership. 
14. 
IFAD  and  MoA  have  a  long  history  of  partnership  and 
collaboration;  the  first  IFAD-assisted  project  directly  implemented  by  MoA  was  the  Fertilizer  Sector 
Programme  (FSP,  1979  –  1984,  IFAD  loan  USD  21.4  million),  followed  by  the  Marginal  and  Small 
Farm  Systems  Crop  Intensification  Project  (MSFSCIP,  1986  –  1994,  IFAD  loan  USD  5.6  million), 
Netrakona Integrated Agricultural Production and Water Management Project (NIAPWMP, 1993-1999, 
IFAD loan USD8.9 million), Agricultural Diversification and Intensification Project (ADIP, 1997  – 2004, 
IFAD  loan  USD  18.9  million),  National  Agricultural  Technology  Project  (NATP-1,  2007  -2014,  IFAD 
loan USD 19.5 million). The ongoing National Agriculture Technology Project (NATP II) is implemented 
by  MoA  under  a  partnership  with  World  Bank  and  IFAD.  With  SACP,  IFAD  is  renewing  its  direct 
partnership with MoA in support of the agricultural development in Bangladesh. 
B.  Rationale 
15. 
In Bangladesh, 24.8 percent of the population are living below the poverty line ($1.25 a day), 
with  Barisal  Division  in  Southern  Region  having  the  highest  number  of  poor  people  (39.4  percent). 
The  absolute  rural  poverty  in  the  Southern  divisions  of  Barisal,  Chittagong  and  Khulna  averages 
33.7percent. The primary rationale for the project’s development investment is therefore the existence 
of  continued  and  wide-spread  poverty  in  the  Southern  Region,  where  21  percent  (30  million)  of  the 
total  population  of  the  country  live.  Despite  significant  improvements  in  rural  development  in  many 
areas,  challenges  remain  to  be  addressed  in  the  South  with  increasing  population,  climate  change, 
salinity intrusion, aging polders, tidal submergence, continued erratic and unpredictable monsoon and 
severe and longer draughts. 
16. 
There is significant potential in Southern Bangladesh for increasing  production, productivity 
sustainability  through  more  efficient  utilisation  of  surface  water  and  adoption  of  crops  specifically 
adapted to southern agro-ecological zones. The MoA’s Southern Master Plan targets the opportunities 
and challenges for increasing food production in the region and the necessary investments to fulfil the 
agriculture  potential  of  the  area.  However,  it  will  take  significant  time  and  resources  to  reengineer 
MoA’s  service  structure  in  Southern  Bangladesh  to  meet  with  the  challenges  in  this  process  of 
3

agricultural  transformation.  The  project  will  support  the  speeding  up  the  MoA’s  institutional  re-
engineering in the South and provide operational support to the MoA. 
Bangladesh ranked second in the 2016 Climate Change Vulnerability Index13 and it will likely 
17. 
suffer more from climate change by 2025 than any other country. Rainfall is expected to increase by 
10-15 percent during monsoon seasons by 2030 and 27 percent by 2075; rising sea level is expected 
to  inundate  120,000  square  km  by  2050;  14  percent  more  of  the  country  may  become  extremely 
prone to floods by 2030; cyclones in the Bay of Bengal will occur more frequently due to increasing 
temperature,  and  the  peak  intensity  of  cyclones  may  increase  by  5-10  percent  (Food  Planning  and 
Monitoring  Unit  (FPMU),  Ministry  of  Food).  Coastal  salinity  problems  will  likely  worsen  as  changing 
rain  patterns  reduce  the  amount  of  dry  season  water  supply  from  upstream  river  sources.  Overall, 
crop production might be reduced by 30 percent by the end of the century; rice production could fall 
by  8  percent,  and  wheat  production  by  32  percent  by  2050  (FPMU  2013).  Winter  crop  production 
would be seriously hampered due to a warmer and drier environment during non-monsoon seasons, 
while moisture stress might force farmers to reduce the area under irrigated rice cultivation. 
18. 
IFAD  has  been  engaged  in  agriculture  and  rural  development  for  40  years  in  Bangladesh, 
with  the  current  COSOP  providing  an  opportunity  for  further  scaling-up  and  enhancing  some  of  the 
best practices and innovations of the ongoing portfolio that have proven to be useful climate change 
adaptation  responses,  as  well  as,  introduction  of  practical  methods  and  technologies  in  sustainable 
production  enhancement,  post-harvest  management,  value  chain  development  and  public-private 
partnership development. IFAD has been collaborating closely with a number of government agencies 
at  all  levels  and  building  an  effective  partnership  with  the  donor  community  in  the  country  since  the 
start  of  its  Country  Programme  in  Bangladesh.  Through  a  direct  partnership  with  MoA  that  is  the 
mandated  agency  for  agriculture  development  in  the  country,  SACP  will  support  the  Government’s 
strategic master plan of transforming agriculture in Southern Bangladesh. 
19. 
The theory of change is premised on a demand-driven approach to project interventions to 
build  and  strengthen  the  responsiveness  and  competitiveness  of  the  smallholder  farmers  in 
production and marketing. The SACP theory of change is based on the hypothesis that:  Smallholder 
producers  and  disadvantaged  groups  involved  in  HVC  enhanced  production,  post-production 
management and marketing  would benefit from being included in a sustainable and profitable way, in 
selected HVC value chains thanks to improved support of extension service and action research, new 
relationship  with  private  sector  actors  to  meet  market  demands  and  improved  access  to  and 
management  of  agricultural  water  and  micro-irrigation  systems,  and  obtain  better  price  premium 
share,  and  contribute  to  the  Master  Plan  for  Agricultural  Development  in  the  Southern  Region  of 
Bangladesh,  which  aims  to  achieve  sustainable  food  security,  poverty  reduction  and  livelihood 
development  through  increased  agricultural  productivity,  improved  surface  water  irrigation  system. 
This will be operationalized by: 
  Facilitating  a  planning  of  project  interventions  driven  by  selected  value  chains  of  HVCs  that 
will improve productivity, incomes and livelihood of farmers in the project area through income 
generating diversification and value addition, and marketing in a changing climate condition; 
  Strategically  building  public-private  sector  partnership  and  stimulate  their  joint  investments, 
and  advice  to  mainstream  the  smallholders  into  selected  agricultural  value  chains  through 
improved    knowledge  of  market  opportunities,  access  to  required  technologies,  benefit  of 
action  research  results  and  good  agricultural  practices,  and  sustainable  surface  water 
management  in  a  manner  that  subsequent  integrated  planning  and  coordination  of  project 
interventions  will  improve  the  match  between  market  demands  and  supply  of  produce  from 
project beneficiaries, and  
  Developing the capacity of service providers at operational level to offer timely and quality 
services to smallholder farmers and their groups participating in HVC development.

The project will therefore support production enhancement, identify market opportunities for 
both fresh and processed products, value added post-harvest management, build competitiveness in 
HVCs to move households from subsistence farming into commercial farming through three technical 
components  supported  by  a  project  management  component.  The  project  also  builds  on  the 
assumption that with the opening of the Padma Bridge in 2018, many farmers of the southern districts 
will  have  increased  opportunities  to  sell  their  products  to  Dhaka  markets  (high  value  crops, 
vegetables,  legumes  and  fruits),  the  shortened  transit  times  will  expand  the  opportunities  for  high 
value fresh produce that is properly picked, packed and transported and where the project can play a 
significant  role  in  improving  current  practices.  The  focus  will  be  to  enhance  production  quantity  and 
quality through appropriate productive infrastructures, quality agriculture inputs and training of farmers 
and value chain actors, as well as, linking farmers and their groups to private dealers and traders to 
enhance fair contract farming14and postharvest and processing contracts 
21. 
Synergies with the on-going projects and other development projects in the country will be 
leveraged  during  SACP  implementation.    For  example,  SACP  can  build  on  the  lessons  from  NATPI 
and  gain  comparative  advantage  from  the  overlapping  areas  with  NATP  II.  According  to  the  field 
observation  during  the  final  design  mission,  implementing  agencies  are  already  working  in 
coordination  with  each  other  and  well  familiar  with  the  NATP.  Some  of  the  district  and  upazila  level 
officers received capacity building from the NATP I. The complimentary areas of investment are on the 
demand-driven  agricultural  research,  climate-smart  technology  transfer  and  practical application  at 
farm  and  market  level,  farm-to-farm  extension,  agro-business  and  agro-processing  development  as 
well as market linkage and collaboration with private-sector service providers. Furthermore, PACE has 
a national coverage in terms of its microenterprise development, value chain and technology adoption 
interventions.  Its  best  practice  and  innovative  features  of  linking  value  chain  development  to  rural 
financial  services  can  be  learned  and  complemented  by  the  presence  of  PACE’s  partner 
organizations,  in  particular  to  SACP's  components  1  and  2  (See  more  detail  about  PACE’s  lessons 
learned in the Appendix 3). SACP and CDSP IV will have a geographic overlapping in Noakhali district 
(2  upazilas)  where  land  settlement,  infrastructure,  agricultural  and  livelihoods  support  and  forestry 
implemented  by  six  implementing  agencies,  including  DAE.  CDSP  IV  and  DAE  have  developed  90 
farmer forums, including in two overlapping upzailas with SACP.

upazilas,  representing  1,246,021  households.  The  project  will  directly  benefit  at  least  250,000  rural 
households  or  1,400,000  people 15 ,  i.e.  one  fifth  of  the  population.  The  selection  of  project 
beneficiaries  will  be  undertaken  based  on  an  inclusive  targeting  strategy  focusing  on  landless, 
marginal  and  small  farmers,  with  up  to  80  percent  of  beneficiaries  coming  from  these  categories. 
Youth will constitute up to 20 percent of beneficiaries and women participation will target at least 30 
percent involvement.  
26. 
The project will take existing or new farmer groups as its entry point, to enhance production 
and value chain development in the project areas. The project will focus on strengthening agriculture 
competitiveness,  strengthening  sustainable  technical  support  services/facilities,  identification  of 
market  opportunities  and  linking  these  to  an  applied  research,  development  and  extension 
programme to support  targeted households, improving access to income opportunities of high value 
crops through multi-stakeholder platforms, developing market linkages, and supporting individual and 
group organizational capacity to participate in agricultural value chains.

B.  Development objective and impact indicators 
Project strategy. 
27. 
Core  elements  of  the  overall  strategy  are  consistent  with  the 
Government’s  Seventh  Five  Year  Plan  (2016–2020),  the  current  National  Agriculture  Policy,  the 
Master Plan for Agricultural Development in the Southern Region of Bangladesh (2013), and IFAD’s 
corporate strategic framework (2016-2025) and the COSOP for Bangladesh, with a focus to: 
- 
- 
Increase  rural  people’s  productive  capacities:  Promoting  access  to  natural  resources, 
agricultural technologies and productive services that lead to enhanced agricultural production 
for improved household food security, improved nutrition and diversified income sources; 
Increase  rural  people’s  benefits  from  market  participation:  Increasing  engagement  of  rural 
households  in  diversified  agro-business  and  employment  opportunities,  rural  producers’ 
organizations,  rural  infrastructure,  that  provide  them  appropriate  support  services,  linkages  to 
markets for improving their livelihoods; 
-  Build adaption capacity of rural livelihoods to climate change and the scaling up of successful 
approaches: developing  and adapting enhanced climate-resilience approaches  and promoting 
the best practices through effective knowledge management  
-  Address gender and youth: to ensure that project activities reach a significant number of poor 
rural women, men and youth and improve their rural livelihoods. 
28. 
Project  goal  – to contribute to  Bangladesh’s agriculture smallholders’ responsiveness and 
competitiveness  in  high  value  crops  (HVC16)  production  and  marketing  of  fresh  and/or  processed 
products. 
29. 
demand-led productivity investments, crop diversification and increased market linkages. 
Project  development  objective  -  to  increase  farmer  incomes  and  livelihood  through 
30. 
The associated key indicators are: 
-  At  least  150,000  beneficiary  households  reporting  >20  percent  income  increased  from  improved 
marketing and diversified agricultural products  
-  At least 50 percentage of households reporting improvements in household asset ownership index  
Duration. 
31. 
In  order  to  achieve  these  objectives  and  considering  the  disparity  of 
development conditions in  the project areas, and time needed to mainstream the landless, marginal 
and  small  farmers  into  organized  production  and  identified  value  chains,  the  Project  will  be 
implemented over a period of six years.  
C.  Outcomes/Components 
32. 
Outcomes  -  smallholders  are  living  in  a  fast-changing  environment  of  agricultural 
transformation,  facing  many  challenges  as  they  try  to  move  out  of  subsistence  farming,  to  become 
much more  commercially  oriented. At an operational  level, this project  will respond by (i) supporting 
demand-drive production at household and farm levels, (ii) creating a more enabling environment for 
agribusiness and, at the same time, directly supporting partnerships between smallholder producers 
and  the  private  sector  agribusinesses,  and  (iii)  supporting  market  linkages  for  increased  price 
premium share for households. Programme outcomes are presented in the Logical Framework. 
33. 
SACP  will  adopt  a  ‘push-pull’  strategy  to  achieve  the  project  objective.  It  will  enhance  the 
capacity  of  targeted  farmers  to  address  their  barriers  to  entry  into  the  market  system  (i.e.  push 
strategy) and facilitate the  development of a more inclusive market system (i.e. pull strategy). While 
Component  1  focuses  on  making  farmers  more  productive  in  producing  high  value  and  high-
demanded  crops  through  accessing  improved  production  knowledge  and  technology,  Component  3 
supports in improving their access to irrigation water. The produced goods need to be marketed in a

competitive  manner  by  conforming  to  buyers’  requirement  where  Component  2  steps  in  and  builds 
producers’ capacity accordingly. 
34. 
Components Synergy. At  the  very  onset,  the  project  will  conduct  a  market-led  research  on 
assessment  and  prioritization  of  HVC  value  chains  which  will  be  the  gateway  for  making  synergies 
among  the  components  associated  with  research,  extension,  marketing  and  major  inputs  (seed  and 
irrigation).  At  inception  stage,  findings  of  this  research  will  showcase  which  value  chains  to  be 
prioritized,  market  and  action  research  to  be  conducted,  technologies  and  inputs  to  be  promoted, 
products  to  be  marketed  by  considering  competitiveness  on  the  top.  Following  this  onset  research, 
public, private, producers partnership (4Ps) consultation will be conducted in each project Upazila for 
further  validation  of  prioritized  HVCs,  constraints  associated  with  varieties,  production,  irrigation, 
market, etc. which finally attributed to make harmony among agencies involved with research (BARI), 
extension (DAE), inputs (BADC) and marketing (DAM) as well as private sectors. Moreover, Farmer 
Producers  and  Marketing  Groups  (FPM  s)  will  be  strengthened  (old  Producer  Groups)  or  mobilized 
(new)  and  4-5  lead  farmers  from  each  PG  will  be  graduated  to  Market-led  Farmers  Field  School 
(MFFS).  The  curriculum  of  MFFS  will  embrace  HVC  production  including  soil  fertility  management, 
good  agriculture  practice  (GAP),  nutrition  and  food  safety,  sustainable  water  management,  post–
harvest  management,  value  addition,  market  linkage,  group  dynamics,  gender  issues,  nutrition-
efficiency etc. The MFFS will play as a catalyst for making synergies among agencies, private sectors 
and components activities. 
Component 1: Enhanced production of HVC and technology adoption 
35. 
The objective of Component 1 will be the identification and prioritisation of appropriate VCs 
for smallholder investment and  associated key research gaps that  need to  be filled through on-farm 
research.  The purpose of the component is to develop the capacities for linking farmers to markets. 
This  component  will  support  the  testing,  evaluation  and  adoption  of  new  technologies  and 
management  practices  by  smallholder  farmers  to  enhance  their  production  of  HVCs  that  have 
identified  market  opportunities.  This  component  will  contribute 
to  developing  agricultural 
competitiveness linked to market demands by: (i) assessing the market demand for HVC that can be 
produced in the south, (ii) identifying research demands for evaluation of new cropping systems, new 
crops and/or new varieties and improved post-harvest management storage options, (ii) strengthened 
research-extension and private sector service provision, and (iii) organizing producers and marketing 
groups to form greater scale and bargaining power.  
36. 
Implementation  strategy:  The  component  will  embrace  market-led  research,  with  sub-
Component  1.1  being  implemented  by  trained  and  capacitated  DAM  and  DAE  staff  at  Upazila  and 
Union levels and sub-Component 1.2 being led by BARI and BADC.  The project will utilize the multi-
stakeholder platform established to better facilitate and validate the identification and prioritisation of 
value  chain.  Involvement  of  the  private  sector  will  be  cross  cutting  and  they  will  be  involved  in 
identification of market opportunities, support to identification of the quality and quantities required by 
different  markets  and  through  input  provision,  postharvest  management  and  marketing  linkages,  as 
well as processing. 
37. 
Synergy: The first activities in sub-Component 1.1 will determine the types of activities and 
scale of interventions for all other sub-components, as the identified HVCs and their associated VCs, 
will lead to the identification of research, extension, postharvest, processing and water infrastructure 
needs, to build profitable and sustainable farm-level investments.  As this is a new way of operating 
for the implementing GoB departments, they will benefit from significant guidance and support under 
the TA component to support these activities and their integration. Multi-stakeholder platforms will play 
an important role at the field level both for component 1 and 2. 
Sub-component 1.1: Assessment of HVCs and group mobilization  
8 
People’s Republic of Bangladesh 
Smallholder Agricultural Competitiveness Project (SACP) 
Final project design report 
38. 
The starting point for project intervention is the  identification,  assessment and prioritisation 
of HVC value chains. At start-up a detailed value chain analysis of horticultural and other high value 
crops  will  be  conducted  for  final  selection  of  potential  HVCs  suitable  for  production  in  the  southern 
delta  of  Bangladesh.  A  community  process  will  identify  existing  groups  and  target  farmers  who  are 
interested  to  invest  in  these  HVCs.  If  new  groups  are  needed,  smallholders  will  be  formed  into 
collaborative Farmer Producer and Marketing (FPM) groups, each with approximately 25 households. 
The  composition  of  the  FPM  groups  will  take  into  consideration  the  planned  focus  on  women  and 
youth  and  most  marginalized  groups,  reflecting  inclusive  targeting  strategies.  Later  FPMs  that  have 
developed capacities and market linkages with buyers will be federated to achieve economies of scale 
and  integrated  into  multi-stakeholder  platforms.    To  reach  the  project  target  groups,  the  following 
activities will be implemented: 
39. 
A  broad  value  chain  mapping  assessment  -  Identification  of  value  chain/manageable  sub-
sector inventory considering the market potential impact area of the project and its life time with the 
greatest potential for growth in small enterprise income and employment will be assessed during the 
inception of the project.  
40. 
Village-level  assessment  and  prioritisation  of  potential  value  chains  –  After  broad  base 
selection  of  HVCs,  village  level  prioritization  exercise  will  select  HVC  smallholder  groups.  This  will 
allow each group to produce potential HVC and create an economy of scale of both inputs needs and 
outputs produced by the members of groups which should attract private sector to sell or buy in bulk. 
41. 
Identification  of  existing  groups  at  the  village  and  union  level.  DAE  has  already  mobilized 
farmers groups under different projects, so the first activity is to conduct a mapping of existing groups, 
determine  which  groups  can  be  worked  with  under  SACP  and  what  level  of  capacity  building  and 
support they would need. Where needed SACP will form new groups. All groups will be mobilized by 
the field extension workers using different participatory tools like wealth ranking, social and resource 
mapping, membership profiling, etc. The groups should be inclusive, considering age and gender. For 
both already created and newly formed groups, it will be essential to involve young farmers from the 
early  mobilization  phase.  They  will  serve  as  catalysts  to  further  disseminate  new  technologies  and 
their level of ownership of the potential results will need to be thought through the groups’ formation 
process.  
42. 
Engagement of production facilitators – In each project union, the SAAOs will mobilize new 
groups  and  strengthen  old  groups.  They  will  work  as  Production  Facilitator  and  facilitate 
implementation of the project. 
43. 
Training  of Trainers (ToT) for  Agriculture    Extension   Officers  (AEO) and  SAAOs on PRA 
and group mobilization – during mobilization of farmers into groups, the extension workers role would 
be facilitation, not as  ‘doers’. Keeping these principles, the SAAOs  will be trained  on standard tools 
and techniques of PRA to strengthen existing groups and to mobilize new ones. The training will also 
touch  upon  the  challenges  of  climate  change  effects  and  technologies  to  make  communities  (and 
farmers) more resilient to natural disasters and other forms of threats to agriculture livelihoods. 
44. 
PRA  for  group  formation  and  mobilization  -  this  activity  will  be  conducted  only  for  the 
mobilization  of  new  groups  where  there  are  no  groups  previously  mobilized  by  DAE  or  by  other 
extension agencies. As mentioned above, the early involvement of youth will be essential to create a 
future driving force for new adaptive technologies.   
45. 
Identification  and  prioritization  of  technology  and  research  needs  for  selected  crops  - 
Upazila level  consultation  on identification, prioritization and selection of proven technologies  will be 
conducted through workshops with the participation of private sector, extension & research agencies 
and smallholder farmers. A list of such scalable technologies for southern delta proposed by the BARI 
is given below.

Sub-component 1.2: Demand-driven production and market-led research 
46. 
Identification of action research needs will be based on the analysis and prioritisation of the 
VC studies, and the FPM group needs for information new and demanded technologies and on-farm 
mechanization etc. Some key constraints already identified are availability of breeder and foundation 
seeds  of  pulses,  oilseeds  and  other  HVCs,  access  to  inputs,  affordable  mechanisation,  appropriate 
packing  materials,  suitable  processing  or  semi-processing  techniques  and  equipment.  The  following 
activities will be implemented: 
47. 
Action research on climate smart technologies – Action research on prioritized technologies 
identified by the extension, research, private sector and smallholders will be conducted by BARI at its 
regional  station  and  farmers.  Standard  protocol  of  action  research  will  be  designed  by  the  HVC 
specialist of both BARI and additional consultants when required. Once finalized, the manual for each 
technology  will  be  developed  by  BARI  and  handed  over  to  the  DAE  for  wider  dissemination  to  the 
farmers.  The  market  research  specific  to  the  project  areas  will  be  strengthened  in  BARI  and  local 
relevant  universities  if  needed.  Services  of  the  consultants  (including  TA)  will  be  utilized  in 
development of research programs.   
48. 
Evaluation  of  stress  (e.g.  saline,  submergence  and  drought)  tolerant  varieties  –  suitable 
HVC varieties already released by the BARI  will be evaluated both at on-farm research field and by 
farmers  to  assess  performance,  yield  gap,  and  soil  management.    On  farm  as  well  as  respective 
research centres/divisions of BARI will be made involved in the process of evaluation. These efforts 
will be oriented in the direction of defying climate change effects. 
49. 
Evaluation  of  appropriate  mechanization  options  -  The  project  will  form  a  Technical 
Committee  for  performance  testing  of  appropriate  machinery  promoted  by  the  importers,  local 
manufacturers/traders  through  floating  an  Expression  of  Interest  in  newspapers.  BARI  developed 
machineries will also be included for performance evaluation. All machines have to be tested at BARI. 
the  Technical  Committee,  appropriate  machines  and  respective 
Upon  recommendations  by 
companies will be enlisted with the project. The selected brands of tested machines will be promoted 
among farmers by DAE, with a special focus on young farmers who seem to be more receptive to new 
machineries.  
50. 
Research on on-farm post-harvest storage and agro-processing - Postharvest management 
(PHM)  is  another  part  of  mechanization  especially  for  HVCs.  Appropriate  small  scale  postharvest 
10 
People’s Republic of Bangladesh 
Smallholder Agricultural Competitiveness Project (SACP) 
Final project design report 
technology  is  needed  especially  for  HVC  clusters  across  the  southern  delta  for  smallholders  to 
achieve better market outcomes. On-farm research on post-harvest storage and agro-processing will 
be  conducted  for  vegetables,  fruits,  pulses,  oil-crops  especially  on  small  scale  processing 
machineries,  through  the  establishment  of  common  facility  center  at  farmer  groups,  etc.  On  farm 
research will be conducted for determining maturity indices. 
51. 
Multiplication  of  seeds/planting  material  of  HVCs  –  seeds  and  planting  materials  for 
prioritized  HVCs  will  be  multiplied  to  ensure  availability  among  farmers.  BARI  will  produce  breeder 
seed and handed over to the BADC to produce foundation seeds to distribute among farmers. Private 
seed operators will also be linked in the seeds supply system.  
Sub-component 1.3 Institutional support for research and extension 
52. 
Institutional support will be provided to secure the quality of project implementation, such as 
improved  service  facilities  for  both  extension  and  research  in  the  forms  of  necessary  infrastructure 
and  equipment  (also  ensuring  environmental  conservation  and  necessary  climate  resilience 
enhancement),  deployment  of  project  staff,  and  supply  of  vehicles.  Capacity      building  of 
professionals,  technicians  and  management  staff:     Training/exposure    visits    on    contemporaneous 
research for stress as well as climate smart agriculture. To achieve the expected results, the following 
activities will be implemented: 
-  Formation of implementation team at different levels by placing capable manpower; 
-  Development of comprehensive work and budget in line with the log-frame of the project; 
-  Timely procurement and efficient use of equipment and goods;  
-  Develop and implementation and effective monitoring system, also able to record and share 
challenges, identified best practices and lessons learnt; 
-  Regular and effective coordination within the implementation stakeholders at different   level centre to 
union; 
-  Regular follow-up of monitoring and evaluation activities; 
-  Proper capturing of information, documentation and reporting. 
53. 
Technical  Assistance.  TA  under  component  1  will  cover  sub-component  1.1:  Value  chain 
studies and Market-led Farmer Field Schools as well as sub-component 1.3: Development of benefit 
M&E system  
54. 
TA  to  sub-component  1.1.  Value  chain  studies.  The  value  chain  specialist  engaged  by  the  
project  office  will  be  responsible  for  conducting    value  chain  studies  for  the  selection  of  high  value 
crops.  After  pre-selection  of  HVCs,  detailed  value  chain  studies  will  be  conducted  to  determine 
research  priorities,  fine-tune  other  project  activities,  and  also  explore  the  opportunities  for  regional 
branding. It is  expected  the  Project Office (PO) will contract these studies out.  The  HVC Specialists 
will  support  by  providing  advice  on  the  terms  of  reference  of  the  studies,  by  reviewing  research 
proposals and by reviewing the study reports for quality assurance.  Market-led Farmer Field Schools. 
The market-led Farmer Field School (FFS) approach will build on previous MoA experience with FFS 
programmes. Market-led FFS curricula will be developed for the chosen HVC. The TA project will train 
30 master trainers over a three-month period. The  SACP project office will then  take  over  to  train  
the    SAAOs    and    farmer  facilitators,  with  continued  technical  advice  from  the  FAO  TA  team  and 
experts of project office including technical coordinators.

Final project design report 
56. 
Component  Exit  Strategy  and  Sustainability:  The  component  is  based  on  capacity 
building  of  existing  and/or  new  FPM  groups  to  identify  market  opportunities  and  identify  the  service 
providers along the value chain who are needed to increase their productivity, profitability and reduce 
their  food  security  risks  from  engaging  more  in  market-led  agriculture.  Increased  capacities  in  DAM 
and  DAE  staff  will  continue  to  be  applied  after  the  project  has  ended,  as  will  the  group  capacities. 
These  initial  skills  will  be  further  supported  and  sustained  through  linkages  with  other  GoB 
departments and the private sector along the selected VCs. 
Component 2: Processing and marketing of HVC 
57. 
This  component  will  support  smallholders  to  access  market  in  a  more  efficient  manner 
through  creating  a  conducive  business  environment  for  private  sector  to  reach  them.  In  parallel, 
promising rural agro-enterprises (individual farmer, farmer groups and/or  rural entrepreneurs) will be 
assisted  to  add  value  to  primary  products  and  penetrate  market  through  value-added  products. 
Besides, village-level food processing will be promoted to encourage nutrition and food-safety along 
the value chains. Value addition will be through improved post-harvest practices, processing, storage, 
and  transport  of  agricultural  commodities.  Activities  will  focus  on  (i) capacity  building  of  DAMs  (ii) 
developing  a  demand-driven  extension  approach  within  DAE  and  DAM  and  by  engaging  private 
sector,  (iii)    linking  with  private  sector  buyers  (v)  developing  opportunities  for  village-level  food 
processing, and (vi) developing existing and potential rural enterprises’ ability to manage sustainable 
rural agro-enterprises.  
58. 
Implementation Strategy – This component builds on value chain selection and production 
related  capacity  building  activities  for  farmers  under  Component  1  and  therefore,  develops  farmers’ 
skills on post-production activities to access market in a more efficient and effective way. Under this 
component,  the  project  will  invest  in  reducing  the  market  inefficiency,  especially  in  terms  of 
asymmetric  information.  Through  the  creation  of  the  entry  point  and  platform  (farmer  groups)  under 
Component 1, the private sector will be able to communicate to the producers in a cost-effective way 
about  their  requirements  in  terms  of  quality  and  quantity,  price  conditions  for  different  marketable 
categories,  packing  and  packaging,  delivery  conditions.  This  will  help  reduce  the  perception  of 
additional costs, or risk of negative return from quality and quantity assurance at production level by 
the  buyers.  The  lead  implementer  for  this  component  is  Department  of  Marketing  (DAM)  through 
collaboration with other implementing agencies. It is important to note that the interventions/activities 
under this component will be undertaken in parallel to those under Component 1 and Component 3 to 
ensure synergy and maximization of resources. For example, a buyer may require a specific product 
to be supplied with certain packaging features but may also want the product to be produced using a 
specific seed variety. While the former falls under post-production knowledge i.e under Component 2, 
the latter has to be addressed at production level i.e. under Component 1.  
Sub-component 2.1: Improving market linkage 
59. 
This  subcomponent  focuses  on  improving  institutional  capacity  of  DAM  to  enable  them  to 
foster market linkages. Considering the current level of under-staffing, 30 Upazila Marketing Facilitator 
will be engaged through outsourcing in this project under DAM – one in each Upazila. These Upazila 
Marketing Facilitators will be the primary focal points for working with farmer groups on market-access 
and marketing-related aspects, and collaborate closely with SAAOs in respective Upazilas to transfer 
jointly post-production and marketing knowledge to farmers.   
60.  Buyer  mapping  and  assessment  -  DAM  district  level  staff  (3  most  senior  staff)  and  Upazila 
Marketing  Facilitators  will  be  trained  on  ‘buyers  mapping’  followed  by  assessment  of  buyers.  While 
buyer  mapping  will  identify  existing  buyers  for  selected  crops  at  different  tiers  of  a  value  chain  i.e. 
local  traders,  wholesalers,  institutional  buyers  etc.;  assessment  of  buyers  will  help  select  most 
potential buyers who the project may work together to enhance farmers’ capacity to respond to market 
needs.  Buyer  selection  criteria  will  be  developed  at  PO  level  and  these  criteria  may  include 
willingness  to  collaborate,  area  coverage,  procurement  volume,  product  portfolio  dealing  with  etc. 
12 
People’s Republic of Bangladesh 
Smallholder Agricultural Competitiveness Project (SACP) 
Final project design report 
DAM  will  conduct/update  the  buyer  mapping  cum  assessment  once  in  every  one  year  and  a  half 
through involving district level staff, Upazilla Marketing Facilitators and also the SAAOs in the targeted 
areas to create room for more buyers to join the project who fulfil the selection criteria. In the whole 
project  period,  the  project  should  select  and  work  with  at  least  10  institutional  buyers  and  100 
individuals for different value chain crops.   
61.  Agreements with buyers - Upon identification and selection of buyers, the project will enter into 
agreements  with  them  delineating  the  roles  and  responsibilities  of  each  party.  While  for  institutional 
buyers it will be formal MoUs at PO level, for individuals it can be informal agreements at local level. 
The major role for the project is to prepare farmers (through both Component 1 and Component 2) to 
comply  with  the  agreed  upon  requirements  of  the  buyers.  Buyers’  major  role  would  be  to  attend 
relevant  training  sessions  for  farmers  arranged  by  the  project  and  educate  them  about  their  needs. 
The  MoUs  and  informal  agreements  should  not  be  a  binding  document  for  a  guaranteed  purchase 
which  may  reduce  the  interest  among  buyers  to  collaborate.  The  rationale  behind  not  having  such 
guaranteed  purchase  clause  are:  a)  through  value  chain  selection  under  Component  1  most 
demanded crops are already selected which are likely to have high unmet market demand; b) through 
interventions  under  Component  1,  the  targeted  farmers  are  expected  to  be  more  productive  which 
means,  they  will  make  higher  profit  even  if  they  sell  in  regular  market;  c)  buyer  mapping  and 
assessment  has  already  identified  the  demand-supply  mismatch  which  are  resolved  through 
supporting the farmers and hence, selected buyers are very likely to buy from them. DAM (national, 
district)  staff  including  their  Upazila  Marketing  facilitators  will  initiate  the  negotiation  with  interested 
private  businesses  (local  traders,  regional  wholesalers,  national  companies,  exporters  etc.)  already 
identified, to educate farmers alongside SAAOs on their needs and requirements and how to comply 
with those. In the negotiation, the project will primarily highlight the opportunities it will create through 
investment  (such  as  farmer  groups,  farmer  training  on  post-harvest  techniques  and  business 
management  skills  etc.)  for  private  businesses  to  tap  and  get  access  to  those  ‘better  equipped’ 
farmers and hence, how much the private businesses would offer to join in such investment – either in 
kind or cash. There will be formal MoUs signed between DAM and institutional buyers delineating the 
roles and responsibilities of each party while with individual buyers, informal agreements can be made 
at Upzilla and district level.        
62.  Business management skills development - Every farmer is an entrepreneur and like any other 
business, farming also need operational, marketing and financial management. Lack of knowledge of 
farmers on these aspects  often makes them inefficient and  non-competitive. Linking with buyers will 
be  fruitless  unless  the  farmers  manage  their  farming  efficiently  and  in  compliance  with  buyers’ 
requirement.  DAM  district  level  staff  and  Upazila  Marketing  Facilitators  will  be  trained  on  basic 
business  management  skills  along  with  Business  Development  Services  (BDS).  They  will  train  the 
SAAOs who in turn will train farmers in a simplistic way. Once the DAM district level staff and Upazila 
Marketing  Facilitator  become  knowledgeable  on  business  management  skills  and  BDS  (such  as 
finance,  standards,  certificates,  legal  requirements)  provisions  and  respective  providers,  they  can 
assist  not  only  farmers  but  also  rural-agro  enterprises  to  avail  different  BDSs  through  an  informed 
manner. The project will support documentation and printing of business management skills technical 
modules as well as mapping of BDSs provisions required for different agro-enterprises so that these 
resources can be used beyond the project period.     
63. 
Formation of multi-stakeholder platforms – The project will form multi-stakeholder platform in 
each district stationed in the local Chamber of Commerce and Industry office. These multi-stakeholder 
platforms  will  include  Farmer  Groups,  representatives  from  the  local  Chamber  of  Commerce  and 
Industry,  local  government,  DAE  and  DAM,  research  institutions,  agro-input  companies,  agro-
processors, transport and  logistics providers, private  sales agents, financial  institutions, professional 
organisations  of  the  agriculture  sector  and  farmers.  President  of  the  Chamber  of  Commerce  and 
Industry will chair the platform. The role of these multi-stakeholder platforms is to provide a forum for 
the  discussion  of  industry  or  sector  problems  and  constraints  in  a  holistic  manner  thereby  ensuring 
that the interests of all stakeholders are represented and protected. District DAM office will primarily 
assist respective Chamber of Commerce to maintain the functioning of the platform. The forum will sit 
13 
People’s Republic of Bangladesh 
Smallholder Agricultural Competitiveness Project (SACP) 
Final project design report 
together once in every quarter. The project will bear the costs for snacks/food and the Chamber will 
provide venue and logistics support as their investment.  
Sub-component 2.2: Post-harvest and processing investments  
64. 
This  subcomponent  materializes  enhanced  capacity  of  DAM  and  SAAOs;  and  agreements 
with  buyers  to  connect  with  producers.  The  subcomponent  also  creates  the  provision  to  support 
promotion  of  agro-processing  enterprises.  The  major  activities  revolve  around  building  producers’ 
capacity on post-harvest activities and primary processing to respond to buyers’ demand; identifying 
and supporting potential agro-processing enterprises. 
65. 
Farmer  training  on  post-harvest  and  primary  processing  -  DAM  district-level  staff  and 
Upazila  Marketing  Facilitators  will  be  trained  on  post-harvest  and  primary  processing  of  selected 
crops  as  per  the  need  identified  during  the  buyers’  assessment.  DAM,  thereafter,  will  provide  such 
training  to  SAAOs,  who  in  turn  will  train  the  farmers  with  the  presence  of  buyers  with  whom 
agreements have been signed. Buyers (individual or institutions) must develop a sense of ownership 
on  the  training  activities  and  for  this  reason,  they  should  be  consulted  and  involved  at  each  level  – 
starting from training module  development till providing training to farmers. The selected buyers  are 
expected to contribute financially (may be in kind, by providing time, resource persons, venue etc.) in 
the  training  events  for  farmers  –  for  individual  buyers  cost-sharing  is  expected  to  be  at  least  10% 
while for institutional buyers it is 20%. 
66. 
Promotion  of  agro-processing  enterprises  -  The  project  will  provide  financial  and  technical 
support to 300 agro-processing enterprises (to the  individual agi-entrepreneurs or producer groups), 
on  average  10  from  each  Upazila,  linked  to  Farmer  Groups.  In  addition,  support  services  in 
dissemination  of  processing  technology,  branding,  packaging,  certification  from  BSTI  and  other 
institutions,  etc.  will  be  provided  to  small  level  agro-processor/  entrepreneurs.  It  is  envisaged  that  a 
particular  Farmer  Group  may  or  may  not  propose  to  start  or  upgrade  an  agro-enterprise.    Few 
members from one group  or several groups may join together. All these options will remain open to 
select  appropriate  candidates  to  choose  for  project  support.  In  this  regard,  the  project  will  design 
matching grant implementation modalities for the entrepreneurs   (individual/   group) for establishing   
agro-processing  enterprises  in  the  areas  of  storage  infrastructure,  pack-house,  post-harvest  and 
processing equipment/machinery. The matching grant amount will be on average BDT 2 million based 
on the business proposal merit and the grant amount will not exceed 50% of the total investment cost 
(productive assets including land, building, storage infrastructure and/or machinery) where the rest will 
be  borne  by  the  entrepreneur.  Investment  may  include  multi-crop  cold  storage  infrastructure, 
mechanical dryers for grains and pulse, mechanical sheller for grains, grinding machines for oil seeds, 
grinding and pellet making machines for animal feeds etc.  
67. 
The grant amount will vary depending on the business type and size. Average grant amount 
may  be  BDT  1  million  for  each  proposal.    However,  in  case  of  four  multi-crop  cold  storages,  the 
amount  may  be  increased  up  to  BDT  2.5  million  each.  On  the  other  hand,  a  mechanical  shelter  for 
grains  may  require  only  about  BDT  100,000  as  matching  grant  from  the  project.  Small-scale 
processing facilities such as drying and roasting of ground nuts, chanachur (local snacks), puffed-rice 
making etc. which may require less amount of matching grant shall also be considered for support. It 
is  important  to  note  that  the  business  proposals  must  come  from  the  entrepreneurs  (individual  or 
group) - existing (to expand business) or potential to start on what they have already experience and 
knowledge  (only  exception  for  nutrition  rich  fruits  and  vegetables  processing  training  participants 
under Subcomponent 2.3 who will get the training from the project and then can apply for the grants to 
start  business).  The  project  will  provide  business  management  skills  and  also  assist  in  accessing 
BDSs  for  the  selected  entrepreneurs  after  winning  the  matching  grant.  The  grant  amount  will  be 
disbursed  after  completion  of  works  of  the  entrepreneur's  portion.  Whatsoever,  the  total  number  of 
matching  grants  will  be  600  (20  for  each  upazila).  The  enterprises  developed  under  matching  grant 
will be owned jointly.  The total amount will be limited to BDT 600 million. In order to ensure that the 
small holder farmers/entrepreneurs are not excluded from this opportunity, at least 400 grants will  be

Final project design report 
received by those who belong to farmer groups the project has mobilized including women members 
who  will  be  trained  to  process  micronutrient  rich  fruits  and  vegetables  (discussed  in  the  following 
section).  The  ownership  will  be  determined  by  the  proportion  of  investment  cost  shared  by 
entrepreneurs and the DAM. The overall implementation will include an application process, for which 
it  is  envisioned  that  applicants  will  need  to  submit  a  business  plan.  It  can  be  assumed  that  all 
applicants may not have the capacity to develop such a business plan and DAM district level and DAE 
upazila  level  staff  will  need  to  assist  them.  Technical  capacity  of  both  DAM  district  staff  and  DAE 
Upazila  staff  will  be  developed  accordingly.  The  final  selection  for  businesses  eligible  to  receive  the 
matching grants will be carried out through an evaluation process at  PO level, in line with evaluation 
criteria prepared in consultation with IFAD. 
Sub-Component 2.3: Development of food safety and nutrition measures along the value chain  
68. 
The  objective  of  this  subcomponent  is  to  promote  nutrition  sensitive  value  chains  and 
products  and  thereby  enhance  the  consumption  of  safe  and  diversified  diet  for  households,  women 
and young children. DAE will act as the lead agency through collaboration with Bangladesh Institute of 
Research and Training in Applied Nutrition (BIRTAN), DAM and BARI.  
69. 
Food  safety  and  nutrition  training  of  trainers  -Training  manual  on  quality  and  food  safety 
management  systems  will  be  developed  and  selected  resource  persons  of  the  agencies  mentioned 
above  will  be  trained.  These  resources  persons  will  ultimately  roll-out  the  training  of  trainers  at  the 
district, Upazila and community level.  
70. 
Training  on  community  based  safe  food  processing  -  Following  the  ToTs  received,  SAAOs 
will  provide  training  to  farmer  group  leaders,  women  farmer  groups  and  relevant  agro-processors 
selected  for  matching  grants  on  processing  of  micronutrient  rich  fruits  and  vegetables.  A  special

72. 
Behavioural  change  campaign  -  Every  year  a  1-day  behavioural  change  campaign  on 
National Food Safety and Agriculture Days will be carried out for enhancing horticulture consumption 
and nutritive food production, processing and marketing for women farmers specifically resource poor 
women to ensure increased demand of micronutrient rich fruits and vegetables by improving shelf life 
of the horticulture produce and increasing consumption and diversity of micronutrient rich foods in the 
diet for better nutrition. DAE, being the lead agency, will engage DAM to ensure active participation of 
large agro-processors (with some of whom DAM already signed agreement under subcomponent 2.1) 
in this campaign.

 Component  exit  strategy  and  sustainability.  The  subcomponent  attempts  to  address 
inefficiency of the market system where buyers do not invest time and resources to build the capacity 
of small holders to enable the latter to  supply their produce in an informed way. With the creation of 
the  platform  (the  farmer  groups)  private  sector  buyers  will  find  it  cost-effective  to  reach  them  in 
sustainable  way  where  DAM  and  DAE  through  increased  capacity  will  assist  the  private  sector  to 
educate them. Once this connection has been developed, private sector is likely to continue the direct 
relationship with small holders to continuously educate them on their needs and requirement. On the 
other  hand,  DAM  with  its  increased  capacity  to  assess  market  and  buyers  will  take  this  knowledge 
forward  to  carry  out  the  same  business  model  in  new  areas  beyond  the  project.  Agro-enterprises 
supported through matching grant will create a demand-pull for more products affecting a production 
growth  of  the  primary  commodities  in  the  project  areas.  Through  promotion  of  nutrition  enriched 
processed agro-products, there  will be higher demand of such products and new similar enterprises 
are likely to join the rally seeing the market opportunity. Multi-stakeholder platform created under this 
component will open a new window to discuss the problems of all the stakeholders in a single forum, 
address  them  through  collective  actions  and  advocate  to  concerned  authority  to  create  more 
conducive business environment.

Component 3: Climate Resilient Surface Water Management 
78. 
This  component  aims  at  creating  and  securing  enabling  environment  and  facilities  of 
strengthening  the  responsiveness  and  competitiveness  of  smallholders  in  HVC  production  and 
marketing.  The  purpose  of  the  component  is  to  facilitate  the  broad  project  objective  of  creating  an 
enabling  environment  through  infrastructure  development.  The  activities  under  component  3  will 
support  households  interested  in  increasing  their  productivity  and  diversification  to  HVCs  with  water 
infrastructure  that  will  provide  supplemental  or  full  season  water  access,  through  a  range  of 
investments  in  water  storage  and  provision  to  cropland,  with  associated  capacity  development  for 
households  and  groups  to  manage  this  water  infrastructure.    All  activities  in  this  Component  will  be 
closely associated and enhance initiatives of value addition under Component 1 and 2  – the location 
and  scale  of  interventions  will  depend  on  identified  and  prioritised  food  production  and  cash  crop 
production activities and their need for supplemental and full crop season irrigation. 
79. 
Implementation Strategy - Considering the experience and capacity of minor irrigation and 
drainage development, the Bangladesh Agriculture Development Corporation (BADC) is proposed to 
implement activities under component 3. The BADC has a well-organized irrigation division headed by 
Chief  Engineer  (GOB  grade  II  official).  Mostly  engineering  graduates  and  diploma  engineers  are 
engaged in the developmental activities of the division. In the selected districts, Executive Engineers 
(Grade 5) will be overall responsible for the project interventions. Assistant Engineers (Grade 9), sub 
Assistant Engineers (Grade 10) and mechanics/technicians will be responsible for implementation of 
the  activities.  The  activities  under  Component  3.2  (institutional  support/capacity  building)  will  be 
outsourced  through  competitive  bidding  where  applicable.  Some  short  term  consultancy  provisions 
have  been  proposed  for  ensuring  sustainable  water  user  groups  formation  and  community 
participation  in  O&M  in  line  with  the  participatory  water  management  rule,  environmental  aspects  in 
water management. 
Sub-component  3.1  -  Sustainable  surface  water  management,  drainage,  conservation  and 
utilization    
80. 
The key activities will involve infrastructure development for surface water conservation and 
utilization  for  irrigation  (high  efficiency  delivery  systems),  addressing  drainage  congestion,  efficient 
irrigation  system  management,  rainwater  harvesting,  and  energy  efficient  water  management  etc. 
Selection of sites for specific activities will be based on ecological and environmental situations in the 
project  areas  and  will  be  location  specific.  The  following  are  a  range  of  interventions  and  potential 
scale of interventions that have been identified based on needs prioritized by HVC growers, lessons 
learned  in  other  projects,  knowledge  of  the  area  and  its  production  constraints,  the  focus  on 
production and marketing of HVCs. 
81. 
Crop  Protection  dyke  -  to  protect  crop  land  growing  HVCs  against  tidal  flood  and  heavy 
raining  low  land  and  char  areas  approximately  45  km  of  dykes  will  be  made.    During  exceptional 
adverse condition of flood, people with their livestock will take shelter at dyke.  
82. 
Re-excavation and maintenance of canals - To provide water for irrigation and/or drainage of 
excess water. To be undertaken for both water conservation as rainwater harvesting for irrigation and 
drainage  facility.  This  will  be  implemented  in  the  areas  having  problems  of  drainage  congestion  or 
tidal  flooding  causing  delays  in  crop  establishment  and  or  irrigation  facilities  to  meet  crop  demand. 
Around 376 km of re-excavation will be made in suitable sites in close links with FMP Groups. Canal 
water to be used for household consumption. Dykes will  be  used for sheltering of domestic animals 
during flood, fishing facilities created, navigation facilities improved and duck culture introduced.  
83. 
Construction  of  on-farm  water  management  structures  -  The  small-scale  structure  will  be 
built in the water course and canals at farm level as civil works to regulate water. The tidal canals in 
the  project sites divide the homesteads.  The structures  will be constructed for  crossing the canal to 
wider road and easier transportation of agricultural crop, goods and farm machines. Provisions were 
showed in the detailed cost tables.

84. 
The project area has a lot of water courses towards the field to enter the tide water at high 
tide  &  drain  out  the  water  again  at  low  tide.  The  water  course  or  canal  needs  foot  bridge  or  cattle 
crossing  to  be  used  by  farmers  to  carry  tillage  equipment,  seedlings,  fertilizer,  cattle  &  for  regular 
movement  to  take  care  of  crops.  The  foot  bridge  or  cattle  crossings  will  have  to  build  in  such  a 
manner that does not obstruct the natural water course. Some of the village road have pipe culverts of 
small & insufficient diameter to drain out the excess irrigation water or excessive rainfall. Some of new 
depression needs pipe culvert or water pass to drain out stagnant water. The small-scale structure will 
be built in the water course to connect market to field & homesteads. 
85. 
with other area. To facilitate communication facility some small structure construction is needed. 
The  project  area  under  consideration  lacks  rural  agricultural  infrastructure  in  comparison 
86. 
Community pond excavation with homestead solar  irrigation pump sets  - for  water storage 
for  productive  uses  -  This  will  be  mostly  done  in  the  southwest  part  where  prevalence  of  salinity  is 
more. Efficient irrigation system management for HVC will be implemented at the homestead level. In 
addition, solar energy will be used for domestic purpose and homestead vegetables. Efficient micro-
irrigation like drip irrigation systems to be introduced for increasing irrigation efficiency for HVC. 
87. 
Previously all homesteads have a pond for fish culture and house hold use. But now without 
any re-excavation or renovation of pond or village water body it becomes ditches with store of waste 
water & breeding place of mosquito. The pond and ditches of private & public ownership needed to re-
excavate to store rain water. 
88. 
The solar pump will be installed near the pond to continuous pumping & storing water over 
surface to make gravity flow of water to the plant, fruit trees & vegetables with drip type of irrigation 
using small water control tap.  
89. 
Promotion of solar irrigation pump sets and drip irrigation - to maximise water use efficiency 
- Solar energy in the remote southern districts is getting popular for domestic supply. Where feasible, 
solar energy (no operating cost, thus cheaper option for energy saving) along with high efficiency drip 
irrigation system will be installed to support high value crops in the project sites.  Research institutes 
may be involved in technological support and share experiences in installation of these high efficiency 
systems. Around 95 pump sets will be installed in suitable sites. 
90. 
Installation of buried pipe system - for new pump and BADC existing pump (for water lifting 
devise  from  surface  water  sources)  for  irrigation  to  increase  irrigation  water  use  efficiency.  In 
continuation of similar intervention through previous projects and programs the buried pipe system will 
be installed. The activities will be undertaken in newer schemes and in some cases it will be extended 
to  old  schemes  to  further  increase  command  area.  The  system  will  reduce  water  loss  thus  reduce 
irrigation charge to almost half. Buried pipe irrigation system also saves land and water compared to 
conventional  earthen  or  constructed  channel.  A  total  of  about  250  kilometres  of  buried  pipe  will  be 
installed. Extension of existing schemes will be for 48 kilometres. 
91. 
Conveying  irrigation  water  from  source  to  the  field  with  buried  pipe  is  most  popular  to  the 
farmer.  Buried  pipe  reduces  water  loss  up  to  no  loss  condition  with  no  loss  of  valuable  agricultural 
land as in case of constructed canal or earthen canal and it needs almost no maintenance work. So 
the  system  will  reduce  the  irrigation  cost  almost  half  and  increasing  the  command  area  under  one 
pumping  unit,  the  cost  may  be  reduced  more.  Moreover,  when  a  small  land  is  separated  by  small 
ditch, homestead or orchard it can be connected by buried pipe irrigation system. 
92. 
Provision of hose pipe for irrigation scheme - for conveyance of water to remote locations to 
extend the irrigation command area. Hose pipes will be provisioned for conveyance of water to remote 
locations which will increase irrigation area. It will reduce conveyance loss and conveniently distribute 
water,  where  needed.  Approximately  12,500  meters  of  hose  pipe  will  be  installed  in  the  selected 
project sites.

93. 
Hose pipe for irrigation is a new idea introduced in the project area. The small and marginal 
farmers appreciate this type of water conveyance system. Due to its most flexibility it can go around 
homestead, trees, ditches or any other obstruction of smaller height. It is easier to carry by farmer to 
field and store the same after irrigation work. 
i)  Artisan  well  installation  -  in  areas  of  the  confined  (pressurized)  aquifer  zone  in  the 
southeast  part.  In  the  south-eastern  part  of  the  proposed  project  sites  artisan  aquifers 
zones are available and piezometric surface is close to the surface. This  does not need 
abstraction through pumping. Tapping  water  from such shallow  depth will be affordable 
and easy to use for irrigation. The resources will be utilized to irrigate high value crops of 
commercial importance. Around 100 suitable sites of such artisan well will be installed 
ii)  Dug well: South-western coast of Bangladesh have some saline problem to some extent. 
But the pond water infiltrate from surface water is drinkable and the dug well receive the 
same surface and sub-surface water which can be used for irrigation. 
iii)  Installation  of  rainwater  harvesting  structures  -  considering  acute  shortages  of  fresh 
water  during  dry  season  rainwater  harvesting  will  be  introduced  at  the  household  level 
both for irrigation and drinking water purpose. During the project implementation around 
3,000 will be installed in the project duration. 
94. 
Key activities of component 3 of the project are mainly efficient use of irrigation technology. 
Thus, it is expected that after project completion irrigation efficiency of the project site increase from 
35% to 42%. 
Sub-component 3.2 - Institutional support for Capacity Building 
95. 
The  interventions  under  this  sub-component  will  address  enhancing  efficiency  in  service 
delivery  of  agency  and  relevant  stakeholders.  This  will  focus  community  ownership  of  the  water 
management  infrastructure  through  (i)  Formation,  mobilization,  training  and  development  of  Water 
User  Groups  (WUGs),  following  government  participatory  water  management  guideline,  (ii)  skill 
development of the agency and water users and (iii) developing institutional facilities for better service 
delivery (office, transportation and other logistic support).  
96. 
The activities proposed are based on the assessment of the existing facilities/ infrastructures 
in the proposed project sites. There are 18 offices of BADC in the proposed project areas where some 
renovations have been proposed. Activities under the sub-component are:   
  Renovation of office/training center in the project sites (ten) for better office accommodation 
and pertaining training to the engineers, technicians, pump operators/managers, water user 
groups (farmers) etc. 
  Overseas  training  for  skill  enhancement  of  relevant  engineers  and  planners  in  efficient 
irrigation and drainage system design and planning 
  Printing and publication of reports, project documentations and training manuals 
97. 
Technical  Assistance. TA under component 2 will cover subcomponent 3.2:  ToT on water 
user  groups  and  low-pressure  high  efficiency  irrigation.  FAO  will  contribute  to  the  development  of  a 
training manual by focusing on the mobilization and training of water user groups and on low-pressure 
high-efficiency  irrigation  methods,  rainwater  harvesting,  environmental  aspects  of  surface  water 
management,  salinity  management  and  climate  change  effects.  After  training  manual  development, 
FAO will train selected 2 batches (41 officials) BADC officers at district and upazila level. They will in 
turn train field staff. 
98. 
Component Exit Strategy and Sustainability: The proposed project includes formation of 
WUGs  who  will  be  the  primary  beneficiaries  of  this  component.  The  capacity  of  the  groups  will  be 
enhanced through training so that after completion of the project, the groups will have the necessary 
knowledge and skills to be responsible for general O&M of the interventions of the water management

Tompro,  the  accounting  software  used  by  some  projects  in  the  country  programme,  has 
resulted  in  being  a  sound  financial  management  instrument,  and  providing  good  value  addition  in 
linking the accounting system to the project M&E for projects that chose to implement the software at 
the early start-up. Its feasibility for customization and reporting has shown good results in the projects 
for  which  was  implemented.  This  is  a  good  practice  that  new  projects  in  the  country  programme 
including  SACP  should  adopt  and  procuring  such  software  that  at  the  same  time,  complies  with 
international standards and responds to the project needs at different levels in financial management 
with good capabilities and flexibility. Intensive and focused training and long-term agreement with the 
vendor  will  however need to be in place in order to build and strengthen the operational capacity of 
the management team, providing continued maintenance and update of the accounting software.

SECAP. The environmental and social risk of the project falls under the  category B in view 
of  little  or  negligible  adverse  impact  potential  on  natural  and  social  environment,  while  it  also  falls 
under  category  ‘High’  regarding  climate  change  risks.  By  committing  to  the  below-mentioned 
approaches and activities, the project will significantly be reducing the perceived risks and expected to 
have  a  great  contribution  towards  enhancing  resilience  and  reducing  poverty  of  smallholders  in  the 
target areas.  
106. 
The  SACP  is  envisaged  to  promote  improved  agronomic  practices,  knowledge  base, 
research support and extension for high value crops, without having to affect natural environment. In 
order for extending better extension services and research facilities, a few minor construction-related 
activities  will  be  undertaken.  Although,  little  environmental  hazard  may  be  anticipated  in  relation  to 
such  unavoidable  constructions,  due  to  unavoidable  overlap  of  project  areas  and  environmentally 
critical  areas  (ECA),  efforts  need  to  be  made  to  reduce  environmental  costs  and  meeting  national 
conservation related regulatory requirements.  
107. 
The SACP focuses on building Bangladesh’s coastal smallholders’ capacities on high value 
crop production and marketing, thereby enhancing smallholder farmers’ resilience to challenges likely 
to  be  posed  by  climate  change.  The  project  will  deliver  enhanced  resilience  by  responding  to 
production  challenges  in  terms  of  high  temperature  and  higher  levels  of  moisture  stress,  increased 
rainfall  and  runoff,  higher  susceptibility  to  floods,  high  soil  and  surface  water  salinity,  higher  wave 
interaction due to tidal regime, etc. While the activities that are oriented towards addressing the above 
climate  induced  phenomena,  efforts  will  be  considered  to  ensure  environmental  conservation  in  the 
forms  of  integrated  pest  management,  enhanced  use  of  composts  including  vermin  compost, 
conjunctive  use  of  surface  and  groundwater  for  irrigation,  increase  in  irrigation  efficiency  and  solid 
waste management in premium marketing centres. Emphasis will be given on water harvesting, which 
will  also  address  lack  of  adequate  source  of  potable  drinking  water.  Utmost  efforts  will  be  made  to 
eliminate the  use of environmental resources from ecologically critical areas,  while the  value chains 
will  be  established  taking  into  consideration  locally  suited  high  value  niche  (crop)  products,  that  too 
involving as many women as possible. The marketing centres will be designed and built on elevated 
plinths in a bid to avoid inundation from floods and occasional cyclonic storm surges.  
108. 
Recognizing the potential increase in intensity of climate change induced adverse impacts, 
the  project  will  emphasize  on  building  farmers’  capacity  to  adopt  the  above  mentioned  adaptive 
measures,  while  they  will  also  be  given  awareness  training  on  reducing  risks  that  are  related  to 
climate  change.  To  further  build  local  capacity  to  continue  high  value  crop  production  by  defying 
climate  change,  efforts  will  be  made  to  strengthen  research  on  crop  varieties  that  are  tolerant  to 
climate change induced hazards.  
SACP implementation arrangement 
A.  Approach 
109. 
The project implementation will follow the Government DPP from IFAD project design report. 
SACP will be implemented in 6 years, starting with conduct value chain studies, baseline surveys and 
all  management  systems  (accounting  software,  M&E  and  MIS  database),  as  well  as  setup  of  multi 
stakeholder platforms. Throughout the implementation period, the project will focus on introducing and 
building  capacity  in  new  skills  strengthening  climate  change  resilient  production  methods,  water 
management and post-harvest management and marketing techniques, and demonstrating adaptive 
methods and technologies for MOA staff and beneficiaries. The project will also give an emphasis on 
scaling-up successful models and good practices and mainstreaming these into focus value chains.

development  projects,  where  good  practices  and  lessons  learnt  can  be  drawn  to  support  the  SACP 
implementation at operational level, and shared for cross-benefits. 
114. 
The project structure of operational management and coordination will be established along 
the DAE vertical structure from central to the Union, with DAE, DAM, BADC, and BARI participation at 
applicable  levels  where  available,  and  managerial  and  technical  officers  appointed  from  respective 
agencies. The project will fund Operational Support Teams (OST) at both central and district levels to 
support  the  Project  Office  and  District  Coordination  Units  (DCUs).  DAE  SAAOs  and  Marketing 
facilitators engaged by DAM will be the key contacts in reaching the farmer groups, with help of lead 
farmers selected among farmer groups. 
115. 
At  central  level,  the  Project  Office  proposed  for  SACP  will  pay  special  attention  to  the 
leading functions of DAE and coordination among implementing agencies. The Project Office will be 
headed  by  a  Project  Director  (PD)  appointed  from  DAE  by  MoA  and  it  will  include  Component 
Directors  from  principal  implementing  agencies  namely  DAE,  DAM  and  BADC,  and  Project 
Coordinator from BARI, seconded by government-deputed officers and support staff will be supported 
by  an  operational  support  team  of  externally  recruited  experts  whose  positions  are  funded  by  the 
Project.  A  Senior  Monitoring  and  Evaluation  Officer  from  the  DAE  will  be  selected  on  deputation  to 
support the PD). 
116. 
The PD’s responsibilities are summarized as follows: 
(a) 
Ensure that the project strategy is applied through the implementation of all activities, 
(b)  Coordinate the programming of planned activities under the Project,

(one  supporting  the  PD,  and  four  supporting  respective  implementing  agencies),  one  Gender 
Development and Safeguard/Governance Specialist, and other support staff where required. 
120. 
At  district  level,  a  District  Coordination  Unit  (DCU) will be established as technical hub 
and composed of one lead technical officer from each of the District DAE, DAM and BADC (who will 
receive  salary  and  allowances  from  the  project,  GOB  head),  one  deputy  project  coordinator  will  be 
engaged from BARI for this project (on additional duty, he will not receive salary and allowances from 
the  project)  and  other  necessary  staff  required  in  all  the  project  districts.  The  DCU  may  have  two 
junior specialists, one in the area of financial management and another in the area of monitoring and 
reporting.  One  operational  Assistant  (OA)  for  preparing  reports  and  other  documentation.  The  DCU

farmer groups in the unions. 
DAM will engage through outsourcing Marketing Facilitators at upazila level to work with the 
123. 
In each project union, three lead farmers will be selected from the selected farmer groups 
and  they  will  be  engaged  on  a  basis  of  daily  basis  remuneration  in  accordance  with  actual  day(s) 
occurred, to support the field work of upazila officers of DAE, BADC and DAM marketing facilitators. 
124. 
Farmer  Producer  and  Marketing  Groups  are  the  entry  point  for  SACP  implementation. 
The project strategy and activities are geared towards ensuring that, by the end of the Project, farmer 
groups grow into more professional players in targeted value chains, and some of them graduate into 
production  and  marketing  cooperatives.  DAE  SAAOs,  BADC  Sub-Assistant  Engineers  and  DAM-
engaged Marketing Facilitators will work to reach the target farmers and their groups with assistance 
from  the  engaged  lead  farmers,  mainly  in  facilitating  the  identification  of  their  priority  needs  and 
connecting  them  to  the  support  by  the  Project,  delivering  project  messages,  supporting  farmers 
groups  and  communities  to  set  up  better  organisations  and  structures  in  value-added  production 
enhancement  and  post-harvest  management,  collecting  performance  data  for  transmission  to  the 
DCU  through  DAE  Upazila  and  Union  offices,  and  providing  feedbacks  on  performance  of  service 
providers. 
125. 
follows: 
Implementation  responsibilities.  Component-wise  lead  implementation  agencies  are  as 
-  DAE for component 1, 
-  DAM for component 2, 
-  BADC for component 3, and 
-  BARI will support the three implementing agencies with researches linked to areas of 
interventions identified under the three technical components. 
126. 
Options will be explored to link the benefit M&E system with the project management M&E 
system  (which  will  be  in  line  with  IFAD’s  revised  results  and  impact  management  system  (RIMS)). 
Such linkage will avoid duplication of data collection and improve the possibility of attribution of results 
to project activities. 
127. 
Country Programme Support unit (CPS unit). In the perspective of a country Programme 
Support  unit  (CPS)  aiming  at  improved  cost  efficiency  for  the  Country  Programme  management, 
capacity building is foreseen and detailed programming will be led by the ERD. The SACP will actively 
participate in this in-country initiative. 
128. 
The  CPS  unit  will  provide  technical  support  services  in  three  key  areas:  M&E,  Knowledge 
Management  and  Communication,  and  Financial  Management.  However,  the  design  of  this 
mechanism is flexible enough to respond to project needs in other technical areas as they arise and 
jointly identified by IFAD financed projects. 
129. 
The  discussion  on  the  modalities  and  responsibilities  of  the  CPSU  will  be  further  reviewed 
jointly  by  IFAD,  ERD, MoA and other involved ministries and  agencies  in  a bid to ensure ownership 
and sustainability.

Technical Assistance.  
131. 
A  separate  fund  within  the  overall  SACP  loan  will  be  used  for 
Technical  Assistance  (TA)  by  FAO  to  the  SACP  Project  Office  and  implementing  agencies  and 
matched  by  an  additional  IFAD  grant.  The  fund  will  be  managed  and  implemented  by  FAO 
Bangladesh under the direction of and in agreement with the Project Director, with support from FAO 
Country Office and technical units in the Region and from HQ.  
132. 
The  TA  component  will  provide  technical  assistance  and  capacity  building  targeted  at 
specific areas that will benefit from strengthening among government project implementation partners. 
TA  activities  will  concentrate  on:  a)  training  of  trainer’s  activities,  b)  assisting  the  development  of  a 
benefit M&E system and C) support to background studies.  
133. 
Expected  Outcome:  The  capacity  of  implementing  agencies  has  been  strengthened  to 
successfully  implement  the  Smallholder  Agriculture  Competitiveness  Project  and  reach  expected 
SACP results. 
134. 
Because of the nature of the TA activities, the TA input is foreseen to have a duration of four 
years, whereas the SACP is foreseen to be implemented over a six-year period. This funding will be 
managed under a standard Unilateral Trust Fund (UTF) with FAO. The TA team will be accountable to 
the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  in  respect  to  implementation  of  activities  in  accordance  with  the  detail 
AWPB. If there is any residual fund after   implementation     of   planned TA activities,  the funds will   
be   used   for   implementing investment activities by the PD. The TA plan is detailed in appendix 12. 
135. 
Private  sector  participation.  The  project  will  create  a  congenial  environment  for  Public, 
Private  and  Producers  Partnership  (4Ps)  so  that  private  inputs  companies,  agro-processors, 
wholesalers,  traders  and  exporters  could  also  assess  potentialities  of  HVCs  in  southern  delta,  their 
business expansion, market linkages and work together with government agencies for investing with 
the SACP producer and marketing groups. 
136. 
Under component 1, market-led value chain research will ignite such partnership followed by 
upazila-level  consultation  on  identification  of  potential  technologies  where  private  sector  would  be 
inclusively involved. These events will identify possible private sector investment in bulk inputs supply 
for  the  producer  marketing  groups,  marketing,  processing  and  manufacturing  of  appropriate  scale 
machineries,  etc.    It  will  be  further  strengthened  through  Market-led  Farmers  Field  School  (MFFS) 
initiatives  where  private sector actors will be involved as session trainers and there will be a  vibrant 
line of linkage with the private sectors and the MFFS leaders under this project intervention.  
137. 
Under component 2, the project is investing in reducing the market inefficiency, especially in 
terms  of  asymmetric  information.  The  project  will  create  an  entry  point  for  the  private  sector  to 
communicate to the producers their requirements in terms of quality and quantity, price conditions for 
different marketable categories, packing and packaging, delivery conditions. This will help reduce the 
perception  of  additional  costs,  or  risk  of  negative  return  from  quality  and  quantity  assurance  at 
production  level  by  the  buyers.  The  SACP  addresses  the  buyers’  needs  by  creating  the  platform 
25 
People’s Republic of Bangladesh 
Smallholder Agricultural Competitiveness Project (SACP) 
Final project design report 
(farmer groups) for buyers/private companies to reach large number of farmers in a cost-effective way 
and  also  by  sharing  the  larger  portion  of  the  cost  for  farmers’  training.  In  these  training  sessions, 
buyers/private businesses, alongside the project technical personnel, will communicate to the farmers 
on  their  needs  and  how  to  conform  to  those  needs.  The  buyers/private  businesses  which  will 
collaborate with SACP to test this business model and communicate and apply their required quality 
standards with the farmer groups are very likely to get their return on investment and will continue to 
carry out similar activities beyond the project – thus leading to a more efficient market system. A total 
of around USD 2 million is estimated as investments from the private sector (in both cash and kind) in 
quality standard assurance.  
138. 
Once the production by farmer groups reaches a desirably sizeable volume that meets the 
buyers’ quality requirements, investments from the private sector in processing, storage and packing 
will join in search of better value addition. The project also directly invests in small pack-houses and 
processing  equipment,  for  which  the  private  entrepreneurs  will  match  an  estimated  amount  of  USD 
3.24 million (30% or an average matching of US10,800 by 300 private entrepreneurs) to access to the 
project grant programme. 
139. 
The  project  will  promote  private  sector  participation  and  invite  the  private  sector 
representatives to join ToT sessions on market-led Farmer Field Schools, market facilitation and post-
harvest  techniques.  Which  companies  and  traders  will  be  invited  will  depend  on  the  results  of  the 
buyer mapping that is proposed to be carried out by DAM national and district staff at the start of the 
project under component 2.2, and for which FAO can assist with methodology.  
140. 
The  private  sector  would  be  willing  to  contribute  to  these  ToTs  because  it  will  ensure  that 
DAE and  DAM training programmes for farmers respond to market realities. For buyers ultimately  it 
will contribute to enlarging their supply base and lowering their transaction costs. For input suppliers, 
it  will  enlarge  their  customer  base.  The  private  sector  contributions  to  TA  activities  will  be  in-kind 
through  the  contribution  of  their  time  in  18  ToT  sessions.  If  on  average  4  private  sector 
representatives join a ToT session for half a day each, this will be a total of 34 person days. If valued 
on average at 250 USD/day total of travel costs plus traders’ opportunity costs (for larger buyer it may 
be more, for smaller trader it may be less), this would amount to USD 9,000.  
C.  Planning, M&E, learning and knowledge management 
141. 
Planning. The SACP will apply a results-based management approach which establishes a 
solid  linkage  between  planning  (including  resource  allocation),  implementation,  monitoring  and 
expected  results.  The  Project  Annual  Work  Plan  and  Budget  (AWPB)  will  be  a  basis  for 
implementation and should clearly describe the strategic direction of the project for the coming years 
by  resenting  a  budget  estimate,  the  expected  results  under  each  component  and  how  these  results 
would be achieved with risk analysis if any. The preparation of AWPBs will be jointly conducted by the 
project management in consultation with DCUs, all implementing partners, private sector, local service 
provider  and  beneficiaries  (farmers  and  women)  where  relevant.  A  participatory  annual  planning 
process  with  stakeholders  will  be  set  up  to  ensure  the  bottom-up  feedback  on  community  needs, 
priorities, contextual opportunities and limitation. 
142. 
Monitoring  and  evaluation.  The  integrated  Monitoring  and  Evaluation  (M&E)  and 
Knowledge  Management  (KM)  system  will  be  developed  in  accordance  with  IFAD  guidelines  and 
government frameworks. It will have with three main objectives as following:  
(i)  monitoring  results:  it  will  enable  the  tracking  project  outputs  and  outcomes,  within 
farmer groups and communities, between genders, age groups and different social groups.  
(ii)  implementation  guiding  and  policy  dialogue:  the  information  and  analysis  of  data  will 
support  timely  results-based  management  at  all  levels  to  develop  profitable  and 
sustainable activities and to adapt strategies accordingly. It will also support policy decision 
making of MOA to better respond to the challenges of agricultural commercialisation in the 
Southern Bangladesh. 
26 
People’s Republic of Bangladesh 
Smallholder Agricultural Competitiveness Project (SACP) 
Final project design report 
(iii)  knowledge  sharing  and  scaling  up  of  good  practices:  the  integrated  M&E  and  KM 
system  will  capture  lessons,  shortcomings  for  risk  management,  good  practices, 
successful innovations and technologies options or scaling up. 
143. 
Strategic  principles.  The  integrated  M&E  and  KM  system’s features  will  be:  (i)  open  and 
easily  accessible,  i.e.  information  and  knowledge  should  be  available  to  all  stakeholders  and  not 
restricted  to  project  or  MOA  staff;  (ii)  participatory  and  accountable:  the  process  of  planning, 
monitoring and knowledge dissemination will involve associate project stakeholders and beneficiaries 
with two-way communication i.e. upward (to and from government and IFAD) but also downward (to 
and from project stakeholders and target groups) and horizontal (with other projects); (iii) focused on 
analysis, learning and sharing in support of decision-making and policy dialogue, and not merely on 
data  production  and  consolidation;  (iv)  harmonised  with  and  connected  the  government’s  relevant 
information  systems  such  as  Access  to  Information  (a2i)  Programme  and  to  IFAD  country  portfolio 
M&E system; (v)  inclusive  to allow  women, poor and  marginalised groups  participate in the system; 
(vi) strengthening: building capacity and better respond to the people needs and market demand.  
144. 
Monitoring  framework.  The  participatory  M&E  and  KM  system  will  be  decentralized  from 
the Lead Agency at central level to Coordination Units at district, upazila and union levels under the 
guidance of a Project Director at the Project Office with the support from TA and in consultation with 
project  stakeholders.  It  will  incorporate  regular  data  collection  and  feedback  from  beneficiaries  and 
implementing partners. The data will be collected and analyzed at upazila and district levels for both 
outputs  and  outcomes  to  the  extent  possible  prior  to  the  compilation  and  in-depth  analysis  by  the 
Lead Agency at central level. The SACP management will report to IFAD and as well downstream to 
implementing partners and beneficiaries.  
ICT-based  participatory  M&E.  An  ICT-enabled  Management  Information  System  (MIS), 
145. 
possibly through GIS mapping and tablets, will be developed to facilitate the flows of data and timely 
monitor on-going interventions. The standard IFAD Monitoring and Evaluation system (SIMES) excel 
database  will  feed  data  into  the  MIS.  A  computerized  MIS  will  be  designed  to  allow  decentralized 
inputting  of  data  and  centralized  analysis  and  storage  can  serve  as  a  useful  tool  for  managing 
information. The MIS will track financial and technical data on project outputs and outcomes in order 
to  draw  lessons  learnt,  good  practices,  studies  and  other  important  sector  information  analysis  for 
knowledge  sharing  to  all  stakeholders  and  decision  making  at  the  project  management.  The 
information will also be available through the project website and IFADAsia.  
146. 
RIMS  and  logframe.  The  SACP  logical  framework  will  be  used  as  roadmap  for  annual 
planning,  monitoring  and  evaluation.  In  line  with  IFAD’s  revised  results  and  impact  management 
system  (RIMS),  expected  results  will  be  measured  at  two  levels;  outputs  and  outcomes.  Core 
Indicators  (CIs)  and  project-specific  indicators  are  selected  and  integrated  in  the  logical  framework 
and will be monitored through its participatory M&E and KM system. It will serve as a tool with which 
IFAD can report to the public on its contribution to broader country results and the SDGs. The project 
logframe will also be linked to the economic and financial analysis. Data will be disaggregated by sex, 
age (youth or adult), sector (crop/fruit/vegetables/legumes etc) and other socio-economic status to the 
extent possible so as to enable a proper assessment as to whether the project is reaching its intended 
target beneficiaries, poor households, smallholder farmers, women and vulnerable groups.  
147. 
Linkage SACP with COSOP. SACP will identify relevant project indicators to COSOP level. 
In  addition  to  the  logframe  and  RIMS  indicators,  the  project  will  report  on  the  COSOP  indicators  to 
IFAD country office (CO) in Bangladesh on a semi-annual basis. The results will be consolidated and 
analysed  at  the  country  level  to  integrate  into  excel  and  on-line  COSOP  monitoring  and  evaluation 
system.  For  this  purpose,  the  project  will  use  SIMES  for  data  storage  and  analysis.  The  COSOP 
monitoring  system  will  be  used  to  track  and  improve  the  capacity  of  all  projects  in  achieving  the 
strategic objectives mentioned in the COSOP. 
148. 
Reporting and studies. The following will be the key elements of the project M&E system: 
(i)  a  practical  M&E  manual  detailing  clear  objectives,  scope,  reporting  structure,  staffing,  capacity 
27 
People’s Republic of Bangladesh 
Smallholder Agricultural Competitiveness Project (SACP) 
Final project design report 
building plan, roles and responsibilities, budget and M&E-related activities with timeframe; (ii) annual 
M&E  plans;  (iii)  logical  framework  reporting:  semi-annual  update  on  the  achievements  of  each 
indicator set  in the project  logframe, even  in the first few  years of implementation when higher-level 
results  are  not  yet  expected;  (iv)  Management  information  system  (v)  baseline18,  mid-term  outcome 
and impact assessment studies; (vi) annual and semi-annual reports to be submitted to IFAD; (vii) risk 
assessment  and  exist  strategy;  (viii)  research  and  thematic  studies  and  (ix)  regular  field  visits  and 
annual joint implementation reviews. 
149. 
Theory  of  Change  (ToC).  Learning from the experiences of other IFAD-funded projects in 
Bangladesh,  there  is  a  need  to  develop  a  more  comprehensive  and  reliable  M&E  and  KM  system 
whereby  the  project  is  able  to  show  the  outcomes  and  results  intended  by  the  interventions.  The 
project will use the M&E tools together with ToC logic model that provides a roadmap defining where 
the  project  aims  to  reach  and  how  SACP’s  goal  and  development  objective  are  achieved.  The 
assumptions  will  be  monitored  by  concerned  M&E  staff  at  Lead  agency  and  District  Coordination 
Units  (DCUs).  In  addition,  the  ToC  model  also  helps  the  project  in  a  more  realistic  planning.  The 
process will be participatory whereby project staff, project stakeholders and beneficiaries are involved 
in developing the theory as well as in periodical revisions and updates. 
150. 
Learning  and  knowledge  management.  SACP  represents  a  good  linkage  between  high 
value crop production, marketing and commercialization together with nutrition aspect. The dedicated 
M&E concerned staff will also be responsible for knowledge management and learning. Processes for 
learning  start  with  the  various  implementing  agencies.  SACP  will  implement  a  process  of 
internalization,  which  involves  identification  of  key  lessons  for  each  of  these  agencies  and  the 
adoption of these lessons in the processes used by these agencies such as training modules.  
151. 
Knowledge  Management  and  Communication  (KMC)  strategy  will  be  developed  in  line 
with IFAD policy on KM and to ensure that knowledge, technologies and innovations generated within 
the  project  is  systematically  identified,  analysed,  documented  and  shared,  and  that  it  is  used  to:  (i) 
improve  project  performance  and  delivery  of  project  objectives;  (ii)  be  flexible  and  responsive  to 
changing  circumstances;  (iii)  support  the  dissemination  of  innovation  to  the  benefit  of  stakeholders 
throughout the project area and beyond; (iv) provide information to support decisions on up-scaling to 
be made at mid-term review; and (iv) identify important issues to convey to policy makers. Particular 
attention will be given to documenting good practices, successful technologies and innovation model 
for  sustainably-competitive  agriculture.  Information  will  be  shared  with  and  discussed  by  the  multi-
stakeholders’ platforms. Monthly coordinating meeting among all agencies and relevant stakeholders 
will  be  organized  by  DAE  at  district  level  to  discuss  progress  towards  results,  lessons  as  well  as 
current and/or potential implementation issues.  
152. 
Knowledge  tools  and  platform.  Lessons  and  good  practices  will  be  shared  more  widely 
through regular project progress reports, special thematic studies and assessment. A project website 
will be developed within the first year of implementation and used as monitoring tool and knowledge 
sharing  platform.  Data,  information  and  knowledge  will  be  disseminated  via  the  project  website, 
newsletters,  workshops,  seminars  and  IFAD  communication  channels  (IFADAsia  Portal,  Facebook 
etc) beyond the project level. It will also contribute to the Access to Information (a2i) Programme19 of 
Prime  Minister's  Office  which  is  currently  developing  an  agricultural  service  portal  and  e-services. 
Information flow between beneficiaries and implementing partners in the field is of utmost relevance in 
fostering ownership and participation.  
153. 
Knowledge  exchange. Exchange of experience between SACP and other projects will be 
arranged  for  lateral  knowledge  transfer  and  learning  with  the  coordination  support  from  IFAD.  The 
SACP  will  participate  actively  in  country  and  regional  knowledge  networking  activities  in  areas 
relevant  to  the  Project,  including  effectiveness  of  a)  diversified  and  enhanced  HVC  production,  b) 
development of farmers’ groups, c) improvement of technical service support systems in agriculture, 
18 The baseline study will be carried out prior to the start of project implementation.

d)  linking  research  to  farm  production,  e)  differentiated  targeting  approaches  on  mainstreaming 
women,  disadvantaged  and  vulnerable  groups,  f)  value  chain  development,  post-production  loss 
reduction and value addition, g) sustainable water management. Regular contributions to the country 
programme’s database of knowledge management will be expected and the project management will 
be  encouraged  to  take  part  in  experience  sharing  related  to  poverty  alleviation  and  agricultural  and 
rural development in the regions of South Asia and South-East Asia. 
D. 
Financial management, procurement and governance 
154. 
Financial  Management  (FM).  The  proposed  financial  management  arrangements  for  the 
project incorporate a number of measures intended to reduce risks to acceptable levels, ensuring that: 
(i)  the  project  funds  and  assets  created  are  used  for  their  intended  purposes  in  an  efficient  and 
effective  way;  and  (ii)  reliable  and  timely  financial  reports  are  prepared  and  submitted  to  the 
Government and IFAD.  
155. 
Accounting. The accounting policies and procedures of the project will be governed by the 
Government’s  procedures  which  follow  the  cash  basis  of  accounting.  These  standards  are  in  the 
process  of  being  aligned  with  International  Public  Sector  Accounti8ng  Standards  (IPSAS).  The 
existing GoB system outlined in the Project Accounting Manual of the Ministry of Finance will be the 
base  for  the  PIM  and  the  FM  manual.  The  PO  will  have  the  primary  responsibility  to  maintain  an 
adequate  FM  system  across  all  levels  of  implementation  of  the  project  and  to  provide  accurate  and 
timely financial information to the Government and IFAD. 
156. 
The project will procure and adopt an accounting system package conforming international 
standards  during  start-up.  In  addition,  a  simplified  FM  system  will  be  implemented  at  the  District 
Coordination Units to ensure proper reporting to each of the Implementing Agencies. The project will 
guarantee  the  availability  of  resources  to  conduct  periodic  training  on  the  use  of  the  accounting 
software to strengthen the capacity at the district level. 
157. 
As  there  has  been  positive  results  from  the  use  on  an  accounting  software  in  the  country 
programme  which  has  been  recalibrated  to  meet  the  accounting  and  reporting  requirement  for  both 
government and IFAD, MoA should consider using the same software for SACP, which would provide 
the Project better value for money. 
158. 
Financial  reporting.  The  Project  Office  (PO)  will  be  responsible  of  consolidating  the 
financial  information  from  the  Implementing  Agencies  and  to  prepare  semi-annual  and  annual 
(audited)  Financial  Reports  (FRs)  for  all  relevant  parties.  The  Implementing  Agencies  (DAE,  BADC, 
DAM  and  BARI)  will  be  responsible  of  consolidating  the  financial  information  from  the  District 
Coordination Units (DCUs).  The FRs will be consistent with International Accounting Standards and 
the  Project’s  Finance  Manual.  Semi-annual  Financial  Reports  with  accurate  and  updated  financial 
information  will  be  prepared by the PO for submission to IFAD  within 45 days from the end  of each 
semester. 
159. 
Financial  Reports  will  be  produced  directly  from  the  automated  project  accounting  system 
(with the capability to report by component and by category of expenditure), and not from any other 
stand-alone manual or electronic system. The PO and the Implementing Agencies will need to have 
the  capacity  to  record  GoB  contributions,  as  well  as  in-kind  contributions  of  private  companies  and 
beneficiaries, if necessary. 
160. 
Flow of funds and disbursements. There will be two Designated Accounts at the Central 
Bank  of  Bangladesh  under  SAFE  arrangements  to  receive  the  funds  of  the  loan  and  the  grant 
respectively. The DAs will be managed by the PO, and transfers to the Implementing Agencies will be 
made according to consolidated financial information and approved AWPBs. The project will open two 
Project Accounts in local currency to receive transfers from the Designated Accounts at the PO level. 
Also, four project sub-accounts in  local currency  will  be opened for the corresponding implementing 
agencies,  namely  DAE,  DAM,  BADC  and  BARI  to  receive  transfers  from  the  Designated  Accounts. 
Three  separate  accounts  will  be  opened  in  every  District  Coordination  Unit  (one  per  each 
29 
People’s Republic of Bangladesh 
Smallholder Agricultural Competitiveness Project (SACP) 
Final project design report 
Implementing Agency); participating BARI stations  will also open and maintain their accounts  where 
applicable. 
161. 
The Project Office will be responsible for transferring project funds to the operating accounts 
of the  Implementing  Agencies.  These transfers will  be treated as advances  at the PO,  with monthly 
reporting on the use of funds, and these accounts will appear as unreconciled  items on the financial 
statements until they have been accounted for and liquidated. 
162. 
A start-up advance will be provided once the financing agreement has become effective to 
facilitate  implementation  readiness,  pending  satisfaction  of  the  disbursement  conditions  specified  in 
the financing agreement.  The ceiling of the start-up  will be  agreed  upon  at negotiations based  on a 
realistic plan.  
163. 
Transfers to entities implementing SACP activities will be treated as advances, with monthly 
reporting on the use of funds, and these accounts will appear as unreconciled items on the financial 
statements until they have been accounted for and liquidated. 
164. 
Internal  controls.  SACP  will  be  required  to  establish  adequate  internal  controls  and 
procedures in the PIM and in the Financial Manual to guarantee: (a) operations are being conducted 
effectively  and  efficiently;  (b)  financial  and  operational  reporting  is  reliable;  (c)  applicable  laws  and 
regulations are being complied with, and (d) assets and records are safeguarded. 
165. 
At a minimum, the procedures should include the following measures: (a) Reliable personnel 
with  clear  responsibilities  i.e.  segregation  of  duties;  (b)  Adequate  financial  records  management 
system with complete audit trail; (c) Physical safeguard, including use of safe, locks, guards, limited 
access,  and  access  by  authorized  persons  to  provide  security  for  program  assets;  (d)  Independent 
check, with procedures made subject to random independent reviews. 
166. 
Internal  Audit.  Internal  auditing  will  be  carried  out  by  private  firm  twice  in  the  life  of  the 
project.  The  preparation  of  the  audit  plan  will  take  into  account  the  different  levels  and  agencies 
involved in the implementation. Its cost will be incorporated in the cost table and AWPB. 
167. 
External  audit.  The  Foreign  Aided  Projects  Audit  Directorate  (FAPAD)  of  the  Office  of  the 
Comptroller & Auditor General (OC&CAG) of Bangladesh will conduct an audit of the project’s annual 
financial statements within six months of the end of the fiscal year. The audit will be carried out on a 
yearly basis and in compliance with INTOSAI and the IFAD Guidelines on Project Audits. IFAD may 
request external audit if needs of audit are not addressed in line with the agreed ToRs or irregularities 
in the auditing exercise are found and not corrected.  
168. 
External  auditors  will  be  required  to  express  their  opinion  based  on  IFAD  Guidelines  on 
Project Audits. A detailed management letter containing the assessment of the internal controls, audit 
findings,  update  on  previous  audit  observations,  compliance  with  IFAD  Financing  Agreement 
covenants  and  suggestions  for  improvement  will  be  prepared  and  submitted  together  with  the  audit 
report.  
169. 
Procurement.  Procurement  of  goods,  works  and  services  of  SACP  shall  be  carried  out  in 
accordance with the provisions of the Public Procurement Act 2006 (PPA) and the Public Procurement 
Rules 2008 (PPR), to the extent that are consistent with IFAD Procurement Guidelines. If there is any 
conflict between the government and IFAD procedures about any unique procurement, the provisions 
identified  in  IFAD  Project  Procurement  Guidelines  and  IFAD  Project  Procurement  Handbook  as 
referenced by the Financing Agreement shall prevail. 
170. 
Procurement  will  be  conducted  by  the  implementing  agencies  DAE,  DAM,  BARI,  BADC 
according  to  the  level  of  authority  structured  for  the  project.  A  detailed  list  of  common  items  will  be 
prepared for procurement through Project Office. 
171. 
All  the  implementing  agencies  have  the  experience  in  the  procurement  function;  however, 
their  human  resources  capacity  is  assessed  as  not  sufficient  to  handle  the  project  procurement 
30

Smallholder Agricultural Competitiveness Project (SACP) 
Final project design report 
activities.  To minimize  the  associated  risk,  procurement  specialists  will  be  hired  in  the  principal  cost 
centers of the project. 
172. 
All National Competitive Bidding (NCB) procurement under SACP will be done through the 
electronic  government  procurement  (e-GP).  As  an  added  risk  mitigation  measure,  IFAD  would 
undertake prior and post review of procurement decisions. 
E. 
Supervision 
173. 
Supervision.  IFAD  will  administer  the  loan,  grant  and  supervise  the  project.  IFAD’s  annual 
direct  supervision  will  mainly  relate  to  the  project  financial  management,  its  physical  and  financial 
progress,  implementation  management’s  efficiency  and  implementing  agencies’  performance  at  all 
levels.  Supervision  missions  will  primarily  address  issues  such  as:  (i)  Project  fiduciary  aspects,  (ii) 
Implementation  progress,  (iii)  Outputs  and  outcomes  under  related  components  and  modules,  (iv) 
Sustainability,  (v)  Risks  and  opportunities,  (vi)  Innovations  and  knowledge  management,  and  (vii) 
Poverty focus, targeting and gender mainstreaming. 
174. 
A  Mid-term review will be  conducted by IFAD. This is tentatively scheduled for  2020 at the 
end of the third full  year of implementation.  A key function of the MTR  will be to review outreach to 
target groups and target segments’ capture issues, and to adjust project focus, budget and design if 
considered necessary.  
175. 
Implementation support will be provided by IFAD as follow-ups of its direct supervision and 
progress review, and as response to possible supports required by the  project office. Support will be 
conducted on a demand-driven basis and in accordance with needs identified.  
F.  Risk identification and mitigation 
176. 
The Project design aligns the IFAD investments with the Government’s development policies 
and  strategies  in  poverty  alleviation,  agriculture  and  rural  development;  it  is  based  on  the 
development needs and priorities that related stakeholders and beneficiaries identified and proposed. 
Risks  associated  to  the  Project  should  therefore  relate  to  the  uncertainties  caused  by  the  climate 
changes,  and  the  fast-changing  socio-economic  environment,  or  being  of  operational  nature  mostly. 
Several  risk  factors  have  been  reviewed  in  accordance  to  their  coherence  to  the  Project.  Some  of 
them  are  closely  associated  to  the  project  implementation,  others  more  on  a  continued  basis,  as 
shown in the following table.

The  SACP  economic  and  financial  cost  benefit  analysis  estimated  that  the  project 
investments  in  enhanced  production  of  high-value  crops,  processing  and  marketing  of  high-value 
crops,  and  surface  water  management  would  result  in  agricultural  diversification  and  productivity 
increase.  The  analysis  estimated  the  following  benefits:  (1)  increased  production  and  productivity  of 
high  value-added  crops  (non-paddy  crops);  (2)  improved  agricultural  technology  and  practices  that 
increase  productivity;  (3)  improved  water  security  for  agricultural  production  to  reduce  water

availability  risk  due  to  salinization  and  seasonal  fluctuation;  (4)  improved  marketing,  post-harvest 
management, and value addition (agro-processing); (5) labor and job creation. 
181. 
The  analysis  was  estimated  for  180,000  ha  of  targeted  areas  operated  by  10,000 
commodity  interest  groups  with  an  average  household  landholding  of  0.72  ha  (average  of  the 
Southern  region  of  Bangladesh).  The  average  membership  in  each  group  is  around  25  people,  and 
the  total  cumulative  numbers  (beneficiaries)  will  be  250,000  people  in  the  target  areas.  The 
cumulative landholdings by the targeted population will be 180,000 ha in the target 30  upazilas in 11 
districts in the southern part of Bangladesh.  
182. 
The project benefits were quantified based on crop production models of representative 
farms  in  the  Southern  region.  Separate  crop  budgets  were  prepared  for  each  representative 
commodity. The major crops that  were covered  in the analysis are the following: pulse crops (mung 
beans and grass pea), oil seeds (sunflower seeds), spices (garlic and turmeric), fruits (sapota, mango, 
hog  plum,  guava,  and  water  melon),  vegetables  (pumpkin,  eggplant,  okra,  tomatoes,  ridge  gourd, 
bitter gourd, arum, and country bean), and paddy (high yield Aus variety).  
183. 
The  project  as  a  whole  was  estimated  to  have  an  economic  rate  of  return  (IRR)  of  16 
percent,  the  net  present  value  (NPV)  was  around  BDT  2,482  million  with  a  BCR  of  1.30.  The 
economic return would be robust, and the return could be maintained above the discount rate of 10% 
even with a cost increase and benefit decrease of 20% as well as a delay of benefit generation for 2 
years.   
D.  Sustainability 
184. 
The Project incorporates numerous features designed to promote long term sustainability. 
185. 
Institutional  sustainability.  In  direct  response  to  the  Government’s  Master  Plan  for 
Agricultural  Development  in  Southern  Region  of  Bangladesh,  the  Project  will  support  both  demand 
and supply sides of agricultural transformation, assist the smallholders to graduate from subsistence 
farming to market integration, and strengthening the country’s institutional technical support system in 
the  area  of  agricultural  extension  and  marketing,  action  research  and  irrigation  management.  The 
continued  strengthened  institutional  technical  support  by  MoA  and  its  technical  departments’ 
operational structures is the best guarantee of sustainability.  
186. 
Operational  sustainability.  The  design  gives  attention  to  the  market-led  value  chain 
development  in  partnership  with  private  sector  operators  facilitated  by  farmers’  groups  and  other 
active  market  players  and  supporters.  Support  will  also  be  placed  on  the  development  of  improved 
market access and linkage involving better processing, transport efficiency, post-harvest loss control, 
storage  facilities,  contractual  relationships,  production  of  quality  products,  and  capture  of  premium 
prices; 
187. 
Enhanced  production  methods  and  technologies  aim  at  introducing  responsive  and 
competitive coping strategies in horticulture HVCs and taking into account the environment protection 
and  conservation,  climate-smart  and  based  on  income  generation  specialization  and  diversification, 
instead of ordering pre-identified production activities. HVC production models are compatible with the 
local production activities, which are profitable at current prices with full accounting of operating and 
capital costs. Demand for these products is based on local consumption and market, with potential of 
export sales; 
188. 
Technical  sustainability.  The  technical  service  support  is  designed  to  promote  increased 
responsiveness of the extension  and marketing services to real needs, and increased accountability 
to  farmer  clients.  Government  is  already  showing  increased  willingness  to  strengthen  the  service 
support system in  line  with the results being  achieved; success of such service support mechanism 
can be referred to the system as good practice and for systematic replication;

Country and rural context background 
A. 
Country Background 
With  a  population  of  about  150  million21 living  in  an  area  of  147,570  square  kilometres  (or 
1. 
1,045 persons per square  kilometre), Bangladesh  is  one  of the most densely  populated countries in 
the world. About 80 percent of the population lives in rural areas and is mainly engaged in agriculture 
and related non-farm activities. More than two thirds of the rural population is landless or functionally 
landless (owning less than 0.2 hectares of land), 35 percent are below the national poverty line and 
21 percent are classified as very poor22. Endowed with limited land and other natural resources, and 
with  a high population density,  poverty is  a pervasive problem in rural Bangladesh. Bangladesh has 
the third highest number of poor people in the world. 
2. 
Bangladesh aims to become a middle income country by  2021; to achieve this  will require 
among  others  that  the  Government  of  Bangladesh  (GoB)  overcomes  considerable  challenges  in 
agricultural  development  and  rural  economic  growth.  The  country’s  annual  GDP  growth  averaged 
about 6 percent between 2000 and 2013. Bangladesh has also made noteworthy gains in education 
and health, and is well set to achieve most of the MDGs. Despite these gains, Bangladesh remains a 
poor country, with a 2013 GDP per capita of some US$1,000, and is regularly hit by natural disasters 
that  severely  impact  the  economy,  disproportionally  affecting  the  infrastructure  and  agriculture 
sectors,  as  well  as  vulnerable  groups.  Further,  nutrition  outcomes  have  not  kept  pace  with  the 
progress achieved with most social and economic indicators. 
3. 
Bangladesh  is extremely  vulnerable to the  impact of climate change  and  ranked second in 
the 2016 Climate Change Vulnerability Index23 . The country has already been facing several climate 
change effects such as increasing cyclones, flood frequency probabilities, erosion, inundation, rising 
water  tables,  salt  water  intrusion  and  biological  effects.  Coastal  environments  particularly  at  risk 
include  mangroves,  tidal  deltas  and  low-lying  coastal  plains,  sandy  beaches,  coastal  wetlands, 
estuaries  and  coral  reefs.  These  bio-geophysical  possessions  will  have  consequent  effects  on 
ecosystems and eventually affect socio-economic systems in the coastal zone. 
B.   
Agricultural sector 
4. 
Bangladesh  remains  a  predominantly  agricultural  country.  Although  the  contribution  of 
agriculture to the country’s economic output has declined over the last decade, the agriculture sector 
2012-13 growth rate was 2.17 percent and it remains one of the main contributors to GDP growth, and 
importantly  in  poverty  reduction.  The  majority  of  poor  people  lives  in  rural  areas  and  depend  on 
agriculture for their livelihood, with most being small-scale, marginal and landless farmers owning less 
than  one  acre  of  land,  and  commonly  renting  land  under  share  cropping  arrangements.  Small  and 
marginal farmers comprise approximately 86 percent of the farming community. 
5. 
Agricultural  production  has  increased  substantially  in  Bangladesh  over  the  past  20  years. 
Cropping is dominated by rice and annual rice production has grown from 10 million tons in 1972/73 
to just under 33.9 million tons in 2009/10.  Agricultural sector growth was 4.4 percent in 2009/10, an 
increase  from  4.1  percent  in  the  previous  year.    Expansion  of  farm  output  has  come  from  a 
transformation  of  rice  production  from  extensive  low  input  subsistence  systems  to  highly  intensive 
high  input  systems  using  modern  rice  varieties,  a  large  increase  in  fertiliser  use,  and  a  substantial

increase in irrigation during the dry winter.  The country is now more of less self-sufficient in rice in a 
normal year. There is however no room for complacency as Bangladesh has to import rice following 
bad floods or droughts at critical crop growth periods, and with continued population growth and loss 
of land to urbanisation (about 1 percent of land per year), there is an ever increasing need to produce 
more rice every year. 
6. 
In  the  light  of  the  ‘Soaring  Food  Prices’  seen  globally  in  2008,  the  Government  became 
concerned  that  imports  may  no  longer  be  available  at  affordable  prices,  and  a  new  policy  of  self-
sufficiency  has  been  adopted.    Although  there  is  some  scope  to  increase  production,  the  yield  gap 
between research and farmers’ output for the major rice crops has narrowed.  Moreover, apart from 
increasing population and pressure on land, within agriculture land is being diverted away from staple 
cereal crops to uses such as horticulture, fish ponds, and to grow maize to feed poultry.   To increase 
production while keeping prices as low as possible, he government has also expanded a programme 
of subsidies for inputs (fertilizer, fuel and seeds).  These subsidies account for over three-quarters of 
government expenditure for agriculture.  
7. 
The  Impact  of  Climate  Change. Bangladesh ranked second  in the 2016 Climate Change 
Vulnerability Index and it will likely suffer more from climate change by 2025 than any other country. 
Rainfall is expected to increase by 10-15 percent during monsoon seasons by 2030 and 27 percent 
by 2075; rising sea level is expected to inundate 120,000 square km by 2050; 14 percent more of the 
country  may  become  extremely  prone  to  floods  by  2030;  cyclones  in  the  Bay  of  Bengal  will  occur 
more frequently due to increasing temperature, and the peak intensity of cyclones may increase by 5-
10 percent (Food Planning and Monitoring Unit (FPMU), Ministry of Food). Coastal salinity problems 
will  likely  worsen  as  changing  rain  patterns  reduce  the  amount  of  dry  season  water  supply  from 
upstream  river  sources.  Overall,  crop  production  might  be  reduced  by  30  percent  by  the  end  of  the 
century; rice production could fall by 8 percent, and wheat production by 32 percent by 2050 (FPMU 
2013). Winter crop production would be seriously hampered due to a warmer and drier environment 
during  non-monsoon  seasons,  while  moisture  stress  might  force  farmers  to  reduce  the  area  under 
irrigated rice cultivation.  
8. 
The  proposed  project  is  located  in  the  southern  region  where  climate  change  hazard 
intensity is high in compare to other regions of Bangladesh. Inundated area of southern region would 
increase  by  14  percent;  water  and  saline  intensity  in  soil  and  water  will  increase.  In  lagging  district 
study  it  has  been  shown  the  rank  of  the  bottom  fifteen  districts  which  are  most  exposed  and 
vulnerable to environmental and water related risks and 7 of our project districts are there.  
C. 
Policy context 
9. 
The  Government’s  second  revised  poverty  reduction  strategy  (National  Strategy  for 
Accelerated  Poverty  Reduction:  Step  Towards  Change)  includes  rural  roads,  agriculture,  livestock, 
community-based  fisheries  and  safe  water  and  sanitation  as  focal  areas  for  pro-poor  growth.      The 
strategy states the need to create employment opportunities for women in agriculture and livestock. 
10. 
The broad directions for development over a longer time-span are set out in the Perspective 
Plan for Bangladesh 2010-2021.  Amongst other things, this plan would like to see genuine devolution 
of  power  to  the  local  government  level,  and  also  says  that  in  the  process  of  socio-economic 
development of the country, agriculture will still continue to play a vital role in the long run in terms of 
food security,  generation of income and employment  for the multitudes living  in  the countryside  and 
for eradicating poverty.  
11. 
Master  plan  for  Agricultural  Development  in  the  southern  regions  of  Bangladesh  covers 
south  central,  south  west  and  south  east  of  the  coastal  zone  covering  14  districts.  It  provides  a 
detailed  plan,  estimates of investment need and a list of priority  program. the master plan is  a road 
map  for  an  integrated  agricultural  development  in  the  costal  districts  of  Bangladesh  aiming  at 
sustainable food security, poverty reduction and livelihood development for the poor

Country  Strategic  Opportunities  Program:  (i)  the  livelihoods  of  poor  people  in  vulnerable 
areas  are  better  adapted  to  climate  change;  (ii)  small  producers  and  entrepreneurs  benefit  from 
improved  value  chains;  and  (iii)  marginalized  groups,  including  poor  rural  women,  are  economically

14. 
National  policy  framework.  The  central  goal  of  Bangladesh’s  economic  policy  is  to  reduce 
poverty  in order to lift the  majority  of people above the poverty  line and improve their  quality  of life. 
The  Government  has  attempted  to  take  affirmative  action  to  integrate  gender  equality  and  poverty 
concerns into the development process, as articulated in national policy documents including: (i) the 
National Agriculture Policy (2013); (ii) Draft National Agriculture Extension Policy (2015); (iii) National 
Fisheries  Policy  (1998)  and  Strategy  (2006)  (iv)  National  Livestock  Policy  (2013),  and;  (v)  National 
Food Policy (2006) and Plan of Action (2008-2015) (vi) 7th Five year Plan(2016-2020) These policies 
and  strategies  promote  inclusive  participation  in  agriculture,  including  through  supporting:  (i)  the 
special  needs  of  women,  small  and  marginal  farmers  in  gaining  management  control  through 
formation of community based organizations including women’s farmer groups; (ii) equitable access to 
agricultural inputs, technologies and extension programs; (iii) demand-led, pro-poor, varied extension 
approaches,  achieved  through  participatory  methods;  (iv)  encouraging  women’s  SME  agri-business 
development;  (v)  creating  gender  awareness  in  both  female  and  male  farmers;  (vi)  encouraging 
decision-making  positions  for  women  farmers  in  higher  level  farmer  organizations;  (vii)  promoting 
homestead gardening, and; (viii) increasing the number of women employed by support agencies and 
developing their linkages with women farmers

The World Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy for FY2014 to FY2020 has key  priorities to 
promote agricultural productivity and diversification; to enhance long-term planning for better land and 
water  use  and  natural  resource  management;  and  to  revitalize  and  strengthen  key  infrastructure  to 
protect the population, reduce vulnerability, and secure growth. Impact on twin goals: A holistic long-
term approach to managing economic development of the delta will ensure that growth is sustainable, 
inclusive and reduces the vulnerability of the poor to natural disasters.

Sectors  identified  for  support  include  infrastructure,  dealing  with  climate  change  (including 
water management) and agricultural and food security.  The bank is operating NATP II (co-financed by 
IFAD).  NATP-II  will  support  GoB’s  strategic  priorities  in  agriculture,  i.e.,  increasing  production, 
achieving  food  security,  supporting  adaptation  to  climate  change,  and  enhancing  nutrition  through 
safer  and  more  diversified  food.  It  will  also  contribute  towards  the World  Bank’s  corporate  strategic 
goals of eradicating extreme poverty while promoting shared prosperity.

ADB’s  Country  Operations  Business  Plan  for  2016-18  includes  investments  in  agricultural, 
natural  resources  and  rural  development.  ADB  will  support  food  security  and  rural  livelihoods  by 
helping  to  improve  productivity,  climate-resilient  connectivity,  and  integrated  water  resources 
management.  A  PDA  in  2016l  supported  preparation  of  the  Crop  Diversification  and  Value  Chain

agricultural sector to promote food security and adequate nutrition. USAID increase access to food by 
reducing  post-harvest  losses,  maximizing  input  and  output  market  efficiency,  improving  purchasing 
power and creating alternative income sources from farm and non-farm sources in the targeted areas 
and  populations.  In  connection  with  its  Feed  the  Future  and  Global  Health  Initiatives,  USAID

through  holistic  and  integrated  concepts  and  by  strategically  strengthening  the  capacities  and 
responsibilities of decentralized government institutions for participatory planning and implementation 
of  food  security  interventions.  This  is  achieved  through  a  focus  on  innovative  approaches  and 
interventions  by  primarily  targeting  extreme  poor  and  food  insecure  women  who  have  not  benefited 
from mainstream  poverty  reduction  programmes.  EC  interventions  link  food  security  with  education,

A. 
Poverty in Bangladesh 
1. 
Bangladesh  is  a  lower  middle-income  country  with  medium  but  declining  rates  of  poverty 
among its 160 million people. Sustained economic growth along with steady agricultural improvement 
has  been  fundamental  to  this  reduction.  Sustainability  of  growth,  particularly  agricultural  growth  is, 
however  particularly  vulnerable  to  climate  change.  Given  that  the  agriculture  sector  remains 
fundamentally  important  to  the  country’s  prosperity  and  it  utilises  three-quarters  of  the  scarce  land 
space  of  Bangladesh  and  supports  the  livelihoods  of  the  majority  of  the  population,  it  is  passing 
through  some  immediate  challenges  in  promoting  sustainable  development.  The  challenges  include 
continuing to increase production and achieve recognizable quality standards despite loss of land to 
other uses and climate change. The proportion of the population living under $1.25 a day fell from 49 
percent to -31.524.8 percent between 2000 and 201524, 2010 effectively lifting millions of people out 
of poverty during the period. Overall poverty has declined during the last decade. However, poverty in 
rural areas remains around 3625percent and has not declined as fast as in urban areas. Additionally, 
the proportion of people living in extreme poverty in rural areas is still three times higher than in urban 
areas. 
2. 
 Sustained  economic  growth  was  fundamental  to  this  reduction:  from  2000  to  2014, 
Bangladesh averaged GDP growth of 5.7 percent. But economic activity is overly concentrated, with 
60  percent  of  GDP  generated  in  only  a  few  cities.  Bangladesh  made  strong  gains  in  education  and 
healthcare  during  that  decade,  and  it  achieved  most  of  its  MDG  targets.  It  is  transforming  from  an 
agrarian-base  to  an  industrialised  economy,  with  a  ‘demographic  dividend’  of  young  adults  entering 
the labour market (50 percent of the population is under the age of 25). In addition to demographics, 
increasing urbanisation, growing middle class affluence, and population growth all impact Bangladesh’ 
economic prospects26. 
B. Extent of poverty in the southern region 
3. 
As  would  be  expected,  not  all  regions  of  Bangladesh  fared  uniformly  in  poverty  reduction. 
There  is  a  variation  in  headcount  rate  by  division.  Where  the  average  poverty  rate  of  overall 
Bangladesh  is  30.7  percent  there  are  two  divisions  of  southern  region  i.e.  Barisal  &  Khulna  poverty 
rate is higher than the country average. In Khulna Division maximum poverty rate is in Satkhira district 
i.e. 46.3 percent and in Barisal division maximum poverty rate is in Barisal district i.e.54.6 percent. 
In  Bangladesh  31.5  percent  are  below  the  upper  poverty  lineͥ   based  on  the  household 
4. 
income  and  expenditure  survey  (HIES)  2010  of  BBS  (Table:2:5).  Barisal  division  has  the  highest 
number  of  poor  people  (39.4  percent).  With  respect  to  the  lower  poverty  line  indicating  extreme  or 
hardcore  poverty  Barisal  division  has  also  the  highest  concentration  of  poor  people(26.7  percent) 
compare to Bangladesh(17.6 percent)(Planning Comission,2011).

Relatively high extreme poverty  appears to be spread in 4 distinct  zones prone to  adverse 
ecology,  encompassing  North-West  and  North-East,  South-West  and  South-Central  areas  of 
Bangladesh (poverty Map-1). Coastal areas of greater Khulna and Barisal divisions in the South prone 
to tidal surges and storms (with relatively high incidence of income-poverty but low incidence of non-
income  poverty),  and  pockets  of  ecological  vulnerability  in  the  South-Central  region  encompassing 
Shariatpur, Chandpur, upper Barisal and Lakshmipur i.e. areas in the eco-zone of Meghna Basin (with 
considerable heterogeneity in both income and non-income poverties). 
6. 
The  2012-2013  Multiple  Indicator  Cluster  Survey  (MICS)  by  the  Bangladesh  Bureau  of 
Statistics and UNICEF ranked districts and upazilas in terms of access to education, health, water and 
sanitation.    This  again  clearly  showed  the  coastal  belt  to  be  the  major  poverty-stricken  areas  in  the 
country. 
7. 
Food Security and Nutrition: Despite significant economic progress and poverty reduction, 
a  quarter  of  Bangladesh’s  population  remains  food  insecure.  Despite  the  gains  in  food  production, 
particularly  rice,  inadequate  access  to  food  and  food  insecurity  remain  major  problems  for  a  large 
population segment, particularly during seasonal lean periods. Poor subsistence farming households 
in rural areas face two distinct lean or hungry seasons. The first is in March and April prior to the boro 
harvest, and the second occurs in October and November prior to the Aman harvest. Limited off-farm 
employment combined with lack of food availability, particularly during these lean seasons, obviously 
worsens  household  food  insecurity.  Loss  of  arable  land,  rising  sea  levels,  frequent  flooding  and 
extreme weather patterns, due in part to climate change, compound the threats to food security.  
8. 
Under nutrition is exacerbated by low dietary diversity, with 70 percent of the diet comprised 
of cereals and inadequate protein and micronutrient intake. The 2011 Bangladesh Demographic and 
Health  Survey  (BDHS)  found  that  nearly  7  million  Bangladeshi  children  under  5  years  of  age  suffer 
from  malnutrition,  with  41  percent  of  children  chronically  malnourished  (stunted),  36  percent  of 
children underweight, and 16 percent acutely malnourished (wasted). Malnutrition is a leading cause 
of under-5 child mortality in Bangladesh, with nearly 50 percent of all under-5 child deaths attributable 
to malnutrition. In particular, severe acute malnutrition, which carries a 10-fold increased risk of death 
in  children,  affects  600,000  children  under  5.  Maternal  malnutrition  is  also  high  at  24  percent,  and 
more than one in three children are born with low birth weight, which further increases the risk of child 
under  nutrition  and  child  mortality  (BDHS  2011;  National  Low  Birth  Weight  Study  of  Bangladesh, 
2003–2004). Bangladeshi children also suffer from high rates of micronutrient deficiencies, particularly 
vitamin A, iodine, and iron. Anemia affects 51 percent of preschool children and 42 percent of women 
of childbearing age. Micronutrient deficiencies are widespread, driving high rates of anemia in women 
and  children.  Chronic  under  nutrition  is  more  prevalent  in  rural  areas  and  urban  slums,  with  the 
highest rates in two divisions, Barisal is one of them. 
9. 
 Lagging  region  study  report  has  identified  bottom  15  districts  in  terms  of  two  important 
health indicators such as infant mortality rate and the under five mortality rate. SACP project districts-

give their land for share-cropping.

250unions.  The  selection  of  project  unions  will  be  undertaken  prior  to  or  after  the  project  start-up, 
applying the selection criteria as stipulated in the concept note, taking into consideration the existing 
farmer groupsand their dynamics and potentials in production and marketing in the candidate unions. 
This  list  will  also  be  reviewed  in  accordance  with  available  investment  budget  and  managerial  and 
operational cost efficiency.

least  250,000  rural  households27.  The  selection  of  project  unions  will  be  undertaken  based  on  an 
inclusive targeting strategy focusing on landless, marginal and small farmers, with up to 80 percent of 
beneficiaries coming from these categories. Youth (15-24 years old)28 will constitute up to 20 percent 
of beneficiaries and women participation will target at least30 percent involvement. 
14. 
The project will take farmer groups as its entry point for support to enhance production and 
value  chain  developmentin  the  project  areas.  The  project  will  focus  on  strengthening  agriculture 
competitiveness,  strengthening  sustainable  technical  support  services/facilities,  identification  of 
market  opportunities  and  linking  these  to  an  applied  research,  development  and  extension 
programme to support small farmers, improving access to income opportunities of high value crops, 
developing market linkages, and supporting individual and group organizational capacity. 
15. 
The  project  will  strengthen  the  farmer  groups  to  enhance  production  linked  to  improved 
integration into fresh and processed marketing channels and value added post-harvest management, 
build  competitiveness  in  HVCs  through  multi-stakeholders  platforms  to  build  their  capacity  to 
participate in agricultural value chains. 
16. 
Synergy  will  be  searched  with  ongoing  IFAD-assisted  projects  and  other  development 
projects  in  the  country.  Will  be  leveraged  during  SACP  implementation  the  good  practices  and 
innovative  features  of  linking  value  chain  development  to  rural  financial  services  under  PACE, 
strengthening farmer production and marketing groups and working with private sector players under 
HILIP-CALIP and PACE among others. 
17. 
Indigenous  people:  The  indigenous  people  of  the  country  are  also  disadvantaged  and 
marginalized  in  terms  of  discrimination  in  social,  cultural  and  economic  sphere  who  are  subject  to 
extortion of land grabbers. Bangladesh has about forty-five different indigenous communities, most of 
them  living  in  the  Chittagong  Hill  Tracts,  greater  Mymensingh,  greater  Rajshahi,  greater  Sylhet, 
Patuakhali and Barguna.  
18. 
There are approximately 20 religion-ethnic minority communities in Southwest Bangladesh. 
Typically,  they  are  extremely  poor.  In  many  cases,  minority  ethnic  peoples  maintain  the  same 
occupations  they  have  had  for  generations.  A  study  by  Uttaran  (Rahman,  2011)  covering  10,483 
households across Satkhira and Khulna Districts showed that, among the extreme poor, 74 per cent 
were  Muslim,  25  per  cent  are  Hindus,  and  1  per  cent  are  Christian,  Buddhist  or  adhere  to  another 
religion. Overall, 9 per cent of the extreme poor population are classified as religio-ethnic minorities. In 
other  words,  their  representation  among  the  extreme  poor  significantly  outstrips  their  percentage  of 
the total population. 
D. 
Gender analysis 
19. 
Decision  making.  Women  have  little  participation  in  decision-making  processes  as  their 
economic contribution is rarely recognized by the family and thus society.  Women are responsible to 
carry  out  the  household  activities  including  cooking,  firewood  collection,  and  water,  take  care  of  the 
elderly  and  children.  Still  male  child  get  preference  than  a  female  child  as  female  is  considered  a 
burden for the family because of dowry system. Dowry is practiced in all the places; however, it has 
been  observed  in  FGDs  that  everybody  is  aware  about  the  negative  aspects  of  early  marriage  and 
known about the actual age of marriage for men and women.  
20. 
The upbringing of children is an area where women typically have a strong say, which is not 
surprising  given  women’s  approved  roles  as  mothers.  In  a  World  Bank  study  (2008),  a  larger 
27The government classifies farm sizes as follows: (i) landless – owning 0-0.05 acres, (ii) small farmer, owning 0.05-
2.49 acres, (iii) medium farmers, owning 2.5-7.49 acres, and (v) large farmers, owning >7.50 acres (Secretary-
General’s Report to the General Assembly, A/36/215, 198) 
44

percentage of both older and younger women reported being consulted in decisions about children’s 
schooling,  medical  care,  and  discipline  than  in  decisions  over  their  own  work  for  income,  major 
household expenditures, and their own mobility.  
21. 
There are more women (50.4 percent) than men (49.6 percent) in the southern region and in 
national  level  women  49.94  percent  and  men  50.60  percent  (BBS  2010).  Households  are 
overwhelmingly  male  headed  with  only  5.0  percent  being  headed  by  women  in  the  southern  region 
and 4.6percentin the country (BBS,2010). 
22. 
Indigenous poor women are the most vulnerable as indigenous, as women and as poor. The 
indigenous women are very hard working in agriculture and non-agriculture sector in addition to their 
daily  household  responsibilities.  However,  their  economic contribution  to  household  level  also  is  not 
recognized  by  the  family.  Women  of  the  most  indigenous  communities  are  discriminated  regarding 
patriarchal  and  matrilineal  system.  Therefore,  their  decision-making  power  at  household  level  and 
community level is low. 
23. 
Approximately  12  percent  of  extremely  poor  people  in  Southern  Bangladesh  experience 
some  form  of  disability,  either  from  birth  or  acquired  through  an  accident/  increasing  ill  health.  Of 
these about one third suffer a physical disability; 13 percent reported a visual impairment; 9 percent 
experienced hearing and speech difficulties and 9 percent had learning difficulties. About 33 percent 
of disabled people in the study had multiple impairments. The high frequency of disability amongst the 
extreme poor draws attention to the fact that efforts to reduce extreme poverty must include measures 
to protect and support disabled people (Nokrek et al. 2013). Among them poor women are the most 
vulnerable as disable, as women and as poor. 
24. 
Labour  division.  Women play a large, vital and growing role in agriculture, nutrition, food 
security and a wide range of income-generating activities. Production activities largely undertaken by 
women  include  post-harvest  activities,  processing  and  preservation  of  crops.  Women  are  also 
involved  in  seed  preservation,  cow  fattening  and  milking,  and  fish  net  making.  Relative  to  men, 
women are (i) involved in homestead agricultural activities, including operating homestead ponds and 
plant  nurseries;  (ii)  in  charge  of  small-scale  fruits  and  vegetables,  poultry  and  goat  rearing;  (iii) 
engaged in production of perishable, but often nutrient-dense foods; and (iv) involved in production for 
home consumption rather than for the market. Men are more engaged in field-based agriculture and 
larger-scale, higher value business activities further from the home 
25. 
Traditionally, women have been less involved in rice production than men, particularly in the 
field-based  stages.  However,  their  roles  and  responsibilities  have  started  to  increase  largely  due  to 
male  out-migration  within  Bangladesh,  or  abroad.  They  are  becoming  involved  in  all  aspects  of 
production,  whilst  at  the  same  time  finding  it  difficult  to  recruit  sufficient  hired  labor  in  the  peak 
transplanting and harvesting season (Gurung et al. 2014).  A rapid gender assessment in agriculture 
(Naved  et  al.  2011),  which  included  several  locations  in  southwestern  Bangladesh,  did  not  reveal 
much change in roles and responsibilities.  
26. 
The following Table 4 summarizes the key findings. 
Agricultural activities 
  Women are economically involved in activities performed in and around the 
home.  These  include  the  pre-production  and  post-harvest  stages  of  major 
field  crops.  They  are  also  the  major  producers  of  small-scale,  homegrown 
vegetables,  poultry  and  livestock.  Women-produced  items  are  typically 
directed towards home consumption. 
  Men produced field crops are destined for the market. 
Marketing 
  Women may sell goods they have produced themselves at the farm gate if 
the  amount  involved  is  tiny.  However,  men  are  involved  if  quantities  are 
larger, and usually keep the proceeds. 
  Men are almost entirely responsible for marketing.

Decision 
  Women  from  the  largest  households  are  the  least  involved  in  agricultural 
activities. Women from small farm and landless households undertake value 
chain  activities,  whether  home  based  or  not.  Nevertheless,  they  rarely 
engage in marketing. 
  Small holder and landless women have access to micro-credit whereas men 
have access to institutional sources of credit 
  Women  tend  to  work  on  low-technology  activities  whereas  men  undertake 
high technology activities. These technologies are typically designed for use 
in the fields, where women are rarely active. Even if the technology is used 
in the household compound it is usually used by men, due  to strongly held 
beliefs  that  women  cannot  operate  machinery.  This  argument  is  prevalent 
even though female wage laborers frequently use such machines. Men tend 
to own all machinery. 
  Men  have  access  to  more  sources  of  information,  and  they  are  better 
reached by the extension services. 
  Regardless  of  social  status,  men  dominate  all  decisions  about  the  use  of 
land,  and  crop  selection.  Even  if  women  are  consulted  men  take  the  final 
decision. Men typically decide how to use micro-credit, even if procured by 
women. 
  Women  may  take  decisions  on  small  scale  poultry  and  livestock.  In  a  few 
cases,  women  who  own  larger  poultry  units  may  be  key  decision-makers. 
This said, male support is critical to their enterprise. 
In small farms and landless households men tend to decide whether women 
can  take  up  work  as  daily  laborers,  and  define  the  terms  of  their 
engagement. 
 
27. 
Access  to  credit.    Most  farmers  have  hardly  any  investable  surplus.  They  usually  borrow 
money  to  meet  their  deficit.  In  the  southern  region  26  percent  household  resort  to  borrowing  (BBS-
2010). Among project districts Household borrowing is quite high in Borguna (45 percent), followed by 
Bagerhat  and  Satkhira(40  percent)  each  and  Patuakhali(39  percent).  About  one  half  of  the 
households borrow for agriculture purpose.  
28. 
Specialised Bank like Krishi Bank are a major source of agricultural credit. According to data 
613  Micro  finance  Institutions  including  Grameen  Bank,125  (20  percent)  are  local  regional  NGOs 
based  in  the  southern  region.  As  total  demand  for  credit  far  outweighs  its  supply.  It  is  roughly 
estimated that 80 percent of the volume of credit comes from non institutional sources where private 
money Landers dominate. They charge interest on loan at high rates generally 10 percent per month. 
Women  are  the  major  borrowers  of  NGO  micro-credit.  In  Fakirhat  and  Kachua  reported  that  few 
farmers' co-operatives are lending money among the members.   
29. 
Access  to  technology.  There  are  categories  of  discussion  topics  for  farmers  group  such 
as-paddy/field crop, homestead gardening and nutrition awareness, rearing of big animal such as-cow 
and  small  animal  such  as-poultry  &  goat,  social  and  group  management  issues,  etc.  Generally, 
women  members  are  targeted  for  homestead  gardening,  nutrition  education,  and  small  animal 
rearing.  In  the  visited  IPM  and  IFMC  farmers  group  the  poorest  categories  -  landless,  small  and 
marginal  farmers  particularly  women  access  to  extension  services  ensured.  Interventions  including 
technology  development  to  support  homestead  gardening  and  reduce  women’s  workloads  will  be 
important.  There  is  also  the  risk  that  post-harvest  technological  development  may  reduce  the 
involvement of women, with men replacing this work. While this may reduce women’ time constraints, 
it may also contribute to their devaluation and lack of access to improved technologies.

  Group-based initiatives hold promise for overcoming scale issue in agricultural production 
by women 
  Providing  women  access

land(dike/embankment)  and 
agricultural marketing system 
  Women appropriate smart technology for activities they  get  involved  with  may  increase 
 
women’s efficiency and involvement in agriculture 
ICT  and  particularly  widespread  cell  phone  availability  create  opportunities  for  easy 
access to information and market despite limited mobility  
  Extension  Service    responsive  to  female  farmers’  needs  along  with  more    training  & 
exchange visit may help women overcome the knowledge gap 
  Campaign using role models might help overcoming some cultural barriers 
32. 
Gender  Focus.To  achieve  the  above,  it  will  be  necessary  for  the  project  to  undertake 
substantial advocacy and capacity building activities. There will be a Gender and Safeguard Advisor in 
the PMU and training in gender analysis will be carried out for project staff with a one day workshop to 
be  held  in  the  year  1.  The  workshop  will  be  facilitated  by  the  Gender  Advisor  with  the  support  from 
IFAD.  Following  this,  the  project  will  organize  advocacy  workshops  to  sensitize  local  government 
officials,  elected  representatives  and  private  sectors  to  support  for  women  as  producer,  agro 
entrepreneur, value chain actor and as part of market operating group.     
33. 
With such a large and varied involvement of women in producer, agro processing and value 
chain and water interest group and enterprise activities there will inevitably be some lessons that will 
enable better handling of gender issues. These lessons should be captured by Supervision Missions, 
the  MTR,  and  special  studies  in  order  to  be  used  for  improving  the  design  of  specific  gender 
initiatives.  The  PMU,  and  specifically  the  Gender  Advisor,  will  be  expected  to  prepare  gender  data 
sheet  for  assessing  monthly  gender  progress.  An  annual  gender  report  will  be  generated  which  will 
cover both qualitative and quantitative gender progress. 
F. National policies and gender 
34. 
Bangladesh  seventh  Five  Year  Plan  (SFYP)  has  given  priorities  to  the  geographically 
disadvantaged  areas/lagging  regions  with  special  consideration  on  Rangpur,  Barisal,  Khulna  and 
Rajshahi  division.  It  has  also  acknowledged  the  social  barriers  for  women  who  are  mostly  the 
excluded,  disempowered  and  vulnerable  members  of  the  society  who  cannot  participate  more 
effectively in economic activities outside home and limited access to essential public services. Female 
headed households (4.6 percent) are more susceptible to fall in extreme poverty when they lose the 
male earning member of the family due to abandonment, divorce or death. Consistence with NSAPR-
II  (Moving  Ahead:  National  Strategy  for  Accelerated  Poverty  Reduction-II),  the  SFYP  focuses  on

Appendix 2:  Poverty, targeting and gender 
establishing the overall rights of women to achieve gender equality and empower women to include in 
the mainstream of development activities. 
35. 
The gender vision of the 7th Five Year Plan is that of establishing “a country where men and 
women will have equal opportunities and rights and women will be recognized as equal contributors in 
economic,  social  and  political  development”.  Under  the  objective  of  Improve  women's  human 
capabilities one of the sub action area is women Opportunities to participate in trade fairs and higher 
levels of the value chains would be created. Scope for women at different levels of the value chain of 
different products would be identified, disseminated and supported with technology and inputs.  
36. 
In SFYP it has been stated that women’s more employment opportunities and wages outside 
the  household  with  equal  pay  for  equal  work  through  ensuring  a  safe  workplace,  transportation 
facilities and separate toilet facilities will be ensured. Rural women will be encouraged and supported 
to  participate  more  in  rural  non-farm  activities  in  order  to  reduce  rural  poverty.  Moreover,  the  SFYP 
has emphasized on the priority of disadvantaged women in social protection programs to protect from 
economic  vulnerability  and  risk  due  to  natural  disasters  by  assessing  their  coping  strategies  and 
providing small and micro-credit supports to them. Women’s employment opportunities will be created 
in  the  agriculture  sector  along  with  all  kinds  of  extension  services  and  increased  participation  of 
women  in  non-crop  agricultural  sector  will  be  ensured.  In  addition,  women’s  participation  in  the 
marketplace and access to local water resources for fish production will be ensured.   
37. 
In 1997 the government formulated a National Action Plan (NAP) for implementation of the 
Beijing Platform for Action which focused on gender mainstreaming in government departments. The 
goals of the NAP are given below:  
  To make women’s development an integral part of the national development program;  
  To  establish  women  as  equal  partners  in  development  with  equal  roles  in  policy  and  decision 
making in the family, community, and the nation at large;  
  To remove legal, economic, political, or cultural barriers that prevent the exercise of equal rights 
by undertaking policy reforms and strong affirmative actions; and  
  To  raise/create  public  awareness  about  women’s  different  needs,  interests,  and  priorities  and 
increase commitment to bring about improvements in women’s position and condition.  
4. 
The government has formulated a National Policy for Women’s Advancement, 2004 that aims 
at eliminating all forms of discrimination against women by empowering them through providing better 
options to ensure their participation in private and public life.  
G. 
Conclusion 
38. 
Therefore,  the  approach  of  targeting  poor  farm  households  particularly  women  to  enhance 
competitiveness  in  terms  of  HVC  production,  processing  and  marketing  will  develop  access  to  
income by providing them training, input and development of market linkage.  
39. 
In addition, the SACP project is fully in line with the national poverty reduction strategy and 
7th Five Year Plan as well as IFAD’s COSOP, Bangladesh, Strategic framework and targeting strategy 
regarding gender mainstreaming in project planning and implementation activities.

IFAD in Bangladesh. IFAD has 40 years’ experience working in Bangladesh and supported 
29  projects  in  a  flagship  partnership.  IFAD  currently  funds  six  projects 29  focused  on  rural 
infrastructure, livelihoods development and microfinance, with a total budget of USD 1.93 billion that 
includes IFAD financing of USD 717 million. IFAD’s current Country Strategic Opportunities Program 
(COSOP,  2012-2018)  is  consistent  with  the  government’s  poverty  alleviation  and  food  sovereignty 
strategies  stated  in  the  Seventh  Five  Year  Plan  and  the  National  Agriculture  Policy.  The  objectives, 
targeting,  and  investment  strategies  articulated  in  COSOP  were  discussed,  elaborated  and  agreed 
with the Government of Bangladesh. IFAD’s strategic position in Bangladesh focuses on targeting the 
poorest in rural areas, including marginal smallholder farmers and women; supporting marketing and 
commercialization  for  smallholder  farmers  and  small  entrepreneurs;  agriculture  transformation;  and 
mitigating the adverse impact of climate change. The programme has traditionally focused mainly on 
rural  infrastructure  and  strengthening  access  to  microfinance  in  rural  areas,  but  has  recently  added 
technology advancement and diversification of farming systems to its project portfolio.  
2. 
Performance.  The  country  portfolio  demonstrated  a  satisfactory  performance  as  a  whole 
and  the  COSOP  2012  –  2018  relevance  and  effectiveness  were  confirmed  by  the  COSOP  MTR  in 
November 2015. 
3. 
At its mid-term, the COSOP was on track to meet its stated objectives and targets. Reaching 
more  than  4,162,609  individuals  (direct  and  indirect  beneficiaries).  At  the  impact  level,  413,831 
households have reported improved income/ assets and 212,142 households reported improved food 
security, exceeding the COSOP targets.  
4. 
The mid-term review of COSOP concluded that implementation of the program was on track 
in contributing towards achievement of the stated strategic objectives for COSOP 2012 (adaptation to 
climate  change,  improved  value  chains  and  greater  market  access,  and  social  and  economic 
empowerment  of  marginalized  groups,  including  poor  rural  women).  Substantial  progress  was 
achieved in supporting improvement of agricultural productivity through technological innovations, and 
development of micro-enterprises. The review recommended that future investments should consider 
a more clear-cut focus on agriculture and related issues. IFAD should focus on important aspects of 
agriculture,  e.g.  strengthening  investment  in  extension  and  research,  supply  chain  development, 
intensification, diversification, livestock, and particularly inland fisheries, which is a major and growing 
export  commodity.  The  review  considered  that  such  a  project  would  support  the  government’s 
objective of achieving a far-reaching reduction in rural poverty, 
5. 
IFAD  country  programme  in  support  of  Government  development  priorities,  is  considered 
responsive to the changing context and needs of the target population. The portfolio has experienced 
a  shift  towards  emphasis  on  climate  change  awareness  and  promotion  and  linkages  between 
infrastructure  and  livelihoods  resilience  to  climate  change  has  been  strengthened;  as  well,  the 
portfolio  is  demonstrating  a  subtle  but  important  shift  in  promoting  commercialization  and  economic

Lessons learned and good practices from IFAD ongoing-PACE project 
  Replication  and  scaling  up.  PACE  builds  on  PKSF’s  successful  implementation  experience  of  three 
previous  IFAD  funded  projects,  namely  Microfinance  and  Technical  Support  (MFTS)  Project, 
Microfinance for Marginal and Small Farmers (MFMSF) Project and Finance for Enterprise Development 
and Employment Creation (FEDEC) Project. 
  Synergies gain from the integration of value chain approach along with microcredit programme. 
The  PACE  project  supports  enterprise  development  through  providing  technical,  technological  and 
marketing support in different economic subsectors (both farm and off-farm) that have growth potentials 
to 300,000 microentreprenurs. At the same time, the project facilitates access to financial services (loan) 
for running various enterprises including trade, farming, processing and service sectors.  
  Working with MFIs/Partner Organisations through an Apex body: PSKF provides a strategic project 
entry  point,  to  work  with  an  Apex  body  that  has  more  than  200  Partner  Organisations  (POs).  In  this 
structure,  PACE  and  earlier  projects  with  PKSF  are  able  to  maintain  consistency  at  PKSF  level  and 
guidelines, yet POs are able to adjust given context at local level. 
  Strong  partnership  with  national-wide  Partner  Organizations.  Presence  of  POs  in  the  field  helps 
reaching  out  beneficiaries,  supporting  VCD  sub-projects  and  expanding  microfinance  coverage.  Plus, 
many  POs  provide  Business  Development  Support  (BDS)  services  and/or  other  service  provision 
(access to inputs, veterinary services, etc.), that – in combination with the Microcredit – boost VC actors 
capacity  to  produce  more  and  in  higher  and  more    consistent  quality,  hence  meeting  requirements  of 
target markets. 
  Capacity  building  on  enterprise  management  and  promotion  of  private  business.    The  project 
follows  a  rigorous  due  diligence  and  assessment  process  before  awarding  a  VCD  project  and  sub-
projects. Business cluster mapping is used as a monitoring tool for the strategic management decision 
including sub-sector analysis and intervention plan. Consequently, the approved value chain proposals 
reflect  the  basic  principles  of  a  value  chain  development  approach  where  different  market  actors  are 
identified,  market  constraints  are  captured  and  possible  interventions/activities  to  address  those 
constraints are suggested.  
  Preliminary value chain assessment is required. Based on PACE’s experience, it is learned that the 
proposal  development  stage  captures  only  a  synopsis  and  not  the  detail  understanding  of  the  market 
system, the VCD project should begin with a thorough assessment of the respective value chain. Future 
investments  should  focus  on  improved  market  opportunities,  market-driven  interventions  and  activities 
that lead to enhanced quality production and better price premium.  
  Women and youth engagement in VCD. More than half of the VCD beneficiaries are women. They are 
economically  empowered  as a  result  of self-employment,  access  to  credit and control  over  productive 
and  household  assets.  Thus  the  project  has  changed  the  local  traditional  mindset  towards  a  more 
modern  social  status  of  women.  Furthermore,  specific  preference  of  ME  capacity  building  program  is

given to young entrepreneurs as they have potential and are much more active than other age groups.  
  Promotion  of  technologies  and  innovation. A range of proven technologies and innovation is being 
implemented  by  PACE  such  as  crab  hatchery,  perch/macha  housing  for  goat  rearing  and  floriculture 
which  increase  the  productivity  and  income  of  the  microenterprises.  Furthermore,  PACE  is  creating 
more innovative financial products and services based on demands such as lease finance and start-up 
capital loan, livestock insurance combined with animal health services.

The project will support production enhancement, identify market opportunities for both fresh 
and  processed  products,  value  added  post-harvest  management,  build  competitiveness  in  HVCs  to 
move  households  from  subsistence  farming  into  commercial  farming  through  four  components.    As 
stated  in  the  concept  note:  Component  1  will  focus  on  identification  of market  opportunities  through 
price  analysis,  interaction  with  market  intermediaries,  gap  analysis,  supported  by  developing 
production and farmers training and technology adoption through adaptive research; Component 2 on 
linkage  to  markets  through  private  sector  and  implementation  of  appropriate  post-harvest  handling 
and/or  processing;  Component  3  dedicated  to  infrastructure  and  reinforcing  water  management 
efficiency and Component 4 for project management. The project builds on the assumption that with 
the opening of the Padma bridge in 2018, many farmers of the southern districts will have increased 
opportunities  to  sell  their  products  to  Dhaka  markets  (high  value  crops,  vegetables,  legumes  and 
fruits),  the  shortened  transit  times  will  expand  the  opportunities  for  high  value  fresh  produce  that  is 
properly picked, packed and transported and where the project can play a significant role in improving 
current  practices.  The  focus  will  be  to  enhance  production  quantity  and  quality  through  appropriate 
productive infrastructures, quality agriculture inputs and training of farmers and value chain actors, as 
well  as,  linking  farmers  and  their  groups  to  private  dealers  and  traders  to  enhance  fair  contract 
farming30 and postharvest and processing contracts. 
2. 
Components Synergy: At the very onset, the project  will conduct a market-led research on 
assessment  and  prioritization  of  HVC  value  chains  which  will  be  the  gateway  for  making  synergies 
among  the  components  associated  with  research,  extension,  marketing  and  major  inputs  (seed  and 
irrigation).  At  inception  stage,  findings  of  this  research  will  showcase  which  value  chains  to  be 
prioritized,  market  and  action  research  to  be  conducted,  technologies  and  inputs  to  be  promoted, 
products  to  be  marketed  by  considering  competitiveness  on  the  top.  Following  this  onset  research, 
public, private, producers partnership (4Ps) consultation will be conducted in each project Upazila for 
further  validation  of  prioritized  HVCs,  constraints  associated  with  varieties,  production,  irrigation, 
market, etc. which finally attributed to make harmony among agencies involved with research (BARI), 
extension  (DAE),  inputs  (BADC)  and  marketing  (DAM)  as  well  as  private  sectors.  Moreover, 
Producers Groups (PGs) will be strengthened (old) or mobilized (new) and 4-5 lead farmers from each 
PG  will  be  graduated  to  Market-led  Farmers  Field  School  (MFFS).  The  curriculum  of  MFFS  will 
embrace  HVC  production  including  soil  fertility  management,  good  agriculture  practice  (GAP), 
nutrition  and  food  safety,  water  management,  post  –harvest  management,  value  addition,  market 
linkage, group dynamics, gender issues, etc. The MFFS will play as a catalyst for making synergies 
among agencies, private sectors and components activities.

Smallholders are living in a fast-changing environment of agricultural transformation, facing 
challenge  of  moving  out  of  subsistence  farming  to  be  part  of  the  commercial  farming.  At  very 
operational level, this project will provide immediate reaction to the challenge, by responding to: 
(1)  What to produce to be marketable, instead of trying to sell what is produced, 
(2)  How to produce what is marketable, and 
(3)  How to market and manage for increased price premium share for the smallholders

struggling  with  the  climate  related  diversified  hazards  like  storms,  tidal  surge,  submergence,  soil 
erosion, unusual siltation, water stagnancy, increase of salinity both in soil and water. These problems 
cause losses of crops, houses, livestock and ultimately human lives. Annual maximum and minimum 
average temperature of coastal districts of Bangladesh are 35-37 °C and 10-13 °C respectively. Most 
of  the  rainfall  occurs  in  the  Aman  season  from  May-September,  with  soil  salinity  increasing  in  the 
November-February  dry  season.  According  to  SRDI,  salinity  of  river  water  is  0.16  to  36 
decisimen/meter, salinity of soil is 2-9 decisimen/meter during the months of December-May and less 
than  2  decisimen/meter  during  the  months  of  June-December.  There  has  been  developed  and 
adoption  of  stress  tolerant  rice  varieties  and  other  crops  (including  HVC  such  as  fruits,  vegetables, 
spices and even HYV rice) leading to higher production and productivity in the coastal areas. 
5. 
Major  Cropping  Patterns.  The  agricultural  activities  of  the  area  are  dominated  by 
transplanted rice (t aman) cultivation in the rainy season in March to April. A  large area  of available 
land is not suitable to agriculture production during the dry season (Oct-May) due high levels of soil 
salinity. Local  varieties of low  yielding submergence tolerant t  aman rice are the most popular. As a 
result,  production  and  productivity  are  very  low.  There  is  potential  to  increase  crop  production  by 
strengthening  research,  develop  and  adopt  stress  tolerant  (saline,  submergence,  drought,  short 
duration crop to  escape stress etc.) crop varieties, along  with the  extension  of improved agricultural 
knowledge and practices. A large number of poor households maintain their livelihoods by capturing 
fish from rivers and Bay of Bengal. 
6. 
The major cropping patterns of coastal area are as follows: 
  Rice (Boro) – Fallow – transplanted rice (t aman); 
  Fallow – Fallow - t aman; 
  Fallow - t aush - t aman; 
  Boro – Fallow - Fallow; 
  Fallow-Mixed Rice (Boroaush, Broadcast aush + Broadcast aman); 
  Relay crops felon/mung bean – relay cropped with grassea/mungbean/chili/wheat or 
sweetpotato/potato/lentil/black gram/maize-aush rice/jute/sesame/t aman 
  Potato/sweet potato/chili/spinach/amaranth/sweet gourd/ladiesfinger/brinjal or 
cabbage/cauliflower/water melon – fallow - t aman 
7. 
in the cropping patterns and some very promising new crop options and rotations are practised: 
Through advances in breeding and technology development there have been changes seen 
  Groundnut-Aush-t aman 
  Mungbean-Aush-t aman 
  Soybean-Aush-t aman 
  Pulses-fallow-t aman 
  Oil seeds-fallow- t aman 
  Winter vegetables-Summer vegetables-t aman 
  Winter vegetables-summer Vegetables-fallow. 
8. 
production systems:  
In  addition  to  the  above,  the  following  developed  and  tested  options  exist  for  these 
  Adoption of saline tolerant high yielding varieties (HYV); 
  Rain water harvesting, linked with production of lower water demanding crops in the 
winter/dry season crops; 
  Cultivation of HVC around homesteads; 
  Adoption of short durational crops in Rabi and Kharif-1 season (e.g. water melon, potato, 
sweet gourd, tomato, chili, onion, pulses, oilseed etc);  
  Adding compost and introducing mulching practices could be useful for optimizing irrigation 
and improve yield;

Introduction of improved irrigation management; 
 
  Plantation of suitable fruit plants like coconut, dwarf coconut, sapota, malta, guava, jujube, 
cawfol, dewya could improve nutrition and increase income; 
  Farmers’ capacity building on cultivation, post-harvest management and value addition of 
high value crops are necessary. 
  Use of suitable integrated pest management (IPM) approaches to reduce pesticide usage  
(e.g. sex pheromone trap in HVC crop production); 
9. 
Specific options exist that are climate-smart and reduce production vulnerability:  
  Adoption of integrating farming in the homestead; 
  Fruits and vegetables cultivation through sorjan method; 
  Vegetables and spices cultivation following bag method; 
  Vegetables and spices cultivation on floating beds in the flood plain area; 
  Construction of small ponds for harvesting rain water;  
  Cultivation of grass pea as relay crop with t aman;  
  Zero tillage crop cultivation as conservation practice; 
Component Description: 
Component 1 
10. 
Justification:  This  component  will  support  the  testing,  evaluation  and  adoption  of  new 
technologies and management practices by smallholder farmers to enhance their production of HVCs 
that  have  identified  market  opportunities.  This  component  will  contribute  to  developing  agricultural 
competitiveness linked to market demands by: (i) assessing the market demand for HVC that can be 
produced in the south, (ii) identifying research demands for evaluation of new cropping systems, new 
crops and/or new varieties and improved post-harvest management storage options, (ii) strengthened 
research-extension and private sector service provision, and (iii) organizing producers and marketing 
groups to form greater scale and bargaining power.  
11. 
Implementation  strategy:  The  component  will  embrace  market-led  research,  with  sub-
Component  1.1  being  implemented  by  trained  and  capacitated  DAM  and  DAE  staff  at  Upazila  and 
Union levels and sub-Component 1.2 being led by BARI and BADC.  Involvement of the private sector 
will  be  cross  cutting  and  they  will  be  involved  in  identification  of  market  opportunities,  support  to 
identification  of  the  quality  and  quantities  required  by  different  markets  and  through  input  provision, 
postharvest management and marketing linkages, as well as processing.   
12. 
Synergy: The first activities in sub-Component 1.1 will determine the types of activities and 
scale of interventions for all other sub-components, as the identified HVCs and their associated VCs, 
will lead to the identification of research, extension, postharvest, processing and water infrastructure 
needs, to build profitable and sustainable farm-level investments.  As this is a new way of operating 
for the implementing GoB departments, they will benefit from significant guidance and support under 
the TA component to support these activities and their integration.  
13. 
The objective of Component 1 will be the identification and prioritisation of appropriate VCs 
for smallholder investment and  associated key research gaps that  need to  be filled through on-farm 
research.  The purpose of the component is to develop the capacities for linking farmers to markets.  
Sub-component 1.1: Assessment of HVCs and group mobilization  
14. 
The starting point for project intervention is the  identification,  assessment and prioritisation 
of HVC value chains. At start-up a detailed value chain analysis of horticultural and other high value 
crops  will  be  conducted  for  final  selection  of  potential  HVCs  suitable  for  production  in  the  southern 
delta  of  Bangladesh.  A  community  process  will  identify  existing  groups  and  target  farmers  who  are 
55

Smallholder Agricultural Competitiveness Project (SACP) 
Final project design report 
Appendix 4:  Detailed project description 
interested  to  invest  in  these  HVCs.  If  new  groups  are  needed,  smallholders  will  be  formed  into 
collaborative Farmer Producer and Marketing (FPM) groups, each with approximately 25 households. 
The  composition  of  the  FPM  groups  will  take  into  consideration  the  planned  focus  on  women  and 
youth and most marginalized groups, reflecting inclusive targeting strategies. In Year  FPMs that have 
developed capacities and market linkages with buyers will be federated to achieve economies of scale 
and integrated into multi-stakeholder platforms.  ,  
15. 
To  reach  the  project  target  groups,  the  following  activities  will  be  implemented:  (i) 
identification  of  existing  groups  at  the  village  and  union  level,  (ii)  a  broad  value  chain  mapping 
assessment, (iii) village-level assessment and prioritisation of potential value chains, (iv) engagement 
of SAAOs as production facilitators, (v) Training of Trainers (ToT) for Agrcultural Extension Officers of 
DAE  along  with  Sub-Assistant  Agriculture  Officers  (SAAOs)  on  Participatory  Rural  Appraisal  (PRA) 
and  group  mobilization;  (vi)  PRA  for  group  formation  and  mobilization  and  (vii)  identification  and 
prioritization of technology and research needs for selected crops. 
16. 
A  broad  value  chain  mapping  assessment  -  Identification  of  value  chain/manageable  sub-
sector inventory considering the market potential impact area of the project and its life time with the 
greatest potential for growth in small enterprise income and employment will be assessed during the 
inception of the project.  
17. 
Village-level  assessment  and  prioritisation  of  potential  value  chains  –  After  broad  base 
selection  of  HVCs,  village  level  prioritization  exercise  will  select  HVC  smallholders  groups.  This  will 
allow each group to produce potential HVC and create an economy of scale of both inputs needs and 
outputs produced by the members of groups which should attract private sector to sell or buy in bulk. 
18. 
Identification  of  existing  groups  at  the  village  and  union  level.  DAE  has  already  mobilized 
farmers groups under different projects, so the first activity is to conduct a mapping of existing groups, 
determine  which  groups  can  be  worked  with  under  SACP  and  what  level  of  capacity  building  and 
support they would need. Where needed SACP will form new groups. All groups will be mobilized by 
the field extension workers using different participatory tools like wealth ranking, social and resource 
mapping, membership profiling, etc. The groups should be inclusive, considering age and gender. For 
both already created and newly formed groups, it will be essential to involve young farmers from the 
early  mobilization  phase.  They  will  serve  as  catalysts  to  further  disseminate  new  technologies  and 
their level of ownership of the potential results will need to be thought through the groups’ formation 
process.  
19. 
Training of Trainers (ToT) for SAAOs on PRA and group mobilization – during mobilization of 
farmers  into  groups,  the  extension  workers  role  would  be  facilitation,  not  as  ‘doers’.  Keeping  these 
principles. The SAAOs will work as Production Facilitators and will be trained on standard tools and 
techniques  of  PRA  to  strengthen  existing  groups  and  to  mobilize  new  ones.  The  training  will  also 
touch  upon  the  challenges  of  climate  change  effects  and  technologies  to  make  communities  (and 
farmers) more resilient to natural disasters and other forms of threats to agriculture livelihoods. 
20. 
PRA  for  groups  formation  and  mobilization  -  this  activity  will  be  conducted  only  for  the 
mobilization  of  new  groups  where  there  are  no  groups  previously  mobilized  by  DAE  or  by  other 
extension agencies. As mentioned above, the early involvement of youth will be essential to create a 
future driving force for new adaptive technologies.   
21. 
Identification  and  prioritization  of  technology  and  research  needs  for  selected  crops  - 
Upazila level consultation  on identification, prioritization and selection of proven technologies  will be 
conducted through workshops with the participation of private sector, extension & research agencies 
and smallholder farmers. A list of such scalable technologies for southern delta proposed by the BARI 
is given below.

Sub-component 1.2: Demand-driven production and market-led research 
22. 
Identification of action research needs will be based on the analysis and prioritisation of the 
VC studies, and the FPM group needs for information new and demanded technologies and on-farm 
mechanization etc. Some key constraints already identified are availability of breeder and foundation 
seeds  of  pulses,  oilseeds  and  other  HVCs,  access  to  inputs,  affordable  mechanisation,  appropriate 
packing  materials,  suitable  processing  or  semi-processing  techniques  and  equipment.  Potential 
activities  under  this  sub-component  are:  (i)  Action  research  on  climate  smart/resilient  technologies 
(e.g. floating agriculture and Sorjon (raised bed) crop cultivation); (ii) evaluation of stress (e.g. saline, 
submergence and drought) tolerant varieties; (iii) evaluation of appropriate mechanization options; (iv) 
Research on on-farm post-harvest storage and agro-processing; (vii) Multiplication of seeds/planting 
material of HVCs.  
23. 
Action research on climate smart technologies – Action research on prioritized technologies 
identified by the extension, research, private sector and smallholders will be conducted by BARI at its 
regional  station  and  farmers.  Standard  protocol  of  action  research  will  be  designed  by  the  HVC 
specialist of both BARI and additional consultants. Once finalized, the manual for each technology will 
be  developed  by  BARI  and  handed  over  to  the  DAE  for  wider  dissemination  to  the  farmers.  The 
market  research  specific  to  the  project  areas  will  be  strengthened  in  BARI  and  local  relevant 
universities.  Services  of  the  consultants  (including  TA)  will  be  utilized  in  development  of  research 
programs.   
24. 
Evaluation  of  stress  (e.g.  saline,  submergence  and  drought)  tolerant  varieties  –  suitable 
HVC varieties already released by the BARI  will be evaluated both at on-farm research field and by 
farmers to assess performance, yield gap, and soil management.  On farm research division of BARI 
will  be  made  involved  in  the  process  of  evaluation.  These  efforts  will  be  oriented  in  the  direction  of 
defying climate change effects. 
25. 
Evaluation  of  appropriate  mechanization  options  -  The  project  will  form  a  Technical 
Committee  for  performance  testing  of  appropriate  machinery  promoted  by  the  importers,  local 
manufacturers/traders through floating an Expression of Interest in newspapers. All machines have to 
be  tested  at  BARI.  Upon  recommendations  by  the  Technical  Committee,  appropriate  machines  and 
respective companies will be enlisted with the project. The selected brands of tested machines will be 
promoted  among  farmers  by  DAE,  with  a  special  focus  on  young  farmers  who  seem  to  be  more 
receptive to new machineries.

26. 
Research on on-farm post-harvest storage and agro-processing - Postharvest management 
(PHM)  is  another  part  of  mechanization  especially  for  HVCs.  Appropriate  small  scale  postharvest 
technology  is  needed  especially  for  HVC  clusters  across  the  southern  delta  for  smallholders  to 
achieve better market outcomes. On-farm research on post-harvest storage and agro-processing will 
be  conducted  for  vegetables,  fruits,  pulses,  oil-crops  especially  on  small  scale  processing 
machineries, through the establishment of common facility center at farmers groups, etc. 
27. 
Multiplication  of  seeds/planting  material  of  HVCs  –  seeds  and  planting  materials  for 
prioritized  HVCs  will  be  multiplied  to  ensure  availability  among  farmers.  BARI  will  produce  breeder 
seed and handed over to the BADC to produce foundation seeds to distribute among farmers. Private 
seed operators will also be linked in the seeds supply system.  
Sub-component 1.3 Institutional support for research and extension 
28. 
Institutional support will be provided to secure the quality of project implementation, such as 
improved  service  facilities  for  both  extension  and  research  in  the  forms  of  necessary  infrastructure 
and  equipment  (also  ensuring  environmental  conservation  and  necessary  climate  resilience 
enhancement), deployment of project staff, and supply of vehicles. Capacity building of professionals, 
technicians and management staff: Training/exposure visits on contemporaneous research for stress 
as well as climate smart agriculture. The following activities will be considered: 
  Formation of implementation team at different levels by placing capable manpower; 
  Development of comprehensive work and budget in line with the log frame of the project; 
  Timely procurement and efficient use of equipment and goods;  
  Develop  and  implementation  and  effective  monitoring  system,  also  able  to  record  and  share 
challenges, identified best practices and lessons learnt; 
  Regular  and  effective  coordination  within  the  implementation  stakeholders  at  different      level 
centre to union; 
  Regular follow-up of monitoring and evaluation activities; 
  Proper capturing of information, documentation and reporting. 
29. 
Component  Exit  Strategy  and  Sustainability:  The  component  is  based  on  capacity 
building  of  existing  and/or  new  FPM  groups  to  identify  market  opportunities  and  identify  the  service 
providers along the value chain who are needed to increase their productivity, profitability and reduce 
their  food  security  risks  from  engaging  more  in  market-led  agriculture.  Increased  capacities  in  DAM 
and  DAE  staff  will  continue  to  be  applied  after  the  project  has  ended,  as  will  the  group  capacities. 
These  initial  skills  will  be  further  supported  and  sustained  through  linkages  with  other  GoB 
departments  and the private sector along the selected VCs.

Final project design report 
Appendix 4:  Detailed project description 
31. 
In Bangladesh, farmers remain heavily invested in rice even though non-rice crops and non-
crop  agriculture  offer  significantly  higher  incomes.  The  diversification  in  agriculture  is  endorsed  by 
both  the  National  Agricultural  Policy  (NAP)  and  the  7FYP  which  promote  the  extension  of  the  crop 
diversification  programme  towards  micronutrient  rich  horticulture,  pulses,  oilseeds  and  cash  crops. 
Along  with  diversification,  success  in  HVCs  is  associated  with  investments  beyond  production  (e.g. 
post-harvest handling,  bulking and storage  and processing of fruits, vegetables  and spices, cereals, 
legumes  and  oilseeds.  The  price  paid  to  the  growers  during  peak  period  is  often  very  low,  with 
perishable crops fruits and vegetables vulnerable to  heavy post-harvest losses, both in quantity and 
quality during transportation and marketing. Estimated post-harvest loss of food grains is reported to 
be about 15  percent and in case of fruits and vegetables, the loss is reported to be 20-25 per cent. 
For highly perishable fruits and vegetables, the loss may go as high as 40 per cent. This is due to lack 
of proper processing, preservation and storage systems in the country.  
32. 
The  Food  and  Agriculture  Organization  (FAO,  201631)  has  projected  that  demand  for  rice 
will  increase  by  5.3  million  MT  between  2015  and  2030,  and  another  3.7  million  MT  between  2030 
and  2050.  The  demand  for  wheat  will  increase  by  0.7  million  MT  between  2015  and  2030,  and 
another  0.5  million  MT  between  2020  and  2030.  Demand  for  maize  will  increase  by  0.5million  MT 
between 2015 and 2030, and a further 0.3million MT by 2030. Demand of potato, pulses, vegetable 
and  fruits  in  2030  will  be  12.3  million  MT,  1.2  million  MT,  7.0  million  MT  and  3.2  million  MT, 
respectively. Corresponding figures of these food items in 2050 will be 13.3 million MT, 1.3 million MT, 
and 7.6 million MT.  
33. 
The  impact  of  this  change  in  demand  is  already  seen  in  production  statistics 32 where 
between  2011  and  2015  the  total  area  devoted  to  rice  cultivation  declined  by  5  percent  from  76.8 
percent to 73.1. Over the same period IFPRI reported that rice yield increased by 11 percent from 2.8 
to  3.1  ton  per  hectare.  The  changes  in  production  (area  and  tonnage)  for  the  high  value  crops  in 
southern  delta  have  also  been  mapped  drawing  upon  the  BBS  annual  reports  for  FY  2004/5,  FY 
2009/10 and FY 2014/1533. The area planted to summer (Kharif) vegetables in the south amounts to 
approximately  20  percent  of  the  national  area,  and  while  it  has  increased  substantially  from  60,000 
acres to over 100,000 acres in the ten years 2005-15, it has accelerated in recent years, increasing by 
26 percent in the first five years but accelerating to 78 percent in the more recent period. This rate of 
change  contrasts  with  the  national  acreage  which  increased  104  percent  in  the  first  five  years  but 
declined to 45 percent by the end of the decade (individual year fluctuations may account for this and 
would warrant further analysis of the figures). 
34. 
Similar analysis of  yield statistics for kharif vegetables indicates substantial  yield increases 
across  Bangladesh  with  87  percent  increase  in  tonnage  over  the  ten  year  period  for  a  45  percent 
increase in land cultivated. However for the south this productivity gain is not so clear with 54 percent 
tonnage increase from 78 percent increase in cropped area (BBS FY 2004/5 – FY2014/15). Changes 
in the cropping mix could explain this apparent discrepancy and more detailed individual District and 
crop analysis is needed. 
35. 
For the Rabi (winter) season vegetable area planted is approx. 75,000  acre more than the 
kharif (529,000 ac 456,000 ac) for the country as a whole. The south plants a lower proportion of the 
national acreage but it has increased from 12 to 14 percent, rising as high as 16 percent over the last 
ten years. The rabi cropped area for Bangladesh has increased by 31 percent as a whole over the ten 
years, but the southern districts have increased the area under rabi crops by 53 percent in the same 
period, but falling back from a 61 percent increase in FY2004/5. Tonnage produced has increased for

33Due to the creation of new administrative Districts by the sub division to historical larger Districts, the original Districts of Barisal, Chittagong, 
Khulna, Noakhali and Patuakhali have been kept for assessing changes over time. More recent single year statistics are presented under the 
modern 14 Districts that have been created by the subdivision of the original 5.

the south these gains have been even higher with a doubling of production in ten years.  
36. 
Postharvest  management  and  processing:  In  southern  region,  farmers  in  production 
clusters of pulses, oilseeds, fruits and vegetables often receive poor prices due to lack of access to 
small  scale  processing  and  handling  technologies.  For  instance,  Patuakhali  is  the  country’s  largest 
mungbean producing district having 65000 ha under cultivation, but there are no pulse mills or storage 
facilities  established  so  that  farmers  can  add  value.  Similar  scenarios  exist  for  peanut  (Galachipa), 
soybean  (Lakhsmipur)  and  mustard  (Barisal  and  Jhalakati).  Some  potential  investors  opined  poor 
infrastructure (communication and electricity), which hinders them to invest. However, they aspire for 
potential  processing  technologies  for  near  future  as  after  construction  of  Padma  bridge 34  such 
investment might be possible. A mapping of these clusters and mechanization solutions is needed and 
should be studied (proposed by Component 1 of SACP).  
37. 
To  address  this  several  approaches  have  been  tried,  e.g.  a  common  facility  center  (CFC) 
which has aa collection point equipped with cleaning, washing, sorting, grading, packing, loading and 
unloading facilities.  The Second Crop Diversification Project (SCDP) of DAE has piloted some ‘On-
Farm  Small  Scale  Infrastructure  (OFSSI)’  with  a  few  of  the  facilities  mentioned  above.  The  SCDP 
mobilized producer groups  through NGOs and these  groups are not capable  of managing a OFSSI. 
On the other hand, mobilizing the private sector to invest in an OFSSI was a challenge for the project.  
38. 
Key development constraints. During field mission it was clear that the coastal area one of 
the most vulnerable areas of the country to climate change and sea level rise. There are a number of 
environmental issues and problems that are hindering the development of the targeted project area. 
Salinity is such an environmental problem which is expected to exacerbate by climate change and sea 
level rise in the future. The identified major development constraints in the visited upazilas are given 
below:

Key  development  opportunities.  With  a  growing  population  in  regional  areas  it  is 
suggested that the focus be on regional markets also in parallel to national and export market.  Some 
identified opportunities are:   
(i)  Differentiate product – with increased middle-class population, agro-processing companies 
are  increasingly  targeting  them  and  processing  agro-based  products  for  which  they  need 
differentiated  products.  They  often  struggle  to  procure  the  right  products  from  the  current 
34The  Padma  Bridge  is  expected  to  unlock  the  potential  and  transform  the  lives  of  nearly  30  million 
Bangladeshis living in the country's Southwest region. By reducing distances to major urban centers like 
Dhaka by almost 100km, the bridge will facilitate regional trade, reduce poverty while accelerating growth 
and development in the country as a whole.

spot-market  based  trading  system.  Through  SACP,  interested  private  agro-processors  as 
well as large wholesale buyers will have cost-effective means to reach the small holders to 
share their needs so that the farmers produce accordingly. 
(ii)  Potential  to  market  collectively.  Formation/mobilization  of  farmer  groups  will  create  the 
room for the farmer members to market jointly if they wish. At the output level, collaborative 
action  will  enable  smallholder  farmers  to  aggregate  a  sufficient  quantity  of  good  quality 
product  to  meet  the  needs  of  downstream  institutional  buyers.  Consolidation  should  also 
enable  smallholder  farmers  to  gain  efficiencies  of  scale  in  transport,  thereby  lowering  the 
cost. In the input market, collaboration should enable smallholder farmers to obtain seeds, 
chemicals  and  fertilisers  at  a  lower  cost.  However,  and  especially  relevant  to  the  SACP, 
collaborative action will provide access to technical support through DAM, DAE, BARI and 
potentially from the private sector through engagement in contract farming if found feasible.   
(iii)  Having  formed  farmer  groups,  smallholder  farmers  can  now  be  trained  in  small  business 
management,  including  marketing,  thereby  enabling  them  to  transact  more  equitably  with 
downstream buyers and input suppliers.  
(iv)  Where it can be shown to be economically viable, with appropriate  training in village-level 
food processing and investment in plant and equipment, smallholder farmers may engage 
in the production of value-added shelf stable food products. 
(v)  The  pro-poor  farmers  can  also  be  engaged  in  some  non-farm  activities  like  establishing 
small  scale  enterprises  for  steeping  preservation/  making  mango  salt  stock  with  green 
mangoes,  boiling  and  drying  of  turmeric,  chilli  drying  etc.  (ICPL,  2016).  The  employment 
potentiality of youth and female poor farmers as employee in the agro-based SME is given 
in  following  matrix.  These  activities  will  include  working  in  postharvest  management  and 
processing  of  agricultural  produces.  The  crop  specific  engagement  of  youth  and  female

Justification  -  increased  growth  in  the  agriculture  sector  is  driven  by  diversification  of 
agriculture production systems away from predominantly rice production, to production of other high 
value  crops,  with  an  associated  intensification  of  production  around  homestead  areas.    However, 
often  small  holders’  increased  production  does  not  result  in  increased  income  due  to  the  mismatch 
between  their  production  and  market  demand  which  is  more  commonly  seen  as  their  “poor  market 
access”. The root cause of such mismatch is actually the asymmetric information leading to inefficient 
market  system  where  buyers  do  not  reach  the  producers  to  educate  them  on  their  needs.  This 
demands  a  new  and  more  flexible  research  and  extension  system,  with  a  pluralistic  provision  of 
extension and  other  input  and  output services to  the  agriculture sector.  This component  will support 
small  holders  to  access  market  in  a  more  efficient  manner  through  creating  a  conducive  business 
environment for private sector to reach them. Value addition will be through processing, storage, and 
transport of agricultural commodities. There is a large domestic market as well as foreign market for 
61

Appendix 4:  Detailed project description 
safer  and  higher  quality  products  and  processed  foods.  Considering  these  potentials  Component  2 
will  promote  agribusiness  activities  through  value  chain  streamlining  of  selected  high  value 
commodities  to  develop  value  chains  and  farmer-market  linkage,  generate  employment  towards 
alleviating poverty, as well as increasing households’ income.  
41. 
Implementation Strategy – This component builds on value chain selection and production 
related  capacity  building  activities  for  farmers  under  Component  1  and  therefore,  develops  farmers’ 
skills on post-production activities to access market in a more efficient and effective way. Under this 
component,  the  project  will  invest  in  reducing  the  market  inefficiency,  especially  in  terms  of 
asymmetric  information.  Through  the  creation  of  the  entry  point  and  platform  (farmer  groups)  under 
Component 1, the private sector will be able to communicate to the producers in a cost-effective way 
about  their  requirements  in  terms  of  quality  and  quantity,  price  conditions  for  different  marketable 
categories,  packing  and  packaging,  delivery  conditions.  This  will  help  reduce  the  perception  of 
additional costs, or risk of negative return from quality and quantity assurance at production level by 
the  buyers.  The  lead  implementer  for  this  component  is  Department  of  Marketing  (DAM)  through 
collaboration with other implementing agencies. Synergy with other components/sub-components 
-   While Component 1 focuses on making farmers more productive in producing high value and high-
demanded  crops  through  accessing  improved  production  knowledge  and  technology,  Component  3 
supports in improving their access to irrigation water. The produced goods need to be marketed in a 
competitive  manner  by  conforming  to  buyers’  requirement  where  Component  2  steps  in  and  builds 
producers’ capacity accordingly. The interventions/activities under this component will be undertaken 
in  parallel  to  those  under  Component  1  and  Component  3  to  ensure  synergy  and  maximization  of 
resources. For example, a buyer may require a specific product to be supplied with certain packaging 
features but may also want the product to be produced using a specific seed variety. While the former 
falls  under  post-production  knowledge  i.e  under  Component  2,  the  latter  has  to  be  addressed  at 
production level i.e. under Component 1. 
42. 
The  objective  of  the  component  will  be  to  enhance  farmers’  knowledge  and  skills  on  post-
harvest  and  processing  techniques,  develop  a  demand-driven  extension  and  research  approach 
within  DAE  and  DAM  and  by  engaging  private  sector,  link  with  private  sector  buyers,  explore  and 
develop  opportunities  for  village-level  food  processing,  and  develop  existing  and  potential  rural 
enterprises’ (including smallholder farmers) ability to manage sustainable agro-enterprises.  
43. 
It  is  worth  mentioning  that  during  the  last  two  decades  one  of  the  significant  transitions  in 
southern agriculture is emerging of different high value product clusters in different pockets from south 
west  to  south  east.  Most  of  these  are  developed  owing  to  the  own  endeavour  of  agribusiness 
entrepreneurs  (agriprenures)  and  climatic  suitability.  These  clusters  have  been  characterized  by  an 
integrated  group  of  enterprises  within  a  specific  geographic  location  that  produces/buy  or  sell  from 
each other in order to produce/supply a particular set of products or services to final consumers (input 
service, financial institutes, producers, broker, processors, packaging, transports, wholesaler, retailer, 
etc. as market actors)35.

Sub-component 2.1:  Improving market linkage 
44. 
This  subcomponent  focuses  on  improving  institutional  capacity  of  DAM  to  enable  them  to 
foster market linkages. Considering the current level of under-staffing, 30 Upazila Marketing Facilitator 
will be engaged through outsourcing in this project under DAM – one in each Upazila. These Upazila 
Marketing Facilitators will be the primary focal points for working with farmer groups on market-access 
and marketing-related aspects, and collaborate closely with AEOs and SAAOs in respective Upazilas 
to transfer jointly post-production and marketing knowledge to farmers.   
45.  Buyer mapping and assessment  - DAM district level staff (three most senior staff) and Upazila 
Marketing  Facilitators  will  be  trained  on  ‘buyers  mapping’  followed  by  assessment  of  buyers.  While 
buyer  mapping  will  identify  existing  buyers  for  selected  crops  at  different  tiers  of  a  value  chain  i.e. 
local  traders,  wholesalers,  institutional  buyers  etc.;  assessment  of  buyers  will  help  select  most 
potential buyers who the project may work together to enhance farmers’ capacity to respond to market 
needs.  Buyer  selection  criteria  will  be  developed  at  PO  level  and  these  criteria  may  include

willingness  to  collaborate,  area  coverage,  procurement  volume,  product  portfolio  dealing  with  etc. 
DAM  will  conduct/update  the  buyer  mapping  cum  assessment  once  in  every  one  year  and  a  half 
through involving district level staff, Upazilla Marketing Facilitators and also the  AEOs and SAAOs in 
the targeted areas to create room for more buyers to join the project who fulfil the selection criteria. In 
the whole project period, the project should select and work with at least 10 institutional buyers and 
100  individuals  for  different  value  chain  crops.  One  buyer  (institutional  or  individual)  may  deal  with 
multiple crops while multiple buyers may be selected for one particular crop in different areas.   
46.  Agreements with buyers - Upon identification and selection of buyers, the project will enter into 
agreements  with  them  delineating  the  roles  and  responsibilities  of  each  party.  While  for  institutional 
buyers it will be formal MoUs at PO level, for individuals it can be informal agreements at local level. 
The major role for the project is to prepare farmers (through both Component 1 and Component 2) to 
comply  with  the  agreed  upon  requirements  of  the  buyers.  Buyers’  major  role  would  be  to  attend 
relevant  training  sessions  for  farmers  arranged  by  the  project  and  educate  them  about  their  needs. 
The  MoUs  and  informal  agreements  should  not  be  a  binding  document  for  a  guaranteed  purchase 
which  may  reduce  the  interest  among  buyers  to  collaborate.  The  rationale  behind  not  having  such 
guaranteed  purchase  clause  are:  a)  through  value  chain  selection  under  Component  1  most 
demanded crops are already selected which are likely to have high unmet market demand; b) through 
interventions  under  Component  1,  the  targeted  farmers  are  expected  to  be  more  productive  which 
means,  they  will  make  higher  profit  even  if  they  sell  in  regular  market;  c)  buyer  mapping  and 
assessment  has  already  identified  the  demand-supply  mismatch  which  are  resolved  through 
supporting the farmers and hence, selected buyers are very likely to buy from them. DAM (national, 
district)  staff  including  their  Upazila  Marketing  facilitators  will  initiate  the  negotiation  with  interested 
private  businesses  (local  traders,  regional  wholesalers,  national  companies,  exporters  etc)  already 
identified, to educate farmers alongside Agricultural Extension Officers and SAAOs on their needs and 
requirements and how to comply with those. In the negotiation, the project will primarily highlight the 
opportunities it will create through investment (such as farmer groups, farmer training on post-harvest 
techniques and business management skills etc) for private businesses to tap and get access to those 
‘better  equipped’  farmers  and  hence,  how  much  the  private  businesses  would  offer  to  join  in  such 
investment – either in kind or cash. There will be formal MoUs signed between DAM and institutional 
buyers  delineating  the  roles  and  responsibilities  of  each  party  while  with  individual  buyers,  informal 
agreements can be made at Upzilla and district level.        
47.  Business management skills development - Every farmer is an entrepreneur and like any other 
business, farming also need operational, marketing and financial management. Lack of knowledge of 
farmers on these aspects often make them inefficient and non-competitive. Linking with buyers will be 
fruitless  unless  the  farmers  manage  their  farming  efficiently  and  in  compliance  with  buyers’ 
requirement.  DAM  district  level  staff  and  Upazila  Marketing  Facilitators  will  be  trained  on  basic 
business  management  skills  along  with  Business  Development  Services  (BDS).  They  will  train  the 
SAAOs who in turn will train farmers in a simplistic way. Once the DAM district level staff and Upazila 
Marketing  Facilitator  become  knowledgeable  on  business  management  skills  and  BDS  (such  as 
finance,  standards,  certificates,  legal  requirements)  provisions  and  respective  providers,  they  can 
assist  not  only  farmers  but  also  rural-agro  enterprises  to  avail  different  BDSs  through  an  informed 
manner. The project will support documentation and printing of business management skills technical 
modules as well as mapping of BDSs provisions required for different agro-enterprises so that these 
resources can be used beyond the project period.     
48. 
Formation of multi-stakeholder platforms – The project will form multi-stakeholder platform in 
each district stationed in the local Chamber of Commerce and Industry office. These multi-stakeholder 
platforms  will  include  Farmer  Groups,  representatives  from  the  local  Chamber  of  Commerce  and 
Industry,  local  government,  DAE  and  DAM,  research  institutions,  agro-input  companies,  agro-
processors, transport and  logistics providers, private  sales agents, financial  institutions, professional 
organisations  of  the  agriculture  sector  and  farmers.  President  of  the  Chamber  of  Commerce  and 
Industry will chair the platform. The role of these multi-stakeholder platforms is to provide a forum for 
the  discussion  of  industry  or  sector  problems  and  constraints  in  a  holistic  manner  thereby  ensuring

that the interests of all stakeholders are represented and protected. District DAM office will primarily 
assist respective Chamber of Commerce to maintain the functioning of the platform. The forum will sit 
together once in every quarter. The project will bear the costs for snacks/food and the Chamber will 
provide venue and logistics support as their investment. Expected Benefits. Through creating a more 
efficient  market  system  where  buyers  share  their  requirements  to  sellers  (producers)  and  how  to 
conform to those requirements, the farmers are likely to have an improved market access resulting in 
increased  income.  The  business  model  promoted  in  this  component  is  different  than  traditional 
approach. Farmers’ poor market access is not directly addressed by project itself but by engaging the 
buyers  between  whom  there  is  a  transactional  relationship.  Learning  from  buyers  will  have  much 
higher impact on farmers to adopt improved post-harvest practices (such as appropriate seed variety, 
grading,  sorting,  cleaning,  packaging,  primary  processing  etc.)  against  learning  from  project  staff 
alone with whom they do not see a transactional relationship. This benefit will continue even beyond 
the  project  period,  as  by  end  of  project  the  buyers  will  see  the  benefit  on  investing  on  farmers  and 
farmers  will  experience  how  conforming  to  buyers’  requirement  yield  in  higher  income.  As  market 
demand changes, new types of requirement may appear in future but as buyers are connected with 
farmers by end of project, they will continue to educate farmers on new trend.   
49. 
Through the capacity building programs embedded in Component 2.1, smallholder farmers 
will  gain  the  necessary  business  management  skills  to  engage  with  downstream  buyers,  improving 
their  negotiation  skills  and  their  ability  to  enter  into  contractual  arrangements  with  a  better 
understanding of both their obligations and those of their exchange partner. Where it can be shown to 
be economically viable, smallholder farmers will have the choice of processing shelf stable products 
for the retail market, rather than to sell a commodity.  
Sub-component 2.2: Post-harvest and processing investments 
2) 
This subcomponent materializes enhanced capacity of DAM and SAAOs; and agreements with 
buyers to connect with producers. The subcomponent also creates the provision to support promotion 
of  agro-processing  enterprises.  The  major  activities  revolve  around  building  producers’  capacity  on 
post-harvest  activities  and  primary  processing  to  respond  to  buyers’  demand;  identifying  and 
supporting potential agro-processing enterprises. 
50. 
Farmer  training  on  post-harvest  and  primary  processing  -  DAM  district-level  staff  and 
Upazila  Marketing  Facilitators  will  be  trained  on  post-harvest  and  primary  processing  of  selected 
crops  as  per  the  need  identified  during  the  buyers’  assessment.  DAM,  thereafter,  will  provide  such 
training  to  SAAOs,  who  in  turn  will  train  the  farmers  with  the  presence  of  buyers  with  whom 
agreements have been signed. Buyers (individual or institutions) must develop a sense of ownership 
on  the  training  activities  and  for  this  reason,  they  should  be  consulted  and  involved  at  each  level  – 
starting from training module  development till providing training to farmers. The selected buyers  are 
expected to contribute financially (may be in kind, by providing time, resource persons, venue etc.) in 
the  training  events  for  farmers  –  for  individual  buyers  cost-sharing  is  expected  to  be  at  least  10% 
while for institutional buyers it is 20%. 
51. 
Promotion  of  agro-processing  enterprises  -  The  project  will  provide  financial  and  technical 
support  to  300  agro-processing  enterprises  (to  the  individual  agripreneurs  or  producer  groups),  on 
average  10  from  each  Upazila,  linked  to  Farmer  Groups.  It  is  envisaged  that  a  particular  Farmer 
Group may or may not propose to start or upgrade an agro-enterprise.  Few members from one group 
or  several  groups  may  join  together.  All  these  options  will  remain  open  to  select  appropriate 
candidates  to  choose  for  project  support.  In  this  regard,  the  project  will  design  matching  grant 
implementation  modalities  for  investments  in  promising  agro-enterprises  in  the  areas  of  storage 
infrastructure,  pack-house,  post-harvest  and  processing  equipment/machinery.  The  matching  grant 
amount will be on average BDT 2 million based on the business proposal merit and the grant amount 
will not exceed 70% of the total investment cost (storage infrastructure and/or machinery) where the 
rest will be borne by the entrepreneur. Investment may include multi-crop cold storage infrastructure,

Appendix 4:  Detailed project description 
mechanical dryers for grains and pulse, mechanical sheller for grains, grinding machines for oil seeds, 
grinding and pellet making machines for animal feeds etc.  
52. 
The  grant  amount  will  vary  depending  on  the  business  type  and  size.  Four  multi-crop  cold 
storage facilities (for perishable items such as vegetables and fruits) in four of the promising districts 
of the project area will be supported, for each of which BDT 10 million would be the matching grant 
amount. On the other hand, a mechanical sheller for grains may require only about BDT 100,000 as 
matching  grant  from  the  project.  Small-scale  processing  facilities  such  as  drying  and  roasting  of 
ground  nuts,  chanachur  (local  snacks),  puffed-rice  making  etc.  which  may  require  less  amount  of 
matching grant shall also be considered for support. It is important to note that the business proposals 
must come from the entrepreneurs (individual or group) - existing (to expand business) or potential to 
start on what they have already experience and knowledge (only exception for nutrition rich fruits and 
vegetables processing training participants under Subcomponent 2.3 who will get the training from the 
project  and  then  can  apply  for  the  grants  to  start  business).  The  project  will  provide  business 
management skills and also assist in accessing BDSs for the selected entrepreneurs after winning the 
matching grant. Whatsoever, the total number of matching grants will be 300 and the total amount will 
be limited to BDT 600 million. In order to ensure that the small holder farmers/entrepreneurs are not 
excluded from this opportunity, at least 200 grants must be received by those  who belong to farmer 
groups  the  project  has  mobilized  including  women  members  who  will  be  trained  to  process 
following  section).  The  overall 
micronutrient  rich 
implementation will include an application process, for which it is envisioned that applicants will need 
to submit a business plan. It can be assumed that all applicants may not have the capacity to develop 
such  a  business  plan  and  DAM  district  level  and  DAE  upazila  level  staff  will  need  to  assist  them. 
Technical capacity of both DAM district staff and DAE Upazila staff will be developed accordingly. The 
final  selection  for  businesses  eligible  to  receive  the  matching  grants  will  be  carried  out  through  an 
evaluation process at PO level, in line with evaluation criteria prepared in consultation with IFAD.

Sub-Component 2.3: Development of food safety and nutrition measures along the value chain 
53.  The objective of this subcomponent is to promote nutrition sensitive value chains and products 
and thereby enhance the consumption of safe and diversified diet for households, women and young 
children. DAE will act as the lead agency through collaboration with Bangladesh Institute of Research 
and Training in Applied Nutrition (BIRTAN), DAM and BARI.  
54.  Food  safety  and  nutrition  training  of  trainers  -Training  manual  on  quality  and  food  safety 
management  systems  will  be  developed  and  selected  resource  persons  of  the  agencies  mentioned 
above  will  be  trained.  These  resources  persons  will  ultimately  roll-out  the  training  of  trainers  at  the 
district, Upazila and community level.  
55.  Training on community based safe food  processing  - Following the ToTs received, SAAOs  will 
provide training to farmer group leaders, women farmer groups and relevant agro-processors selected 
for matching grants on processing of micronutrient rich fruits and vegetables. A special attention shall 
be paid to reach targeted households with disable family members and vulnerable livelihood options. 
The training will strengthen capacities on the use of simple hand operated/mechanised equipment to 
carry out processing and preservation activities (e.g. food products widely consumed in Bangladesh, 
seed  cleaning,  blanching,  drying,  pulping,  juice  extraction,  pickling,  chutney  and  sauce  making, 
bottling,  fermentation,  fruit  toffees,  dehydrated  nutrient  dense  vegetable  mixes,  fruit  based  yoghurt 
production) for value addition, income and nutrition. 
56.  Training on product and nutrient labelling: Selected district and Upazila level officials and related 
food  processors  will  be  provided  ToTs  on  product  labelling  and  relevant  nutrient  information  on 
horticulture  products  (in  Bangla  language)  to  provide  knowledge  on  nutrient  composition  of  foods, 
make  informed  food  choices  and  enhance  household  nutritional  behaviour,  who  in  turn  will  train  the 
farmers.   
57. 
Behavioural  change  campaign:  Every  year  a  2-day  behavioural  change  campaigns  on 
National Food Safety and Agriculture Days will be carried out for enhancing horticulture consumption

for  women  farmers  specifically  resource  poor  women  to  ensure  increased  demand  of  micronutrient 
rich  fruits  and  vegetables  by  improving  shelf  life  of  the  horticulture  produce  and  increasing 
consumption  and  diversity  of  micronutrient  rich  foods  in  the  diet  for  better  nutrition.  DAE,  being  the 
lead  agency,  will engage  DAM to ensure  active participation of large agro-processors (with some of 
whom DAM already signed agreement under subcomponent 2.1) in this campaign. 
58. 
Component  Exit  Strategy  and  Sustainability.  The  subcomponent  attempts  to  address 
inefficiency of the market system where buyers do not invest time and resources to build the capacity 
of small holders to enable the latter to supply their produce in an informed way. With the creation of 
the  platform  (the  farmer  groups)  private  sector  buyers  will  find  it  cost-effective  to  reach  them  in 
sustainable  way  where  DAM  and  DAE  through  increased  capacity  will  assist  the  private  sector  to 
educate them. Once this connection has been developed, private sector is likely to continue the direct 
relationship with small holders to continuously educate them on their needs and requirement. On the 
other  hand,  DAM  with  its  increased  capacity  to  assess  market  and  buyers  will  take  this  knowledge 
forward  to  carry  out  the  same  business  model  in  new  areas  beyond  the  project.  Agro-enterprises 
supported through matching grant will create a demand-pull for more products affecting a production 
growth  of  the  primary  commodities  in  the  project  areas.  Through  promotion  of  nutrition  enriched 
processed agro-products, there  will be higher demand of such products and new similar enterprises 
are likely to join the rally seeing the market opportunity. Multi-stakeholder platform created under this 
component will open a new window to discuss the problems of all the stakeholders in a single forum, 
address  them  through  collective  actions  and  advocate  to  concerned  authority  to  create  more 
conducive business environment.  
59. 
Possible Impacts on Nutrition, Improved Resilience to Climate Change,  Environment 
Impact:  The food processing business will generate nutritious shelf-stable products which will provide 
nutrition  year  round.  This  activities  will  generate  extra  household  income  which  will  contribute  to 
resilience to climate change. In the production process of food processing activities, minor amount of 
odourless  chemicals  can  be  used  which  will  not  pollute  the  environment.  However,  the  waste  water 
removed from the factory will be drained out to a well. Therefore, the activities under component 2 will 
not pose any pollution or any harmful waste disposal problem.

Component 3: Climate Resilient Surface Water Management 
61. 
The  activities  under  component  3  will  support  households  interested  in  increasing  their 
productivity and diversification to HVCs with water infrastructure that will provide supplemental or full 
season water access, through a range of investments in water storage and provision to cropland, with 
associated capacity development for households and groups to manage this water infrastructure.  All 
activities in this Component will be closely associated and enhance initiatives of value addition under 
Component 1 and 2 – the location and scale of interventions will depend on identified and prioritised 
food  production  and  cash  crop  production  activities  and  their  need  for  supplemental  and  full  crop 
season irrigation.

of sweet water resources suited for irrigation work. 
The Source of Irrigation Water:  Bangladesh is a riverine country and blessed with plenty 
63. 
Bangladesh is a delta formed by the great river Ganges, Brahmaputra &Meghna (GBM). The 
big rivers and other rivers carry water from its source namely the Great Himalaya and the rivers meets 
the  Bay  of  Bengal  passing  through  Bangladesh  at  the  tail  end.  The  river  is  a  system  with  many 
tributary  and  sub-tributary  to  carry  water  from  its  source  and  inland  rainfall  to  final  destination  or 
ocean. The portion of Ganges under Bangladesh is called Padma and the portion of Brahmaputra is 
called Jamuna. The river Padma provide surface water at south-west region of Khulna Division mainly 
through Gorai –Modhumoti river system which fall in acute shortage in winter due to the diversion of 
Ganges flow by India to their land.  
64. 
The south-central portion is Barisal division receives water from lower Meghna and flowing 
from north-east to south-west direction flows to Bay of Bengal. The river systems are Hilsa-Sahbajpur-
Tetulia,  Karkhana-Lohalia-Galachipa-Rabnabad,  Rajgonj-Payra-Buriswar,  Kirtonkhola-Sondha-
Bishkhali,  Arialkha-Sugandha-Kocha-Baleswar-Haringhata  rivers  system.  The  south-east  part  is  the 
Chittagong division gets surface water from lower Meghna estuaries as well as from the hilly range of 
the  eastern  Bangladesh.  The  river  Karnaphuli,  Sangu,  Matamuhuri,  Feni  carries  water  from  hilly 
district of Bangladesh as well as of neighboring India. Some area have potential ground water source. 
65. 
Implementation Strategy - Considering the experience and capacity of minor irrigation and 
drainage development, the Bangladesh Agriculture Development Corporation (BADC) is proposed to 
implement activities under component 3. The BADC has a well-organized irrigation division headed by 
Chief  Engineer  (GOB  grade  II  official).  Mostly  engineering  graduates  and  diploma  engineers  are 
engaged in the developmental activities of the division. In the selected districts, Executive Engineers 
(Grade 5), will be overall responsible for the project interventions. Assistant Engineers (Grade 9), sub 
Assistant Engineers (Grade 10) and mechanics/technicians will be responsible for implementation of 
the  activities.  The  activities  under  Component  3.2  (institutional  support/capacity  building)  will  be 
outsourced  through  competitive  bidding  where  applicable.  Some  short  term  consultancy  provisions 
have  been  proposed  for  ensuring  sustainable  water  user  groups  formation  and  community 
participation in O & M in line with the participatory water management rule, environmental aspects in 
water management. 
Sub-component  3.1  -  Sustainable  surface  water  management,  drainage,  conservation  and 
utilization    
66. 
The key activities will involve infrastructure development for surface water conservation and 
utilization  for  irrigation  (high  efficiency  delivery  systems),  addressing  drainage  congestion,  efficient

irrigation  system  management,  rainwater  harvesting,  and  energy  efficient  water  management  etc. 
Selection of sites for specific activities will be based on ecological and environmental situations in the 
project  areas  and  will  be  location  specific.  The  following  are  a  range  of  interventions  and  potential 
scale of interventions that have been identified based on needs prioritized by HVC growers, lessons 
learned  in  other  projects,  knowledge  of  the  area  and  its  production  constraints,  the  focus  on 
production and marketing of HVCs. 
67. 
Crop  Protection  dyke  -  to  protect  crop  land  growing  HVCs  against  tidal  flood  and  heavy 
raining  low  land  and  char  areas  approximately  45  km  of  dykes  will  be  made.    During  exceptional 
adverse condition of flood, people with their livestock will take shelter at dyke.  
68. 
Re-excavation and maintenance of canals- To provide water for irrigation and/or drainage of 
excess water. To be undertaken for both water conservation as rainwater harvesting for irrigation and 
drainage  facility.  This  will  be  implemented  in  the  areas  having  problems  of  drainage  congestion  or 
tidal  flooding  causing  delays  in  crop  establishment  and  or  irrigation  facilities  to  meet  crop  demand. 
Around 316 km of re-excavation will be made in suitable sites in close links with FMP Groups. Canal 
water to be used for household consumption. Dykes will  be  used for sheltering of domestic animals 
during flood, fishing facilities created, navigation facilities improved and duck culture introduced.  
69. 
Thousands  of  canals  flowing  over  the  project  area  make  the  map  crisscross  like  net.  The 
canals  are  used  as  source  of  irrigation  water,  household  use,  fishing,  duck  culture  and  navigation 
purpose.  The  south-west  and  south-central  is  developed  by  Ganges  tidal  flood  plain.    The  south-
central  have  the  underground  water  holding  aquifer  at  a  depth  of  more  than  1000ft.  Which  is  not 
feasible  or  cost  effective  to  extract  for  irrigation  purpose.  Also  experts  ask  to  avoid  ground  water 
extraction; as it may cause salinity problem. But plenty of surface water is there. During 1980’s BADC 
used more than 8000 (Eight thousand) Low Lift Pumps and irrigate most of the cultivable  land.  The 
south-east  also  has  a  lot  of  canals  connecting  the  water  body.  During  monsoon  the  river  and  canal 
carries excess sediment with the flow. When the high tide from south make the flow stable or stagnant 
the  silt  &  clay  deposit  to  form  char.  Year  after  year  deposition  of  sediment  decrease  the  water 
reservoir capacity.  
70. 
For winter irrigation, canals cannot provide sufficient water due to its less storage capacity. 
Also  rain  water  cannot  stored  at  canal  to  drain  out  the  excess  water  from  the  field.  The  farmers 
pointed the priority to re-excavate the canal to ensure the surface water supply at dry period. Some of 
the areas needed canal both for water supply & drainage development.  
71. 
Construction  of  on-farm  water  management  structures  -  The  small-scale  structure  will  be 
built in the water course and canals at farm level as civil works to regulate water. The tidal canals in 
the  project sites divide the homesteads.  The structures  will be constructed for  crossing the canal to 
wider  road  and  easier  transportation  of  agricultural  crop,  goods  and  farm  machines.  Approximately 
291 sites will have provision of such structures. 
72. 
The project area has a lot of water courses towards the field to enter the tide water at high 
tide  &  drain  out  the  water  again  at  low  tide.  The  water  course  or  canal  needs  foot  bridge  or  cattle 
crossing  to  be  used  by  farmers  to  carry  tillage  equipment,  seedlings,  fertilizer,  cattle  &  for  regular 
movement  to  take  care  of  crops.  Some  of  the  village  road  have  pipe  culverts  of  small  &  insufficient 
diameter to drain out the excess irrigation water or excessive rainfall. Some of new depression needs 
pipe  culvert  or  water  pass  to  drain  out  stagnant  water.  The  small-scale  structure  will  be  built  in  the 
water course to connect market to field & homesteads. 
73. 
with other area. To facilitate communication facility some small structure construction is needed. 
The  project  area  under  consideration  lacks  rural  agricultural  infrastructure  in  comparison 
74. 
Community pond excavation with homestead solar  irrigation pump sets  - for  water storage 
for  productive  uses  -  This  will  be  mostly  done  in  the  southwest  part  where  prevalence  of  salinity  is 
more. Efficient irrigation system management for HVC will be implemented at the homestead level. In 
70 
People’s Republic of Bangladesh 
Smallholder Agricultural Competitiveness Project (SACP) 
Final project design report 
Appendix 4:  Detailed project description 
addition, solar energy will be used for domestic purpose and homestead vegetables. Efficient micro-
irrigation like drip irrigation systems to be introduced for increasing irrigation efficiency for HVC. 
75. 
Previously all homesteads have a pond for fish culture and house hold use. But now without 
any re-excavation or renovation of pond or village water body it becomes ditches with store of waste 
water & breeding place of mosquito. The pond and ditches of private & public ownership needed to re-
excavate to store rain water. 
76. 
The solar pump will be installed near the pond to continuous pumping & storing water over 
surface to make gravity flow of water to the plant, fruit trees & vegetables with drip type of irrigation 
using small water control tap.  
77. 
Promotion of solar irrigation pump sets and drip irrigation- to maximise water use efficiency - 
Solar energy  in the remote southern  districts is getting popular for domestic supply. Where feasible, 
solar energy (no operating cost, thus cheaper option for energy saving) along with high efficiency drip 
irrigation system will be installed to support high value crops in the project sites.  Research institutes 
may be involved in technological support and share experiences in installation of these high efficiency 
systems. Around 50 pump sets will be installed in suitable sites. 
78. 
Installation of buried pipe system- for new pump and BADC existing pump (for water lifting 
devise  from  surface  water  sources)  for  irrigation  to  increase  irrigation  water  use  efficiency.  In 
continuation of similar intervention through previous projects and programs the buried pipe system will 
be installed. The activities will be undertaken in newer schemes and in some cases it will be extended 
to  old  schemes  to  further  increase  command  area.  The  system  will  reduce  water  loss  thus  reduce 
irrigation charge to almost half. Buried pipe irrigation system also saves land and water compared to 
conventional  earthen  or  constructed  channel.  A  total  of  about  260  kilometres  of  buried  pipe  will  be 
installed including extension of existing schemes. 
79. 
Conveying  irrigation  water  from  source  to  the  field  with  buried  pipe  is  most  popular  to  the 
farmer.  Buried  pipe  reduces  water  loss  up  to  no  loss  condition  with  no  loss  of  valuable  agricultural 
land as in case of constructed canal or earthen canal and it needs almost no maintenance work. So 
the  system  will  reduce  the  irrigation  cost  almost  half  and  increasing  the  command  area  under  one 
pumping  unit,  the  cost  may  be  reduced  more.  Moreover,  when  a  small  land  is  separated  by  small 
ditch, homestead or orchard it can be connected by buried pipe irrigation system. 
80. 
Provision of hose pipe for irrigation scheme - for conveyance of water to remote locations to 
extend the irrigation command area. Hose pipes will be provisioned for conveyance of water to remote 
locations which will increase irrigation area. It will reduce conveyance loss and conveniently distribute 
water,  where  needed.  Approximately  12,500  meters  of  hose  pipe  will  be  installed  in  the  selected 
project sites. 
81. 
Hose pipe for irrigation is a new idea introduced in the project area. The small and marginal 
farmers appreciate this type of water conveyance system. Due to its most flexibility it can go around 
homestead, trees, ditches or any other obstruction of smaller height. It is easier to carry by farmer to 
field and store the same after irrigation work. 
i)  Artisan  well  installation  -  in  areas  of  the  confined  (pressurized)  aquifer  zone  in  the 
southeast  part.  In  the  south-eastern  part  of  the  proposed  project  sites  artisan  aquifers 
zones are available and piezometric surface is close to the surface. This does not need 
abstraction through pumping. Tapping  water  from such shallow  depth will be affordable 
and easy to use for irrigation. The resources will be utilized to irrigate high value crops of 
commercial importance. Around 100 suitable sites of such artisan well will be installed 
ii)  Dug well: South-western coast of Bangladesh have some saline problem to some extent. 
But the pond water infiltrate from surface water is drinkable and the dug well receive the 
same surface and sub-surface water which can be used for irrigation. 
71

Appendix 4:  Detailed project description 
iii)  Installation  of  rainwater  harvesting  structures  -  considering  acute  shortages  of  fresh 
water  during  dry  season  rainwater  harvesting  will  be  introduced  at  the  household  level 
both for irrigation and drinking water purpose. During the project implementation  around 
3,000 will be installed in the project duration. 
82. 
Key activities of component 3 of the project are mainly efficient use of irrigation technology. 
Thus, it is expected that after project completion irrigation efficiency of the project site increase from 
35% to 42%. 
Sub-component 3.2 - Institutional support for Capacity Building 
83. 
The  interventions  under  this  sub-component  will  address  enhancing  efficiency  in  service 
delivery  of  agency  and  relevant  stakeholders.  This  will  focus  community  ownership  of  the  water 
management  infrastructure  through  (i)  Formation,  mobilization,  training  and  development  of  Water 
User  Groups(WUGs),  following  government  participatory  water  management  guideline,  (ii)  skill 
development of the agency and water users and (iii) developing institutional facilities for better service 
delivery (office, transportation and other logistic support).

The activities proposed are based on the assessment of the existing facilities/ infrastructures 
in the proposed project sites. There are 18 offices of BADC in the proposed project areas where some 
renovations have been proposed. Activities under the sub-component are:   
  Renovation of office/training center in the project sites (ten) for better office accommodation 
and pertaining training to the engineers, technicians, pump operators/managers, water user 
groups (farmers) etc. 
  Overseas  training  for  skill  enhancement  of  relevant  engineers  and  planners  in  efficient 
irrigation and drainage system design and planning 
  Printing and publication of reports, project documentations and training manuals 
85. 
Component Exit Strategy and Sustainability: The proposed project includes formation of 
WUGs  who  will  be  the  primary  beneficiaries  of  this  component.  The  capacity  of  the  groups  will  be 
enhanced through training so that after completion of the project, the groups will have the necessary 
knowledge and skills to be responsible for general O&M of the interventions of the water management 
infrastructures. The project plans to build the capacities of BADC and their engineers, which after this 
initiative will be able to better contribute to the development of the South and potentially cascade their 
knowledge  and  support  other  areas  of  Bangladesh.  In  addition,  the  work  foreseen  between  BADC 
personnel and the WUGs and communities at large will create strong linkages which will support any 
future project of this kind. 
86. 
Synergy  building  with  other  components,  monitoring  and  evaluation  will  be  undertaken 
through TA part in line with the local counterpart staff.  Training under institutional support for capacity 
building will be implemented through technical assistance (TA).

1. 
The  Ministry  of  Agriculture  (MoA)  is  one  of  the  39  ministries  of  the  Government  of  the 
Peoples Republic of Bangladesh. It comprises seven wings with responsibilities of policy formulation, 
planning, monitoring and administration.  The ministry  has sixteen agencies40 which are responsible 
for implementation of different projects and plans of MOA. At present, the ministry has been managing 
131 investment projects and 3 technical assistance projects through these agencies (MOA, FY 2016-
2017). Of these, 8 investment projects and all three technical projects are foreign aided, and  the rest 
are  revenue  projects.  Most  of  these  projects  have  been  implemented  by  the  leadership  of  relevant 
agencies  where  MOA’s  role  is  supervisory.  However,  two  large-scale  projects  have  been  directly 
managed by the MoA, namely Integrated Agricultural Productivity Project (IAPP), FY 2011-2016 and 
National Agricultural Technology  Project-Phase II (NATP-II), FY2016-2021 through forming a Project 
Management/Coordination Unit (PMU/PCU) managed by the Ministry and components by the relevant 
agencies through forming Project Implementation Units. Phase – I of NATP (FY 2008-2014) was also 
directly managed by the MoA through a PCU and different components by the relevant agencies.

Integrated  Agricultural  Productivity Project (IAPP). In June 2010, the Global Agriculture 
and Food Security Programme (GAFSP) granted Bangladesh US$ 50 million to finance an initiative of 
the Ministry of Agriculture, proposed as a project identified under the Country Investment Plan (CIP) 
for  Agriculture,  Food  Security  and  Nutrition.  The  GAFSP-funded  Integrated  Agricultural  Productivity 
Project (IAPP) was consequently developed in 2010-2011 by the Government with the assistance of 
the World Bank and FAO who were selected by the Government to be the supervising entities.

IAPP implementation modality. The Project Management Unit (PMU) is the central operation 
unit headed by a Project Director (deputed from the GoB at the rank of Joint Secretary) who reports to 
the  Secretary,  MoA.  Deputy  Project  Director  of  PMU  deputed  from  GoB,  is  mainly  responsible  for 
coordination with different stakeholders and assists the Project Director. The PMU has also experts in 
Project  Management  and  Coordination,  community 
and 
mobilization, 
governance,  procurement, 
financial  management, 
MIS, ME & IEC, network and database to support the 
Project  Director.  There  are  two  Regional  Project 
Implementation Units (RPIU), one at Rangpur and the 
other  at  Barisal.    The  Community  Mobilization  Units 
are  working  in  8  project  districts.  The  project  has 
recruited  one  Community  Facilitator  in  each  Union  to 
mobilize  smallholders  into  farmers  groups  and  one 
Field  Assistant  per  Upazila  for  livestock  part  and  one 
Field Assistant for Fisheries part, comprising 472 field

Comparative Strength of relevant agencies of MoA. Among the 16 agencies of MoA, the 
Department  of  Agricultural  Extension  (DAE),  Bangladesh  Agricultural  Development  Corporation 
(BADC), Department of Marketing (DAM) and Bangladesh Agricultural Research  Institute (BARI) are 
relevant  agencies  for  proposed  the  SACP.  Although  relevant  as  positive  agents  for  the  proposed 
project,  however,  capacity  of  each  agency  varies  in  relation  with  their  mandate,  administrative 
boundaries,  geographical  coverage  and  manpower  at  grass  roots  level.  Following  matrix  shows  a 
comparative analysis of these four agencies to assess their capacity towards implementing a project 
in southern region: 
8. 
Harmony among four agencies. The DAE as a lead agency along with BADC, DAM, and 
three  research  agencies  (BARI,  BRRI,  SRDI)  has  been  implementing  Government  funded  Pirojpur-
Gopalganj-Bagerhat Integrated Agricultural Development Project (PGB-IADP) with a budget of US$28 
million  which  started  from  March  2015.  The  DAE-DAM-BADC  has  been  jointly  implementing 
Enhancing  Cropping  Intensity  in  Greater  Sylhet  Region  (FY  2015-2019)  with  a  revenue  budget  of 
US$9.5  million  where  DAE  is  lead.  While  BADC  as  a  lead  agency  along  with  DAE,  DAM  and  two 
research  agencies  (BARI,  BRRI)  has  been  implementing  another  US$28  million  project  name 
Mujibnagar Integrated Agriculture Development (MIADP). The NATP-II has just started in September 
2016  where  BARC  and  DAE  will  work  together  along  with  other  agencies.  These  examples  of 
successful implementation suggest that cooperation between agencies of the MoA is achievable.  
9. 
Lessons  Learned  from  Past  and  Ongoing  Projects.  The  above  two  projects  led  by  the 
Ministry  of  Agriculture  (MoA)  have  been  reviewed  regarding  implementation  modalities,  key 
achievements  and  operational  complexities.  The  IAPP  is  on  the  verge  of  closing  (December  2016) 
and  NATP  I  was  closed  in  2014.  Following  are  few  feedback  revealed  from  different  documents 
including World Bank mission and project completion reports: 
10. 
As  a  follow  up  of  the  NATP  I,  The  NATP  II  takes  into  account  some  of  the  shortcomings 
identified under NATP and reflects the integrated approach required to achieve the PDO. The earlier 
NATP  design  featured  thematic  components  (i.e.,  research,  extension,  supply  chain),  which  often 
resulted  in  a  fragmented,  less  well  coordinated  approach  to  improve  the  agricultural  technology 
system. NATP implementation support missions have also reported the need to further strengthen the 
linkages between technology generation, transfer and adoption.  
11. 
At  IAPP,  an  informal  structure  of  inter-departmental  coordination  and  harmony  developed, 
but  lack  of  a  common  extension  approach  (among  DAE,  DLS  and  DoF)  –  and  the  reliance  on 
specifically-hired project staff as CF, CEAL and LEAF - meant that ownership did not build up properly 
amongst the organizations at field level.   
12. 
Both  NATP  I  and  IAPP  largely  focused  on  productivity  enhancement,  but  with  increased 
productivity smallholders often faced challenges in marketing. The lack of focus on commercialization 
and strengthening linkages between smallholders and markets means that ‘productivity projects’ may 
not  deliver  fully  on  expected  results.  Future  projects  should  take  care  of  this  emerging  issue  of 
marketing and commercialization.    
13. 
A uniform extension approach for mobilizing smallholders into groups is another issue to be 
considered. With regard to commercialization and market access, strong producer organizations can 
help modify transaction conditions, such as price and quantity, and can exert influence over the value

chain  for  a  specific  commodity.  Although  extension  agencies  practice  group-based  extension 
approaches, farmers groups are often simply a means to deliver project activities and inputs. The key 
principles  for  the  development  of  strong  organizations  are  not  applied  consistently.  These  key 
principles  are:  autonomy,  inclusive  leadership,  strong  bonding  among  members,  business  service 
provision  and  a  clear  owned  purpose.  Considering  these  key  principles,  producers  organizations 
should be mobilized for which a uniform extension manual for all agencies is necessary.  
14. 
M&E  is  one  of  the  key  areas  in  investment  projects  that  should  be  rigorously  considered 
during  project  design  phase.  At  IAPP,  M&E  system  functioning  from  year  3  due  to    delay  in  expert 
recruitment and lack of proper attention towards a robust M&E system. Once it was in place however 
it gave excellent results, as noted at the IAPP Results Learning Workshop (Cox’s Bazaar, September 
2016).   
B.   DAE and its service network 
15. 
Department  of  Agricultural  Extension  (DAE)  works  throughout  the  country  with  a  wide 
organizational setup. This organization headed by one Director General. It has  8 wings leaded by  8 
directors.  Field  offices  are  as  follows:  Regional  offices-  14,  District  Offices-  64,  Horticulture  centers- 
73,  Quarantine  center-30,  Metropolitan  Agriculture  Offices  15,  Upazila  Agriculture  Office  -  479,  and 
Agriculture Training Institutes (ATI) - 16. Other than these there are14092 agriculture Blocks covering 
the  whole  country.  Every  block  is  leaded  by  one  Sub  Assistant  Agriculture  Officer  (SAAO).  Overall, 
DAE has 685 formal offices set up throughout the country.  
16. 
The  southern  region  comprises  of  3  Additional  Directors  offices,  14  district  offices,  107 
upazila  agriculture  offices,  3185  blocks,4  agriculture  training  Institutes  and  3  horticulture  centers.  
About 570 officers and 3185 SAAOs are working under DAE in the districts of the south (as defined by 
the Southern Masterplan). 
17. 
are highly relevant to the SACP implementation: 
The DAE  has a  number of technical  wings, and the following  are some selected ones that 
18. 
Horticulture Wing deals with the horticultural crops. It includes fruits, vegetables and flowers. 
Under  this  wing  there  are  73  horticulture  centres  and  nurseries  throughout  the  country.  Horticulture 
wing  prepare  the  plans  for  increasing  the  production  of  horticultural  crops.  Through  the  horticulture 
centers  and  the  nurseries  this  wing  provides  good  quality  planting  materials  to  farmers.  In  every 
horticulture  center  the  mother  plants  of  the  fruit  crops  are  maintained  to  produce  quality  planting 
materials.  This  wing  maintains  all  the  horticultural  crop  production  data  for  the  years.  Among  these 
horticulture centres, four located in the southern region. 
19. 
Crops  Wing  deals  with  the  development  of  crops  like  cereal,  pulse,  oils,  jute,  sugarcane, 
tobacco,  betel  leaf,  bamboo  etc.  This  wing  acts  as  a  key-link  between  Department  of  Agricultural 
Extension (DAE) and respective crop research institutions, which deal with these crops. Crops Wing 
practically  deals  with  production  and  increase  income  generation  of  farmers,  plans  for  field  crop 
oriented training to make available update production technologies for its’ stakeholders. This wing also 
contributes  to  formulate  Government  policies  related  to  different  crops  activities,  like  production, 
utilization,  marketing  and  distribution.  It  also  provides  technical  advice  to  the  Government  through 
Director  General  on  tariffs  and  other  policy  issues,  such  as  production,  utilization,  marketing  and 
distribution of crops. This wing oversees the conversion of up to date crops technology into extension 
messages  and  appropriate  staff  training  modules.  It  also  oversees  the  development  of  model 
programs available for use in the field for income generation.   
20. 
Plant  Protection Wing.  Director,  Plant  Protection Wing  responsible  for  this  wing.  Designing 
an  annual  work  planned  to  the  cultivated  areas  for  keeping  safe  from  disease  and  pest  infestation. 
Plant  protection  wing  of  DAE  provides  surveillance  and  forecasting  for  field  crops  as  required  quick

execution of Master Training Plans for skill development of DAE Officials, field level extension workers 
as  well  as  farmers.  Under  the  training  wing  16  Agriculture  Training  Institute  (ATI)  are  graduating 
Diploma  Agriculturists.  Every  year  these  institutes  enroll  2980  students.  The  graduates  coming  out 
from this institution work at the grass root level as SAAO in the DAE. They also work in the research 
intuitions, NGOs, INGOs and schools as teacher. There academic administration is under the control 
of the Bangladesh Technical Education Board (BTEB). 
22. 
Agricultural  extension  service  assists  farmers  to  make  efficient  productive  and  sustainable 
use of their  land  and other resources.   It  is an educational process by  which information /  advice is 
generated,  shared  and  used  for  decision  making  for  farm  /  farm  household  livelihood  development.  
The  Agricultural  Support  Services  Project  (ASSP)  and  Agricultural  Services  Innovation  and  Reform 
Project (ASIRP) funded by the Government of Bangladesh (GoB), World Bank and UK Department for 
International  Development  have  supported  the  strengthening  of  extension  services  in  Bangladesh 
since 1992.  
Extension  Service  Providers 
23. 
in 
Bangladesh  comprises  a  multitude  of  governmental,  nongovernmental  and  private  sector  agencies.  
All  these  Extension  Service  Providers  (ESP)  are  in  the  business  of  providing  agricultural  advice  to 
farmers:  
in  Bangladesh.  The  agricultural  extension  system 
  Government  Organizations  (GOs),  traditionally  providing  services  to  male  farmers  operating 
larger  farm  holdings,  and  historically  using  a  one-to-one  basis  for  providing  advice.    The 
largest  GO  ESP  is  the  Department  of  Agricultural  Extension  (DAE),  which  has  15000  field 
level  Block  Supervisors  Traditionally,  DAE  concentrate  on  providing  crop  advice  to 
small/medium  farmers  (who  operate  60%  of  land,  but  only  represent  22%  of  farmers).  
Separate GO agencies deal with advice on livestock (the Department of Livestock Services), 
fisheries (the Department of Fisheries) or tree crops (the Forest Department). 
  Non-Government Organizations (NGOs), traditionally providing advice to farmer groups allied 
to the provision of micro-credit for income generation, favoring to target their services towards 
women and smaller farm operators.  
  Private  sector  organizations,  which  are  a  more  recent  addition  to  the  extension  system, 
largely  comprising  seed,  irrigation  and  fertilizer  dealers  (which  expanded  as  a  result  of 
deregulation in the 1990s).  Information is usually provided to farmers at the point of sale.  
  Farmers,  who  continue  to  generate  and  share  information  amongst  themselves  with  little 
outside  involvement.    Historically,  farmers  have  always  obtained  most  of  their  agricultural 
information  from  other  farmers.    Although  farmers  are  informal  information  sources,  many 
ESPs have sought to strengthen farmer to farmer extension through the use of farmer groups, 
para-professionals etc.  Importantly, the original source of information transferred by farmers 
may have been research or extension service providers.  
  Mass  media,  which  although  not  a  separate  service  (the  source  of  the  message  came 
originally from government, non-government or private sector agencies), acts as a significant 
source  of  information  to  farmers,  independent  of  direct  contact  with  an  ESP.  The  range  of 
extension  service  providers  has  increased  in  recent  years  there  is  now  a  high  degree  of 
pluralism, and quality is highly variable.

Agricultural Extension Service Delivery. Measuring the performance of an Extension Service 
Provider  (ESP)  is  notoriously  complex.    Theoretically,  a  farmer  will  receive  and  assess  information, 
may  or  may  not  take  action  as  a  result,  and  (should  action  have  been  taken)  realize  some  benefit.  
This  benefit  is  often  multifarious,  and  might  comprise  changes  in  the  use  of  agricultural  inputs; 
changes in labor use or time allocation; changes in farm productivity (yields or outputs) or adjustment 
in any sphere of the farm household livelihood.  Measuring such changes is hard enough; attributing 
them  back  to  the  provision  of  agricultural  advice  is  almost  impossible  as  so  many  other  factors 
contribute  to  livelihood  changes.    One  basic  (imperfect)  approach  to  service  provider  performance 
assessment is shown in Box.  Farmers become aware of a source of extension advice (an ESP) and 
gain  contact  with  that  source.    Advice  is  provided  to  the  farmer,  who  understands  a  new  idea  and 
decides  to  try  it  on  his  or  her  farm.    Practicing  this  idea  produces  a  good  result  (in  the  farmers’ 
opinion), and the farmer decides to use the advice again. There are many caveats to this performance 
model not least the fact that farmers very rarely fully adopt 100% of advice provided they frequently 
adapt ideas to their own needs and circumstances.

Models  of  Extension  Service  under  DAE.  For  many  years,  DAE  delivered  its  services 
through  the  Training  and  Visit  (T&V)  system.  But  this  system  has  not  been  sustained.  There  were 
found  to  be  some  significant  weaknesses  of  this  system,  and  a  new  coordinated  system  has  been 
introduced  through  a  project  named  Agricultural  Services  Innovation  and  Reform  Projects  (ASIRP). 
Under this project an integrated system was developed focusing the Extension and Research linkage.  
26. 
DAE strengths and weaknesses can be summarized as follows regarding HVC: 
Strength: 
a)  Qualified man power throughout the country up to block level. 
b)  Well organized Government organization 
c)  The Mission and Vision statement of DAE is in favor of High Value crop production 
d) 
It also covers the priority of Ministry of Agriculture 
e)  The DAE has got well ahead project implementation capacity and experience 
f)  Working experience with diversified farmers group 
g)  DAE has a separate horticulture wing 
h) There are 73 horticulture centers throughout the country 
Weakness:

Final project design report 
Appendix 5: 
Institutional aspects and implementation arrangements  
a)  Lack of knowledge on HVC and understanding of market oriented agricultural practices. 
b)  Top down planning still focused on production aspects rather than economic return or value 
chain 
c)  Lack of location specific production planning considering potentiality of HVC production 
d)  Value chain analysis is only project based 
e) 
Irrigation facilities not been designed in favor of horticultural crop production 
f)  Lack in Post-harvest management facilities and skills 
g)  Effective and vibrant Research-Extension linkage is not in place. 
27. 
Government  has  taken  a  strategic  decision  to  develop  the  southern  region  as  a  potential 
crop  production  zone  through  an  integrated  initiative  including  research,  technology  transfer, 
infrastructure development, commercialization of agriculture and high value crop production.  
28. 
Department  of  Agricultural  Extension  (DAE)  has  the  potential  to  implement  any  initiative 
concerned  with  its  mandate.  The  office  set  up  and  trained  manpower  of  DAE  is  capable  to  work  in 
grass root level in collaboration with all other  actors working in the field of agricultural development. 
Keeping  pace  with  present  need,  DAE  has  already  embraced  the  concept  of  high  value  crop 
production  throughout  the  country.  However,  the  existing  manpower  will  need  to  be  trained  up  on 
value chain, market linkage and location specific high value crop production and planning.  
C. 
Department of Agricultural Marketing (DAM) 
29. 
Presently,  DAM  has  offices  set-up  in  all  11  project  districts.  The  agency  is  mandated  to 
develop  agribusiness  through  improving  linkages  between  farmers  and  markets.  Consultation  with 
government  counterparts  highlighted  the  following  requirements  for  the  department,  with  particular 
focus  on  post-harvest  facility,  office  capacity  and  market  linkage.  DAM  has  been  operating  from  the 
rented  accommodation  without  its  own  office  premises.  Having  own  office  premises,  ideally  in  close 
association with DAE, and with the necessary logistics and ICT facilities would significantly enhance 
the capacity of DAM.

Bangladesh  Agricultural  Development  Corporation (BADC)  the  successor  of  the  East 
Pakistan  Agricultural  Development  Corporation,  established  under  the  Agricultural  Development 
Corporation  Ordinance,  1961  (E.P.  Ordinance  XXXVII  of  1961).  The  corporation  has  completed 55 
years of  its  establishment  on  16  October,  2016.  BADC,  an  autonomous  corporate  body  under  the 
Ministry of Agriculture, serves to the whole of Bangladesh and has a nationwide network of outlying 
field  offices  down  to  the  upazila  level  and  at  some  places  even  below  that  level.  In  2009  the 
corporation is made more vibrant and is given some more responsibilities such as providing irrigation 
facilities  to  the  farmer  through  surface  water  utilization,  import  of  non-urea  fertilizer  through  G2G 
arrangement  and  strengthening  of  seed  production  activities  with  the  task  of  multiplication  of  high 
yielding  and  different  stress  tolerant  varieties  of  seeds  allocating  financial  support  through  new 
projects and programmes. 
32. 
Minor Irrigation Wing. BADC started its irrigation activity only through operation of 1555 Low 
Lift  Pumps  (LLP)  in  the  FY  1961-62.  In  the  FY  1967-68,  BADC  began  to  install  Deep  Tube  Wells 
(DTW)  and  from  the  FY  1972-73,  it  had  started  to  supply  Shallow  Tube  Wells  (STW)  in  order  to 
increase  irrigated  areas  as  well  as  to  increase  crop  production. At  present,  there  are  171041  LLPs, 
36034  DTWs,  1563791  STWs  and  BADC  is  also  using  some  manual  &  traditional  devices  to  cover 
54.02  lakh  hectares  of  land  for  irrigation  in  Boro  season  all  over  the  country  (BADC  Survey  & 
Monitoring  Report,  2014-15).  BADC  is  constructing  Rubber  Dams  to  reserve  surface  water  and 
irrigating through gravity flow. 4 Rubber Dams have already been constructed and other 2 are under 
construction. So far, 11 Solar irrigation pumps in different districts have already been set up. Besides 
these,  BADC  has  made  irrigation  system  acceptable  to  the  farmers  through  water  management, 
operation and maintenance of irrigation equipment, smooth and optimum use of water at field level. At 
Present,  BADC  is  implementing  a  numbers  of  Project  &  Program  for  the  development  of  Minor 
Irrigation System. 
33. 
The present strategies of Minor Irrigation Wing: 
a)  To increase irrigated areas from about 54 lakh hectare to 60 lakh hectare within 2021 (about 
one lakh hectare per year); 
b)  To give emphasis on use of surface water for irrigation by expanding the availability of surface 
water through excavation/ reexcavation of khal/nalas; 
c)  To prevent groundwater depletion through optimum use of groundwater; 
d)  To increase irrigation efficiency from 34% to 48%; 
e)  To minimize yield gap from 3 ton/ha. to 1 ton/ha. by 2021; and 
f)  To increase cropping intensity. 
34. 
The main activities and functions in Minor Irrigation Wing: 
a)  Excavation/  re-excavation  of  khal/nalas  to  preserve  surface  water  and  also  for  drainage 
purpose; 
b)  Construction  of  different  types  of  hydraulic/retaining  structures  for  augmentation  of  surface 
water and rain water harvesting; 
c) 
Installation of different capacity Low Lift Pumps and Force Mode Pumps of diesel and electric 
operation. Force Mode Pumps are also installed where groundwater is below the suction limit 
of centrifugal pump; 
d)  Construction of surface and sub-surface (buried pipe line) irrigation channel to minimize water 
loss; 
e)  Construction of Rubber Dams in small river, creeks etc.; 
f)  Rehabilitation, repair, maintenance of old Deep Tube Wells;

E.   Bangladesh Agriculture Research Institute (BARI) 
35. 
BARI  is  the  largest  research  institute  in  the  country  conducting  research  on  more 
than  100  crops  including  HVC  (excluding  commodities  such  as  rice,  sugar  crops,  jute  and 
tea) and having more than 700 scientific professionals. Over the years BARI has developed 
440  crop  varieties  and  452  other  technologies.  It  has  updated  its  research  capacity  in 
developing  laboratories  for  analytical  services,  through  a  series  of  projects  funded  by  GoB 
and  development  partners.  The  On-Farm  Research  Division  (OFRD)  of  BARI  is  located  in 
major agro-ecological zones to bridge with farmers having multiple farming through improved 
technologies. Three regional stations of BARI will be involved in the project namely: 
a)  Regional Research Station, Jessore 
b)  Regional Research Station,Chittagong (Hathajari)and   
c)  Regional Research Station, Barisal (Rahmatpur)

b)  Patuakhali(Lebukhali), regional horticulture sub-center  
c)  Chittagong (Pahartoli) 
d)  Khulna-OFRD 
e)  Noakhali-OFRD  
Support from two  more  research  stations  of  southern  belt,  OFRD,  Gopalganj  and 
Regional Pulse Research Station, Madaripur will also be required to facilitate research 
activities. 
F.   Field staffing and workload 
37. 
DAE. In the SACP project area (11 districts comprising 30 upazilas), the DAE network has 
66 technical positions approved for the district level and only 29 are in place (44%), 180 approved for 
upazila level and 82 in place (46%), and 857 approved for union level and 577 in place (67%). While 
DAE’s  technical  officers  in  those  three  levels  are  very  experienced  and  dedicated  staff,  insufficient 
workforce remains an issue for assuming further implementation responsibilities for SACP. SAAOs at 
upazila  and  union  levels  will  be  the  most  responsive  operational  capacity  of  DAE  for  SACP 
implementation. Currently each SAAO is in charge of 3-4 farmer groups in average and the increase 
of additional 2-4 groups  was not perceived  as overloaded by  SAAOs extensively  interviewed during 
the detailed and final design missions respectively in March and August 2017.

BADC  operates  in  two  levels  in  the  project  areas,  with  at  district  level  190  positions 
approved and 107 in place (56%), and at upazila level 119 approved and 84 in place (71%). Similarly 
to  DAE’s,  BADC  technical  staff  are  highly  professional,  experienced  and  dedicated.  BADC’s 
involvement  in  component  3  especially  in  the  area  of  surface  water  management,  would  not  pose 
critical operational issue for the implementation. 
39. 
DAM is the least deployed department and its physical office hasn’t completed yet in all the 
project districts. DAM has no upazila presence so far and some required but some far limited work at 
upazila level has been outsourced to the technical service providers. DAM has 96 approved technical 
positions in the 11 districts and only 42 in place (44%). 120 upazila technical positions were approved 
but none has entered into duty. The mission was informed that the proposed Upazila set-up already 
been  approved  by  The  Ministry  of  Public  Administration  (MOPA)  subject  to  condition  that  it  will  be 
implemented depending on finalizing recruitment rule within the next 5 years.

A  Project  Implementation  Committee  (PIC)  will be formed to provide technical guidance 
and  bring  in  synergy  with  stakeholders  and  partners  other  than  the  MoA.  The  committee  will  be 
chaired  by  the  Additional  Secretary  (PPC)  and  it  will  be  composed  of  Project  Director,  Component 
Directors and Project Coordinator of BARI, one PO from the IFAD-assisted projects in the Ministry of 
Agriculture, representatives of the MOA, Planning Commission, ERD, IMED, selected leading private 
firms and trade associations, and IFAD and FAO country offices. The PIC will play the role of technical 
exchange platform and synergy building among different development projects, where good practices 
and lessons learnt can be drawn to support the SACP implementation at operational level, and shared 
for cross-benefits. 
47. 
The project structure of operational management and coordination will be established along 
the DAE vertical structure from central to the Union, with DAE, DAM, BADC, and BARI participation at 
applicable  levels  where  available,  and  managerial  and  technical  officers  appointed  from  respective 
agencies. The project will fund Operational Support Teams (OST) at both central and district levels to 
support  the  Project  Office  and  District  Coordination  Units  (DCUs).  DAE  SAAOs  and  Marketing 
facilitators engaged by DAM will be the key contacts in reaching the farmer groups, with help of lead 
farmers selected among farmer groups. 
48. 
At  central  level,  the  Project  Office  proposed  for  SACP  will  pay  special  attention  to  the 
leading functions of DAE and coordination among implementing agencies. Component Directors from 
principal  implementing  agencies  namely  DAE,  DAM  and  BADC,  and  Project  Coordinator  from  BARI 
will be supported by an operational support team of externally recruited experts whose positions are 
funded by the Project.

-  DAE for component 1, 
-  DAM for component 2, 
-  BADC for component 3, and 
-  BARI will support the three implementing agencies with researches linked to areas of interventions 
identified under the three technical components. 
59. 
Options will be explored to link the  benefit M&E system with the project management M&E 
system  (which  will  be  in  line  with  IFAD’s  revised  results  and  impact  management  system  (RIMS)). 
Such linkage will avoid duplication of data collection and improve the possibility of attribution of results 
to project activities.

Country Programme Support Unit (CPS unit). In the perspective of a country Programme 
Support  unit  (CPS)  aiming  at  improved  cost  efficiency  for  the  Country  Programme  management, 
capacity building is foreseen and detailed programming will be led by the ERD. The SACP will actively 
participate in this in-country initiative. 
61. 
In addition, the operational modalities under the project management component, SACP will 
participate in investing in the establishment of a Country Programme Support  unit (CPS unit) for the 
overall  Country  Programme  in  Bangladesh.  The  potential  tasks  are  the  following:  facilitate  cross-
learning  with  other  on-going  IFAD  project  implementing  similar  activities  to  accelerate  start-up; 
support  knowledge  generation  and  sharing  across  IFAD  financed  projects  including  annual  KM 
events; support on-going IFAD financed project in preparation of project completion, MTR and design; 
support  weak  performing  project  through  staff-sharing  and  technical  assistance  in  respective  areas. 
The staffing of the CPS unit is to be finalized with ERD and MoA, as its reporting line. 
62. 
This Joint Technical Assistance Delivery Mechanism aims at providing Project Management 
Units with demand-driven support services in areas of common interest, with a view to improve project 
performance  and  strengthen  coherence  and  coordination  between  the  projects.  It  has  four  specific 
objectives:  
-  Harmonising  approaches  and  procedures  across  projects  and  ensuring  their  alignment  on 
national and IFAD procedures; 
-  Sharing  knowledge  generated  by  the  projects,  between  the  projects,  with  Implementing 
Agents and other IFAD partners nationally and internationally; 
-  Strengthening the capacities of project teams in areas of common interest; and 
-  Making economies of scale by pooling resources to the benefit of a group of projects. 
63. 
The  CPSU  will  provide  technical  support  services  in  three  key  areas:  M&E,  Knowledge 
Management  and  Communication,  and  Financial  Management.  However,  the  design  of  this 
mechanism is flexible enough to respond to project needs in other technical areas as they arise and 
jointly identified by IFAD financed projects. 
64. 
The  discussion  on  the  modalities  and  responsibilities  of  the  PSU  will  be  further  reviewed 
jointly  by  IFAD,  ERD, MoA and other involved ministries and  agencies  in  a bid to ensure ownership 
and sustainability.  
65. 
Support  to  new  project  design  and  start-up.  The  future  CPSU  team  will  also  assist  new 
Project  Directors  and  staff  in:  (i)  setting  up  their  M&E/KM  system,  including  SIMES;  (ii)  organising

Appendix 6: 
Planning, M&E and learning and knowledge management 
1. 
Planning,  M&E,  learning  and  knowledge  management.  Results-based  management 
approach  will  ensure  that  all  processes  and  activities  of  the  project  are  in  line  with  the 
project  goal,  objectives  and  expected  outcomes.  As  part  of  this  approach,  the  integrated 
monitoring  and  evaluation  (M&E)  and  knowledge  management  (KM)  system  will  be 
developed  in  accordance  with  IFAD  guidelines  and  government  frameworks.  Planning, 
monitoring and evaluation will be results-oriented to enable tracking of progress towards the 
project outputs, outcomes and sustainability. 
2. 
Planning. The SACP will apply a results-based management approach which establishes a 
solid  linkage  between  planning  (including  resource  allocation),  implementation,  monitoring  and 
evaluation.  This  approach  will  ensure  all  processes  and  activities  of  the  project  are  in  line  with  the 
project goal, objectives and expected results.  
3. 
The  project  will  be  implemented  in  11  districts  covering  30  upazilas  with  activities 
implemented  by  the  Lead  Agency  with  the  existing  management  and  coordination  structure  at  DAE 
central  level  and  Coordination  Unit  (CU)  at  district  level.  In  addition,  activities  will  be  directed  at 
multiple  stakeholders,  including  landless,  marginal,  small  farmers  as  well  as  other  actors  along  the 
value  chain.  As  the  project  will  involve  with  several  implementing  partners  including  DAE,  DAM, 
BADC, and BARI, this complexity affects project management and must be dealt with in an effective 
way to reduce bureaucracy and unduly lengthy planning and reporting processes. 
4. 
 Annual Work Plan and Budget. The project AWPB will be a basis for implementation and 
should  clearly  describe  the  strategic  direction  of  the  project  for  the  coming  years  by  resenting  a 
budget  estimate,  the  expected  results  under  each  component  and  how  these  results  would  be 
achieved with risk analysis if any. The preparation of AWPBs will be jointly conducted by the project 
management  in  consultation  with  local  implementing  partners  and  beneficiaries  where  relevant.  A 
participatory  annual  planning  process  with  stakeholders  will  be  set  up  to  ensure  the  bottom-up 
feedback on community needs, priorities, contextual opportunities and limitation.   
5. 
In preparing the first AWPB, the Project Management should be aware of available budget 
and the amount of Initial Deposit released in order to prioritize critical investments identified. It would 
be  necessary  to  anticipate  the  following  project  fiscal  year’s  budget  to  avoid  shortage  of  funds 
available  for  the  succeeding  year.  Counterpart  matching  funds  should  be  secured  and  accounted  in 
the AWPB. 
6. 
In preparing the AWPB, narrative presentation should be concise and precise; spreadsheet 
tables  and  schemas  should  be  used  where  needed  to  illustrate  targets,  achievements,  costs  and 
financing. 
7. 
An  AWPB  primary  consists  of  seven  parties  (chapters),  which  first  update  the  past 
achievements with focus on the previous year’s, then address the projections for the upcoming fiscal 
year: 
(a)  Update on past achievements

8. 
The  AWPB  along  with  procurement  plan  will  be  drawn  up  by  the  Project  Office  with  the 
supervision of the  Project  Director and  the support of M&E and Finance units and technical staff, in 
consultation  with DCUs, implementing partners and stakeholders including beneficiaries (e.g. farmer 
groups  and  women)  where  relevant.  The  PO  will  prepare  draft  consolidated  AWPB  for  each  Fiscal 
Year,  based  upon  district  level  plans  and  AWPBs  prepared  by  each  implementing  agency  for  their 
respective section of the Project implementation. Each draft AWPB will include, among other things, a 
detailed description of planned Project activities for the relevant Project Year, the sources and uses of 
funds there for and updated the procurement plan.  
9. 
The PO will submit a draft consolidated AWPB to the PSC for its approval no later than 90 
days  before  the  beginning  of  the  relevant  Fiscal  Year.  Once  approved,  the  PO  will  submit  the  draft 
AWPB to IFAD for comments and approval, no later than 60 days before the beginning of the relevant 
Fiscal Year.  
10. 
The  PD,  DCU,  operational  support  team  and  related  implementing  agencies  will  adopt  the 
AWPBs substantially  in the form approved by  PSC  and IFAD. The  PO  will  provide copies thereof to 
IFAD,  prior  to  the  commencement  of  the  relevant  Project  Year.  If  required  by  IFAD,  the  PO  will 
propose  adjustments in the AWPB with the approval of the  PSC. Such adjustments  will be effective 
upon approval by the IFAD. The AWPB will be informed by an assessment of current implementation 
progress and will describe the strategic direction of the project for the coming year along with results 
expected  (targets)  under  each  component  and  how  those  results  will  be  achieved.  This  will  be 
complemented  by  a  resource  plan,  budget  and  risk  analysis  for  each  result.  The  AWPB  will  also 
include plans for training and technical assistance, M&E and procurement for the year in question. 
11. 
Monitoring  and  evaluation.  The  integrated  Monitoring  and  Evaluation  (M&E)  and 
Knowledge  Management  (KM)  system  will  be  developed  in  accordance  with  IFAD  guidelines  and 
government frameworks. It will have with three main objectives as following:  
(i)  monitoring  results:  it  will  enable  the  tracking  project  outputs  and  outcomes,  within 
farmer groups and communities, between genders, age groups and different social groups.  
(ii)  implementation  guiding  and  policy  dialogue:  the  information  and  analysis  of  data  will 
support  timely  results-based  management  at  all  levels  to  develop  profitable  and 
sustainable activities and to adapt strategies accordingly. It will also support policy decision 
making of MOA to better respond to the challenges of agricultural commercialisation in the 
Southern Bangladesh. 
(iii)  knowledge  sharing  and  scaling  up  of  good  practices:  the  integrated  M&E  and  KM 
system  will  capture  lessons,  shortcomings  for  risk  management,  good  practices, 
successful innovations and technologies options or scaling up. 
12. 
Strategic  principles.  The  integrated  M&E  and  KM  system’s features  will  be:  (i)  open  and 
easily  accessible,  i.e.  information  and  knowledge  should  be  available  to  all  stakeholders  and  not 
restricted  to  project  or  MOA  staff;  (ii)  participatory  and  accountable:  the  process  of  planning, 
monitoring and knowledge dissemination will involve associate project stakeholders and beneficiaries 
with two-way communication i.e. upward (to and from government and IFAD) but also downward (to 
and from project stakeholders and target groups) and horizontal (with other projects); (iii) focused on 
analysis, learning and sharing in support of decision-making and policy dialogue, and not merely on 
data  production  and  consolidation;  (iv)  harmonised  with  and  connected  the  government’s  relevant 
information  systems  such  as  Access  to  Information  (a2i)  Programme  and  to  IFAD  country  portfolio 
M&E system; (v)  inclusive  to allow  women, poor and  marginalised groups  participate in the system; 
(vi) strengthening: building capacity and better respond to the people needs and market demand.  
13. 
Purpose and scope. The Monitoring and Evaluation System will be developed as a tool to 
ensure  the  efficacy  of  the  project  in  delivering  results  and  in  bringing  about  important  learning  to 
inform the replication and scaling-up agenda of the government and other development partners. For 
this purpose, the  M&E system will ensure the collection,  analysis and communication of information 
90 
People’s Republic of Bangladesh 
Smallholder Agricultural Competitiveness Project (SACP) 
Final project design report 
Appendix 6:  Planning, M&E and learning and knowledge management 
on project progress and effectiveness for results-based management as well as  provide for carrying 
out  thematic  studies  and  evaluations  of  pilot  initiatives  that  can  inform  decision-making  and  risk 
management at both local and national levels.   
14. 
Data  collection  and  monitoring  reporting  framework. 
The participatory M&E and KM system will be decentralized from the 
Lead Agency at central level to Coordination Units at district, upazila 
and  union  levels  under  the  guidance  of  a  Project  Director  with  the 
support from TA and in consultation with project stakeholders. It will 
incorporate  regular  data  collection  and  feedback  from  beneficiaries 
and implementing partners. The data will be collected and analyzed 
at  upazila  and  district  levels  for  both  outputs  and  outcomes  to  the 
extent possible prior to the compilation and in-depth analysis by the 
Lead Agency at central level. The SACP management will report to 
IFAD and as well downstream to implementing partners and beneficiaries.

Figure: Data collection level 
(i)  Union and Upazila  level,  information  will be gathered  by  SAAO and market facilitators,  and 
concerned  field-level  staff  of  BARI  and  BADC.  To  avoid  multiple  counting  of  beneficiaries, 
activities will be recorded in a master beneficiary database or by household; 
(ii)  District level (DCU), concerned M&E officers will provide guidance and support to the upazila, 
and  will  assemble  data  on  the  achievements  of  their  respective  components.  The  data 
collected  at  this  level  will  also  analysed  to  identify  lessons,  good  practices  and  bottleneck 
which will feed into the SACP MIS system monitored at the central level; 
(iii)  At  central  level  (PD),  information  will  encompass  overall  project  performance  as  periodic 
progress  reports  (semi–annual  and  annual)  to  be  submitted  to  IFAD.  It  will  be  the 
responsibility of the Project Director and M&E Officer. 
15. 
Human  resource  capacity  for  M&E.  The  project’s  M&E  system  will  lead  by  the  M&E 
Specialist in the operational support unit under the supervision of Project Director at the central level. 
It  will  be  also  supported  by  M&E  officers  based  at  the  DCUs  who  will  be  the  day-to-day  performing 
data collection and periodic qualitative and quantities analysis. At the field-level, SAAOs under DAE, 
Market  Facilitators  under  DAM  and  concerned  staff  under  BARI  and  BADC  will  directly  collect 
information  and  interact  with  beneficiaries  and  stakeholders.  Relevant  training  and  capacity 
development  specifically  on  aspects  relevant  to  the  project  M&E  (e.g.  participatory  monitoring  and 
evaluation, use of information technology in M&E, risk monitoring, analytical assessment, etc.) will be 
availed of as required and in line with the AWPB training plan and the capacity development plan of 
the M&E manual.  
16. 
RIMS  and  logframe.  The  SACP  logical  framework  will  be  used  as  roadmap  for  annual 
planning,  monitoring  and  evaluation.  In  line  with  IFAD’s  revised  Results  and  Impact  Management 
System (RIMS), expected results will be measured at two levels; outputs and outcomes on a semi and 
annual  basis.  Core  indicators  will  be  integrated  in  the  logical  framework  from  the  project design 
and will be monitored through its participatory M&E system. The project logframe will be linked to the 
economic and financial analysis.  
17. 
Data  will  be  collected  against  both  qualitative  and  quantitative  indicators  disaggregated  by 
gender,  age  and  other  socio-economic  status  to  the  extent  possible  so  as  to  enable  a  proper 
assessment as to whether the project is reaching its intended target beneficiaries, poor households, 
smallholders,  women  and  vulnerable  groups.  Furthermore,  the  M&E  system  will  collect  and  analyse 
information  about  project  outreach,  effectiveness  of  the  targeting  strategy  and  target  group  specific 
benefits, environmental impact and vulnerability and cost-effectiveness of implemented activities. This 
requires  strong  coordination  and  collaboration  among  staff  at  the  lead  agency  and  implementing 
partners. IFAD is currently revising RIMS and if possible, SACP will align with the updated version of 
the system.

18. 
Linkage SACP with COSOP. SACP will identify relevant project indicators to COSOP level. 
In  addition  to  the  logframe  and  RIMS  indicators,  the  project  will  report  on  the  COSOP  indicators  to 
IFAD country office (CO) in Bangladesh on a semi-annual basis. The results will be consolidated and 
analysed  at  the  country  level  to  integrate  into  excel  and  on-line  COSOP  monitoring  and  evaluation 
system.  For  this  purpose,  the  project  will  use  SIMES  for  data  storage  and  analysis.  The  COSOP 
monitoring  system  will  be  used  to  track  and  improve  the  capacity  of  all  projects  in  achieving  the 
strategic objectives mentioned in the COSOP. 
19. 
Key  elements  of  the  project  M&E  system  are  as  follows:  (i)  a  practical  M&E  manual 
detailing  objectives,  scope,  clear  reporting  structure,  staffing,  capacity  building  plan,  roles  and 
responsibilities,  budget  and  M&E-related  activities  with  timeframe;  (ii)  annual  M&E  plans;  (iii)  IFAD 
RIMS  reporting:  quarterly  update  on  the  achievement  of  each  indicator  set  in  the  project  logframe, 
even  in  the  first  few  years  of  implementation  when  higher-level  results  are  not  yet  expected;  (iv) 
Management information system (v) baseline, mid-term outcome and completion studies; (vi) annual 
outcome surveys; (vii) annual and semi-annual reports to be submitted to IFAD; (viii) risk assessment 
and exist strategy; (ix) thematic studies and (x) field visits and joint implementation reviews. 
20. 
Management  Information  System  (MIS).  SACP  will  develop  a  Management  Information 
System (MIS) to support data management. The project MIS  will track and regularly update financial 
and  technical  data  on  project  outputs  and  outcomes,  lessons  learnt,  good  practices,  and  other 
important  sector  information  to  analyse  project  performance  along  with  appropriate  formats  such  as 
dashboards, charts and maps. A computerized MIS will be designed to allow decentralized inputting of 
data  and  centralized  analysis  and  storage  can  serve  as  a  useful  tool  for  project  management  and 
other relevant stakeholders. The MIS will be under the responsibility of the Senior M&E Officer. 
21. 
An  ICT-enabled  data  collection  tools  (possibly  GIS  mapping,  mobile  phones  or  tablets, 
standard  IFAD  Monitoring  and  Evaluation  system  (SIMES)  excel  database,  and  online  monitoring 
platform) will also be developed to timely monitor on-going interventions and feed data into the MIS. 
The  MIS  will  be  designed  and  set  up  by  an  MIS  expert  upon  assessment  of  information  needs  for 
decision  making  at  various  levels.  The  MIS  processes  data  into  information  useful  for  the  various 
levels  of  decision-making  in  the  project,  including  also  feeding  project-specific  data  into  the  broader 
management  information  system  of  the  Access  to  Information  (a2i)  Programme  of  Prime  Minister's 
Office which is currently developing an agricultural service portal and e-services. 
22. 
Analysis.    Data  will  be  consolidated  and  analysed    at  district  and  central  level  so    as    to  
provide    information    on    the  performance  of  the  various  components,  detect  problems,  identify 
possible solutions and track good practices to share through the knowledge management system. 
23. 
M&E manual will be developed immediately upon start-up detailing the project results chain; 
the  M&E  framework;  the  scope,  organisation  and  contents  of  the  M&E  system;  roles  and 
responsibilities; how data (sex- and age-disaggregated where appropriate) will be collected, analysed, 
reported,  used  and  otherwise  managed  (tools  and  methods);  a  timeline  for  M&E  related  activities; 
staffing and capacity building plan; budget; etc.  
24. 
Annual  M&E  plans  will  be  elaborated  and  submitted  alongside  AWPBs.  The  annual  M&E 
plans  will  describe  the  specific  M&E  related  activities  taking  place  during  the  year,  including  day-to-
day monitoring, any thematic studies, annual outcome survey or other methods for assessing results, 
approach for extracting lessons and knowledge management activities.  
25. 
Impact  will  be  assessed  on  the  basis  of  methodologically  sound  baseline,  mid-term  and 
completion  surveys  which  use  the  same  approach  so  as  to  allow  a  meaningful  before,  during 
implementation at completion in order to carry out a comparison analysis. These surveys will include a 
comparison group so a difference-in-differences analysis can be conducted at the end of the project to 
strengthen the assessment of effectiveness and impact. The surveys will elicit data at the impact and 
outcome  level  according  to  the  project  logical  framework  and  RIMS  indicators  as  well  as  socio-
demographic data and other relevant information for targeting, planning and evaluation. It is essential 
92 
People’s Republic of Bangladesh 
Smallholder Agricultural Competitiveness Project (SACP) 
Final project design report 
Appendix 6:  Planning, M&E and learning and knowledge management 
that  a  baseline  study  will  be  carried  out  immediately  upon  start-up  in  order  to  inform  overall  project 
planning,  ensure  benchmarks  and  realistic  targets  are  set  for  outcomes  and  impact.  The  baseline 
study  will  include  a  household  survey  to  assess  socio-economic  level  of  beneficiaries  and  group 
beneficiaries in different sub-target groups. It will also assess the knowledge, attitude and behaviour 
of  farmers.  The  Mid-term  and  impact  evaluation  will  follow  the  same  methodology  as  the  baseline 
study to allow meaningful comparison, although the scope of the impact evaluation may be broadened 
to  cover  other  aspects  of  project  relevance,  effectiveness,  efficiency,  impact  and  sustainability  to 
adequately inform the project’s completion report. A midterm review will be conducted in year three or 
half  way  of  project  implementation.  The  review  will  assess  the  relevance  (i.e.  internal  and  external 
validity  of  project  design),  effectiveness  (progress  towards  targets),  and  efficiency  (funds  disbursed 
vis-à-vis achievements) of the project. Any suggested changes in design, implementation  approach, 
cost or targets should be assessed and endorsed by IFAD. 
26. 
Outcomes will be monitored regularly through the logical framework, MTR assessment and 
thematic outcome surveys to ensure the project is on track vis-à- vis results and allow timely decision-
making  if  results  are  not  being  achieved  as  expected.  As  per  the  theory  of  change,  there  may  be 
several levels of outcomes. Some can be measured by implementing partners on the ground as part 
of  their  day-to-day  reporting,  while  other  outcomes  may  need  to  be  captured  through  AOSs.  It  is 
relevant  to  start  outcome  monitoring  at  the  time  of  the  baseline  survey  and  continue  on  an  annual 
basis to allow tracking of the validity of the proposed theory of change and results chain.  The project 
results chain is a description of the project logic according to the theory of change which details how 
results  are  expected  to  derive  from  the  implementation  of  project  interventions.  This  will  allow  the 
project to describe progress according to the logframe and thereby inform project management of the 
likelihood of reaching development objectives and outcomes.  
27. 
Output monitoring focuses on the proximal results of activities. The main tool for this is the 
AWPB  and  regular  progress  reports  given  that  it  also  describes  the  results  which  planned  activities 
are expected to achieve. Concurrently, AWPB progress monitoring involves tracking implementation of 
activities and budget expenditure. This allows the  integration  of physical and financial reporting  with 
ensuing cost- effectiveness and efficiency analyses. Each implementing partner contributes to output 
and AWPB  progress monitoring  reports  submitted  to  the  relevant  line  agencies  and  compiled  at  the 
lead agency in line with the overall SACP M&E framework. Progress monitoring will start at the field 
level. Project beneficiaries  and field-level implementers will  be the first link in the chain of reporting, 
which  subsequently  continues  to  union,  district  levels  of  implementing  agencies  and  to  the  central 
level at the lead agency and IFAD on a quarterly, semi-annual and annual basis respectively.  
28. 
Outreach  will  be  measured  as  the  number  of  people,  households  and  groups  (farmer 
groups) benefitting from project interventions disaggregated by sex, age and socio-economic groups 
where  possible.  Primarily  this  will  be  participants  of  farmer  production  and  marketing  groups,  but 
additionally,  a  strategy  must  be  developed  for  how  to  calculate  the  beneficiaries  from  water 
management  infrastructure  and  other  activities.  The  lead  agency  will  explore  the  possibility  of 
developing  a  register  of  direct  beneficiaries  to  avoid  double  counting  when  outreach  is  being 
assessed. Indirect beneficiaries are defined as people benefitting from project services (e.g. through 
improved  food  safety  along  value  chain  services)  while  not  themselves  being  in  direct  contact  with 
project  implementers.  Targeting  effectiveness  will  be  assessed  in  an  on-going  fashion  through 
tracking  of  results  by  sub-target  groups  including  the  different  socio-economic  groups  (landless, 
marginal,  smallholder,  medium  and  large  farmers)  as  well  as  women  and  youth.  The  needs  and 
realities  of  these  groups  are  different,  project  interventions  will  be  different  and  following  on  this, 
measurement of results must be able to clarify whether benefits are accruing to all sub-target groups 
effectively. 
29. 
Cost-effectiveness of interventions and of the project overall will be assessed in two ways: 
(i)  day-to-day  tracking  of  AWPB  and  procurement  combining  physical  and  financial  progress;  (ii)  as 
part  of  thematic  studies  of  specific  interventions;  and  finally  as  an  end-of-project  assessment  of  the

cost of bringing people out of poverty (cost per beneficiary), of increased HVC productivity and other 
core aspects of the project as per the development objective and core outcomes.  
30. 
Risk  assessment.  The  project  logframe  includes  a  column  on  assumptions  that  are  highly 
relevant to monitor for assessing the validity  of the results chain of the project  and  to manage risks 
related  to  project  outreach,  targeting,  effectiveness  and  sustainability.  At  the  same  time,  new  risks 
may be identified in connection with AWPB preparation and should be included in the risk monitoring 
matrix. 
31. 
initiatives, assessment of targeting effectiveness, gender equality and women’s empowerment etc. 
Thematic  studies  will  be  carried  out  as  per  need  and  relevance  for  the  evaluation  of  pilot 
32. 
Field visits and joint implementation review missions will be carried out on a regular basis by 
project staff, IFAD supervision teams and government representatives. Qualitative data will be sought 
on  these  field  visits  to  complement  quantitative  data  in  the  performance  monitoring  processes. 
Missions will validate results reported through RIMS and in general. 
33. 
Theory  of  Change  (ToC).  Learning from the experiences of other IFAD-funded projects in 
Bangladesh,  there  is  a  need  to  develop  a  more  comprehensive  and  reliable  M&E  and  KM  system 
whereby  the  project  is  able  to  show  the  outcomes  and  results  intended  by  the  interventions.  Past 
experiences show that often M&E is  used  in  the projects for accountability, remains at project  level, 
focuses only data compilation not much on qualitative analysis and nor for learning. As a result, the 
M&E system often fails to produce data around the intervention’s ultimate goals/ desired changes. 
34. 
Thus,  learning  from  these  experiences,  the  project  will  use  the  ToC  model  together  with 
M&E tool. The ToC model will provide a road map defining where the project aims to reach and how 
and  how  often  the  targeted  changes  and  assumptions  can  be  monitored  by  the  Project  Office  and 
District  Coordination  Units  (DCUs)  and  operational  support  teams.  In  addition,  the  ToC  model  also 
reduces the amount of data and information to collect by applying a reflective and systemic M&E and 
helps  in  a  more  realistic  planning.  The  process  will  be  participatory  whereby  project  staff,  project 
stakeholders and beneficiaries are involved in developing the theory as well as in periodical revisions 
and updates, at least once in every six months. 
35. 
Learning  and  knowledge  management. The core relevance of the M&E system is in the 
use  of  the  information  for  planning  and  decision-making  as  well  as  accountability.  An  integrated 
knowledge management and communication (KMC) strategy will be developed in line with IFAD policy 
on KM and built on three core pillars of knowledge management: people, process and technology. It 
will  include  information  management,  monitoring  and  evaluation,  innovation  and  experimentation, 
internal  and  external  communication  and  learning.  The  previously  mentioned  MIS  and  M&E  system 
will be a core part of this strategy and will be sources of information from which key lessons need to 
be extracted and appropriately disseminated.  
36. 
Knowledge tools and platform. Similar to the overall and annual M&E plans, the project will 
develop  KM  plans  and  incorporate  KM  into  the  M&E  plans.  The  primary  aspect  will  be  internal 
knowledge management but given the proliferation of interventions related to development of the high 
value crops (HVC) production and marketing in Bangladesh. Progress reports will include sections on 
lessons learned, challenges and best practices and these must be captured by project management, 
analysed across the project and communicated for improved implementation. Some vehicles for this 
communication  will  be  quarterly  review  meetings  with  implementing  partners,  planning  workshops, 
and  newsletters.  Through  this  process  attention  will  be  put  on  ensuring  that  lessons  are  used  in 
decision-making.  
37. 
Multi-stakeholders’  platform  in each region  will provide a venue for smallholder farmers, 
institutional  buyers,  private  sector  and  relevant  stakeholders  to  better  facilitate  input  and  output 
market  linkages  and  to  discuss  industry  problems  and  constraints  in  a  holistic  manner  thereby 
ensuring  that  the  interests  of  all  stakeholders  are  represented  and  protected.  In  addition,  DAE 
together  with  other  implementing  agencies  will  organize  monthly  coordinating  meeting  to  share  the

achievements  and  innovations,  successes  and  (potential  and  current)  problems,  lessons,  good 
practices as well as possible solutions including non-project based solutions and policy issues.  
38. 
A  project  website  will  be  developed  at  early  stage  of  implementation  to  be  used  as  a 
knowledge sharing platform and also linked to IFAD communication channels. Learning flows will be 
developed in KMC strategy and used on a regular basis, including planning  workshops, stakeholder 
review  meetings,  knowledge  products  and  communication  materials  to  be  shared  with  all 
stakeholders.  Quarterly  review  meetings  with  implementing  partners  will  be  organized  by  project  to 
focus on progress, lessons learnt in terms of challenges and good practices etc.  
39. 
Flowing of information from and to beneficiaries and implementing partners in the field is of 
utmost  relevance  in  fostering  ownership  and  participation.  Another  important  aspect  will  be  liaising 
with  other  development actors, exchanging knowledge and  best practices between SACP  and  other 
projects  will  be  arranged  for  lateral  knowledge  transfer  and  learning.  This  might  be  in  the  form  of 
exchange  visits,  bulletins,  participating 
thematic/innovation  enhancement  networks  and 
partnerships as well as South-South cooperation. Moreover, SACP will draw from the expertise of and 
collaborate  with  the  Access  to  Information  (a2i)  Programme  of  Prime  Minister's  Office  which  is 
currently  developing  an  agricultural  service  portal  and  e-services  for  the  production  of  relevant 
knowledge products and communication materials, including press releases, extension materials, and 
radio spots.

I. Financial Management Assessment 
40.  The lead project agency and the implementing agencies are required to maintain acceptable 
financial management systems to guarantee an appropriate use of funds and reliability in the 
financial  reporting.  A  financial  management  assessment  of  the  Smallholder  Agriculture 
Competitiveness  Project  (herein  referred  to  as  “SACP”  or  the  “Project”)  was  carried  out  in 
accordance with IFAD’s Guidance Note on Undertaking Financial Management Assessment 
at Design, issued in 2012. The objective of the FM assessment is to provide assurance that 
the lead project agency and the implementing agencies will have sufficiently strong financial 
management systems and controls  in  place to properly manage, control  and report project 
finances  in  order  to  ensure  that  project  funds  are  used  economically  and  efficiently  for  the 
purpose 
the 
implementing  agencies  at  applicable  levels,  the  assessment  has  found  the  proposed 
arrangements to be acceptable.  
intended.  On  the  understanding  that  SACP  will  be  implemented  by 
41.  The assessed FM risk of the project is considered high as summarized in Table 1. 
Public Financial Management and Governance 
42.  The  Public  Expenditure  and  Financial  Accountability  2016  (PEFA),  assessment  indicates 
that  seven  performance  indicators  improved,  fourteen  remain  the  same  and  seven 
deteriorated since the last PEFA of 2010. Control in budget execution, reporting, accounting 
and audit still remain weak in Bangladesh PFM.  
43. 
In the second multi-year PFM reform strategy 2016-2021, three important issues have been 
prioritized. These are:  capacity development in revenue mobilization, implementation of the 
Budget  and  Accounts  Classification  System  (BACS)  and  the  implementation  of  a  modern 
information technology system (Integrated Budget and Accounting System iBAS++). Existing 
initiatives  to  improve  auditing  systems  and  ensure  transparency  and  accountability  in 
government expenditure will be continued. The thrust of the current PFM reform is to build 
on  the  past  and  to  strengthen  initiatives  that  have  struggled  to  take  hold.  Overall, 
weaknesses  remain,  particularly  in  the  control  environment  and  tax  system,  as  well  as 
inefficiencies resulting from the fragmentation of recurrent and development budgets.  
44. 
Internal controls and internal audit remain an area of substantial weakness across the PFM 
system in Bangladesh. The control environment is dependent on detailed financial rules and 
regulations  that  outline  in  great  detail  internal  controls  that  should  be  followed  for  all 
transactions; however, these are often circumvented by officers themselves to expedite their 
workloads (PEFA 2016).  
45.  Manual  accounting  remains  the  prevalent  practice  across  Bangladesh  public  institutions. 
Annual  financial  reports  are  prepared  using  a  combination  of  IPSAS  and  Bangladesh 
Government  accounting  standards,  which  accommodate  the  ‘modified-cash’  basis  of 
accounting.  Initiatives  such  us  the  iBAS++  (important  element  of  the  World  Bank  project 
SPEMP)  are  being  designed  to  support  both  cash  and  accrual  basis  of  accounting  and 
intend  to  provide  transparency  and  an  enhanced  control  framework  to  support  financial 
decision-making at all levels of government. A recent World Bank Policy Note reviewed key 
issues  for  the  successful  implementation  of  iBAS++,  such  as  the  capability  to  be  used  for 
97 
People’s Republic of Bangladesh 
Smallholder Agricultural Competitiveness Project (SACP) 
Final project design report 
Appendix 7:  Financial management and disbursement arrangements 
donor funded projects. The implementation of IBAS++ is not expected to be effective in the 
short term.  
46. 
In  terms  of  government  administration,  Bangladesh  is  divided  into  eight  administrative 
divisions: Barisal, Chittagong, Dhaka, Mymensingh, Khulna, Rajshahi, Rangpur and Sylhet. 
Each division is named according to the largest city within its jurisdiction, which at the same 
time serves at its administrative centre. The divisions are composed of 64 districts, or zilas, 
each run by a Deputy Commissioner appointed by the government. The districts are further 
divided into 489 sub-districts called Upazilas, which in turn are made up of Unions. 
47.  Every  administrative  unit  maintains  a  representation  from  its  line  Ministry,  with  whom 
consolidates its financial information. The Office of the Controller General of Accounts (CGA) 
is responsible for compilation and consolidation of Finance and Appropriation accounts of all 
Ministries,  following  the  accounting  principles  and  procedures  established  by  the  Office  of 
the Comptroller & Auditor General (OC&CAG). 
48.  All  financial  transactions  made  under  the  administrative  architecture  of  Bangladesh  are 
handled  by  56  banks  widely  spread  across  their  entire  territory,  that  operate  under  the  full 
control  and  supervision  of  the  Central  Bank  of  Bangladesh.  Government  transactions  are 
made  mainly  via  checks  and  cash  transactions  are  not  a  common  practice  across 
government institutions.  
Financial Management of the Implementing Agency 
49.  The implementation of SACP is expected to count with the following strengths in the area of 
FM:  (i)  given  strong  GoB  commitment,  institutional  and  policy  framework  for  implementing 
agricultural development projects; (ii) some of the implementing agencies have exposure to 
the  IFAD´s  financial  management  policies;  and  (iii)  IFAD  has  co-financed  some  projects 
implement by the MoA. 
50.  The  main  weakness  that  the  project  will  need  to  face  is  that  the  implementation  will  be 
carried  out  in  eleven  cost  centres  located  in  the  targeted  districts.  At  this  level,  the  FM 
capacity  is  very  low,  and  finding  trained  accountants  is  very  difficult.  Therefore,  identifying 
finance staff for the DCUs will be a challenge that the project will need to address effectively.  
FM training on a continuous basis will also need to be present during the life of the project. 
51.  The inherent risk of the project is deemed to be high.

individual  consultants  openly  recruited:  one  Financial  Management  Specialist  and  two 
Finance Assistants. 
54.  The Implementing Agencies, will be composed by Accountants openly recruited. Four in total 
for DAE, BADC, BARI and DAM respectively. 
55.  Every cost centre located at the district level (DCUs), will be composed of one full-time staff 
filled  with  and  individual  Accountant  openly  recruited:  eleven  district  accountants.  In  larger 
districts may be necessary to recruit one more Finance Assistant. 
56.  The duties, responsibilities, lines of supervision, and limits of authority of finance staff will be 
defined in their ToR and will be documented in the SACP finance manual. 
57.  Budgeting.  The 
lead 
implementing  agency  of  SACP  will  prepare  a  consolidated 
“Development  Project  Proforma/Proposal”  (DPP)  following  the  guidelines  of  the  Planning 
Division. DPP cost allocation table and the category wise budget allocation of the financing 
agreement sets the budget for the entire term of the project. However, detailed budgets and 
procurement  plans  for  each  fiscal  year  on  each  project  component  and  cost  category,  will 
also  be  produced  to  provide  a  framework  for  FM  purposes,  which  is  also  required  for  the 
consolidated  Annual  Work  Plan  Budget  (AWPB).  These  budgets  will  be  monitored 
periodically to ensure actual expenditures are in line with the budgets, and to provide input 
for  necessary  revisions.  The  project  budget  will  be  included  in  line  departments’  overall 
budget. 
58.  The  procured  accounting  software  will  include  budgetary  control  features  that  will  enable 
project accurate tracking of actual expenditure on a similar chart of accounts as the budget, 
and the preparation and review of regular budget monitoring reports. 
Funds Flow and Disbursements.  There will be two Designated Accounts at the Central 
59. 
Bank of Bangladesh under SAFE arrangements to receive the funds of the loan and the grant 
respectively. The DAs will be managed by the PD, and transfers to the Implementing Agencies will be 
made according to consolidated financial information and approved AWPBs. The project will open two 
Project Accounts in local currency to receive transfers from the Designated Accounts at the PO level. 
Also, four project sub-accounts in local currency will be opened for the corresponding implementing 
agencies, namely DAE, DAM, BADC and BARI to receive transfers from the Project Accounts. A 
separate sub-account will also be opened for each DCU, if needed to receive transfers from the 
Project Accounts. 
60. 
The  PO  will  be  responsible  for  transferring  project  funds  to  the  operating  accounts  of  the 
Implementing Agencies. These transfers will be treated as advances at the PD, with monthly reporting 
on the use of funds, and these accounts will appear as unreconciled items on the financial statements 
until they have been accounted for and liquidated. 
61. 
A start-up advance will be provided once the financing agreement has become effective, to 
facilitate  implementation  readiness  activity,  pending  satisfaction  of  the  disbursement  conditions 
specified  in  the  financing  agreement.  The  ceiling  of  the  start-up  will  be  agreed  upon  at  negotiations 
based on a realistic plan.

Internal  Controls.  SACP  will  be  required  to  establish  adequate  internal  controls  and 
procedures  in  the  PIM  and  in  the  Financial  Manual  to  guarantee:  (a)  operations  are  being 
conducted  effectively  and  efficiently;  (b)  financial  and  operational  reporting  is  reliable;  (c) 
applicable  laws  and  regulations  are  being  complied  with,  and  (d)  assets  and  records  are 
safeguarded. 
64.  At a minimum, the procedures should include the following measures: (a) Reliable personnel 
with  clear  responsibilities  i.e.  segregation  of  duties;  (b)  Adequate  financial  records 
management system with complete audit trail; (c) Physical safeguard, including use of safe, 
locks,  guards,  limited  access,  and  access  by  authorized  persons  to  provide  security  for 
program  assets;  (d)  Independent  check,  with  procedures  made  subject  to  random 
independent reviews. 
65.  Accounting. The accounting policies and procedures of the project will be governed by the 
Bangladesh  Government  Accounting  Standards  under  cash  basis  of  accounting,  and  the 
existing  GoB  system  outlined  in  the  Project  Accounting  Manual  of  the  Ministry  of  Finance. 
The PO  will have the  primary responsibility to maintain  an  adequate FM system across all 
levels  of  implementation  of  the  project  and  to  provide  accurate  and  timely  financial 
information to the Government and IFAD. 
66.  The project will procure and adopt an accounting system package conforming international 
standards  during  start-up.  In  addition,  a  simplified  FM  system  will  be  implemented  at  the 
District Coordination Units to ensure proper reporting to each of the Implementing Agencies. 
The  project  will  guarantee  the  availability  of  resources  to  conduct  periodic  training  on  the 
use of the accounting software to strengthen the capacity at the district level. 
67.  As there have been positive results from the use on an accounting software by LGED which 
has  been  recalibrated  to  meet  the  accounting  and  reporting  requirement  for  both 
government  and  IFAD,  MoA  should  consider  using  the  same  software  for  SACP,  which 
would provide the Project better value for money. 
68.  The key project accounting functions for which  PO would be responsible are as follows: (i) 
consolidation  of  budget  preparation  and  monitoring  from  the  Implementing  Agencies;  (ii) 
payments  for  major  eligible  project  expenditure;  (iii)  disbursement  of  project  funds  to  the

including advances to the implementing agencies; (vi) consolidation of financial reports from 
DCUs, and (vi) preparation of Withdrawal Application to claim funds from IFAD. 
69.  The  key  accounting  function  for  which  DCUs  would  be  responsible  are  as  follows:  (i) 
contribution  to  the  budget  preparation;  (ii)  fund  requisition  to  PO  on  the  basis  of  three 
months estimated expenditure and approved work plans; (iii) preparation and submission of 
standard reporting format (fund utilization report); (iv) collection and consolidation of reports 
from the DCUs together with bank statements; (v) submission of reports to PD. 
70.  Financial  reporting.  The  PO  will  be  responsible  of  consolidating  the  financial  information 
from the Implementing Agencies and to prepare semi-annual and annual (audited) Financial 
Reports (FRs) for all relevant parties.  The Implementing  Agencies (DAE,  BADC, DAM and 
BARI)  will  be  responsible  of  consolidating  the  financial  information  from  the  District 
Coordination  Units  (DCUs).  The  FRs  will  be  consistent  with  International  Accounting 
Standards and the project’s Finance  Manual.  Semi-annual Financial Reports  with accurate 
and updated financial information will be prepared by the  PO for submission to IFAD within 
45 days from the end of each semester. 
71.  Financial  Reports  will  be  produced  directly  from  the  automated  project  accounting  system 
(with  the  capability  to  report  by  component  and  by  category  of  expenditure),  and  not  from 
any other stand-alone manual or electronic system. The PO and the Implementing Agencies 
will need to have the capacity to record GoB contributions, as well as in-kind contributions of 
private companies and beneficiaries, if necessary. 
72. 
Internal  auditing.  Will  be  carried  out  by  private  firm  twice  in  the  life  of  the  project.  The 
preparation of the audit plan will take into account the different levels and agencies involved 
in the implementation.  
73.  Going beyond the financial aspects  and transactions, the  internal audit  will be  expected to 
be  carried  out  under  the  following  key  internal  audit  functions:  (i)  ascertaining  whether  the 
system of internal checks and controls operating within the project for preventing errors and 
fraud  is  effective  in  design  as  well  as  in  operation;  (ii)  ascertaining  reliability  of  accounting 
and  other  records  as  well  as  seeing  that  accounting  methods  provide  the  information 
necessary  for  preparation  of  correct  financial  statements;  (iii)  ascertaining  the  extent  to 
which  the  project's  assets  are  safeguarded  from  any  unauthorized  use  or  losses;  (iv) 
ascertaining whether administrative and financial regulations of the government and IFAD’s 
requirements  are  followed;  and  (v)  ascertaining  the  effectiveness  of  the  system  of  internal 
control adopted in preventing, as well as detecting waste, idle capacity and extravagance.  
74.  The terms of reference for the internal audits will be prepared by the  PO and submitted for 
the IFAD´s no-objection. 
75.  External  audit.  The  Foreign  Aided  Projects  Audit  Directorate  (FAPAD)  of  the  Office  of  the 
Comptroller  &  Auditor  General  (OC&CAG)  of  Bangladesh  will  conduct  an  audit  of  the 
project’s annual financial statements within six months of the end of the fiscal year. The audit 
will be carried out on a yearly basis and in compliance with the IFAD Guidelines on Project 
Audits.    According to the performance of the project  and in addition to the  FAPAD  audit, it 
may be possible that IFAD requests the project to be audited by an external audit firm. 
76.  External  auditors  will  be  required  to  express  their  opinion  based  on  IFAD  Guidelines  on 
Project  Audits.  A  detailed  management  letter  containing  the  assessment  of  the  internal

controls,  audit  findings,  update  on  previous  audit  observations,  compliance  with  IFAD 
Financing  Agreement  covenants  and  suggestions  for  improvement  will  be  prepared  and 
submitted together with the audit report. 
77.  Supervision  and  review  on  FM. Shall be undertaken  at  least annually,  usually  as part  of 
the  IFAD  annual  direct  supervision,  and  with  additional  support  missions  as  necessary 
during  project  implementation  to  ensure  that  the  financing  proceeds  are  used  for  the 
purpose for which they were granted, which may take two weeks at the most. The scope of 
the supervision will be carried out in accordance with IFAD’s Guidance Note on Undertaking 
Financial Management Assessment at Supervision, issued in 2015.

Appendix 8: 
Procurement 
1. 
Introduction. Public Procurement Act 2006 (PPA) and the Public Procurement Rules 2008 
(PPR)  are  the  two  legal  documents  that  deal  with  public  procurement  in  Bangladesh.  The  PPA  and 
PPR  disseminate  the  purpose  and  principles  of  Bangladesh’s  public  procurement  and  procedural 
requirements. It has contained good international practices, including: (a) non discriminatory selection 
of  bidders;  (b)  wide  advertising  of  procurement  opportunities;  (c)  public  opening  of  bids  in  a  single 
location; (d) disclosure of all contract awards above a specified threshold on the CPTU’s website; (e) 
clear  accountability  for  delegation  and  decision  making;  (f)  annual  post-procurement  audit  (review); 
(g)  sanctions  for  fraudulent  and  corrupt  practices;  and  (h)  review  mechanism  for  handling  bidders’ 
protests. 
2. 
The PPA and PPR allow for advances in technology by providing for electronic processing in 
public  procurement  in  Bangladesh.  The  system for  doing  this  is  the  E-Government  Procurement  (e-
GP)  system.  E-GP  is  a  lone  web  portal  from  where,  and  through  which,  Procuring  Agencies  and 
Procuring  Entities,  can  perform  their  procurement  related  activities  using  a  dedicated  secured  web 
based  dashboard.  e-GP  is  hosted  at  the  CPTU  Data  Centre,  and  it’s  use  is  governed  by  the  E-
Government Procurement (e-GP) Guidelines. 
3. 
Procurement of goods, works and services of SACP shall be carried out in accordance with 
the  provisions  of  the  Public  Procurement  Act  2006  (PPA)  and  the  Public  Procurement  Rules  2008 
(PPR),  to  the  extent  that  are  consistent  with  IFAD  Procurement  Guidelines.  If  there  is  any  conflict 
between  the  government  and  IFAD  procedures  about  any  unique  procurement,  the  provisions 
identified  in  IFAD  Project  Procurement  Guidelines  and  IFAD  Project  Procurement  Handbook  as 
referenced by the Financing Agreement shall prevail. 
4. 
electronic government procurement (e-GP). 
All National Competitive Bidding (NCB) procurement under SACP will be done through the 
5. 
International  Competitive  Bidding  (ICB)  shall  be  the  mandatory  procurement  method  for 
activities  estimated  to  cost:  (i)  Goods  estimated  to  cost  above  USD  200,000  or  equivalent;  (ii)  Civil 
works estimated to cost  above USD  1,000,000.00  or  equivalent; and (iii) Services estimated to cost 
above USD 100,000 or equivalent. 
6. 
Staffing and capacity development.   Procurement  will  be  conducted  by  the  Project 
Office  and  implementing  agencies  (DAE,  DAM,  BARI  and  BADC)  according  to  the  level  of  authority 
structured  for  the  project.  A  detailed  list  of  common  items  will  be  prepared  for  procurement  through 
Project Office. 
7. 
A  recent  assessment  done  by  World  Bank  for  NATP  II  project  revealed  that  the 
implementing  agencies  have  the  experience  in  the  procurement  function;  however,  their  human 
resources  capacity  is  assessed  as  not  sufficient  to  handle  the  project  procurement  activities.  To 
minimize the associated risk, procurement specialists will be hired in the principal cost centers of the 
project. 
Procurement of vehicles and equipment. 
8. 
Vehicle and motorcycles for the projects will 
most  likely  to  be  procured  through  Direct  Procurement  from  Government  owned  enterprises.  The 
option exists for procurement from other suppliers through the National Open Tender Method (NOTM).

Final project design report 
Appendix 8:  Procurement 
Purchase  of  computers,  photocopiers,  and  other  office  equipment,  equipment  and  tools  for  post-
harvest management and processing would primarily from local suppliers by NOTM  – although there 
also  exists  the  option  of  Request  for  Quotations  (RFQ)  for  standard  specification  items  in  lots 
specified in Schedule II of PPR. Office furniture may be procured by either RFQ or NOTM. Attention is 
required to see that requirements are bulked up wherever practical. 
9. 
Vehicle operating costs would be procured using RFQ and direct procurement. Procurement 
for  office  running  expenses  would  follow  the  same  procedure.  The  procuring  entity  may  undertake 
direct cash purchase of low value goods and urgent essential services such as maintenance, repairs 
transportation etc. in a lot of under BDT 25,000. 
10. 
Procurement  of  studies,  survey,  and  other  specialized  services.  Procurement  of 
Studies: It is envisaged that some of the research work will be carried out by implementing agencies 
and  M&E.  There  will  also  be  requirement  of  specialized  agencies  to  conduct  studies  on  Demand 
Driven  and  Market  Oriented  Research.  The  procurement  of  consultancy  services  to  carry  out  these 
studies and researches would follow the Request for Expression of Interest method. For selection of 
successful  tenderers,  either  Quality  and  Cost  Base  Selection  (QBCS)  or  Fixed  Budget  Selection 
(FSB) or Lest Cost Selection (LCS) negotiation method will be used.     
11. 
Procurement of Training: Training organized by Project Office or the Implementing Agencies 
could  be  procured  through  RFQ  method  if  there  is  small  number  of  qualified  organizations.  Single 
Source Selection method may be used– where there is only a single qualified supplier, or the supplier 
is a government agency that has proven record of working in the required area of expertise. However, 
for many courses, the Project Office or respective implementing agency will organize each element of 
the  training,  and  individual  trainers  may  be  hired  via  Selection  of  Individual  Consultant  (SIC),  with 
training allowances, food and miscellaneous costs paid for via direct procurement or RFQ. 
Recruitment of contracted position. 
12. 
There  will  be  need  for  hiring  new  staff  for  SACP, 
some project staff including the Project Director, four Project  Directors from respective implementing 
agencies  (DAE,  DAM,  BADC  &  BARI)  and  one  Administrative  Officer  would  be  seconded  from 
Government.  Operational  Support  Team  (OST)  will  be  composed  of  Project  Management,  Financial 
Management, Procurement, M&E and KM, Procurement, Gender, Technical Component Coordinators, 
and  other  required  staff  would  be  recruited  by  PO  on  a  contract  basis.  For  such  recruitment,  a 
recruitment committee would form headed by the  PO  with representative of implementing  agencies. 
Candidate  would  be  short  listed  according  to  ToR  which  specifies  the  tasks  to  be  carried  out  and 
required qualifications, experience and other conditions if any. Short listed candidates would then be 
interviewed.  For  senior  positions  (PD,  Component  Directors,  Specialists  of  FM,  M&E/KM, 
Procurement  and  Gender)  the  CVs  of  the  top  three  candidates  for  each  position  would  be  sent  to 
IFAD  for  approval  prior  to  their  appointment.  Draft  ToRs  would  be  included  in  the  draft  Project 
Implementation Manual.  
13. 
 Some  senior  and  specialized  advisory  posts  would  be  filled  by  the  consultants.  The 
preferred  method  is  to  recruit  individual  consultant  using  Selection  of  Individual  Consultants  (SIC) 
method.  The  process  to  be  followed  will  be  the  same  as  prescribed  for  senior  positions  in  above 
paragraph. 
Working with private sector, NGOs and other service providers. 
14. 
project 
activities contain a number of cost sharing components by Private Sector and Beneficiaries. The costs 
structure  will  be  defined 
in  Memorandum  of  Understanding  with  respective  organizations. 
Procurement procedures by the private sector will be defined in memorandum. For beneficiaries, it will 
follow the guidelines for Matching Grant Fund.

Appendix 9: 
SACP cost and financing 
A. MAIN ASSUMPTIONS  
Price  and  physical  Contingencies42:    Price  contingencies  have  been  applied  on  all  items.  Domestic 
inflation  rate  at  the  time  of  the  mission  was  5.5%  and  the  same  has  been  projected  for  the  project 
duration. Foreign inflation rate is assumed at 2.0%. Physical contingencies were calculated at a rate 
of 2% for all items except salaries and allowances. 
Exchange Rates:  The initial exchange rate for the analysis has been set at Bangladesh Taka  82 to 
one  USD,  the  rate  prevailing  during  December  2017.  Exchange  rates  during  implementation  phase 
and the foreign exchange rates forecasts for the Project costs estimates as well as the conversions 
from BDT values into USD are calculated using current exchange rate (BDT/USD). It is likely that the 
BDT per USD may decline slightly between 2018 and 2020. 
Taxes and duties: Taxes and duties have been estimated using the prevailing tax rates at the time of 
data  collection  (March  2017).  All  items,  which  contained  implicit  duties  and  taxes,  have  been 
accounted  for  all  items,  while  nationally  purchased  items  are  subject  to  national  and  local  taxes  of 
different types. For vehicles, equipment and materials, inputs, and operating costs that are purchased 
locally, only VAT or other local taxes of 10% has been assumed. For civil work, a tax rate of 9.5% has 
been  assumed.  A  tax  rate  of  15%  has  been  assumed  for  consulting  services,  studies,  training  and 
workshop.  For  salaries  and  allowance,  not  tax  has  been  assumed.    TA  is  subject  to  taxes  but 
administered by FAO, these taxes are exempt.  
Project  Life:    The  Project  life  is  6  years  starting  the  fiscal  2018/19  and  expected  to  complete  in 
2023/24.  Cost  estimates  for  the  project  period  have  accordingly  been  calculated  and  presented  in 
corresponding Bangladesh Fiscal Year: July to June.  
Unit costs: Unit costs together with physical units have been identified for most items and these are 
input in domestic currency unit, namely BDT and most of the item under TA, the unit costs are input in 
USD.  In  certain  instances  a  lump  sum  allocations  have  been  computed  so  as  to  give  flexibility  in 
procurement  or  for  the  implementation  of  such  activity.  All  unit  costs  under  salaries  and  operating 
costs  are  indicative  and  are  subject  to  changes  during  implementation.  Efforts  were  made  to  use 
prevailing  unit  costs  for  vehicles  and  office  equipment  such  as  laptops,  printers,  desk-tops  and 
furniture and materials and these may vary subject to varying specifications.  
It  is  noted  that  “all  unit  costs  are  indicative  and  are  used  for  the  purposes  of  estimating  the  overall 
project costs. These are, therefore, subject to changes and revision during project implementation and 
also at the time of preparing Annual Work Plans and Budgets”. 
Financiers: The Project will be financed by the following financiers: (i) IFAD loan, (ii) Government of 
Bangladesh, (iii) Private Sector, (iv) Beneficiaries, and (v) IFAD Grant. The cost tables will accordingly 
be revised. 
B. PROJECT COSTS  
Total  project  cost:  Total  Project  Cost  is  estimated  at  USD  109.85  million.  This  is  inclusive  of  all 
contingencies  of  USD  3.99  million,  beneficiary  contribution  in  the  form  of  participation  at  USD  6.6 
42 According to Economic and Policy Division of GOB, the overall physical contingencies should not exceed 2% rate and that of 
the price contingencies at 8% rate. In order to comply with this ceiling, price contingencies at current inflation rate were applied 
to: all civil work items, vehicles and equipment, technical assistance, salary and allowances and all operating costs.

Appendix 10: Economic and Financial Analysis 
Appendix 10:  Economic and Financial Analysis 
Summary 
The  SACP  economic  and  financial  cost  benefit  analysis  estimated  that  the  project  investments  in 
enhanced production of high-value crops, processing and marketing of high-value crops, and surface 
water management would result in agricultural diversification and productivity increase. The analysis 
estimated the following benefits: (1) increased production and productivity of high value-added crops 
(non-paddy  crops);  (2)  improved  agricultural  technology  and  practices  that  increase  productivity;  (3) 
improved water security for agricultural production to reduce water availability risk due to salinization 
and  seasonal  fluctuation;  (4)  improved  marketing,  post-harvest  management,  and  value  addition 
(agro-processing); (5) labor and job creation.    
The analysis was estimated for 180,000 ha of targeted areas operated by 10,000 commodity interest 
groups  with  an  average  household  landholding  of  0.72  ha  (average  of  the  Southern  region  of 
Bangladesh). The average membership in each group is around 25 people, and the total cumulative 
numbers  (beneficiaries)  will  be  250,000  people  in  the  target  areas.  The  cumulative  landholdings  by 
the targeted population will be 180,000 ha in the target 30 upazilas in 11 districts in the southern part 
of Bangladesh.  
The project benefits were quantified based on crop production models of representative farms in the 
Southern  region.  Separate  crop  budgets  were  prepared  for  each  representative  commodity.  The 
major crops that were covered in the analysis are the following: pulse crops (mung beans and grass 
pea),  oil  seeds  (sunflower  seeds),  spices  (garlic  and  turmeric),  fruits  (sapota,  mango,  hog  plum, 
guava,  and  water  melon),  vegetables  (pumpkin,  eggplant,  okra,  tomatoes,  ridge  gourd,  bitter  gourd, 
arum, and country bean), and paddy (high yield Aus variety).  
The project returns were estimated for a 20 year period calculated with the 2017 constant prices using 
a discount rate of 10 percent.  Out of 20 years, 6 years were allocated for the project implementation 
period.  The  financial  prices  for  traded  agricultural  inputs  and  commodities  were  converted  to 
economic prices at import and export parity prices. The prices of non-traded goods and commodities 
were converted to economic prices using a standard conversion factor of 1.06.  
The  total  project  costs  were  estimated  at  around  USD  109.14  million  (around  taka  8.72  billion), 
inclusive of price and physical contingencies. In addition, the recurring costs at 2% of the total project 
cost  were  accounted  from  the  7th  projected  year  onwards  after  the  conclusion  of  the  final  project 
implementation year.  
The project as a whole was estimated to have an economic rate of return (IRR) of 16 percent, the net 
present value (NPV) was around  BDT 2,482 million with a BCR of 1.30. The economic return would 
be  robust,  and  the  return  could  be  maintained  above  the  discount  rate  of  10%  even  with  a  cost 
increase and benefit decrease of 20% as well as a delay of benefit generation for 2 years.   
Methodology of Economic Analysis 
The  economic  analysis  assessed  the  economic  and  financial  returns  to  the  project  based  on  the 
following methodology.

The  total  project  cost  of  USD  109.14  million  was  used  for  the  calculation  of  economic  and 
financial analysis, which is equivalent of 8.72 billion taka using the average exchange rate of 
80  taka  per  1  USD  for  the  project  implementation  period.  In  addition,  the  O&M  costs 
(recurring  costs)  for  maintaining  various  water  management  facilities  and  post-harvest 
technologies  are  incorporated  into  the  analysis.  In  the  analysis,  the  project  implementation 
period was 6 years. The total time frame used for the economic and financial analysis was 20 
years, including 6 years of project implementation and 14 years of operation period.    
Price  and  cost  of  production  data  during  the  implementation  period  were  available  for  the 
representative  agricultural  commodities  that  were  commonly  planted  and  distributed  in  the 
Southern region. Models of 19 crops, including pulse, oilseeds, spices, fruits, vegetables, and 
paddy  were  used  for  the  analysis.  The  analysis  was  conducted  using  a  simple  farm  model 
applying  2015  farmgate  constant  prices,  and  any  post-wholesale  value  creation  activities 
(e.g.,  agro-processing)  were considered  as a proxy  in the analysis due to  a  lack of detailed 
targets of commodities that will be focused in the project.  
The  Without-the-Project  (WOP)  scenario  was  based  on  the  assumption  in  which  the 
productivity stayed the same as in the baseline figure (2015 district data), and the proportion 
of crop/commodity allocation in the area stayed the same as in the baseline scenario.  
Financial  prices  for  traded  agricultural  inputs  and  commodities  were  converted  to  economic 
prices  at  import  and  export  parity  prices.  The  prices  of  non-traded  goods  (including 
agricultural  labor  costs)  and  commodities  were  converted  to  economic  prices  using  a 
standard conversion factor of 1.06. The shadow  exchange rate of  BDT 77.85  to US$ 1  was 
also applied in the economic analysis.  
Project Benefits: The project intervention proposes to bring the following benefits: (1) an increase in 
irrigated  areas  and  its  effects  on  production  and  productivity  increase;  (2)  crop  diversification  from 
paddy to non-paddy higher-value crops; (3) improved technology and productivity increase; (4) value 
addition  through  improved  marketing,  post-harvest  management  and  processing;  (5)  labor  and  job 
creation from processing activities. It is expected that the above mentioned project activities will lead 
to  increased  farm  level  income  for  beneficiaries,  and  this  increase  is  attributed  to  per  plot  yield 
increase  for  the  agricultural  production,  increase  in  value-addition  through  production,  post-harvest 
handling, and processing.  
Irrigated Area Expansion: One of the major sources of expected benefits is an expansion of irrigated 
areas  generated  from  modernizing  and  improving  water  management  systems.  The  project  targets 
180,000  ha  of  improved  areas  in  water  management  with  250,000  cumulative  households  who  are 
participating in this project. Besides the improvements in physical  infrastructure, water management 
and participatory water management improve the efficiency in water use. The physical infrastructure 
and  group  formulation  will  be  spread  throughout  30  upazilas  in  11  districts  in  southern  Bangladesh. 
The phasing of group formulation, cumulative group members, and cumulative land area of the project 
are shown in Table A10.1 below.   
Table A10.1 Phasing of Water Management Investments and Group Formation (Outreach) 
Impact  on  Diversification:  The  project  proposes  crop  diversification  by  shifting  to  the  cultivation  of 
non-paddy, high-valued crops. In the current land use within the target area (which is assumed to be 
the WOP  situation),  the  area  share  for  paddy  cultivation  is  close  to  92%  of  the  total  cultivable  land

areas in the southern region. On the other hand, only 3% of the land is currently allocated to the high-
value added crops such as spices, fruits, and vegetables as shown in Table A10.2.

Table A10.3 below shows the assumed land use by crop type after the project implementation (which 
is assumed to be the With Project scenario). Around 82% of the newly irrigated areas will be used for 
paddy cultivation. It is still by far the dominant crop  being cultivated in the project area; however, the 
proportion of paddy will be reduced primarily due to diversification. On contrary, the areas for spices, 
fruits, and vegetables will increase due to the project, and most of the increase in cultivated area are 
realized for high-value added crops while the cultivated area for paddy is reduced.  
Table  A10.3  Cumulative  Cultivated  Area  Expansion  by  Crop  Type  in  the  project  (Ha)  (with 
project) 
Impact  from  Improved  Technology  and  Production  Practices:  The  project  proposes  that  adopting 
proven  technologies  such  as  hybrid  seeds,  improved  crop  varieties  and  improved  techniques  from 
extension services could increase the per hectare (or per plot) productivities in non-paddy high-value 
crops of pulses, oilseeds, spices, fruits, and vegetables.  
Table  A10.4  below  shows  the  crop  yield  differences  between  without-  and  with-project  for  19  major 
crops  in  the  southern  region.  Yield  increases  expected  from  the  project  are  accredited  to  improved 
water  use  efficiency  and  improved  technology  adopted  in  the  agriculture  practices.  The  analysis 
assumed that the yields for paddy, pulses, oilseeds, and spices increase by 30%, and yields for fruits 
and vegetables increase by 15% and 20% respectively.

Value Addition: Component 2 supports a development of various types of businesses and enterprises 
that are expected to increase values to horticulture production through better packaging and grading, 
storage,  and  processing.  Two  representative  processing  enterprises  are  assumed  in  the  analysis  to 
show positive economic impacts.  
The  economic  analysis  assumed  two  types  of  post-harvest  processing  activities  undertaken  in  the 
project,  including  vegetable  (sunflower)  oil  processing  and  fruit  pulp  processing.  These  processing 
enterprises are supported financially and technically by the project. The project allocates a USD 3.8 
million matching grant, and the project would support the establishment and financing of enterprises 
through matching grants.   
The  project  assumes  that  two  1,200  metric  tons  annum  capacity  processing  plants  of  sunflower 
(vegetable) oil are built. The proxy project cost for a plant is assumed to cost around USD 780,000. 
The total cumulative project costs for two plants equivalent will be USD 1.6 million, which include land 
and  building  machinery  and  processing  plants,  miscellaneous  fixed  assets,  and  pre-operational 
expense.  The  annual  cost  of  production  (including  a  procurement  cost  of  raw  material  –  sunflower 
seeds) and operational costs are 92% of the annual revenue from vegetable oil sales.  
The analysis also assumes that the project could support the establishment of a fruit pulp processing 
plant as a second  processing activity. It  is assumed that the project supports to build  a plant  with a 
cumulative capacity of 13,000 tons of fruit pulp per annum, and the total project cost is estimated at 
US$  1.9  million,  which  will  be  cumulatively  covered  by  the  matching  grants.  The  analysis  assumes 
that  the  project  costs  include  land  development,  civil  work,  machinery  and  processing  plant, 
miscellaneous fixed assets, and pre-operational expenses. The annual cost of production (including a 
procurement cost of raw material  – mango and guava) and operational costs are 67% of the annual 
revenue from fruit pulp sales.  
The  economic  benefits  of  both  vegetable  oil  and  fruit  pulp  processing  activities  are  derived  from  20

Labor and Job Creation: Through the agri-business enterprises established  under this project, agro-
processing enterprises could create additional jobs besides farming. The analysis assumed that two 
processing activities (vegetable oil and pulp processing) could create around 263,000 working days at 
full capacity (as shown in Table A10.5), which equivalent to around 1,300 jobs is potentially created 
from these activities annually.

Project Costs  
The  project  is  scheduled  to  commence  its  implementation  in  2018  at  the  earliest,  and  the  project 
implementation is scheduled to complete in 2023. The duration of the project implementation will be 6 
years.  The  total  project  cost  was  estimated  in  constant  price  in  Bangladesh  in  Dec  2017.  The  price 
contingency  was  projected  based  on  the  international  and  domestic  inflation  rates  over  the  project 
implementation  period.  Economic  investment  costs  are  detailed  in  Table  A10.6  extracted  from  the 
costab.

Financial Analysis 
Financial analysis was conducted for 19 agricultural crops, including paddy, pulses (mung bean and 
grass pea), oilseed (sunflower), spices (garlic and turmeric), fruits (mango, sapota, hogplum, guava, 
and  watermelon), and vegetables (pumpkin, eggplant, okra, ridge gourd, bitter gourd, arum, tomato, 
and country bean).

As shown in Table A10.4, yield increases for each crop are assumed from the project. Based on the 
productivity change, per plot based net financial benefit for each crop was calculated. Using constant 
prices  from  2015,  the  comparative  results  of  without-  and  with-project  scenarios  for  output,  gross 
margin, net profit, return to family labor, and return to labor for each crop are shown in Tables A10.7,

From these tables, it is clear that fruit crops earn the highest profit margin and returns to labor, which 
are followed by the vegetable crops.  On the other hand, pulses (mung bean and grass pea) has the 
lowest  gross  margin  and  net  profit  among  all  the  crop  types,  and  the  returns  to  labor  are  also  the 
lowest of all. In fact, both gross margin and net profits for pulses are negative even after the project 
and a  higher  yield increase is necessary for pulses to receive even  a  positive return. The dominant 
crop, paddy, also has a very low margin. Even after the yield growth from water use efficiency, the net 
profit  is  only  around  USD  100  per  year.  This  proves  and  justifies  the  project  and  the  public  sector 
financing  to  promote  high-value  added  crops  such  as  fruits  and  vegetables  as  well  as  oilseeds  and 
spices.  
Economic Analysis   
The project aims not only to increase the productivity and production of higher-value crops but also to 
establish  community  groups  and  farmer  producer  organizations  to  bring  value  added  activities  such

partnership  to  bring  incremental  benefits  through  better  aggregation  and  distribution  channels  and 
receive higher prices for agriculture produce and provide matching grants to increase value addition 
(e.g., post-harvest management and processing) to the southern region of Bangladesh.  
In  the  analysis,  the  main  incremental  benefits  were  derived  from  the  following:  (1)  increased 
production  and  productivity  of  high  value-added  crops  (non-paddy  crops);  (2)  improved  agricultural 
technology  and  practices  that  increase  productivity;  (3)  improved  water  security  for  agricultural 
production to reduce water availability risk due to salinization and seasonal fluctuation; (4) improved 
marketing,  post-harvest  management,  and  value  addition  (agro-processing);  (5)  labor  and  job 
creation.   
The economic analysis attempts to quantify the economic benefits resulting from Sub-Component 1.3: 
Institutional Support for Research and Extension, Sub-Component 2.2: Post-Harvest and Processing 
Investment,  Sub-Component  3.1:  Sustainable  Surface  Water  Management,  Drainage,  Conservation 
and Utilization. No economic benefits were calculated for Sub-Component 1.1 and 1.2 as well as 2.1 
and  2.3.  Sub-Component  3.2  and  Component  4  were  also  not  considered  for  the  economic  benefit 
calculation  even  though  these  were  included  in  the  economic  cost  side  of  the  project’s  economic 
analysis.  These  sub-components  and  component,  which  were  excluded  from  the  economic  benefit 
calculation, are considered pre-conditions for the effective implementation of the project.  
The financial prices for traded agricultural inputs and outputs, including paddy, phosphate (Trisodium 
Phosphate:TSP), potash (Muriate of Potash:MOP), and nitrogen (urea), were converted to economic 
prices at import and export parity prices. The prices of other crops and inputs (including  agricultural 
labor  costs)  for  which  the  world  reference  prices  were  not  available  were  converted  to  economic 
prices  using  the  standard  conversion  factor  of  1.06.  The  financial  total  project  costs  were  also 
converted to economic costs. The analysis was carried for a 20 year period with 2015 constant prices, 
and a project implementation period of 6 years.   
By  incorporating  the  surface  water  management  (Component  3)  and  crop  diversification  (enhanced 
production  of  high-value  crops)  and  productivity  increase  (Component  1),  incremental  benefits  for 
each crop category (paddy, pulse, oilseeds, spices, fruits, and vegetables) are shown in Table A10.10 
below. Paddy still brings the biggest contributions to the incremental benefits; however, the share of 
contribution is reduced due to diversification. 
The large contribution of paddy to the benefits  is attributed to still a large cultivable area of paddy in 
the  southern  region.  Despite  the  smaller  gross  margin  and  net  profit  derived  from  paddy,  the 
cultivable  land  is  still  dominated  by  paddy  production  even  after  the  diversification  effects  of 
encouraging  non-paddy  high-value  crops.  The  diversification  effects  are  also  shown  in  the  table 
where  fruits,  spices,  and  vegetables  have  higher  incremental  benefits  than  the  status-quo  scenario 
where paddy dominates more than 90% of the cultivable land as shown earlier in Table A10.2.

The following  two  tables  show  the  incremental  benefits  derived  from  the  Sub-Component  2.2:  Post-
Harvest  and  Processing  Investment.  The  first  table  (Table  A10.11)  shows  the  incremental  benefits 
from  the  agro-processing  activities,  including  vegetable  oil  and  fruit  pulp  processing.  Assuming,  the 
construction  of  the  vegetable  oil  and  fruit  pulp  processing  plants  start  at  the  4th  and  5th  years 
respectively, the activities start generating incremental benefits at the 6th year and increase gradually 
and peak from the 10th year onward. Relative to the impacts from diversification, productivity increase, 
and  improved  surface  water  management,  the  incremental  benefits  derived  from  the  processing 
activities are small; however, it is still a significant contribution to the overall incremental benefits.   
Table A10.11 Incremental Benefits from Post-Harvest and Processing Investment 
Table  A10.12  shows  the  incremental  benefits  from  the  labor  and  job  creation  from  the  processing 
activities.  Incremental  benefits  from  job  creation  start  generating  at  the  5th  year  in  the  analysis,  and 
the  peak  from  the  8th  year  onward.  As  in  the  processing  activities,  the  benefits  derived  from  job 
creation  are  not  as  large  as  the  benefits  from  diversification  and  productivity  effects  in  agriculture 
production, but it is still a significant amount to be added to the overall economic benefits.

After incorporating all the incremental benefits derived from three different sources and overall project 
costs,  the  overall  Economic  Internal  Rate  of  Return  (IRR)  was  estimated  at  16%  for  the  base  case 
scenario, and Net Present Value (NPV) was around BDT 2,482 million at a discount rate of 10%.

44 The NPV is a very concise performance indicator of an investment project: it represents the present amount of the net benefits (i.e. incremental benefits 
less incremental costs) flow generated by the investment expressed in AFA (a single value with the same unit of measurement used in the accounting 
tables). The Net Present Value is the sum of a 20 year discounted net cash flows.   
45 IRR is defined as the discount rate that zeroes out the net present value of flows of costs and net present value of flows of benefits of an investment. 
The IRR was computed using incremental net benefits streams for 20 year period. As IRR rankings can be misleading, and given that the informational 
requirements for computing a proper NPV and IRR are the same except for the discount rate, it is always worth calculating the NPV of a project. There are 
many reasons in favour of the NPV decision rule (see Lev, 2007).

Sensitivity Analysis 
Sensitivity  analysis: Sensitivity analysis of the project performance indicators has been carried out 
in  order  to  test  the  robustness  of  project  investments  and  benefits  streams.  Impact  of  increases  in 
costs and decline in benefits assessed at varying stages indicates that the project is more sensitive to 
decline  in  benefits  than  increases  to  costs.  If  all  benefits  are  delayed  by  two  years  (in  effect,  if  the 
project’s production activities take longer to become established) then the IRR declines to 12% with a 
NPV of 1,161 million BDT discounted at 10% and the base case BCR declines to 1.14. The sensitivity 
analysis  of  BCR  indicates  that  the  project  is  more  sensitive  to  decline  in  project  benefits  than 
increases in costs. 
Switching value analysis: Switching values47 indicate that the investments are worthy even if costs 
increased by 30% or the benefits declined by 23%.  
Summing  up:  Sensitivity  analysis  confirms  that  the  Project  remains  viable  both  to  decreases  in 
benefits and increases in costs. None the less, the project is more sensitive to decline in benefits than 
increases  in  costs.  Decrease  in  benefits  may  be  brought  about  by  a  decline  in  output  prices,  or  a 
failure  in  achieving  projected  yields  or  outputs.  It  is  noted  that  the  project  area  often  experiences 
natural  calamities  and  also  crop  damages  due  to  cyclones  and  storms  and  therefore  there  are 
possibilities of decline in benefits happening more often than assumed.     
As the proposed investments are targeted at households that are most vulnerable, who are extremely 
poor  living  in  the  remote  area  locations  that  are  devoid  of  access  to  good  communication,  road 
network, markets, agricultural support services, health services, community infrastructure etc and the 
hardships experienced by them in particular the women, the resulting IRR under extreme scenario is 
more than justified. 
The project is economically  robust  even  with  delays in flow of benefits  by  2  years, unexpected cost 
overruns of 30%, and reduction of benefits at 23% of the base level. The key lesson is  that changes 
to  the  benefit  side  of  the  project  are  more  sensitive  than  changes  to  the  cost  side.  Maintaining 
benefits of at least around 67% of the base case, or allowing no more than 4 to 5  years of delay of 
benefits to take place, or a cost increase of less than 30% are crucial for this project to have a hurdle 
rate of 10% economic return.  
In  order  to  avoid  the  potential  benefit  losses,  maintaining  high  productivity  in  HVCs  is  absolutely 
essential;  given  a  constant  price,  the  areas  of  cultivation  for  HVCs  could  bring  higher  incremental 
benefits to the project. Currently, the cultivated land under paddy is too dominant, and maintaining the 
current  rate  of  paddy  production  (the  status  quo  scenarios)  with  gross  margin  and  net  profit  could 
bring small economic returns to the farmers. In order to increase the robustness of the project further, 
fruit and  vegetable  products play  a crucial role, and  these crops could bring  a  higher income to the 
farmers and the key success of this project.  
46 BCR is independent of the size of the investment and it does not generate ambiguous cases and for this reason it can complement the NPV in ranking 
projects where budget constraints apply.  Being a ratio, the indicator does not consider the total amount of net benefits and therefore the ranking can 
reward more projects that contribute less to the overall increase in public welfare 
47 Switching values are yet another measure of sensitivity analysis They demonstrate by how much a variable would have to fall (if it is a benefit) or rise (if 
it is a cost) to make it not worth undertaking an option.

I. 
Food safety and nutrition context   
1. 
The Smallholder Agricultural Competitiveness Project (SACP)  concept and design is based 
on developing high value crops in southern districts of Bangladesh. The project takes farmer groups 
as its entry point for support to enhance production and value chain development in the project areas. 
SACP  will  focus  on  strengthening  agriculture  competitiveness,  enhancing  sustainable  technical 
support services/facilities, identification of market opportunities and linking these to applied research, 
development  and  extension  to  support  small  farmers,  improving  access  to  income  opportunities  of 
high  value  crops  through  multi-stakeholder  platforms,  developing  market  linkages,  and  supporting 
individual  and  group  organizational  capacity  to  participate  in  agricultural  value  chains.  It  will  also 
promote  increased  consumption  of  high  value  crops  (HVC)  on  beneficiary  farms  to  improve 
household’s  diets  and  nutrition.  SACP  will  enhance  production  quantity  and  quality  through 
appropriate  productive  infrastructures,  quality  agriculture  inputs  and  training  of  farmers  and  value 
chain actors, as well as, linking farmers and their groups to private dealers and traders to boost fair 
contract  farming  and  postharvest  and  processing  contracts.  Agriculture  remains  fundamentally 
important to the country’s prosperity.  Agriculture occupies three-quarters of the scarce land space of 
Bangladesh and supports the livelihoods of the majority of the population. To this end, food safety and 
nutrition is a high priority on the Bangladesh national agenda. 
2. 
As  a  lower  middle-income  country  with  high—but  declining  rates  of  poverty  among  its  160 
million people, nutrition problems remain a challenge.  Sustained economic growth is fundamental to 
this reduction and improving nutrition contributes to productivity, economic development, and poverty 
reduction  by  improving  work  capacity,  cognitive  development  and  health.  Despite  the  significant 
economic  development  in  Bangladesh,  approximately  a  quarter  of  the  population  is  unable  to  avail 
safe and nutritious food.  Food safety and hygiene impact the diets that people consume which in turn 
affect  the  delivery  on  nutrition  outcomes.    There  is  need  to  strengthen  food  and  nutrition  security 
through improved food safety  and reduced  incidence of food-borne illness within the  population and 
strengthened  stakeholder  involvement  and  coordination  leading  to  enhanced  trade  in  selected  food 
commodities.  
3. 
Remarkable  progress  has  been  made  in  increasing  production  of  rice  since  1971  by  three 
folds,  from  10  million  tonnes  to  over  34.5  million  tonnes  in  2014/15,  which  has  contributed  to  self-
sufficiency  in  food  grains.  Production  of  rice,  wheat,  maize,  potato,  pulses  and  edible  oilseeds 
increased by 8.6%, 49.6%, 156.1%, 16.7%, 71.0%, and 44.0% respectively, from 2009/10 to 2014/15.  
Households  in  Bangladesh  are  also  seen  to  be  slowly  changing  their  diets,  and  are  consuming  a 
broader  range  of  foods,  with  an  increasing  share  of  calories  coming  from  vegetables,  fruits,  and 
animal source foods; however, the consumption rates of these foods are far below the recommended 
amounts.    Food  consumption  remains  heavily  centred  on  cereals,  with  rice  alone  providing  around 
three fourth of the energy intake.  
According  to  the  Bangladesh  Demographic  and  Health  Survey 48 ,  prevalence  of  child 
4. 
underweight was 32.6% in 2014, a decline by half of the 2000 levels.  However, selected districts in 
the Southern region still show child underweight levels as high as 37% with child stunting in the South 
ranging  from  30%  to  40%.    These  prevalence  rates  are  very  high  as  per  the  World  Health 
Organization (WHO) thresholds of public health significance.  
5. 
Under  the  FAO  Country  Programming  Framework  (2014-2018),  improving  the  market 
linkages,  value  addition,  and  quality  and  safety  of  the  food  system  has  been  marked  as  one  of  the 
48 Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (2014 BDHS).

priority  areas  of  FAO’s  support  in  Bangladesh.    As  part  of  promoting  food-based  nutrition,  FAO  has 
been providing technical support to ministries of agriculture, fisheries and livestock, health, academia 
and  nutrition  training  as  well  as  research  institutions  on  developing  and  promoting  nutrient-dense 
recipes  incorporating  a  diversity  of  foods  and  local  ingredients.    Horticulture,  pulse  and  fish  based 
recipes adapted to the  local taste and cultures have  been developed over the last ten  years. These 
contribute to enhance the quality of protein and micronutrient content of the diets and meals. With the 
food-  to-  food  enrichment  methods,  appropriate  food  combinations,  safe  and  healthy  cooking 
practices that are used, variety, nutrient density, hygienic quality, safety and acceptability of the food 
preparations are enhanced.  
6. 
A  three-year  integrated  agriculture  and  health  based  intervention  (IAHBI)  implemented  by 
the  Ministries  of  Livestock  and  Fisheries,  and  Health  and  Family  Welfare  among  50,000  rural  poor 
households  in  selected  districts  of  the  South  demonstrated  decline  in  child  and  women’s 
undernutrition from baseline (2013) to end line (2016) periods49. At the end of the project, underweight 
showed marked decline ( 23.9 % to 30.6%), there was marginal decline in stunting (34.4 % to 33.5%) 
and  small  decrease  in  wasting  (  11.4%  to  9.35)   Anemia  and  chronic  energy  deficiency  in  pregnant 
and  lactating  women  also  showed  decline.  The  intervention  focused  on  integrated  household 
agriculture  production  and  nutrition  education  linked  with  health  based  nutrition  services  targeting 
pregnant and lactating mothers, reproductive age women and children under five years of age in rural 
poor households of 10 unions covering 3 districts in the South.   
7. 
Evaluation findings showed increased consumption of diversified agricultural products by the 
participating  households,  in  addition  to  income  earned  by  selling  surplus  agricultural  produce  in  the 
markets. Training on homestead food production was integrated with nutrition components. There was 
an increase in dietary diversity of pregnant women and lactating mothers, with the lactating mothers’ 
mean dietary diversity score from a total of 9 food groups increased to 4.9 from 3.7 whereas that of 
pregnant mothers had increased from 3.7 to 5.1.  Evaluation of the intervention  highlighted the need 
for a mechanism to promote dietary diversity, outside the limited time span of a project, and for it to 
become  a  regular  activity  of  extension  and  health  professionals.    Then  extension  services  are 
particularly well-placed as they can advise on food production practices and nutrition messages which 
can provide the required diversity.

Proposed objective and activities to enhance the dietary and nutrition 
impact of the Small holder agriculture competitiveness project (SACP) 
Sub component 2.3: Development of food safety and nutrition measures along the 
value chain  
8. 
The  objective  of  this  subcomponent  is  to  promote  nutrition  sensitive  value  chains  and 
products  and  thereby  enhance  the  consumption  of  safe  and  diversified  diet  for  households,  women 
and young children. DAE will act as the lead agency through collaboration with Bangladesh Institute of 
Research and Training in Applied Nutrition (BIRTAN), and BARI.  
9. 
Food safety and nutrition training of trainers - FAO, following needed studies, will contribute 
to the development of training manual on quality and food safety management systems and provide 
ToT to the selected resource persons of the agencies mentioned above. These resources persons will 
ultimately roll-out the training of trainers at the district, Upazila and community level.  
10. 
Training of trainers on community based safe food processing - Following the ToTs received, 
SAAOs  will  provide  training  to  farmer  group  leaders,  women  farmer  groups  and  relevant  agro-
processors selected for matching grants on processing of micronutrient rich fruits and vegetables. The 
training will strengthen capacities on the use of simple hand operated/mechanised equipment to carry 
out processing and preservation activities (e.g. food products widely consumed in Bangladesh, seed 
cleaning,  blanching,  drying,  pulping,  juice  extraction,  pickling,  chutney  and  sauce  making,  bottling,

for value addition, income and nutrition. 
11. 
Training  on  product  and  nutrient  labelling:  Selected  district  and  Upazila  level  officials  and 
related food processors will be provided ToTs on product labelling and relevant nutrient information on 
horticulture  products  (in  Bangla  language)  to  provide  knowledge  on  nutrient  composition  of  foods, 
make  informed  food  choices  and  enhance  household  nutritional  behaviour,  who  in  turn  will  train  the 
farmers.   
12. 
Behavioural  change  campaign:  Every  year  a  2-day  behavioural  change  campaigns  on 
National Food Safety and Agriculture Days will be carried out for enhancing horticulture consumption 
for  women  farmers  specifically  resource  poor  women  to  ensure  increased  demand  of  micronutrient 
rich  fruits  and  vegetables  by  improving  shelf  life  of  the  horticulture  produce  and  increasing 
consumption  and  diversity  of  micronutrient  rich  foods  in  the  diet  for  better  nutrition.  DAE,  being  the 
lead  agency,  will engage  DAM to ensure  active participation of large agro-processors (with some of 
whom DAM already signed agreement under subcomponent 2.1) in this campaign.

A sum of USD 3.0 million (excluding all taxes) out of  overall SACP loan and Grant  will be set 
1. 
out  and  used  for  Technical  Assistance  (TA)  by  FAO  to  the  SACP  Project  Office  and  implementing 
agencies. The TA will be administered, managed and implemented by FAO Bangladesh in agreement 
with  the  Project  Director,  SACP  with  support  from  FAO  Country  Office  and  technical  units  in  the 
Region and from the FAO headquarters, Rome.  
2. 
The TA component will provide technical assistance and capacity building targeted at specific 
areas  that  will  benefit  from  strengthening  among  government  project  implementation  partners.  TA 
activities will concentrate on: a) training of trainer’s activities and follow-up coaching, b) assisting the 
development of a benefit M&E system and C) support to background studies.  
Because of the nature of the TA activities, the TA input is foreseen to have a duration of four 
3. 
years, whereas the SACP is foreseen to be implemented over a six-year period. 
4. 
Expected  Outcome:  The  capacity  of  implementing  agencies  has  been  strengthened  to 
successfully  implement  the  Smallholder  Agriculture  Competitiveness  Project  and  reach 
expected SACP results.

project  office  in  conducting  value  chain  studies  for  the  selection  of  high  value  crops.  First  a  broad 
study  of  general  market  developments  and  production  potential  in  the  project  districts  will  be 
conducted.  After  pre-selection  of  HVCs,  detailed  value  chain  studies  will  be  conducted  that  will  be 
used to determine research priorities and fine-tune other project activities. These detailed studies will 
also explore the opportunities for regional branding. It is expected the  PO will contract these studies 
out.  The  TA  team  will  support  by  providing  advice  on  the  terms  of  reference  of  the  studies,  by 
reviewing research proposals and by reviewing the study reports for quality assurance. 
As markets change, after some time, the value chain studies should be updated. It is expected 
6. 
that this will be done by MoA (e.g. DAM), with coaching from FAO VC expert.  
Market-led  Farmer  Field  Schools  (SACP  sub-component  1.1).  The  market-led  Farmer  Field 
7. 
School  (FFS)  approach  will  build  on  previous  MoA  experience  with  FFS  programme  such  as  the 
DANIDA FFS Programmei and the IAPP Livelihood Field Schools.  
Market-led  FFS  curricula  will  be  developed  for  the  chosen  HVC.  The  TA  project  will  train  30 
8. 
master trainers (1 per upazila) over a three-month period. The SACP project office will then take over 
to train the SAAOs and farmer facilitators, with continued technical advice from the FAO FFS expert. 
9. 
If  experienced  FFS  facilitators  are  present  in  the  selected  unions,  they  can  be  selected  to 
receive  refresher  training,  adding  elements  of  the  market-led  approach  and  new  production 
techniques of the selected HVCs.  
10.  Market-led elements of the FFS will include: 
-  Private  sector  involvement:  identified  buyers  and  input  suppliers  will  be  invited  to  contribute 
their  knowledge  on  market  requirements,  seasonal  price  fluctuations  and  terms  of  payment 
for the FFS curriculum, and inviting input suppliers and buyers to key sessions will become a 
standard feature of market-led FFs. 
-  Financial literacy: sensitize farmers on costs and benefits of bank account, how to read bank 
statements, cost of credit etc.

-  Gross  margin  analysis  of  production.  It  is  a  standard  feature  of  the  FFS  methodology  to 
compare  the  profitability  of  the  farmer  technology  plot  with  the  new  technologies  plot,  but 
unfortunately  this  financial  analysis  if  often  omitted.  In  the  SACP  market-led  FFS  master 
trainer and facilitator trainer programme a lot of attention will be given to the record keeping 
and profit analysis to ensure this exercise is properly carried out.  
-  Farmer walking the chain exercise (see component 2.1) 
-  Using market information for production planning 
-  Cropping techniques will include: Agro-ecosystem Analysis (AESA), integrated crop and pest 
management,  crop  rotation,  fertilizer  and  chemical  application,  soil  management,  irrigation 
and water management and climate smart agriculture.  
In  addition,  the  FFS  programme  will  include  information  on  nutritional  aspects  of  HVC  and 
11. 
touch upon the challenges of climate change and other forms of threats to agriculture livelihoods. 
12.  Development of benefit M&E system (SACP sub-component 1.3) FAO will support the design of 
the SACP benefit Monitoring and Evaluation system. The benefit M&E and knowledge management 
system will be designed to also record and share challenges, best practices and lessons learnt. The 
benefit  M&E  system may  also  include  a  scoring  card  methodology  for  farmer  group  assessment  on 
key project indicators.  
13.  FAO will assist the PO in evaluating different software packages and applications for easy data 
collection and analysis for the benefit M&E system. One possibility could be FAO Collect Earth open 
source software and Collect application which offers opportunities to include geospatial analysis and 
visual mapping of data and for which the software can be downloaded for free.  
14.  Whichever  software  package  is  chosen,  it  would  need  to  be  adapted  to  the  Bangladesh  and 
SACP  context,  especially  the  user  interface.  Field  survey  questionnaires,  for  which  answers  can  be 
collected on hand-held devices will be developed and tested in collaboration with SACP implementing 
agencies.  Selected  PO  staff  will  be  trained  to  take  over  the  IT  support  once  the  system  is  up  and 
running. 
15.  FAO will train those responsible for project M&E at national, district and upazila level on benefit 
M&E and Knowledge Management, the use of handheld devices for data collection and data analysis 
and reporting (3 ToT sessions). Subsequently, FAO M&E experts will coach the project M&E team in 
the training of agency field staff involved in data collection to use the system. A lesson learning-cum-
refresher  training  will  be  organized  in  the  second  year  to  address  any  issues  that  may  have  arisen 
during the first year. 
16.  Options  will  be  explored  to  link  the  benefit  M&E  system  with  the  project  management  M&E 
system  (which  will  be  in  line  with  IFAD’s  revised  results  and  impact  management  system  (RIMS)). 
Such linkage will avoid duplication of data collection and improve the possibility of attribution of results 
to project activities.

Activities under output 2 
18.  Buyer  mapping  (SACP  subcomponent  2.1)  Under  Subcomponent  2.1  specific  buyers  that  are 
willing to buy the selected HVC from smallholder farmers will be identified by SACP so that they may 
be invited to contribute to the market-led FFS programme and the training programmes on marketing 
and  post-harvest  handling.  Buyers  may  be  agents  from  national  agribusiness  companies  (large 
trading  companies,  processors,  exporters,  restaurant  chains  etc.)  or  local  wholesalers  or  local 
independent small traders. For the district multi-stakeholder platforms, representative buyers at district 
level need to be identified. 
19.  FAO  will  work  with  PO  staff  to  establish  criteria  for  buyer  selection  (e.g.  minimum  volume 
traded,  willingness  to  adapt  buying  practices  to  procure  from  smallholders  and  willingness  to  work 
with  the  SACP).  FAO  will  subsequently  train  DAM  district  staff  and  upazila  marketing  facilitators  on 
the  buyer  mapping  methodology,  including  a  rapid  assessment  of  buyer’s  business  models  that  will 
allow an assessment of whether they fulfil those criteria. These business model assessments will also 
provide better understanding of buyer requirements with regard quality, regularity of supply, minimum 
volumes, terms of payment etc.  
20.  After the ToT the FAO expert will coach the DAM staff to conduct the buyer assessment. 
21.  Marketing facilitation (SACP sub-component 2.1) The TA team, in collaboration with DAM, will 
develop a training manual on market facilitation techniques. Subsequently, FAO will train DAM district 
officers and upazila level marketing facilitators engaged by SACP (total of 3 training workshops). For 
some of the training sessions, private sector (buyers and input suppliers) will be invited.  
22.  Modules of this training will include: 
- 
Increasing  competitiveness  through  sound  operational  management:  production  planning, 
logistics, storage management 
-  Marketing: concept of market segments, market analysis including a “farmer walk the chain” 
exercise;  marketing  plan  (4  Ps);  developing  longer  term  business  partnerships  including 
facilitating business meetings between farmer groups and buyers  
-  Basic  financial  management  for  commercial  farming:  bookkeeping,  cost  benefit  analysis, 
economies of scale, cash flow and working capital, sources of funding 
-  Potential  roles  of  farmer  organizations  in  HVC  value  chains  and  group  management  for

coach the DAM officers for their training of field officers (either SAAOs or lead farmers, to be decided 
by the SACP PD), who in turn will train the farmers. 
24.  Training  of  trainers  on  post-harvest  handling  and  primary  processing  (SACP  subcomponent 
2.2)  FAO  will  contribute  to  the  development  of  the  training  manuals  on  harvesting,  post-harvest 
handling, storage and processing. The manuals will in first instance be developed based on existing 
knowledge,  but  will  later  be  updated  to  incorporate  research  results  as  they  become  available  from 
the SACP component 1. 
25.  The  technical  content  will  include  the  practical  aspects  of  maturity  indexes,  harvest  time  and 
harvesting methods, use of harvesting tools, crates and field transportation trolleys, washing, grading, 
sorting,  packaging  (according  to  buyers’  needs),  storage  and  transport,  hygiene  and  food  safety, 
quality assurance. Separate manuals may be developed for perishable and non-perishable crops, or 
per HVC as the case may be.  
In collaboration with DAM and BARI, the training will also include use and maintenance of post-
26. 
harvest equipment, which may include threshers (for pulses), solar dryers, hybrid dryer, grain sheller, 
storage  silo  and  ZEEC  (final  selection  will  be  made  depending  on  the  selected  HVC  and  buyer 
needs).  
27.  When  the  manuals  are  finished  FAO  will  train  and  coach  agency  district  and  upazila  level 
marketing facilitators engaged by the SACP (total of 3 ToT workshops and 3 refresher ToTs). 
28.  Matching grant modalities (SACP sub-component 2.2) FAO will support the SACP PO to design 
matching grant implementation modalities for investments in storage infrastructure, post-harvest and 
processing  equipment  at  farmer,  farmer  group  and  rural  entrepreneur  level.  This  will  include  the 
application  process,  for  which  it  is  envisioned  that  applicants  will  need  to  submit  a  business  plan. 
Eligibility  criteria  will  be  determined,  including  indicators  for  financial  feasibility  of  the  proposed 
investment, as evidenced by the business plan.  
29.  FAO  will  support  a  study  to  assess  the  best  ownership  and  management  modalities  (e.g.  by 
private  entrepreneurs,  by  farmer  umbrella  organizations  or  by  public  entities)  for  the  planned 
Upazila/union  level  commodity  and  marketing  centres.  FAO  will  support  the  PO  by  advising  on  the 
terms of reference for the study, reviewing technical proposals and quality review of the study report. 
30.  ToT on RuralInvest module 2 (SACP sub-component 2.2) At some point in the matching grant 
application  process,  the  applicants  will  have  to  develop  a  simple  business  plan  that  shows  the 
profitable use of the equipment or storage infrastructure to be installed, and project staff will have to 
evaluate those plans.  
31.  FAO proposes to use RuralInvest, both to guide the business plan development as well as to 
facilitate  the  evaluation  of  proposals.  RuralInvest  is  a  participatory  approach  for  preparing  rural 
investment plans. RuralInvest is a free multilingual methodology and toolkit designed to help with the 
preparation  of  sustainable  agricultural  and  rural  investment  projects  and  business  plans.  It  is 
participatory,  interactive,  bottom-up  and  decentralized  way,  involving  communities,  entrepreneurs, 
government field technicians and project staff.  
32.  Any agency, project, organization or private institution managing funds or mobilizing resources 
for  small-  and  medium-scale  agricultural  and  rural  investment  can  apply  RuralInvest  to  develop 
income-generating  projects  in  agriculture,  livestock,  fisheries,  forestry,  agro-industries,  transport 
services, retail stores, wholesale services, storage services, etc. 
33.  Advantages of RuralInvest: 
- 
- 
free toolkit available; 
participatory  and  interactive  approach  involving  all  stakeholders  in  project  development  and 
analysis;

guidance through each step of the project life cycle; 
user-friendly software with comprehensive help features; 
automated technical and financial calculations; and  
analytical tools that facilitate quality review and approval.  
34.  Therefore, FAO will provide a training to upazila extension officers on RuralInvest module 2 to 
develop simple business plans with a basic financial feasibility analysis  
35.  The RuralInvest methodology will guide the upazila staff how to assist applicants develop their 
business  plan  and  what  information  needs  to  be  collected  that  will  allow  the  SACP  PO  to  decide 
whether the proposal is sound. It also provides an easy methodology to determine financial feasibility. 
36.  The  standardized  outline,  investment  costs  and  financial  feasibility  analysis,  will  also  help  the 
project  management  to  compare  proposals  across  upazilas,  to  compare  profitability  of  different 
technologies and different HVCs.  
37.  FAO  will  also  train  national  and  district  level  staff  on  RuralInvest  modules  3  for  developing 
business  plans  and  financial  analysis  for  larger  scale  investments  and  on  the  investment  portfolio 
management features of RuralInvest.ii  
38.  Food safety and nutrition related studies (SACP sub-component 2.3) FAO will support studies 
on  nutrition  and  food  safety  by  providing  advice  to  the  PO  on  terms  of  reference  and  by  reviewing 
technical proposals and final study reports. Studies may include:  
- 
nutritional  contributions  of  high  value  crops,  (e.g  protein  enriched  lentils,  orange  fleshed 
sweet potato, selected micronutrient rich horticulture crops). 
-  market  requirements  for  food  safety  and  nutrition  and  related  smallholder  competiveness 
(how smallholders are at an advantage or disadvantage to fulfil these requirements); and  
- 
low-cost post-harvest techniques for nutrient conservation in selected high-value crops 
39.  Food  safety  and  nutrition  training  of  trainers  (SACP  sub-component  2.3)  To  enhance  the 
consumption of a safe and diversified diet for households, women and young children the SACP will 
develop a training programme on quality, food safety and nutrition.  
40.  FAO  will  contribute  to  the  development  of  training  manual  on  quality  and  food  safety 
management for farmers and other value chain actors. This will be followed by a 5-days centre based 
training for resource persons from agencies such as Bangladesh Institute of Research and Training in 
Applied Nutrition (BIRTAN), BARC, BARI, DAE. FAO experts and resource persons will then roll-out a 
training of trainers programme at the district and upazila level. 
41.  Training  of  trainers  on  community  based  safe  food  processing  (SACP  sub-component  2.3). 
FAO will provide technical support through training of trainers at sub national levels on processing of 
micronutrient  rich  fruits  and  vegetables.  The  training  will  strengthen  capacities  on  the  use  of  simple 
hand operated/mechanised equipment to carry  out processing and  preservation  activities (e.g. seed 
cleaning,  blanching,  drying,  pulping,  juice  extraction,  pickling,  chutney  and  sauce  making,  bottling, 
fermentation, fruit toffees, dehydrated nutrient dense vegetable mixes, fruit based yoghurt production) 
for  value  addition,  income  and  nutrition.  This  will  enhance  the  institutional  capacity  to  train 
communities to strengthen capacities, skills and empowerment of poor women and ultimately increase 
the community consumption of micronutrient rich foods. 
42.  Training  on  product  and  nutrient  labelling  (SACP  sub-component  2.3).  3-day  ToT Training  on 
product  labelling  and  relevant  nutrient  information  on  horticulture  products  (in  Bangla  language)  for 
selected  district  and  upazila  level  officials,  to  provide  knowledge  on  nutrient  composition  of  foods, 
make informed food choices and enhance household nutritional behaviour.

43.  Behavioural  change  campaign  (SACP  sub-component  2.3).  FAO  will  support  the  content 
development of 1-day behavioural change campaigns on National Food Safety and Agriculture Days 
and regular radio and TV awareness programmes for enhancing horticulture consumption for women 
farmers specifically resource poor women to ensure increased demand of micronutrient rich fruits and 
vegetables  by  improving  shelf  life  of  the  horticulture  produce  and  increasing  consumption  and 
diversity of micronutrient rich foods in the diet for better nutrition.

contribution focussed on the mobilization and training of water user groups and on low-pressure high-
efficiency 
irrigation  methods,  rainwater  harvesting,  environmental  aspects  of  surface  water 
management, salinity management and climate change effects, 
46.  After training manual development, FAO will train selected BADC officers at district and upazila 
level (total of 3 training workshops and 3 refresher training sessions). They will in turn train field staff 
(under responsibility of SACP PD). 
47.  The training manual and ToT training will include: 
-  Mobilization and formation of Water User Groups (WUGs) 
-  Training of WUGs following government participatory water management guideline 
-  Technical  skill  development  with  regard  to  low  pressure  high  efficiency  irrigation  systems 
(such as drip irrigation), use of solar power and monsoon rainwater harvesting for use during

Project description 
Introduction   
1.  Southern  region  constitutes  14  sea  facing  districts51 under  three  hydrological  regions  of 
Bangladesh – southwest, south central and south east (FAO, 2013). The region reckoned 
as the world’s largest delta exposed to diverse climatic and non-climatic stress, such as 
recurrent natural disasters, salinity, flood and water logging. Thus agriculture of the south 
is  lagging  behind  in  terms  of  cropping  intensity  which  ranges  from  100  to  169  percent, 
(varies with land type and water regime) vis-à-vis national average of 191 percent (BBS, 
2015). The coastal region occupies extends around 30% of the country and covers about 
130 Upazilas under 14 districts with 26% population of entire country.  
2. 
Investing southern agriculture has been considered as one of the highest priorities of the 
Government  of  Bangladesh  (Master  Plan  for  Agricultural  Development  in  the  Southern 
Region,  MoA-FAO,  2012).  The  Government  also  aspires  that  with  the  opening  of  the 
Padma  bridge  in  2018,  many  farmers  of  the  southern  districts  will  have  increased 
opportunities  to  sell  their  products  to  Dhaka  markets  (high  value  crops,  vegetables, 
legumes  and  fruits),  the  shortened  transit  times  will  expand  the  opportunities  for  high 
value fresh produce that is properly picked, packed and transported and where the major 
extension  agencies  of  MoA  can  play  a  significant  role  in  improving  current  cropping 
practices. On this backdrop, the Government of Bangladesh requested IFAD’s assistance 
to  partner  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  in  developing  a  project  to  support  farmers  in 
Southern  Bangladesh.  The  Smallholders  Agriculture  Competitiveness  Project  (SACP) 
thus has been designed to meet key IFAD and government priorities as articulated in the 
national policy framework for investing southern agriculture.  The project aims to support 
this  diversification  process  into  high  value  cropping  in  Southern  Bangladesh.  For  the 
purposes of this project High Value Crops (HVC), are defined as crops which have higher 
profit,  per  limiting  input,  then  high  yielding  winter  boro  rice  production;  this  therefore 
includes Flowers, Fodders, Fruits, Oilseeds, Pulses, Spices and Vegetables.  The theory 
of change is premised on a demand-driven approach to project interventions to facilitate 
strengthened  market  linkages  between  all  stakeholders  in  selected  commodity  value 
chains to deliver increased incomes. 
3.  The  project  will  support  production  enhancement,  identify  market  opportunities  for  both 
fresh  and  processed  products,  value  added  post-harvest  management,  build 
competitiveness in HVCs to move households from subsistence  farming into commercial 
farming  through  three  technical  components  supported  by  a  project  management 
51 According to Master Plan for Agricultural Development in the Southern Region, the southern region as defined is 
comprised of 14 districts of the coastal zone exposed to the Bay of Bengal. These districts are: Barguna, Barisal, Bhola, 
Jhalokathi, Patuakhali and Pirojpur districts under Barisal division; Chittagong, Cox’s Bazar, Feni, Noakhali and 
Lakhsmipur districts under Chittagong division; and Bagerhat, Khulna, Satkhira districts under Khulna division southern 
region as defined is comprised of 14 districts of the coastal zone exposed to the Bay of Bengal. The districts are: 
Barguna, Barisal, Bhola, Jhalokathi, Patuakhali and Pirojpur districts under Barisal division; Chittagong, Cox’s Bazar, 
Feni, Noakhali and Lakhsmipur districts under Chittagong division; and Bagerhat, Khulna, Satkhira districts under

and  competitiveness  in  high  value  crops  (HVC 52)  production  and  marketing  of  fresh 
and/or processed products.  
5.  Project  objective  is  to  increase  farmer  incomes  and  livelihood  through  demand-led 
productivity growth, diversification and marketing in a changing climatic condition. 
1.3  Project Scope 
6.  The  project  will  support  production  enhancement,  identify  market  opportunities  for  both 
fresh  and  processed  products,  value  added  post-harvest  management,  build 
competitiveness in HVCs to move households from subsistence farming into commercial 
farming  through  three  technical  components  supported  by  a  project  management 
component. The project also builds on the assumption that with the opening of the Padma 
bridge in 2018, many farmers of the southern districts will have increased opportunities to 
sell their products to  Dhaka markets (high  value crops, vegetables, legumes and fruits), 
the shortened transit times will expand the opportunities for high value fresh produce that 
is  properly  picked,  packed  and  transported  and  where  the  project  can  play  a  significant 
role in improving current practices. The focus will be to enhance production quantity and 
quality  through  appropriate  productive  infrastructures,  quality  agriculture  inputs  and 
training of farmers and value chain actors, as well as, linking farmers and their groups to 
private  dealers  and  traders  to  enhance  fair  contract  farming 53 and  postharvest  and 
processing contracts.  
1.4.  Project Location 
7.  The  project  will  be  implemented  in  11  districts  covering  30  upazilas  in  the  Southern 
Region  of  Bangladesh,  250  unions  will  be  selected  based  on  the  targeting  criteria.  The

Component/ Sub-component 
5. 
5.1.  Component 1: Enhanced production of HVC and technology adoption   
23.  The  objective  of  Component  1  will  be  the  identification  and  prioritisation  of  appropriate 
VCs for smallholder investment and associated key research gaps that need to be filled 
through  on-farm  and  on-station  research.    The  purpose  of  the  component  is  to  develop 
the capacities for linking farmers to markets with  enhanced production. This component 
will  support  the  testing,  evaluation  and  adoption  of  new  technologies,  agriculture  inputs 
(seeds), and management  practices by smallholder farmers to enhance their  production 
of  HVCs  that  have  identified  market  opportunities.  This  component  will  contribute  to 
developing  agricultural  competitiveness  linked  to  market  demands  by:  (i)  assessing  the 
market  demand  for  HVC  that  can  be  produced  in  the  south,  (ii)  identifying  research 
demands  in  response  to  new  cropping  systems,  new  crops  and/or  new  varieties  and 
improved post-harvest management storage options, (ii) strengthened research-extension 
and private sector service provision, and (iii) organizing producers and marketing groups 
to form greater scale and bargaining power.

24.  Implementation  strategy.  The  component  will  embrace  market-led  research,  with  sub-
Component 1.1 being implemented by trained and capacitated DAE staff at Upazila and 
Union levels and BARI at regional and greater district on-farm research stations and sub-
Component 1.2 being led by BARI.  Involvement of the private sector will be cross cutting 
and they will be involved in identification of market opportunities, support to identification 
of  the  quality  and  quantities  required  by  different  markets  and  through  input  provision, 
postharvest management and marketing linkages, as well as processing. 
Sub-component 1.1: Assessment of HVCs and group mobilization  
25.  The  starting  point  for  project  intervention  is  the  identification,  assessment  and 
prioritisation  of  HVC  value  chains.  At  start-up  a  detailed  value  chain  analysis  of 
horticultural  and  other  high  value  crops  will  be  conducted  for  final  selection  of  potential 
HVCs suitable for production in the southern delta of Bangladesh. A community process 
will identify existing groups and target farmers who are interested to invest in these HVCs. 
If new groups are needed, smallholders will be formed into collaborative Farmer Producer 
and  Marketing  (FPM)  groups,  each  with  approximately  25  households.  The  composition 
of  the  FPM  groups  will  take  into  consideration  the  planned  focus  on  women  and  youth 
and  most  marginalized  groups,  reflecting  inclusive  targeting  strategies.  Later  FPMs  that 
have developed capacities and market linkages with buyers will be federated to achieve 
economies of scale and integrated into multi-stakeholder platforms.  To reach the project 
target groups, the following activities will be implemented: 
26.  A  market-led  research  on  assessment  and  prioritization  of  HVC  value  chains  -  
Identification  of  value  chain/manageable  sub-sector  inventory  considering  the  market 
potential impact area of the project and its life time with the greatest potential for growth in 
small  enterprise  income  and  employment  will  be  assessed  during  the  inception  of  the 
project.  
27.  Village-level  assessment  and  prioritisation  of  potential  value  chains  –  After  broad  base 
selection of HVCs, village level prioritization exercise will select HVC smallholder groups. 
This will allow each group to produce potential HVC and create an economy of scale of 
both inputs needs and outputs produced by the members of groups which should attract 
private sector to sell or buy in bulk. 
28.  Identification of existing groups at the village and union level. DAE has already mobilized 
farmers  groups  under  different  projects,  so  the  first  activity  is  to  conduct  a  mapping  of 
existing groups, determine which groups can be worked with under SCAP and what level 
of  capacity  building  and  support  they  would  need.  Where  needed  SACP  will  form  new 
groups.  All  groups  will  be  mobilized  by  the  field  extension  workers  using  different 
participatory  tools  like  wealth  ranking,  social  and  resource  mapping,  membership 
profiling,  etc.  The  groups  should  be  inclusive,  considering  age  and  gender.  For  both 
already  created  and  newly  formed  groups,  it  will  be  essential  to  involve  young  farmers 
from the early mobilization phase. They will serve as catalysts to further disseminate new 
technologies and their level of ownership of the potential results  will need  to be  thought 
through the groups’ formation process.  
29.  Engagement  of  production  facilitators  –  In  each  project  union,  the  SAAOs  will  mobilize 
new  groups  and  strengthen  old  groups.  They  will  work  as  Production  Facilitator  and 
facilitate implementation of the project. 
30.  Training  of  Trainers  (ToT)  for  SAAOs  on  PRA  and  group  mobilization  –  during 
mobilization  of  farmers  into  groups,  the  extension  workers  role  would  be  facilitation,  not 
161 
Bangladesh 
Smallholders Agriculture Competitiveness Project

Appendix 13: Draft SACP Project Implementation Manual 
as  ‘doers’.  Keeping  these  principles,  the  SAAOs  will  be  trained  on  standard  tools  and 
techniques of PRA to strengthen existing groups and to mobilize new ones. The training 
will also touch upon the challenges of climate change effects and technologies to make 
communities (and farmers) more resilient to natural disasters and other forms of threats to 
agriculture livelihoods. 
31.  PRA  for  groups  formation  and  mobilization  -  this  activity  will  be  conducted  only  for  the 
mobilization of new groups where there are no groups previously mobilized by DAE or by 
other  extension  agencies.  As  mentioned  above,  the  early  involvement  of  youth  will  be 
essential to create a future driving force for new adaptive technologies.   
32.  Identification  and  prioritization  of  technology  and  research  needs  for  selected  crops  - 
Upazila  level  consultation  on  identification,  prioritization  and  selection  of  proven 
technologies will be conducted through workshops with the participation of private sector, 
extension  &  research  agencies  and  smallholder  farmers.  A  list  of  such  scalable 
technologies for southern delta proposed by the BARI is given below.

Sub-component 1.2: Demand-driven production and market-led research 
33.  Identification of action research needs will be based on the analysis and prioritisation of 
the  VC  studies,  and  the  FPM  group  needs  for  information  new  and  demanded 
technologies and on-farm mechanization etc. Some key constraints already identified are 
availability of breeder and foundation seeds of pulses, oilseeds and other HVCs, access 
to inputs, affordable mechanisation, appropriate packing materials, suitable processing or 
semi-processing  techniques  and  equipment.  To  reach  the  project  target  groups,  the 
following activities will be implemented: 
34.  Action  research  on  climate  smart  technologies  –  Action  research  on  prioritized 
technologies identified by the extension, research, private sector and smallholders will be 
conducted  by  BARI  at  its  regional  station  and  farmers.  Standard  protocol  of  action 
research will be designed by the HVC specialist of both BARI and additional consultants. 
Once  finalized,  the  manual  for  each  technology  will  be  developed  by  BARI  and  handed 
over to the DAE for wider dissemination to the farmers. The market research specific to 
the project areas will be strengthened in BARI and local relevant universities. Services of 
the consultants (including TA) will be utilized in development of research programs.   
35.  Evaluation of stress (e.g. saline, submergence  and drought) tolerant varieties  –  suitable 
HVC  varieties  already  released  by  the  BARI  will  be  evaluated  both  at  on-farm research 
field  and  by  farmers  to  assess  performance,  yield  gap,  and  soil  management.    On  farm 
research  division  of  BARI  will  be  made  involved  in  the  process  of  evaluation.  These 
efforts will be oriented in the direction of defying climate change effects. 
36.  Evaluation  of  appropriate  mechanization  options  -  The  project  will  form  a  Technical 
Committee for performance testing of appropriate machinery promoted by the importers, 
local manufacturers/traders through floating an Expression of Interest in newspapers. All 
machines  have  to  be  tested  at  BARI.  Upon  recommendations  by  the  Technical 
Committee,  appropriate  machines  and  respective  companies  will  be  enlisted  with  the 
project.  The  selected  brands  of  tested  machines  will  be  promoted  among  farmers  by 
DAE,  with  a  special  focus  on  young  farmers  who  seem  to  be  more  receptive  to  new 
machineries.  
37.  Research  on  on-farm  post-harvest  storage  and  agro-processing 
-  Postharvest 
management  (PHM)  is  another  part  of  mechanization  especially  for  HVCs.  Appropriate 
small  scale  postharvest  technology  is  needed  especially  for  HVC  clusters  across  the 
southern delta for smallholders to achieve better market outcomes. On-farm research on 
post-harvest storage and agro-processing will be conducted for vegetables, fruits, pulses, 
oil-crops especially on small scale processing machineries, through the establishment of 
common facility center at farmer groups, etc. 
38.  Multiplication  of  seeds/planting  material  of  HVCs  –  seeds  and  planting  materials  for 
prioritized HVCs will be multiplied to ensure availability among farmers. BARI will produce 
breeder  seed  and  handed  over  to  the  BADC  to  produce  foundation  seeds  to  distribute 
among farmers. Private seed operators will also be linked in the seeds supply system.  
Sub-component 1.3 Institutional support for research and extension 
39.  Institutional support will be provided to secure the quality of project implementation, such 
as improved service facilities for both extension  and  research in the forms of necessary 
infrastructure  and  equipment  (also  ensuring  environmental  conservation  and  necessary 
climate resilience enhancement), deployment of project staff, and supply  of vehicles. To 
reach the project target groups, the following activities will be implemented: 
163

Appendix 13: Draft SACP Project Implementation Manual 
Formation of implementation team at different levels by placing capable manpower; 
Development of comprehensive work and budget in line with the log-frame of the project; 
Timely procurement and efficient use of equipment and goods;  
Develop and implementation and effective monitoring system, also able to record and share 
challenges, identified best practices and lessons learnt; 
Regular and effective coordination within the implementation stakeholders at different   level 
centre to union; 
Regular follow-up of monitoring and evaluation activities; 
Proper capturing of information, documentation and reporting. 
Component Exit Strategy and Sustainability:  
40.  The component will build capacity of existing and/or new producer groups on identifying 
market  opportunities  and  identify  the  service  providers  along  the  value  chain  who  are 
needed to increase their productivity, profitability and reduce their food security risks from 
engaging more in market-led agriculture. Increased capacities in DAM and DAE staff will 
continue  to  be  applied  after  the  project  has  ended,  as  well  the  group  capacities.  These 
initial  skills  will  be  further  supported  and  sustained  through  linkages  with  other  GoB 
departments for getting registration and allied extension and marketing services and the 
private sector along the selected value chains. 
5.2.  Component 2: Processing and marketing of HVC 
41.  This  component  will  support  small  holders  to  access  market  in  a  more  efficient  manner 
through  creating  a  conducive  business  environment  for  private  sector  to  reach  them.  In 
parallel,  promising  rural  agro-enterprises  (individual  farmer,  farmer  groups  and/or  rural 
entrepreneurs)  will  be  assisted  to  add  value  to  primary  products  and  penetrate  market 
through value-added products. Besides, village-level food processing will be promoted to 
encourage  nutrition  and  food-safety  along  the  value  chains.      .   Value  addition  will  be 
through 
transport  of 
agricultural  commodities.  Activities  will  focus  on  (i) capacity  building  of  DAMs  (ii) 
developing a demand-driven extension approach within DAE and DAM and by engaging 
private  sector,  (iii)    linking  with  private  sector  buyers  (v)  developing  opportunities  for 
village-level food processing, and (vi) developing existing and potential rural enterprises’  
ability to manage sustainable rural agro-enterprises.  
improved  post-harvest  practices,  processing,  storage,  and 
42.  Implementation  Strategy  –  This  component  builds  on  value  chain  selection  and 
production  related  capacity  building  activities  for  farmers  under  Component  1  and 
therefore,  develops  farmers’  skills  on  post-production  activities  to  access  market  in  a 
more efficient and effective way. Under this component, the project will invest in reducing 
the  market  inefficiency,  especially  in  terms  of  asymmetric  information.  Through  the 
creation of the entry point and platform (farmer groups) under Component 1, the private 
sector  will  be  able  to  communicate  to  the  producers  in  a  cost-effective  way  about  their 
requirements  in  terms  of  quality  and  quantity,  price  conditions  for  different  marketable 
categories,  packing  and  packaging,  delivery  conditions.  This  will  help  reduce  the 
perception  of  additional  costs,  or  risk  of  negative  return  from  quality  and  quantity 
assurance at production level by the buyers. The lead implementer for this component is 
Department of Marketing (DAM) through collaboration with other implementing agencies. 
It  is  important  to  note  that  the  interventions/activities  under  this  component  will  be 
undertaken in parallel to those under Component 1 and Component 3 to ensure synergy

and maximization of resources. For example, a buyer may require a specific product to be 
supplied  with  certain  packaging  features  but  may  also  want  the  product  to  be  produced 
using a specific seed variety. While the former falls under post-production knowledge i.e 
under  Component  2,  the  latter  has  to  be  addressed  at  production  level  i.e.  under 
Component 1.  
Sub-component 2.1: Improving market linkage 
43.  This subcomponent focuses on improving institutional capacity of DAM to enable them to 
foster  market  linkages.  Considering  the  current  level  of  under-staffing,  30  Upazila 
Marketing Facilitator will be engaged through outsourcing in this project under DAM – one 
in each Upazila. These Upazila Marketing Facilitators will be the primary focal points for 
working  with  farmer  groups  on  market-access  and  marketing-related  aspects,  and 
collaborate  closely  with  SAAOs  in  respective  Upazilas  to  transfer  jointly  post-production 
and marketing knowledge to farmers.   
44.  Buyer mapping and assessment - DAM district level staff (3 most senior staff) and Upazila 
Marketing  Facilitators  will  be  trained  on  ‘buyers  mapping’  followed  by  assessment  of 
buyers.  While  buyer  mapping  will  identify  existing  buyers  for  selected  crops  at  different 
tiers of a value chain i.e. local traders, wholesalers, institutional buyers etc.; assessment 
of  buyers  will  help  select  most  potential  buyers  who  the  project  may  work  together  to 
enhance  farmers’  capacity  to  respond  to  market  needs.  Buyer  selection  criteria  will  be 
developed  at  PO  level  and  these  criteria  may  include  willingness  to  collaborate,  area 
coverage,  procurement  volume,  product  portfolio  dealing  with  etc.  DAM  will 
conduct/update  the  buyer  mapping  cum  assessment  once  in  every  one  year  and  a  half 
through involving district level staff, Upazilla Marketing Facilitators and also the SAAOs in 
the  targeted  areas  to  create  room  for  more  buyers  to  join  the  project  who  fulfil  the 
selection criteria. In the  whole project  period,  the project should select and  work  with at 
least 10 institutional buyers and 100 individuals for different value chain crops.   
45.  Agreements  with  buyers  -  Upon  identification  and  selection  of  buyers,  the  project  will 
enter into agreements with them delineating the roles and responsibilities of each party. 
While for institutional  buyers it  will be formal MoUs at  PO  level, for individuals  it can be 
informal  agreements  at  local  level.  The  major  role  for  the  project  is  to  prepare  farmers 
(through  both  Component  1  and  Component  2)  to  comply  with  the  agreed  upon 
requirements  of  the  buyers.  Buyers’  major  role  would  be  to  attend  relevant  training 
sessions  for  farmers  arranged  by  the  project  and  educate  them  about  their  needs.  The 
MoUs  and  informal  agreements  should  not  be  a  binding  document  for  a  guaranteed 
purchase  which  may  reduce  the  interest  among  buyers  to  collaborate.  The  rationale 
behind not having such guaranteed purchase clause are: a) through value chain selection 
under Component 1 most demanded crops are already selected which are likely to have 
high  unmet  market  demand;  b)  through  interventions  under  Component  1,  the  targeted 
farmers  are  expected  to  be  more  productive  which  means,  they  will  make  higher  profit 
even  if  they  sell  in  regular  market;  c)  buyer  mapping  and  assessment  has  already 
identified  the  demand-supply  mismatch  which  are  resolved  through  supporting  the 
farmers  and  hence,  selected  buyers  are  very  likely  to  buy  from  them.  DAM  (national, 
district) staff including their Upazila  Marketing facilitators  will initiate the negotiation  with 
interested  private  businesses  (local  traders,  regional  wholesalers,  national  companies, 
exporters etc) already identified, to educate farmers alongside SAAOs on their needs and 
requirements  and  how  to  comply  with  those.  In  the  negotiation,  the  project  will  primarily 
highlight the opportunities it will create through investment (such as farmer groups, farmer 
training  on  post-harvest  techniques  and  business  management  skills  etc)  for  private 
businesses  to  tap  and  get  access  to  those  ‘better  equipped’  farmers  and  hence,  how 
much  the  private  businesses  would  offer  to  join  in  such  investment  –  either  in  kind  or 
cash. There will be formal MoUs signed between DAM and institutional buyers delineating 
165 
Bangladesh

Appendix 13: Draft SACP Project Implementation Manual 
the  roles  and  responsibilities  of  each  party  while  with  individual  buyers,  informal 
agreements can be made at Upzilla and district level.        
46.  Business management skills development - Every farmer is an entrepreneur and like any 
other  business,  farming  also  need  operational,  marketing  and  financial  management. 
Lack  of  knowledge  of  farmers  on  these  aspects  often  make  them  inefficient  and  non-
competitive. Linking with buyers will be fruitless unless the farmers manage their farming 
efficiently and in compliance with buyers’ requirement. DAM district level staff and Upazila 
Marketing  Facilitators  will  be  trained  on  basic  business  management  skills  along  with 
Business  Development  Services  (BDS).  They  will  train  the  SAAOs  who  in  turn  will  train 
farmers  in  a  simplistic  way.  Once  the  DAM  district  level  staff  and  Upazila  Marketing 
Facilitator  become  knowledgeable  on  business  management  skills  and  BDS  (such  as 
finance,  standards,  certificates,  legal  requirements)  provisions  and  respective  providers, 
they  can  assist  not  only  farmers  but  also  rural-agro  enterprises  to  avail  different  BDSs 
through  an  informed  manner.  The  project  will  support  documentation  and  printing  of 
business  management  skills  technical  modules  as  well  as  mapping  of  BDSs  provisions 
required  for  different  agro-enterprises  so  that  these  resources  can  be  used  beyond  the 
project period.     
47.   Formation  of  multi-stakeholder  platforms  –  The  project  will  form  multi-stakeholder 
platform in each district stationed in the local Chamber of Commerce and Industry office. 
These  multi-stakeholder  platforms  will  include  Farmer  Groups,  representatives  from  the 
local  Chamber  of  Commerce  and  Industry,  local  government,  DAE  and  DAM,  research 
institutions,  agro-input  companies,  agro-processors,  transport  and  logistics  providers, 
private  sales  agents,  financial  institutions,  professional  organisations  of  the  agriculture 
sector  and  farmers.  President  of  the  Chamber  of  Commerce  and  Industry  will  chair  the 
platform.  The  role  of  these  multi-stakeholder  platforms  is  to  provide  a  forum  for  the 
discussion  of  industry  or  sector  problems  and  constraints  in  a  holistic  manner  thereby 
ensuring that the interests of all stakeholders are represented and protected. District DAM 
office will primarily assist respective Chamber of Commerce to maintain the functioning of 
the  platform. The  forum  will  sit  together  once  in  every  quarter.  The  project  will  bear  the 
costs for snacks/food and the Chamber will provide venue and  logistics support as their 
investment.  
Sub-component 2.2: Post-harvest and processing investments  
48.  This  subcomponent  materializes  enhanced  capacity  of  DAM  and  SAAOs;  and 
agreements with buyers to connect  with producers. The subcomponent also creates the 
provision  to  support  promotion  of  agro-processing  enterprises.  The  major  activities 
revolve  around  building  producers’  capacity  on  post-harvest  activities  and  primary 
processing  to  respond  to  buyers’  demand;  identifying  and  supporting  potential  agro-
processing enterprises. 
49.  Farmer  training  on  post-harvest  and  primary  processing  -  DAM  district-level  staff  and 
Upazila  Marketing  Facilitators  will  be  trained  on  post-harvest  and  primary  processing  of 
selected crops as per the need identified during the buyers’ assessment. DAM, thereafter, 
will provide such training to SAAOs, who in turn will train the farmers with the presence of 
buyers with whom agreements have been signed. Buyers (individual or institutions) must 
develop a sense of ownership on the training activities and for this reason, they should be 
consulted  and  involved  at  each  level  –  starting  from  training  module  development  till 
providing  training  to  farmers.  The  selected  buyers  are  expected  to  contribute  financially 
(may be in kind, by providing time, resource persons, venue etc.) in the training events for 
farmers  –  for  individual  buyers  cost-sharing  is  expected  to  be  at  least  10%  while  for 
institutional buyers it is 20%. 
166

Appendix 13: Draft SACP Project Implementation Manual 
50.  Promotion of agro-processing enterprises - The project will provide financial and technical 
support  to  300  agro-processing  enterprises  (to  the  individual  agripreneurs  or  producer 
groups), on average 10 from each Upazila, linked to Farmer Groups. It is envisaged that a 
particular Farmer Group may or may not propose to start or upgrade an agro-enterprise.  
Few members from one group or several groups may join together. All these options will 
remain open to select appropriate candidates to choose for project support. In this regard, 
the  project  will  design  matching  grant  implementation  modalities  for  investments  in 
promising  agro-enterprises  in  the  areas  of  storage  infrastructure,  pack-house,  post-
harvest  and  processing  equipment/machinery.  The  matching  grant  amount  will  be  on 
average  BDT  2  million  based  on  the  business  proposal  merit  and  the  grant  amount  will 
not  exceed  70%  of  the  total  investment  cost  (storage  infrastructure  and/or  machinery) 
where the rest will be borne by the entrepreneur. Investment may include multi-crop cold 
storage  infrastructure,  mechanical  dryers  for  grains  and  pulse,  mechanical  sheller  for 
grains,  grinding  machines  for  oil  seeds,  grinding  and  pellet  making  machines  for  animal 
feeds etc.  
51.  The grant amount will vary depending on the business type and size. Four multi-crop cold 
storage  facilities  (for  perishable  items  such  as  vegetables  and  fruits)  in  four  of  the 
promising districts of the project area will be supported, for each of which BDT 10 million 
would be the matching grant amount. On the other hand, a mechanical sheller for grains 
may  require  only  about  BDT  100,000  as  matching  grant  from  the  project.  Small-scale 
processing facilities such as drying and roasing of ground nuts, chanachur (local snacks), 
puffed-rice  making  etc.  which  may  require  less  amount  of  matching  grant  shall  also  be 
considered for support. It is important to note that the business proposals must come from 
the entrepreneurs (individual or group) - existing (to expand business) or potential to start 
on  what  they  have  already  experience  and  knowledge  (only  exception  for  nutrition  rich 
fruits  and  vegetables  processing  training  participants  under  Subcomponent  2.3  who  will 
get the training from the project and then can apply for the grants to start business). The 
project will provide business management skills and also assist in accessing BDSs for the 
selected entrepreneurs after winning the matching grant. Whatsoever, the total number of 
matching  grants  will  be  300  and  the  total  amount  will  be  limited  to  BDT  600  million.  In 
order  to  ensure  that  the  small  holder  farmers/entrepreneurs  are  not  excluded  from  this 
opportunity, at least 200 grants must be received by those who belong to farmer groups 
the  project  has  mobilized  including  women  members  who  will  be  trained  to  process 
micronutrient  rich  fruits  and  vegetables  (discussed  in  the  following  section).  The  overall 
implementation  will  include  an  application  process,  for  which  it  is  envisioned  that 
applicants will need to submit a business plan. It can be assumed that all applicants may 
not  have  the  capacity  to  develop  such  a  business  plan  and  DAM  district  level  and  DAE 
upazila  level  staff  will  need  to  assist  them. Technical  capacity  of  both  DAM  district  staff 
and  DAE  Upazila  staff  will  be  developed  accordingly.  The  final  selection  for  businesses 
eligible to receive the matching grants will be carried out through an evaluation process at 
PO level, in line with evaluation criteria prepared in consultation with IFAD. 
Sub-Component 2.3: Development of food safety and nutrition measures along the value 
chain  
52.  The  objective  of  this  subcomponent  is  to  promote  nutrition  sensitive  value  chains  and 
products  and  thereby  enhance  the  consumption  of  safe  and  diversified  diet  for 
households,  women  and  young  children.  DAE  will  act  as  the  lead  agency  through 
collaboration  with  Bangladesh  Institute  of  Research  and  Training  in  Applied  Nutrition 
(BIRTAN), DAM and BARI.  
Food  safety  and  nutrition  training  of  trainers  -Training  manual  on  quality  and  food  safety 
management  systems  will  be  developed  and  selected  resource  persons  of  the  agencies 
167 
Bangladesh 
Smallholders Agriculture Competitiveness Project 
Final project design report  
Appendix 13: Draft SACP Project Implementation Manual 
mentioned above will be trained. These resources persons will ultimately roll-out the training 
of trainers at the district, Upazila and community level.  
53.  Training  on  community  based  safe  food  processing  -  Following  the  ToTs  received, 
SAAOs will provide training to farmer group leaders, women farmer groups and relevant 
agro-processors  selected  for  matching  grants  on  processing  of  micronutrient  rich  fruits 
and  vegetables.  A  special  attention  shall  be  paid  to  reach  targeted  households  with 
disable  family  members  and  vulnerable  livelihood  options.  The  training  will  strengthen 
capacities  on  the  use  of  simple  hand  operated/mechanised  equipment  to  carry  out 
processing  and  preservation  activities  (e.g. 
in 
Bangladesh, seed cleaning, blanching, drying, pulping, juice extraction, pickling, chutney 
and  sauce  making,  bottling,  fermentation,  fruit  toffees,  dehydrated  nutrient  dense 
vegetable mixes, fruit based yoghurt production) for value addition, income and nutrition. 
food  products  widely  consumed 
54.  Training on product and nutrient labelling: Selected district and Upazila level officials and 
related food  processors  will  be provided ToTs on product  labelling and relevant nutrient 
information  on  horticulture  products  (in  Bangla  language)  to  provide  knowledge  on 
nutrient  composition  of  foods,  make  informed  food  choices  and  enhance  household 
nutritional behaviour, who in turn will train the farmers.   
55.  Behavioural  change  campaign:  Every  year  a  2-day  behavioural  change  campaigns  on 
National  Food  Safety  and  Agriculture  Days  will  be  carried  out  for  enhancing  horticulture 
consumption  for  women  farmers  specifically  resource  poor  women  to  ensure  increased 
demand  of  micronutrient  rich  fruits  and  vegetables  by  improving  shelf  life  of  the 
horticulture produce and increasing consumption and diversity of micronutrient rich foods 
in  the  diet  for  better  nutrition.  DAE,  being  the  lead  agency,  will  engage  DAM  to  ensure 
active  participation  of  large  agro-processors  (with  some  of  whom  DAM  already  signed 
agreement under subcomponent 2.1) in this campaign. 
56.  Component  exit  strategy  and  sustainability  –  The  subcomponent  attempts  to  address 
inefficiency of the market system where buyers do not invest time and resources to build 
the  capacity  of  small  holders  to  enable  the  latter  to  supply  their  produce  in  an  informed 
way. With the creation of the platform (the farmer groups) private sector buyers will find it 
cost-effective to reach them in sustainable way where DAM and DAE through increased 
capacity  will  assist  the  private  sector  to  educate  them.  Once  this  connection  has  been 
developed, private sector is likely to continue the direct relationship with small holders to 
continuously educate them on their needs and requirement. On the other hand, DAM with 
its  increased  capacity  to  assess  market  and  buyers  will  take  this  knowledge  forward  to 
carry  out  the  same  business  model  in  new  areas  beyond  the  project.  Agro-enterprises 
supported through matching grant will create a demand-pull for more products affecting a 
production growth of the primary commodities in the project areas. Through promotion of 
nutrition enriched processed agro-products, there will be higher demand of such products 
and new similar enterprises are likely to join the rally seeing the market opportunity. Multi-
stakeholder platform created under this component will open a new window to discuss the 
problems  of  all  the  stakeholders  in  a  single  forum,  address  them  through  collective 
actions  and  advocate  to  concerned  authority  to  create  more  conducive  business 
environment. 
5.3.  Component 3: Climate resilient surface water management 
57.  The  activities  under  component  3  will  support  households  interested  in  increasing  their 
productivity  and  diversification  to  HVCs  with  water  infrastructure  that  will  provide 
supplemental  or  full  season  water  access,  through  a  range  of  investments  in  water 
storage and provision to cropland, with associated capacity development for households 
and  groups  to  manage  this  water  infrastructure.  .    All  activities  in  this  Component  are 
derived from the work of Component 1 and 2 – the location and scale of interventions will 
168 
Bangladesh 
Smallholders Agriculture Competitiveness Project

Appendix 13: Draft SACP Project Implementation Manual 
depend  on  identified  and  prioritised  food  production  and  cash  crop  production  activities 
and their need for supplemental and full crop season irrigation. 
58.  Implementation  Strategy  -  Considering  the  experience  and  capacity  of minor  irrigation 
and  drainage  development,  the  Bangladesh  Agriculture  Development  Corporation 
(BADC)  is  proposed  to  implement  activities  under  component  3.  Most  activities  and 
services  under  Component  3.1  for  sustainable  water  management  will  be  outsourced 
through  competitive  bidding  following  government  procurement  rules.The  BADC  has  a 
well-organized irrigation division headed by Chief Engineer (GOB grade II official). Mostly 
engineering  graduates  and  diploma  engineers  are  engaged  in  the  developmental 
activities of the division. In the selected  districts,  Executive Engineers (Grade 5), will be 
overall  responsible  for  the  project  interventions.  Assistant  Engineers  (Grade  8),  sub 
Assistant  Engineers  (Grade  10)  and  mechanics/technicians  will  be  responsible  for 
implementation  of  the  activities.  The  activities  under  Component  3.2  (institutional 
support/capacity building) will be outsourced through competitive bidding. Hiring of project 
personnel  (driver  for  procured  vehicles,  support  staff)  will  be  procured  from  market 
through  outsourcing.  Some  short  term  consultancy  provisions  have  been  proposed  for 
ensuring sustainable water user groups formation and community participation in O & M 
in  line  with  the  participatory  water  management  rule,  environmental  aspects  in  water 
management. 
Sub-component 3.1 - Sustainable surface water management, drainage, conservation 
and utilization    
59.  As  the  project  activities  are  not  defined  at  this  stage,  the  following  are  a  range  of 
interventions and potential scale of interventions that have been identified by the mission 
based  on  lessons  learned  in  other  projects,  knowledge  of  the  area  and  its  production 
constraints, the focus on production and marketing of HVCs. 
60.  Crop Protection dyke - to  protect crop  land growing  HVCs against tidal flood  and heavy 
rainin low land and char areas approximately 45 km of dykes will be made.  
61.  Re-excavation  and  maintenance  of  canals-  (with  dyke  plantations)  to  provide  water  for 
irrigation and/or drainage of excess water. To be undertaken for both water conservation 
as rainwater harvesting for irrigation and drainage facility. This will be implemented in the 
areas  having  problems  of  drainage  congestion  or  tidal  flooding  causing  delays  in  crop 
establishment  and  or  irrigation  facilities  to  meet  crop  demand.  Around  300  km  of  re-
excavation will be made in suitable sites. In addition, vegetable and fruit tree cultivation at 
both  sides  of  dykes  will  be  made,  canal  water  to  be  used  for  household  consumption. 
Dykes  will  be  used  for  sheltering  of  domestic  animals  during  flood,  fishing  facilities 
created, navigation facilities improved and duck culture introduced. 
62.  Construction  of  on-farm  water  management  structures  –  (Cattle  Crossing/floating  bridge 
etc.). The small scale structure will be built in the water course and canals at farm level as 
civil works to regulate water. The tidal canals in the  project sites divide the homesteads. 
The  structures  will  be  constructed  for  crossing  the  canal  to  wider  road  and  easier 
transportation of agricultural crop, goods and farm machines. Approximately 275 sites will 
have provision of such structures.  
63.  Community pond excavation with homestead solar irrigation pump sets - for water storage 
for productive uses - This will be mostly done in the southwest part where prevalence of 
salinity  is  more.  Efficient  irrigation  system  management  for  HVC  will  be  implemented  at 
the  homestead  level.  In  addition,  solar  energy  will  be  used  for  domestic  purpose  and 
homestead vegetables. Drip system to be introduced for increasing irrigation efficiency.   
64.  Promotion  of  with  solar  irrigation  pump  sets  and  drip  irrigation-  to  maximise  water  use 
efficiency  -  Solar  energy  in  the  remote  southern  districts  is  getting  popular  for  domestic 
supply. Where feasible, solar energy (no  operating cost, thus cheaper  option for energy 
saving)  along  with  high  efficiency  drip  irrigation  system  will  be  installed  to  support  high 
169 
Bangladesh 
Smallholders Agriculture Competitiveness Project

Appendix 13: Draft SACP Project Implementation Manual 
value  crops  in  the  project  sites.    Research  institutes  may  be  involved  in  technological 
support and share experiences in installation of these high efficiency systems. Around 50 
pump sets will be installed in suitable sites  
65.  Installation  of  buried  pipe  system-  for  new  pump  and  BADC  existing  pump  (for  water 
lifting  devise  from  surface  water  sources)  for  irrigation  to  increase  irrigation  water  use 
efficiency. In continuation of similar intervention through previous projects and programs 
the  buried  pipe  system  will  be  installed.  The  activities  will  be  undertaken  in  newer 
schemes  and  in  some  cases  it  will  be  extended  to  old  schemes  to  further  increase 
command area. The system will reduce water loss thus reduce irrigation charge to almost 
half.  Buried  pipe  irrigation  system  also  saves  land  and  water  compared  to  conventional 
earthen  or  constructed  channel.  A  total  of  about  300  kilometers  of  buried  pipe  will  be 
installed including extension of existing schemes.  
66.  Provision of hose pipe for irrigation scheme- for conveyance of water to remote locations 
to extend the irrigation command area. Hose pipes will be provisioned for conveyance of 
water  to  remote  locations  which  will  increase  irrigation  area.  It  will  reduce  conveyance 
loss  and  conveniently  distribute  water,  where  needed.  Approximately  12,500  meters  of 
hose pipe will be installed in the selected project sites 
(i)  Artisan  well  installation  -  in  areas  of  the  confined  (pressurized)  aquifer  zone  in  the 
southeast part. In the southeastern part of the proposed project sites artisan aquifers 
zones  are  available  and  piezometric  surface  is  close  to  the  surface.  This  does  not 
need  abstraction  through  pumping.  Tapping  water  from  such  shallow  depth  will  be 
affordable and easy to use for irrigation. The resources will be utilized to irrigate high 
value crops of commercial importance. Around 100 suitable sites of such dug well will 
be installed.  
Installation of rainwater harvesting structures - considering acute shortages of fresh water 
during dry season rainwater harvesting will be introduced at the household level both 
for  irrigation  and  drinking  water  purpose.  During  the  project  implementation  around 
3,000 will be installed in the project duration.  
Sub-component 3.2 - Institutional support for Capacity Building 
67.  The interventions under this sub-component will address enhancing efficiency in service 
delivery of agency and relevant stakeholders. This will focus community ownership of the 
water  management  infrastructure  through  (i)  Formation,  mobilization,  training  and 
development  of  Water  User  Groups(WUGs),  following  government  participatory  water 
management  guideline,  (ii)  skill  development  of  the  agency  and  water  users  and  (iii) 
developing institutional facilities for better service delivery (office, transportation and other 
logistic support).  
68.  The  activities  proposed  are  based  on  the  assessment  of  the  existing  facilities/ 
infrastructures  in  the  proposed  project  sites.  There  are  18  offices  of  BADC  in  the 
proposed  project  areas  where  some  renovation,  construction  have  been  proposed. 
Activities under the sub-component are:   
  Renovation  of  office/training  center  in  the  project  sites  (five)  for  better  office 
technicians,  pump 
the  engineers, 
accommodation  and  pertaining 
operators/managers, water user groups (farmers) etc. 
training 
to 
  Overseas  training  for  skill  enhancement  of  relevant  engineers  and  planners  in 
efficient irrigation and drainage system design

  Seminar  and  workshop  to  monitoring,  evaluation,  review  and  consultations  for 
improved project performance 
  Printing and publication of reports, project documentations and training manuals 
69.  Component Exit Strategy and Sustainability: The proposed project includes formation 
of  WUGs  who  will  be  the  primary  beneficiaries  of  this  component.  The  capacity  of  the 
groups  will  be  enhanced  through  training  so  that  after  completion  of  the  project,  the 
groups  will  have  the  necessary  knowledge  and  skills  to  be  responsible  for  O&M  of  the 
interventions  of  the  water  management  infrastructures.  The  project  plans  to  build  the 
capacities  of  BADC  and  their  engineers,  which  after  this  initiative  will  be  able  to  better 
contribute to the development of the South and potentially cascade their knowledge and 
support  other  areas  of  Bangladesh.  In  addition,  the  work  foreseen  between  BADC 
personnel and the WUGs and communities at large will create strong linkages which will 
support any future project of this kind 
5.4.  Project management 
70.  Inter-department coordination and Project Office. 
Mechanism  and  efficiency  of 
inter-department  coordination  between  DAE,  DAM,  BADC  and  BARI  were  further 
reviewed by the mission and an  assessment of institutional capacities54 was undertaken 
in this regard based on the project background paper No 1. The mission concluded that 
the  four  agencies  are  under  the  same  MoA  and  they  had  collaborated  in  management

direction  of  a  Project  Steering  Committee  (PSC)  chaired  by  the  Secretary  of  MoA  and 
encompassing representatives from the ministries such as ERD, line departments that are 
related  to  the  Project.  The  PSC  will  evaluate  and  approve  annual  work  plans,  and 
provides directives on strategic aspects of the implementation management. 
72.  A  Project  Implementation  Committee  (PIC)  will  be  formed  to  provide  technical 
guidance  and  bring  in  synergy  with  stakeholders  and  partners  other  than  the  MoA.  The 
committee  will  be  chaired  by  the  Additional  Secretary  (PPC)  and  it  will  be  composed  of 
Project Director, Component Directorsand Project Coordinator of BARI, one PO from the 
IFAD-assisted  projects  in  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  representatives  of  the  MOA, 
Planning Commission, ERD, IMED, selected leading private firms and trade associations, 
and  IFAD  and  FAO  country  offices.  The  PIC  will  play  the  role  of  technical  exchange 
platform  and  synergy  building  among  different  development  projects,  where  good 
practices  and  lessons  learnt  can  be  drawn  to  support  the  SACP  implementation  at 
operational level, and shared for cross-benefits.

selected among farmer groups. 
74.  At  central level, the Project  Office proposed for SACP will pay special attention to the 
leading  functions  of  DAE  and  coordination  among  implementing  agencies.  The  Project 
Office will be headed by a Project Director appointed from DAE by MoA and it will include 
Component  Coordinators  from  principal  implementing  agencies  namely  DAE,  DAM  and 
BADC, and from BARI, seconded by government-deputed officers will be supported by an 
operational  support  team  of  externally  recruited  experts  whose  positions  are  funded  by 
the Project. 
75.  The PD’s responsibilities remain unchanged. 
a)  Ensure  that  the  project  strategy  is  applied  through  the  implementation  of  all 
activities,

from  the  involved  implementing  agencies,  maintain  district  consolidate  records,  prepare 
reports and deliver them to the Project Office. Other responsibilities include: 
a)  Overseeing work of executing agencies and service providers and the selection of the 
target groups that will participate in project activities; 
b)  Facilitating district and lower levels’ participatory planning activities to determine which 
activities will be implemented in which communities; 
c)  Reviewing  and  recommending  to  the  PO  the  community-level  implementation  work 
plans prepared by the line agencies; 
d)  Coordinating  the  involvement  of  district  technical  agencies  and  their  grassroots-level 
extension, NGOs, private sector players, as well as farmers’ groups; and 
e) 
facilitating  liaison  with  target  communities,  assisting  with  the  collection  of  M&E  data, 
and documentation of project activities. 
80.  Upazila  and  Union  Offices’  Participation.  DAE  offices  at  Upazila  and  Union  will 
participate  in extending the operational coordination from the DCU to the  target  groups. 
Upazila Agricultural Officer and Union Sub-Assistant Agricultural Officers (SAAOs) will be 
the  focal  persons  for  the  field  implementation.  Similarly,  BADC’s  upazila  Sub-Assistant 
Engineers will participate in field implementation. 
81.  DAM will engage through outsourcing Marketing Facilitators at upazila level to work with 
the farmer groups in the unions. 
82.  In each project union, three lead farmers will be selected from the selected farmer groups 
and they will be engaged on a basis of daily basis remuneration in accordance with actual 
day  (s)  occurred,  to  support  the  field  work  of  upazila  officers  of  DAE,  BADC  and  DAM 
marketing facilitators. 
83.  Farmer  Producer  and  Marketing  Groups  are  the  entry  point  for  SACP  implementation. 
The  project  strategy  and  activities  are  geared  towards  ensuring  that,  by  the  end  of  the 
Project, farmer groups grow into more professional players in targeted value chains, and 
some of them graduate into production and marketing cooperatives. DAE SAAOs, BADC 
Sub-Assistant Engineers and DAM-engaged Marketing Facilitators will work to reach  the 
target farmers and their groups with assistance from the engaged lead farmers, mainly in 
facilitating the identification of their priority needs and connecting them to the support by 
the Project, delivering project messages, supporting farmers groups and communities to 
set  up  better  organisations  and  structures  in  value-added  production  enhancement  and 
post-harvest  management,  collecting  performance  data  for  transmission  to  the  DCU 
through  DAE  Upazila  and  Union  offices,  and  providing  feedbacks  on  performance  of 
service providers. 
84.  Implementation responsibilities. Component-wise lead implementation agencies are as 
follows: 
(1)  DAE for component 1, 
(2)  DAM for component 2, 
(3)  BADC for component 3, and 
(4)  BARI  will  support  the  three  implementing  agencies  with  researches  linked  to 
areas of interventions identified under the three technical components. 
85.  Options  will  be  explored  to  link  the  benefit  M&E  system  with  the  project  management 
M&E  system  (which  will  be  in  line  with  IFAD’s  revised  results  and  impact  management 
system  (RIMS)).  Such  linkage  will  avoid  duplication  of  data  collection  and  improve  the 
possibility of attribution of results to project activities

Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation   
6.1.  Annual Planning Process  
86.  The  SACP  will  apply  a  results-based  management  approach  which  establishes  a  solid 
linkage between planning (including resource allocation), implementation, monitoring and 
evaluation. This approach will ensure all processes and activities of the project are in line 
with the project goal, objectives and expected results.  
87.  The  project  will  be  implemented  in  11  districts  covering  30  upazilas  with  activities 
implemented  by  the  Lead  Agency  with  the  existing  management  and  coordination 
structure  at  DAE  central  level  and  Coordination  Unit  (CU)  at  district  level.  In  addition, 
activities  will  be  directed  at  multiple  stakeholders,  including  landless,  marginal,  small 
farmers  as  well  as  other  actors  along  the  value  chain.  As  the  project  will  involve  with 
several  implementing  partners  including  DAE,  DAM,  BADC,  and  BARI,  this  complexity 
affects  project  management  and  must  be  dealt  with  in  an  effective  way  to  reduce 
bureaucracy and unduly lengthy planning and reporting processes. 
6.2.  Annual Work Plan and Budget (AWPB) 
88.  The  project  AWPB  will  be  a  basis  for  implementation  and  should  clearly  describe  the 
strategic direction of the project for the coming years by resenting a budget estimate, the 
expected  results  under  each  component  and  how  these  results  would  be  achieved  with 
risk  analysis  if  any.  The  preparation  of  AWPBs  will  be  jointly  conducted  by  the  project 
management  in  consultation  with  local  implementing  partners  and  beneficiaries  where 
relevant.  A  participatory  annual  planning  process  with  stakeholders  will  be  set  up  to 
ensure  the  bottom-up  feedback  on  community  needs,  priorities,  contextual  opportunities 
and limitation.   
89.  In  preparing  the  first  AWPB,  the  Project  Management  should  be  aware  of  available 
budget and the amount of Initial Deposit released in order to prioritize critical investments 
identified. It would be necessary to anticipate the following project fiscal year’s budget to 
avoid  shortage  of  funds  available  for  the  succeeding  year.  Counterpart  matching  funds 
should be secured and accounted in the AWPB. 
90.  In  preparing  the  AWPB,  narrative  presentation  should  be  concise  and  precise; 
spreadsheet  tables  and  schemas  should  be  used  where  needed  to  illustrate  targets, 
achievements, costs and financing. 
91.  An  AWPB  primary  consists  of  seven  parts  (chapters),  which  first  update  the  past 
achievements  with  focus  on  the  previous  year’s,  then  address  the  projections  for  the 
upcoming fiscal year:

92.  The AWPB along  with  procurement plan  will  be  drawn up by  the  Project  Office with the 
support  of  M&E  and  Finance  units  and  technical  staff,  in  consultation  with  DCUs, 
174 
Bangladesh 
Smallholders Agriculture Competitiveness Project

Appendix 13: Draft SACP Project Implementation Manual 
implementing  partners  and  stakeholders  including  beneficiaries  (e.g.  farmer  groups  and 
women)  where  relevant.  The  PO  will  prepare  draft  consolidated  AWPB  for  each  Fiscal 
Year, based upon district level plans and AWPBs prepared by each implementing agency 
for their respective section of the Project implementation.  Each draft AWPB will  include, 
among  other  things,  a  detailed  description  of  planned  Project  activities  for  the  relevant 
Project Year, the sources and uses of funds there for and updated the procurement plan.  
93.  The PO will submit a draft consolidated AWPB to the PSC for its approval no later than 90 
days before the beginning of the relevant Fiscal Year. Once approved, the PO will submit 
the  draft  AWPB  to  IFAD  for  comments  and  approval,  no  later  than  60  days  before  the 
beginning of the relevant Fiscal Year.  
94.  The PD, DCU, operational support team and related implementing agencies will adopt the 
AWPBs substantially in the form approved by IFAD. The PO will provide copies thereof to 
IFAD,  prior  to  the  commencement  of  the  relevant  Project  Year.  If  required  by  IFAD,  the 
PO  will  propose  adjustments  in  the  AWPB  with  the  approval  of  the  PSC.  Such 
adjustments will be effective upon approval by the IFAD. The AWPB will be informed by 
an  assessment  of  current  implementation  progress  and  will  describe  the  strategic 
direction  of  the  project  for  the  coming  year  along  with  results  expected  (targets)  under 
each component and how those results will be achieved. This will be complemented by a 
resource plan, budget and risk analysis for each result. The AWPB will also include plans 
for training and technical assistance, M&E and procurement for the year in question 
6.3.  Baseline, Mid-Term and Project Completion Studies 
95.  Impact  will  be  assessed  on  the  basis  of methodologically  sound  baseline,  mid-term  and 
completion  surveys  which  use  the  same  approach  so  as  to  allow  a  meaningful  before, 
during  implementation  at  completion  in  order  to  carry  out  a  comparison  analysis.  These 
surveys  will  include  a  comparison  group  so  a  difference-in-differences  analysis  can  be 
conducted  at  the  end  of  the  project  to  strengthen  the  assessment  of  effectiveness  and 
impact.  The  surveys  will  elicit  data  at  the  impact  and  outcome  level  according  to  the 
project  logical  framework  and  RIMS  indicators  as  well  as  socio-demographic  data  and 
other  relevant  information  for  targeting,  planning  and  evaluation.  It  is  essential  that  a 
baseline  study  will  be  carried  out  immediately  upon  start-up  in  order  to  inform  overall 
project  planning,  ensure  benchmarks  and  realistic  targets  are  set  for  outcomes  and 
impact.  The  baseline  study  will  include  a  household  survey  to  assess  socio-economic 
level  of  beneficiaries  and  group  beneficiaries  in  different  sub-target  groups.  It  will  also 
assess  the  knowledge,  attitude  and  behaviour  of  farmers.  The  Mid-term  and  impact 
evaluation  will  follow  the  same  methodology  as  the  baseline  study  to  allow  meaningful 
comparison,  although  the  scope  of  the  impact  evaluation  may  be  broadened  to  cover 
other  aspects  of  project  relevance,  effectiveness,  efficiency,  impact  and  sustainability  to 
adequately inform the project’s completion report. A midterm review will be conducted in 
year  three  or  half  way  of  project  implementation.  The  review  will  assess  the  relevance 
(i.e.  internal  and  external  validity  of  project  design),  effectiveness  (progress  towards 
targets),  and  efficiency  (funds  disbursed  vis-à-vis  achievements)  of  the  project.  Any 
suggested  changes  in  design,  implementation  approach,  cost  or  targets  should  be 
assessed and endorsed by IFAD. 
Financial Management 
7. 
7.1.  Book of Accounts   
96.  The  accounting  policies  and  procedures  of  the  project  will  be  governed  by  International 
Accounting  Standards  and  the  existing  GoB  system  outlined  in  the  Project  Accounting 
Manual of the Ministry of Finance. The PO will have the primary responsibility to maintain 
175 
Bangladesh 
Smallholders Agriculture Competitiveness Project 
Final project design report  
Appendix 13: Draft SACP Project Implementation Manual 
an adequate FM system across all levels of implementation of the project and to provide 
accurate and timely financial information to the Government and IFAD. 
97.  The  project  will  procure  and  adopt  an  accounting  system  package  conforming 
international  standards  during  start-up.  In  addition,  a  simplified  FM  system  will  be 
implemented at the  District Coordination  Units to ensure proper reporting to each of the 
Implementing Agencies. The project will guarantee the availability of resources to conduct 
periodic training on the use of the accounting software to strengthen the capacity at the 
district level. 
98.  As there has been positive results from the use on an accounting software in the country 
programme  which  has  been  recalibrated  to  meet  the  accounting  and  reporting 
requirement  for  both  government  and  IFAD,  MoA  should  consider  using  the  same 
software for SACP, which would provide the Project better value for money 
7.2.  Designated Account/Project Account   
99.  There  will  be  one  Designated  Account  at  the  Central  Bank  of  Bangladesh  under  SAFE 
arrangements to receive the funds of the financing. The DA will be managed by the PD, 
and  transfers  to  the  Implementing  Agencies  will  be  made  according  to  consolidated 
financial information and approved AWPBs. The project will open one Project Account in 
local currency to receive transfers from the Designated Account at the PO level. Also, four 
project sub-accounts in local currency will be opened for the corresponding implementing 
agencies, namely DAE, DAM, BADC and BARI to receive transfers from the Designated 
Account. Three accounts will be opened in every District Coordination Unit (one per each 
Implementing  Agency);  participating  BARI  stations  will  also  open  and  maintain  their 
accounts where applicable. 
7.3.  Funds Flow/Disbursement 
100. 
The PO will be responsible for transferring project funds to the operating 
accounts  of  the  Implementing  Agencies.  These  transfers  will  be  treated  as  advances  at 
the  PD,  with  monthly  reporting  on  the  use  of  funds,  and  these  accounts  will  appear  as 
unreconciled  items  on  the  financial  statements  until  they  have  been  accounted  for  and 
liquidated 
7.4.  Statement of Expenditure (SOE) 
will  be  updated  once  the  financing  agreement  and  letter  to  borrowers  (LTB)  issued  to  the 
Goverment 
7.5.  Disbursement Procedures 
101. 
The PO will be responsible for transferring project funds to the operating 
accounts  of  the  Implementing  Agencies.  These  transfers  will  be  treated  as  advances  at 
the  PD,  with  monthly  reporting  on  the  use  of  funds,  and  these  accounts  will  appear  as 
unreconciled  items  on  the  financial  statements  until  they  have  been  accounted  for  and 
liquidated. 
102. 
A  start-up  advance  may  be  provided  once  the  financing  agreement  has 
become  effective,  to  facilitate  implementation  readiness  activity,  pending  satisfaction  of 
176 
Bangladesh 
Smallholders Agriculture Competitiveness Project 
Final project design report  
Appendix 13: Draft SACP Project Implementation Manual 
the disbursement conditions specified in the financing agreement. The ceiling of the start-
up will be agreed upon at negotiations based on a realistic plan.  
103. 
Transfers  to  entities  implementing  SACP  activities  will  be  treated  as 
advances, with monthly reporting on the use of funds, and these accounts will appear as 
unreconciled  items  on  the  financial  statements  until  they  have  been  accounted  for  and 
liquidated 
7.6.  Withdrawal Application 
will  be  updated  once  the  financing  agreement  and  letter  to  borrowers  (LTB)  issued  to  the 
Goverment 
7.7.  Staffing and Cost Centre   
will  be  updated  once  the  financing  agreement  and  letter  to  borrowers  (LTB)  issued  to  the 
Goverment 
7.8.  Capacity Development 
will  be  updated  once  the  financing  agreement  and  letter  to  borrowers  (LTB)  issued  to  the 
Goverment 
7.9.  Assets Management 
will  be  updated  once  the  financing  agreement  and  letter  to  borrowers  (LTB)  issued  to  the 
Goverment 
7.10.  Reporting 
104. 
The PO will be responsible of consolidating the financial information from 
the  Implementing  Agencies  and  to  prepare  semi-annual  and  annual  (audited)  Financial 
Reports  (FRs)  for  all  relevant  parties.  The  Implementing  Agencies  (DAE,  BADC,  DAM 
and  BARI)  will  be  responsible  of  consolidating  the  financial  information  from  the  District 
Coordination  Units  (DCUs).    The  FRs  will  be  consistent  with  International  Accounting 
Standards  and  the  Project’s  Finance  Manual.  Semi-annual  Financial  Reports  with 
accurate and updated financial information will be prepared by the  PO for submission to 
IFAD within 45 days from the end of each semester. 
105. 
Financial  Reports  will  be  produced  directly  from  the  automated  project 
accounting  system  (with  the  capability  to  report  by  component  and  by  category  of 
expenditure),  and  not  from  any  other  stand-alone  manual  or  electronic  system.  The  PO 
and  the  Implementing  Agencies  will  need  to  have  the  capacity  to  record  GoB 
contributions,  as  well  as  in-kind  contributions  of  private  companies  and  beneficiaries,  if 
necessary. 
7.11.  Internal Control 
106. 
SACP  will  be  required  to  establish  adequate  internal  controls  and 
procedures in the PIM and in the Financial Manual to guarantee: (a) operations are being 
conducted effectively and efficiently; (b) financial and operational reporting is reliable; (c) 
applicable laws and regulations are being complied with, and (d) assets and records are 
safeguarded. 
177 
Bangladesh 
Smallholders Agriculture Competitiveness Project 
Final project design report  
Appendix 13: Draft SACP Project Implementation Manual 
107. 
At a minimum, the procedures should include the following measures: (a) 
Reliable  personnel  with  clear  responsibilities  i.e.  segregation  of  duties;  (b)  Adequate 
financial  records  management  system  with  complete  audit  trail;  (c)  Physical  safeguard, 
including use of safe, locks, guards, limited access, and access by authorized persons to 
provide  security  for  program  assets;  (d)  Independent  check,  with  procedures  made 
subject to random independent reviews. 
7.12.  Internal Audit 
108. 
Internal auditing will be carried  out by private firm twice in the life of the 
project.  The  preparation  of  the  audit  plan  will  take  into  account  the  different  levels  and 
agencies involved in the implementation. 
7.13.  External Audit 
109. 
The  Foreign  Aided  Projects  Audit  Directorate  (FAPAD)  of  the  Office  of 
the Comptroller & Auditor General (OC&CAG) of Bangladesh will conduct an audit of the 
project’s annual financial statements within six months of the end of the fiscal  year. The 
audit will be carried out on a yearly basis and in compliance with International Standards 
on Auditing and the IFAD Guidelines on Project Audits.  According to the performance of 
the project and in addition to the FAPAD audit, it may be possible that IFAD requests the 
project to be audited by an external audit firm. 
Procurement 
8. 
8.1.  Staffing and Capacity Development 
110. 
Procurement  will  be  conducted  by  the  Project  Office  and  implementing 
agencies (DAE, DAM, BARI and BADC) according to the level of authority structured for 
the  project.  A  detailed  list  of  common  items  will  be  prepared  for  procurement  through 
Project Office. 
111. 
A  recent  assessment  done  by  World  Bank  for  NATP  II  project  revealed 
that  the  implementing  agencies  have  the  experience  in  the  procurement  function; 
however  their  human  resources  capacity  is  assessed  as  not  sufficient  to  handle  the 
project  procurement  activities.  To  minimize  the  associated  risk,  procurement  specialists 
will be hired in the principal cost centers of the project 
8.2.  Procurement Methods 
112. 
Public  Procurement  Act  2006  (PPA)  and  the  Public  Procurement  Rules 
2008  (PPR)  are  the  two  legal  documents  that  deal  with  public  procurement  in 
Bangladesh. The PPA and PPR disseminate the purpose and principles of Bangladesh’s 
public  procurement  and  procedural  requirements.  It  has  contained  good  international 
practices,  including:  (a)  nondiscriminatory  selection  of  bidders;  (b)  wide  advertising  of 
procurement opportunities; (c) public opening of bids in a single location; (d) disclosure of 
all  contract  awards  above  a  specified  threshold  on  the  CPTU’s  website;  (e)  clear 
accountability  for  delegation  and  decision  making;  (f)  annual  post-procurement  audit 
(review); (g) sanctions for fraudulent and corrupt practices; and (h) review mechanism for 
handling bidders’ protests. 
113. 
The  PPA  and  PPR  allow  for  advances  in  technology  by  providing  for 
electronic processing  in  public  procurement in Bangladesh. The  system for doing this is 
the  E-Government  Procurement  (e-GP)  system.  E-GP  is  a  lone  web  portal  from  where, 
and  through  which,  Procuring  Agencies  and  Procuring  Entities,  can  perform  their 
178 
Bangladesh 
Smallholders Agriculture Competitiveness Project 
Final project design report  
Appendix 13: Draft SACP Project Implementation Manual 
procurement related activities using a dedicated secured web based dashboard. e-GP is 
hosted  at  the  CPTU  Data  Centre,  and  it’s  use  is  governed  by  the  E-Government 
Procurement (e-GP) Guidelines. 
114. 
Procurement of goods, works and services of SACP shall be carried out 
in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  the  Public  Procurement  Act  2006  (PPA)  and  the 
Public  Procurement  Rules  2008  (PPR),  to  the  extent  that  are  consistent  with  IFAD 
Procurement  Guidelines.  If  there  is  any  conflict  between  the  government  and  IFAD 
procedures,  the  provisions  identified  in  IFAD  Project  Procurement  Guidelines  and  IFAD

8.3.  Procurement of Vehicles and Equipment 
117. 
Vehicle  and  motorcycles  for  the  projects  will  most  likely  to  procure 
through  Direct  Procurement  from  Government  owned  enterprises.  The  option  exists  for 
procurement  from  other  suppliers  through  the  National  Open  Tender  Method  (NOTM). 
Purchase  of  computers,  air  conditioners  and  photocopiers,  machineries  for  post-harvest 
management  and  processing  would  primarily  from  local  suppliers  by  NOTM  –  although 
there  also  exists  the  option  of  Request  for  Quotations  (RFQ)  for  standard  specification 
items in lots specified  in  Schedule II of PPR. Office furniture may  be  procured  by  either 
RFQ  or  NOTM.  Attention  is  required  to  see  that  requirements  are  bulked  up  wherever 
practical. 
118. 
Vehicle  operating  costs  would  be  procured  using  RFQ  and  direct 
procurement. Procurement for office running expenses would follow the same procedure. 
The procuring entity may undertake direct cash purchase of low value goods and urgent 
essential services such as maintenance, repairs transportation etc. in a lots of under BDT 
25,000. 
8.4.  Procurement of studies, survey, and other specialized services   
119. 
Procurement  of  Studies:  It  is  envisaged  that  most  of  the  research  work 
will be carried out by implementing agencies and M&E. There will also be requirement of 
specialized  agencies  to  conduct  studies  on  Demand  Driven  and  Market  Oriented 
Research.  The  procurement  of  consultant  to  carry  out  these  studies  would  follow  the 
Request for Expression of  Interest method. For selection of successful tenderers, either 
Quality  and  Cost  Base  Selection  (QBCS)  or  Fixed  Budget  Selection  (FSB)  or  Lest  Cost 
Selection (LCS) negotiation method will be used.     
120. 
Procurement  of  Training:  Training  organized  by  Project  Office  or  the 
Implementing Agencies could be procured through RFQ method if there is small number 
of qualified organizations. Single Source Selection method may be used– where there is 
only  a  single  qualified  supplier,  or  the  supplier  is  a  government  agency.  However  for 
many  courses,  the  Project  Office  or  respective  implementing  agency  will  organize  each 
element  of  the  training,  and  individual  trainers  may  be  hired  via  Selection  of  Individual

including  the  Project  Director,  four  Component  Director  from  respective  implementing 
agencies (DAE, DAM, BADC & BARI) and one Administrative Officer would be seconded 
from  Government.  Operational  Support  Team  (OST)  will  be  composed  of  Project 
Management, Financial Management, Procurement, M&E and KM, Procurement, Gender, 
Technical Component Coordinators, and other required staff would be recruited by PO on 
a  contract  basis.  For  such  recruitment,  a  recruitment  committee  would  form  headed  by 
the  PO  with  representative  of  implementing  agencies.  Candidate  would  be  short  listed 
according  to  ToR  which  specifies  the  task  to  be  carried  out  and  required  qualifications, 
experience  and  age  limits  if  any.  Short  listed  candidate  would  then  be  interviewed.  For 
senior  positions  (PD,  FM,  M&E,  Procurement  and  Gender)  the  CVs  of  the  top  three 
candidates  for  each  position  would  be  sent  to  IFAD  for  approval  prior  to  their 
appointment. Draft ToR would be included in the draft Project Implementation Manual.  
122. 
Some  senior  and  specialized  advisory  posts  would  be  filled  by  the 
consultants.  The  preferred  method  is  to  recruit  individual  consultant  using  Selection  of 
Individual  Consultants  (SIC)  method.  The  process  to  be  followed  will  be  the  same  as 
prescribed for senior positions in above paragraph. 
8.6.  Working with private sector, NGOs and other service providers 
123. 
The  project  activities  contains  a  number  of  cost  sharing  components  by 
Private  Sector  and  Beneficiaries.  The  costs  structure will  be  defined  in  Memorandum  of 
Understanding  with  respective  organizations.  Procurement  procedures  by  the  private 
sector  will  be  defined  in  memorandum.  For  beneficiaries  it  will  follow  the  guidelines  for 
Matching Grant Fund. 
8.7.  Procurement of works 
124. 
All  infrastructural  components,  would  be  implemented  by  contractors 
selected  through  NOTM.  There  is  also  the  option  for  RFQ  for  low  value  simple  works, 
provided that the estimated value of such works shall not exceed the threshold specified 
in Schedule II of PPR. 
8.8.  Review of Procurement Decisions 
125. 
As  an  added  risk  mitigation  measure,  IFAD  would  undertake  prior  and 
post  review  of  procurement  decisions  and  detail  of  these  would  be  referenced  in  the 
Letter to the Borrower/Recipient. 
8.9.  Thresholds for prior review from the IFAD

131. 
The core relevance of the M&E system is in the use of the information for 
planning  and  decision-making  as  well  as  accountability.  An  integrated  knowledge 
management  and  communication  (KMC)  strategy  will  be  developed  in  line  with  IFAD 
policy on KM and built on three core pillars of knowledge management: people, process 
and  technology.  It  will  include  information  management,  monitoring  and  evaluation, 
innovation  and  experimentation,  internal  and  external  communication  and  learning.  The 
previously mentioned MIS and M&E system will be a core part of this strategy and will be 
sources  of  information  from  which  key  lessons  need  to  be  extracted  and  appropriately 
disseminated.  
132. 
Knowledge  tools  and  platform.  Similar  to  the  overall  and  annual  M&E 
plans,  the  project  will  develop  KM  plans  and  incorporate  KM  into  the  M&E  plans.  The 
primary  aspect  will  be  internal  knowledge  management  but  given  the  proliferation  of 
interventions  related  to  development  of  the  high  value  crops  (HVC)  production  and 
marketing  in  Bangladesh.  Progress  reports  will  include  sections  on  lessons  learned, 
challenges  and  best  practices  and  these  must  be  captured  by  project  management, 
analysed  across  the  project  and  communicated  for  improved  implementation.  Some 
vehicles  for  this  communication  will  be  quarterly  review  meetings  with  implementing 
partners, planning workshops, and newsletters. Through this process attention will be put 
on ensuring that lessons are used in decision-making. 
133. 
The  SACP  logical  framework  will  be  used  as  roadmap  for  annual 
planning,  monitoring  and  evaluation.  In  line  with  IFAD’s  revised  Results  and  Impact 
Management  System  (RIMS),  expected  results  will  be  measured  at  two  levels;  outputs

IFAD  policies.  The  SACP  is  well  in  line  the  overarching  goal  of  the  IFAD  Strategic 
Framework  2016  –  2025,  aligning  its  investments  with  transforming  the  agricultural  sector  towards 
higher,  sustainable  and  climate-smart  productivity,  profitability,  commercialization,  connecting  the 
smallholder  farmer  and  rural  households  to  market  opportunities  and  improved  support  services  to 
generate  more  income  for  improved  livelihood,  food  and  nutrition  security,  and  therefore  better 
resilience. 
2. 
SACP also falls into the intervention priorities of the specific country strategy (COSOP) 2012 
–  2018  for  Bangladesh.  The  design  mission  confirmed  the  essential  elements  of  the  concept  note’s 
logical framework and refined it to better detail sub-components and activities: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Increase  rural  people’s  productive  capacities:  Promoting  access  to  natural  resources, 
agricultural  technologies  and  productive  services  that  lead  to  enhanced  agricultural 
production for improved household food security, improved nutrition and diversified income 
sources; 
Increase  rural  people’s  benefits  from  market  participation:  Increasing  engagement  of  rural 
households  in  diversified  agro-business  and  employment  opportunities,  rural  producers’ 
organizations, rural  infrastructure, that  provide them appropriate support services, linkages 
to markets for improving their livelihoods; 
Adaption of rural livelihoods to climate change and the scaling up of successful approaches: 
developing  and  adapting  enhanced  climate-resilience  approaches  and  promoting  the  best 
practices through effective knowledge management  
Gender:  to  ensure  that  project  activities  reach  a  significant  number  of  poor  rural  women, 
men and youth and improve their rural livelihoods. 
3. 
The  SACP  is  also  in  line  with  the  national  strategies  in  poverty  alleviation,  agriculture  and 
rural development and climate change adaptation, as it is based on development-driven support to the 
vulnerable  target  groups,  blending  a  number  of  multi-benefit  intervention  in  enhanced  production, 
post-harvest  management  with  focus  on  processing  and  marketing,  climate-smart  surface  water 
management  and  irrigation  efficiency  to  help  improve  the  access  to  opportunities  for  the  rural 
smallholders.  The  Project  responds  to  the  Government’s  Southern  Master  Plan  by  channelling  its 
investments  fostering  the  responsiveness  and  competitiveness  of  rural  smallholders  in  horticulture 
HVCs in Southern Bangladesh. 
SECAP55. The environmental and social risk of the project falls under the category B in view 
4. 
of  little  or  negligible  adverse  impact  potential  on  natural  and  social  environment,  while  it  also  falls 
under  category  ‘High’  regarding  climate  change  risks.  By  committing  to  the  below-mentioned 
approaches and activities, the project will significantly be reducing the perceived risks and expected to 
have  a  great  contribution  towards  enhancing  resilience  and  reducing  poverty  of  smallholders  in  the 
target areas.  
5. 
The  SACP  is  envisaged  to  promote  improved  agronomic  practices,  knowledge  base, 
research support and extension for high value crops, without having to affect natural environment. In 
order for extending better extension services and research facilities, a few minor construction-related 
activities  will  be  undertaken.  Although,  little  environmental  hazard  may  be  anticipated  in  relation  to 
such  unavoidable  constructions,  due  to  unavoidable  overlap  of  project  areas  and  environmentally 
critical  areas  (ECA),  efforts  need  to  be  made  to  reduce  environmental  costs  and  meeting  national 
conservation related regulatory requirements.

6. 
The SACP focuses on building Bangladesh’s coastal smallholders’ capacities on high value 
crop production and marketing, thereby enhancing smallholder farmers’ resilience to challenges likely 
to  be  posed  by  climate  change.  The  project  will  deliver  enhanced  resilience  by  responding  to 
production  challenges  in  terms  of  high  temperature  and  higher  levels  of  moisture  stress,  increased 
rainfall  and  runoff,  higher  susceptibility  to  floods,  high  soil  and  surface  water  salinity,  higher  wave 
interaction due to tidal regime, etc. While the activities that are oriented towards addressing the above 
climate  induced  phenomena,  efforts  will  be  considered  to  ensure  environmental  conservation  in  the 
forms  of  integrated  pest  management,  enhanced  use  of  composts  including  vermin  compost, 
conjunctive  use  of  surface  and  groundwater  for  irrigation,  increase  in  irrigation  efficiency  and  solid 
waste management in premium marketing centres. Emphasis will be given on water harvesting, which 
will  also  address  lack  of  adequate  source  of  potable  drinking  water  Utmost  efforts  will  be  made  to 
eliminate  the  use  of  environmental  resources  from  ecologically  critical  areas  while  the  value  chains 
will  be  established  taking  into  consideration  locally  suited  high  value  niche  (crop)  products,  that  too 
involving as many women as possible. The marketing centres will be designed and built on elevated 
plinths in a bid to avoid inundation from floods and occasional cyclonic storm surges.  
7. 
Recognizing the potential increase in intensity of climate change induced adverse impacts, 
the  project  will  emphasize  on  building  farmers’  capacity  to  adopt  the  above  mentioned  adaptive 
measures,  while  they  will  also  be  given  awareness  training  on  reducing  risks  that  are  related  to 
climate  change.  To  further  build  local  capacity  to  continue  high  value  crop  production  by  defying 
climate  change,  efforts  will  be  made  to  strengthen  research  on  crop  varieties  that  are  tolerant  to 
climate change induced hazards.
