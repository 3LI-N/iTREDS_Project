Executive Summary1 
1. 
2. 
3. 
Context  and  ownership.  READ  SI  (Rural  Empowerment  and  Agricultural  Development 
Scaling-up  Initiative)  is  the  first stage  in  the  scaling-up  of  the  successful  Rural  Empowerment 
and  Agricultural  Development  (READ)  project.  IFAD  supported  READ  from  2008  to  2014, 
which,  following  a  re-design  at  mid-term,  has  achieved  significant  results  in  terms  of 
empowering smallholder farmers, increasing income and production and strengthening village-
level  institutions  by  integrating  community-driven  development  and  agricultural  productivity 
activities into one complete package of support. READ further piloted a number of innovations, 
including (i) a focus on public-private partnership for instance with MARS for technical services 
in cocoa development; (ii) the out-sourcing of key services, such as village facilitation and input 
supply  (such  as  improved  seeds)  to  external  partners,  such  as  NGOs;  (iii)  a  clear  focus  on 
selected key food and income crops that were supported with a comprehensive, well-resourced 
input package; (iv) and working capital finance being provided as group based and owned, non-
collateral finance. Given this successful pilot, the Government of Indonesia (GoI) has identified 
READ  as  a  model  that  can  support  achieving  national  development  goals  and  has  requested 
IFAD financing and technical support in the scaling-up of the READ approach. 
Building  on  the  lessons  learned  from  READ  and  other  IFAD-supported  interventions  in  the 
country and region, READ SI will upgrade the original READ approach and move from a project 
to a programmatic platform with the intention to influence future public and private investment. It 
is expected that the READ SI approach will be further scaled up with national public financing. 
The  scaling  up  strategy  of  READ  SI  combines  testing  and  refining  the  READ  approach  in 
different  settings,  the  first  stage  of  geographical  replication  within  Sulawesi, West  Kalimantan 
and  East  Nusa  Tenggara  (NTT)  with  a  strong  knowledge  management  and  evidence-based 
policy dialogue framework and institutional capacity building. 
The high degree of ownership for this initiative, within the GoI in general and in the Ministry of 
Agriculture (MoA) in particular, is evident by the fact that MoA has already commenced scaling 
up elements of READ in two new provinces in 2015, in West Kalimantan and NTT, with a total 
budget  of  approximately  IDR  20  billion  per  year  (USD  1.45  million),  though  in  these  very 
different  agricultural  and  socio-economic  settings  the  initial  implementation  has  progressed 
slower than expected, highlighting the need for continued IFAD technical support to the broader 
scaling up. These locations will now be integrated into READ SI. 
Furthermore,  given  the  recent  large  increase  in  public  investment  in  the  agriculture  sector 
(national  budget  allocation  for  MoA  increased  by  50%  from  2015  to  2016,  mainly  for 
infrastructure  investments),  this  scaling  up  initiative  provides  a  strategic  opportunity  to  link  to 
large  scale  investment  programmes  such  as  the  very  large  Government-funded  UPSUS  and 
the  forthcoming  GoI/ADB/IFAD-supported  Integrated  and  Participatory  Development  and 
Management of Irrigation Project (IPDMIP) as well as smaller and more localized initiatives. 
4. 
Development Objective of READ SI is that "Rural households in Sulawesi, West Kalimantan 
and NTT are empowered individually and collectively with the skills, confidence and resources 
to sustainably improve their farm and non-farm incomes and livelihoods". The key performance 
targets are:  
(i)  >67,400 smallholder households directly benefiting of increased household assets by 25% 
more than comparable non-participating smallholder households;

(ii) Chronic malnutrition reduced by 10% in children under 5yrs of age; 
(iii) >80% of participating poor and near poor households increase real net farming or non-farm 
income by >30% more than comparable non-participating households;  
(iv) Commodity and livelihood groups are active and functioning effectively in 90% programme 
villages; and 
(v) Return on investment (ROI) exceeds 20%. 
5. 
READ  SI  duration  will  be  60  months,  with  programme  effectiveness  expected  no  later  than 
January 2018, but earlier if possible by agreement between GoI and IFAD.  
6. 
Target groups are farmers, including:  
(i)  the  poor  and  near  poor  who  have  the  potential  to  generate  economic  returns  from 
agriculture with programme support,  
(ii) active/demonstrating  farmers  that  will  act  as  “agents  of  change”  who  have  the  potential  to 
demonstrate and motivate the poor and near poor in their area to improve their livelihoods; 
and;  
(iii) landless  and  land-poor,  including  women-headed  households,  who  will  be  included  in 
activities directed at homestead gardening, improved nutrition and financial literacy.  
The  programme  areas  are  home  to  a  large  number  of  diverse  indigenous  people  and  ethnic 
groups,  particularly  the  komunitas  adat  terpencil  (KAT,  term  used  by  the  Ministry  of  Social 
Affairs for a group of people bound by geographical unity and shared  economic and/or socio-
cultural  systems).The  targeting  strategy  will  ensure  the  inclusion  of  ethnic  groups  and 
indigenous  people  who  meet  the  programme  selection  criteria,  as  well  as  the  adaptation  of 
activities to social and culturally influenced particulars of indigenous people.  
READ SI implementation areas will include a total of 18 districts, with 14 districts within four 
provinces  of  Sulawesi  Island  (Gorontalo,  Sulawesi  Tengah,  Sulawesi  Tenggara,  Sulawesi 
Selatan) and two districts in each of West Kalimantan and NTT. It is expected that READ SI will 
continue in the five original READ districts in Sulawesi Tengah and the two districts in each of 
NTT and West Kalimantan. Thus, there will be a total of 9 new and 9 old districts in READ SI. 
District selection will be finalized prior to negotiation.  
READ  SI  will  be  implemented  in  a  total  of  around  342  villages  -  262  new  villages  and  80  old 
villages. In each of the nine "old" districts, READ SI work in a total of 20 villages – made up of 
continue  working  in  approximately  10  "old"  READ  villages  and  extend  activities  to  about  10 
additional "new" villages2. For new districts, 18 new villages will be supported in each3. "New" 
villages (in  both old and new districts)  will receive the  "foundation stage" core  READ support, 
including substantial farmer training and small infrastructure support. Old villages in old READ 
districts will have a more advanced set of interventions. 
7. 
8. 
9. 
Programme Components 
10.  Component  1:  Village  agriculture  and  livelihoods  development  is  the  core  of  the  programme, 
both conceptually and in terms of direct impacts and accounts for around 57.8% of programme 
investments. The component focuses on the proven READ approach of community mobilization 
closely  integrated  with  agriculture  and  livelihood  development  within  programme  villages  with 
Village Facilitators and technical extension staff working side by side in each village. It includes 
all  activities  within  the  villages  and  implementation  will  be  led  by  district  governments  in  line 
with Indonesia's decentralization framework. 
2 The number of ‘old’ and ‘new’ villages in old districts will vary between districts. In the five old districts in Sulawesi 
Tengah there will be 10 old and 10 new villages. In the old districts in W. Kalimantan and NTT, READ SI will continue in 
all old villages plus some additional new villages to bring the total in the district to 20 villages 
3 Up to 30 villages may be supported in the districts in which the partnership with Mondelez is operating, currently 
expected to be Kolaka in Sulawesi Tenggara.

Rural Empowerment and Agricultural Development Programme Scaling-up Initiative (READ SI) 
Final programme design report 
11.  The  elements  of  the  integrated  village  process  include  four  complementary  dimensions  which 
will run in parallel with the programme supported households and common interest groups: 
(i)  Community mobilization; 
(ii)  Agriculture and livelihoods; 
(iii)  Savings, loans and financial literacy; and 
(iv)  Nutrition, including early childhood nutrition (i.e. "the first 1000 days"/1000 Hari Pertama 
Kehidupan) 
12.  The  four  dimensions  above  will  remain  relevant  to  all  READ  SI  villages,  however  the  original 
READ villages will be at a more advanced stage of development in terms of the thematic focus 
areas and therefore will be supported with a selected set of more advanced interventions. This 
will enable these advanced interventions to be tested and refined in a limited number of villages 
before being rolled-out later to new villages, enabling READ SI to continue to innovate around 
emerging  critical  issues  while  delivering  strong  impacts  with  increasing  efficiency  in  new 
villages. 
13.  Component  2:  Services,  inputs  and  market  linkages  deals  with  the  key  support  services  and 
markets, especially at the district level and the associated systems at higher levels, and covers 
five key services each addressed under a sub-component. This is an area of greater focus for 
READ SI and is intended to improve the performance and service delivery of these key services 
in  a  more  sustainable  way.  It  is  a  compliment  to  the  farmer-centred  activities  in  component  1 
and not a driver. It represents around 15.8 % of total programme budget, with the large majority 
of this (around three-quarters) targeted towards upgrading the public extension services - both 
in  terms  skills  and  some  infrastructure  –  directly  supporting  Component  1  activities.  The 
activities under each sub-component will be primarily managed and coordinated by the relevant 
technical staff in the National Programme Management Unit.  
14.  The sub-components each correspond to a key service or support market and are: 
2.1 Agricultural extension service (all districts) 
2.2 Financial services (all districts) 
2.3 Seed supply markets and system (all districts) 
2.4 Cocoa farmer support services and markets (Sulawesi only) 
2.5  Livestock  production  and  health  services  and  markets  (before  MTR  only  in  NTT,  possible 
scale up post-MTR) 
15.  Private-public  partnerships  will  be  an  important  part  of  the  approach  to  a  more  sustainable 
improvement  of  these  service  markets  and  systems,  especially  for:  financial  services  through 
locally focussed partnerships with banks; expanding on the successful partnership with MARS 
Cocoa  from  READ  to  further  strengthen  cacao  support  markets  and  establishing  new 
partnership with other lead cocoa firms, such as Mondelez, and; market-oriented collaborations 
between  rice  seed  multiplier  farmers  and  the  supporting  technical  seed  producer  agencies  of 
MoA. 
16.  Component 3: Policy and strategy development support has the objective to strengthen policy 
and  institutional  framework  for  smallholder  agriculture.  This  will  include  informing  national 
policies  and  programmes,  documenting  and  scaling  up  best  practices  and  building  public 
capacity to effectively deliver services in support of inclusive rural growth. This component will 
be primarily funded through an IFAD grant, and will be implemented and manage independently 
by  Directorate  for  Food  and  Agriculture,  BAPPENAS.  The  activities  will  be  linked  to 
complementary  investments,  such  as  the  IFAD-supported  policy  platform  on  irrigated 
agriculture in BAPPENAS.  
17. 
Implementation of READ SI will follow the overall implementation arrangements of READ and 
will inherit the strong management foundations that have underpinned READ's success. At the 
same time, it will also need to adapt some implementation principles reflecting the evolution into 
xiii 
Republic of Indonesia 
Rural Empowerment and Agricultural Development Programme Scaling-up Initiative (READ SI) 
Final programme design report 
a  programme  management  framework  (from  a  standalone  project).  Key  principles  on  which 
READ SI implementation arrangements will operate are: 
(i)  Designed to operate within mainstream government systems and processes; 
(ii)  Expanding strong core management team, including bringing in best managers from READ 
districts to more core roles in new READ SI programme; 
(iii)  Building  strong  systems  and  processes  to  maximize  management  efficiency  (especially 
given  high  workload  of  the  executing  agency  with  two  major  investments,  IPDMIP  and 
READ SI); 
(iv)  Build responsibility and accountability at all levels in the programme; 
(v)  Benchmarking  between  districts  and  within  districts  and  staff,  as  well  as  between 
provinces, enabled by independent monitoring and evaluation and also between provinces; 
and 
(vi)  Incentives  for  strong  performance,  to  foster  self-motivation,  but  with  mechanisms  to 
address under-performance. 
18.  MOA will be the Executing Agency for the loan funded activities with the Agency for Agricultural 
Extension and Human Resource Development (AAEHRD) being assigned to host the READ SI 
National  Programme  Management  Office  (NPMO),  continuing  from  READ.  The  NPMO  will 
contract additional technical specialists to work as an integrated part of READ SI delivery in the 
areas  of  social  mobilization  and  rural  finance.  This  implementation  model  was  recognized  to 
have been a major factor in READ's post-MTR success.  
19.  The  Implementing  Agency  for  the  policy  activities  financed  under  the  IFAD  grant  will  be 
Directorate for Food and Agriculture, BAPPENAS. 
20.  While  the  NPMO  has  overall  responsibility  for  programme  delivery,  each  of  the  Components 
has specific implementation arrangements: 
(i) 
Component 1: District Badan Perencanaan Pembangunan Daerah (BAPPEDA)) and 
their relevant technical agencies (OPD, e.g. Dinas Pertanian) will have prime 
responsibility for programme delivery within their districts. BAPPEDA will act as the 
coordinator for planning process at the District level. Dinas Pertanian will act as the 
District Programme Management Office and at the same time serves as Implementing 
Unit, along with the other relevant agencies. Staff from the specialist implementing 
partners on social mobilization and rural finance assigned to each district will work as 
an integrated part of the district implementation teams and be based in the relevant 
agency teams (similarly at sub-district level). The district teams will be provided with 
technical backstopping and monitoring by NPMO team as well as the corresponding 
provincial agencies, especially the provincial Dinas Pertanian who will host the READ 
SI Provincial Programme Support Unit (PPSU). There will be a more systematic 
process for engagement of Sub-district (Camat) and village heads (Kepala Desa). 
(ii) Component  2:  The  NPMO  will  have  primary  responsibility  for  delivery  of  activities 
under the four sub-components. In the case of cocoa and rural finance, public-private-
partnerships (PPPs) will be a central mechanism. 
(iii) Component 3: The grant will be managed independently by BAPPENAS. 
21.  Project  costs,  including  physical  and  price  contingencies,  duties  and  taxes  are  estimated  at 
USD  55.32  million  over  a  five-year  implementation  period.  Programme  investments  are 
organized  into  three  major  components:  (i) Village  agriculture  and  livelihoods  development 
(57% of the costs); (ii) Services inputs and market linkages (16% of the costs); and (iii) Policy 
Support (2% of the costs). Project Management at national, provincial and district level amounts 
to 25% of the total project cost.  
22.  Financing  will  be  from  an  IFAD  loan  of  USD  39.9  million,  or  72.1%,  of  the  total  programme 
cost,  complemented  by  a  grant  of  USD  1  million  (1.8%  of  total  programme  cost).  The 
Government  of  Indonesia  will  contribute  USD  9.6  million  (17.4%)  by  financing  salaries  of  all 
NPMO,  provinces,  districts  and  sub-districts  staff  and  by  waiving  taxes  and  duties.  The

Final programme design report 
programme  beneficiaries  are  expected  to  contribute  USD  2.6  million  (4.7%  of  the  programme 
cost)  -  mostly  to  co-finance  the  purchase  of  basic  and  advanced  agriculture  mechanization 
under  sub-component  1.2  -  and  “private  sector  partners”  –  which  are  companies  investing  on 
cocoa-related activities - will finance USD 2.2 million, or 4%, of the total programme cost.  
23.  Key risks to the programme have been identified and specific mitigation measures designed in 
order to address them, with the main risks being: 
(i)  selection of priority crops that benefit small farmers; 
(ii) private public partnerships’ effectiveness in serving small farmers; 
(iii) elite capture; 
(iv) programme management capacity and capacity support needs of new districts; and 
(v) ensuring continuity between READ and READ SI, especially in relation to the core teams of 
the NPMO and specialist implementing partners for social mobilization. 
24.  Sustainability  of  the  economic  benefits  to  READ  households  were  already  considered  to  be 
high under  READ,  as these  were primarily  achieved  through adoption of improved production 
practices based on knowledge and skills gained from the project - and knowledge once learned 
is  not  easily  forgotten.  READ  SI  aims  to  go  even  further  in  terms  of  sustainability  of  impacts. 
The design maintains the core READ approach and has additional elements intended to raise 
sustainability even further:  
(i)  Component 1 includes additional features such as: focus on financial literacy and savings 
to increase households' capacity to recover from shocks; linking savings and loan groups 
to banks, so they are more valued by their members and subject to greater management 
discipline and transparency; providing support for machinery investment via micro-service 
enterprises of farmers rather than giving machinery for free.  
(ii)  Component 2 is almost entirely geared towards building more sustainable support services 
and  markets  for  critical  services  and  inputs  to  serve  farmers’  demands.  These  include: 
more  sustainable,  market-based  local  supply  of  quality  rice  seed;  stronger  links  between 
farmers  and  established  mainstream  banks  as  well  as  better  supervision  of  local  MFIs, 
and;  improved  cacao  support  services  based  on  private  provision  of  advice  and  inputs. 
The expected collaboration with the Department of Agricultural Finance of MOA to extend 
the  range  and  coverage  of  agricultural  insurance  for  smallholders  also  has  potential  to 
significantly increase resilience and small farmers’ ability to recover from shocks. 
(iii)  From  an  environmental  perspective,  READ  and  READ  SI  both  have  the  opportunity  to 
improve the profitability of cacao to a level where it is an attractive choice for more farmers 
and  so  current  upland  land  used  for  maize  and  other  secondary  crops  is  likely  to  be 
diverted  to  cacao  (and  existing  cacao  plantings  sustained)  which  is  less  vulnerable  to 
unpredictable rain-fall and  also helps preserve soil fertility  and reduce erosion, especially 
on sloping land. Promotion of integrated homestead gardening, with small fish ponds, will 
also contribute to some increased resilience to climate shocks. 
(iv)  From  an  institutional  perspective,  READ  SI  is  the  first  stage  of  the  scaling-up  and 
mainstreaming  of  the  READ  approach  into  GoI  investment.  If  successful,  there  is  a  high 
likelihood of the READ approach being well sustained in the relevant institutions at central 
level and also across a wider number of districts and provinces.

Rural Empowerment and Agricultural Development Programme Scaling-up Initiative (READ SI) 
Final programme design report 
I.  Strategic context and rationale 
A.  Country and rural development context 
25.  A member of the G-20, Indonesia is a fast-growing middle-income country (MIC) with the fourth 
largest population in the world. With a 3% annual urban growth, over 50% of Indonesians now 
live  in  urban  centres,  generating  a  soaring  demand  for  consumption  goods,  including  food 
products.  
26.  Steady economic growth has led to gradual poverty reduction. The economy grew at average 
5.5% annually between 2002 and 2012, boosted by domestic consumption with around 25% of 
GDP  produced  by  Jakarta.  The  number  of  people  living  below  the  national  poverty  line  of 
IDR 312,000/month  (USD  21.7)  has  dropped  from  24%  in  1999  to  11%  in  2014  (27.7  million 
people). However, the pace of poverty reduction has been slowing over the last years and the 
2010-2014 National Medium-Term Development Plan to reduce poverty to 8-10% could not be 
achieved.  Besides,  another  27%  of  the  population  (or  68  million  people)  are  near  poor7  and 
extremely  vulnerable 
illness,  extreme  weather  or  price  volatility. 
Consequently, it is estimated that about 25% of Indonesians have fallen under the poverty line 
at least once in a three-year period.  
to  shocks  such  as 
27.  While poverty has been falling, malnutrition remains stubbornly high. In fact, the prevalence of 
stunting (height for age) among children under five years of age has risen slightly from 36.8% in 
2007  to  37.2%  in  2013.  There  is  therefore  a  pressing  need  for  a  renewed  focus  on  child 
malnutrition  integrated  with  economic  development.  More  generally,  Indonesia’s  Human 
Development Index of 0.684 remains below the average for the East Asia and Pacific Region. 
Rising inequalities,  with an increase in the Gini Coefficient from 0.36 in 2005 to  0.41  in 2014, 
are threatening to roll back progress made in poverty reduction and further entrench poverty. 
28.  Rural  poverty  remains  greater  than  urban  poverty,  in  absolute  and  relative  terms.  While  the 
GDP share of agriculture has come down to 12% (2014), it is still the main source of income for 
one  third  of  the  population  and  for  64%  of  the  poor.  This  means  that  across  the  country,  on 
average, farmer households are 3.5 times more likely to be poor than non-farming households 
(approximately  21%  vs  6%,  respectively).  Declining  land  sizes,  complex  and  insecure  tenure 
arrangements together with a lack of appropriate technologies, infrastructure, rural finance and 
input and output markets results in sub-optimal use of the already small landholdings and low 
labour productivity.  Vulnerability to climate change has reduced the options and  increased the 
risk of agriculture and innovation, whilst in many communities some households depending on 
agriculture own little or no land and work as labourers or share croppers. Consolidating poverty 
reduction  gains,  reducing  inequality  and  ensuring  the  rural  poor  are  included  in  economic 
growth opportunities is a national priority. 
29.  The  2015-2019  National  Medium Term  Development  Plan  projects  a  reduction  of  the  poverty 
rate from 11% to 7-8% and an annual economic growth rate of 8%. The agricultural, fisheries 
and  forestry  sector  are  expected  to  grow  by  4.5%  (0.6%  over  the  2014  growth  rate)  over  the 
same period. The plan targets four priority areas: food sovereignty, energy sovereignty, marine 
and maritime development and industry and tourism development.  
30.  There has been some evidence-based consolidation on the key elements needed for a strategy 
for rural growth around agriculture. That smallholders require infrastructure, technology, access 
to input and output markets and rural finance, at a minimum, has been well established. They 
also require security of tenure and an enabling policy structure that provides a secure context 
for  economic  growth.  The  importance  of  differentiating  the  capacities  and  needs  of  the  rural 
poor and developing approaches that respond to these needs is also  well accepted. Amongst 
the  rural  poor  there  are  smallholders  with  the  resource  base  to  generate  economic  returns, 
7 living on less than USD 2 a day 
1 
Republic of Indonesia 
Rural Empowerment and Agricultural Development Programme Scaling-up Initiative (READ SI) 
Final programme design report 
whilst for others agricultural income is a key but declining part of a broader livelihood strategy. 
National development planning is increasingly seeking approaches that can serve all rural poor 
and ensure that growth does not lead to entrenched poverty as Indonesia makes the transition 
to a modern middle income country.  
31.  While  support  for  economic  growth  is  pivotal,  parallel  investments  in  human  capital  are 
important. Human development progress in education (particularly female), technical capacity, 
health  and  access  to  knowledge,  is  both  an  outcome  and  a  driver  of  economic  growth. 
Indonesia  continues  to  perform  poorly  on  key  nutrition  indicators  and  evidence  shows  that 
education, particularly female literacy, is a main driver of progress. Women, whose equal rights 
are  recognized  in  law  and  whose  active  participation  in  household  livelihoods  is  evident, 
continue  to  lag  behind  men  on  key  human  development  indicators.  Projects  that  support  the 
organizational  capacity  of  women  as  economic  actors  in  their  own  right,  and  facilitate  their 
access to resources and knowledge, not only generate growth but also positive human capital 
dividends.  Rural  poverty  reduction  is  best  served  by  development  approaches  that  identify 
opportunities  for  economic  growth  tailored  to  differentiated  household  needs  and  combine 
these with key human capital investments.  
32.  Since  IFAD  started  working  in  Indonesia  in  1980,  16  loan  projects  have  been  developed, 
totalling USD 1 627 million, of which USD 530 million were financed by IFAD. Under the 2016-
2019  Country  Strategic  Opportunities  Programme  (COSOP),  IFAD  is  aiming  to  support 
inclusive rural transformation to enable rural people to reduce poverty and achieve sustainable 
livelihoods. The country strategy is organized around three interconnected strategic objectives. 
The  first  objective  is  to  facilitate  the  access  of  small-scale  producers  to  remunerative 
agricultural  markets,  to  enable  them  capture  the  benefits  emerging  from  a  growing  and 
diversifying  demand  for  food-based  products,  and  earn  higher  income.  The  second  strategic 
objective  is  to  build  the  resilience  of  small-scale  producers  and  their  families  and  to  optimise 
their  risk mitigation  strategies  to  reduce  their  vulnerability. The  third  objective  is  to  strengthen 
rural institutions so that they can support inclusive rural transformation and deliver accountable 
services  that  meet  the  needs  of  small  producers.  Interventions  under  the  2016-2019  COSOP 
are to target (i) smallholder farmers, both men and women, interested in commercial agriculture 
(ii) smallholder producers in the fisheries sector (iii) women and women headed households (iv) 
marginal communities and ethnic minorities in the selected geographic areas.  
33.  The  original  Rural  Empowerment  and Agricultural  Development  Programme  (READ)  became 
effective on 19 Nov 2008, with its completion on 31 Dec 2014. The total approved programme 
cost  was  USD  28.3  million  comprising  an  IFAD  loan  of  approximately  USD  21.08  million  and 
IFAD  grant  of  USD  500,000.  The  goal  of  READ  was  a  sustainable  improvement  in  the 
livelihoods of the rural poor in targeted villages of Sulawesi Tengah Province. The objective was 
a  sustained  growth  of  economic  activities  and  improved  natural  resource  management  in  the 
target villages. READ has been implemented in 5 districts of Sulawesi Tengah: Banggai, Buol, 
Parigi Moutong, Poso and Tolitoli.  
34. 
It is important to differentiate between READ before and after Mid-term Review (October 2011). 
Prior to the MTR, READ was largely a village planning and infrastructure project with only 14% 
of the budget targeted to agriculture development. Post MTR, READ was significantly focussed 
towards  agriculture  (away  from  village  infrastructure)  –  in  fact  47%  of  the  post  MTR  READ 
budget (of $11.4m) was applied to the Agriculture Component. Although post-MTR READ was 
implemented in only 3 years (2012-14), it achieved significant impact in terms of improved yield 
and  profitability  of  key  economic  and  livelihood  crops  and  exceeded  its  beneficiary  target  by 
100% (20,125 v 10,000). It should also be noted that the Agency for Agriculture Extension and 
Human  Resource  Development  (AAEHRD)  which  implemented  READ  did  so  with  almost  no 
external consultant support  – the  exception being the team of 150  village facilitators provided 
by an NGO.  In summary READ achieved a great deal with limited budget in a relatively short 
time.

35.  Three  key  strategies  were  employed  in  the  agriculture  component  of  post-MTR  READ:  
(i)  focusing  on  key  food  and  economic  crops  in  Sulawesi  Tengah  i.e.  rice,  maize,  cacao, 
coconuts  and  vegetables;  (ii)  developing  a  coherent  package  of support  which  addressed  the 
four  major  requirements  for  productivity  enhancement  i.e.  access  to  improved  genetics, 
affordable  working  capital,  farm  mechanization  and  adequate,  good  quality  technical  support; 
and (iii) introduction of partnerships with other agencies to ensure farming systems support was 
delivered with optimal efficiency. 
B.  Rationale 
36. 
for  agriculture-based  growth 
Importance  and  opportunities 
in  Sulawesi,  West 
Kalimantan  and  NTT.  Agriculture  remains  the  main  source  of  income  for  one  third  of  the 
population  and  for  64%  of  the  poor8. While  well  commercialized  in  some  parts  of  the  country 
(especially Java), smallholder agriculture  is less developed  in the remoter areas of Indonesia, 
such as Sulawesi and the  border  districts  in West Kalimantan and NTT. In these areas,  while 
there  are  some  successful  and  well  commercialized  farmers,  the majority  of  farmers  combine 
subsistence  agriculture  with  the  sales  of  small  surpluses  to  the  market.  Low  availability  of 
modern inputs, lack of appropriate technologies, low access to irrigation (less than 50% of the 
7.2  million  irrigated  hectares  are  fit  for  use),  high  post-harvest  losses  and  limited  access  to 
finance,  extension  and  other  support  services  contribute  to  low  yields  and  low  returns  from 
farming.  
37.  Sulawesi  is  already  a  key  production  area  for  several  commodity  crops,  including  cocoa  and 
coconut. Rice remains an important crop for many households, but Sulawesi is not yet a major 
rice  surplus  producer  in  Indonesia  –  though  there  is  considerable  potential  for  Sulawesi  to 
increase  its rice  production. This is important for Sulawesi's rice farmers but also for the food 
sovereignty of the country as a whole, as production on Java is approaching its limits and the 
gradual loss of agricultural land and labour on Java means that other areas of Indonesia need 
to increasingly produce a greater share of the country's food. 
38.  The border districts of NTT and W. Kalimantan are less developed in terms of market oriented 
agriculture even compared to many parts of Sulawesi, with subsistence oriented production still 
playing  an  important  role.  In  NTT  livestock  are  especially  important  in  household  livelihoods 
while cocoa is not widely grown. READ SI therefore needs to be able to support these different 
agricultural  priorities  in  different  agro-ecological  zones,  as  it  will  also  need  to  do  if  it  is  to  be 
scaled-up even more widely in Indonesia. 
39. 
40. 
Large parts of the  READ  SI programme areas have  yet to be developed and the potential for 
sustainable  intensification  is  significant.  There  are  therefore  substantial  opportunities  to 
increase  productivity  through  combined  environmentally  sustainable  packages  of  support  to 
enable  smallholders  to  earn  higher  incomes  serving  the  growing  demand  for  a  wide  range  of 
products from the increasingly urbanized population and growing middle class. 
Innovation in rural  empowerment and agricultural development.  READ  was implemented 
in Central Sulawesi with the objective of delivering sustainable improvements in the livelihoods 
of  the  rural  poor.  The  project  had  a  slow  start  with  poor  initial  performance.  The  project  was 
redesigned during the mid-term review (MTR) with a number of innovative elements to respond 
to beneficiaries’ needs:  
(i)  the integration of community empowerment and agricultural productivity activities into one 
complete package of support;  
(ii) a focus on public-private partnership for instance with MARS for technical services in cocoa 
development;

Rural Empowerment and Agricultural Development Programme Scaling-up Initiative (READ SI) 
Final programme design report 
(iii) the out-sourcing of key services, such as village facilitation and input supply (such as 
improved seeds) to external partners, such as NGOs;  
(iv) a clear focus on selected key food and income crops that were supported with a 
comprehensive, well-resourced input package; and  
(v) working capital finance being provided as group based finance.  
41.  READ  impacts.  After  the  MTR,  project  implementation  quickly  gained  momentum  and 
achieved strong results for rural women and men in Central Sulawesi9: 
(i)  Food security: 94% of READ households (HHs) reported a reduced food shortage period of 
less than 3 months (average duration: 1.9 months, maximum 4 month), while only 54% of 
non-READ HHs could report a food security shortage period below 3 months (average 
duration: 3.2, maximum 10 months).  
(ii) Increased income and asset ownership: READ HHs had higher income available than non-
READ HHs and 40% of the average monthly READ HH income was above the local poverty 
line – compared to 29% in non-READ HHs. 83% of beneficiaries further reported an 
increased income from agricultural production.  
(iii) Agricultural productivity: The service packages delivered to the smallholders resulted in 
strong yield increases: READ cocoa farmers achieved 193% higher yields than non-READ 
farmers. For coconut, the increment was as high as 500% (800kg with READ vs. 300kg 
without READ support). 
(iv) Empowerment: READ made a particular impact for women empowerment: As the Outcome 
Survey shows, women are now more involved in decision making processes, both at the 
household and village level, and have increased access to economic, agricultural and 
financial resources.  
(v) Access to markets and services: 91% of READ HHs reported improved access to markets, 
vs. 50% of non-READ HHs. 95% of READ HHs reported improved access to credit and 81% 
had accessed a financial service over the last 12 months (vs. 33% of non-project HHs). 
42.  Within  a  fairly  short  timeframe,  READ  turned  into  a  well-recognized  and  appreciated  brand 
among smallholder farmers and national, provincial and local government authorities. Since the 
READ  programme  closed  in  June  2015,  activities  have  continued  in  all  five  project  districts 
funded  by  the  respective  local  government  authorities,  the  private  sector  partners,  and 
importantly the beneficiaries themselves. It is especially notable that the local government in all 
five READ districts have taken on the SM team from READ in their own government operations. 
43.  Scaling up and harmonization.  The GoI requested IFAD to support the scaling up of READ 
under  READ  SI  as  it  is  considered  as  a  potential  model  for  larger  strategic  investment  to 
achieve  priorities  and  goals  laid  out  in  the  2005-2025  National  Long-Term  Development  Plan 
and  the  2015-2019  Medium-Term  National  Development  Plan.  Particularly  the  Medium-Term 
National  Development  plan  gives  prominence  to  agricultural  sector  development  and  aims  at 
ensuring  security,  self-sufficiency,  and  food  sovereignty  through  increase  of  domestic 
production  capacity. The  programme  is  fully  aligned  with  the  2016-2019  IFAD  COSOP  and  is 
working towards all three strategic objectives. 
44.  Given the recent  large increase in public investment in the  agriculture sector (national  budget 
allocation for MoA  increased by 50% from 2015 to 2016, mainly for infrastructure investments), 
this  scaling  up  initiative  provides  a  strategic  opportunity  to  link  to  large  scale  investment 
programmes  such  as  the  very  large  UPSUS  and  the  forthcoming  GoI/ADB/IFAD-supported 
Integrated  and  Participatory  Development  and  Management  of  Irrigation  Project  (IPDMIP)  as 
well as smaller and more localized initiatives.

Final programme design report 
45.  Building  on  the  lessons  learned  from  READ  and  other  IFAD-supported  interventions  in  the 
country and region, READ SI will upgrade the original READ approach and move from a project 
to a programmatic platform with an intention to influence future public and private investment.  
46. 
It is expected that the READ SI approach will be further scaled up with national public financing. 
The  scaling  up  strategy  of  READ  SI  combines  testing  and  refining  the  READ  approach  in 
different  settings  with  a  strong  knowledge  management  and  evidence-based  policy  dialogue 
framework and institutional capacity building.  
47.  The high degree of ownership for scaling up this initiative, in the GoI in general and in the MoA 
in particular, is evident by the fact that MoA has already commenced scaling up the community-
driven development element of READ in two other provinces in 2015, in West Kalimantan and 
NTT with a total budget of approximately IDR20 billion per year (USD1.45 million). Though, in 
these  very  different  agricultural  and  socio-economic  settings,  the  initial  implementation  has 
progressed slower than expected, highlighting the value-added of continued IFAD engagement 
in the scaling-up initiative. These districts will now be integrated into READ SI. 
II.  Programme description 
A.  Programme area and target group 
48.  The target groups are farmers, including:  
(i)  the  poor  and  near  poor  who  have  the  potential  to  generate  economic  returns  from 
agriculture with programme support;  
(ii) active  /demonstrating  farmer  that  will  act  as  “agents  of  change”  who  have  the  potential  to 
demonstrate and motivate the poor and near poor in their area to improve their livelihoods; 
and; 
(iii) landless  and  land-poor,  including  women-headed  households,  who  will  be  included  in 
activities directed at homestead gardening, improved nutrition and financial literacy.  
49.  Target group (b) will be involved in ‘livelihood’ activities whilst the second group will be formed 
around the selected agricultural commodities. The objectives and monitoring indicators for the 
performance  of  the  ‘livelihood’  and  ‘agriculture’  interventions  of  the  programme  will  differ. 
Women  will  constitute  50%  of  the  overall  target  group.  The  targeting  strategy  will  ensure  the 
inclusion  of  ethnic  groups  and  indigenous  people  who meet  the  programme  selection  criteria, 
as well as the adaptation of activities to social and culturally influenced particulars of indigenous 
people. A typology of target groups and the project responses is included in Appendix 2. 
50.  The  development  of  differentiated  "livelihood  based"  and  "agricultural  growth  based"  activities 
for  these  target  groups  will  support  the  programmatic  objectives  of  the  government.  By  using 
the proven READ model to trial interventions and activities that address distinct challenges and 
develop  replicable  development  responses  READ  SI  will  evolve  the  core  READ  approach  so 
that it is even more widely applicable. 
51.  Drawing on lessons from READ on the experience of gender inclusion, the gender strategy for 
READ SI is based on three main principles to support the relevance and accessibility of project 
interventions to poor rural women: (i) the definition of clear targets with responsibilities assigned 
to pursue these; (ii) putting the resources directly in the hands of the beneficiaries rather than 
routing  these  through  male  elite  dominated  Village  Fund  Management  Unit  (UPDDs)  as 
happened  in  READ  and  (iii)  developing  interventions  geared  to  women’s  expressed  interests, 
i.e.:  homestead  gardening  and  off-farm  interventions.  Drawing  on  these  principles,  the 
operational measures, detailed further in Appendix 4, include:  
(i) 
Gender targets of 50% for programme participants and VFs (mission fieldwork suggests 
that this is a realistic target).  
5 
Republic of Indonesia 
Rural Empowerment and Agricultural Development Programme Scaling-up Initiative (READ SI) 
Final programme design report 
(ii)  Gender sensitive selection of interventions to maximise returns to women’s labour and 
support their social and economic empowerment (the process is explained in depth in 
Annex 4).  
(iii) 
The mainstreaming of gender into the social mobilisation process, as outlined in Annex 4.  
(iv)  Direct targeting of homestead gardening interventions to women.  
(v) 
A secret vote on infrastructure choices to enable women to express preferences.  
(vi)  The inclusion and prioritisation of women as Financial Literacy Facilitators on financial 
literacy training.  
(vii)  A gender inclusive programme management and implementation team, including the 
appointment of private service providers with experience in gender and social inclusion.  
(viii)  Adherence to best practice in gender sensitive monitoring and evaluation of programme 
impact.  
52.  Programme  areas  will  include  a  total  of  18  districts,  with  14  districts  within  four  provinces  of 
Sulawesi Island (Gorontalo, Sulawesi Tengah, Sulawesi Tenggara,  Sulawesi Selatan) and two 
districts in each of West Kalimantan and NTT. It is expected that READ SI will continue in the 
five original READ districts in Sulawesi Tengah and the two districts in each of NTT and West 
Kalimantan. Thus, there will be a total of 9 new and 9 old districts in READ SI. District selection 
will be finalized prior to negotiation.  
53.  READ  SI  will  be  implemented  in  a  total  of  around  342  villages  -  252  new  villages  and  90  old 
villages. In each of the nine "old" districts, READ SI work in a total of 20 villages – made up of 
continue  working  in  approximately  10  "old"  READ  villages  and  extend  activities  to  about  10 
additional "new" villages10. For new districts, 18 new villages will be supported in each11. "New" 
villages (in  both old and new districts)  will receive the "foundation stage" core  READ support, 
including substantial farmer training and small infrastructure support. Old villages in old READ 
districts will have a more advanced set of interventions. 
54.  District selection will be finalized by MoA in line with the agreed criteria below.  For new READ 
SI  districts,  a  shortlist  of  districts  has  been  compiled  (Appendix  2)  from  those  that  have  both 
high  poverty  levels  and  agricultural  potential.  The  final  selection  of  districts  will  be  completed 
according to the following criteria: 
(i)  high poverty levels;  
(ii)  offer agricultural potential accessible to the target group; 
(iii)  avail credible commitment from Governors and leadership of candidate provinces and 
districts both to delivery of the immediate development objectives but also in collaborating 
closely with the central level teams to develop and refine an effective programmatic 
platform for READ; 
(iv)  enable the programme to address diverse and varied development challenges and that 
can test and further develop READ as a programmatic platform for rural development.  
55.  Given  that  READ  SI  is  to  work  in  diverse  settings  as  part  of  the  scaling-up  strategy,  the 
programme  will  work  in  all  four  Sulawesi  provinces  and  in  NTT  and  West  Kalimantan.  It  is 
recognized  that  this  choice  of  geographical  spread  may  be  more  challenging  to  manage 
compared  to  a  more  concentrated  geographical  area  which  may  otherwise  be  more  efficient 
10 The number of ‘old’ and ‘new’ villages in old districts will vary between districts. In the five old districts in Sulawesi 
Tengah there will be 10 old and 10 new villages. In the old districts in W. Kalimantan and NTT, READ SI will continue in 
all old villages plus some additional new villages to bring the total in the district to 20 villages 
11 Up to 30 villages may be supported in the districts in which the partnership with Mondelez is operating, currently 
expected to be Kolaka in Sulawesi Tenggara.

Final programme design report 
from a simple one-off project investment perspective. However, the desire to test the READ SI 
approach for further scaling-up justifies this additional management challenge. 
56.  READ SI will work primarily via the districts, so it is the poverty and agricultural potential at the 
district  level  that  will  guide  district  selection.  This  means  that  even  within  the  provinces  with 
poverty rates below the national average, READ SI will target the poorer districts.  In NTT and 
West Kalimantan READ SI will only work in the existing READ districts so no new districts are 
to  be  selected  in  these  two  provinces.  New  districts  will  therefore  only  be  in  Sulawesi. At  the 
provincial  level  in  Sulawesi,  three  of  the  Provinces  (Sulawesi  Tenggara,  Gorontalo  and 
Sulawesi  Tengah)  have  rural  poverty  rates  above  the  national  average,  whilst  the  other  one 
(Sulawesi Selatan) has rural poverty rates lower than the national average. However, given the 
scale of provinces, there are significant variations in poverty rates between districts within the 
same province. For example, in the relatively wealthier Sulawesi Selatan (South Sulawesi) the 
district-level  poverty  rate  range  from  6.3%  to  17.8%  (see Annex  1  of Appendix  2  for  detailed 
district level data). Furthermore, poverty mapping accounts for the population that is below the 
poverty line, but up to 40% of the population in Sulawesi is only just above the poverty line and 
lacks sufficient assets to cushion external shocks and to avoid falling back into poverty.  
57.  The  HDI  values  (not  adjusted  for  inequality)  for  the  Sulawesi  provinces  are  just  below  the 
national  average  of  0.684,  with  only  Sulawesi  Utara  having  a  higher  HDI  at  0.696.  Further, 
whilst not as poor as the Papua and Molucca regions, large absolute numbers of poor, growing 
inequality  and  land  scarcity  are  a  concern  and  closely  aligned  with  reduced  benefits  from 
poverty reduction. Nutrition data on key indicators for 2014 also reveal a complex picture with 
some Provinces on Sulawesi Island scoring significantly lower than the national average. 
58. 
59. 
In preparation for the selection of new READ SI districts in Sulawesi, a short-list of 35 districts 
with  poverty  rates  higher  than  the  national  average,  as  well  as  low  scores  on  food  security, 
connectivity and human development has been compiled and is presented in Appendix 2. 
In summary, the new and old districts in Sulawesi combined with the old READ districts in NTT 
and West  Kalimantan  present  diverse  development  challenges  that  reflect  those  experienced 
across  Indonesia  and  are  therefore  an  ideal  setting  to  test  and  refine  a  rural  development 
approach for nationwide scaling up.

63.  READ  SI  will  maintain  the  core  set  of  integrated  activities  in  programme  villages  that  are 
acknowledged  as  the  foundations  of  the  original  READ  success.  Building  on  these,  the 
component structure will be re-organized to better enable the advancement of complementary

Final programme design report 
aspects  of  the  READ  model  outside  the  villages  as  well  as  the  move  to  a  programmatic 
approach  capable  of  being  scaled-up  in  a  wider  range  of  local  settings.  The  READ  SI 
components are outlined below: 
Component 1: Village agriculture and livelihoods development (loan financed and 
implemented by MoA) 
64.  Component  1  is  the  core  of  the  programme,  both  conceptually  and  in  terms  of  direct  impacts 
and  accounts  for  around  57.8%  of  programme  investments.  The  Component  focuses  on  the 
proven  READ  approach  of  community  mobilization  closely  integrated  with  agriculture  and 
livelihood  development  within  programme  villages  with  Village  Facilitators  and  technical 
extension staff working hand in hand in each village. It includes all activities within the villages. 
65.  For presentational and budgeting purposes only, the elements of the integrated village process 
are  summarized  below  around  the  four  complementary  dimensions  which  will  run  in  parallel 
with the programme supported households and common interest groups  
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii)  Savings, loans and financial literacy 
(iv)  Nutrition, including early childhood nutrition (i.e. "the first 1000 days") 
Community mobilization 
Agriculture and livelihoods 
66.  Around 70% of READ SI villages are expected to be "new" READ SI villages while around 30% 
will  be  "original"  villages  that  were  also  part  of  READ.  READ  SI  will  adopt  a  differentiated 
intervention strategy between new and old villages. 
67.  The  four  dimensions  above  will  remain  relevant  to  all  READ  SI  villages,  however  the  original 
READ villages will be at a more advanced stage of development in terms of the thematic focus 
areas and so will be supported with a selected set of more advanced interventions, which are 
summarized  at  the  end  of  this  section.  This  will  enable  these  advanced  interventions  to  be 
tested and refined in a limited  number of villages before being rolled-out  later to new  villages 
which will enable READ to continue to innovate around emerging critical issues while delivering 
strong impacts with increasing efficiency in new villages. 
(i)  Community mobilization 
68.  Community  mobilization  is  the  "glue"  at  the  heart  of  the  READ  approach  that  enables 
programme  supported  households  to  take  full  advantage  of  the  range  of  technical  and  other 
support  provided.  It  ensures  that  programme  households  fully  understand  the  opportunities 
presented by the programme as well as the obligations and responsibilities for those who chose 
to  join  the  programme.  It  enables  the  scope  of  programme  activities  within  each  village  to  be 
adjusted  and  balanced  to  respond  to  the  real  agricultural  and  livelihood  priorities  of  the 
households.  It  is  central  to  the  aspirations  and  activities  on  nutrition,  where  social  norms  and 
behavioural issues are central to improving nutrition. It creates additional social capital, via the 
agriculture and livelihood groups, to amplify poorer households' voices within the wider village 
development process. It also creates a safe space for poorer households to learn vital financial 
literacy skills, begin to practice good financial disciplines and gradually start using mainstream 
financial services.  
69.  Community mobilization will facilitate programme activities being delivered in ways which make 
them most accessible and valuable to the women and men participating rather  than just to be 
most convenient for the programme teams delivering the services and activities. In short, it puts 
the farmers and households at the very heart of READ SI.  
70. 
In  putting  small  farmers  at  the  heart  of  the  programme,  it  also  places  responsibility  on  the 
farmers  themselves  to  lead  their  own  development  –  marking  an  important  break  from  many 
previous government interventions in the agriculture sector, which provide generous subsidies 
and  handouts  but  ultimately  create  dependency  and  do  not  truly  empower  small  farmers.  An 
9 
Republic of Indonesia 
Rural Empowerment and Agricultural Development Programme Scaling-up Initiative (READ SI) 
Final programme design report 
important objective of the community mobilization work in READ SI is to facilitate this transition 
from dependency and expectation to empowerment and ownership among small farmers. 
71.  The transition process to the empowered farming will include, amongst other provisions, small 
targeted  input  packages,  effective  technical  assistance,  support  for  savings  and  rewards  for 
good performance. It aims to convince by demonstration that small farmers can be sustainably 
empowered  and  create  a  safe  space  for  risk  averse  household  to  try  new  approaches  -  for 
example on their farms or in terms of using financial services.  
72. 
In new programme villages, activities will begin with an initial process of community mobilization 
to  introduce  the  READ  SI  programme  and  then  facilitate  the  voluntary  selection  of  interested 
and eligible households into the programme. An extensive socialisation and Participatory Rural 
Appraisal (PRA) process, building on lessons from READ, will ensure that all poor households 
are given the opportunity to participate. The participatory identification of poor households will 
include  the  identification  of  production  constraints  particular  to  the  poor  in  each  village  and 
therefore allow initial analysis of relevant agricultural and livelihoods interventions. In addition, 
social mobilisation by hamlet will ensure that all parts of the community, including hamlets that 
may  be  relatively  remote  and  populated  by  minorities,  migrants  or  indigenous  peoples,  are 
included.  
73.  Households and individuals choosing to join the programme will be facilitated into self-selected 
common interest groups organized around one of the thematic agriculture or livelihoods areas 
(see below). These common interest groups will receive  a comprehensive package of training 
and  support  on  their  particular  agricultural  or  livelihood  focus  (e.g.  rice,  cocoa,  homestead 
gardening)  as  well  as  savings  and  credit  activities,  including  financial  and  business  literacy 
training. Nutrition activities, especially those on early childhood nutrition, will also be organized 
in part through these common interest groups.  
74.  Village facilitators will lead the community mobilization and will work closely with the extension 
officers (PPLs) with the support of the village head (Kepala Desa). Community mobilization with 
and around the groups will continue through the  programme duration in the villages to ensure 
interventions  remain  relevant  and  accessible  and  that  households  and  individuals  continue  to 
actively  participate.  Promoting  the  mobilisation  and  organisational  capacity  of  groups 
representing the poorest members of the selected villages is important in the context of recent 
policies that place significant financial resources for development at the village level, including 
the new Village Law14.  
75.  Collective  empowerment  of  farmers  will  take  place  at  three  levels:  Musrenbang/participatory 
community  planning  of  productive  infrastructure,  bulk  purchases  of  inputs  and  services,  and 
economies  of  scale  for  sale  of  fermented  cocoa.  Regarding  Musrenbang15/participatory 
community  planning  of  productive 
to  social 
mobilization leads to increased levels of confidence and social cohesion of farmers who will be 
able to influence and present a business case for infrastructure funding as currently rolled out 
under  the  Village  Law  and  other  GoI  programmes.  Regarding  bulk  purchases  of  inputs  and 
services,  a  pilot  will  be  launched  using  some  of  the  best  cocoa  commodity  groups  to 
complement  the  role  of  the  Cocoa  Doctors  in  this  domain.  Regarding  economies  of  scale  for 
sale  of  fermented  cocoa,  the  fermentation  process  currently  represents  the  most  obvious 
infrastructure,  READ’s  proven  approach 
14 The Village Law (no 6/2014) avails villages funds equal to 10 percent of the state budget earmarked for regional 
administration, transferred on a yearly basis, starting with 3 percent in the first year, and reaching 10 percent in 2017. 
For 2015 this means that each village will on average received Rp750 million ($60,000), while in 2017 and 2019 the 
funds are estimated at IDR 1.4 billion (USD 136,000) and IDR 2.4 billion (USD190,000) respectively. The spending 
guidelines indicate that 70% of these funds should be utilized for infrastructure development, while the remaining 30% 
should be spent on economic activities. Funds are disbursed based on the submission of community development 
plans and managed by the Village Head. 
15Musyawarah Rencana Pembangunan or Multi Stakeholder Consultation Forum for Development Planning was 
formalised through Law No. 25/2004 on National Development Planning at all levels of government over three time 
frames – long-term, medium-term and annual plans.

opportunity  to  “shift  value  upstream”  in  the  cocoa  value  chain  and  a  pilot  will  be  launched  to 
federate  cocoa  groups  for  aggregating  their  fermented  produce  for  sale  at  community  level. 
With respect to both activities, bulk sales of inputs and of fermented cocoa, READ SI will work 
through  its  community  facilitators  with  PPLs  to  encourage  cocoa  commodity  groups  to  join  or 
set  up  village  level  federations  (Asosiasi  Petani  Perkebunan)  as  well  as  larger  federations  of 
farmer organisations and/or cooperatives (KUD/Koperasi Perkebunan). These decisions cannot 
be  pre-scheduled  ahead  of  time  as  they  need  to  be  based  on  the  maturing  of  a  sound 
conviction  on  the  part  of  farmers  that  there  is  an  important  business-related  function  for  such 
higher  level  aggregation  and  such  activities  must  be  implemented  at  the  pace  of  the  farmers 
and not be rushed in order to meet predetermined M&E output targets. 
(ii)  Agriculture and livelihoods 
76.  Following  the  successful  READ  model,  each  of  the  thematic  common  interest  groups  will  be 
provided  with  a  comprehensive  package  of  support  in  their  chosen  product  or  activities.  The 
choice  of  product  or  activities  of  the  common  interest  groups  is  expected  to  be  driven  by  the 
farmers themselves and fall into one of the following categories: 
(i)  annual crops 
(ii) estate crops 
(iii) integrated homestead gardening 
(iv) livestock (before MTR only in NTT, possible scale up post-MTR)) 
(v) off-farm income activities 
77.  For agriculture, the support package will include: 
(i)  Technical  training  delivered  through  farmer  fields  schools  (FFS)  -  as  well  as  technical 
aspects, such as concepts of "farming as a business" looking at the household economics of 
the different options as well as considerations of responding to market demands. 
(ii) Trial  plots  ("demplots")  for  farmers  to  see  first-hand  the  difference  between,  for  example, 
different combination of seeds, nutrition and management practices.  
(iii) Farmer  field  days,  exchange  visits  and  systematic  follow-up  by  village  facilitators  and 
extension staff will also be used to reinforce learning and confidence of farmers in adopting 
improved  production  and  post-harvest  practices.  An  important  dimension  here  will  be  to 
encourage self-learning and farmer to farmer knowledge sharing. This will in part be enabled 
by  farmers  being  supported  to  keep  farm  record  books  so  they  can  compare  experience 
from year to year and with their friends and neighbours to learn for themselves what gives 
the best results. 
(iv) Small  start-up  packages  of  quality  inputs  (seeds,  fertilizer,  planting  materials  etc.)  will  be 
provided to farmers as grants as part of the initial FFS to facilitate immediate application of 
the  promoted  technologies  to  build  confidence  among  farmers.  The  start-up  grants  will  be 
provided  on  the  condition  that  they  are  used  to  adopt  the  promoted  techniques  and 
packages on the household farms. Compliance will be ensured by the grants being provided 
using mutual guarantee mechanisms in small groups of 4-6 farmers from within the farmer 
field schools (FFS) to ensure adoption of trained techniques and practices as agreed.  The 
maximum  value  of  start-up  grants  will  vary  depending  on  the  crop/livelihood  but  are 
expected to be  in the range of USD250-350 per household and  will comply  with prevailing 
government  regulations  on  grants.  In  exceptional  cases  some  start-up  packages  will  be 
provided in-kind, for example goats.  
Ongoing routine access to quality inputs and services for farmers will be facilitated through a 
combination  of  savings and credit  development  (to provide  better access to  the necessary 
finance)  and  upgrading  of  the  local  input  and  services  markets  especially  for  the  flagship 
commodities of rice and cocoa (see below). 
11 
Republic of Indonesia 
Rural Empowerment and Agricultural Development Programme Scaling-up Initiative (READ SI) 
Final programme design report 
(v) Support  to  investments  in  machinery  and  small  infrastructure  linked  to  the  selected  crops 
(see below). 
78.  FFS  will  be  organized  into  classes  of  not  more  than  25  farmers  with  priority  for  attendance 
given to group members.  Farmers from programme households  will  be able to  attend training 
under more than one FFS, subject to availability of space, but will only receive the start-up input 
package for one of the crops of their choosing. Where not all places on the FFS are taken up by 
READ SI households, non-programme households will be invited to join on a voluntary basis. 
79. 
In  order  to  balance  the  need  for  quality  and  consistency  of  FFSs  while  responding  to  the 
interests of different farmers in varying agro-ecological zones between different districts, READ 
SI  will  initially  offer  FFS  in  each  district  on  up  to  5  key  crops  plus  integrated  homestead 
gardening.  The  5  FFS  crops  may  be  different  between  districts  and  will  be  selected  in  each 
district  directly  based  on  demand  from  the  participating  READ  SI  farmers. As  flagship  crops, 
rice  and  cocoa  are  expected  to  be  demanded  in  all  districts  in  Sulawesi  with  other  crops 
expected  to  be  in  demand  including  maize,  soy,  cloves  and  copra.  In  the  border  districts  of 
West Kalimantan and East Nusa Tenggara (NTT), crops will be adjusted to each location with a 
mix of subsistence and commercial crops. In NTT, the flagship crops/products will be rice and 
livestock.  Where district teams demonstrate that they have delivered the initial FFS to a high 
standard,  i.e.  with  high  adoption  rates  of  >75%  of  trained  farmers,  then  they  will  be  given 
greater freedom and resources to develop and offer  additional FFS on a wider range of crops 
and livestock in response to farmer demand. 
80. 
Integrated homestead gardening groups will be particularly focused towards women, with only 
women  eligible  to  participate  in  the  savings  and  credit  activities  embedded  in  these  groups. 
There will also be a concentration of nutrition activities linked to these groups. Men interested to 
attend  the  FFS  training  on  integrated  homestead  gardening  will  be  welcomed  to  do  so. 
Integrated  homestead  gardening  is  expected  to  include  production  of  vegetables,  small  fish 
ponds  and  small  livestock  –  initially  focused  on  home  consumption  but  also  recognizing  that 
some farmers may increasingly sell surplus into the local market.  
81. 
In  addition  to  training  and  starter  input  packages,  the  programme  will  also  provide  support  to 
investment  in  agricultural  machinery  and  small  infrastructure  linked  to  production.  Support  to 
agricultural machinery is outlined under Component 1.3 (see para  86(iii) below).   
82.  For  small  productive  infrastructure,  READ  SI  will  support  investment  of  approximately 
IDR100 million  per  village  only  in  new  villages.  The  infrastructure  investments  will  be 
implemented in the second and third years of programme activity in the village and not before. 
The infrastructure investment will be implemented as two IDR50 million allocations and comply 
with  GoI  regulations  on  participatory  infrastructure  investment,  with  beneficiary  contributions 
allowed  in-kind.  The  process  will  involve  participatory  decision  making  in  the  selection  and 
planning  of  the  works,  community  planning  for  sustainable  O&M  arrangements,  community 
supervision  of  construction  and  public  community  audit  of  works  and  expenditures  after 
completion. VFs will be trained to facilitate all steps of this process. Disbursement of funds will 
be  via  the  Village  Account,  under  the  supervision  of  the  Village  Head.  It  is  hoped  that  the 
participatory planning and decision making process used for this will demonstrate to the Village 
Head  and  other  village  stakeholders  an  effective  and  efficient  local  participatory  planning 
process that may be relevant to other similar plans, such as those for the Village Fund provided 
for  under  the  Village  Law.  If  there  is  interest  from  the  Village  Head  and  village  community  to 
build  on  this  approach  for  wider  use  in  the  village,  then  the  VF  will  be  made  available  to  the 
village  to  actively  support  this  process  under  the  guidance  of  the  Village  Head  and  with 
backstopping from the Social Mobilization (SM) supervisors in the sub-district. 
83. 
Livestock  will  be  a  group  based  activity,  mostly  aimed  at  poor  women,  and  initially  only 
promoted in NTT. Half of the members will receive 1  year female animals and  after 3 kidding 
cycles,  will  pass  the  original  females  onto  the  other  members.  To  avoid  conflict  within  the 
12 
Republic of Indonesia 
Rural Empowerment and Agricultural Development Programme Scaling-up Initiative (READ SI) 
Final programme design report 
village,  goat  management  will  be  on  the  basis  of  “cut  and  carry”  feeding.  All  members  will 
receive animal health, husbandry and nutrition training as well as a starter pack of fodder seed 
and fertilizer. In addition, a team of animal health and production technicians will be trained and 
fielded on the basis of one technician per 3 villages. (see sub-component 2.5) 
84.  Non-farm livelihood activities  will also be supported based on the experience from the original 
READ  model  to  provide  opportunities  for  households  with  minimal  agricultural  land.  In  an 
evolution  of  the  READ  approach  in  this  area,  non-farm  livelihood  opportunities  will  be 
addressed in a more selective way based on credible local market opportunities. As such, non-
farm livelihood activities are not expected to be implemented in all villages, but only those with 
credible market opportunities for specific non-farm products or services. 
(iii)  Savings, loan and financial literacy 
85.  Affordable  seasonal  and  investment  finance,  whether  from  Community-Based  Financial 
Organizations  (CBFOs)  or  other  Financial  Service  Providers  (FSP),  as  loans  or  from  own 
savings, is vital if households are to be able to invest in improving their farming and household 
enterprises  to  raise  incomes  and  take  the  opportunities  presented  by  READ  SI’s  technical 
support.  Yet,  at  present,  there  are  substantial  gaps  between  farmers  and  FSPs,  limiting  the 
capacity of large numbers of households to invest to fulfil their potential. READ SI will work to 
bridge this gap using a three-pronged attack to strengthen demand, supply and intermediation 
(or direct channels) to link the two, through: 
(i)  strengthen  household  demand  and  confidence  in  using  mainstream  financial  services, 
including  savings,  loans  and  other  financial  services,  primarily  through  improvements  in 
individual financial literacy and good household financial disciplines; 
(ii) strengthen 
local 
financial 
the  capacity  and 
inclusiveness of CBFOs and local micro finance institutions (MFIs) at group, village or sub-
district  level  that  can  help  aggregate  demand  and  supply  of  financial  services  at  the  local 
level in some communities; and 
intermediation  mechanisms,  especially 
(iii) strengthen supply of financial services from banks and MFIs into READ SI villages, through 
partnerships  (mostly  at  the  local  district  or  provincial  level)  to  improve  their  outreach  to 
READ  SI  groups  and  households  and  their  confidence  and  willingness  to  serve  them  with 
their existing range of products and services (provided that their existing range of products 
and services match with READ SI’s activities). (See Sub-component 2.2) 
86.  The programme will therefore implement activities in four main areas: 
(i)  Financial literacy: Financial literacy16 (FL) is the foundation of greater financial inclusion. FL 
training will be delivered to the groups mobilized as outlined in Sub-component 1.1 on Social 
Mobilization  and  will  be  conducted  in  all  READ  SI  villages.  The  training  will  take  a  very 
practical  approach  and  will  be  closely  integrated  with  the  agricultural  and  livelihoods 
technical  training  –  using  the  focus  crops  and  activities  of  the  groups  as  the  basis  for 
learning  and  practicing  financial  literacy  skills.  The  FL  training  will  be  conducted  on  a 
voluntary  basis  in  the  initial  twelve  months  of  implementation  in  each  village.  It  will  be 
delivered  via the  Village Facilitator (VFs) and social  mobilisation teams through a cascade 
approach  in  which  the  VFs  help  the  READ  SI  mobilized  groups  to  select  one  of  their  own 
members to act as Financial Literacy Facilitators (FLFs). These are typically local residents, 
often women, who have done well at school and live in the village on a long term basis. The 
16 The term Financial Literacy can have different scope in different countries and contexts. For the purposes of the 
READ SI PDR, the term is used in its broad sense of numeracy, financial literacy, household economy and basic 
business literacy for household enterprise as well as financial negotiation. For the Indonesian reader, it is recognized 
that the common understanding regarding financial literacy (FL) and financial inclusion concerns the knowledge about 
financial institutions and their products and not household economy and also not business finance management. FL 
includes also consumer protection issues.  See: OJK http://www.ojk.go.id/id/kanal/edukasi-dan-perlindungan-
konsumen/Pages/Literasi-Keuangan.aspx 
13

Rural Empowerment and Agricultural Development Programme Scaling-up Initiative (READ SI) 
Final programme design report 
scope  of  the  financial  literacy  training  will  cover  different  modules  to  ensure  the  follow 
aspects are covered: 
i. 
ii. 
iii. 
Household economy, a field in which NGOs are active; 
Financial  institutions  and  their  products,  the  typical  FL  training  as  promoted  by 
Indonesia’s Financial Services Authority OJK and implemented by banks; 
Identifying and assessing investment opportunities, which might be designed and 
introduced by the Provincial Finance Advisors (PFA) in cooperation with 
participating banks. In a similar context, the Konsultan Keuangan Mitra Bank 
(KKMB), one of Bank Indonesia (BI)’s efforts to promote bank loans to micro, small 
and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs), assisted MSMEs in writing project 
proposals. KKMBs are business development service providers who link MSMEs 
with feasible investment opportunities with banks. 
(ii) Saving and loans: In the few villages where there are existing, well managed CBFOs (e.g. 
LKM-A  or  other  village-based/community-owned  organizations  including  sharia  compliant 
models),  who  serve  some  READ  SI  target  households  and  are  motivated  to  serve  more, 
READ  SI  will  facilitate  programme  households  to  join  these  CBFOs  and/or  begin  using 
savings  and  loans.  However,  it  is  expected  that  in  most  READ  SI  villages  active  CBFOs 
capable and willing to serve READ SI households to be absent. 
In  the  majority  of  villages,  those  without  already  suitable  well-managed  CBFOs,  READ  SI 
will promote small-scale savings and loans activities as a second focal activity within all the 
READ  SI commodity  and livelihood groups mobilized  under Sub-Components 1.1 and  1.2. 
The purpose of the  Savings and Credit Groups (SCGs) is to create a safe space in  which 
members  can  practice  and  become  more  confident  savers  and  borrowers  and  start  to 
practice  better  financial  behaviours  and  household  financial  disciplines,  for  example  with 
regular savings, no matter how small the amount. Loans are primarily expected to be very 
small  productive  loans  or  for  social  or  emergency  purposes.  It  is  not  expected  that  these 
SCG activities, with funds generated by the members only, will be a primary source of loans 
for seasonal finance or investment in farm or non-farm activities.  
The SCG activities will be based on self-help group principles and will follow  the approach 
promoted in READ in terms of group management, meeting protocols, internal governance 
and record keeping. Members of SCGs or mature groups that develop to become formal co-
operatives may also be linked to mainstream banks once their groups are mature (see Sub-
component 2.2) as was the intention at the end of READ.  The SCGs will be savings-led in 
an effort to raise sustainability and READ SI will not provide lending capital either in cash or 
kind (in contrast to the approach adopted in READ). 
(iii) Machinery investment: In addition to technical and business planning advice, READ SI will 
promote  the  use  of  small  equipment  and  machinery  that  will  improve  the  welfare  of  the 
group  members.  The  programme  will  make  best  use  of  limited  resources  and  increase 
sustainability by not handing over the equipment free of charge.  
For  basic  equipment,  such  as  tractors,  threshers  and  village/mobile  mills,  READ  SI  will 
offer  small  equipment  and  machinery  grants  to  groups  that  have  demonstrated  good 
performance  over  the  first  two  years  of  activities,  e.g.  in  SCG  activity  or  adoption  of 
demonstrated production technologies. The grant  will be for approximately  one  third  of the 
cost  of  the  proposed  equipment  and  machinery.  There  will  be  a  cap  on  the  total  grant 
provided  per  group  (approx.  USD  3800  per  group).  Based  on  business  plans,  grant  funds 
may be provided to the groups as a whole or to sub-sets of members that are prepared to 
invest in setting up these machinery service enterprises. The effect of introducing equipment 
can be tripled if the groups or individuals contribute with two thirds to the investment costs, 
14

Final programme design report 
thus allowing up to 75% [or even 100%] bank financing based on a collateral value assumed 
to be 50% [66%]).  
For  advanced  equipment,  such  as  harvesters,  transplanters  and  driers,  it  is  recognized 
that  banks  and  MFIs  are  unlikely  to  extend  finance  at  present.  As  such  READ  SI  will 
implement  a  scheme  in  which  the  programme  offers  these  equipment  for  time-limited  test 
trials (e.g. one year) or based on rent/leasing contracts to its groups that have demonstrated 
good  performance  over  the  first  two  years  of  activities,  e.g.  in  SCG  activity  or  adoption  of 
demonstrated production technologies.  After the test-trials, the equipment will be offered to 
the  groups  using it  for purchase at preferential conditions. In  the event they choose not to 
purchase  it,  it  will  be  passed  on  to  another  group  for  a  new  time-limited  trial  on  the  same 
basis  until  it  is  bought  by  one  of  the  groups.  Details  on  type  and  number  of  equipment  as 
well  as  detailed  procedures  will  be  developed  as  part  of  the  detailed  PIM  preparation  and 
ensure  compliance  with  Indonesian  budget  regulations17.  This  approach  to  advanced 
machinery  investment  promotion  will  first  be  piloted  in  old  READ  SI  villages  in  Yr  1  and  2 
before  being  rolled-out  to  the  rest  of  the  programme  if  successful  (subject  to  budget 
availability). 
(iv) Strengthening of existing CBFOs and LKM-A. Where they exist, the most compelling option 
for improving access to financial service is to strengthen existing LKM-A and other village-
based/community/member-owned organizations (including Sharia compliant models such as 
Baitul  Maal  wat  Tamwil,  BMT).  Such  strengthening  would  include,  for  example,  support  to 
become  a  MFI  according  to  Law  1/2013  on  MFIs  or  a  cooperative  as  well  as  establishing 
bank  linkages  for  a  range  of  financial  services  and  refinancing  CBFO  funds  and  including 
mobile/digital financial services.  
For each identified CBFOs with credible potential to increase provision of inclusive financial 
services  in  its  community,  the  District  Finance  Advisors  (DFA)  will  conduct  a  capacity 
assessment and jointly develop and support the implementation of a capacity building plan. 
In doing so, the DFA will work closely with the district agencies responsible for micro-finance 
supervisions as well as the READ SI social mobilisation team.  
There will be a particular focus on supporting the concerned CBFOs to qualify and apply for 
registration  as  MFIs  under  OJK  or  under  the  MoCSME  to  set  up  a  linkage  with  a  bank  or 
specialist financing institution for refinancing, including associated capacity building in order 
to  increase  linkage  potential  for  the  CBFOs.  Support  from  READ  SI  may  also  include 
assistance  in  completing  formal  registration  with  OJK,  if  appropriate,  and  the  provision  of 
some  limited  quantities  of  equipment  necessary  for  improved  management  practices  (e.g. 
laptops, printers and other relevant equipment).  
(iv)  Nutrition   
87.  Nutrition  will  receive  a  more  explicit  focus  under  READ  SI  in  recognition  of  the  high  levels  of 
child malnutrition despite rising incomes and improving aggregate food availability. While READ 
SI will place a greater emphasis on nutrition, it is recognized that there is no single solution to 
tackle  these  problems.  Yet  the  fact  that  malnutrition  rates  remain  unchanged  despite  rising 
incomes and food availability give some clues that some of the remaining constraints to better 
nutrition are driven by social norms and behaviours. 
88.  READ  SI  will  therefore  adopt  a  multi-pronged  approach  to  improving  nutrition.  It  will  also 
encourage local innovation combined with evidence-based assessment to identify and scale-up 
promising  innovations  in  the  approaches  to  improving  nutrition.  Nutrition  activities  will  be 
conducted in all READ SI villages coordinated by the Village Facilitators, including for example: 
17 At the time of writing, current regulations mean that GoI may hand over equipment free of charge (donation) to 
farmers groups but not lease it for a test period and sell it without following established procedures (public auctioning).

(ii) 
technical awareness raising and training on relevant knowledge concerning good nutrition 
practices,  food  stuffs  etc.,  tailored  to  the  local  social-agricultural  context  given  the  food 
stuff  available  in  different  seasons  that  can  form  a  part  of  balanced  and  healthy  diet  for 
different members of the family - from the very young to the very old; 
integrated  homestead  gardening  promotion,  extension  and  starter  input  packages  (see 
Sub-Component  1.2)  to  increase  the  convenience  and  year  round  availability  of 
supplementary  vegetables  and  other  foods  (e.g.  fish,  eggs)  to  improve  the  quality  of  the 
dietary mix. The IFAD How To Do Note18 is a useful reference for these activities. (FFS to 
be led by PPLs) 
(iii)  women's  group  mobilization  to  strengthen  social  capital,  around  SCG,  integrated 
gardening and nutrition. Within these groups, the programme will foster mother to mother 
mutual support which is expected to lead to ongoing mother and child groups (with rolling 
membership  over  time)  for  more  intensive  mutual  support  and  from  the  programme  and 
other  health  providers.  This  will  be  harmonized  with  other  ongoing  government  maternal 
and child health initiatives in the villages; and 
(iv)  social  marketing  approaches  to  change  the  aspirational  and  social  status  of  good 
childhood  nutrition  to  motivate  behavioural  changes  –  e.g.  cooking  competition,  prizes, 
village level awards for whole village performance, awards from Bupati (district mayor) at 
big events etc. 
89.  READ SI  is expected to  place a particular focus on the most critical period  of early childhood 
and  ante-natal  nutrition  –  from  conception  to  24  months,  the  so  called  "first  1000  days". With 
this  focus  the  district  teams,  and  social  mobilisation  and  VF  teams  in  particular,  will  develop, 
test  and  evaluate  innovative  social  marketing  and  other  approaches  to  improving  early 
childhood and ante-natal nutrition. These activities will focus on households with young children 
and  recently  married  couples  in  the  whole  village  (and  not  general  activities  with  READ  SI 
households  without  young  children).  The  intent  is  that  the  village  level  systems  which  are 
developed  should  be  self-sustaining  without  significant  on-going  programme  support  once 
established.  Consequently,  all  activities  should  be  designed  to  be  minimal  (though  not 
necessarily zero) cost activities that can largely be continued by the community themselves to 
increase longer term sustainability. 
90.  Given  the  complexity  of  the  nutrition  challenge,  READ  SI  will  actively  encourage  and  reward 
local innovation by teams in districts to work out what combination of factors works best. These 
teams will be given freedom to develop and test different combinations of nutrition interventions 
combined with very close monitoring of results using three additional indicators tracked at least 
once per quarter to get rapid learning and feedback - both for the programme and also for the 
mothers involved on what is working and the progress they are making: 
(i)  stunting level of children (height for age) 
(ii) incidence of diarrhoea in children  
(iii) dietary diversity (measured by using a simple tool to categorize food stuffs eaten in the 
previous 24 hours) 
Component 2: Services, inputs and market linkages (loan financed and implemented by MoA) 
91.  This Component deals with the key service delivery systems, especially at the district level and 
the associated systems at higher levels, and covers four key services, each addressed under a 
sub-component. This  is  an  area  of  greater  focus  for  READ  SI  and  is  intended  to  improve  the 
performance  and  service  delivery  of  these  key  services  in  a  more  sustainable  way.  It  is  a 
compliment  to  the  farmer-centred  activities  in  Component  1  and  not  a  driver.  It  represents 
around 15% of total programme budget, with a majority of this targeted towards upgrading the 
public  extension  services  -  both  in  terms  skills  and  some  infrastructure  -  directly  supporting

Rural Empowerment and Agricultural Development Programme Scaling-up Initiative (READ SI) 
Final programme design report 
READ SI activities in Component 1. The activities under each sub-component will be primarily 
managed and coordinated by the relevant technical staff in the NPMO.  
92.  The five sub-components each correspond to a key service or support market and are: 
2.1 Agricultural extension service (all districts) 
2.2 Financial services (all districts) 
2.3 Seed supply markets and system (all districts) 
2.4 Cocoa farmer support services and markets (Sulawesi only) 
2.5 Livestock production and health services and markets (NTT only before MTR) 
93.  For  West  Kalimantan,  once  the  second  flagship  commodity  has  been  chosen  to  complement 
rice, additional activities to support the associate service and input market development will be 
programmed through the AWPB process and implemented in West Kalimantan districts. 
(i)  Agricultural extension services 
94.  To  support  the  extension  activities  under  Component  1  and  also  to  improve  the  overall 
agricultural  extension  and  HR  development  capacity  in  MoA,  READ SI  will  implement  an 
upgrading programme for extension services in programme districts, upgrading skills and also 
extension facilities. There will also be investment in the overall extension and HR development 
system  coordinated  by  AAEHRD  under  its  mandate  within  MoA,  including  the  Agricultural 
Training Centres (ATC) at Kupang and Makassar as well as the provincial training centres that 
exist in the programme provinces. Major activities will include: 
(i) 
HR skills, knowledge and training 
-  Extension officer (PPL) skills refresher training 
-  Review and revision of ATC extension training to be more relevant to farmer 
needs 
-  Farmer extension materials review, improvement and production – all crops. 
(ATC) 
Facilities upgrading 
(ii) 
-  Sub-district extension offices upgrade 
-  ATC facilities upgrade – subject to agreement to be more demand responsive. 
(ii)  Financial services 
95.  To  compliment  activities  focused  on  the  demand  for  mainstream  financial  services  under 
Component  1,  this  sub-component  will  work  with  banks  and  MFIs  to  improve  the  supply  and 
accessibility  of financial services  in READ  SI  villages and  districts. This  will  include  four main 
areas of activity:  
(i)  Financial  service  baseline  survey  in  each  district,  to  identify  current  FSPs,  products, 
coverage etc. 
(ii) Financial  Service  Provider  Partnerships  with  those  FSPs  that  have  the  most  dominant 
presence in rural areas, namely BRI, BPDs and in some selected areas with BPRs that have 
established a dense network of outlets. In each location, READ SI will collaborate with the 
partner  FSPs  to  extend  their  existing  schemes  and  services  to  the  programme's  target 
farmers.  These  will  be  mostly  locally-driven  partnerships,  with  READ  SI  working  with  local 
branch  and  regional  manager  to  identify  and  remove  barriers  that  are  holding  back 
increased lending and service by the partner bank into programme villages and households. 
While  operationally  driven  at  the  local  level,  these  will  be  within  an  overall  framework 
coordinated with senior managers of the banks at provincial or national level, as appropriate. 
(iii) Collaboration with OJK focusing on two areas:  
i. 
LKM-A Registration and Strengthening: READ SI will support the joint programme 
of OJK and Ministry of Agriculture (under the Directorate of Agricultural Finance 
(DAF) under DG PSP) to support the application, registration and strengthening of 
the savings and credit units (LKM-A) of qualifying farmers groups and farmer 
17 
Republic of Indonesia 
Rural Empowerment and Agricultural Development Programme Scaling-up Initiative (READ SI) 
Final programme design report 
group associations (Gapoktan). READ SI's teams will collaborate with the teams 
from OJK and DAF in programme districts to identify active CBFOs and support 
them in their choice to register as cooperative MFI or PT MFI and qualify for 
government support.  
ii. 
Strengthening  district  level  microfinance  supervisory  agencies  by  OJK:  These 
activities  will  be  coordinated  with  similar  activities  under  IPDMIP  with  OJK,  with 
READ SI taking primary responsibility (including funding) for the collaboration with 
OJK in its programme districts.  
(iv) Agricultural  Insurance  Promotion  in  partnership  with  MoA's  DAF  in  order  to  extend  the 
coverage  and  use  of  farm  insurance  products  by  smallholders.  DAF  launched  new  farm 
insurance  products  for  rice  and  livestock  in  October  2015.  They  hope  to  extend  farm 
insurance to cover additional crops and livestock. READ SI will collaborate and support DAF 
to develop, market test and promote suitable insurance products. Consideration will also be 
given  to  the  feasibility  of  farm  insurance  products  for  cocoa  orchard  replanting  and 
rehabilitation. 
(iii)  Seed supply markets and system 
96.  Reliable supply of affordable quality genetics is essential for farmers to be able to sustain good 
yields over the long term. Component 1 will provide some  initial quality seed to farmers in the 
FFS  on  rice  and  other  main  annual  crops  (e.g.  soy,  maize)  so  they  can  immediately  put  their 
new  knowledge  into  practice.  This  sub-component  will  complement  that  initial  starter-input 
package  by  working  with  progressive  seed-multiplication  farmers  groups  and  key  agencies  to 
strengthen the system of local seed multiplication and sale to farmers in their area.  
97.  The  READ  SI  design  sees  this  system  as  a  4  step  process:  (i)  breeding;  (ii)  multiplying;  (iii) 
distributing  high  quality  seed;  and  (iv)  providing  credible  assurance  to  farmers  that  the  seed 
they are using is of a consistently high standard. All parts of this system need to work well if the 
whole system is to serve farmers’ needs. Elite and multiplier farmers will be the primary actors 
in  the  two-step  multiplying  stages  of  this  process.  Breeders  seed  will  be  sourced  from  the 
Indonesian  Rice  Research  Institute  and  distributed  to  provincial  BPTPs  (Assessment  Institute 
for Agricultural  Technology  for  Indonesia)  who  will  oversee  the  multiplication  process.  BPTPs 
will  be  supported  by  BPP  (sub-district  extension  units)  extension  staff  while  distribution 
arrangements  will  be  managed  by  BBI.  Technical  support  will  be  provided  to  the  multiplier 
farmers  in  each  district,  for  a  period  of  at  least  three  full  production  cycles  to  ensure  quality 
production systems are well established.  
98.  After  the  initial  injection  of  quality  seed  at  the  programmes  expense,  rice  farmers  will  be 
expected to purchase F-4 extension ("blue") grade seed from the multiplier farmers who will in 
turn purchase F-3 grade ("purple") seed from elite multiplier farmers – thus ensuring sufficient 
and reliable supply as well as financial sustainability.  
99.  Seed  will  be  available  to  farmers  as  labelled,  certified  seed  backed  by  an  enhanced  seed 
certification  system  strengthened  by  the  programme.  All  seed  produced  by  multiplier  farmers 
will be subject to GoI seed certification according to MoA regulations (including MoA Regulation 
No.56/2015)  –  including  field  inspections  and  germination  testing.  To  build  a  high  degree  of 
confidence  among  farmer  and  programme  managers,  random  samples  of  seed  will  be 
independently  verified  by  grade  and  certified  to  minimum  standards  of  90%  purity  and  90% 
germination  and  compared  to  BPSP/MoA  test  results.  Only  once  seed  has  been  tested  and 
verified can the relevant label be applied. This service will operate as a fee based service, paid 
for by the grower of the sample being tested.  
100.  READ  SI  will  also  have  activities  to  improve  the  availability  of  hermetic  storage  drums  by 
working with local input and equipment suppliers to increase availability while at the same time 
18

Rural Empowerment and Agricultural Development Programme Scaling-up Initiative (READ SI) 
Final programme design report 
promoting demand through initial demonstrations and some samples provided to farmers to test 
for themselves. 
(iv)  Cocoa farmer support services and markets 
101.  The  ultimate  objective  is  to  substantially  raise  cocoa  farm  incomes  for  very  large  numbers  of 
cocoa  farmers,  especially  in  Sulawesi,  making  cocoa  farming  an  attractive  profession  once 
again  for  small  farmers  and  thereby  moving  the  cocoa  sector  to  a  more  competitive  and 
sustainable footing.  
102. 
In line with this, the overall objective of the sub-component is to substantially improve the cocoa 
support  service  markets  in  programme  district  so  that  cocoa  farmers  can  readily  access 
affordable good quality advice and inputs to upgrade their cocoa production without relying on 
government  handouts.  This  should  be  achieved  through  four  specific  complementary 
objectives: 
(i)  strengthening and expanding the coverage of embedded service delivered within the supply 
chains;  
(ii) developing high quality, affordable private service providers, including private nurseries; 
(iii) significantly expanding the cadre of private and public extension professionals who have 
advanced cocoa production and farm business knowledge and expertise so that this is far 
more widely available within cocoa communities; 
(iv) strengthening the role and capacity of District Estate Crops Dinas to backstop, mentor and 
nurture these private providers while not undermining them with free giveaways of inputs or 
advice which are unsustainable. 
Public services and support to cocoa farmers 
103.  An  important  context  to  the  service  and  input  market  for  cocoa  is  the  long  running  Cocoa 
National  Movement  Program  (Gernas)  of  the  Estate  Crops  Director  General  of  MoA. With  an 
annual  budget  of  Rp1  trillion  (USD76.9  million),  GERNAS  has  distributed  fertilizer  and 
seedlings  to  a  high  percentage  of  cocoa  farmers  in  Indonesia  aimed  at  boosting  productivity. 
Yet despite this, total cocoa production has continued to fall dramatically, having almost halved 
in  the  last  7  years  according  to  industry  estimates.  The  side  effect  of  GERNAS'  generous 
handouts  has  been  to  hold  back  the  development  of  more  sustainable  service  and  input 
markets  for  cocoa.  There  have  also  been  widely  acknowledged  technical  issues  with  some 
aspects  of  Gernas,  especially  relating  to  the  fertilizer  and  the  survival  rate/quality  of  the 
seedlings. 
104.  More  recently,  in  2016,  the  budget  for  GERNAS  was  dramatically  cut  by  >75%  to  only 
Rp235 billion  (USD18  million)  at  a  time  when  overall  MoA  budgets  are  increasing.  This 
potentially  implies  a  very  different  role  and  strategy  emerging  for  MOA  support  to  the  cocoa 
sector. READ SI will therefore be open to collaborating with DG Estate Crops in MoA and the 
Estate  Crop  teams  in  the  programme  districts  in  support  of  this  shift  in  direction,  especially 
where  it  concerns  development  of  more  sustainable  services  and  input  markets  for  cocoa 
farmers.   
Public private partnerships (PPP) in support of cocoa farmers 
105. 
In  support  of  the  sub-component  objectives,  READ  SI  will  expand  on  the  PPP  initiated  under 
READ.  Two  PPPs  for  READ  SI  are  currently  being  negotiated  with  two  of  the  three  leading 
chocolate  makers,  MARS  Cocoa  and  Mondelez,  who  are  at  the  top  of  the  supply  chain  in 
Indonesia.  READ  SI  will  be  open  to  exploring  a  third  PPP  with  the  other  leading  chocolate 
maker, Nestle, if  there  is  interest from both sides  and a suitable partnership can be designed 
that is consistent with a shared set of common objectives.  
19 
Republic of Indonesia 
Rural Empowerment and Agricultural Development Programme Scaling-up Initiative (READ SI) 
Final programme design report 
106.  Each  of  the  PPPs  will  be  individually  designed,  negotiated  and  managed  and  is  expected  to 
primarily focus in the Districts relevant to the partner firms supply chains. As such the activities 
and approach to cocoa service market development may be different from District to District.  
107.  The expected scope and status of the proposed PPPs with each of MARS cocoa and Mondelez 
are summarized in Appendix 4. Ongoing discussions  and  negotiations are happening  on  both 
PPPs  and  are  expected  to  be  concluded  soon  after  negotiation  of  the  financing  agreement 
between GoI and IFAD. 
(v)  Livestock production and health services and markets:  
108.  Livestock  will  be  a  flagship  product  in  NTT  given  its  importance  to  farmers  there.  A  vibrant 
livestock sub-sector in NTT demands, among other things, an effective and efficient system of 
animal  production  and  health  services.  Over  the  medium  term,  as  the  local  livestock  sector 
becomes  increasingly  market-oriented  with  more  intensive  smallholder  livestock  production, 
animal  production  and  health  services  will  need  to  be  delivered  primarily  by  private  providers 
operating  in  the  villages  in  order  to  meet  the  demand  for  services  from  an  expanding  sub-
sector. 
109. 
Initially, in NTT only, READ SI will fund the training and establishment costs of 6 animal health 
and  production  technicians  (AHPTs)  –  covering  3  districts  each. AHPTs  will  be  private  sector, 
part-time  farmers. Training  will  be:  (i)  delivered  at  the  Kupang Agriculture Training  Centre;  (ii) 
curriculum will be a tailor-made module approved/designed by READ; (iii) course duration will 
be 2 modules of 3 weeks each (i.e. basic plus refresher). This technical training at the ATC will 
be accompanied by a structured programme of on-the-job professional coaching and follow-up 
by professional livestock staff of the district DINAS which is conducted in the technicians own 
place  of  work.  Such  follow  up  should  be  a  minimum  of  one  visit  per  month  for  an  18  month 
period to ensure the technician develop the deep confidence and skills needed to be a trusted 
service  provider  in  their  community.  Technician  will  be  provided  with  a  starter  package  of 
equipment  and  medicine  and  vaccines  once  they  have  completed  their  ATC  training.  In 
addition, READ SI will fund an information, marketing and awareness campaign estimated with 
each. It is assumed that the AHPT clinic/office refurbishment will be funded by each AHPT.   
110.  Subject  to  satisfactory  progress  being  made  by  the  group  of  private  livestock  technicians, 
READ SI will then review experience from elsewhere in Indonesia and Asia on the development 
of  networks  and  associations  for  the  technicians  to  provide  mutual  professional  support  and 
backstopping and raise the sustainability of these services over the longer term. For example, 
in some other ASEAN countries district-level associations of private livestock technicians have 
been  operating  successfully  in  some  areas  for  more  than  20  years  with  minimal  external 
support. 
111.  At mid-term, READ SI will review the experience and lessons from the livestock production and 
service  market  development  in  NTT  and  assess  potential  and  appropriateness  for  this  to  be 
scaled-up into other READ SI districts outside of NTT. 
Component 3: Policy and strategy development support (IFAD grant financed, implemented by 
BAPPENAS) 
112. 
It is widely recognised that the agricultural sector policy environment in Indonesia has not kept 
pace  with  the  changing  requirements  of  the  sector,  and  that  the  substantial  policy  analysis 
conducted in the country  – much of it outside Government – has to date had limited influence 
on national policy. Today, the sector faces major challenges in its modernization, and to make 
use of the opportunities and meet the demand for both national food security and export, there 
is  an  urgent  need  to  develop  a  policy  and  institutional  framework  that  catalyses  increased 
investments from the private sector, including small farmers themselves, and more effective use 
of public resources. Policies and institutions to facilitate the scaling up of READSI represent an 
important dimension of this.  
20 
Republic of Indonesia 
Rural Empowerment and Agricultural Development Programme Scaling-up Initiative (READ SI) 
Final programme design report 
113. 
In the context of READ, IFAD provided limited support to enable the Ministry to conduct some 
basic policy analysis itself: this it did, and it strongly benefitted the scaling up process. Now, the 
Government  of  Indonesia  has  requested  IFAD  to  continue  this  policy  support  and  expand  it, 
particularly to inform and support two key policy documents, the Strategic Vision 2045 and the 
2020-2024  National  Medium-Term  Development  Plan,  including  support  on  the  planning, 
coordination  and  utilization  of  different  inputs.  Towards  this  end,  IFAD  has  allocated  a  USD1 
million  grant  to  support  policy  and  knowledge  management  activities,  and  the  associated 
capacity building work on which they depend. As a project design to test innovative approaches 
to rural development, READ SI is expected to generate a number of lessons learned relevant to 
national  policy  planning  and  development  and  the  grant-funding  will  support  a  pilot  to  extract 
lessons learned from rural development programmes for policy development. This will feed into 
the scaling-up agenda of READ SI. 
114.  The  grant  will  be  implemented  by  the  Directorate  for  Food  and Agriculture  within  Ministry  for 
National Development Planning, BAPPENAS, under overall guidance of the Deputy Minister for 
Maritime  and  Natural  Resources.  The  directorate  coordinates  inputs  on  agriculture  to  the 
planning  process,  particularly  focusing  on  food  security.  It  supports  the  creation  of  agriculture 
strategies for sustainable economic development. Agricultural targets and strategies link closely 
to  the  creation  of  strategies  on  marine  and  fishery  development. The  directorate  collaborates 
with the Ministry of Agriculture to ensure coherence between the medium-term strategy of the 
Ministry of Agriculture (Rencana Strategis Kementarian Pertanian –RENSTRA) and RPJMN.  
115.  A Policy Coordination Platform will be established under the Deputy Minister for Maritime and 
Natural  Resources,  supported  by  a  secretariat  that  will  manage  the  grant,  coordinate  with 
relevant stakeholders from government, development institutions, and civil society; and support 
dialogue  events  and  other  activities  agreed  in  the  annual  work  plan  of  the  READSI  policy 
component.  
116.  The specific objectives for the policy component of READSI are:  
(i) 
(ii) 
to support the development of the Strategic Vision 2045, the next national medium-
term development plan (RPJMN 2020-2024) and annual work plans (Rencana Kerja 
Pemerintah - RKP), including coordination of involved stakeholders;  
to strengthen the capacities of government agencies in effective use of evidence in 
the policy and planning processes, including improved coordination between 
stakeholders such as central and local governments, non-government organisations, 
and the general public;  
(iii) 
to facilitate donor coordination on agricultural policy support; and  
(iv) 
to strengthen the use of results, lessons learned and smart practices from past and 
ongoing development projects. The policy areas supported by the grant connect to 
the national food security agenda and promote inclusive rural growth. 
117.  The grant  will support a ‘demand-driven’ policy  process which allows for a series of activities, 
including (but not limited to):  
(i) 
(ii) 
identification of policy needs/gaps to support planning;  
support for dialogue events and activities promoting participation and coordination of 
stakeholders in the planning process at national and local government level;  
(iii) 
support for outreach/socialisation and refinement of plans;  
(iv) 
(v) 
identification of capacity needs, design and conduct of specific training sessions 
connected to objectives of the grant;  
support to knowledge management and dissemination of results and lessons learned 
from past and ongoing development projects, such as READ SI.

Rural Empowerment and Agricultural Development Programme Scaling-up Initiative (READ SI) 
Final programme design report 
D.  Lessons learned and adherence to IFAD policies 
118.  Lessons learned from READ. Key success factors, as identified by the implementing partners 
of READ, include:  
(i)  its relevant core approach of smallholder empowerment and service delivery for production 
increase;  
(ii) a simple design with a strong poverty alleviation focus;  
(iii) the generally strong and motivated management at national and district level; and  
(iv) the combination and integration of technical expertise from different service providers, 
including public extension agents, NGOs and private sector.  
119.  Additional lessons learned that are relevant for the forthcoming READ SI programme are: 
(i)  integrating empowerment with targeted technical support increases effectiveness;  
(ii) diversifying extension service improves the capacities available for rural communities;  
(iii) involving the private sector can strengthen service delivery, access to new technologies and 
access to markets;  
(iv) involving a neutral facilitator in negotiating a private public partnership can ensure mutual 
beneficial agreements;  
(v) involving village elders in decision making processes ensures greater participation and 
smoother implementation;  
(vi) the phasing of activities can help reduce the risk of elite capture if decisions concerning high 
value investments, such as infrastructure, are delayed until later in the programme to allow 
the social capital and confidence of poorer target groups to develop to ensure their voice is 
properly represented in these major decisions; 
(vii)  a decentralized management structure ensures flexible and targeted programme 
activities. 
120. 
In  terms  of  targeting,  lessons  to  be  drawn  from  READ,  as  well  as  the  IFAD  country  portfolio. 
IFAD-supported  projects  have  been  generally  effective  in  identifying  poor  households,  using 
government indicators and poor household lists combined with participatory selection of project 
beneficiaries. The fact that many IFAD-supported projects provide comparatively small financial 
support  packages  and  expect  considerable  active  participation  from  participants  in  return, 
supports the self-targeting nature of interventions. This broad approach will be replicated in the 
targeting strategy for READ SI as it was in READ. The expectation of consistent participation in 
group activities and the lengthy mobilisation process also appears to have been effective for the 
inclusion  of  indigenous  people.  However,  regarding  this  last  point,  more  consistent  M&E  is 
required  to  be  able  to  draw  conclusive  lessons  on  responses  to  the  needs  and  priorities  of 
indigenous people and indeed how these may differ from the wider community. 
121.  There are a number of areas in  which  targeting strategies have proven less effective and  the 
design for READ SI will learn from these; (i) social mobilisation, inclusion and capacity building 
must  be  successfully  completed  before  economic  activities  begin,  particularly  those  related  to 
infrastructure; (ii) economic and livelihoods analysis, both preparatory and participatory, should 
support the identification of economic opportunities types; (iii) capacity building should be linked 
to tangible programme opportunities, whether these are economic or social and finally (iv) M&E 
should  be  simple  and  support  the  generation  of  knowledge  on  key  development  challenges, 
such as those listed above.  
122. 
In terms of IFADs policies and strategies, READ SI is fully aligned with goals and objectives 
of  IFAD’s  2016-2025  Strategic  Framework,  the  Indonesia  2016-2019  COSOP  and  relevant 
policies  including  those  on  environment  and  natural  resource  management,  gender  equality 
and  women  empowerment  and  indigenous  people,  as  well  as  with  the  strategies  on  rural 
finance, private sector partnerships and climate change. In addition, READ SI will place focus 
on two areas of strategic importance to IFAD:  
(i)  Nutrition is now mainstreamed within READ SI and has additional activities compared 
to READ 
22 
Republic of Indonesia 
Rural Empowerment and Agricultural Development Programme Scaling-up Initiative (READ SI) 
Final programme design report 
(ii) Scaling-up is at the heart of READ SI, and includes dimensions of replication into new 
geographical locations, evolution and adaptation of field activities so they are suited to 
a wider range of contexts, and building a programmatic and management platform for 
even wider scaling up and mainstreaming of the READ approach. The pathway will be 
embedded within IFAD’s Operational Framework for Scaling up Results19. 
III. 
Implementation 
A.  Approach  
123.  READ SI remains a farmer-centred programme, enabled through the integrated approach at the 
village level anchored by the social mobilization processes. This core implementation approach 
is based on the successful approach developed by READ post-MTR.  
124.  The  villages,  and  especially  the  programme  mobilized  agricultural  and  livelihoods  groups  are 
therefore  at  the  heart  of  the  implementation  approach  with  services  and  support  organised 
around these groups. To ensure farmers remain at the heart of the programme, the joint teams 
of Village Facilitators and PPL are the most critical members of the overall implementation set-
up,  so  particular  attention  will  be  given  to  recruiting,  training,  coaching  and  monitoring  these 
teams so they can  perform to a consistently high standard as  demonstrated under READ.  As 
much as possible, the  programme will  aim to  involve high performing READ facilitators  in the 
old READ villages. As part of the farmer-centred approach the mix of key activities will respond 
to the demands of the READ SI households in each village, for example the specific crops and 
livelihoods to be supported, with households free to choose which groups to join. 
125.  READ SI will invest in improving the quality of PPL support to farmers by working with the ATCs 
in Makassar and Kupang to review their PPL training approaches. Important improvements will 
be training which is more responsive to farmer needs – including the needs of different farming 
systems in different locations as  well  as responding to the particular extension  needs for less 
educated farmers and women. 
126.  READ  SI  will  also  support  a  transitional  approach  to  more  genuine  empowerment  of  farmers, 
for  example  by  reducing  the  size  and  scope  of  subsidies  and  donations,  with  a  greater 
emphasis placed on supporting farmers to make their own choices on how resources should be 
invested to support them as well as increasingly contributing to those investments. This is seen 
in  the  increased  choice  for  farmers  on  the  agricultural  and  livelihood  activities  but  also  in  the 
approaches to be used to support investment in machinery and small infrastructure.  
127.  From a programme management perspective, the READ SI approach is based on: 
(i)  district-led  decentralized  implementation  for  the  core  READ  SI  activities,  especially 
Component 1; 
(ii) effective central level management, with a small high quality NPMO assisted by PPSUs; 
(iii) working  with  specialist  partners  and  service  providers  to  bring  additional  expertise  into 
programme implementation, including on: 
i. 
ii. 
iii. 
social mobilization (a specialist implementing partner, continued from READ)  
rural  finance  (a  new  specialist  implementing  partner  plus  new  partnerships  with 
banks, MFIs and OJK) 
cocoa  technical  expertise  (expanding  the  partnership  with  MARS  Cocoa  from 
READ  plus  establishing  new  partnerships  with  other  lead  cocoa  firms  such  as

(v) performance-based  management  and  resource  allocation,  enabled  through  rigorous  MIS 
tasks 
including  performance  benchmarking  and  other  key 
and  M&E 
framework, 
demonstrated in READ and CCDP. 
128.  READ SI will take full advantage of the experience of READ and the strongest managers and 
staff  from  the  original  READ  districts  will  be  used  as  key  resource  staff  in  READ  SI  to  coach 
and mentor others in READ SI and will also contribute to updating the new PIM for READ SI. 
129.  READ  SI  will  also  expand  elements  of  the  original  READ  approach,  especially  including 
deepening  and  increasing  the  number  of  PPPs  –  in  the  cocoa  sector  but  also  in  financial 
services.  It  will  also  see  an  evolving  role  for  the  NPMO,  as  it  transitions  its  systems  and 
practices  from  managing  a  project  to  a  programmatic  platform  able  to  operate  across  many 
more and varied districts. 
130.  Given the growing importance of village-led investment in Indonesia more generally, especially 
under  the  new  Village  Law,  READ  SI  will  coordinate  with  Ministry  of  Villages  and  other  key 
agencies  to  ensure  links  and  synergies  are  developed  between  READ  SI  and  these  other 
initiatives - both centrally and practically at village and district levels.   
131.  As  READ  SI  moves  towards  a  programmatic  approach,  the  framework  for  the  selection  of 
districts  into  the  programme  and  their  eventual  graduation  out  of  READ  will  evolve.  As  is 
already being seen in the original READ districts, the intensity and nature of supported needed 
from READ changes as the Districts make progress and deliver results. READ SI will therefore 
use a framework as illustrated in Figure 1 and described briefly below. 
READ SI District graduation approach 
(i)  Entry:  Districts  selected  on  a  semi-competitive  basis  according  to  the  criteria  outlined  in 
Chapter  A above. It is anticipated that there will be more districts wanting to join READ SI 
than available places in the programme, mostly due to funding limits for READ SI at present. 
Districts wanting to join but who were not selected will be placed  in a prioritized waiting list. 
As new places become available in the programme, either through additional funding or the 
removal of non-performing districts (see below), then districts at the top of the waiting list will 
be invited to join. 
(ii) Foundation Phase: Districts joining the READ programme for the first time will implement a 
Foundation phase, of activities and interventions typically over 5-6 years - as described for 
the  "new"  districts  in  this  design.  Their  performance  will  be  monitored  and  benchmarked 
against other districts and against the agreed expected milestones set for each district.  
i. 
ii. 
Districts performing well and meeting agreed milestones will be eligible to apply to 
continue  to  a  second  advanced  phase  of  READ  -  similar  to  that  proposed  under 
READ SI for the original READ districts.  
Districts  not  performing  well  against  the  agreed  milestones  at  any  time  will  be 
provided  with  one  year  of  intensive  management  support  coordinated  by  the 
NPMO  to  address  the  problems  and  get  the  performance  back  to  the  required 
level. If performance improves to the required level, the district can re-join the main 
programme. If the district’s implementation performance does not improve despite 
intensive support, the district may be removed from the programme and a  district 
from the waiting list invited to join. 
(iii) Advanced Phase: Well performing districts will be provided with a more focused, advanced 
set of activities and support over a 4-6 year period - both in the programme villages and in 
terms  of  the  district  systems,  management  and  services  -  in  order  establish  the  more 
advanced  and  mature  capabilities  in  inclusive  rural  development  such  that  they  can 
graduate from the READ programme. One of the knowledge and policy objectives for READ 
SI is to establish the lessons and experience on the key elements of this Advanced Phase 
24 
Republic of Indonesia 
Rural Empowerment and Agricultural Development Programme Scaling-up Initiative (READ SI) 
Final programme design report 
and  the  graduation  from  the  programme.  Districts  whose  performance  drops  during  the 
Advanced Phase may also be removed from the programme. 
Figure 1: READ District selection and graduation approach 
132.  The  nine  old  READ  districts  will  enter  READ  SI  at  the Advanced  Phase  with  clearly  defined 
performance milestones. Those districts that do not perform well in the first year of READ SI will 
be provided with one additional year of intensive management support to raise performance to 
the required level or be removed from the programme.  
133. 
Institutional capacity, especially  at  district  level.  A key  aspect of the  READ SI scaling process 
must  be  that  it  can  be  implemented  in  districts  with  different  starting  levels  of  institutional 
capacity  and  for  READ  SI  to  have  the  instruments  to  raise  capacity  to  a  consistently  higher 
standard.  
134.  An  institutional  analysis  of  each  new  READ  SI  district  should  therefore  be  an  important  early 
step  in  the  process  of  the  districts  joining  READ  SI.  This  should  then  inform  district-specific 
coaching  and  institutional  strengthening  plans  for  READ  SI  to  implement  co-ordinated  by 
NPMO and BAPPEDA from the district concerned. An indication of the likely level of capacity of 
the  district  teams  in  programme  management  will  be  if  the  district  has  implemented  a  major 
central government project in the last three years. For districts who have not, a programme of 
extended training and follow-up support on programme management will be provided over the 
first 2 years, with close follow-up support from the PPSU. 
B.  Organizational framework 
135.  READ  SI  will  follow  the  implementation  structure  of  READ  and  will  inherit  the  strong 
management  foundations  that  have  underpinned  READ's  success. As  READ  SI  is  explicitly  a 
scaling-up initiative or READ and a significant part the success of READ has been attributed to 
its management, it is vital that this management experience from READ also guides READ SI 
implementation. 
25 
Republic of Indonesia 
Rural Empowerment and Agricultural Development Programme Scaling-up Initiative (READ SI) 
Final programme design report 
136.  READ SI will be implemented at the same time as the large IPDMIP irrigated agriculture project 
with  AAEHRD  responsible  on  behalf  of  MoA  for  the  management  of  both  projects.  This  will 
create significant opportunities but also management pressure on AAEHRD. 
137.  To manage the risks to both projects, distinct responsibilities and teams for each of the major 
programmes  being  implemented  concurrently  (READ  SI  and  IPDMIP)  will  be  assigned  within 
AAEHRD  to  facilitate  proper  management  and  accountability  for  the  delivery  of  each 
programme.  
138.  Steering  Committee.  READ  SI  will  be  overseen  by  a  Steering  Committee  which  will  have 
powers to take key decisions on the overall direction of the programme. It is proposed that the 
Steering Committee is Chaired by a senior official of the Ministry of Agriculture and Co-chaired 
by BAPPENAS. 
139.  Members of the Steering Committee should include representatives of: 
(i)  Government - Central: Ministry of Villages, Ministry of Home Affairs 
(ii) Government - Sub-national: Representatives of READ SI Provinces and Districts  
(iii) PPP partners: from cocoa sector, banking sector and other related associations if needed  
(iv) Other key implementing partners and stakeholders, such as farmers’ organizations 
140.  For effective work and decision making, members will be appointed for not less than one year 
and total membership of the Steering Committee should not exceed 20 persons 
141.  Executing Agency for the loan financing will be the Ministry of Agriculture on behalf of GoI and 
the Agency  of Agricultural  Extension  and  Human  Resource  Development  will  be  assigned  as 
the National Programme Management Unit on behalf of MoA. 
142. 
Implementing Agency for the grant financed activities will be BAPPENAS. 
143.  Ministry of Finance will act as the official Representative of the  Government of Indonesia as 
the  Borrower/  Recipient.  In  this  role  MoF  will  be  responsible  for:  (i)  Fulfilling  the  government 
fiduciary  oversight  and  management  responsibilities;  and  (ii)  Providing  sufficient  counterpart 
contribution  in  a  timely  manner  to  finance  the  programme  activities,  including  payment  of 
government  staff  salaries;  (iii)  Timely  processing  WAs,  approval  of  procurement  actions  and 
other necessary documents according to the agreed operating procedures.  
144.  NPMO will be led by a  Programme Director supported by  three Deputy Programme Directors. 
The  role  of  two  of  the  Deputy  Programme  Directors  is  to  provide  overall  coordination  and 
oversight of all programme activities within a number of provinces and ensure adequate senior 
presence and support of the programme management out in the READ SI districts. In addition, 
the  third  Deputy  PD  will  oversee  financial  management,  procurement  and  programme 
administration issues, including planning, M&E and reporting. 
145.  While  the  NPMO  has  overall  responsibility  for  programme  delivery,  each  of  the  Components 
have specific implementation arrangements:  
(i)  Component 1: District Sekretariat Daerah  20 (SETDA) and their relevant technical agencies 
(especially  DINAS  Pertanian)  will  have  prime  responsibility  for  programme  delivery  within 
their  districts.  BAPPEDA  will  act  as  coordinator  during  planning  process  while  Dinas 
Pertanian will act as District Programme Management Office (DPMOs) and at the same time 
serves  the  Programme  Implementation  Units  (DPIUs)  along  with  other  relevant  technical 
agencies.  Staff  from  the  specialist  implementing  partners  on  social  mobilization  and  rural 
finance assigned to each district will work as an integrated part of the district implementation 
teams and be based in the relevant agency teams (similarly at sub-district level). The district 
teams will be provided  with technical backstopping and monitoring by  NPMO team as well 
as the corresponding provincial agencies, especially the provincial Dinas Pertanian who will 
20 SEKDA - Sekretaris Daerah -functioning as coordinator of all technical agencies at district level to support policy formation 
process especially those that support the Bupati's vision and to ensure its in line with decentralisation principles. 
26

Rural Empowerment and Agricultural Development Programme Scaling-up Initiative (READ SI) 
Final programme design report 
host  the  READ  SI  Provincial  Programme  Support  Unit  (PPSU).  There  will  be  a  more 
systematic  process  for  engagement  of  Sub-district  (Camat)  and  village  heads  (Kepala 
Desa). 
(ii) Component 2: The NPMO will have primary responsibility for delivery of activities under the 
four  sub-components.  In  the  case  of  cocoa  and  rural  finance,  PPP's  will  be  a  central 
mechanism.  Under  sub-component  2.1,  the  Directors  of  collaborating  ATCs  will  be 
accountable  to  the  NPMO  to  provide  more  relevant  in-service  training  to  agriculture 
extension staff. 
(iii) Component 3: Will be led and implemented by BAPPENAS. 
146.  Policy Secretariat will be established within the Directorate for Food and Agriculture to manage 
the policy activities under the grant. 
147.  Specialist implementing  partners for social mobilization and rural finance  will be contracted 
centrally by NPMO and operate as an integrated part of the implementation teams, hosted by 
the  relevant  units  at  national,  provincial,  district  and  sub-district  level.  For  this  purpose,  two 
specialist  service  providers  will  be  procured  as  institutional  service  contracts  by  the  NPMO 
rather than hiring individual consultants. This will be similar to the arrangements for the social 
mobilization TA adopted under READ. 
148.  Provincial  Programme  Support  Units  (PPSU)  will  be  set-up  in  each  Province.  PPSU  will 
primarily  focus  on  programme  administration  functions,  such  as  financial  reporting,  M&E  and 
planning.  They  are  considered  necessary  to  provide  closer  support  and  backstopping  to  the 
District PMOs given the increased geographical coverage of READ SI. The PPSU are a support 
unit and as such will not lead any activities nor direct activities in districts. PPSU are expected 
to  be  hosted  by  the  provincial  Dinas  Pertanian  and  will  also  host  the  provincial  staff  of  the 
contracted specialist implementing partners for Social Mobilization and Rural Finance. 
149.  District  Programme  Management  Office  (DPMO)  will  be  set  up  in  each  district  hosted  by 
Dinas Pertanian and will guide a District Programme Implementation Unit (DPIU) hosted by the 
relevant  technical  agencies  such  as  integrated  Dinas  of  Peternakan  (livestock),  Perkebunan  
(estate crops) and , .  
150.  Senior  Technical  Assistance  will  be  highly  focused.  There  will  be  a  small  amount  of  senior 
national  and  international  technical  assistance,  primarily  at  the  NPMO  level  and  weighted 
towards  the  start  of  the  programme  to  help  establish  the  new  programme  systems  and 
approaches.  This  senior  TA  will  explicitly  focus  on  advising  and  providing  senior  professional 
support  in  specific  areas  of  Programme  Management  to  the  NPMO  and  will  not  be  used  to 
substitute for capacity in the programme team.  
C.  Planning, M&E, learning and knowledge management 
Planning. 
151.  Planning  processes  and  schedules  within  READ  SI  will  be  harmonized  with  the  mainstream 
planning process of GoI, both centrally and at district level. 
152.  Annual  AWPB  Approval  Process:  At  4th  quarter  of  financial  year,  the  NPMO  required  to  l 
submit  the  national  AWPB  and  Procurement  Plan  for  the  following  year  to  have  the  No 
Objection Letter from IFAD. The AWPB will be prepared by consolidating (i) the plans from each 
district, primarily covering Component 1; (ii) plans associated with each of the sub-components 
under Component 2 (iii) plans for overall management of READ SI; (iv) for Component 3 which 
is  mainly  supported  by  IFAD  Grant,  the  AWPB  will  be  prepared  separately  by  the  relevant 
implementing unit at BAPPENAS. 
27 
Republic of Indonesia 
Rural Empowerment and Agricultural Development Programme Scaling-up Initiative (READ SI) 
Final programme design report 
153.  The AWPB prepared by the NPMO will cover the IFAD loan, The AWPB covering grant funded 
activities  will  be  prepared  separately  by  the  Policy  Secretariat  under  the  Directorate  of  Food 
and Agriculture, BAPPENAS.   
154.  Districts  are  the  primary  level  of  intervention  for  READ  SI  and  so  the  primary  intervention 
planning will be done at district level. This includes all activities under Component 1. Planning 
in the district will be led by BAPPEDA and harmonized with the local planning processes and 
will build on inputs and plans from each village and sub-district. 
D.  Monitoring and evaluation 
155.  The M&E and Knowledge Management framework of READ SI will draw on the experience of 
the  Coastal  Community  Development  Project  (CCDP)  to  monitor  and  gain  knowledge  about 
programme  poverty  reduction  and  livelihoods  impacts  and  how  these  can  be  scaled-up  and 
replicated  into  a  programmatic  approach.  The  M&E  of  READ  provided  few  insights  into  the 
dynamics of poverty reduction at the household level or the factors that explain the success of 
different activities. Instead, information is derived mainly from: (i) extrapolation from agricultural 
yields; (ii) extrapolation from an improvement in the incidence of poverty at the provincial level; 
and  (iii)  the  evident  support  for  READ,  both  within  the  government  and  amongst  the 
beneficiaries.  READ  SI  will  provide  an  improved  M&E  and  knowledge  management  design 
which, in as far as it relates to targeting, will include:  
 
A weekly/monthly dashboard that shows progress on key outputs and objectives, including 
gender; 
Sex-disaggregated database on all outcomes, outputs and indicators related to individuals 
or households; 
 
  Household level analysis of poverty impact that enable an understanding of how different 
interventions (rice, maize, cocoa, off-farm etc.) impact different poverty causes (land-poor, 
remoteness, infrastructure poor etc.);  
  Regular knowledge sharing and exchange meetings and workshops; and  
 
Social media to support knowledge management outcomes.  
156.  For  data  collection,  READ  SI  will  build  on  the  experience  in  the  wider  region  and  introduce 
tablet-based  electronic  data  collection  directly  into  a  centrally  maintained  MIS  system. This  is 
intended  to  reduce  the  time  burden  of  M&E  data  collection  and  also  improve  timeliness  and 
reliability of data in order to make the M&E system more robust and valuable as a management 
tool. 
157.  To support this move to e-M&E, all field staff will be provided with tablets and smartphones to 
facilitate this and efficient group based routine communication e.g. via WhatsApp. 
E.  Learning and knowledge management 
158.  READ SI is the first phase in the scaling-up of the core READ approach and also comes at a 
time  of  increased  investment  by  GoI  in  agriculture  creating  a  strong  demand  for  evidence-
based learning and policy development.  
159.  Given the strong reputation of READ, READ SI is therefore expected by MoA, BAPPENAS and 
others  to  generate  practical  knowledge  of  what  works  (and  what  doesn't  work)  and  how  to 
scale-up  investments  in  the  successful  approaches  on  a  more  programmatic  basis.  Effective 
and  efficient  learning,  knowledge  management  and  communication  are  therefore  central  to 
READ  SI  longer  term  objectives. Accordingly,  READ  SI  will  invest  in  good  quality,  evidence-
based knowledge management in order to contribute to policy development processes.  
160.  An IFAD grant of USD 1 million will support specific efforts on knowledge management within 
READ SI and also to contribute to broader policy and strategy processes between BAPPENAS 
and MoA and other government stakeholders at national, provincial and district level. The grant 
28 
Republic of Indonesia 
Rural Empowerment and Agricultural Development Programme Scaling-up Initiative (READ SI) 
Final programme design report 
will  also  be  available  to  support  policy  processes  in  other  aspects  of  agriculture  and  MoA 
beyond immediate relevance to READ SI. (See Component 3) 
161.  Within READ SI implementation itself, the benchmarking process outlined above will enable the 
programme  to  quickly  identify  examples  of  good  practice  in  different  aspects  of  the  READ 
approach.  These  examples  of  good  practice  can  then  be  quickly  documented  and  rolled-out 
within  the  rest  of  the  programme.  READ  SI  is  therefore  expected  to  be  able  to  implement  a 
system of continuous improvement. The process of identifying and documenting best practice 
will also be a useful source of field evidence to feed into the wider policy processes in MoA. 
F.  Financial management, procurement and governance   
162.  For activities implemented in provinces and districts, READ SI will apply standard government 
procedure for OGA financed programmes  
163.  FM and Fund flow will use on-granting to District and Provinces for cost activities under their 
respective  authority.  For  districts,  this  will  primarily  be  activities  assigned  to  district  authority 
under  Component  1.  Individual  budgets  will  be  prepared  for  each  district  and  province  as  the 
basis for the on-granting agreements. 
164. 
It is noted that AAEHRD will also managed IPDMIP which will use on-granting mechanism. For 
simpler  management  systems  in AAEHRD,  there  are  benefits  to  both  programmes  using  the 
same  mechanism  and  on-granting  is  believed  to  be  better  suited  to  larger  decentralized 
investment  delivery  and  district-level  ownership,  but  this  is  untested  by  AAEHRD.  It  is  also 
noted that many of the programme districts were also covered under the WISMP-2 programme 
which  used  on-granting  mechanism  and  so,  the  DINAS  will  already  have  some  level  of 
experience with this mechanism. 
165.  Grant funding will be independently managed by BAPPENAS as direct grant (Hibah Langsung) 
and use the on-budget, off treasury mechanism, similar to the SEDSSTC grant arrangement. 
166.  Procurement  of  goods,  works  and  services  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  National 
Procurement  Rules  and  Regulations  (Peraturan  President  Republic  Indonesia  Tentang 
Pengadaan Barang/Jasa, Pemerintah) and its operational instruction as amended from time to 
time, as long as it is consistent with the IFAD Project Procurement Guidelines. The use of the   
E-Procurement system (which includes the E-Catalogue and  E-Shopping Systems) is allowed 
for  all  NCB,  Shopping  and  Online-shopping  packages  for  goods;  civil  works  and  consultancy 
services. The executing and implementing agencies shall ensure procurement of goods, works 
and  consultancy  services  shall  be  subject  to  IFAD  prior  review  in  accordance  with  the 
prescribed  level  of  risk  as  assessed  by  IFAD,  regardless  of  the  automated  processes  of  the     
E-procurement  system,  in  which  the  prior  review  thresholds  will  be  described  in  the  Letter  to 
Borrower.  
G.  Supervision 
167.  READ SI will be jointly supervised by GoI and IFAD. Formal joint supervision missions will be 
conducted  at  least  once  per  financial  year  with  additional  implementation  support  missions 
mobilized  as  necessary.  At  least  one  additional  implementation  support  mission  will  be 
mobilized  within  the  first  6  months  of  programme  implementation  and  at  least  one  additional 
implementation  support  mission  during  the  second  year.  The  newly  established  IFAD  country 
office will provide continuous supervision and implementation support beyond the missions. 
168.  A Mid-Term Review will be jointly conducted by GoI and IFAD around the end of Year 3 of the 
programme, or earlier if required.  
169. 
IFAD's participation in the joint supervision of AIMS will be under its policy of direct supervision, 
in line with the IFAD Supervision and Implementation Support Policy.

H.  Risk identification and mitigation 
170.  The  main  risks  of  the  programme  relate  to  the  selection  of  priority  crops,  partnerships,  elite 
capture  and  programme  management  capacity  and  continuity  between  READ  and  READ  SI. 
Key risks are summarized  in the table below and a more detailed draft risk log is included as 
Annex 1. 
Table 1: Key Programme Risks 
Risk 
Mitigation  
Priority crops do not sufficiently offer 
market opportunities for smallholders. 
Partnerships with private sector 
(cacao PPPs and FSP) not beneficial 
for smallholder farmers. 
Elite capture of programme benefits. 
Limited implementation capacity 
Extension staff lack capacity to 
respond to farmer needs and deliver 
relevant support 
the  designated 
leaders  and  possible 
Priority  crops  to  be  supported  in  addition  to  rice,  cacao  and  vegetables  will 
be selected in close consultation with all relevant stakeholders and based on 
participatory  market  assessment.  Rice  and  cacao  were  demonstrated  to  be 
the main driver of increment financial impacts for households under READ. In 
more  remote  locations,  such as  the border districts  in  west  Kalimantan  and 
NTT,  READ  SI  will  be  flexible  to  accommodate  farming  systems  with  less 
market and more subsistence focus. 
Based on IFAD’s experience in Indonesia and other countries,  PPPs will be 
facilitated following careful due diligence to ensure they deliver clear benefits 
to READ SI supported communities. For example: 
The  partnership  with  MARS  builds  on  the  PPP  under  READ  which 
demonstrated positive benefits to smallholders. 
With  Mondelez,  their  Cocoa  Life  initiative  is  built  around  a  well  defined  
integrated  sustainable  community  development  model  for  cocoa  producing 
communities  and  has  benefited  from  >10  years  of  field  implementation 
globally and +3yrs development in Indonesia. 
This will be addressed by (i) providing adequate training on good leadership 
to 
installation  of  a  complaint 
mechanisms;  (ii)  sensitizing  implementing  agencies  and  partners;  (iii) 
selection of crops/activities targeted at women and small farmers; (iv) making 
information  on  sub-project  selection  and  financing  widely  available;  (v) 
requesting MOA to provide an anti-corruption plan for the  programme to be 
approved by the anti-corruption agency; and (vi) creation of a mechanism for 
resolution of grievances at the community level.  
"Big  ticket"  programme  investments  in  villages,  such  as  infrastructure  and 
machinery, will be delayed to the third year of village interventions and only 
eligible to group’s members who would have had to complete all programme 
activities for the previous two years.  This is intended to dramatically reduce 
the risk of elite capture for these higher risk investments 
AAEHRD has an excellent but small team that was the core of the success of 
READ.  The  READ  SI  programme  and  IPDMIP  represent  a  dramatic 
expansion of the work load of this team and represents a major potential risk 
to both new projects. 
Significant  additional  support  will  need  to  be  planned  for  AAEHRD  to  cope 
with this workload. There must also be regular and close monitoring over the 
first 2 years of implementation to identify emerging problems early and put in 
place corrective measures. 
District capacity is variable. READ SI will implement an institutional capacity 
assessment  with  all  new  districts  and  implement  a  targeted  strengthening 
plan  with  clear  milestones.  Institutional  incentives  have  been  built  in  to  the 
programme  design  through  the  use  of  district  and  provincial  benchmarking 
coupled  with  the  District  graduation  process,  both  of  which  are  intended  to 
drive self-improvement. 
Work with ATCs in Makassar and Kupang to review their training approaches 
from  the  current  "one  size  fits  all"  mentality  to  better  reflect  the  skill  sets 
required  by  PPLs  in  the  field.  Changes  are  likely  to  include  more  practical 
and less classroom training, functional processes to ensure ATC staff receive 
30 
Republic of Indonesia 
Rural Empowerment and Agricultural Development Programme Scaling-up Initiative (READ SI) 
Final programme design report 
timely  feedback  on  training  needs  and  quality,  and  tailor-made  training  for 
different farming systems, literacy levels as well as gender specific.  
Agreed  process  for  continuity  with  READ  partner  NGO  to  be  approved  by 
IFAD and GOI prior to effectiveness. This may be considered to be set as a 
pre-condition for Programme Effectiveness. 
Delayed contracting of specialist 
service providers for social 
mobilization (and rural finance to a 
lesser extent) substantially delays 
programme start up or undermines 
SMs central role in village process 
IV.  Costs, financing, benefits and sustainability 
A.  Costs 
171.  The  total  programme  costs,  including  physical  and  price  contingencies,  duties  and  taxes  are 
estimated at USD 56.9 million over a five-year implementation period. Programme investments 
are organized into three major components: (i) Village agriculture and livelihoods development 
(57.8%  of  the  costs);  (ii) Services  inputs  and  market  linkages  (15.8%  of  the  costs);  and  (iii) 
Policy Support (1.9% of the costs). Project Management at national, provincial and district level 
amounts to 24.4% of the total project cost. A summary breakdown of the programme costs by 
components is shown in Table 2 below.   
B.  Financing 
172.  An  IFAD  loan  will  cover  USD  39.9  million,  or  70.1%,  of  the  total  programme  cost, 
complemented by a grant of USD 1 million (1.8% of total programme cost). The Government of 
Indonesia will contribute USD 11.2 million (19.7%) by financing salaries of all NPMO, provinces, 
districts and sub-districts staff and by  waiving taxes  and  duties. The programme beneficiaries 
are expected to contribute USD 2.6 million (4.6% of the programme cost) - mostly to co-finance 
the purchase of basic and advanced agriculture mechanization under sub-component 1.2 - and 
“private  sector  partners”  –  which  are  companies  investing  on  cocoa-related  activities  -  will 
finance USD 2.2 million, or 3.9%, of the total programme cost.

C.  Summary benefits and economic analysis 
174.  READ SI programme objective is to individually and collectively empower rural households with 
the  skills,  confidence  and  resources  to  sustainably  improve  their  farm  and  non-farm  incomes 
and livelihoods. Benefits will derive from (i) community mobilization, (ii) village agriculture and 
livelihoods  development,  (iii)  improved  services,  inputs  and  market  linkages,  including 
enhanced financial services, and (iv) improved nutrition.  
175.  Number  of  beneficiaries.  The  programme  target  groups  are  farmers  including:  (i)  the  poor 
and  near  poor  who  have  the  potential  to  generate  economic  returns  from  agriculture  with 
programme support, (ii) active /demonstrating  farmer that  will act as “agents of change” who 
have  the  potential  to  demonstrate  and  motivate  the  poor  and  near  poor  in  their  area  to 
including  women-headed 
landless  and 
improve 
households,  who  will  be  included  in  activities  directed  at  homestead  gardening,  improved 
nutrition  and  financial  literacy.  The  programme  is  expected  to  benefit  about  342,000  direct 
beneficiaries  or  68,400  households,  assuming  an  average  household  size  of  five  members.  
About 50% of the total programme beneficiaries are expected to be women.

176.  Summary of financial models’ results. Five illustrative crop models and one livestock model 
were prepared to demonstrate the financial viability of the investments: (i) cocoa crop model, 
(ii)  cocoa  partly  rehabilitated  crop  model,  (iii)  paddy  crop  model,  (iv)  chilli  crop  model,  (v) 
copra crop model, (vi) goats livestock model. The table below summarizes the main results of 
the  crop  and  livestock  models,  which  have  been  used  as  building  blocks  for  the  economic 
analysis. All models  generate  attractive results in terms of NPV, IRR, return to  family  labour 
and B/C ratio.  
Table 3: Financial models summary 
177.  Economic  Rate  of  Return.  The  overall  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  of  the 
programme  is  estimated  at  19%  for  the  base  case.  The  net  present  value  (NPV)  of  the  net 
benefit stream, discounted at 10%, is USD 50.7 million. The economic analysis is more detailed 
presented in Appendix 10. 
178.  Sensitivity  Analysis.  In  order  to  test  the  robustness  of  the  economic  analyses  results,  a 
sensitivity analysis has been carried out. The sensitivity analysis shows the economic impacts 
that  a  decrease  in  programme  benefits  –  up  to  -50%  –  will  have  on  the  programme  viability. 
Similarly, it shows how the economic viability of the programme will be affected by an increase 
of  up  to  40%  in  programme  costs;  and  by  a  one  to  three-year  delay  in  programme 
implementation.  The  analysis  confirms  that  the  economic  viability  of  the  programme  remains 
attractive as a positive NPV and ERR above 10% are preserved in each case analysed.

D.  Sustainability 
179.  The sustainability of the economic benefits to READ households was already considered to be 
high under  READ,  as these  were primarily  achieved  through adoption of improved production 
practices  on  farms  based  on  knowledge  and  skills  gained  from  the  project  -  and  knowledge 
once learned is not easily forgotten. 
180.  READ SI hopes to go  even further in terms of sustainability  of impacts. The design maintains 
the core READ approach and then has additional elements intended to raise sustainability even 
further. 
181.  Component 1 includes additional feature such as: 
(i) 
(ii) 
The focus on financial literacy and savings will increase households capacity to cope 
with shock and recover afterwards, making previous gains more sustainable; 
Further  developing  the  READ  initiative  of  linking  savings  and  loan  groups  to  banks, 
will increase the sustainability of the groups as they will be both more valued by their 
members and also subject to greater management discipline and transparency; and 
(iii)  Providing  support  for  machinery  investment  to  micro-service  enterprises  owned  by 
farmers/farmers  groups  rather  than  giving  machinery  for  free,  is  likely  to  increase 
ownership  and  hence  proper  operation,  maintenance  and  cost  recovery  resulting  in 
greater sustainability of the machinery investments.     
182.  Component 2 is almost entirely geared towards building more sustainable support services and 
markets  for  critical  services  and  inputs  to  serve  farmers  demands.  These  include:  more 
sustainable,  market-based  local  supply  of  quality  rice  seed;  livestock  production  and  health

services and inputs (vaccines and anthelmintic); stronger links between farmers and banks as 
well  as  better  supervision  of  MFIs,  and;  improved  cacao  support  services  based  on  private 
provision of advice and inputs. 
183.  Under Component 2, agricultural extension service will also be strengthened at an institutional 
level from the sub-district up to the ATC. However, the sustainability of these investments in the 
public extension systems rely on continued commitment of funding from the government unless 
elements  of  "user  pays"  services  are  adopted.  An  important  contribution  of  READ  SI  to  the 
sustainability of public extension services is to provide robust evidence of the economic value 
and  high  rates  of  return  from  investing  in  good  quality,  efficient  public  sector  agricultural 
extension, especially in comparison to input and infrastructure lead investments (e.g. UPSUS), 
in order that extension can gain an increasing share of scarce public resources. 
184.  From an environmental perspective, READ and READ SI both have the opportunity to improve 
the  profitability  of  cacao  to  a  level  where  it  is  an  attractive  choice  for  more  farmers  and  so 
current upland land used for maize and other secondary crops is likely to be diverted to cacao 
(and existing cacao plantings sustained)  which is less vulnerable to unpredictable rain-fall and 
also helps preserve soil fertility and reduce erosion, especially on sloping land.

Appendix 1:  Country and rural context background 
{Extract from recent draft COSOP Report] 
186.  A  fast  growing  country.  A  member  of  the  G-20,  Indonesia  is  a  fast  growing  middle-income 
country (MIC) with the fourth largest population in the world. The archipelago consists of more 
than 17,000 islands, hosting a population of about 253 million and close to 300 ethnic groups 
speaking around 250 languages. Indonesia’s population is largely concentrated on the western 
part of the country (around 80% of the population lives on the islands of Java and Sumatra) and 
is increasingly urbanised. With a 3% annual urban growth, over 50% of Indonesians now live in 
urban  centers,  generating  a  soaring  demand  for  consumption  goods  and  in  particular  food 
products. Young people constitute around one third of the population but more than half of the 
under 30 live in urban areas as a result of strong youth internal migration.  
187.  Over the past decade Indonesia has progressed into a dynamic electoral democracy, achieving 
democratic transition as well as a remarkable economic performance. Between 2002 and 2012, 
the economy annually grew at an average rate of 5.5%, boosted by domestic consumption and 
a  growing  middle  class,  strong  investment  flows  and  a  boom  in  commodity  exports.  Revenue 
growth  was  further  sustained  by  macro-economic  stability  brought  by  a  prudent  macro-
economic management, with healthy public finances and low budget deficits, debt-to-GDP ratio 
and inflation. While around 25% of the GDP is produced by Jakarta, the revenue generated by 
small  and  middle  size  cities  is  rapidly  growing  under  the  combined  effect  of  increased 
population and productivity, and the majority of the fastest growing cities are out of Java. 
188.  Uneven  distribution  of  benefits.  Steady  economic  growth  has  led  to  gradual  poverty 
reduction. The number of people living below the poverty line of IDR 312,328/month (USD 21.7) 
has dropped from 24% in 1999 to 11%, or 27.73 million people, in 2014. The pace of poverty 
reduction  has  however  been  slowing  down  over  the  last  years  and  the  2010-2014  national 
development plan target to reduce poverty to 8-10%  could  not be achieved. Besides, another 
27% of the population or 68 million are near poor who live with less than UDS 2 a day or just 
above the poverty line. They are highly vulnerable to shocks such as illness, extreme weather 
or price  volatility,  which can easily  push them back into  official poverty. In fact, it is estimated 
that about 25% of Indonesians have fallen under the poverty line at least once in a three year 
period.  Despite  progress  in  health  and  education,  Indonesia’s  Human  Development  Index  of 
0.684 remains below the  average of 0.703 for East Asia and the Pacific. Malnutrition remains 
significant: the prevalence of stunting among children under five years of age rose from 36.8% 
in 2007 to 37.2% in 2013. 
189.  Furthermore, the benefits of economic growth have been unevenly distributed. As poverty was 
decreasing,  the  Gini  coefficient  has  raised  from  0.32  in  1999  to  0.41  in  2012,  showing  that 
income  distribution  has  become  increasingly  unequal.  Poverty  is  lower  in  the  cities  (8%)  and 
higher in the rural areas (14%), where a majority of smallholders lacking access to services and 
markets  are  unable  to  tap  the  potential  offered  by  economic  growth.  The  deterioration  of  the 
nutritional  status  is  more  severe  in  the  rural  areas,  where  access  to  social  and  economic 
infrastructure  is  lower.  Pronounced  regional  disparities  exist,  with  the  highest  poverty  rates 
affecting  Eastern  Indonesia.  However  densely  populated  Java  hosts  the  largest  numbers  of 
poor. 
190.  Agriculture. While  the  GDP  share  of  agriculture  has  come  down  to  12%  (2014),  it  is  still  the 
main  source  of  income  for  one  third  of  the  population  and  for  64%  of  the  poor.  With  rich 
volcanic soils and a tropical climate suitable for growing a variety of crops, Indonesia is a major 
global  producer  of  tropical  products  such  as  palm  oil,  rubber  and,  to  a  lesser  extent,  copra, 
cocoa, coffee and spices. The sector has been growing by an average 4.6% over 2004-2009, 
but this has been attributed mostly to a shift from food staples to high value crops as well as an 
35 
Republic of Indonesia 
Rural Empowerment and Agricultural Development Programme Scaling-up Initiative (READ SI) 
Final programme design report 
Appendix 1:  Country and rural context background 
expansion of cultivated areas. There is enormous potential for increasing crop productivity as a 
majority  of  smallholders  still  operate  close  to  subsistence  level.  Low  availability  of  modern 
inputs,  lack  of  appropriate  technologies,  low  access  to  irrigation  (less  than  50%  of  the  7.2 
million irrigated hectares are fit for use), high post-harvest losses and limited access to finance, 
extension and other support services contribute to low yields and low returns. Difficult access to 
markets due to limited connectivity in remote areas, high transaction costs, the lack of storage 
and  cold  chain  infrastructure  and  farmers’  lack  of  market  information  and  marketing  skills 
further  affect  productivity  and  earnings.  The  share  of  the  national  budget  accruing  to  the 
agriculture sector doubled from 2.7% in 2001 to 5.6% in 2009. However heavy central spending 
on subsidies (inputs and credit) made available to the vast majority of farmers has constrained 
resource allocation  to the  provision of public goods and services such as research, extension 
and infrastructure. The lack of an enabling environment as well as increased land fragmentation 
in  the  more  densely  populated  areas  contribute  to  the  number  of  farmer  households  (26.2 
million in 2013) decreasing by an average of 500,000 every year, mostly affecting families with 
less than one hectare of land. 
191.  Fishing and aquaculture. Around 6.4 million people are engaged in inland and marine fishing 
and aquaculture. Artisanal producers using traditional means account for 95% of the production 
of 15.26 million tons (2012), of which aquaculture accounts for 62%and has an average annual 
growth rate of 34%. Aside from constituting an important source of proteins that the government 
is promoting to improve food security, marine products have considerable potential for exports, 
which have been steadily  growing over the last  years, reaching  USD  3.9 billion USD in 2012. 
Limited access to boats and fishing gear, practices of destructive and illegal fishing,  and poor 
management  by  aquaculture  operators  leave  considerable  scope  for  modernising  and 
improving production. The Eastern part of the country also suffers from a lack of infrastructure 
such as port facilities, electricity, transport facilities and fuel supply for vessels. 
192.  Rural women. Most of rural women work as home-based workers, plantation workers or on the 
family’s  farm. Whether  employed  in  the  formal  or  informal  sector,  they  earn  on  average  17% 
less than men. Poor women are often physically overworked, increasingly taking over primary 
production  as  men  migrate.  The  lack  of  basic  social  infrastructure,  including  access  to  water, 
sanitation  and  energy,  and  traditional  social  roles  contribute  to  increasing  their  burden. 
Indonesia’s  Civil  Code  stipulates  that  men  and  women  have  equal  ownership  rights  and  the 
1974 Marriage Law formally adopts the concept of joint ownership of property purchased during 
marriage.  However  only  few  parcels  of  land  are  registered  in  the  joint  name  of  husband  and 
wife, because of a lack of awareness and of traditional norms. By law, women also have equal 
access to financial services, and have the right to independently conclude contracts. However, 
law provisions lack proper enforcement and married women find it difficult to engage in formal 
financial  activities  such  as  opening  a  bank  account.  Women  have  significant  decision-making 
powers within the household but have limited access to information and formal decision-making 
structures. They are poorly represented in farmers’ groups, whose members are chiefly (male) 
heads  of  households,  so  that  extension  activities  seldom  include  women,  except  for  nutrition 
and family planning. Poor women-headed households (3 million in the poorest three deciles or 
around 12 million people) stand higher risks of being affected by shocks.  
193.  Rural producers’ organisations.  There is  a  large  number of informal farmers’ groups based 
on traditional solidarity and self-help systems across the country, which offer good opportunities 
for  developing  membership-based  organisations  extending  services  to  members.  Structured 
farmers’  groups  are  not  frequent  but  they  exist  across  value  chains,  usually  as  the  result  of 
external  assistance.  Main  services  provided  include  input  supply,  collective  marketing, 
certification (in particular in the cocoa sector), water management (water users’ associations), 
and  advocacy  and  land  tenure.  The  widespread  lack  of  legal  recognition  of  producers’ 
organisations is motivated by past negative experience with state-controlled cooperatives, but it 
prevents  organisations  from  becoming  trusted  partners  and  accessing  credit  from  financial 
institutions.  Other  obstacles  include  the  lack  of  recognition  by  local  authorities,  limited 
36 
Republic of Indonesia 
Rural Empowerment and Agricultural Development Programme Scaling-up Initiative (READ SI) 
Final programme design report 
Appendix 1:  Country and rural context background 
structuring beyond the grassroots level and weak technical and management capacities. There 
are  however  successful  examples  demonstrating  that,  with  appropriate  support,  empowered 
producers’  organisations  can  play  a  key  role  in  supplying  small-scale  producers  with  services 
enabling  them  to  raise  productivity,  match  market  requirements  and  earn  premium  prices. 
Producers’ organisations also have a key role to play in voicing their members’ concerns and in 
defending their interests in policy making processes up to the national level.  
194.  Migration.  First  spurred  by  the  authorities  under  the  transmigration  programme,  internal  and, 
increasingly, international migration is a common response to poverty and the lack of economic 
opportunities.  It  is  estimated  that  almost  one  in  two  people  migrated  at  least  once  across  the 
archipelago,  attracted  by  urban  informal  labour  markets  or  by  international  migration  and  that 
around 500,000 Indonesians are driven into international migration every year. About 6.5 million 
are currently officially working abroad and another 2 to 5 million are believed to be abroad as 
undocumented migrant workers. In 2012, net remittances to Indonesia (excluding internal flows) 
reached an estimated USD 7.2 billion, which would benefit a population of between 38 and 57 
million  people  at  home.  The  majority  of  international  migrants  (68%)  are  low-skilled  women 
coming  from  poor  rural  areas,  who  work  as  domestic  workers  in  other Asian  or  in  Middle  Est 
countries and who are vulnerable to exploitation. While Indonesia has managed to substantially 
reduce  the  cost  of  remitting  (6.6%),  migrants  still  have  limited  access  to  formal  financial 
channels because of remoteness and financial illiteracy. Because of a lack of information, BDS 
and  financial  services,  few  migrants  manage  to  set  up  profitable  and  sustainable  businesses 
upon their return and are forced to migrate again once their savings have run out.  
195.  Agri-business.  There  is  a  growing  interest  of  domestic  and  global  agribusiness  in  sourcing 
from  small-scale  producers,  which  opens  up  new  avenues  for  supplying  smallholders  with 
services, new technologies and possibly also access to finance, with scale. The oil palm sector 
pioneered  a  successful  hub  and  spoke  model  with  state-owned  enterprises,  which  has  later 
been successfully expanded by the private sector. Leading global and local agribusiness have 
created  the  Partnership  for  Indonesia’s  Sustainable  Agriculture  (PISAgro),  which  aims  at 
developing  public  and  private  partnerships  around  ten  commodities  (of  which  six  for  the 
domestic  market)  to  improve  sustainable  production,  farmers’  livelihoods  and  food  security. 
There is much potential to develop the processing and conditioning of agriculture and marine-
based  food  products  to  supply  urban  markets.  Substantial  development  of  the  domestic 
agribusiness  sector  will  however  hinge  on  improving  the  business  environment  –  Indonesia 
currently  ranks  114  over  189  against  the  Ease  of  Doing  Business  Index,  far  behind  Malaysia 
(18), Thailand (26) or Vietnam (78). Key factors restraining investment in agribusiness include: 
the prevalence of state companies in the production and distribution of input supplies;  multiple 
layers  of  regulation  and  taxes,  also  resulting  from  decentralisation;  poor  access  to  capital; 
insufficient  road  infrastructure,  especially  to  remote  areas;  unreliable  energy  supply;  and 
corruption. 
196.  Financial inclusion. Despite rapid development of Indonesia’s financial sector in recent years, 
it  is  estimated  that  less  than  half  of  the  rural  population  use  banking  services.  By  December 
2015,  about  Rp  255  trillion  or  9.1%of  the  total  commercial  bank  business  lending  benefitted 
agriculture  (including  forestry)  and  most  of  it  went  to  larger,  commercial  plantations.  BPRs 
extended to this sector Rp 4.6 trillion or 11.9% of their loans to businesses. Indonesia has also 
experienced fast growth of the microfinance sector, pushed by the GoIs’ KUR program and the 
banks’ compulsory 20%  lending target to MSMEs. Micro enterprises and farmers are reached 
by  a  vast  array  of  NGOs  active  in  promoting  micro  finance  activities,  a  growing  number  of 
cooperatives  and  a  variety  of  public  district  or  village-based  institutions  and  revolving  funds. 
Nonetheless,  the  majority  of  smallholders  cannot  or  do  not  make  use  of  formal  finance, 
because of low financial literacy, lack of collaterals, or being afraid of the consequences of not 
being  able  to  repay  the  loan  according  to  schedule.  Furthermore,  there  is  a  lack  of  risk 
management mechanisms to offset risks attached to agriculture production and price volatility. 
Although  many  people  do  not  trust  in  insurance,  it  is  common  that  banks  ask  borrowers  to 
37 
Republic of Indonesia 
Rural Empowerment and Agricultural Development Programme Scaling-up Initiative (READ SI) 
Final programme design report 
Appendix 1:  Country and rural context background 
insure  their  vehicles,  their  businesses  (fire),  and  their  life  (as  collateral  substitute).  The  GoI 
started in 2015 with agriculture insurance (rice) and extended it to cattle in 2016. Established in 
2011,  Otoritas  Jasa  Keuangan  (OJK),  or  the  Indonesia  Financial  Services  Authority,  is 
responsible for the regulation and supervision of banks and non-bank financial  institutions, as 
well as financial education and services as well as consumer protection. To raise capacities in 
the sector, OJK is planning to create a Knowledge Centre that would provide learning resources 
to stakeholders in the financial sector from Indonesia and other countries. 
197.  Key  challenges.  Despite  regular  increase  in  the  production  of  cereals  and  tubers,  Indonesia 
continues  to  suffer  from  food  deficits. A  population  expected  to  reach  300  million  by  2035,  of 
which more than 75% in the cities, will generate expanding pressure on agriculture and marine 
production. Meeting the growing domestic demand for food products and reducing the country’s 
dependence  on  imports  will  not  only  require  an  increase  in  agricultural  productivity  but  also 
developing  the  competitiveness  of  domestic  productions.  The  implementation  of  the  ASEAN 
Economic Community will open new commercial opportunities but will also toughen competition 
with  neighbouring  countries.  Substantial  increases  in  productivity  and  competitiveness  will 
hinge  on  the  modernisation  of  the  agriculture  sector  and  on  attractiveness  to  young  men  and 
women.  Most  of  the  reduction  in  the  farmers’  population  has  hit  the  15-24  age  group,  which 
decreased by 1.21million between 2009 and 2013.  
198.  Climate  change  constitutes  another  important  challenge.  Climatic  risks  are  expected  to 
increase  significantly,  with  increasingly  erratic  weather  patterns,  extreme  weather  events, 
coastal erosion, and the progressive loss of coral reefs from ocean acidification. Deforestation 
and peat land degradation further contribute to an estimated 75% of the country’s greenhouse 
gas emissions. Adaptation measures are needed in both the agriculture and fisheries sector to 
develop climate adaptation and offset elevated risks of crop failure, marine resource losses and 
food insecurity.  
199.  Competition  for  land  is  increasing  in  some  areas  as  residential  and  industrial  areas  expand, 
along with plantations: it is estimated that land conversion from food crops to other functions is 
10's of thousands pf hectares per year. Insufficient and conflicting spatial planning with limited 
participatory  processes,  costly  and  slow  titling  procedures  do  not  offer  adequate  protection 
against the conversion of farming land, which is further facilitated by farmers’ limited awareness 
of the legal framework or of the value of land and by the lack of recognition of customary land 
rights.  
200.  Sustainable fisheries management is becoming a matter of concern as catch levels have been 
declining in some areas, because of overexploitation and lack of community involvement in the 
management of coastal areas and marine resources.

A.  Poverty and Target Groups 
201.  Steady  economic  growth  has  contributed  to  gradual  poverty  reduction  with  a  fall  in  the  total 
number of people living below the poverty line from 24% in 1999 to 11% in 2015. However, the 
incidence of rural poverty remains high at 14.7% with significant numbers, 27.73 million, living 
below the poverty line of IDR 333034 in 2015. Another 27% of the population or 68 million are 
near poor who live with less than USD 2 a day or just above the poverty line. Indonesia’s HDI of 
0.684 remains below the average for the East Asia and Pacific regions and malnutrition remains 
significant: the prevalence of stunting among children under five years of age rose from 36.8% 
in 2007 to 37.2% in 2013. Rising inequalities, with an increase in the Gini Coefficient from 0.36 
in  2005  to  0.41  in  2014,  are  threatening  to  roll  back  progress  made  in  poverty  reduction  and 
further entrench poverty.  
202.  Rural  poverty  remains  greater  than  urban  poverty,  both  in  absolute  and  relative  terms.  While 
the GDP share of agriculture has come down to 12% (2014), it is still the main source of income 
for  one  third  of  the  population  and  for  64%  of  the  poor.  Declining  land  sizes,  complex  and 
insecure  tenure  arrangements  together  with  a  lack  of appropriate  technologies,  infrastructure, 
rural  finance  and  input  and  output  markets  results  in  sub-optimal  use  of  the  already  small 
landholdings  and  low  labour  productivity.  Small  farms  below  0.5  ha  dominate  with  a  share  of 
57%  in  Java  and  37%  off-Java  and  only  13%  of  farms  off-Java  are  larger  than  2  ha.  Many 
households depending on agriculture do not own any land at all and many farmers access land 
to grow subsistence food crops through share-cropping (20.4% off-Java) followed by fixed rent 
arrangements  (16.4%).  It  is  however  recognized  that  the  security  of  land  usage  varies 
substantially  from  village  to  village,  including  under  share  cropping  and  fixed  rental. As  such 
READ SI will need to be able to provide additional support on improving security of land usage 
arrangements  in  villages  where  this  is  a  barrier  to  further  investment  and  improvement  of 
production practice. This is only expected to be the case in a minority of village and, where it is 
an issue, largely concerning rice crop land but not affecting cocoa and other estate and upland 
crops.    
203.  There is considerable  variation  in the poverty  profile  of Sulawesi Island and  its  six Provinces. 
Three  of  the  six  Provinces  (Sulawesi  Tenggara,  Gorontalo  and  Sulawesi  Tengah)  have  rural 
poverty  rates  above  the  national  average,  whilst  the  other  three  (Sulawesi  Selatan,  Sulawesi 
Utara and Sulawesi Barat) have rural poverty rates lower than the national average. Whilst as a 
region Sulawesi Island is not as poor as Moluccas and Papua, it has a high population density 
of  people  living  below  the  poverty  line.  Incomes  from  agriculture  still  constitute  around  half  of 
total  rural  incomes  in  the  Sulawesi  Provinces,  although  this  figure  does  not  account  for  high 
numbers  of  unemployed  and  underemployed  earning  non-farm  incomes.  The  proportion  of 
unpaid  family  workers  in  agriculture  has  declined  and  shifted  towards  profit-generating  non-
farm  activities,  with  most  of  the  reduction  in  the  farmers’  population  experienced  in  the  15-24 
age group. 
204.  Table 1 details the incidence and numbers of poor across the six Provinces of Sulawesi Island 
as  compared  to  the  national  average.  The  table  focuses  on  Sulawesi  provinces  as  it  is  from 
these that the new READ SI districts will selected.

205.  The  Human  Development  Index  (HDI)  (a  composite  measure  that  includes  life  expectancy, 
income  and  education)  for  most  Sulawesi  Provinces  are  just  below  the  national  average  of 
0.684,  with  only  Sulawesi  Utara  having  a  higher  HDI  at  0.696.  However  when  the  HDI  is 
adjusted for inequality to take account of distribution across all three dimensions of the index, 
the  HDI  for  2014  falls  to  0.599,  a  loss  of  18.2%  due  to  inequality  in  the  distribution  of 
development. Rising inequality in income distribution and in access to land is widely recognised 
as a key challenge and threatening to roll back progress made in poverty reduction. Nutrition, 
not  represented  in  the  HDI,  continues  to  be  a  challenge  as  economic  growth  and  poverty 
reduction  has  not  been  linear  with  nutrition  outcomes. The  prevalence  of  chronic  malnutrition 
(also  called  stunting,  or  height-for-age)  actually  worsened  between  2010  (35.6%)  and  2013 
(37.2%)  in  Indonesia.  In  Sulawesi  data  on  key  nutrition  indicators  for  2014  reveal  a  complex 
picture  with  some  Provinces  scoring  significantly  lower  than  the  national  average;  table  2 
combines data on the HDI and key nutrition indicators.

206.  There  is  significant  variation  in  the  incidence  of  poverty  across  Sulawesi  Districts,  explained, 
amongst other factors, by: differences in availability, access and quality of arable land, isolation 
and  access  to  infrastructure  (particularly  irrigation  and  roads),  diverse  social  structures  and 
their  economic mobility,  conflict  and  sectarian  violence. The Agency  for Agricultural  Extension 
and  Human  Resource  Development  (AAEHRD)  will  gather  information  on  key  poverty

meantime, Annex 1 presents some further information on poverty at the District level.  
Indigenous  People.  Sulawesi  Island  is  both  ethnically  diverse  and  home  to  a  number  of 
Indigenous People (IPs). Many of the ethnic groups, such as the Bugis, Minahasa and Torajans 
are  relatively  economically  mobile,  as  well  as  having  elaborated  internal  social  structures, 
wealth  disparities  and  inequalities.  There  are  ten  major  ethnic  groups  in  Sulawesi  Island  (the 
Bali,  Banngai,  Bugis,  Buol,  Gorontalo,  Jawa,  Kaili,  Minahasa,  Saluan  and  Toraja),  many  of 
which have further distinctive sub-divisions. These ethnic groups, such as the Bugis and Toraja, 
whilst minorities on the national scale, often form the majority ethnic groups at the district level 
in  Sulawesi21.  However  there  are  also  numerous  Indigenous  People’s,  masyarakatadat, 
characterised  as  a  group  of  people  from  the  same  ancestral  lineage  who  have  a  set  of 
distinctive  ideological,  economic  and  political  systems,  as  well  as  territory.  There  is  no 
aggregated data on the comparative poverty levels of IPs, however it is evident  that these IPs 
are  disproportionately  represented  amongst  the  poor  because  they  live  remotely  (either 
because  they  have  been  marginalised  or  because  of  their  high  dependence  on  shifting 
agriculture);  because  socio-cultural  factors  have  precluded  their  inclusion  in  mainstream 
development  and  because  of  slow  and  incomplete  recognition  of  adat  rights  over  land  and 
natural resources. The main livelihood strategy of Indigenous People is shifting cultivation with 
sago, maize and root crops supplying subsistence, agricultural labour, migration and sometimes 
cocoa  as  a  cash  crop.    Further  information  on  IPs  in  the  short-listed  districts  will  be  collated 
during the district selection and socialisation workshops. (see below).  
Institutional and policy context of rural poverty in Sulawesi. Within the overarching policy 
framework of Indonesia,  which supports rural poverty reduction via conditional cash transfers, 
development  funds  for  infrastructure  via  the  Village  Fund,  agricultural  input  and  interest  rate 
subsidies, the district  governments of Sulawesi have  their own  decentralised approaches  and 
priorities. Despite the elaborate institutional support structure to support rural poverty reduction 
there are some general commonalities: (i) the poor are not well represented in local authorities 
and  rural  producers’  organisations;  (ii)  subsidies  and  free  inputs  are  poorly  targeted;  (iii) 
benefits  from  infrastructure  investments  are  incidental,  rather  than  targeted  and  (iv)  rural 
finance, though improving, is not accessible to  land-poor farmers. In addition, policy initiatives 
to  support  agri-business  and  private-public  partnerships  that  benefit  the  poor  –  such  as  for 
Cocoa in READ  - have been challenged by, amongst other factors: (i) the prevalence of state 
companies in the production and distribution of input supplies; (ii) multiple layers of regulation 
and;  (iii)  poor  access  to  capital  and  infrastructure.  These  factors  combined,  as  well  as  the 
progress  of  READ,  suggest  that  institutions  and  interventions  to  address  poverty  have  to  be 
rigorously targeted to have the intended poverty reduction effect.  
209.  Table 3 presents a typology of the programme target group by their assets, capacities, needs, 
priorities  and  proposed  pathways  in  which  the  programme  can  provide  differentiated  support. 
The households have been divided into the following broad types, although there is evidently a 
continuum  between  them:  (i)  households  in  which  access  to  arable  land  and  sufficient  labour 
enable  potential  economic  returns  from  agriculture;  (ii)  households  that  generate  economic 
returns  from  agriculture  but  on  land  that  is  share-cropped  or  under  long-term  tenure;  (iii) 
households  that  generate  subsistence  and/or  livelihood  returns  from  agriculture  as  part  of  a 
broader livelihood strategy and (iv) households whose main returns from agriculture are in the 
form  of  wages.  The  relative  poverty  levels  of  these  four  target  group  types  will  depend  on  a 
number of factors, mainly; access to irrigation, remoteness and market integration and access 
to  alternative  income  sources,  such  as  remittances.  However,  very  broadly,  households  that 
21For instance, Gorontalo, Sulawesi Utara and Sulawesi Selatan have well below the average national ethnic 
fractionalisation, although they are all home to ethnic minorities, respectively the Gorontalo, the Minahasa and the 
Bugis.

have  land,  fixed  share-cropping  or  long-lease  arrangements  will  be  less  vulnerable  than  the 
livelihood/subsistence and wage labour households.  
210.  Economic  returns  are  those  in  which  anticipated  returns  from  investments  in  agriculture  are 
equal to or above that from a migrant wage at minimum wage rates and subsistence/livelihood 
returns  are  those  in  which  programme  investments  can  reduce  household  vulnerability  and 
push  the  households  income  above  the  poverty  line.  The  minimum  wage  rates  are  set  by 
Provinces and in the Sulawesi region they range from IDR 1,875,000 per month in Gorontalo to 
IDR 2,400,000 in Sulawesi Utara

211.  Sulawesi Island presents diverse development challenges that reflect those experienced across 
Indonesia.  These  include,  amongst  others:  (i)  how  to  protect  poverty  reduction  gains  and 
support  inclusive  growth  in  the  context  of  growing  inequality,  especially  in  access  to  land;  (ii) 
how  to  improve  economic  efficiency  and  labour  productivity  in  agriculture;  (iii)  how  to  support 
lose  wages  as  a  result  of  growing  efficiencies  and 
agricultural 
mechanisation;  (iv)  how  to  support  the  transition  of  large  numbers  of  rural  poor  from  fully 
agricultural livelihoods to those also dependent on non-agricultural income; (v) how to balance 
resources between remote low population density locations with very poor households and less 
remote  high  population  density  locations  with  less  poor  households;  (vi)  how  to  develop  the 
capacity of the poor to protect their own interests in commercial, financial and policy realms and 
(vii)  how  to  ensure  that  gains  in  household  income  are  also  reflected  in  the  nutritional  status 
and well-being of household members.   
212.  READ has already made considerable progress in developing responses to these development 
challenges. Scaling-up the approach on Sulawesi Island as a whole in READ SI will support the 
programmatic  objectives  of  the  government  by  using  a  proven  model  as  a  vehicle  for 
interventions  and  activities 
that  address  defined  challenges  and  develop  replicable 
development responses. 
213.  Lessons for targeting strategy. The experience of READ, as well as the IFAD country portfolio, 
provides some lessons for targeting strategy of READ SI. IFAD supported projects have been 
generally  effective  in  identifying  poor  households,  using  government  indicators  and  poor 
household  lists  combined  with  participatory  selection  of  project  beneficiaries.  The  fact  that 
many  IFAD  supported  projects  provide  comparatively  small  financial  support  packages  and 
expect  considerable  active  participation  from  participants  in  return  supports  the  self-targeting 
nature  of  interventions.  This  broad  approach  will  be  replicated  in  the  targeting  strategy  for 
READ SI.  
214.  There are a number of areas in  which targeting strategies have proved less effective and  the 
design for READ SI will learn from these; (i) social mobilisation, inclusion and capacity building 
must  be  successfully  completed  before  economic  activities,  particularly  those  related  to 
infrastructure, begin; (ii) economic and livelihoods analysis, both preparatory and participatory, 
should support the  identification  of economic opportunities types; (iii) capacity  building should 
be linked to tangible programme opportunities, whether these are economic or social and finally 
(iv)  M&E  should  be  simple  and  support  the  generation  of  knowledge  on  key  development 
challenges, such as those listed above.  
Targeting Design Options  
215.  There were  a number of options for targeting  and capacity  building that  were considered and 
rejected during the course of the design, including:  
  Group 
the 
institutionalisation  of  groups 
Institutional/Cooperation.  Supporting 
into 
cooperatives, PTs, or other forms of legally registered groups to enable collective action and 
aggregation. This design option was discussed and rejected for the following reasons: (i) the 
poor  record  of  cooperatives  in  Indonesia  and  their  unproven  performance  in  delivering 
benefits to the poor; (ii) the broad lesson, drawn from READ and other projects, that groups 
are more sustainable when aggregation and institutionalisation is based on locally assessed 
demand  and  opportunity.  However,  whilst  not  a  programme  objective,  programme 
beneficiaries will be provided with information on options for formalisation and in the case of 
READ groups that are well established, assistance may be given to pursuing this route.  
  PPPs  in  the  Cocoa  Value  Chain.  The  suggestion  made  by  the  CPMT,  to  include  the 
smallholders,  the  ‘Producers’  in  the  cocoa  value  chain  work  of  the  programme,  was  given 
much  consideration.  Whilst  the  core  idea  of  drawing  Producers  into  the  public-private 
46 
Republic of Indonesia 
Rural Empowerment and Agricultural Development Programme Scaling-up Initiative (READ SI) 
Final programme design report 
Appendix 2:  Poverty, targeting and gender 
partnership via contracts and/or formalised rights and responsibilities over cocoa production is 
tempting it was rejected as unrealistic given the current dynamics and structure of the cocoa 
sector  in  Sulawesi  with  multiple  layers  of  traders  between  producers  and  the  main  cocoa 
businesses.  
  Revolving Fund to SCG. READ provided technical production inputs in the form of revolving 
funds to groups. This option had mixed success, some groups are still revolving these funds, 
many other groups have disbanded without any savings. The READ SI design has chosen to 
separate the technical inputs (provided free if the applicant has attended training, participated 
in  groups  and  shown  savings  discipline)  and  the  SCG  activities  of  the  programme.  The 
experience of READ, as well as other projects, shows that groups are more likely to save and 
benefit from related social capital formation if the savings are their own.  
  Group formation based on SCG vs Activity. The hardest design choice was whether to support 
group  formation  around  SCG  activities  or  group  formation  around  a  chosen  agricultural  or 
livelihood  activity.  The  rationale  for  the  former  is  that  SCG  activities  require  social  capital, 
whereas  the  agricultural/livelihood  activities  are  based  around  household  needs  and  only 
need group work for training inputs. Despite this, the groups will be formed around an activity 
focus  for  the  following  reasons:  (i)  the  SCG  activities  will  be  made  in  the  context  of  similar 
economic activities; (ii) it enables the VF and PPL to coordinate their capacity building inputs 
more effectively; (iii) it is easier to identify options and develop proposals for infrastructure if 
the groups have a common activity focus.  
216.  The  following,  drawn  on  the  experience  of  READ  and  the  IFAD  portfolio,  and  reflecting  the 
programmatic  and  scaling-up  objectives  of  the  government,  are  the  key  elements  of  the 
targeting strategy.  
Targeting Strategy 
217.  The  target  group.  READSI  will  apply  an  inclusive  targeting  approach,  with  a  majority  of 
activities targeted towards poorer farmers but also allowing inclusion of some less poor farmers 
in  programme  supported  groups  and  activities.  Poor  and  near  poor  farmers  will  comprise  at 
least  90%  of  direct  beneficiaries.  The  target  groups  will  include:  (i)  landless  and  land-poor, 
including  women-headed households,  who  will be included  in activities directed at homestead 
gardening,  improved nutrition  and financial literacy  and; (ii) the  poor and near  poor  who  have 
the potential to generate economic returns from agriculture  with  programme support. The first 
target  group  will  be  involved  in  ‘livelihood’  activities,  with  the  recognition  that  agriculture  is  a 
declining  yet critical  aspect of household  livelihood strategies,  whilst the second  group  will be 
formed around the selected agricultural commodities. The objectives and monitoring indicators 
for the performance of the ‘livelihood’ and ‘agriculture’ interventions of the programme will differ. 
Women  will  constitute  50%  of  the  overall  target  group.  As  noted  below,  the  programme  has 
provisions for including Indigenous People in the targeted villages. 
218.  Geographic Targeting. The programme will be implemented in 18 districts in six provinces, 4 
provinces  on  Sulawesi  Island  plus West  Kalimantan  and  NTT. The  long  list  of  districts  will  be 
compiled from those that have both high poverty levels and agricultural potential. It is expected 
that  around  80  villages  of  READ  SI  will  be  drawn  from  existing  villages  in  Sulawesi  Tengah, 
West  Kalimantan  and  NTT  that  can  be  supported  to  access  more  sophisticated  and 
differentiated development interventions. The shortlist of districts will include those that: (i) have 
high  poverty  levels;  (ii)  agricultural  potential  accessible  to  the  target  group;  (iii)  District 
governments willing to contribute to programme objectives through resource and policy support 
and (iv) enable the programme to address diverse and varied development challenges and that 
can further develop READ as a programmatic platform for rural development. The new districts 
will  be  selected  before  the  inception  of  the  programme  in  a  series  of  socialisation  workshops 
that will enable a greater focus on detail, particularly regarding district government willingness 
to contribute to programme objectives. District level data on Indigenous People, which cannot 
47 
Republic of Indonesia 
Rural Empowerment and Agricultural Development Programme Scaling-up Initiative (READ SI) 
Final programme design report 
Appendix 2:  Poverty, targeting and gender 
be correlated with poverty from the data available at the national level, will also be considered 
in more detail during these socialisation workshops.  
219.  Village  Selection.  The  same  factors  –  poverty,  agricultural  potential,  commitment  to 
programme poverty objectives – will be used to select villages for the programme. The village 
will be selected immediately after programme inception by the DPMO with support from DPIUs. 
Whilst the AAEHRD is the agency with overall responsibility for programme implementation, the 
district  SEKDA  has  overall  responsibility  for  ensuring  effective  decentralisation  of  government 
services  and  coordinating  line  agencies.  Village  selection  should  therefore  be  done  in  close 
cooperation  to  ensure  that  programme  interventions  benefit  from  and  contribute  to  wider 
development processes being planned in the district.  
220. 
Indigenous Peoples. The programme area is home to a number of indigenous peoples and/or 
ethnic  minorities.  In  case  a  village  that  was  shortlisted  on  the  basis  of  its  poverty  and 
agricultural  potential  is  inhabited  by  indigenous  peoples  and/or  ethnic  minorities,  the 
programme  will  ensure  that:  1)  before  the  selection  of  the  village  in  question  is  finalised,  the 
district-level  “socialisation  process”  will  include  consultations  with  local  indigenous  peoples 
and/or  ethnic  minorities. The  village  facilitators  will  be  trained  to  facilitate  these  consultations, 
taking  into  account  the  customary  institutions  and  governance  arrangements,  as  well  as  the 
traditional  authority  structures,  of  the  indigenous  peoples  and/or  ethnic  minorities  concerned; 
and 2) the consultations will produce a short stakeholder consultation report (in local language 
and in Bahasa), which will include an in principle agreement broadly based on the notion of free 
prior and informed consent; the reports will be posted on the  programme’s website. Once the 
decision  to  include  the  village  in  question  is  finalised,  the  programme  will  ensure  that:  (i)  the 
baseline survey accounts for IP households; (ii) IP households, whether or not they are in the 
majority, are explicitly included in the social mobilisation process and (iii)  programme activities 
and  the  PRA  process  will  ensure  that  needs  and  priorities  of  all  households,  including  IP 
households, are explicitly explored and recorded. In addition, as noted in appendix 4, grievance 
and  redressal  systems  will  be  made  available  for  all  participating  households.  Two  areas  in 
which potential IP influenced needs will be anticipated and explored is in the support for locally 
grown  crops  as  well  as  preferences,  needs  and  priorities  that  will  affect  programme  nutrition 
interventions.  In  addition,  financial  literacy  training,  which  will  include  modules  on  household 
economy, will be enhanced to address issues emerging as relevant to IPs through the PRA and 
mobilisation process. The programme will also ensure that the concerns of indigenous peoples 
and/or  ethnic  minorities  are  included  during  the  local  planning  process  aimed  at  accessing 
financing under the Village Fund and other GoI programmes for which the village in question is 
eligible. 
221.  Direct Targeting. Programme interventions will be targeted directly to the target group who will 
identified through village poverty lists triangulated with participatory targeting based on income, 
asset  ownership  and  non-income  dimensions  of  poverty  adjusted  to  local  realities.  The  1-7 
scale  of  criteria  used  in  READ  was  considered  too  complex  as  well  as  not  flexible  enough  to 
account  for  village  level  differences  in  poverty  types.  Further,  participatory  targeting,  through 
PRA,  enables  the  identification  of  poor  households  to  be  linked  to  poverty  and  livelihoods 
analysis  that  can  be  used  for  planning  purposes.  Appendix  4  provides  more  detail  on  the 
process for direct targeting. 
222.  Self-targeting.  The  self-targeting  aspects  of  the  design  are  supported  through  extensive 
livelihood  and  economic  analysis  during  the  design  work  (to  be  completed).  The  distinction 
between  ‘livelihoods’  and  ‘agricultural  growth’  objectives  ensure  that  interventions  respond 
specifically to the priorities, assets and labour capacity of the identified target groups. The early 
stages  of  social  mobilization  and  planning  will  support  target  group  inclusion  to  ensure  that 
implementation is developed around local needs and constraints, and considered to be relevant 
and  affordable.  READ  SI  will  also  further  improve  the  self-targeting  strength  of  the  design  by 
placing  controls  over  the  allocation  of  resources  and  interventions  around  infrastructure;  this 
48 
Republic of Indonesia 
Rural Empowerment and Agricultural Development Programme Scaling-up Initiative (READ SI) 
Final programme design report 
Appendix 2:  Poverty, targeting and gender 
was the principal intervention that attracted the better-off in READ before the mid-term. In short, 
not  only  will  the  interventions  be  targeted  to  the  needs  of  the  poor,  but  the  participation  and 
capacity building required to access benefits will be a deterrent to the less poor.  
223.  Empowerment  and  Capacity  Building.  Measures  to  build  capacity  and  include  those  who 
have  less  voice  and  power  are  an  integral  part  of  the  READ  approach.  The  extensive  social 
mobilisation  process  is  a  tested  method,  further  outlined  in Appendix  4,  to  engage  the  poor, 
whilst specific measures to build the capacity of the poor include:  
  Financial literacy training and support for SCG to build the social and human capital. 
  Capacity to plan and act collectively to further common interests.  
  Capacity for organisational planning.  
  Demand-driven extension training to develop skills in agricultural/livelihood activities.  
  Nutrition training to support the human capital at the household level.  
 
 
 
Improved  access  to  affordable  rural  finance  through  bank  linkages,  improved  understanding 
of options and capacity to negotiate terms of trade.  
Improved capacity to plan infrastructure investments and represent needs and interests to the 
village government.  
Inputs and activities directed toward supporting sustainable transition away from a culture of 
input dependency.  
224.  Procedural.  A  number  of  procedural  measures  have  been  put  in  place  to  ensure  that  the 
programme will be able to deliver the planned benefits to the target group.  
  An  SM  service  provider  will  be  appointed  from  programme  inception  to  ensure  that  all  the 
social mobilisation, inclusion and targeting work is undertaken to a high standard.  
  The programme will appoint a SM Consultant within the NPMO who will have responsibility for 
inclusion targets.  
  The PPLs recruited for the programme will have training, in additional to extension training, in 
basic  social  mobilisation  skills,  as  well  as  training  in  how  to  ensure  that  due  process,  with 
regard to free, prior and informed consent, is followed in villages populated by IPs.   
  The  availability  of  human  resources,  including  the  target  number  of  women,  to  fulfil  VF  and 
PPL positions has been verified during the design.  
  Detailed  terms  of  reference  are  provided  with  the  design,  which  outline  responsibilities  for 
social mobilisation.  
225.  Enabling.  A  number  of  enabling  measures  create  and  sustain  a  policy  and  operational 
environment favourable to social and gender inclusion, including: 
  READ SI was designed in close cooperation with stakeholders at all government levels who 
are aware of the social and gender inclusion agenda.  
  There  is  already  widespread  policy  support  for  agricultural  interventions  that  can  deliver 
poverty impacts.  
  District  governments  have  replicated  the  READ  approach  following  project  closure,  showing 
both commitment to the approach and capacity to implement.  
  Preference  will  be  given  to  eligible  Districts  that  are  willing  to  support  READ  SI  through 
supportive policy measures.

  Component  2  will  address  many  of  the  policy  and  regulatory  factors  causing  systemic  and 
structural constraints to poverty reduction through agricultural growth.  
C.  Gender Strategy 
226.  Despite  the  national  commitment  to  gender  equality  and  the  supportive  policy  framework  the 
GDI  (sex-disaggregated  HDI)  for  Indonesia  was  0.706  for  males  and  0.655  for  females.  This 
reflects  lesser  progress  in  education,  health,  life-expectancy  and  command  over  economic 
resources. The gender Inequality Index for Indonesia was 0.494 in 2014 and the country ranks 
121 out of 157 countries.22  The maternal mortality rate (228 per 100,000) is one of the highest 
in Southeast Asia. Women’s participation in the labour force is high, but women in general earn 
less  than  men  whether  employed  in  the  formal  or  informal  sectors.  Poor  women  are  often 
physically overworked, increasingly taking over primary production as men migrate and get little 
reward or recognition for their labour. Despite significant and increasing decision-making power 
and responsibility,  women generally do not own productive resources and have lesser access 
to information and formal decision-making structures. Women’s economic activities tend to be 
channelled  through  female  dominated  informal  trading  and  labour  networks  whilst  social 
activities  are  either  similarly  informal  or  religious.  The  main  government  support  structure  for 
women  at  the  community  level  is  the  Pemberdayaan  dan  Kesejahteraan  Keluarga  (PKK)  the 
essential women’s organization throughout Indonesia.  
227.  Sulawesi Island is ethnically and culturally diverse; however apart from some very conservative 
pockets  and  perhaps  some  ethnic  minorities  (to  be  explored  during  final  design)  there  are  no 
evident barriers to women’s participation. Like elsewhere in Indonesia, ownership and control of 
property  remains  an  issue  and  control  over  decision-making  is  usually  exercised  in  the 
household and administrative (including public office) domains; it is rare to find women as key 
decision-makers in the commercial sphere. Female illiteracy has declined, however pockets of 
it remain and are linked to poor household nutrition outcomes, as shown in table 2.  
228.  Reflection on the experience of gender inclusion in READ before and after the MTR, as well as 
the performance of gender in the IFAD country portfolio in general, is instructive. The lesson in 
brief  is  that  whilst  there  is  a  de  fault  tendency  to  exclude  women  from  programme  activities 
there  is  no  cultural  barrier  to  their  inclusion  (with  a  few  inevitable  exceptions)  and  that  with  a 
simple  gender  strategy  and  clear  objectives  inclusion  rates  of  50%  are  entirely  realistic.  The 
exception is CCDP, as fisheries is dominated by capture fisheries, clearly in the male division of 
labour. READ in the first phase had gender targets however the lack of operational guidelines 
and  clear  responsibilities  for  gender  resulted  in  low  levels  of  female  participation.  Early 
emphasis  on  infrastructure  investments  further  alienated  women  from  directly  participating  as 
these were planned and decided by male dominated UPDDs. At mid-term there were 124 male 
groups  and  19  female  groups  and  295  mixed  groups  with  7375  male  participants  and  2723 
female participants.  
229.  The participation of women in READ at project completion was 51% with a general recognition 
that women’s groups performed comparatively well against all major indicators (organisational, 
administrative, financial), including 10,148 women in 494 groups. The number of female Village 
Facilitators  (VFs)  and  Penyuluh  Pertanian  Lapangan  (PPLs)  or  Field  Extension  Workers 
increased to nearly 50% with no reported gender obstacles to their performance; in fact when 
gender was brought up female VFs were generally considered to be more suited. Three main 
factors  seem  to  explain  this  dramatic  improvement  in  project  gender  performance:  (i)  the 
definition  of  clear  targets  with  responsibilities  assigned  to  pursue  these;  (ii)  putting  the 
resources  directly  in  the  hands  of  the  beneficiaries  rather  than  routing  these  through  male 
22The  Gender  Inequality  Index  (GII)  is  a  new  index  for  measurement  of  gender  disparity  that  was  introduced  in  2010.  This  index  is  a 
composite measure which captures the loss of achievement, within a country, due to gender inequality, and uses three dimensions to do so: 
reproductive  health,  empowerment,  and  labor  market  participation.  The  value  of  GII  ranges  between  0  to 1, with  0  being  0%  inequality, 
indicating women fare equally in comparison to men and 1 being 100% inequality, indicating women fare poorly in comparison to men.

dominated Village Fund Management Unit (UPDDs) and (iii) developing interventions geared to 
women’s  expressed  interests,  ie:  homestead  gardening  and  off-farm  interventions.  Regarding 
the  latter,  challenges  remain:  of  the  15,350  farmers  who  were  members  of  the  agriculture 
commodity groups only 4,700 were women. Whilst not in itself an issue, it will be important for 
the READ design process to further ensure that READ SI supports women’s economic as well 
as social empowerment.  
230.  The READ SI approach to gender inclusion includes a number of measures detailed further in 
Appendix 4. These include:  
(i) 
Gender targets of 50% for programme participants and VFs (mission fieldwork 
suggests that this is a realistic target).  
(ii)  Gender sensitive selection of interventions to maximise returns to women’s labour 
and support their social and economic empowerment (the process is explained in 
depth in Annex 4).  
(iii) 
The mainstreaming of gender into the social mobilisation process, as outlined in 
Annex 4.  
(iv)  Direct targeting of homestead gardening interventions to women.  
(v) 
A secret vote on infrastructure choices to enable women to express preferences.  
(vi)  The inclusion and prioritisation of women as Financial Literacy Facilitators on financial 
literacy training.  
(vii)  A gender inclusive programme management and implementation team, including the 
appointment of private service providers with experience in gender and social 
inclusion.  
(viii)  Adherence to best practice in gender sensitive monitoring and evaluation of 
programme impact.  
D.  Targeting Risk Mitigation 
231.  There  are  a  number  of  risks  associated  with  the  targeting  strategy; Table  4  outlines  these  as 
well as proposed mitigating strategies.

E.  Annex 1: District Poverty and Development Data 
232.  The  AAEHRD  is  compiling  current  district  level  data  on  the  following:  poverty  levels  and 
numbers,  employment,  key  income  sources,  average  size  of  landholding  by  type  (irrigated, 
arable etc.), migration and remittances, education and literacy, access to services and nutrition 
(stunting, wasting, malnutrition). These, together with the list of Disadvantaged Districts, will be 
used to develop a  short-list of districts to be included in the  Programme. As noted above, the 
short list of Districts will include those that: (i) have high poverty levels; (ii) agricultural potential 
accessible  to  the  target  group  (iii)  District  governments  willing  to  contribute  to  programme 
objectives  through  resource  and  policy  support  and  (iv)  enable  the  Programme  to  address 
diverse  and  varied  development  challenges  and  that  can  further  develop  READ  as  a 
programmatic platform for rural development. The districts will be selected before the inception 
of the Programme.  
233.  The  tables  below  are  drawn  from  the  Food  Security  and  Vulnerability  Atlas  (World  Food 
Program  2015). They  provide  a  composite  food  security  and  vulnerability  analysis,  classifying 
districts into food and nutrition security priority groups according to the severity and causes of 
the food and nutrition security situation. This recent Atlas provides a good indication of overall 
poverty  levels  as  it  examines:  (i)  normative  food  consumption  to  production  data;  (ii)  poverty 
levels; (iii) access to infrastructure such as roads, electricity, water; (iv) levels of stunting and (v) 
life expectancy.  
234.  Districts are ranked into priority groups, based on how they score against a composite of these 
indicators.  Districts  designated  as  priority  group  1  are  those  most  vulnerable  to  food  and 
nutrition insecurity, while districts in priority group 6 are the most food secure. Districts in priority 
groups 1 and 2 are severely vulnerable to food and nutrition insecurity; those in priority groups 
3  and  4  are  moderately  vulnerable,  and  significantly  better  off  than  those  in  groups  1  and  2. 
Districts  in  priority  groups  3  and  4  have  similar  levels  of  food  and  nutrition  insecurity,  but 
differences in the underlying determinants driving vulnerability distinguish group 3 districts from 
those in group 4. Priority groups 5 and 6 are the least vulnerable to food and nutrition insecurity. 
In  sum,  Sulawesi  Districts  are  spread  across  priority  groups  3-4  in  Sulawesi  Tengah  and 
Gorontalo,  whilst  the  other  Provinces  have  Districts  mainly  in  priority  groups  5-6,  with  some 
pockets in priority group 3. 
235.  Table 1 below provides a ranking of all Sulawesi districts, whilst table 2 provides a short-list of 
35  districts  with  poverty  rates  higher  than  the  national  average  of  14%,  with  the  exception  of 
ToliToli and Sigi in Sulawesi Tengah, which will be included because they are READ districts. As 
explained, this short-list will be integrated with recent data on agricultural potential, indigenous 
populations,  particular  development  challenges  relevant  for  generating  lessons  and  district 
willingness  to  support  Programme  objectives.  Socialisation  workshops  will  be  held  prior  to 
Programme inception to introduce Programme objectives and finalise geographic targeting.

Appendix 3:  Country performance and lessons learned 
236.  The recent COSOP preparation mission summarized the country performance and key lessons 
as below.  
Past Results, Impact and Performance 
237.  Portfolio. Since IFAD started its partnership with Indonesia in 1980, fifteen loan projects have 
been developed, totalling USD 827 million, of which USD 416 million financed by IFAD. IFAD’s 
support  has  focused  on  the  poor,  food  insecure  and  ethnic  minority  communities  in  rain-fed, 
upland, coastal and  other  marginalised areas.  Most  projects have targeted  Eastern Indonesia 
because  of  the  higher  incidence  of  poverty  in  this  part  of  the  country,  weaker  institutional 
capacity  and  lower  level  of  engagement  of  other  donors  and  the  private  sector.  The  country 
programme  has  also  given  prominence  to  women  empowerment  and  the  transformation  of 
gender relations in socio-economic development.  
238.  The current country programme includes three investment projects, with a fourth project to be 
approved end  of 2015, totalling USD1,410 million,  of which 244 funded by IFAD as shown by 
Table  1.  Four  country  grants  adding  value  to  the  investment  programme  are  currently  being 
implemented, for a total of USD 10.7 million.

239.  CPE. In 2013, IFAD’s Independent Office of Evaluation undertook a second country programme 
evaluation (CPE), which focused on operations since 2004. The CPE assessed overall portfolio 
achievement  as  moderately  satisfactory.  Project  objectives  were  considered  relevant,  but 
project  designs  were  deemed  complex  and  insufficiently  focused.  Furthermore,  it  was  found 
that  most  recent  projects  covered  very  large  geographical  areas  with  low  population  density, 
which led to spreading resources too thinly. The building of institutions, and in particular of self-
help groups, empowering smallholders and opening access to savings and credit, was a cross-
cutting  feature  of  the  portfolio.  Women  empowerment  was  another  strong  feature  of  the 
portfolio.  Women  increased  their  decision-making  and  financial  management  capabilities  in 
their households, accessed functional literacy or started micro-enterprises. However, the CPE 
noted  that  insufficient  attention  was  given  to  developing  production  or  supporting  value  chain 
inclusion.  Sustainability  was  another  problematic  area,  because  of  still  limited  local  capacities 
and  of  weak  project  knowledge  management  systems  limiting  the  ability  to  learn  from 
experience  and  to  sustain  success.  Project  cost  per  beneficiary  household  ranged  from  USD 
126 to a high USD 1,414, which the CPE attributed to high transaction costs in remote areas.  
240.  On the country programme management, the CPE concluded that the 2009-2013 COSOP was 
strong  on  goals  and  expectations  but  that  the  implementation  framework  was  weak.  Results 
59

Rural Empowerment and Agricultural Development Programme Scaling-up Initiative (READ SI)

Appendix 3:  Country performance and lessons learned 
related to non-lending activities were deemed limited, particularly given Indonesia’s MIC status, 
which  would  have  warranted  increased  policy  dialogue,  knowledge  management  and 
partnership building. Synergies across projects and between lending and non-lending activities 
were deemed insufficient. The CPE concluded that IFAD had largely acted as a project-based 
organisation in Indonesia and recommended a paradigm shift, whereby IFAD would take up a 
leading  role  in  supporting  productive,  competitive  and  high  value  smallholder  agriculture,  by 
promoting  and  scaling  up  agriculture  innovation  in  partnership  with  the  government  and  other 
strategic partners, such as producers organisations and the private sector. 
241.  Strategic  change.  Building  on  the  CPE,  IFAD  has  embarked  on  a  major  reorientation  of  the 
country  programme.  To  better  align  the  Fund’s  programming  with  the  government’s  medium-
term planning cycle, an interim country strategy (2014-2015) was endorsed in 2013, which gave 
emphasis to strengthening producers’ organisations, enhancing productivity and marketing and 
developing enabling government policies and capacities in the agriculture and fisheries sector. 
Ongoing projects were restructured to focus on productive activities and market access, along 
value  chains  building  on  target  areas  potential.  New  models  for  partnering  with  private 
stakeholders have been built in the farming sector and in the broad sector of marine resources. 
Strategic  alliances  have  been  developed  with  development  partners  (including  with  the Asian 
Development  Bank  (ADB)  in  the  key  sub-sectors  of  irrigation  and  rice),  building  on  IFAD’s 
expertise  in  promoting  small  scale  rural  enterprises.  New  country  and  regional  grants  explore 
innovative approaches, support knowledge sharing and policy development. They also bring in 
new international partners and expertise in programme-related areas, such as high productivity 
cocoa  farming  (Swisscontact),  roots  and  tuber  development  (International  Potato  Centre), 
(Agrofuturo  Global, 
nutrition-sensitive  value  chains,  certification-based  supply  chains 
Sustainable  Commodity  Initiative  and  Institute  for  Ethical  and  Environmental  Certification), 
sustainable  management  of  peatland  (ASEAN  Peatland  Forest  Project),  knowledge  to  policy 
models in the irrigation sector, and farmers’ organisations participation in the policy dialogue. A 
country  office  is  opening  in  Jakarta  and  the  country  team  staff  is  building  up,  both  in-country 
and at IFAD headquarters. These developments, which took place over the last year  and half, 
lay the foundation for the 2015-2019 country strategy. 
Lessons Learned - from CPE 
242.  Main  lessons  derived  from  the  CPE,  annual  COSOP  reviews  and  consultations  held  in 
preparation to the new COSOP point to the following issues: 
(i) 
(ii) 
Targeting remote areas: working in remote areas entails specific constraints, including 
lower  local  capacities,  lower  infrastructure  endowment,  less  market  and  partnership 
opportunities  and  costly  logistics  issues.  Projects  can  generate  significant  and 
sustainable  improvements  in  the  livelihoods  of  communities  in  marginalised  areas, 
provided such constraints are recognised and addressed in project design. This calls 
for  projects  with  adequate  financial  and  human  resources,  longer  duration  and 
carefully designed packages combining productive infrastructure, sustainable service 
delivery mechanisms and the capacity building of local organisations;  
Empowerment  and  group  formation:  empowerment  through  group  formation  and 
capacity building should not constitute an end in itself but rather a means to facilitate 
activities  that  can  increase  household  incomes.  IFAD  strategy  should  focus  on 
strengthening  producers’  organisations  so  that  they  generate  direct  benefits  to  their 
members,  including  accessing  technical  and  financial  services,  engaging  with 
markets,  reducing 
transaction  costs,  partnering  with  private  companies  and 
enhancing  their  bargaining  position.  Group  sustainability,  individual  motivation, 
ownership and incentive mechanisms for participation should be clearly established; 
60

Final programme design report 
Appendix 3:  Country performance and lessons learned 
(iii)  Role  of  communities:  village  communities  can  play  an  important  role  in  promoting 
development  change  by  motivating  groups,  participating  in  the  allocation  of  project 
resources to increase transparency and monitoring their utilisation;   
(iv)  Productive  investment:  investment  in  physical  infrastructure  such  as  irrigation,  post-
harvest  and  processing  facilities  has  generated  high  economic  returns  through 
increased productivity and value-added. However, sustainability is often problematic. 
Institutional  arrangements  for  operation  and  cost  recovery  need  to  be  agreed  upon 
prior to investment, build on public-private partnerships and be supported by capacity 
building programmes; 
(v) 
Access  to  financial  services:  self-help  groups  (SHGs)  have  been  encouraged  to 
mobilise  savings  and  manage  revolving  funds.  Savings  mobilisation  has  enabled 
individuals  and  groups  to  access  credit  from  the  formal  financial  sector.  However 
SHGs  have  had  limited  sustainability  because  of  insufficient  capacities  and  low 
viability. On the other hand, Indonesia has a diverse financial sector, which has tried 
some  unique  innovations  to  enhance  outreach  to  rural  areas  but  access  to  finance 
remains  a  constraint  for  small  producers  in  the  agriculture  and  fisheries  sector. 
Projects  should  partner  with  commercial  banks,  MFIs  and  other  types  of  financial 
institutions  to  support  the  access  of  small  producers  and  their  organisations  to  a 
range  of  financial  products  meeting  their  needs  and  matching  their  capacities, 
including savings, loans, access to remittance and insurance products; 
(vi)  Participation  of  non-state  actors:  the  lack  of  qualified  government  staff  in  some 
remote  target  areas  has  hampered  the  development  of  viable  and  sustainable  self-
help  and  producers’  groups.  To  provide  support  services  and  strengthen  the 
capacities  of  local  groups,  projects  should  promote  innovative  models  relying  on  a 
larger  range  of  service  providers,  including  producers’  organisations  themselves 
where they have a comparative advantage, private companies involved  in the trading 
and processing of agriculture/marine commodities and in the provision of inputs, and 
non-governmental organisations (NGOs); 
(vii)  Participation  of  the  private  sector:  experience  in  the  cocoa  (READ)  and  marine 
resources  (CCDP)  sub-sectors  have  demonstrated  how  private  companies  can 
contribute  to  enhancing  the  livelihoods  of  rural  small  scale  producers,  by  facilitating 
their  access  to  inputs,  technology,  advisory  services  and  markets.  Projects  should 
facilitate and support partnerships linking private companies and small producers and 
their  organisations,  with  a  view  to  generating  mutual  business  benefits  by  reducing 
transactions  costs,  sharing  risks  and  improving  efficiency  and  reliability  for  sourcing 
products and services. 
Lessons learned from READ.  
243.  Key success factors for READ, as identified by the implementing partners of READ, include:  
(i) 
its relevant core approach of smallholder empowerment and service delivery for 
production increase;  
(ii) 
a simple design with a strong poverty alleviation focus;  
(iii) 
the generally strong and motivated management at national and district level; and  
(iv) 
the combination and integration of technical expertise from different service providers, 
including public extension agents, NGOs and private sector.  
244.  Additional  lessons  learned  from  READ  that  are  relevant  for  the  forthcoming  READ  SI 
programme are: 
(i) 
integrating empowerment with targeted technical support increases effectiveness;  
61

Appendix 3:  Country performance and lessons learned 
(ii) 
diversifying extension service improves the capacities available for rural communities;  
(iii) 
(iv) 
(v) 
(vi) 
involving the private sector can strengthen service delivery, access to new 
technologies and access to markets;  
involving a neutral facilitator in negotiating a private public partnership can ensure 
mutual beneficial agreements;  
involving village elders in decision making processes ensures greater participation 
and smoother implementation;  
the phasing of activities can help reduce the risk of elite capture if decisions 
concerning high value investments, such as infrastructure, are delayed until later in 
the project to allow the social capital and confidence of poorer target groups to 
develop to ensure their voice is properly represented in these major decisions; 
(vii)  a decentralized management structure ensures flexible and targeted project activities. 
245. 
In terms of targeting,  lessons to be drawn from the experience  of READ, as  well as the IFAD 
country portfolio, provides some lessons for the targeting strategy of READ SI. IFAD supported 
projects  have  been  generally  effective  in  identifying  poor  households,  using  government 
indicators  and  poor  household 
lists  combined  with  participatory  selection  of  project 
beneficiaries. The fact that many IFAD supported projects provide comparatively small financial 
support  packages  and  expect  considerable  active  participation  from  participants  in  return 
supports the self-targeting nature of interventions. This broad approach will be replicated in the 
targeting strategy for READ SI as it was in READ.  
246.  There are a number of areas in  which targeting strategies have proved less effective and  the 
design for READ SI will learn from these; (i) social mobilisation, inclusion and capacity building 
must  be  successfully  completed  before  economic  activities,  particularly  those  related  to 
infrastructure, begin; (ii) economic and livelihoods analysis, both preparatory and participatory, 
should support the  identification  of economic opportunities types; (iii) capacity  building should 
be linked to tangible project opportunities, whether these are economic or social and finally (iv) 
M&E  should  be  simple  and  support  the  generation  of  knowledge  on  key  development 
challenges, such as those listed above.

247.  READ SI will maintain the core set of integrated activities in programme villages that were the 
foundation of the original READ's success. Building on this proven foundation, the component 
structure  will  be  re-organized  to  better  enable  the  advancement  of  complementary  aspects  of 
the READ model outside the villages as well as the move to a programmatic approach capable 
of being implemented in a wider range of local settings. The Components and Sub-components 
are described in detail in this Appendix and are: 
Component 1: Village agriculture and livelihoods development (all districts) 
1.1 Community mobilization 
1.2 Agriculture and livelihoods 
1.3 Savings, loans and financial literacy 
1.4 Nutrition, including early childhood nutrition (i.e. "the first 1000 days") 
Component 2: Services, inputs and market linkages 
2.1 Agricultural extension services (all districts)

Appendix 4:  Detailed programme description 
249.  This  Component  is  the  core  of  the  programme  focusing  on  the  proven  READ  approach  of 
community  mobilization  closely  integrated  with  agriculture  and  livelihood  development  within 
programme villages with Village Facilitators and technical extension staff working hand in hand 
in each village. It includes all activities within the villages. 
250.  For presentational and budgeting purposes only, the elements of the integrated village process 
are  summarized  below  around  the  four  complementary  dimensions  which  will  run  in  parallel 
with the programme supported households and common interest groups: 
i.  Community mobilization 
ii.  Agriculture and livelihoods 
iii.  Savings and credit 
iv.  Nutrition, including early childhood nutrition (i.e. "the first 1000 days") 
251.  Around 80% of READ SI villages are expected to be "new" READ SI villages while around 20% 
will  be  "old"  villages  that  were  also  part  of  the  original  READ  project  or  the  MoA  own  initial 
READ  replication  in  West  Kalimantan  and  NTT.  Differentiated  intervention  strategies  will  be 
adopted in new versus old villages. 
252.  The  four  dimensions  above  will  remain  relevant  to  all  READ  SI  villages,  however  the  original 
READ  villages  will  be  at  a  more  advanced  stage  of  development  in  terms  of  the  programme 
focus areas and so will be supported with a selected set of more advanced interventions, which 
are summarized at the end of this section. This will enable these advanced interventions to be 
tested  and  refined  in  a  limited  number  of  villages  before  being  rolled-out  later  to  new 
programme  villages  which  will  enable  READ  to  continue  to  innovate  around  emerging  critical 
issues while delivering strong impacts with increasing efficiency in new villages 
253.  Each of the four dimensions of the component are described as sub-components below but will 
in fact be implemented as a single integrated process in the village, with Village Facilitators and 
agricultural  extension  staff  (PPLs)  working  hand-in-hand  as  a  single  team  to  coordinate  and 
deliver the integrated process as has been the foundation for the success of READ to date. 
1.1 Community Mobilisation 
Overview 
254.  The rural poor who form the primary target group for READ operate in an environment in which 
there  is  very  little  effective  support  for  their  needs.  Technical  and  financial  services  are  not 
tailored  to  livelihood  complexity,  earmarked  input  services  often  do  not  reach  their  target  and 
infrastructure  investments  are  rarely  planned  around  the  needs  of  the  poorest  community 
members.  Recent  policies  decentralise  resources  to  the  village  level,  yet  in  the  absence  of 
deliberate  attempts  to  include  the  poor  it  is  likely  that  this  group  will  continue  to  be  excluded 
from key services and their voices remain unheard.  
255.  The experience of READ shows that community mobilisation can change these dynamics. Sub-
component  1.1  draws  on  the  lessons  from  READ  to  develop  a  design  for  Social  Mobilisation 
that will support poor people to mobilise around their economic interests and use social capital 
developed through Savings and  Credit Groups (SCG) to promote their interests and influence 
wider planning processes. A number of lessons from READ are relevant, these include:  
(i) 
Social mobilisation and technical support should be combined to provide a 
comprehensive service that outlines economic options and the means with which to 
pursue these.  
64 
Republic of Indonesia 
Rural Empowerment and Agricultural Development Programme Scaling-up Initiative (READ SI) 
Final programme design report 
Appendix 4:  Detailed programme description 
(ii) 
(iii) 
Specialist social mobilisation services are critical and the quality of this work is 
fundamental to achieving Programme outcomes.  
It is important to start the social mobilisation process at the very start of engagement 
in the villages.  
(iv)  The PPLs should be trained in basic aspects of social mobilisation that should be 
integral to their extension skills, to be replicated in further contexts, even though they 
are not expected to lead SM activities by themselves. 
(v) 
The VF should be drawn from the village or nearby to ensure the sustainability of the 
process.  
(vi)  Financial resources for inputs and infrastructure should not be mobilised until after the 
social mobilisation process is established and the quality has been verified.  
Additional Outcomes and Outputs 
256. 
In  addition  to  the  component  level  Outcomes  listed  above,  the  Community  Mobilization 
activities will have the following additional Outcomes: 
257.  Sub-component 1.1 will have the following outcomes:  
  Groups performing well with active membership pursuing economic, livelihood and financial 
outcomes (target of 80% scoring 3 or higher in a 1-4 scale of performance).  
  Women’s  groups  performing  well  with  active  membership  pursuing  economic,  livelihood 
and financial outcomes (target of 80% scoring 3 or higher in a 1-4 scale of performance). 
258.  Sub-component 1.1 will have the following outputs: 
  The establishment of an organisational structure for social mobilisation. 
 
Identification and mobilisation of the target group around common interests. 
  Target group capacitated to pursue their economic and livelihood interests.  
  Target groups capacitated  to fully  engage  with mainstream development processes  within 
the village, including through the new Village Law 
Main Investment Activities 
259.  Main activities include: 
1.  Establishment of an organisational structure for social mobilisation. 
2. 
Identification and mobilisation of target group around common interests. 
3.  Target group capacitated to pursue their economic and livelihood interests. 
Activity 1. Establishment of an Organisational Structure for Social Mobilisation 
260.  The  key  lesson  of  READ  after  the  mid-term  is  that  specialised  social  mobilisation  services, 
together with technical services and locally selected Village Facilitators are able to provide an 
effective  platform  for  local  development.  Moreover,  the 
integration  of  all  programme 
components and activities depends heavily on effective social mobilisation. The programme will 
therefore establish a cadre of Village Facilitators and appropriate management structures from 
the outset, which will not only serve the activities under Component 1.1, but also all the other 
sub-components  in  Component  1.  The  development  of  social  mobilisation  services  has  the 
following broad elements:  
a)  Recruitment  of  a  Social  Mobilisation  service  provider  as  a  Specialist  Implementing  Partner 
(SIP SM) 
b)  Recruitment of Village Facilitators (VFs) - initially under the SIP SM 
65

Appendix 4:  Detailed programme description 
c)  Programme support for social mobilisation and integration of lessons into AAEHRD 
(a)  Recruitment of a Social Mobilisation service provider 
261.  The AAEHRD  has  experience,  through  READ,  of  social  mobilisation  with  a  solid  performance 
record  and  tangible  outcomes.  READ  brought  in  a  Social  Mobilization  service  provider,  the 
NGO Equator, as a Specialist Implementing Partner (SIP) who worked as an integrated part of 
the READ implementation teams at both District and national level. The READ experience has 
been  that  the  Specialist  Implementing  Partner  for  social  mobilization  is  able  to  ensure 
consistently high levels of social mobilization activities in the programme while at the same time 
building  the  capacity  and  understanding  activities  within  the  District  government  teams,  such 
that  the  local  government  is  able  and  will  to  takeover  these  activities  and  VF  personnel  after 
they are established and working well. This successful model of transitional support from a SIP 
will be continued under READ SI. 
262.  READ  SM  will  contract  an  established  service  provider  to  manage  and  coordinate  the  social 
mobilisation  process.  In  an  evolution  of  the  READ  approach  and  reflecting  the  transitional 
nature  of  the  role,  the  individual  Village  Facilitators  will  initially  be  recruited,  contracted  and 
trained  by  the  SIP  until  MTR  after  which  their  contracts  will  be  transferred  to  the  district 
authorities so promote their transition and future sustainability of their roles.  
263.  The  SM  service  provider  will  be  expected  to  have  proven  experience  of  inclusive  social 
mobilisation  and  the  capacity  to  rapidly  establish  the  organisational  structure  for  Sub-
component  1.1.  The  importance  of  establishing  the  framework  for  social  mobilisation  early  in 
READ SI activities is a key lesson from READ.  
264.  Given  the  strong  performance  of  SM  activities  in  READ  and  the  need  for  rapid  set-up  and 
deployment  of  the  VF  teams,  there  is  a  compelling  case  for  continuity  in  the  SM  core  team 
READ  to  READ  SI.  The  feasibility  of  ensuring  such  continuity  within  current  procurement 
policies will be confirmed during design finalization. 
265.  A single service provider for all  programme Provinces will be procured and centrally managed 
on behalf of the AAEHRD by the Senior Social Mobiliser within the NPMO team. The following 
posts are envisaged, based on the structure that worked well in READ: (approximate numbers 
to be verified during PIM preparation after final district and villages selection confirmed) 
1 x   National Social Mobilisation (SM) Manager - one 
6 x  Provincial Social Mobilisation (SM) Managers - one per province 
19 x  District SM Coordinators - one per district, with one extra in districts with very remote 
sub-districts 
108 x  Sub-district SM Supervisors - one per sub-district and/or 1 per ten villages 
342 x  Village Facilitators - 1 per village 
266.  The READ SI NPMO will include a fulltime SM Consultant, who will supervise the SM service 
provider  and  National  SM  Manager  and  will  be  responsible,  on  behalf  of  the  READ  SI 
Programme  Director,  for  ensuring  overall  performance.  Within  the  districts,  the  staff  of  the 
service providers will work as a fully integrated part of the District Management Unit (DMU) and 
will  also  be  expected  to  build  capacity  of  their  government  counterparts  in  aspects  of 
professional social mobilization. Their day-to-day activity planning will be mainstreamed within 
the overall programme activity plans in the districts and sub-districts. Professional oversight and 
backstopping will be via the SM service providers' teams from sub-district to district to provincial 
to central levels. Their terms of reference are attached in the annex to Appendix 5, but the main 
responsibilities include: 
(i) 
Review  Lessons from READ. One of the first tasks of the service provider  will be to 
gain  a  detailed  understanding  of  the  progress  and  process  of  social  mobilisation  in 
66 
Republic of Indonesia 
Rural Empowerment and Agricultural Development Programme Scaling-up Initiative (READ SI) 
Final programme design report 
Appendix 4:  Detailed programme description 
(ii) 
READ  and  to  incorporate  best  practice  from  this  experience  into  the  procedures  for 
READ SI.  
Capacity building and training on SM. The SM service provider will conduct a training 
needs  assessment  and  develop  and  manage  the  training  to  develop  capacities  for 
social mobilisation throughout programme management at all levels in the programme 
(sub-district, district, provincial, national). The needs assessment will follow a review 
of  the  READ  training  course  and  feedback  from  READ  SM  service  provider  on  how 
these  could  be  improved.  Training  will  be  developed  for  SM  District  Coordinators, 
Sub-district  supervisors,  VFs,  PPLs  as  well  as  other  government  staff  and 
stakeholders  e.g.  Camat,  provincial  teams,  village  heads.  The  SM  Service  Provider 
will  provide  all  the  training  apart  from  the  module  for  PPLs,  which  will  be  integrated 
into their training on extension skills. Appropriate to their role in the programme, there 
will be thorough training on the objectives, methods and implementation modalities of 
READ SI for the programme SM teams as well as other stakeholders. The Sub-district 
supervisors  and  VFs  will  be  given  extensive  training  in  the  following  broad  subject 
areas:  (i)  Participatory  Rural  Appraisal  (PRA)  assessment  methodologies;  (ii)  group 
formation  and  management  methodologies;  (iii)  gender  inclusion;  (iv)  conflict 
resolution and (v) monitoring and evaluation.  
(iii)  Monthly  meeting  schedules.  There  will  be  one  monthly  meeting  at  the  district  level 
and one at the sub-district to oversee the social mobilisation and planning work. The 
district level meetings will be chaired by the  DPMO and will be the key management 
review  process  for  the  delivery  of  social  mobilisation  services.  The  Provincial  SM 
Manager, staff from the  DPMO and DPIUs will attend the monthly meetings, as well 
as other government staff on an "as needs" basis. The purpose of these meetings will 
be  to:  monitor  the  progress  of  the  VFs  and  Penyuluh  Pertanian  Lapangan  (PPLs); 
review the quality and efficiency of social mobilisation outcomes, and; address issues 
that cannot be addressed at the village level and require higher level support.  
(iv)  Knowledge  products  and  IT  innovation  for  social  mobilisation.  The  programme 
Implementation Manual (PIM) has been a useful document for READ, which has been 
actively used, and frequently revised, to guide  programme implementation.  A lesson 
from  READ  was  that  it  was  often  too  long  and  complex  to  support  VFs  and  provide 
the group members themselves with an understanding of the programme. The service 
provider  will  provide  simple  (suitable  for  semi-literate)  and  short  (one-two  page) 
information material to be  used by the  VFs and  PPLs on, for example, the following 
subjects:  (i)  the  READ  SI  objectives,  opportunities  and  expectations  of  participants; 
(ii) the PRA process for target group selection; (iii) principles of inclusion and gender; 
(iv)  guidelines  to  support  group  selection;  (v)  principles  of  good  group  governance 
and (vi) proposal writing for infrastructure investments.  
In  addition,  the  SM  service  provider  will  use  IT  innovations,  in  particular  video,  to 
support  effective  and  inclusive  social  mobilisation.  Social  mobilisation  in  READ  SI 
seeks  to  be  short,  output  driven  and  mindful  of  the  time  constraints  of  the  target 
group.  Short  videos,  for  example,  of  PRA  exercises,  or  graphic  illustrations  of  good 
governance, will enable the messages to be communicated more effectively.  
To  support  the  understanding  of  VFs,  PPL  and  other  programme  teams,  the  NPMO 
will  prepare  a  READ  SI  "Pocket  Book"  -  a  simplified  and  condensed  version  of  the 
PIM  focus  on  the  key  facts  and  ideas  that  everyone  needs  to  know.  AS  the  name 
suggests, this should be a small format book that can be fit easily into a packet so it 
can be carried at all times in the field and referred to when answering questions from 
farmers  and  others  about  READ  SI.  An  electronic  version  of  the  READ  SI  Pocket 
Book  should  also  be  produced,  and  designed  to  be  read  and  searchable  on  small 
tablets and smartphones. 
67

Rural Empowerment and Agricultural Development Programme Scaling-up Initiative (READ SI) 
Final programme design report 
Appendix 4:  Detailed programme description 
(v)  Monitoring  and  Evaluation  (M&E).  The  SM  service  provider  will  support  the  M&E  as 
well as the learning agenda of the programme as it supports and drives an agenda to 
scale  up  the  READ  SI  approach.  Details  are  provided  in  Appendix  2  on  targeting 
methodology. In support of this, all VFs and SM team will be provided with tablets (or 
similar)  in  order  that  they  can  directly  record  monitoring  data  electronically  into 
purpose  design  forms  that  can  reduce  the  time  burden  while  improving  accuracy, 
reliability  and  usability  of  data  being  collected  in  support  of  evidence-based 
management for results. 
(b)  Identification and recruitment of village facilitation services  
267.  The  experience  of  READ  demonstrates  that  it  is  possible  to  recruit  and  train  VFs  to  provide 
social mobilisation to a high standard in a relatively short time. Further, it is broadly agreed that 
it is more effective as well as sustainable, to have VFs recruited from the local community. The 
fact that there are many VFs who are still operating in the READ villages and that these have 
been  recruited  by  local  government  after  READ  finished  to  provide  ongoing  support,  is 
indicative of the feasibility and success of the approach.  
268.  The  SM  service  provider  will  support  the  DPMU  to  recruit  the  VFs  after  READ  SI  has  been 
socialised in the village. Given the time-frame of training and planning requirements, it will not 
be possible to recruit the VF from amongst the group identified as programme participants, but 
the SM Supervisors at the sub-district level should ensure adequate follow-up to ensure that the 
nominees are suitable. The VFs will typically be in their 20's-30's, have successfully completed 
high school  level education, be energetic and enthusiastic  and have a  good  understanding of 
the local community. Women are expected to form a majority of VFs; in READ there has been 
no  barrier  to  recruiting  female  VFs  and  their  performance  has  been  favourably  reviewed.  It  is 
expected that about one VF per village will be recruited.  
269.  There will be an intensive programme of initial VF orientation and training followed by on-the-
job coaching managed by the SM service provider.  READ SI will employ high performing VFs 
from  READ  to  provide  guidance,  even  outside  their  own  District,  and  adapt  the  training  to 
address  on-the-job  experience  of  capacity  requirements  for  social  mobilisation.  Skills  and 
knowledge  of  VF's  should  be  kept  up-to-date  by  periodic  refresher  training  and  activities.  A 
mentoring system should be introduced with stronger VFs paired with new and weaker VFs to 
strengthen performance, as is currently employed by the CCDP and was also practiced in some 
of the best READ districts.  
270.  The  SM  service  provider  will  provide  ongoing  supervision  and  backstopping  of  the  VFs,  with 
appropriate  management  and  supervision  structures  in  place.  The  READ  experience 
demonstrates  the  need  to  have  VF  supervision  start  from  the  sub-district  level  upwards.  VFs 
performance  should  be  regularly  monitored  and  reviewed,  with  mechanisms  introduced  to 
recognize and incentivize strong performance and also to correct or sanction poor performance. 
Programme participants  in  the  village should review  VF performance after six months. Where 
VF  performance  is  consistently  considered  poor  from  triangulated  sources,  the  VF  should  be 
replaced.  Provision should be made for some turnover amongst VFs, often at around 10% per 
year,  with  clear  processes  in  place  to  recruit  and  get  new  VFs  up  to  speed  quickly.  The 
experience of READ is that the mobilisation process can recover and improve rapidly if such a 
change is needed.  
271.  Social media and messaging  apps, such as Facebook and  WhatsApp,  will be used to enable 
rapid  communication,  routine  M&E  and  information  sharing  among  peers  and  managers. The 
experience  of  the  Coastal  Community  Development  Project  (CCDP)  and  READ  will  be  useful 
for developing social media modalities to support on-the-job learning and VFs will be provided 
with smartphones, tablet and phone/data allowances to enable them to access and benefit from 
such  social  media.  In  exchange,  they  will  be  required  to  regularly  report  and  update  their 
activities via such social media tools.

Final programme design report 
Appendix 4:  Detailed programme description 
272. 
Incentives  for  good  performance.  The  VFs  should  be  provided  with  small  but  significant 
incentives  to  perform  well,  such  as  travel  to  programme  planning  forum,  opportunities  for 
professional  development  and  formal  recognition  by  important  persona  for  their  work.  Status-
based non-financial benefits are often as powerful as financial rewards. 
(c)  Programme support for social mobilisation and integration of lessons into AAEHRD 
273.  READ  has  demonstrated  that  demand-driven  services  generate  returns  in  higher  agricultural 
productivity and therefore justify the economic investment in improved extension services. The 
AAEHRD  however  requires  further  exposure  and  capacity  building  in  the  modalities  of  social 
mobilisation  and  the  institutional  means  through  which  lessons  can  be  assimilated  and 
operationalized. The design provides for this objective through two broad elements:  
i.  Supervision of programme social mobilisation activities and integration of best practice into 
AAEHRD.  
ii.  Mainstreaming of training of social mobilisation skills for PPLs. 
274. 
i)  Supervision  of  social  mobilisation  and  integration  of  best  practice  into AAEHRD.  Whilst  the 
AAEHRD is the agency with overall responsibility for extension delivery, the Directorate General 
for Regional Development (Bangda) of the Ministry of Home Affairs has overall responsibility for 
ensuring effective decentralization of government services. In the extension delivery context, at 
District  level  this  means  working  closely  with  Dinas  Pertanian  to  ensure  quality  extension 
services result in high rates of adoption by target farmers. This is a key management point and 
it  is  proposed  to  focus  on  achievement  of  improved  extension  outcomes,  such  as  those  that 
match technology transfer to smallholder needs, at sub-district levels. 
275.  The  AAEHRD  will  work  in  close  coordination  with  the  SM  service  provider  to  manage 
programme  objectives  and  institutionalise  lessons  in  social  mobilisation  that  are  relevant  for 
sustainable  demand-driven  agricultural  extension.  The  Social  Mobilisation  consultant, 
appointed as part of the NPMO core team, will have overall responsibility for managing the SM 
service  provider  and  ensuring  that  lessons  generated  from  the  programme  on  social 
mobilisation  are  incorporated  into  demand-driven  extension  services  promoted  by  AAEHRD 
more  widely  in  MOA.  The  SM  consultant  will  work  closely  with  the  SM  service  provider  to 
ensure effective implementation of sub-component 1.1.  
276.  The  monthly  meetings  at  Sub-district  and  District  level  will  be  the  main  management  review 
mechanism, enabling a consolidation of strategies and the adaptation of services to the  READ 
SI target groups. This will also be the point at which programme activities are coordinated with 
those being developed  by  Dinas Pertanian to ensure  improvements in extension are linked to 
wider initiatives to improve government services in the decentralised context.  
277.  The main tasks of the SM consultant within the NPMO are to:  
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
supervise the performance of the SM service provider 
ensure that PPLs participating in programme villages have received training and are 
capacitated to undertake social mobilisation to a reasonable standard;  
incorporate lessons on social mobilisation modalities that can be mainstreamed into 
routine extension practice and support the adoption of these into PPL training and 
other extension training and capacity buildings activities of AAEHRD;  
understand PRA outcomes in terms of the priorities and constraints identified by 
different poverty and commodity resource groups and how these can inform technical 
response packages; and 
(v) 
identify methodological and organisational pathways for the replication of the READ 
SI approach within the AAEHRD.

Appendix 4:  Detailed programme description 
278.  Training  of  PPLs  in  social  mobilisation.  Whilst  the  main  mandate  of  PPL  will  be  delivering 
technical  extension  they  will  employ  the  READ  methodology  of  demand  driven  needs 
assessment  and  inclusive  social  mobilisation.  They  will  work  closely  with  the  VF  to  mobilise 
groups,  back-stop  the  VF  and  relay  extension  demands  and  priorities  up  the  management 
structure so that they can be assimilated into the review and updating of the technical packages 
used by the PPL. Accordingly, in additional to their technical and extension training, activities to 
capacitate PPLs on social mobilization skills include:  
(i) 
(ii) 
Training of existing and new extension staff in social mobilisation methodologies; 
details outlined in Appendix 2. The training will be to ensure that they are equipped 
with skills to a sufficient standard to deliver the planned support package as well as 
replicate this approach in future extension delivery.  
Provide reporting on group mobilisation that links extension demands to the 
constraints and capacities of the final user and therefore allows technical packages to 
be updated and made more appropriate to farmer absorptive capacity.  
279.  Training  in  social  mobilisation  will  use  the  same  modules  prepared  for  the  VFs  by  the  SM 
service provider, however training provision will be delivered as part of the general package of 
skills training and refresher training for PPLs (see Sub-component 2.1, para  427).  
Activity 2 - Social Mobilisation and Group Mobilisation Processes 
280.  The success of READ post-MTR has been widely attributed to good quality social mobilisation 
services  combined  with  relevant  technical  support  packages.  READ  SI  will  use  the 
organisational  structure  and  resources  outlined  above  to  enable  an  improved  group 
mobilisation process that draws on best practice and lessons from READ.  SM was introduced 
into READ for the first time only after the MTR, so key improvements will include:  
  The  programme  will  coordinate  with  Dinas  Pertanian  and  BAPPEDA  in  the  selection  of 
villages,  as  well  as  in  monthly  district  meetings,  to  ensure  that  group  mobilisation  and 
planning  benefits  from  and  are  integrated  in  interventions  planned  as  part  of  broader 
decentralisation processes.  
  The  investment  activities  in  equipment  and  infrastructure  from  READ  SI  will  be  provided 
only  after  demonstrable  inclusive  group  governance  of  SCG  and  technical  training, 
expected to be around Year 2 or 3 of engagement in the village  
 
Inclusion  and  targeting  will  be  done  through  participatory  criteria  cross-checked  against 
secondary  data  and  village  lists  of  poor  people.  READ  SI  will  not  use  the  typology  of  7 
poverty types used in READ.  
  Support  with  knowledge  products  and  IT  innovations  to  enable  effective  use  of  people’s 
time and output oriented facilitation. 
281.  Socialisation  of  the  Programme  to  the  village.  The  DPMO  will  invite  the  Kepala  Desa  and 
Camat  (head  of  village  and  sub-district,  respectively)  of  the  chosen  villages  to  the  District  to 
explain  the  objectives  and  functions  of  READ  SI.  They  will  be  provided  with  brief  and  clear 
information material to distribute in the village which  emphasises the centrality of the inclusion 
agenda.  Village  socialisation  will  be  facilitated  by  the  DPMO  and  will  include  the  Camat,  the 
Kepala Desa, the PPL and representatives from each Rumah Tangga; a recommended number 
of 100-150 participants, depending on village size. During this meeting, an estimated 3 hours, 
the purpose of the READ SI will be explained and the next steps will be outlined. The attendees 
will  already  be  asked  to  consider  candidates  for  Village  Facilitators.  The  objective  of  the 
socialisation process is to ensure that all potential participants are alerted to the purpose of the 
programme  and  to  the  inclusion  agenda,  as  well  as  opportunities  and  responsibilities  if  they 
choose to participate.

282.  PRA  for  selection  of  programme  participants.  The  PRA  will  be  facilitated  by  the  VF  and  PPL 
with advisory back-stopping where possible from the sub-district SM supervisor and district SM 
Coordinator. The leaders of all the Rumah Tangga will be asked to participate and to mobilise 
poor households from their area. Secondary data will be used to ensure broad participation of 
poor  households  and  will  also  be  used  to  cross-check  households  selected  for  participation. 
The  selection  of  households  will  however  be  based  on  participatory  criteria.  The  household 
selection will not use the 1-7 typologies of household characteristics as used in READ as this 
was found to be too complex and also not adapted to the specifics of poverty in each village. 
The participatory identification of poor households will enable the process to be used to identify 
production constraints particular to the poor in each village and therefore allow initial analysis of 
relevant agricultural and livelihoods interventions.  
283.  Following  this  process,  the  VF  and  PPLs  will  consult  with  the  sub-district  SM  mobilisers  on 
suitable interventions and agricultural and livelihood groups for each village to estimate broad 
numbers and group types for each village, to be discussed further with the participants.  
284.  PRA  for  mobilisation  of  groups.  This  PRA  will  be  facilitated  by  the  VF  and  PPL  with  advisory 
back-stopping  where  possible  from  the  SM  service  provider  team.  The  selected  programme 
participants  will  be  informed  of  the  potential  agricultural  interventions  and  livelihoods 
interventions for the village. The programme will continue a "one household member per group" 
principle and the principles of balanced gender inclusion in both women's and mixed groups.  
285.  The  VF  and  PPL  will  outline:  (i)  the  objectives  of  group  formation;  (ii)  the  purpose  and 
objectives of the SCGs; (iii) the technical packages and support available for each commodity 
and the expected returns; (iv) suitable criteria, in terms of minimum assets of land,  labour and 
ownership needed to benefit from these and (v) the expectations of participants in each group 
in  terms  of  their  time  and  commitment.  These  points  will  be  supported  by  simple  information 
leaflets that provide a short and graphic description that will support decision-making.  
286.  Following this introduction, the participants will decide on which group is most suitable to their 
needs and capacities. Participants should be given sufficient time to go away and reflect on the 
options and discuss them with their family and friend before making their final decision. Hence, 
a second meeting is likely to be necessary to confirm group membership. The group heads and 
other positions will be selected on the same day.  
Activity 3. Group Planning, Technical Training and Investment Activities 
287.  Group  activities  are  directed  at  four  principal  outputs:  (i)  building  group  governance  capacity 
around self-help  SCG; (ii) technical training and resource inputs for agricultural  and  livelihood 
investments  and;  (iii)  planning  for  infrastructure  and  service  investments  in  support  of 
agricultural and livelihood activities; (iv) confidence and ability of group members to collectively 
and individually engage in the wider village development processes, including those under the 
new Village Law.  
288.  A review of the approach to investment and planning in READ has the following lessons:  
  The  infrastructure  activities  were  started  before  social  mobilisation  work  was  complete, 
resulting in frequent diversion of infrastructure investments that were not well thought out or 
did not serve the project target groups (elite capture).  
  The project village committee, the Village Fund Management Unit (UPDD), was established 
before  the  social  mobilisation  work  was  complete  and  therefore  did  not  represent  target 
group interests. Instead of forming a UPDD or similar representative structure, the READ SI 
participants will link to the Kepala Desa and Camat through the VF, PPL and a committee of 
the heads of all groups.   
  Technical  inputs  for  agriculture  were  given  as  a  revolving  fund  with  mixed  results;  whilst 
some  groups  have  managed  to  revolve  the  funds,  others  have  considered  it  a  free  input. 
71

Rural Empowerment and Agricultural Development Programme Scaling-up Initiative (READ SI) 
Final programme design report 
Appendix 4:  Detailed programme description 
Following this lesson, as well as general best practice, READ SI will support SCG activities 
around  savings  generated  from  within  the  group,  whilst  providing  the  small  package  of 
technical start-up inputs separately for free once participants have completed the relevant 
agricultural or non-farm training.  
  READ  SI  will  not  seek  to  establish  cooperatives  or  prescribed  institutionalisation  of  the 
supported  groups  as  a  development  objective.  The  READ  experience  suggests  that, 
despite  intensive  group  work,  most  households  take  investment  decisions  separately  and 
are  able  to  act  collectively  if  this  suits  their  interests.  Nevertheless,  READ  SI  will  pursue 
opportunities to support collective action, aggregation and institutionalisation, especially in 
old  READ  villages,  where  appropriate  to  programme  development  objectives.  This  is 
expected to be particular the case for investments in productive equipment and machinery 
eligible for partial financial support from the programme. 
289.  Group capacity development and Savings and Credit Group (SCG) activities. small-scale self-
help SCG activities are intended to form  an important element of the ongoing social capital in 
the group and the development of group meeting discipline will be anchored around this activity. 
For the avoidance of doubt, these self-help SCG activities are primarily a social capital activity 
and for promoting good household financial discipline. They are not intended to provide a main 
source of finance for productive household investments in farming or non-farm activities. 
290. 
291. 
In the initial six months of group work, sustained support will be provided by the VF and PPL to 
develop the administrative capacity of the group in meeting protocol, simple book-keeping and 
savings  disciplines.  The  financial  literacy  and  SCG  support  is  outlined  separately  below. 
Similarly,  programme  interventions  in  support  for  improved  nutrition  will  start  during  this  early 
phase  in  group  development  and  both  are  intended  to  bolster  the  capacity  of  the  group  to 
mobilise around supporting fundamental human and social capital.  
Infrastructure  Planning.  The  programme  provides  for  infrastructure  inputs  to  serve  the 
agricultural and livelihood investment activities. These will be made available in the second and 
third  year of programme activities in the village and subject to satisfactory performance of the 
village in the  activities to that  point.  The  VF and  PPLs will support group members to  identify 
appropriate  investments  and  develop  proposals  that  explain  the  costs  and  benefits  of  these 
choices.  The  proposals  will  be  discussed  in  a  forum  of  all  group  participants  and  preferred 
investments will be decided by a vote. The VF, PPL and sub-district SM supervisors will provide 
technical  guidance  and  the  proposed  investments  will  be  presented  and  approved  at  the 
monthly  planning  meeting  of  the  DPMO.  The  SM  Coordinator  will  be  responsible  for 
coordinating the infrastructure plans with BAPPEDA and other responsible agencies and linking 
the village groups to broader investment activities at the village level.  
292.  This sequence  has the following objectives: it allows  for capacity  building  within the  group for 
planning;  it  enables  the  groups  to  consolidate  their  choices  without  interference  and  it  allows 
planned investments to be integrated into wider development planning.  
293.  Village level knowledge sharing (KS) forums. The VF will organize a village and/or sub-district 
to  encourage  discussion  and  knowledge  sharing  amongst  programme 
wide  meeting 
participants.  KS  forums  will  be  an  opportunity  to  detail  lessons  learned,  on-going  issues, 
forward  planning,  agricultural  and  livelihood  outcomes,  financial  literacy  and  bank  linkages. 
Based on outcomes of KS forums, well performing groups can be visited by groups from other 
villages to learn directly from their experience. 
294.  Linking  to  private  services  provider  and  markets.  Where  opportunities  arise,  VFs  will  also 
support groups to identify,  engage and negotiate with private enterprises and organisations to 
source inputs and services or market their produce.

Final programme design report 
Appendix 4:  Detailed programme description 
297.  Extension  support  will  be  delivered  at  2  levels:  (i)  Intensive  extension  to  target  farmers;  (ii) 
Public  Private  Partnerships  to  support  GOI  farmer  extension,  especially  for  cocoa  (see  Sub-
comp 2.4). 
Activity 1: Intensive Extension to Target Farmers (all crops & homestead gardening)  
298.  An  intensive  approach  to  target  farmers  will  include  using  BP3K  (sub-district  extension  units) 
and volunteer lead farmers (village) with support from village facilitators. The approach will be 
to encourage Village Heads to monitor the work of the village “extension team” - comprising 3 
key members: (i) sub-district extension officer (PPL of the BP3K); (ii) village facilitator; and (iii) 
volunteer lead farmer. The PPL will lead the extension team. It is proposed the extension team 
will  meet  on  a  monthly  basis  with  the  village  head  to  discuss  progress,  issues  and  plans  for 
coming month. 
299. 
In the extension delivery context, at District level this means working closely with  SEKDA and 
BAPPEDA  to  ensure  quality  extension  services  result  in  high  rates  of  adoption  by  target 
farmers. It is proposed to focus on achievement of improved extension outcomes at sub-district 
levels.  In  this  sub-component,  the  major  aspect  of  delivery  will  be  the  provision  of  extension 
services that focus on farmer adoption of new technologies (not on technology transfer). 
(i) 
Farmer group mobilization 
300.  Preparation of farmer  groups as the delivery mechanism for farmer field schools (FFS), along 
with  other  facilitation  in  the  programme  will  be  undertaken  by  the  Village  Facilitators  with 
support from the SM teams of the SM service provider as described under Sub-component 1.1. 
(ii) 
Farmer field schools (FFS) 
301.  Production  training  (agronomic  issues)  and  post-harvest  training  will  be  delivered  via  Farmer 
Field  Schools  (FFS).  These  will  be  the  main  vehicle  to  deliver  technology  support  to  group 
members  and  FFS  will  include  provision  of  extension  materials  funded  by  READ.  Any  initial 
engagement  with  farmers  will  begin  with  an  assessment  of  farmers’  perceptions  of  problems, 
constraints, etc. These concerns would then be built into the FFS “curriculum”.  
302.  The FFS will be delivered to clusters of about 25 farmers at convenient locations in the village. 
There will be FFS specifically targeted at the key crops identified as priorities. Each FFS will be 
delivered in a number of half day “classes” at important crop stages, covering the full production 
cycle  from  seed  bed  preparation  to  post  harvest,  covering  technical,  financial,  water 
management aspects and post harvest aspects.  
303.  FFS will be delivered by the extension officer (PPL) in the first instance, and ultimately by lead 
farmers  under  PPL  guidance.  Each  FFS  will  be  repeated  2  times  with  each  farmer  cluster  – 
typically  one FFS  each  in the  wet  and one  in the dry  seasons  - but  with decreasing  intensity, 
and/or moving to fresh technical messages according to farmers’ needs and requests.  FFS will 
also be a focal point for target farmers to engage with other aspects of the programme e.g. farm 
machinery demonstrations, improved seed variety trials/demonstrations, discussions with bank 
personnel etc.  
304. 
In the case of cocoa farmer training  in  districts covered by the PPP  with  MARS,  Mondelez  or 
others the cocoa farmer training will be organized and delivered in accordance with the system 
agreed in the particular PPP. 
305.  Participation in technical training. The types and purpose of this training is outlined in detail in 
appendix 2. The technical training is intended to enable the individual  programme participants 
to  take  advantage  of  programme  investment  opportunities  related  to  agricultural  or  livelihood 
objectives  at  the  household  level.  They  are  not  intended  to  force  farmers  to  plan  production 
together, aggregate for marketing or in any way formalise their group status. Technical training 
inputs will be commodity based and may include one or two groups depending on numbers. If 
there  are  training  sessions  where  numbers  are  not  filled,  participants  from  other  commodity 
76 
Republic of Indonesia 
Rural Empowerment and Agricultural Development Programme Scaling-up Initiative (READ SI) 
Final programme design report 
Appendix 4:  Detailed programme description 
groups  or  non-READ  participants  can  join.  Adequate  attention  will  be  paid  to  ensuring  that 
gender equality is maintained and that the training is accessible to women.  
(iii)  Quality assurance, follow-up and impact surveys. 
306.  A  key  difference  from  current  extension  delivery  will  be  significant  efforts  to  measure  PPL 
performance  based  on  both  farmer  satisfaction  and  ultimately,  farmer  technology  adoption 
rates. This will be achieved by various means including:  
(i) 
(ii) 
client  satisfaction  phone  surveys  undertaken  by  an  independent  agency  that  will 
measure  farmer  feedback  on  training  content,  relevance,  usability,  convenience, 
quality of delivery, farmer responsiveness, opportunities for improvement, etc.   
technology  adoption  tracking  at  household  level  as  part  of  routine  follow-up  by  VFs 
and  PPL  with  all  farmers  participating  in  extension  training.  This  will  be  done  via 
keeping  of  farm  record  books  on  the  crops  covered  by  training,  with  the  keeping  of 
records  covered  under  both  the  extension  training  and  the  financial  literacy  training. 
Routine  farmer  follow-up  will  be    a  mainstream  part  of  the  extension  approach  to 
support farmers to adopt the technologies promoted, and the farm records books will 
form part of this follow-up and self learning process. Data on production practices, as 
well  as  costs,  inputs,  yields  and  incomes  will  be  recorded  in  farm  record  books that 
VFs  support  all  farmers  to  keep.  Data  from  these  records  books  will  be  periodically 
extracted  by  VFs  to  monitor  the  effectiveness  of  different  activities  and  individual 
trainings. 
(iii) 
spot visits by District, and to a lesser extent Provincial, extension and agriculture staff 
to monitor and measure PPL performance;   
307.  Once this process is underway, there will be the opportunity to introduce benchmarking of PPLs 
and to identify best performing farmers.  
(iv)  Village level farmer to farmer knowledge sharing (KS) forums 
308.  At the completion of each crop cycle, the village facilitator will organize a village wide meeting 
to encourage discussion and knowledge sharing amongst farmers from all FFS. KS forums will 
be  an  opportunity  to  detail  lessons  learned,  on-going  issues,  forward  planning,  crop  financial 
outcomes (including non-rice crops), PPL performance, etc. The minutes of each forum will be 
recorded  by  the  facilitator  and  distributed  to  each  PPL  for  similar  KS  opportunities  and  follow 
up.   
309.  District and sub-district coordinators and supervisors for social mobilization  and extension  will 
attend the farmer forums to listen to feedback and answer questions. 
(v)  Cross village visits and knowledge sharing (KS) 
310.  Based on outcomes of KS forums, well performing farmers and groups can be visited by groups 
from  other  villages.  READ  SI  will  also  pilot  using  social  media  among  farmers  to  share 
knowledge  directly  among  farmer  groups  and  individuals,  for  example  by  creating  and 
promoting "WhatsApp" groups of local cocoa farmers. 
(vi)  Monthly extension review meetings 
311.  These meetings will be the key management review process for delivery of improved extension 
at  District  level.  They  will  be  chaired  by  SEKDA  and  attended  by  District  staff  from:  (i) 
Agriculture; (ii) Extension; (iii) Public Works; and in addition (iv) village heads, (v) WUA and (vi) 
READ SI social mobilization and rural finance teams and others stakeholders will be invited to 
attend  on  an  as  needs  basis.  The  purpose  of  such  meetings  will  be  to  monitor  PPL 
performance, the quality and efficiency of extension outcomes (use of dashboard), input supply 
issues, and water supply issues. The meetings will routinely use data on farmer satisfaction and 
77 
Republic of Indonesia 
Rural Empowerment and Agricultural Development Programme Scaling-up Initiative (READ SI) 
Final programme design report 
Appendix 4:  Detailed programme description 
technology adoption to have evidence-based review, discussion and decision to build a process 
of continuous improvement in service delivery. 
(vii)  PPL staff mentoring by good PPL performers 
312.  With good extension staff management, identification of few but relevant monitoring indicators, 
and sensible use of PPL performance measurement data, district extension staff will readily be 
able  to  identify  their  best  performing  extension  staff.  It  is  proposed  to  use  these  good 
performers to mentor, and thereby improve the performance of the poorer performing staff.  
(viii)  Annual prizes to best performing extension staff  
313. 
It is also proposed to reward these good performers (both extension officers) (male or female) 
with  small  but  meaningful  recognition.  This  could  be  travel  to  another  programme,  additional 
access to training opportunities, formal recognition by the District Mayor (Bupati), etc.  
(ix)  Annual prizes to best performing farmers 
314. 
315. 
It  is  also  proposed  to  reward  these  good  performing  farmers  (male  or  female)  with  small  but 
meaningful  recognition.  Top  performing  farmers  (including  diversified  farmers)  could  be 
recognized  with  exposure  visits,  simple  cash  prizes,  or  fuel  vouchers,  and  especially  status-
based rewards such as recognition by the District Mayor (Bupati).  
Implementation:    Extension  delivery  will  be  monitored  by  AAEHRD  and  managed  by  District 
Dinas  Pertanian. Actual  extension  programme  delivery  will  be  undertaken  by  sub-district  BPP 
staff (PPLs) with support from village level lead farmer volunteers and from village facilitators. It 
is  proposed  the  intensive,  targeted  extension  activities  will  be  delivered  by  the  “village 
extension team” comprised of the PPL, the village facilitator and the lead, volunteer farmer. This 
team will be monitored by the village head on a monthly basis to discuss progress, issues and 
plans for coming month. 
316.  FFS will be organized and run by the PPL in close coordination with the respective group  VF. 
Depending on location, a village may typically have a total of 5 FFS in each year - for example 
in  Sulawesi  this  might  be  2  rice  production  FFSs  (incl.  post-harvest),  one  copra  post-harvest 
FFS,  2  integrated  homestead  gardening  FFS. The mix  of  crops  to  be  covered  in  each  village 
will be adjusted according to the most relevant food and estate crops in the village as decided 
by the READ SI households themselves. However, within any district FFS will only be offered to 
cover a maximum of 5 different key crops plus livestock (in NTT) and homestead gardening in 
order to ensure quality of the FFS delivered while balancing this with the need to respond to the 
priorities of farmers. The budget for each FFS will be paid to the village administration account 
who  will  release  the  funds  to  each  group  treasurer  as  required.  This  process  will  be  jointly 
signed off by the PPL and the overall group manager. 
317.  Participating farmers will be asked to collectively choose where and when the training sessions 
will be conducted to maximize participation. FFS will typically involve farmers meeting in either 
a set location (e.g. farmer field) or rotating around a series of different farmers’ fields according 
to need. The FFS will meet according to a planned schedule in relation to the production cycle 
that ensures key points in the production or post-harvest process are met. For example, a rice 
production oriented FFS might meet at the following stages: (i) seedling nursery establishment; 
(ii) seed bed preparation; (iii) transplanting; (iv) vegetative growth stage; (v) flowering; (vi) seed 
set stage; and (vii) pre-harvest stage. The PPL will decide on actual details based on local crop 
requirements. The PPL will be required to review the FFS process with his/her FFS group after 
each FSS with a view to improving performance in the next training cycle.  
318.  Each  FFS  will  have  clearly  stated  expected  outcomes  both  for  the  group  and  for  individual 
members in each group (e.g. yield increases, food security, profitability) whose achievement will 
be  the  responsibility  of  the  PPL.  FFS  implementation  performance,  (including  performance  of 
individual  members)  as  well  as  the  performance  of  the  PPL  will  be  reviewed  by  group 
leadership.  Poor  group  performance  will  be  discussed  and  reported  to  DPMO  management 
78

Final programme design report 
Appendix 4:  Detailed programme description 
who  may  withhold  READ  group  incentives  until  performance  is  improved  (e.g.  machinery  and 
infrastructure grants). 
319.  Each production group will also be funded with training workshops that cover: (i) business and 
financial  analysis;  (ii)  marketing;  and  (iii)  M&E.  In  order  to  promote  the  ideas  and  practice  of 
"farming as a business", business and financial literacy will essentially cover: (i) preparation of 
crop  gross  margins  (allowing  farmers  to  understand  comparison  of  different  yield  and  input 
parameters); (ii) building an understanding of the importance of managing seasonal finances – 
building a working capital fund to ensure inputs can be purchased without reliance on borrowed 
funds;  and  (iii)  the  costing  of  equipment  maintenance  and  depreciation  funding.  Farm  record 
keeping will also be strongly encouraged, with VF follow-up, to enable farmers to increasingly 
learn  from  themselves  and  compare  performance  between  each  other  to  identify  the  most 
effective  practices.    Marketing  training  will  ensure  farmers  understand  the  impact  of  product 
quality (post- harvest processing, grading, packaging etc.) and the potential financial benefits of 
group  market  negotiations.  PPLs,  with  support  of  VF,  will  run  these  workshops  under 
supervision of the DPMO agriculture staff members and the District RF Coordinators and they 
will be provided with course materials developed by AAEHRD ATC staff under the umbrella of 
"farming as a business". 
(x)  Cocoa farmer extension delivered in partnership with lead firms (in Sulawesi) 
320.  Where cocoa farmers request technical training and support, this will be delivered through one 
of three modalities depending on which of the PPPs, if any, are operating in that District.  
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
in MARS targeted locations, where Cocoa Development Centres (CDC) and Cocoa 
Doctors (CD) / Cocoa Village Centres (CVC) are operating or being established then 
farmer training will be delivered directly by the Cocoa Doctors with backstopping by 
the CDC. In addition, the input starter package would be purchased from the 
CDs/CDCs. 
in Mondelez targeted locations, where Mondelez's commercial suppliers are 
operating, it is expected that farmer training and follow-up would be delivered directly 
by cocoa agronomist of the commercial suppliers as an embedded service. 
in all other locations not directly targeted by a PPP, farmer cocoa training and FFS 
will be delivered by PPLs many of whom will have received advanced cocoa 
production and business training at the MARS Cocoa Academy. Input start packages 
will be sourced from local private nurseries and input suppliers in order not to 
undermine the local service market. Given the time that will be needed to train large 
numbers of PPLs at the Cocoa Academy, cocoa FFS for different groups will need to 
be delivered in stages over the first 3-4 years of the programme. 
321.  Further  details  of  the  expected  PPP  with  MARS  and  Mondelez  are  described  in  more  detail 
under Sub-component 2.4 and subject to further negotiation.   
(xi) 
Livestock farmer extension (NTT only before MTR) 
322.  Livestock  training  will  be  delivered  in  farmer  field  schools,  covering  the  basics  of  animal 
nutrition,  housing,  health  and  reproduction. Annual  flock  management  plans  will  be  prepared 
including disease prevention, fodder production, feeding regimes and planning and monitoring 
including  vaccination  and  parasite  treatment,  livestock  inventory,  mating  and  live  weights,  In 
addition, besides face to face training READ will document the training and provide goat group 
members with copies of training material for their future reference. 
Activity 2: Crop and Livestock Starter Inputs Package 
323.  A  specific  crop  input  package  will  be  available  to  each  member  of  each  rice,  cocoa  and 
fruit/vegetable  group  and  other  key  crops  covered  by  FFS.  The  start-up  packages  will  be 
provided as grants on the condition that they are used to adopt the promoted techniques and 
79

Appendix 4:  Detailed programme description 
packages  on  the  households  farm.  Compliance  will  be  ensured  by  the  grants  being  provided 
using mutual guarantee mechanisms in small groups of 4-6 farmers from within the farmer field 
schools (FFS) to ensure adoption of trained techniques and practices as agreed. 
324.  Unlike READ,  these input  packages will not operate  as a revolving fund  within  the  group,  but 
will be provided as a one-off input to each household, with the intent being that the net value of 
the  inputs  is  re-used  from  season  to  season  within  the  household  for  improved,  and  thereby 
more profitable, production. 
325.  Maximum value of start-up grants will vary depending on the crop/livelihood but are expected to 
be  in  the  range  of  USD250-350  per  household  and  will  comply  with  prevailing  government 
regulations on grants. In exceptional cases some start-up packages will be provided in-kind, for 
example goats. 
326.  To compliment the one-off crop starter input package, group members will be supported to link 
to  mainstream  banks  and  local  MFIs  to  access  additional  credit  to  further  invest  in  improved 
farm production (see sub-comp 2.2). This dual approach of an initial starter package plus bank 
linkages is intended to ensure each group member has access to sufficient  finance to ensure 
they  can  purchase  the  required  crop  inputs  for  all  their  production  land  by  the  end  of  the 
programme  to  ensure  optimal  returns.  For  example,  irrespective  of  their  total  land  area,  each 
rice production group member will have access to Rp3.0 million24 (USD230) which will ensure 
they  can  purchase  improved  variety  seeds,  fertilizers  and  other  key  inputs  in  sufficient 
quantities to be able to implement the improved practices trained on at least 0.5 ha.. Similarly, 
vegetable  and  integrated  homestead  gardening  groups  will  use  their  fund  (Rp1,000,000  / 
USD77) to fund seeds, fertilizer and other equipment such as hand tools).   
327.  To  ensure  READ  SI  rice  production  groups  have  access  to  high  yielding  varieties  of  seed, 
READ  SI  will  contract  the  Indonesian  Rice  Research  Centre  (IRRC)  to  provide  sufficient 
breeders seed (F-1) and provincial BPTPs on an annual basis for 5 years (2018-22) to multiply 
the  F-1  seed  to  sufficient  extension  (F-4)  seed  to  plant  50ha  per  village  for  a  minimum  of  25 
villages or 1250ha in each district. READ SI will fund the first year contract with IRRC and the 
BPTPs, with a user pay arrangement being established after Year 1.  
328.  Other  food  and  estate  crop  groups  will  also  receive  starter  input  packages  which  will  be 
designed  in  keeping  with  the  necessary  inputs  to  start  adopting  the  improved  production 
systems though scaled within the available budget of the programme. In the case of cocoa, this 
will be designed in the context of the PPPs with MARS Cocoa, Mondelez and others. 
329.  For  example,  copra  production  groups  may  receive  funding  to  construct  a  group  level  copra 
drying facility with a cost limit of $667 per group. The objective will be to no longer rely on air 
drying but to use coconut husks and shells as fuel to operate a smoker/dryer.  
Activity 3: Agricultural equipment, machinery and small infrastructure 
Production Equipment for Food Crops 
330.  To increase labour productivity, READ SI  will support  farmers and farmers groups to invest in 
agricultural  machinery.  This  will  be  primarily  approached  as  a  small  machinery  service 
enterprise investment. As such the approach is described under Sub-component 1.3 - Activity 3 
(see para  371). 
331. 
In  addition  to  on-farm mechanization  investments,  READ  SI  will  also  address  other  rice  post-
harvest issues. In particular, READ SI will ensure the supply of one vermin proof, air tight heavy 
duty  200L  plastic  drum  to  each  group  household  who  produces  rice  for  hermetic  storage  of 
rice/seed. Further, each group will receive a moisture meter (to ensure drying quality meets the 
required criteria  – not greater than 14% moisture content before storage or sale) and a set of 
24 In fact, the seed, fertilizer and cultivation costs are Rp 6.3m per ha.

weighing scales. The scales will empower groups to accurately monitor crop yields, to monitor 
the performance of the village miller and to monitor the accuracy of rice trader scales.  
Production Equipment for Cocoa 
332. 
In addition to a start up package for cocoa production, READ SI will provide funding to supply 
fermentation  and  other  cocoa  post-harvest  equipment  up  to  $38  per  group.  [Detailed 
arrangements will be further defined following further discussions with MARS  and Modelez  on 
the scope/approach within the PPPs prior to programme effectiveness]. 
Small Infrastructure for agriculture and non-farm livelihoods 
333.  For small productive infrastructure, READ SI will support  investment of approximately IDR100 
million  per  village  only  in  new  villages.  The  infrastructure  investments  will  be  implemented  in 
the  second  and  third  years  of  Programme  activity  in  the  village  and  not  before.  The 
infrastructure investment will be implemented as two IDR50 million allocations and comply with 
GoI regulations on participatory infrastructure investment, with beneficiary contributions allowed 
in-kind.  Provision  of  infrastructure  support  will  be  subject  to  satisfactory  performance  of  the 
groups in the village during the first two years of programme activities.  
334.  The  process  will  involve  participatory  decision  making  in  the  selection  and  planning  of  the 
works,  community  planning  for  sustainable  O&M  arrangements,  community  supervision  of 
construction and public community  audit  of works and expenditures  after completion.  VFs  will 
be trained to facilitate all steps of this process.  
335.  Disbursement  of  funds  will  be  via  the  Village  Account,  under  the  supervision  of  the  Village 
Head. It is hoped that the participatory planning and decision making process used for this will 
demonstrate to the Village Head and other village stakeholders an effective and efficient local 
participatory planning process that may be relevant to other similar plans, such as those for the 
Village Fund provided for under the Village Law.  If there is interest from the Village Head and 
village  community  to  build  on  this  approach  for  wider  use  in  the  village,  then  the  VF  will  be 
made available to the village to actively support this process under the guidance of the Village 
Head and with backstopping from the Social Mobilization (SM) supervisors in the sub-district.

Appendix 4:  Detailed programme description 
PART B:  Agriculture activities in Existing (Old) READ Villages 
336.  The proposed READ SI design includes maintaining an active but reduced engagement with 10 
villages  per  district  which  were  part  of  the  post  MTR  R-1  implementation  (5  districts  in 
Sulawesi) and the MoA READ replication (4 districts in total in West Kalimantan and NTT). The 
rationale for this is that there are established SHGs in these villages which can be the basis for 
further learning which will be relevant to the later implementation stages of READ SI. Examples 
of  this  include:  (i)  READ  revolving  fund  groups  which  are  sufficiently  “mature”  for  proposed 
bank  link  arrangements  to  be  operationalised  immediately  (see  Sub-comp  1.2);  (ii)  SHGs  or 
individual  members  of  SHGs  who  could  be  encouraged  to  take  investment  loans  to  finance 
additional mechanization services (e.g. tractors, combine harvesters, flat bed dryers); (iii) SHGs 
who  could  reliably  run  on-farm  trials  of  various  varieties  of  rice  and  cocoa  –  from  both 
government  and  non-government  sources  –  to  demonstrate  their  relative  yield  and  quality 
merits;  and  (iv)  Cocoa  Doctors  will  run  inter-cropping  trials  (e.g.  cocoa  under  coconuts)  to 
establish economic viability.  
337. 
Integrated homestead gardening groups will be mobilized in existing READ villages and receive 
the  same  extension  training  and  starter  input  packages  as  outlined  above  for  new  READ  SI 
villages. 
338. 
In addition, READ SI will provide further in-service training to PPL staff as well as provide sub-
district office upgrades - $1,500 each. (See sub-component 2.1).  
339. 
In the “old” villages in NTT , READ will provide one group in each of the 19 participating villages 
with  30  locally  sourced  female  goats  selected  according  to  the  following  criteria.  (i)  Female 
goats - aged 18-24 months i.e. having 2 adult teeth; (ii) Written veterinary approval from District 
Vet assuring disease and defect free status.  
340.  Half of group members will be provided with 3 adult female goats. Goats will be vaccinated prior 
to  distribution  against  pasturellosis  and  drenched  for  internal  parasites.  After  three  kidding 
cycles  (typically  18-20  months)  each  beneficiary  will  pass  the  original  3  adult  goats  to  a 
member of a newly formed group, but keeping all the off-spring kids for herself. READ staff, will 
engage  with  the  recipient  women  when  purchasing  the  goats  so  they  are  satisfied  with  the 
quality 
Non-farm livelihoods 
341.  Non-farm livelihood activities will also be supported based on the experience from the original 
READ  model  to  provide  opportunities  for  households  with  minimal  agricultural  land.    In  an 
evolution  of  the  READ  approach  in  this  area,  non-farm  livelihood  opportunities  will  be 
addressed in a more selective way based on credible local market opportunities.   
342.  There  is  a  need  to  assess  the  market  for  the  non-farm  products/services  before  deciding  if 
/what non-farm activities to support in the village. As such, non-farm livelihoods activities may 
not  be  implemented  in  all  villages,  but  only  those  villages  where  credible  market  potential 
opportunities are identified. This will include the following steps: 
(i) 
(ii) 
Step  1:  Evaluate  the  impact  of  the  different  non-farm  activities  under  original  READ 
project 
Step  2:  Complete  local  market  potential  scans  at  Sub-District  and  District  level  for 
credible non-farm opportunities 
(iii)  Step 3: For identified opportunities, identify suitable trainers with the necessary skills 
and  experience  to  conduct  training  and  capacity  building  so  that  the  groups  can 
competitively  produce  what  the  market  wants  to  buy.  This  should  probably  not  be 
done  by  extension  officers  (PPLs).  Training  should  be  oriented  towards  these 
activities as a small enterprise so would also need to include enterprise training.

Appendix 4:  Detailed programme description 
1.3 Savings, credit and financial literacy 
343.  Affordable seasonal and investment finance, whether loans from banks, MFIs, CBFOs including 
cooperatives  or  from  own  savings,  is  vital  if  households  are  to  be  able  to  invest  in  improving 
their farming and household enterprises to raise incomes and take the opportunities presented 
by READ SI technical support.  
344.  Yet,  while  there  are  many  encouraging  developments  in  the  financial  sector  in  Indonesia  and 
expansion of coverage in rural areas, the reality for many of the READ SI target households is 
that they still lack reliable  and  affordable access to  the necessary funding they need  to make 
the most of their farming and livelihood opportunities. 
345.  There  are  many  historic  factors  which  have  contributed  to  the  current  situation  -  both  on  the 
farmers’ side in terms of the demand for savings, loans and other financial services as well on 
the side of the banks and MFIs in terms of the supply and delivery of suitable financial products 
and services.  
346. 
In  rural  areas,  there  are  also  particular  challenges  in  the  practical  mechanisms  for  many 
potential small savers and borrowers to link to banks and MFIs  - in part due to a mismatch in 
scale  and  the  associate  high  transaction  costs  involved.  This  mismatch  of  scale  is  akin  to 
similar problems faced by small farmers when selling their produce, where there is often a need 
for  bulking  and  aggregation  at  the  village  or  group  level  to  improve  efficiencies  and  reduce 
transaction  costs  before  they  become  economical  for  businesses  to  trade  with.  The  same  is 
true for financial services and, while the advent of digital financial services, mobile banking and 
agent  networks  are  reducing  these  barriers,  there  is  still  a  need  for  increased  efficiencies  in 
linking  farmers  to  banks  and  MFIs  -  often  through  village  or  community-based  financial 
organisations under various models of financial intermediation. 
347.  These  gaps  between  farmers  and  financial  service  providers  need  to  be  bridged  if  large 
numbers  of  households  are  to  be  able  to  invest  to  fulfil  their  potential.  READ  SI  will  work  to 
bridge this gap using a three-pronged attack to strengthen demand, supply and intermediation  
(or direct channels) to link the two, through: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
strengthen  household  demand  and  confidence  in  using  formal  financial  services, 
including savings, loans and other financial services primarily through improvements 
in individual financial literacy and good household financial disciplines 
strengthen  local  financial  intermediation  mechanisms,  especially  the  capacity  and 
inclusiveness  of  CBFO  and  local  MFIs  at  group,  village  or  sub-district  level  that  can 
help  aggregate  demand  and  supply  of  financial  services  at  the  local  level  in  some 
communities 
strengthen  supply  of  financial  services  from  banks  and  MFIs  into  READ  SI  villages, 
through  partnerships  (mostly  at  the  local  district  or  provincial  level)  to  improve  their 
outreach to READ SI groups and households and their confidence and willingness to 
serve them with their existing range of products and services. 
348.  Given the strong need for close integration within villages and READ SI mobilized groups of all 
the  elements  of  READ  SI  integrated  approach,  elements  (a)  and  (b)  are  covered  under 
Component  1,  as  they  will  be  primarily  implemented  within  villages  coordinated  by  VFs  with 
READ SI households, groups and existing CBFOs, while (c) operates mostly at the district and 
provincial level and so is addressed under Component 2 along with other key services. 
349.  The three core principles of the READ SI rural finance approach are to:  
(i) 
remain farmer-centred, in that the central focus must remain on enabling farmers and 
households to have affordable access to and use of necessary funding to invest in the 
83 
Republic of Indonesia 
Rural Empowerment and Agricultural Development Programme Scaling-up Initiative (READ SI) 
Final programme design report 
Appendix 4:  Detailed programme description 
(ii) 
(iii) 
opportunities in agriculture and non-farm livelihoods in general, and those presented 
by READ SI in particular:  
build on what already exists or is emerging within the financial services sector in 
Indonesia in general, and in Sulawesi, Kalimantan, NTT and programme districts and 
villages in particular. 
tackle constraints on both the demand and supply sides for financial services in 
READ SI villages and districts as well as the intermediation between demand and 
supply. 
350.  These RF activities will contribute to enable smallholders to meet their seasonal finance needs 
through  more  inclusive  financial  services  as  an  alternative  to  traditional  informal  loans,  for 
example  from  traders,  processors  or  off-takers  or  money  lenders.  It  shall  also  contribute  to 
financing mid-term farm investments, in particular tree crop development. Savings promotion as 
a  buffer  against  fluctuating  incomes  and  greater  resilience  is  recognized  as  equally  important 
as  credit  in  addressing  these  issue  of  sustainability  over  the  medium  term  and  will  be  a  key 
element of the supported activities on rural finance. 
Additional Outcomes and Outputs 
351.  The primary outcomes is already reflected in the logframe, with the success of these activities 
judged  by  READ  SI  ability  to  ensure  that  "80%  of  participating  households  have  affordable 
access to and use of sufficient seasonal & investment finance  – whether from CBFOs, formal 
FSP loans or own savings". 
352.  Beyond  the  main  indicators  in  the  Programme  Logframe,  performance  against  the  specific 
objectives  on  savings,  credit  and  financial  literacy  will  a  measured  through  additional  key 
performance indicators: 
(i) 
60% of total programme supported households are saving regularly25 with a CBFO or 
other FSPs at least once per month on average (as a proxy measure of good financial 
discipline) 
(ii) 
Financial literacy levels26 substantially increased  for 50% of participating smallholder 
(iii)  Capacity strengthened of existing village and sub-district level MFIs, LKM-A27, CBFOs 
and others. 
Main Investment Activities 
Activity 1: Financial Literacy Training 
353.  Financial literacy in Indonesia as a whole is low. According to a 2013 survey of 8000 household 
countrywide by OJK, the financial literacy in Indonesia achieved 21.8% and the inclusion level 
59.7%.28  This  problem  is  likely  to  be  especially  acute  among  the  poorer  farmers  and 
households who are the primary target households for READ SI. 
354.  To begin to address this, it is important first to create a safe and constructive atmosphere that 
promotes  talking  about  finance.  This  is  not  always  a  natural  thing  for  many  individuals  and 
households - who for various reasons may be unwilling at first to talk about money.  As such the 
25 may also include regular payments into financial products such as education insurance, life insurance etc.  
26 Financial Literacy measurement to use international tools e.g. OECD FL measurement tool which assess financial 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviours and generates a score ranging from 1-22 points. Definition for "substantial 
improvement" to be determined  based on measurement tool used, for example an increment of 3 points on the OECD 
FL scale.

way in which the financial literacy training is delivered is almost as important as the content of 
the training. 
355.  The financial literacy training will be delivered to the groups mobilized as outlined in Sub-comp 
1.1 on Social Mobilization,  above, and will be conducted in all old and new READ SI villages. 
The financial  literacy training  will take a very practical approach and  will be closely  integrated 
with the agricultural and livelihoods technical training - using the focus crops or activities of the 
groups  as  the  basis  for  learning  and  practicing  financial  literacy  skills.  This  will  therefore  be 
done in cooperation with the PPLs and technical training modules expanded to include financial 
aspects. It will also be closely linked to the self-help savings and loan activities initiated within 
the  groups  that  will  enable  participants  of  the  financial  literacy  training  to  put  their  new 
knowledge into practice immediately for example by beginning some small but regular savings 
in their groups. 
356.  Basic  financial  literacy  training  will  be  offered  alongside  technical  training  to  all  farmers  that 
receive  programme  support.  However,  it  is  assumed  that  for  various  reasons  the  attendance 
will  not  exceed  70%.  The  FL  training  will  be  on  a  voluntary  basis,  offered  during  the  initial 
approximately  twelve  months  of  implementation  in  each  village.  The  time  and  place  of  the 
training  discussions  should  be  decided  by  the  participants  themselves  to  facilitate  good 
participation.  No  training  attendance  allowances  will  be  provided  to  participants,  although 
simple drinks/snacks may be provided during the training.  
357.  The scope of the financial  literacy training should typically  include several main modules, and 
as a minimum cover: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
financial  literacy  as  promoted  by  OJK,  which  concerns  the  presentation  and 
understanding of the role of banks and their products, benefits of saving and savings 
as  well  as  opportunities  that  loans  may  contribute  to  realize;  the  various  loan 
covenants  and  options  outside  a  monthly  instalment  loan  should  deserve  a  special 
focus;  
household  economy  (Ekonomi  Rumah  Tangga),  which  concerns  the  planning  of 
income  and  expenditures  of  households  in  which  the  erratic  business  cycles  and 
mostly  constant  household  necessities  have  to  be  understood  in  order  to  better 
manage times of deficits and surplus;

358.  There are a large number of high quality resources and training materials already available for 
financial literacy (FL) training for rural households, including those specifically designed for use 
with farmers e.g. those of Mercy Corps Indonesia. READ SI should build on these rather than 
develop new materials from scratch. Another source is the internationally recognized resources

Appendix 4:  Detailed programme description 
359.  Training is often best organized in 8-12 short weekly training meetings, each lasting 1-2 hours 
and scheduled at times and locations that are chosen by the participants themselves as being 
most   convenient - often early in the morning or in the evening. Each session may include 20-
30 individual participants - this will be determined by the size of the group mobilized under sub-
comp 1.1.  
360.  FL  training  needs  to  use  adult  learning  principles  and  a  learner  centred  approach.  It  is  not 
sufficient just to run awareness raising and information sharing activities. It is important that the 
participants  have  the  opportunity  to  immediately  put  their  new  skills  and  knowledge  into 
practice.  So  the  financial  literacy  training  should  be  run  as  an  integrated  part  of  the  initial 
mobilization of the self help savings and loan activities of the groups. 
361.  This will be delivered via the VFs and SM teams through a cascade approach in which the VFs, 
backstopped by the SM service provider, help the programme supported groups to select one 
or two of their own members to act as Financial Literacy Facilitators (FLFs). These are typically 
local  residents,  often  women,  who  have  done  well  at  school,  are  eloquent  and  still  live  in  or 
have returned to the village long term. They are then provided with in-depth training, provided 
by  the  sub-district  SM  supervisors,  and  resources  for  delivering  Financial  Literacy  training 
courses to their fellow group members.  
362.  As  permanent  and  respected  members  of  their  groups  and  communities  they  are  always  on 
hand to support and coach their fellow members in how to put their new financial and business 
skills in to practice - on their farms or other households enterprises. The FLFs gain a high level 
of skill and confidence and in similar projects have often been found to increasingly contribute 
to  the  management  of  the  groups,  supporting  preparation  of  investment  plans  as  well  as 
helping with negotiations with traders and buyers on behalf of their group.  
363.  The FLFs will pay a small fee for running the financial literacy classes of approximately USD3 
per session (equivalent to a total of USD36 for a 12 session course). This is done both as an 
incentive to run the classes but also to demonstrate the value of the service so that in the future 
the  FLF  may  consider  continuing  to  offer  related  simple  services  to  their  friends  and 
neighbours, such as filling forms for loan applications or preparing simple business plans for a 
small fee. 
364.  The approach will be tested in a number of communities early in the programme and then rolled 
out once local adaptations have been fine tuned.  These activities will be linked to the activities 
with  local  lending  offices  of  partner  FSP  under  Sub-component  2.2,  who  will  be  invited  to 
provide  materials  and  attend  the  relevant  training  session  on  financial  services  to  introduce 
their products and services and explain how households can access these services. 
Activity 2: Savings and loan activities within groups  
365. 
In  villages  where  there  are  existing  active  and  well  managed  CBFOs  (e.g.  LKM-A  or  other 
village-based/community-owned  organizations  including  Sharia  compliant  models  such  as 
BMT),  with  good  governance,  internal  management  and  adequate  liquidity,  who  serve  some 
READ  SI  target  households  and  are  motivated  to  serve  more,  READ  SI  will  facilitate 
programme households to join these CBFO and/or begin using savings and loans. However, in 
practice  in  many  READ  SI  villages  active  CBFOs  capable  and  willing  to  serve  READ  SI 
households are expected to be the exception rather than the norm (in contrast to the situation in 
much of Java and Sumatra). For example MOA report just 54 LKM-A in all of Sulawesi - despite 
there being around 42,000 Gapoktan (Village Farmers Group Association) to which LKM-A are 
attached  (see  Working  Paper).  As  such  READ  SI  must  work  with  the  real  situation  on  the 
ground in its villages.  
366. 
In villages where there are not existing active and well managed CBFOs, as is expected to be 
the most common situation, READ SI will promote small-scale savings and credit groups as a 
second focal activity  within all the READ SI commodity and livelihood groups mobilized under

Rural Empowerment and Agricultural Development Programme Scaling-up Initiative (READ SI) 
Final programme design report 
Appendix 4:  Detailed programme description 
sub-component 1.1 and 1.2. This is expected to help strengthen and sustain the common bond 
within these groups. This is considered an important element to help maintain and amplify the 
social  capital  enhanced  under  READ  SI  and  empower  the  members  of  the  groups  to  engage 
more  fully  in  the  wider  development  processes  in  their  community,  especially  under  the  new 
village Law 6/2014 and in view of increased annual budget allocations from central government.  
367.  A  second  important  purpose  of  the  SCGs  is  to  create  a  safe  space  in  which  members  can 
practice and become more confident savers and borrowers and start to practice better financial 
behaviours and household financial disciplines, for example with regular savings no matter how 
small  the  amount.  This  is  especially  important  to  include  for  poorer  and  more  marginal 
households  who may otherwise not  have the confidence to start using financial services from 
banks or MFIs. 
368.  These embedded SCG activities will be based on self-help group principles and will follow the 
approach  promoted  in  READ  in  terms  of  group  management,  meeting  protocols,  internal 
governance and record keeping.  However, in  a departure from the READ approach, the  SCG 
activities will be savings-led and the READ SI will not provide seed capital in cash or kind. This 
is done to increase the sense of ownership of the group funds by its members and savings led 
groups  have  been  widely  found  to  be  more  sustainable  than  those  mobilized  to  access 
externally provided credit.  
369. 
In terms of the loan side of the SCG activities, the lending capital will take a long time to grow 
(as it is from group savings and retained earnings on loans). As such, and in keeping with the 
self-help model, loans are primarily expected to be very small productive loans or for social or 
emergency  purposes.  It  is  not  intended  that  these  SCG  activities  will  be  a  primary  source  of 
loans for seasonal finance or investment in farm or non-farm activities.  
370.  Mobilization  and capacity  building of  SCGs  will be led by the  VFs  with backstopping from the 
SM service provider teams and the District Financial Advisors. 
Activity 3: Machinery investment 
371.  With declining agricultural labour, there is a large unmet demand for mechanization services in 
many  villages,  especially  for  crops  with  two  or  three  harvests  in  one  year,  such  as  rice  and 
corn/maize.  Given  the  scale  of  this  demand,  it  is  neither  feasible  nor  appropriate  for  this 
demand to be met by the public sector. At the same time, small machinery service enterprises 
are  technically  and  financially  viable,  as  already  demonstrated  by  many  micro-entrepreneurs 
across the country. In the spirit of READ SI, the programme will seek to build on what is already 
working rather than replace it and so will seek to stimulate greater private investment in small 
machinery  service  enterprises  -  by  farmer  groups  or  by  individual  farmers  who  are  willing  to 
make the investment. 
372.  Therefore, in addition to the main farmer-centred financial services activities, for farmer groups 
and  individuals  (farmer  families)  that  are  seeking  to  make  larger  investments  typically  for  a 
machinery  service  enterprise  (e.g.  in  hand-tractors,  combined  harvester  machine,  rice  driers 
etc.)  by  accessing  private  bank  finance  or  public  funds  (e.g.  UPSUS)  the  VFs  will  facilitate 
these  groups  to  link  with  the  relevant  professional  and  technical  staff,  e.g.  DINAS  Pertanian 
(District  Agriculture  Office),  to  prepare  their  investment  proposals.  VFs  will  be  available  to 
support  the  preparation  of  these  investment  proposals  if  needed,  but  with  backstopping  on 
financial and technical aspects from the District Financial Advisors (DFAs) of the District teams 
as  well  as  partner  FSP  staff.  The  simple  business  plans  for  their  new  machinery  service 
enterprise,  must  include  setting  user  charges  that  are  sufficient  to  assure  full  regular 
maintenance as well as provide funding for equipment replacement at the end of its working life 
(depreciation).  
87 
Republic of Indonesia 
Rural Empowerment and Agricultural Development Programme Scaling-up Initiative (READ SI) 
Final programme design report 
Appendix 4:  Detailed programme description 
373.  READSI  will  also  deliberately  test  the  cost  effectiveness  of  various  levels  of  subsidy  for  the 
purchase  of basic  and advance machinery. The level  of subsidy to be tested may  range from 
30%-70%. 
374.  Because  the  objective  for  READ  SI  is  to  ensure  poor  farmers  have  better  access  to  timely 
cultivation,  READ  SI  will  also  facilitate  links  to  commercial  banks  to  enable  interested  group 
farmer(s)  to  borrow  to  fund  additional  tractors.  In  this  way,  the  operational  capacity  of  one 
tractor  of  around  12ha  per  cropping  season  can  ensure  each  member  has  access  to  timely 
cultivation. Similarly, the labour burden on women of manual rice threshing is alleviated.  
375. 
In addition to technical and business  planning advice, READ  SI  will promote the  use  of small 
equipment and machinery that will improve the welfare of the group members. The programme 
will  make  best  use  of  limited  resources  and  increase  sustainability  by  not  handing  over  the 
equipment free of charge.  
376.  Those groups or individuals choosing to invest in machinery will be provided with training for up 
to 2 operators per investment in a course to be designed and delivered by the ATC at Makassar 
(for advanced  equipment)  or locally for  basic equipment.  Such training may  also be delivered 
through  partnerships  with  the  equipment  suppliers  themselves,  especially  for  advanced 
equipment. 
377.  For  basic  equipment,  such  as  tractors,  threshers  and  mobile  mills,  READ  SI  will  offer  small 
equipment and machinery grants to its groups that have demonstrated good performance over 
the  first  two  years  of  activities,  e.g.  in  SCG  activity  or  adoption  of  demonstrated  production 
technologies.  However,  these  activities  will  only  begin  after  MTR  to  avoid  duplication  with  the 
large  support  to  basic  machinery  being  provided  to  farmers  groups  under  MoA’s  UPSUS 
programme. 
378.  For READSI, basic machinery investment will be promoted via matching grants. to encourage 
individual  farmers  or  groups  to  invest  in  tractors,  threshers,  mobile  rice  mills  to  provide  basic 
machinery services in target villages. As there is an established market for these services and 
known costs of investment and operation it is expected that partial loan financing is likely to be 
available from banks.  
379.  The  use  of  the  grant  is  to  encourage  investment  from  farmers  in  starting  these  service 
enterprises  as  other  wealthier  households  who  could  afford  to  invest  may  have  a  declining 
interest  in  agriculture  and  hence  leave  a  gap  in  the  market  for  such  investments.  The 
percentage  of  the  grant  will  be  adjusted  as  required  to  achieve  the  lowest  level  necessary  to 
stimulate investment. 
380.  Grants will be tested at different levels of subsidy from 30% grants up to 70% grants to assess 
the  most  cost-effective  level  of  support  needed  to  trigger  investment  by  target  farmers.  For 
reasons of equity, there will also be a cap on the total grant provided per group (approx. USD 
1500  per  group).  The  percentage  of  matching  grant  offered  will  be  reviewed  and  adjusted  if 
necessary based on uptake from farmers in reality. The principle will be to provide the smallest 
percentage grant necessary  to trigger private investment in the machinery service enterprises 
in the villages. 
381.  Based on business plans, grant funds may be provided to the groups as a whole or to sub-sets 
of members that are prepared to invest in setting up these machinery service enterprises. The 
effect  of  introducing  equipment  can  be  tripled  if  the  groups  or  individuals  contribute  with  two 
thirds to the investment costs, thus allowing up to 75% [or even 100%] bank financing based on 
a collateral value assumed to be 50% [66%]). 
382.  This support to investment in basic equipment will be provided in only in new villages. In new 
villages this will be provided after the second year of engagement in the village and be subject 
to satisfactory performance of the group in other READ SI activities up to that point in time. 
88 
Republic of Indonesia 
Rural Empowerment and Agricultural Development Programme Scaling-up Initiative (READ SI) 
Final programme design report 
Appendix 4:  Detailed programme description 
383.  Support to investments in upgrading village-based rice mills will also be considered under the 
similar arrangements for basic machinery. 
384.  For  advanced  equipment,  such  as  harvesters,  transplanters  and  driers,  it  is  recognized  that 
banks  and  MFIs  are  unlikely  to  extend  finance  at  present.  As  such  advanced  equipment 
investment  will  be  promoted  through  a  scheme  of  "try  before  you  buy"  coordinated  by  the 
contracted Specialist Implementing Partner for rural finance. 
385.  Ensuring compliance with prevailing GoI regulation, READ SI will implement a scheme in which 
the  programme  offers  this  equipment  for  time-limited  test  trials  (e.g.  one  year)  or  based  on 
rent/leasing contracts to its groups that have demonstrated good performance over the first two 
years  of  activities,  e.g.  in  SCG  activity  or  adoption  of  demonstrated  production  technologies. 
After the test-trial, the equipment will be offered for purchase to the group using it at preferential 
price. In the event they choose not to purchase it, it  will be passed on to another group for a 
new time-limited trial on the same basis until it is  purchased by  one  of the groups. Details on 
type and number of equipment as well as detailed procedures will be developed as part of the 
detailed PIM preparation and ensure compliance with Indonesian budget regulations29.  
386.  Machinery suppliers will be encouraged to participate in the schemes and to also contribute to 
the provision of training on the equipment use as a service enterprise. 
387.  Support  to  investment  in  advanced  equipment  will  initially  be  piloted  in  old  villages  only  from 
Year 1 of READ  SI. The  approach  will  then be refined based on experience from these initial 
pilots before being rolled  out to all  villages after Year 3 of interventions subject to satisfactory 
performance  of  the  group  in  other  READ  SI  activities  up  to  that  point  in  time  and  available 
budgets. 
388.  Especially  important  for  these  advanced  machinery,  those  groups  or  individuals  choosing  to 
invest  in  machinery  will  be  provided  with  training  for  up  to  2  operators  per  investment  in  a 
course  to  be  designed  and  delivered  by  the  ATC  at  Makassar  (for  advanced  equipment)  or 
locally for basic equipment. Such training may also be delivered through partnerships with the 
equipment suppliers themselves, especially for advanced equipment. 
389.  Due to budget limitations, it is expected that each old village will be allowed to choose to initially 
test one piece of advanced machinery under this scheme chosen from either driers, harvesters, 
transplanters or other advanced machinery for annual crop mechanization. 
390. 
It is noted that this is a different approach to that used in READ or the current UPSUS where 
machinery  is  given  to  groups  for  free.  The  use  of  partial  grants  is  intended  to  increase  the 
sense of ownership of those receiving the machinery while still making it more affordable. With 
greater  ownership  and  beneficiaries  having  invested  some  of  their  own  money,  there  is 
expected  to  be  a  much  more  professional  and  active  use,  operation  and  maintenance  of  the 
equipment  -  ensuring  the  machinery  services  are  more  sustainably  available  to  serve  local 
farmer  demand.  It  can  also  help  act  as  a  demonstration  to  other  farmers  and  FSPs  of  the 
feasibility of such investments. 
391.  The  VFs,  with  support  from  FSP  staff  and  District  teams,  will  support  interested  farmers  and 
farmers groups to prepare simple machinery service business plans and submit applications for 
loans from the partner FSPs. These will be based on tried-and-tested template business plans 
that  will  reflect  actual  realized  operating  and  maintenance  costs  (based  on  the  test  period  for 
less  common  equipment),  pricing  of  services,  financing  costs,  depreciation  (to  enable 
replacement) and cash flow. 
29 At the time of writing, current regulations mean that GoI may hand over equipment free of charge (donation)to 
farmers groups  but not lease it for a test period and sell it without following established procedures (public auctioning).

Appendix 4:  Detailed programme description 
Activity 4: Strengthening of existing CBFOs and LKM-A 
392.  Where  they  exist,  the  most  compelling  option  for  improving  access  to  financial  service  is  to 
strengthen  existing  LKM-A  and  other  village-based/community/member-owned  organizations 
(including Sharia compliant models such as Baitul Maal wat Tamwil, BMT). Such strengthening 
would  include,  for  example,  support  to  become  a  MFI  according  to  Law  1/2013  on  MFIs  or  a 
cooperative  as  well  as  establishing  bank  linkages  for  a  range  of  financial  services  and 
refinancing CBFO funds and including mobile/digital financial services.  
393.  For  each  identified  CBFO  with  credible  potential  for  growth  and  provide  inclusive  financial 
services in their community, the DFA will conduct a capacity assessment and jointly develop a 
capacity  building  plan.  In  doing  so,  the  DFA  will  work  closely  with  the  District  agencies 
responsible for micro-finance supervisions as well as the READ SI SM service provider team.  
394.  Under  guidance  of  the  PFAs,  the  DFAs  will  identify  CBFOs  that  provide  inclusive  financial 
services in their community  and have a credible potential for growth  asset-wise  and capacity-
wise  (HRD).  The  DFAs  will  conduct  related  assessments  and  jointly  with  the  CBFO 
management  and  other  stakeholders,  predominantly  the  village  government,  the  district 
agencies  responsible  for  the  development  and  supervision  of  MFIs  and  the  READ  Si  SM 
service  provider team agree on a plan to improve the performance and  eventually  develop to 
become a registered MFI. 
395.  Once the individual CBFO strengthening plans have been defined and agreed with the CBFO, 
the DFA  will coordinate delivery of the training, coaching and other capacity  building activities 
defined  in  the  plan.    The  DF Advisor  will  deliver  more  technically  advanced  elements  of  the 
capacity building and training, sometimes for the management teams of several CBFOs in joint 
training  sessions,  while  the  VF  and  Sub  District  SM  Supervisors  will  provide  more  regular 
follow-up and day to day coaching of the CBFOs to help them put the improved management 
skills and process into practice. 
396.  Such support from READ SI to the existing CBFOs may also include assistance in completing 
formal registration with OJK, if appropriate, and also the provision of some limited quantities of 
equipment necessary for improved management practices (e.g. laptops / printers for electronic 
record keeping and reporting). 
397.  Finally, once the CBFO obtained the permit and became a registered MFI operating under OJK 
supervision, there will be a particular focus on supporting the concerned institution to link with a 
bank for refinancing. 
Activity 5: Farm insurance expansion 
398. 
In  addition  to  the  major  activities  above,  READ  SI  will  also  partner  with  MoA's  Dept.  of 
Agricultural Financed (DAF) on extending the coverage and use of farm insurance products by 
smallholders.  DAF  launched  new  farm  insurance  products  for  rice  and  livestock  in  October 
2015. They hope to extend farm insurance to cover additional crops and livestock. READ SI will 
collaborate and support DAF to develop, market test and promote suitable insurance products. 
Consideration will also be given to the feasibility of farm insurance products for cocoa orchard 
replanting and rehabilitation. 
Implementation Arrangements 
399.  The  rural  finance  (RF)  activities  under  Component  1  and  2  need  to  be  coordinated  by  an 
experienced team of Financial Advisors with experience working with farmers, farmers groups, 
banks and MFI and how to link them. Similar to social mobilization under READ, this is not yet 
an area of core competence of AAEHRD nor of the district government agencies. As such, it is 
proposed  for  READ  SI  that  similar  implementation  arrangements  are  used  for  RF  as  for  SM 
activities, working with a specialist implementing partner organization that has a demonstrated 
90

Final programme design report 
Appendix 4:  Detailed programme description 
track  record  in  this  area.  The  Financial Advisors  would  work  as  a  fully  integrated  part  of  the 
READ SI implementation teams as national, provincial and district levels. 
400.  The overall financial service team would comprise: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
1 x National financial advisors (NFA) 
5 x Provincial financial advisors (PFA) - based on one PFA for each of NTT and West 
Kalimantan with three PFA to each cover two provinces in Sulawesi 
55 x District financial advisors (DFA) - with two per district -> one per district acting as 
overall coordinator of finance activities in the district and one as the deputy. Districts 
working in villages in very remote areas will be assigned an extra DFA. 
401.  These technical teams will be supported by and work closely with the VFs.  At the village level 
the  VFs  will  lead and  facilitate all RF activities,  but  with more advanced training and  capacity 
building conducted by the DFAs. The senior NFA and PFAs will provide technical backstopping 
and  supervision  of  rural  finance  (RF)  activities  in  the  Districts,  as  well  as  delivering  ToT  and 
other activities.  
402.  Capacity building of CBFOs/MFI will be led by the DFA team who will also coordinate the FSP 
partnerships at the local branch level and coordinate with the District MFI supervisory agencies 
on a day to day basis. FSP relationship at the provincial and national level will be coordinated 
by the respective RF managers, as will the collaboration with OJK. 
403.  The  RF  specialist  implementing  partner  organization  will  need  to  have  proven  experience  in 
similar locations of, among other things: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
agricultural finance for market-oriented smallholders and farmer groups 
setting up partnership with mainstream banks to link farmers or farmers groups and 
CBFO, MFIs or cooperatives to the banks under linkage banking schemes 
good relationships with a range of mainstream banks interested in the rural sector in 
Indonesia 
(iv) 
designing and delivery financial and business literacy training for smallholder farmers 
(v)  CBFO / savings and loan group mobilization and strengthening 
404.  The design team have met managers from at least one current leading Indonesia NGO that has 
similar experience, so it is considered highly likely that READ SI would be able to hire such a 
service provider. 
Village Facilitators roles in Savings, Loans and Financial literacy 
405.  VFs  play  a  central  role  in  the  sub-component.  In  relation  to  savings  and  loan  activities  their 
main roles include: 
(i) 
(ii) 
Oversee and implement financial literacy training to farmers 
Facilitating linkages between farmers and partner FSP staff,  
(iii)  Strengthening CBFOs and SCGs 
(iv)  Supporting farmers who are interested in using savings and credit services offered by 
partner FSPs, including support in preparing necessary simple farm 
investment/business plans and loan applications etc. 
(v) 
Support to farmer groups and MFIs on how to access public and private funding for 
group investments 
(vi)  Supporting internal supervisors or even acting as supervisor for those CBFOs that 
obtain programme support including training but are not (yet) under the supervision of 
91 
Republic of Indonesia 
Rural Empowerment and Agricultural Development Programme Scaling-up Initiative (READ SI) 
Final programme design report 
Appendix 4:  Detailed programme description 
OJK/district governments; the involvement of outsiders may give these groups 
enhanced reputation and trust, in particular among the poorer villagers, who believe 
that the VFs may prevent that insiders take over the group and allocate substantial 
loan amounts to themselves. The supervision is strongly recommended or even 
mandated as long as the management of these CBFOs is not certified and the 
savings deposits of the villagers are not insured (no support beyond training without 
enhanced transparency including the right to supervision). It is expected that it will still 
take some years until savings deposits with registered MFIs will also be covered by 
the Indonesia Deposit Insurance Corporation (Lembaga Penjamin Simpanan, LPS). 
406.  The VFs will assist loan applicants in those processes that these prospective borrowers regard 
as  confusing  and  difficult  (but  which  are  easy  and  not  very  complicated  according  to  most 
successful  borrowers).  The  VFs  can  assist  the  farmers  in  their  administrative  processes  that 
they  consider  cumbersome,  for  example  if  it  concerns  the  provision  of  pass  photos  that  are 
often required. In this respect, the programme supports borrowers and banks in reducing their 
transaction costs. Once two or three persons obtained a bank loan, the VFs may engage them 
to become reference persons in the village.  
Exit strategy 
407.  The  exit  strategy  is  central  to  the  entire  sub-component  approach,  which  builds  on,  expands 
and  strengthens  existing  elements  of  the  rural  financial  sector  in  Indonesia  in  general  and  in 
READ  SI  locations  in  particular  and  aligns  with  ongoing  national  initiatives  such  as  those  of 
OJK and DAF. 
408.  Partner FSPs will be selected based on their having a clear business and inclusion objective for 
further developing their client  base among smallholder farmers. Given this,  if they  are  able to 
profitably  serve  farmers  during  the  time  of  the  programme,  especially  according  to  OJK 
requirements with regards to an NPL ratio below 5%, then there is every likelihood that they will 
continue to do so after the programme closed and may even extend their client base to similar 
farmers elsewhere. 
409.  Furthermore, the programme will also collaborate with OJK to further strengthen the operating 
environment and supervision of MFIs to better serve rural households. OJK is legally required 
to  continue  these  activities  and  the  programme  is  providing  some  incremental  support  to 
accelerate these activities in programme areas. 
410.  Financial literacy skills, once acquired and practiced  are not  easily  lost, in particular not  in  an 
environment that develops agent-based and hand phone based DFS.  
411.  Overall  it  is  therefore  highly  likely,  if  the  FSP  partnerships  and  bank-CBFO/MFI  linkage 
schemes,  widely  known  in  Indonesia  (e.g.  former  IFAD  funded  P4K,  see  CPE  2014)  are  a 
success  (which  banks  measure  by  an  NPL  ratio  distinctly  below  5%),  that  these  and  other 
activities  will be continued  and farmers in programme villages  will continue  to enjoy far better 
access and use of financial services 
Risks and Issues 
Table 3: Risks – Rural Finance 
Risk / Issue 
Mitigation / Response 
1  Limited  outreach  by 
partner FSPs  
With BRI and BPDs as partner FSPs, the optimum outreach can be achieved. 
There are extremely few locations that are neither served by BRI (including one 
of the more than 50,000 agents), nor by BPD outlet or mobile bank units. In 
some selected places, a BPR with motorcycle units may show more presence 
than the aforementioned FSPs. The sustainability of very small BPRs is 
questioned in view of increasing equity requirements and subsidized small 
business loans (KUR) offered by BRI and BPDs.

Appendix 4:  Detailed programme description 
The two aforementioned FSPs may however not necessarily provide services to 
CBFOs, even if they are based on provincial or district regulations or even 
registered MFIs. In contrast, other institutions such as registered cooperatives 
and registered MFIs may offer specific financial products, e.g. financing a 
farmers group based on the executing scheme, as they do not have to adhere to 
the strict banking regulations. In the absence of performance-based agreements 
with programme participating FSPs, accountability, market outreach and the 
identification of bespoke products and services might be limited. Without having 
solid performance monitoring, it will be less likely to facilitate proper 
implementation of rural finance-related activities, and that such activities 
generate concrete results. It is also quite unlikely to lead to an enhancement of 
the reputation, brand value and trust in these particular FSPs, as well as to 
better portfolio quality and client retention. 
The principal mitigation measures will be through:

capitals  and  villages  and

 
 
 
portfolio approach, with partnership with multiple different FSPs 
with different scale, business strategies and capacities; 
careful selection of partner FSPs, including careful assessment of 
their real level of business interest in serving smallholder farmers, 
such as diversification or volume;   
active facilitation by VFs and other programme staff to enable FSP 
local staff to easily link with target farmers and communities and 
understand commercial opportunities of serving these clients 
(reducing FSP transaction costs); 
negotiation of performance-based agreements with regular review, 
including where appropriate incentive mechanisms within the FSP 
for local staff to serve READ SI smallholder farmers. 
The selection criteria for the villages that get assistance will most likely not take 
into consideration logistic aspects and distances to FSPs. The net time available 
for consultancy and training might be negatively affected. A higher number of VF 
might be requested, in particular when the programme selects remote locations, 
which are difficult to access, for example during the rainy season.  
 
Working in partnership with FSPs and CBFOs (e.g. LKM-A, BMT,) to strengthen 
and expand these will help improve sustainability of impacts in this area. The 
VFs through participation in group meetings and monitoring activities can 
prevent members abandoning their group. 
The VFs have to implement strict transparency guidelines and supervision 
procedures to prevent misappropriation of funds in those SCGs and MFIs that 
obtain READ SI support. The programme will assist and support MFIs in the 
introduction of prudential standards and independent supervision for the groups 
eligible.  
Human resources for the financial management of a farmer group, CBFO or MFI 
should not be limited to its named members. 
It is repeated experience that among the children of villagers one can often meet 
young women, even in remote villages, who obtained a higher education in 
towns and cities, but returned to their place of origin. They would have the 
diligence, capacity and motivation to administer SCGs, CBFOs or MFIs. It would 
be the task of the programme to identify these persons and promote them.  
Candidates may often be the Financial Literacy Facilitators 
Social performance strategies and track record will be a key part of the prior 
assessment of potential partner FSPs 
Social performance will be used as a key measure in the performance-based 
agreements with FSPs, and will be tracked and jointly reviewed regularly. FSPs 
that are unable to deliver inclusive services in practice will not be eligible to 
continue as READ SI partner FSPs. 
VFs will pay particular attention to ensure priority target groups (active or 
working poor, income generating women, young farmers) have the opportunity to 
meet (e.g. via literacy classes) local staff from FSPs and other FSPs and to 
understand and access their financial services.

of 
9.  No  proper  answer  to  the 
question  about  the  second 
way  out  when  the  income 
cannot repay the loan. 
The programme will work with partner FSPs to develop and test products (where 
not already available), especially lending products, that better meet the 
requirements of the priority target smallholder farmers while providing profitable 
opportunities for the FSPs themselves in serving these customer segments. 
The land certificate ownership (sertifikat hak milik) is a key to bank loans. Some 
villagers benefitted from the national effort to issue land certificates at low cost 
(Proyek Operasi Nasional Agraria, PRONA), whereas many villagers own land 
documents that banks might refuse as collateral.  The capacity of local 
authorities and the demand for joint land certification is unknown. Issuance of 
land certificates may become a bottleneck, in particular if the locations are 
scattered and difficult to access (selecting villages with least accessibility and 
infrastructure).   
Awareness training to limit loan exposure will have to become a crucial part of 
financial literacy training even if one might risk that several potential loan 
applicants might withdraw their loan proposals. 
Risk reducing measures are: FSPs check with BI’s Debtor Information System 
(Sistem Informasi Debitur, SID) and the government’s Credit Program 
Information System (Sistem Informasi Kredit Program, SIKP), family control 
(bank loans, in particular if land certificates serve as collateral, have to be 
countersigned by the spouse); maximum loan amounts and social control with 
regards to loans from CBFOs.  
Although land serves as collateral, there are very few cases of foreclosure 
concerning agriculture land and village dwellings. The programme will develop 
strategies, preferably in cooperation with OJK, FSPs and insurance providers, 
and elaborate answers to the question of indebtedness if the harvest proceeds 
cannot settle the loan repayment obligations. 
1.4 Nutrition (especially early childhood nutrition) 
412.  Nutrition will receive an even more explicit focus under READ SI in recognition of the stubbornly 
high  levels  of  child  malnutrition  despite  rising  incomes  and  improving  aggregate  food 
availability. While READ SI will place a greater emphasis on nutrition, it is recognized that there 
is  no  single  solution  to  tackle  these  problems.  Yet  the  fact  that  malnutrition  rates  remain 
unchanged  despite  rising  incomes  and  food  availability  give  some  clues  that  some  of  the 
remaining constraints to better nutrition are driven by social attitudes and norms. 
413.  READ  SI  will  therefore  adopt  a  multi-pronged  approach  to  improving  nutrition  as  well  as 
encouraging local innovation combined with evidence-based assessment to identify and scale-
up promising innovations in the approach to improving nutrition. 
414.  Nutrition activities will be conducted in all old and new READ villages coordinated by the Village 
Facilitators, including: 
(i) 
technical awareness raising and training on relevant technical knowledge concerning 
good  nutrition  practices,  food  stuffs  etc.  This  should  be  tailored  to  the  local  social-
agricultural  context  in  terms  of  the  way  the  knowledge  and  information  is  presented 
and  also  the  specific  advice  given  of  the  food  stuff  available  locally  in  different 
seasons that can form a part of balanced and healthy diet for different members of the 
family - from the very young to the very old. 
(ii) 
Integrated  homestead  gardening  -  promotion,  extension  and  starter  input  packages 
(see  Sub-comp  1.2)  to  increase  the  convenience  and  availability  of  supplementary 
vegetables and fruit to improve the quality of the dietary mix.  
(iii)  Women's  group  mobilization,  to  build  social  capital,  around  SCG,  gardening  and 
nutrition.  Within  these  groups,  the  programme  will  foster  mother  to  mother  mutual 
support, and are expected within the village to have ongoing mother and child groups 
94 
Republic of Indonesia 
Rural Empowerment and Agricultural Development Programme Scaling-up Initiative (READ SI) 
Final programme design report 
Appendix 4:  Detailed programme description 
(with  rolling  membership  over  time)  for  more  intensive  mutual  support  and  for  the 
programme and other health providers to channel more focused support. 
(iv)  Social  marketing  approaches  to  change  the  aspirational  and  social  status  of  good 
childhood nutrition - cooking competition, prizes, village level awards for whole village 
performance, Awards from Bupati at big events etc. 
415.  READ SI is expected to give a particular focus on the most critical period of early childhood and 
ante-natal  nutrition  -  from  conception  to  24  months,  the  so  called  "first  1000  days".  With  this 
focus the District team and SM/VF teams in particular will develop, test and evaluate a social 
marketing  approach  to  improving  early  childhood  and  ante-natal  nutrition.  The  activities  will 
focus on households with young children and recently married couples in the whole village (and 
not  general  activities  with  READ  SI  households).  The  intent  is  that  the  village  level  system 
should be designed to be self-sustaining without ongoing programme support once established. 
The village level system is expected to include, among other things: 
(i) 
Social marketing events such as cooking competitions, talks, celebrations to raise the 
status of good nutrition 
(ii)  Mother to mother support networks, through women's groups and regular mother and 
child meetings 
(iii)  Regular monitoring within the community itself (e.g. at monthly mother and child 
meetings) of i) baby growth, ii) nutrition practices and iii) diarrhoea incidence - with 
possible link to commune health centres 
(iv)  Provision of weighing scales, measuring equipment to each village for use in the 
context of mother to mother support meetings 
(v) 
Provision of household books (if not already provided by health workers) including 
growth charts for each child for recording progress - with possible link to established 
systems under and practices of village health workers if possible. 
(vi)  Activities to target different specific audiences involved in early childhood nutrition 
decision making - mothers, grandmothers, fathers - with different techniques if 
necessary 
(vii)  Link to ante and post natal care and monitoring by government health service - for 
example with health workers attending monthly mother and child meetings to be 
available to answer questions, provide advice and also to weigh and monitor 
development of babies and children 
(viii)  Awareness raising among men and wider families as well, both on technical aspects 
but also for raising the aspirational status of good nutrition in their families 
416.  READ SI will actively encourage and reward  local innovation by teams in Districts to work out 
what combination  of factors works best. These team will be give  freedom to develop  and  test 
different combinations of nutrition interventions combined with close monitoring of results using 
three  additional  indicators  tracked  on  a  minimum  quarterly  basis  to  get  rapid  learning  and 
feedback - both for the programme and also for  the mothers involved on  what is working and 
the progress they are making: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
stunting level of children (height for age) 
incidence of diarrhoea on children,  
dietary diversity - using a simple tool to list and categorize food stuffs eaten in the 
previous 24 hours 
417.  All  activities  should  be  designed  to  be  minimal  cost  activities  that  can  be  continued  by  the 
community themselves once established in order to increase longer term sustainability.

418.  Nutrition activities will be coordinated via SEKDA with Posyandu and volunteer health cadres in 
villages. READ SI's proposed four activity areas on nutrition are understood to be well aligned 
with  overall  framework  on  improved  nutrition  of  GoI,  coordinated  by  BAPPEDA  at  the  district 
level  and  will  contribute  to  the  achievement  of  this  GoI  objective.  Coordination  will  primarily 
need  to  be  ensured  at  the  village  level  with  the  Posyandu  (village  maternal  and  child  health 
posts) and the health volunteers. 
419.  For integrated homestead gardening for nutrition, the recent IFAD How To Do Note on the 
subject provides a useful reference. 
II.  Component 2: Services, Inputs and Market Linkages  
420.  Component  2  deals  with  the  key  service  delivery  system  and  market  linkages  at  the  district 
level, and the associated systems at higher levels. These cover critical cross cutting services of 
agricultural extension and final services as well as more specific services linked to the flagship 
commodities of rice (seed) and cocoa. The key services are: 
2.1 Agricultural extension services (all districts) 
2.2 Financial services (all districts) 
2.3 Seed supply markets and system (all districts) 
2.4 Cocoa farmer support services and markets (in Sulawesi) 
2.5 Livestock production and health services (in NTT only before MTR) 
421.  This is an area of increased focus under READ SI and is intended to improve the performance 
and  service  delivery  of  these  key  services  in  a  more  sustainable  way.  It  is  a  compliment  to 
Component 1 and not a driver. It represents only around 19% of total programme budget and 
within  this  more  than  80%  will  be  invested  in  upgrading  extension  services,  both  for  general 
extension  (Sub-component  2.1)  as  well  as  specifically  for  cocoa  (Sub-component  2.4). These 
service  and  input  market  activities  are  organized  into  a  distinct  component  as  the  sphere  of 
intervention  is at the  district/provincial/national level and the  interventions  are  very different in 
nature  from  those  under  Component  1,  although  will  have  a  direct  impact  on  activities  in 
support  of  Component  1  activities.  Specific  intervention  plans  and  impact  logics  have  been 
defined for the interventions in each of these five support service markets as outlined below.

2.1 Agricultural Extension Services 
423.  To  support  and  deliver  the  extension  activities  under  Comp  1  and  also  improve  the  overall 
agricultural  extension  and  HR  development  capacity  in  MoA,  READ  SI  will  implement  an 
upgrading  programme  for  extension  services  in  programme  districts,  upgrading  skills  and 
96 
Republic of Indonesia 
Rural Empowerment and Agricultural Development Programme Scaling-up Initiative (READ SI) 
Final programme design report 
Appendix 4:  Detailed programme description 
extension facilities. There will also be investment in the overall extension and HR development 
system coordinated by AAEHRD under its mandate within MoA, including linked to its  national 
agriculture training centres (ATCs) as well as provincial agriculture training centres that exist in 
programme provinces with focus on making national and provincial ATC training more relevant 
to PPL (and therefore farmer) needs.  Major activities will include: 
(i) 
HR development - Skills, knowledge and training 
i. 
ii. 
iii. 
Extension officer (PPL) recruitment, skills training and refresher 
Farmer extension materials review, improvement and production – all crops. (ATC) 
Review and revision of ATC extension training - relevance and accessibility 
(ii) 
Facilities upgrading 
i. 
ii. 
Sub-district extension offices upgrade 
ATC facilities upgrade – linked to performance in (a) (iii) above. 
424.  The Agriculture  Extension  and  Human  Resources  Division  (AAEHRD)  of  MOA  is  the  agency 
with overall responsibility for both extension delivery, as well as being the READ SI NPMO.  
Main Investment Activities 
Activity 1: Recruitment and Training of New and Existing Extension Staff 
425.  Recruitment  of  additional  contract  extension  staff.  These  staff  will  be  recruited  to  ensure  that 
there  is  sufficient  extension  staff  to  field  one  PPL  per  target  village.  Because  there  are 
vacancies in a number of sub-district extension ranks, the current PPL staffing status will need 
to be mapped to establish the additional staffing needs. It should be noted that these staff are 
recruited for the purpose of implementing the programme extension related activities  – mainly 
delivered  to  target  beneficiaries  through  Farmer  Field  Schools  (FFS).  If  on-going  extension 
services  are  to  be  sustained,  GOI  will  need  to  consider  provide  financial  resources  to  ensure 
sufficient  extension  staff  continue  to  be  employed  beyond  the  programme  and  consider 
investing financial resources to train and support lead farmers at village level. 
426.  During  the  FFS  process,  PPL  staff  will  identify  lead  farmers  who  are  potential  candidates  to 
continue  working  with  the  FFS  groups  and  to  extend  the  technology  to  non-target  farmers 
(farmer to farmer extension).  
427.  Training of existing and new extension staff. Existing and new extension staff will be trained/re-
trained  to  ensure  they  are  equipped  with  both  technical  and  extension  skills  of  a  sufficient 
standard  to  deliver  the  planned  technical  support  programme  to  farmers.  This  will  include 
aspects  of  SM  (see  para   278)  delivered  by  the  specialist  implementing  partner  for  SM.  In 
addition to the PPL training under Sub-component 2.1, there will be a significant investment in 
training  PPLs  and  others  in  advanced  cocoa  production  at  the  MARS  Cocoa  Academy  in 
Terenge under the PPP with MARS (see sub-component 2.4) 
Activity 2: Review the relevance of and accessibility to PPL training at ATCs. 
428.  Feedback from provincial and district extension managers as well as PPLs themselves clearly 
indicates that training currently on offer is interesting but of little relevance to the daily extension 
challenges and needs of PPLs – training is too classroom oriented, lacks flexibility to respond to 
different  locations  (including  agro  ecological  zones,  gender  and  literacy).  ATCs  at  Makassar 
and  Kupang  will  be  assisted  and  encouraged  to  review  their  training  products  and  be  more 
responsive to active feedback from their “clients” – the extension officers. In addition, access to 
ATC  training  is  currently  extremely  limited.  READ  SI  will  work  with  ATCs  to  endeavour  to 
broaden access to training, including possible introduction of short courses on location (district 
based) and distance learning.

Rural Empowerment and Agricultural Development Programme Scaling-up Initiative (READ SI) 
Final programme design report 
Appendix 4:  Detailed programme description 
Activity 3:  Review and update all existing relevant technical packages used by extension staff 
(PPL). 
429.  Provincial and district extension staff admit that farmers are not adopting some technical advice 
because  “they  are  unable  to  understand  the  message”.  Clearly,  it  is  not  the  farmer  who  must 
adjust but the extension packages need to be made appropriate to farmer absorptive capacity, 
including  literacy  and  numeracy  levels.  Thus,  in  partnership  with  ATC  staff  and  provincial 
Bakorluh, AAEHRD staff will be required to assemble existing packages and revise them to be 
more  farmer-friendly,  and  more  likely  to  be  widely  adopted.  The  packages  of  relevance  will 
include matters relating to rice, cacao, copra, livestock and vegetable production. 
430. 
Implementation:    To  ensure  adaptability  to  local  conditions,  revision  of  existing  technical 
packages will be undertaken at provincial level. Most improved farmer extension materials will 
be in written form but potentially also available on-line at a programme website. The review will 
be undertaken with AAEHRD staff guidance with support from programme Technical Assistance 
– including an international training specialist in collaboration with ATC staff from Kupang and 
Makassar. 
Activity 4: Extension training review and revision. 
431.  Extension skills are the skills needed for a sub-district (BP3K) level PPL to confidently work with 
farmers  to  transfer  knowledge  and  to  encourage  them  to  adopt  new  techniques  or  grow 
diversified  crops  on  their  own  farm.  It  is  different  from  technical  skills  but  equally  important  in 
ensuring good extension outcomes.  Extension skills training will include extension programme 
management skills – activity planning, budgeting and scheduling, reporting and monitoring. 
432.  To ensure extension training is relevant, the training/re-training of staff will be based on revised 
staff  training  courses  that  address  the  technical  aspects  of  READ  SI  agriculture  and  the 
extension skills needed by all PPL staff.  
433. 
Implementation:  Revision  of  staff  training  modules  will  be  supported  by  the  recruitment  of  an 
international agricultural training specialist who will work with AAEHRD staff and with the senior 
staff at the national and provincial Agricultural Training Centres (ATCs) to prepare revised PPL 
training curricula for ATCs. 
434.  Once training modules are revised, training courses for existing staff (subject to mapping) will 
be delivered at the agriculture training centre (ATC) of AAEHRD in Makassar. Course duration 
will  be  for  2  weeks  and  delivered  in  batches  of  20  PPL  per  group  –  a  total  of  108  courses. 
Courses  will  be  delivered  according  to  the  recruitment  schedule  for  new  PPLs.  At  course 
completion, all trainees will be measured to ensure the required standards are met.  
Activity 5: Facilities Upgrading  
435. 
It  is  proposed  to  invest  in  the  upgrade  of  BP3K  offices  and  office  equipment  in  up  to  1064 
programme  sub-districts.    Specific  selections  will  be  based  on  a  mapping  and  needs 
assessment to be undertaken by the Provincial Director of Extension. The programme will also 
address  the  need  for  investment  in  the  national  agriculture  training  centres  (ATC)  at  Kupang 
and Makassar, including the need to finance the development of a vocational training course for 
farm machinery operation and maintenance at the ATC in Makassar and a livestock production 
course  at  Kupang.  However,  the  investments  in  both ATCs  will  be  conditional  on  agreement 
from ATCs to review PPL training effectiveness and accessibility.   
2.2 Financial services 
Context 
436. 
In  recent  years,  the  presence  of  banks  and  access  to  banking  services  have  remarkably 
increased  and  the  number  and  type  of  new  bank  outlets  or  bank  access  points  continues  to 
increase. Most of the about 7,000 sub-district centers - also in rural areas - are served by a BRI 
98 
Republic of Indonesia 
Rural Empowerment and Agricultural Development Programme Scaling-up Initiative (READ SI) 
Final programme design report 
Appendix 4:  Detailed programme description 
Unit and often also by a BPD outlet, which offers some basic competition. Meanwhile the total 
number  of  outlets  of  BRI  increased  to  beyond  10,000  (branches,  sub-branches,  units,  “teras” 
offices) and more than 50,000 BRI-Link agents (branchless banking) and reached even beyond 
sub-district  capitals.  Banks  access  remote  villages  also  with  weekly  services  at  market  days 
using mobile bank units.  
437.  However, presently, the situation may not yet be as favourable in all sub-districts in the country, 
especially in poorer areas, which are the main targets for READ SI. Small villages (population 
below 500) have no market days and often not a business that would be acceptable to act as 
bank  agent.  The  introduction  of  DFS  will  start  to  close  gaps  in  the  provision  of  financial 
mainstream services in rural areas but such services have only begun to be introduced over the 
last two years and are still hampered by incomplete mobile phone accessibility, in particular in 
low populated border areas. 
438.  Several suitable banks offer their facilities or have even expressed interest in becoming READ 
SI partner banks including the following main micro loan providing institutions: 
(i) 
(ii) 
Bank  Rakyat  Indonesia  (BRI)  is  the  main  distributor  of  the  government’s  subsidized 
People’s  Business  Loan  programme  (Kredit  Usaha  Rakyat,  KUR30).  BRI’s  standard 
product  for  micro  enterprises  is  “Kupedes”  (Kredit  Umum  Pedesaan,  Rural  General 
Loan),  a  monthly  instalment  loan.  The  interest  rate  is  about  26%  effective  p.a.  
According  to  preliminary  figures  for  2016,  BRI  will  provide  KUR  Micro  loans  up  to 
Rp25  million  to  about  four  million  micro  enterprises  including  farms.  The  loan  is 
characterized  by  highly  subsidized  market  interest  rates  (9  percent  p.a.)  and  by 
lenient  collateral  requirements.  The  repayment  to  banks  is  backed  up  with  a  partial 
credit guarantee (80% for loans to agriculture). 
Regularly,  Regional  Development  Banks  (Bank  Pembangunan  Daerah,  BPD)  are 
jointly  owned  by  the  provinces  and  districts  and  headquartered  in  the  respective 
provincial  capitals.31  BPDs  appear  as  suitable  and  interested  partners  as  their 
statutory task is to support the local economy. Like all Commercial Banks, BPDs have 
to  increase  their  MSME  loan  portfolio  to  20%  until  2018.32  For  several  of  these 
institutions this is still a challenge. BPDs are supported by a program launched by the 
German  Savings  Banks  Foundation  for  International  Cooperation  (SBFIC)  in 
cooperation  with  their  association,  Asosiasi  Bank  Pembangunan  Daerah  (Asbanda), 
and  introduce  micro  loan  assessment  tools.  The  cooperation  trains  loan  officers  to 
assess  the  cash  flow  of  project  proposals  of  MSMEs  and  offer  them  suitable  micro 
loans  (cash  flow  based  lending).  The  program  is  active  in  Sulawesi.  Several  BPDs 
became participants in the GoI’s KUR program.33 
(iii)  Most  Rural  Banks  (Bank  Perkreditan  Rakyat,  BPR)  are  smaller  than  Commercial 
Banks  and  their  product  range  is  limited  to  taking  savings  and  term  deposits  and 
extending loans. Several BPRs and cooperatives are associated with their apex bank, 
Bank  Andara,  a  Commercial  Bank  specialized  on  the  technical,  managerial  and 
financial support of microfinance institutions. Bank Andara does not offer KUR loans. 
In  fact,  few  BPRs  act  as  KUR  linkage  institutions.  BI  supported  BPDs  to  engage  as 
apex institutions for BPRs in their province, however, with mixed success. 
439.  With  few  exceptions,  BRI  dominates  the  financial  market  in  rural  areas  and  cooperation  with 
other  banks  will  be  promoted  in  order  to  prevent  dependence  on  one  supplier  and  to  offer 
choices.  
30 For more details about KUR see Annex. 
31 Some provinces were split and their BPDs serve now two provinces, for example, the BPD in Manado, North 
Sulawesi, serves also the new province Gorontalo; a small number of BPDs offered shares to private investors.  
32 BI Regulation 14/22/PBI/2012 and changes according to BI Regulation 17/12/PBI/2015 (June 2015) 
33 Including BPD NTT (Nusa Tenggara Timur), BPD Kalbar (West Kalimantan), BPD Sulselbar (West and South 
Sulawesi).

440.  These banks perceive the  market opportunity  of offering their services to increasingly market-
oriented  and  bankable  smallholder  clients  that  will  already  be  receiving  a  bundle  of  technical 
support  under  the  other  Components  of  READ  SI,  thus  greatly  reducing  the  transaction  cost 
and  lending  risk  of  serving  such  potential  clients.  The  programme  will  also  facilitate  the 
provision  of  additional  liquidity  by  selected  partner  banks  to  newly  registered  or  strengthened 
MFI or cooperative licensed34 community-based financial organizations (CBFOs, among others 
54  so  called  LKM-A  recorded  in  Sulawesi).  The  MFIs,  as  “Linkage  Institutions”,  address  the 
needs of their members by forwarding funds from banks either directly (executing scheme) or 
by  facilitating  loan  contracts  with  a  bank  (channeling  scheme).  OJK  and  GoI  promote  these 
linkage  models,  which  are  also  described  in  the  KUR  regulations  as  one  method  to  provide 
inexpensive  finance  for  MSMEs  and  thus  is  an  established  (though  sometimes  underused) 
existing product/funding mechanism for the major banks.35

Indonesian financial sector and are no longer generic terms. A brief summary is included here 
and these terms are used throughout this PDR. 
MFI is a specific term in Indonesia defined under the Law 1/2013 on MFI. It is not anymore a generic 
term.  
FSP is a general term and includes banks and non-bank financial institutions, OJK-registered and not 
registered. 
OJK-registered institutions 
  Banks includes (a) Commercial Banks (CB) and (b) Rural Banks (BPR) according to Law on 
Banking. 
  Non-bank financial institutions based on national Laws include, (list not complete) 
a  Multi-finance companies, including leasing companies 
b  Special purpose financing institutions or funds, such as Permodalan Nasional Madani  
c 
Insurance companies 
34 OJK is also responsible for regulation of MFIs and for supporting and encouraging CBFOs and informal financial 
activities to register as MFIs according to Law No.1/2013. 
35 KUR procedures describe the two types of linkage: (1) channeling, i.e. the bank concludes individual loan contracts 
with MFI members and the MFI assists the bank to identify borrowers and to collect installments, and (2) executing, i.e. 
the MFI becomes the bank’s debtor and the end user is the MFI’s debtor. Banks will conclude a loan contract only with 
OJK-registered MFIs or registered cooperatives. 
36 Definition: Borrower with loan classified “pass” and “substandard”. 
37 In particular, if a land certificate is involved as collateral, banks will conclude loan agreements with husband and wife.

e  MFI,  which  are  institutions  providing  deposit  and  loan  services,  registered  (a)  as  limited 
liability  company  (Ltd/PT)  or    (b)  cooperatives    according  to  Law  on  MFI;  before 
registering, these institutions are CBFOs (one might differentiate MFI as term from “small 
financial  institution”,  which  would  need  a  specific  definition,  e.g.  based  on  total  assets, 
which includes MFIs and small CBFOs?) 
Not OJK-registered financial institutions are 
Community-Based Financial Organization (CBFO), in this context are not registered with OJK,  
(a)  those  that  should  apply  for  a  legal  status  as  Ltd/PT  or  cooperative,  but  have  not  yet,  including 
those that operate based on provincial regulation or on a government programme or project regulation 
(in particular those that promote voluntary savings activities),  
(b) those that are too small to fall under the Law on MFIs38  
(c) non-deposit taking (revolving) funds (monthly compulsory savings of members are not regarded as 
a deposit-taking activity) that have also developed from governments providing “revolving funds” (e.g., 
Gapoktan). As some of these institutions were designed to become a “village bank”, voluntary deposit 
activities were encouraged and sometimes introduced. 
CBFOs differ from SCGs (see below) in that they have been founded and capitalized with government 
involvement  (capitalization,  regulation,  supervision,  etc.).  They  are  community  based  but  they  are 
credit-led in contrast to community founded as savings-driven SCGs. 
Not regarded as FSPs under this definition – but part of the financial infrastructure - are 
a  neighbourhood savings and credit groups (SCGs) or self-help groups (SHGs)  
b  arisan groups  
c  money lenders 
Suppliers  of  goods  and  off-takers,  who  buy  the  harvest  before  the  time  of  harvesting  (ijon)  engage 
also in financing but are not regarded as FSPs,  because they conclude a sales/purchase contract in 
which the time of payment differs with the time of handing over the goods or performing the services. 
The  financing  activity  is  regarded  as  a  marketing  instrument  for  their  main  business,  which  is  not 
financing.  
Main Investment Activities 
Activity 1: Financial Services Baseline Surveys 
444.  Baseline surveys are required of the local financial services sector, in particular concerning the 
institutions,  their  outlets  and  other  access  points  in  READ  SI  districts  that  READ  SI 
interventions can build on and support what is already happening in the financial service sector 
locally. Among these institutions are Commercial Banks and Rural Banks, their different outlets 
or  access  points  such  as  mobile  banking  units  and  agents,  as  well  as  OJK-approved  MFIs. 
Further  institutions  are  non-bank  financial  institutions,  both  formal  and  informal  institutions.  
including  pawnshops  and  single  purpose  savings  and  credit  cooperatives  (SCCs)  in  relevant 
sub-districts, and informal institutions and funds on programme village level.  
445.  Accordingly. the initial tasks of the District Finance Advisors (DFA) in their respective districts, 
backstopped by the Provincial Finance Advisors (PFA), will be to map all active FSPs and their 
outreach and their products including: 
Banks 
(i) 
the  location  of  their  outlets  and  agents  (Digital  Financial  Services  -  DFS  points),  as 
well as the locations that the banks  visit regularly with mobile units  
38 Minimum capital for PT MFI (limited liability companies) is Rp 50 million, for cooperatives Rp 15 million.

financial intermediation models 
(v)

MFIs and CBFOs 
(vi) 
establish a list of existing  MFIs and CBFOs, in programme villages and sub-districts 
both  those    set  up  by  government  initiatives  (Gapoktan,  LKM-As,  PNPM,  District 
Development Project, IDT, to name a few) or from other parties (e.g. NGOs). This list 
shall  include  also  single  purpose  SCCs  and  multipurpose  cooperatives  with  savings 
and credit activities. 
(vii)  compile  information  of  the  legal  and  economic  status  of  these  MFIs  and  CBFOs, 
including the profile of the members or clients of these organizations, especially those 
in READ SI villages. 
(viii)  The  data  compilation  will  be  done  with  the  support  of  the  VFs  and  teams  of  the 
special implementing partner for SM in the sub-districts. 
Other non-bank financial institutions 
(ix)  The  baseline  survey  will  also  look  at  products  of  institutions  such  as  pawnshops, 
leasing  or  micro-insurance  providers.  Furthermore,  the  survey  shall  indicate  the  use 
of non-formal savings and loan activities of input providers and off-takers. 
446.  A  special  investigation  shall  be  led  by  the  National  Financial  Advisor  (NFA)  of  the  NPMO 
together with the MoA Dept of Agricultural Finance to identify the micro insurance alternatives 
that  are  available  in  Indonesia  and  the  possibilities  and  obstacles  to  introduce  them  in  all 
programme  provinces.  In  addition  READ  SI  will  support  DAF  to  extend  its  scheme  to  insure 
agriculture  activities  to  more  provinces  and  more  commodities  and  whether  hesitant  insurers 
might cooperate in testing markets and products, perhaps with their CSR funds.  
Activity 2: Partnerships with banks 
447. 
Informed  by  the  baseline  surveys  of  the  local  financial  services  sectors,  the  programme  will 
seek to establish partnerships with banks  that have the most dominant presence in rural areas 
in  which  READ  SI  is  active,  namely  BRI,  BPDs  and  in  some  selected  areas  with  BPRs  that 
have established a dense net of outlets  
448.  These  partnerships  are  necessary,  because  the  programme  will  intervene  as  a  facilitator 
between the farmers and the banks. In each location, READ SI will collaborate with the partner 
banks to extend their existing schemes and services to the programme's target farmers.  
449.  This bridge is required because banks offer standard products, which might need some slight, 
but  sometimes  decisive  adjustments  to  be  acceptable  for  the  borrowers.  The  programme  will 
therefore  have  to  develop  a  trusted  relationship  with  decision  makers  on  local  level  that 
necessarily  has  to  be  backed  by  bank  superiors  at  the  higher  levels.  It  is  not  envisaged  that 
READ SI should demand from banks a general new policy. For example, banks do not normally 
provide  loans  below  Rp  5  million  and  also  micro  loans  with  terms  of  four  years.  However,  in 
their product descriptions they offer these products and the  programme may convince them to 
provide  them.  Similarly,  incorporating  interest  as  an  investment  cost  item  in  the  loan  amount 
(interest during construction, IDC) is not common, but some banks use this feature already for 
financing  plantation  development.  The  schemes  under  which  banks  provide  loans  to  farm 
102 
Republic of Indonesia 
Rural Empowerment and Agricultural Development Programme Scaling-up Initiative (READ SI) 
Final programme design report 
Appendix 4:  Detailed programme description 
households,  formerly  under  the  interest  subsidized  Food  and  Energy39  Security  Loan  (Kredit 
Ketahanan  Pangan  &  Energi,  KKPE)  program  with  maximum  loan  amounts  of  Rp50  million40 
may not have allowed this flexibility. In contrast, under the present KUR program, banks could 
extend  these  more  flexible  and  individual  loans  that  are  required  for  example  for  tree  crop 
financing.  Often,  it  is  not  profitable  for  a  bank  to  engage  in  these  activities  unless  a  large 
number of same or similar loan applications are submitted (mass loan processing). Hence, one 
of  the  entry  points  for  READ  SI  is  to  broker  arrangements  with  interested  banks  and  larger 
numbers of like-minded farmers to aggregate demand for similar financial products to make it of 
greater commercial interest for banks to serve this demand. 
450.  The programme will, through detailed negotiation, be open to providing support to the partner 
banks  to  develop,  pilot  and  extend  their  existing  products  and  schemes  to  better  serve  the 
target  households  -  either  by  expanding  geographical  coverage  into  new  locations  or 
developing and testing adapted products that more specifically meet the identified needs of the 
farm households e.g. credit products for season finance (for rice) versus more regular income 
(from vegetables). 
451.  Through these partnerships, READ SI will also seek to better understand the particular factors 
faced  by  local  credit  officers  and  branches  that  have  held  them  back  in  increased  lending  to 
farmers and other rural households in the past. This may be factors such as weak governance 
within  older  co-operatives  or  marketing  or  production  constraints  such  as  a  lack  of  technical 
knowledge and quality inputs for farmers that limit their  yields and margins and hence reduce 
their likely ability to repay loans. One of the benefits of such a partnership would be a one- or 
two-month internship of the DFAs with banks handling micro loans in rural areas. 
452.  With  a  better  understanding  of  these  non-financial  constraints,  READ  SI  can  tailor  its 
interventions to address these and thereby increase the confidence and willingness of banks to 
serve target households. This process of identifying and addressing non-financial barriers is not 
a one off exercise, but rather an iterative process in which issues are jointly identified between 
the banks, farmers and the programme and then joint actions planned to tackle them with the 
regular review  of progress  and updating of joint  action plans.  Within these joint action  plans, 
responsibility  for  some  tasks  will  fall  to  the  partner  banks,  some  to  the  farmers  and  farmers 
groups, some to the local MFIs or CBFOs and some to the READ SI implementation teams or 
other programme stakeholders, e.g., Village Head (Kepala Desa), Sub-District Head (Camat) or 
District Head/Regent (Bupati). 
453.  READ  SI  will  invite  other  banks  to  join,  if  they  can  contribute  to  a  more  intense  provision  of 
service  due  to  their  specialization  in  financing  a  particular  commodity  (here  most  probably 
cocoa) such as BNI or Bank Mandiri, which are experienced in tree crop financing. These few 
institutions can collectively best cover almost all programme locations and different segments of 
customers (e.g. from active poor to better off individuals as well as registered cooperatives and 
MFIs)  of  the  programme  in  particular  as  some  of  these  banks  are  actively  expanding  their 
branchless banking activities.  
454.  At  the  village  level,  a  critical  aspect  of  most  partnerships  is  expected  to  be  that  partner  bank 
staff,  such  as  local  branch  lending  officers,  attend  various  activities  and  meetings  of 
participating  farmers  in  the  village  facilitated  by  the  VFs  in  order  to  achieve  delivering  an 
appropriate and affordable portfolio of financial services that meet the different financial needs 
of smallholder families over time. This would include, for example: 
(i) 
delivering one or more of the sessions of the financial literacy training, particularly 
those on bank products, the roles of savings versus loans etc. (see Sub-component 
1.3); 
39 This refers to palm oil and soy beans oil being used to substitute diesel fuel  
40 Banks are allowed to disburse micro loans up to Rp50 million without requesting the borrower’s tax number.  
103

(ii) 
(iii) 
attending half a day of each farmer field school (see Sub-component 1.2) to introduce 
their services to the farmers and also to better understand the training and support 
being provided via the programme as well as the farming investments plans and 
financial needs of the farmers as their potential clients; 
providing support to farmers groups or individual farmers/investors in preparing 
investment or project proposals as part of loan applications for investing in equipment 
and machinery as an agricultural service enterprise, e.g. for threshers, rice driers, 
mechanized harvester or for enterprises providing fermentation boxes for cocoa.41 
455. 
It is expected that in quite a number of villages more than one bank is actively offering financial 
services  to  programme  beneficiary  households,  be  it  through  agents,  mobile  units  or  even 
permanent  outlets. This  competition  and  choice  for  farmers  is  considered  positive  and  will  be 
encouraged while paying attention to aggregate a sufficiently attractive number of farmers that 
would require the same product.  
Linkage Institution Schemes 
456.  Based on findings from the Design Mission, it is expected that registration as MFI (formalization 
of  existing  CBFOs),  including  large  savings  and  credit  groups  (SCGs),  would  open  access  to 
small  loans  (distinctly  below  Rp5  million  per  member)  from  banks  that  they  would  not 
individually provide, but to the institution (“executing scheme”). Representatives of Commercial 
Banks stated unanimously that, in general, they would avoid financing CBFOs or SCGs. They 
would  appreciate  if  the  management  of  CBFOs  or  SCGs  would  assist  the  bank  in  concluding 
individual  loan  agreements  with  the  CBFO  or  SCG  members  and  assist  in  supervision  and 
coordinating loan repayments thus reducing transaction costs. However, loans would be based 
on  individual  appraisals  and  contracts  with  the  bank  (“channelling  scheme”). The  joint  liability 
offered by the group members is not regarded as a valuable collateral substitute and neither will 
Commercial  Banks  accept  the  receivables  in  the  books  of  the  CBFOs  as  a  collateral  as  the 
instrument  “cession”  as  collateral  is  not  introduced  on  this  level.  In  this  respect,  it  might  be 
possible to identify a BPR, a savings and credit cooperative or a MFI that might extend a loan 
to a CBFO or even SCG. The BPR or MFI in turn might apply for refinancing with a bank. It is 
expected that in these cases, the total loan amount  will not exceed total savings of the group 
members and will also not exceed about Rp 1 million or Rp 2 million per member. 
Number and type of FSP partnerships 
457.  For  illustrative  purposes,  by  Year  5  of  the  programme  there  may  be  active  partnerships  with, 
perhaps: 
(i) 
One to three national-scale banks, most probably BRI, BNI and Bank Mandiri, being 
active in >75% of programme locations serving farmers both directly or indirectly via a 
linkage institution (for example BPR, cooperative or MFIs) as a means to decrease 
transaction costs to serve SCG and/or SCG members.  
(ii) 
Provincial Development Banks (BPDs) that serve farmers. It needs to be investigated 
to what extent and degree of specialization these banks are also experienced in 
linkage or group financing and if they would be interested to become financial 
provider of the members of these groups or finance local e MFIs and cooperatives..   
(iii)  One or two specialist banks or other FSPs that have particular focus and networks 
with CBFOs Sharia based savings & finance groups (BMT), for example apex banks 
and organizations working with BPRs, MFIs, and Sharia groups that may cover 
significant parts of the programme locations, e.g. Bank Andara (Andara Link) or 
Permodalan Nasional Madani (PNM), a GoI owned institution providing loans to MFIs 
41 In this respect the PRFCs shall provide input on basic data and methodology based on internet research, which offer 
more decisive details than banks consider in their assessment. For example, the economy of a power thresher is 
described into detail in http://www.academia.edu/11215564/Studi_Kelayakan_Power_Thresher_untuk_Padi

for on-lending (executing scheme) and micro loans to end users facilitated by the 
MFIs (executing scheme).  
458.  These  co-operations  might  be  based  on  a  tripartite  agreement.  For  example  BPR  Mustika 
Utama  Kolaka,  in  Kolaka,  Kolaka  District  in  Southeast  Sulawesi,  cooperates  with  PT  Bank 
Andara42  and  PT  Sulawesi  Subur  Sejahtera43  in  financing  and  guiding  cocoa  farmers  with  a 
total volume of Rp 5 billion.  
Set-up and management of FSP partnerships 
459.  Partner FSPs will be chosen in Year 1 onwards through an open invitation process and selected 
on the basis of the fit of their products and schemes with the programme objectives in terms of 
suitability of products and  schemes to the  needs of the target farmers (e.g. seasonal finance, 
savings, 
(especially 
accessibility  for  the  poorest  farmers),  financial  sustainability  of  their  schemes  without  public 
funding,  and  value  for  money  in  terms  of  the  programme's  necessary  investment  into  the 
partnership.  
insurance),  geographical  coverage,  social 
inclusion  performance 
460.  Eligible  partner  FSPs  may  be  private  or  state-owned,  regional  or  national  in  scale  but  must 
already  be  active  with  a  widespread  presence  in  at  least  one  programme  province. 
Partnerships  may  be  with  individual  FSPs  or  with  FSP-led  consortia  also  potentially  including 
other  non-FSP  added  value  consortia  partners.  It  is  expected  that  multiple  partner  FSPs  may 
be active partners within any given province or district. 
461.  FSP  Partnerships  will  be  managed  through  milestones  and  performance-based  partnership 
agreements  that  are  periodically  reviewed  and  adjusted  based  on  actually  performance  and 
future potential.  
462.  For the avoidance of doubt, READ  SI  will not  provide lines of credit for on-lending  by  partner 
banks. 
Activity 3: OJK Collaboration 
463.  Within the context of the READ SI rural finance activities, READ SI will collaborate with OJK on 
two of its important initiatives that will substantially enhance READ SI's own activities on rural 
finance, namely (i) upgrading CBFOs to register as MFIs and (ii) strengthening supervision of 
these  institutions.  This  collaboration  will  be  closely  harmonized  with  the  similar  collaboration 
with OJK envisaged under the IPDMIP programme  - the RF activities of  which  are also to be 
managed by AAEHRD. 
464.  Note that activities under the collaboration with OJK will not be double funded by READ SI and 
IPDMIP,  but  rather  the  programme  which  is  ready  to  implement  them  first  in  the  READ  SI 
districts will do so, providing funding and management support for their delivery. 
3. a) Gapoktan and LKM-A Registration and Strengthening 
465.  OJK  and  the  Ministry  of Agriculture  through  its  Directorate  of Agricultural  Finance  (under  the 
Directorate General for Agriculture Infrastructure and Means, Prasarana dan Sarana Pertanian, 
PSP) are rolling out a programme to support the application, registration and strengthening of 
the  savings  and  credit  units  (LKM-A)  of  qualifying  farmers  groups  and  farmer  group 
associations (Gapoktan).  
466.  For 2016, activities to empower and strengthen LKM-A are planned in 24 provinces, including 
North  Sulawesi  (4  LKM-A),  South  Sulawesi  (99  LKM-A),  Southeast  Sulawesi  (20  LKM-A),

Gorontalo (7 LKM-A), and West Sulawesi (20 LKM-A). Central Sulawesi is not part of the 2016 
plan.44  
467.  Presently,  OJK  has  requested  from  the  provincial  governments  data  on  the  existing  MFI 
candidates.  This  process  takes  more  time  than  initially  planned  (January  2016)  as  many 
CBFOs  are  recorded  or  registered  with  different  institutions  or  even  not  at  all. The  authorities 
find it difficult to identify savings and credit self-help groups as “MFIs based on the initiatives of 
the  local  people”  (LKM  Berbasis  Masyarakat,  LKM-BM).  It  can  also  be  assumed  that  the 
majority  of  these  CBFOs  handle  a  capital  of  less  than  Rp50  million  and  would  not  qualify  for 
registration as a PT MFI. Reservations to establish a cooperative are still widespread.  
468.  READ  SI's  Rural  Finance  team  along  with  other  field  staff  will  work  closely  with  the  local 
government  and  teams  from  OJK  and  MoA  to  identify  active  Gapoktans  and  LKM-As  and 
support them in their choice to register as cooperative or PT and qualify for government support 
and  supervision.  This  process  is  also  important  especially  for  the  poor  depositors  whose 
deposits  are  better  protected  when  the  MFIs  are  properly  supervised.  Many  of  these  persons 
contribute small monthly amounts only to reserve their right to access an emergency loan and 
they have too often lost their money when loans were not repaid 
3.b) Strengthening District level microfinance supervisory agencies by OJK 
469.  OJK strengthening of District microfinance supervisory agencies is planned to begin in 2016, in 
line with the MFI law (Undang-undang Lembaga Keuangan Mikro 1/2013).  
470.  OJK, through its province capital based offices, needs to deliver training and capacity building 
to the district agencies that are legally responsible for guiding and supervising registered MFIs, 
but  may  not  be  sufficiently  prepared  for  this  task.  More  effective  supervision  will  improve  the 
sustainability  of  CBFOs  supported  under  the  programme,  including  through  the  FSP 
partnerships and the MoA-OJK LKM-A formalization process.  
471.  READ  SI  will  therefore  support  OJK  to  implement  an  accelerated  programme  of  capacity 
improvement in this area in all programme districts (Year 1). The programme will also monitor 
the  development  of  the  CBFOs  and  support  similar  follow-up/refresher  capacity  building  in 
following years, in particular to strengthen further their supervisory performance. OJK will lead 
these activities from both a management and technical perspective. 
Activity 4:  Agricultural Insurance Promotion 
472.  READ  SI  will  partner  with  MoA's  Dept  of  Agricultural  Financed  (DAF)  in  order  to  extend  the 
coverage  and  use  of  farm  insurance  products  by  smallholders.  DAF  launched  new  farm 
insurance products for rice and livestock in October 2015. They hope to extend farm insurance 
to cover additional crops and livestock. READ SI will collaborate and support DAF to develop, 
market  test  and  promote  suitable  insurance  products.  Plans  and  activities  will  be  jointly 
developed with DAF through the AWPB preparation process. Consideration will also be given to 
the feasibility of farm insurance products for cocoa orchard replanting and rehabilitation. 
2.3 Seed Supply Markets and Systems 
473.  The  READ  SI  design  sees  this  activity  as  a  4  step  process:  (i)  breeding;  (ii)  multiplying;  (iii) 
distributing  high  quality  seed;  and  (iv)  providing  credible  assurance  to  farmers  that  the  seed 
they are using is of a consistently high standard. The programme will finance an initial supply of 
White label seed for each participating provincial PBPT agency, as well as the associated costs 
of multiplication,  distribution and certification.  
474.  This will involve 4 distinct steps:

(i) 
(ii) 
Provincial  BPTPs  will  access  either  Breeders  (F-1)  or  Foundation  (F-2)  seed  from 
MOA’s IRRC at Subang in West Java. Where necessary, IRRC breeders seed will be 
multiplied to Foundation seed at provincial BPTPs.   
Under  BPTP  supervision,  F-2  seed  will  be  provided  to  “elite”  selected  multiplier 
farmers  who  will  harvest  Stock  (F-3)  Purple  Label  seed  for  planting  by  programme 
trained multiplier farmers. BP3K extension staff will support BPTPs in this process. 
(iii)  Stock  (F-3)  Purple  Label  seed  will  be  provided  to  programme  multiplier  farmers  at 
scheme  level  who  will  harvest  Extension  (F-4)  Blue  label  seed  for  planting  by 
programme  farmers.  The  multiplication  process  will  also  be  managed  by  BPTP  and 
supported  by  BP3K  extension  staff  while  distribution  arrangements  will  be  managed 
by BPTP. 
(iv)  Rice  seed  certification  process.  After  a  review  of  BPTP  Certification  processes  and 
standards, it is proposed that samples of all (F-2, F-3 and F-4) seed will be subject to 
GOI seed certification according to MOA regulations – including 3 field inspections (2 
at vegetative growth stage, and one pre-harvest) followed by germination testing at a 
MOA approved laboratory. However, to assure programme managers of the integrity 
of this process, random samples of seed will be independently verified by grade and 
certified  to  minimum  standards  of  90%  purity/90%  germination  and  compared  to 
BPTP/MOA test results. Only once seed has been tested and verified can the relevant 
label  be  applied.  This  service  will  operate  as  a  fee  based  service,  paid  for  by  the 
grower of the sample being tested.  
475.  However, after the initial injection of quality seed at  programme expense, Programme farmers 
will be expected to purchase F-4 extension grade seed from the multiplier farmers who will in 
turn purchase F-3 grade purple seed from either elite multiplier farmers or from Provincial BPTP 
– thus ensuring sufficient and reliable supply as well as financial sustainability.   
476.  Technical  support  to  selected  multiplier  farmers  in  each  province.  With  BPTP,  BP3K  level 
extension  staff  and  Dinas  Pertanian  will  work  with  qualified,  certified  multiplier  farmers  in 
province to train them to multiply  the stock (F-3) purple seed to extension (F-4) blue seed for 
distribution to individual scheme farmers. In addition, this process will be preceded by multiplier 
farmers  attending  live-in  training  courses  at  BPTP  provincial  level.  Initially,  this  multiplication 
process will be on a contract basis but after each farmer receives an initial grant of wet and dry 
season new seed, multiplier farmers across the programme (around 4 farmers per province) will 
purchase  the purple F-3 seed and  then sell blue F-4 seed to farmers (i.e. as a private sector 
activity) within the rehabilitated irrigated areas. Selection of multiplier farmers could be linked to 
the proposed incentives rewards to best performing farmers as identified by the PPL extension 
staff. 
477.  On-farm rice seed storage. Because farmers should typically re-use their own self-stored seed 
for two seasons before buying fresh seed every third season, they need to be able to store their 
seed in good conditions. Poorly stored rice seed undergoes significant germination losses, the 
programme will seek to ensure each target farmer can maintain seed quality by storing seed in 
an  air  tight,  vermin  proof  container  (hermetic  storage).  The  programme  will  provide  some  air 
tight,  200L  heavy  plastic  drums  for  hermetic  storage  as  part  of  the  rice  FFS  starter-package. 
however, to ensure more widespread availability and use of such drums (or similar)  READ SI 
will work with local agricultural input retailers to stock the air tight storage drums. The impact of 
quality  storage,  in  conjunction  with  proper  drying  (not  greater  than14%  moisture),  will 
significantly  increases  in  seed  germination  rates  (currently  60%  to  around  85%),  in  turn 
reducing  crop  seed  requirements.  This  means  that  if  the  200L  drums  are  filled  with  properly 
dried and stored seed, the USD25 cost of each drum will be recovered in just one seasons from 
the reduced amount of seed needed to be stored due to the higher germination rates and  the 
drums will last for many years if properly cared for.

2.4 Cocoa farmer support services and markets 
478.  The  ultimate  objective  is  to  substantially  raise  cocoa  farm  incomes  for  very  large  numbers  of 
cocoa  farmers,  especially  in  Sulawesi,  making  cocoa  farming  an  attractive  profession  once 
again  for  small  farmers  and  thereby  moving  the  cocoa  sector  to  a  more  competitive  and 
sustainable footing.  
479. 
In line with this, the overall objective of the sub-component is to substantially improve the cocoa 
support  service  markets  in  programme  district  so  that  cocoa  farmers  can  readily  access 
affordable good quality advice and inputs to upgrade their cocoa production without relying on 
government  handouts.  This  should  be  achieved  through  four  specific  complementary 
objectives: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
strengthening and expanding the coverage of embedded service delivered within the 
supply chains;  
developing high quality, affordable private service providers, including private 
nurseries; 
significantly expanding the cadre of private and public extension professionals who 
have advanced cocoa production and farm business knowledge and expertise so that 
this is far more widely available within cocoa communities; 
strengthening the role and capacity of District Estate Crops Dinas to backstop, mentor 
and nurture these private providers while not undermining them with free giveaways 
of inputs or advice which are unsustainable. 
Public services and support to cocoa farmers 
480.  An  important  context  to  the  service  and  input  market  for  cocoa  is  the  long  running  Cocoa 
National  Movement  Program  (Gernas)  of  the  Estate  Crops  Director  General  of  MoA. With  an 
annual  budget  of  Rp1  trillion  (USD76.9  million),  GERNAS  has  distributed  fertilizer  and 
seedlings  to  a  high  percentage  of  cocoa  farmers  in  Indonesia  aimed  at  boosting  productivity. 
Yet despite this, total cocoa production has continued to fall dramatically, having almost halved 
in  the  last  7  years  according  to  industry  estimates.  The  side  effect  of  GERNAS'  generous 
handouts  has  been  to  hold  back  the  development  of  more  sustainable  service  and  input 
markets  for  cocoa.  There  have  also  been  widely  acknowledged  technical  issues  with  some 
aspects  of  Gernas,  especially  relating  to  the  fertilizer  and  the  survival  rate  /  quality  of  the 
seedlings. 
481.  More  recently,  in  2016  the  budget  for  GERNAS  was  dramatically  cut  by  >75%  to  only  Rp235 
billion  (USD18  million)  at  a  time  when  overall  MoA  budgets  are  increasing.  This  potentially 
implies a very different role and strategy emerging for MOA support to the cocoa sector. READ 
SI  will  therefore  be  open  to  collaborating  with  DG  Estate  Crops  in  MoA  and  the  Estate  Crop 
Dinas in the programme districts in support of this shift in direction, especially where it concerns 
development of more sustainable services and input markets for cocoa farmers.   
Public private partnerships (PPP) in support of cocoa farmers 
482. 
In  support  of  the  sub-component  objectives,  READ  SI  will  expand  on  the  PPP  initiated  under 
READ.  Two  PPPs  for  READ  SI  are  currently  being  negotiated  with  two  of  the  three  leading 
chocolate  makers,  MARS  Cocoa  and  Mondelez,  who  are  at  the  top  of  the  value  chain  in 
Indonesia.  READ  SI  will  be  open  to  exploring  a  third  PPP  with  the  other  leading  chocolate 
maker, Nestle, if there  is  interest from both sides  and a suitable partnership can be designed 
that is consistent with a shared set of common objectives.  
483.  Each  of  the  PPPs  will  be  individually  designed,  negotiated  and  managed  and  is  expected  to 
primarily focus in the Districts relevant to the partner firms supply chains. As such the activities 
and approach to cocoa service market development may be different from District to District.

Appendix 4:  Detailed programme description 
484.  The expected scope and status of the proposed PPPs with each of MARS cocoa and Mondelez 
are briefly summarized in the two partnership framework notes below. Ongoing discussions and 
negotiations are happening on both PPPs and it is hoped that these will be concluded in early 
2017  and  that  the  details  of  the  PPP  can  be  included  in  the  READ  SI  programme 
documentation prior to negotiation of the financing agreement between GoI and IFAD.  
MARS Cocoa - READ SI Partnership Framework (draft outline) 
Background and context 
485.  Under  READ,  MARS  Cocoa  and  the  project  had  a  successful  first  partnership  focussed  on 
MARS'  model  of  Cocoa  Development  Centre  (CDC)  and  Cocoa  Village  Centres  (CVCs)  / 
Cocoa  Doctors  (CD)  for  the  delivery  of  improved  cocoa  production  training  and  support  to 
cocoa farms in READ districts in Central Sulawesi. Under READ SI, there is a desire from both 
partners to broaden and deepen the partnership. 
486.  This first partnership demonstrated the potential to raise cocoa productivity and farm incomes 
through  a  system  of  farmer  training  and  support  delivered  by  local  private  service  providers 
(CVCs/CDs) that are themselves trained and supported by more specialist Cocoa Development 
Centres located in the cocoa producing areas. The model of CDC and Cocoa Doctors has been 
used  by  MARS  in  its  own  main  direct  sourcing  locations  in  South  Sulawesi.  Under  READ,  in 
Central Sulawesi the CDCs and staff were set-up and trained by MARS in line with their model. 
The partnership with READ was a first attempt to apply this model in locations outside MARS 
direct sourcing areas. From a technical perspective, the partnership achieved good results. For 
example, the READ Project Completion Report found that READ cocoa farmers achieved 193% 
higher  yields  than  non-READ  farmers.    However,  the  limitation  to  date  has  been  the  financial 
sustainability of the CDCs themselves which are a vital part of the system. 
487.  The  first  partnership,  especially  the  results  achieved  by  farmers,  also  reinforced  the  value  of 
MARS'  widely  acknowledged  "industry  leading"  technical  expertise  in  practical  cocoa  farming 
systems and cocoa business aspects well suited to small cocoa farmers in Sulawesi. Much of 
this  expertise  is  generated  and  disseminated  via  MARS'  Cocoa  Academy  in  Tarrenge,  East 
Luwu District, South Sulawesi. The expanded partnership under READ SI will therefore seek to 
make  better  use  of  this  valuable  asset  to  raise  the  capacity  of  larger  numbers  of  public  and 
private cocoa extension professionals. 
488. 
It is also noted that recent changes to the organization of District and Provincial level agencies 
means that there is now one integrated Dinas responsible for agriculture, estate crops, farmer 
extension  and  related  activities.  This  should  enable  better  local  coordination  and  it  will  be 
important  that  the  next  phase  of  the  partnership  continues  to  strengthen  strong  local 
coordination between the implementation teams of MARS and READ SI. 
Scope of next phase 
489.  The new phase of the partnership is therefore expected to have four main pillars: 
(i) 
Human resource development for advanced cocoa production and business expertise 
for larger numbers of public and private sector cocoa professionals in Sulawesi. This 
is expected to have two elements: 
i. 
ii. 
direct professional training of PPLs, lead farmers and others at the MARS Cocoa 
Academy; 
development and roll-out of improved cocoa production and business courses at 
technical and vocational education training (TVET) centres and Agricultural 
Training Centres (ATCs) in Sulawesi guided by MARS Cocoa Academy expertise; 
(ii) 
Piloting of improved business models for sustainable operation of the CDC’s 
established in Central Sulawesi under READ, especially for financial sustainability;  
109 
Republic of Indonesia 
Rural Empowerment and Agricultural Development Programme Scaling-up Initiative (READ SI) 
Final programme design report 
Appendix 4:  Detailed programme description 
(iii) 
e-Cocoa training and advisory system development; 
(iv)  Accelerated cross-learning between MARS and READ SI field approaches, through 
READ SI working in selected districts in South Sulawesi co-located with MARS' own 
managed CDCs and cocoa sourcing operations. 
490. 
In  addition  to  these  four  main  pillars  of  the  partnership,  both  READ  SI  and  MARS  share  a 
common  interest  to  explore  and  pilot  innovative  cocoa  financing  schemes  to  support  orchard 
rehabilitation  and/or  replanting.  It  is  recognized  by  MARS  and  READ  SI  that  financing  for 
farmers to rehabilitate their aging orchards is vital to rejuvenating the cocoa industry in much of 
Sulawesi. However, it is also recognized that it is a complex problem due to the timescales and 
amounts  of  financing  required  by  a  typical  small  farmer.  While  the  problems  are  substantial, 
both READ SI and MARS are keen to collaborate to see if they can begin to make progress in 
this area. At present, no immediate opportunities have  yet been identified but both parties will 
continue to investigate this with a view to jointly piloting activities if suitable opportunities arise.   
491.  The four main pillars are briefly described in Table 1 below and are expected to form the basis 
of  a  formal  partnership  agreement  between  MoA  and  MARS  to  be  signed  prior  to  the  start  of 
READ  SI.  For  each  pillar,  the  table  identifies  the  main  activities,  critical  success  factors, 
responsibilities of each partner as well as the cost sharing basis. 
Key Performance Indicators 
492.  As  part  of  the  final  partnership  agreement,  Key  Performance  Indicators  should  be  clearly 
defined for each of the four pillars as the basis to manage the partnership and ensure it delivers 
the expected results. Proposed targets may include: 
(i) 
Among farmers supported by those trained at the Cocoa Academy: 
i.  Yields of cocoa beans increase by 100%; 
ii. 
at least 25,000 small farmers adopting improved cocoa production practices 
(assumes 50 farmers adopting improved practices for each of the 500 PPLs/lead 
farmers trained at the Cocoa Academy) 
(ii) 
TVET Centres and ATCs: 
i. 
Launch new/improved cocoa production and business courses in at least 5 TVET 
centres/ATC within the first 3 years of the partnership 
ii.  At least 1000 students in total complete the new/improved cocoa production and 
business courses at the participating TVET Centres and ATCs by the end of READ 
SI    
(iii)  CDC / CVC sustainable business model 
i.  At least three of the five CDC established under READ are fully financially and 
technically sustainable by the end of READ SI and able to operate without any 
ongoing external financial support. 
(iv) 
e-Cocoa training and advisory service 
i. 
ii. 
e-Cocoa service launched 
at least 5000 cocoa farmers regularly using the system or being served by service 
providers that are regularly using the e-Cocoa service 
iii. 
business model and financial sustainability of the e-Cocoa service demonstrated 
Partnership agreement 
493.  The partnership should operate under an updated single framework agreement at the national 
level  signed  between  MARS  Cocoa  and  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  supported  by  local 
110 
Republic of Indonesia

Appendix 4:  Detailed programme description 
coordination  in  the  districts  and  provinces  between  the  relevant  teams from  MARS,  READ  SI 
and the District authorities.  
494.  The updated partnership agreement should specify: 
(i) 
(ii) 
Key performance indicators and expected results for each of the main activities  
Arrangements and procedures for monitoring and supervision of the activities covered 
by the partnership 
(iii)  Data to be collected by each partner and shared with the other partner, including 
limits to the use of such data 
(iv)  Agreed basis for any external communication related to the activities and partnership, 
including but not limited to the use of brands and names in communications materials 
and media 
(v)  Mechanisms to identify and resolve implementation issues (delays, non-performance 
of tasks, sub-standard delivery) identified in the joint implementation in partnership 
villages/districts 
Partnership principles 
495.  The  basis  for  the  next  phase  of  the  partnership  would  be  an  agreed  set  of  principles  to  help 
guide the partnership as it develops over time. Suggested principles include: 
(i) 
The cooperation between MARS and MoA via READ SI is a partnership built on the 
common objective of “achieving the development of vibrant rural communities where 
profitable and successful cocoa farmers live and work as part of a competitive 
Indonesian cocoa sector” 
(ii) 
Neither party will make or receive payments from the other partner. 
(iii)  Each partner will be responsible for providing the resources and staff required to 
implement their agreed actions in a timely manner. 
(iv)  To the fullest extent possible within their respective institutions regulations and 
policies the partners should work on the basis of an open, transparent relationship 
and the open sharing of information. 
(v)  While both partners have defined responsibilities and duties within the partnership, 
neither party should be considered as a service provider to the other.  
(vi) 
[list of principles to be completed / amended during final partnership negotiation] 
Managing the partnership  
496.  As a broadening partnership, the partners will need to commit time and energy to establishing 
clear  and  effective  mechanisms  for  jointly  managing  the  partnership,  including  clear  decision 
making  authorities  on  each  side  and  clear  and  efficient  mechanism  for  resolving  issues  or 
under-performance  that  may  arise  from  time  to  time  and  is  a  natural  part  of  any  partnership. 
This  should  be  reflected  in  the  approach  and  arrangements  for  the  partnership  management 
meetings. 
497.  As  such  there  should  be  regular  quarterly  partnership  progress  meetings  involving  senior 
managers  from  MARS,  MoA  and  its  implementing  partners  (especially  the  community 
mobilization NGO that will form part of the core READSI implementation team). Accordingly, it is 
recommended that a system of regular Partnership Performance Meetings are adopted under 
the partnership. 
498.  Typical agenda for these meetings may include:

Financing 
500.  The  next  phase  of  the  partnership  is  expected  to  be  a  non-financial  partnership,  with  each 
partner fully financing the activities under its agreed area of responsibility. For the avoidance of 
doubt,  no  payments  are  expected  to  be  made  or  received  by  either  partner  from  the  other 
partner. 
Timetable to finalize the partnership agreement 
501.  The  partnership  detailed  negotiations  and  planning  should  be  completed  in  2017,  with  field 
activities beginning 2018 onwards once READ SI begins implementation. READSI is expected 
to be approved by the Government and IFAD in 2017 but start in Jan 2018.

Description 
Initiative 
1.  Cocoa human resource development 
1.a. Advanced 
training of public 
and private 
extension staff 
and lead farmers 
through training at 
the MARS Cocoa 
Academy.  
PPL, lead farmers, extension managers and private 
cocoa service providers (nursery operators, private 
agronomists) will be provided with advanced cocoa 
production and business training and then supported 
by READ SI/local gov. to deliver cocoa FFS and other 
training to farmers based on this advanced knowledge. 
Residential training would be for a total of seven 
weeks, delivered in two parts: 
  4 weeks advanced cocoa agronomy training 
  3 weeks cocoa farm business training  
A total of 100 people per year will be trained in classes 
of 25 people for each year of READ SI (Total 500 
people). Yr 1 will be primarily PPPs, BP3K and 
Bapeluh staff who will then lead cocoa FFS. Yrs 2-5 
trainees will be mostly lead farmers and private cocoa 
service from supported cocoa groups and 
neighbouring communities.  
Selection criteria and post-training Key Performance 
Indicators (KPIs) are to be jointly agreed by MARS and 
READ SI. In addition, READ SI M&E staff from all 
levels will completed the 2-3 day Adoption Observation 
Training at the Cocoa Academy so that they can 
reliably monitor the effectiveness of the FFS and 
farmer support activities of the trained PPLs . 
In addition to PPLs, priority to attend the Cocoa 
Academy will be given to aspiring young farmers who 
are motivated to set-up their own cocoa service 
enterprises providing orchard management and 
advisory services to other cocoa farmers in their 
communities. Those successfully completing the 
Cocoa Academy training can then be supported on 
their return to their communities to implement their 
business plans under the non-farm livelihoods 
Key success factors / Pre-conditions 
Cost sharing basis 
Key success factors are proper selection of 
trainees linked to performance management 
after they complete training and return to work to 
ensure new skills and knowledge are put into 
practice in training/coaching farmers.   
A pre-condition for this activity to gain 
commitment from MARS is that the trained PPLs 
are provided with sufficient budget and 
resources by the government and READ SI on 
their return to work after MARS training to 
conduct FFS and other activities in the field with 
interested farmers, not only in READ SI villages 
but more widely in their districts (funded by the 
local government budgets). As such, all new 
READ SI villages where cocoa is a priority crop 
will be offered cocoa FFS based on the 
advanced knowledge gained by PPLs at the 
Cocoa Academy (unless directly supported by 
CDC/CVC or Mondelez PPP). READ SI will be 
implemented in approx. 224  "new" villages in 
Sulawesi (plus 50 old villages).  
READ SI must provide clear mechanisms for 
follow-up of Academy trainees after training so 
that MARS have confidence this will happen 
well. This will be done by extension managers 
and staff under the guidance of District PMUs for 
READ SI. As such, extension managers will also 
have to have the technical capacity and 
knowledge so need to join the Academy training.   
READ SI NPMO will provide Quarterly reports to 
MARS of the farmer training conducted by PPLs 
(and others) trained at the MARS Academy. This 
will also include data on adoption rates among 
113 
READ SI / local government:  
1.  READ SI provide budget for 
trainees to deliver at least 2 FFS on 
return to post in READ SI new 
villages based on farmer demand 
(minimum of approx 50 farmers per 
trained PPL) 
2.  Local government commits 
additional funds for trained PPLs to 
deliver additional advanced cocoa 
training to farmers outside READ SI 
villages. A suggested level is each 
PPL is given budget from the local 
gov. to train at least 75 non-READ 
SI farmers (approximately 3 FFS) 
per year for the three years 
following their training at the Cocoa 
Academy. 
3.  Travel costs to/from Makassar or 
Palopo airport and any daily 
allowances to be covered by either 
District Government (preferred) or

MARS will cover  
4.  all costs of residential training at 
Cocoa Academy and transport from

READ SI and MARS will partner with Technical and 
Vocational Education and Training (TVET) institutions 
and Agricultural Training Centres from across 
Sulawesi to improve existing cocoa training and/or 
develop, launch and market new cocoa agronomy and 
business courses aimed at cocoa farmers and others. 
These courses will be run by the TVET institutions and 
ATCs themselves at their own facilities using improved 
training modules and materials jointly developed with 
MARS Cocoa Academy master trainers. The Cocoa 
Academy master trainers will also provide master ToT 
for the trainers and staff of the partner TVET 
institutions and ATCs. Specific actions include: 
1.  Confirm interest from partner TVET institutions and 
ATC and get them to assign lead staff to guide the 
process from their side as well as to be trained as 
cocoa trainers. 
2.  Conduct ToT at the MARS Cocoa Academy of 
partner TVET institutions/ATC course leaders and 
staff. Master ToT courses would be for 30 people 
and a maximum of 3 ToT courses are expected to 
be necessary (subject to interest from TVET 
partner institutions).  It is likely that the Head of the 
Cocoa Academy would act as the Lead Master 
Trainer for this process.  
3.  Review / develop course curriculum and training 
material to be used by TVET institutions and ATCs 
when training student.  (Note: Various material is 
already available already at the Cocoa Academy 
but needs to be tailored to TVET institution/ATC 
setting rather than at the Academy.) 
4.  Support TVET partner institutions/ATC to launch, 
The objective is to improve the quality and 
availability of high quality cocoa production and 
business training around Sulawesi, especially 
via ATCs and TVET institutions. This is needed 
to increase the availability and accessibility of 
improved cocoa agronomy and business training 
on offer in Sulawesi beyond the "gold standard" 
training provided at the residential courses in the 
MARS Cocoa Academy. 
The key success factor will therefore be to find 
partner TVET institutions and ATCs that are 
committed to develop and run high quality cocoa 
farming and business courses.  
Post training follow-up and monitoring with 
students attending TVET/ATCs will be a vital 
part of continuous improvement of these 
courses. This may be new compared to routine 
activities of the partner TVET institutions but will 
need to be made a mandatory condition of their 
participation in this activity. READ SI will be able 
to provide technical and financial support to this 
monitoring. 
For TVET, the objective is to set-up courses and 
trainers than can deliver good quality courses on 
cocoa agronomy and business in TVET 
institutions themselves and not only at the 
Cocoa Academy.  
For ATCs, the objective is to review and 
strengthen the cocoa training offered by the 
national and provincial ATCs. 
This new course development and ToT to other 
TVET institutions and ATCs is similar to the 
114 
READ SI / partner TVET institutions or 
ATCs:

It is also noted that since 2011, MARS Cocoa 
Academy has trained students from over 14 
different vocational training institutions and 
Universities, mostly based in Sulawesi. As such 
there is evidently a demand for vocational 
training on cocoa farming business.  
Cost sharing basis 
It is proposed that these initial pilots are 
done on an equal cost sharing basis 
between READ SI and MARS, but 
arranged with each partner paying 
directly for specific costs to avoid the 
need for cross-payments.

2. Piloting new 
business models 
for CDC / Cocoa 
doctor system in 
existing CDCs in 
Central Sulawesi 
that are not been 
directly financially 
supported by 
MARS or one of 
its suppliers 
Description 
The objective is to find an improved business model 
for the existing CDCs set-up in Central Sulawesi that 
are not receiving ongoing direct financial support from 
MARS or one of its suppliers. This can be thought of 
as finding ways to “reboot” these CDCs to make them 
more financially sustainable. 
At least two different business models will be piloted 
among the five CDCs in Central Sulawesi to address 
the financial sustainability issues:  
1.  CDCs owned and operated jointly by their local 
network of CVCs, as member owned-enterprises; 
2.  CDCs operating as standalone businesses with 
cost recovery models including via sale of 
seedlings and other inputs, service fees for advice 
and training to farmers and CDs/CVCs 
The pilot will be implemented in a two-step process.  
1.  Quickly set-up and pilot at least 2 alternative 
business models and evaluate what works and 
what does not in 2018-19. 
2.  Once one or more viable business models are 
proven, then MARS will assist in bringing in its 
Key success factors / Pre-conditions 
Before launching the pilots, credible business 
plans will need to be developed for each of the 
different models being tested.  
This must be done jointly with the proposed 
owners/operators of the CDCs involved.  
From READ SI, the lead responsibility for this 
activity will rest with the National Finance 
Advisor and the Provincial Finance Advisors for 
Central Sulawesi under the specialist service 
provider contracted to the NPMO. 
MARS will assign a lead manager to work with 
the assigned READ SI managers on this. 
Careful consideration will need to be given to 
ensure that the owners/operators also have 
strong commitment to the new CDC business, 
for example by sharing some of the risk. 
Given the need of the CDCs to generate 
sufficient revenue to cover their costs, it is 
essential that they are not operating in areas 
where there are large-scale subsidy

training and 
advisory system 
development 
MARS has a great wealth of knowledge on cocoa 
production and business that is of interest to a far 
wider audience that can attend the Cocoa Academy or 
ATC/TVET courses.  
So READ SI and MARS will work together to develop 
and test a range of on-line and electronic media for 
making this knowledge widely accessible in Indonesia 
as increasing numbers of smallholder cocoa farmers 
have smartphones and access to the internet 
(especially the younger generations).  
This is expected to include on-line training / reference 
material for farmers and PPL using a range of different 
media and channel tailored to be highly accessible to 
the target audiences, – video clips, illustrated guides, 
FAQs, social media channels/groups 
Key success factors / Pre-conditions 
programmes running for fertilizer or seedlings for 
coca, such as the GERNAS Cacao programme, 
as this would essential undermine the market for 
paid services and inputs. The recent reduction in 
GERNAS Cacao budgets may increase the 
chances that this can be achieved. 
It is essential that any new e-cocoa platform is 
made interesting and accessible to its target 
audience. It therefore needs to be developed 
using a user-centred design processes based on 
an explicit understanding of the target users, 
tasks, and environments; It should be driven and 
refined by user-centered evaluation and 
addresses the whole user experience. The 
process involves users throughout the design 
and development process and it is iterative. 
The future business model for an e-cocoa 
system must also be addressed from the outset. 
Cost sharing basis 
MARS will provide technical experts to 
review and adapt their cocoa 
production and business materials as 
needed to be used in an e-cocoa 
system. 
READ SI will meet the cost of hiring 
specialist e-communication systems 
development expertise as required.  
4. Accelerated 
cross-learning 
between MARS 
and READ SI field 
approaches, 
through READ SI 
working in 
selected districts 
with MARS' own 
managed CDCs 
and cocoa 
sourcing 
operations. 
READ SI will operate in two of the districts in South 
Sulawesi in which MARS has direct sourcing 
operations and directly supports the CDCs ongoing 
operation. READ SI will implement a full set of "new" 
village activities in cocoa producing villages in these 
villages. This deliberate over-lap of activities is 
intended to accelerate cross-learning in three specific 
aspects of field practice: 
1.  For READ SI - it can directly move to test models 
in which Cocoa Doctors (CVC) deliver farmer field 
school training and then do follow-up with cocoa 
producer groups, thus moving to a full private 
sector service delivery model. 
For this learning to take place, there will need to 
be close coordination and information sharing 
between the READ SI district team (DPMO) and 
MARS teams.  
As a minimum, there should be quarterly 
coordination and review meetings between the 
teams, with the READ SI National PMO also 
attending these meetings. 
This will need to be supported by timely and 
reliable data on the impacts and effectiveness of 
different activities.  
This is a “zero cost” partnership activity 
in that no additional field activities are 
envisaged under this activity (beyond 
the regular activities of READ SI and 
MARS respectively) which primarily 
focuses on co-location of already 
planned activities and effective 
knowledge sharing. 
If significant additional costs arise due 
to extra activities to take advantage of 
opportunities from this co-location then, 
in principle, costs will be shared on an 
equal basis. 
2.  For MARS - it will provide a direct opportunity to

Mondelez's Cocoa Life Programme - READ SI Partnership Framework (prospective) 
Background and context  
Both Cocoa Life and READ SI are established and successful programmes in their own right  
502.  Cocoa  Life  was  officially  launched  globally  in  2012  and  is  the  evolution  of  Cadbury's  Cocoa 
Partnership  programme launched  in  2008. Cocoa Life therefore draws  on almost a decade of 
hands-on  experience  of  sustainable  cocoa  community  development.  This  is  evident  from  the 
quality and coherence of the approach now being deployed in Indonesia. As of December 2015, 
Cocoa Life had reached 76,600 cocoa farmers in total in the six cocoa origin countries in which 
it works (Cote 'Ivoire, Ghana, Indonesia, India, Brazil, Dominican Republic) Mondelez launched 
its  global  Cocoa  Life  programme  in  Indonesia  three  years  ago  and  is  active  in  Sulawesi  and 
Sumatra. Mondelez state that "Cocoa Life aims to reach more than 200,000 farmers across six 
countries,  benefiting  more  than  a  million  people.  Mondelēz  International’s  ultimate  goal  is  to 
sustainably source all the company’s cocoa supply, mainly via Cocoa Life".  
503.  READ SI is the scaling-up initiative for the successful READ project in Sulawesi which ran for 
six  years  jointly  financed  by  the  government  and  IFAD  and  completed  its  first  phase  in  2015. 
MoA then replicated the successful model to West Kalimantan and  East Nusa Tengarra  using 
its own budget. READ SI is the next phase of this scaling-up process and will again be jointly 
financed by the government and IFAD and run for 5 years from early 2018 covering a total of 
around 354 villages, of which 274 villages will be in Sulawesi. 
Cocoa Life and READ SI share similar aspirations and working approach  
504.  Both programmes: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
combine an integrated package of social mobilization with technical training and 
support on production;  
deal more broadly with livelihoods in the community, financial literacy and have a 
focus on women's empowerment  
seek to develop meaningful partnerships with other specialist implementing partners 
to complement their own core competencies rather than trying to cover all aspects by 
themselves in isolation 
(iv)  measure and publish real impacts and tangible results based on similar measures 
(farm net incomes, yields etc.). 
Cocoa Life’s scope at the village level 
505. 
In cocoa communities, Cocoa Life has five pillars to its work in a cocoa community:  
(i) 
(ii) 
Farming: helping farmers – men and women – improve yields and earn higher 
incomes. 
Community: enabling cocoa farming families to create the kind of communities they 
and their children want to live in; including an emphasis on increasing women’s 
participation and decision making in the community. 
(iii) 
Livelihoods: improving business skills and helping to develop additional sources of 
income to lift people out of poverty. 
(iv)  Youth: activities to respect and support child rights; and making cocoa farming a more 
attractive profession for young people. 
(v) 
Environment: – protecting the landscape in which cocoa is grown to maintain 
ecosystems and farming land for future generations 
506. 
It  is  also  notable  that  Cocoa  Life  is  explicitly  aligned  with  Mondelez's  cocoa  sourcing 
operations. This means that Cocoa Life is implemented with farmers in their supply chains and 
118 
Republic of Indonesia 
Rural Empowerment and Agricultural Development Programme Scaling-up Initiative (READ SI) 
Final programme design report 
Appendix 4:  Detailed programme description 
that  the  buying  contracts  are  aligned  with  Cocoa  Life  and  vice  versa.  This  would  appear  to 
greatly  increase  the  potential  for  sustainability  and  scale.  Indeed,  the  Cocoa  Life  programme 
managers report that they have had most success to date in raising cocoa farmer incomes in 
Indonesia  where  the  technical  farmer  support  on  improved  cocoa  production  practices  are 
delivered as embedded services in the supply chain by agronomist and trainer working directly 
for the cocoa buyers (i.e. Mondelez's suppliers) as opposed to being delivered by a third party 
or  NGO.  This  is  an  important  lesson  for  consideration  in  developing  a  potential  partnership 
between READ SI and Cocoa Life. 
507.  Currently  in  Indonesia,  Cocoa  Life's  main  non-commercial  partners  are  NGOs,  such  as  Save 
the  Children,  Swiss  Contact  and  local  partner  NGOs,  who  primarily  develop  the  non-cocoa 
aspects  of  the  Cocoa  Life  package  of  investments.  In  the  case  of  Swiss  Contact  they  are 
understood to also deliver farmer training to cocoa farmers in some Cocoa Life locations as a 
contracted  third  party  service  provider  to  some  of  Mondelez’  commercial  supplier,  especially 
Cargill. It is understood that, at present, Mondelez does not yet have a direct formal partnership 
with GoI on Cocoa Life though evidently does cooperate with Dinas at the local level and with 
the village leadership.  
READ SI Scope 
508. 
In READ SI village, the programme as four main pillars based on the proven READ approach of 
community  mobilization  closely  integrated  with  agriculture  and  livelihood  development  within 
programme villages with Village Facilitators and technical extension staff working side by side 
in  each  village.  Implementation  is  be  led  by  district  governments  in  line  with  Indonesia's 
decentralization  framework.  The  elements  of  the  integrated  village  process  include  four 
complementary dimensions which will run in parallel with the programme supported households 
and common interest groups: 
(i) 
(ii) 
Community mobilization; 
Agriculture and livelihoods; 
(iii)  Savings, loans and financial literacy; and 
(iv)  Nutrition, including early childhood nutrition (i.e. "the first 1000 days"/1000 Hari 
Pertama Kehidupan) 
A potentially high degree of mutual complementarity 
509.  A  preliminary  view  suggests  that  the  two  programmes  appear  to  be  potentially  highly 
complementary in terms of their scope and focus, but also importantly in their desire to deliver 
impacts through well designed partnerships. Consequently, following initial discussions, there is 
strong  interest  from  both  Mondelez  Indonesia  and  READ  SI  to  further  develop  a  practical 
partnership in Sulawesi.  
510.  To further these discussions the joint MoA and IFAD team leading the READ SI design visited 
ongoing Cocoa Life pilots in Sumatra in Mar 2017 with the Cocoa Life programme managers as 
well  as  the  manager  from Olam,  Mondelez’  supplier  in  Lampung,  and  Save  the  Children  who 
are contracted by Mondelez to implement the non-cocoa related activities under Cocoa Life in 
partnership with Olam.  
511. 
It  is  recognized  from  all  sides  that  a  formal  partnership  between  Mondelez  and  Ministry  of 
Agriculture would be the first such partnership between the parties and therefore would need to 
be  developed  in  stages.  Consequently,  while  there  is  strong  interest  from  both  sides  at  a 
technical  level,  any  final  partnership  would  be  subject  to  approval  and  authorization  from  the 
senior management of Mondelez Indonesia and MoA.

Mondelez,  via  its  supplier  would  be  responsible  for  all  activities 
related  to  cocoa  farming,  farmers  training,  demonstrations  and 
technical support.  
Participating  cocoa  farmers  should 
include  all  those  meeting 
Mondelez’s  own  selection  criteria.  In  addition,  cocoa  farmers  and 
young  farmers  interested  to  move  in  to  cocoa  farming  that  are 
participants  under  the  wider  READ  SI  project  in  the  village  should 
also be included in the coca farming activities lead by the Mondelez 
supplier in the village. 
[Issue  to  be  discussed:  there  is  a  clear  preference  from  READ  SI 
and IFAD for the technical support to cocoa farmers to be delivered 
directly by the Mondelez supplier, as Olam does in Lampung, rather 
than have this outsourced to a third party as this would significantly 
complicate  the  partnership  especially  in  the  initial  pilot  partnership 
stage. 
READ  SI  will  be  responsible  for  community  development  in  the 
partnership villages. 
READ  SI  will  employ  one  full-time  Village  Facilitator  in  each 
partnership  village,  with  supervisors  at  the  Sub-district  level  and 
Managers at the District level. 
The  VF  will  facilitate  the  annual  participatory  planning  process  to 
develop,  review  and  updated  the  Community  Development  Plan 
(CDP) required under Cocoa Life and also support the Village Head 
and  their  team  to  endorse  this  plan  and  adopt  it  into  the  official 
village development plan, including seeking funding form the Village 
Fund to the priority activities identified under the CDP. 
Activities identified under the CDP which are also a priority for READ 
SI may also be provided resources and implemented with READ SI 
support in the village. 
READ  SI  will  be  responsible  for  identifying  the  most  credible 
livelihoods and income sources that households want to develop and 
then  providing  appropriate  technical  and  other  support  to  develop 
these.

READ SI  will have additional activities in partnership  village as part 
of the core READ SI approach: 
  Small scale productive infrastructure: READ  SI  will provide 
a  small  budget  in  each  partnership  village  for  small 
productive  infrastructure  investment  to  compliment  the 
development  of  cocoa  and  non-cocoa  based  livelihoods. 
The selection of the small productive infrastructure works to 
be  completed  will  be  selected  by  the  READ  SI  direct 
through  a  similar  participatory 
beneficiary  households 
planning process to that used for the CDP 
  Savings  and  credit  and  business  skills:  READ  SI  will 
provide  business skills training to all  READ SI participating 
farmers and then  
Support  all  READ  SI  farmer  groups  to  set-up  and  run 
savings  and  credit  self-help  group.  These  activities  can  be

Both  Mondelez  and  READ  SI  teams  will  actively  seek  to  identify 
credible  practical  opportunities  to  help  youth  interest  in  cocoa 
farming or other  non-cocoa livelihoods  in the  village  to successfully 
develop such opportunities. This may include, for example, younger 
farmers with limited land of their own being support to set-up service 
enterprise to provide improved cocoa orchard management, grafting 
and related service to other farmers in their community. 
Child protection: Cocoa Life requires specific measures to  be taken 
related to this. It is likely that if Mondelez can provide the necessary 
training  and  guidance  that  the  READ  SI  Village  Facilitators  can  be 
assigned  responsibility  to  facilitate  the  required  processes  in  the 
village.  However,  further  discussion  is  needed  to  clarify  this  as  it  is 
not currently a priority included under the main READ SI framework. 
Both  Mondelez  and  READ  SI  will  only  promote  environmentally 
sustainable production and livelihood systems in the village. 
However,  further  information  is  required  on  any  specific  additional 
activities required under Cocoa Life and, if so, how these  would be 
delivered in the village wither by the Mondelez supplier and/or READ 
SI teams 
READ SI has prioritized a number of activities in this area, including 
women  only  groups  for  homestead  gardening  who  will  also  receive 
business  skills  training  and  set-up  their  own  women  only  savings 
and credit groups. 
Nutrition  activities  will  not  only  include  support  to  homestead 
gardening but other communication and behaviour changes activities 
focused  on  improved  child  nutrition,  especially  for  ante-natal  and 
early  childhood  nutrition  in  the  critical  “first  1000  day”  period  from 
conception to 24 months age.

Locations for pilot stage of partnership 
514.  First  pilot  partnership  could  begin  in  Kolaka  District  in  SE  Sulawesi  which  is  a  current  Cocoa 
Life district and a planned READSI district. READSI will provide additional resources to the pilot 
partnership district(s) to be able to include up to 30 villages in READ SI activities allowing for 
selection of sufficient villages to be included  in  the pilot partnership alongside other READ  SI 
only  villages  in  the  districts  included  for  additional  READ  SI  targeting  objectives  beyond  the 
pilot  partnership  (as  READ  SI  work  in  various  commodities  and  broader  set-up  of  targeting 
objectives beyond cocoa community development). 
515.  Village selection while require the agreements of all four principle actors in the partnership: 
(i) 
Mondelez 
(ii)  Mondelez’s supplier operating in the concerned district 
(iii)  READ SI management 
(iv)  District government authorities 
516.  The partnership villages may fall in to three types and the engagement process may need to be 
adjusted according to the starting point of the village, i.e.: 
(i) 
Existing Cocoa Life village in which READ SI joins 
(ii) 
New villages to both Cocoa Life and READ SI 
(iii)  Existing READ SI village in which Cocoa Life joins [Note: in the proposed pilot district 
of Kolaka there are currently no READ SI villages, so none of this type of village are 
expected in the initial stage of the pilot.] 
[Further  discussion  is  needed  on  any  possible  differences  in  the  process/responsibilities 
between the different types of partnership village] 
Timetable to establish partnership 
517.  The  partnership  detailed  negotiations  and  planning  should  be  completed  in  2017,  with  field 
activities beginning 2018 onwards. READSI is expected to be approved by the Government and 
IFAD in 2017 but start in Jan 2018. 
Financing 
518.  The  initial  pilot  partnership  would  be  a  non-financial  partnership,  with  each  partner  fully 
financing  the  activities  under  its  agreed  area  of  responsibility.  For  the  avoidance  of  doubt,  no 
payments are expected to be made or received by either partner from the other partner. 
Partnership agreement 
519.  The  partnership  should  operate  under  a  single  framework  agreement  at  the  national  level 
signed between Mondelez and the Ministry of Agriculture.  
520.  The partnership agreement should specify: 
(i) 
(ii) 
Arrangements and procedures for monitoring and supervision of the activities covered 
by the partnership 
Data to be collected by each partner and shared with the other partner, including 
limits to the use of such data 
(iii)  Agreed basis for any external communication related to the activities and partnership, 
including but not limited to the use of brands and names in communications materials 
and media

Partnership principles 
521.  A  starting  point  for  the  partnership  would  be  an  agreed  set  of  principles  to  help  guide  the 
partnership as it develops over time. Suggests principles include: 
(i) 
The cooperation between Mondelez and READ SI is a partnership built on common 
objectives. to actively “achieving the development of vibrant rural communities where 
profitable and successful cocoa farmers live and work as part of a competitive 
Indonesian cocoa sector” [to be reviewed and agreed during final partnership 
negotiations] 
(ii) 
Neither party will make or receive payments from the other partner. 
(iii)  Each partner will be responsible for providing the resources and staff required to 
implement their agreed actions in a timely manner. 
(iv)  To the fullest extent possible within their respective institutions regulations and 
policies the partners should work on the basis of an open, transparent relationship 
and the open sharing of information. 
(v)  While both partners have defined responsibilities and duties within the partnership, 
neither party should be considered as a service provider to the other.  
(vi) 
[list of principles to be completed / amended during final partnership negotiation] 
Managing the partnership  
522.  As  a  new  partnership  for  both  sides,  the  partners  will  need  to  commit  time  and  energy  to 
establishing  clear  and  effective  mechanisms  for  jointly  managing  the  partnership,  including 
clear decision making authorities on each side and clear and efficient mechanism for resolving 
issues  or  under-performance  that  may  arise  from  time  to  time  and  is  a  natural  part  of  any 
partnership.  This  should  be  reflected  in  the  approach  and  arrangements  for  the  partnership 
management meetings. 
523.  As  such  there  should  be  regular  quarterly  partnership  progress  meetings  involving  senior 
managers  from  Mondelez,  its  suppliers,  MoA  and  its  implementing  partners  (especially  the 
community mobilization NGO that will form part of the core READSI implementation team).  
524.  Partnership Performance Meetings are an existing part of Mondelez’ process for managing its 
relationship  with  implementing  partners  for  Cocoa  Life  in  Indonesia.  It  is  recommended  that 
similar  processes  of  regular  Partnership  Performance  Meetings  are  adopted  under  the 
Mondelez-READ SI partnership. 
525.  Typical agenda for these meetings may include: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
Review of progress of agreed action plans and results since last meeting and 
cumulative progress against annual plan 
Identification of any issues / problems in performance or in the cooperation among the 
implementing partners at district/provincial level 
Identification of opportunities to improve performance / co-operation / impact from the 
partnership at the district/province level 
(iv)  Agreement of priority actions and results to be achieved in the next period, with 
defined responsibilities, timetable and resources to be committed 
526. 
In principle, to ensure an efficient process, these should be coordinated as a single combined 
meeting for all districts in the same province. In the initial pilot partnership, there is likely to be

2.5 Livestock production and health services and markets  
528.  Livestock  will  be  a  flagship  product  in  NTT  given  its  importance  to  farmer  there.  A  vibrant 
livestock sub-sector in NTT demands, among other things, an effective and efficient system of 
animal  production  and  health  services.  Over  the  medium  term,  as  the  local  livestock  sector 
becomes increasing market-oriented with more intensive smallholder livestock production, such 
animal  production  and  health  service  will  need  to  be  delivered  primarily  by  private  providers 
operating  in  the  villages  in  order  to  meet  the  demand  for  services  from  an  expanding  sub-
sector. 
529. 
Initially, in NTT only, READ SI will fund the training and establishment costs of 6 animal health 
and  production  technicians  (AHPTs)  –  covering  3  districts  each. AHPTs  will  be  private  sector, 
part-time  farmers. Training  will  be:  (i)  delivered  at  the  Kupang Agriculture Training  Centre;  (ii) 
curriculum will be a tailor-made module approved/designed by READ; (iii) course duration will 
be 2 modules of 3 weeks each (i.e. basic plus refresher); Training costs are estimated at $770 
per trainee while AHPT establishment costs are $2,025 each. In addition, READ SI will fund an 
information and awareness campaign estimated at $500 per AHPT. It is assumed that the AHPT 
clinic/office refurbishment will be funded by each AHPT.  This technical training at the ATC will 
be accompanied by a structured programme on on-the-job professional coaching and follow-up 
by professional livestock staff of the district DINAS which is conducted in the technicians own 
place  of  work.  Such  follow  up  should  be  a  minimum  of  one  visit  per  month  for  an  18  month 
period to ensure the technician develop the deep confidence and skills needed to be a trusted 
service  provider  in  their  community.  Technician  will  be  provided  with  a  starter  package  of 
equipment and medicine and vaccines once they have completed their ATC training. 
530.  Subject  to  satisfactory  progress  being  made  by  the  group  of  private  livestock  technicians, 
READ SI will then review experience from elsewhere in Indonesia and Asia on the development 
of  networks  and  associations  for  the  technicians  to  provide  mutual  professional  support  and 
backstopping and raise the sustainability of these services over the longer term. For example, 
in  Cambodia,  district-level  associations  of  private  livestock  technicians  have  been  operating 
successfully in some area for more than 20 years with minimal external support. 
531.  At mid-term, READ SI will review the experience and lessons from the livestock production and 
service  market  development  in  NTT  and  assess  potential  and  appropriateness  for  this  to  be 
scaled-up into other READ SI districts outside of NTT.

III.  Component 3: Policy and strategy development support 
532. 
It is widely recognised that the agricultural sector policy environment in Indonesia has not kept 
pace  with  the  changing  requirements  of  the  sector,  and  that  the  substantial  policy  analysis 
conducted in the country  – much of it outside Government – has to date had limited influence 
on national policy. Today, the sector faces major challenges in its modernization, and to make 
use of the opportunities and meet the demand for both national food security and export, there 
is  an  urgent  need  to  develop  a  policy  and  institutional  framework  that  catalyses  increased 
investments from the private sector, including small farmers themselves, and more effective use 
of public resources. Policies and institutions to facilitate the scaling  up  of READ represent an 
important dimension of this.  
533.  At  this  stage,  what  is  critical  is  to  bring  ownership  for  policy  analysis  and  its  use  to  inform 
strategies and decisions within Government, and in particular the Ministry of Agriculture.  In the 
context  of  READ  IFAD  provided  limited  support  to  enable  the  Ministry  to  conduct  some  basic 
policy  analysis  itself:  this  it  did,  and  it  strongly  benefitted  the  scaling  up  process.  Now,  the 
Government of Indonesia has requested IFAD to continue this policy support and expand it, to 
possibly  also  inform  the  preparation  of  the  2020-2025  National  Medium-Term  Development 
Grant.  Towards  this  end,  IFAD  has  allocated  a  USD1  million  grant  to  support  policy  and 
knowledge  management  activities,  and  the  associated  capacity  building  work  on  which  they 
depend. 
534.  Policies affect every dimension of the institutional and legal context in which poor rural people 
pursue their livelihoods. They shape the world they live in and the economic opportunities open 
to  them.  Supportive  policies  can  go  a  long  way  towards  providing  conditions  in  which  people 
can lift themselves out of poverty (IFAD, 2014). Investments made by the International Fund for 
Agricultural  Development  (IFAD)  in  Indonesia  will  contribute  to  three  interlinked  strategic 
objectives:  (i)  smallholder  producers  participate  in  remunerative  agricultural  markets;  (ii) 
smallholder  producers  and  their  families  are  more  resilient  to  risk;  and  (iii)  rural  institutions 
deliver services that respond to the needs of smallholder producers (IFAD, 2016). Usually, loan 
investments  are  accompanied  by  grants  to  strengthen  the  learning,  scaling  up  and  policy 
dialogue agenda.  
535.  Bappenas,  the  Ministry  of  National  Development  Planning,  Republic  of  Indonesia,  is  an 
Indonesian  central  government  institution  responsible  for  formulating  national  development 
planning  and  budgeting  (annual,  five-year  and  long  term).  Bappenas  is  also  responsible  for 
coordinating  international  development  (bilateral,  unilateral  and  multilateral)  cooperation. 
Bappenas  is  guiding  and  supporting  technical  line  ministries  to  develop  better  planning 
strategies  and  achieve  the  national  development  objectives.  With  its  role  of  ensuring 
development  coordination,  it  is  leading  reviews  and  contributing  analysis  to  promote  policy 
dialogue among stakeholders. This will formulate a long-term vision to guide the preparation of 
the next medium-term development plan (Rencana Pembangunan Jangka Menengah Nasional 
- RPJMN). 
536.  The  Directorate  of  Food  and Agriculture  under  the  Deputy  Minister  for  Maritime  and  Natural 
Resources  –  Bappenas,  is  responsible  for  monitoring  the  agricultural  policy  response.  The 
directorate  coordinates  inputs  on  agriculture  to  the  planning  process,  particularly  focusing  on 
food  security.  It  supports  the  creation  of  agriculture  strategies  for  sustainable  economic 
development.  Agricultural  targets  and  strategies  link  closely  to  the  creation  of  strategies  on 
marine and fishery development. The directorate collaborates with the Ministry of Agriculture to 
ensure  coherence  between  the  medium-term  strategy  of  the  Ministry  of Agriculture  (Rencana 
Strategis Kementarian Pertanian –RENSTRA) and RPJMN. 
537.  As  Bappenas  is  in  the  critical  stages  of  preparing  the  Long-Term  Vision  2045,  and  the  next 
RPJMN for the period 2020-2024, it is necessary to conduct a series of studies, modelling and 
analytical  work to provide  more evidence for decision making. The activities supported  by the 
125 
Republic of Indonesia 
Rural Empowerment and Agricultural Development Programme Scaling-up Initiative (READ SI) 
Final programme design report 
Appendix 4:  Detailed programme description 
IFAD grant will focus on developing the capacities of Bappenas for effective use of evidence in 
the  planning  process,  to  strengthen  coordination  between  line  ministries  and  enhance  the 
participation  of  the  knowledge  sector  and  representatives  of  smallholder  farmers  in  national 
development planning. The grant will not create a new process but improve and strengthen the 
current mechanism and methodology (annual, five-year and long-term planning and budgeting). 
It also aims to strengthen coordination between international development cooperation partners 
supporting the food and agriculture policy. 
538.  The specific objectives for the policy component of READSI are:  
(i) 
(ii) 
to support the development of the Strategic Vision 2045, the next national medium-
term development plan (RPJMN 2020-2024) and annual work plans (Rencana Kerja 
Pemerintah - RKP), including coordination of involved stakeholders;  
to strengthen the capacities of government agencies in effective use of evidence in 
the policy and planning processes, including improved coordination between 
stakeholders such as central and local governments, non-government organisations, 
and the general public;  
(iii) 
to facilitate donor coordination on agricultural policy support; and  
(iv) 
to strengthen the use of results, lessons learned and smart practices from past and 
ongoing development projects. The policy areas supported by the grant connect to 
the national food security agenda and promote inclusive rural growth. 
539.  The grant  will support a ‘demand-driven’ policy  process which allows for a series of activities, 
including (but not limited to):  
(i) 
(ii) 
identification of policy needs/gaps to support planning;  
support for dialogue events and activities promoting participation and coordination of 
stakeholders in the planning process at national and local government level;  
(iii) 
support for outreach/socialisation and refinement of plans;  
(iv) 
(v) 
identification of capacity needs, design and conduct of specific training sessions 
connected to objectives of the grant;  
support to knowledge management and dissemination of results and lessons learned 
from past and ongoing development projects, such as READ SI.

541.  The component is expected to be able to support activities across the entire policy cycle, from 
the identification of policy issues, to policy analysis, approval, implementation and monitoring. It 
will  have  a  focus  on  addressing  priority  policy  analysis  and  operational  effectiveness  issues 
relevant to smallholder agricultural development in Indonesia, and specifically those relevant to 
the policy and institutional challenges associated with the scaling up of READ.

Institutional aspects and implementation 
543.  READ  SI  will  follow  the  overall  implementation  arrangements  of  READ  and  will  inherit  the 
strong  management  foundations  that  have  underpinned  READ's  success. At  the  same  time  it 
will  also  need  to  adapt  some  arrangements  as  it  evolves  in  to  a  programme  management 
framework (from a standalone project). 
544.  key principles on which READ SI implementation arrangements will operate are: 
(i) 
(ii) 
Designed to operate within mainstream government systems and processes 
Expanding strong core management team, including bringing in best managers from 
READ 1 district to more core roles in new READ SI programme 
(iii)  Building strong systems and processes to maximize management efficiency 
(especially given high work load of AAEHRD in IPDMIP and READ SI) 
(iv)  Build responsibility and accountability at all levels in the programme 
(v) 
(vi) 
Benchmarking between districts and within districts and staff, as well as between 
provinces, enabled by independent monitoring and evaluation  
Incentives for strong performance, to foster self-motivation, but with mechanisms to 
address under-performance 
Institutional arrangements 
545.  Steering  Committee.  READ  SI  will  be  overseen  by  a  Steering  Committee  which  will  have 
powers to take key decisions on the overall direction of the programme. It is proposed that the 
Steering Committee is Chaired by a senior official of the Ministry of Agriculture and Co-chaired 
by BAPPENAS. 
546.  Members of the Steering Committee should include representatives of: 
(i) 
Government - Central: Ministry of Villages, Ministry of Home Affairs 
(ii)  Government - Sub-national: Representatives of READ SI Provinces and Districts  
(iii)  PPP partners:  from cocoa sector and banking sector 
(iv)  Other key implementing partners and stakeholders 
547.  For effective work and decision making, members will be appointed for not less than one year 
and total membership of the Steering Committee should not exceed 20 persons 
548.  Executing  Agency  will  be  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  on  behalf  of  GoI  and  the  Agency  of 
Agricultural  Extension  and  Human  Resource  Development  will  be  assigned  as  the  National 
Programme Management Unit on behalf of MoA. 
549.  Ministry of Finance will act as the official Representative of the Government of Indonesia as 
the  Borrower/  Recipient.  In  this  role  MoF  will  be  responsible  for:  (i)  Fulfilling  the  government 
fiduciary  oversight  and  management  responsibilities;  and  (ii)  Providing  sufficient  counterpart 
contribution  in  a  timely  manner  to  finance  the  programme  activities,  including  payment  of 
government  staff  salaries;  (iii)  Timely  processing  WAs,  approval  of  procurement  actions  and 
other necessary documents according to the agreed operating procedures.  
550.  NPMO will be led by a Programme Director supported by three Deputy Programme Directors. 
The  role  of  two  of  the  Deputy  Programme  Directors  is  to  provide  overall  coordination  and 
oversight of all programme activities within a number of provinces and ensure adequate senior

presence and support of the programme management out in the READ SI districts. In addition, 
the  third  Deputy  PD  will  oversee  financial  management,  procurement  and  programme 
administration issues, including planning, M&E and reporting. 
551.  While  the  NPMO  has  overall  responsibility  for  programme  delivery,  each  of  the  Components 
has specific implementation arrangements. : 
(i) 
the  relevant  agencies  and  Dinas  as 
Component  1:  District  Sekretaris  Daerah45  (SEKDA)  and  their  relevant  technical 
agencies  (especially  DINAS  Pertanian)  will  have  prime  responsibility  for  programme 
delivery within their districts. SETDA will act as the District Programme Management 
Office  (DPMO),  with 
the  Programme 
Implementation  Units  (DPIUs).  Staff  from  the  specialist  implementing  partners  on 
social  mobilization  and  rural  finance  assigned  to  each  district  will  work  as  an 
integrated  part  of  the  district  implementation  teams  and  be  based  in  the  relevant 
agency teams (similarly at sub-district level). The district teams will be provided with 
technical backstopping and monitoring by NPMO team as well as the corresponding 
provincial agencies, especially the provincial Dinas Pertanian who will host the READ 
SI  Provincial  Programme  Support  Unit  (PPSU).  There  will  be  a  more  systematic 
process for engagement of Sub-district (Camat) and village heads (Kepala Desa). 
(ii) 
Component  2:  The  NPMO  will  have  primary  responsibility  for  delivery  of  activities 
under the four sub-components. In the case of cocoa and rural finance, PPP's will be 
a central mechanism. Under sub-component 2.1, the Directors of collaborating ATCs 
will  be  accountable  to  the  NPMO  to  provide  more  relevant  in-service  training  to 
agriculture extension staff. 
(iii)  Component 3: Will be managed and implemented by BAPPENAS. 
552.  Specialist implementing  partners for social mobilization and rural finance  will be contracted 
centrally by NPMO and operate as an integrated part of the implementation teams, hosted by 
the  relevant  units  at  national,  provincial,  district  and  sub-district  level.  For  this  purpose,  two 
specialist  service  providers  will  be  procured  as  institutional  service  contracts  by  the  NPMO 
rather than hiring individual consultants. This will be similar to the arrangements for the social 
mobilization TA adopted under READ. 
553.  Provincial  Programme  Support  Units  (PPSO)  will  be  set-up  in  each  Province.    PPSU  will 
primarily  focus  on  programme  administration  functions,  such  as  financial  reporting,  M&E  and 
planning.  They  are  considered  necessary  to  provide  closer  support  and  backstopping  to  the 
District PMOs given the increased geographical coverage of READ SI. The PPSU are a support 
unit and as such will not lead any activities nor direct activities in districts. PPSU are expected 
to  be  hosted  by  the  provincial  Dinas  Pertanian  and  will  also  host  the  provincial  staff  of  the 
contracted specialist implementing partners for Social Mobilization and Rural Finance. 
554.  District  Programme  Management  Office  (DPMO)  will  be  set  up  in  each  district  hosted  by 
SETDA  and  will  guide  a  District  Programme  Implementation  Unit  (DPIU)  hosted  by  the 
integrated  Dinas  Pertanian,  now  covering  agriculture,  livestock,  estate  crops  and  extension 
under one dinas.  
555.  Senior  Technical  Assistance  will  be  highly  focused.  There  will  be  a  small  amount  of  senior 
national  and  international  technical  assistance,  primarily  at  the  NPMO  level  and  weighted 
towards  the  start  of  the  programme  to  help  establish  the  new  programme  systems  and 
approaches.  This  senior  TA  will  explicitly  focus  on  advising  and  providing  senior  professional 
support  in  specific  areas  of  Programme  Management  to  the  NPMO  and  will  not  be  used  to 
substitute for capacity in the programme team.

556.  Staffing.  READ  SI  will  operate  on  the  principle  of  having  a  small  high  performing  team  and 
avoid large number of staff and consultant. At the same time it is recognized that READ SI, as 
well as IPDMIP, represent a substantial increase in workload for the NPMO. 
557.  Within  Districts,  staffing  will  be  very  similar  to  that  under  READ,  with  the  additional  of  two 
District Finance Advisors per district. 
558.  At the NPMO, staffing will need to be expanded in specific areas especially: 
(i) 
Three Deputy Programme Directors to provide more senior management time to be 
out supporting districts 
(ii)  M&E and KM unit would need to be substantially strengthened, with additional short 
term inputs to design and establish the improved M&E systems under READ SI (e.g. 
district and province benchmarking; tablet-based data collection; household level 
impact tracking from farm books; identifying, documenting and communicating best 
practices in the programme etc.) 
(iii)  Specialist technical staff (from contracted specialist technical partners) focusing on: 
i. 
ii. 
social mobilization activity management 
rural finance activity management  
559. 
In order to cope with the management reach across many  districts, there is also likely to need 
to be some increased staff time input at provincial level, especially: 
(i) 
(ii) 
MoA: programme support and monitoring by BOKOLUH on behalf of NPMO. As well 
as  management  level  support,  this  may  also  include  having  a  full-time  M&E  officer 
attached to each province to provide backstopping and support to Districts physically 
closer to the Districts (as an out-posted position from the M&E unit of the NPMO) 
Social  mobilization:  management  and  backstopping  of  District  SM  coordinator  is  by 
Provincial  level  SM  managers.  Typically,  with  one  provincial  level  SM  manager  will 
oversee  two  provinces.  These  are  posts  within  the  SM  NGO  service  provider 
contracted to the programme. 
(iii)  Rural  finance:  management  and  backstopping  of  District  Finance  Advisors  by 
Provincial  Finance  Advisors  and  National  Finance  Advisor.  Typically,  with  one  PFA 
covering  two  districts.  These  are  posts  within  the  contract  for  the  specialist 
implementing partner for rural finance.

560.  The  planning,  M&E  and  KM  process  will  build  on  READ  but  also  adopt  key  aspect  of  best 
practice  from  other  projects  in  Indonesia  and  the  region,  notably  from  CCDP.  These  will  be 
further  developed  during  final  design  and  the  Programme  Implementation  Manual,  but  are 
briefly described below. 
Planning 
561.  Planning  processes  and  schedules  within  READ  SI  will  be  harmonized  with  the  mainstream 
planning process of GOI - both centrally and at District level. 
562.  Annual AWPB Approval Process Loan Financing: During the final quarter of each financial 
year,  the  READ  SI  NPMO  will  prepare  the  AWPB  for  the  following  year.  The  AWPB  will  be 
prepared by consolidating (1) the plans from each District, primarily covering Component 1 (2) 
plans  associated  with  each  of  the  four  sub-components  under  Component  2,  primarily  led  by 
the relevant NPMO teams, and (3) plans for overall management of READ SI. 
563.  The AWPB will be submitted by the Programme Director for the loan funded activities.  
564.  AWPB  Process  Grant  Financing:  The AWPB  for  grant  funded  activities  will  be  prepared  by 
the grant secretariat in BAPPENAS, approved by the Deputy Minister for Maritime and Natural 
Resources. 
565.  Districts  are  the  primary  level  of  intervention  for  READ  SI  and  so  the  primary  intervention 
planning will be done at District level. This includes all activities under Component 1. Planning 
in  the  District  will  be  led  by  SEKDA  with  BAPPEDA  (the  District  planning  and  investment 
agency) and  harmonized  with the local planning  processes and  will build on  inputs and  plans 
from each village and sub-district. 
Monitoring and evaluation 
566.  The M&E and Knowledge Management framework of READ SI will draw on the experience of 
the  Coastal  Community  Development  Project  (CCDP)  to  monitor  and  gain  knowledge  about 
programme  poverty  reduction  and  livelihoods  impact  and  how  these  can  be  scaled-up  and 
replicated  into  a  programmatic  approach.    The  M&E  of  READ  provides  few  insights  into  the 
dynamics of poverty reduction at the household level or the factors that explain the success of 
different activities. Instead, information is derived mainly from: (i) extrapolation from agricultural 
yields; (ii) extrapolation from an improvement in the incidence of poverty at the provincial level; 
and  (iii)  the  evident  support  for  READ,  both  within  the  government  and  amongst  the 
beneficiaries.  READ  SI  will  provide  an  improved  M&E  and  knowledge  management  design, 
which in as far as it relates to targeting will include:  
  A  weekly/monthly  dashboard  that  shows  progress  on  key  outputs  and  objectives,  including 
gender.  
  Sex-disaggregated database and indicators on all outcomes, outputs and indicators.  
  Household  level  analysis  of  poverty  impact  that  enable  an  understanding  of  how  different 
interventions  (rice,  maize,  cocoa,  off-farm  etc.)  impact  different  poverty  causes  (land-poor, 
remoteness, infrastructure poor etc.).  
  Regular knowledge sharing and exchange meetings and workshops.  
  Social media to support knowledge management outcomes.

Final programme design report 
Appendix 6:  Planning, M&E and learning and knowledge management 
567.  For  data  collection,  READ  SI  will  build  on  the  experience  in  the  wider  region  and  introduce 
tablet-based  electronic  data  collection  directly  into  a  centrally  maintained  MIS  system. This  is 
intended  to  reduce  the  time  burden  of  M&E  data  collection  and  also  improve  timeliness  and 
reliability of data in order to make the M&E system more robust and valuable as a management 
tool. 
568.  To support this move to e-M&E, all field staff will be provided with tablets and smartphones to 
facilitate this and efficient group based routine communication e.g. via WhatsApp. 
Learning and knowledge management 
569.  READ SI is the first phase in the scaling-up of the core READ approach and also comes at a 
time  of  increased  investment  by  GoI  in  agriculture  creating  a  strong  demand  for  evidence-
based learning and policy development.  
570.  Given the strong reputation of READ, READ SI is therefore expected by MoA, BAPPENAS and 
others  to  generate  practical  knowledge  of  what  works  (and  what  doesn't  work)  and  how  to 
scale-up  investments  in  the  successful  approaches  on  a  more  programmatic  basis.  Effective 
and  efficient  learning,  knowledge  management  and  communication  are  therefore  central  to 
READ  SI  longer  term  objectives. Accordingly,  READ  SI  will  invest  in  good  quality,  evidence-
based knowledge management in order to contribute to policy development processes.  
571.  A  complimentary  IFAD  grant  of  USD1  million  is  anticipated  to  support  specific  efforts  on 
knowledge management within READ SI and also to contribute to broader policy and strategy 
processes in MoA. The grant will also be available to support policy processes in other aspects 
of MoA beyond immediate relevance to READ SI. (See Component 3) 
572.  Within MoA, part of the grant is expected to support a unit working on knowledge-based policy 
processes  under  the  direction  of  a  senior  MoA  leader,  possibly  the  Secretary  General  (to  be 
confirmed  during  final  design).  READ  SI  will  also  strengthen  institutional  capacity  related  to 
knowledge management and evidence-based policy processes within MoA.  In this context, the 
programme will support targeted institutional strengthening activities these areas. This unit and 
grant activities are expected to be closely linked to the work on policy supported in BAPPENAS 
linked to the IPDMIP project. 
573.  Within READ SI implementation itself, the benchmarking process outlined above will enable the 
programme  to  quickly  identify  examples  of  good  practice  in  different  aspects  of  the  READ 
approach. These examples of good practice can then be quickly document and rolled-out within 
the rest of the programme. READ SI is therefore expected to be able to implement a system of 
continuous improvement. The process of identify and documenting best practice will also be a 
useful source of field evidence to feed into the wider policy processes in MoA.

Financial Management Arrangements 
I. 
Summary of Risk Assessment 
574.  This Financial Management Assessment (FMA) had been prepared in accordance with IFAD’s 
Guidelines for the Financial Management and Analysis of Projects (the Guidelines), publication 
Financial Due Diligence: A Methodology Note, and the Guidance Note on Undertaking Financial 
Management Assessment at Design. This FMA incorporates the Financial Management Internal 
Control  and  Risk  Management  Assessment  required  by  the  Guidelines.  The  purpose  of  this 
FMA  was  to  determine  the  robustness  of  the  accounting,  financial  controls  and  internal  audit 
arrangements, and the capability of the EA and IAs to meet all the fiduciary requirements, which 
are  set  out  in  the  financing  agreement  and  other  Programme  documents.  Annex  2  to  this 
Appendix  presents  the  consolidated  results  of  the  completed  FMA  Questionnaires  from  the 
executing  agencies  (EA)  and  implementing  agencies  (IAs).  This  report  was  prepared  by 
reviewing  documents  and  interviewing  the  staff  of  the  Government  agencies  (AAEHRD  and 
DGAIF of MoA), and also consultants at WISMP-2 NPMO at DGWR of MPW, and Independent 
Monitoring  and  Evaluation  (IME)  Consultant  hired  by  BAPPENAS.  The  reasons  for  the 
discussions  on  WISMP-2  project  were  because:  (i) AAEHRD  will  also  be  one  of  the  national 
implementing  agencies  for  the  agricultural  activities  in  the  new  irrigation  project  (IPDMIP) 
financed by ADB and IFAD, where flow of funds from the national to regional governments will 
use on-granting mechanism and procedures, in which AAEHRD has no prior experience before; 
and (ii) it has been confirmed the READ SI will also use the on-granting mechanism, similar to 
IPDMIP.  
575.  The  significant  strengths  are  that  AAEHRD  as  the  Executing  Agency  and  some  districts  in 
Central  Sulawesi  province  already  have  experience  with  the  successful  READ  project,  where 
de-concentration  and  TP  mechanism  was  used.  The  weaknesses  are  that:  (i)  AAEHRD  and 
some  districts  have  no  prior  experience  in  using  on-granting  mechanism;  (ii)  the  non-READ 
districts may not have experience with IFAD financial procedures which may affect the process 
of  preparation  of  Withdrawal  Applications  (WAs),  hence  the  disbursements.  Under  these 
circumstances, the overall FM risk rating is Medium (M).   
576.  Conclusion.  The  assessments  indicate  that  as  a  whole,  the  prevailing  government  financial, 
accounting,  and  auditing  rules  and  systems  meet  the  generally  acceptable  international 
accounting  and  auditing  standards.  The  Government  has  adequate  internal  control  systems 
and 
financial  reporting  arrangements.  The  Executing  Agency  (AAEHRD)  and  some 
Implementing Agencies  (IAs)  have  worked  in  the  past  with  international  donors  such  as ADB, 
IFAD,  and  the World  Bank,  and  have  implemented  the  international  donors’  financed  projects 
well.  The  overall  performance  of  the  Executing  Agency  and  Implementing  Agencies  in 
implementing  financial  management  of  the  previous  and  ongoing  projects  is  acceptable. 
Mitigating actions  were  identified during  the discussions together  with the above stakeholders 
as summarized in Table 3. 
II. 
Programme financial profile 
577.  The READ-SI programme was costed in 2016 prices and is expected to be implemented over a 
period  of  5  years  from  2018  to  2022.  The  Programme  will  be  implemented  in  a  total  of  18 
Districts in 6 provinces including 4 provinces in Sulawesi as well as West Kalimantan and NTT 
Provinces.  The  Programme  will  focus  on  poor  districts  with  around  354  villages  and  67,400 
households as direct beneficiaries. 
578.  The programme consists of four components:

Agricultural extension services 
Financial services 
Seed supply markets and system 
Cocoa farmer support services and markets 
Livestock production and health services (NTT only) 
(iii)  Component 3: Policy and strategy development support to build the capacity of 
public institutions at the national and district level to generate the information, analysis 
and knowledge required to guide public investment and deliver services in support of 
inclusive rural growth This component will be primarily funded through an IFAD direct 
grant (Hibah Langsung) and implemented under the Directorate of Food and 
Agriculture, BAPPENAS, but managed as an integrated part of READ SI. 
(iv)  Component 4: Programme Management at national, provincial and district levels. 
579.  The  total  programme  costs,  including  physical  and  price  contingencies,  duties  and  taxes  are 
estimated at USD 56.9 million over a five-year implementation period. Programme investments 
are organized into three major components: (i) Village agriculture and livelihoods development 
(57% of the costs); (ii) Services inputs and market linkages (16% of the costs); and (iii) Policy 
Support (2% of the costs). Project Management at national, provincial and district level amounts 
to 25% of the total project cost. 
580.  An  IFAD  loan  will  cover  USD  39.88  million,  or  72.1%,  of  the  total  programme  cost, 
complemented by a grant of USD 1 million (1.8% of total programme cost). The Government of 
Indonesia will contribute USD 9.6 million (17.4%) by financing salaries of all NPMO, provinces, 
districts and sub-districts staff and by  waiving taxes  and  duties. The programme beneficiaries 
are expected to contribute USD 2.6 million (4.7% of the programme cost) - mostly to co-finance 
the purchase of basic and advanced agriculture mechanization under sub-component 1.2 - and 
“private  sector  partners”  –  which  are  companies  investing  on  cocoa-related  activities  -  will 
finance USD 2.2 million, or 4%, of the total programme cost.

Implementing and participating organizations with fiduciary responsibilities 
581.  READ  SI  will  follow  the  implementation  structure  of  READ  and  will  inherit  the  strong 
management foundations that have underpinned READ's success.  
582.  Steering Committee. READ SI will be overseen by a Steering Committee (SC) which will have 
powers to take key decisions on the overall direction of the programme. It is proposed that the 
Steering Committee is Chaired by a senior official of the Ministry of Agriculture and Co-chaired 
by BAPPENAS. Members of the Steering Committee should include representatives of: 
(i) 
Government - Central: Ministry of Villages, Ministry of Home Affairs 
136

(ii)  Government - Sub-national: Representatives of READ SI Provinces and Districts  
(iii)  PPP partners: from cocoa sector and banking sector 
(iv)  Other key implementing partners and stakeholders, such as farmers’ organizations 
583.  For effective work and decision making, members will be appointed for not less than one year 
and total membership of the Steering Committee should not exceed 20 persons. 
584.  Executing  Agency  for  loan  financed  activities  will  be  the  Ministry  of Agriculture  on  behalf  of 
GoI, and the Agency of Agricultural Extension and Human Resource Development (AAEHRD) 
will  be  assigned  as  the  National  Programme  Management  Office  (NPMO)  on  behalf  of  MoA, 
continuing  from  READ,  and  will  be  responsible  for  the  overall  READ  SI  programme 
implementation.  
585.  Ministry of Finance will act as the official Representative of the Government of Indonesia as the 
Borrower/  Recipient.  In  this  role  MoF  will  be  responsible  for:  (i)  Fulfilling  the  government 
fiduciary  oversight  and  management  responsibilities;  and  (ii)  Providing  sufficient  counterpart 
contribution  in  a  timely  manner  to  finance  the  programme  activities,  including  payment  of 
government staff salaries; (iii) Timely processing of WAs, approval of procurement actions and 
other necessary documents according to the agreed operating procedures 
586.  The  NPMO  will  be  led  by  a  Programme  Director  supported  by  two  Deputy  Programme 
Directors.  The  role  of  the  Deputy  Programme  Directors  is  to  provide  overall  coordination  and 
oversight of all programme activities within a number of provinces and ensure adequate senior 
presence and support of the programme management out in the READ SI districts. The NPMO 
will  provide  overall  support  to  the  components.  Technical  specialists  (consultants)  will  be 
contracted centrally by NPMO and operate as an integrated part of the implementation teams, 
hosted by the relevant units at national, provincial, district and sub-district level.  
587.  PPSO (Provincial Programme Support Unit) will be set up in each province with primary focus 
on  programme  administration  functions,  such  as  financial  reporting,  M&E  and  planning.  They 
are considered necessary to provide closer support and backstopping to the DPMOs, and are 
expected to be hosted by the provincial Dinas Pertanian with agricultural extension unit. 
588.  DPMO (District Programme Management Office) will also be set up in each district, responsible 
for the programme implementation in their respective districts. 
589.  A  Policy  Plattform  Secretariat  will  be  set  up  within  the  Directorate  for  Food  and Agriculture  of 
BAPPENAS (implementing agency of grant funded activities). 
590.  Each of the Components have specific implementation arrangements as follow: 
(i) 
(ii) 
Component 1: SETDA will be the coordinator and Dinas Pertanian, that will have 
prime responsibility for programme delivery within their districts with supports from 
relevant technical agencies. 
Component 2: The NPMO will have primary responsibility for delivery of activities 
under the four sub-components.  
(iii)  Component 3: Will be managed and implemented independently by BAPPENAS. 
(iv)  Programme management at NPMO, BAPPENAS, PPSOs and DPMOs. 
591.  Based  on  interviews  during  the  project  design  mission,  MoA,  in  particular  the  AAEHRD,  it 
already has enough experience to implement the donor financed projects from the World Bank, 
UNDP,  and  IFAD,  for  examples  NAEP,  DAFEP,  FEATI,  P4K,  and  READ.  AAEHRD  will  also 
implement  Component  1  of  a  new  irrigation  project  financed  by ADB  and  IFAD  (IPDMIP)  that 
will be started in 2017.

Financial Management Risk Assessment 
Inherent risks: Country issues, Entity Risks, Programme Design 
In 2012 a team of World Bank and other donor staff with close involvement of counterparts form 
the  Government  of 
Indonesia  undertook  a  repeat  Public  Expenditure  and  Financial 
Accountability  (PEFA)  assessment  on  Indonesia  to  update  the  previous  assessment  done  in 
2007,  which  utilized  the  PEFA  measurement  framework.  The  report  focuses  on  the  major 
changes  in  the  performance  of  the  Public  Financial  Management  (PFM)  system from  2007  to 
2011  and  the  on-going  reforms  that  should  impact  an  assessment  in  the  future.  The  report 
indicates  that  Indonesia  has  made  steady  progress  to  strengthen  the  quality  of  PFM  system 
and processes from 2007 to 2011.The average improvements were made in the five of the six 
main categories of the budget cycle which are: (i) the comprehensiveness and transparency of 
the  budget;  (ii)  policy-based  budgeting;  (iii)  predictability  and  control  in  budget  execution;  (iv) 
accounting, recording and reporting; and (v) external audit and scrutiny. 
Improvements  on  the  ratings  reflect  government’s  commitment  to  continue  its  commitment  to 
the reforms set out in the Government White Paper of 2002. The new assessment underlines 
progress  in  the  area  of  budget  execution,  with  the  development  of  a  unified  budget  and  a 
Treasury Single Account (TSA) to strengthen the control over spending and cash management. 
Improvements also have  been made in the coverage of fiscal accounts, accounting  practices, 
payroll,  internal  controls  and  fiscal  risk  management.  The  ongoing  capacity  building  effort  to 
strengthen  internal  and  external  audit  such  as  (i)  the  implementation  of  computerized 
Government  Financial  Management  Information  System  (SPAN)  in  2012,  which  strengthen 
financial  management  capabilities;  (ii)  the  new  procurement  law  and  introduction  of  e-
procurement  and  new  disclosure  policies  are  in  progress.  The  accrual  accounting  system 
(SAIBA) has also been implemented in 2015. 
594.  The  government  has  made  considerable  progress  in  the  legal  and  regulatory  framework  for 
public financial management. Since the enactment of the laws on state finance, state treasury 
and state audit in 2003–2004, most of the regulations underpinning the laws have been issued/ 
promulgated. 
595.  The  government  initiated  a  medium-term  expenditure  framework  (MTEF)  and  performance-
based budgeting (PBB) in 2008, with ongoing efforts to implement them at the sectoral levels. A 
new  program  structure  in  the  government’s  planning  and  budgeting  documents  aligns  the 
government’s  programs  with  organizational  structures,  and  establishes  clearer  lines  of 
accountability for program performance. The establishment of a Treasury Single Account (TSA) 
in  2009  has  improved  cash  management  and  planning.  Implementation  of  an  automated 
financial  management  information  system  (SPAN)  was  started  in  2012  which  permits  direct 
connection  with  line  ministries  and  other  users  of  treasury  resources  to  access  and  process 
financial information, while allowing the Directorate-General of Treasury to meet its obligations 
for treasury management. 
596.  Budget  classification  follows  international  standards  in  accordance  with  the  International 
Monetary Fund government financial statistics. Transparency of the budget has been enhanced 
with the key budget documents now available on the web. Audits by the Supreme Audit Board 
show  an  improvement  in  the  quality  of  government  financial  statements.  A  move  to  accrual 
based  accounting  from  cash-based  accounting  is  ongoing,  with  the  process  expected  to  be 
completed  by  2015.  Government  Regulation/PP  No.  60/2008  clarified  the  role  of  internal 
auditors  (BPKP)  and  required  all  state  institutions  to  implement  the  Government  Internal 
Control System (GICS) for effective, efficient, and accountable management of state funds, and 
reliable reporting. 
597.  Decentralization  was  launched  in  2001.  Law  no.  32  on  Regional  Autonomy,  among  other 
aspects,  outlines  expenditure  responsibilities  by  tier  of  government  and  regulates  procedures 
for the creation of new regional governments. Law no. 33 on Fiscal Balance outlines the system 
138

Final programme design report 
Appendix 7:  Financial management and disbursement arrangements 
of  regional  financing,  including  mechanisms  to  transfer  funds  from  central  to  regional 
governments.  The  government  is  fine-tuning  and  adding  depth  to  the  legal  and  regulatory 
framework (with lower-level regulations and instruments), and strengthening the government’s 
human resource and systems capacity at all levels. 
598.  The  major  country  accountability  issues  affecting  the  country  fiduciary  environment  and  that 
may pose fiduciary risks for the programme are: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
Salaries  for  public  officials,  even  the  most  senior  officials,  are  low  compared  to  the 
private sector. Indonesia’s corruption risk is heightened because the officials receiving 
low wages are working within a decentralized system of licensing. More than 10 years 
ago, Indonesia’s political power became notably decentralized through the legislation 
of the so-called Autonomy Laws. Under these laws, the central government entrusts 
the responsibility for licensing to  the provinces. These laws were intended to reduce 
instances of senior public officials gaining control of lucrative offices. 
In  December  2015  the  Berlin-based  Transparency  International  (TI)  released  its 
annual  Corruption  Perceptions  Index  for  2015  with  Indonesia  sliding  in  the  rankings 
despite  increased  foreign  investment  and  a  bigger  global  profile.    According  to  TI’s 
website,  the  index  “score  countries  on  a  scale  from  0  (highly  corrupt)  to  100  (very 
clean)”.  While  no  country  has  a  perfect  score,  two-thirds  of  the  countries  assessed 
scored  below  50,  indicating  that  there  is  a  serious  problem  of  corruption  in  those 
countries. Indonesia scored 36 on the scale, showing an improvement from score of 
32 in 2012. 
The  assessments  indicate  that  as  a  whole,  the  prevailing  government  financial, 
accounting,  and  auditing  rules  and  systems  meet 
the  generally  acceptable 
international  accounting  and  auditing  standards.  The  Government  has  adequate 
internal control systems and financial reporting arrangements. The EA and IAs have 
worked in the past with International Donor such as World Bank, UNDP and IFAD and 
have implemented well the International funded projects. The overall performance of 
EA and IAs in implementing financial management of the projects is acceptable.

V. Financial Management and Disbursement Arrangements 
Financial management organization and staffing. 
599.  Programme  Financial  Management.  In  each  IA,  programme  staff  will  be  appointed 
which  consist  of  PPK  (project  manager),  a  treasurer,  financial  assistants,  procurement 
staff and technical staff, with clear job description for key  programme positions. The staff 
appointment  letters  will  be  issued  by  the  respective  Head  of  the  Implementing  Agency 
prior to  negotiations.  If  necessary,  some  specialists/consultants  and  contract  staff  will  be 
recruited. Procurement is usually handled by a procurement unit (ULP) in the agency.  The 
programme’s  financial  management  arrangement  will  generally  follow  the  government 
systems but with consideration of IFAD rules and regulations in relation with disbursement 
documentation,  procurement  and  audit.    Due  to  the  inexperience  of  some  of  the 
programme staff to-be with implementing programmes financed by IFAD, particularly at the 
district  level,  particular  attention  is  necessary  to  ensure  special  provisions  for  capacity 
building/training  in  finance  and  procurement  at  NPMO,  PPSOs  and  DPMOs. To  ease  the 
preparation  of  IFAD  financial  reports  and  data  gathering,  it  is  also  recommended  to 
develop  a  standard  format  that  is  user  friendly  and  able  to  quickly  respond  to  queries  on 
components,  categories  of  expenditures,  procurement  process,  status  of  expenditures  at 
central and districts level and contract management. 
600.  Budgeting.  The  programme  budgeting  procedure  will  follow  the  a n n u a l   government 
budgeting  system  and  process  that  are  stipulated  at  National  and  Sub-National  Level 
respectively.. The budget of the programme at national level will be a part of the MoA and 
BAPPENAS  budgets  and  included  in  the  government  budget  document  (DIPA).  On 
granting mechanism will be applied for programme budgets at provincial and district levels 
where  a  pre-financing  agreement  with  local  governments  will  be  established  between 
Directorate  General  of  Fiscal  Balance,  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Head  of  Provincial  or  District 
Government (Governor/Bupati/District Mayor).  
At  4th  quarter  of  financial  year,  the  EA  (NPMO)  is  required  to  submit  the  national AWPB  and 
Procurement Plan for the following  year for No Objection  by IFAD. The NPMO  will coordinate 
with the Province and District Level to consolidate the AWPB that consists of: (i) the plans from 
each District, primarily covering Component 1; (ii) plans associated with each of the four sub-
components  under  Component  2;  (iii)  plans  for  overall  management  of  READ  SI;  and  (iv)  for 
Component  3  which  are  mainly  supported  by  IFAD  Grant,  the  AWPB  will  be  prepared 
separately  by  the  relevant  implementing  unit  teams  at  BAPPENAS.  The  consolidated AWPB 
and Procurement Plan will be submitted by the Programme Director to IFAD for No Objection.. 
Disbursement Arrangements and Flow of Funds 
601.  Flow  of  Funds  Procedures.  For  activities  implemented  at  provincial  and  district  levels, 
the  flow  of  fund  for  the  programme  will  follow  the  general  loan  scheme  for  on  granting 
mechanism  following  the  Minister  of  Finance’s  Regulation  No.  188/2012  (PMK  No. 
188/PMK.07//2012).  The  Ministry  of  Agriculture/AAEHRD  as  the  Executing  Agency  (with 
the  NPMO  assuming  the  key  responsibility)  will  be  responsible  for  the  programme 
financially  and  will  manage  programme  funds.  At  Sub-National  levels,  
l o c a l  
g o v e r n m e n t   w i l l   e s t a b l i s h   P P S O s   and  DPMOs  through  local  government’s 
decree  (Surat  Keputusan/SK)  and  will  be  directly  accountable  to  the  Directorate 
General of Fiscal Balance, MoF.   
t h e  
602.  After  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government  through  Ministry  of  Finance  will  open  a 
Designated or Special Accounts (SA) nominated in USD, in the name of the Ministry of Finance 
(MoF) at Bank Indonesia (BI), for the IFAD loan funds. As for the IFAD grant funds, since it will 
be off treasury, the Directorate for Food and Agriculture, BAPPENAS will open an account in a 
government-owned  commercial  bank  and  register  it  to  MoF.  Funds  in  both  accounts  will  be 
used to pay for eligible Programme expenses incurred by the NPMO, BAPPENAS, PPSOs and

DPMOs. The modalities of the special accounts for the IFAD funds will be detailed in the Letter 
to the Borrower, which would be issued by IFAD. MoF will administer the special accounts. The 
IFAD loan and grant proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with IFAD’s Loan Disbursement 
Handbook (LDH). 
603.  In  general,  there  will  be  three  types  of  disbursement  mechanisms  for  the  programme  which 
consist  of  (i)  Advance  Withdrawal;  (ii)  Direct  Payment;  (iii)  Reimbursement.  The  programme 
flow of funds is illustrated in Figure 1 of Annex 1. 
604.  The flow of funds for the programme, determined by the implementation strategies adopted by 
the sub-national Implementing Agencies will be reimbursement for activities implemented under 
the pre-financing agreements where on-granting mechanism is used and the fund flow which is 
validated  by  a  systemic  verification  of  the  various  expenditures  against  approved  plans  and 
budget (illustrated by Figure 2 of Annex 1). 
605.  Considering the types of activities that will be implemented in  READ SI programme, it is likely 
that most, if not all, the disbursement will use replenishment of SA mechanism. 
Internal Controls. 
606.  Internal control in general needs to be improved. Based on audit reports of IFAD’s projects 
in Indonesia, although the auditors’ opinions are of unqualified opinion, however, they still 
often  observed  over  payments  (mostly  at  the  district  level)  due  to  weak  internal  controls, 
lack  of  disciplines,  and limited knowledge  on financial  procedures  which resulted that  the 
IAs have to pay back the over payments to the State Treasury Office (KPPN). 
607.  Draft  Programme  Implementation  Manual (PIM)  will be  available  prior to negotiations and 
will be revised or improved as needed during programme implementation. 
608.  Before  the  submission  of  the  first  withdrawal  application,  the  Borrower  will  submit  to  IFAD 
sufficient evidence of the authority of the person(s) who will sign the withdrawal applications on 
behalf of the Borrower, together with the authenticated specimen signatures of each authorized 
person. The minimum value per  withdrawal  application is  USD 100,000 or such  other amount 
as  IFAD  may  designate  in  an  advice  to  the  borrower  from  time  to  time.  The  borrower  is  to 
consolidate  claims  to  meet  this  limit  for  reimbursement  and  special  account(s)  claims.  IFAD 
reserve the right not to accept WAs below the minimum amount. 
609.  The  NPMO  will  be  responsible  for  preparing  the  annual  disbursement  projections,  timely 
preparation  of  withdrawal  applications,  and  timely  submission  of  withdrawal  applications  to 
IFAD.  PPSOs  and  DPMOs  are  responsible  for  collecting  supporting  documents  for  the 
programme expenditures they have incurred and compile these as expenditure evidences to be 
reviewed by NPMO for reimbursement request to MoF, and the NPMO is responsible to compile 
all expenditure evidences to be used as supporting documents for withdrawal application.  
610.  The  NPMO/AAEHRD  is  assigned  to  demand  all  PPSOs  and  DPMOs  to:  (a)  in  the  annual 
budget  preparations assign budgetary  allocations in the DPA  in  line  with the  approved AWPs, 
and (b) to require all PPSO and DPMOs to submit their payment evidence in a timely manner 
for  verification  and  subsequent  reimbursement  (in  principle  not  later  than  2  months  after 
payment).  
611.  All  PPKs  are  responsible  for  monitoring  procurements  and  managing  the  payments  for 
procured works, goods or services. The payments at the provincial and district levels are made 
by the respective local government treasury office (Kantor Perbendaharaan dan Kas Daerah – 
KPKD) at the request of PPK and following the approval by the budget holders. The fund will be 
transferred to budget holders (PA/KPA) through the regular government budgets.  
612.  Statement  of  Expenditure  (SOE)  The  SOE  procedure  may  be  used  for  reimbursement  of 
eligible  expenditure  and  liquidation  of  advances  to  the  special  account(s). The  SOE  ceiling  is 
USD 50,000 equivalent per individual payment. SOE records should be maintained and made

readily available for review by the joint Government of Indonesia and IFAD review missions or 
upon IFAD's request for submission of supporting documents on a sampling basis. 
In  conformance  with  Financial  Minister’s  Regulation  (PERMENKEU  No.  188/PMK.07/2012), 
loan proceeds for regional governments (provinces and districts) will be made available through 
“On-Granting Agreements” (OGA) or Perjanjian Hibah between the Ministry of Finance and the 
head of the concerned regional  administration. These OGA  will cover the funding of the  loan-
funded  activities  at  the  sub-national  level.    An  innovation  under  the  READ  SI  will  be  the 
establishment of a mechanism (and provision of technical support) to process re-imbursements 
directly  at the  Provincial  level (through the Provincial  KPPN office) rather than at the Central-
level. It is foreseen that under the READ SI, for each administrative level, a two-staged process 
for  establishing  “on-granting”  agreements  (OGA)  will  be  observed  between  the  Ministry  of 
Finance  (MoF)  and  the  respective  regional  administration.  A  preliminary  OGA  will  be 
established  at  programme  start-up  based  on  cost  estimates  (see  Table  1  of  Appendix  9  on 
Programme Costs and Financing) for Components 1 and 2 activities per province and district, 
mainly covering IFAD funded activities and some start-up funds for the agricultural component. 
A second (or amended) OGA will be made after the overall program work plan budget (OWPB) 
has been submitted by the sub-national implementing at Province and Districts concerned and 
approved by the SC-MoA. 
614.  The following procedures or mechanism will be applied for entering into an OGA: 
(i) 
(ii) 
After  Loan  Agreement  signing,  AAEHRD  (NPMO),  will  request  to  the  Directorate 
General of Fiscal Balance (DGFB), MoF to issue a MoF decree on loan allocation to 
be made available for local governments based on evaluation. 
After  issuance  of  the  decree,  AAEHRD/NPMO  will  establish  for  every  participating 
administrative level (districts and province) an initial estimate for performance targets 
and related fund allocation to be confirmed by the participating administrative level. 
(iii)  After the concerned administrative government has confirmed the performance target 
and  related  fund  allocation,  DGRD  (MoHA)  will  request  to  each  participating  district 
and  province  to  prepare  a  formal  request  to  MoF  through  the  EA  for  the  concerned 
on-granting amount.  
(iv)  After  issuance  of  these  decrees,  DGFB  (MoF)  will  prepare  the  formal  on-granting 
agreements between MoF and the provincial/district governments, which indicate the 
total  loan  amount  to  be  made  available  for  all  initial  start-up  activities,  including 
assessment, and the drafting of the OWBP. 
(v)  Relevant provincial/district agencies will assign the SKPDs to prepare the budget for 
the first year. 
(vi)  DGFB in close coordination with AAEHRD (NPMO) and DGRD will prepare the work 
and  budget  plan  of  on-granting  (RKA-HPD)  which  then  will  be  submitted  to  DGT  to 
produce a DIPA-HPD.  
(vii) 
In the first year all participating administrations will prepare a comprehensive OWBP 
for endorsement by the SC. 
(viii)  For any amendment to the OGA, the following procedures will be applied: 
  After endorsement by SC  of the OWPB the AAEHRD (NPMO) will request to the 
Directorate General of Fiscal Balance (DGFB), MoF, to issue a decree of Minister of 
Finance  on  loan  re-allocation  to  be  made  available  for  local  governments  based  on 
the values as included in the OWPB.  
  After  issuance  of  these  decrees,  DGFB  will  amend  the  formal  on-granting 
agreements  between  MoF  and  the  provincial  and  district  governments.  Relevant 
143 
Republic of Indonesia 
Rural Empowerment and Agricultural Development Programme Scaling-up Initiative (READ SI) 
Final programme design report 
Appendix 7:  Financial management and disbursement arrangements 
provincial  and  district  agencies  will  assign  their  SKPDs  to  prepare  AWPs  based  on 
the approved comprehensive OWP for endorsement by SC and approved by IFAD. 
  DGFB  in  close  coordination  with  AAEHRD  (NPMO)  and  DGRD  will  prepare  the 
work and budget plan of on-granting (RKA-HPD) which then will be submitted to DGT 
to produce a DIPA-HPD.  
  In parallel, the provincial and district governments will issue their own DPA-SKPD. 
  With  the  amended  OGA,  the  participating  administrative  units  have  a  guarantee 
that  activities  as  foreseen  in  the  OWPB  and  included  in  the  approved  AWP  for  the 
pre-agreed  percentages  can  be  reimbursed  for  under  the  loans  after  having 
verification.    
(ix)  For the implementation of the programme in each participating district or province, an 
overall  work  plan  and  budget  (OWPB)  will  be  prepared  by  the  involved  regional 
administrations. These OWPB comprise the following details: (i) the kind of activities; 
(ii) it’s impact; (iii) its contribution to the loan performance indicators (if applicable); (iv) 
the year(s) of implementation; (v) the total costing; and (vi) which part of the costs are 
charged from the loan and which part to other financing sources, 
(x) 
After the OWPB for each district and or province has been endorsed by SC, for each 
participating administrative level (district, province, central) it will be used as basis for 
their:  (1)  annual  financial  planning;  and  (2)  after  implementation  for  reimbursement. 
AWPB  (including  Procurement  Plan)  prepared  by  each  agency/SKPD  will  be 
consolidated  by  NPMO  and  submitted  to  IFAD  for  No  Objection,  as  the  eligibility  of 
expenditures in submitting WAs will be verified against the approved AWPBs.  
(xi)  Once the first OGA is effective, the SKPD will start implementing their activities. The 
first  step  to  be  done  is  to  include  the  AWP  activities  in  the  local  DPA  program  for 
endorsement  by  the  district/  provincial  APBD  as  the  activities  first  have  to  be  pre-
financed by the districts using their own financial resources (dana talangan) The local 
government  will  request  their  local  treasurer  to  use  budget  available  in  the  local 
government’s  general  treasurer  account.  This  procedure  or  mechanism  is  illustrated 
in Figure 2 of Annex 1. 
Accounting Policies and Procedures 
615.  Financial 
IAs 
(NPMO)  and 
transactions,  covering  both  AAEHRD 
(including  OGAs) 
expenditures,  will  be  recorded  in  the  government  accounting  system  and  included  in 
government accountability reports. The programme's staffing will include financial specialist and 
supported with suffice finance officer and assistants to manage the accounting requirements of 
the  programme. As  well  as managing  the  overall  accounting  system,  the  financial  officers  will 
also be responsible for ensuring adequacy of financial   records and verification of expenditures 
at national and sub-national level. The AAEHRD (NPMO) will prepare: (i) separate consolidated 
project  financial  statements  reports  suitable  for  programme  monitoring  purposes,  and  (ii) 
aggregate  financial  reports  and  submit  them  to  IFAD  on  a  six  monthly  basis  using  an  agreed 
format.  In  the  first  year  of  programme  implementation,  The  AAEHRD  (NPMO)  shall  also 
prepare  consolidated  financial  statements  of  the  operations,  resources  and  expenditures 
related  to  the  programme  in  respect  of  each  Fiscal  Year  to  be  delivered  to  IFAD  within  two 
months of the end of such period. 
Reporting, Auditing and Public Disclosure 
616.  Auditing  Requirements.  The  AAEHRD  will  cause  the  detailed  consolidated  programme 
accounts  to  be  audited  in  accordance  with  International  Standards  on Auditing  by  an  auditor 
acceptable  to  IFAD.  The  audited  programme  financial  statements  will  be  submitted  in  the 
English  language  to  IFAD  within  six  (6)  months  of  the  end  of  the  fiscal  year  by  the  EA.  The 
144 
Republic of Indonesia 
Rural Empowerment and Agricultural Development Programme Scaling-up Initiative (READ SI) 
Final programme design report 
Appendix 7:  Financial management and disbursement arrangements 
annual audit report will include a separate audit opinion on the use of the special account, SOE 
procedures  and  financial  loan  covenants.  The  Government  has  been  made  aware  of  IFAD’s 
policy  on  delayed submission,  and the requirements for satisfactory  and acceptable quality  of 
the audited programme financial statements. IFAD reserves the right to verify the programme's 
financial  statements  to  confirm  that  the  share  of  IFAD’s  financing  is  used  in  accordance  with 
IFAD’s  policies  and  procedures.  IFAD  requires  that  the  programme  accounts  be  audited  (by 
approved  independent  auditors)  in  accordance  with  auditing  standards  consistent  with  IFAD 
Guidelines for Project Audits (for Borrower’s use).  
617.  Auditors will express an opinion on the annual consolidated financial statements and determine 
whether  programme  funds  have  been  correctly  accounted  for  and  have  been  used  in 
accordance  with  the  financing  agreements.  They  will  also  determine  the  adequacy  of 
supporting documents and controls on the use of Statement of Expenditures (SOEs) as a basis 
for  disbursement.  The  auditors  will  also  furnish  a  separate  Management  Letter,  which  will 
identify any material weakness in accounting and internal controls at all levels and report on the 
degree  of  compliance  with  financial  covenants  of  the  IFAD  Financing Agreement,  including  a 
review of the procurement of goods, works and consultant services. 
618.  The EA  will engage Government audit services to  audit the consolidated  programme financial 
statements  annually  and  the  audit  of  the  programme  EA's/IA's.  The  EA  will  submit  to  IFAD 
certified  copies  of  audited  annual  programme  financial  statements  as  well  as  the  auditor’s 
report  and  the  management  letter  within  six  (6)  months  of  each  financial  year-end  during 
implementation.  The  terms  of  reference  (ToR)  of  auditors  have  been  used  by  the  auditors  in 
other  IFAD’s  projects,  and  the  Government  audit  services  will  allocate  adequate  budget  to 
properly audit the programme. 
619.  Each  IA  at  national,  provincial  and  district  levels  is  responsible  for  preparing 
programme financial statements at latest one month after the end of the considered fiscal 
year. These IA’s financial statements will then be consolidated by the NPMO at latest two 
months  after  the  end  of  fiscal  year  and  sent  to  IFAD.  The  financial  statements  will  be 
audited  on  an  annual  basis  by  the  national  auditing  body  and  in  accordance  with  agreed 
terms of reference. 
620.  Compliance with financial reporting and auditing requirements will be monitored by review 
missions and during normal program supervision, and followed up regularly with all concerned, 
including  the  external  auditor.  The  Government,  the  EA  and  IAs  have  been  made  aware  of 
IFAD’s  policy  on  delayed  submission,  and  the  requirements  for  satisfactory  and  acceptable 
quality of the APFSs.  IFAD reserves the right to require a change in the auditor (in a manner 
consistent with the constitution of the borrower), or for additional support to be provided to the 
auditor, if the audits required are not conducted in a manner satisfactory to IFAD, or if the audits 
are substantially delayed. IFAD reserve the right to verify the programme's financial accounts to 
confirm  that  the  share  of  IFAD's  financing  is  used  in  accordance  with  IFAD  policies  and 
procedures.

624.  A Mid-Term Review (MTR) mission will be jointly conducted by GoI and IFAD around the end of 
Year 3 of the programme, or earlier if required. MTR mission is a means to improve the quality 
and relevance of the programme and their implementation and to identify re-orientation to the 
programming that may be needed to ensure the achievement of the original objectives. It may 
also help identify components of the programme that would benefit from a follow up outside the 
programme  or  in  the  following  programming.  Loan  and/or  grant  fund  re-allocation  may  be 
necessary to adjust the changes.

New  regulations  and a  National  Public  Procurement  Agency  (LKPP) have recently 
been  introduced,  though  it  is  likely  to  take  time  to  be  able  to  verify  significant 
improvements in performance. 
626. 
Improvements in public procurement have taken place over the past few  years.  Keppres No. 
80/2003 provided a national public procurement regulation that meets most of what is generally 
regarded  as  accepted  international  practice,  including  basic  principles:  transparency,  open 
competition, economy and  efficiency.  This  Decree  also  paved  the  way  for  establishing  a  
regulatory   body   for   public procurement, and  established the basis for sanctions, complaint-
handling and requirements for certification of users. 
627.  Perpres No. 106/2007 was signed in December 2007 establishing an independent agency, the 
Lembaga  Kebijakan  Pengadaan  Barang/Jasa  Pemerintah  (LKPP)  or  National  Public 
Procurement Agency. LKKP is responsible for sustainable, integrated, focused and coordinated 
planning and development of strategies/policies/regulations associated with the procurement of 
goods/works/services using public funds. LKKP reports directly to the President.  
628.  The LKPP has been working on several fronts to improve the public procurement reform. Some 
of  the  accomplishments  and  activities,  in  addition  to  other  reform  measures,  that  have  been 
achieved  over  the  last  two  years,  include:  i)  consolidation  of  Kepres  80/2003  and  its 
amendments in 2009: ii) issuing of a new presidential regulation Perpres 54/2010, effective as 
of January 2011;  iii) issuing  a set of national standard bidding documents; iv) drafting a new 
procurement  law  ;  v)  increasing  the  use  of  e-tendering;  and  vi)  establishing  procurement 
service units. The reforms cover procurement of goods and services by all government entities 
(including line ministries, local governments, the Central Bank, State Owned Enterprises, Local 
Government  owned  Enterprises,  State  Owned  Legal  Entities  [BHMN]  and  other  related 
government    institutions).    The    Regulation    (54/2010)    is    supplemented    by    various    other 
Regulation such Perpres 70/12, Prepres 84/2012 and Prepres 4/2015); decrees  and circulars 
issued by MDAs. 
629.  The    Regulation    outlines    procedures    for    submitting    and  addressing    complaints    on  the  
procurement process.  Complaints  generally  appear  to  be  resolved  in  a  timely  manner,  except 
when  taken  to  a  higher  level    or    when    legal    recourse    is    sought.    All    complaints    are  
received  by  the  tender  committee (procurement units under new regulation) and are referred 
to a higher authority within the spending agency. While under the new regulation, a complainant 
can copy the LKPP, the final decision will still be within the agency. As it currently stands, this 
process lacks sufficient independence as there are no members drawn from the private sector 
and  civil  society.  The  operation  of  the  complaints  system  may  also  be  weakened  by  the 
absence  of  public disclosure  of  data  on complaints  received  and resolved. Complainants  may 
use an arbitration process or seek redress through the judicial system.

From January 2011, the new PP(54/2010) is applicable for

the Borrower’s National Procurement Laws and Regulations (Perpres 54/2010, Perpres 70/12, 
Prepres  84/2012  and  Prepres  4/2015)  and  their  amendments  consistent    with  IFAD's  Project

procedures  outlined in the  current law  and regulations to facilitate procurement which  are still 
constrained by delays. The use of the e-procurement which includes the e-catalogue systems 
and online shopping would be applicable in the programme for goods and materials. 
631.  As  per  IFAD’s  Procurement  Guidelines,  IFAD  review  of  and  no  objection  to  the  Project 
Procurement  Plans  shall  be  compulsory,  and  any  changes  and  amendments  to  the 
procurement  plan  shall  be  subject  to  IFAD’s  No  Objection;  the  plans  submitted  by  NMPO

632.  Procurement  of  all  major  service  providers  (consultancies  of  firms/organisation)  would  be 
undertaken centrally to mitigate risk associated with decentralised procurement in terms of the 
quality and timeliness of the procurement process.  
633. 
 All procurement of goods, works and services financed from IFAD funds under the programme 
shall  require  the  inclusion  of  a  provision  requiring  suppliers,  contractors  and  consultants  to

Appendix 9:  Programme costs and financing  
A. 
Introduction 
642. 
This  annex  covers  the  programme  costs  and  financing  plan,  while  it  also  describes  the 
assumptions underlying them and sets out the basis and details of the estimated programme 
costs. 
B.  Programme costs and financing 
Main assumptions 
643. 
The programme is financed over a five-year period, and it is assumed to start in 2018. Costs 
have been estimated on the basis of prices prevailing during programme design in July 2016. 
644.  Price  contingencies.  Price  contingencies  have  been  applied  on  all  costs  except  for 
unallocated amounts.  
645. 
Inflation: In January 2016 the Bank of Indonesia (BI) started a monetary policy46 easing cycle 
by  making  three  consecutive  monthly  25-basis-point  cuts  to  its  benchmark  interest  rate,  to 
stand  at  6.75%47  in  March,  before  leaving  the  rate  on  hold  at  its  latest  meeting  in  May. 
According  to  the  Economist  Intelligence  Unit,  further  cuts,  “totalling  50  basis  points”,  are 
expected  in  2016-2017.  Consequently,  consumer  prices  are  expected  to  rise  on  annual 
average of 4.6% between 2016 and 202048. 
646. 
For the purpose of this analysis, annual local inflation rates have been set at 5% on the first 
year  and  decreased  up  to  4.5%  in  the  following  years.  For  foreign  inflation,  an  average 
inflation of 1.8% has been retained.  
647.  Exchange rate. The exchange rate used in this analysis has been set at 13000 IDR/USD. 
648. 
649. 
Taxes and duties.  Part  of the Government co-financing of the programme will  be  in form of 
waiving  of  all  taxes  and  duties  on  goods  and  services  procured  under  the  programme.  The 
rates  and  amounts  of  the  taxes  and  duties  in  the  programme’s  costs  presented  below  are 
defined only to determine the Government contribution and to value the total programme cost. 
The  items  to  be  imported  for  the  programme  attract  import  and  excise  duties  of  varying 
proportions, and a value-added tax (VAT) of 10% is levied on all imported goods. Currently, the 
VAT rate in the country is 10% and applies to all investment and operating costs used  for the 
programme (including contractual services, training and studies).  
Programme costs 
650.  The  total  programme  costs,  including  physical  and  price  contingencies,  duties  and  taxes  are 
estimated  at  USD  55.32  million  over  a  five-year  implementation  period.  Programme  costs  by 
components are summarized in Table 1,  while a complete set costs tables are presented in  in 
the  attachment  of  this  annex.  Programme  investments  are  organized  into  three  major 
components: (i) Village agriculture and livelihoods development (57% of the costs); (ii) Services 
inputs and market linkages (16% of the costs); and (iii) Policy Support (2% of the costs). Project 
Management at national, provincial and district level amounts to 25% of the total project cost.  
651.  Programme  financing49.  An  IFAD  loan  will  cover  USD  39.88  million,  or  72.1%,  of  the  total 
programme  cost,  complemented  by  a  grant  of  USD  1  million  (1.8%  of  total  programme  cost). 
The  GoI  will  contribute  USD  9.6  million  (17.4%)  by  financing  salaries  of  all  NPMO,  provinces, 
districts  and  sub-districts  staff  and  by  waiving  taxes  and  duties.  The  programme  beneficiaries

Appendix 9:  Programme costs and financing 
are expected to contribute USD 2.6 million (4.7% of the programme cost) - mostly to co-finance 
the purchase of basic and advanced agriculture mechanization under sub-component 1.2 - and 
“private  sector  partners”  –  which  are  companies  investing  on  cocoa-related  activities  -  will 
finance USD 2.2 million, or 4%, of the total programme cost.  
652. 
653. 
The  IFAD  grant  will  finance  policy  activities  under  component  3.  The  private  sector 
contribution50 will co-finance – together with the IFAD loan - cocoa-related activities under sub-
component 1.2 and sub-component 2.4. 
The estimate of taxes and duties was based on the rates in effect prevailing at the time of the 
design.  In  conformity  with  the  principle  that  no  taxes  or  duties  will  be  financed  out  of  the 
proceeds of the IFAD loan/grant, any future changes in tax legislation will have to apply to the 
programme.

accounts  per  year  is  shown  in  table  2  and  a  summary  of  the  total  costs  by  disbursement 
accounts  and  financier  is  presented  in  table  3.  Financial  management  and  procurement 
procedures, including the coordination of flow of funds, are described in Appendices 7 and 8.

Appendix 10:  Economic and Financial Analysis 
Appendix 10: Economic and Financial Analysis 
655.  A  financial  and  economic  analysis  was  undertaken  to  assess  the  financial  impacts  of  the 
programme on farmers and on the society as a whole. Building on the success of READ, READ 
SI  programme  objective  is  to  individually  and  collectively  empower  rural  households  with  the 
skills,  confidence  and  resources  to  sustainably  improve  their  farm  and  non-farm  incomes  and 
livelihoods.  
656.  Benefits  are  expected  to  derive  from  (i)  community  mobilization,  (ii)  village  agriculture  and 
livelihoods  development,  (iii)  improved  services,  inputs  and  market  linkages,  including 
enhanced  financial  services,  and  (iv)  improved  nutrition.  In  order  to  represent  the  programme 
financial benefits, six representative financial models were developed. These models were also 
used as building blocks for the economic analysis. 
657.  The Programme will  be  implemented in around  18  districts within  six provinces, of  which  four 
are located in the Sulawesi Island, one in NTT, and one in West Kalimantan. 
658.  Number of beneficiaries. The programme target  groups are: (i) the poor and near poor who 
have the potential to generate economic returns from agriculture with programme support; and 
(ii)  landless  and  land-poor,  including  women-headed  households,  who  will  be  included  in 
activities  directed  at  homestead  gardening,  improved  nutrition  and  financial  literacy.  The 
programme  is  expected  to  benefit  about  337,000  direct  beneficiaries  or  67,400  households, 
assuming  an  average  household  size  of  five  members.    About  50%  of  the  total  programme 
beneficiaries  are  expected  to  be  women.  A  summary  of  the  total  number  of  beneficiaries  by 
activity,  and  their  expected  phasing  in,  is  shown  in  the  table  2  under  the  economic  analysis 
section. 
FINANCIAL ANALYSIS 
659.  The  primary  objective  of  the  financial  analysis  is  to  determine  the  financial  viability  and 
incentives of the target group for engaging in the programme activities, by examining the impact 
of  programme  interventions  on  family  labour,  cash  flow  and  net  incomes.  Based  on  field 
research and IFAD previous programme READ, from which READ SI will scale up, a number of 
indicative  economic  activities  were  identified  during  the  programme  design  process.  Five 
illustrative  crop  models  and  one  livestock  model  were  prepared  to  demonstrate  the  financial 
viability of the investments: (i) cocoa crop model, (ii) cocoa partly rehabilitated crop model, (iii) 
paddy paddy crop model, (iv) chilli crop model, (v) copra crop model, (vi) goats livestock model. 
These models form the building blocks for the economic analysis.  A cash-flow analysis is finally 
carried out to present the “with” and “without”  programme analysis. Summary results from the 
financial models are presented in Table A1, at the end of this section. 
660.  Key  assumptions.  The  following  information  gathered  during  the  final  design  missions  has 
been used to set up the analyses: interviews with farmers, mission estimates, documents and 
surveys  from  IFAD  READ  programme.  In  particular,  information  on  labour  and  input 
requirements  for  various  operations,  capital  costs,  prevailing  wages,  yields,  farm  gate  and 
market  prices  of  commodities,  input  and  farm-to-market  transport  costs  were  collected. 
Conservative assumptions  were made both for inputs and outputs in  order to take account of 
possible risks. 
661.  Exchange rate. The exchange rate used in the analysis is fixed at 1 USD = 13000 IDR. 
662.  Prices. The  financial  prices  for  programme  inputs  and  products  were  collected  in  the  field  by 
the  design  team.  All  the  information  on  labour  requirements  for  various  production  models, 
prevailing  wage  rates,  yields,  input  use,  farm  gate  and  market  prices  of  the  products,  input 
prices were collected. Prices used represent estimates of the average seasonal prices and the 
analysis is carried out using constant prices.

663.  Labour.  Family  labour  has  been  valued  both  in  financial  and  economic  analysis.  It  has  been 
assumed  that  farm  labour  is  mainly  provided  by  the  households.  Hired  labour  (unskilled)  and 
family labour are priced at IDR 75,000 per day, which is the prevailing market rate. 
664.  Opportunity cost of capital. A discount rate of 12% has been used in this analysis to assess 
the  viability  and  robustness  of  the  investments  in  order  to  consider  the  profitability  of  the 
foreseen investments with  market alternatives. The selected value  is calculated by taking into 
account actual market interest rate on loans51. 
665.  Crop models.  All five crop models and the livestock model are presented over a period of 10 
years.  Positive  profitability  indicators,  before  and  after  financing,  are  shown  to  be  positive 
confirming  that  improved  agro-business  skills, market  linkages,  access  to  inputs  and  financial 
services,  would  lead to an  increase in net income and to positive NPV, IRR and B/C ratio, as 
well as to improved nutrition. A summary of the financial models is presented in table 1 below. 
Each model is also more thoroughly presented hereinafter. 
Table A1. Summary of crop and livestock models 
666.  Cacao  crop  model.  This  model  presents  a  situation  without  programme  (WOP)  intervention 
and a situation with programme (WP) intervention, on a land size of 1ha. Cacao is an important 
cash crop grown mainly in lowlands but also in parts of uplands. Currently most of cacao trees 
suffer  from  the  pod  borer  disease.  Farmers  have  limited  knowledge  about  pest  control,  farm 
level  post-harvest  processing  and  crop  care  practices.  In  addition,  many  farmers  use  cheap 
fertilizers,  which  should  instead  be  used  for  other  crops,  and  apply  them  in  wrong  quantities. 
Mainly for these reasons, the WOP shows very low yields - on average 320 kg per ha/year. The 
WP  scenario  presents  much  higher  yields52  due  to  improved  management/agronomic  skills  – 
achieved  through  specific  trainings  -  and  use  of  cocoa  high  quality  inputs  packages53.    The 
financing analysis shows that the farmer has access to a programme grant, which on the first 
year will provide the farmer with an input starter package54. 
667.  Cacao crop model with rehabilitation of 30% of the plants.  This model presents the same 
WOP scenario of the cacao crop model, but it includes an extra investment in the WP. Indeed, 
yields are expected to get up to 970 kg, as 30% of the plants are supposed to be re-habilitated 
and therefore to give higher yields from the fourth year on. The financing analysis is carried out 
in  order  to  show  that  the  farmer  will  finance  the  first  year  of  negative  income  after  labour 
through an input starter package grant and facilitated access to a loan55 .  
668.  Paddy  crop  model.  This  model  presents  a  situation  without  programme  (WOP)  intervention 
and a situation with programme (WP) intervention, on a land size of 0.5 ha. In the WP scenario, 
households attend farmer field schools and mechanization trainings to enhance their skills and

are given access to a starter inputs package – including genetically improved seeds. Moreover, 
they receive small equipment56, such as storage drums for seeds, scales and moisture metres, 
and access to mechanization57. The financing analysis shows that the household will be able to 
finance the negative income after labour through access to programme grants and beneficiaries 
own contribution to mechanization58. 
669.  Chili crop model. Chili has been taken as a representative crop for homestead garden59. This 
model  presents  a  situation  WOP  and  a  situation  WP.  In  order  not  to  obtain  overoptimistic 
results,  the  WOP  is  assumed  to  be  foregone  income  while,  in  the  WP,  households  and 
especially  women  are  supported  to  cultivate  with  vegetables  at  least  0.1  ha  of  land,  which  is 
usually  unused  land  next  by  the  house.  Most  of  the  yields  are  used  for  self-consumption,  as 
homestead garden principally aims at improving households’ nutrition, and a small part of it is 
sold  to  the  market  generating  a  small  source  of  income.    The  model  shows  positive  income 
before  and  after  family  labour,  already  from  the  first  year. A  net  benefits  liquidity60  analysis  is 
also  presented  to  show  the  net  revenue  from  sales  -  after  that  non  real  disbursements,  like 
family labour and costs covered by the grant61, are deducted.  
670.  Copra  crop  model.  This  model  presents  a  situation  without  programme  (WOP)  intervention 
and a situation with programme (WP) intervention, on a land size of 1ha. In the WOP, farmers 
have  limited  knowledge  about  pest  control,  farm  level  post-harvest  processing  and  crop  care 
practices such as side-grafting; this results in low yields - on average 1500 kg per ha/year. The

investments in replacement of old trees (tall variety), post-harvest drying facility and equipment

order to show the farmer liquidity, net of family labour and copra drying facility costs63.

671.  Goat  livestock  model.  The  READ  approach  is  to  provide  10  members  of  a  20  member 
livestock group with three 2 years breeding females each. These 10 members will have the use 
of and responsibility for their animals for 3 kidding cycles (typically around 18-20 months). After 
3 kiddings, the member will keep all progeny as their own and “pass the gift” of breeding stock 
onto  the  next  10  members.  The  WOP  shows  that  households  owns  between  two  and  three 
goats as a starting stock. However, the mortality rate gets up to 10% because farmers do not 
provide  adequate  housing,  vaccinations  and  integration  of  food  to  the  animals.  Most  of  the 
goats are kept for self-consumption.  Each female goat gives birth to at least 1 kid. Goats are 
mostly  used  for  self-consumption  and  occasionally  sold.  In  the  WP,  it  is  shown  that  the 
household initial stock has 3 additional female goats provided by the programme. The 3 goats 
are  then  deducted  in  year  2,  as  they  are  passed  on  to  the  next  household.  With  additional 
investments  in  housing,  vaccination  and  food,  the  mortality  rate  decreases  to  5%,  and  the 
household  is  able  to  make  an  income  out  of  this  activity  and  to  also  keep  a  good  number  of 
goats  for  self-consumption.  The  liquidity  analysis  shows  that,  in  the  first  year,  the  negative

cost each household has to contribute to the group in order to buy the machinery. 
58 The Programme grant covers the starter inputs package, small equipment and 30% of the basic mechanization total 
cost (70% will be the group contribution).

ECONOMIC ANALYSIS 
672.  The objectives of the economic analysis are: i) to examine the overall programme  viability; ii) to 
assess  the  programme’s  impact  and  overall  economic  rate  of  return;  and  iii)  to  perform 
sensitivity analyses to assess the benefits from a broad welfare perspective. 
673.  Key  assumptions.  The  physical  inputs  and  productions  established  in  the  financial  analysis 
provided  the  basis  to  determine  the  viability  of  the  programme  investment  in  terms  of 
opportunity  costs  and  quantifiable  benefits  to  the  economy  as  a  whole.  The  estimate  of  the 
likely economic returns from programme interventions are based on the following assumptions:  
a. 
b. 
c. 
programme life has been assumed at 20 years;  
programme inputs and outputs traded  are  valued  at their respective market prices, and 
goods  are  expected  to  move  freely  within  the  programme  area  in  response  to  market 
demand;  
considering  the  average  deposit  rate  in  Indonesia,  the  discount  rate  used  for  the 
economic analysis has been set at 10%65. 
674.  Programme  economic  costs  and  benefits.  The  economic  analyses  include  the  investment 
and incremental recurrent costs of the programme components. The programme financial costs 
have been converted to economic values by removal of price contingencies, taxes and duties. 
In order to avoid double counting, the final aggregation considered only those costs that were 
not included in the financial models.  
675.  Benefits  Estimation. The  incremental  benefits  stream  comprises  the  economic  net  values  of 
all farm models developed in the financial analysis. These benefits are then aggregated by the 
number of households that are estimated to take part to each activity.

aggregation)

be approximately IDR 1.5 million.

676.  Economic Pricing. Economic pricing has been based on the following assumptions:  
a.  The  opportunity  cost  of  labour  is  set  at  70,350  MDL/day,  or  93.8%  of  financial  cost  of 
labour, which is justified given rural unemployment rate at 6.2%66; 
b.  The shadow exchange rate (SER) has been calculated at 1 USD =13,633 IDR;  
c.  The  Shadow  Exchange  Ratio  Factor  (SERF),  used  to  obtain  economic  costs,  has  been 
calculated at 1.05;  
677.  Economic  Rate  of  Return.  The  overall  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  of  the 
programme  is  estimated  at  19%  for  the  base  case.  The  net  present  value  (NPV)  of  the  net 
benefit stream, discounted at 10%, is USD 50.7 million. A summary of the economic analysis is 
presented in table 3. 
Table 3. Summary of economic analysis 
678.  Sensitivity Analysis. In order to test the robustness of the above results, a sensitivity analysis 
has been carried out; the outcomes of which are presented in table 4. The sensitivity analysis 
investigates  the  effect  of fluctuations  in  programme  costs,  programme  benefits,  and  delays  in 
implementation  on  the  NPV  and  ERR.  It  shows  the  economic  impacts  that  a  decrease  in 
programme benefits – up to -40% – will have on the programme viability. Similarly, it shows how 
the  economic  viability  of  the  programme  will  be  affected  by  an  increase  of  up  to  40%  in 
programme  costs;  and  by  a  one  to  three-year  delay  in  programme  implementation.  The 
analysis confirms that the economic viability of the programme remains attractive as a positive 
NPV and ERR above 10% are preserved in each case analysed.

Under the 2016-2025 Strategic Framework, IFAD aims to invest in rural 
people to enable them to overcome poverty and achieve food security 
through remunerative, sustainable and resilient livelihoods. IFAD will 
pursue three closely interlinked and mutually reinforcing strategic 
objectives (SOs) to achieve its goal: SO1: Increase poor rural people’s 
productive capacities; SO2: Increase poor rural people’s benefits from 
market participation; and SO3: Strengthen the environmental sustainability 
and climate resilience of poor rural people’s economic activities. In order 
to achieve these objectives, IFAD intends to work in a way that is bigger, 
better and smarter: Bigger: by mobilizing substantially more funds and 
resources for investment in rural areas; Better: by strengthening the 
quality of IFAD’s country programmes through innovation, knowledge-
sharing, partnerships and policy engagement; and Smarter: by delivering 
development results in a cost-effective way that best responds to partner 
countries’ evolving needs. 
READ SI directly feeds into the development goal and furthers works 
particularly towards SO1 and 2. Given the prominent scaling up agenda 
and innovation focus, the READ SI investment is aligned with the bigger, 
better, smarter way of working. 
The Country Strategic Opportunities Programme (COSOP), which is 
aligned with the policies and strategies of GoI aims to support inclusive 
rural transformation to enable rural people to reduce poverty and achieve 
sustainable livelihoods. The country strategy is organized around three 
interconnected strategic objectives. The first objective is to facilitate the 
access of small-scale producers to remunerative agricultural markets, to 
enable them capture the benefits emerging from a growing and 
diversifying demand for food-based products, and earn higher income. 
The second strategic objective is to build the resilience of small-scale 
producers and their families and to optimize their risk mitigation strategies 
to reduce their vulnerability. The third objective is to strengthen rural 
institutions so that they can support inclusive rural transformation and 
deliver accountable services that meet the needs of small producers. 
By developing a scalable model for rural development investments, READ 
SI is expected to contribute to rural transformation and particularly support 
strategic objectives 1 and 3. By considering climate change risks and 
building resilience through greater financial inclusion, READ SI is also 
expected to contribute to strategic objective 2. 
READ SI supports the primary and secondary objective of this policy by 
promoting a systemic change in inputs, services and advice delivery, by. 
introducing sustainable production methodologies, including training on 
safe and appropriate use of agricultural inputs (and chemicals) and 
introduction of organic/bio pesticides, herbicides and fertilizers. READ SI 
will particularly adhere to promoting the following policy principles: (i) 
Scaled-up investment in multiple-benefit approaches for sustainable 
agricultural intensification; (ii) Recognition and greater awareness of the 
economic, social and cultural value of natural assets; (iii) ‘Climate-smart’

resilience in order to manage environment- and natural-resource-related 
shocks; (v) Improved governance of natural assets for poor rural people 
by strengthening land tenure and community-led empowerment; (vi) 
Livelihood diversification to reduce vulnerability and build resilience for 
sustainable natural resource management. 
Consistent with the goal to maximize IFAD’s impact on rural poverty in a 
changing climate and the strategy’s three statements of purpose, READ SI 
will mainstream climate smart approaches into its agricultural development 
activities. Climate change resilience is an increasingly important issue in 
Sulawesi and will be reflected with greater prominence in the design and 
delivery of agriculture and livelihoods activities, but also in building 
resilience through greater financial inclusion to enable households to cope 
better with shocks. 
READ SI will systematically address issues of gender equality and 
women's empowerment. It will help women and their organizations in their 
advocacy for access to resources and knowledge. It will strengthen the 
capacity of programme partners (national, local and decentralized 
institutions, training centers, private sector providers and NGOs) to take 
into account issues of gender equality and community empowerment. This 
is particularly considered a difficult group to reach and therefore will be 
subject to special attention. 
READ SI will build smallholders financial capacities and link them to 
financial service provider. Thereby it is fully aligned with the Rural Finance 
strategy’s objectives to make clients “bankable” by enabling them to 
participate in the design of viable business undertakings and by enhancing 
their understanding of services and products through financial literacy 
training. The programme will also look at supporting CBFO, working 
towards the objective to enhance the sustainability of financial service 
providers. 
As outlined under the Private Sector Strategy, IFAD will act as a broker of 
partnership agreements between private sector companies (in the cocoa 
sector), the programme and the farmer groups. The programme will work 
with lead cocoa businesses to explore mechanisms to ensure that 
smallholder producers are respected partners. However, the particular 
dynamics of the cocoa value chain in Sulawesi currently mean that in most 
location there are multiple layers of traders between the farmers and the 
lead cocoa firms (who are the business partners in the PPPs). As such, 
the specific modalities advocated by the IFAD 4P model are not feasible to 
be applied directly. 
READ SI complies with the policy on indigenous people. READ SI will not 
directly target IP through village selection or other mechanism. However, 
where IP are living in the villages chosen on the basis of the other 
selection criteria, then the implementing teams (especially the VF and 
PPL) will adapt the programme delivery modalities to reflect any particular 
cultural aspects. This will be particularly important in the social 
mobilization activities, but also in the way technical training, SCG and 
other activities are organized and delivered.   
IFAD’s Policy 
It is expect that in some of the READ SI communities there will be some

households with little or no land or insecure land usage rights. It is 
however recognized that the security of land usage varies substantially 
from village to village, including under share cropping and fixed rental. As 
such READ SI will need to be able to provide additional support on 
improving security of land usage arrangements in villages where this is a 
barrier to further investment and improvement of production practice. This 
is only expected to be the case in a minority of village and, where it is an 
issue, largely concerning rice crop land but not affecting cocoa and other 
estate and upland crops.   
READ SI, particularly with activities under component 3, is aligned with the 
Knowledge Management strategy, especially in the following areas 
(i) strengthening the process of knowledge sharing and learning; 
(ii) development of partnerships to provide a broader base of knowledge 
sharing and learning and; (iii) promotion of a dynamic platform for 
knowledge sharing and learning. The programme will use (human and 
financial) resources to enhance its impact by sharing knowledge and 
learning.
