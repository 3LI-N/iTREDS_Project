Executive Summary1 
Palestine is at a crossroad with increasing fragility, heightened geopolitical uncertainty and 
accelerating climate change which are risking the further marginalisation of the poor, not least in rural 
areas. This unique confluence of factors has created exceptional challenges for the rural poor, which 
in turn requires a multifaceted response from all development partners, domestic as well as external. 
First and most fundamentally, land ownership and access to water resources for Palestinian living in 
the West Bank are being increasingly challenged. With the expansion of Israeli settlements, the 
separation wall, and traditional tenure system under pressure, this is threatening not only the rural 
economy by marginalising farmers, but also undermining the upstream value chains. Indeed, this 
extraordinary situation has resulted in a fragmented geography, where Palestinian farmland is at risk 
of being lost if investments and effective use are not undertaken, and where it is difficult for 
Palestinian farmers to move freely across their own land. Such a set-up challenges the coherent 
management of natural resources in the wider landscapes, as well as the sustainability and resilience 
of rural livelihoods, making economic and social life increasingly difficult. Especially rural lands (in 
what is known as Area C) are being contested and it is increasingly being recognised by all 
development partners that urgent action is needed. 
The restrictions in the ability of Palestinians to effectively access land and also water resources (with 
more than 80% of the groundwater reserves not accessible to them) is seriously constraining 
investment and growth. These restrictions make the Palestinian population among the most water 
stressed in the world, which is further exacerbated by the observed increase in temperatures and 
more erratic rainfalls over the last decades, adding to the vulnerability of rural villages and the 
agricultural sector. This vulnerability has also been driving high poverty rates, reaching 17.2% of the 
rural population in 2011. Future climate change scenarios foresee even more water scarcity, while the 
current adaptation capacity of farmers and the public response is hampered by inadequate agro-
climatic information, lack of climate change impact modelling for different farming systems, and limited 
interinstitutional capacity to implement harmonized and actionable adaptation strategies. 
Challenged access to land and water is only part of the problem facing the rural poor. For many 
smallholders, the high land fragmentation and limited commercialisation is a key break on their ability 
to achieve economies of scale and higher value addition. Limited options for bulking and storing their 
produced, combined with weak value chains, conspire to perpetuate a vicious circle of low volume, 
low productivity, limited commercialisation leading to low rural incomes. Moreover, especially women 
and youth are marginalised from rural productive activities as they are disproportionally excluded from 
access to land and investment resources, making those two segments particularly vulnerable. 
The resilient land and natural resource management project (RELAP) aims to drive inclusive and 
adaptive changes in all the of the above-mentioned challenges2. Consequently, the project will seek to 
catalyse more secure land tenure for smallholders by promoting climate resilient land development 
activities, using past experiences as a robust platform, but also by innovating around less costly and 
less invasive land practices that are being tested and tried with farmers. The key theory (borne out of 
robust evidence) is that by encouraging farmers to start or intensify cultivation of land, their incomes, 
tenure and land legal security are increased. Moreover, by promoting more climate resilient land-uses 
1   Mission composition: RELAP has been designed by Ammar Salahat, acting general director of the land directorate, MoA; 
Annabelle Lhommeau, IFAD country programme manager for Palestine; Rikke Grand Olivera, lead adviser and natural 
resource management specialist, IFAD/PTA; Kaushik Barua, programme officer for Palestine, IFAD; Peter Frøslev Christensen, 
consultant team leader; Thierry Lassalle, clustering and value chain expert; Maria Donnat, M&E/targeting specialist; Anta Sow, 
financial management and procurement Specialist; Agnese Tonnina, economist/financial analyst; Samvel Ghazaryan, 
infrastructure engineer, TCI/FAO and; Renaud Colmant, climate change specialist, IFAD. FAO and the Environment Quality 
Authority – in particular Nedal Katbeh-Bader, minister’s advisor for climate change as well as national focal point for UNFCCC 
and IPCC– contributed to the conceptualisation of the RELAP key climate change engagements.

and approaches for land development, the RELAP can play an important part in enhancing farmers’ 
ability to manage climate change, in particular increased water scarcity. 
RELAP will, in cooperation with other development partners, also seek to strengthen 
commercialisation and market integration for farmers benefitting from land development support. In 
addition, the project will also support small business development for especially the marginalised rural 
women and youth without access to land. The RELAP key theory of change rests on the assumption 
that by encouraging increased investments in bulking of agricultural produce, commercialisation and 
linking to upstream actors in the value chains, these value chains can be promoted in more effective 
ways, and hence rural incomes can be increased. 
Finally, the RELAP will also promote climate adaptation head on, through investments in generating 
agro climatic information and climate impact modelling accessible to farmers across Palestine. This 
will be done through the installation of agro-meteorological stations that can provide farmers with 
concrete and timely actionable information on climate trends and on how to adapt to the changes. 
That will be complemented by capacity development to link Palestine to leading research and 
knowledge networks regionally and internationally. Technical assistance will also be provided to 
extension services providers and farmers to assist in capacity development for improved adaptation. 
Translating RELAP’s ambitions into impacts, outcomes, components and activities 
RELAP will support key partners in accelerating resilient rural economic growth by both expanding the 
area under cultivation as well as increasing the productivity and profitability of rural production. 
Special attention will be made to ensure adaptiveness and inclusion of less advantaged segments of 
the rural population, in particular families with limited access to land, women and youth, as well as 
promoting increased climate resilience through adapted agricultural practices, and enhanced 
governance and management of land and water. Against this background the RELAP will have the 
goal of improving the resilience and incomes of rural producers’ households in the West Bank. It is 
expected that at least 30 000 households (about 150 000 individuals) will benefit from this directly, 
through higher incomes and enhanced resilience to climate change, the latter especially concerning 
water access and improved water storage capacity of soils. 
RELAP will consequently emphasize resilience of rural economic activities. This is expected to lead to 
three core impacts: Firstly, it will reduce food insecurity in targeted governorates by increasing food 
production and improving affordability of key nutritional foods. This is particularly pertinent in a context 
where imported food can be blocked with virtually no notice. Secondly, it will increase incomes of the 
rural poor from higher production volumes and from tighter market integration that leverage value 
addition for higher profitability. Thirdly it will increase adaptive capacities of both farmers and rural 
households.  
Thus, the development objective will be to increase climate resilience, land productivity, agricultural 
production and marketing opportunities for smallholders and landless rural poor. Core indicators for 
achieving the development outcomes will include, among others: the number of households reached 
and supported; the percentage of supported farmers reporting an increase in production and 
increasing their resilient score; and average percentage increase in annual yields, by type of crops 
and livestock. 
While land development and related natural resources management activities will constitute the core 
of the RELAP intervention, these will be made more climate resilient to current and future climate 
trends, supporting changes in land uses and in crop and livestock production systems and practices. 
Off-farm livelihood activities will be promoted, specifically targeting vulnerable rural people and 
climate adapted small-scale businesses. Interventions will be clustered, using the village as an entry 
point of interventions rather than the individuals. All this will result in RELAP being implemented 
utilising a holistic approach, with three complementary technical components.

Final project design report 
The first component will enhance access to productive agricultural land and water resources, through 
a range of investments in resilient land development, agricultural roads, soil improvements and rain 
water harvesting facilities linked to water-use efficient complementary irrigation systems as well as the 
related capacities to sustain the investments. These investments will be undertaken in close 
partnership with beneficiaries, municipalities and villages, and will be based on business plans for the 
developed land. This component will also support testing and monitoring of adaptation benefits, as 
well as cost-efficiency of land development approaches and practices for different land-uses 
applicable for the conditions of the West Bank. The main outcomes of the component will be more 
productive land. Finally, improved connectivity will also drive profitability and incomes.  
The second component will improve market linkages for the beneficiaries of land development under 
component 1, by facilitating clustering of agricultural products at village level. This will aim at attracting 
and connecting farmers with more market actors (e.g. traders, retailers and input suppliers) and 
increasing local demand for agricultural products. Local bulking will also be enhanced by the 
rehabilitation / building of agricultural roads linking developed lands to villages (under the first 
component). Creating such a conducive agricultural trade context may also provide seasonal jobs in 
the agribusiness sector. Also, specific focus of component 2 will be on creating entrepreneurial 
opportunities and addressing constraints faced by the marginalized, including landless women and 
youth. With accelerating climate change, extremely high youth unemployment and low participation of 
women in the labour force, there is a clear need to develop a diversity of climate resilient income 
generating activities and opportunities for these groups to develop market-led enterprises in the 
farming and off-farming rural sectors. Given the initial high costs required to develop climate-sensitive 
practices, a micro-enterprise facility will be established, which will include climate adaptation as a key 
criterion, for the award of investment grants. The main outcomes of the component will be: increased 
production and marketing of agricultural produce by 30%; and the development of 2,575 micro-
enterprises that can harness the improved market opportunities, amongst whom 900 are managed by 
women and youth. 
The third component will improve public services for climate resilient agriculture and support 
Palestinian farmers in taking timely and effective action to protect their crops and animals from pests, 
diseases, extreme weather and climatic conditions. To increase the resilience of farmers to climate 
change, this component will strengthen their capacities in absorbing climate risk through its 
anticipation ad early action. Farmers will also be supported to adopt new practices through access to 
knowledge, and transformation of livelihood strategies further supported by an enabling environment. 
To overcome current critical challenges in Palestine for a transformative change in dealing with 
climate change impacts on agriculture, the third component aims to promote public services that 
enable farmers to take timely and risk-informed actions; and to consolidate capacities of the MoA, the 
Environment Quality Authority (EQA), Meteorology Department and other related actors for advanced 
information, evidence and programming on climate change adaptation in agriculture. The main 
outcomes of this component will be the number of farmers using advanced agro-climate information 
and extension services for farming decision making; and secondly, the number of national initiatives in 
agriculture mainstreaming climate resilient approaches. 
Finally, RELAP proposes a paradigm shift in land-use and development in the West Bank for small 
farmers towards resilience under increasingly water constrained production conditions. The project 
will inform the policy agenda on upscaling climate resilience land development approaches. 
Knowledge products and policy briefs will be generated to inform policy reforms and up-scaling 
strategies to be supported in component 3. 
RELAP will be implemented over a 6-year period, starting in the course of the second semester of 
2018. The overall project cost for the full 6 years is estimated at around USD 41.44 million, inclusive 
of a financing gap described on the next page. Project investments are organized into four major 
components: (i) Climate resilient land development (60 per cent of the total costs); (ii) Market linkages 
xi 
Palestine 
Resilient Land & Resource Management Project 
Final project design report 
for the rural poor (23 per cent of the total costs); (iii) Improved public services for upscaling climate 
resilient agricultural land use and production systems (8 per cent of the costs); (iv) Project 
management3 (9 per cent of the costs). A summary breakdown of the project costs by components is 
shown below. 
The total project costs of USD 41.44 million will be financed by i) an IFAD grant (from the Fund for 
Gaza and the West Bank - FGWB) of USD 4.56 million (confirmed), ii) a cash contribution from 
government of USD 1.17 million, iii) an OFID grant of USD 1 million (confirmed), iv) an in-kind 
contribution from the government currently estimated at USD 6.57 million4, v) an in kind and cash 
contribution from beneficiaries, respectively of USD 3.61 million and USD 1.28 million (in the form of 
cash, casual labour, and some inputs and equipment), and vi) a contribution toward the road 
construction from the village and municipality councils (estimated at USD 0.24 million). Funds of 
approximately USD 23 million – including a grant from the Green Climate Fund (GCF) of USD 15 
million and a grant of approximately USD 8 million from other partners/entities - are to be budgeted as 
a financing gap. IFAD, MOA and EQA will be in constant contact with the GCF and other potential co-
financiers to mobilize this amount to fill the financing gap or otherwise seek alternative financing 
sources. It is worth noting that in October 2017, the GCF Secretariat notified Palestine of the approval 
of two "GCF readiness proposal and preparatory support project in Palestine". One with UNDP acting 
as Accredited Agency and delivery partner, and the other one with UNEP.  
Implementation modalities 
IFAD has a long standing and positive partnership with the Ministry of Agriculture, working with on 
land development in the West Bank. The ministry will therefore be the RELAP main executing agency. 
All project resources will also be channelled to the ministry and executed through a financing 
agreement to be signed between IFAD and the Ministry of Finance and Planning, in its quality of 
Recipient Representative. The Ministry of Agriculture will set up a project management unit, 
comprising of seconded ministry staff as well as specialists to be hired from the market, who will be 
directly responsible for the implementation – together with partner NGOs to be competitively selected 
– of the two first RELAP components. In the RELAP financing agreement, FAO will be mentioned as 
implementing partner for the RELAP third component, working under the coordination and supervision 
of - and reporting to - the project management unit. EQA will be part of the RELAP steering 
committee. Implementation arrangements are described in details in the PDR main text (paragraphs 
97 to 102) and in Appendix 5 (tables 36, 37, 38 and 39).

I.  Strategic context and rationale 
A.
  Country and rural development context 
1.
In 2017 Palestinians are marking 50 years of occupation of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. 
This operating environment is unique and is reflected in this proposed engagement by IFAD. Overall, 
the operational environment is characterized by: a fragile security situation; numerous restrictions on 
movement and access to natural resources including access to large areas of the West Bank, limited 
access to water resources for all Palestinians, limited access to rangeland affecting in particular 
Bedouin communities; limited possibility for building and developing in Area C5 (details in appendix 1); 
and a settlement expansion, which created a fragmented geography where Palestinian farmland is at 
risk of being lost if investments and effective use is not shown. This situation has resulted in a 
protracted humanitarian crisis: some two million people – nearly half of all Palestinians, including 70% 
of all residents of Gaza, are projected to need some form of assistance in 2017, often food and 
medicines6. This unique environment, that has widespread impact on the lives of people, include 
restrictions on: access and movement of people and goods, and access to natural resources and 
economic and productive activities. It also results in forced displacement, regular clashes, and 
difficulties to obtain permits for travel across the West Bank, affecting some groups disproportionately 
more than others. 
Territorial fragmentation on account of the physical, political and administrative separation of 
2.
Gaza and the West Bank is further worsened by the inability of the P.A to access most of Area C (see 
footnote). This has serious ramifications, for especially agriculture and rural development, increasing 
both transaction costs and unpredictability, and depressing incomes, as Area C is where the majority 
of the West Bank’s farm and rangeland lie. In addition, 82% of the groundwater reserves are currently 
not accessible to the Palestinians. With an annual average rainfall from 100mm – 700mm depending 
on location, this is making Palestinians among the most water stressed people in the world7. This is 
further exacerbated by the increase in temperatures and more erratic rainfalls over the last decades 
due to climate change, adding to the vulnerability of rural communities and the agricultural sector. 
Moreover, much of the fertile land is also located in Area C, where it is being either completely closed 
off to Palestinians, or only accessible with considerable difficulty and often at prohibitive cost (e.g. 
multiple security check points not allowing vehicular access or with unpredictable denial of access). It 
is estimated that the restrictions in Area C impose a cost on the Palestinian economy in the magnitude 
of USD 2.2 billion yearly or around 20% of GDP.8 The occupation has also resulted in the expansion 
and construction of new Israeli settlements, creating a segmented geography where Palestinians are 
impeded from moving freely across their own land and applying a coherent management of their wider 
landscapes. This is undermining both the territorial integrity and the wider ability to create a 
contiguous and economically and politically sustainable country. 
Poverty. Despite these challenges, Palestine has achieved middle income country status (per 
3.
capita gross national income equals USD 4 699 in PPP dollars) and with a Human Development 
Index (HDI) score of 0.686 both in 2014 (a 5.7% increase since 2005). Palestine is placed within the 
“medium human development” category and ranks 107th out of 187 countries and territories in the 
HDI. According to latest estimates, 25.8% of the Palestinian population falls below the poverty line of 
5   Under the framework of the Oslo Accord in 1993, the Palestine Authority (PA) was designated to have exclusive control 
over both internal security-related and civilian issues in Palestinian urban areas (referred to as Area A) and only civilian 
control over Palestinian rural areas (Area B). The remainder of the territories (Area C covering 63%) including Israeli 
settlements, the Jordan Valley region and bypass roads between Palestinian communities, were subject to future 
negotiations for clarifying the process of transferring part or all of these areas to the PA. However, such negotiations failed 
to progress and the Israeli claimed part of Area C has been expanding since the Oslo Accords.

NIS 2,293 (or USD 650) per month and some 8.8% was below the “deep poverty line”. The proportion 
of the population in the West Bank below the poverty line has steadily decreased from 24% (2006) to 
18% (2011). There are however significant differences across the 11 governorates with 30% poor in 
Hebron, but only 9% in Ramallah. While the occupation is considered a primary driver of economic 
hardship for Palestinian households, poverty is also strongly correlated with the household’s size and 
the education and employment status of the household’s head. Poverty rates are thus found higher 
among larger households and in households headed by an adult with a low level of education, while 
individuals living in households with one or more unemployed members are more than twice as likely 
to be poor. More detailed information is found in appendix 2. 
4.
The gap between male-headed households and female-headed households has reduced 
(18.3% of female-headed households were poor in 2011 against 17.4% for male-headed households, 
from respectively 31.4% female-headed households and 23.4% male-headed households in 2006). 
Similarly, the gap between rural and urban households has tended to narrow-down over time. 
5.
Land uses and main farming systems in the West Bank. The main farming systems in the 
West bank include: i) orchards on terraces; ii) orchards on terraces, intercropped with annual crops; 
iii) integrated field crops (wheat, barley) and livestock systems; iv) vegetable production in open fields 
or green houses; v) grape fields; and vi) rangelands used by Bedouins or other livestock keepers. 
More details are presented in appendix 4. 
Food security. 1.6 million Palestinians (32%) were food insecure in 2014. In the West Bank 
6.
only, the percentage has remained stable since previous survey period, at 19%. Food insecure 
households are evenly split between the severely food insecure and moderately food insecure, while 
the marginally food secure and food secure households account for 15% and 58% respectively. Food 
insecurity tends to be higher in rural areas and among women-headed households. A higher 
proportion of food insecure households is also found among households deriving their primary income 
source from agriculture (35%) or from private sector employees (34%), whereas this proportion is 
lowest among family business owners (19%), government employees (26%) and for households 
whose head works in Israel (27%). The proportion of food insecure households is also found highest 
in Area C (38%), compared to 30% in Area A and B, while restrictions of movement seem to be 
correlated with food insecurity. Food insecure households have also more family members than food 
secure families and their head is more likely to be unemployed.  
Nutritional status. The food insecurity is a key contributor to mal nutrition rather than cultural 
7.
and food choice factors. In 2016, WFP estimated a global chronic malnutrition rate of 7.4% among 
children aged 6 to 59 months. Since 2004, the prevalence rate of moderately and severely 
underweight children has reduced overall, from 4,9% to 1.4%9. A similar trend is also noted in the 
West Bank, together with a marginal difference between urban (1.3%) and rural areas (1.6%). The 
2011 World Bank poverty assessment showed that emergency assistance has been reasonably 
successful in preventing widespread malnutrition. There are a coordinated network of 14 partners 
monitoring and working on food and nutrition security in the West Bank.  
8.
Gender. The Gender Development Index (GDI) score of 0.974 is significantly higher than in the 
average for the Arab region, Palestine ranking 41st out of 187 countries. This score, however, does not 
reflect appropriately the actual low level of empowerment of Palestinian women. Although life 
expectancy at birth is higher for women, the difference in human development between women and 
men is caused by the fact that women have fewer numbers of years of schooling and have, on 
average, only 20% of men’s income level. The legal framework is not favourable to women and the 
Palestinian society is predominantly a patriarchal one in which women’s role is shaped by traditions 
derived from tribal cultural values of the Arab region and Islamic values. This situation is exacerbated 
by movement restrictions: these have tended to instigate stricter control by men, and the society, over 
women in a proclaimed attempt to protect them from the dangers in the society. As a result, Palestine 
9   Source: Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS, 2016) 
2 
Palestine 
Resilient Land & Resource Management Project 
Final project design report 
records one of the lowest female labour force participation in the world (17.9% in 2015, against 64.2% 
for men).  
Other reasons for low women’s participation in the labour force also include the large number of 
9.
children per household due to a high fertility rate, private sector employers’ preference of hiring men 
over women, and the fact that educated women have predominantly studied “women-appropriate” 
subjects for which few jobs are available outside of the public sector. Girls’ and women’s participation 
in technical training is low (some 30% of trainees) and it is even lower for vocational training (2% to 
3%). Two sectors absorb most of the Palestinian women’s workforce: services, including health and 
education (59.7% in 2011) and agriculture (13.1% of women’s employment in 2015 against 7.8% of 
men’s employment). Women’s participation in the private sector economy is limited and most paid 
women are employed in the public sector. In the West Bank, women only account for 16% of the 
employees of micro, small and medium-enterprises and 24% of the employees of larger enterprises. 
Furthermore, only 3.4% of the women’s workforce are entrepreneurs who have started their own 
business and have employees (against 16% for men), while only 13% of women in the workforce are 
self-employed. Most women working in the agricultural sector are involved in subsistence farming, or 
they work without pay in their family’s or husband’s land. It is thus estimated that only 1.8% of women 
active in the agriculture earn a wage, while only very few women are owner-operators of their farm. 
10.
  Due to their low participation in the formal labour market, as well as issues related to 
inheritance, it is challenging for Palestinian women to build their own assets’ base. Thus, if the 
inheritance law grants women the right to inherit from their parents (including land), in practice, they 
tend to inherit smaller shares compared to male heirs. Furthermore, for fear of deceiving their family 
and loosing fraternal protection, only few women are claiming their rights of inheritance and most 
chose to abandon their shares to their brothers. As for the few women willing to claim their shares, 
they face lengthy, complicated legal procedures and expensive court fees. As a result, it is currently 
estimated that only 7.6% of agricultural holdings in the West Bank are owned by women and most of 
these are small. As a direct consequence of their lack of assets, Palestinian women do not possess 
the collateral required to borrow money from a bank and start a business. 
  The youth. Palestine’s population is young, with an estimated 39% below the age of 15, and 
11.
almost 30% being aged 15-29 years. UNFPA has recently estimated that the population of youth in 
the country will double by 2050. Palestinian youth face significantly higher rates of unemployment 
than older workers: respectively 25.6% and 16.2% of males aged 15-24 years in the West Bank are 
unemployed, against 9% of males aged 35-54 years. With an unemployment rate four times higher 
than other women, and nearly double that of men in the same age group, young women are at an 
even greater disadvantage in the labour market. Several factors explain the difficulties faced by the 
Palestinian youth in accessing the labour market, one of them being that the educational system pays 
insufficient attention of the needs of the labour market. Enrolment in vocational training is extremely 
low (only 5% of the students in Ramallah were involved in vocational training in 2008), largely 
because of the prevailing, negative societal attitude towards this type of education. While enrolment 
rates in secondary and tertiary education are high for both girls and boys, dropout rates are also 
high10 (35% for males and 29% for females in the age category 15-29), which means that a significant 
percentage of students leave high school or the university without a diploma.  
  All Palestinians are affected by restrictions of movements, but the youth in general, and the 
12.
rural youth in particular, pay a disproportional high price. Since the second intifada, youth mobility is 
being increasingly restricted by parents fearful for their children’s safety (in particular boys, more likely 
to be targeted at checkpoints). Young men are also much less susceptible than older, married men to 
obtain a working permit to Israel, which limits their ability to seek employment there. Also, the 
unemployed youth are less able than others to afford the transportation costs necessary to travel to 
the nearest city or youth centre in search for leisure activities, as a result of which, many are 
struggling to even fill their free time.  
10   The key reported reasons are the lack of money or the need to support their family for males, and marriage for women.

  Climate change. Palestine faces an increase in the frequency of heavy rainfalls, prolonged dry 
13.
periods, and rising temperatures (with a trend increase in average annual temperature of 0.27 
°C/decade for the period 1960-2015). Water stress is being exacerbated as rains are more 
concentrated and heavier in early winter, increasing the torrential regime and thus the risk of flooding, 
soil erosion, and reduced infiltration of water in the soils. This results in lower availability of water in 
spring-summer when water demand for crop production and other human uses is higher. The 
precipitation increases, during early winter, cannot compensate the decrease in early spring and 
autumn and for increased evaporation caused by higher temperatures. Both olive and grape 
production (two core crops) are sensitive to heat waves, frosts and droughts and severe losses were 
reported in 2010 and 2015 due to extreme weather. Moreover, livestock productivity is also affected 
both directly as especially lamb and sheep are sensitive to cold and heat waves and there is a clear 
decreasing trend in total average annual rainfall in the eastern slopes, where most rangeland is found, 
but also indirectly as grazing land is becoming more sensitive to overgrazing and reduced vegetation, 
which in turn causes erosion and loss of the fertile top soil. More information is found in appendix 13 
(SECAP note) on climate assessment.  
  Rural development challenges and the policy response. Inclusive rural development faces 
14.
important obstacles and challenges, including, among others: i) the volatility and high insecurity, due 
to restriction of movements and regular clashes between Palestinians, Israeli security forces and 
settlers; ii) the agricultural production, which is constrained by the lack of access to water and land in 
Area C; iii) the impacts of climate change, adding to the existing water stress, drying and degradation 
of the land; iv) the high food insecurity and the lack of income opportunities for the rural population, in 
a context of a captive economy, where imported food can be blocked with virtually no notice and 
where food prices are high and volatile11; and v) restrictions on imports and exports of agricultural 
inputs and outputs, reducing predictability and investment horizons and increasing costs. 
  Further hindering rural development is the small size of farms, on average 1.2 ha (or 12 
15.
dunums) in the West Bank often spread out on several plots12. Clearly if the productivity of such plots 
was high, this could partly compensate for the small size. Unfortunately, productivity is relatively low, 
not least for the major tree-crop grown, olive, which is inherently low productive but also due to limited 
precipitation that reduce the choice of rain-fed high-productivity crops (and is a main reason for 
growing olive). Combined with the above-mentioned challenges, agriculture is a difficult sector to 
engage in. Thus, the rural urban exodus has been gaining strength. In 2000 the rural population 
constituted 28%, a figure that was down to 25% in 2015, whereas corresponding figures for share of 
labour force engaged in agriculture halved from 12% to 6%13. The area under permanent crop 
cultivation has declined from 120 000 ha in 1997 to 70 000 in 2012.  
  At the macro level, the PA’s main policy is encapsulated in the National Policy Agenda 2017-
16.
2022, which has as the overall vision of a free, independent and prosperous state of Palestine. It has 
three pillars: 1) path to Independence, 2) government reform, and 3) sustainable development. The 
emphasis of the pillar on sustainable development is on revitalizing agriculture and strengthening the 
rural communities, not least in Area C. Moreover, the rehabilitation of land is an explicit commitment in 
the National Policy Agenda, as it is seen a as crucial in protecting the remaining territorial integrity of 
Palestine. Hence two key policy priorities for the P.A are to firstly increase agricultural plant and 
livestock production and to develop value chains, and secondly to protect and support farmers, 
particularly in areas under threat. The specific strategies for delivering on these policy priorities are 
detailed in the National Agricultural Sector Strategy (NASS), 2017-2022. A key crosscutting theme in 
the NASS is the focus on improving steadfastness of farmers and rural communities, with explicit 
reference to land tenure and land security, but also as regards their ability to improve the livelihoods in 
rural areas, making it a pro-active and positive decision to stay in and invest in rural businesses, 
agriculture included. Particular emphasis is given to innovative youth, women farmers, and producers 
11   According to the 2014 socio-economic and food security survey, carried out by the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, 
WFP and UNRWA in the West Bank, food insecurity remained at 17%, unchanged from 2012 levels.

engaged in sustainable and feasible agricultural and rural activities. Water access is also singled out 
as a key area, partly due to the restricting access, partly due to climate change exacerbating water 
stress.  
  The PA has demonstrated high commitments to the global climate change agenda. Palestine 
17.
was among the first countries to sign and ratify the Paris Agreement (22 April 2016) made under the 
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and submitted its Nationally 
Determined Contribution (NDC) and its National Adaptation Plan (NAP) in a record time after being a 
party to the convention. The NDC and the NAP prioritise key adaptation actions for the agricultural 
sector including: Improve farmers’ and agricultural engineers’ capacities for irrigation management 
and treated wastewater reuse; introduce new fodder seeds and minimize soil erosion through 
minimum tillage; soil water harvesting to improve water availability and soil quality; increase 
agricultural water availability by constructing cisterns and rehabilitating conveyance infrastructure; and 
introduce/rehabilitate structures for soil and water conservation in sloped terrain to minimise soil 
erosion. 
B.
  Rationale and theory of change 
  As shown in Section A, the West Bank’s rural territorial viability is being threatened by a 
18.
multiplicity of both manmade and natural threats that is undermining agriculture as one of the key 
pillars of the national economy. Consequently, many young people (in particular women) leave 
agriculture, this being also reflected in the aging demographics of farmers, in a country that otherwise 
characterized by its high share of youth. With high youth unemployment and agricultural land under 
pressure, the PA has launched a number of initiatives to revive rural growth in general and agriculture 
in particular, as laid out in the NASS. Against this background and based on the past robust 
achievements (see Section on lessons learnt and appendix 3), the PA has called upon IFAD to assist 
in increasing the resilience, adaptability and productivity of the rural economy at a time characterized 
by transformation, increasing challenges from climate change, threats and some opportunities. 
19.
In Palestine, IFAD is seen as a long-term partner with a specialization in promoting land 
development and rural resilient transformations. In the Palestinian context, IFAD’s comparative 
advantage is its unwavering commitment to work directly through the P.A to improve rural livelihoods 
using both direct assistance to the rural poor as well as indirect means (e.g. generating rural 
employment both on and off-farm). This will assist thousands in escaping poverty while 
simultaneously increasing land and food security, nutrition and resilience of livelihoods. By 
consistently creating employment opportunities in deprived areas, in collaboration with the Ministry of 
Agriculture (MoA) and in engaging with other development partners, IFAD is contributing to reducing 
uncertainty and also increasing the resilience of the country, by improving access to productive land 
and opening up and diversifying opportunities for youth and women in small businesses adapted to 
the challenges of climate change. This should also be seen as a strategy to breaking the vicious 
nexus between rural-urban migration, poverty, climate induced stresses and fragility, by providing 
economic opportunities that have transformational impact. IFAD’s comparative advantage will also 
assist in innovating and turn current risks into more secure, productive and climatically resilient 
opportunities for the rural poor. Thus, IFAD has been one of the leading promotors of land reclamation 
and rehabilitation14, which is now being scaled up with a strong focus on practices addressing climate 
vulnerabilities in a diversity of land-uses to enhance resilience of Palestinian farmers and herders.  
  RELAP’s core theory of change aim to provide sustainable pathways out of three interlinked 
20.
challenges: First and most fundamentally, land ownership and access is increasingly being 
challenged, with traditional tenure system under pressures, threatening not only the rural economy by 
marginalising farmers, but also undermining the upstream value chains. Worse, loss of land and very 
limited access to groundwater resources also weakens the territorial integrity of the nascent and 
14   Land development is divided into land reclamation which is visible investments in land not currently under agricultural 
production (might be used for occasional grazing), and rehabilitation which is improvement of land already used for 
agriculture.

Resilient Land & Resource Management Project

fragile state, with fewer contiguous areas and only 20% of groundwater resources accessible for 
Palestinians making economic and social life increasingly difficult. Especially marginal rural lands (in 
Area C) are being contested, new water related infrastructures needed to cope with increasing water 
stress are rarely being allowed and it is recognised by development partners that urgent action is 
needed.  
  However, secure access to land and water resources is only part of the problem facing the rural 
21.
poor. For many smallholders, the high land fragmentation and limited commercialisation is a key break 
on their ability to achieve economies of scale and higher value addition. Limited options for bulking 
and storing their produce, combined with weak value chains, conspire to perpetuate the low volume, 
low productivity and limited commercialisation. Moreover, especially women and youth are 
marginalised from rural productive activities as they are disproportionally excluded from access to 
land and investment resources, making those two segments particularly vulnerable. 
  Third and final, accelerating climate change is worsening the already severe water crises with 
22.
limited access of Palestinian farmers to the aquifers of the West Bank. Temperatures, and 
consequently crop water requirements, are gradually increasing, while the rain is concentrated in 
fewer month and will in future scenarios be gradually decreasing. Again, the rural poor are the most 
vulnerable and least able to cope or adapt to the ever more water stressed conditions, whereas the 
public response is hampered by inadequate weather-related information relevant for agriculture and 
limited inter-institutional collaboration in designing and implementing actionable adaptation 
strategies.15  
  RELAP engagements will aim to drive inclusive and adaptive changes in all of the three above-
23.
mentioned challenges. Consequently, the project will seek to catalyse more secure land tenure for 
smallholders by promoting climate resilient land development, using past experiences as a robust 
platform, but also by expanding land development practices to cover a broader diversity of farming 
systems and livelihood. The project will innovate around less costly and less invasive land 
development practices that will be tested and monitored for socioeconomic and adaptation benefits 
with farmers and herders. The key theory of change (based on robust evidence) is that by 
encouraging farmers to start or intensify cultivation of land, their food security, incomes, tenure and 
land legal security are increased. Moreover, by promoting more climate resilient approaches and 
practices, RELAP can play an important part in enhancing farmers’ ability to manage climate change, 
in particular increased water scarcity.  
  RELAP will, in cooperation with other development partners, also seek to strengthen 
24.
commercialisation and market integration, both for farmers benefitting from land development support, 
but also for the marginalised rural women and youth. The key theory of change rests on the 
assumption that by encouraging value chain strengthening, increased investments and bulking of 
produce, commercialisation can be promoted in more effective ways, and hence rural incomes can be 
increased. A entrepreneurship development facility will provide small grants to landless women and 
youth for starting or expanding micro climate resilient businesses to increase opportunities and 
integrate these groups in the economic development in the villages.  
  Finally, RELAP will also promote climate adaptation head on, through significant investments in 
25.
generating climate forecasts relevant for farmers across Palestine through the installation of agro-
meteorological stations that can provide farmers with concrete and timely actionable information on 
climate trends and on how to adapt to the changes. That will be complemented by capacity 
development to link Palestine to leading research and knowledge networks regionally and 
internationally. Technical assistance will also be provided to assist in capacity development for 
improved adaptation. 
15   A schematic presentation of the theory of change is presented in appendix 6.

II.  Project description 
A.
  Project area and target group 
  Target area. The RELAP target area comprises Areas B and C in the 11 governorates of the 
26.
West Bank16. Component 1 and 2 will initially be rolled out in 6 governorates: Bethlehem, Hebron, 
Jenin, Nablus, Tubas and Tulkarm. The number of governorates may be increased subject to 
absorption capacity which will be assessed during supervision missions and the mid-term review. Due 
to the inherent nature of building a network of agro-meteorological weather stations and the upscaling 
ambitions, (also to be mainstreamed into policies) component 3 will cover all of the West Bank. In 
each governorates, the project will seek to select the areas with the highest incidence of poverty. 
Other criteria for final village selection include the existence of a potential to develop a minimum of 
200 dunums of land and with higher vulnerability to climate related risks. 
  Target groups and targeting strategy. Project activities have been designed to benefit the 
27.
following groups, which will be specifically targeted, and have the following characteristics (more 
details are found in appendix 2): 
Smallholders and small-scale farmers: Typically, Area C smallholder farmers have limited 
 
access to inputs, including cultivable land and water for irrigation, and to markets and their 
steadfastness on the land may be at risk. In Area B, smallholders face similar problems in terms of 
access to cultivable land and irrigation water, except that land tenure security is less of an issue. The 
average land holding size in the West Bank is 12.2 dunums (1.2 ha) and, overall, holdings of less than 
10 dunums (1 ha) amount to 73.5% of total agriculture holdings (while large holdings exceeding 80 
dunums (8 ha) account for only 1.8% of total agricultural holdings). The majority of smallholders do 
not practice full-time farming but have other income sources in the private or public sectors. For the 
majority, agriculture is practiced to fulfil households’ needs for olive oil, fruits and other agricultural 
produce, with surplus given to the wider family and neighbours and sold to supplement main income. 
Private land development activities will be targeted at smallholders, who will be selected according to 
transparent eligibility criteria (see Targeting strategy, appendix 2). As women are estimated to account 
for 7.6% of land owners in Palestine, and as the project intends to support farmers, including women, 
in obtaining a legal title (inheritance or succession) to their land, it is expected that no less than 10% 
of women owners will benefit from land development work. Smallholders and small-scale farmers are 
also expected to benefit from interventions aimed at bulking and aggregating their produce, while 
most of them will also derive additional benefits from road improvement or construction.  
Poor, landless and unemployed youth and women: These will be the exclusive beneficiaries of 
 
the investment grant schemes and capacity development support for entrepreneurs and it is 
tentatively proposed that both groups shall equitably benefit from these interventions.  
Livestock herders: Land development will include rangeland rehabilitation on communal grazing 
 
land that will benefit many livestock owners who practice semi-intensive or extensive livestock 
production (providing a source of income and food for an estimated 32 000 households). Heard size is 
usually relatively small17, intensive production mainly concerns cow breeders, while semi-intensive or 
extensive production systems are practiced by sheep and goat keepers. While some 2.02 million 
dunums of rangeland are found in the West Bank (Jordan Valley and Eastern slopes), closures 
imposed by the occupation have led to only 30.7% of rangeland being accessible to the herders. As a 
result, available range land, usually located on communal land, tends to be overgrazed and degraded. 
Palestinian herders and Bedouins in remote communities are also facing the problem of access to 
water, mainly relying on water sold from tankers at high costs for their animals. The livestock owners 
of goats and sheep practising semi-intensive or extensive production will be the direct beneficiaries of 
the rangeland rehabilitation. Each group supported should have at least 70% poorer households 
among its members. 
16   Jenin, Tubas, Tulkarm, Nablus, Qalqylia, Salfit, Ramallah, Jericho, Bethlehem, Hebron and Jerusalem 
17   According to the 2013 PBCS Livestock survey, 61% of livestock holdings that have cows do not exceed three heads, 65% 
of livestock holdings with sheep do not exceed 19 heads, and 66% of holdings with goats do not exceed 19 heads.

  Other direct beneficiaries. In addition to the main beneficiaries just described (who will be 
28.
specifically targeted by and who are expected to derive significant benefits from project support and 
interventions), some activities will directly benefit additional households. Construction and 
rehabilitation of rural roads will benefit all farmers and land owners whose land is located along these 
roads in terms of improved access to their land and to markets. The multi-stakeholders’ platforms 
promoted by RELAP for market linkages development will benefit all interested local producers, local 
traders, brokers, as well as members of women associations, who will enjoy improved marketing 
opportunities (for producers) or reduced transaction costs (for traders and brokers). Activities, aimed 
at providing better climate information services to farmers and up-scaling climate resilient farming and 
land development systems and practises, will potentially benefit the entire farming community. 
  Outreach. It is estimated that the project will directly benefit a total of 30 000 rural households

  Defining land reclamation and rehabilitation. These are the two core activities of the RELAP 
30.
land development component and understanding them properly is key to conceptualizing the project. 
Land reclamation is the process of creating new agricultural land from areas previously not 
31.
under cultivation nor used systematically for e.g. grazing. Land reclamation tend to be more 
expensive than land rehabilitation as the starting point is from scratch, e.g. no systematic planting, 
contour belting, terracing nor de-rocking has taken place. However, reclamation cost also depend on 
characteristics of the land and land-use. Up to a point, the steeper the slope of the land, ceteris 
paribus, the higher the cost. In addition, land reclaimed for cultivation purposes also tend to be more 
expensive than land for grazing.  
Land rehabilitation encompasses more than the name imply. Clearly it involves rehabilitating 
32.
land (including terraces, access roads, soil quality and irrigation infrastructure) that has been 
degraded or fallen into disrepair. It may have been completely abandoned or used at a production 
level below its optimal level. The drivers can be a multiplicity of factors, including climate change, loss 
of market access (also for inputs), lack of investment capital and aging of the farmers (i.e. a reduction 
in available labor). However land rehabilitation also involves pushing the production possibility frontier 
further up, by upgrading production technologies, infrastructure, usage models and processes 
allowing for higher productivity, incomes and profits. Previously, this has been the main focus of 
IFAD’s engagement in land rehabilitation (under PNRMP) and it is also envisaged to be the main 
focus on RELAP’s efforts in this space. 
  Common for both land development types will be the robust focus on a business case for the 
33.
developed land and improving climate resilience, not least in terms of water availability, soil water

storage capacity and ability to cope with extreme weather events. In addition, RELAP will also 
consistently work to reduce both land reclamation and rehabilitation cost, using less environmentally 
invasive methods. 
B.
  Development objective and impact indicators 
  RELAP will support key partners in accelerating resilient rural economic growth by both 
34.
expanding the area under cultivation as well as increasing the productivity and profitability of rural 
production. Special attention will be made to ensure resilience and inclusion of less advantaged 
segments of the rural population, in particular families with limited access to land, women and youth 
as well as promoting increased climate resilience through adapted agricultural practices, and land and 
water management. Against this background the RELAP will have the following goal:  
To improve the resilience and incomes of rural producers’ households in the West Bank. 
It is expected that about 30,000 households will benefit from this directly through higher 
35.
incomes and enhanced resilience to climate change, the latter especially concerning water access.  
  RELAP will emphasize resilience of rural economic activities. This is expected to lead to three 
36.
core impacts: Firstly, it will improve food security in targeted governorates by increasing food 
production and improving affordability of key nutritional foods. This is particularly pertinent in a context 
where imported food can be blocked with virtually no notice. Secondly, it will increase incomes of the 
rural poor from higher production volumes and from tighter market integration that leverage value 
addition for higher profitability. Thirdly, it will increase adaptation capacities of both farmers and rural 
households through making timely climate information available to them and provide appropriate 
training. Thus, the development objective will be: 
To increase climate resilience, land productivity, agricultural production and marketing opportunities 
for smallholders and landless rural poor. 
37.
  Core indicators for achieving the development outcomes will include, among others: the 
number of households reached and supported; the percentage of supported farmers reporting an 
increase in production and increasing their resilience score; average percentage increase in annual 
yields, by type of crops and livestock; and the number of farmers that have been receiving and using 
weather forecasts and early warning information to make decisions on adaptation options for their 
farming practices. 
C.
  Outcomes/Components 
Land development that incorporates climate change adaptation practices in a diversity of 
38.
farming systems will be the core of the RELAP intervention. Where changing rainfall patterns do no 
longer sustain current land uses changes in uses and in crop and livestock production systems will be 
supported, making them more resilient to current and future climate trends. Off-farm livelihood 
activities will be promoted, specifically targeted to vulnerable rural people and climate change adapted 
small-scale businesses. Interventions will be clustered, favouring the village, whenever possible, as 
an entry point of interventions rather than individuals. All this will result in RELAP being implemented 
utilising a holistic approach, with three complementary but synergistically linked components, 
described below. 
Component 1: Climate resilient land development  
39.
  The component is designed to enhance access to productive agricultural land and water 
through a range of investments in land development, agricultural roads, soil improvements and rain 
water harvesting facilities, which will be undertaken in close partnership with beneficiaries, 
municipalities and villages. It will also aim to strengthen small farmers’ and livestock keeper’s 
resilience to current and anticipated impacts of climate variability and change, by financing capacity 
development, and by testing and monitoring adaptation benefits and cost-effectiveness of land 
development approaches and practices applicable for the conditions of the West Bank.  
9 
Palestine 
Resilient Land & Resource Management Project 
Final project design report 
  For land selection, in addition to village poverty criteria, other selection criteria will include: land-
40.
use suitability (such as minimum required annual average rainfall for water harvesting, topsoil depth, 
reasonable land slopes and not more than 40% rocks); technical feasibility; opportunities for farming 
business and rural enterprise, while serving in particular the poor rural households, the economically 
active rural smallholders and women; beneficiary contribution; and capacity to maintain rehabilitated 
or constructed assets. All selected proposals for investment will have to demonstrate the potential to 
enhance economic opportunities and improve livelihoods, allowing for future easier scaling-up by 
beneficiaries (including private sector), municipalities, villages or central government. The 
identification of areas for land development will be undertaken in a participatory and demand-driven 
manner at village level to ensure that they meet target group needs. The draft project implementation 
manual (PIM) specifies the selection criteria in detail (See appendix 11). 
  There is a substantial need for major investment in agricultural land development in the West 
41.
Bank and in rain water harvesting in soils and facilities for supplementary irrigation for enhanced 
climate resilience in particular. Any involvement in land development activities will be explicitly linked 
to their ability to catalyse sustainable and inclusive economic growth. The lack of adequate access to 
land and water resources, and climate vulnerability, negatively affect the further investment by farmers 
or the proprietors of small and medium-scale enterprises in agricultural activities at a rural level. The 
main types of investments eligible under the component will include land and farm development 
(reclamation and rehabilitation combined with associated capacity development), cisterns for rain 
water harvesting, tree seedling and planting, and agricultural access roads. The component will 
comprise of 3 sub-components: 
Subcomponent 1.1. Testing and monitoring of resilience benefits of land development practices  
  This subcomponent will be implemented in parallel with subcomponent 1.2 on land 
42.
development. It will support the systematic testing, monitoring and learning with farmers and livestock 
keepers from the land development approaches and practices implemented in farmers’ fields under 
subcomponent 1.2. The systematic learning and knowledge products will facilitate diversifying current 
land development interventions and support the transformation to resilient production systems. The 
subcomponent will include 4 main activities: i) a stocktake study of current land development 
practices; ii) the design of testing and monitoring programme and its IT data platform; iii) the 
testing/implementation of the programme with farmers; and iv) from midterm and to the end of the 
project, testing and monitoring results will be used for systematic learning and preparation of 
knowledge products (policy briefs, documentation of practices eventually integrated in the WOCAT 
platform) and adjustment of land development guidelines. These knowledge products will inform the 
upscaling of adaptation practices on the ground (supported by subcomponent 3.1) as well as policy 
processes adjusting/reforming the land development and related policies (supported by 
subcomponent 3.2). The aim is to improve the policy framework for more sustainable land 
development and resilience to current and future climate challenges. 
  Key performance metrics for subcomponent 1.1 will be linked to the share of the ability of 
43.
smallholder farmers to adopt environmentally sustainable and climate resilience natural resources 
management practices and technologies. 
Subcomponent 1.2. Resilient land development.  
  Using local multi-stakeholder platforms at the village level (see component 2), investments will 
44.
be directed in development of agricultural lands. The planning process with village stakeholders to 
create a shared vision and identify suitable land and land development approaches is described in 
details in appendix 4. This will also include specific measures to inform, encourage and further 
support smallholders, and particularly women, to register their land. The main activities will include 
soil improvement to enhance fertility and water storage capacity, de-rocking of the land, different types 
of terracing and soil and water containing infrastructure (depending on slope, could be bench terraces 
with dry stone masonry retaining walls, counter bounds, V-shape or half-moon), fencing, cisterns for 
rain water harvesting, land preparation and tree planting.  
10 
Palestine 
Resilient Land & Resource Management Project 
Final project design report 
  These activities are planned to sustainably develop 18 000 dunums of land (benefiting around 2 
45.
700 households), with reclamation efforts being primarily targeted to Area C whereas 
rehabilitation/improvement efforts will be in both C and B Areas. Land development for orchards in 
some cases intercropped with annual crops will be implemented for an area of about 10,000 dunum. 
Some additional 8,000 dunum are anticipated to be developed/improved for other land-uses some of 
which are suitable for lower rainfall than orchards, such as cultivation of annual and perennial crops in 
wadis using gabion structures for water and soil harvesting, rangeland rehabilitation, and crop-
livestock system under conservative agriculture. An important activity will be capacity development 
and technical support to farmers in understanding climate risks and adaptation options, soil and water 
management practices (e.g. use of compost, conservation agriculture, crop rotation, and intercropping 
with fodder crops) as well as rangeland improvement and management. 
  Also, to achieve more equitable land development, the component will aim at establishing a 
46.
mechanism whereby both men and women (including the youth) will be supported in the legal 
paperwork required for land registration and get further protected from land confiscation. Related 
activities will include sensitization campaigns, provision of legal services, and financial/technical 
support to prepare documentation for land registration or succession. 
Sub-component 1.3: Investment in Agricultural Roads 
47.
  This sub-component will focus on agricultural roads and ancillary structures that will 
complement the land development activities under the sub-component 1.2, by assuring reliable 
access to and from the lands developed for agricultural production. Other than to the 2 700 
households benefiting from subcomponent 1.2, this subcomponent will benefit an additional 1,800 
households. 
  Key performance metrics for subcomponent 1.3 will be 100 km of roads to be constructed, 
48.
mainly comprising of opening and placement of stabilised gravel layer. Eligible investments will 
include also road ancillaries such as drainage facilities (side channels and culverts) and required 
retaining walls to ensure climate resilience of constructed agricultural roads. 
Component 2. Market linkages for the rural poor  
49.
  Rural areas are generally well connected to major urban centres, which constitute the main 
outlets for most agricultural products. However, for small scale family farms, marketing linkages tend 
to rely on individual contacts in the local community, with limited volumes of transactions. Previous 
experience indicate that smallholders sell only about 25% of their products in formal markets19. This 
makes it challenging to upscale and promote farming as an attractive business in these areas.  
  By improving facilities for bulking of agricultural products at village level subcomponent 2.1 will 
50.
aim at attracting and connecting farmers and their organisations, with more market actors (e.g. 
traders, retailers and input suppliers) and increasing local demand for agricultural products. This will 
generate more opportunities (through bulking), better prices (through higher value added thanks to 
processing, and access to markets on better terms) and incentivising trade and investment in 
agriculture. For instance, farmers benefitting from RELAP land development activities 
(subcomponents 1.1 and 1.2), whose agricultural production will be increased and bulked with other 
farmers, will be better positioned to apply for activities, call for proposals and/or contract farming 
facilitation supported by other donors’ trade and marketing projects. This will also create a conducive 
context for the emergence or strengthening of market oriented farmers organisations in the provision 
of post-harvest services (quality certification, bulk marketing, storing, packaging). Local bulking will 
also be facilitated by the rehabilitation/construction of agricultural roads linking developed lands to 
villages (subcomponent 1.3). Finally, creating such a conducive agricultural trade context may also 
provide seasonal jobs in the agribusiness sector.  
  A second subcomponent 2.2 will focus on creating entrepreneurial opportunities and addressing 
51.
constraints faced by the marginalized landless women and youth to take advantage of the overall 
19  
IFAD: Participatory Natural Resources Management Project PCR, 2016.

Final project design report 
improvement of the local economic context (subcomponent 2.1). With accelerating climate change, 
high youth unemployment and low participation of women in the labour force, there is a clear need to 
develop a diversity of climate resilient income generating activities and opportunities for these groups 
to develop market-led small enterprises in the farming and off-farming rural sectors. Given the initial 
high costs required to develop climate-sensitive small businesses, RELAP will propose a micro-
entrepreneurship facility (MEF) window, which will include climate adaptation as a key criterion for 
award of grants.  
  The implementation process for this component is composed of four steps, described in details 
52.
in appendix 4, and the outcomes for the component will be: i) increased production and marketing of 
agricultural produce by 30%; and ii) the development of 2,575 micro-enterprises that can harness the 
improved market opportunities, amongst whom 900 (33%) are managed by women and youth that will 
have upgraded their productive capacities in farming and off-farming activities.  
Subcomponent 2.1. Rural bulking of agricultural products 
53.
  This subcomponent will comprise two interwoven activities: i) establishment of 30 local Multi-
Stakeholders Rural Platforms (MRPs), and ii) rehabilitation/construction of 10 market and collection 
centres.  
54.
It is foreseen to establish 30 multi MRPs based on the number of “clustered sites/villages” of 
intervention for land development activities whose roles are described in the subcomponent 1.1 and 
1.2. Out of them, ten will also be involved in piloting the rehabilitation/construction of ten market and 
collection centres. Implementation will be phased into two batches of five market & collection centres 
in the targeted governorates. Increasing local trade of agricultural produce relies on two 
complementary pillars: i) Mobilisation and involvement of all market stakeholders (producers and their 
organisations, traders), including the local authorities to develop a shared vision on agricultural 
product bulking and facilitation of market linkages; and ii) Improvement of common economic 
infrastructure as well as adapted local regulations to determine the access to and the use of the 
infrastructure. A MRP is a framework of communication between existing market stakeholders 
amongst whom existing farmers' organisations (groups, associations, cooperatives) are part of. A 
MRP may also facilitate the emergence or the maturation of specific organisations to fulfil newly 
identified roles and services particularly with regards to the management of economic infrastructure.  
  The 10 market focused MRPs will be facilitated in existing "trading nodes" serving surroundings 
55.
villages and will comprise representatives from all agricultural market stakeholder sectors (e.g. 
producers and their organisations including cooperatives, local traders, brokers, transporters, women 
association and youth clubs), including those from neighbouring MRPs where no market investment is 
done. Through regular meetings, the key functions of the MRPs will be: i) to identify and address the 
main constraints affecting marketing of agricultural products (from the area to the central wholesale 
markets20); ii) to collect and share market intelligence (price, volume, opportunities); iii) to build trust 
and develop business to business deals (e.g. between a trader and a producers' group); iv) to act as 
an interface21 with other existing broader platforms/programmes at governorate or national levels 
supported by government and other donors (such as: the FAO-Canada project to support economic 
growth through the optimization of the agriculture value chain and the FAO multi-donor agricultural 
project –MAP, see table 2 below); and v) to organise/participate in events promoting trading of local 
agricultural products (e.g. bulked and processed).  
20   In the West Bank, amongst the 11 central wholesale markets - Al Birah, Beita, Bethleem, Hahlul, Hebron, Jenin, Jericho, 
Nablus, Qabatiya, Qalqilya, Tulkarm - 7 are located in the RELAP governorates of intervention (bolded).  
21   Examples of possible concrete linkages with other projects/programmes more specifically addressing the marketing and 
trade issues : under the MRPs, farmers will bulk their produces, and have the opportunity to get together to access 
processing/marketing facilities offered by other projects/programmes. The RELAP MEF window will be dedicated to the 
youth, women and their associations, but farmers engaged in MRPs (especially the ones receiving support under RELAP 
subcomponents 1.1 and 1.2) will be able to apply for broader/bigger investment support facilities offered by, for instance, 
the multi-donor agricultural project (i.e. call for proposals for investment grants, application for support to pilot new 
processing and/or marketing techniques, etc.).

  MRPs will also be a point of entry to promote PALGAP (Palestine good agricultural practices) 
56.
with both producers and urban clientele with the support of the Palestinian standards Institute (PSI)22. 
The MRPs will directly interact with municipality and village councils for logistical improvement of 
market and collection centres (see paragraph below). MRPs are led by a coordinating committee 
elected by the various representatives ensuring that (i) all main stakeholders are represented, (ii) at 
least 40% are women and (iii) at least 40% are youth. MRPs are a communication tool aiming at 
strengthening synergies between local organised actors; its sustainability will evolve with 
stakeholders' needs. Their role lies in their ability to influence decision makers, either at production, 
marketing or institutional level. More information on MRPs’ different roles is presented in appendix 4, 
particularly in Table 18. 
1,675 rural entrepreneurs, either in production, post-harvesting or trading of agricultural 
57.
products, mostly identified through MRPs, will be supported with management and business 
development trainings to develop their activities. If financial services are required, the MRPs will give 
the opportunity to local MFIs and potential investors to interact and set deals. Vulnerable groups and 
individuals (women youth, landless) will combine the access to these trainings with the access to the 
inclusive MEF window (see subcomponent 2.2). Such training will also be phased to prepare rural 
entrepreneurs to apply to open calls for grants program (FAO) with concrete and well documented 
proposals.  
In each of the governorates of intervention, the RELAP will identify two sites already known as 
58.
trading nodes between several villages benefiting from rehabilitation and reclamation investments 
(component 1). In agreement with local authorities (village or municipalities), these sites will be 
rehabilitated/upgraded as market and collection centres to allow all local market stakeholders to better 
trade and match the supply with a demand of bulked agricultural products. In each area, sites to be 
selected will have to be accessible from the main road to easily access urban centres (connected with 
outlets as wholesale markets, niche and retail markets, agro-processing industry), and to continue to 
serve as a "trading node" bulking agricultural products from small holders. A collection centre will 
consist in a dedicated space with enough parking for trade vehicles and fenced transaction areas, 
small scale buffer storage facilities, ventilated and/or cold storage, to allow few days of storage, 
packaging/weighing equipment, a small administrative office and sanitary facilities. Municipality and 
village councils, in close collaboration with the MRPs, will provide a suitable area and will be the 
owners of the infrastructure considered as a public good.  
Local authorities will transfer the market and collection centres’ management to a legally 
59.
registered managerial body that might be an existing associations/groups belonging to MRP. It will 
recover running and maintenance costs from the collection of affordable user's fees23 (tentatively 2%) 
as it is currently done in the various wholesale central markets (4% in average). (a draft PIM in 
appendix 11 will provide some details – but the full PIM will be prepared during the first year of project 
implementation). Since FOs are part and parcel of MRPs as all local market stakeholders, they 
participate to design the more adapted management set-up and, may either participate in the creation 
of the new company (as shareholders) or directly manage the centre if legally registered and MRP / 
local authorities are satisfied and support it.  
Subcomponent 2.2. Inclusive entrepreneurship development support 
It is foreseen to support the establishment or expansion of 900 rural micro-enterprises by 
60.
investing in their business development and improve their incomes. A non-exhaustive list of eligible 
businesses, drawn from success case stories supported by other donors, includes fattening of small 
ruminants, vegetables / herbs hydroponic production, greenhouse for vegetable production, distributer 
of drip irrigation equipment, small mechanisation, compost production, honey production, mushroom 
production, cheese and herbs processing, agricultural products processing (including dried fruit and 
canned vegetable to increase storage time), packaging and marketing, transport of agricultural

Resilient Land & Resource Management Project 
Final project design report 
products. The MRPs will also support the micro-enterprises development, by helping with business 
identification, management support advice, value chain opportunities and assessment, and support 
for scaling up.  
  This subcomponent will have a clear focus on the inclusivity of rural women, unemployed youth, 
61.
their organizations, and the poor landless at the village level, who will also be encouraged to 
participate in the MRPs. RELAP support will address the key constraints of these groups, including: i) 
the lack of capital and the lack of collateral (including land) required by financial institutions to obtain 
credit; ii) the high real interest rates available from MFIs; iii) the mobility constraints and the 
unreliability of job opportunities in Israel, especially for women and rural youth; and iv) the lack of 
business advice/ technical assistance.  
62.
  The inclusive entrepreneurship development support will be provided through a micro-
enterprise facility (MEF) delivering entrepreneurship investment grants, together with tailored 
technical assistance delivered by business development services (BDS) providers registered under 
Chamber of Commerce. Support will focus on the target groups or individuals in developing or 
expanding climate resilient and market oriented micro and small businesses generating incomes. The 
MRPs will have a catalytic effect on local and agri-based enterprises in the villages and municipalities. 
Proposals with a demonstrated income generation and job creation effect as well as proposals 
contributing to increased production and local availability of agricultural products will be given priority. 
Investment grants could be awarded in instalments against achievement of results, depending on size 
and business plan (to be decided on a case-by-case basis).  
  Applications for investment grants (shared with the MRPs for increased accountability) will be 
63.
channelled to the PMU through municipality and village councils, that will confirm applicants’ 
compliance with eligibility criteria (to ensure exclusive targeting of the vulnerable and landless 
people). The PMU will then confirm the feasibility as well as eligibility, and grants awarding will be 
decided upon by an independent committee (comprising of MoA, the PMU marketing officer, Ministry 
of Social Affairs, EQA, and other potential partners to be identified in the inception phase) that initially 
meets on a monthly basis24. The award committee will be based at the MoA. FIs and particularly MFIs 
are invited to participate in MRPs where they may provide financial intelligence on reviewing 
proposals before submission to the RELAP assessment. However, since MFIs do not contribute in 
any form to the financing plan, they will not be asked to provide a decisive motivated opinion which is 
also a costly exercise for them. However, through their participation in MRPs, they are aware of 
successful applications and can develop financial products to address rural micro-entrepreneurs 
needs in the future on the basis of the lessons drawn from RELAP MEF. 
  The eligibility criteria for the investment grants (maximum of USD 5,000 per individual, with 
64.
possibility to be considered as a group with higher ceiling) will be detailed in the PIM (a draft PIM is 
provided in appendix 11, that will be reviewed, validated and finalized with the PMU during the first 
year of implementation). Only micro-enterprises owned by landless women or youth (below 35 years) 
or their associations will be eligible. These could include individual projects (especially those requiring 
investments on a lower scale) and/or group/collective projects (managed by cooperatives, women 
associations or youth clubs). Formal business registration will not be a requirement, but the micro-
enterprises should be recognized by municipality and village councils. In all cases, applicant(s) must 
demonstrate that the key ownership and decision making is under the control of women and /or youth. 
  All applicants should demonstrate the ability to contribute to the investment with a minimum of 
65.
15% in cash (to be used as investment or working capital). The grants’ award will be decided based 
on criteria to be developed later in the PIM (and in consultation with the MoA and local stakeholders). 
These will include, among others: potential for job creation; agricultural production; and introduction of 
climate adapted technologies. This support will be phased in line with MRPs and market and 
24   While the comparable PMDP awards grants (to larger businesses) on a weekly basis, such a frequency for RELAP would 
be too cumbersome and the available amount for investment grant would not be sufficient.

Component 3: Improved public services for climate resilient agriculture  
  This component will support Palestinian farmers in taking timely and effective action to protect 
66.
their crops and animals from pests, diseases, extreme weather and climatic conditions. To increase 
the resilience of farmers to climate change, this component will strengthen the capacities in absorbing 
climate risk through its anticipation, adoption of new practices through access to knowledge, and 
transformation of livelihood strategies supported by facilitating public services. To overcome current 
critical challenges in Palestine for a transformative change in dealing with climate change impacts on 
agriculture, this component aims to 1) promote public services that enable farmers to take timely and 
risk-informed actions, 2) consolidate capacities of the MoA, EQA, Meteorology Department (PMD) 
and other related actors for advanced information, evidence and programming on climate change 
adaptation in agriculture. In support of the project subcomponent 1.2, this component will develop 
capacities required in MoA to guide climate adaptation in farm-level interventions for land 
development. The component 3 will upscale good adaptation practices and approaches through the 
incorporation in national programming and decision-making using the evidence created in 
subcomponent 1.1 of the resilience benefits of different land development approaches and practices. 
The project will build on and reinforce existing initiatives and capacities (such as the MoA component 
of the Climate Change Capacity Development Program Phase I) and addresses critical gaps for 
upscaling good practices (such as institutional bottlenecks and scattered expertise to implement 
national climate change goals).  
Subcomponent 3.1. Improving agro-climate information and extension services to farmers  
  The objective of this subcomponent is to enable the generation of practical agro-meteorological 
67.
information to support farmers in applying agricultural activities that reduce and mitigate negative 
impacts of weather extremes and climate change on crops and livestock. Outputs and activities under 
this sub-component will include improving agrometeorological observations network covering the main 
agro-ecological zones in the West Bank. This will involve updated capacity assessments and 
feasibility studies to specify instruments needed and the installation design at the project start. 
Subsequently RELAP will procure and upgrade/install (tentatively 12) new synoptic weather stations 
and manual instruments and upgrade existing stations with sensors for measuring atmospheric and 
soil environment parameters (e.g. soil moisture and temperature) according to specifications. Results 
from the testing and monitoring of climate resilient agriculture practices under component 1 and other 
remote sensing, analysis of historical climate data and future trends will be used to model future 
impacts of climate change on main crops and farming systems. Subsequently upscaling potentials of 
different adaptation practices will be assessed. A training curricula, toolbox and manuals will be 
developed for the Climate Change Unit at MoA, focal points at governorate level, extension staff and 
national NGO partners. A series of training of trainers will be provided to significantly strengthen field 
capacities to guide farmers in the adoption of climate resilient agriculture practices.

Sub-component 3.2: Strengthening institutional and technical capacities for the implementation of 
agriculture goals in the National Determined Contributions  
  The objective of this sub-component is to facilitate the implementation of the “Action Plan for 
68.
improving the Institutional Framework for Climate Change in Palestine”. The subcomponent will 
support the horizontal and vertical institutionalization of climate change adaptation in agriculture, 
including efficient mechanisms for the operationalization, partnerships and progress monitoring of 
national goals. Under this sub-component the project foresees the mainstreaming of climate change 
actions into agricultural institutions at both central and local level. Moreover, a plan for upscaling 
validated climate change adaptation practices will be prepared based on the systematic recorded 
evidence under subcomponent 1.1 and the climate impact modelling under subcomponent 3.1. Finally 
support will be granted to strengthening Palestinian agricultural partnerships and initiatives on climate 
change, nationally and internationally. 
D.
  Lessons learned and adherence to IFAD policies and the SECAP 
  Lessons learnt. IFAD has been engaged in Palestine since 1994, and the accumulated 
69.
context-specific knowledge has informed the RELAP design. This section presents the main lessons 
learnt (more details can be found in appendix 3) and how they feed into the RELAP design process 
and future implementation. RELAP will especially build on results and lessons learned from the 
PNRMP, on which there is a robust platform to learn and to scale up from. The RELAP design also 
builds on the experiences from i) IFAD investment projects in NEN countries, ii) the conclusions from 
the PNRMP completion report, iii) the IFAD's Office of Evaluation ongoing performance evaluation of 
the PNRMP (draft available at the time of the detailed design), and iv) those of development partners 
who have been working on agriculture. Core learning include the following: 
Land development remains a key priority. Many donors have been involved in land 
70.
development activities in the West Bank. While many of them are now shifting their support to 
marketing oriented projects, the national agricultural sector strategy 2017-2022 highlights that land 
development needs are still significant and delivery needs acceleration, particularly in Area C. 
Lessons from all land development projects also suggest that land development activities should be 
carried out in a more inclusive and more sustainable way considering the needs of adaptation to 
climate change challenges and reducing the investment cost per dunum. Hence testing and applying 
diversified land development models is needed. Earlier land development practices have proven 
effective in terms of putting more land into production and increasing beneficiary household 
production and income. Still, more needs to be done to develop alternative models and improved 
technologies covering a broader diversity of farming systems and livelihoods. 
  Cost sharing and market terms should be preliminary requirements to land development works. 
71.
First, 100% subsidies contribute to increasing Palestinian farmers’ reliance on assistance and 
discourage many of them to invest in improving their agricultural holdings in hope of getting external 
assistance to do so. Cost sharing in investment – as already done by the PNRMP – is key to 
sustainability and ownership. Secondly, all supported investments should be thought along with an 
analysis of the local market demands, as to ensure that land development activities do not only 
respond to the need of protecting the land, but also to local market terms. 
  Water accessibility and use efficiency is key to sustainable economic outcomes and resilience 
72.
to climate change risks. The need to further focus on water harvesting and management was 
constantly raised by the MoA and by farmers met during the RELAP detailed design mission. IFAD 
experience in Palestine has informed that farmers whose land had a better access to water had 
achieved better economic returns from their lands and were more likely to maintain their agricultural 
lands than others. Improving water accessibility for complementary irrigation is a critical success 
element in any land development intervention. 
  The villages/municipalities as entry point and community-based landscape approaches to 
73.
maximize project impact. PNRMP provided support for land development activities to relatively 
17 
Palestine 
Resilient Land & Resource Management Project 
Final project design report 
scattered individual farmers. To maximize project impact and reduce intervention costs, it is essential 
to maximize land development activities, as much as possible, at village or municipality levels. The 
PNRMP experience also found that adopting a village-based landscape approach would help 
enhance both sustainability and effectiveness (reducing unit costs by allowing intensive works to be 
focused on consolidated plots, and mobilizing community-wide natural resource management 
approaches/plans).  
  Targeting poorer farmers will require a reduction in the cash contribution required from farmers. 
74.
Land development activities, to which small-scale farmers have to contribute substantially (both in 
cash and in kind), may lead to the exclusion of the poorest ones. One of the key lesson from PNRMP 
is that a cash contribution of 25% of land development total cost represents an investment which is 
too costly for small farmers. It is essential to reduce the cash contribution, while balancing with a 
higher in kind-contribution to labour intensive works. Individual farmers receiving RELAP’s support will 
be required to provide a 15% cash-contribution to the machinery works (equivalent to about 5% of 
total investment cost) and a 30% in-kind contribution of labour intensive works, equivalent to about 
20% of total investment cost (details can be found in Appendix 4 and 11). This will also ensure that the 
cost-sharing-for-sustainability principles outlined above can be maintained. 
  Targeting the poorer segments of the rural population requires supporting the non-farm and off-
75.
farm sectors. Experience has demonstrated that the inclusion and provision of benefits to small-scale 
asset rural stakeholders in land development projects is a challenge. This is also true in Palestine, 
where the poorest and most vulnerable rural smallholders are generally not landowners. Their 
inclusion requires to promote the development of economic opportunities in the off-farm sector, and to 
develop mechanisms directly targeting them.  
  Gender participation is not enough to ensure women’s empowerment. Specific activities for 
76.
women’s empowerment (and not just measures to enhance participation) are needed to effectively 
engage with rural women and the youth. The experience from PNRMP and from the JICA financed 
Project on improved Extension for Value Added Agriculture also demonstrated that it is necessary to 
make the project teams understand why gender mainstreaming is important in agricultural projects. 
PMUs shall comprise of a knowledgeable and skilful staff as “gender-in-charge” and provisions for 
capacity development and trainings for the PMUs shall be budgeted. 
  Effective inclusion of the youth. Whether in developing countries or in middle income counties 
77.
(MICs), young people’s access to land is influenced by the perception that young people have not 
reached “maturity” yet and by the shortage of land, the latter being further exacerbated in Palestine. 
Increasingly farming is not perceived as an attractive profession by the young, as it involves hard 
labour and often unstable and low incomes. The youth in Palestine face several constraints with 
regard to employment and building sustainable livelihoods including lack of access to land/ capital, 
lack of collateral required to access finance. These will be addressed through RELAP. Youth will be 
supported through targeted economic incentives to develop or expand off-farm economic activities. 
RELAP will also provide its target groups, including the youth willing to work on farm, with tailored 
support to claim succession or inheritance rights. 
  Market access and value chains. In the West Bank, the barriers to enter a value chain serving 
78.
export markets are often too high for poorer farmers, and in a context where imported food can be 
blocked at any time, it is key to better understand local market requirements that are most relevant to 
small scale farmers and to use this understanding to better guide producers in making decisions that 
will optimise the use of available limited resources. Interventions focussing on agriculture need to 
embrace a market-based approach as a complement to the community approach (exactly the RELAP 
approach), guided by an awareness of end consumers at every step, working through profit-based 
arrangements with private sector entities to address gaps and blockages in product value chains. The 
design approach for MRPs is based on lessons learnt from IFAD (PRODAF Niger, PRELNOR 
Uganda, etc.) as well as those of FAO, UNDP, PMDP-DFID, the Australia Middle East NGO 
Cooperation Agreement Program Phase II (AMENCA II), and the EU in Palestine. Main lessons are 
summarized below, as well as the way RELAP design has addressed and taken them into account: 
18 
Palestine 
Resilient Land & Resource Management Project 
Final project design report 
Local women groups have regularly been supported by development projects and programmes 
 
with the promotion of income generating activities (processed agricultural products and foods, 
processed milk, beekeeping, greenhouses, hydroponics, etc.). Although they are quite successful in 
terms of production capacities, access to reliable markets remain their bigger challenge. Market 
initiatives need to further mainstream gender and women economic empowerment within outputs and 
activities as women empowerment can be facilitated through MRPs, which RELAP will do (sub-
component 2.2). In the RELAP approach, the provision of investment grants will build especially on 
lessons from the DFID financed PMDP. 
 
To better serve local markets, it is important to pool agricultural production at local level, and 
provide farmers with support and advices to base agricultural production decisions on local realities 
and demand. For this to happen, it is important to work with local professional advisors who will be 
engaged to help groups identifying and benefiting from business opportunities while negotiating 
mutually beneficial arrangements with other agribusinesses. This is what RELAP proposes for the 
inclusive entrepreneurship development, supported through a micro-enterprise facility delivering 
entrepreneurship investment grants, together with technical assistance delivered by local business 
development services (BDS) providers registered under Chamber of Commerce. There is a need to 
find the adequate balance between processing new applicants and follow-up on active 
clients/beneficiaries is a challenge for the BDS since the demand for matching grant is always 
increasing. It is therefore important to set realistic targets and inform stakeholders of the MRPs 
accordingly. This has been integrated in the RELAP design, since number of investment grants 
planned over a 6 year period is of 900. 
 
The modality of working at community level (through NGOs, CBOs, local platforms) has proven 
more efficient than targeting individual beneficiaries, and this is the approach which RELAP will follow, 
as these grassroots organisations/set-up facilitate a participatory approach, widening networks and 
mobilising local power. 
The focus on collection centres and support to processing has also been developed based on 
 
findings that most of the smallholders supported by IFAD and other donors sell their products directly, 
and usually unprocessed, on the local market. The civil society sector in Palestine contains many 
capable NGOs and these organisations could assume more responsibilities, including in facilitating 
the MRPs. NGOs will be the main IPs for RELAP components 1 and 2.  
Institutionalization of capacities and ownership building. IFAD has been one of the only donors 
79.
developing projects for implementation directly through government structure. One of the PNRMP 
lessons is that ownership and accountability are higher when management is integrated in the MoA. 
The RELAP will therefore continue relying on permanent and legitimate institutions for 
implementation.

  Adherence to IFAD policies. A summary is presented below, while details are in appendix 12. 
  Alignment with IFAD's strategic framework (SF) 2016-2025. This SF serves as an overarching 
81.
policy guideline to provide direction to IFAD’s work and development effectiveness. RELAP is fully 
aligned with the SF, aiming at an enabling inclusive and sustainable rural transformation. Indeed, 
RELAP will aim at transforming Palestine’s smallholders to become more secure in their land tenure, 
commercially more competitive and climatically more resilient. This will be accomplished by 
strengthening the resilience and improving economic opportunities for the rural poor based on 
competitive farms and agribusinesses that are connected to and integrated into more profitable value 
chains, making sustainable use of Palestine’s land and water resources. In particular, RELAP will 
contribute: i) to increase productive capacities (SF’s first objective), through more secure access to 
and management of natural resources and enhancing agricultural productivity (especially supported 
by component 1); ii) to increase benefits from market participation (SF’s second objective), through 
agricultural roads and facilitation of market linkages; and iii) to strengthen environmental sustainability 
and climate resilience of poor rural people's economic activities (SF’s third objective), through more 
secure access to and sustainable management of NR, increased on-farm climate resilient production,

root causes of fragility (access to natural resources, most notably land). Through component 2, there 
is an integrated and mainstreamed targeting strategy to reach women and youth. Also, and unlike 
most other donors, IFAD is working directly through the MoA to support institution- and nation building, 
itself a prerequisite for reducing fragility.  
  Alignment with IFAD's engagement with middle income countries (MICs). The project will 
83.
develop and test new land development models, ensuring that IFAD supports the country through a 
mix of financial and knowledge products, as recommended by the IFAD’s approach with MICs. Based 
on subcomponent 1.1 and component 3, key knowledge products will be developed to inform land 
development policies and guidelines and upscaling of climate change adaptation practices.  
  Alignment with IFAD's grant financing policy. IFAD’s resources invested in RELAP come from 
84.
the IFAD’s Fund for Gaza and the West Bank and the financing is aligned with the key principles of: i) 
the project makes a contribution to a national public good related to IFAD's mandate through its 
contribution to enhanced food security, productivity and resilience, in a region where food production 
and distribution systems are disrupted by restrictions; and ii) the project focuses on interventions 
where grant financing has added value and comparative advantage over loans (the PA not being 
eligible for financing through the PBAS). 
  Alignment with IFAD’s private sector development and partnership strategy. RELAP is aligned 
85.
with this strategy, placing strong emphasis on further developing and strengthening the linkages of 
smallholder farmers with the private sector. The linkages with local markets, for farmers and their 
organizations where they exist, local women and youth associations, but also other local stakeholders 
will be facilitated under the RELAP second component. Also, climate information received by farmers, 
thanks to the RELAP third component, will help them to make better market decision, thus ensuring 
more viable market prospects for agricultural products. Finally, the RELAP will follow an approach that 
works backwards from the market to ensure that there is a demand for the products of the smallholder 
and that market links are established with local traders/buyers prior to initiation of any activities.  
  Alignment with IFAD's policies on inclusive targeting, youth and gender mainstreaming. Women 
86.
and youth are given a clear focus in the project, with specific targets and separate budget line items 
allocated for them. RELAP's approaches and implementation modalities across components are in 
line with the guiding principles of the targeting policy including: focusing on “active poor”; and 
expanding outreach to include those with fewer assets or opportunities, addressing gender 
differences.  
  Alignment with IFAD's climate change strategy. IFAD recognizes that the speed and intensity of 
87.
climate change are outpacing the ability of poor rural people and societies to cope. RELAP takes 
cognisance of the fact that poor rural people are in the front line of climate change impacts: the 
ecosystems and biodiversity on which they rely on are increasingly degraded. 
  The project incorporates IFAD’s assessment that climate-related risks, and potential 
88.
opportunities, can be addressed more systematically within its projects activities and policy advice. 
The project will make use of the IFAD and GCF resources to integrate climate change and 
environmental concerns. It will: i) help smallholder farmers to build their resilience to climate change 
(key objective of RELAP first and the third component); ii) help them to take advantage of adaptation 
incentives and funding (basis of the engagement with the GCF and focus of the small investment 
grants under RELAP second component); iii) inform a more coherent dialogue on climate change 
(RELAP subcomponent 3.2 focusing on strengthening institutional capacities and partnerships, with 
activities directly supporting the Action Plan for improving the Institutional Framework for Climate 
Change and the implementation of the NAP). Also, weather stations are being planned to assist 
vulnerable farmers with timely information on changes in weather, rainfall, temperatures and their use 
in shaping decisions regarding watering, use of adapted crop varieties, animal breeds and other

adaptation measures. The investments to be undertaken within RELAP will promote resilience and 
take into account the vulnerability of the target areas in terms of water shortage, salinity and post-
harvest losses.  
  Environmental and social category (more details are available in the SECAP note, 
89.
appendix 13). Potential adverse environmental impacts (e.g. unintentional removal of topsoil in land 
development, or excessive use of agrochemicals in e.g. greenhouses and other irrigated production) 
will be mitigated by: i) the development, testing and scaling-up of less invasive land development 
practices; ii) the careful consideration of land-use suitability (based on soil types, rainfall and water 
availability and land capabilities), which, combined with market opportunities, will be the basis for 
deciding on land development approaches, production activities and cropping and livestock 
management plans to avoid unsustainable land uses; and iii) provide capacity building in integrated 
pest management and safe (both for farmers and consumers) and environmentally responsible use of 
pesticides and handling of empty containers. Works in terracing and the rehabilitation or construction 
of rural roads, will be subject to an assessment of eventual environmental risks to be mitigated as part 
of the engineering design. RELAP will develop mechanisms to target the poor and vulnerable 
households, and will, as such, have positive social impacts. Considering that environmental 
improvements and social inclusion are at the heart of RELAP and potential negative impacts are 
mitigatable, the project is categorized as B. 
  Climate risk category (details in the SECAP note). Climate change and variability historical 
90.
trends and future scenarios for the West Bank have been analysed in details during the design 
presented in appendix 13. The trends shows steadily increase in temperature and concentration of 
rainfalls in fewer months with heavier rain as detailed in paragraph 13. Because of the low average 
annual rainfall from 100mm – 700mm depending on location and the restrictions on Palestinian’s 
access to groundwater resources the impacts of climate change is primarily adding water stress to an 
already challenging situation. The RELAP is addressing in particular the issue of water stress in land 
development approaches as the most important impact of climate change on farmers and rural 
villages as described above. The main component 1 will focus at increasing climate resilience of a 
diversity of farming systems and rural livelihoods by promoting practices for soil moisture 
conservation, local rainwater harvesting and water-use efficiency in complementary irrigation. The 
resilience of landless rural women and unemployed youth will also be supported through applying a 
climate resilience criterion for the selection of micro-businesses to be supported by small investment 
grants targeting in particular these groups. Green Climate Fund financing, is in the process of being 
mobilized and will be invested to ensure climate adaptation and resilience of infrastructures and 
livelihood strategies of rural poor. With this mainstreamed resilience focus, the climate risk to RELAP 
is assessed to be moderate. 
III.  Project implementation 
A.
  Approach 
  A key ambition of RELAP is to promote institutional development among its core partners. In 
91.
this regard, the project will contribute to institutional development and outcomes in several ways, 
including: i) the establishment of the PMU in the MoA, which will have overall responsibility for 
implementing RELAP (see below); ii) the promotion of adaptive and inclusive land development 
practices, for further scaling-up by government; iii) the development and establishment of 
institutionalised support and advisory services for the promotion of the rural poor’s market integration 
and bulking of agricultural produce; iv) capacity development of government structures and other 
stakeholders in utilising climate information; and v) support to and expansion of public-private-NGO 
partnerships in climate adaptive infrastructure and land development models. Details can be found in 
appendices 4 and 5. Especially the work on land development practices and models is expected to 
generate useful knowledge products on low cost highly adaptive interventions that have better 
inclusion and gender sensitivity. This is also expected to inform the IFAD – PA policy dialogue.

Similarly with the work on climatic modelling and forecasting will constitute a knowledge platform upon 
which farmers will be able to make better informed decision on adaptation practices related to e.g. 
crop choice, planting regimes, irrigation practices and other climate related issues. 
B.
  Organizational framework 
  The Ministry of Finance and Planning (MoFP) will be the Recipient Representative, responsible 
92.
for the negotiation and signature of the financing agreement (FA) with IFAD, the management of 
donor funds and government contribution (including tax exemption), and the reporting to IFAD, in 
particular the submission of annual audited financial statements. 
  The MoA will be the lead agency, responsible for the RELAP implementation, through direct 
93.
and regular consultation with the EQA and other involved stakeholders. The general directorate of the 
agricultural land/MoA will be responsible for ensuring that all aspects of implementation are carried 
out in accordance with the project FA and agreed annual work plans and budgets (AWPB). 
  A project steering committee (PSC) will be established at national level to: i) provide policy 
94.
guidance and strategic directions, ii) ensure alignment/complementarity/integration of RELAP with 
projects financed by other donors in the West Bank, and iii) approve the project AWPBs. The PSC will 
be established by a P.A decree and will be chaired by the MoA. The PSC members will include: i) all 
MoA general directors involved in RELAP implementation and/or monitoring, ii) the Minister’s Advisor 
for climate change and national focal point for UNFCCC and IPCC/EQA, iii) representatives of the 
Ministry of Social Affairs, the Ministry of Women Affairs, the MoFP, and Palestine Trade Centre 
(PALTRADE) , as well as iv) ad-hoc technical resource persons to be invited by the MoA as and when 
needed (e.g. the chamber of commerce and farmers’ organisations). The PSC will meet twice a year 
to approve the AWPBs and take stock of their implementation in the middle of each year. The project 
director will be the Secretary of the PSC, responsible for preparing the minutes of the PSC meetings.  
 A technical committee will be established to ensure coordination of implementation within and 
95.
between components consisting of all implementing partners, including NGOs, NARC, FAO and PWA, 
PMD, field coordinators, PMU and others as needed. The technical committee will meet monthly 
invested and hosted by the PMU.  
  A PMU will be established in Ramallah and will be responsible for overseeing RELAP 
96.
implementation, in coordination with implementing partners and service providers. The PMU will 
produce the AWPBs and the associated procurement plans (PPs) to be submitted to the PSC for 
review and approval, and subsequently to IFAD for no objection. Likewise, the PMU will take the lead 
in the procurement of civil works for sub-component 1.3 and for contracting partner NGOs under 
components 1 and 2. The PMU will be integrated into the MoA, will be led by the general directorate 
of agricultural land, and will be vested with financial and technical autonomy. Its staffing, as well as 
time allocation for the seconded staff, have been discussed and agreed upon with the MoA, based on 
a careful assessment of activities to be carried out. Leading the PMU will be the project director, 
seconded from the general directorate of agricultural land on and 60% part-time basis, to ensure full 
alignment with government policies and priorities as well as allowing for mainstreaming and scaling up 
of successful RELAP engagements. Other key positions include a full time depute director, a climate 
change specialist (with robust focus on water and irrigation issues), a land development engineer and 
an agricultural road engineer. The detailed information on staffing can be found in appendix 5.  
97.
Implementation arrangements. A summary of the proposed implementing partners and 
implementation arrangements is presented below, while details can be found in appendices 5 and 11. 
The PMU will be responsible for establishing mechanisms to ensure linkages and synergies between 
the 3 technical components as well as facilitating information sharing with stakeholders and the PSC 
Implementation arrangements for component 1. The overall implementation and coordination of 
98.
the RELAP first component will be under the direct responsibility of the PMU. For subcomponent 1.1, 
the PMU will assume overall responsibility and supervision of activities, will define scope of 
collaboration with NARC, and will recruit the partner NGO who will design (with NARC support) and 
22 
Palestine 
Resilient Land & Resource Management Project 
Final project design report 
train MoA staff in implementing the monitoring and testing programme. The actual field 
implementation of activities for land development for orchards under sub-component 1.2 will be the 
responsibility of NGOs, selected on a competitive basis by the PMU, while the PMU will be 
responsible for the direct implementation of activities related to wadis land reclamation, conservation 
agriculture in crop-livestock systems, and rangeland rehabilitation contracting technical assistance 
from NGOs and individual experts as needed. The PMU will also be responsible for implementation of 
sub-component 1.3.  
  Besides general activities (information campaign, monitoring and evaluation, preparation of 
99.
AWPBs and PP, progress reporting, etc.), the tasks of the PMU under component 1 will also include: i) 
the preliminary screening and selection of villages and municipalities which will receive proposals for 
land development investments, ii) the final approval of investment proposals, in consultation with 
village and municipality councils, iii) the selection and supervision of participating NGOs, iv) the 
selection of proposals for agricultural roads investments, v) the review and approval of designs 
provided by the selected villages/municipalities, vi) the procurement of works for roads investments, 
and vii) the supervision of works through private sector consultant to be selected on a competitive 
basis. The main tasks of the participating NGOs will be: i) following-up on the preliminary screening of 
investment proposals, ii) conducting baseline data collection, feasibility study and ranking of qualified 
proposals before providing to the PMU the list of selected proposals for approval, iii) further to the 
PMU approval, proceeding with agreements signing with selected municipalities/villages and farmers, 
iv) developing detailed designs and engineering estimates for selected investment proposals, v) 
procuring and supervising related civil works, and vi) providing technical assistance to beneficiary 
farmers in agricultural and irrigation practice, as well as in legal aspects of land certification as it 
would be required. The various steps for identification, screening, ranking and selection of the 
investment proposals for land development are described in detail in appendix 5 as well as in the draft 
PIM presented in appendix 11 (which is already quite thorough for implementation of component 1). 
Implementation arrangements for component 2. The overall implementation of component 2 will 
100.
be under the responsibility of the PMU: an agribusiness expert will join PMU through an open 
recruitment process, and a third-time seconded marketing officer from the directorate of agricultural 
marketing) will support this unit. The main implementing partners for the component will be NGOs, 
competitively recruited and supervised by the PMU. MRPs are facilitated by a competitively recruited 
implementing partner (NGO) on the basis of ToR focusing on (i) social engineering and (ii) 
management and business development and, (iii) marketing support. Linkages between MRPs and 
other platforms/forums/commodity councils (including other projects and programmes), will be 
facilitated by the PMU in Ramallah and in coordination with district officers, and municipality and 
village councils. Also, FAO being a partner of most of the ongoing marketing and trade initiatives, the 
PMU will closely coordinate with FAO (who also implement RELAP component 3) on a regular basis 
to identify fields of collaboration and synergies.  
  The MEF will be administered by the PMU, and grants will be awarded by a MoA chaired 
101.
“inclusive entrepreneurship committee” (details are provided in the draft PIM but will be 
reviewed/finalized during the first year of implementation). The roles and complementarities of the 
main RELAP implementation partners for component 2 are detailed appendix 5.  
Implementation arrangements for component 3. FAO will be the main RELAP implementing 
102.
partner for component 3, and will deliver activities together with local and national NGOs (which will 
be selected and supervised by FAO). To ensure coordination and complementarity of project activities 
under components 1, 2 and 3, FAO will work based on the RELAP approved AWPBs and will directly 
report to the PMU. For component 3, FAO will also be responsible for procurement of goods and 
services. FAO will work under the supervision of the PMU/MoA and will provide the PMU with 
narrative and financial progress reporting, as per the clauses and provisions included in RELAP 
financing agreement. To ensure that RELAP activities are delivered in a coherent manner, it will be 
important that the FAO coordinator for component 3 is based in Ramallah.

Planning 
  Towards the end of each fiscal year, the PMU will prepare a results-oriented AWPB for the next 
103.
fiscal year. Using the template shown in appendix 11, this document will identify, for each sub-
component: i) the detailed outputs to be produced, and the related physical targets, ii) the key 
activities, sub-activities and inputs required in order to deliver planned outputs, iii) the timetable for 
implementation of key activities, iv) the responsible entity for each activity and sub-activity, and v) the 
financial resources for implementing planned activities and acquiring planned inputs. The key 
reference for the preparation of the AWPBs will be: i) the detailed log-frame (annex 1, appendix 2); ii) 
the description of activities (appendix 4); and iii) the cost tables. The PDR and cost tables shall not, 
however, constitute a rigid blueprint, and the original log-frame targets and financial envelopes may 
need to be revised at mid-term, upon recommendations of the mid-term review and IFAD’s approval. 
If the first AWPB will be drafted during the start-up workshop, the preparation of subsequent 
104.
AWPBs shall follow an iterative process, starting around September each year with the consultation of 
all involved stakeholders and implementing partners. Facilitated by the PMU, this process will provide 
with the opportunity to reflect on past performance, discuss implementation issues and identify 
preliminary annual targets. On this basis, the consolidated AWPB will be prepared by the PMU and 
submitted to the PSC for approval. After approval by the PSC, the AWPB (accompanied by the PP) 
shall be submitted to IFAD for no-objection no later than 60 days before the end of the fiscal year (i.e. 
by 31st October each year), together with the minutes of the PSC. In case IFAD would want to 
introduce changes to the AWPB, the PMU shall inform the PSC about such changes25. The final, 
approved AWPB and PP will constitute binding documents that will govern, throughout the year, 
IFAD’s decisions related to funds’ release or procurement matters. They may be amended in the 
course of the year at the request of the PMU if proper justification is provided, and upon prior IFAD’s 
no-objection. 
Monitoring and evaluation 
  Purpose and scope. The PMU M&E officer will be responsible to establish a M&E system, the 
105.
main purpose of which will be to provide project management, government and IFAD with reliable and 
timely information on project execution performance and results, so that corrective actions may be 
taken on a timely basis to ensure that implementation remains both efficient (i.e. results are obtained 
at reasonable costs) and effective (i.e. goods and services are delivered and intended outcomes are 
achieved). More precisely, the M&E system will aim at:  
Monitoring execution: tracking activities and outputs against planned, physical targets 
 
(identified in the AWPB), and monitoring quality of products and services delivered. This will also help 
inform log-frame output indicators, including 1st level RIMS26 indicators. 
Monitoring outreach: M&E activities will play a critical role in ensuring that the right target

output and outcome indicators of the NASS 2017-2022. The M&E system shall also be developed 
considering reporting requirements of the GCF. A specific scorecard for monitoring the resilience of 
beneficiary household is proposed in Annex 2 to appendix 6. The M&E tools, processes, 
responsibilities and data requirements will be described in the M&E Manual (part of the PIM) and will 
have to be finalized within 3 months of project start (see appendix 11, M&E manual outline). Under all 
components, the primary responsibility for collecting the data will be vested with each project 
implementer (NGOs, local MoA staff, FAO). Standard data collection forms and reporting templates 
will be the key tools used by project implementers. For transparency purposes, all key outputs and 
capacity building support provided under each component shall be geo-referenced and mapped 
digitally, using a simple GIS technology. The M&E officer will use a central, Excel-based database to 
record and manage all the data necessary to monitor project execution and outreach.  
  M&E results’ measurement. Using complete baseline data of the socio-economic situation of 
107.
beneficiaries prior to their participation in project activities, the measurement of results (outcomes and 
impact) will seek to quantity the changes in the resilience and incomes of direct beneficiaries, as well 
as changes in land productivity, agricultural production and marketing opportunities that can be 
directly attributable to project interventions. For women and the youth, an additional focus will be on 
measuring changes in social status or sense of empowerment. The following tools will be used: 
Village-level baseline surveys will be undertaken upon villages’ selection to collect secondary 
 
data on the economic characteristics of the population;  
Other important baseline data on specific socio-economic characteristics of beneficiary 
 
households prior to their participation in project activities will be collected upon selection of each 
beneficiary. This baseline will concern subcomponents 1.2, 1.3 and 2.1 beneficiaries. Under 
subcomponent 1.1. a specific M&E system will be set-up by the partner NGO; 
Under component 1.1. a specific M&E system will be established with the support from a 
 
partner NGO, in collaboration with the PMU and the National Agricultural Research Centre (NARC), in 
order to measure in a scientific way adaptation benefits, stability and level of yields, improvements in 
soil quality, as well as any other pertinent aspects, among selected households practicing climate 
resilient land development and management;  
Monitoring of changes in beneficiary household resilience is a particular feature of the 
 
monitoring of the RELAP impact at goal level, which will be done using a resilience scorecard. The 
questions proposed to be included in the scorecard are presented in appendix 13 section G.2 linked 
to RELAP supported activities addressing climate risks and vulnerabilities. The draft resilience 
scorecard, to be finalized during project start up, is presented in annex 2 to appendix 6;  
Outcome surveys will be conducted among a small sample of actual project beneficiaries (some 
 
200 households) by local MoA and PMU staff, under the supervision of the M&E Officer, on an annual 
basis starting project Year 1. They will help document beneficiaries’ satisfaction with project support 
and interventions as well as the direct outcomes of project interventions;  
Farmers’ and entrepreneurs’ records: Beneficiaries will be requested to keep records of key

  M&E reporting. Based on i) the monthly activity reports and annual progress reports, and ii) on 
108.
the activity reports, the M&E Officer will prepare 6-monthly and annual progress reports, to be 
submitted to IFAD for information. IFAD’s RIMS reporting will be done during supervision missions. 
Towards the end of the third year of implementation a Mid-Term Review (MTR) will be jointly 
organized by the government and IFAD. Before the project completion date, a Project Completion 
Review (PCR) will also be jointly organized by the government and IFAD. Both the MTR and PCR 
processes shall be informed by the findings of the mid-term and completion surveys. 
Learning and knowledge management 
  RELAP is expected to pilot new approaches and models for land development and draw out 
109.
lessons learnt from upscaling these models with farmers. The project implementation is expected to 
generate useful lessons in a number of key thematic areas, which may be of value to MoA and EQA 
policy makers and other stakeholders.  
110.
  Capturing, documenting and disseminating learnings and experience will be one of the key 
tasks of the M&E and KM officers. For this, they will establish a KM and communication plan, within 
12 months of project start. This plan will be developed in consultation with the MoA, EQA, FAO, and 
NGOs selected as implementing partners (i.e. for the KM plan to be realistic, relevant and commonly 
understood, it can only be developed once all partners are on board). The KM plan will aim at 
collecting, documenting and disseminating lessons and best practices emerging from the project. It 
will define realistic targets for information dissemination, timeframe as well as appropriate formats 
(e.g. brochures, case studies, articles, newsletter, audio and video, web, etc.). This knowledge-
sharing process will be integrated into project workshops and management, with key findings routinely 
disseminated across the PSC and to donors/ partners in the agricultural sector working group.  
  Close linkages between M&E activities and KM activities will ensure that the lessons generated 
111.
are credible and based on evidence. For more complex policy issues, initial project lessons and 
experience may need to be complemented with more in-depth policy studies or analysis. FAO, who 
will implement the RELAP third component, and who has a robust experience in supporting policy 
studies in the country will also be an important partner for the generation and dissemination of lessons 
learnt and best practices. In particular, activities implemented under component 3 will enable MoA and 
EQA to develop models on key crops and water/soil resources under different climate change 
scenarios. KM will not only flow to ministries or other partners, but to village and municipality councils 
and farmers. Agro-climate information bulletins will provide clear analyses and recommendations for 
farmers to reduce their vulnerabilities to climate change.

  Financial management, procurement and governance 
  Overall risk assessment. The country inherent risk is rated as high in light of the highly volatile 
112.
political and security situation, and weaknesses highlighted in the 2013 PEFA and the 2016 World 
Bank Public Expenditure Review (PER) reports. In spite of significant progress shown in recent years 
by the P.A in terms of efficiency, accountability, and transparency of its public financial management 
system (PFM), further improvements are still necessary in budget preparation and execution, public 
disclosures, fiscal relations between central and local governments, accounting policies/practices and 
internal controls. In addition, the currently ongoing public procurement reform is yet to be fully 
implemented. With regard to public expenditure, although the PA has made major efforts to reduce the 
budget deficit and to fund the capital investment program from domestic resources, the PER report 
has highlighted the need to address the current fiscal situation; the substantial dependence on foreign 
aid; the very low level of public investment; the heavy reliance on public sector employment to 
increase economic growth (as evidenced by the high public sector wage bill); and the average quality 
of public services. Finally, though no Transparency International scoring was conducted, the literature 
available suggests that, despite improvements, corruption remains a problem in the West Bank.

financial and administrative autonomy. The fiduciary team will be composed of a finance officer, a 
procurement officer and an accounts & administrative assistant, all recruited through a competitive 
process. The project internal control mechanisms (and its linkages to the MoA internal controls 
system) will be detailed in the financial and administrative procedures manual, to be drafted and 
submitted to IFAD’s approval prior to first disbursement. The IFMIS currently in use by the MoA is not 
adapted to project accounting, and does not provide the required financial statements and reports. As 
a condition precedent to the first disbursement, the PMU will therefore acquire and install an 
accounting software designed for project accounting, allowing for (i) recording and reporting of 
transactions by component, category, source of fund, AWPB activity and geographical location, (ii) 
budget monitoring, (iii) automated bank reconciliations, (iv) contract management and monitoring of 
financial commitments, (v) production of the required financial reports and statements including those 
related to contributions in kind, and, (vi) possibly, the automated production of withdrawal applications. 
The PMU will be required to produce monthly financial reports to inform project parties on financial 
progress and constraints, as well as quarterly interim financial reports to be submitted within 30 days 
after the end of each reporting period. At the latest 2 months after the end of each fiscal year, the 
PMU will submit its unaudited annual financial statements (in accordance with IPSAS cash basis of 
accounting) to IFAD and to the external auditors.

ensure easy flow of funds and avoid delays in project implementation. Project accounts (also in USD) 
will be opened for PMU payments, which will be processed through the government IFMIS system. In 
order to expedite the effective launch of project activities, start-up costs limited to USD 200 000 will be 
authorized prior to the satisfaction of disbursement conditions. 27 A chart of the flow of funds is shown

utilities, PMU operating costs and salaries). Payments from the counterpart cash contribution will be 
managed through a separate bank account, recorded separately in the RELAP accounting system, 
and reported separately in both the quarterly interim financial reports and the annual financial 
statements. 
  Audit. The Palestinian state audit institution, the State Audit & Administrative Control Bureau, 
118.
does not currently have the capacity to conduct external audits of donor-funded projects. The Bureau 
was requested to participate in or conduct the RELAP annual audit as soon as it becomes feasible. In 
the meantime, the annual external audit of the project will be carried out by an independent audit firm 
acceptable to IFAD, in accordance with the International Standards on Auditing and the IFAD 
27   Start-up costs will be authorized for expenditures related to: recruitment of the PMU contracted staff and salaries for first 3 
months; start-up workshops; installation of the accounting software (including acquisition of license, customization and 
training); drafting of the PIM; procurement of the IT equipment and the project vehicle; selection of the implementing 
partners (NGOs); and baseline survey.

Guidelines for Project Audits, and based on terms of reference subject to IFAD no objection. The final 
audit report and management letter are required to be submitted to IFAD by the Recipient at the latest 
6 months after the end of each fiscal year. With regard to internal audit, the MoA unit in charge 
currently lacks the human and financial resources necessary to conduct project audits, As an 
alternative, the MoA is encouraged to submit an official request to MoFP for the use of their Internal 
Audit Unit as internal auditors of RELAP.  
  Procurement. Although the legal and regulatory framework adopted by the P.A is in line with 
119.
international standards and IFAD procurement guidelines, most of the related institutional 
arrangements and instruments are still not operational. Consequently, the procurement of goods, 
works and services will be conducted in accordance with the IFAD Project Procurement Guidelines 
and Procurement Handbook, the provisions of the FA and the Letter to the Recipient, and the RELAP 
financial and administrative procedures manual. Prior to the start of each fiscal year, the PMU will 
prepare a detailed PP derived from the AWPB. The PP will be submitted (together with the AWPB) to 
the PSC for approval and to IFAD for no objection. The PP will be presented by component and type 
of procurement, and for each envisaged procurement, it will indicate the AWPB reference, the 
estimated cost, the procurement method, the need for IFAD prior review (based on applicable 
thresholds) and the timeline for execution of the procurement process until contract signature. An 
assessment of the current procurement systems and the MoA procurement capacity is included in 
appendix 8.  
  Governance. The primary responsibility for detecting fraud and corruption lies with the 
120.
Recipient. However, the project should note that IFAD applies a zero-tolerance policy towards 
fraudulent, corrupt, collusive or coercive actions in projects financed through its loans and grants. The 
dissemination of IFAD’s anti-corruption policy28 amongst project staff and stakeholders, as well as the 
adoption of IFAD procurement guidelines for RELAP procurement should reinforce the use of good 
practices. In addition, RELAP will promote good governance through the involvement of 
municipalities, villages and beneficiaries in (i) the preparation of the annual work plans and budgets; 
(ii) the implementation of project activities; and (iii) the monitoring and evaluation of project activities. 
E.
  Supervision 
121.
  The project will be directly supervised by IFAD. At least one supervision mission will be 
organized each year, supported by regular implementation support and/or follow-up missions. The 
supervision exercise will provide continuous feedback regarding the RELAP coordination and 
management, particularly with respect to the progress made towards the achievement of the targets, 
and the likelihood of reaching the intended objective and the overall goal. Supervision will allow for the 
following activities: i) policy dialogue, ii) fine-tuning of implementation procedures, iii) revising 
agreements/contracts with partner NGOs, and iv) revising design to respond to unforeseen problems 
and issues. OFID, who will co-finance RELAP, will be invited to participate in supervision missions. 
The supervision planning will also be shared with the GCF, who may wish to join the supervision 
missions.

Risks may arose from a big number of implementing agents (NGOs, municipalities / councils...) but

the subsequent operation and maintenance hereof, as well as the processing of the data into 
actionable recommendations that farmers will utilise. To counter this risk a thorough needs and cost-
effectiveness analysis will take place, including farmers demands and utility of the data to be 
produced. Another risk could come from a lack of coordination between the PMU and FAO in 
implementing the component’s activities. However, this risk is mitigated by the fact that i) FAO will 
implement activities based on agreed AWPBs and ii) EQA will be part of the PSC.

Risk  
Rating   Mitigation Measures  
Table 3: Risk Matrix 
Political and institutional risks 
Closure of movement of people and 
markets, which can: i) stifle the economy 
quickly and directly given its reliance on 
Israel, and ii) reduce demand as many 
Palestinians work in Israel but spend 
their income in Palestine.  
Volatility in parts of Area C which are 
adjacent to the separation wall, 
settlements or Israeli roads could 
hamper land development and 
subsequent production  
Insufficient cooperation between MoA, 
EQA and FAO could undermine the 
needed CC adaptation focus and 
eventual CGF co-financing. 
Delays in staffing, project start up and 
disbursement 
Component 1 
Political priorities may not always be 
consistent with procedures established 
for the selection of villages/municipalities 
and investment proposals. 
Inadequate technical models for land 
development/improvement that could 
increase the investment cost. 
Implementing NGOs have incentive to 
inflate cost as they tend to be paid as 
share of total 
Inadequate operation and maintenance 
of constructed/rehabilitated facilities. 
High 
No project can address this problem, but through 
having more domestic food production and by offering 
more income generation rural opportunities (including 
jobs), as well as easier connections to central 
wholesale markets the resilience of rural households to 
such shocks will be increased by the RELAP 
Medium  RELAP intervention in Area C will only focus on non-
sensitive areas within the Area C (i.e. there will be no 
RELAP investments near the separation wall, Israeli 
settlements and/or Israeli roads). Land development 
works will i) only be done on land with property titles, 
and ii) in partnership with NGOs who can help liaising 
with the relevant Israeli authorities in case of problems. 
The PMU will also be staffed with professionals who 
well aware of the local environment and political 
sensitivities. Alternative plans will also be considered in 
the case implementation problems would occur in Area 
C, e.g. (and only if need be) shifting part of the 
investments to Area B after mid-term review. 
Medium  EQA will be in the RELAP steering committee and will 
closely work with the climate change department of the 
MoA. FAO will be an implementing partner reporting 
directly to the MoA/PMU. Strict modalities for lines of 
responsibilities, reporting and implementation 
modalities are agreed to.  
Medium  Use of IFAD grant to facilitate start-up. Key staff will be 
trained in IFAD procedures and processes at project 
start. Most of the PMU is to be seconded, and for the 
position to be recruited from the market, this could be 
done from IFAD board approval (using start-up costs 
and before conditions for disbursement are met. 
Medium  Empowerment of villages/communities in decision 
making. The approval process of AWPBs, in 
conjunction with the programmatic approach in which 
programme works will be selected on an annual basis 
provides opportunities to fine tune decision making 
during implementation and to minimize the risk that 
such adverse effects could occur. 
Medium  The sub-component 1.1 for capacity development and 
applied research for cost-efficient land development is 
designed to minimize this risk 
Medium  Strict monitoring by PMU. Appliance of new low-cost 
methods as developed in component 1.1. Possible 
improvements to the remuneration formula for NGOs. 
Medium  Strict application by PMU of selection criteria requiring 
adequate proposals for future O&M for agricultural 
roads by village/municipality councils, and required 
cash and in-kind contributions by the 
villages/municipalities and farmers will minimize this 
risk. 
For selected infrastructure schemes the participating 
NGOs and PMU will be responsible for ensuring that all 
environmental assessment requirements have been 
met during the design and construction stages.

A.
  Project costs 
  RELAP is financed over a six-year (6) period, and it is assumed to start in the course of the 
126.
second semester of 2018. Costs have been estimated on the basis of prices prevailing during the 
project detailed design in September 2017. 
  Project costs by components. Project investments are organized into four (4) major 
127.
components: i) Climate adaptive land development (61% of the total costs), ii) Market linkages for the 
rural poor (19.4% of the total costs), iii) Improved public services for upscaling climate resilient 
agricultural land use and production systems (12.1% of the costs), and iv) Project management and 
M&E (7.5% of the costs). A summary breakdown of the project costs by components is shown in Table 
4 below.

  Project financing 
  The total project costs of USD 41.44 million will be financed by an IFAD grant (from the Fund 
128.
for Gaza and the West Bank - FGWB) of USD 4.56 million (confirmed), ii) a cash contribution from the 
government of USD 1.17 million (confirmed), iii) an OFID grant of USD 1 million (confirmed), iv) an in-
kind contribution from the government currently estimated at USD 6.57 million29, v) an in kind and 
cash contribution from beneficiaries, respectively of USD 3.61 million and USD 1.28 million (in the 
form of cash, casual labour, and some inputs and equipment), and vi) a contribution toward the road 
construction from the village councils (estimated at USD 0.24 million). Funds of approximately USD 
23 million – including a grant from the Green Climate Fund (GCF) of USD 15 million and a grant of 
approximately USD 8 million from other partners/entities - are to be budgeted as a financing gap. 
IFAD, MOA and EQA will be in constant contact with the GCF and other potential co-financiers to 
mobilize this amount to fill the financing gap or otherwise seek alternative financing sources. The 
financing plan is summarized in cost by financier below. 
Table 5:Cost by financer 
  For detailed information on project cost and financing, reference is made to appendix 9, which 
129.
includes a more elaborate explanation, as well as a complete set of summary and detailed costs 
tables in its Attachments. Also, based on confirmation of co-financing from the GCF and other entities, 
the overall budget and financing plan will be revised at start-up. In case the co-financing of the GCF 
and other entities would not materialize, component 3 would be dropped while components 1 and 2 
would be downscaled in geographical coverage (reducing the number of villages supported and the 
number of beneficiaries). This was discussed and agreed upon with government and would not 
change the nature of the RELAP design, which would still have climate change adaptation strongly 
mainstreamed into components 1 and 2. 
C.
  Summary benefits and economic analysis 
130.
  Project benefits. Benefits are expected to derive from i) enhanced access to productive 
agricultural land and water through a range of investments in land development, agricultural roads, 
soil improvements, and rain water harvesting facilities, ii) strengthened smallholders’ resilience to 
current and anticipated impacts of climate variability and change through adapted agricultural land-
uses and practices, and improved soil and water management, iii) improved market linkages at cluster 
levels, and iv) entrepreneurship development support, which will focus on creating economic 
opportunities for women and youth. Furthermore, it is important to highlight that through land 
development interventions, by turning unproductive or semi-productive lands into productive ones, 
registered owners of the lands would increase the rights that they have on the land and therefore 
decrease the possibility of land confiscation by the State. Indeed, according to the Ottoman law code 
in West Bank (of 1848 and today still in force), "if a registered land is not cultivated for three 
successive years, it may become the property of the Ottoman State, i.e. “State Land”. To represent 
project financial benefits, 12 financial farm and activity models have been prepared. They form the 
building blocks of the economic analysis.  
29   It will cover VAT, salaries of seconded staff, office space and utilities

  Number of beneficiaries30. RELAP is expected to benefit about 30,000 households, or 150 
131.
000 direct beneficiaries, considering an average household size of 5 in West Bank31.Approximately 2 
700 households will benefit from resilient and equitable land development activities; 4 500 households 
– including 1 850 not benefiting from land development - will benefit from agricultural roads 
construction; 900 households will benefit from inclusive entrepreneurship development support; and 6 
650 households will benefit from cluster development support – out of which 4 000 households will 
exclusively benefit from cluster development support and 2 650 households will also benefit from 
access to grants and resilient land development activities . Finally, 30,000 households will directly 
benefit from component 3's activities, including climate resilient trainings and enhanced 
information/knowledge sharing. The below table summarizes the beneficiaries' phasing-in by activity. 
For economic analysis purposes only, an 85% beneficiary’s adoption rate is considered (see appendix 
10). 
Table 6: Direct household beneficiaries' phasing-in by main activity 
  Summary of financial models’ results. Based on field visits, PNRMP's activities, national 
132.
statistics, and on expected project activities, a number of indicative financial models were identified 
during the project design process. Twelve illustrative financial models were prepared to demonstrate 
the financial viability of the investments: seven resilient land development financial models: i) orchard 
land reclamation with terrace on slope between 10-30%, ii) orchard land rehabilitation with terrace on 
slope between 10-30%, iii) orchard land rehabilitation with terrace on slope between 30-40%, iv) 
orchard land rehabilitation with terrace on slope<10%, v) wadis land development, vi) rangeland land 
development, vii) crop – livestock conservation agriculture (CA) system; three financial models 
representing potential activities that landless women or young people could undertake through 
inclusive entrepreneurship development support: viii) bee-keeping model, ix) mushroom model, x) 
sheep model; two infrastructure models: xi) road model, xii) market model. All farm and activity 
models generate attractive profitability indicators, as summarized in the table below. In the case of 
land reclamation with terrace on slope between 10-30%, the results are borderline mainly due to the 
high investment cost (NIS 9 200 per dunum). However, when excluding family labour from the final 
calculation, results improve significantly (NPV: NIS 67 500 and IRR 20%). Most importantly, results 
obtained considering the flow of fund proceeding from donors and the farmer indicates that the activity 
is financially viable and further sustainable from farmers’ viewpoint. Finally, the investment is further 
justified when considering that, according to the Ottoman Law referenced above, registered 
productive lands cannot be confiscated from the farmer.

have on the project viability. Similarly, it shows how the economic viability of the project will be 
affected by an increase of up to 50% in project costs; and by a one to three-year delay in project

  Sustainability 
  Sustainability is being built into the design of the land development component in several 
136.
critical ways. By application of demand-driven and cost sharing approach, and by enhancing the 
target group capacity for improving the productivity of existing resources, it is expected that they will 
use the existing natural resources (land and water) more efficiently and profitably. This in turn will 
enable the target group to respond more resiliently to the challenges of climate change as well as 
having a financial incentive and means to finance the routine maintenance cost of the investments. 
The project will ensure environmental sustainability by insisting that all activities and inputs of 
component 1 are screened from an environmental perspective. And finally, the selection criterion on 
feasible and sustainable procedure for operation and maintenance of the proposed investments will 
be endorsed by the responsible institution, i.e. the municipality/village councils for agricultural roads 
and individual farmers for improved lands. The endorsement will be subsequently formalized in 
agreement with participating NGOs/PMU stating the commitment to make yearly provisions for 
maintenance of rehabilitated/constructed assets. The sustainability is also strengthened by carefully 
calibrated user contributions designed to balance sustainability prospects with inclusion. Under the 
previous project (PNRMP) the required contribution by farmers for land development was 25% in cash 
that was too high for them to afford. Based on the lessons learned from the previous project the 
approach has been revised and only 5% of total cost is required now in cash and 20% in kind, while 
keeping the overall total 25% contribution requirements as per the regulations in the PA. As per the 
road investment, it is considered 10% cash contribution by municipalities for investment cost. This 
option has been discussed in all the municipalities visited by the design mission and there was no 
concern about it. Furthermore, all the municipalities suggested to do the designs for road 
improvement at their own expenses. And this proposal was adopted by the design team, i.e. in 
addition to cash contribution for roads investment works the municipalities are obliged to procure the 
engineering designs, clearly also an indication of ownership and willingness to invest in the 
infrastructure.  
Investment, operation and maintenance of the agricultural road network in West Bank is under 
137.
the responsibility of village/municipality councils. The investment and maintenance funds are provided 
from their budget. Funds allocated hereto are generally sufficient to cover the maintenance of 
agricultural roads provided that they are properly built. Furthermore, as the roads that will be included 
in RELAP will mainly serve to ensure the access to developed agricultural lands, farmers will 
consequently have particular economic incentive to keep these roads in proper conditions (at least the 
routine maintenance will be carried out by farmers whereas they are a likely vocal constituency

pressuring the local councils to honour their O&M obligations). Thus, if the adequate quality of works 
is ensured and the particular economic interests of benefitting farmers, the sustainability of the roads 
investments will most likely be ensured. 
  Similarly to component 1, sustainability is part and parcel of the market approach (component 
138.
2) through all market stakeholders' involvement at early stages and thereafter all along the process. 
Village/municipal councils will own the common economic infrastructures. The Project will support the 
establishment of autonomous private management set-up to whom village councils will delegate, 
through a local public private partnership, the sustainable use and management of the marketing and 
collecting centre through the collection of an agreed market fee. In the long run, it is also expected 
that the recognition of Palestinian origin for agricultural products on urban markets will provide 
effective and regular outlets for the products. Through the MRPs, that enhance local social capital, 
financial institutions are made aware of the viable entrepreneurship initiatives and encouraged to 
support investors with financial services with less risks.  
  The exit strategy for both component 1 and 2 rest of the strong economic incentives that will be 
139.
created for the private sector (mostly farmers and agribusinesses) to continue to profit from 
commercially beneficial MRP and resilient farming principles. This will be core ambition, but the public 
sector will also play a crucial role in providing an enabling framework for the farmers and 
agribusinesses in terms of infrastructure, market access, climate information provision and testing of 
new innovative land and farming models.  
  Finally, component 3 sustainability is based on the strong and accelerating demand for 
140.
improved climate information, including forecasting modelling and translation into actionable 
information for farmers. All stakeholders, including MoA, EQA and meteorological services have 
expressed commitment to the O&M of the proposed stations. Sustainability for component 3 is also 
backed up by the fact that i) both MoA and EQA consider RELAP as an important project aiming at 
decreasing the vulnerability of the sector and enhance the resilience of Palestinian target 
communities, and ii) strongly advocated for the inclusion of the third component into the RELAP 
design.

Appendix 1:  Country and rural context background 
The situation in Palestine is universally recognized as one of the most fragile, complex and 
1.
volatile political and institutional contexts globally. Palestine has been, and continues to be, affected 
by extended periods of political, economic and security instability. The confluence of these factors 
pose multiplicity of challenges and requires adaptive and politically smart responses to navigate, not 
least in relation to a sensitive area such as land. This in turn will also require substantial insights into 
the contextual background and history that has shaped the current situation. 
Under the framework of the Oslo Accord in 1993, the Palestine Authority (PA) was designated 
2.
to have exclusive control over both internal security-related and civilian issues in Palestinian urban 
areas (referred to as Area A) and only civilian control over Palestinian rural areas (Area B). The 
remainder of the territories (Area C covering 63%) including Israeli settlements, the Jordan Valley 
region and bypass roads between Palestinian communities, were subject to future negotiations for 
clarifying the process of transferring part or all of these areas to the PA. However, such negotiations 
failed to progress and the Israeli claimed part of Area C has been expanding since the Oslo Accords, 
progressively restricting the ability of Palestinians to effectively access land and also water resources. 
This has serious implication for both the economy and the wider national strategies of the 
3.
nascent Palestinian state as Area C is where the majority of the West Bank’s natural resources lie. 
For example, 82% of the groundwater reserves not accessible to the Palestinian. These water 
restrictions make Palestinian among the most water stressed country in the world, which is 
exacerbated by the increase in temperatures and more erratic rainfalls over the last decades due to 
climate change, adding to the vulnerability of rural communities and the agricultural sector. Moreover, 
much of the fertile land is also located in Area C, where it is being either complete close off to 
Palestinians, or only accessible with considerable difficulty and often at prohibitive cost (e.g. multiple 
security check points not allowing vehicular access or with unpredictable exclusion of access). It is 
estimated that the restrictions in Area C impose a cost on the Palestinian economy in the magnitude 
of USD 2.2 billion yearly or around 20% of GDP.32 The Israeli expansion and construction of new 
settlements has created a segmented geography where Palestinians are impeded from moving freely 
across their own land and applying a coherent management of their wider landscapes. This is 
undermining the territorial integrity and the wider ability to create a contiguous, economically and 
politically sustainable country.  
Macro-economic performance. The economy has also been subject to the above-mentioned 
4.
shocks and volatility, resulting in uneven and depressed growth rates, but with significant variations 
between the West Bank and Gaza, as illustrated in Error! Reference source not found. where 
uccessive conflicts with Gaza have resulted in increased divergence in macro-economic performance. 
However what is also clear is that the volatility is higher in Gaza, but in both cases economic growth 
has tended be around the level of population growth (3%) since 2012 with the 2014 war in Gaza 
obviously inducing a dip in performance there. Thus GDP per capital has plateaued since 2012 (see 
Error! Reference source not found.), with few indications that a revival of substantial growth being 
imminent.

Figure 1: Growth/capita 2005 = 100 
5.
As in previous years, in 2016, GDP growth was driven by an unsustainable expansion in 
domestic demand, in particular private consumption, which accounted for 26 per cent of bank credit to 
the private sector. While the relative importance of private consumption in economic growth increased 
relative to government consumption, investment and exports continued to lag behind. In the 
meantime, the usual ‘income-elevators’ for developing countries (e.g. productivity growth in agriculture 
and labour –intensive industrialisation), are being undermined. The drivers of the de-industrialisation 
and “de-agriculturalisation” of Palestine are well-known: The continuing loss of land and natural 
resources and the annexation of land in the West Bank, as well as fragmentation of the economy into 
disconnected markets and regions, and restrictions on the importation of essential production inputs, 
all escalate production costs, depress investment and inevitably set the economy onto a distorted 
path of high unemployment and widespread poverty. Consequently, the share of value added of 
agriculture contracted by 11 per cent in 2016, resulting in the sector’s share in the overall economy to 
fall from an already low of 3.4% to only 2.9%.33 The share of agriculture in overall credit disbursement 
is now at 2%, half of the share of credit to finance car purchases.34  
6.
A key consequence of these unfortunate events has been that unemployment has remained 
stubbornly high, especially among young people. Overall unemployment reached 27% 2016, up by 
about 2 percentages point compared to 2015. Conditions are especially difficult in Gaza, where 
unemployment exceeds 40 percent and close to two-thirds of young people are without a job. With the 
dearth of job opportunities, too many people are disengaged from the labor market and labor force 
participation stood at just 46% percent in mid- 2016.35  
7.
In the West Bank the situation is only marginally better. Overall unemployment is at 18% here 
whereas youth has a substantial higher risk at 27%.36 Unemployed youth are often considered a lost 
generation, as they do not have the opportunity to build up relevant skills during their first years in the 
workforce. Such disenfranchisement of young generations discourages investment in education, 
lowers the accumulation of human capital and deprives the economy of the new thinking, creativity, 
technological awareness and transformative innovations that are naturally associated with the young.  
For the economy as a whole, extreme youth unemployment has negative ramifications for long-
8.
term productivity, competitiveness, economic growth and fiscal sustainability. The skills atrophy 
caused by youth unemployment is associated with longer spells of job searches in the future, 
underemployment, long-term un-employability, reduced lifetime earnings, poverty, despair and poor 
health, as well as economic, cultural, social and political marginalization. The underutilization of 
human capital pertaining to youth, college graduates and women is another element of the economic 
cost imposed by occupation on the Palestinian people.

The loss of future income due to youth unemployment will aggravate the fiscal problems of the 
9.
PA with regard to both revenue and expenditures as a result of low tax revenues and the increased 
burden of government spending on social transfers and health services. This is also a key driver for 
both the PA and its international development partners (IFAD included) to focus on youth in particular 
when promoting job generation, not least in rural areas. 
Rural development challenges 
In the unique Palestinian context, rural development faces important obstacles and challenges, 
10.
including, among others: i) the volatility and high insecurity, due to restriction of movements and 
regular clashes between Palestinians, Israeli security forces and settlers; ii) agricultural production 
constrained by Israeli water and land-use controls in Area C; iii) impacts of climate change adding to 
the existing water stress and drying and degradation of the land; iv) high food insecurity and the lack 
of income opportunities for the rural population, in a context of a captive economy, where imported 
food can be blocked with virtually no notice and where food prices are high and volatile37; and v) both 
permanent and ad-hoc restrictions on imports and exports of agricultural inputs and outputs, reducing 
predictability and investment horizons and increasing costs. 
  Further hindering rural development is the small size of farms, on average 1 ha (or 10 dunums) 
11.
in the West Bank often spread out on several plots.38 Clearly if the productivity of such plots was high, 
this could partly compensate for the small size. Unfortunately, productivity is relatively low, not least 
for the major tree-crop grown, olive, which is inherently low productive but also due to limited 
precipitation that reduce the choice of rain-fed high-productivity crops (and is a main reason for 
growing olive). Combined with the above-mentioned challenges, agriculture has become an 
increasingly difficult to engage in, not least for the youth. Thus, the rural urban exodus has been 
gaining strength. In 2000 the rural population constituted 28%, a figure that was down to 25% in 2015, 
whereas corresponding figures for share of labour force engaged in agriculture halved from 12% to 
6%.39 The area under permanent crop cultivation has declined from 120 000 ha in 1997 to 70 000 in 
2012.  
  With the increasingly marginalisation of agriculture and deleveraging of investments in the 
12.
sector, it has also become a more women-dominated sector, but at the lowest and most menial level, 
and not at ownership level. The share of women in the agricultural workforce has consequently 
increased from 66% in 2000 to 76% in 2015.40 However, with the existence of traditions and cultures 
37   According to the 2014 socio-economic and food security survey, carried out by the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, 
WFP and UNRWA in the West Bank, food insecurity remained at 17%, unchanged from 2012 levels.

1  I. Prolonged occupation, economic stagnation and de-development  2017 marks the fiftieth anniversary of the Israeli occupation of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem; the longest occupation in recent history. For the Palestinian people, these were five decades of de-development, suppressed human potential and denial of the basic human right to development, with no end in sight. Instead of the hoped-for two-State solution envisaged by the United Nations and the international community, occupation is currently even more entrenched, while its complex socioeconomic toll has worsened over time. Despite a 4.1 per cent growth in gross domestic product (GDP) in 2016, the productive capacity of the Palestinian economy continued to erode, economic performance was far below potential and unemployment persisted at levels rarely seen around the world since the Great Depression. In addition, in 2016, real per capita GDP was roughly at the level in 1999; $1,766 in constant 2004 dollars (figure; table 1).

which tend to favour inheritance of men, women’s access and control of land and natural resources is 
limited. Though legislation provides women with the right to inherit, own and dispose of land 
independently from the men in their family, men hold primary power over the use and ownership of 
land, which continues to reinforce the denial of women’s equal rights to land even when the legal 
frameworks provide for it.41 Thus women are mainly confined to unpaid or low paid menial work in the 
farms (see appendix 2 for further details). Young men are increasingly shunning primary agricultural 
production as it is not seen compatible with the lifestyle ambitions42. 
  Youth have also other challenges in engaging productively and profitably in agriculture and 
13.
broader agribusinesses. Few have access to investment credits, both due to financial institutions’ 
inherent reluctance to invest in agriculture, but also due to young people lack credit history and 
collateral. Moreover, both banks and MFIs view youth as more footloose and less committed to 
agriculture, than more established farmers43. Again, this limits innovation and entrepreneurship in the 
sector at a time when this is critically needed. As a consequence, many young Palestinians who are 
unemployed engage in fresh produce retail trade in villages and cities, carried out on an extremely 
small scale based on small vehicles self-constructed from wood and bicycle tires or selling produce 
laid out in the street, as they have to keep capital investment at a minimum44.  
 Combined, all of these challenges conspire to high level of food insecurity and unemployment 
14.
as well as low wages all over the West Bank, as can be seen from Error! Reference source not

  Government policies and strategies. At the macro level, the PA’s main strategy is 
15.
encapsulated in the National Policy Agenda 2017-2022, which has as the overall vision of a free, 
independent and prosperous state of Palestine. It has three pillars: 1) path to Independence, 2) 
government reform, and 3) sustainable development. Of interest in this context is obviously the pillar 
on sustainable development, where emphasis is on revitalizing agriculture and strengthening the rural 
communities, not least in Area C. Moreover, the rehabilitation of land is an explicit commitment in the 
National Policy Agenda as it is seen a as crucial in protecting to the remaining territorial integrity of 
Palestine. Hence two key policy priorities for the PA are to firstly increase agricultural plant and 
livestock production and develop value chains and secondly to protect and support farmers, 
particularly in areas under threat.  
  The specific strategies for delivering on these policy priorities are detailed in the National 
16.
Agricultural Sector Strategy (NASS), 2017-2022. The NASS has five core strategic objectives: 1) 
farmers’ resilience and land security enhanced; 2) agriculture sustainably managed and better 
adapted to climate change (CC); 3) increased agricultural production, productivity, and 
competitiveness facilitating food security and economic growth; 4) better access to quality agricultural 
services especially for value chains (VCs); and 5) improved institutional and legal frameworks. The 
RELAP intend to support especially the three first strategic objectives of the NASS (farmers’ 
resilience, increased productivity and production and; sustainable and climate smart agriculture). It 
will, however, also integrate farmers into more profitable VCs (often supported by other partners) thus 
also contributing to the 4th strategic objective (better access to quality agricultural services). 
  A key crosscutting theme in the NASS is the focus on improving steadfastness of farmers and 
17.
rural communities, with explicit reference to the land tenure and land security, but also as regards

their ability to improve the livelihoods in rural areas, making it a pro-active and positive decision to 
stay in and invest in rural businesses, agriculture included. Particular emphasis is given to innovative 
youth, women farmers, and producers are engaged in sustainable and feasible agricultural and rural 
activities. Water access is also singled out as a key area and here the NASS has ambitious targets for 
improving availability using a diversity of options, including: water wells, tanks, cisterns, canals and 
treated waste water. Combined with more efficient irrigation techniques, this is intended to catalyse a 
shift towards higher value crops, as well as expanding the area under active cultivation to improve 
steadfastness. Finally the NASS also aimed to rehabilitate or reclaim at least 13.000 dunums (1.300 
ha) of lands and built 350.000 retaining walls, again with the objective of improving resilience to land 
encroachment and increasing incomes. Clearly this is also an area where RELAP will contribute both 
quantitatively as well as through better land development models

Poverty, food security and vulnerability 
Poverty measures. Rural poverty in Palestine is not well researched nor documented45. 
1.
Furthermore, various definitions of poverty, corresponding to various poverty lines, have been used in 
the West Bank and Gaza since 1997. Until 2011, the official poverty line was calculated by the 
Palestinian Central Statistics Bureau (PCSB) based on expenditures data from household expenditure 
and consumption surveys, using a reference family of 2 adults and four children. The official poverty 
line changed frequently over time, from NIS 1 642 per month in 2001 and NIS 1 800 in 200346, to NIS 
2293 in 2011. Derived from a relative concept of poverty, it was being used as an absolute poverty 
line and was not adjusted for spatial price differences. 
In 2011, this methodology was changed to reflect international best practices and standards. 
2.
The new methodology involves an adjustment for spatial price difference across the various 
governorates in the West Bank and in Gaza as well as for inflation, and poverty headcount is 
calculated at individual level rather than at the household level. In order to reflect the results of the 
2007 population census, it also uses a reference family of two adults and three children. The year 
2010 is now considered as a new base year for estimating poverty rates. The data series for the 
period 2004-2009 presented in the next table was adjusted by the PCBS to reflect these 
methodological changes. The latest data on the proportion of population below national poverty line is 
for the year 2011 and a new poverty assessment is planned to take place in 2018.

Since 2011, the official poverty line47 is set by the PCBS at NIS 2,293 per month (or USD 
3.
65048). According to latest PCBS estimates, some 25.8% of the Palestinian population falls below this 
line, with a marked difference between the West Bank and Gaza. Since 2006, the proportion of the 
population in the West Bank below the poverty line has thus steadily decreased (from 24% to 17.8% 
in 2011), while Gaza is yet to recover to its 2004 level. Within the West Bank, and according to the 
data from the 2013 Poverty Atlas in Palestine49, there are however large differences across the 11 
45   The latest comprehensive poverty assessment was conducted in 2011 by the World Bank, but there was no specific focus 
on rural poverty. The Poverty Atlas conducted in 2013 identifies the list of poor localities in West Bank and Gaze, but does not 
analyze the key drivers of poverty. Other, available surveys and studies on vulnerability (UN, 2016), food security (WFP/PBCS 
2014), or resilience (FAO, 2015) provide only indirect measurement of rural poverty, or are largely based on qualitative 
assessments.

According to the latest available data (2011), some 8.8% of the population in the West Bank

was below the “deep poverty line”, which only considers expenditures to fulfil a household’s essential 
needs (food, clothing and housing). Emergency assistance to needy households remains widespread 
in Palestine and is usually successful in lifting many households above the poverty line: in 2003, the 
World Bank had thus estimated that the emergency assistance received had helped to lower the then 
poverty rate from 22% to 16%, a reduction of almost a third50. Nonetheless, the same study had 
shown that 32% of the neediest households had not received emergency assistance, chiefly because 
of their lack of access to information on available emergency assistance programmes.

Human development. According to the latest Human Development Report, Palestine’s Human 
5.
Development Index (HDI) score for 2014 was 0.686. Palestine is within the “medium human 
development” category and ranks 107th out of a total of 187 countries and territories. Compared with 
2005 (0.649), the HDI has increased by 5.7% (or an average annual increase of about 0.7%). In the 
same year, the Gender Development Index (GDI) score was 0.974, which is significantly higher than 
in the overall average for the Arab region, Palestine ranking, overall, 41st out of 187 countries. This 
score, however, does not reflect appropriately the actual low level of empowerment of Palestinian 
women. The difference in human development between women and men is due to the fact that, 
although life expectancy at birth is higher for women, women have fewer numbers of years of 
schooling and fall significantly below men in the income category (with an estimated per capita gross 
national income of USD 1 651 compared to USD 8 580 for men). 
Food security. As per latest available official data51 (2014), some 1.6 million Palestinians (or 
6.
32.2% of the total population) are food insecure. In the West Bank, this percentage has remained 
stable since previous survey period, at 19%. Overall, food insecure households are evenly split 
between the severely food insecure and moderately food insecure (13% each), while the marginally 
food secure and food secure households account for 15% and 58% respectively. In the West Bank, 
food insecurity tends to be higher in rural areas (33% of rural households are food insecure against 
27% of urban households) and among woman-headed households (36% of female-headed 
households are food insecure against 29% for man-headed households, although they tend to receive 
proportionally more food assistance). In terms of occupation, a higher proportion of food insecure 
households is found among households deriving their primary income source from agriculture (35% of

food insecure households) or from private sector employees (34%), whereas this proportion is lowest 
among family business owners (19%), government employees (26%) and for households whose head 
works in Israel (27%). The proportion of food insecure households is also found highest in Area C 
(38%), compared to 30% in Area A and B, while restrictions of movement seems to be correlated with 
food insecurity (72% of food secure households report no limitations of movements, against 60% of 
severely food insecure households). Food insecure households have also more family members than 
food secure families and their head is more likely to be unemployed. 
7.
Overall, some 16.5% of households in the West Bank had received assistance from 
Government, UNWRA or other sources in 2014, against 25% in 2011. In 2014, some 36% of total 
assistance in the West Bank was in the form of cash allowance (36%), followed by food and food 
vouchers (23%), free health services (19%) and assistance for housing (13%). On average, assisted 
households have received an amount equivalent to USD 86 per month, down from USD 128 in 2012.  
8.
Child malnutrition. In 2016, WFP estimated a chronic malnutrition rate of 7.4% among 
Palestinian children aged 6 to 59 months. Since 2004, the prevalence rate of moderately and severely 
underweight children has reduced overall, from 4,9% to 1.4%52. A similar trend is also noted in the 
West Bank, together with a marginal difference between urban (1.3%) and rural areas (1.6%). The 
2011 World Bank poverty assessment showed that emergency assistance has been reasonably 
successful in preventing widespread malnutrition.

Drivers of poverty and vulnerability. According to the latest poverty assessment conducted 
9.
by the World Bank in 2011, there are multiple drivers of poverty and the most important include 
household’s size, education and employment status. Thus, poverty rates are found higher among 
larger households and in households headed by an adult with a low level of education, while 
individuals living in households with one or more unemployed members are more than twice as likely 
to be poor, in comparison with other households. Available data further show that, since 2006, the gap 
between man-headed households and woman-headed households has reduced (18.3% of woman-
headed households were poor in 2011 against 17.4% for man-headed households, from respectively 
31.4% woman-headed households and 23.4% man-headed households in 2006). Similarly, the gap 
between rural and urban households has tended to narrow over the years53.  
  Using a different methodology54, the 2016 UN Common Country Analysis sheds some 
10.
additional light on the profile of vulnerable households in the West Bank. According to this 
assessment, and while the occupation is found to be a cause of vulnerability for all Palestinians, some 
groups appear to be more vulnerable than others. These are: adolescent girls and women exposed to 
gender-based violence, food- insecure households headed by women; out-of-school children in the 
labour force and children subject to violence; the youth; the elderly; communities in Area C; Bedouins 
and herder communities living in Area C; Gaza residents without access to clean water or sanitation;

26.5% of rural households used to be below the poverty line in 2006, against 20.7% of urban households; while this

percentage reached 17.2% and 17.6%, respectively, for rural and urban households in 2011.

  For these marginalized groups, the key structural drivers of vulnerability include place of

residence, exposure to violence (in particular for refugees or the residents of certain localities), 
economic factors (in particular, access to employment opportunities and to productive resources and

  The above table shows that across all livelihoods’ types, the most resilient households tend to 
13.
work more in the private or public sector and dependent less from employment in Israel or the 
settlements. Conversely, the least resilient households tend to derive a larger proportion of their 
income from the agricultural sector or from assistance. Livelihoods based on mixed farming and 
herding tend to be more resilient compared to herding alone or crop farming alone. Across all types of 
livelihoods, the high resilience groups cultivate larger areas of land and own more animals, while the 
least resilient tend to more frequently report difficulties in accessing their land or workplace. Finally, 
according to this assessment, rural households seem to be more resilient than urban and peri-urban 
households (which is in contradiction with findings of the 2014 PCBS socio-economic and food 
security survey57).  
Gender issues 
  Legal and institutional framework. The Basic Law of 2002 (amended in 2003) stipulates that 
14.
all Palestinian citizens are equal before the law regardless of their race, sex, colour, religion, political 
views and disability, and basic human rights and freedom are protected and respected. On the other 
hand, in the West Bank, all matters related to inheritance, marriage, divorce and child custody are 
governed by the Jordanian personal status law of 1976, which is based on Islamic law and still 
contains many provisions that discriminate women. For example, the testimony of a woman is worth 
only half of that of a man in cases related to marriage, divorce and child custody; women, unlike men, 
can request divorce only in special circumstances; and only fathers are considered legal guardians of 
their children who shall remain in their custody in case of a divorce. Also, there is no specific law 
against domestic violence, and a clause in the Jordanian penal code is still in effect in the West Bank 
in virtue of which men are exempted from punishment for killing a female relative if she has brought 
dishonour to the family by a “shameful” behaviour58. 
  Palestinian women nevertheless enjoy equal voting rights and equal rights to stand for election 
15.
according to the law. Following 2006 elections, women occupied 14% of the seats in the Palestinian 
Legislative Council, and, during the 2012 municipal elections, women represented 21.4% of elected 
members in the West Bank, from 18% in 2010. For many observers, however, this level of 
57   The methodology used by FAO for the 2015 Livelihood baseline profiles is not described in the document provided to the 
RELAP design mission. 
58   There is a general lack of reliable data on the issue, but, according to UNICEF 1999 estimates, two-thirds of all murders in 
the Palestinian territories were likely honor killings, while the ministry reported that the rate of such crimes had risen by 
100% in 2013, with an estimated number of 27 cases.

representation is largely due to the quota system introduced in 200559, rather than political 
empowerment60.  
16.
  Palestine is not eligible to ratify any United Nations international conventions and could not, 
therefore, ratify the UN Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women61. 
Israel is in principle responsible for reporting on the situation of women to the UN, but did not do it so 
far62. The Ministry of Women’s Affairs is since 2003 responsible for the promotion and protection of 
women’s rights and Gender Units are established in each line ministry. Developed by the ministry with 
support from UN Women, the Cross-Sectoral National Gender Strategy 2014/16 serves as a practical 
road map for the government to address gender issues on the national agenda. Its five strategic 
objectives are: (i) to increase women’s participation in the labour force: (ii) to reduce all forms of 
violence against women; (iii) to increase women’s participation in decision-making institutions; (iv) to 
ensure that all Palestinian women have access to basic services; (v) and to mainstream and 
universalize gender issues. The “National Strategy to Combat Violence Against Women 2011-2019”, 
on the other hand, specifically tackles gender-based violence and violence against women, while 
“Gender Charter for the Aid Coordination Structure in Palestine” aims to promote gender 
mainstreaming in aid coordination amongst the Palestinian Authority and the donor circle. 
  Women’s status. The Palestinian society is predominantly a patriarchal one, in which women’s 
17.
role is shaped by traditions and norms derived from tribal cultural values. According to such traditions 
and norms, a decent woman should be married, at home taking care of her family and children and 
she should not interact with men who are not her relatives. Since the Oslo Accord, researchers note 
that the modern values that had begun to emerge in the 1980s, including women’s empowerment and 
gender equality, are weakening and that re-emerging conservatism is having a negative impact on 
Palestinian women63. This situation is exacerbated by the movement restrictions. These have thus 
tended to instigate much stricter control by men, and the society, over women in a proclaimed attempt 
to protect them from the dangers in the society64, thereby reducing even further their mobility and 
ability to work. As for violence against women, there are few studies and statistics available, and the 
issue is still regarded by the society more as a private, domestic problem to be dealt with inside the 
family. Nevertheless, a 2011 PBCS study had shown that some 30% of married women in the West 
Bank had experienced at least one form of spousal violence (physical, psychological, sexual or 
economic), while 65% of the victims did not tell anyone about such abuses. 
  Women’s employment. Although Palestinian women tend to be more educated than men65, 
18.
Palestine records one of the lowest female labour force participation in the world66 (18% in 2015, 
against 64% for men67). Besides the restrictions of movement imposed on them, other reasons for the 
low women’s participation in the labour force point again to the prevailing gender norms, including 
men’s preference for their wives not to work outside of the home, the large number of children per 
household due to a high fertility rate68, private sector employers’ preference of hiring men over 
women, and the fact that educated women have predominantly studied “women-appropriate” subjects, 
(such as health, education and humanities) for which few jobs are available outside of the public 
59   Article 4 of the Law on Public Legislative Elections of 2005 guarantees the representation of women in electoral lists, while 
Article 17 of the Palestinian Law on Local Council Elections guarantees that women hold 20% of seats in local bodies.

sector69. Girls’ and women’s participation in technical training is low (some 30% of trainees) and it is 
insignificant for vocational training (2% to 3% according to the Ministry of Women Affairs). Overall, it is 
also estimated that more than 60% of women’s daily time is spent at home caring about their 
households70 and that the percentage of women who are outside of the labour force because they 
need to take care of their children and their households is 66% (compared to 0.9% of men)71. For 
those women able to find an occupation, gender discrimination in the labour market is evidenced by 
the fact that women receive only 57% of the median wage of men, while the percentage of women 
working as unpaid family workers was 23.1% in 2011 compared to 5.5% for men72.  
  Two sectors absorb most of the Palestinian women’s workforce: services, including health and 
19.
education (59.7% in 2011) 73 and agriculture (13.1% of women’s employment in 2015 against 7.8% of 
men’s employment)74. Women’s participation in the private sector economy is limited and most paid 
women are employed in the public sector (the sector absorbs 26% of women’s workforce and 41.2% 
of civil servants were women in 2015). In the West Bank, women account for only 16% of the 
employees of micro, small and medium-enterprises (MSMEs) and 24% of the employees of larger 
enterprises75. Furthermore, only 3.4% of the women’s workforce are entrepreneurs who have started 
their own business and have employees, against 16% for men, while only 13% of women in the 
workforce are self-employed. In many cases, the key reason for a Palestinian woman to start a 
business is out of sheer necessity76, and many of these small businesses tend to be limited to what is 
perceived as being women activities (such as beauty parlours) or socially-accepted, home-based 
activities (such as handicraft or food processing). Beyond the social norms and traditions discussed 
earlier, key reported constraints include the lack of entrepreneurial mind-set among women, the fact 
that few girls and women enrol for vocational training, limited access to business information and 
inadequate sources of financing. On the other hand, a recent study revealed that 65% of Palestinian 
women are willing to launch a business, which indicates a clear discrepancy between potential 
entrepreneurship and the current reality77. 
  Women in agriculture. Women’s employment in the agriculture has been declining steadily in 
20.
the last decade (from 35.1% of the women’s workforce in 2066 to 13.1% in 2015), reflecting only 
partly the overall decline in the number of total agricultural workers78. Another salient feature of the 
Palestinian agricultural sector is that most women working in the sector are primarily involved in 
subsistence farming, or they work without pay in their family’s or husband’s land79. It is thus estimated 
that only 1.8% of women active in the agricultural work earn a wage80, while it is assumed that there 
are only very few women who are owner-operators of their farm. Further, of the 230 agricultural 
cooperatives that were active in the West Bank as of 2015, 39% are comprised of men members only, 
while women constitute, overall, only 7% of cooperative members. In mixed cooperatives, women 
tend to have little decision-making power, while women-only cooperatives (which represent only 5% of 
all cooperatives) are smaller in size and mainly active in traditional “woman” areas of work (home 
gardening, chicken and goat raising and small-scale processing), which reinforces the traditional 
gender-segregation of roles. To a certain extent, the focus of donors’ assistance targeted at 
Palestinian women on these areas of work has the same consequences, while largely failing to 
empower them economically. More research and studies are required to further explore Palestinian 
women’s involvement in, and contribution to, the agricultural sector. 
69   Working Palestinian women then dominate a few occupations, including office clerks and teaching professionals.

  The Agriculture Sector Strategy 2017-2022 recognises women’s labour contribution to the 
21.
sector, and it vision statement includes a reference to the fact that “that development is a right of all 
men and women, boys and girls, without any discrimination or marginalization based on sex, region or 
age”. One of the “guiding pivot” used in defining the sector’s strategy was also the need to foster the 
“active participation and involvement of female and male farmers and producers in the planning, 
evaluation and implementation processes of any agricultural intervention” Of the five strategic 
objectives only the fourth includes specific guidance for women and youth namely: (i) Finding 
mechanisms to ensure access of small farmers, women and youth to funding with the aim of 
enhancing their current farmers and creating entrepreneurial agricultural businesses, (ii) Empowering 
youth, women, farmers and entrepreneurs to access quality services in the field of agricultural 
business development and intensification of efforts to support entrepreneurship in the agricultural 
sector; (iii) Highlight the role of women in agricultural work and their contribution to national output and 
enable them to strengthen their resources resulting from agricultural work and the Gross National 
Product (GNP), while empowering them to enhance their agricultural resources and income.81 
  Assets’ ownership. Due to their low participation in the formal labour market, as well as issues 
22.
related to inheritance, it is hard for Palestinian women to build their own assets’ base. Thus, if the 
Jordanian inheritance law grants women the right to inherit from their parents, in practice, they tend to 
inherit smaller shares compared to male heirs. Furthermore, for fear of deceiving their family and 
loosing fraternal protection, or because they have been threatened or coerced by their brothers, only 
few women are claiming their rights of inheritance and most chose to abandon their shares to their 
brothers82. This may be done legally using Takharuj, an irreversible compromise among inheritors 
allowing some of them to abandon their shares of inheritance against an agreed sum of money. Data 
from the Ramallah, Hebron and Nablus courts show that, in 2013, applications for certificates of 
succession by men accounted for 77% to 90% of total applications. As for the few women willing to 
claim their shares, they face lengthy, complicated legal procedures and expensive court fees (in 15% 
of the cases, claims take more than ten years, while close to 50% of the claims take five years to be 
settled in a court). As a result, it is currently estimated that only 7.6% of agricultural holdings in the 
West Bank are owned by women83.  
  A 2013 study by the Institute of Women’s Studies at Birzeit University further reveals that 
23.
overall, only 1% of Palestinian women own a car, 8% own a house or a share in a house, and 12% 
have a bank account. For economically active women, the situation is slightly better, and 15% of them 
own a car, 29% own land or a share in land, and 11% a house or a share in a house. By and large, 
the most widespread women’s assets in Palestine remain jewellery from their dowries (52% of women 
own some jewellery). As a direct consequence of their lack of assets, Palestinian women do not 
possess the collateral required to borrow money from a bank and start a business. Also, even in the 
case of working women receiving a salary, several studies have shown that, according to prevailing 
social norms, it is men’s role to control the money in the household84. 
  Civil society organizations and donors’ assistance. According to a World Bank study, the 
24.
West Bank was home in 2006 to some 1,750 NGOs (but only half of which were found actually 
functional) which provided a wide range of services and played an important role in agriculture, 
vocational training and preschool education. The number of NGOs and other civil society 
organizations concerned with women empowerment is not known, but most researchers tend to 
highlight the important role that women’s rights’ groups have played in recent years in advocating for 
quotas to increase women’s representation in decision-making bodies and in the electoral process. 
The Women’s Affairs Technical Committee, founded in 1991, is an umbrella organization for seven 
women’s organizations which work “to eliminate discrimination against women and to empower 
women to assume decision-making positions at all levels of society with a focus on marginalized,

rural-dwelling, and refugee women”. The Rural Women’s Development Society is one of the leading 
women’s organization working to empower rural women economically, politically and socially, with a 
strong and respected grassroots presence in rural communities and a network of 64 clubs with over 
3,000 members.  
  The 2016 JICA Country Gender Profile: Palestinian Territories report identifies a number of 
25.
donors involved in the financing of projects and programmes with a strong focus on gender issues or 
women empowerment. These include: JICA, UN Women, UNRWRA and UNDP. In particular, the 
UNDP/UN Women-funded Sabaya Programme aims to support Palestinian women in marginalized 
rural communities and has established 50 women community centres. Since 2012, UN Women has 
also established a civil society advisory group, composed of representatives from gender equality 
networks, women’s organizations, academia and NGOs, recognizing the need for a forum to 
exchange views, ideas and perspectives on gender issues and women empowerment. 
  Youth. Palestinian population is a relatively young one, with an estimated 39% of the 
26.
population below the age of 15, and almost 30% being aged 15-29 years. Although the women’s 
fertility rate – one of the highest in the world – tends to decline, UNFPA has recently estimated that 
the population of youth in Palestine will double by 205085.  
  As in other parts of the region, Palestinian youth face significantly higher rates of 
27.
unemployment than older workers. Hence, in the West Bank, respectively 25.6% and 16.2% of men 
aged 15-24 years are unemployed, against 9% of men aged 35-54 years. With an unemployment rate 
four times higher than other women, and nearly double that of men in the same age group, young 
women are at an even greater disadvantage in the labour market.

  According to a recent study86, several factors may explain the difficulties faced by the 
28.
Palestinian youth in accessing the labour market, one of them being that the educational system pays 
insufficient attention of the needs of the labour market. At the same time, enrolment in vocational 
training is extremely low (only 5% of the students in Ramallah were involved in vocational training in 
2008), largely because of the prevailing, negative societal attitude towards this type of education. 
Also, while enrolment rates in secondary and tertiary education are high for both girls and boys,

dropout rates are also high87 (35% for men and 29% for women in the age category 15-29), which 
means that a significant percentage of students leave high school or the university without a diploma.  
  Almost all Palestinian are affected by the occupation and restriction movements, but the youth 
29.
in general, and the rural youth in particular, pay a disproportional price. Thus, since the second 
intifada, youth mobility is being increasingly restricted by parents fearful for their children’s safety (in 
particular boys, who seem to be a specific target at checkpoints). Young men are also much less likely 
than older, married men to obtain a working permit to Israel, which limits their ability to seek 
employment there. Also, the poor, unemployed youth are less able than others to afford the 
transportation costs necessary to travel to the nearest city or youth centre in search for leisure 
activities, as a result of which, many are struggling to even fill their free time88. There are also 
accounts of young men with no jobs and no prospects for the future who have joined the armed wings 
of Palestinian factions, although they had no history of political activism89. On the positive side, and in 
parallel, there seems to be an increasing number of Palestinian youth who chose to become engaged 
in civil or community development work as an alternative to joining militant groups or factions90.  
30.
  As far as the institutional framework is concerned, the Higher Council for Youth and Sport is 
responsible, among others, for drafting youth-related policy and legislation and for facilitating young 
people participation in policy-making and decision-making; it is also responsible for: (i) Assisting in the 
development of the sport and youth legislative agenda, (ii) Promoting a legal environment for 
organizing youth work and sports; (ii) Partnering with international organizations to support youth 
work, volunteering and development; (iii) Establishing minimum standards for youth and adolescents 
centers. The Youth cross-cutting strategy (2011-2013) is the most recent official document, the vision 
of which was for “Palestine’s youth to become empowered and participative, with diversified and 
equitable opportunities for a balanced growth within the framework of a democratic, pluralistic 
society”.  
  As of 2006, the Higher Council for Youth and Sports had licensed some 500 youth associations, 
31.
and there were around 250 other types of organizations that offered youth programmes in West Bank 
and Gaza. According to a 2008 survey, most of these associations focus on sports and arts, followed 
by social services and capacity building91.They however tend to be concentrated in major population 
centres, and the outreach in isolated villages and rural areas is very limited or inexistent. 
Target Groups and direct beneficiaries 
  Rationale. Experience of the recently completed IFAD-funded PNRMP has shown that it is 
32.
difficult to involve households below the poverty line in land development work, partly because the 
poorest may not own enough land, or because they would not be in a position to contribute financially 
to the development costs. It is thus recognized that component 1.2 will not necessary benefit the 
poorest households; rather, the project will target households who are at risk of falling below the 
poverty line in case of economic shocks, such as the loss of the primary income source or the sudden 
increase in food prices. In other words, and in a volatile economic environment and labour market 
marked by the frequent occurrence of chocks, the project intends to make component 1.2 
beneficiaries more resilient by diversifying their income base (in case of smallholders not previously 
involved in agriculture), or increasing the incomes they derived from agriculture (for the others). In 
order to prevent leakages of project resources and benefits, specific income-based and assets-based 
eligibility criteria will be applied (see Targeting strategy and selection criteria) for the selection of 
component 1.2 (land development) beneficiaries. An exception concerns the land development work 
on communal grazing land, as it will benefit all herders using this land, irrespective of their income or 
assets’ base.  
87   The key reported reasons are the lack of money or the need to support their family for males, and marriage for females. 
88   As reported by the Sharek Youth Forum 2009 study, a 2005 study had found that 77% of Palestinian youth reported 
spending their leisure time at home, not having any other alternatives for entertainment.

  Recognizing that rural women and the rural youth are among the poorest and most vulnerable 
33.
groups, women and the youth will be the exclusive groups targeted under Component 2.2. Among 
these two groups, the project will seek to select the poorest, such as the landless/unemployed youth 
or landless/unemployed female heads of households, using a set of eligibility criteria. 
  Target groups. With this rationale in mind, the project is designed to benefit the following 
34.
groups which will be specifically targeted: 
Small-holders and small-scale farmers: Typically, Area C small farmers and smallholders 
a) 
have limited access to inputs, including cultivable land and water for irrigation, and to markets. 
Planning and zoning restrictions make it difficult for residents to invest in critical infrastructure, such as 
irrigation systems, while only 15% of ground water resources are available for Palestinian use. The 
current land tenure system, where unutilized Palestinian land may be granted to settlers makes land 
tenure highly insecure, in a context where few small-scale farmers have formal property rights over 
their land92. Area C residents living near settlements are also more prone to settlers’ violence, 
particularly during olive harvest season, resulting in lower productivity. In Area B, smallholders face 
similar problems in terms of access to cultivable land and irrigation water, except that land tenure 
security is less of an issue. 
A salient feature of the Palestinian economy is the fact that agriculture is the main income-
generatingactivity for only 17% of the 90,908 agricultural holdings’ owners found in the West Bank93 
and it is assumed that only large land owners can be profitably engaged in full-time farming. The 
average land holding size in the West Bank is 12.2 dunums and, overall, holdings of less than 10 
dunums amount to 73.5% of total agriculture holdings (while large holdings exceeding 80 dunums 
only account for only 1.8% of total agricultural holdings). The majority of smallholders, therefore, do 
not practice full-time farming but have other main sources of finance from remittances or income from 
private or public employment. For the majority, agricultural production is practiced in order to fulfil 
households’ needs for olive oil, fruits and other agricultural produce, while surplus is being sold to 
supplement main income.  
Under component 1.2, private land rehabilitation or reclamation activities will be targeted at 
smallholders only, who will be selected according to transparent eligibility criteria (see Targeting 
strategy). As women are estimated to account for 7% of land owners in Palestine, and as the project 
intends to support women in obtaining a legal title to their land, it is expected that not less than 10% of 
women owners will benefit from land development work. All component 1.2 beneficiaries are expected 
to benefit from component 2.1 interventions, while most of them will also derive additional benefits 
from road improvement or construction activities under component 1.3.  
(b)  Poor, landless or unemployed youth and women: Due to prevailing social norms that require 
women to stay at home and take care of their family, and although they tend to be more educated 
than men, Palestinian women’s participation in the labour force is one of the lowest in the world. The 
large majority of women working in the agriculture sector are unpaid family workers, while only a 
minority of Palestinian women are entrepreneurs or self-employed. Key obstacles to women’s 
participation in the labour market, beyond the prevailing social norms, are the lack of entrepreneurial 
mindset among them, the lack of technical and business skills and the lack of access to financial 
capital, the latter being due to their inability to borrow money from a bank due to their lack of assets 
and collateral. As for female-headed households, they tend to be poorer, and more food insecure, 
than male-headed households, although they tend to benefit more from Government and UNWRA 
food assistance schemes.  
The youth constitute another vulnerable group, facing economic and social hardship due to the 
movement restrictions as well as unemployment. The lack of employment opportunities and of 
appropriate leisure activities negatively influence their psychological well-being and places them at 
92   Most land registrations recorded by the Palestinian Land Administration Agency do not reflect the current ownership status; 
in many cases, the registered owner is deceased and the family has failed to register subsequent transactions, particularly 
in the form of inheritances.

risk of negative influences. For the purpose of the RELAP, and in line with Article 1, Article 28 and 
Article 32 of the UN Convention of the Rights of the Child, “youth” will refer to “persons aged 18-30” at 
the time of selection of project beneficiaries94. 
Both groups will be the exclusive beneficiaries of the grant schemes and capacity development 
support under Component 2.2. and it is tentatively proposed that both groups shall equitably benefit 
from these interventions.  
(c) Livestock herders: The land development works on communal grazing land will benefit many 
livestock owners in the concerned villages who practice semi-intensive or extensive livestock 
production. Livestock production plays an important role in Palestine, providing a source of income 
and of food for an estimated 32,000 households. Cattle size is usually relatively small95, and intensive 
production mainly concern cow breeders, while semi-intensive or extensive breeding systems are 
practiced by sheep and goat breeders. While some 2 million dunums of rangeland are found in the 
West Bank, closures have led to only 31% of rangeland being accessible to the population. As a 
result, available range land, usually located on communal land, tends to be overgrazed and degraded. 
Palestinian herders and Bedouins in remote communities are also faced with the problem of access to 
water, and they rely on water sold from tankers at high costs for their animals. The products of non-
Bedouin herders are also not competitive in local and international markets because of high 
production costs and low productivity resulting from degraded grazing land, shortage of water and 
lack of access to quality inputs. Two-thirds of the Bedouin and herder communities living in the central 
West Bank have also reported facing violence over the past three years96. 
Livestock owners of goats and sheep practising semi-intensive or extensive production will be 
the direct beneficiaries of the grazing land rehabilitation works under Component 1.2, irrespective of 
their income levels or cattle size. 
  Other direct beneficiaries. In addition to the main beneficiary households just described (who 
35.
will be specifically targeted by the project and who are expected to derive significant benefits from 
project support and interventions), some project activities will directly benefit additional households. 
Thus, component 1.3 activities will also benefit the farmers and land owners whose land is located 
along the newly constructed or rehabilitated roads, and who will benefit from improved access to their 
land and to markets. Under component 2.1. the multi-stakeholders’ platforms will benefit all interested 
local producers, local traders, brokers, as well as members of women associations or other local 
producers’ groups, who will enjoy improved marketing opportunities (for producers) or reduced 
transaction costs (for traders and brokers). As for the activities supported under component 1.1 and 
component 3, they have the potential to benefit the entire farming community in the West Bank, while 
component 3 will also target national and local level government staff providing climate change 
adaptation related services to smallholder farmers. 
  Outreach. It is estimated that the project will directly benefit to a total of 30,000 rural 
36.
households (representing some 150,000 persons97), with a range of various goods and services. 
  Not all these households will derive the same types of benefits from project participation. It is 
37.
thus expected that: (a) some 3,550 households will derive significant economic benefits from land 
rehabilitation and income-generation support under Component 1.2, 1.3 and 2.2; (b) some 5,850 
households will solely benefit from an improved access to their lands and to markets under 
Component 1.3 and 2.1; (c) while some 20,600 households will solely benefit from training on climate 
resilient agriculture under Component 3. 
94   In the Youth Cross-cutting Strategy of the Palestinian National Development Plan (2011-13), youth was defined as “persons 
in the 13-29 age category”. The same document however notes that persons between 13 and 17 years of age are subject 
to definitions prescribed by International Convention of the Right of the Child and should be considered “adolescents”, and 
therefore placed under the responsibility of the Adolescent Directorate of the Higher Council for Youth and Sports. 
95   According to the 2013 PBCS Livestock survey, 61% of livestock holdings that have cows do not exceed three heads, 65% 
of livestock holdings with sheep do not exceed 19 heads, and 66% of holdings with goats do not exceed 19 heads.

selection of project villages, and ii) beneficiaries’ selection. The key proposed criteria for the 
identification and selection of project villages and beneficiaries reflect the intention of ensuring that the 
project will be implemented in localities with high incidence of poverty, and, within these localities, that 
project interventions benefit smallholders, including woman smallholders under component 1, as well 
as vulnerable groups (unemployed/landless women and the youth) under component 2. The detailed 
targeting criteria and mechanism shall be described in the project implementation manual. 
  Throughout project implementation, a gender mainstreaming strategy will also serve as a 
39.
practical guide to ensure that the specific constraints and needs of poor women and the youth are 
duly considered, as a way to promote their participation in project activities and to maximize the 
benefits they will derive from this participation. 
Selection of project villages 
  Under Component 1, the following eligibility criteria will be applied for the initial identification of 
40.
potential project villages: i) villages located in Area B and C of the project target area; ii) villages 
located in localities where 27.73% or more of the population is below the poverty line, as identified in 
the 2009 PBCS Poverty Atlas and its future updates98; iii) villages with the potential to develop a 
minimum of 200 dunums; and iv) villages located in areas with a minimal annual rainfall of 300 mm. 
  Once the initial list of eligible villages will be available, priority will be given, through a scoring 
41.
system, to the following villages: i) villages located in Area C with an estimated greater risk of land 
loss, while avoiding sensitive areas (near the settlements, near the settlement roads and near the 
separation wall); and ii) villages in which the plots to be developed potentially developed are 
contiguous, in order to allow for a more landscape-based approach. 
  Under Component 2, and to maximize synergies and not to spread RELAP resources too thinly, 
42.
activities will be implemented in the same, or neighbouring, villages selected under component 1. 
98   The Poverty Atlas is supposed to be updated in 2018 by the PCBS.

available information on poverty, rainfalls and potential for land development. The PMU will then 
contact the village/municipal councils of all eligible localities in order to gather the additional 
information required for final selection. 
Selection of project beneficiaries 
  Under component 1.2 and component 2.2, the selection of beneficiaries will be done according 
44.
to a number of pre-defined criteria and following a transparent, participatory selection process. The 
following criteria, to be fine-tuned in the PIM if need be, will thus be applied. 
  Under component 1.2, the following eligibility criteria will be applied for the initial identification of 
45.
potential beneficiaries of private land rehabilitation/reclamation works: 
i) 
ii) 
iii) 
iv) 
v) 
vi) 
vii) 
Households with a maximum monthly income equivalent to the national poverty line plus 
30/50%, with the rationale that this will prevent elite capture of project benefits. 
Households owning not more than 10 dunums (1 ha) in rain-fed areas and not more than 5 
dunums (0.5 ha) in irrigated areas99.  
Households whose land slope is not exceeding 40% (or with less than 90% of slope below 
30%), and with acceptable levels of top soil depth. 
Households whose land is not adjacent to “hot spot” areas (e.g. a settlement, a military camp or 
the separation wall). 
Households who have not benefited from government or donor subsidies for land development 
activities in the past 10 years. 
Households genuinely interested to develop their land and make it productive, and with the 
time, and physical capacity, to do so. 
(In Area C only): Households with a formal property title over their land or equivalent supported 
by Ministry of Local Government (or who are being supported by the project to obtain a formal 
property title over in the case of women). 
  Once the initial list of eligible beneficiary households will be available, priority will be given, 
46.
through a scoring system, to the following households: 
i) 
Households with the larger number of children or dependents; 
ii)  Women-headed households, or households for which the land to be developed belongs to a 
woman (formally or informally100). 
Households whose head is below 50 years of age. 
Households whose head is employed as daily wage earner or other precarious, low paid jobs. 
iii) 
iv) 
  Under Component 2.2, the following individuals will be eligible of the investment grants’

scheme:  
i) 
Women whose household is below the poverty line or depends from food assistance 
ii)  Women or youth micro-entrepreneurs, and their existing associations  
iii) 
iv) 
v) 
Landless, unemployed women heads of households  
Landless, unemployed youth (aged 18-30 years) 
The ability of applicant to contribute a minimum of 15% in cash of grant amount will be a 
mandatory eligibility criteria. 
48.
Investment grants may be extended to individuals or a group of maximum three eligible 
individuals who have chosen to join forces to set-up or expand an enterprise/cooperative, and both 
new or current small-scale businesses may be eligible. Final selection of eligible grants’ beneficiaries 
99   Although official statistics on average land holdings’ size are not available, the 1994 study Dry land farming in Palestine, by 
the Applied Research Institute estimated that 50% of holdings in the West Bank are estimated to be less than 10 dunums.

campaigns in order to inform the residents of selected localities about proposed project interventions 
and proposed application processes, ensuring the participation of producers’ organizations, youth and 
women associations. Villagers’ applications will be collected by the municipal/village councils and 
forwarded to the PMU, who will be in charge of reviewing the eligibility of applicants and of screening 
and ranking them in view of the selection of beneficiaries. The detailed criteria and ranking 
methodologies to be used under both component 1 and 2 will be detailed in the project 
implementation manual. 
Gender mainstreaming 
  Recognizing that there is limited scope for reaching out to women and youth through land 
50.
development activities, RELAP design includes a dedicated subcomponent (2.2) for these two specific 
target groups, while component 1 design has provision for supporting women in obtaining a land title. 
  To ensure that vulnerable women and youth are effectively reached and that their participation 
51.
in project activities is fully beneficial, the PMU gender specialist shall prepare, no later than three 
months after project start a gender mainstreaming strategy. This document shall be a practical 
implementation guide aiming at ensuring that the specific constraints and needs of women and the 
youth will be duly considered at all stages of the project implementation process. For example, it will 
be important for the PMU to ensure that the information and awareness campaigns undertaken by the 
PMU and NGO implementers have the wider audience possible, and the PMU Gender Specialist shall 
play an active role during these campaigns. Women and the youth interested to benefit from the 
grants’ scheme shall also benefit from specific support for the preparation of their application forms. 
During the first two years of implementation, the M&E officer and gender specialist shall also focus on 
ensuring that some of the detailed implementation approaches or modalities do not represent an 
obstacle for the participation of women and the youth in project activities; and if so, corrective actions 
shall be taken. For example, and in order to overcome the risk that husbands may not allow their 
wives to travel long distances, it may be important to ensure that BDS and other capacity building 
support are delivered at the village level. Mobility constraints by women and the youth shall also be 
duly taken by the PMU and BDS service providers while designing the BDS module, for example by 
ensuring that the training event location and timing are acceptable in view of women other duties, by 
organizing transportation to training location if outside of the village, or organizing in-house visits if 
required. 
The gender mainstreaming strategy shall also define the specific tools and mechanisms through 
which the empowerment of women and the youth will be measured. For example, the gender 
specialist, with support from the M&E specialist, shall undertake specific qualitative surveys among 
women and young beneficiaries in order to understand project impact on their level of economic and 
social empowerment, or to document any positive intra-household changes in power relations or 
gender roles. To do so, a baseline study (qualitative) will be conducted upon women beneficiaries’ 
selection. Also, the gender mainstreaming strategy will devise specific mechanisms to help ensure 
that project support to women is not being “captured” by their husbands, in particular under the grants 
scheme, for example by making sure, through regular field visits conducted jointly with the M&E 
officer, that the grant amount was used for the intended purpose by the intended beneficiary; or by 
requesting women beneficiaries to open a bank account at their exclusive name in order to deposit 
profit from sales. It will also be important the M&E specialist and gender specialist monitor the extent 
to which the participation of Women Associations and youth groups in MRPs’ Executive Committees 
is active and that their views and specific needs and constraints are duly taken into account (this 
could be done during field supervision mission or by attending Executive Committees’ meetings as 
observers.

Main lessons learnt 
Land development 
Land development remains a key priority. Many donor agencies have been involved in land 
3.
development activities in the West Bank. While some of them are now shifting their support to 
marketing oriented projects and programmes, the (new) national agricultural sector strategy 2017-
2022 highlights that land development needs are still significant and delivery needs acceleration, 
particularly in Area C. Lessons from all land development projects also suggest that land development 
activities should be carried out in a more adaptive, more inclusive and more sustainable way. 
Testing and applying diversified land development models is needed. Earlier land development 
4.
models have proven effective in terms of putting more land into production and increasing beneficiary 
household production and income. Still, more needs to be done to develop alternative models and 
improved technologies which are i) less costly for the beneficiaries, ii) less invasive in the landscape, 
and iii) more adapted to climate change. Experience has also demonstrated that small-scale farmers 
are willing to adopt improved production technologies, but they need to see results first. To help small-
scale farmers taking risks and investing in land development in a different manner, demonstrating and 
testing replicable mechanisms for climate change adaptation will be essential. 
Cost sharing and market terms should be preliminary requirements to land development works. 
5.
Firstly, 100% subsidies contribute to increasing Palestinian farmers’ reliance on assistance and 
discourage many of them to invest in improving their agricultural holdings in hope of getting external 
assistance to do so. Cost sharing in investment – as it was already the case under the PNRMP – is 
key to ownership and sustainability. Secondly, all supported investments should be thought along with 
an analysis of the local market demands, as to ensure that land development activities do not only 
respond to the need of protecting the land, but also to local market terms. 
  Water accessibility and adequacy is key to sustainable economic outcomes. The need to 
6.
further focus on water harvesting and management was constantly raised by the MoA and by farmers 
met during the RELAP detailed design mission. The experience of RDP I, RDP II and PNRMP has 
informed that farmers whose land had a better access to water had achieved better economic returns 
from their lands and were more likely to maintain their agricultural lands than others. The World 
Bank's economic assessment of the effects of the occupation on the agricultural sector also clearly 
identifies access to water as a key constraint (World Bank, 2008). Improving access to water for 
irrigation is thus a critical success element in any land development intervention. 
The villages/municipalities as entry point and community-based landscape approaches to 
7.
maximize project impact. PNRMP provided support for land development activities to relatively 
scattered individual farmers. To maximize project impact and reduce intervention costs, it is essential 
to maximize land development activities, as much as possible, at village or municipality levels. 
8.
In addition, the PNRMP PCR and the PPE found that adopting a community-based landscape 
approach would help enhance the sustainability and effectiveness of the land and water development 
interventions. This could also help reduce unit costs (by allowing intensive works to be focused on 
consolidated plots). Involvement of the local village councils/ municipalities will help mobilize 
community-wide resource management approaches/ plans. This has been reflected in the village 
selection criteria being developed for RELAP (with villages that offer larger including contiguous land 
plots to be rehabilitated being offered priority). Such a community-based landscape approach will 
enable the project to promote integrated activities: inter-cropping, community based water harvesting 
and other agro-ecosystem management.  
Other important lessons include the need to focus on wider consideration of rain water 
9.
harvesting facilitate for supplementary irrigation. Related is the need to maximize the impact of land 
development activities, by closely synchronising with other programme interventions to achieve the 
desired complimentarily wherever relevant and demanded. It is also essential to fully define 
maintenance arrangements of build facilities and also put emphasis on environmental assessment 
and operation of constructed/rehabilitated assets.

10.
  Thus, the main design considerations for land development activities are consequently: 
 
 
 
 
The need to develop and demonstrate replicable mechanisms for climate change adaptation, 
land development and environmental related investment to support commercial, market-
oriented businesses in the project area; 
Specification of clearly defined, transparent and consistently applied investment selection 
criteria including technical feasibility and climate change vulnerability; 
When beneficiaries articulate their needs, sustainability and relevance is improved. Hence 
support should be provided on the basis of demand-driven investment opportunities available to 
individual farmers, village/municipal councils; 
Acceptance of the principle of cost sharing in investment (by government, municipal/village 
councils and farmers) and the adoption of climate change adaptation and market terms for all 
investments under consideration. 
Inclusive targeting (including gender mainstreaming and youth inclusion) 
  Targeting poorer farmers will require a reduction in the cash contribution required from farmers. 
11.
Land development activities, to which small-scale farmers have to contribute substantially (both in 
cash and in kind), may lead to the exclusion of the poorest ones. One of the key lesson learnt from 
PNRMP is that a cash contribution of 25% of the land development total cost, as previously applied, 
represents an investment which is too costly for the small-scale farmers. It is essential to reduce the 
cash contribution, while balancing with a higher in kind-contribution to labour intensive works. This will 
also ensure that the cost-sharing-for-sustainability principles outlined above can be maintained. 
  Targeting the poorer segments of the rural population requires supporting the non-farm and off-
12.
farm sectors. Experience has demonstrated that the inclusion/equitable access of small-scale asset 
rural stakeholders in projects’ supported activities is a challenge. This is particularly true in the context 
of Palestine, where the poorest and most vulnerable rural smallholders are generally not landowners 
(particularly women and the youth). Their inclusion into development projects requires i) to promote 
the development of economic opportunities either in the off-farm sector such as apiculture, dairy 
processing and light consumer manufactures; ii) to develop incentives and mechanisms preventing as 
much as possible from leakages and directly targeting the most vulnerable through clear and 
verifiable selection criteria (quotas, age limit, etc.).The economic opportunities for the poorer sections 
will be managed through local councils/ municipalities, which are key stakeholders in the MRPs and 
the revitalization of the collection centres being targeted under component 2. Therefore, the new 
focus on community-based targeting encompasses not just the physical landscape but the economic 
and social landscape of the rural communities.  
  Gender participation is not enough to ensure women’s empowerment. Specific activities for 
13.
women’s empowerment (and not just measures to enhance participation) are needed to effectively 
engage with rural women and the youth. The experience from the PNRMP and from the JICA financed 
Project on Improved Extension for Value Added Agriculture (2011/15) also demonstrated that it is 
necessary to make the project teams understand why gender mainstreaming is important in 
agricultural projects. PMUs shall comprise of a knowledgeable and skilful staff as “gender-in-charge” 
and provisions for capacity development and trainings for the PMUs shall be budgeted. 
  Beyond supporting specific off-farm economic opportunities for the women and the youth, 
14.
support can be provided to enhance their access to land. Legislation provides women the right to 
inherit, own and dispose of property independently of men in their family. However, women are often 
obstructed from this right because of legal, cultural and social barriers. In the Palestinian patriarchal 
society, mainly adult men apply for and pursue certificates of succession at relevant courts and official 
departments. Lengthy, complicated legal procedures and court high fees, which women and the youth 
cannot afford, as well as lack of information, pose further restrictions. Tailored support can be 
provided to help men, women and the youth to obtain information on certificate of succession and/or 
how to claim their inheritance rights. This support could comprise of awareness raising campaigns, 
legal advices and services for those expressing an interest in claiming their rights, and financial and 
63

technical support to prepare the supporting documentation required for land registration and/or 
succession.  
  Effective inclusion of the youth. Whether in developing countries or in MICs, young people’s 
15.
access to land is influenced by the perception that young people have not reached “maturity” yet and 
by the shortage of land, the latter being further exacerbated in Palestine. Increasingly farming is not 
perceived as an attractive profession by the young, as it involves hard labour and often unstable and 
low incomes. The youth in Palestine face several constraints with regard to employment and building 
sustainable livelihoods including lack of access to land/ capital, lack of collateral required to access 
finance. These will be addressed through RELAP. Youth will be supported through targeted economic 
incentives (benefiting from investment grants and capacity building from BDS) to develop or expand 
off-farm economic activities. While there are youth committees established in the north, south and 
central regions of the West Bank, the design mission found that these were not functional. Therefore, 
the entry point for the youth-focused activities would be the village councils/ municipalities (as 
stakeholders in the MRPs).  
  The strategies related to inclusive targeting (including the specifically customised activities for 
16.
women and youth) respond to the PPE recommendation on developing differential targeting 
strategies. The use of village institutions for facilitating enterprise development and access to markets 
is also aligned to the PPE recommendation on employing community institutions. 
Market access 
In the West Bank, the barriers to entry a value chain serving export markets are often too high 
17.
for poorer farmers, and in a context where imported food can be blocked with virtually no notice – and 
where IFAD previous engagement (PNRMP PCR, 2016) indicated that smallholders sell only about 
25% of their products in formal markets – it is key to better understand local market requirements that 
are most relevant to small scale farmers and to use this understanding to better guide producers in 
making decisions that will optimise the use of available limited resources. To better serve local 
markets, it is important to pool agricultural production at local level, and provide farmers with support 
and advices to base agricultural production decisions on local market realities and demand.  
18.
Local women groups (evidenced from visited in Hebron, Bethlem, Nablus, Tulkarem 
governorates) have regularly been supported with the promotion of income generating activities - 
processed agricultural products and foods, processed milk, beekeeping, greenhouses, hydroponics 
etc. Although they are quite successful in terms of production capacities, access to reliable markets 
remain their bigger challenge. The MRP approach, the investment grants being delivered by RELAP 
build on lessons learned from other donor interventions including the DFID financed Palestinian 
Market Development Project (PMDP). The focus on collection centres and support to processing101 
have been developed based on findings that most of the smallholders supported by IFAD and other 
donors sell their products directly, and usually unprocessed, on the local market. 
Investment grants 
  The PMDP is a 5-year (2013-2018) EU-DFID supported program that is implemented through a 
19.
investment grant window as part of the tools to improve the private sector capacities in three main 
sectors: agriculture, ICT and tourism. PMDP based its involvement on a business development plan 
focusing on the supported part rather than a complex overall business plan covering the whole 
enterprise. PMDP developed a BDS roaster that can be accessed from Chambers of Commerce to 
assist applicants to develop their BDP. The level of matching varies according to the risk (low or high) 
and the nature of the activity (new or existing) from 25 to 75%. In order to ease investors’ contribution, 
PMDP authorised a phased disbursement of the grant and contribution, aligned on the activity. A 
specific window was created for youth and women micro-entrepreneurs (below USD 25 000).

  Proposals are reviewed on a permanent basis by a technical team and submitted on a weekly

basis to the PMDP executive team. If the grant is awarded, the supported activity is implemented by 
the investor and once completed, reimbursement is done according to the agreed contribution. Main 
lessons that have informed RELAP are: 
 
 
 
to be flexible and phase (split) disbursement based on progress on business development plan; 
to recognise informal registration (village council, municipality…) as a valid indicator of the 
existence of a group and its willingness to share common activities; 
 to involve BDS available through chambers of commerce. 
Institutional arrangements and coordination with other donors 
Integration of the project management unit in the Ministry of Agriculture (MoA) has proven 
21.
crucial in institutionalising capacity development and scaling up: One of the key positive PNRMP 
lessons was that ownership and accountability are higher when management is integrated in the MoA. 
The RELAP will therefore retain a similar arrangement, while expanding the PNRMP team to cover 
the various RELAP fields of intervention. 
  Policy and institutional framework (including the framework for climate change adaptation). 
22.
IFAD has been one of the only donors developing projects for implementation directly through the P.A 
government structure (some other donors provide direct budget support, but all donor driven projects 
reviewed by the team were implemented by non-ministry/ PA actors, mostly NGOs). The benefits of 
the approach was also commended by the PPE (that highlighted the level of government ownership, 
institutional capacity building and the contribution of the project to government policies). RELAP will 
continue relying on permanent and legitimate institutions for implementation, further expanding the 
scope of the such partnerships forged by ensuring regular donor coordination meetings around the 
RELAP outcomes. RELAP will also expanded to include the Environmental Quality Authority (EQA) as 
one of the main stakeholders of the project (EQA is the nodal agency for the Green Climate Fund in 
Palestine, and is already deeply involved in the collaborative design process). 
  Coordination with other donors. Will need to be strengthened and increased, especially for the

Appendix 4:  Detailed project description 
RELAP will support key partners in accelerating resilient rural economic growth by both 
1.
expanding the area under cultivation as well as increasing the productivity and profitability of rural 
production. Special attention will be given to ensure adaptiveness and inclusion of less advantaged 
segments of the rural population, in particular families with limited access to land, women and youth 
as well as promoting increased climate resilience through adapted land uses and agricultural 
practices, land and water governance and management. Against this background the RELAP will 
have the following goal: to improve the resilience, land security and livelihoods of rural producers’ 
households in selected villages of the West Bank. 
2.
RELAP will emphasize resilience of rural economic activities through three core outcomes, 
translated into components: Firstly, it will reduce food insecurity by increasing food production and 
improving affordability of key nutritional foods. This is particularly pertinent in a context where 
imported food can be blocked at any time. Efforts will aim at supporting farmers in implementing 
climate resilient and inclusive land development practices. Secondly, it will increase incomes of the 
rural poor from higher production volumes, more aggregation and from more efficient market 
integration that leverage value addition for higher profitability. Here special investment support 
schemes will be made available for youth, women and landless, that will aim to promote climate-
adapted agri-businesses. Thirdly, the RELAP will support a systematic upscaling of smallholders 
adaptation capacities by strengthening public services in their delivery of agricultural tailored climate 
forecasting and early warnings and modelling of future climate change impacts on farming systems 
and land-use suitability. The capacities of public and private extension services providers will be 
strengthened to support farmers’ respond to the increase in water stress and climate variability and 
speed up changes in farming systems and practices. Thus, the development objective will be: to 
increase climate resilience, land productivity, agricultural production and marketing opportunities for 
smallholders and landless rural poor. 
The underlying theory of change is thus one of strengthening resilience of farmers and the rural 
3.
poor in a number of mutually and synergistically reinforcing ways that address the core challenges 
facing not only the target group, but the wider Palestinian nation. Thus the challenge of loss of land, 
high cost of land development and low productivity will primarily be addressed through component 
one where the interventions will aim at improving tenure (by demonstrating use and also legally and 
for women),catalyse upscaling of climate resilient, lower-cost and less invasive land development 
practices that will be more inclusive and more scalable. The challenge of ‘broken’ and non-inclusive 
value chains will be addressed in component two aimed at enhancing the added-value for farmers, 
both those supported under component one, as well as the most marginalised section of the rural 
population, with special focus on the women and youth. Finally, accelerating climate change is further 
aggravating the already severe water scarcity as well as increasing climate variability and the 
frequency of extreme weather events. Component 3 will provide farmers, extension services, private 
suppliers/services providers and agricultural researchers with better and more actionable climate 
data, as well as cost benefit analysis, guidelines and technical support to scale up the adoption by 
smallholders of proven adaptation options suitable for different farming systems. To sustain the 
scaling up effort, this component will also provide technical assistance to develop adaptation 
capacities among relevant public stakeholders, incorporating adaptation objectives and measures in 
planning and programming and linking them into regional and international climate change networks. 
A graphical presentation of the theory of change is found in appendix 6. 
Component 1: Climate resilient land development 
This component is designed to enhance farmer’s and livestock keeper’s access to productive 
4.
agricultural land and water resources under increasing water scarcity through a range of investments 
in land development for different farming systems and livelihoods in area B and C. Main investments 
will be in agricultural roads, soil improvements and rain water harvesting facilities. These investments 
71 
Palestine 
Resilient Land & Resource Management Project 
Final project design report 
Appendix 4:  Detailed project description 
will be undertaken in close partnership with municipalities and villages and will strengthen small 
farmers’ and livestock keeper’s resilience to current and anticipated impacts of climate variability and 
change. The main selection criteria will be availability of at least 200 dunums of suitable land (not 
adjacent to “hot spot areas”) in a village or a cluster of neighbouring villages of suitable land for 
development in Areas B or C, land-use suitability (such as minimum required annual average rainfall 
for water harvesting, top soil depth, reasonable land slopes and not more than 40% rocks). Further 
criteria include: availability of land certificate, opportunities for farming business and rural enterprise, 
while serving the largest numbers of beneficiaries, and in particular the poor rural households and the 
economically active rural smallholders and women.  
In addition to poverty criteria, other selection criteria will assess environmental impact, potential 
5.
adaptation benefits and land-use suitability, technical feasibility, beneficiary contribution and capacity 
to maintain rehabilitated or constructed assets. All selected proposals for investment will have to 
demonstrate the potential to enhance economic opportunities and improved livelihoods, allowing for 
future easier scaling-up by beneficiaries (including private sector), municipalities, villages or central 
government. The identification of areas for land development will be undertaken in a participatory and 
demand-driven manner to ensure that they meet target group needs. The PIM specifies the selection 
criteria in detail (appendix 11). 
6.
This component will also aim to strengthen small farmers’ resilience to current and anticipated 
impacts of climate variability and change, by financing capacity development including knowledge on 
climate impacts on different farming systems and different adaptation options drawing on modelling of 
historical and future trends supported in component 3. A testing and monitoring programme will be set 
up with farmers and livestock keepers participating in the different land development models to 
capture cost-effectiveness and how the different approaches and practices are contributing to 
increasing the resilience of their production systems and allow for systematic learning and adaptive 
changes.  
There is a substantial need for major investments in agricultural land development in West 
7.
Bank to increase steadfastness and smallholder incomes and healthy and affordable food availability 
in local markets as well as in improved rain water harvesting in soils and in facilities for supplementary 
irrigation for enhanced resilience. Any involvement in land development activities will be explicitly 
linked to their ability to catalyse sustainable and inclusive economic growth. The lack of adequate land 
and water resources and climate vulnerability negatively affect the further investment by farmers or 
the proprietors of small and medium-scale enterprises in agricultural activities. 
The main types of investments eligible under the land development component will include land 
8.
and farm development (reclamation, rehabilitation, improvement, and related capacity development 
for agronomic, soil, water and rangeland management), cisterns for rain water harvesting, tree 
seedling and planting, and agricultural access roads.  
The outcomes for this component will be: (i) 70% of developed land reach a productivity per 
9.
dunum at least 20% higher than the average for similar crops and livestock systems in the West Bank 
five years after the start of land development activities; (ii) 80% of beneficiary farmers reporting having 
reduced water shortage vis-à-vis production needs. 
  The land-uses and farming systems to be supported identified at the design phase (with the 
10.
possibility of adding additional systems during implementation) are: Orchards, where relevant 
intercropped with annual crops, on terraces (10%-30% slopes); Orchards and annual crop systems on 
land improved with contour bounds, V-shaped or half-moon planting plots (<10% slope); planting 
trees (olive, fodder shrub trees etc.) directly between the rocks (>30% slopes); integrated crop (wheat, 
barley and fodder crop) and livestock systems under conservation agriculture (CLCA systems); 
cultivation of annual and perennial crops in wadis (seasonal river courses) using gabion structures for 
water and soil harvesting; and rehabilitation of rangelands. When and where possible, land 
development might be linked to wastewater treatment plants using treated wastewater for tree and 
fodder crops.

Appendix 4:  Detailed project description 
The process in stages in the selected villages 
  Stage I: A village engagement process will be implemented with selected village councils and 
11.
mobilizing local production and economic actors including farmer’s and livestock keepers (where 
relevant) both individuals and organized in groups, women’s groups, local traders, and youth. All 
these stakeholders will be presented the RELAP objectives and approaches (including 
selection/targeting criteria) both for land development (component 1) and improved bulking of 
products and linkage to markets, and development of small entrepreneurships for vulnerable, landless 
women and youth (component 2). The stakeholders will be encouraged to select and organise into 
groups of participants interested in land development, bulking of produce and small entrepreneurships 
(self-selection and direct targeting selection according to quotas and selection criteria for inclusion of 
women and youth). When possible these groups may build on already exiting groups. A visioning 
process will be facilitated of a shared land and market development process which will lead to the 
emergence of a rural multi-stakeholder platform (MRP) (see further description in component 2). The 
expected result is to produce a strategic vision charter owned by the local stakeholders and a village 
agreement for land development linked to improved bulking and marketing and targeted 
entrepreneurship development for vulnerable landless women and youth. This vision and agreement 
will serve as basis for components 1 and 2. 
  Stage II: Participatory mapping will be facilitated with the group interested in land development 
12.
of the village landscapes including land-use suitability, development needs (resilience, economic, 
steadfastness, food security) and linkages to market opportunities. The exercise will include farmer’s 
and livestock keepers informed and guided analysis of climate change and variability historical and 
future trends, the impacts on the different cropping and livestock systems and identification of different 
adaptation options for increased resilience. Land development activities and investments in rural 
agricultural roads will be planned based on the mapping exercise and a landscape management 
approach. Each farmer, livestock keeper, livestock management or producers’ groups will be 
supported in the development of medium-term cropping, livestock rearing and business plans. In 
addition to works, equipment and inputs the planning should include farmers’ and livestock keepers’ 
own investments and needs for capacity building and technical assistance. The planning should also 
identify their interest in participating in the systematic testing and monitoring of the production, 
economic and resilience benefits of the land development approaches implemented.  
  Stage III: In this stage farmers and livestock keepers will be supported in the implementation of 
13.
land development works, rehabilitation measures and capacity building and the related medium-term 
cropping, livestock rearing and business plans. As for the business part, this would be further 
supported under component 2.  
14.
  The land development component will comprise of three sub-components: 
  Sub-component 1.1: Testing and monitoring of resilience benefits of land development 
15.
practices. This subcomponent will support the systematic testing and monitoring of and learning with 
farmers and livestock keepers from the land development approaches and practices implemented in 
farmers’ fields under subcomponent 1.2. This systematic monitoring with farmers of the different 
approaches implemented will document benefits and constraints, sharpen the learning, and identify 
the most suitable approaches and practices regarding adaptation benefits and climate resilience, cost-
efficiency, socio-economic benefits and environmental sustainability. The resulting knowledge 
products will serve as basis for continuously improving land development activities under component 
1.2 and an evidence based upscaling of diversified land development interventions and transformation 
to resilient production systems supported by component 3. The subcomponent will include 4 activities: 
i) a stock take study of current land development practices; ii) the design of the testing and monitoring 
programme and its IT data platform; iii) the implementation of the monitoring programme with farmers; 
and iv) development of knowledge products based on the monitoring results relevant for learning, 
upscaling and policy reforms.

rangeland rehabilitation and management, agro-ecological practices for soil improvement and water 
management, ancient wells rehabilitation, wastewater recycling, water harvesting and increased 
storage in soils through integrated soil and water management, conservation agriculture among 
others. As long as MoA participates in joint projects with these actors the information flows, but as 
soon as the project ends a lot of information is kept by NGOs with little sharing.  
  The project will therefore in its first year support a stock take study through a consultancy of 
17.
climate resilient land development practices already used in the country and proven to be cost-
effective and environmental sustainable. The study will cover the suitability of these practices for 
increasing local availability and consumption of nutritious food and income generation, coping with 
current and future climate challenges. The study will cover different land-uses and production systems 
(orchards, integrated cereal and livestock production systems, crop rotations including fodder crops, 
and rangeland livestock rearing). The study will identify and open up for more alternatives for climate 
resilient land-uses and approaches to land development than the ones identified during the project 
design. These approaches can then be included in the engagement with villages on planning of their 
land development activities supported by subcomponent 1.2. Also the study will inform capacity 
building and training activities for upscaling of climate resilient practices to be supported by 
component 3. 
  Activity 1.1.2: Design of testing and monitoring programme and its IT data platform. Also, in the 
18.
first project year, a NGO (selected competitively) will be contracted to design a testing and monitoring 
programme of the various land development approaches and practices implemented under 
subcomponent 1.2. The programme will be designed in collaboration with MoA’s National Agricultural 
Research Centre (NARC) and the PMU. NARC and the PMU will from year two implement the 
programme with MoA local staff and a sample of subcomponent 1.2 beneficiary farmers and livestock 
keepers. The design of the sample of farmers should cover different land development practices, 
agro-ecological zones and production systems. The programme should be designed to monitor 
adaptation benefits such as contribution to household nutritious food consumption, income 
generation, diversification, stability and level of yields, improvements in soil quality, water harvesting 
capacity, and water use efficiency. The NGO will also build an IT platform for systematic data 
management and analysis and train local MoA staff in the implementation with farmers. Short term 
technical assistance will be provided to follow up on the data collection, entrance in the system and 
analysis.  
  A resilience scorecard will be developed (see draft in appendices 13 and 6) to be applied to at 
19.
least all component 1 beneficiary households. The scorecard would be based on simple yes and no 
questions on the households’ resilience capacities including in particular the adoption of project 
outputs meant to address vulnerabilities.  
  Activity 1.1.3: Implementation of testing and monitoring programme. A baseline for the different 
20.
variables to be tested and monitored by the programme will be established at a rolling basis when 
sample villages, farmers and livestock keepers have decided on the land and land development 
practices they will be implementing. Sample farmers and livestock keepers will be trained and 
accompanied by local MoA staff in collecting data and soil samples with the agreed frequencies and 
MoA staff will feed the data into the central IT platform. The resilience scorecard household survey will 
also be applied at the initiation of activities in each village and at the end of the project. NARC will 
analyse soil samples for fertility and chemical and physical characteristics in their laboratory and also 
support the PMU in the analysis of other data on yields, water harvesting and use efficiency, and links 
to income generation. NARC will also meet with farmers, livestock keepers, local MoA and PMU staff 
to discuss the results and any eventual adaptive measures to be taken in land development 
approaches.

used for systematic learning and preparation of knowledge products (policy briefs, documentation of 
practices eventually integrated in the WOCAT platform) and adjustment of land development 
guidelines. These knowledge products will inform the upscaling of adaptation practices on the ground 
supported by component 3 as well as policy processes adjusting/reforming the land development and 
related policies. The aim is to improve the policy framework for more sustainable land development 
and resilience to current and future climate challenges.  
  Sub-component 1.2: Resilient land development. This subcomponent will support the 
22.
implementation of climate resilient land development approaches for different land-uses and farming 
systems in Areas B and C. During project design 6 different land-uses and farming systems have 
been identified but others may be added during project implementation as a result of the stock take 
study supported under subcomponent 1.1. As mentioned above the planning of land development 
activities will be done at village level through a participatory process and based on a land-use 
suitability and landscape management approach. The planning process will identify investments in 
agricultural roads and development of the medium-term cropping, livestock rearing and business 
plans with farmers and livestock keepers for land to be developed. NARC and ICARDA may support 
farmers in this planning process proposing and demonstrating resilient land development practices 
which have already been tried and validated by farmers in the West Bank including participatory 
selection of more resilient crop varieties and land and water management practices for land 
development using less machinery, lowering the costs and capturing and storing more water in the 
soils reducing reliance on cisterns. The targeting selection criteria for eligible farmers and their land 
for the different land-uses and development activities are detailed in appendix 2. Key criteria as well 
as specific adaptation practices are listed in the table below:

land development; iii) crop-livestock integration under conservation agriculture land development; iv) 
wadis land development; v) rangeland rehabilitation; and vi) construction of rural roads. 
  Activity 1.2.1: Support for land registration process. Only 5% of the land in Area B and 26% of 
24.
the land in Area C have been registered under the Palestinian Land Authority (PLA).To increase the 
land tenure security in particular for women this activity will provide training on the registration process 
and legal advisory services during the process.  
  As also stated in appendix 2, legislation provides women the right to inherit, own and dispose of 
25.
property independently of men in their family. However, women are de factor often obstructed from 
this right because of legal, cultural and social barriers. In the Palestinian patriarchal society, mainly

men apply for and pursue certificates of succession at relevant courts and official departments. 
Lengthy, complicated legal procedures and court high fees, which women cannot afford, as well as 
lack of information, pose further restrictions. In this sub-component, the RELAP will aim at 
establishing a systematic mechanism whereby both men and women (including the youth) get access 
to legal paperwork required for land development and get further protected from land 
loss/confiscation. This sub-component will have two core engagements, described below.  
  Empowering women by helping them to obtain information on certificate of succession and/or 
26.
how to claim their inheritance rights : Firstly, awareness raising campaigns/sessions (based on focus 
groups and local village/community discussions) on women’s right to land inheritance will be 
conducted at village level. Households will be made aware of women's right to land ownership and the 
process to claim for this right. This will be backed-up by access to legal advices/services for women 
who would express their interest in obtaining more information on how to claim their rights. Secondly, 
the RELAP provide will budget for trainings of trainers for rural women to advocate and lobby in the 
RELAP targeted areas. These women will be chosen from their communities (10 to 15 women) and 
will be trained on women’s right to inheritance, claiming procedures as well as use of land. They will 
then conduct trainings (number to be determined) for men and women in the RELAP intervention 
areas and organize workshops which will be filmed to be used in other communities/villages and 
broadcasted. Thirdly, RELAP proposes to support the creation of women's solidarity groups, who will 
conduct campaigns and sensitization activities at community level.  
  Helping men and women to officially dispose of and register their land: Based on past evidence, 
27.
not all sensitized men and women will be willing or able to further claim their right to succession or 
inheritance. However, it is expected that a number will be interested in doing so while not being able 
to financially afford the costs of legal procedures. These men and women would be supported 
financially and technically by RELAP to gather the supporting documentation required for land 
registration and to apply for registration or certificate of succession.  
  Activity 1.2.2: Orchard development. The main activities will include de-rocking of the land if 
28.
needed, different types of terracing and soil and water containing infrastructure (depending on slope 
and the natural contours of the landscape could be bench terraces with dry stone masonry retaining 
walls, counter bounds, V-shape or half-moon), fencing, cisterns for rain water harvesting, land 
preparation and tree planting. These activities are planned to implement for an area of about 10,000 
dunum. An important activity will be capacity development and technical support to farmers in 
understanding climate risks and adaptation options, soil and water management practices (e.g. use of 
compost, mulching practices to build up rich top soils and increase soil water filtering and storage 
capacities, conservation agriculture and crop rotation, intercropping with fodder crops) and in 
integrated pest management (IPM) and safe use of pesticides and how to comply with PALGAP (see 
component 2 below) requirements in farming practices . Emphasis will be on identifying the most cost-
effective interventions taking into account landscape characteristics and the need for creating resilient 
and sustainable socio-economic benefits.  
  Activity 1.2.3. Land development for crop-livestock systems under conservation agriculture. In 
29.
the northern and southern part of the West Bank farmers cultivate cereal integrated with goat and 
sheep rearing and sometimes fodder crops.102 The majority of these systems are rain-fed in areas 
with down to 250 mm annual rainfall and as such vulnerable to rainfall variability. They have low 
productivity, due to poor soil conservation practices affecting its nutrient levels and water storage 
capacity. Also limited access to feed is a constraint. Conservation Agriculture (CA) principles 
(minimum tillage, crop residue retention and soil cover, and crop rotation/intercropping) have been 
proven to be effective interventions for increasing soil water retention capacities, enhancing crop 
productivity and improving resource-use efficiency and soil health under low rainfall conditions 
including in some pilot areas in the north of the West Bank (barley-livestock systems) and in the south 
102   Around 17% of the agricultural land in the West Bank was cultivated with wheat in 2012/13 according to MoA presented in 
“Palestinian Agricultural Production and Marketing between Reality and Challenges”. Applied Research Institute-Jerusalem,

(wheat-livestock systems). However, for small farms in dry areas, the lack of technical options, such 
as suitable farm implements, and the use of crop residues as animal feed, are major constraints for 
the adoption of CA, where crop residues should be left on the field for mulching. By integrating high 
nutritious feed crops in crop rotation plans, experimenting and finding the optimal balance between 
crop residues use for mulching and for feed, and by implementing complementary irrigation from 
rainwater harvesting or reusing treated wastewater where possible, the use of CA principles can be 
very efficient in increasing system resilience and productivity of crops as well as livestock.  
  The project will therefore train interested small crop-livestock farmers in how to implement and 
30.
manage balanced CLCA systems and further improve soil fertility and physical quality by adding 
compost in an estimated 3500 dunums. The project will also support the modification of two sowing 
machineries to minimum-tillage conditions and support the transfer of the machines to cooperatives 
responsible for their management. Where possible the project will also co-finance works for rainwater 
harvesting and equipment for complementary irrigation systems. This activity may receive support 
from ICARDA facilitated by linking RELAP through south-south exchange to a recently approved IFAD 
inter-regional grant to ICARDA for conservation agriculture in crop livestock system in NEN (Tunisia 
and Algeria) and LAC (Nicaragua and Bolivia). 
 Activity 1.2.4: Wadis land development. Wadis (creeks and river courses) with seasonal water 
31.
flows in erosion prone areas have high potentials for harvesting of sediments and runoff water for 
reclamation of new land for agricultural production. This is done by constructing small soil and water 
retention gabions (stone walls preferably in wire cages) eventually combined with water collection, 
storage and distribution systems. There are few pilot experiences in the West Bank that shows that 
already after two years enough soil has been build up behind the walls to allow for cultivation of tree 
crops and also barley and vegetables. The project will therefore work with interested groups of 
farmers willing to provide co-financing and support feasibility studies, the design and works for the 
establishment of wadis land reclamation systems in an estimated 1000 dunums. One challenge for 
the sustainability of these system that needs to be addressed is the effective maintenance and 
operation of the systems and eventual governance of water allocations if a water storage and 
distribution system is used in particular in years with low rainfall. The project will therefore support the 
formation and training of wadis users’ associations, development and implementation of an operation 
and maintenance plan, eventual regulations for water allocations, and a fee or in-kind contribution 
system to support recurrent maintenance works and costs.  
  Activity 1.2.5: Rangeland rehabilitation. The eastern slopes of the West Bank are in area C and 
32.
home to Bedouin communities constantly under pressure for losing access to their communal grazing 
land for their livestock (mainly sheep and goats) and increasing vulnerable to the impacts from climate 
change in terms of decreasing rainfalls and increasing temperatures. Out of the 2,000,000 dunums of 
grazing land, the Israeli now uses 1,200,000 dunum as military zone. Because of the eviction from 
and rupture of the Bedouin communities management of their land, the remaining 800,000 dunums 
are to varying degrees suffering from overgrazing, lack of management and consequently 
degradation. However, the Rangeland and Forestry Department (RFD) under the MoA in collaboration 
with NGOs has successful experiences in rangeland rehabilitation with Bedouin communities on 
communal land doubling the annual dry matter production from around 25 to 50 kg per dunum in the 
south and from around 40 to 80 kg per dunum in the north. This means also a doubling of the animal 
production which is an important incentive for the Bedouin communities to set aside land, engage in 
the lengthy rehabilitation process and organize subsequent rangelands’ governance and 
management.  
  Building on these experiences and recognizing that livestock rearing on rangeland is the most 
33.
resilient livelihood and land-use in these areas with annual rainfalls below 200 mm, the project will 
support Bedouin communities and other livestock keepers in rangeland rehabilitation on an estimated 
3500 dunums of communal lands bringing also nutrition benefits in terms of increased access to 
animal proteins to these communities. This will include agreements with the communities for selection 
of suitable areas for fencing and rehabilitation. The recovery can take 3-5 years and consists in 
78

Appendix 4:  Detailed project description 
rehabilitation of top soils, assisted and natural reseeding of native grass species, the planting of shrub 
species in planting pits with high fodder qualities, and rehabilitation of wells or construction of 
rainwater harvesting facilities and cisterns for irrigating the plants the first year and later for animal 
water points. The communities will contribute with labour and the RFD will hire youth from the 
communities as rangers. The RFD will co-manage the rehabilitated areas with the communities in the 
beginning and gradually build their capacities to establish and implement bylaws and fully take over 
the rotational management carefully monitoring and respecting the rangeland carrying capacity. 
Support will also be provided for the communities to establish operation and maintenance rules and 
management systems for animal water points.  
  As a means to address the severe water constrained conditions for agriculture, increase water 
34.
use efficiency, and avoid the high fees charged by Israel for wastewater coming from the Palestinian 
wadis to Israel the Palestinian Water Authority (PWA), MoA and various municipalities supported by 
different donors has embarked on constructing treatment plants and irrigation infrastructure for 
reusing treated wastewater for tree and fodder crops. In areas where these plants will be operating 
the next years there is an opportunity that RELAP land development investments can be linked to 
these plants financing the irrigation infrastructure and last mile pipes instead of rainwater harvesting 
and cisterns. RELAP would also support the strengthening of Water Users Associations (WUA) 
including their fee collection and implementation of operation and maintenance plans for the irrigation 
systems. This will give famers opportunities to producing high yielding cash tree and fodder crops.  
  One plant already operating is the Nablus West treatment plant supported by KfW that has an 
35.
Euro 10 million approved project to invest in land development with farmers and infrastructure for 
providing treated wastewater for 3,000 dunums surrounding the plant. This project will be 
implemented by the Municipality of Nablus in collaboration with the farmer's WUA and the MoA using 
7,000 m3 of the 11,000 m3 of treated water the plant is currently providing per day. In 2018 more 
neighborhoods will be connected to the plant and it will reach its maximum capacity of producing 
14,000 m3 per day. PWA mentioned to the design mission that the additional 7,000 m3 can be used for 
South Jinin, where the RELAP could eventually be investing in the connection pipeline, irrigation 
system and land development. In the future there could also be similar opportunities for RELAP 
investments related to treatment plants in Nablus East, Tubas and Hebron. While the opportunity for 
linking RELAP investments to the Nablus West plant could materialise before the midterm review of 
the project the implementation of the other plants should be monitored and RELAP opportunities 
revisited at midterm.  
  The Strategic Water Resources and Transmission Plan &, Water Sector policy and Strategy 
36.
2014 considers treated wastewater as one of the most important water sources for agriculture. The 
regulatory and monitoring framework for the use of treated wastewater is in place but needs to be 
further strengthened and adjusted as the different schemes are getting rolled out and lessons are 
learned. This include the treated wastewater standard parameters required for different crops, water 
tariff setting, and establishment of WUAs for them to operate and maintain the schemes under full 
cost recovery. RELAP involvement should contribute to the strengthening of the framework through a 
robust monitoring and learning system linked to the RELAP investments. 
37.
  Sub-component 1.3: Investment in Agricultural Roads. This sub-component will focus on 
agricultural roads and ancillary structures that will underpin the land development activities under the 
sub-component 1.2, by assuring reliable access to and from the lands developed for agricultural 
production. The roads to be constructed will comprise mainly of opening and placement of stabilised 
gravel layer. Eligible investments will include also road ancillaries such as drainage facilities (side 
channels and culverts) and required retaining walls to ensure climate resilience of constructed 
agricultural roads. When possible rainwater harvesting for agricultural use from the roads may be built 
into drainage structures. 
  Based on review of similar works implemented by the MoA including under the recently 
38.
completed IFAD funded PNRMP (de-rocking of the land, different types of terracing and soil 
containing infrastructure such as bench terraces with dry stone masonry retaining walls, counter

bounds, V-shape or half-moon) the indicative cost for per dunum land development of USD 1,320 is 
considered, including water harvesting facilities and tree planting. An average per dunum cost of USD 
875 is considered for developing of wadis with soil and water retention walls, water storage and 
distribution systems. The estimated cost per dunum for rangeland rehabilitation is USD 624, and 
crop–livestock conservation agriculture systems have an estimated dunum cost of around USD 190. 
Construction/improvement of agricultural roads of 6 m wide with 2 m shoulders (mainly opening and 
placement of stabilised gravel layer) may vary between USD 20,000 up to USD 30,000 per km 
depending on the status of the road and complexity of drainage structures and retaining walls. An 
average cost of USD 25,000 per km may be considered a conservative estimate, with an average 
length per road of about 2 km. The cost of the civil works listed above include Value Added Tax (VAT) 
of 16% as per the applicable legislation of the P.A. Details of unit cost estimation are provided in the 
annex 1. The cost of communications, information campaigns, staff salaries and allowances and 
equipment and vehicle operational costs will be incorporated into entire project operating budget. 
  The above figures are indicative only, based on the estimated costs of relevant activities. There 
39.
will be no pre-defined allocation for different types of interventions, nor will the number of villages to 
be financed in each governorate or priority area be pre-determined. The investment proposals ranking 
criteria will ensure that funds are allocated where the goal of improving livelihoods and economic 
growth in disadvantaged targeted villages/municipalities and reducing climate change vulnerability.  
  The anticipated outputs from the component implementation are expected to be: i) 18,000 
40.
dunum of land are developed for agricultural production; and ii) 50 roads with total lengths of about 
100 km are constructed/improved to ensure access to the developed agricultural lands. It is estimated 
that investments would reach a total of about 4 500 rural households in 60-80 villages/municipalities 
from the 6 governorates targeted by components 1 and 2, providing opportunities for improved 
livelihoods and economic growth and reducing projected climate change vulnerability risks.  
  Beside the reducing the overall risk from the projected climate change vulnerability by 
41.
increasing water storage capacity in the oils and providing facilities for rain water harvesting the 
development and improvement of agricultural land will benefit households in increasing their 
production opportunities, local access to nutritious food and hence livelihood conditions. The main 
benefit will be in terms of sustainable and efficient natural resources management (water and land) 
and increased secure and quality agriculture production. 
In addition, the construction works associated with the component will have a direct impact in 
42.
terms of temporary employment generation, as it is a common practice in the West Bank land 
development projects that all the labour-intensive works for land development are implemented 
through farmers, who are paid 70% for labour intensive works estimated to be 70% of total investment 
cost,. The remaining 30% of labour investment cost or 20% of total investment cost is considered as 
in-kind contribution by farmers in addition to required 15% cash contribution of machine works cost 
estimated to be about 30% of total investment cost. Thus, the estimated investment cost by farmers 
for land development activities is about 25% of total investment cost, including some 5% in cash and 
20% in-kind.103

Seedlings, fencing, etc. are included in the estimation of USD 1,300 per dunum

Component 2: Market linkages for the rural poor 
  The outcomes for this component will be (i) increased production and marketing of agricultural 
43.
produce by 30% and (ii) the development of 6,650 micro-enterprises that will better harness market 
opportunities, amongst whom at least 900 managed by women and youth will have upgraded their 
productive capacities. The component will comprise of two sub components: 1) Rural clustering of 
agricultural products, and 2) Inclusive entrepreneurship development. The subcomponents will be 
implemented through an on-going permanent support that can be subdivided into four stages logically 
linked to one other. These four stages are firstly broadly described before to detail how activities will 
be run throughout. 
  The process in four stages. Within each site, the intervention process can be summarised 
44.
into a succession of four stages that will be undertaken to allow all stakeholders to have fully 
understood their common and individual interests and respective roles. 
  Stage I (6 to 9 months): Visioning and Planning- The expected result is to produce a strategic 
45.
vision charter owned by local stakeholders. This first step is to be jointly conducted for component 1 
and 2, as described above, and will consist in: i) engaging with communities, ii) presenting RELAP 
objectives and approaches, iii) selecting and organising participants (self-selection and direct 
targeting selection, see appendix 2), iv) mobilising economic actors (emergence of the MRPs), v) 
visioning of a shared land and market development process, vi) planning of economic infrastructure, 
vii) strengthening of commodity groups, and viii) sensitizing for youth involvement.  
  Stage II (12 to 18 months). Building of infrastructures and sustainable plan of management - 
46.
The expected results are the improvement of the economic infrastructure context (common and 
individual) and of technical skills (entrepreneurship, marketing). During that stage, social 
mobilisation continues (consolidation of MRPs and of specific groups, where needed; creation of 
infrastructure management bodies, linkages with other marketing projects, etc.), civil engineering 
starts (design and building of collection centre), inclusive entrepreneurship support (investments 
grants).  
  Stage III (9 to 12 months). Ensuring economic viability - The expected results are increased 
47.
volumes of marketed agricultural products. The third stage consists of making use of economic 
infrastructure towards the development of economically viable set-up through better access to 
commercial outlets (urban central wholesale markets, business to business contracts, linkages with 
agro-industry through private sector and cooperatives), access to finance (individual investment, 
matching grants), and branding products and the area (marketing linkages, promoting Palestine good 
agricultural practices).  
  Stage IV (up to 6 months). Exit strategy - The expected results are the existence of robust 
48.
linkages between rural economic actors and development partners that will accelerate inclusive 
81 
Palestine

Appendix 4:  Detailed project description 
economic growth. This last stage focuses on exit strategy activities and the way forward is defined, 
together with development partners (access to rural finance with financial institutions, linkages and

agricultural produce relies on two complementary pillars: i) mobilisation of all market stakeholders 
including the local authorities to develop a shared vision on agricultural product clustering and 
facilitation of market linkages, ii) improvement of common economic infrastructure as well as adapted 
local regulations to determine the access to and use of the infrastructure. Local bulking will also be 
enhanced by the rehabilitation/building of agricultural roads linking developed lands to villages 
(subcomponent 1.3). 
  The subcomponent will comprise two interwoven activities: i) Establishment of local multi 
51.
stakeholder rural platforms (MRPs), and ii) Rehabilitation/construction of village collection centres.

farming activities through commonly adopted initiatives. The enterprises may include business in 
trading, processing, packaging and provision of input supply such as efficient irrigation equipment, 
seeds and seedlings, compost and quality soil.

Implementation Process. Rural people, mostly small-farmers but also women and youth who 
53.
may be landless, have the ambition to engage, both individually and together, to better produce and 
trade towards the main urban centres, locally recognised and appreciated agricultural products - olive 
oil, small ruminants, milk, almond, grapes, fruit and vegetables, honey, aromatic herbs, to name the 
main ones- to generate regular incomes at various levels of the value chains.  
It is foreseen to establish thirty multi stakeholder rural platforms (MRPs) based on the number 
54.
of “clustered sites” of intervention for land development activities whose roles are described in the 
subcomponent 1.1 and 1.2. Out of them, ten will also be involved in piloting the 
rehabilitation/construction of ten market and collection centres. Implementation will be phased into two 
batches of five market & collection centres in the targeted governorates. Increasing local trade of 
agricultural produce relies on two complementary pillars: i) Mobilisation and involvement of all market 
stakeholders (producers and their organisations, traders), including the local authorities to develop a 
shared vision on agricultural product bulking and facilitation of market linkages; and ii) Improvement of 
common economic infrastructure as well as adapted local regulations to determine the access to and 
the use of the infrastructure.  
  RELAP will identify existing trading nodes that already aggregate products from neighbouring 
55.
villages to achieve economies of scale and attract traders. Consequently, local economic actors, that 
may be already organised in group or not, will improve horizontal linkages and constitute a multi-
stakeholders rural platform once they are brought together104. The MRPs’ aim will be to regularly 
exchange information concerning their practices and skills and eventually to express a common stand 
to influence decision making instances within the territory covering several villages. A MRP is a 
framework of communication between existing market stakeholders amongst whom existing farmers' 
organisations (groups, associations, cooperatives) are part of. A MRP may also facilitate the 
emergence or the maturation of specific organisations to fulfil newly identified roles and services 
particularly with regards to the management of economic infrastructure. 
56.
  MPs will be facilitated in RELAP sites of intervention (30) and will comprise all agricultural 
market stakeholders - producers (including current and past land developers, and agro pastoralists 
when present) and their organisations, local traders, brokers, transporters, women association, youth 
clubs, etc. 
Figure 5: Process of the rural multi-stakeholder platform 
  The MRP will not be an institution per se but a flexible set-up among market stakeholders

aiming at i) upgrading their capacities (to do better than what they currently do; ii) developing 
synergies with other market stakeholders and iii) upscaling their impact105. MRPs will also represent a

failure in terms of outlets as it has been observed during the mission).

space/sphere of influence and decisions for those actors that are usually excluded or not represented, 
particularly the women and the youth. MRPs are communication tools aiming at strengthening 
synergies between local organised actors; their sustainability will evolve with stakeholders' needs. 
Their role lies in their ability to influence decision makers, either at production, marketing or 
institutional level. More information on MRPs’ different roles is presented in Table 21 below. 
  MRPs will be the main interface with the project/MoA (on the various RELAP sites of 
58.
intervention and more particularly with those selected for rehabilitation of economic ) and eventually 
other development business partners (e.g. financial institutions, other projects and programmes and 
particularly the FAO/MAP). Their main role will be to facilitate relationships and linkages amongst its 
members to ensure a proper use and the sustainability of the investments. If demanded, the MRPs 
will support their constitutive groups to become formally registered (cooperatives, unions) and 
proactively involved in the various value chains.  
  MRPs will also be a point of entry to promote PALGAP (Palestine good agricultural practices) 
59.
with both producers and urban clientele with the support of the Palestinian standards Institute (PSI)106. 
The MRPs will directly interact with municipality and village councils for logistical improvement of 
market and collection centres.  
In term of governance, representatives from various involved stakeholders (producers’ groups, 
60.
traders and transporters, women groups, youth) will have to represented. MRPs are led by a 
coordinating committee elected by the various representatives ensuring that (i) all main stakeholders 
are represented, (ii) at least 40% are women and (iii) at least 40% are youth. MRP's main role will be 
to convene regular MRP meetings and follow-up recommendations with the concerned parties. Since 
the MRP's recommendations are not binding, the steering committee powers reside in its influencing 
capacities. It will meet on a regular basis to review progress of the various activities. Each MRP will 
develop its own charter and bylaws to function.  
61.
  The key functions of the MRPs will be: i) to identify and address the main constraints affecting 
marketing of agricultural products (from the area to the main urban markets); ii) to collect and share 
market intelligence (price, volume, opportunities) and to act as interface with other existing broader 
platforms/programmes at governorate or national levels supported by government and other 
donors(FAO-Canada project, multi-donor agricultural project, AMENCA III, etc.), and iii) to 
organise/participate in events promoting trading of local agricultural products (e.g. bulked and 
processed) as well as promoting Palestine good agricultural practices (PALGAP) on markets. 
62.
In collaboration with the project, the MRPs will produce a strategic vision of marketing for 
agricultural markets for the area. The MRPs will directly interact with the municipality and village 
councils for logistical improvement of village collection centres. 
  The MRPs may form committees to monitor specific activities when necessary (e.g. per 
63.
product, youth mentorship, local audit of economic infrastructure management and business plans 
technical review). The MRPs also constitute, de facto, a peer accountability forum where the various 
project beneficiaries will openly share progress and achievement to encourage synergies.  
64.
In addition to being an instrument to strengthen beneficiaries' business oriented activities the 
MRPs will also serve as an effective entry point for social building and awareness creation. They will 
be used to bring about information and awareness on thematic areas such as gender and nutrition.

Since the MRPs will develop a vision to improve marketing set-up in the area, it is also the 
proper forum to discuss what opportunities may emerge at individual level to take advantage of 
the new context that will catalyse both group and individuals' initiatives (greenhouse, 
hydroponics, cold storage, processing, storage, trade...).  
Groups: training / supporting rural micro-enterprises in groups to be involved in agricultural 
products value chains. Such groups aim at adding value to their products to increase the price 
paid to producers. The economic viability will have to be ensured through the implementation of 
a hand-on business development plan taking into account all costs to be covered to provide the 
needed services This is particularly crucial to assess if the service is viable and how it actually 
impact on the price paid to producers. 
Individuals: training individuals to develop business plans that take opportunity of the conducive 
context created by RELAP. Specific discussions will be facilitated to go beyond short term 
activities and propose mid-term investment in line with development of value chains in the area. 
The training will be based on actual cases for each investor. At the end of the training process, 
the investor will have produced his/her business development plan and financing plan in a 
presentable form to be submitted to a financial institution of her/his choice, if bank finance is 
needed. 
Training in business plans should be developed by the implementing partner that can outsource 
trainers/practitioners having experience of this matter. A training module manual will be 
developed and approved by PMU that will have to ensure that quality is ensured. Collaboration 
with other programmes/donors will be crucial and facilitated through the PMU permanent liaison 
with them. 
Training Manual should describe how the training will be organised on the basis of two two-day 
modules separated by a practical period when each trainee develops a business plan related to

his/her own activities that can be reviewed during the second module. 60 beneficiaries per MRP 
are targeted during the years 2,3,4 and 5 of the Project. Planning will take into consideration 
the planned call for proposals by the FAO/MAP (mid-2019 for the second call) to encourage 
RELAP micro-entrepreneurs to apply. 
  Activity 2.1.3: Rehabilitation/construction of marketing and collecting centres. It is foreseen to 
67.
pilot the rehabilitation/construction of 10 market and collection centres.  
In each of the governorates of intervention, the MoA / RELAP will identify one or two sites 
68.
already renown as trading node between several villages benefiting from rehabilitation and 
reclamation investments (component 1). In agreement with local authorities (village or municipalities), 
these sites will be rehabilitated/upgraded as market and collection centres to allow all local market 
stakeholders to better trade and match supply with a demand of bulked agricultural products.  
In each area, sites to be selected will have to be accessible from the main road to easily access 
69.
urban centres (connected with outlets as wholesale markets, niche and retail markets, agro-
processing industry), and to continue to serve as a trading node bulking agricultural products from the 
smallholder farmers. A market and collection centre will consist in a dedicated space with enough 
parking for trade vehicles and fenced transaction areas, small scale buffer storage facilities ventilated 
and/ or cold storage to allow few days storage, packaging/weighing equipment, a small administrative 
office and sanitary facilities. Proper drainage for collection and storage facilities will be constructed to 
prevent flooding from heavy rainfalls. 
  Municipality / village councils, in close collaboration with the MRPs, will provide a suitable area 
70.
on their own costs and will be the owners of the infrastructure considered as a public goods.  
  They will transfer the collection centres’ management to a legally registered managerial body 
71.
that might be an existing associations/groups belonging to MRPs and that will recover its running and 
maintenance costs from the collection of affordable user's fees107 (tentatively 2%) as it is currently 
done in the various wholesale central markets (4% in average). Since FOs are part and parcel of 
MRPs as all local market stakeholders, they participate to design the more adapted management set-
up and, may either participate in the creation of the new company (as shareholders) or directly 
manage the centre if legally registered and MRP / local authorities are satisfied and support it.  
  A draft PIM in appendix 11 will provide some details – but the full PIM will be prepared during

the first year of project implementation). 
Implementation process. During stage 1: Location for the collection centre will be identified by 
73.
the MRP with the aim to aggregate the main agricultural produce in the area and attract traders 
(private or cooperative) to secure flows of marketed products towards urban outlets. Market and 
Collection centres are considered as common goods and financed at 100% by RELAP investment 
grants. The focus will be on infrastructure giving better access to urban markets to small-scale family 
farmers.  
  Discussions within the MRPs will be facilitated by the programme implementing partners 
74.
(NGOs) under the supervision of the PMU during the first stage of the intervention in the area. 
Selection criteria for investment would include: stakeholder commitment (including co-financing or 
construction of complementary infrastructure such as storage or post-harvest and handling in the 
planned collection centre area); access to main roads; and up-scaling opportunities) (see following 
table). 
  For each site, the existing context is discussed along the tentative list of criteria to evaluate how 
75.
conducive it is to ensure the economic success of the dynamic market and collection centre. A grade 
from to 1 to 3, representing a low, medium or highly conducive context, is given for each location. The 
prioritisation exercise is to provide an open local space for discussions. Each criterion will generate a

access for both traders (from main road) and for small-scale producers (from agricultural roads), 
parking for trade vehicles, fenced transaction areas, small scale buffer storage facilities, 
packaging/weighing equipment, small administrative office and lavatories. 
  During stage 2: Design and construction of the collection centre. The MRPs will appoint their 
77.
own construction advisory committee (CAC) to provide inputs to the design and construction process 
which will be implemented by contractors selected under the Project procurement guidelines under 
the technical supervision of MoA engineers (see component 1.3). CAC will nominate two delegates 
who will participate to site meetings108 as observers, in this capacity, they will be in a position i) to 
inform MRP about progress made and ii) to contribute to the quality of the infrastructure with eventual 
unforeseen improvements. CAC has an advisory role to the municipal / village council that is final 
decision making body.  
  The location, type and capacity of the required collection centre in each site will be assessed 
78.
through comprehensive discussions within the MRPs to confirm the optimal location in terms of 
trading and appropriateness of required structures, to ensure the full utilization of constructed 
facilities. MoA engineers will provide necessary engineering design, procurement and construction 
supervision support to the PMU which will be responsible for contract management (see component 
1.3).

It has been estimated that each market and collection centre can deal with an annual volume of 
79.
transactions reaching 4,200 tons of fruit and vegetables and 720 tons of olives and almonds. It is 
estimated that each market can trade up to 7 five-tons vehicle par market day (3 per week), which is 
equivalent to 40 to 50 tons of agricultural products per market. Estimates of the surfaces are based on 
that assumption. These figures are based on discussions with officials from the MA and discussions 
with stakeholders. These estimates will form the basis for discussions in each MRP and with 
concerned local authorities to adapt to local context, needs and specificities.

  The list of equipment presented above will be adapted to each situation. However, it is 
80.
important to consider as compulsory equipment the scales and weighing bridges that will provide a 
sound basis to measure transactions in a fair way.  
  Activity 2.1.4: Training /supporting market and collection centre management bodies. The 
81.
output for this activity will be that the 10 public owned market and collection centre are managed by 
autonomous bodies (companies, associations or cooperatives) entrusted by the village/municipality 
council through a local public private partnership agreement to recover all costs through market fees. 
Implementation Process. During stage 2: The MRPs will discuss how an autonomous, legally 
82.
registered, market and collection centre management set-up is to ensure the sustainable and 
financially viable use of the centre, while ensuring inclusive access to all stakeholders. In most cases, 
it will rely on revived or newly created people' organisations (cooperatives, associations, women 
groups, companies). Their mandate will specifically stipulate that the management will ensure a 
permanent access to all users regardless of their membership and to ensure that private traders can 
use the infrastructure at an agreed user fee (around 2% of the value of the transactions).  
  All necessary support services will be listed (security, weighing point, tax clearance, clean and 
83.
shaded spaces, price and volume information, easy access and parking for vehicle, availability of 
taskforce for specific tasks – unloading, packing, loading…). As a common economic infrastructure, 
market and collection centre falls under the local authorities' mandate. A specific agreement between 
local authorities and the managing body will be signed to allow an effective and efficient functioning of 
the centre while insuring the collection of market fees that include management and operational costs 
and local taxes to be reversed to the local authorities (local public private partnership). The managing 
body will establish annual action plan to be presented to the MRP and to the village / municipal 
council. It will specifically provide estimates of incomes (from the collection of market fees from 
users), operational and management costs as well as petty maintenance costs (see following tables). 
  On the basis of the estimates described in the previous paragraphs, the following income and 
84.
expenditures budget has been established. It shows that with an annual volume of transaction 
increasing by 30% thanks to the quality of the infrastructure, and with a market fee equivalent to 2%, 
together with another specific fee when using temporary storage facilities, each market and collection 
centre can cover its operational and management with a 40% gross benefit while managing to also 
support depreciation costs and remaining with a 20% net benefit. This model is tentatively built to 
emphasize the importance to discuss about market fees since the very beginning on concrete basis.

  During stage 3: Apart from its legal obligation (annual audited accounts, annual report of activity 
85.
approved by members), the managing body will provide regular information to the MRPs on the 
generated activities and emerging challenges. The MRPs, as consultative bodies, provide 
recommendations that have to be confirmed by the highest authority of the management body to be 
enforced. Training will comprise: legal aspects, linkages with village/municipalities councils and taxes, 
establishment of a user fee to ensure an economically viable management, strategic planning, 
business and investment plan, book-keeping, infrastructure maintenance, price and volume 
information, settlement of disputes. This training, to be done along ToR developed by PMU, will be 
facilitated by the implementing partner (NGO) that may mobilise external experts, when necessary. As 
for all activities, the PMU, through its agribusiness unit, will supervise and assess the quality of 
service delivery. 
86.
  MRPs will also permanently assess the impact of the market and collection centre on the local 
economy and how the various actors benefit from it. In the current tentative RELAP model below, the 
impact is well distributed on the various actors more than half of the price remains in the hand of the 
producers.

  Activity 2.1.5: Organisation of promotional events. In order to facilitate exchanges and sharing 
87.
of information, the MRPs will be involved in the organisation of fair/festival, farmers’ exchanges and 
study tours. Promotional events will be planned at a governorate level to encourage synergies 
between the MRPs and marketing and collecting centres. During these occasions, specific 
communication campaigns will be organised to popularise PALGAP with producers and with the 
customers.  
It may also include study tours in neighbouring governorates, specific market identification trips 
88.
in urban areas particularly the various central wholesale markets. Study tours will be organized 
considering also the opportunities for women and youth groups to travel and learn. 
Summary of the detailed activities (quantities) 
89.
IPs will be contracted to support RELAP in each targeted governorate. 
IPs will provide a dedicated agribusiness development unit staffed with 4 experts posted in the 
90.
concerned governorates (1 agro-economist and supervisor, 3 site officers with complementary 
competencies in extension, entrepreneurship support, agri-business and marketing, communication).  
91 
Palestine 
Resilient Land & Resource Management Project 
Final project design report 
Appendix 4:  Detailed project description 
91.
Local expenses to support 5 MRPs per governorate will be included in the IPs contract on the 
basis of supporting a 30 people regular meetings (participants transport costs, refreshments, renting 
hall, stationaries, contingencies) during 3 years (stage 1, 2 and 3).  
  Training of rural micro-entrepreneurs will be included in the IPs contract on the basis of 60 
92.
persons per MRP for a 4-day training (that may be done in several sections) (participants transport 
costs, refreshments, renting hall, stationaries, contingencies) during 2 years (stage 2 and 3). Trainers 
cost are included in IPs salaries. If IP mobilise external trainer, it should be approved by PMU with no 
external cost for RELAP.  
  Training of collection centre management bodies will be included in the IPs contract on the 
93.
basis of 10 persons per collection centre (one per governorate) for a monthly four-day training during 
2 years (stage 2 and 3). Trainees may also include village council / municipality. If IP mobilise external 
trainer, it should be approved by PMU with no external cost for RELAP.  
  Organisation of promotional events, farmers’ exchanges, study tours will be included in the IPs 
94.
contract on the basis of an annual lump sum per governorate for 4 years (stage 1, 2, 3 and4). 
Tentative events are to be detailed in the proposal.  
  An overall 15% cost applicable to the above listed activities will be eligible to cover all over 
95.
investment and management cost to be borne by the implementing partner.  
In order to ensure that IPs earmarked to facilitate social engineering activities described in the 
96.
above parts, PMU will organise a specific training workshop to share the various concepts and review 
the PIM. A technical assistance has been budgeted for to support that process in year 1.  
97.
  Building of collection centre will be done with a procedure aligned on the one described in 1.4 
(roads). A lump sum has been allocated to build one collection centre per governorate once PMU is 
satisfied with the location. In order to fulfil all necessary studies and design, an architectural firm will 
be recruited on a competitive basis. An amount equivalent to 5% of the infrastructure cost has been 
budgeted to that effect. ToRs will be adapted from those described in component 1.4 (regarding 
roads). During the works contract implementation, another consulting firm will be recruited on a 
competitive basis to supervise and certifies works progress according to the bill of quantities agreed 
upon in the contractors' contract. The same 5% amount has been budgeted to this effect.  
  Since the rehabilitation/construction of market and collecting centre is a new investment, a 
98.
specific short term technical assistance in architectural design of rural wholesale markets has been 
provided for during the two first years to support the selected firms to design the expected centres in 
line with expected standards.  
  Subcomponent 2.2. Inclusive entrepreneurship development support. It is expected that 
99.
900 individual /group rural micro-entrepreneurs develop their productive/business capacities to 
improve their incomes from the relevant value chains through investment grants.  
  The subcomponent will have a clear focus on rural women, unemployed youth, their 
100.
organizations, and the poor landless at the village level, who, belonging to the same villages, will also 
be encouraged to participate in the MRPs. The support will address the key constraints of these 
groups, including: i) the lack of capital and the lack of collateral (including land) required by financial 
institutions to obtain credit; ii) the high real interest rates available from MFIs; iii) the mobility 
constraints and the unreliability of job opportunities in Israel, especially for rural youth; and iv) the lack 
of business advice/technical assistance 
  The RELAP inclusive entrepreneurship development support will be provided through a micro-
101.
enterprise facility (MEF) delivering entrepreneurship grants, together with tailored technical assistance 
provided by business development services (BDS) providers registered under Chamber of 
Commerce, to ensure that the target groups or individuals develop or expand climate-smart and 
market oriented micro and small businesses generating incomes. The MRPs will have a catalytic 
effect on local and agri-based enterprises in the villages and municipalities. Both new and current 
small-scale businesses will be eligible to the RELAP support with the ultimate objective of improving 
92

net incomes. Proposals with a demonstrated job creation effect as well as proposals contributing to 
increased production of agricultural products will be given priority. Investment grants could be 
awarded in instalments, depending on size and business plan (to be decided on a case-by-case 
basis). 
Implementation process 
  At Stage 2: Individual investments will be determined by the rural micro-entrepreneurs 
102.
themselves with regards to opportunities that will emerge within the area covering several 
neighbouring villages. These individual investments shall be determined and assessed on the basis of 
economic viability duly documented in an action plan comprising of the business development and 
financial plans (established during the training support see subcomponent 2.1).  
  At stages 2-3: The investor (producer or small entrepreneur) is to benefit from an investment 
103.
grant (85%) to complete its financing plan. It is estimated that around 75 individuals per governorate 
can benefit from an investment grant respecting target priorities. However, this number is indicative 
and the grants are to be firstly allocated according the quality of the proposals.  
  A non-exhaustive list of potential individual investment comprises: greenhouses, hydroponics, 
104.
drip irrigation systems, processing equipment, dry or cold storage facilities and packaging equipment. 
Quantities and type of productive infrastructure are indicative and will be driven by a demand that will 
change with the evolution of the context impacting on rural micro-entrepreneurs' choice.  
  This subcomponent only accounts for the most vulnerable rural micro-entrepreneurs who are 
105.
targeted to benefit from the RELAP micro-entrepreneurship facility (MEF). Other individuals and group 
rural micro-entrepreneurs will benefit from RELAP training (see subcomponent 2.1) to eventually 
access financing by the IFs and other projects / programmes. 
Detailed activities (quantities) 
  The MEF is directly managed by the PMU that will create a database to monitor the attributed 
106.
grants (on average 75 per governorate). A USD 5 000 ceiling has been fixed per individual 
beneficiary. See more information in appendices 2 and 11. 
IPs and PMU will facilitate linkages with Chambers of Commerce to identify willing BDS 
107.
(registered at the Chamber of Commerce) who will be selected by the applicant on the basis of a 
written offer. The PMU (Agribusiness unit) will reimburse BDS once the business development plan is 
submitted to the applicant and based on an invoice that will not exceed 10% of the total proposal 
amount.

change impacts, this component will strengthen their capacities in absorbing climate risk through its 
anticipation, adoption of new practices through access to knowledge, and transformation of livelihood 
strategies supported by facilitating public services. This component will support the upscaling in all 
governorates of the West Bank of climate resilient land development practices implemented in 
subcomponent 1.2 and proven to maximize adaptation benefits as evidenced by the monitoring and

systematic documentation and learning system in subcomponent 1.1. The component will strengthen 
public information and extension services to facilitate the upscaling and support Palestinian farmers in 
taking timely and effective action to protect their crops and animals from increasing rainwater 
variability and water scarcity, extreme weather and climatic conditions, and changing pressures from 
pests and diseases.  
  To overcome current critical challenges in Palestine for a transformative change in dealing with 
109.
climate change impacts on agriculture, this project component aims to i) promote public services that 
enable farmers to take timely and risk-informed actions, ii) consolidate capacities of the MoA, EQA, 
Meteorology Department (PMD) and other related actors for provision of quality public service, 
continuous documentation and learning and programming on climate change adaptation and 
mitigation in agriculture. In support of the project subcomponent 1.2, this component will develop 
capacities required in MoA to guide climate adaptation in farm-level interventions for land 
development. The component 3 will upscale good adaptation practices and approaches through the 
incorporation in national programming and decision-making using the evidence created in 
subcomponent 1.1 of the resilience benefits of different land development approaches and practices. 
The project will build on and reinforce existing initiatives and capacities (such as the MoA component 
of the Climate Change Capacity Development Program Phase I) and addresses critical gaps for 
upscaling (such as institutional bottlenecks and scattered expertise to implement national climate 
adaptation goals).  
  The outcome of this component will be: i) number of farmers using advanced agro-climate 
110.
information and extension services for farming decision making; ii) number of national plans and other 
initiatives in agriculture mainstreaming climate resilient approaches and goals. 
  Subcomponent 3.1. Improving agro-climate information and extension services to 
111.
farmers. The objective of this subcomponent is to enable the generation of practical and timely agro-
meteorological information to support farmers in taking decisions on agricultural practices and 
measures to reduce and mitigate negative impacts of weather extremes and increasing water stress 
on crops and livestock. Activities under this sub-component will include:  
  Activity 3.1.1: Improving agrometeorological observations network covering the main agro-
112.
ecological zones in the West Bank. In the first project year capacity assessments and feasibility 
studies will be updated to specify the design of the upgrading of the current meteorological station 
network to an agro-meteorological observations network and instruments needed (extra sensors for 
measuring atmospheric and soil environment parameters (e.g. soil moisture and temperature) 
according to specifications) will be procured. The current meteorological network consists in 14 
stations and 114 very simply ad less reliable rain gates in the West Bank and during the design it was 
estimated that 12 of the 14 stations should be upgraded to agro-meteorological stations. The 
Palestine Meteorological Department (PMD) has with technical support from GIZ recently established 
a database and website that automatically shows updated weather data 24 hours a day. Likewise they 
have in collaboration with the PWA established an interface between the PMD server and database 
and a PWA server and database, that allows PWA instant access to weather data and analysed water 
parameters important for the delivery of PWA’s domestic water services and strategic planning and 
modelling. This activity would support a similar interface between PMD and MoA including detailed 
design and establishment of a Climate Database Management System for archiving, storing, 
processing and analysing agro-climatic data. This will allow MoA to provide actionable information to 
farmers and strengthen their strategic planning and modelling for agricultural water and extension 
services to farmers on climate impacts on different farming systems and adaptation options. On- the-
job coaching on the functioning of the Climate Database Management System, agro-met instruments, 
day-to-day maintenance and calibration checks will also be provided 
  Activity 3.1.2. Development of Agro-climate information bulletins and recommendations for 
113.
early actions. An assessment of existing information and communication technology in PMD and MoA 
will be conducted as well as an end-user needs survey to specify the use of possible Information and 
Communications Technology (ICT) and communication strategy for agro-climate information bulletins. 
94 
Palestine 
Resilient Land & Resource Management Project 
Final project design report 
Appendix 4:  Detailed project description 
Communication equipment (e.g. generator, computers, communication devices, high-speed internet 
facilities, data collection, storage and analysis systems and software and modem - specification to be 
further clarified in detailed project design) will be procured. A training package for MoA will be deliverd 
in developing agro-climate bulletins, using the water balance concept to assess irrigation water 
requirement and flood risk, the use of climate information for preparation of strategies and plans and 
the use of climate forecast information for identifying farm-level climate resilient agriculture practices. 
Agro-climate information bulletins including forecast products (to be issued ideally on a 10 daily but at 
least monthly basis) will be designed using the identified most effective means of communication in 
the end-user survey. National, governorate and local level consultations will be facilitated to agree on 
detailed roles and responsibilities of all actors involved in the development and issuing of agro-climate 
information and define standard operating procedures (SOPs) for their communication flow and 
dissemination to village councils and farmers. Finally, the issuing of the bulletins will be tested and a 
feedback sample survey will be conducted to validate or adjust the format of the bulletins.  
  Activity 3.1.3. Modelling climate change impact on main farming systems. Data gaps will be 
114.
assessed on climate data and agriculture production and available historical data sets will be 
digitalized and consolidated. A server to run climate change impact models for agriculture crops will 
be procured. Trainings will be provided to MoA staff on climatology, agro-meteorology, spatial 
information products, information technology and database management, crop yield forecasting, and 
crop impact modelling. The databases of PMD will be harmonized and linked with agriculture 
production data and agro-meteorological monitoring by MoA and high spatial-resolution climate 
projections, crop yields and water resources projections at subnational level will be produced. These 
projections will be applied to develop a model for future climate change impacts on key crops, and 
farming systems and map the related vulnerabilities of groups of farming households under various 
climate change scenarios. In the modelling on projecting impacts the activity will build on current 
regional processes on downscaling of climate models. Finally, upscaling potentials of different 
adaptation practices and under climate change scenarios will be modelled using results from 
demonstrations of climate resilient agriculture practices under component 1 and other field data 
available..  
  Activity 3.1.4. Training of a pool of trainers for upscaling the adoption of climate resilient 
115.
practices in agriculture. Exiting technical guidelines and handbooks will be reviewed, improved and 
update as needed with validated climate resilient agriculture practices building on the evidence on 
adaptation benefits of different land development practices documented in subcomponent 1.1 and the 
climate impact modelling. A training curricula and manuals will be developed for the Climate Change 
Unit at MoA, focal points at governorate level, extension staff and national NGO partners. In addition a 
toolbox will be developed and managed on extension material with technical guidelines, videos, e-
learning material, studies and other didactic self-learning material for Palestinian farmers. A series of 
training of trainers will be provided to significantly strengthen field capacities to guide farmers in the 
adoption of climate resilient agriculture practices. Training topics will include priorities area for MoA as 
identified in the Climate Change Capacity Development Programme Phase I on e.g. adaptation cost 
assessment, climate change economic/cost-benefit analysis, community-based climate change 
adaptation, awareness raising, climate resilient and low-carbon agriculture. Trainings provided under 
this activity will strengthen capacities of MoA to provide support to farmers under component one as 
well as provide support for the further upscaling to other non RELAP beneficiary smallholder farmers 
in the wider area of the West Bank.  
  Sub-component 3.2: Strengthening institutional and technical capacities for the 
116.
implementation of agriculture adaptation goals in the National Determined Contributions 
(NDC). The objective of this sub-component is to facilitate the implementation of the “Action Plan for 
improving the Institutional Framework for Climate Change in Palestine” (ref. to National Climate 
Change Capacity Development Programme) and achieve the NDC adaptation goals for the 
agricultural sector . The subcomponent will support the horizontal and vertical institutionalization of 
climate change adaptation in agriculture, including efficient mechanisms for the operationalization, 
95

partnerships and progress monitoring of national goals. Under this sub-component the project 
foresees the following activities:  
  Activity 3.2.1. Raise awareness and plan with Agriculture institutions at national and 
117.
decentralized level how to integrate climate change actions in their operations. Awareness raising 
events will be conducted at governorate level on existing national policy frameworks for climate 
change adaptation in agriculture. Linked to this awareness raising a consultative dialogue will be 
facilitated at governorate level to identify strengths (what is in place), needs (what should be in place) 
and priorities (options how to meet the needs) for implementing national goals on addressing climate 
change in the agriculture sector at the local level. A series of planning sessions will be facilitated at 
national level and in all governorates in the West Bank to develop efficient working/operational 
procedures for MoA on climate change adaptation and related areas such as disaster risk reduction 
and natural resources management for increased resilience. This will include to define clear and 
feasible responsibilities for decentralizing and integrating climate change adaptation into annual 
planning, budgets and programmes, monitoring and evaluation at national and governorate level.  
  Activity 3.2.2. Programme for upscaling for climate change adaptation. Data on validated 
118.
agriculture practices for climate change adaptation and resilience building in support of the NDC 
implementation will be compiled and analysed starting with the evidence and knowledge products 
produced under subcomponent 1.1. Potential aggregated benefits and impact of climate resilient 
agriculture practices will be modelled to inform investments planning and barriers for public and 
private investment in climate resilient agriculture production systems will be identified. This will be 
used as inputs for facilitating a consultative process and design of a programme/plan for upscaling 
validated climate change adaptation practices involving public and private stakeholders in agriculture. 
  Activity 3.2.3. Establishing national and international partnerships and initiatives on climate 
119.
change with the participation of Palestinian agriculture stakeholders. National and international 
partnerships and initiatives on climate change in agriculture relevant for Palestine will be identified 
and prioritized. MoA and EQA will be assisted in the active participation in international knowledge 
and technology conference/workshops/events/platforms and the establishment of MoUs with national 
and internationals academic institutes and think tanks to promote applied research and information 
exchange. Support will also be provided for South-South cooperation and organization of study visits 
for governorate and extension staff of MoA to other countries implementing climate resilient 
agriculture and the Climate Change Unit on agro-climatology information, NDC implementation, NAPs 
etc.

retention gabion and stone walls implemented under the MOA is about USD USD 625 for rangeland 
rehabilitation and USD 875 for wadis development respectively. The cost per dunum for introducing 
crop-livestock CA system in cereal (wheat, barley) livestock systems is estimated about USD 190. It is 
estimated that some additional 8 000 dunum will benefit from these activities with an average 
investment cost of less than USD 500 per dunum.

Resilient Land & Resource Management Project 
Final project design report 
Appendix 5:

Institutional aspects and implementation 
This section describes the project approach and its organization framework, including the 
1.
governance of the project and the role/responsibilities of the main implementing partners. 
Approach 
A key ambition is to promote institutional development among the core partners. The RELAP 
2.
will contribute to institutional development and outcomes in several ways, including: 1) further 
evolution of the Project Management Unit (PMU) in the MoA, which will have overall responsibility for 
implementing RELAP (see below); 2) promotion of adaptive and inclusive land development practices 
3) development and establishment of institutionalised support and advisory services for the promotion 
of the rural poor’s market integration, bulking and clustering; 3) capacity development of participating 
MoA and other stakeholders in utilising climate information; and 4) support to and expansion of public-
private-NGO partnerships (PPNP) in climate adaptive infrastructure. 
Organizational framework 
The Ministry of Finance and Planning (MoFP) will be the recipient representative, responsible 
3.
for the negotiation and signature of the financing agreement (FA) with IFAD, the management of 
donor funds and government contribution (including tax exemption), and the reporting to IFAD, in 
particular the submission of annual audited financial statements. 
The MoA will be the Lead Agency, responsible for the RELAP implementation, through direct 
4.
and regular consultation with the EQA. The general directorate of the agricultural land/MoA will be 
responsible for ensuring that all aspects of implementation are carried out in accordance with the 
project FA and agreed annual work plans and budgets (AWPB). 
A project steering committee (PSC) will be established at national level to: i) provide policy 
5.
guidance and strategic directions, ii) ensure alignment/complementarity of RELAP with projects 
financed by other donors in the West Bank, and iii) approve the project AWPB. The PSC will be 
established by a PA decree and will be chaired by the MoA (by the Minister or the Deputy Minister). 
The PSC members will include: i) All MoA General Directors involved in RELAP implementation or 
monitoring, ii) the Minister’s Advisor for climate change and national focal point for UNFCCC and 
IPCC/EQA, iii) Representatives of the Ministry of Social Affairs, the Ministry of Women Affairs, the 
MoFP, and NARC/MoA, as well as iv) ad-hoc technical resource persons (representing e.g. NGOs) to 
be invited by the MoA as and when needed. The PSC will meet at least once a year to approve the 
AWPBs and to take stock of their implementation in the middle of each year. The project director will 
be the Secretary of the PSC, responsible for preparing the minutes of the PSC meetings.  
A PMU will be established in Ramallah and will be responsible for overseeing implementation of 
6.
the RELAP, in coordination with its implementing partners and service providers (mainly FAO, NGOs 
and private contractors). The PMU will produce the AWPBs and the associated PPs to be submitted to 
the PSC for review and approval, and subsequently to IFAD for no objection. Likewise, the PMU will 
take the lead in the procurement of civil works for sub-component 1.3 and for contracting partner 
NGOs under components 1 and 2. The PMU will be integrated into the MoA and will be led by the 
general directorate of agricultural Land, and will be vested with financial and technical autonomy. Its 
staffing, as well as time allocation for the seconded staff, have been discussed and agreed upon with 
the MoA, based on a careful assessment of activities to be carried out (especially regarding 
supervision of the NGOs’ work and coordination required with trade and marketing 
projects/programmes of other donors). The proposed staffing (presented in the table below) has been 
agreed with MoA. When not seconded, the staff in question will be recruited externally.

The draft TOR of the PMU staff are prepared and presented in annex 1 of this appendix. Below 
7.
are the component specific implementation details. 
Component 1: Climate resilient land development 
The overall implementation coordination of the adaptive land development component will be 
8.
under the responsibility of the PMU to be established under the MoA. For subcomponent 1.1, the 
PMU will assume overall responsibility and supervision of activities, will define scope of collaboration 
with NARC, and will recruit the partner NGO who will design (with NARC support) and train MoA staff 
in implementing the monitoring and testing programme. The actual field implementation of activities 
for land development for orchards under the sub-component 1.2 will be the responsibility of NGOs to 
be selected on a competitive basis, while the PMU will be responsible for implementation of activities 
related to wadis land reclamation, conservation agriculture in crop-livestock systems, and rangeland 
rehabilitation contracting technical assistance from NGOs and individual experts as needed. The PMU 
will also be responsible for implementation of the sub-component 1.3. The table below provides an 
overview of the roles and responsibilities:

selection criteria and scoring procedure for ranking of investment proposals are also provided in 
appendix 11. All the proposals for land development and agricultural road investment funding award 
will be approved by the PSC. The PMU will review recommendations of NGOs related to land 
development proposals and develop consolidated recommendations including agricultural roads 
applications and provide recommendation to the PSC for funding award. To ensure competitiveness 
the PSC meetings will be held once a year (preferably at the end of the year), to review and approve 
proposals for the next year funding award. The number of investments proposals for each year will

Appendix 5: 
Institutional aspects and implementation arrangements 
PMU main tasks, selection of participating NGOs, arrangements for operation and maintenance are 
outlined in the PIM. 
  Besides the general activities related to conducting information campaign, component M&E and 
10.
progress reporting, the tasks of the PMU will be:  
  For the sub-component 1.2: i) preliminary screening and selection of villages/municipalities of 
11.
received proposals for investments; ii) final approval of investment proposals; (iii) selection and 
supervision of participating NGOs. The staff involved in sub-component 1.2 will consist of a Land 
Development Engineer, and a Water Management and Irrigation Engineer from the relevant 
departments of the MoA. Estimated involvement of aforementioned MoA staff in the component 
activities will be some 30% of their working time. Draft Terms of References are provided in the annex 
1.  
  For the sub-component 1.3: i) selection of proposals for agricultural roads investment; ii) review 
12.
and approval of designs provided by the selected villages/municipalities; iii) procurement of works for 
roads investment; and iv) supervision of works through private sector consultant to be selected on a 
competitive basis. The staff involved in sub-component 1.3 will consist of an Agricultural Road 
Engineer from the MoA with estimated involvement in the component activities of 80% of working 
time. Draft Terms of References are provided in the annex 1. 
13.
  The main tasks of the participating NGOs will be: i) following the preliminary screening of 
investment proposals (selection of villages and municipalities) by the PMU to conduct field visit 
verification and qualification of the proposals; ii) baseline data collection, feasibility study and ranking 
of qualified proposals and providing to PMU the list of selected proposals for final approval; iii) 
following the approval by PMU proceed with agreement signing with selected municipalities/villages 
and farmers; iv) development of detailed designs and engineering estimates for selected investment 
proposals; (v) procurement and supervision of civil works; and vi) provide technical assistance to 
beneficiary farmers in agricultural and irrigation practice, and legal assistance in obtaining of land 
titles as it would be required. More details on selection of participating NGOs are outlined in the PIM. 
  All the proposals for land development and agricultural road investment funding award will be 
14.
approved by the PSC. The PMU will review recommendations of NGOs related to land development 
proposals and develop consolidated recommendations including agricultural roads applications and 
provide recommendation to the PSC for funding award. To ensure competitiveness the PSC meetings 
will be held once a year (preferably at the end of the year), to review and approve proposals for the 
next year funding award. The number of investments proposals for each year will depend on the size 
of each investment and budget allocation for particular year. 
15.
  Details can be found in the draft PIM (appendix 11). 
Component 2: Market linkages for the rural poor 
  The overall implementation of component 2 will be under the responsibility of the PMU. An 
16.
agribusiness expert will be recruited from the market to join PMU. S/he will be also supported by a 
marketing officer from the Directorate of agricultural marketing who is to be part-time seconded (30%) 
in the PMU. Terms of reference are enclosed in annex 1.  
  Subcomponent 2.1. Rural bulking of agricultural products. The main implementers will be

Linkages with MRPs and other platforms/forums/commodity councils will be facilitated by the 
19.
PMU extension and marketing officers, in coordination with district officers, and municipality and 
village councils. Collaboration will be done with projects and programmes specifically focusing on 
marketing (mentioned earlier). Especially, FAO being a partner of most of the ongoing marketing 
initiatives, the PMU will coordinate with FAO, who also implement RELAP component 3, on a regular 
basis to identify fields of collaboration and synergies.  
  Subcomponent 2.2. Inclusive entrepreneurship development support. The main 
20.
implementer will be the PMU. Other implementation partners will include: Village municipality councils,

(Chambers of commerce certified)  
  The microenterprise facility will be administered by the PMU, and grants will be awarded by a 
21.
MoA chaired “inclusive entrepreneurship committee” (details to be provided in the PIM). 
  Applications (shared with the MRP for increased accountability) will be channelled to the PMU 
22.
through the municipality and village councils and municipalities that will confirm applicant's’ 
compliance with eligibility criteria. The PMU will then confirm the feasibility as well as eligibility, and 
grants awarding will be decided upon by an independent committee (comprising of MoA, the PMU 
marketing officer, Ministry of Social Affairs and EQA) that initially meets on a regular basis109. The 
micro-enterprise facility will involve municipality and village councils and municipalities at the targeting 
stage to reach out to vulnerable and landless people, while the award committee will be based at the 
MoA. The eligibility criteria for the investment grants (maximum of USD 5 000) will be: 
a. 
Only micro-enterprises owned by women or youth (below 30 years) will be eligible. These could 
include individual projects (especially those requiring investments on a lower scale) and 
group/collective projects (managed by cooperatives or youth clubs). Formal business 
registration will not be a requirement, but the micro-enterprises should be recognized by the 
municipality and village council. In all cases, the applicant must demonstrate that the key 
ownership and decision making is under the control of a woman/youth.  
b. 
All applicants should demonstrate the ability to contribute to the investment with a minimum of 
15% in cash (to be used as investment or working capital). 
  The award of the grants will be decided based on criteria to be developed in the project 
23.
implementation manual (and in consultation with the MoA and local stakeholders). These will include, 
among others: potential for job creation, agricultural production, and introduction of climate adaptive 
technologies. 
109   While the comparable Palestinian Market Development Program (PMDP) awards grants (to larger businesses) on a weekly 
basis, such a frequency for RELAP would be too cumbersome and the available amount for investment grant would not be 
sufficient.

Appendix 6:  Planning, M&E and learning and knowledge 
management 
The PMU shall establish and operate a functioning M&E system in order to ensure the proper 
1.
management of project implementation and to measure results. To this end, the project Logframe 
shall serve as the key reference document (table 33 below), together with the underlying theory of 
change summarized at the end of this appendix. 
Planning 
2.
Towards the end of each fiscal year, the PMU will prepare a results-oriented annual work plan 
and budget (AWPB) for the next fiscal year that will clearly identify, for each component, the following 
(see appendix 11 for suggested AWPB template):  
 
 
 
 
 
the detailed outputs to be produced, together with related physical targets; 
the key activities, sub-activities and inputs required in order to deliver planned outputs; 
the timetable for implementation of key activities; 
the PMU staff or implementers responsible for each activity and sub-activity; 
the financial resources required for implementing planned activities and acquiring inputs. 
The key reference for the preparation of the AWPBs will be the detailed project log-frame 
3.
attached in annex 1 (which quantifies the detailed results to be achieved by the project completion 
date); the detailed description of project activities found in the project design document; the cost 
tables (which provide an indicative project budget broken down by years and activities); while the 
detailed recommendations of the latest supervision mission will also be given due consideration. The 
PDR and cost tables shall not, however, constitute a rigid blueprint110, and the original log-frame 
targets and financial envelopes may need to be revised at mid-term, upon the recommendations of 
the mid-term review111 and IFAD’s approval. 
4.
If the first AWPB will be prepared during the start-up workshop, the preparation of subsequent 
AWPBs shall follow an iterative process, starting around the month of September each year with the 
consultation of concerned NGO and municipality staff, local MoA staff and other implementers. 
Facilitated by the PMU, these consultation workshops will provide project implementers and local 
stakeholders with the opportunity to reflect on past performance, discuss implementation issues and 
identify preliminary annual targets for component 1, 2 and 3.  
On this basis, a consolidated AWPB will be prepared by the PMU and submitted to the PSC for 
5.
approval. After approval by the PSC, the tentative AWPB (accompanied by the procurement plan) 
shall be submitted to IFAD for no-objection no later than 60 days before the end of the fiscal year (i.e. 
by 31st October each year). In case IFAD would want to introduce some changes to the AWPB initially 
submitted, the PMU shall inform the PSC about such changes112.  
The final, approved AWPB will constitute a binding document that will govern, throughout the 
6.
year, IFAD’s decisions related to funds’ release or procurement matters. The approved AWPB and 
Procurement Plan may be amended in the course of the year at the request of the PMU if proper 
justification is provided for proposed changes, and upon IFAD’s no-objection. 
110   Cost tables should be considered as the best estimates by project designers, at the time of project design, of the various 
expenditures that will be required in order to deliver certain goods and services and achieve certain results. As 
implementation progresses, these expenditure estimates tend to become increasingly outdated, in particular unit costs, and 
some planned activities may need to be changed or new ones added. 
111   In case of significant design problems, IFAD and the government may decide to organize an anticipated mid-term review. 
112  PSC approval may also be sought and granted as a final step, after IFAD’s no objection is granted. This also means that, in 
the event when the PSC would recommend changes to the AWPB, IFAD’s no objection on revised AWPB will have to be 
sought again,

Monitoring and Evaluation 
7.
Purpose and scope. The PMU M&E officer will be responsible to establish a M&E system the 
main purpose of which will be to provide project management, the government and IFAD with reliable 
and timely information on project execution performance and results, so that corrective actions may 
be taken on a timely basis to ensure that implementation remains both efficient (i.e. results are 
obtained at reasonable costs) and effective (i.e. expected goods and services are delivered and 
intended outcomes are achieved).  
8.
 
 
 
More precisely, the M&E system established and managed by the PMU M&E Officer will aim at:  
Monitoring  project  execution:  M&E  activities  will  track  project  activities  and  outputs  against 
planned, physical targets (as identified in the AWPB), and monitor of the quality of the products 
and services being delivered. In so doing, M&E activities  will help monitor the rate of physical 
targets  and  verify  compliance  by  all  implementers  with  agreed  calendars,  deadlines  and 
contractual requirements. The monitoring of project execution will also help inform all log-frame 
output  indicators,  including  1st  level  RIMS  indicators  and  MoA  Agriculture  Sector  Strategy’s 
output indicators. 
Monitoring  outreach:  M&E  activities  will  play  a  critical  role  in:  (i)  ensuring  that  the  right  target 
groups  are  being  reached  through  effective  targeting  mechanisms  (i.e.  ensuring  that  primary 
beneficiaries  are  smallholders,  poor/landless  female  and  young  micro-entrepreneurs  and  that 
there is no leakage of project benefits); (ii) keeping track of the number of households who are 
receiving project goods and services; and (iii) documenting their profiles at the time of selection. 
Outreach  data  shall  be  disaggregated  by  gender  and  age  categories  (“below  30  years”  and 
“above 30 years”). 
Measuring  and  evaluating  project  results:  Through  periodic  surveys  and  other  tools,  M&E 
activities  will  help  measure  the  effects  and  early  impact  of  project  activities  on  beneficiaries, 
assess their satisfaction with project services and ensure that project implementation does not 
have  unexpected,  negative  consequences.  In  so  doing,  the  M&E  system  shall  help  inform  all 
log-frame  outcome  and  impact  indicators,  including  RIMS  2nd  level  indicators  and  MoA 
Agriculture Sector Strategy’s outcome indicators. 
The key reference for the setting-up of the M&E system will be the detailed logframe presented 
9.
in annex 1 of this appendix, which includes the detailed list of output, outcome and impact indicators 
that will need to be tracked and monitored for the efficient monitoring of implementation progress and 
results. The shorter logframe included in the PDR, on the other hand, will serve as a key reference 
during IFAD supervision missions and will be basis for annual reporting to IFAD. The M&E system 
shall also be developed considering the reporting requirements of the Green Climate Fund, including 
for the monitoring of resilience and the reporting requirements of the MoA M&E Department.  
10.
  Given that the detailed project log-frame found in annex 1 includes all relevant indicators from 
the Agriculture Sector Strategy 2017-2022, on the one hand, and all relevant IFAD RIMS indicators 
on the other, the M&E system will help fulfil the results’ information requirements of both institutions.  
  The detailed M&E tools, processes and responsibilities, as well as data requirements, will be 
11.
described in the M&E Manual (or part II of the project implementation manual), to be finalized by the 
M&E officer within 3 months of project start (see appendix 11 for the M&E manual outline). To ensure 
quality and timeliness of data collection processes, and addition to the organization of M&E training 
workshops, the PMU M&E officer will also provide periodic technical backstopping to field-level 
implementers and other M&E actors. 
  Tools and processes. Monitoring of project execution and outreach. Under all components, 
12.
the primary responsibility for collecting the data required for the monitoring of project execution 
(activities and outputs) and outreach (number and profile of beneficiaries reached), will be vested with 
each project implementer (NGOs, local MoA staff and FAO). Such responsibilities shall be clearly 
outlined in their respective contracts or ToR, together with clear information on reporting requirements 
and the frequency of data submission. These contracts shall also clearly mention that the key 
118

Resilient Land & Resource Management Project 
Final project design report 
Appendix 6:  Planning, M&E and learning and knowledge management 
reference for evaluating implementing partners’ annual performance will be the AWPB prepared every 
year by the PMU, as approved by the PSC and IFAD.  
13.
  Standard data collection forms and reporting templates will be the key tools used by project 
implementers for data collection and submission. All standard data collection forms and reporting 
templates will be described (and annexed) in the M&E manual; while relevant data collection forms 
and reporting templates will also be annexed to the project implementers’ contracts or ToR. The 
original completed forms will be archived at the implementers’ offices so that they may be consulted 
by the PMU or IFAD for data verification purposes 
  Once a month, or at agreed-upon intervals, the primary data collected using handwritten 
14.
completed forms will be compiled and consolidated by the respective implementers, and consolidated 
data will be sent electronically to the M&E Officer through monthly activity reports. These standard 
reports will present the list of activities undertaken as per the AWPB, together with consolidated 
outreach tables, while supporting evidence will be attached (e.g. copies of signed list of training 
participants).  
  For transparency purposes, all key outputs (rehabilitated land holdings, roads, market 
15.
infrastructure) and capacity building support provided under each component shall be geo-referenced 
and mapped digitally, using a simple GIS technology. The need for GIS tracking of key interventions 
will be stipulated in IP’s contracts, while the M&E officer will centralize these data at the PMU level.  
  The M&E Officer will use a central, Excel-based database to record and manage all the data 
16.
necessary to monitor project execution and outreach. Using the implementers’ monthly activity 
reports, this central database will be updated every month for the periodic preparation of consolidated 
tables comparing physical achievements with planned targets (see appendix 11 for the suggesting 
template for the monitoring of project execution). The digital maps showing all project sites and 
interventions will be updated every three months, also using GIS information sent by project 
implementers. 
In addition to the above tools, and under component 1.3, the roads feasibility studies will 
17.
represent an additional, useful tool to collect outreach data (such as the number of landholdings 
served by the rehabilitated or newly constructed road, or the expected number of road users). 
Similarly, the application forms used under component 1.2 and 2.3 will be developed in such a way 
that they include important baseline information on selected beneficiaries’ profile (age, sex, main 
occupation, annual income, poverty status, etc.). 
In order to verify, randomly, the data submitted by the various actors and monitor the quality of 
18.
delivered outputs, the M&E officer will participate in monthly field visits, alone or jointly with other PMU 
staff or project implementers. Such field visits shall also provide an opportunity to interact with 
beneficiaries, assess their satisfaction with services received or document stories from the field (i.e. 
for the preparation of knowledge material). 
  Measurement and evaluation of project results: Using comprehensive baseline data of the 
19.
socio-economic situation of project beneficiaries prior to their participation in project activities, the 
measurement of project results (outcomes and impact) will seek to quantity the changes in the 
resilience113 and incomes of direct beneficiaries, as well as the changes in land productivity, 
agricultural production and marketing opportunities that can be directly attributable to project 
interventions. For women and the youth, an additional focus will be on measuring changes in their 
social status or sense of empowerment. With the objective of measuring the socio-economic situation 
of project beneficiaries before and after project interventions, the following tools will be used:  
 
Baseline  surveys:  Upon  selection  of  project  villages  and  in  each  of  these  villages,  project 
implementers  will  conduct  baseline  surveys  in  order  to  collect:  (i)  key  data,  from  secondary

sources (municipal offices, local MoA offices) on the general characteristics of the population114 
in  these  villages,  as  well  as  key  agriculture  and  livestock  production  data115;  (ii)  key  primary 
data from a sample of 50 households involved in agriculture and livestock production in these 
villages116. 
For component 2.1, the village-level baseline information thus collected will not only be used 
as a reference against which project results and impact will be measured, it will also help plan 
detailed project interventions based on documented marketing constraints and opportunities. 
Other  important  baseline  data  on  the  specific  socio-economic  characteristics  of  actual 
beneficiary households prior to their participation in project activities will be collected upon the 
final selection of each beneficiary (partly using the data contain in their application forms, partly 
through  a  quick  interview  conducted  by  NGO  staff,  using  a  standard  questionnaire).  The 
baseline data thus collected outside of the baseline surveys mentioned above will concern the 
entire  universe  of  component  1.2,  1.3  and  2.1  direct  beneficiaries.  They  will  be  used  as  a 
reference against which results and impact will be measured at mid-term and completion. 
Under  component  1.1.  a  specific  M&E  system  will  be  established  with  the  support  from  a 
partner  NGO,  in  collaboration  with  the  PMU  and  the  National  Agricultural  Research  Center 
(NARC), in order to measure in a scientific way adaptation benefits, stability and level of yields, 
improvements  in  soil  quality,  as  well  as  any  other  pertinent  aspects,  among  selected 
households practicing climate resilient  land development and management. The partner NGO 
will  also  be  expected  to  build  an  IT  platform  for  systematic  data  management  and  analysis. 
Towards  mid-term  and  completion,  the  results  will  be  used  for  the  preparation  of  knowledge 
products  which  will  then  be  disseminated  among  MoA  staff,  policy  makers  and  other 
stakeholders in order to inform the dialogue on land development policies and practices. 
Monitoring  of  changes  in  beneficiary  household  resilience  is  a  particular  feature  of  the 
monitoring  of  the  impact  of  the  project  at  goal  level,  which  will  also  be  done  supported  by 
subcomponent  1.1.  Monitoring  of  household  resilience  is  complex  because  of  its  multi  factor 
characteristic. For the measurement of household resilience a resilience scorecard will be used 
inspired  by  the  DFID  KPI4  Methodology117.  This  methodology  has  a  pragmatic  approach  to 
address  the  multifactor  complexity.  It  only  focuses  at  monitoring  the  risk  and  vulnerability 
aspects  the  project  seeks  to  address  or  is  likely  to  influence.  It  does  not  monitor  absolute 
resilience  but  changes  in  resilience  of  the  beneficiaries  compared  to  the  baseline.  The 
questions  proposed  to  be  included  in  the  resilience  scorecard  are  presented  in  appendix  13 
section  G.2 
the  project  supported  activities  addressing  climate  risks  and 
vulnerabilities. The draft resilience scorecard, that needs to be finalized during project start up, 
is presented in annex 2 to this appendix.

Outcome  surveys:  These  surveys  will  be  conducted  among  a  small  sample  of  actual  project 
beneficiaries (some 200 households) by local MoA and PMU staff, under the supervision of the 
M&E officer, on an annual basis starting project Year 1. They will help document beneficiaries’ 
satisfaction with project support and interventions (which will be the focus of year 1 and year 2 
surveys),  as  well  as  the  direct  outcomes  of  project  interventions  (starting  year  3).  These 
surveys will thus be the principal tool to help inform IFAD RIMS 2nd level indicators, while they 
will be a useful basis for informed project management decisions. 
Farmers’  and  entrepreneurs’  records:  Beneficiary  farmers  and  small  entrepreneurs  will  be 
requested to keep records of key data related to production, expenditures, sales and net profit, 
using  standard  templates.  The  primary  objective  will  be  to  help  beneficiaries  develop  a  more

business-oriented  mindset,  so  that  they  can  make  informed  investment  decisions  based  on  a 
good understanding of  what are the most profitable  activities.  Also, as  this information  will be 
collected  on a sample basis and  analyzed at mid-term and completion,  it  will  be an important 
source of information to measure project impact on beneficiaries’  incomes and triangulate the 
findings of the mid-term and completion surveys. Furthermore, this information will also be used 
during supervision missions by IFAD consultants in order to assess the profitability of supported 
income-generating activities. 
Gender  studies:  Qualitative  surveys  shall  be  conducted  periodically  by  the  gender  specialist, 
with  support  from  the  M&E  specialist  and  the  MoA  gender  focal  point,  among  women  and 
young beneficiaries in order to identify any possible factors that may hinder their participation in 
project  activities;  and,  at  a  later  stage,  to  document  any  positive  intra-household  changes  in 
power  relations  or  gender  roles  and  project  impact  on  their  level  of  economic  and  social 
empowerment.  
Mid-term and a completion surveys: These surveys will be outsourced to a competent service 
provider  and  conducted  under  the  overall  guidance  of  the  M&E  officer.  Using  a  before/after 
evaluation  design,  they  will  be  conducted  among  a  representative  sample  of  project 
beneficiaries  prior  to  the  mid-term  and  completion  reviews,  and  will  document  changes  in 
beneficiaries’  socio-economic  situation,  as  compared  to  baseline  data,  allowing  for  the 
measurement and quantification of project impact. To this end, the questionnaire used for both 
surveys should be consistent with available baseline information. 
 
 
Ideally, a quasi-experimental evaluation of project impact would require a counterfactual, with 
20.
the implication that the mid-term and completion surveys should include a control group in an attempt 
to compare the with/without interventions situation. Further, a robust control group would include 
households from the same localities who share the same socio-economic characteristics as the 
beneficiary households, who would have been eligible to benefit from project interventions and would 
have been genuinely interested and able to participate in project activities. Therefore, the best control 
group would be composed of households who applied for project support and who were found eligible, 
but who could not be selected because of budget constraints. The PMU will reflect on the extent to 
which using these households to create a reliable control group is ethical, and on this basis, may 
proceed with the inclusion of such a control group in the design of the mid-term and completion 
survey. Worthwhile noting, at the time of RELAP design, IFAD’s policy is to require quasi-experimental 
evaluation designs for only 15% of its portfolio, while all other projects are no longer required to 
measure impact through baseline and impact surveys. 
21.
  Data requirements. To properly monitor project execution and outreach, on the one hand, and 
be in a position to measure and evaluate project outcomes and impact, on the other, the tables below

  Reporting. Based on the monthly activity reports and annual progress reports prepared by 
project implementers, on the one hand, and on the activity reports prepared by selected PMU staff, on 
the other, the M&E Officer will prepare the following reports: 
 
 
 
Quarterly progress reports: Two quarterly progress reports will be prepared each year to 
describe progress and achievements against the quarterly targets defined in the AWPB, and 
identify shortcomings. The report will be mainly for internal management purposes and will not 
need to be shared with IFAD (English translation will not be required). 
6-monthly progress reports: The report will be prepared using the template in appendix 11 to 
describe progress and achievements, or lack thereof, against 6-monthly targets. The detailed 
physical and financial achievements will be summarized in a table (See appendix 11 for 
template). Key implementation issues will be highlighted, together with recommended actions. 
The report is mandatory and will be sent to IFAD (in English) for information. 
Annual progress reports: The report will be prepared using the annotated template provided 
in appendix 11. In addition to the sections covered in the 6-monthly progress report, the annual 
report will provide a detailed overview of project and implementation partners’ performance with 
regard to M&E, targeting, gender mainstreaming, outreach, sustainability, etc. The report is 
mandatory and will be sent to IFAD (in English) and the PSC for information. 
23.
IFAD has established a corporate results’ monitoring system, the “Results and Impact 
Management System” (RIMS), which consists of the systematic tracking, for its entire portfolio of 
projects, of annual achievements against a set of standard output indicators (called “level 1” 
indicators), outcome indicators (called “level 2” indicators) and outreach indicators. Annual reporting is 
mandatory for all IFAD-funded projects. For each relevant RIMS indicator, annual reporting to IFAD 
will consist in the reporting of output-level achievements against planned, annual targets (as identified 
in the AWPB); and in the reporting of cumulative achievements to date compared with global targets 
(as identified in the project Log-frame). RIMS data will be reported by IFAD supervision missions, 
based on the information provided by the M&E Officer. In preparation of these missions, the M&E 
Officer will prepare a consolidated table showing annual progress and cumulative progress to date in 
relation with all Log-frame output targets.

Final project design report 
Appendix 6:  Planning, M&E and learning and knowledge management 
  Towards the end of the third year of implementation a MTR will be jointly organized by the 
24.
government and IFAD to assess project management performance, implementation status, outreach 
and targeting, as well as progress towards the achievement of the project development objectives. 
The MTR will also focus on corrective actions in order to address performance gaps and other issues. 
  Towards the end of the project completion period, ideally before the project completion date but 
25.
no later than 3 months after project closing, a project completion review (PCR) will also be jointly 
organized by the government and IFAD. The PCR will focus on assessing the relevance of project 
interventions, implementation effectiveness and efficiency, outreach and targeting, the likelihood of 
sustainability of project benefits and the potential for upscaling and replication. The PCR also aims at 
generating and documenting useful lessons from implementation that will help improve future 
programming or policies. Both the MTR and PCR processes shall be informed by the findings of the 
mid-term and completion surveys. 
  Responsibilities. Each implementing partner (NGOs, local MoA staff, municipality engineers) 
26.
will be responsible for collecting the necessary activity, output and outreach data for the activities 
falling under their responsibilities. Detailed data requirements will be clearly stipulated in their 
contracts, MoU or ToR. Implementing partners will also be responsible to maintain an electronic 
database to record all primary data collected (especially data on beneficiaries’ profiles). Original hard 
copies of completed data collection forms (e.g. signed lists of training participants) will be filed at the 
implementers’ offices and kept available to PMU staff for verification purposes, while copies shall be 
attached to the activity reports that will need to be submitted each month to the PMU M&E Officer. 
These monthly activity reports and annual progress reports will use a standard template and will 
include standard consolidated data tables.  
  Selected PMU staff (land development engineer, agricultural road engineer, extension officer, 
27.
irrigation engineer and a marketing officer) will also play a key role in data collection (using standard 
data collection forms and records) for all the activities that they will implement themselves (e.g. 
training, supervision visits). For the proper monitoring of works, the land development engineer, 
agricultural road engineer and irrigation engineers will also be responsible to maintain their own 
records, using the information contained in implementers’ monthly activity reports and the monitoring 
templates provided in the M&E Manual. After each field visits, they shall also prepare a mission report, 
using a standard outline, to be copied to the M&E officer; and they shall prepare each month an 
activity report to describe progress in their respective domains (to be submitted to the M&E officer).  
  The M&E officer will be overall responsible, among others, for establishing a sound M&E 
28.
system; preparing the M&E Manual and all necessary data collection and reporting templates; training 
implementers and PMU staff in the use of these form and templates; ensuring that all implementers 
submit monthly activity reports and other progress reports; developing and maintain an electronic 
database; verifying on a random basis the reliability of the information provided by implementers; 
organizing or supervising quantitative and qualitative surveys; preparing quarterly, six-monthly and 
annual progress reports; preparing and updating digital maps showing key project interventions and 
outreach.

Target groups and target area 
Purpose 
The proposed baseline survey aims at: (a) the collection of quantitative and qualitative information on 
the socio-economic conditions of potential project beneficiaries; and (b) the quantification of the initial 
baseline values for the project Logframe indicators (impact and outcome level).  
Baseline data collected will be primarily used, at mid-term and project completion, as a reference for 
the measurement of project effectiveness and impacts. They may also be used to inform the planning 
of certain project interventions, or the process of beneficiaries’ selection. 
Among others and in relation with the specific project objectives and target groups, the baseline 
survey shall provide information on the following:

General  socio-economic  situation  in  targeted  municipalities  (school  enrolment,  literacy  rate, 
access to healthcare, poverty rate, etc.). 
Households’ characteristics (number of members, age, sex). 
Ownership of, and access to productive/arable land, irrigated land, forests (ha owned, rented, 
actually utilized). 
Agricultural  production:  Key  crops  grown  by  households  (number  of  ha  grown,  average 
yield/ha) and income derived; level of production of different crops. 
Livestock production: Types and number of animals owned by households; number of animals 
sold/year; Dairy production (type, quantities produced and sold);. 
Other  sources  of  income;  Total  household  annual  income;  Total  farming  income;  Number  of 
income contributors. 
Key assets owned. 
Access to quality inputs. 
Access to agricultural extension or livestock husbandry services. 
Access to domestic water, irrigation water and water for livestock. 
Access to financial capital and credit. 
Access to roads and status of roads. 
Access to markets, traders and buyers 
Access to market information. 
Effects of climate change on livelihoods and household-level adaptation strategy. 
Key drivers of rural poverty. 
Under the various component, specific project activities will target specific groups of beneficiaries. 
Thus, component 1 will target small land owners (including 10% women) and livestock owners, 
component 2 will target small farmers and traders and female and young rural micro-entrepreneurs, 
while component 3 will target a much wider range of farmers. For each of these groups, the baseline 
survey will also seek to collect more specific information, such as the one presented in the following 
table.

Methods of data collection 
After a review of the PDR, the PIM and other relevant documents, such as the MoA sector documents 
or municipal statistics, the Service Provider shall prepare a detailed methodological note highlighting 
the sampling strategy, process and tools for data collection, including survey questionnaires and 
interview guides. The following methods shall be used: 
Households’ survey: A quantitative survey will be carried out among a representative sample of rural 
households living in the targeted municipalities. The sample shall be representative of the key 
characteristics of future project primary beneficiaries in targeted municipalities. The purpose will be to 
collect quantitative data on rural households’ livelihoods, income and socio-economic status, as well 
as on the extent of their access to essential production inputs, knowledge and markets. 
One-on-one interviews with key informants: Semi-structured, open-ended interviews will be conducted 
with key informants (village or community leaders, municipal staff) in order to gain an in-depth 
understanding on specific aspects (e.g. drivers of poverty, production and marketing constraints, 
production levels, etc.). 
Focus group discussions: In order to better comprehend the complex issue of resilience to climate 
change, semi-structured interviews will be organized with groups of producers sharing common 
characteristics (E.g. groups of livestock owners, women, youth, crop producers, fruit trees growers). 
Use of secondary data: A thorough review of available secondary data for targeted municipalities will 
be carried out in order to provide background, macro-level information on targeted municipalities 
(access to education, food security, health, agricultural production and sales). 
4) 
Sampling strategy and framework 
Ideally, the survey should be conducted among a sample of actual beneficiaries, but the process for 
their selection may not be finalized at the time of the survey. Thus, at the time of baseline survey, the 
exact list of Component 1 beneficiaries or the location of Component 2 infrastructure will not be 
known. The Consultant will suggest an appropriate sampling strategy and sample size, keeping in 
mind the estimated size of potential beneficiary households and the various characteristics of the 
targeted municipalities (e.g. in terms of poverty rate, population size or agro-ecological potential). 
IFAD usually recommends that a sample of 900 households (30 households in 30 localities) be 
followed. Depending on the extent of homogeneity of target groups’ socio-economic characteristics 
and agro-ecological potential across the targeted municipalities, the consultant will consider the need 
to apply a purposeful, stratified cluster sampling method, or if other sampling methods appear more 
appropriate.  
5)

The M&E specialist in collaboration with other PMU staff will improve and adjust the scorecard and 
validate it with participation of beneficiary Villages. The proposed questions are formulated directed to 
households who are receiving project services, which is adequate for the rolling monitoring of the 
results of the project. But for the baseline study they should be revised to fit a baseline survey 
situation where both future potential beneficiary households and control group households are 
surveyed. In other words, it is important to consider what should be the resilience scorecard for the 
baseline, midterm and final survey and what would be the resilience scorecard to monitor the 
progress in household resilience of beneficiary families as the project is rolled out.  
The scores assigned to each questions in the draft scorecard proposed above are simply 1 and 0. It 
could be considered if all questions should have equal weight. Instead of only using binary ‘yes’ or ‘no’ 
answers scores it could also be considered to use: 
a) 
b) 
Categorical scores to capture qualitative answers transformed into quantitative perception of 
resilience scored as for example ‘would not be affected’=3, ‘would be moderately affected’=2, 
and ‘would be seriously affected’=0. Question example “How well would you and your family 
cope with a drought like the one that happened in 2015 if it happened within the current/next 
cropping season – how would you be affected?” 
Continuous variables using a range to convert into a resilience score for example household 
income, yield/ha, time for recovering after a shock. Answers to for example the last question on 
time to recover after a shock are divided into ranges assigned a score: 1 month=3; 2-3 
months=2; 4-6 months=1; and >6 months=0.

arrangements 
Inherent risks: country issues, entity risks and project design 
The last public expenditure and financial accountability (PEFA) report for Palestine was 
1.
published in 2013, followed by a World Bank public expenditure review (PER) of the Palestinian 
Authority in 2016. Both the PEFA and the PER report that the PA has made substantial progress in 
improving the efficiency, accountability, and transparency of its public financial management system 
(PFM), and in strengthening its public expenditure framework. Following the 2006 election, which led 
to the separation between the West Bank and Gaza, the Palestinian PFM system was successfully re-
built, with: the relocation of the budget department in Ramallah; the establishment of the single 
treasury account and a debt management office; the implementation of BISAN as the new PA 
government integrated financial management information system (IFMIS); the reintroduction of 
monthly reporting and annual financial statements; and the development of internal and external 
audits. PEFA indicators related to comprehensiveness of budget information and transparency, control 
and audit, accounting and financial reporting are thus reported to have improved significantly. In the 
area of public expenditure, major efforts have been made to reduce the budget deficit (from 25%of 
GDP in 2007 down to 10% in 2014), to control the wage bill (through limitations in recruitment and 
salary increases) and to fund the capital investment program from domestic resources. 
2.
Yet, the PEFA report has highlighted persistent weaknesses in several areas. Further 
improvements are necessary in budget preparation and execution (hampered by the lack of cash 
planning and commitment control tools), public disclosures (of debt, budget and procurement 
information), fiscal relations between central and local governments, accounting policies/practices and 
internal controls. Furthermore, the report stresses the need to fully implement the currently ongoing 
public procurement reform. The PER report underlines the need for the PA to address the current 
fiscal situation (insufficient tax revenues coupled with high expenditures); the substantial dependence 
on foreign aid; the very low level of public investment; the heavy reliance on public sector employment 
to increase economic growth (as evidenced by the high public sector wage bill); and the average 
quality of public services. 
Palestine is not included in the Transparency International scoring, and there is limited 
3.
information available on corruption. Nevertheless, the literature available suggests that, despite 
improvement (notably the enactment of the State of Palestine anti-corruption law and the 
establishment of an anti-graft court and commission in 2010), corruption remains a major problem in 
the West Bank118. 
In light of the above, and given the highly volatile political and security situation in Palestine, 
4.
coupled with the fact that the government operates with no electoral mandate and no functioning 
legislature, the country risk is rated as high. 
Financial management risk assessment 
Based on the financial management risk assessment, the overall fiduciary risk was rated as 
5.
Medium, due to potential difficulties in the recruitment of competent staff, the inadequacy of the 
government IFMIS for project accounting and financial management, and the limited capacity of the 
internal audit unit at the executing agency level. It is considered, however, that RELAP financial 
management arrangements and internal control systems will satisfy IFAD's minimum requirements to 
provide accurate and timely information on the progress of project implementation and appropriate 
accountability for funds. The residual financial management risk may be reduced to Low, provided that 
the following appropriate risk mitigation measures are adopted: 
118   Transparency International 2010 Global Corruption Barometer, World Bank Institute 2011 Worldwide Governance 
Indicators, Global Integrity 2010 West Bank report and Freedom House, 2012 Freedom in the World-West Bank.

Proposed financial management and disbursement arrangements 
7.
Financial management organization. Although it is intended to be fully embedded and 
located within the MoA, the RELAP PMU will be vested with financial and administrative autonomy. 
The fiduciary team will be composed of a finance officer, a procurement officer and an accounts & 
administrative assistant, all recruited through a competitive process. These staff will be hired on one-
year contracts renewable based on satisfactory performance. Detailed terms of reference for each of 
these positions are attached to appendix 5. 
Internal controls. The RELAP internal controls system will rely heavily on the MoA system, as 
8.
all transactions have to be approved by high-ranking ministry officials and validated by the MoFP 
financial controller. The project internal control mechanisms (and its linkages to the MoA internal 
controls system) will be detailed in the financial and administrative procedures manual, to be prepared 
before disbursements begin. IFAD will be requested to provide no-objection on this manual. 
Budgeting. All project activities for each component and subcomponent will be included in an 
9.
AWPB. The AWPB will detail the activities, quantities, unit costs, implementing entity, target dates, 
and will allocate the budget for each activity by funding source (IFAD grant, co-financiers, counterpart 
funds and beneficiaries contributions). The AWPB will also include (i) full documentation of all unit 
costs assumptions and hypotheses and (ii) summary tables showing forecasted disbursement rates 
against allocations (by category and by component). 
  The budgeting process will start in August each year so that the AWPB and procurement plan 
10.
(PP) may be approved by the PSC and submitted to the government by the end of September each 
year. It will then be submitted to IFAD for no objection by the end of October each year. Through its 
computerized financial management system, the project will monitor the financial execution of the 
AWPB and produce budget vs. actual statements on a monthly basis. This will serve as a basis for 
discussion during the monthly budget review meeting to be organized by the Project Director for the 
review of physical and financial performance and the adoption of corrective actions. 
  Accounting and financial reporting requirements. The BISAN system currently in use by the 
11.
MoA is not adapted to project accounting, and does not provide the required financial statements and 
reports. The PMU will therefore acquire and install an accounting software designed for project 
accounting, that will allow for (i) recording and reporting of transactions by component, category, 
source of fund, AWPB activity and geographical location, (ii) budget monitoring, (iii) automated bank 
reconciliations, (iv) contract management and monitoring of financial commitments, (v) production of 
the required financial reports and statements including those related to contributions in kind, and, (vi) 
possibly, the automated production of withdrawal applications.  
  The PMU will record eligible expenditures following international accounting standards (cash 
12.
basis), and all accounting policies and procedures related to the project will be clearly documented in 
the financial and administrative procedures manual. The PMU will be required to produce monthly 
financial reports that will include analyses of disbursement rates by category, AWPB execution, cash 
position and cash forecast, implementing partners’ financial situation, procurement plan execution and 
any salient administrative issues. In addition, interim unaudited financial reports (IFR) will be

submitted to IFAD within 30 days of the end of each quarter using a format defined in the manual. The 
IFR will summarize the project’s financial situation for each funding source and will include analytical 
comments on budget variances, as well as any constraints faced in the fiduciary area. Finally, the 
PMU will prepare annual financial statements (in accordance with the IPSAS cash basis of 
accounting) and submit them to IFAD and the external auditors at the latest 2 months after the end of 
each fiscal year. 
13.
  Flow of funds. The Recipient will open USD denominated Designated Accounts (DAs) 
operated by the MoFP in a commercial bank, in order to receive IFAD grant and co-financiers’ 
resources. The authorized allocations will be equal to 6 to 9 months of project expenditure so as to 
ensure a smooth flow of funds and avoid delays in project implementation. Project accounts (also in 
USD) will be opened for PMU payments, which will be processed through the government BISAN 
system. A chart of the flow of funds arrangements is shown as Attachment 2 to this appendix. 
  Counterpart funding. The government contribution to project costs will be in the form of tax 
14.
exemptions, cash contributions to cover certain project activities, and in kind contributions (essentially 
office space and utilities, PMU operating costs and salaries). Payments from the counterpart cash 
contribution will be managed through a separate bank account, recorded separately in the RELAP 
accounting system, and reported separately both in the quarterly IFR and in the annual financial 
statements. 
Implementing partners. As detailed in Appendices 4 and 5, a number of project activities will 
15.
be implemented by NGOs (under components 1 and 2) and by FAO (component 3). These 
implementing partners will be required to (i) open dedicated bank accounts to manage RELAP funds; 
(ii) maintain separate accounting records to account forroject activities; and (iii) submit the RELAP 
funds to annual external audits (to be finalized in time to meet IFAD project audit requirements). The 
agreements signed between the IPs and RELAP/MoA will specify the schedule and amount of the 
funds to be made available by RELAP (based on the approved AWPBs), as well as the financial 
reporting requirements (in terms of content and frequency). For the NGOs, this will consist of monthly 
summary financial reports and quarterly full financial reports119. The reporting requirements for FAO 
will be based on IFAD’s obligations vis-à-vis the GCF.  
  External audit. The Palestinian state audit institution, the State Audit and Administrative 
16.
Control Bureau (SAACB), is a member of the INTOSAI120 and is in charge of auditing the government 
accounts as well as all state institutions. Due to the magnitude of its mandate and in light of its limited 
human resources, the SAACB does not currently have the capacity to conduct external audits of 
donor-funded projects121. The Bureau will be encouraged to include RELAP in its annual audit 
program as soon as it becomes feasible, as its staffing expands and its capacity is strengthened. In 
the meantime, the Recipient, through the PMU, will appoint independent auditors acceptable to IFAD, 
under TOR cleared by IFAD, and in line with the IFAD Guidelines for Audits. The contract for the audit 
will be for a maximum of three years, subject to satisfactory performance and IFAD clearance. The 
auditors will give an opinion on the financial statements, designated accounts and SOEs, and will 
comment on the use of project resources (in particular by implementing partners) and the adherence 
to procurement rules. The auditors will also provide a management letter addressing the adequacy of 
the accounting and internal control systems. The audit report will be submitted to IFAD not later than 
six months after the end of each fiscal year  
17.
Internal audit. The MoA Internal Audit Unit, which was established in 2005 and became 
functional in 2010, is composed solely of a General Director (reporting to the Minister) and a Director 
of Administration. With no audit staff and no dedicated budget, this unit lacks both the human and 
financial capacity to fully carry out its mandate. Consequently, the IA unit is not able to perform routine 
119   Including: funds reconciliation (funds received, disbursements and balance), bank reconciliation and bank statement, 
detailed expenditure statement (by budget line) with copies of supporting documents, budget to actual statement with 
variance analysis (also linking physical to financial progress) 
120   International Organization of State Audit Institutions 
121   With support from the World Bank, the SAACB is planning to start the audit of a WB-funded project in 2018.

audits of donor-funded projects executed by the MoA. An alternative could be to utilize the MoFP 
Internal Audit Unit, which intervenes both on MoFP related institutions and on other entities lacking 
the capacity, based on specific requests122. The MoA will therefore be encouraged to submit an official 
request to MoFP for the use of their Internal Audit Unit as internal auditors of RELAP.  
  Anticorruption and good governance framework. The primary responsibility of detecting 
18.
fraud and corruption lies with the Recipient. However, the project should note that IFAD applies a Zero 
Tolerance Policy towards fraudulent, corrupt, collusive or coercive actions in projects financed through 
its loans and grants. “Zero Tolerance” means that IFAD will pursue all allegations falling under the 
scope of this policy and that appropriate sanctions will be applied where the allegations are 
substantiated. IFAD shall take all possible actions to protect from reprisals individuals who help reveal 
corrupt practices in its project or grant activities and individuals or entities subject to unfair or 
malicious allegations. Given IFAD’s Zero Tolerance described above, it is important that the staff and 
all stakeholders of the project are familiar with IFAD’s as well as national anticorruption policies and 
whistleblowing procedures. The IFAD anticorruption policy is available on the IFAD website at 
www.ifad.org/governance/anticorruption/index.htm. The IFAD website also provides instructions on 
how to report any alleged wrongdoing to the Office of Audit and Oversight 
(http://www.ifad.org/governance/anticorruption/how.htm). 
19.
  The dissemination of both IFAD’s and national anti-corruption policy amongst project staff and 
stakeholders, as well as the adoption of IFAD procurement guidelines for RELAP procurement, should 
reinforce the use of good practices. In addition, RELAP will promote good governance through the 
involvement of municipalities, villages and beneficiaries in (i) the preparation of the annual work plans 
and budgets, (ii) the implementation of activities, and (iii) the monitoring and evaluation of activities. 
  Taxation. IFAD grant proceeds cannot be utilized for the payment of taxes. Consequently, the 
20.
payment of taxes and duties will be made from the government counterpart contribution. The PMU will 
be responsible for securing the necessary tax exemption documents so as to ensure that all RELAP 
transactions are exempt from VAT, duties and other taxes. 
  Supervision and implementation support (fiduciary aspects). Based on the risk 
21.
assessment, the supervision and implementation support plan for RELAP will include: 
 
 
 
 
 
Full training of finance and procurement staff as part of the project start-up workshop, and 
refresher training as part of the IFAD supervision/implementation support missions  
One full fiduciary review each year (as part of a supervision mission) 
Detailed review of the FM and procurement arrangements in the procedures manual, including 
relevant policies, guidelines and procedures with regard to all activities. 
Desk reviews of periodic progress and financial reports and annual financial statements 
Follow-up on work performed and reports issued by the external and internal auditors. 
  Start-up costs. In order to facilitate the timely launch of project activities, the Recipient will be 
22.
allowed to incur certain expenditures prior to the satisfaction of all disbursement conditions. These will 
include costs related to: recruitment of the PMU contracted staff and salaries for first 3 months; start-
up workshops; installation of the accounting software (including acquisition of license, customization 
and training); drafting of the PIM; procurement of the IT equipment and the project vehicle; selection 
of the implementing partners (NGOs); and baseline survey. The start-up costs will be limited to USD 
200 000, and will be specified in the financing agreement. 
122   The MoFP Internal Audit Unit focuses on risk assessment, compliance with regulations, review of internal controls systems, 
verification of accounts, achievement of objectives and good governance.

Appendix 8:  Procurement 
Appendix 8:  Procurement 
National Procurement System. In an effort to improve the efficiency, economy, transparency 
1.
and accountability of its public procurement system, the PA launched a modernization program as part 
of the “Palestinian National Development Plan – State Building to Sovereignty 2014-2016”. The public 
procurement system reform was supported by the World Bank and led to the adoption of the new 
Public Procurement Law (PPL) in 2014123. The enactment of the PPL was followed by the adoption of 
the Public Procurement Regulations (PPR – revised in June 2016) aimed at supporting the 
implementation of the new PPL. 
2.
This newly adopted legal and regulatory framework, which applies to all procuring entities and 
all procurement activities financed from public funds, is generally in line with international standards 
and IFAD procurement guidelines. It sets open competitive bidding as the default procurement 
method, and clearly defines the applicable procurement methods based on specified thresholds for 
the various categories of procurement (goods, non-consulting services, works and consulting 
services). The law establishes a “High Council on Public Procurement Policy” responsible for policy-
making, development of documentation/guidelines/manuals, oversight of public procurement 
activities, compilation of data and issuance of annual reports on procurement, training of procurement 
officers, and public awareness campaigns). It also provides for a public procurement portal to be used 
for the publication of bidding opportunities, annual procurement plans, bidding documents, contract 
awards and data on complaints resolution. Finally, under the law, an independent body is established 
for the review/settlement of procurement complaints. 
However, many of the instruments and institutional arrangements described in the 
3.
legal/regulatory texts have not yet been implemented or are still not operational: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The High Council on Public Procurement Policy, although created, is not yet functional; 
The required procurement documentation, including procurement manuals and standard 
bidding documents, are still in draft form; 
The procuring entities do not all prepare annual procurement plans or submit periodic reports 
on procurement; 
The public procurement portal is not fully operational and the required publications are not 
carried out; 
The State Audit & Administrative Control Bureau is not equipped to conduct procurement 
audits, and there is generally no prior or post review of procurement; 
The complaints mechanism is not functional (for the moment, complaints may only be filed with 
the concerned procuring entity). 
4.
Furthermore, it is worth mentioning that the recent revision of the PPR (June 2016) has 
decreased some of the thresholds for decentralized procurement, leaving the bulk of the procurement 
of goods and consulting services under the purview of the General Supplies Department (MoFP). 
5.
MoA Procurement Department Assessment. As part of the review of the national 
procurement system, and in order to determine whether RELAP procurement activities could be 
undertaken by the Ministry of Agriculture (MoA) as lead agency, an assessment of the procurement 
capacity of the MoA was also conducted. Unfortunately, this assessment could only be partial due to 
the fact that all procurement documents at the MoA are available only in Arabic.  
The MoA Procurement Department is currently composed of 6 staff (including the Director) and 
6.
is responsible for both the ministry’s internal procurement and procurement for the donor-funded 
projects under the MoA. However, the procurement activity under this department is limited to 
123   A Public Procurement Law was previously issued in December 2011, and derived Public Procurement Regulations were 
finalized in 2013. 
145 
Palestine 
Resilient Land & Resource Management Project 
Final project design report 
Appendix 8:  Procurement 
procurement of goods, non-consulting services and consulting services below USD 50 000, and works 
below USD 500 000. Procurement above these values is undertaken by the General Supplies 
Department (at MoFP) or by the Central Tenders Department (Ministry of Public Works). In addition, it 
was noted that (i) the department does not prepare annual procurement plans; (ii) there is no 
monitoring of the execution of procurement activities and contract monitoring is handled by the 
requesting department or project; and (iii) the staff currently in place in the MoA Procurement 
Department are not proficient enough to work using the English language. 
Procurement arrangements for RELAP: IFAD’s approach is to adopt, whenever possible, the 
7.
national procurement systems in order to enhance ownership and effectiveness of development aid, 
in accordance with the principles adopted in the Paris Declaration. However, based on the 
assessment conducted, it appears that the PA procurement framework, in its current state, cannot be 
relied upon for the RELAP procurement activities. The government endeavours, with continued 
support from the World Bank and other development partners, to continue the implementation of all 
provisions of the PPL and PPR until full operationalization of the institutional environment is reached, 
and an effective and efficient public procurement system is in place. Until this is achieved, and the 
national procurement system is re-assessed, it is recommended that IFAD procurement guidelines be 
adopted for the implementation of the RELAP, as is the case with the projects funded by other 
development partners such as the World Bank and other multilateral donors. 
8.
The PMU will be required to prepare and submit to IFAD (together with the AWPB) for no 
objection, an annual procurement plan (PP) organized by type of procurement (goods, non-consulting 
services, works and services) and by project component. The PP will show for each procurement: the 
reference to the AWPB, the estimated cost, the procurement method, the detailed timeline (from 
preparation of TOR/specifications to signature of contract) and the need for IFAD prior review. Each 
item in the PP will show a “planned” line and an “actual” line to facilitate the monitoring of PP 
execution. Thresholds for the applicable procurement methods124 will be as follows:

The acceptable selection methods for consulting services will include (i) Quality- and Cost-
based Selection; (ii) Quality-based Selection; (iii) Selection under a Fixed Budget; (iv) Least Cost 
Selection; (v) Selection based on Consultants’ Qualifications; (vi) Single-source Selection of 
consulting firms; (vii) Procedures for competitive selection of Individual Consultants; and (viii) Single-
source procedures for the Selection of Individual Consultants. 
IFAD’s prior review procedures will be on terms of reference, bidding documents, evaluation 
10.
reports and contracts, and will apply to the procurement of goods and non-consulting services valued 
at USD 50 000 or more, works valued at USD 100 000 or more and consultant services valued at 
USD 30 000 or more. Furthermore, IFAD’s prior no objection will be required for all procurement under 
direct contracting, regardless of the contract value. 
  The applicable rules and procedures related to project procurement will be detailed in the 
11.
RELAP financial and administrative manual. All bidding documents will mention the applicability of 
IFAD’s anti-corruption policy. In addition, bidding documents will contain a provision allowing IFAD to 
inspect the contractors’ accounts, records and other documents related to their bid submission and 
124   These thresholds are aligned with the PPR thresholds.

contract performance or to have them audited by an auditor appointed by IFAD, in accordance with 
IFAD’s Project Procurement guidelines. With regard to the bid opening and bid evaluation committees, 
the procedures manual will detail the provisions related to conflicts of interest, in particular the 
obligation for committee members to declare any real or apparent conflict of interest, and to withdraw 
from the committee if deemed necessary. 
  The level and complexity of procurement envisaged for RELAP will require the recruitment of a 
12.
Procurement Officer who will be responsible for (i) the preparation and updating on a real-time basis 
on the annual procurement plan; (ii) the conduct of the procurement process in accordance with 
applicable rules and procedures; (iii) the monitoring of the procurement plan execution, and the 
related reporting on a monthly basis; (iv) the management of contracts; and (v) strengthening the 
capacity of the MoA Procurement Department staff. IFAD will support the PMU in this aspect, as 
needed, through: 
 
 
 
Implementation support throughout project life, and in particular at project start; 
Technical assistance during the first year of the project; 
Workshops or training sessions. 
  Contracts below the prior review thresholds will be subject to post review as part of the IFAD 
13.
supervision missions. Additionally, the RELAP auditors will be requested to ensure that procurement 
for goods, non-consulting services, works and consulting services under IFAD financing was 
conducted in compliance with the provisions of the financing agreement, the letter to the borrower and 
the IFAD Project Procurement guidelines. Any exception noted will have to be mentioned in the audit 
report and/or the management letter issued by the auditors. 
  The implementing partners (selected NGOs and the FAO) will be responsible for conducting 
14.
any procurement required for the execution of the project activities allocated to them, using their own 
procurement procedures. For procurement undertaken by the NGOs, the PMU will be involved 
through the review of the bidding documents, participation in the bid opening/evaluations, and 
verification of contract awards, so as to ensure competition, transparency and compliance with 
applicable rules. In addition, village council representatives will participate in bid opening meetings 
and bid evaluations whenever feasible.

Appendix 9:  Project cost and financing 
Appendix 9:  Project cost and financing 
This appendix covers the project costs and financing plan, while it also describes the 
1.
assumptions underlying them and sets out the basis and details of the estimated project costs. 
Project costs and financing 
2.
Main assumptions. The project is financed over a six-year (6) period, and it is assumed to 
start in the second semester of 2018. Costs have been estimated on the basis of prices prevailing 
during project design in September 2017. 
Physical and price contingencies. A physical contingency of 5% has been applied to civil works 
3.
- land development - to take into account the uncertainty on the exact implementation quantities while 
price contingencies have been applied on all costs, with the exception of grants. 
Inflation. According to the Economist Intelligence Unit, Palestine's price trends closely follow 
4.
those in Israel — especially in the West Bank. Prices remained in deflationary territory in both Gaza 
and the West Bank in 2016, reflecting global commodity price trends and the relative strength of the 
currencies in use in Palestine, but inflation averaged 0.5% in the first half of 2017. Prices are 
expected to trend up only modestly, with inflation averaging 1% in 2017/18125. For the purpose of this 
analysis, annual local inflation rates have been set at 1.2% throughout the six project years. For 
foreign inflation, an average inflation of 1.8% has been retained. 
Exchange rate. Palestine does not have its own currency and it mostly relies on the Shekel, 
5.
given that the bulk of trade and tax revenue is mainly sourced through Israel. For the purpose of this 
analysis, local prices have been collected in Shekel. The exchange rate used is 1 USD: NIS 3.74, 
which is calculated as the average annual exchange rate between 2015 and 2018126. 
Taxes and duties. Part of the Government co-financing of the project will be in form of waiving 
6.
of all taxes and duties on goods and services procured under the project. The rates and amounts of 
the taxes and duties in the project’s costs presented below are defined only to determine the 
Government contribution and to value the total project cost. 
The items to be imported for the project attract import and excise duties of varying proportions, 
7.
and a value-added tax (VAT) of 16% is levied on all imported goods. 
Project costs 
The total project costs including physical and price contingencies are estimated at USD 41.44 
8.
million over six years implementation period. Project costs by components are summarized in table 1, 
while a complete set of project summary tables and detailed costs tables are presented in 
attachments 1 and 2 of this appendix. 
Project costs by components. Project investments are organized into four major components: 
9.
(i) Climate resilient land development (60 per cent of the total costs); (ii) Market linkages for the rural 
poor (23 per cent of the total costs); (iii) Improved public services for upscaling climate resilient 
agricultural land use and production systems (8 per cent of the costs); (iv) Project management127 (9 
per cent of the costs). A summary breakdown of the project costs by components is shown in table 48.

Table 48: Project costs by component 
Project financing 
  The total project costs of USD 41.44 million will be financed by i) an IFAD grant (from the Fund 
10.
for Gaza and the West Bank - FGWB) of USD 4.56 million (confirmed), ii) a cash contribution from the 
government of USD 1.17 million, iii) an OFID grant of USD 1 million (confirmed), iv) an in-kind 
contribution from government currently estimated at USD 6.57 million128, v) an in kind and cash 
contribution from beneficiaries, respectively of USD 3.61 million and USD 1.28 million (in the form of 
cash, casual labour, and some inputs and equipment), and vi) a contribution toward the road 
construction from the village councils (estimated at US$ 0.24 million). Funds of approximately US$ 23 
million– including a grant from the Green Climate Fund (GCF) of USD 15 million and a grant of 
approximately USD 8 million from other partners/entities - are to be budgeted as a financing gap. 
IFAD, MOA and EQA will be in constant contact with the GCF, OFID and other potential co-financiers 
to mobilize this amount to fill the financing gap or otherwise seek alternative financing sources during 
the inception and implementation. The proposed financing plan is summarized in Components by 
Financier table below.

development” (USD 0.85 million), and a small amount (USD 0.044 million) will contribute to the project 
management cost. 
  The GCF will mostly finance i) sub-component 1.1 "Testing, monitoring and upscaling of climate 
14.
adapted land development approaches" (USD 0.06 million); ii) sub-component 1.2 “Resilient land 
development" and in particular climate adaptive land development works (USD 8.81 million); iii) sub-
component 2.2 " Inclusive entrepreneurship development support" (USD 3 million); iv) component 3 
“Improved public services for upscaling climate resilient agricultural land use and production systems” 
(USD 3 million), and v) Project management (USD 0.1 million)129. 
  Other sources of financing will be identified and confirmed before the project start. The 
15.
component by financier table shows that other entities are expected to finance sub-component 1.1 
“Testing, monitoring and upscaling of climate adapted land development approaches" (USD 0.27 
million), sub-component 1.2 “Resilient land development" (USD 2.1 million), 1.3 “Investment in 
agricultural roads” (USD 2 million circa), sub-component 2.1 “Rural bulking of agricultural products” 
(USD 2.3 million circa), 2.2 "Inclusive entrepreneurship development support" (USD 1.2 million circa), 
and project management (app. USD 1 million). 
  Government’s in-kind contribution will be the exemptions from taxes and duties on all project 
16.
inputs that involve funding from the IFAD grant, CGF, OFID and other entities. The estimate of taxes 
and duties was based on the rates in effect prevailing at the time of the design. In conformity with the 
principle that no taxes or duties will be financed out of the proceeds of the IFAD loan/grant, any future 
changes in tax legislation will have to apply to the project. The in-kind contribution will also include: 
office space, utilities, government's seconded staff time, vehicles at district level, etc. (see appendix 5 
for more details). 
  Beneficiaries will contribute both in-kind and in-cash to i) sub-component 1.2 “Resilient land 
17.
development" (USD 3.62 million in-kind and USD 0.60 in-cash), where Beneficiaries' in cash 
contribution for orchards land development is estimated at 15% of machine works and beneficiaries' in 
kind contribution is estimated at 30% of labour intensive works; and (ii) 2.2 "Inclusive 
entrepreneurship development support" (USD 0.68 million in-cash), where beneficiaries would 
contribute to 15% of the Inclusive entrepreneurship development support cost. 
  Village Councils are expected to contribute to sub-component 1.3 “Investment in agricultural 
18.
roads” (US$ 0.24 million, approximately 10% of the total road construction cost). 
  Expenditure and disbursement accounts. The project will be rolled out through the project 
19.
management unit - which will manage and coordinate the flow of funds and the expenditures incurred 
on account of the project activities. Financial management and procurement procedures are 
described in appendices 7 and 8. A summary of the total costs by expenditure accounts per year is 
shown in Table 50 and a summary of the total costs by disbursement accounts and financier is 
presented in Table 51. 
129   In particular the salary of the Deputy project director technical assistant, specialist in land and water management will be 
financed by the GCF's funds.

Appendix 10:  Economic and Financial Analysis 
Appendix 10: Economic and Financial Analysis 
A financial and economic analysis is undertaken to assess the financial and economic impacts 
1.
of the project on farmers and on the society as a whole. Benefits are expected to derive from (i) 
enhanced access to productive agricultural land and water through a range of investments in land 
development, agricultural roads, soil improvements, and rain water harvesting facilities; ii) 
strengthened smallholders’ resilience to current and anticipated impacts of climate variability and 
change through adapted agricultural land-uses and practices, and improved soil and water 
management; iii) improved market linkages at cluster levels; iv) entrepreneurship development 
support, which will focus on creating economic opportunities for women and youth. In order to 
represent the project financial benefits, 12 financial models have been prepared. The financial models 
have also been used as building blocks for the economic analysis. 
2.
Number of beneficiaries. RELAP is expected to benefit about 30,000 households, or 150,000 
direct beneficiaries, considering an average household size of 5 in West Bank130.Approximately 2 700 
households will benefit from resilient and equitable land development activities; 4,500 households – 
including 1,850 not benefiting from land development - will benefit from agricultural roads 
construction; 900 households will benefit from inclusive entrepreneurship development support; and 
6,650 households will benefit from cluster development support – out of which 4,000 households will 
exclusively benefit from cluster development support and 2,650 households will also benefit from 
access to grants and resilient land development activities . Finally, 30,000 households will directly 
benefit from component 3's activities, including climate resilient trainings and enhanced 
information/knowledge sharing. The below table summarizes the beneficiaries' phasing-in by activity. 
Table 52: Direct household beneficiaries' phasing-in by main activity 
3.
Financial Analysis. The primary objective of the financial analysis is to determine the financial 
viability and incentives of the target group for engaging in project activities, by examining the impact of 
project interventions on family labour, cash flow and net incomes. Based on field visits, PNRMP's 
activities131 national statistics, and on expected project activities, a number of indicative financial 
models were identified during the project design process. Twelve illustrative financial farm and activity 
models were prepared to demonstrate the financial viability of the investments: seven resilient land 
development financial models: i) orchard land reclamation with terrace on slope between 10-30%, ii) 
orchard land rehabilitation with terrace on slope between 10-30%, iii) orchard land rehabilitation with 
terrace on slope between 30-40%, iv) orchard land rehabilitation with terrace on slope<10%, v) wadis 
land development, vi) rangeland land development, vii) crop – livestock conservation agriculture (CA) 
system; three financial models representing potential activities that landless women or young people 
could undertake through inclusive entrepreneurship development support: viii) bee-keeping model, ix) 
mushroom model, x) sheep model; two infrastructure models: xi) road model, xii) market model. A

Final project design report 
Appendix 10: Economic and Financial Analysis 
cash-flow analysis is finally carried out to present the “with” and “without” project (WP/WOP) analysis. 
All financial models form the building blocks for the economic analysis. 
Key assumptions. The following information gathered during the design mission has been 
4.
used to set up the analyses: i) interviews with potential beneficiaries, ii) information collected from the 
Ministry of Agriculture in Ramallah, iii) mission experts’ estimates, iv) estimates from ICARD, v) 
national statistics, and vi) data from PNRMP. In particular, information on labour and input 
requirements for various operations, capital costs, prevailing wages, yields, farm gate and market 
prices of commodities, and transport costs were collected. Conservative assumptions were made both 
for inputs and outputs in order to take account of possible risks. Key assumptions are as follows: 
a. 
b. 
c. 
d. 
Exchange rate. The exchange rate used in the analysis is fixed at 1 USD = 3.74 NIS.  
Numeraire and Prices. The numeraire adopted in the analysis is the domestic price level 
expressed in domestic currency. The financial prices for project inputs and products are current 
prices for the second half of 2017 derived from market and government statistical sources, 
adjusted where necessary to represent farm gate prices. Economic prices for traded goods 
have been estimated based on World Bank commodity price of September 2017. The prices 
used in the analysis are shown in attachment 10.1 to this appendix. 
Labour. Family labour has been valued both in financial and economic analysis. It has been 
assumed that both family labour and hired unskilled labour are priced at NIS 100 per day, which 
is the prevailing market rate in rural areas. 
Discount rate. A discount rate of 10% has been used in this analysis to assess the viability and 
robustness of the proposed investments. The selected value is calculated by taking into 
account actual market and microfinance interest rates on loans as well as the average interest 
rate on deposits132. 
5.
Resilient land development models. Activities of component 1 are designed to enhance 
farmer’s and livestock keeper’s access to productive agricultural land and water resources under 
increasing water scarcity through a range of investments in land development for different farming 
systems and livelihoods. Furthermore, activities of component 1 will be complemented with activities 
of component 3 to enhance households' capacities of absorbing climate risk by anticipating it and 
strengthening knowledge sharing.  
  When considering land development benefits versus costs, it is important to also highlight that 
6.
by turning unproductive lands into productive ones, registered owners of unproductive lands would 
increase the rights that they have on the land and therefore decrease the possibility of land 
confiscation. Indeed, since 1967, according to the Ottoman law code "if a registered land is not 
cultivated for three successive years, it may become the property of the Ottoman State, i.e. “State 
Land”.  
The table below shows the expected number of dunums to be reached by each land 
7.
development intervention. Dunums are allocated, in consultation with MoA, based on the type of land 
development works needed in the project area as well as on the climatic vulnerability. For orchard 
land development, a weighted average unit cost is used in COSTAB to allow for more flexibility during 
project implementation.

Orchard land development models. Four orchard land reclamation and rehabilitation models 
are developed and individually described in the next paragraphs. All four models are developed on 7 
dunums. The trees planted are olive, almond, fig and grapevine. Household's self-consumption of 
olive oil is included in all models (16 litres per year133).The models assume that 80% of the olive tree 
production is transformed in and sold as olive oil whilst 20% of the production is sold as fruit. Because 
olive trees take more than 10 years to reach full production, the WP scenarios of the land reclamation 
with terrace on slope 10-30%, rehabilitation with terrace on slope 30-40% and rehabilitation with 
terrace on slope less than 10% are developed over 20 years. Furthermore, the WOP scenarios of 
these models assume that the land is not cultivated and that trees have to be re-planted for all 7 
dunums. In order not to overestimate results, foregone income related to labour requirements in the 
WP is considered in the WOP (at full orchards' development). At the end of all models, a financing 
analysis is developed to show the project support that farmers will receive for land development and 
consequently the change in their net income after financing.

Orchard land reclamation with terraces on slopes between 10% and 30%.This model is 
developed on 7 dunums. The investment in land reclamation (including fencing, cisterns for 
water harvesting, retaining walls, land cleaning, land plowing, trees etc.) is NIS 9 200 per 
dunum, It is assumed that 3 dunums will be cultivated with olive trees, 1 dunum with fig trees, 1 
dunum with almond trees and 2 dunums with grapevine134. Because the proposed trees start 
bearing fruits only from year 3 / 4, farmers intercrop trees with another crop, i.e. chick pea, 
which can provide them with an additional source of income while also improving the soil 
fertility. The profitability indicators of this model, summarized in the table below, are positive 
although borderline. Yet, when excluding family labour from the final calculation, results improve 
significantly (NPV: NIS 67 500 and IRR 20%). Most importantly, results obtained considering 
the flow of fund proceeding from donors and the farmer indicates that the activity is financially 
viable and further sustainable from farmers’ viewpoint. Finally, the investment is further justified 
when considering that, according to the Ottoman Law referenced above, registered productive 
lands cannot be confiscated by the State. 
Orchard land rehabilitation with terraces on slopes between 10% and 30%. This model 
considers an investment of NIS 3 360 per dunum, including the cost for machine works, cistern, 
retaining walls and fencing. Rehabilitation can be much cheaper than reclamation because the 
type of works in rehabilitation may be less invasive and therefore less costly. Furthermore, in 
some rehabilitation cases, part of the land may be already productive and therefore does not 
need to be entirely re-planted with new trees. This is indeed the case represented in this model, 
in which the WOP scenario shows that 4 dunums of land are already cultivated and therefore 
foregone income is not considered. For the same reason, the WP is normally developed over 
10 years135 and it assumes that the land is cultivated with 3 dunums of olive trees, 1 dunum of 
fig trees, 1 dunum of almond trees and 2 dunums of grapevine. The profitability indicators of 
this model, summarized in the table below, are positive and show the sustainability of the 
133   https://www.oliveoilmarket.eu/trends-in-world-olive-oil-consumption-ioc-report/ 
134   Type and distribution of trees have been decided together with MoA and based on IFAD's previous project experience. 
135   Olive trees are assumed to be planted already in the WOP.

investment. The net benefits before family labour are shown positive already from the second 
year.  
Orchard land rehabilitation with terraces on slopes between 30% and 40%. This model 
considers an investment of NIS 1 400 per dunum. It is assumed that 3 dunums will be cultivated 
with olive trees, 1 dunum with fig trees, 1 dunum with almond trees and 2 dunums with 
grapevine. As per the previous model, trees are intercropped with chick pea to provide an 
additional source of income while also improving the soil fertility. The profitability indicators of 
this model, summarized in the table below, are positive and show the sustainability of the 
investment. The net benefits before family labour are also in this case shown positive already 
from the second year  
Orchard land rehabilitation with terraces on slopes less than 10%. The investment cost 
considered in this model is approximately NIS 5,000 per dunum. The trees planted are also in 
this case olives, grapevine, almond and figs. Intercropping with chick pea is considered in this 
model too. The profitability indicators summarized in the table below are all shown to be 
positive.

  Wadis land development. The harvesting and storage of water and soil for viable agricultural 
9.
production from wadis is an opportunity for the eastern slopes which is the area in the West Bank 
most affected by climate change in terms of a clear decrease in rainfall and increase in soil erosion 
and desertification. This model will therefore have clear adaptation benefits for the most climate 
vulnerable part of the population. The wadis land development investment cost is NIS 3 270 per 
dunum. The model assumes that 3 dunums of olives, 2 dunums of almonds and 2 dunums of 
grapevine will be planted. Also in this case, olive and almond trees are intercropped with another crop; 
chickpea. Household's self-consumption of olive oil is included in the model (16 litres per year136). 
Because the olive trees take more than 10 years to reach full production, the WP scenario of this 
model is developed over 20 years. The WOP scenario assumes that the land is not cultivated and, in 
order not to overestimate results, it takes into account the foregone income related to labour 
requirements in the WP scenario (at full orchards' development). The profitability indicators of this 
model, summarized in the table below, are positive and confirm the sustainability of this investment. 
Also in this case, a financing analysis is developed to show that, with project support, households' net 
income will be positive from year 1. 
  Rangeland rehabilitation. The rangeland rehabilitation will also be on the eastern slopes and 
10.
will have adaptation benefits for the most climate vulnerable people in the West bank. The investment 
cost of this model is about NIS 2 500 per dunum. It will build soil water retention capacities by 
rehabilitating top soils and fodder rich vegetation cover in areas agreed with the Bedouin and other 
herders communities. Furthermore, RELAP will build beneficiaries' capacities for sustainable grazing 
governance and management. Both in the WOP and in the WP scenarios, the model assumes that 
the farmer owns between 40 and 45 small-ruminants/sheep. The model assumes that, from the third 
year after rangeland restoration, small-ruminants will be able to graze 15-20% more than in the WOP.

This change is expected to have a twofold benefit: (i) decreasing the cost of animal feed, (ii) 
increasing some animal parameters, like fertility, twinning and milking rate. . Overall, the profitability 
indicators are positive confirming that the investment is worthwhile to undertake; this is significant 
especially when considering not only the economical but also the environmental benefits that the 
rangeland restoration will bring to a very climatic vulnerable area. Also in this case a financing 
analysis is developed to show the project support that farmers will receive for investing in this activity.

  Crop – livestock conservation agriculture system. This model is developed on 7 dunums 
and it assumes that with project support the targeted farmers will start using conservation agriculture 
techniques. The WOP scenario assumes that (i) the land is already cultivated by applying 
conventional agriculture techniques, (ii) the crops considered are the same included in the WP 
scenario – wheat and barley, (iii) households own 40-45 small-ruminant heads. In the WP, the 
mulching process and constant soil coverage slowly builds up the water retention capacity of the soil 
and allow cultivation under low and variable rainfall and water stressed conditions. The main benefits 
expected are increased yields and incomes due to (i) improved soil and soil moisture, (ii) decreased 
quantity of fertilizers used, (iii) decreased cost of machine and especially fuel for the machine used for 
tillage. The project support to the farmer will be twofold: (i) support in switching from conventional to 
conservation agriculture, (ii) provision of technical assistance. Overall, the profitability indicators are 
shown to be all positive. The NPV is high compared to other interventions mainly due to the low 
investment costs and high benefits.

Inclusive entrepreneurship development support. Component 2 will have a focus on rural

women, unemployed youth, and the poor landless at the village level, who, belonging to the same 
villages, will also be encouraged to participate in the MRPs. RELAP will provide inclusive 
entrepreneurship development support/investment grants, together with tailored technical assistance 
provided by a business development services provider. Three indicative income generating activity 
models – small ruminant/sheep breeding, beekeeping, and mushroom cultivation - have been 
developed to show representative activities137 that could be financed by a grant of NIS 18 700)138 (or 
USD 5 000). The beekeeping and mushroom cultivation models are also used as representative 
examples of climate resilient activities supported by RELAP. In order not to overestimate benefits, the 
foregone income related to labour requirements of this model is used as counterfactual of the WOP 
scenarios. At the end of each model, a financing analysis is developed to show the project support 
that farmers will receive for land development and consequently the change in net income after 
financing.

model also assumes that some of the milk will be used for HH's self-consumption. Overall, all 
profitability indicators are positive, as shown in the summary table below. 
Beekeeping investment grant model. This model assumes that the grant will be used to 
purchase 30 beehives and the equipment needed for honey production. It is assumed that 
poliflora honey is produced139, but other bees products and honey varieties could be considered 
by the farmers. This activity could be specifically suitable for landless people and it will

contribute to pollination. Overall, all profitability indicators are positive, as shown in the 
summary table below.  
c. 
Mushroom cultivation grant model. This model assumes that the grant will be used to start 
cultivating mushrooms (oyster variety). The main investment (NIS 5,500) includes: mycelium 
(40 kg), media, 40 boxes where mushrooms are grown, room humidificator and heater, and 
other small equipment to start the activity. With a minimum investment, mushroom production 
could represent a significant source of income – income could reach up to NIS 20,000 per year 
starting with 40 kg of mycelium - for young unemployed or landless people.

  Road model. The main benefits of this model are assumed to derive from: (i) savings on 
13.
transportation costs for going to the market and (ii) reduced post-harvest losses. In order not to 
double count benefits, this model is mainly developed for 1,800 households who are expected to 
benefit only from agricultural roads (excluding land development). The model's main assumptions are: 
(i) farmers go to the market on average once per week; (ii) with good roads, the transportation cost 
per trip decreases of approximately 20%; (iii) on average 10% reduced post-harvest losses of 
agricultural outputs. Below, a summary of the profitability indicators of the road model is presented.

  Market model. The project will support the construction of market and collection centres so to 
14.
allow small producers to sell their products in a common place. It is expected that by iimproving 
facilities for bulking of agricultural products at village level, farmers and their organizations will be 
connected to more market actors (e.g. traders, retailers and input suppliers) and this will in turn 
generate increase local demand for agricultural products. The market model is based on the following 
assumptions: each market and collection centre can deal with an annual volume of transactions 
reaching 4 200 tons of fruit and vegetables and 720 tons of olives and almonds. It is estimated that 
each market can trade up to 7 five-tons vehicle par market day (3 per week), which is equivalent to 40 
to 50 tons of agricultural products per market140. Investment cost of NIS 1.3 million per market as well 
as operating and maintenance costs are considered in the model. In order not to double count 
benefits, the model does not consider producer's benefits which are already considered in the land 
development models. The NPV for this model, discounted at 10%, is 107 million. 
140   Figures are based on discussions with officials from the MA and discussions with stakeholders. These estimates will form 
the basis for discussions in each MRP and with concerned local authorities to adapt to local context, needs and specificities

In brief, the financial analysis of all proposed models shows acceptable results suggesting that 
15.
all project activities are worthwhile to undertake. Equally important, unquantifiable benefits, such as 
increasing households' rights on their land, should also be taken into account when considering the 
profitability of land development activities. 
  Economic Analysis. The objectives of the economic analysis are: i) to examine the overall 
16.
project viability; ii) to assess the project’s impact and overall economic rate of return; and iii) to 
perform sensitivity analyses to assess the benefits from a broad welfare perspective. 
  Key assumptions. The physical inputs and productions established in the financial analysis 
17.
provided the basis to determine the viability of the project investment in terms of opportunity costs and 
quantifiable benefits to the economy as a whole. The estimate of the likely economic returns from 
project interventions are based on the following assumptions. 
(a)
(b)
(c)
Project life has been assumed at 20 years; 
Project inputs and outputs traded are valued at their respective economic prices, and goods are 
expected to move freely within the project area in response to market demand; 
Considering the very low interest rate on deposits in Palestine (average 1.2%), the opportunity 
cost of capital of 9% is calculated by considering the long-term deposit rate - to reflect a 
realistic alternative for public sector investments in the country – as well as the Wall Street 
prime rate (4.5%), actual market (6.4%) and microfinance (22.4%) interest rates on loans. 
  Project economic costs and benefits. The economic analysis includes the investment and 
18.
incremental recurrent costs of the project components. The project financial costs have been 
converted to economic values by removal of price contingencies, tax and duties. In order to avoid 
double counting, the final aggregation considered only those costs that were not included in financial 
models. 
  Benefits Estimation. The incremental benefits stream comprises the economic net values of 
19.
households and activity models141. These benefits are then aggregated by the number of households 
that are estimated to uptake each activity. The analysis conservatively considers an adoption rate of 
80%. Roads and markets’ incremental economic benefits are also considered in the final economic 
aggregation.

  Economic Pricing. Economic pricing has been based on the following assumptions:  
(a)
(b)
(c)
The opportunity cost of labour is set at 73 NIS/day, or 73% of financial cost of labour, which is 
justified given rural unemployment rate at 26.7%142 
The shadow exchange rate (SER) has been calculated at 1 USD = 4.22 NIS;  
The Shadow Exchange Ratio Factor (SERF), used to obtain economic costs, has been 
calculated at 1.13. 
  Economic rate of return. The overall economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of the project is 
21.
estimated at 27% for the base case. The net present value (NPV) of the net benefit stream, 
discounted at 9%, is USD 56.5 million.

  Sensitivity analysis. In order to test the robustness of the above results, a sensitivity analysis 
has been carried out; the outcomes of which are presented in the below table. The sensitivity analysis 
investigates the effect of fluctuations in project costs, project benefits, and delays in implementation 
on the NPV and ERR. It shows the economic impacts that a decrease in project benefits – up to -50% 
– will have on the project viability. Similarly, it shows how the economic viability of the project will be 
affected by an increase of up to 50% in project costs; and by a one to three-year delay in project 
implementation. The analysis confirms that the economic viability of the project remains attractive as a 
positive NPV and ERR above 9% are preserved in each case analysed.

Appendix 12:  Compliance with IFAD policies 
Appendix 12: Compliance with IFAD policies 
1.
Alignment with IFAD's str strategic framework 2016-2025. IFAD’s fifth strategic framework 
(SF) covers the period 2016-2025 and serves as an overarching policy guideline to provide direction 
to IFAD’s work and development effectiveness. RELAP is fully aligned with the SF, aiming at an 
enabling inclusive and sustainable rural transformation. Indeed, RELAP will aim at transforming 
Palestine’s smallholders to become more secure in their land tenure, commercially more competitive 
and climatically more resilient. This will be accomplished by strengthening the resilience and 
improving economic opportunities for the rural poor based on competitive farms and agribusinesses 
that are connected to and integrated into more profitable value chains, making sustainable use of 
Palestine’s land and water resources. In particular, RELAP will contribute i) to increase productive 
capacities (SF’s first objective), through more secure access to and management of natural resources 
and enhancing agricultural productivity, especially supported by component 1; ii) to increase benefits 
from market participation (SF’s second objective), through agricultural roads and facilitation of market 
linkages; and iii) to strengthen environmental sustainability and climate resilience of poor rural 
people's economic activities (SF’s third objective), through more secure access to and sustainable 
management of NR, increased on-farm climate resilient production, and improved institutional 
capacities of public services for a better access of farmers to information on climate risks and impacts 
on different cropping and livestock systems. 
Alignment with IFAD fragile situations strategy. RELAP has a clear focus on resilience and 
2.
on root causes of fragility (access to natural resources most notably land). Through component 2, 
there is an integrated and mainstreamed targeting strategy to reach women and youth. Finally, unlike 
other donors in the region, IFAD is working directly through the MoA to support institution- and nation 
building, itself a prerequisite for reducing fragility. 
Alignment with IFAD's engagement with MICs. The project will develop new models (R&D 
3.
sub-component). This will ensure that IFAD supports the country through a mix of financial and 
knowledge products, as recommended by the MICs approach. The design process has already 
included key inputs from PTA/ ECD and FAO: based on their inputs, key knowledge products will be 
developed under component 3.1 to provide agro-climate information services to PA Ministries, village 
councils and farmers. 
4.
Alignment with IFAD's grant financing policy. IFAD’s resources which will be invested in the 
RELAP come from the IFAD’s Fund for Gaza and the West Bank (FGWB) and the financing is aligned 
with the key principles of: 1) the project makes a contribution to a global, regional or national public 
good related to IFAD's mandate through its contribution to enhanced food security, productivity and 
resilience, in a region where food production and distribution systems are disrupted by restrictions; 
and 2) the project focuses on interventions where grant financing has added value and comparative 
advantage over loans (the PA not being eligible for financing through the PBAS). 
Alignment with IFAD’s private sector development and partnership strategy. The RELAP 
5.
design is aligned with this strategy, which places strong emphasis on further developing and 
strengthening the linkages of smallholder farmers with the private sector. The linkages with local 
markets, for farmers and their organizations where they exist, local women and youth associations, 
but also other local stakeholders will be facilitated under the RELAP second component. Also, climate 
information received by farmers, thanks to the RELAP third component, will help them to make better 
market decision, thus ensuring more viable market prospects for agricultural products. Finally, the 
RELAP will follow an approach that works backwards from the market to ensure that there is a 
demand for the products of the smallholder and that market links are established with local 
traders/buyers (thanks to the MRPs) prior to initiation of any activities.  
Alignment with IFAD's policies on inclusive targeting, youth and gender mainstreaming. 
6.
IFAD’s poverty targeting and gender sensitive design and implementation guidelines, updated in 
181 
Palestine 
Resilient Land & Resource Management Project 
Final project design report 
Appendix 12:  Compliance with IFAD policies 
January 2013, have informed the design of RELAP. Women and youth are given a clear focus in the 
project, with specific targets and separate budget line items allocated for them.  
RELAP's approaches and implementation modalities across the components are in line with the 
7.
guiding principles of the targeting policy including: focus on the 'active poor' (through both the land 
development activities and the investment grants requiring beneficiary contributions, thus soliciting 
commitment as 'active poor'), expanding outreach to proactively include those who have fewer assets 
or opportunities (by reducing the beneficiary contributions compared to PNRMP and developing the 
new inclusive activities including the investment grant and support to women's inheritance claims/ 
rights), addressing gender differences (again through the work on land inheritance and grants to 
women's groups).  
8.
The gender mainstreaming strategy shall also define the specific tools and mechanisms 
through which the empowerment of women and the youth will be measured. For example, the gender 
specialist, with support from the M&E specialist, shall undertake specific qualitative surveys among 
women and young beneficiaries in order to understand project impact on their level of economic and 
social empowerment, or to document any positive intra-household changes in power relations or 
gender roles. To do so, a baseline study (qualitative) will be conducted upon women beneficiaries’ 
selection. Also, the gender mainstreaming strategy will devise specific mechanisms to help ensure 
that project support to women is not being “captured” by their husbands, in particular under the grants 
scheme, for example by making sure, through regular field visits conducted jointly with the M&E 
officer, that the grant amount was used for the intended purpose by the intended beneficiary; or by 
requesting women beneficiaries to open a bank account at their exclusive name in order to deposit 
profit from sales. 
Alignment with IFAD's climate change strategy policies on inclusive targeting, youth and 
9.
gender mainstreaming. IFAD’s climate change strategy143 recognizes that the speed and intensity 
of climate change are outpacing the ability of poor rural people and societies to cope. RELAP takes 
cognisance of the fact that poor rural people are in the front line of climate change impacts; the 
ecosystems and biodiversity on which they rely are increasingly degraded. The project incorporates 
IFAD’s assessment that climate-related risks, and potential opportunities, can be addressed more 
systematically within its projects activities (climate change adaptation is mainstreamed in all RELAP 
components) and policy advice (particularly under RELAP third component). The project will make 
use of the IFAD and GCF resources to integrate climate change and environmental concerns within 
the project design. Weather stations are being planned for the project area to assist vulnerable 
farmers with timely information on changes in weather, rainfall, temperatures and their use in shaping 
decisions regarding watering, use of adapted crop varieties, animal breeds and other adaptation 
measures. The investments to be undertaken within RELAP will promote resilience and take into 
consideration the vulnerability of the target areas in terms of water shortage, salinity and post-harvest 
losses. The project will also promote policy engagement relevant to adaptation of the agriculture 
sector to climate change.  
  RELAP will contribute directly to the three purposes of the climate change strategy: a. to help 
10.
smallholder farmers build their resilience to climate change: this is the key objective of component 3, 
to be achieved through the agro-climate information bulletins, promotion of climate resilient 
agricultural practices and varieties, and the use of climate information in the preparation of strategies 
and plans at the community levels; b. to help smallholder farmers take advantage of mitigation 
incentives and funding: this is the basis of the engagement with the GCF, ensuring that these funds 
can ultimately be channelled to enhance smallholder resilience; further, there will be inbuilt incentives 
in the investment grants (with climate smart technology/ process development being a key criterion for 
the grants); and c. to inform a more coherent dialogue on climate change: sub-component 3.2 is 
focused on strengthening institutional capacities and partnerships, contributing directly and 
significantly to the national dialogue on climate change; the activities will directly support the Action 
143   Climate Change Strategy. IFAD, May 2010.

Major landscape characteristics and issues (social, natural resources, and climate) 
1.
Socio-cultural context. The political situation in Palestine is universally recognized as one of 
the most fragile, complex and volatile political and institutional contexts globally. Areas restricted from 
Palestinian use are steadily increasing in the West Bank which is affecting livelihoods. The expansion 
and construction of new Israeli settlements in the West Bank is creating an ever more segmented 
geography where Palestinians are impeded from moving freely across their own land and applying a 
coherent management of their natural resources in the wider landscapes sustaining in particular rural 
livelihoods. Trade is also constrained affecting both agricultural input prices and availability as well as 
the export of produce which are all subject to Israeli restrictions. On internal markets, local products 
have to compete with third choice cheap produce that can easily be imported from Israel without any 
trade barriers (ARI-J, MOE, MOA, 2015)144. 
2.
Under the framework of the Oslo Accord (1993/1996) the Palestinian Authority (PA) was 
designated exclusive control over both internal security-related and civilian issues in Palestinian urban 
areas ("Area A") and civilian control over Palestinian rural areas ("Area B"). The remainder of the 
territories (“Area C” including Israeli settlements and their access roads, buffer zones adjacent to the 
settlements, roads and strategic and border areas, most of the Jordan Valley and the Eastern slope 
region) covering 60% of the territory were subject to transfer to the PA within 18 months of the 
implementation of the Oslo Accord. However, that has not been implemented as foreseen. The area 
within area C restricted from Palestinian use has instead been steadily expanding including an 
important part of agricultural land, restricting the ability of Palestinians to effectively access land and 
also water resources and seriously restricting economic investment and growth (WB, 2008) 145.

Land and water tenure. Due to shifting governance systems over time and the Israeli 
occupation the land and water tenure situation for small farmers in the West Bank is complex and 
insecure.  
Land tenure. After the establishment of the P.A it recovered three sets of land records for 
6.
Palestine, namely Ottoman, British and Jordanian, all incomplete, imprecise and primarily based on 
individual land ownership. However, until the British and later Israeli confiscation of Palestinian land, 
most land in the rural areas were collectively owned by villages or the Bedouin tribes and there was 
little individual land ownership. This traditional system of collective ownership that existed for 
generations was generally not recognized in any of the three land records or by the Israeli state. The 
British Authority in Palestine introduced in 1920 the Woods and Forest Ordinance which became 
important in preparing the country for the creation of a future Jewish national homeland. This 
ordinance was used to confiscate lands that were largely utilized as grazing grounds by the Bedouin 
community and the rural population. These lands were then classified as state owned forest. With the 
establishment of the state of Israel in 1948, these lands became Israeli state lands. In the 1950's, the 
Government of Israel introduced the Vacant Lands Laws. These laws granted the Israeli Ministry of 
Agriculture the ability to acquire any unutilized lands that are "neglected" or "abandoned" by its 
owners to ensure proper and efficient use. These laws were used in conjunction with security laws to 
confiscate lands. The Army would declare an area as a closed military zone, barring farmers from 
reaching their fields. At a later point the Ministry of Agriculture issued confiscation orders regarding 
these fields due to 'neglect' by their owners. The army officers would then issue permits for the Jewish 
settlers to whom the lands were assigned by the Department of Agriculture. In 1953, Law 5713 was 
introduced which granted the Minister of Finance the ability to transfer ownership of properties 
confiscated by the previous laws over the last 5 years to the Israeli Department of Construction and 
Development and subsequently to the settlers. This process is still being followed today for the 
expansion of Israeli settlements in the area C of the West Bank. For Palestinian farmers to secure 
their land it is therefore crucial that they can show their active investment in and usage of their land 
and in parallel process the individual titles in case they do not have it (A. Imseis et. al., 2012) 146.  
7.
In 2002, the PA created the Palestinian Land Authority (PLA). The PLA is in charge of 
surveying and registration of individual, non-governmental institutions, and state-owned land. The PLA 
has been supported by several projects to strengthen its capacities. A World Bank supported project, 
ending in 2007, worked with the PLA to address the issues of improving land security, developing 
efficient land and property markets, managing land in an equitable manner, and promoting a 
transparent management of public land. This project ended with the reformed Land Policy 
Framework endorsed by the cabinet in 2008. From 2007 the project Land Administration Project 
(LAP) phase I and currently the LAP phase II (financed by the World Bank and the Finish cooperation) 
have supported the PLA in piloting and upscaling land settlement and registration processes in 
Ramallah, Bethlehem and Salfit governorates.  
8.
Despite these efforts the PLA still encounters challenges. Since 2014 the PLA has been 
subordinated the Council of Ministers. It has 10 offices in the West Bank most of which are too poorly 
equipped to effectively fulfil their mandate. In 2014 the registration system covered less than 40% of 
the West Bank (formal Tabu registration) and many registrations do not reflect the current ownership 
status. The registered owner is in some cases deceased and the family failed to register subsequent 
transactions, particularly in the form of inheritances, or the land has been transacted without proper 
registration. In area C 26% of the land has been registered which underlines the important potential 
for progressing in areas A and B where only 9% and 5% respectively, had been registered in 2014 
(FAO, 2015) 147.

Another important player in land recording is the Property Tax Department of the Ministry of 
9.
Finance. Their database of property tax payers (currently 445,000 registered) is used by landowners 
to obtain a verification from the Tax Authority which is required for the land registration process 
managed by the PLA. The Tax Authority also keeps a parallel registry fed by their issuing of 
certificates for transactions of land amounting to 11,000 transactions per year. Going through this 
process managed by the Tax Authority is a cheaper and faster way for landowners to transact land 
and the issued certificates indicates the new buyer as owner (Ikhraj Qeid ownership) even though it is 
not a legally binding registry per sé. These certificates can subsequently be used for the PLA 
managed land registration process.139 
10.
  The main difficulties in land registration, as per the PA itself, are the following: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
High transactions costs, resulting in most transactions still informal 
Costly and cumbersome enforcement of property rights (as judiciary is frequently involved) 
Lack of homogenous and coherent land and property management policies and vision 
Unpredictability of rules and requirements for registration 
Limited trust in the public service provisions 
The existence of easier, cheaper and faster services for conducting transactions such as the 
certificate issued by the Tax Authority or an Irrevocable Powers of Attorney issued by notaries in 
Palestinian embassies abroad or in the West Bank. Even though these are not legally binding 
per sé, they are widely used and leaves the PLA managed land registry incomplete and also 
leaves room for land disputes. 
In addition to the individual land ownership, different types of public and common land 
11.
ownership include: state and municipal land; Waqf (religious endowment) lands which is for the 
benefit of the entire religious communities; and communal land of Bedouin tribes which are under high 
risk of loss due to the occupation.  
  Women's right to land ownership is in most part of the West Bank governed by Islamic 
12.
inheritance laws. These gives a daughter right to at least half of the land that a son receives after the 
dead of their parents and after the death of a husband they are also included among the inheritors, 
but the outcome depends on who the other eventual inheritors are. In practices, however, due to 
culture and the insecure land tenure situation under the occupation, women will often give up their 
land to a brother without or with minimal financial compensation.  
  Water tenure. Access to water and water tenure is also highly impacted by the occupation, 
13.
affecting production and human consumption of both the Palestinian rural and urban population. In 
1967 Israel issued a series of military orders taking full control of almost all shared water resources 
including the aquifers in the occupied territory. Palestinian construction of water infrastructure were 
made subject to obtaining a military issued permit. The around 30 million m3 that the Palestinians 
used to extract from the Jordan river for irrigation was reduced to 0 while Israeli are extracting 650 
million m3 per year148.Currently Palestinians do not manage to extract more than around 20% of the 
estimated annual potential of the aquifers while the Israeli consumption is estimated to overdraw the 
potential annual recharge of the aquifers by 90%149.  
  The following table shows the average recharge capacity and the water allocations in 
14.

  The Oslo Accord article 40 established the Joint Water Committee (JWC) for the management 
of water and wastewater issues in the West bank with equal representation of Israeli and Palestinians. 
The article also establish that no water infrastructure or systems may be constructed without a 
permission from the JWC. However, the JWC is not functioning and almost no permissions are given 
to Palestinians in particular in area C where demolishment of new water infrastructures is also seen. 
Under these conditions it is complex for the Palestinian Water Authority to provide water tenure 
security for farmers in particular in area C and in relation to construction of wells. This has made 
Palestinian farmers very depended on rain water harvesting and water use efficiency in irrigation 
systems. 
Natural resources and their management 
  Water resources. Water is the main issue in the Palestinian natural resources management 
16.
agenda and water access is one main point of negotiation with Israel. West Bank has two main 
sources of freshwater including: the Jordan River and the West Bank's Aquifer. Water resources in the 
West Bank are limited and a key factor in the vulnerability of the population including vulnerability to 
food insecurity. Shared with Israel, the groundwater aquifer is the major source of freshwater supply 
and it provides more than 90-95% of all water supplies distributed as described under the section on 
water tenure above. The main aquifer systems comprised of several deep-seated rock formations 
from the Lower Cretaceous to the recent age. Recharge rates are low due to the limited annual 
average rainfall (100mm-700mm per year dependent on location) and runoffs. The quantity, quality, 
and extraction cost of groundwater, which differ greatly within West Bank despite its small area, vary 
with spatial and vertical hydro-geological variety of the mountain aquifers. West Bank groundwater 
resources are limited and in-sufficient to meet the water demand and need to be combined with 
rainwater runoff harvesting. 
  Deterioration of water resources is considered to be one of the limiting factors for production, 
17.
particularly in arid or semiarid areas. Over-pumping, exhaustion and mismanagement of water 
aquifers is one of the main factors that can affect agricultural production and can result in land 
degradation. The increasing temperatures increases water demand and reduced rainfall will at the 
same time result in lower recharge of the groundwater. Furthermore, over-pumping, and decreased 
recharge of the aquifers causes water and land salinization in the Jordan Valley where fresh and 
saline water co-exist in a natural balance in many aquifer systems, with saline water occurring in the 
lower part of these aquifers. Discordance of hydrostatic balance prevailing between fresh and saline 
water by pumping creates a flow of saline water within freshwater and increasing its salinity150. 
18.
In West Bank the surface water resources are the Jordan River (which has not been accessible 
to the Palestinians since the beginning of the occupation in 1967) and ephemeral wadis flowing on the

Eastern slopes towards the Jordan Valley and the Dead Sea. The Jordan River, the main and only 
permanent river in Palestine and one of the main rivers in the region, has seen a decrease of its 
discharge and a modification of the quality of water over time due to different sources (among others: 
over-pumping, groundwater salinity and high temperatures). Furthermore, dams built upstream during 
the 1960s decreased the flow volumes dramatically, causing changes in the river’s physical and 
ecological characteristics and increasing both the salinity and the organic pollution151. 
19.
  Land degradation. There is a limited availability of high valuable agricultural land in the West 
Bank. Mainly due to high salinity in some areas, low annual rainfall, increasing temperatures, and land 
conversion into urban and rural settlements. Between 1967 and 2015, the number of Israeli 
settlements has increased from 1 to 150 and the number of settlers has increased from 220 in 1990 to 
more than 600 thousand152 in 2015. The lack of space to extend agriculture and the lack of knowledge 
on conservation agriculture draw the farmers to exploit the land damaging the top soil and soil erosion 
affects more than 50% of the land of the West Bank. The loss of grazing land and lack of 
management structures to cope with the ever more limited areas for grazing has led to overgrazed 
rangelands affecting the scattered vegetation and increasing erosion. 
  Salinization. Soil salinization is a problem in particularly in the Jordan Valley of the West Bank. 
20.
Here, the salinity is increasing with time due to several reasons: the nature of soil parent material and 
its underlying substratum composed of lacustrine deposits; the climate which motivates large amount 
of evaporation leaving larger concentrations of salts in the soil. The increased salinity of irrigation 
water is also contributing to this problem, creating more saline soils and in certain cases leading to the 
transformation of some soils to holomorphic type, starting to appear in the Jordan Valley153. 
21.
  Reduction of vegetation cover. Although forest area represents less than 1% of the West 
Bank (about 4900 ha), it is estimated that 23% of this area has been destroyed from 1971 to 1999. 
The majority of this destruction has been caused by the construction of Israeli colonies and military 
camps. Rangeland and natural grassland are also negatively affected in the last three decades due to 
the political situation. Overgrazing is also resulting in reduction of the vegetation cover. The limitation 
of grassland access to Palestinian herders have resulted in intensive grazing to the remaining small 
area that is estimated to be about 15% of the whole rangeland area. In addition to the lack of 
management, the shift in rainfall within the seasons also contributes to the loss of the natural 
vegetation recovery. 
  Soil erosion. Reduction of vegetation cover is one of the main reason for soil erosion in 
22.
Palestine. Grazing and overgrazing leads to the exposure of soils to wind and water erosion. There 
are many steep mountain slopes in the West Bank, on these slopes the soils are washed away and 
the rainfall causes deep rills and gullies. In the Eastern part of West Bank, the major soil constraint is 
soil erosion. High temperatures and low precipitation accelerate the desertification process, increasing 
the risk of erosion. In the Central Highlands, the main soil constraint is erosion in uncultivated hills. 
Terracing the moderately steep hills with considerable amount of soil is often used as practice to 
reduce erosion risks. 
  Pollution. Prevailing pollutants in the West Bank are mainly the result of untreated wastewater 
23.
from villages and settlements lacking wastewater management. This poses risks not just to the 
immediate environment, contaminating streams, springs and other water sources, but also to the

Climate change impacts and vulnerabilities 
  Situated in the Middle East, the West Bank climate is mainly Mediterranean with hot and dry 
24.
during 4 months in summer, and with short winter with rainfall from November to March. Divided into 
four agro-ecological zones, each of which have a different climate. The Jordan Valley is warm and 
very dry in the south; Northern West Bank can be characterized as hot and dry during the summer 
and cool and wet in winter; the Central Highlands have occasional frost, snow and hail. Annual 
rainfalls range from 100 to 700 mm depending on locations154. The mean summer temperatures range 
from 30ºC in Jericho to 22ºC in Hebron, which is 850 metres above sea level. The mean temperatures 
range in winter from 13ºC in Jericho to 7ºC in Hebron.

  Climate Change impact. Following the IPCC, at regional level in West Asia, upward 
temperature trends are notable and robust in recent decades. Also, a weak but non-significant 
downward trend in mean precipitation was observed in recent decades, although with an increase in 
intense weather events. 
26.
  The National Adaptation Plan (NAP) to climate change based on the historical data from 
Palestine reached the conclusion that the average temperatures have risen over the past 100 years 
with very high confidence. There is a very high confidence that maximum and minimum temperatures 
have also increased and high confidence that the number of warm days and nights has increased 
since 1950 and high confidence that extreme temperature events (warm days) have increased in 
frequency. 
  Annual rainfall trend doesn’t show major change and there is very low confidence that annual 
27.
and seasonal rainfall totals have changed in either direction over the past 50 years or so but also very 
low confidence that there has been no change in annual and seasonal rainfall totals. Information 
regarding rainfall trends is then to take with certain precaution. 
  The analysis of the last decades climatic patterns (1960-2016) done by IFAD in 2017155 (see 
28.
annex 1), in support of the design missions, confirms that the climate in the West Bank has already 
changed and that the main trends foreseen by the IPCC and the NAP are becoming evident. In

particular, the study shows an increase in maximum and minimum temperatures all over the country 
(with a trend increase in average annual temperature of 0.27°C/decade for the period 1960-2015), 
more pronounced in summer, but also present the rest of the year. 
  The rainfall trend is not going down nor up significantly for the majority of the West Bank, 
29.
except the Jordan Valley area where the rainfall is significantly decreasing. The analysis shows that a 
cycle of total annual rainfall is present and characterized by two drier years in a row every 6 to 8 
years. This important inter-annual variability in annual precipitation is explained in a few articles156. 
Following those studies, the proximity of the Middle East to Europe indicates that the variability that 
affects rainfall in Europe also affects the Middle East. The studies also demonstrate links between 
Middle East rainfall and circulation over Europe and the Atlantic. Further, a shift in intra annual 
monthly rainfall is observed with an increase and concentration of monthly rainfall in January and a 
decrease in February-March (with a negative trend of around 1mm/year for March) and November-
December. This shift in monthly rainfall is observed for the whole West Bank for the period 1981-
2016. The number of extreme rainfall events (heavy rainfall >50mm/day) is increasing everywhere in 
the West Bank (3.2 to 7.3% increase) for the winter period November-April even though the trend is 
not significant. 
  An erosion study was also conducted to locate the possible main areas subject to water erosion 
30.
from heavy rainfall compiling the daily moderate heavy rainfall events (>20mm/day) with low 
vegetation index (NDVI<0.5) at the time of rainy event and with high slope topography (>15 °). This 
study was then compared with a study led by the Land Research Centre (LRC). Both studies locate 
the sensitive areas mainly in the central band of West Bank from North to South.

  From the above data the following conclusions can be drawn: i) although there is uncertainty of

increase or decrease in annual rainfall, rains are more concentrated and heavier in early winter,

10°W to 40°E) and more specifically for Palestine based on the 5th report of IPCC (AR5). Following 
the summary, there is high confidence in model projections of mean temperature increases in the 
Mediterranean region. The AR5 results suggest that it is very likely that temperatures will continue to 
increase throughout the 21st century over the Eastern Mediterranean and that it is likely that summer 
warming will be more intense than winter warming. The CMIP5 model projections for this century with 
medium confidence is a further reduction in annual mean precipitation in the Eastern Mediterranean 
and an increase in extreme rainfall in winter leading to longer drought periods in summer time. Inter-
annual variation in rainfall is also expected to increase, with very wet years alternating with longer 
multi-annual droughts. It should be noted that the various interacting dynamical influences on 
precipitation of the region results in uncertainty in the magnitude of future precipitation change.

  According to the Initial National Communication Report to the United Nations Framework 
34.
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) published in 2016, important climate change impacts 
affecting rural livelihoods in the West Bank are presented in the table below. 
Table 59: Climate change impacts in West Bank 
Impact of climate change on different farming systems and adaptation capacities. 
35.
Integrated crop (barley and wheat) and livestock systems under rain-fed conditions in the northern 
and southern parts of the West Bank are to some extend drought resistant. However, they are 
increasingly affected by lack of soil water storage capacities and overgrazing and are struggling to 
cope with the increasingly water scare conditions driven by raising temperatures. Orchard (olive, fig, 
almond, grape, peaches) production systems, mostly on terraces and sometimes intercropped with 
annual crops, are found throughout the West Bank where rainfall is higher than 300 mm/year. Olive 
production alone, comprises 15-19% of the total agricultural production. These orchard systems are 
experiencing an increasing need for complementary irrigation in the dry and hotter summers 
exacerbated by low soil water storage capacities. According to the NAP in 2010 heat waves during the 
flowering season reduced the olive production by 20%. Some of the areas used for orchards today 
could in the future fall below 300 mm annual rainfall making them more suitable for grazing and fodder 
shrub production. The eastern slopes, with annual rainfalls below 200mm, and home to Bedouin 
herder communities and are the most affected by increasing temperatures, decreasing rainfalls, and 
loss of herders’ access to their grasslands. All this leads to the lowering of grassland biomass 
productivity and further pressure on the already overgrazed rangelands. Vegetable production in 
greenhouses is found throughout the West Bank in particular in the plains and lower grounds. This 
production is more resilient to higher temperatures but water scarcity is often the limiting factor and 
strong winds can be damaging to the infrastructure. 
  Adaptation capacities. Palestinian farmers have limited access to reliable agro-climatic 
36.
information and early warnings that enable them to anticipate long-term and sudden onset climate 
risks and mitigate potential impacts before they become a disaster. Reliable agro-climatic information 
is needed to: identify what and when to plant, control animal movement, or adjust agriculture practices 
193 
Palestine

Appendix 13:  Contents of the Project Life File 
throughout the season. The PA, in particular the Palestinian Meteorological Department and the MoA, 
lack technical capacities and equipment to adequately measure agro-meteorological data and 
translate these into timely reliable early warnings and early action recommendations for farmers. 
Several national strategies and plans promote adaption to climate change and identify priority areas. 
However, for structural changes in managing climate risks, more information on the long-term 
implications of climate change on agriculture is needed as well as evidence on the returns of 
investment in adaption at the local level. Palestine thus needs additional downscaled projections of 
climate change risks and potential impacts on agriculture as well as evidence on the performance of 
local adaptation and risk reduction practices. If made available this could inform long-term planning 
and investments. Over the past years, substantial progress has been made in mainstreaming climate 
change adaptation and mitigation across sectors. However, this has not translated in accelerated 
actions at local level. Goals and actions identified in national strategies are not yet reflected in clear 
roles and responsibility and resources in the MoA, which results in weak awareness and capacities at 
decentralized levels to take concrete actions. For improved support to assist farmers to adapt, the 
Palestinian extension services requires know-how on farm-level technologies and practices that are 
effective in increasing resilience to the hotter and dryer future with more erratic rainfalls.  
  Knowledge gap. The Extension Services Department (ESD) of the MoA for each Directorate 
37.
has in general good capacity and knowledge to support farmers in their production activities on the 
developed land under the RELAP project. This support will be supplemented by technical assistance 
to farmers provided by the NGOs contracted as service providers for both land development and 
marketing activities. The ESD is subdivided in Divisions specialized in different specific subject areas. 
Some divisions pertinent for the project implementation are: Olive Trees Division, Vegetables Division, 
Live-stock Division, Rain-fed crop Division, and Rural Development Division among others. 
  However, there is a knowledge gap for data gathering and quality control, which makes it 
38.
challenging to improve the resilience effectiveness analysis of different adaptation practices. 
Palestine’s situation makes this particularly difficult. Where resources are limited, there is a need to 
support data collection and enable systematic quality control of the data used in the analysis. 
Technical training to share experience and best practice in the deployment of adaptation practices in 
similar regions (e.g. other parts of the Middle East) and training on systematic monitoring of 
adaptation benefits is also needed to support learning and scaling up. 
Potential project's social, environmental and climate change impacts and risks 
  The West Bank’s climate change adaptation strategy is structured around the NAP developed 
39.
by the Environmental Quality Authority (EQA) and based on the requirements of the UNFCCC’s 
Guidelines for the preparation of national communications from Parties. New strategies to ensure 
environment management and climate change mitigation and adaptation have been developed. 
Nonetheless, the country is still facing a major deficit in terms of climate change adaptation. 
40.
  The climate change scenario (described in the first chapter of this note) will impact natural 
resources (rangelands, water bodies, biomass and others) affecting in particular the agricultural 
production as well as rural infrastructures such as roads and water points and therefore livelihoods of 
smallholders and rural people. Neglecting smallholders’ adaptation in West Bank will contribute to 
socio-economic issues such as rural depopulation (urban population reached 75.3% of the total 
population in 2015 – CIA World Factbook) and unemployment (18% total population with youth 
unemployment even higher at 25%, PCBS 2016) with possible consequences on the country’s 
stability. The project has integrated a clear adaptation strategy at the core of the project deign that 
includes both investments in climate resilient land development and training/capacity building to 
support the adoption of adaptation practices. The project will ensure adaptation by targeting directly 
smallholders as well as supporting institutions (central and local) taking into account the main climatic 
challenges of the target areas.

development, or excessive use of agrochemicals in e.g. greenhouses and other irrigated production) 
will be mitigated by: i) the development, testing and scaling-up of less invasive land development 
practices; ii) the careful consideration of land-use suitability (based on soil types, rainfall and water 
availability and land capabilities), which, combined with market opportunities, will be the basis for 
deciding on land development approaches, production activities and cropping and livestock

approaches as the most important impact of climate change on farmers and rural villages as 
described above. The main component 1 will focus at increasing climate resilience of a diversity of 
farming systems and rural livelihoods by promoting practices for soil moisture conservation, local 
rainwater harvesting and water-use efficiency in complementary irrigation. The resilience of landless 
rural women and unemployed youth will also be supported through applying a climate resilience 
criterion for the selection of micro-businesses to be supported by small investment grants targeting in 
particular these groups. Green Climate Fund financing, is in the process of being mobilized and will be 
invested to ensure climate adaptation and resilience of both infrastructures and livelihood strategies of 
rural poor. With this mainstreamed focus on resilience, the climate risk to the project is assessed to be 
moderate. 
Institutional analysis 
48.
  The MoA performs major duties in the regulation and management of the agricultural sector in 
addition to the oversight, supervision and delivery of certain basic services. The Ministry carries out its 
assigned functions from its headquarters, agricultural and veterinary directorates and offices in the 
governorates and main gatherings. The Directorate of Agriculture of each governorate depends on the 
Deputy Minister of Agriculture and is divided in specialized divisions for implementation of projects as 
represented in the figure below. 
196 
Palestine 
Resilient Land & Resource Management Project 
Final project design report 
Appendix 13:  Social, environmental and climate assessment procedures (SECAP) 
  Beside MoA, there are several ministries and public institutions that play major role in the 
49.
development, regulation and delivery of services to the agricultural sector.  
  The Ministry for Environmental Affairs was created in 1998. It 2002, it became the 
50.
Environmental Quality Authority (EQA). MENA initiated the 1999 Palestinian Environmental Law, 
which provides the basis for environmental decisions and secondary legislation. The EQA became the 
Ministry of the Environment for the period 2012-2013, and then became EQA again. Since, it has 
been reporting to the Prime Minister. Its mandate is to ensure the protection of the environment, 
biodiversity and natural vegetation; to conduct environmental assessments, licensing in cooperation, 
and coordination with the competent authorities; to conduct awareness and environmental education 
activities. EQA has developed among others – and with active participation of national stakeholders – 
the National Adaptation Plan to Climate Change and also the Initial Communication Report to the 
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (submitted to UNFCCC secretariat on 11 
November 2016). EQA thus participates in the development of specifications and standards related to 
the environment and proposes and develops instructions and technical requirements for environment 
protection. EQA is the National Designated Authority (NDA) to Green Climate Fund and is also 
working to attract funding for environmental projects from International Financing Institutions. EQA 
submitted the Nationally Determined Contributions report and its annexes to UNFCCC on 21 August 
2017. 
  Additional institutions provide some services for agriculture and environment protection. 
51.
Palestinian Water Authority (PWA) regulates the management of water sector and sanitation in 
Palestine and achieves an equitable distribution among different sectors. It optimizes the use of water 
resources to ensure water and food security and economic development of Palestine and manages 
wastewater treatment. Ministry of National Economy (MoNE) regulates the trade of agricultural inputs 
and products, and promotes local products. It also supervises and holds commercial conventions and 
protocols, registers companies and related activities, promotes exports and prepares specifications 
and standards. Ministry of Local Government (MoLG) plans regional, municipal and rural schemes 
and oversees the wholesale markets and slaughterhouses. Ministry of Labor (MoL) registers 
agricultural cooperatives and develops strategies and laws for cooperative work.  
  Several government ministries are involved in the fight against climate change and 
52.
desertification, including the EQA (leading it), the Palestinian Energy and Natural Resources Authority, 
the PWA, and the Ministry of Finance and Planning. The Ministry of Local Government, , the MoA and 
the Ministry of Health are working to advance environmental causes. The distribution of roles and 
responsibilities between different stakeholders in the environmental field is still unclear (Ministry of 
Health, MLOG, PWA, MoA).  
  The Palestinian Environmental Protection Agency was created in 1994 and was given the 
53.
mandate to prepare for the multilateral negotiations. Later the Ministry of Planning and International 
Co-operation created the Environmental Planning Directorate within its structure. In alignment with 
national priorities, the Palestinian authorities agreed on ratifying 16 multilateral environmental 
conventions upon which the PA has signed three conventions and one protocol; (i) Basal Convention 
on the Control of Trans boundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal, (ii) 
Convention of Biological Diversity (CBD) and the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety to the Convention 
of Biological Diversity, and (iii) UN framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). In addition, 
several national strategies and action plans were set. The EQA is working to develop the bylaws 
needed to be in alignment with the conventions they ratified. 
Local authorities are not in charge of developing environmental policy but are entrusted with 
54.
implementing it as part of their legal responsibilities.  
  There are several Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) and Civil Society Organizations 
55.
(CSOs) involved in agriculture and environmental protection such as the Palestinian Agricultural Relief 
Committees (PARC), and the Palestinian Environmental NGOs Network (PENGON). NGOs and 
CSOs have played an essential role in agricultural development before and after the establishment of

donors’ funds is channelled directly through them. Various expert organisations and environmental 
NGOs also operate in the field of water management.  
  Capacity development. Following the Initial Communication Report to the United Nations 
56.
Framework Convention on Climate Change (EQA, 2016), Relevant government institutions, such as 
the Environment Quality Authority (EQA), Ministry of Agriculture (MOA), Palestinian Water Authority 
(PWA), Ministry of Transportation (MOT), Ministry of Finance and Planning4 (MOFP), Ministry of 
National Economy (MONE), Palestinian Energy and Natural Resources Authority (PENRA), and the 
Ministry of Health (MOH) have limited systems, capacity and expertise to address challenges related 
to climate change efficiently. 
57.
  The project considers capacity development and institutional strengthening two pillars of its 
theory of change. Both component will ensure capacitation of both institutions and beneficiaries. The 
objective of the process is to reduce the climate change adaptation deficit in rural areas. The project 
will ensure capacitation in the following domains: 
  Capacity building of technical offices of rural municipalities and villages to ensure climate

  Mitigation of vulnerabilities. The project is applying a resilience model to identify adaptation

actions to be supported and develop a scorecard to monitor changes in resilience for project 
beneficiary households. The population’s future well-being in the West Bank depends on the 
resilience of communities, cities and ecosystems, and resilience provides a critical point of integration 
for adaptation strategies. Building resilience is about the suitable actions taken at present time so that 
the impact of inevitable shocks and stresses are minimized and the rebound accelerated.  
  Resilience is the ability to cope with adverse shocks and stresses, and to adapt and learn to 
61.
live with changes and uncertainty. The ‘ability to resist, recover from, or adapt to the effects of a shock 
or a change’161. ‘Resilience is a long-term approach, not only focussed on the ability to bounce back 
but also integrating adaptation and transformation while undergoing change’162.  
62.
Indeed, building resilience delivers near-term economic benefits and jobs, while making 
everyone better prepared when a shock hits. There may be upfront costs to get this done, but money 
will be saved later: It costs sometimes more to rebuild in the wake of a disaster than to build in a way 
that can withstand the shock. Resilience can be approached at different levels, such as at the level of 
agroecosystems or productive territories, countries, communities or families, and facing different 
crises and shocks.  
  To a great extent, increasing resilience can be achieved by reducing vulnerabilities and 
63.
increasing adaptive capacity. This can be achieved by reducing exposure, reducing sensitivity and 
increasing adaptive capacity, for every type of risk. The project uses a resilience model focused on 
poor rural families. This model helps to define the strategies of project interventions to support the 
rural poor in improving the management of natural resources and adaptive capacities to climate 
change.  
64.
  The model followed in the project is based on an identification and grouping of factors that 
contribute to the households’ capacities to face climate related stresses and shocks, reducing their 
effects and to recover quickly avoiding persistent adverse effects. The model is explained in more 
detail in the following figure.

 
 
the depth of the impact (in green) that shocks (left graph) and stresses (right graph) have on 
households; 
the ability of households to recover (in blue) after a shock (left graph) or adjust to stresses 
(right graph). 
  The depth of the impact depends on factors such as; i) management of natural resources; ii) 
66.
diversification of crops, income, and livelihoods; iii) quality of the diet (health); iv) road access and 
transportation and other services; v) quality and location of assets (infrastructure, fields an

social networks and/or producer organizations; viii) knowledge and skills to understand climate trends, 
risks and potential impacts on livelihoods and effectiveness of available adaptation options.  
  On the other hand, the capacity and speed of recovery and adjustments depends on factors

according to the presence or not of the resilience factors and countermeasures. When a stress or 
shock occurs, the depth of the impact may vary and the recovery may bring the households to a 
different level of welfare compared to the initial state depending on the factors of resilience. Finally, a 
systematic learning process after a crisis or shock or as part of evaluating the effectiveness of 
implemented approaches to cope with increased stresses, is an additional factor in strengthening the 
resilience to reconstruct and adopt each time something better based on the lessons learned.

area comprises Areas B and C in 6 governorates of the West Bank163. In each governorates, the 
project will seek to select the areas with the highest incidence of poverty. Other criteria for final village 
selection include beneficiary interest, the existence of potential land to be developed with 
opportunities for linking produce to markets, and high potentials for reducing climate change 
vulnerabilities and generating adaptation benefits. Also, in the selection of land development 
beneficiaries and their lands the project will seek to identify poorer households and plots which are 
contiguous, in order to allow for a more landscape-based approach.

village engagement and planning process in selected villages to identify resilient land development 
approaches and practices and how this process will take into account the inclusion of more vulnerable 
and poor households, land-use suitability and adaptation measures to address current and future 
climate change and variability risks. The different land-uses and farming systems and related 
adaptation measures to be included in land development activities are presented in table 18 in 
appendix 4. This initial selection of farming systems was done during the two design missions jointly 
with the MOA after meeting with other agencies, NGOs and producers associations. The selection 
covers a broad set of systems present in the West Bank as well as new systems and approaches 
proven to have high adaptation benefits and which needs to be further up-scaled.

to come up with a broader selection of land development than orchards on terraces covering a 
diversity of farming systems and livelihoods which will provide for more resilience. Also for the 
practices used for terraced orchards has been discussed in order to come up with approaches which 
are more cost effective and less environmental invasive in removing topsoil during the construction 
process. To further push for more alternatives for land development and identify the ones with more 
adaptation benefits, the project include a subcomponent (1.1) on testing and monitoring with farmers 
and livestock keepers the different land development approaches and practices for different agro-
ecological zones and livelihoods.

M&E Officer (and other PMU staff if needed) should also be trained to use the GPS data collected 
with GIS software, to create maps and to analyse changes in time. The monitoring will be focused on 
vegetation index for activities related to land development and on the construction of infrastructure 
(roads, water harvesting techniques …) through satellite imagery (i.e. Landsat, Sentinel) and pictures 
taken on the field before and after the activities. The geo-referenced information should be gathered 
in a KMZ file (Google Earth) by component and subcomponent. As reported in the PDR the whole 
project will be georeferenced as was its design. A simple resilience index will be developed during the 
final design mission to monitor the changes in beneficiaries resilience.
