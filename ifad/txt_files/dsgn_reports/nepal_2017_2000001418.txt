Executive Summary1 
1. 
Background. IFAD has been amongst the Development Partners (DPs) engaged with the 
Government of Nepal (GoN) in the preparation of the 2014 Agriculture Development Strategy (ADS)2. 
The ADS sets a new and dynamic direction for driving agricultural sector growth in Nepal. IFAD and 
the GoN propose to apply the ADS principles to the development of the Agriculture Sector 
Development Programme (ASDP), building off the successful experience of the IFAD-financed High 
Value Agriculture Project (HVAP) and other government and donor-funded, market-oriented 
Programmes in Nepal. The ASDP will be implemented within the framework of Nepal’s Federal states 
governance system, authorised under Schedule 4 of the new Constitution of Nepal adopted on 20th 
September 2015 and currently being established. These constitutional reforms involve a high level of 
State subsidiarity to a new municipal/ward structure, which will be responsible for agriculture and rural 
development in Nepal. 
Rationale. The justification for the ASDP stems from a number of elements: (i) a favourable 
2. 
policy and institutional framework originated by the new Constitution of and the 2014 ADS, which 
places greater emphasis on market (value chain)-driven agriculture development; (ii) a significant 
stock of knowledge on value chain development produced by a number of projects, most of which will 
be completed during 2018, as a source of good practices and lessons learnt for this new operation; 
and (iii) the opportunity of scaling up the HVAP approach through (a) the replication of proven value 
chain interventions in a larger, including more remote, geographic area (enabled by improved rural 
infrastructure, notably the expanding district road corridors), (b) the institutionalisation of a pluralistic 
extension service aligned with the new Constitution of Nepal and associated state federalisation 
process and implementation of constitutional provisions in agriculture and rural development, and the 
ADS (notably the Value Chain Development Program (VADEP) and Decentralized Extension, 
Science, Technology and Education Program (DESTEP) flagship programmes); and (c) improving 
access to value chain financing, without which VC investments find difficulty with scaling-up.  
3. 
The ASDP will commence at an important juncture in Nepal’s shift to a federal-state structure 
under its new Constitution of Nepal. This process has seen the number of rural administrative units 
reduced by up to 80 per cent, the removal of districts as an administrative entity, a direct 
administrative line between state governments and their local governments and direct budget 
transfers from treasury to local governments3. In line with this constitutionally-driven restructuring, and 
the recommendations of the ADS, the agricultural sector is likely to see the consolidation of its sector-
specific ministries (agriculture, co-operatives, livestock and land) and a shift in the responsibility of the 
consolidated Ministry from service delivery to planning, policy formulation, regulatory control and 
monitoring and evaluation. It is expected, with the establishment of the appropriate structures and 
governance at the State and Local Governments, ASDP’s implementation in time, would be under the 
purview of State 6.  This will be accompanied by increased farmer participation in the planning, 
decision making, implementation, and monitoring of the strategy. These developments are consistent 
with a more market-driven agriculture development approach as demonstrated under the HVAP, with 
increasing dependence on private rather than public input and technical support services. Overlaying 
these reforms are the challenges of the feminization of Nepali agriculture due to rural male exodus, a 
high level of malnutrition in rural areas and the growing climate risk. 
4.  With only a small proportion of agriculture production in Nepal flowing through structured value 
chains, including in the HVAP catchment districts, there is ample scope for adding value to farm 
products, improving productivity and quality and expanding markets. Building on HVAP successes, 
1. Mr Garry Smith, Team Leader; Ms Girija Srinivasan, Rural Finance Specialist; Mr Geoff Dyce, Economist, Mr Deep Joshi, Institutions and 
Communities Specialist; Mr Hari Dhakal, Procurement Specialist; Mr Sanjeev Shrestha, Value Chain specialist; Mr. Avinash Chandra, Economist; 
Ms Lakshmi Moola, IFAD Country Programme Manager. Mr Pradeep Shrestha advised the mission on financial management matters; Mr. 
Dilaram Bhandari, Joint Secretary, Policy and International Cooperation Coordination Division, MoAD; Mr. Rajendra Bhari, Joint Secretary and 
Project Manager HVAP, MoAD; Mr. Rudra Shrestha, Under Secretary, MoAD; Mr. Binod Bhattarai, Under Secretary, MoAD and Mr. Chitra 
Rokaya, Under Secretary, HVAP, MOAD. 
2 It is expected that the ADS will be revised to accommodate federalism. Changes within the ADS, and related changes to ASDP, will be mutually 
agreed during implementation.

Final programme design report 
the ASDP proposes to expand the HVAP Programme area from 6 to 10 districts in State 64, in parallel 
with an expanding district road network, while better integrating Programme processes into local 
administrative systems and public and private services. The Programme will also deepen/intensify 
engagement with more remote communities within the continuing 6 HVAP districts, linked to an 
expansion of formal and informal district and village roads and village trails in those districts. The 
holistic, value chain-led approach will facilitate the development of a shared understanding and 
common vision among the actors working in the same sub-sector, building trust among them and 
enabling more effective business relationships between agribusiness and producer groups and co-
operatives, as well as building the capacity of these actors, across different value chains, to efficiently 
meet customers’ quality and price expectations. This will be supported by modest risk-compensating, 
programme supported, co-investment that will be progressively replaced by financial services as 
banking and MFI lending capacity and innovative value chain-oriented loan and risk management 
products are developed with Programme support. Specific strategies will be implemented for poor 
household and landless rural resident participation in value chains, including improved access to rural 
infrastructure and finance and strengthened farmer-led institutions. Through co-financing of public and 
collective goods market-oriented infrastructure (multi-use water supply, small-scale irrigation, village-
to-farm and village-to-road head access, commodity storage, markets, etc.), the ASDP will avail rural 
households with the physical resources needed to engage in high value climate-adapted agriculture 
production and marketing. Programme support to the planned restructured extension system under 
the new Federal administrative system will empower communities to both coordinate public extension 
delivery and develop local, private fee-based advisory services, including farmer-to-farmer (F2F) and 
enterprise-to-farmer (E2F) advice. These developments will be enveloped by programmes supporting 
climate change adaptation and women’s inclusion, with women forming 2/3rds of beneficiaries, and 
improved household food access and nutrition awareness. 
Programme area and target group. The Programme will be implemented in Surkhet, Dailekh, 
5. 
Salyan, Jajarkot, Kalikot, Jumla, Mugu, Dolpa, Humla and Rukum (western) districts in State 6 of 
Nepal. The four highlighted districts are incremental to the HVAP area and will be integrated into the 
Programme in line with the development of the (i) Chhinchu-Jajarkot–Dolpa; (ii) Surkhet-Kalikot-
Jumla-Mugu; (iii) Surkhet- Dailekh road corridors; and (iv) Mid-hills highway. The Programme will 
commence immediately in the six existing HVAP districts and in Mugu and Rukum. Only sub-
component 4 activities will commence in Dolpa and Humla initially and the rest will be  integrated as 
the road access improves. The Programme Coordination Office (PCO) will be based at Birendranagar 
in Surkhet district, while three corridor-based coordination units will be established for technical 
backstopping, field level coordination and programme monitoring and supervision. Programme 
activities will be closely aligned with other donor financed projects in the State5. 
The Programme will target smallholder producers and landless rural people6 (value chain 
6. 
labour, small livestock, etc.) interested to engage in targeted value chain activities. Women will form 
2/3rds of the Programme beneficiaries and disadvantaged households including Dalits, Janajatis, 
Muslims, youth, landless and other disadvantaged groups will be specifically targeted for Programme 
inclusion (25 per cent target). The Programme will develop specific mechanisms for poor households 
to be able to join appropriate value chains, however, poor and marginalised households will 
definitively benefit from expanding local agriculture employment opportunities associated with value 
chain-driven growth. It is expected that the ASDP will serve around 35,000 direct beneficiaries 
(producer households and agri-industry entrepreneurs and employees) and around an additional 
40,000 indirect household beneficiaries (through public infrastructure, financial services and 
agricultural extension development). HVAP beneficiaries will not be eligible for grant co-financing 
under the ASDP. 
Partnerships. IFAD has extensively consulted with partners during the design process, 
7. 
including bi-lateral meetings with SDC, USAID, DFiD, DANIDA, EU, ADB, World Bank, WFP and 
4 One district, Acham, presently engaged under the HVAP, now falls in State 7 and would not be included in the ASDP. 
5  Including, inter alia, SDC-financed NASDP, NAMDP and Small Irrigation projects are also running in Kalikot, Dailekh and Jajarkot; 
DFID-financed RAP III, USAID-financed Suaahara II and Kisan projects

Final programme design report 
FAO.  Through these consultations, a collaborative partnership has emerged with the SDC funded 
NASDP, implemented by Helvetas Swiss Inter-Cooperation (HSI).  SDC will support the ASDP, 
providing a grant of USD 3.0 million for TA implemented by HSI to expand the coverage of NASDP to 
ASDP impact areas in all 10 districts, with specific focus on organising and capacitating farmer groups 
and co-operatives and provision of pluralistic services to farmer’s groups linked to the value chains 
selected under ASDP. SDC will transfer TA fund to HSI directly. 
The Goal of the Programme is to: Contribute to the achievement  of Nepal's SDG 17 and SDG 
8. 
28 targets by reducing poverty and nutrition insecurity amongst women and men in hill and mountain 
areas of State 6. The Development Objective is to: contribute to the achievement of Nepal’s SDG 89 
target through sustainable improvement in the income and food security of smallholders and 
disadvantaged rural groups10 involved in commercially-oriented production and marketing systems in 
selected high value agricultural value chains. 
Programme Components. The Programme will have two components: (i) Value chain 
9. 
development, and (ii) Programme coordination.  
10.  Component 1, Value chain Development would include four sub-components (Outcomes): 
(i) Inclusive and sustainable agriculture value chains expanded and diversified; (ii) Market-oriented 
infrastructure functional; (iii) Rural financial services for value chain development strengthened; and 
(iv) Agriculture services sustainably support innovation and value chain development. 
11.  Sub-component 1: Inclusive and sustainable agriculture value chains expanded and diversified. 
This outcome would include two outputs: (i) identify and assess profitable high-value agriculture value 
chains; and (ii) co-finance agricultural value chain development: 
o  Output 1.1: Identify and assess profitable high-value agriculture value chains. This output 
includes two activities: (i) Strategic investment plan (SIP); and (ii) DCC-convened Multi-
Stakeholders Consultative Platform: 
o  Strategic investment plan: To identify profitable, climate change adapted value chain 
development pathways, the Programme would conduct a comprehensive financial, 
economic and value chain analysis of both existing (to confirm their continuing financial and 
economic viability) and potentially new value chains and associated wholesale markets in 
the Programme districts. In addition to the 6 value chains established under the HVAP11, the 
SIP would also evaluate, milk, citrus fruit, walnut, seed potato, honey and high nutrition crop 
(grain legume, finger millet, buckwheat) value chains in State 6. The SIP analysis of the goat 
and OSV value chains have been completed with both demonstrating financially and 
economically viable investments. Honey, milk and seed potato value chain SIPs will be 
prepared before Programme effectiveness. The Programme will avoid duplication with other 
value chain initiatives in Programme districts. 
o  DCC-convened Multi-Stakeholders Consultative Platform (MSP). The Programme would 
facilitate the establishment of Multi-Stakeholders Consultative Platforms (MSP) to support 
specific value chain development. MSPs would also inform the selection of prospective new 
value chains and the SIP process.  MSPs would bring together the key stakeholders, 
including farmer representatives, private sector actors (traders, processors, input suppliers, 
investors, finance institutions) and government actors (municipal governance, research, 
extension) engaged in the development of specific value chains, with a view to 
strengthening private and public-private relationships across the value chains, promoting 
innovation and providing a conducive environment/space for the brokerage of financial 
agreements between value chain stakeholders. While initially convened by the respective 
DCCs, MSPs would be assisted to become self-governing.

o  Output 1.2: Co-financed agricultural value chain development. This output would include three 
activities: (i) co-investment both on farm and at agribusiness level; (ii) value chain-led 
participatory and applied production and processing technology development; and (iii) tailored 
multi-disciplinary capacity building. 
o  Co-investment both on-farm and at agribusiness level. The Programme would establish a 
competitively allocated Value Chain Development Fund (VCDF) providing risk-based co-
financing to catalyze private investments by agri-enterprises and farm households into the 
SIP-prioritised value chains and associated wholesale markets, with particular attention paid 
to the inclusion of poor, disadvantaged and women-headed households in the value chain 
catchment area. The priorities for the investment agenda in each value chain would be 
identified through the associated MSP. Co-investment would be capped at USD 100,000 for 
agribusinesses, USD 10,000 for lowland/mid-hills farmer groups, USD 12,000 for mountain 
area farmer groups (inflation adjusted). Local Bodies would manage the selection of farmer 
groups and make recommendations to the PCO for financing. PCO-approved co-financing 
investments, to agribusinesses, exceeding USD 50,000 would require IFAD no-objection. 
Additional funding up to 250 per cent of these amounts could be exceptionally approved 
subject to IFAD and MoAD no-objection; 
o  The level of co-investment would vary by location and purpose, priced to reflect the 
measured risk to the "innovator" investors, but set at levels that are unlikely to distort 
markets. For agribusinesses, co-investment would be set at 30 per cent of the total 
investment value in the mid-hill municipalities and 40 per cent in mountainous municipalities. 
Co-investment of farmer groups would be set at 50 per cent. Once “innovator” co-
investments are proven to be commercially viable, co-investments for that value chain 
segment would be phased out, subject to improved access to rural financial services. The 
percentage of co-investment offered and other terms would be actively monitored and 
revised if necessary based on actual uptake. The competitive co-investment allocation 
process would reward enterprise and farmer group business proposals that offer higher 
levels of own contribution, better value addition and greater engagement of poor and 
disadvantaged people; 
o  Value chain-led participatory and applied technology development. The design missions 
have identified significant technical constraints in the targeted value chains. Up to 20 per 
cent of enterprise and farmer group co-financing could be used to support participatory 
action research and associated technology transfer, including farmer-to-famer and 
enterprise-to-farmer advisory services. Additional funds are available to MSPs to address 
technical constraints and opportunities mutually identified by MSP stakeholders.  
o  Tailored multi-disciplinary capacity building. The Programme would provide value chain 
actors with specific training based on capacity building needs identified by the MSPs. This 
could include in-field and residential training courses; experiential regional study tours, etc.  
12.  Sub-component 2: Market-oriented public and community infrastructure functional. This 
outcome has one output: (i) co-financed community market infrastructure: 
o  Output 2.1: Co-financed public and community market infrastructure. In alignment with the SIP, 
the Programme would allocate funds for market-linked infrastructure investments that provide 
public good and collective12 benefits essential to targeted commodity value chain engagement 
and/or climate change adaptation. Public or collective market-linked infrastructure investment 
schemes would be identified and prioritized through: (i) participatory community planning; 
(ii) the MSP process; and (iii) their alignment with Nagarpalika and Gaunpalika (Municipality) 
infrastructure plans. Investments could include, inter alia, village and farm access roads, 
commodity storage, market/collection centres, ponds, small-scale irrigation and multi-purpose 
village water supply. The Programme would be structured to cater for innovative demands as 
12 Semi-public good

they emerge. For public infrastructure (village roads, trials, markets, etc.) funds would be 
advanced to Municipalities by the PCO on the basis of participatory Municipality investment 
plans incorporated into the ASDP annual work plan and budget. Collective goods infrastructure 
would be primarily built through community action, with beneficiary contributions in cash and in 
kind13, unless their scale or complexity required contracting. All infrastructure investments 
would be climate change adaptive.  
o  Co-financing of construction costs of public and collective good infrastructure works would be in 
accordance with the accompanying table. PCO-approved co-financing investments exceeding 
USD 50,000 would require no-objection from IFAD. The Programme would, wherever 
practicable, use force account processes for community infrastructure investments, designed to 
create local jobs, while recognising that most major infrastructure investments would require 
some machine support. 
13.  Sub-component 3:  Rural  financial  services  for  value  chain  development  strengthened.  The 
mission has confirmed that there is adequate liquidity for agriculture sector finance in the Programme 
area, however, there are significant institutional and product shortfalls. Co-operatives require capacity 
development  both  as  institutions  and  for  dispensing  agriculture  credit.  MFI  loan  products  are  poorly 
structured for agricultural lending and insurance as a risk management instrument is yet to reach rural 
producers  and  requires  product  development.  This  outcome  would  include  two  outputs:  (i) Rural 
financial services development; and (ii) Support to credit access: 
o  Output 3.1: Rural financial services development. This output would comprise of three activities: 
(i) Product innovation for value chain financing and loan risk management; (ii) Capacity 
development of co-operatives; and (iii) Improving insurance uptake. 
o  Product innovation for value chain financing and loan risk management; The Programme 
would provide technical assistance to MFIs/private banks intending to implement value 
chain financing solutions. This would include product development consistent with the 
prioritised value chains and developing protocols for products comprising size, rate of 
interest, collateral and repayment mechanisms. The Programme would also capacitate 
banks and MFIs through training & exposure to value chain financing products offered by 
regional financial institutions.  
o  Capacity development of co-operatives; Co-operatives working in the Programme area 
would be facilitated to consolidate/amalgamate to improve their capacity to cater to member 
needs and also be credit worthy for wholesale bank loans. The capacity development would 
include institutional and business development training and on-site mentoring. Additional 
support for financial software installation and computing equipment would also be provided 
on a cost share basis. The Programme would engage national institutions such as NACCFL 
to support credit cooperative development. 
o  Improving insurance uptake; The Programme would work with the Insurance Board and 
insurance companies to develop/modify insurance products and support the development of 
a rural insurance agent network, through local service providers, for distribution of 
appropriate insurance products to farm households.  
o  Output 3.2: Support to credit access. The HVAP-developed business literacy training 
programme would be expanded under the ASDP to include business skills, risk management, 
savings and loan management, insurance literacy and entrepreneurship. The Programme 
would also provide financial mentoring to farm households or groups seeking co-financing. 
Financial literacy would be a prerequisite for farmer group value chain co-financing. 
14.  Sub-component 4: Agriculture services sustainably support innovation and value chain 
development. This outcome includes two outputs: (i) Participatory and pluralistic extension services 
and strengthened farmer groups; and (ii) Women’s empowerment and household nutrition: 
13 Markets owned by group, cooperatives and agri-businesses will be treated as ‘private’and have to contribute 15% 
cash whereas the markets owned by Municipalities will be treated as ‘public goods’ and hence no cash contribution 
required. Value of land will be considered as cash contribution.

Agriculture Sector Development Programme 
Final programme design report 
o  Output 4.1 Participatory and pluralistic extension services and strengthened farmers 
organizations. Building on emerging positive trends in HVAP, the Programme, with SDC-
financed HSI Technical Assistance (TA), would support the establishment and capacitation of 
MAU at the level of Municipality, and CAESCs at Ward level. Both would be chaired by elected 
officials and have strong agriculture sector stakeholder participation. These institutions would 
facilitate the delivery of extension services and the development of participatory planning 
processes that enable the MAU to represent farmers’ interests in municipal and provincial 
planning processes. The MAU would provide feedback to the Municipal administration and 
through the Municipality to the District Coordinating Committee (DCC) concerning the provision 
of agriculture support services, assist in the formation of farmer associations, strengthen 
farmers’ perspectives in evidence-based policy formation, and inform farmers about services 
and entitlements. MAU representatives would participate in MSPs for value chains operating in 
their area; 
o  Through the MAU-CAESC network, the Programme would foster collaboration between public 
and private actors in the delivery of agricultural services, particularly in value chain production 
pockets and for food security (home gardens, nutrition sensitive value chains, multi-purpose 
water supply) amongst poorer households. This would be achieved through: (i) co-financing, in 
partnership with municipalities and communities, the development of CAESCs to enable them 
to facilitate pluralistic extension approaches, as envisaged in the ADS; (ii) the training of 
agricultural service managers at municipal level, public extension agents at ward level, and 
community-identified, certified lead resource persons (LRPs) in extension management and 
delivery methodologies and technologies relevant to food security and the value chains in the 
locality; and (iii) capacity building for agro-vet input supply management and staff. Rural Youth 
who are interested in becoming Junior Technician Assistants (JTAs) or agro-vet service 
providers would be provided with training and certification through accredited government 
approved courses. A women’s quota of minimum 25 per cent would be kept for the vocational 
trainings and 15 per cent for disadvantaged groups14. 
o  The sustainability of the outcomes of the programme depends, inter alia, on farmers’ ability to 
remain profitably engaged with the value chains. Towards this, the Programme would organise 
farmers into viable, self-managed groups and co-operatives so that they can continue to 
operate as sustainable and growing businesses and also become anchors for new farmers to 
join the value chains. Drawing on the HVAP experience of promoting farmers groups and co-
operatives, and the extensive experience of developing groups and co-operatives in Nepal and 
other neighbouring South Asian countries, ASDP will support formation and strengthening of 
farmers’ groups where such groups do not exist, strengthening and where necessary 
restructuring existing groups and consolidating mature groups into large scale commodity co-
operatives to facilitate scale economies for sharing services and infrastructure, accessing credit 
and taking up viable value addition activities, such as sorting, grading, etc. 
o  Output 4.2 Women’s empowerment and household nutrition. The Programme would train 
Business Literacy Facilitators (BLFs) to implement targeted interventions designed to empower 
women and adolescent girls, both within their households and in their wider communities15. 
Marginalised and female headed households would be given priority. In pursuit of improved 
nutrition, the Programme would support implementation of the government behavioural change 
communication (BCC) initiative on post-open defecation free (ODF) villages and the nutrition 
awareness programme amongst Programme-targeted communities, including linking 
households in the Programme areas into the USAID funded Suaahara. Special emphasis would 
be given to the adolescent female children. Women construction workers would be paid on par 
with their male counterparts and there would be provisions for social safeguards for the 
14 Dalits, Janajatis, Muslims, landless, etc. 
15 The Programme would introduce the Household Methodologies approach to women’s empowerment.

community infrastructure. Simple drudgery reduction technology for women would be 
introduced to the agricultural groups. 
15.  Component 2, Programme Management. A PCO would be maintained in Birendranagar, 
Surkhet. The PCO would facilitate Programme implementation both by working through private and 
public-sector implementation agencies (MSPs, Municipalities, MAUs, CAESCs, Agro-vets, LRPs, etc.) 
and through more direct implementation for activities such as rural financial services. With SDC grant 
funding,  HSI will be a co-implementer of the agricultural services programme. Key Programme staff, 
based at the Programme Coordination office in Birendranagar, would include a Programme 
Coordinator, a senior agriculture officer (deputed from the State Agriculture office), a funds and 
contract specialist, an account officer and support staff, a planning officer and technical staff covering 
value chain development, engineering, institutional development, rural finance, climate change, 
gender and nutrition, monitoring and evaluation (M&E) and knowledge management (KM), and 
information technology. The Programme would also establish field teams working along the four main 
road corridors having business, engineering, social/gender, finance institution and M&E/KM skills. An 
ASDP Liaison office would be maintained in Kathmandu. The Programme would be governed by a 
Programme Steering Committee (PSC), chaired by the Secretary, MoAD.

is USD 68.2 million, of which USD 38.2 million (USD 28.2 million from 2016-18 PBAS and 
USD 10 million from cancelled funds of ISFP) would be financed by IFAD as a highly concessional 
loan; an IFAD grant of USD 1.8 million, an SDC grant of USD 3.0 million, GoN counterpart funds are 
estimated at USD 11.5 million (of which USD 8.3 million constitutes forgone taxes and duties); co-
financing from Municipalities for infrastructure co-financing is estimated at USD 3.4 million; private 
sector co-financing is estimated at USD 3.5 million; farm beneficiary contributions (in cash and kind), 
is estimated at USD 6.7 million. 
18.  EIRR and NPV. The overall ASDP project economic net present value (ENPV) is 
USD 95.61 million at a 10% discount rate16 . The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) is 
24 per cent. The benefit cost ratio (BCR) of 1.6 indicating a return of approximately 1.6 dollars for 
every dollar invested. Both results indicate that the project is a worthwhile investment17.

Agriculture Sector Development Programme 
Final programme design report 
I.  Strategic context and rationale 
A.
  Country and rural development context 
1.
Economic Development. Economic growth began to slow in Fiscal Year (FY) 2013/2014, 
principally due to depressed agricultural production and low investment and then fell sharply to 0.6 per 
cent in 2015/16 due to the earthquake disaster and an economic blockade. It is now projected to pick 
up substantially to 4.6 per cent in 2016/17 and then to 4.8 per cent in 2017/18, due to both stronger 
agricultural sector performance and the ongoing reconstruction effort, which will also generate higher 
levels of investment and support domestic consumption25. Agriculture accounts for almost 1/3rd of 
GDP. Agricultural sector growth in FY2012 reached 4.6 per cent, but sector performance then fell to 
1.1 per cent in FY 2013 due to a combination of weak monsoons, inadequate supply of agricultural 
inputs during the peak planting seasons, rose slightly to 2.9 per cent in 2014 in response to better 
monsoon rains, and back to 1.9 per cent in 2015due to the earthquake disruption. Agriculture is 
expected to grow in 2017 on the back of average monsoon rainfall. Growth in the industrial sector 
(which accounts for about 13 per cent of GDP) has historically been held back by a lack of adequate 
electricity and other supply-side bottlenecks. The 2015 earthquake further slowed industrial activities, 
with the severely affected districts accounting for about 20 per cent of total manufacturing 
establishments, manufacturing jobs, and manufacturing value-added in the country. Similarly, nearly a 
quarter of the total hydropower produced in the country is affected by the earthquake. Industrial 
growth in 2016 was projected to be -6.3 per cent. There has, however, been significant growth in the 
services sector in recent years, strengthened by the continuing growth in remittance transfers. It is 
projected that services output will grow by an average annual rate of 5.6 per cent in 2016/17 and 
2017/18 as the sector recovers from the adverse effects of the 2015 earthquakes.  
2.
Strong consumption growth rather than investment is driving economic activities, with both 
public and private investment weak in 2016, with private sector investment particularly constrained by 
the high level of policy uncertainty. Private sector investment is expected to improve in 2017 and 
several large infrastructure Programmes are likely to accelerate economic growth in coming years26. 
Despite the timely approval of the budget, key capital Programmes have not moved as anticipated, 
demonstrating shortcomings in preparation and implementation that affect the broader capital 
Programme portfolio of the government. Owing to high spending pressures, the budget will remain in 
deficit in fiscal years 2016/17 and 2017/18 (July 16th-July 15th). However, improving revenue 
collection will keep the budget shortfall at a manageable level. Consumer prices will rise by an 
average of 8.4 per cent a year in 2017-18, as food price pressures will remain high. Supply 
disruptions, owing to the country's poor road infrastructure and the impact of the 2015 earthquakes, 
will continue to put upward pressure on prices. Import price inflation will also be strong in the forecast 
period. 
The World Bank has advised government that, for growth to accelerate, government will have 
3.
to reduce constraints to public and private investment. Their key recommendations include: 
(i) addressing systemic weaknesses in the budget preparation and execution processes, including a 
closer alignment between policy priorities and budgetary allocations; (ii) amplifying good governance 
initiatives, including more independent audits and strengthened parliamentary processes; 
(ii) developing strategic infrastructure, particularly in the transport sector; and (iv) initiating reform in 
the power sector. 
4.
Agriculture development. Nationally, agriculture suffers from low investment,  as a result of 
which there is inadequate commercialization and modernization. Two-thirds of people in the labour 
force are engaged in agriculture production, but the majority are unskilled and lack knowledge on 
updated cultivation practices. The sector largely depends on the monsoon, while access to modern

April 2015, will be the largest ever scheme financed by foreign direct investment in Nepal, with completion expected by 2022. China also 
plans to extend its Tibet railway to the Nepali border by 2020.

Final programme design report 
inputs and extension service is limited and relatively poor in quality. Underemployment is a serious 
problem with many young people leaving farming for foreign employment.  
An Agricultural Development Strategy (ADS)27, supported by a broad donor coalition, which 
5.
aims to guide the agricultural sector of Nepal over the next 20 years, was approved in 2014. The ADS 
envisages a profound shift in the Nepalese economy, from one primarily based on agriculture to an 
economy that derives most of its income from services and industry. The strategy envisages “A self-
reliant, sustainable, competitive, and inclusive agricultural sector that drives economic growth and 
contributes to improved livelihoods and food and nutrition security.” This will be achieved through 
substantial growth in the sector and agro-based exports, underpinned by four strategic pillars of 
agriculture development: governance, productivity, commercialization and competitiveness, while 
promoting: (i) inclusiveness (both social and geographic); (ii) sustainability (both natural resources 
and economic); (iii) development of the private and cooperative sectors, and connectivity to market 
infrastructure (e.g. agricultural roads, collection centres, packing houses, market centres); (iv) 
information infrastructure and ICT; and (v) power infrastructure (e.g. rural electrification, renewable 
and alternative energy sources). Over a 20-year period it envisages agricultural growth rising from the 
current 3 per cent, to 6 per cent per annum, driven by a 400 per cent expansion in irrigated area, a 
400 per cent improvement in soil organic matter and associated 50 per cent reduction in degraded 
land, a 250 per cent expansion in agricultural land productivity and a significant increase in women’s 
ownership of land (from 10 per cent to 50 per cent). This growth is expected to lead, over 20 years, to: 
a 5 per cent surplus in food grain self-sufficiency from a 5 per cent deficit; an 800 per cent increase in 
agricultural exports; the more than doubling of returns to agriculture labour; and a reduction of rural 
poverty from 35 per cent to 10 per cent. 
Climate risk. The climate of Nepal varies significantly from one region to the next because of 
6.
the wide variation in altitude. The variable geo-climatic conditions, unplanned settlements, 
degradation of natural resources and growing population pressure make the country increasingly 
vulnerable to extreme climate events and climate change (CC). Climate model projections indicate 
that the average annual temperature in Nepal will rise and will vary both spatially and temporally. The 
annual mean temperature is expected to increase by an average of 1.2° C by 2030, 1.7° C by 2050 
and 3° C by 2100 compared with the pre-2000 baseline. Several studies show higher temperature 
increment projections for winter than for the monsoon season. There is also evidence of more 
frequent intense rainfall events, more flood days, more variable river flows, erosion and landslides. 
Warmer winters, particularly at higher altitudes, may mean that less precipitation falls as snow, further 
accelerating glacial retreat but also reducing soil moisture and accelerating erosion and, therefore, 
having an impact on winter crops. Warming also leads to early blossom of fruits trees and higher 
parasite/pest attacks, but increases the altitude at which vegetables can be grown. Greater 
unreliability of dry season flows poses a potentially serious threat to water supplies in the lean 
season. These projected changes are consistent with a range of climate models and are predicted to 
continue.  
Poor and marginalized people are especially vulnerable to climate variability and change. They 
7.
generally are the least able to cope with disaster, live in the most at-risk areas and have limited 
information, knowledge and resources to help reduce their level of risk. The predicted impacts of 
climate change (CC) will intensify existing vulnerabilities, inequalities and exposure to hazards. In the 
agriculture sector, smallholder producers face the greatest risk. They tend to own few livelihood 
assets such as land and livestock, receive a low income, and have a low level of education and 
limited access to community and government services. They are also likely to be dependent on rain-
fed agriculture and occupy land that is prone to floods, drought and landslides. Many of Nepal’s poor 
farmers occupy small parcels of land that barely produce enough food for the family. They rely more 
on local natural resources such as forests and water and will therefore suffer the most from the drying 
up of local water sources and changes in vegetation cover. 
27 It is expected that the ADS will be revised to positively respond to the federalization process of Nepal.  The ASDP Design and 
implementation arrangements, after revisions to the ADS, will be revised to ensure consistency and compatibility.

Nepal 
Agriculture Sector Development Programme 
Final programme design report 
The Government prepared its National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA) in 2010, which 
8.
led to the formulation of the Local Adaptation Plan of Action (LAPA) framework in 2011. The Nepal 
NAPA describes 9 priority activities, including: (i) promoting community-based adaptation through 
integrated management of agriculture, water, forest and biodiversity; (ii) building and enhancing 
adaptive capacity of vulnerable communities; (iii) community-based disaster management for 
facilitating climate adaptation; (iv) Glacial Lake Outburst Flood monitoring and disaster risk reduction; 
(v) forest and ecosystem management in supporting climate-led adaptation innovations; (vi) Adapting 
to climate challenges in public health; (vii) ecosystem management for climate adaptation; 
(viii) empowering vulnerable communities through sustainable management of water resource and 
clean energy supply; and (ix) promoting climate-smart urban settlements.  The preliminary estimate 
for NAPA implementation is about USD 350 million. 
9.
Nepal has prepared a national framework for development of Local Adaptation Plans for Action 
(LAPAs), which supports the operationalization of the NAPA priorities by facilitating the integration of 
CC resilience into development planning processes and outcomes from local-to-national levels. The 
LAPA’s purpose is to: (i) enable communities to understand the changing and uncertain future climatic 
conditions and effectively engage them in the process of developing adaptation priorities; 
(ii) implement climate-resilient plans that are flexible enough to respond to changing and uncertain 
climatic conditions (no regrets approach); and (iii) inform sectoral programmes, and catalyse 
integrated approaches between various sectors and sub-sectors. The LAPA ensures that the process 
of integrating CC resilience into national planning is bottom-up, inclusive, responsive and flexible. 
Diverse entry points including agriculture, forestry, public health, water and sanitation, watersheds and 
micro-finance are used to assess the ways climate resilience can be strengthened. 
  Rural poverty. Poverty in Nepal is primarily a rural problem, and it is strongly associated with 
10.
gender, ethnicity, caste and region. It is highest in the mid-western and far-western development 
regions, though there are pockets of poverty nationwide. The Human Poverty Index (HPI) value for 
Nepal in 2011 is 31.12. Nationally, the HPI fell by 8.5 points between 2001 and 2011, or 21.4 per cent.  
There are variations by rural and urban residence, and by ecological and development regions. 
Urban-rural differences are considerable, with rural poverty nearly 1.8 times higher than urban 
poverty. Among ecological regions, the HPI is lowest in the Hills at 29.20 and highest in the Mountains 
at 38.51. Among the development regions, the value is lower than the national average only in the 
Western region at 27.20 and the Eastern region at 29.22. The Mid Western region has the highest 
rank at 36.63, which is 1.3 times higher than that of the Western region (State 6). High levels of 
human poverty in the Mid-Western and Far Western regions reflect deprivations in health, education 
and sanitation. Dailekh, Kalikot, Jajarkot and Salyan, in the Mid-West are amongst the poorest 
districts. 
  The Human Development Index (HDI) score for Nepal in 2011 was 0.458, the lowest ranking 
11.
among the countries of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), aside from 
Afghanistan. Despite Nepal ranking second in terms of life expectancy at birth and improvements in 
education indicators, the country’s HDI score is depressed by the low level of per capita income. HDI 
calculations among the ecological regions show the Hills as having the highest HDI value at 0.520, 
compared to the Terai at 0.468 and the Mountains at 0.440. Within the development regions, the 
Central region, at 0.510, ranks at the top, followed by the Western, Eastern, Mid-Western and Far-
Western regions. The Far-Western region at 0.435 and the Mid-Western region (State 6) at 0.447 
have the lowest HDI values, reflecting very low scores in all three dimensions of life expectancy, 
education and income. Within the mid-west (State 6), Kalikot, Jajarkot and Rolpa districts have HDI 
scores below 0.4, while Dailekh, Rukum and Salyan have scores below 0.449. The 2011 urban-rural 
gap in HDI, at 19.7 per cent, is large, reflecting persistent discrepancies in income and education 
between urban and rural areas. 
12.
Inequalities in human development by gender, caste and ethnicity have been noted since the 
first Nepal Human Development Report in 1998. These remain pronounced, despite some evidence 
that they may be reducing over time. Among the four major caste and ethnic clusters — the 
3 
Nepal 
Agriculture Sector Development Programme 
Final programme design report 
Brahmans/Chhetris, the Janajatis, the Dalits and the Muslims — the Brahmans/ Chhetris rank at the 
top with an HDI value of 0.538, followed by the Janajatis (excluding the Newars) at 0.482, the Dalits at 
0.434 and the Muslims at 0.422.  
  Food insecurity remains a key concern, with 38 per cent of children under 5 years old stunted, 
13.
and 11 per cent wasted. Malnutrition rates vary geographically. There are more stunted children in 
rural areas than in urban ones. All rates are highest in State 6, with 50 per cent stunting, 37 per cent 
underweight and 11 per cent wasted. The target on the first Millennium Development Goal (MDG) on 
hunger (goal 1, target 1C) was further out of reach in Nepal than the targets for any other MDGs28.  
  Despite this scenario, Nepal has made significant progress in achieving its MDGs. The majority 
14.
of health-related MDGs have already been achieved, or are on track to being achieved, except two 
indicators in MDG 5, the contraceptive prevalence rate and the unmet need for family planning, and 
one in MDG 6, the proportion of the population with advanced HIV receiving antiretroviral combination 
therapy (ART). The targets related to poverty and hunger, universal primary education, gender 
equality and women’s empowerment, are also likely to be achieved by 2015, and though the targets 
concerning environmental sustainability and global partnership are unlikely to be achieved in totality, 
lessons to facilitate their achievement have been learnt. 
  Gender and Development. In Nepal, the Gender Development Index (GDI) is highest for the 
15.
Hills at 0.515, followed by the Terai at 0.458 and the Mountains at 0.430. Among the development 
regions, a picture similar to that of the HDI emerges. The Central region, at 0.503, has the highest 
GDI value, followed by the Western region at 0.491 and the Eastern region at 0.481. The Far-Western 
and Mid-Western regions have the lowest values at 0.423 and 0.442, respectively, primarily due to low 
life expectancy and adult female literacy. Nationally, there is an 18 per cent improvement in the 
Gender Development Index (GDI) score between 2001 and 2011. GDI improvement is above the 
national average in the Mountains at 34.1 per cent, the Mid-Western region at 29.3 per cent and the 
Far-Western region at 27.5 per cent. The value of the Gender Empowerment Index (GEM) for Nepal 
for 2011 is 0.568. Among ecological regions, the Mountains has the lowest value at 0.483, while the 
Hills has the highest at 0.572. Among development regions, the Eastern region has the highest GEM 
at 0.575, followed by the Central and Western regions. This pattern varies from that of the GDI, with 
the Far-Western region (State 6) having the lowest GEM value of 0.523, primarily due to its low share 
of women in administrative and professional positions. 
  Poverty and gender. Women are becoming the leading labour force in agricultural production 
16.
and they are actively involved in rural development, with or without recognition. Women headed 
households now form 26 percent of rural households. Despite recent progresses made in their socio-
economic conditions, women are among the most vulnerable as they are most likely the ones staying 
home to take care of elders and children, farming and other duties while their husbands migrate and 
work outside Nepal. Women suffer structural discrimination due to a lack of access and control over 
means of production, space and voices in the policies and program planning, and implementation, 
monitoring processes of State provisions. Women constitute more than 60 per cent of the agricultural 
labour force, but have limited access to land, production technology and training. Many rural women 
live in extreme poverty without any means of improving conditions for themselves and their families. A 
significant gap remains between women and men in terms of access to health care, nutrition, 
education and participation in decision-making. Illiteracy is far more prevalent among women than 
men, particularly in rural areas. 
B.
  Rationale 
  The justification for the ASDP stems from a number of elements: (i) a favourable policy and 
17.
institutional framework originated by the new Constitution of Nepal and the 2014 ADS, which places 
28 This report refers to Nepal’s achievement of the MDGs, which were replaced by Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) January 
2016. Nepal’s baseline SDG report was published in June 2017 and no progress against SDGs is yet available. The Programme will 
deliver inputs relevant to Nepal’s attainment of SDG 1 (No poverty), SDG 5 (Gender equality), SDG 8 (Decent work and economic 
growth), and SDG 9 (Industry, innovation and infrastructure, and, to a lesser extent SDG 13 (Climate action).

greater emphasis on market (value chain)-driven agriculture development; (ii) a significant stock of 
knowledge on value chain development produced by a number of projects, most of which will be 
completed during 2018, as a source of good practices and lessons learnt for this new operation; 
(iii) the opportunity of scaling up the successful HVAP approach through its replication of proven value 
chain interventions in a larger, including more remote, geographic area (enabled by improved rural 
infrastructure, notably the expanding district road corridors) and by further expanding the outreach of 
the activities underway, while ensuring the sustainability of development results.  
  The “theory of change” of the ASDP (Figure 1) is based on a fundamental premise that a 
18.
market-driven approach is needed to help smallholder producers sustainably increase their income 
and improve their livelihood (food security and nutrition). It is also underpinned by the evidence from 
HVAP that the “additionality” of investor co-financing leads to investments that are larger in scale, of a 
higher quality, take place more quickly, take place at targeted locations, or takes place at all as a 
result of intervention. The development hypothesis, therefore, is that smallholder producers and 
disadvantaged rural groups involved in commercially-oriented production and marketing systems, 
through tailored technical, infrastructural, financial and organisational support will benefit from being 
included in a sustainable and profitable way in selected, profitable and sustainable agriculture value 
chains through business relationships with other private actors (traders, processors, exporters etc.) in 
order to meet market demands and, overall, contribute to national agricultural growth. This is 
operationalized by: (i) facilitating a process through which the actors operating in the same sub-sector 
(private agribusiness, more or less organized farmers, service providers, public sector) and related 
value chains can develop a common vision, build trust among them and identify concrete business 
proposals in response to clear market opportunities; (ii) strategically combining public and private 
sector funds and advice to address smallholders’ and agribusiness needs in terms of access to 
market, technology, organization and scale, good agricultural practices, and affordable credit; (iii) 
reducing production and transportation costs and post-harvest losses through expanded and 
improved network of trails and village/farm roads, irrigation facilities and community-based market 
infrastructure; and (iv) developing the capacity of service providers at the local level to make timely 
quality services available to value chain actors.

Agriculture Sector Development Programme 
Final programme design report 
  The ASDP will commence at an important juncture in Nepal’s shift to a federal-state structure 
19.
under its new constitution. This process has seen the number of rural administrative units reduced by 
up to 80 per cent, the removal of districts as an administrative entity, a direct administrative line 
between state governments and their local governments and direct budget transfers from treasury to 
local governments29. In line with this constitutionally-driven restructuring, and the recommendations of 
the ADS, the agricultural sector is likely to see the consolidation of its sector-specific ministries (e.g., 
agriculture, co-operatives, livestock and land) and a shift in the responsibility of the consolidated 
Ministry from service delivery to planning, policy formulation, regulatory control and monitoring and 
evaluation. It is expected, with the establishment of the appropriate structures and governance at the 
State and Local Governments, ASDP’s implementation in time, would be under the purview of State 6.  
This will be accompanied by increased farmer participation in the planning, decision making, 
implementation, and monitoring of the strategy through MAUs and CAESCs. These developments are 
consistent with a more market-driven agriculture development approach as demonstrated under the 
HVAP, with increasing dependence on private sector rather than in public sector input and technical 
support services. Overlaying these reforms are the challenges of the feminization of Nepali agriculture 
due to rural male exodus, a high level of malnutrition in rural areas and the growing climate risk. 
  The proposed investment will benefit from and support the new constitutional framework. The 
20.
identification of potential value chain investments will be made in close collaboration with agribusiness 
investors, smallholder farmer producers, local service providers and municipal and ward governance, 
through the HVAP-proven Multi-stakeholder Platform convened by the elected DDCs. The 
identification of value chain “gatekeeper” investors and participating clusters of farmers will be based 
on those value chain actors’ preparedness to invest in its development, but will be closely aligned with 
municipal and ward development plans and the national ADS. Once key stakeholders (agri-
businesses, smallholder producers, and technical and financial service providers) have committed to 
investing in a value chain, the ASDP would work through municipal and ward governing bodies to co-
finance the establishment of supporting infrastructure and public/private service provision, which 
would be built around their respective annual and medium-term investment plans. While MoF 
regulations require that the loan financing of resulting investments flow through the ASDP, the 
Programme will revise its disbursement strategies in accordance with prevailing GoN regulations, 
including devolution of conditional funding for activities implemented by the municipality, on 
completion of a fiduciary due diligence of the municipality as a cost center.  
  With only a small proportion of agriculture production in Nepal flowing through structured value 
21.
chains, including in the HVAP catchment districts, there is ample scope for adding value to farm 
products, improving productivity and quality and expanding markets. Building on HVAP successes, 
the ASDP proposes to expand the HVAP Project area from 6 to 10 districts in State 6, in parallel with 
an expanding district road network, while better integrating Programme processes into local 
administrative systems and public and private services. The Programme will also deepen/intensify 
engagement within the continuing six (6) HVAP districts to more remote communities,  linked to an 
expansion of formal and informal district and village roads and village trails in those districts. The 
holistic, value chain-led approach will facilitate the development of a common vision among the actors 
working in a same sub-sector, building trust among them and enabling more effective business 
relationships between agribusiness and producer groups and co-operatives, as well as building the 
capacity of these actors, across different value chains, to efficiently meet customers’ quality and price 
expectations. This will be supported by modest risk-compensating, Programme supported, co-
investment that will be progressively replaced by financial services as banking and MFI lending 
capacity and innovative value chain-oriented loan and risk management products are developed with 
Programme support. Specific strategies will be implemented for poor household and landless rural 
resident participation in value chains. Through co-financing of public and collective goods market-
oriented infrastructure, the ASDP will avail rural households with the physical resources needed to 
engage in climate-adapted high value agriculture production and marketing (multi-use water supply, 
small-scale irrigation, village-to-farm and village-to-road head access, commodity storage, markets, 
29 Except currently for Donor funded projects per the circular of the Ministry of Finance

etc.). Programme support to the planned restructured extension system under the new Federal 
administrative system will empower communities to both coordinate public extension delivery and 
develop local, private fee-based advisory services, including farmer-to-farmer (F2F) and enterprise-to-
farmer (E2F) advice. These developments will be enveloped by programmes supporting climate 
change adaptation and women’s inclusion, with women forming 2/3rds of beneficiaries, and improved 
household food access and nutrition awareness. 
II.  Programme description 
A.
  Programme area and target group 
22.
  The Programme will be implemented in Surkhet, Dailekh, Salyan, Jajarkot, Kalikot, Jumla, 
Mugu, Dolpa, Humla and Rukum (western) districts in State 6 of Nepal. The four highlighted districts 
are incremental to the HVAP area and will be integrated into the Programme in line with the 
development of the (i) Chhinchu-Jajarkot–Dolpa; (ii) Surkhet-Kalikot-Jumla-Mugu; (iii) Surkhet- 
Dailekh road corridors; and (iv) Mid-hill highway. The Programme will commence immediately in the 
six existing HVAP districts and in Mugu and Rukum. Only sub-component 4 activities will commence 
in Dolpa and Humla initially and the rest will be  integrated as the road access improves The PCO will 
be based at Birendranagar in Surkhet district, while three corridor-based coordination units will be 
established for technical backstopping, field level coordination and programme monitoring and 
supervision (See road corridor map in Appendix 2, Annex 3). 
  The Programme will target smallholder producers and landless rural people (value chain labour, 
23.
small livestock, etc.) interested to engage in targeted value chain activities. HVAP experience 
indicates that this is a very inclusive process with most households in HVAP-supported hamlets and 
villages progressively participating in value-chain linked production and processing activities. Women 
will form 2/3rds of the Programme beneficiaries and disadvantaged households including Dalits, 
Janajatis, Muslims, youth, landless and other disadvantaged groups will be specifically targeted for 
Programme inclusion (25 per cent target). The Programme will develop specific mechanisms for poor 
households to be able to join appropriate value chains, however, poor and marginalised households 
will also benefit from expanding local agriculture employment opportunities associated with value 
chain-driven growth. It is expected that the ASDP will serve around 35,000 direct beneficiaries 
(producers households and agri-industry entrepreneurs and employees) and around 40,000 indirect 
household beneficiaries (through public infrastructure, financial services and agricultural services 
development). HVAP beneficiaries will not be eligible for grant co-financing under the ASDP. The 
Programme year 3 and 4 will see a surge in the interventions when the maximum number of groups 
will be formed or included. Table 2 below provides the household coverage of HVAP and the new 
Programme areas (additional districts in italics).

Final programme design report 
  Output 1.1: Identify and assess profitable high-value agriculture value chains. This output 
32.
includes two activities: (i) Strategic investment plan (SIP); and (ii) DCC-convened Multi-Stakeholders 
Consultative Platform: 
o  Strategic investment plan: To identify profitable, climate change adapted value chain 
development pathways, the Programme will conduct a comprehensive financial, economic 
and value chain analysis of both existing (to confirm their continuing financial and economic 
viability) and potentially new value chains and associated wholesale markets covering both 
additional products in the existing HVAP districts and key agricultural products in the new 
Programme districts. As part of this analysis, constraints to private sector investment in the 
region will be assessed with a view to improving competitiveness and the environment for 
doing business. For each selected commodity, a SIP will be prepared, including all potential 
activities within the value chains inherent in that commodity segment. In addition to the six 
(6) economically and financially viable value chains established under the HVAP35, the SIP 
will also evaluate, inter alia, milk, citrus fruit, walnut, seed potato, honey and high nutrition 
crop (grain legume, finger millet, buckwheat etc.) value chains.  
o  The SIP process will involve seven (7) steps including: (i) background research on the 
chosen commodity/crop by reviewing websites and other secondary sources of information; 
(ii) identification of the preliminary MSP stakeholders for the value chains being tested; 
(iii) mapping of the commodity/crop sectors in State 6 municipalities; (iv) prepare, with MSP 
support, a table listing the structural and dynamic factors in the value chain including 
identifying a scaling up strategy; (v) identifying supporting rural infrastructure and financial, 
technical and social services required to underpin value chain development; (vi)prepare a 
financial and economic analysis of each of the key value chains; and (vii) in partnership with 
the respective MSPs, conduct workshops to vet the findings of the analysis and discuss 
potential strategy addressing constraints and facilitating  competitiveness. The SIP process 
will include a robust gender analysis and an assessment of constraints to private sector 
investment in State 6, with a view to improving provincial competitiveness and the 
environment for doing business. The selected commodities/value chains will be chosen 
based on their having: (i) significant potential for involving rural households, particularly 
disadvantaged households, in incremental production, value addition and job creation; 
(ii) available technologies for improved productivity; (iii) reasonably assured national or 
regional markets; and (iv) potential for export and/or import substitution. (See Appendix 4, 
Annex 1 for detailed ToRs). 
o  DCC-convened Multi-Stakeholders Consultative Platform. The strength of a value chain is 
largely determined by a shared vision and effective communication between the value chain 
stakeholders. The Programme will facilitate the establishment of MSPs to support the 
development of specific value chains. MSPs will also inform the SIP process. MSPs will 
bring together the key stakeholders, including farmer representatives, private sector actors 
(traders, processors, input suppliers, investors, finance institutions) and government actors 
(state and municipal governance, research, extension) engaged in the development of 
specific value chains, with a view to strengthening private and public-private relationships 
across the value chains, promoting innovation and providing a conducive 
environment/space for the brokerage of business and financial agreements between value 
chain stakeholders. While initially convened by the DCC, MSPs will be assisted to become 
self-governing and to align with State-level and Municipal institutions as they establish. 
  Output 1.2: Co-financed agricultural value chain development. This output will include three 
33.
activities: (i) co-investment both on farm and at agribusiness level; (ii) value chain-led participatory 
and applied technology development; and (iii) tailored multi-disciplinary capacity building.

Agriculture Sector Development Programme 
Final programme design report 
o  Co-investment both on-farm and at agribusiness level. The Programme will establish a 
competitively allocated Value Chain Development Mechanism (VCDM) providing risk-based 
co-financing to catalyse private investments by agri-enterprises and farm households into the 
SIP-prioritised value chains, with particular attention paid to the inclusion of poor, 
disadvantaged and women-headed households in the value chain catchment area. The level 
of co-investment will vary by location and purpose, priced to reflect the measured risk to the 
"innovator" investors, but not set at levels that are likely to distort markets. Once “innovator” 
co-investments are proven to be commercially viable, both in hilly and mountainous 
environments, direct incentive co-investments for that value chain segment will be phased 
out. The percentage of co-investment offered and other terms will be actively monitored and 
revised if necessary based on actual uptake. The competitive co-investment allocation 
process will reward enterprise and farmer group business proposals that offer higher levels of 
own contribution, better value addition and greater engagement of disadvantaged people. The 
Programme will work closely with province and municipal authorities to align VCDM co-
financing with other GoN support for value chain-driven agri-business development.  
o  Agri-business co-financing. The VCDM agri-business facility will co-finance, on a competitive 
basis, up to 30 per cent of total investment cost of SIP-identified and PCO/IFAD approved 
agribusiness investment proposals, with the remaining investment being contributed by the 
benefitting business. VCDM co-financing will be awarded for capital investments in civil 
works, equipment (processing, packaging, energy generation or environment protection), 
transportation and marketing, related directly to the core activity of the investor. Up to 20 per 
cent of VCDM co-financing awards will be available for the purchase of supporting services 
(business development services (BDS), legal, technical, marketing, standards, farmer 
extension, etc.) for the planned value chain investment. Co-financing will start at USD 15,000 
as a minimum and reach up to USD 100,000 as the maximum. In cases where the potential 
export/import substitution and social impact of the proposed activity is extremely high and/ or 
the investment is pivotal for developing the respective commodity in the State, the maximum 
VCDM co-financing could, with IFAD approval, be up to 250 per cent of the aforementioned 
cap. In the case of production of new commodities, the PCO could approve production trials 
using less than USD 15 000 co-financing, but otherwise follow the same requirement as the 
mainstream VCDM investments. The enterprise in-kind contribution should not exceed 50 per 
cent of total enterprise contribution (i.e. 50 per cent of 70 per cent) with the balance paid in 
cash or through a line of credit. The ASDP will provide approximately USD 5.0 million 
(including 70 per cent beneficiary co-financing) for agri-business financing.  
o  VCDM applications with higher levels of own contribution, that target higher numbers of poor, 
near poor or women-headed households and are climate-change responsive will be assessed 
as more competitive. Only legally registered cooperative societies and companies of at least 
12 months standing will be eligible to apply for VCDM agri-business co-financing. Entities that 
are the subject of bankruptcy, criminal investigation, fraud or corruption or are in default of 
contractual agreements will be ineligible. VCDM supported agri-business investment must be 
within State 6. 
o 
Investment proposals will be accepted throughout the year. The VC team will be responsible 
for the preliminary assessment and short-list of the eligible proposals based on the pre-
defined criteria and arranging field verification. Plans involving ASDP co-financing of less than 
USD 25,000 will also be assessed by the VC team against defined selection criteria (See 
Appendix 4, Annex 2) who will make a recommendation to the Project Coordinator (PC) for 
Programme financing. Respective DCCIs and also line departments will be invited for 
consultation where required. Co-financing applications for >USD 25,000. will be referred to a 
Business Plan Assessment Panel consisting four independent experts, who will prepare a 
recommendation for financing to the (PC. For co-financing awards >USD50,000, the PC will 
seek IFAD no-objection to the co-financing, contingent on which the PC will approve the 
disbursement.

Agriculture Sector Development Programme 
Final programme design report 
o  Farmer group co-financing. Farmer groups, together with eligible co-operatives, will be 
entitled to apply for competitively allocated, value chain-linked co-financing supporting both: 
(i) the alignment of their agriculture production systems with emerging value chains; and 
(ii) the adoption of climate adapted technologies and practices. Farmer group co-financing 
could cover: (i) initial capital investment costs; (ii) upgraded farming inputs through revolving 
working capital mechanisms; and/or (iii) required technical assistance. Co-financing will focus 
on innovative production, climate change adaptation, risk reduction or value addition 
investments. This could include investment in, inter alia: afforestation, irrigation management, 
climate-resistant crop varieties and management systems, forage production, biogas and 
other by-product utilisation including bio-fertilisers, minimum tillage and organic agriculture. 
The Programme will support both gender specific and gender disaggregated farmer groups. 
To be eligible for the ASDP competitive co-financing, the membership of farmer’s groups 
must, in aggregate at ward level, include: (i) at least 60 per cent of members from poor and 
near poor households; and (ii) at least 60 per cent female members. All participating farmer 
groups/co-operatives will receive training in group formation, participation, leadership and 
governance.  
o  The maximum VCDM grant of USD 350 per group member and USD 10,000 for one farmer 
group/cooperative in the mid-hills municipalities and USD 400 per group member and 
USD 12,000 for one farmer group/cooperative in mountainous municipalities. The co-
financing will cover up to 50 per cent of the total cost of each investment, with beneficiaries 
financing at least 50 per cent including a minimum 25 per cent in cash and the balance in 
kind. For very poor members who wish to join groups, the co-financing can, based on 
agreements reached by the group, be increased to up to 60%, with at least 5% contribution in 
cash by such members and the rest in kind. The very poor members will be identified by the 
community themselves using some PRA tools such as participatory wellbeing ranking. Up to 
20 per cent of each grant could be used by the group for procurement of technical support 
services, including LRP support coordinated by ward CAESC. All such service provision will 
be through standardised output based contracts between the service provider and the group. 
LRPs will be certified under an ASDP developed and GoN managed training and certification 
scheme, providing both technical and pedagogic skills. The Programme will also provide 
business literacy and entrepreneurship training to group members, participation in which will 
be a condition of Programme support to their respective groups. Groups requiring small-scale 
irrigation (OSV, apple, walnut, potato, ginger, turmeric etc.), both at household and group 
level, will have access to an additional grant of up to USD 20,000 per group with a community 
contribution of 15 per cent. These funds will be released by the PCO from the Sub-
component 2.   
o  Value chain-led participatory and applied technology development. The design mission has 
identified significant technical constraints in the targeted value chains. Programme co-
financing would be available to support applied and participatory research and associated 
technology transfer, including farmer-to-famer (F2F) and enterprise-to-farmer (E2F) advisory 
services, to address technical constraints and opportunities mutually identified by value chain 
actors through their MSP. Beneficiary enterprises and farmer groups could apply up to 20% of 
their investment co-financing for participatory action research into identified production or 
processing constraints related to their value chain. The VC MSPs will also have access to 
additional funding for participatory action research. The Nepal Agriculture Research Council 
(NARC), universities and technical institutes would be eligible to compete for outcome-based 
participatory action research contracts. 
o  Local communities in upland areas of Nepal are already experiencing the effects of climate 
change , which have manifested in terms of reduced water availability, rising temperatures, 
and a shift in growing seasons – which impact agricultural production. Climate change is a 
major threat to poor upland communities, especially women, who have limited assets and 
influence in the public sphere and experience discrimination on the basis of gender, caste, 
6 
Nepal 
Agriculture Sector Development Programme 
Final programme design report 
and ethnicity. The Programme will address these issues by, inter alia, (i) in consultation with 
IFAD’s ASHA project, preparing Ward-level Local Adaptation Plan for Action (LAPA) where 
they are not already available; (ii) testing climate change adaptation with all SIPs); 
(iii) diversifying household income through VC development; (iv) adopting climate resilient 
technology including plastic houses for OSV production and fodder production for stall-fed 
goats; (v) financing farmer group, agri-business and MSPs led participatory action research; 
and (vi) investing in climate-proofed infrastructure that reduces climate risk (e.g. small-scale 
and drip irrigation). 
o  Tailored multi-disciplinary capacity building. The Programme will provide value chain actors 
with specific training based on capacity building needs identified by the MSPs. This could 
include in-field and residential training courses; experiential regional study tours, etc. 
Members of farmer groups receiving “innovator” investment co-financing will be required to 
initiate business literacy training before the release of the co-financing funds. Additional 
entrepreneurship training will also be available to agri-business managers and agriculture 
group members. 
Sub-component 2. Market-oriented infrastructure functional 
  This sub-component (outcome) will support the construction of market-oriented infrastructure in 
34.
the Programme area. It has one output – Co-financed public and community market infrastructure. 
The indicator of successful Programme intervention is: 
 
Percentage of households in Programme impact areas reporting satisfaction with 
Programme infrastructure development (disaggregated by male and female-headed 
households and ethnicity). 
  Output 2.1. -Co-financed public and community market infrastructure In alignment with the SIP, 
35.
the Programme will allocate funds for market-linked infrastructure investments that provide public 
good and collective36 benefits essential to targeted commodity value chain engagement and/or 
climate change adaptation. Public or collective market-linked infrastructure investment schemes will 
be identified and prioritized through: (i) participatory community planning; (ii) the MSP process; and 
(iii) their alignment with Municipality infrastructure plans. Investments could include, inter alia, village 
and farm access roads, commodity storage, ponds, small-scale irrigation and multi-purpose village 
water supply. As this is a demand driven process, there is the likelihood that communities, MSPs and 
SIPs will identify the need for other types of infrastructure that have not been anticipated here. The 
programme will be structured to cater for innovative demands as they emerge. For public 
infrastructure (village roads, trails, markets, etc.) funds will be advanced to Municipalities from the 
Programme budget for municipalities to implement with Programme-contracted infrastructure design 
and construction supervision support. In the event, private sector participation does not materialize, 
for larger market infrastructure, the local government will retain ownership of the market. Collective 
goods infrastructure, with beneficiary contributions in cash and in kind37, will be primarily built through 
community action unless their scale or complexity required contracting. All infrastructure investments 
will be climate change adaptive. In line with the Local Infrastructure Development Policy (LIDP), 
infrastructure development shall follow the following process: identification, selection, prioritisation, 
implementation, operation and maintenance. This process has been developed further by HSI for 
farmer managed irrigation systems development. The same approach, with modifications, will be used 
for all types of Programme local infrastructure. 
36.
  Co-financing of construction costs of public and collective goods infrastructure works will be in 
accordance with the accompanying table. Individual infrastructure investments exceeding USD 50,000 
will require no-objection from IFAD. The Programme will, wherever practicable, use force account 
36 Semi-public good 
37 Markets owned by group, cooperatives and agri-businesses will be treated as ‘private’and have to contribute 15% cash whereas the 
markets owned by Municipalities will be treated as ‘public goods’ and hence no cash contribution required. Value of land will be 
considered as cash contribution

processes for community infrastructure investments, designed to create local jobs, while recognising 
that most major infrastructure investments will require some machine support. 
37.
Infrastructure construction will use a mix of labour 
intensive methodologies and machinery as appropriate. 
Municipalities and design engineers will determine the best 
mix of community labour and machinery, as allowed by law. 
The selection of irrigation and water supply development will 
occur in the high potential pockets/cluster areas and will 
depend on technical feasibility. Rehabilitation and upgrading 
of irrigation schemes will be prioritised depending on the: 
(i) number of beneficiaries; (ii) value of crops to be grown; 
(iii) number of disadvantaged communities benefitting; 
(iv) linkage with a commercial trader to buy the produce and 
(v) availability of road access. Improved water governance, 
such as tariff system, will be a key input for sustainable 
irrigation management. 
  Under the ASDP, rural transport infrastructure will include motorised and non-motorised traffic 
38.
focussing on market access and village roads that are less than 5 km in length and justified through 
linkage to significant production clusters/pockets of targeted high value commodities. It is anticipated 
that the cost of development will be about $100,000/km. All roads will fall under the jurisdiction of the 
local municipality, which will be responsible for managing their construction. Priority will be given to 
upgrading roads from fair weather access to all year access, whilst new roads may be included. All 
village roads to be upgraded or new development will be part of the district/municipality transport 
master plan. The municipality will make an undertaking to co-finance the construction and maintain 
the road after construction, as part of condition for selecting the road. Trails and trail bridges will be 
owned by the municipality, which will co-finance their construction in partnership with the beneficiary 
community, who will also contribute to their maintenance. Public infrastructure user committees will be 
formed for all village roads, trails, trail bridges, irrigartion and water supply schemes. The committees 
will work together with the municipality and ward governments to ensure that infrastructure 
maintenance is properly carried out in a timely manner. 
  The ASDP will invest in new and existing farmer-managed small-scale irrigation systems. 
39.
Existing small-scale systems will be rehabilitated and upgraded using modern technologies that 
promote water use efficiency and cop productivity. Plastic tunnel drip irrigation will be preferred 
wherever feasible. Where potable water is not available, irrigation development will include improved 
domestic water supply systems for the community. The Programme will promote the use of water 
filtration systems that are appropriate for the areas selected for potable water supply. 
  The Programme will also finance the development of marketing infrastructure, according to the 
40.
needs identified in the SIP and in line with local government priorities. This will include municipality-
owned markets of different sizes depending on location and identified need. These markets will be 
owned by the municipality, but managed by a registered Market Management Committee (MMC). 
Markets will have women-friendly and safe spaces. The MMC will be assisted to organise for optimal 
operation and maintenance of the market. Community-based collection centres are also proposed to 
be developed in line with the needs of traders. The collection centres will be farmer organisation 
owned and operated. The farmers who own a collection centre will be legally registered. 
  Climate proofing of transport infrastructure will be considered at each step of the 
41.
implementation process, starting at the selection stage. All potential transport infrastructure will be 
screened for climate risks in order to select only sites where risks can be mitigated within available 
resources. The Programme will undertake a detailed climate risk assessment immediately after site 
selection using the LAPA framework with intensive involvement of User Committees (UCs) to ensure 
that local knowledge and users’ needs and concerns are properly addressed. Critical points of the 
proposed alignment would be identified along with possible alternatives with less impact if any. Risks 
to be taken in account would include: erosion and slope collapse, drainage, borrow and deposit areas

for earthen materials. The Programme would also assess and enhance capacity and prior experience 
of contractors in terms of bio-engineering and other preventive measures to improve climate resilience 
of infrastructures. Contracted works supervision will include detailed terms of reference to prevent and 
mitigate climate risks, both during construction and at operation and maintenance (O&M) stage. To 
that end, on-the-job-training of contractor staff and voluntary labour will be provided. Bioengineering 
has played a major role in stabilizing the slopes of hills in different parts of Nepal. It is a cost effective, 
environmentally friendly and sustainable method that has proven to be successful in solving road 
weathering and blockage caused by landslides and with stabilising ponds and water canals in Nepal 
and will be implemented by the Programme.38 Bioengineering can also be a useful tool for agro-
industry environment impact mitigation. 
Sub-component 3. Rural financial services for value chain development strengthened 
  Under this Outcome, the Programme will facilitate financial linkages for agriculture producers 
42.
and agri-businesses in value chains, including for each sub-project under Sub-component 1. The 
Programme will work with co-operatives and microfinance development banks (MFDB) for financing of 
producers, and the commercial banks for facilitating credit linkages for agri businesses. Commercial 
banks will also be supported for new product development. A primary reason for including this sub-
component is to providing existing and new value chain stakeholders, at all levels of the chain, with 
access to finance to provide scope for post-project sustainability and scalability of ASDP and HVAP 
supported and for new value chain development. The indicator of successful Programme intervention 
is: 
 
Increase in number of households reporting using rural financial services (savings, credit, 
insurance, etc.) (disaggregated by ethnicity and female-headed households). 
  This outcome will include two outputs: (i) Rural financial services development; and (ii) Support 
43.
to credit access. 
  Output 3.1. Rural financial services development. This output will be comprised of three 
44.
activities: (i) Product innovation for value chain financing and loan risk management; (ii) Capacity 
development of co-operatives; and (iii) Improving insurance uptake. 
o  Product innovation for value chain financing and loan risk management. It is expected that 
about five (5) commercial banks will develop value chain financing arrangements with the 
Programme and introduce trade and production financing. About 20 value chain financing 
agreements covering about 10,000 primary producers in different value chains are expected 
to be put in place. The Programme will convene a MSP for each commodity value chain, 
which will help develop a common understanding among the stakeholders on financial 
requirements. Through the MSP and Programme interventions, value chain agreements will 
be forged between agribusinesses and farmers with clearly established channel relationships, 
contracts and formal agreements. This will form the basis of value chain financing. The 
Programme will provide technical assistance to banks intending to implement value chain 
financing solutions (see Appendix 4, Annex 3 for ToRs). Product innovation could include: 
 
Value chain financing arrangements for different value chain commodities could 
include: (i) agro vet/agro supplier input financing (for seeds and inputs, animal care 
nutrients and medicines); (ii) processor financing (for turmeric, ginger, dairy, honey, 
apple); and (iii) trader financing (vegetables, apple, millets). The Programme will also 
draw on the development of the products under Sakchyam, UNNATI etc. and the 
proposed loan guarantee fund mechanism under the active consideration of donors in 
Nepal. Alternatively, government or DPs may offer a first loss buffer fund to banks to 
enable them to reduce their collateral requirements and leverage additional agro-
enterprise lending. Both the options of financing production activities of farmers

Final programme design report 
through wholesale lending through these agri businesses with transparent contracts, 
and directly to individual farmers with the guarantee of agri businesses to ensure 
repayments from the cash flows between the parties will be explored. The 
Programme  will also carry out a risk assessment of the Value Chain Financing (VCF) 
that can be used by the bank in understanding the VCDM risks and devising the 
product(s). Thereafter, joint consultations among agri-businesses, farmer groups and 
the bank will be held to determine the contours of financing and ensuring loan 
repayment. Tripartite agreement among the banks, agri business and farmers that 
define the terms of financing will be established – amount, rate of interest, repayment 
period, etc.; 
Financing of agri businesses - The Programme will explore the feasibility of 
discounting of trade bills and finance against purchase contracts in the case of trade 
finance. In particular, the focus will be short duration loans that are required in 
commodity trade. Part of the value chain finance requirements will be in infrastructure 
for storage, grading, processing, packing, etc. for agri businesses. These also will be 
examined as part of value chain finance requirements and suitable financial products 
will be developed TA will facilitate development of banks’ credit policies towards 
VCDM including risk assessment tools, due diligence exercise, loan monitoring and 
early warning systems;  
Training and exposure visits - Bank senior managers, branch managers, credit 
managers and other key staff of branches of banks in State 6 interested to develop 
value chain financing products will be provided training on the SIP-approved value 
chains to understand the information flows, cash flows and the risks and their 
mitigation mechanisms. The Programme will also organize two study tours to India to 
financial institutions such as, Yes Bank, HDFC Bank and Samunnati Finance to study 
their value chain financing products. Programme key staff and relevant stakeholders 
will also be part of the study tours. 
 
 
o  Capacity development for co-operatives. This activity has two parts: (i) MFDBs and co-
operatives develop agriculture lending products; and (ii) Capacity development of municipal 
co-operatives. 
  MFDBs and co-operatives develop agriculture lending products. MFDBs have a wide 
presence in municipalities, but their products are not suitable for agriculture lending. 
The Programme will engage with the larger MFDBs based in the Programme 
municipalities and assess their interest to cater to new market segments and develop 
new products. There are also large co-operatives functioning across the State 6 and 
some are keen to develop agriculture lending products. The Programme will work with 
these co-operatives to build their capacity for lending to value chain members. The 
capacity development support will include: (i) TA for agri lending product 
development; (ii) information technology support for improving monitoring and 
efficiency; and (iii) staff training for agri lending.  
  Co-operatives fulfilling the following criteria will be chosen for product development: 
(i) good governance; (ii) 80 per cent members saving regularly; (iii) at least 50 per 
cent members have availed loans in the last year; (iv) repayment rate of more than 
95 per cent during last year; (v) functional MIS system with data accuracy; and 
(vi) assured sources of funding for offering agricultural loans. The Programme will 
enter into a MoU with these institutions specifying the nature of the Programme 
support and expected outputs.  
 
Technical assistance will be provided to these institutions in their development of 
agriculture loan products. Individual national consultants will be hired to develop 
suitable products, assist in rolling them out and facilitating any modifications

necessary (see Annex 3 for ToRs). Agricultural loans will address the financing of the 
sub-projects of groups and co-operatives where partial co-financing will be made 
available from the Programme. The loan products that will be needed include loans 
for irrigation, tools and equipment, crop/plantation production costs and livestock 
financing. The staff of the co-operatives (both head office and branch staff) will also 
be provided training on agriculture lending. Some co-operatives are keen to improve 
their MIS for better monitoring and cost efficiency through information technology 
such as mobile, tablets, etc. Proven systems and technologies will be supported on a 
50:50 co-financing basis. 
  Capacity development of co-operatives. About 200  co-operatives are expected to be 
supported by the Programme. Co-operatives working within the municipalities of the 
Programme area will be facilitated to consolidate/ amalgamate to improve their 
capacity to cater to member needs and be credit worthy for wholesale bank loans. 
While strengthening existing co-operatives will be the primary focus, commodity value 
chain specific aggregation (input supply and output sales) will also require the 
formation of new co-operatives. These co-operatives will initially consist of value 
chain group members and expand the scope of membership to include more 
producers of same commodity. The Programme will select the co-operatives based on 
the following criteria: (i) operational for at least 3 years; (ii) functional board; (iii) at 
least 75 members; (iv) savings regularity of members at least 80 per cent; 
(v) repayment rate on loans above 95 per cent; (vi) at least 50 per cent of members 
have borrowed in the last year; and (vii) preferably agri producer co-operatives so that 
input and output marketing will be feasible. The capacity development support will 
include training, on-site mentoring, automated MIS and equipment and facilitated 
access to wholesale credit. The Programme will engage the services of national 
institutions like Rural Microfinance Development Centre (RMDC), Nepal Agricultural 
Co-operative Central Federation Ltd. (NACCFL) or a similar institution for capacity 
development of co-operatives for a period of 3 years. A management fee up to 10 per 
cent of the costs will be provided to the institution. Support will include: (i) training on 
institutional development and business development; (ii) quarterly on site visits for on 
the job mentoring; (iii) co-operatives with more than 400 members will be facilitated to 
improve their accounting and portfolio monitoring through software-based monitoring 
system on a 50 per cent cost sharing basis; (iv) facilitation of need-based credit 
linkages; (v) negotiation with banks on access to wholesale credit; and (vi) access to 
improved insurance facilities.  
 
The Programme will work with the Insurance Board, municipal and State-level 
agriculture department to develop/modify insurance products. TA service providers will 
carry out field based studies on the existing products and propose modified 
features/processes to suit the requirements of Programme area/ farmers, including 
weather-based insurance. The Programme will facilitate study tours for Insurance 
Board and select insurance company managers as well as Government officials to 
India and/or other Asian countries, where weather index based insurance products 
have been in operation for more than a decade. Up to 100 LRPs will be trained in 
insurance products and licenses as insurance agents. LRPs acting as insurance 
agents at local level, will lead to better distribution and improved on time claims filing. 
Building on HVAP’s business literacy training model, the Programme will also include 
modules on insurance literacy for improving farmers’ awareness and knowledge of 
insurance. 
  Output 3.2: Support to credit access. In all, about 1,000 facilitators will be trained who, in turn, 
45.
will train the value chain farmer group members. It is assumed that about 70 per cent of the 
35,000 value chain farmer stakeholders will need and undergo this training. This output has one 
activity: Business and financial literacy for value chain members. HVAP is facilitating business literacy 
11

Final programme design report 
class for women, especially from marginalised sections such as Dalit, Janajati and the poorest 
households with the aim of commercialising agriculture. Well trained business literacy facilitators, 
chosen from the groups, deliver the training at village level on social dynamics, technical aspects of 
value chain they are participating in, basic numeracy and business aspects of the commodity. This 
initiative will be scaled up under the ASDP, enlarging the scope of the training to include financial 
literacy aspects as well. 
Sub-component 4. Agriculture services sustainably support innovation and value chain 
development 
In line with the provisions of the new Constitution of Nepal and the ADS, ASDP will support the 
46.
development of participatory, pluralistic extension and service delivery systems for agriculture and 
livestock sectors at the municipal and ward levels. It will involve setting up and activating sustainable 
mechanisms at appropriate levels in the municipality for governance, active farmer participation and 
the engagement of the private sector in service delivery. This outcome also proposes to build off 
HVAP achievements on women’s development by further empowering women, particularly in their 
households and by translating improved household income into improved nutrition. Sub-component 4 
will be supported by SDC-financed TA implemented by HSI. The indicator of successful Programme 
intervention is: 
  Percentage of households in Programme area reporting adoption of new / improved inputs, 
technologies or practices (disaggregated by ethnicity and female-headed households)  
  This outcome includes two outputs: (i) Participatory and pluralistic extension services and 
47.
strengthened farmers organizations; and (ii) Women’s empowerment and household nutrition. 
  Output 4.1 Participatory and pluralistic extension service development. This output will have 
48.
two activities: (i) extension service development; and (ii) farmer group development. 
  Extension service development: This activity aims to facilitate the establishment of a 
49.
sustainable, pluralistic and participatory institutional mechanism for the delivery of extension services 
to farmers at the local bodies level in consonance with the provisions of the new Constitution of Nepal 
and ADS 2014. The strategy will be to draw on the new constitutional provisions pertaining to local 
bodies, those of the LSGA 1999 pertaining to decentralised participatory extension and service 
delivery and the proposals outlined in ADS 2014 under the Decentralised Science, Technology and 
Education Programme (DSTEP), and the HVAP experience of linking farmers to service providers and 
businesses. The SDC-supported NASDP is being implemented by HSI in nine districts across four 
States, including three (Dailekh, Jajarkot, Kalikot) in ASDP districts in State 6. The ASDP initiatives 
proposed here are similar to those included in the NASDP. The actions proposed under the activity 
include: (i) establish MAUs39 at municipal level; (ii) establish CAESCs40 at ward level; and (iii) Private 
sector engagement in agriculture extension and service delivery. 
o  Establish MAUs at municipal level: The MAU is being proposed as a sectoral committee of 
the municipal executive41 and will have five to seven members from among the members of 
the municipal executive, including the Chair42 and at least two women and one Dalit/Janajati 
39 The Constitution of Nepal does not specify any committees as part of the Municipalities or Wards. It is expected, however, that the 
Municipalities would have a governance and oversight structure for the agriculture sector (as well as other sectors in its domain), such 
as to recommend policies, plans and budgets to the Municipal Executive Committee for presentation to the Municipal Assembly and for 
management and oversight as the subject has been placed in their domain by the Constitution of Nepal. As is the normal practice at 
municipal levels, such structures take the form of a sub-committee of the municipal executive committee. In the course of interactions 
with the newly elected Mayors/Chairpersons in State 6, it was suggested that a committee should be set up exclusively for agriculture 
(perceived by them to be a key sector for the development of the State) so that it receives undivided attention. The precise nomenclature 
is likely to be known when an Act is passed by the Government of Nepal regarding the management procedures at the Local Level, the 
name tentatively proposed is Municipal Agriculture Unit (MAU). 
40 ADS 2014 had proposed CAESCs to be set at the VDC level as a key measure to promote pluralistic, decentralised and farmer-
responsive extension system. ADS is undergoing revision to align itself with the new Constitution of Nepal. However, in line with the 
policy of decentralisation, CAESCs are likely to remain as a part of the policy, regardless of eventual nomenclature. 
41 The Municipal Executive has directly elected Chairperson/Mayor and Vice-chairperson/Deputy Mayor, all ward Chairs, four women 
members from wards and two members from Dalit/Janajati nominated by the Municipal Assembly. 
42 As per the Regulations pertaining to LSGA 1999, has prescribed the Agriculture, Forestry and Environment Committee (AFEC) (as 
other Sectoral Committees of the VDC) was to have been chaired by one of the ward members of the VDC. AFECs were established 
12

Final programme design report 
nominated by the municipal executive, and heads of the sectoral departments at the 
municipality. At least 50 percent of the members of MAU will be women. It will be 
responsible for the agriculture, livestock and forestry sector activities in the municipality. 
Specifically, it will develop policies for approval by the Municipal Assembly, develop the 
agriculture extension and service delivery systems within the municipality, identify potential 
value chain and agri-business development opportunities, facilitate engagement with various 
stakeholders/service providers in the sector, exercise oversight over the sectoral function, 
engage with the national and regional agricultural research institutions to influence their 
research priorities, recommend budgets to the municipal Executive Council, and register, 
monitor and backstop the CAESCs to be set up at each ward in the municipality. Actual 
implementation of extension and service delivery strategies will be by the CAESCs. ASDP 
will initially work with about 60 municipalities in State 643, 50 in the first and second years 
and 10 in the third year, to establish MAUs and subordinate CAESCs. The following steps 
are envisaged: (i) Orienting stakeholders on MAU roles and responsibilities: a two-day 
workshop will be conducted in each of the 10 districts for the municipality 
Chairpersons/Vice-chairpersons, Mayors/Deputy Mayors, ward chairpersons, administrative 
officers and technical staff in the selected municipalities to deliberate on the Constitutional 
provisions regarding the concept of the MAU; (ii) Assessment of technical staff capacity at 
the Municipality: the Programme will support an assessment of Agriculture Service Centre 
(ASC) and Livestock Service Centre (LSC) technical staff, (including organic agriculture, 
climate adaptation), extension (including issues of inclusion/exclusion, the provisions 
regarding agriculture extension under the new Constitution of Nepal), ICT and value chain 
knowledge and capacity development needs, identified through a participatory process; 
(iii) Resourcing Municipal technical staff: budgetary support will be provided to the MAU to 
enable the municipal technical staff to engage with the value chain development processes; 
(iv) Building the capacity of municipal technical staff: Based on the assessment of the 
capacity development needs of the municipal technical staff a capacity development plan 
will be prepared and updated periodically; (v) Support for enabling farmer access to 
technology: based on the policies and priorities set by the municipalities, resources will be 
provided to the MAU to augment support provided by them to CAESCs at the ward level for 
providing technology extension services based on the latter’s plans on a yearly basis.  
o  Establish CAESCs at the ward level: A CAESC will be established at each of the wards with 
farming households and a budget for agricultural extension44 in each of the selected 
Municipalities, broadly along the lines proposed in the ADS 201445 and guided by the 
policies and priorities set by the municipalities. It will be a membership organisation with 
membership open to farmers, private sector/freelance service providers and agro-
enterprises in the Ward. Thus, while the MAU is part of the governance structure at the 
municipality, the CAESC is a community based membership organisation (CBO) that will 
both contribute to policy and programming at the municipality level through the MAU and 
facilitate/source service delivery46. The CAESC will elect a Board/Executive Committee of 
seven to nine members with not less than 50 per cent representation of women farmers, and 
proportional representation of small and marginal farmers and Dalits and Janajatis. The 
CAESC will be registered at the Municipal level. ADS will work with about 480 wards across 
under NASDP by HSI in some of VDCs in the nine NASDP districts but most VDCs do not have AFECs. The same arrangement may be 
followed as the Chairperson/Mayor has other responsibilities and may not be burdened with committee responsibilities. That would also 
ensure the neutrality of the Chairperson/ Mayor with respect to deliberations in the committees. 
43 There are in all 82 municipalities (26 urban and 56) in the 10 districts, including 8 (6 rural) in Dolpa and 7 (6 rural) in Humla, districts to 
be taken up later. 
44 While municipalities have been classified as urban and rural, wards have not been so classified. Many urban municipalities have rural 
settlements as is evident from the HVAP experience where about 46 percent of the 14,500 project households are from VDCs now 
included in urban municipalities. It is expected that urban municipalities will provide budgets for agricultural extension in Wards with 
farming households. Since CAESC is at the level of Wards, ASDP will include all Wards that have provision for agricultural extension in 
selected municipalities. 
45 ADS 2014, pp 158 
46 Guidance for the structure of the CAESC will be provided by the municipality based on the recommendations of the MAU. 
13 
Nepal 
Agriculture Sector Development Programme 
Final programme design report 
the 60 chosen municipalities47 to establish CAESCs. The Programme will facilitate the 
establishment of CAESCs through: (i) Orientation of stakeholders to the concept of CAESC 
and its roles and responsibilities: this activity will sensitize stakeholders (farmers, their 
groups, co-operatives, service providers, women, youth, agri-business, etc.) about the need 
for a multi-stakeholder forum to develop and manage sustainable and responsive famer 
services - following the orientation, CAESCs will be formed; (ii) CAESC establishment fund: 
CAESC will be assisted to develop work plans for its area of operation, including sources of 
funds and likely partners. Based on a viable plan, the CAESC will be provided seed capital48 
for minor equipment and supplies and to support pluralistic extension services in the Ward. 
The recurring costs of CAESC will be met through budgetary subventions from the 
municipality49 via the MAU, membership fees and fees for services charged by the CAESC; 
(iii) annual CAESC participatory planning: the CAESC will be assisted to develop a 
participatory planning process to identify priorities for agriculture and livestock extension and 
services in the ward and the modalities for their delivery; (iv) Pilot a voucher system for 
provision of extension services: ASDP will, in selected municipalities, pilot an ADS-proposed 
voucher system under which users (farmers’ groups/farmers) will buy the vouchers from the 
CAESC at a price representing their contribution to the cost of services. The redemption 
value of the voucher will comprise of contributions from CAESC out of its extension budget, 
a contribution from the traders/aggregators linked to their contract with producers and the 
users’ contribution. The service provider will receive the redemption value from CAESC 
upon presenting the voucher. In case the farmers do not use the voucher, they will receive a 
refund of the price paid by them. Details of the system will be worked out by HSI following 
further consultations in the field as ASDP implementation gets underway. 
o  Private sector engagement in agriculture (including livestock) extension and service 
delivery: In harmony with the strategies outlined in the ADS and guided by the policies and 
priorities set by the municipality on the basis of MAU recommendations, support will be 
provided to develop the capacity of the private and cooperative sectors to deliver agricultural 
extension and services, both as embedded services as well as standalone businesses. 
ASDP will support one such enterprise in each of 25 rural municipalities50 chosen through 
MSP guidance. Support will be provided on the basis of viable business plans to agro-vets51 
to set up extension and service (including inputs) delivery enterprises in the selected 
municipalities. The following activities are proposed: (i) Training of Agro-Vets in 
entrepreneurship - support will be provided to train up to two potential Agro-Vet candidates 
in each of the 25 selected municipalities from among youth (women and men) who have 
already undergone training as village agriculture worker (VAW), village animal health worker 
(VAHW) or JTA; (ii) Investment support to Agro-Vets: Support will be provided to Agro-Vets 
to cover 30 per cent of their establishment investment, based on a viable business plan; 
(iii) Support for LRPs to be engaged by Agro-Vets -Support will be provided to Agro-Vets to 
engage up to three LRPs, each including at least one woman as their sales persons and 
extension agents. Support will be on a declining basis against pre-set performance 
benchmarks for three years with second and third year of engagement contingent upon 
signing a tripartite contract between the CAESC, the Agro-Vet and the LRPs; and 
(iv) Training of Agro-Vets and LRPs - support will be provided to train the contracted Agro-
Vets and up to three LRPs per Agro-Vet. 
47 The likely number of rural wards. 
48 Similar to the seed capital proposed under DSTEP in ADS 2014. The ADS had proposed that seed money would be 
provided only under the condition that it leverages larger investment by the VDC and the community/cooperatives/ 
private sector for the establishment of the CAESC. Following the same principle, ADSP contribution would be on a 
matching basis with contributions from the municipality and stakeholders in the CAESC. 
49 A GoN Directive requires that at least 15 per cent of the local block grants should be allocated to agricultural

  Farmer group development. The objective of the activity is to organise farmers into sustainable, 
50.
self-managed producer groups and commodity co-operatives so that they can remain engaged with 
value chains as growing and profitable producer businesses. This activity includes five key actions:  
o  Orienting Governments at the State and in Municipalities to ASDP – to ensure that key 
individuals in governments at the State and selected municipalities fully understand the 
ASDP concept, design and activities.  The following activities are proposed: (a) programme 
orientation at the State: A two-day PCO-implemented workshop will be conducted for the 
heads and key officials of the departments of agriculture, livestock, forestry, irrigation and 
co-operatives and the Department of Local Infrastructure Development and Agriculture 
Roads (DOLIDAR); (b) programme orientation at municipalities - a two day orientation 
workshop will be conducted in each of the 10 districts to orient the Chairperson and Vice-
chairperson, members and  the Member Secretary of the DCCs, Chairpersons/Mayors, 
Vice-chairpersons/ Deputy Mayors, Members, Administrative Officers and all Technical 
Officers (up to 4 per municipality) of the selected municipalities;  
o  Developing farmer institutions - the mobilisation of farmers, organising groups where groups 
do not exist and developing their capacities in cluster areas for SIP-identified value chains 
would be done through participatory processes by local NGOs selected jointly by the PCO 
and HSI and contracted by the PCO, one per district. Prior to floating of EOIs to seek 
investment proposals as described in output 1.2, the potential for the development of the 
selected commodity chains in each selected ward would be ascertained for focused publicity 
regarding the EOIs. Based on the EOIs shortlisted for participation, selected groups would 
be restructured to meet value chain requirements and unorganised famers integrated into 
existing or new groups. Training would be provided for the sensitization for men in producer 
organizations and related institutions to support rural women’s leadership; 
o  NGO orientation to market-led development, Most NGOs in the country, especially the 
smaller ones working locally in or around the district of their registration52 operate from 
contract to contract and do not have their own stable programmes. Most, with the exception 
of a few larger ones registered in Kathmandu and engaged in consulting and partnerships 
with multiple donors, have only one or two regular staff. Staff are recruited against 
Programmes, typically for social mobilisation roles. The Programme Coordinators and social 
mobilisers recruited by the NGOs will therefore need to be oriented to the concept, design 
and implementation modalities of ASDP and their staff. ASDP will support separate 
orientation events for the NGO coordinators and chief executives and staff members;  
o  Strengthening farmer groups: Once mobilised, groups require capacity building not only 
function effectively without external props and financial support but also to grow over time to 
attain larger goals for their members. This pertains to functions such as accounting and 
keeping minutes that promote transparency and trust; group dynamics, such as setting 
group norms, articulating values, defining a shared purpose, conflict resolution and rules of 
governance that stimulate solidarity and cohesion; strategic capacities, such as building a 
shared vision for the future, networking and business development and advocacy to create 
value for their members. Group development and training schedule and training materials 
will be developed through TA support and include: (i) membership training to stimulate 
behaviours among group members that enhance group cohesiveness, solidarity and 
efficiency; and (ii) leadership training to develop strategic capabilities of groups; develop 
resource persons in groups; introduce ideas of participatory planning, vision building and 
decision making; build capacity for conflict resolution, negotiation, networking and advocacy; 
knowledge of relevant government/regulatory policies; leadership rotation and good 
governance practices; 
52 All NGOs in Nepal have to register with the District Administrative Office of the district where they are Headquartered 
under a 2034 (1977) law applicable to all kinds of civil society organisations. They can work outside the district of 
registration by setting up a project office or registering a local branch with a local executive committee.

Final programme design report 
o  Consolidation of groups into commodity co-operatives: In order to realise scale of 
economies and enhance bargaining power, the groups will be consolidated into co-
operatives, commodity-wise. It is proposed to form co-operatives with 150 to 200 members, 
with possibility of expansion in future as more households join the respective value chains. 
Consolidation will be initiated when groups have stabilised and expanded as more groups 
mature in the specific commodity. Consolidation around commodities is proposed as 
services, market linkages, credit delivery and value addition (sorting, grading, packaging) 
opportunities will be commodity-specific. Cooperative formation will begin in the second 
year, expand as new clusters/groups develop and will be completed by the fifth year so that 
the last of the co-operatives have time to settle down before Programme completion. Small 
lump-sum support will be provided to each cooperative to meet initial establishment 
expenses and training costs. 
  Output 4.2. Women’s empowerment and household nutrition. The objective of this output is to 
51.
empower women, particularly within their household, and, through that process, to enable them to 
better manage household agricultural development, growth and family nutrition. This output has two 
activities: (i) women’s empowerment; and (ii) household nutrition 
o  Women’s empowerment. Socially, women and girls in Nepal are disadvantaged by 
traditional practices like the dowry system, early marriage, son-preference, stigmatization of 
widows, seclusion of women (purdah), family violence, polygamy, and the segregation of 
women and girls during menstruation (chhaupadi, which has recently been banned). Women 
face an onerous triple burden as their role of caretaker is taken for granted and thus their 
economic contribution goes largely unnoticed. The Programme will begin to address these 
issues through the following actions: 
 
A Gender and social inclusion (GESI) action plan will assess the overall situation of 
women farmers, evaluate disaggregated information on the extent of agriculture 
extension service outreach, and assess the existing institutional mechanism and 
capacity needs of the executing agencies/implementing agencies on GESI; 
  Drudgery reduction technology: The Programme will carry out a study assessing the 
various technologies that are available for reducing women’s drudgery to provide with 
simple and reasonably priced technologies that can be distributed as a pilot 
Programme to some women’s groups. The Programme will also, where identified as a 
community need, construct multipurpose water infrastructure to serve the irrigation, 
washing and safe drinking water needs of the community, thereby decreasing the 
time adult and young women spend in fetching water; 
  Household Methodology: The Programme will implement the Household Methodology 
(HHM) as a pilot in about 4,000 households. The HHM approach assists household 
members to realize that inequalities in gender roles and relations can be part of the 
reason they stay poor. The HHM approach, which will be tailored to fit cultural norms 
in the Programme, will: (i) assist household members to define their own strategies for 
developing and improving their livelihoods, based on their goals, strengths, 
opportunities and assets; (ii) empower individuals or groups to make choices and to 
transform those choices into desired actions and outcomes by placing them (women 
and men of all ages) in the driver’s seat of the development process; and (iii) ensure 
that women and men, as well as youth, people with disabilities and other vulnerable 
groups, have an equal voice in setting the household vision and equal access to 
development opportunities, productive assets, decision-making and benefits; 
  Gender training, capacity building and communication: The Programme will adopt the 
following guidelines for making trainings and capacity building gender sensitive: 
(i) adapt programmes to women's needs and skills; (ii) ensure that the training venue 
is accessible and safe for women and can accommodate children who are under their 
care if required; (iii) allow sufficient time to enable women to acquire new skills and 
16 
Nepal 
Agriculture Sector Development Programme 
Final programme design report 
adjust schedules to fit women's existing workloads; (iv) adapt the time of the trainings 
to the time availability of the women; (v) ensure that the language is simple and 
catered towards the understanding levels of the participants; (vi) make all teaching 
methods and learning approaches inclusive, participatory and “gender transformatory” 
in order to ensure women's full and equal participation; 
  Women in construction: The Programme will ensure the safety and security of women 
who will work as construction workers in the ASDP-financed infrastructure 
development (Sub-component 2). Prior to building the infrastructure, a robust social 
and environmental assessment will take place, which will consider all gender 
concerns and map out social constraints. A set of guidelines53 that will be developed 
to be applied when implementing the infrastructure component. 
o  Household nutrition. The Multi-Sectoral Nutrition Plan (MSNP) 2013-2017 serves as a 
common results framework for improving nutrition outcomes; and setting out plans of action 
for implementing nutrition-sensitive policies and strategies for key sectors, including 
agriculture. The Programme proposes to support supply side nutrition interventions through 
homestead gardens for disadvantaged households and the implementation of nutrition-
sensitive value chains (goat meat, milk, apple, walnut, highly nutritious crops) and the 
demand side through farmer nutrition schools and nutrition BCC. 
 
Supply-side nutrition interventions: The Programme will support poor Dalit, Janajati 
and women-headed households to develop homestead gardens producing traditional 
food crops like nettles, garden cress, traditional tubers, etc. that can be grown in small 
patches of land to supplement diets54. Where required, this will be supported by multi-
purpose water supply. The Programme will, as part of the SIP process, also evaluate 
the market potential for goat meat, milk, apple, walnut and nutritious crops including 
buckwheat, minor millets, upland beans and the orange-fleshed sweet potato.   
  Demand-side nutrition interventions: HVAP value chain beneficiaries have doubled 
their household income. The Programme will support the State training and health 
information departments to expand and intensify their implementation of BCC 
activities, established under the MSNP. The BCC programme, which will target 
women and adolescent girls, will be supported by household “nutrition schools,” held 
every two months, which will be facilitated by ASDP gender, nutrition and social 
mobilisers and the government health department. Those nutrition schools will cover 
nutritious food production and collection, and food preparation storage and 
processing to retain nutritional value and assure food safety. This will be supported by 
a pilot No Junk Food Campaign, to be conducted in a number of villages with the 
technical support of the health department. 
 
Partnerships: In addition to supporting the implementation of the national MSNP, the 
ASDP will work closely with the USAID-financed Suaahara II55 health and nutrition 
project which is operational in six Programme districts (Rolpa, Salyan, Rukum, 
Surkhet, Jajarkot and Dailekh). 
o  Youth interventions in ASDP. Presently there is a thrust to increase the skills in vocational 
training across the country and led by the government through various donors. Youth 
targeting will be a two-pronged approach. The interventions will target both educated and 
uneducated male and female youths. The Programme will identify such training where 
employment will be easily available in the rural areas If required, the Programme will also re 
design training curriculums to suit the demands of the profession eg: for the Junior

Technician Assistants (JTAs) or agro-vet. A sub course on entrepreneurship will enable the 
trainees to become more business oriented.  
Lessons learned and adherence to National and IFAD policies and the 
SECAP56 
  The Programme is aligned with the key lesson’s learned cited in the 2013 COSOP, including: 
52.
(i) new projects should include measures to strengthen local government capacities to provide 
responsive and inclusive services to the rural population; (ii) new projects should build more on 
partnerships with non-governmental players, including NGOs and the private sector; (ii) grass-roots 
groups are not sustainable when created for the sole purpose of channelling project services; (iv) the 
organization of support services and project activities must be compatible with women’s time 
constraints and preferences; (v) M&E should become a management tool, complemented by 
knowledge management; and (vi) project management should involve mixed teams composed of 
hired staff supporting civil servants.  
  The 2013 Country Programme Evaluation recommended a two-pronged strategy in Nepal, 
53.
combining a strong commercial agriculture approach with the second prong focused on a ‘basic needs 
paradigm’, where the realistic ambition would be to alleviate poverty and meet basic needs during a 
long-term process in which youth gradually leave the communities. It also identified the importance of 
adopting a demand rather than supply-driven project approach, noting the “supply-driven culture of 
government agencies, where the focus was on delivering the activities and outputs targeted in annual 
work plans, rather than on working on household demand and ensuring sustainable impact”. The 
evaluation also noted the need to: (i) focus on developing commercially viable rural enterprises/ 
groups/co-operatives; (ii) develop partnerships with private service providers, buyers and input 
suppliers; (iii) work in targeted areas and on high-value commodities; (iv) improve access to rural 
financial services, avoiding project-targeted credit; and (v) avoid too ambitious policy agendas, with 
IFAD and the Government instead jointly identify relevant policy issues and imbedding them within the 
design and implementation of Programmes. 
  More contemporarily, the Programme design mission explored lessons learned from the on-
54.
going portfolio of value chain-focused Programmes in Nepal57. They include: 
 
 
 
 
Programme-supported value chain development should be preceded by detailed value 
chain analysis and strategic investment planning validated through participatory multi-
stakeholder platforms;  
agriculture value chain development should be led by the private sector, namely by key 
“gatekeepers” to customer access, typically private agribusinesses and supermarkets, 
not government agencies; 
incentive payments for business-oriented behavioural change at industry and producer 
levels should be designed and 
priced to mitigate associate risk 
and not serve as a credit 
substitute;  
investment incentive payments 
must ensure “additionality” — 
the extent to which an activity 
(and associated outputs, 
outcomes and impacts) is 
larger in scale, at a higher 
The HVAP has been remarkably successful in including poor and marginalised 
households into the value chains it has supported, as demonstrated in the chart

quality, takes place quicker, takes place at a different location, or takes place at all as a 
result of intervention;58  
once a desired behavioural change has been profitably demonstrated in an agro-
ecological zone, and financial markets developed, value chain financing should be 
supplied through financial markets; 
initial value chain development is typically driven by middle income farmers who can 
more easily meet the market requirements in terms of quality and quantity of products, 
but often draws in poor household once perceived risks have been mollified and 
transaction costs reduced; 
inequalities are embedded in the rural society and are difficult to level. Marginalised 
people’s role in decision making is still secondary to prominent people (community and 
group leaders) who communicate and respond positively to development interventions 
and embrace economic opportunities; 
farmer groups and agribusinesses are willing to pay for quality private services as a part 
of a viable business plan;  
market-linked infrastructure development is an integral part of inclusive value chain 
establishment and growth promotion, but must be well designed, sustainable and climate 
adapted;  
rural financial services institutions (Banks, MFIs, co-operatives etc.) need capacity 
building, risk management strategies and more diversified loan products to adequately 
service agriculture value chain financing; and 
In the absence of appropriate rural financial services, agriculture value chain investments 
are unlikely to be scalable.

  Adherence to national policies. The Tenth Plan 2002-2007 (Poverty Reduction Strategy 
55.
Paper) and current  14th three (3) years Plan (2017/18-2019/20) call for sustained and inclusive 
growth to allow poor, marginalized and climate vulnerable communities to benefit more substantially 
from economic growth and socio-economic development. The ADS action plan and roadmap propose 
a vision of a “reliant, sustainable, competitive, and inclusive agricultural sector that drives economic 
growth and contributes to improved livelihoods and food and nutrition security”. The ADS envisages 
accelerated agricultural sector growth being achieved through four strategic components related to 
governance, productivity, profitable commercialization, and competitiveness while promoting 
inclusiveness (both social and geographic), sustainability (both natural resources and economic), the 
development of the private and cooperative sectors, and connectivity to market, power and 
information infrastructure. The resulting inclusive, sustainable, multi-sector, and connectivity-based 
growth is expected to result in increased food and nutrition security, poverty reduction, agricultural 
trade competitiveness, higher and more equitable income of rural households. The National 
Adaptation Programme for Action (NAPA) has identified integrated management of agriculture, water, 
forests and biodiversity as some of its priority areas of development, along with climate adaptation 
capacity building for the vulnerable communities and households. The objective of the Multisector 
Nutrition Plan (MSNP) 2103-2017 is to significantly reduce chronic malnutrition so that it no longer 
becomes an impediment to improving human capital and for overall socio-economic development. In 
the agriculture sector, it focuses on the development of micronutrient-rich food crops and animal 
protein. The ASDP adheres to the basic tenants of these four key national strategies/plans. 
  Adherence to IFAD Policies and the SECAP. The ASDP is strongly aligned IFAD’s 
56.
overarching objective, as detailed in the IFAD Strategic Framework 2016 – 2025, that: "poor rural 
people overcome poverty and achieve food security through remunerative, sustainable and resilient 
livelihoods." The Programme takes into account key IFAD policies and strategies relating to targeting, 
gender, land, ethnic peoples and CC and contributes to both the overarching objective of the strategic 
framework and its three Strategic Objectives: (i) increase poor rural people’s productive capacities; 
(ii) increase poor rural people’s benefits from market participation and (iii) strengthen the

environmental sustainability and climate resilience of poor rural people’s economic activities. Key 
areas of the Strategic Framework’s thematic foci that the ASDP addresses include: (i) diversified rural 
enterprise and employment opportunities; (ii) rural investment environment; (iii) rural producers’ 
organizations; (iv) rural infrastructure; (v) access to agricultural technologies and production services; 
(vi) climate change; and (vii) nutrition. Consistent with the strategies “principles of engagement”, 
people from marginalized groups, in particular women, indigenous peoples and youth will be 
proactively supported and empowered to enable their equal participation in Programme economic 
activities. Women’s labour burden will be reduced, inclusive, effective and sustainable rural groups 
and institutions will be established or strengthened and their access to the assets, technologies, 
services and profitable markets enhanced, while the market-oriented VC approach, when combined 
with supporting infrastructure, financial and technology services, provides a pathway to sustainability 
and scalability (see Appendix 12 for detailed discussion). 
  The SECAP describes a Programme area that features a great diversity of socio-economic, 
57.
physical, natural and climate conditions. Programme districts have a high poverty incidence, offer 
challenging conditions for agricultural production and are relatively isolated from the rest of the 
country, hindering access to services and markets for the rural population. Linkage to transport 
networks is an essential component of successful development. In the target districts, per capita 
income, education and life expectancy are among the lowest in Nepal. More than 69 groups of various 
cast/ethnicity are present in the area with Chhetri and Kami the most represented groups in all 
10 districts. Comprising middle hills, high hills and mountains, with mostly relatively poor soils for 
agriculture production, the Programme area is biologically and environmentally diverse and highly 
susceptible to climate change. The Programme will address these constraints by targeting profitable 
commodities and production areas where road infrastructure either exists or is under development 
through community-driven initiatives aligned to municipal master plans. It also adopts an inclusive, 
community-driven and commercialized approach to farmer group development and agricultural 
service delivery. All Programme technology and infrastructure investments will be climate adapted and 
new agricultural institutions emerging from the constitutionally-driven change process will be 
community-governed and Programme supported. 
III.  Programme implementation 
A.
  Approach 
  The ADS envisages accelerated agricultural sector growth through four strategic components 
58.
related to governance, productivity, profitable commercialization, and competitiveness, while 
promoting inclusion, sustainability, connectivity and private sector/cooperative development. The 
ASDP approach follows a parallel path, though it will be less engaged in sector governance, which is 
being strengthened through European Union (EU) TA to the four MoAD ADS Flagship Groups59. The 
Programme will identify financially and economically viable agricultural commodities with market 
growth and value addition potential across the main agri-ecosystems in State 6. This process will be 
facilitated by ASDP-convened Multi-Stakeholder Platforms (MSP) for each commodity, designed to 
link key stakeholders along potential value chains. MSPs, which, over time will be empowered to 
become self-governing, will include farmer representatives, private sector actors (traders, processors, 
input suppliers, investors, finance institutions) and government actors (research, education, 
extension). In addition to building value chain partnerships, MSPs will also identify opportunities and 
technical and capacity constraints that then can be addressed through Programme supported, 
outcome-based training and research. The Programme, in partnership with MSPs, will invite national 
and international agri-businesses and entrepreneurs to co-invest in key processing infrastructure for 
the development of the respective commodity value chains. The confirmation of such “market 
gatekeeper” investment will trigger Programme support to stakeholders along the value chain, 
including traders, transporters and commodity producers. More than one “market gatekeeper” could

be identified for a particular commodity. In general, the Programme will support investors who 
(i) require the least co-financing as a percentage of the total investment; (ii) show the highest 
profitability and value addition; and (iii) have business strategies/plans that better include 
disadvantaged groups and areas. The Programme will not support commodity production where there 
is no clear access to profitable markets.  
  To ensure access to the service required for value chain development, the Programme will 
59.
strengthen infrastructure, financial and technical services along value chains. Value chain “production 
products” will be carefully selected based on agro-climatic conditions, production infrastructure, 
population density and access to markets. Production pocket areas will be progressively expanded 
through access to improved public (village roads, trails and trail bridges, markets and collection 
centres, etc.) and collective (small-scale irrigation, local storage, multi-purpose water supply, etc.) 
infrastructure. Those infrastructure investments will be identified through a Local Body-led 
participatory planning approach that matches value chain and community-identified needs with 
municipal plans. Investments, depending on their type, will be co-financed in various combinations by 
the Programme, value chain stakeholders and the municipality. 
  The Programme will also build value chain stakeholder access to financial services. This will be 
60.
achieved by strengthening grass-roots co-operatives and MFIs and providing them and banks and 
insurance companies with a broader range of financial and insurance products better suited to value 
chain financing. Where possible, the Programme will link rural financial service providers with 
products and financing being developed/offered by other financial service development projects and 
private banks in Nepal. Rural co-operatives and MFIs will be invited to improve their services through 
institutional reform, including amalgamation to meet minimum scale requirements, capacity building 
and financial information system software upgrading. The Programme will recruit specialised national 
service providers to support cooperative and rural MFI strengthening under performance-based 
contracts. 
61.
In accordance with the ADS and the NASDP, the Programme will establish MAUs and CAESCs 
at municipal and ward levels respectively. These measures are seen contributing to the decentralised 
agriculture development process as provisioned in the Constitution of Nepal. Originally envisaged as 
a VDC-level institution that is now replaced by the ADS-sponsored CAESC and its board, and with the 
cessation of the district as an administrative centre, the Programme proposes the establishment of the 
MAU at municipal levels as the entry point for agriculture development activities in the municipality. 
MAU’s will be chaired by the municipal deputy mayor/vice-chairperson and include elected municipal 
representatives and representatives of farmer and agri-business organizations in the municipality. 
Women will be not less than 50 per cent of CAESC members with proportionate representation of 
Dalits and Janajatis. The CAESC will become the nodal point of decentralised and pluralistic 
extension and research at the local level through: (i) institutional and individual capacity development 
at municipal and at ward levels; (ii) support to the formulation of guidelines, bylaws on decentralised 
and pluralistic extension and research at local level with increased accountability; (ii) organising joint 
stakeholder monitoring, peer monitoring and cross district exchanges for learning and exchange; and 
(iv) mobilising local service providers to develop specific strengthening activities. 
  Through awareness and capacity building activities initiated by the municipal officers for 
62.
agriculture, forestry and livestock, and HSI support, the Programme will facilitate the establishment of 
CAESCs in each Ward. The CAESC will be formed by local communities and will be governed by a 
Board including representatives of local communities, co-operatives, farmer organizations, and agri-
enterprises. Women will be not less than 50 per cent of board members with proportionate 
representation of Dalits and Janajatis. Initial funding of the CAESC will be provided by a combination 
of ward and municipal funding (using the 15 per cent guideline for agriculture investment60), seed 
funding from the ASDP, and contributions of the different groups of stakeholders represented in the 
Board. Each CAESC will be fully managed by its Board and will recruit its own extension workers. The 
60 A GoN Directive requires that at least 15 per cent of the local block grants should be allocated to agricultural development and services and it 
has been attached with the Minimum Condition Performance Measure. 
21 
Nepal 
Agriculture Sector Development Programme 
Final programme design report 
management of the financial and human resources of the CAESC will be fully dependent on the Board 
of the CAESC. The flagship Decentralized Extension, Science, Technology, and Education Program 
(DESTEP) will provide the overall guidance for the development of CAESCs. The recurrent and 
programme costs of the CAESC will be borne by the Ward and the community centres themselves. 
The CAESCs will be linked to municipal, state-level and national extension systems through 
information exchange, training, and technical backstopping.  
63.
  The Programme, with HSI support, will apply a Human Rights Based Approach (HRBA) that 
focuses on accountable service delivery (fulfilment of rights or entitlements) by supporting the duty 
bearers to fulfill their obligations and strengthening the rights holders (beneficiaries) to claim the 
services and entitlements responsibly. This will include: (i) applying the principle of Rule of Law; 
(ii) empowering the rights holders and duty bearers; (iii) ensuring equality and non-discrimination; 
promoting the participation and inclusion of the rights holders and ensuring accountability of the duty 
and responsibility bearers i.e. role analysis. This will be applied across the Programme, but will be 
particularly relevant to Sub-component 4, Output 4.1.

on technical solutions to identified problems or on the development of participatory action research to 
identify solutions. 
  Programme Coordination Office. A PCO will be established at Birendranagar in Surkhet 
67.
district of State 6 to assist the PSC in coordination of the participating agencies and municipalities and 
wards in actual management of GoN and IFAD resources. The PCO would facilitate Programme 
implementation both by working through private and public-sector implementation agencies (MSPs, 
Municipalities, MAUs, CAESCs, Agro-vets, LRPs, etc.) and through more direct implementation for 
activities such as rural financial services. The PCO will report directly to the PSC, acting as its 
Secretariat.  The MoAD decision on the establishment of the PCO and TORs of the PCO should 
ensure that the PCO functions on behalf of the Secretary, MoAD. The PCO will include a 
management team of government-deputed officers, including a senior agriculture officer deputed from 
State 6, a technical team of externally recruited experts, and support staff hired by the PCO.  
  The mandate of the PCO will be to ensure: (i) coherence of the Programme approaches and 
68.
strategies, and integration among Programme activities in order to produce the Programme 
outcomes, outputs and impact; (ii) coordination and synergy of the co-implementing agencies and 
technical service providers, and the municipal level agencies, and grassroots communities; 
(iii) contracting of suitable service providers to undertake various forms of research, studies, technical 
assistance and training; (iv) accountable management of IFAD and Government’s resources, 
including preparation of the PIM, AWPBs, procurement plans, selection of technical assistance and 
audit service providers, establishment and operation of M&E and MIS systems, and other functions of 
the operational and financial management of the Programme; and (vi) knowledge sharing in 
collaboration with co-implementing agencies.  
  PCO staffing. Key Programme staff would include a Programme Coordinator, a senior 
69.
agriculture officer (deputed from State 6), a planning officer,  an account officer  and support staff  
deputed from the civil service. A set of technical staff covering funds and contract management, , 
financial management and procurement, ,  value chain development, engineering, institutional 
development, rural finance, climate change, gender and nutrition, monitoring and evaluation (M&E),  
knowledge management (KM), information technology and support staff will be hired on a contractual 
basis. The Programme would also establish three field teams, all contracted staff, working along the 
four main road corridors having business, engineering, social/gender, finance institution and M&E/KM 
skills. An ASDP Liaison office would be maintained in Kathmandu. The Programme would be 
governed by a Programme Steering Committee (PSC), chaired by the Secretary, MoAD. With SDC

grant funding, HSI will be a co-implementer of the agricultural services programme, sub-component 
4.62.  
  Municipal-level Programme Implementation Coordination63. Municipal Assemblies and 
70.
Municipal Councils will have overall responsibility for the Programme in their respective municipality. 
Each participating municipality will have municipal-staffed agriculture and livestock officers who, with 
the support of the Programme mobile teams and PCO specialists, will facilitate Programme 
implementation in their municipalities. An MAU will be established in each municipality (see para.  61). 
The  DCC will provide oversight for municipal programmes within district boundaries. 
  Elected Ward Committees (WCs) will be involved in the Programme implementation in the 
71.
targeted wards. The Ward’s CAESC Board (see para. Error! Reference source not found.) will be 
the focal point for coordinating the overall implementation of Programme interventions and activities 
by the related implementing agencies at ward level. 
  Gender in the Organisation: Unlike HVAP, ASDP will ensure that at least 20 per cent women 
72.
are recruited to middle and senior management levels. There will be additional scores for women in 
the recruitment process. If women candidates are found to excel in the recruitment process, they will 
be recruited and paid on par with their male colleagues. The Programme will maintain the maternity 
leave rule as applicable to all government establishments. If it is seen, that there are a number of 
small children of women staff within the PCO, the Programme will establish/or recruit the services of a 
crèche and the provision of a nanny. The operation and maintenance of the crèche can be equitably 
shared by the Programme and the staff. The Programme will deem to have flexi working hours to 
accommodate household and child care chores that the women staff members have to carry out in 
their personal life. The Programme will set up a Sexual Harassment Committee to address any 
complain of sexual harassment across all levels of the Programme and will also include the social 
mobilisers recruited by the NGOs. All Programme staff will be provided with training on sexual 
harassment at workplace on a yearly basis. There will be, on a yearly basis, a gender and social 
inclusion sensitisation and gender and social inclusion in value chain training for all staff across all 
levels. 
  Partnerships. The mission has met with development partners supporting GoN in the 
73.
implementation of market- led agriculture development and rural financial and technical services 
delivery with the aim of aligning the ASDP with lessons learned from those programmes, seeking 
complementarities and partnerships where possible. SDC has agreed to fund HSI to manage the 
ASDP extension service development and value chain stakeholder alignment. The mission has also 
reached an understanding with the ADB concerning its planned support for district road construction; 
the DFiD’s RAP III on community infrastructure development and with both Sakchyam and Kisan II 
projects for financial services to VC stakeholders. Other points of collaboration will be identified during 
Programme implementation.  
  Government partners. The LPA - MoAD is currently the regulatory body mandated to lead the 
74.
implementation of  the ADS in Nepal. The ADS provides the overall strategic guidance framework for 
agriculture sector development, however, its implementation poses a range of technical and cultural 
challenges for MoAD management and staff. It is expected that the ADS will undergo revisions to 
accommodate the federalization of the Government of Nepal.  On completion of the revision, the 
ASDP Design Document and Implementation arrangements will be revised in alignment with the ADS.  
The Programme will work closely with the ADS Coordination Unit within the MoAD to support a 
change in service delivery from its current top-down and public-sector service delivery modality to one 
where MoAD coordinates, technically supervises and monitors a pluralistic extension system largely 
delivered through municipalities, MAUs and CAESCs. The Programme will also strengthen 
government partner skills in the fields of Programme management, M&E, gender mainstreaming, 
climate change adaptation and knowledge management. 
62 HVAP model. 
63 There are both Urban and Rural Municipalities, the latter defined as “Village” in some communications. As the Programme is expected 
to work across both types of Municipalities no distinction is made in this document between the two types of municipality.

Agriculture Sector Development Programme 
Final programme design report 
  HSI is implementing the SDC-supported NASDP in nine districts across four States, including 
75.
three (Dailekh, Jajarkot, Kalikot) in State 6. The ASDP initiatives proposed here are similar to those 
included in the NASDP. SDC will support the ASDP, providing a grant of USD 3.0 million for TA 
implemented by HSI to expand the coverage of NASDP to ASDP impact areas in all 10 districts, with 
specific focus on organising and capacitating farmer groups and co-operatives and provision of 
pluralistic services to farmer’s groups linked to the value chains selected under ASDP. SDC will 
transfer TA fund to HSI directly. 
  NGOs and implementation support. Under the current constitutional setup, municipalities will 
76.
become the key administration and development entity in Nepal. Given that this reform is just 
beginning, it is anticipated that municipalities will need strong support for effective Programme 
implementation. The Programme will work closely with NGOs of proven competence and 
sustainability, particularly in supporting and capacitating the decentralised pluralistic extension 
system, community participatory planning, cooperative and MFI institutional reform and gender 
development and nutrition support at municipal level. 
  Private sector. Private enterprises, co-operatives, farmers’ organizations, lead farmers and 
77.
LRPs and farmers’ groups engaged in commodity production, the supply of goods and services, 
commodity processing, marketing or related fields will participate in Programme implementation as 
co-financiers and/or service providers. Free standing MSPs will support coordination along value 
chains 
  Academic and research organizations. The Programme will, through MSPs, engage academics 
78.
and research organizations under performance-based contracts for capacity building of value chain 
stakeholders and technical problem solving along value chain processes.  
  MAUs and CAESCs. The establishment of MAUs under Municipal Councils and CAESCs under 
79.
Ward Committees will strengthen the grassroots-level management and operational capacity, 
fostering community-governed and equitable representation and participation of the vulnerable groups 
in community decision making structure. 
  Community-level farmers’ organizations. Support to the farmers’ organizations in the forms of 
80.
groups or co-operatives, and the establishment of beneficiary self-managed O&M committees will 
foster grassroots organization of rural women and men, through sustainable, self-governed 
mechanisms, established in pursuit of enhanced self-development, management, and climate 
adapted production and marketing. 
Planning, M&E, learning and knowledge management 
Planning 
  Annual Work Plans and Budgets. The 14th Periodic Plan 2017/18 – 2019/20 is the principal 
81.
GoN development planning document. Successful ASDP implementation requires the Programme 
AWPB planning process to effectively articulate the views of various public (government) institutions 
at various levels , private entities, farmers’ groups and communities.  
  The ASDP budget process will be conducted in line with national procedures, which require 
82.
consultation with all stakeholders, including beneficiaries. In the first year, the PCO will provide 
training workshops on the Programme strategy and approaches, AWPB, and procurement procedures 
for key stakeholders. This will ensure an accurate and shared understanding of the Programme 
strategy, procedures and information needs. 
83.
Investment planning at the community level will be through participatory processes engaging 
farmer’s groups and communities participating in Programme-supported value chains. This process 
will ensure the inclusion of disadvantaged groups, who may be provided with an independent forum to 
develop and express their opinions if required. The participatory process will, with Programme and 
HSI support, be coordinated at Ward level by the CAESC Board and staff.

Final programme design report 
In accordance with current MoF decisions, the PCO would be the “Cost Centre” for 
84.
disbursement of funds to beneficiaries and/or implementing agencies. The Programme will revise its 
disbursement strategies in accordance with prevailing GoN regulations, including devolution 
of conditional funding for activities implemented by the municipality, on completion of a 
fiduciary due diligence of the municipality as a cost center.  
  The approval of ASDP IPs by Local Body (Municipal) Executives would be based on the 
85.
recommendations of the Municipal Agriculture Unit (MAU) in response to competitive farmer group IPs 
that have undergone a bipartisan Field Verification by the Ward-level Community Agriculture 
Extension Service Centres (CAESCs) and PCO/HSI technical/administration teams64. Once Ward-
level IPs have been prioritised and approved by the MAU in accordance with the budget limits set by 
the PCO, that Unit would forward the IPs to the Local Body (Municipal) Executive for no-objection and 
subsequent request to the ASDP Project Coordinator (PC) for financing. The IPs would be included in 
the ASDPresults-based annual work programme and budget (RB-AWPB), and, the PCO would 
prepare a quadripartite contract (Municipality, Ward, beneficiary and PCO) on which basis the PC 
would release ASDP funds to contract-identified beneficiaries.  
  The PCO will be responsible for the generation of investment plans (IPs) not directly derived 
86.
from the municipality-related investments under Sub-component 2 and Sub-component 4. PCO 
budget planning responsibilities will include co-financing of agri-business co-financing investments 
under Sub-component 1, the provision of PCO specialist support, TA and training under Sub-
component 1 and Sub-component 3, and the requirements for Programme Management. The PCO 
will ensure coordination of these activities between other government agencies and externally 
financed Programmes in the Programme area. The Programme level RB-AWPB will explain key 
issues, objectives, focus of the annual work plan and budget, rationale for setting specific targets, and 
the planning process in a narrative text.. The RIMS indicators are required to be included in the RB-
AWPB so that this becomes the basis for preparing the annual RIMS report. It may be noted that the 
RB-AWPB template is a planning tool at the beginning of the year, monitoring tool during 
implementation and a reporting tool at the end of the year. At the end of the fiscal year, the RB-AWPB 
- duly completed with annual and cumulative achievements will be annexed to the Annual Progress 
Report. Thus, a link will be created between the annual planning exercise, the M&E activities and the 
annual reporting exercise. The PC will be ultimately responsible for preparing the draft RB-AWPBs in 
an accurate and timely manner.  
  The draft RB-AWPBs will be submitted to the PSC for review and approval. The approved draft 
87.
RB-AWPB will then be transmitted to IFAD for comments and no objection no later than sixty days 
before the beginning of the relevant Programme year. The GoN budget approval process will follow 
national procedures and will be in accordance with the country system. The ASDP-approved budget 
will be transmitted to MoAD for review and discussion. After MoAD approval, the budget will be 
transmitted to MoF and the National Planning Commission (NPC); MoF will review and approve the 
funding, NPC will review and approve the activities. An Annual Stakeholder Review and Planning 
Workshops at which Annual Performance Report findings and management implications will be 
discussed will support the RB-AWPB preparation process. 
Monitoring and evaluation 
  Building off the HVAP M&E/MIS system, the M&E and KM Specialist will assist the PCO to 
88.
maintain a central data system to compile overall monitoring and evaluation information, and conduct 
studies to measure overall impacts. The M&E system will monitor performance and assess the impact 
of Programme activities. Monitoring will focus on activities/inputs, outputs, outcomes and performance 
and risks, while evaluation will assess the relevance, efficiency, effectiveness and impact on poverty 
reduction, agri-business environment and growth and environment, empowerment and partnership, 
sustainability, replicability, lessons learned, and knowledge up-take. The M&E system will cover both 
the operational and financial aspects of the Programme. To a large extent, the M&E system will be 
26 
Nepal 
Agriculture Sector Development Programme 
Final programme design report 
participatory, involving the supported farmer groups, wards and municipalities in data collection and 
management.  
  The PCO will develop a specific M&E Plan within two months of Programme start up. It will 
89.
define the data gathering sources and methods, and roles and responsibilities of different 
stakeholders. The M&E Plan, will build off the existing HVAP M&E processes and be informed by the 
following principles that derive from lessons learnt from previous IFAD funded Programmes in Nepal: 
(i) simple M&E processes and methods; (ii) clear roles and responsibilities for stakeholders; 
(iii) harmonization of information and reporting requirements of the stakeholders through alignment to 
the existing planning, monitoring and reporting processes; (iv) sufficient capacity building on gender 
responsive M&E and KM through targeted trainings; and (v) strong linkages between planning, M&E 
and knowledge management. 
  The HVAP M&E has three distinct tools: (i) Result and Impact Management System (RIMS), (ii) 
90.
Programme log frame and (iii) Donor Committee for Enterprise Development Standard (DCEDS) 
which has been developed for all enterprise related Programmes by donors and looks mainly at the 
results chain. These tools will continue to exist and will be built upon to address the nuances of the 
new Programme. The Standard IFAD Monitoring and Evaluation System (SIMES) will no longer apply. 
The Programme will be responsible for identifying COSOP related indicators in its logframe. In 
conjunction with the trimestral reports, the Programme will report against these indicators (in addition 
to reporting on the RIMS indicators) to the IFAD country office in Nepal. The nutrition and women’s 
empowerment indicators will be developed at the pre-Programme stage with the help of the TA 
specialists who will be recruited by the Programme to develop and implement the two indices. The 
Programme will identify the relevant indicators for the DCEDS that they have to monitor and 
periodically report against. These indicators will be included in the MIS to facilitate collection and 
analysis. 
  The Programme will assess any gaps in the current HVAP MIS and progressively refine it in the 
91.
light of experience during the first Programme year. It will be based on the Logical Framework, which, 
together with the MIS, may be modified at Programme Mid-term Review (MTR) to adjust the 
Programmes to changing circumstances. The preparation of reporting formats for use by 
implementing agencies, particularly the participating municipalities and other partners will be part of 
the overall upgrading of the HVAP MIS. 
  Monitoring. Monitoring will be an integral part of the Programme coordination role. All staff will 
92.
be involved in strengthening Programme progress and performance monitoring in their particular 
areas of responsibility. A large part of the monitoring will be collected and communicated by the 
Programme beneficiaries. The monitoring will provide triannual and annual feedback on the extent to 
which the Programme is achieving its outputs, implementing the activities, identifying potential 
problems at an early stage and proposing possible solutions. The accessibility of the Programme to all 
sectors of the target population, as well as the technical and financial efficiency will be monitored and 
possible improvements suggested. Geo-referencing will be used to the extent possible. 
  Monitoring indicators have been selected for each of the Programme’s outcomes as detailed in 
93.
the Logical Framework. Programme results and impacts will be reported in sex and ethnicity 
disaggregated formats, and gender monitoring tools will be integrated into the M&E process, which 
also includes a women’s minimum dietary diversity index. The Programme will involve target groups in 
data collection through the maintenance of farm management diaries, individual interviews, focus 
group discussion and case studies. To assist the collection and entry of data, the Programme will 
introduce an internship component, whereby young educated youth who have either passed high 
school or who are in school can be paid a small stipend to collect Programme data. This could also be 
done by the LRPs, Junior Technician Assistants (JTAs), etc. for a fee.  
94.
  Programme training will be competency-based. The performance of training activities will be 
monitored through pre- and post-training knowledge tests with a further test 6-12 months post-training 
to determine knowledge retention and adoption. It will not be possible to monitor all training events at 
27 
Nepal 
Agriculture Sector Development Programme 
Final programme design report 
this level; however, random competency monitoring will be applied to all typologies of training events 
across the Programme life.  
  The M&E and KM staff will ensure that information and analyses developed by the Programme 
95.
is fed back to relevant stakeholders. 
  Evaluation: Programme evaluation will include: (i) annual outcome/impact evaluations and 
96.
(ii) thematic evaluation. At the same time, full reviews at mid-term and Programme-end will be 
conducted by IFAD and GoN.  
97.
Impact evaluation: Programme impact will be measured from the baseline data, at mid-term 
and at Programme-end. The HVAP completion survey will be modified to provide the ASDP baseline 
and a platform of information from which the follow-on surveys could reveal changes in the 
households' livelihoods. Similarly, the Mid-term Survey and the Completion Survey will be carried to 
inform the MTR and PCR. These follow-on surveys will be carried out in the same manner as the 
Baseline Survey, visiting the same geo-referenced households so that developments in the course of 
Programme participation can be measured, and household members who have left the Programme 
area as a result of finding employment elsewhere will be captured as well. These three surveys will be 
carried out in conformity with IFAD's Results and Impact Management System (RIMS) reporting 
requirements. They will use the standard RIMS questionnaire form to collect key beneficiary data, 
including household assets and base data used to establish the prevalence of child malnutrition in 
participating households, adjusted to reflect the characteristics of the Programme area and activities. 
The RIMS surveys will also be adapted to include data related to extra indicators from the Programme 
logframe. The participating households will be randomly selected from the Programme wards.  
  As the Programme will be establishing investments using business principles and business 
98.
plans, there is the opportunity to use data generated during the planning and operation of such 
investments to provide for impact assessment. The intention is that the pre-Programme baseline and 
the operational data (profit and loss, return on investment, returns to labour etc.) will provide the 
impact assessment at the micro-economic level. (See Monitoring Framework for detailed indicators). 
  Thematic studies: The PCO will contract out thematic studies that will look at the impact of 
99.
activities under Programme Outcomes. These thematic will, inter alia: (i) measure more regularly the 
positive or negative changes/outcomes taking place at the household level to provide early evidence 
of Programme success or failure; (ii) provide timely performance information so that corrective actions 
may be taken if required; and (iii) assess targeting efficiency. Specifically, such impact assessment 
will include an analysis of the effectiveness of: poverty impact of commodity-specific market support 
activities; Public and Private Partnership in poverty reduction; impact of micro credits on women; 
effectiveness of collective economic models; and the effect of SME development on the availability of 
jobs for the poor. The topics for these thematic studies will be identified in consultation with relevant 
government departments during Programme implementation, taking into account ADS policies, but 
could include, inter alia, the effectiveness of the pluralistic extension model, agriculture institutional 
reform in Local Body organizations, the financial and economic impacts of VC co-financing, the impact 
of increased income and BCC on household nutrition, HHM and women’s empowerment, etc. The 
Monitoring Framework provides the indicators, collection methods and the usage of the processed 
data. 
  Mid-term Review and Completion Review: The Programme will use the HVAP completion 
100.
survey to establish its baseline status. A Mid-term Review will be organised in the beginning of PY3 of 
the Programme jointly between IFAD and the Government. A Completion Review will be organised 
towards the end of PY6. The Review will cover, among other things: (i) physical and financial progress 
as measured against the Programme’s AWPBs; (ii) performance and financial management of 
contracted implementing partners; (iii) an assessment of the efficacy of technical assistance (iv) the 
relevance of the Programme components to livelihoods in the Programme area and as a means of 
attaining Programme objectives (v) the efficacy and efficiency of implementing arrangements (vi) 
expected impact of the Programme on livelihoods, social aspects, gender, nutrition and environment 
28 
Nepal 
Agriculture Sector Development Programme 
Final programme design report 
(vi) the sustainability and risks associated with the Programme and (vii) recommendations to improve 
expected outcomes and impact (viii) propose changes in the components and activities to reflect the 
findings of the assessment of performance and impact. In addition, it is expected that the Review will 
look at the experience gained from Programme support on the policies and regulatory frameworks for 
its implementation. The Programme completion process will include stakeholder workshop(s) to give 
Programme stakeholders the opportunity to: (i) evaluate the performance of the Programme; (ii) to 
promote accountability; and (iii) to identify factors and responsibilities to increase the likelihood of 
sustainability, together with key success factors and shortcomings. 
  Progress Reporting: The PC  will be responsible for the preparation of quadrimester and 
101.
annual progress reports for submission to the PSC and IFAD within a month from the end of the 
reporting period. The implementing agencies will be required to provide their progress reports as an 
input for PCOs to prepare a report that will be submitted to IFAD and Government in a timely and 
accurate manner. These reports will include the narrative report as a harmonised source of key data 
and ensure the trends are highlighted. The reports will record the financial and physical progress 
against RB-AWPB targets. The Knowledge Management Specialist will prepare a report on KM survey 
and analytical work, with a tabular appendix showing the progress against the Programme indicators. 
Programme implementing agencies will - within 2 weeks from the end of the reporting period - submit 
quadrimester progress reports to the PCO as a condition for release of funds for the ensuing period. 
102.
  Annual Results and Impact Reporting: The PCO will report separately to IFAD on the 
Programme indicators that overlap with IFAD's COSOP. The information contained in these Annual 
Results and Impact Reports will be drawn from the Programme MIS, and set in relation to the targets 
contained in this Report and those in the RB-AWPB. 
Learning and knowledge management 
  The Programme’s knowledge management will be an essential element for delivery of 
103.
Programme objectives, especially for learning related to poverty reduction through commodity 
development. The ASDP will focus on studying and researching the outcomes and impacts of the 
Programme investments. Knowledge, Attitude and Practice (KAP) studies will form part of the KM 
strategy to assess all capacity building and knowledge product use. This new strategy considers KM 
to permeate staff’s tasks at every level, constituting a different approach to the tasks to be carried out 
by all, rather than a specific set of assignments that will be the sole responsibility of a person 
dedicated to carrying the strategy out. This philosophy implies the need for buy-in from all staff, and 
requires them all to be provided with the tools and capacity that will enable them to contribute to the 
strategy’s implementation as a whole. Geo-tagging of all programme interventions will be a 
requirement, including for all field visits by PCO staff and contractors.  
  The ASDP knowledge management activities will focus around five areas relevant to IFAD’s 
104.
investment portfolio in Nepal including: (i) private sector investment in hill-area value chains; (ii) poor 
households’ responses to agriculture business opportunities; (iii) the establishment and sustainability 
of pluralistic extension services; (iv) sustainable rural financial services; and Programme impacts on 
women’s empowerment and household nutrition. In order to develop and manage the knowledge and 
information of the Programme, the following learning activities will be conducted: 
(a)
A consolidated Annual Programme Review will be carried out in the beginning of each  
fiscal year to review the implementation performance of ASDP during the previous year, in 
addition to the annual reviews. It shall assess performance in the achievement of physical 
and financial progress against annual targets. A review of progress towards development 
objectives as reflected in the Outcome Surveys will also be done, assessing success and 
failures and reasons thereof and lessons learned. In order to get feedback from 
beneficiaries on the Programme’s relevance, effectiveness and quality of interventions and 
their impact, the Annual Review Workshops could be conducted at the State level beginning 
from the end of the 1st year of Programme implementation. The Annual Review Workshops 
29 
Nepal 
Agriculture Sector Development Programme 
Final programme design report 
should also go beyond merely being an assessment of Programme performance and 
become truly information sharing and learning events.  
(b)
  Annual knowledge pieces. The PCO will produce at least two knowledge pieces per year 
(e.g. research paper, audio-visual, or verbal presentation) on some aspect of one of the 
aforementioned themes that relates directly to its work. The pieces will be derived from 
Programme implementation experiences related to the KM themes and will be evidence-
based. The precise topic of the pieces will, within the aforementioned framework, be 
determined by the PCOs and will depend on the nature and stage of the Programme. The 
method or format for documenting the knowledge and the means of communicating it will 
also be determined by the Programme as a function of the knowledge it wishes to share and 
the audience that it will like to benefit from that knowledge. 
(c)
  Documenting lessons learnt, best practices and cases of success: The M&E and KM 
Specialists will collect all available relevant information to document lessons learnt, best 
practices and cases of success. It could be based on information collected from: progress 
reports, meetings and interviews, monitoring and evaluation reports, outputs evidence 
provided by targeted groups, market and value chain entities and other involved parties.  
(d)
Learning Conferences: It is recommended that Conferences/ Seminars/ Workshops at the 
State and Federal Level be organised at mid-term and end-Programme term respectively, at 
which the learnings, experiences and impacts of the Programme as also of other similar 
governmental and donor supported Programmes can be shared. This will facilitate 
acquisition and dissemination of knowledge as well as institutionalisation of participation-
promoting processes and procedures. 
(e)
  Developing and delivering a lesson’s learnt study: Based on the information collected 
along Programme implementation, the M&E and KM Specialist will develop an end of 
Programme Lessons Learnt Report, analysing the documented lessons learnt, best 
practices and cases. It will be first submitted to IFAD and, once feedback has been 
incorporated, if any, the report will be shared widely.  
(f)
Development of material for dissemination: The M&E and KM Specialist will produce 
communication materials summarizing some of the success stories to be distributed through 
networks and policy dialogue. Based on analysis of the documented information, and the 
reports, material for dissemination will be produced at the end of the Programme; a mid-
term Lessons Learnt Report might be developed. A short film about the Programme 
combining before and after footage will be shared with target groups, policy makers and 
other stakeholders. Recommendations and actions for market and value chain development 
will be developed. 
C.
  Financial management, procurement and governance 
  Financial Management. The PCO will be responsible and accountable to GoN and IFAD for 
105.
the proper use of funds apportioned to them, in line with the respective legal agreements, any 
subsidiary financing agreements and contractual arrangements for service providers. It will provide 
detailed financial statements of the operations, resources and expenditures related to the Programme 
for each fiscal year prepared in accordance with standards and procedures acceptable to IFAD and 
deliver such financial statements to IFAD within four months of the end of each fiscal year. 
106.
  Overall, ASDP will be operating in a relatively high inherent risk environment due to the 
persistence of some weaknesses in the public sector financial management systems as outlined in 
the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA)analysis. The proposed financial 
management arrangements for the programme incorporate measures intended to reduce such risks to 
acceptable levels and ensure that: (i) the programme funds are used for intended purposes only in an 
efficient and effective way; (ii) reliable and timely financial reports are prepared; and (iii) programme 
30

assets and resources are safeguarded from unauthorized or wasteful use. Financial risk mitigation 
measures are detailed in Appendix 7, Table 1.  
  ASDP financial management procedures and record maintenance at all level will be properly 
107.
documented in the PIM and consistently applied. The PIM shall include specific provisions regulating 
the setting up of internal controls, effective monitoring and review of transactions, accounting software 
requirements and include all other FM practices with guidance notes. A system of joint signatory for 
approving Treasury Single Account (TSA) disbursements, WA submissions, DA transactions will have 
to be in place. Detailed procedures for adequate recording, management and safeguard of 
programme fixed assets will be disclosed in the PIM.  
  Government financial management system. There are three elements to the GoN budget 
108.
management system: (i) the Budget Management Information System (BMIS), run by the MoF for 
consolidating budget requests; (ii) the Financial Management Information System (FMIS) which 
incorporates the TSA system and is run by the Financial Comptroller General Office (FCGO), under 
the MoF; and (iii) the Aid Management Platform (AMP), hosted by the International Economic 
Coordination Cooperation Division (IECCD) of the MoF, an on-line platform that provides public 
access to information on all donor-funded development Programmes in Nepal. At ministerial and 
Programme-level, there is extensive use of TSA, while the accounting and reporting functions are run 
autonomously by all entities using proprietary software and applying government accounting rules. 
  The ASDP budget preparation process is described under planning (paras.  81 to  87). Upon 
109.
approval of the budget published in the Red Book and budget allocation to the PCO cost centre, the 
ASDP approved budget will be inserted into the FMIS by FCGO. Budget allocation will be available 
real time at the district branch of FCGO, the District Treasury Controller Office (DTCO) for ASDP use. 
The Red Book would specify the budget codes and funding source. The ASDP should adhere to the 
GoN budgeting/accounting rules as well as the percentage of financing of activities from the various 
financiers. 
  The Office of the Auditor General (OAG) conducts financial audits in the public sector (including 
110.
IFAD funded Programmes) using international Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions (ISSAI) issued 
by the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI), usually within 8 months 
after financial year end. Audit reports are submitted to the parliament, through the President's Office, 
within 9 months after the end of the period covered. The annual audit will be performed in accordance 
with ISSAI. The statutory ToRs of OAG may be integrated with specific requests from IFAD. The 
auditors will issue separate opinions covering the financial statements, statements of expenditures 
and the management of designated accounts. The audited financial statements and audit reports will 
be submitted to IFAD within six months after the end of each fiscal year and after the Programme 
closing date. In addition, the auditors will also issue management letters outlining any internal control 
weaknesses.  
  Flow of funds arrangement. IFAD will make funds available to the GoN under the terms and 
111.
conditions of the Financing Agreement. Programme funds will flow from IFAD via two Designated 
Accounts (DAs), maintained separately for loan and grant proceeds, held by the ASDP as authorized 
by MoF and established in the Nepal Rastra Bank. Government funds will flow using TSA. 
  Designated Account (DA). In accordance with the Financing Agreement and Section 4.04(d) of 
112.
the General Conditions, immediately after entry into force of the Financing Agreement, the GoN shall 
open and thereafter maintain in the Nepal Rastra Bank, two accounts denominated in US dollars for 
the purpose of financing the Programme, the “Designated Account”. The DA will be held by ASDP as 
authorized by the MoF, and will be protected against set-off, seizure or attachment on terms and 
conditions proposed by the Borrower and accepted by IFAD.  
Initial Deposit into the Designated Accounts (Authorized Allocation): Upon the entry into force of 
113.
the IFAD loan and the Borrower’s request, IFAD will make a withdrawal of USD 2.5 million in the 
aggregate from the Loan Account and USD 0.5 million in the aggregate from the grant account on 
behalf of the Borrower and deposit such amounts into the DAs to carry out the Programme activities.

  Counterpart government contributions payments will be made from the Federal budget by 
114.
arrangement of the MoF, and be used specifically for the Nepalese contributions to the Programme on 
a pre-financed basis.  
  Withdrawal Applications (WAs) WAs) would be made on a quadrimeter basis requesting the 
115.
replenishment of the DA. Such WAs shall be prepared in accordance with IFAD requirements with 
Statement of Expense (SOE) thresholds fixed at USD 50 000 for all cost categories. All expenditures 
above the established thresholds shall be accompanied by related supporting documentation, as well 
as all expenditures of every amount related to contracts of value exceeding USD 100 000. The PCO 
shall prepare and submit the WA to IFAD on a timely basis and within 30 days after the end of each 
quadrimester starting from the first quadrimester after the first disbursement is made or anytime when 
the DA falls below USD 1 million. 
  Accounting systems, policies, procedures and financial reporting. Accounting would be 
116.
done using the national chart of accounts, based on cash basis of accounting, and using the 
accounting software developed by ISFP, ASHA and RERP to meet accounting and reporting 
requirement of GoN and IFAD. This software, developed by local software developer and being tested 
for the ISFP, ASHA and RERP and suitable for other IFAD funded projects, will, allow the 
categorization of expenditures by categories, components, financier and by percentage of financing. 
In addition, it will automatically prepare WAs, monitor expenditures against approved budget and 
annual work programmes, generate trimester financial reports and annual financial statements in a 
format acceptable to IFAD. 
Internal Auditing would be performed in accordance with GoN rules and procedures. The 
117.
District Treasury Comptroller Office (DTCO) would perform internal audit to ASDP on trimester or 
semi-annual basis. The DTCO’s mandate requires the internal audit team to check the background 
documentation related to vouchers to ensure compliance with budget allocation, annual work 
programme and prevailing Laws, effectiveness of internal control system, use of the financial 
resources in economical, efficient and effective manner, check actions taken to settle the previous 
internal audit observations and subsequent payment orders presented to DTCO office for issuance of 
checks. At the end of the mission an internal audit report containing audit observations and relevant 
recommendations would be issued. 
In order to have more specific support, ASDP, on an annual basis, will contract a private 
118.
accounting firm to perform internal controls review, propose improvements and issue 
recommendations. Main duties to be stipulated in the TORs will include monitoring and review of the 
financial systems and procedures, their application and adherence to the PIM, support the 
introduction of administrative efficiencies. It will be a good practice to brief OAG audit team on the 
programme components, methods of implementation, monitoring arrangements, etc. so that they 
could deliver the reports effectively. Reports prepared by the accounting firm will be submitted to the 
attention of the Programme Steering Committee and forwarded to IFAD. 
  Considering the GoN procedures, annual financial statements in accordance with GoN criteria 
119.
and format will need to be finalized within 35 days after the closure of the financial year (by August 
20th). DTCO will perform its regular internal audit and ensure all observations are duly settled before 
issuing its report and approve annual financial statements (by the end of September of each year). 
OAG team will visit ASDP after the completion of DTCO work to perform the external audit and will 
issue the preliminary audit report by the end of the month of October of each financial year.  
  Between the months of October and November, ASDP finance team will complete the annual 
120.
financial statements to be submitted to IFAD and will request OAG to issue its audit opinion by the 
end of December of each financial year. These arrangements will ensure timely submission of annual 
financial statements audit reports to IFAD. 
  Financial management. As custodians of funds in the Designated Accounts, the PCOs will 
121.
undertake the following financial management tasks:

Ensure that Programme expenditure items and practices are consistent with those of the 
Government and IFAD;  
Ensure that Programme suppliers and locally paid staff are paid promptly and adequately;  
Ensure that Programme expenditure is being coded correctly and consistently and that 
Programme funds are used solely for the purposes for which they were granted and in 
accordance with relevant GON and IFAD guidelines; 
Establish an asset register for all assets purchased by or provided to the Programme in line 
with standard GON and IFAD policies; 
(e)
  Maintain register of contracts and contract payment monitoring form to monitor contract 
(f)
(g)
management of all procurement; 
Check monthly Programme financial report for accuracy and appropriateness, and ensure 
the Accounts Officer is current with events concerning financial reporting issues, errors, 
trends, payment delays and related matters; and, 
  Monitor expenditure monthly against the approved RB-AWPB in order to prepare and send 
timely fund withdrawal applications to IFAD and review expenditure projections to ensure 
that expenditure stays within budget. Significant actual or anticipated expenditure variances 
against the budget should be included in the monthly report to line management together 
with any recommendations for changes to the budget. 
  The Accounts Officer of the PCO will be responsible for the actual management of these tasks, 
122.
and will report to the PC.  
  Governance. MoF regulations currently require international loan funds to flow through the 
123.
relevant investment project. Value chain investments co-financed by the ASDP will be identified 
through a process of rigorous financial and economic evaluation (SIP) led by a MSP convened by the 
elected DCC and will only proceed to investment following the identification and financial commitment 
of key private sector investors (agri-businesses, smallholder producers and technical and financial 
service providers). The ASDP will co-finance supporting public and community market-oriented 
infrastructure and public/private technical services at municipal and ward level in accordance with 
agreed ASDP budget allocations and Local Body contributions. Those investments will be identified by 
participating communities and municipal and ward committes in accordance with identified value chain 
development needs and local level strategies and plans and be financed by the ASDP at the request 
of the Municipal Mayor/Chairperson, following standard municipal approval processes. Municipal-
approved investments would be included in the ASDP RB-AWPB and, following MoF budget approval, 
will be advanced to municipalities and wards for disbursement against agreed outcomes. 
Municipalities will submit their disbursement accounts to the Programme on a quadrimester basis (see 
para.  115), on the basis of which further advances would be made. Municipalities and wards would be 
fully responsible for the management of these funds and achievement of the agreed outcomes. 
Should GoN regulations concerning the disbursement of loan funds change, the Programme would 
revise its disbursement arrangements accordingly Should GoN regulations concerning the 
disbursement of loan funds change, the Programme will revise its disbursement strategies in 
accordance with prevailing GoN regulations, including devolution of conditional funding for activities 
implemented by the municipality, on completion of a fiduciary due diligence of the municipality as a 
cost center.  
  Taxation: The proceeds of the IFAD financing may not be used to pay taxes which will be part 
124.
of the contribution of GoN to the Programme. Considering the current taxation scheme for VAT at 
13 per cent, GoN contribution to all categories of expenditures foreseeing the purchase of goods and 
services will be fixed at least at 15 per cent. Social security benefits (employee’s portion) and income 
tax (employee deductions) are eligible for IFAD financing. 
IFAD Policy on Anti-Corruption and Fraud:  IFADs policy require’s that the staff of IFAD, 
125.
(including beneficiaries of IFAD loans) as well as all bidders, suppliers, contractors and consultants 
under IFAD-financed contracts observe the highest standard of ethics and integrity during the

procurement and execution of such contracts. Mechanisms for whistle-blowers to access IFAD 
systems are provided at the following link: http://www.ifad.org/governance/anticorruption/how.htm. 
D.
  Supervision 
  The Programme will be directly supervised by IFAD, with the participation of MoAD, SDC and 
126.
State and Local Governments, in accordance with the on-going arrangements in Nepal. The IFAD 
Country Office will manage the supervision, government, SDC and IFAD staff and consultants will 
attend the Programme start-up workshops. Government, SDC and IFAD specialist consultants and 
staff will continue to be involved in supervision and implementation support. The initial supervision 
and implementation support mission will take place soon after Programme commencement. Further 
supervision missions will be undertaken annually and complemented by short and focused follow-up 
missions as appropriate. Supervision will be based on IFAD’s operational modalities and practices. As 
far as possible, the identity of personnel engaged in supervision and implementation support will not 
be changed frequently unless there are compelling reasons to do so. The frequency and composition 
of supervision missions will be determined in light of actual requirements and in accordance with 
agreements between IFAD and the Government. 
E.
  Risk identification and mitigation 
127.
  The main identified risks for this Programme are identified in Table 1. 
  At the Programme Goal Level, the risk of external shocks to the macro-economy has the 
128.
greatest prominence. This risk is ever present in a relatively small and politically volatile economy 
such as that of Nepal, particularly with the on-going constitutional change process. This is a significant 
risk for the Programme. At the national level, sound macro-economic policies and the maintenance of 
the Nepalese rupees pegged to the Indian rupee are the main means of mitigation of this risk. The 
main mitigation measures at the Programme and enterprise levels are the emphasis on sound 
financial analysis of sub-projects, with emphasis on quality, high productivity and low cost per unit of 
output value. 
  At the Development Objective Level, key risks are associated with that of the maintenance of 
129.
stable socio-economic conditions in the Programme area, with business regulatory systems and with 
the effective communication of nutrition messages. State 6 is enjoying economic growth leading to 
reduced poverty, with the biggest socio-economic risk associated with climatic disaster. The 
Programme will advance the national agenda for climate change adaptation and will ensure that all 
Programme-financed interventions are climate change adapted. The relatively weak private business 
environments in the States is a significant risk and the newly formed State 6 and its municipalities will 
need to commit to an improved investment environment, Nutrition behavioural change communication 
is now well established in Nepal, supported by the multi-sectoral nutrition strategy and plan, and 
should not be a high-risk activity in State 6. 
  At the Outcome/Output Levels, an important risk is that there is insufficient skilled and efficient 
130.
contractors and service providers to implement the Programme in a cost-effective manner. Rigorous 
screening and investigation of potential contractors prior to engagement, supported by a cost and 
quality-based consultant/NGO selection process can deal with this risk adequately. The experience of 
the IFAD country office and the PCO in this respect remains vital. In some circumstances, particularly 
for the social services support being provided by NGOs, it may prove to be necessary for some 
intensive training and mentoring of service providers. This is accommodated under Sub-component 4.  
  Associated with this risk is that of the lack of procedures and professional experience of 
131.
administrations of the recently established State 6 and associated municipalities and wards. This risk 
is explicitly recognised in the Programme design, and training and mentoring will be provided to build 
institutions and change the skills and mind-sets of the relevant officials.  
  There is a risk that integrated disaster risk management and vulnerability planning are not 
132.
effectively integrated into ward and district-level planning, which will particularly threaten the 
34 
Nepal 
Agriculture Sector Development Programme 
Final programme design report 
sustainability of public infrastructure investments. The mitigating factors for this risk are: 
(i) substantive investment in CC orientation; (ii) careful screening of all investments proposed; and 
(iii) adoption of the closely mentored inclusive approach to participatory planning of development. 
  “Elite Capture” of benefits targeted for poor inhabitants of the Programme area is a risk. 
133.
Although this risk is significant, there are several in-built devices within the Programme design that 
mitigate this. These include: (i) support to the creation of farmer-led governance and service supply 
institutions at municipal and ward level; (ii) the promotion of a user pays service mode; (iii) the 
adoption of the closely mentored inclusive approach to participatory planning of development; (iv) the 
careful screening of all public investments proposed through participatory planning processes, 
including ensuring an effective “voice” for disadvantaged people; and, (v) the rigorous use of 
screening and approval of private investment proposals to ensure that there are strong backward 
linkages to the primary target group. 
  Financial service providers may not be sufficiently interested to invest in Programme-targeted 
134.
value chains. Past performance by leading rural financial service providers has demonstrated this risk. 
It will be alleviated by: (i) the strengthening of cooperative rural financial service providers; 
(ii) increased emphasis on savings; (iii) development of new financial products; (iv) investment 
opportunities in profitable, climate-adapted production systems and value chains; and, (v) GoN 
policies to promote commercial bank investment in rural areas, including agriculture.  
  A detailed description of potentially negative social, environmental and climate risk factors and 
135.
mitigation measures can be found in the SECAP RN. 
IV.  Programme costs, financing, benefits and sustainability 
A.
  Programme costs 
  The main assumptions underlying the derivation of Programme costs and the financing plan 
136.
are: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Programme costs are based on August 2017 prices; 
The proposed Programme will be financed over a six-year period (2018-2024). 
Inflation. Inflation in Nepal has fallen to about 8.5 per cent per annum (p.a.) in 2016 and 
is expected to remain at about 8 per cent p.a. to 2021 Foreign inflation was set at 2 per 
cent p.a. over the Programme period.  
Exchange Rate. The Base Exchange rate for this analysis has been set at NPR 102 to 
USD 1 as an official exchange rate prevailing in August 2017 (rounded). 
The Programme costs are presented in both NPR and USD. Conversions from current 
USD values into Nepalese rupees use constant purchasing power exchange rates: 
Taxes and Duties. There is value added tax (VAT) of 13 per cent levied on all imported 
and locally procured goods and services. Vehicles have a tax of up to 230 per cent 
depending on an engine power. International technical assistance does not carry any 
taxes. Social security benefits (employee’s portion) and income tax (employee 
deductions) are eligible for IFAD financing. 
  The Government will finance the cost of all taxes on goods and services procured under the 
137.
Programme. GoN will also finance some PCO staff (on deputation) and operating costs and, through 
Municipal budgets, contribute to the cost of infrastructure development. 
  The total investment and incremental recurrent Programme costs, including physical and price 
138.
contingencies, as detailed in Table 3 are estimated at about USD 68.1 million (NPR 7.0 billion). 
Physical and price contingencies make up 21 per cent of the total Programme costs. The foreign 
exchange component is estimated at USD 5.7 million or about 8 per cent of the total Programme 
costs. Taxes and duties make up approximately USD 8.3 million (12.1 per cent). Programme 
management costs amount to USD 7.6 million (about 11.2 per cent of the total Programme costs). 
35 
Nepal 
Agriculture Sector Development Programme 
Final programme design report 
Hard investments in equipment, co-financing value chain development and public and community 
infrastructure, constitute 60 per cent of total Programme costs and 58 per cent of the IFAD loan 
amount. International TA for support forms 0.7 per cent of total Programme costs and 1.1 per cent of 
the IFAD loan and grant financing and is fully covered by grant finance. 
Table 3. Programme Costs by Component and Output (USD) 
B.
  Programme financing 
  An IFAD Loan of USD 38.2 million will finance 56.1 per cent of total Programme cost, including: 
139.
48.1 per cent of Sub-component 1: Inclusive and sustainable agriculture value chains expanded and 
diversified, for which the total cost is USD 21.7 million; 67.8 per cent of Sub-component 2: Market-
oriented infrastructure functional, for which the total cost is USD 18.6 million; 75 per cent of Sub-
component 3: Rural financial services for value chain development strengthened, for which the total 
cost is USD 4.6 million; 51 per cent of Sub-component 4: Agriculture services sustainably support 
innovation and value chain development, for which the total cost is USD 16.1 million and 49.2 per cent 
of the Programme Coordination Component, which has a total cost of USD 7.6 million. An IFAD grant 
of USD 1.8 million (2.6 per cent of total cost) will support Programme specialised TA, training and 
studies. SDC will provide a grant of USD 3.0 million  
  Technical Assistance.  In alignment with IFAD Grant Policy and the Government of Nepal’s 
140.
Development Cooperation Policy (2014), given Nepal’s current status as a highly concessional 
borrower, the Grant funds, of USD 1.8 million, have been specifically sought to finance international 
and national technical assistance in the areas where it could would provide for the capacity 
development of the newly established offices in municipalities and wards, and build the sustainability 
of this Programme.  The major activities envisioned under Grant financing include (i) development of 
the Strategic Investment Plans for up to 10 products to ensure their viability for value chain 
development; (ii) Technical Assistance to build the business development services that will be offered 
by ASDP; (iii) Technical assistance to capacitate the devolved DCCs in convening the multi 
stakeholder platforms; (iv) Technical assistance to ensure that the financial service providers have 
sufficient risk appetite and products to promote the move to rural areas and to lending to small holder 
farmers within a value chain; (v) Technical assistance for the implementation of household 
methodologies towards the empowerment of women; and (vi) Technical assistance towards linking in 
with on-going nutritional interventions and building the BCC in the devolved GoN structure. 
  Smallholder beneficiaries will contribute approximately USD 6.7 million (10 per cent of total 
141.
cost) as co-financing of the community infrastructure (at least 15 per cent) and value chain group co-
financing (at least 50 per cent). Private entrepreneurs will contribute USD 3.5 million (5.1 per cent of 
total cost) to finance at least 70 per cent of the value chain processing investments (including not less 
than 35 per cent in cash or credit) to be contributed by the benefitting businesses.  
  The Government contribution of USD 11.5 million (16.9 per cent of total costs) will cover all 
142.
taxes and duties on all Programme inputs that involve funding from the IFAD Loan/Grant 
(USD 8.3 million), and the GoN contribution to municipal public goods and public-private infrastructure

  Summary benefits and economic analysis 
A.  Summary benefits and economic analysis 
143.
  The ASDP would target a minimum of 35,000 households. Assuming a 75% success rate, the 
ASDP would contribute to the reduction of poverty and food insecurity in around 26,250 households in 
the hill and mountain areas of State 6. The projected household and beneficiary entry into the 
Programme are shown below in Table 5.  
  Direct benefits would accrue to the producers’ households as well as agri-industry 
144.
entrepreneurs and employees through the expansion and diversification of inclusive and sustainable 
value chains facilitated by market orientated infrastructure, innovation in rural financial services and 
transformed extension provision. The later would develop participatory and pluralistic services via the 
newly established MAU-CASEC network. The foundation of the benefits quantified in the financial and 
economic analysis is the incremental production at household level realised in the apple, ginger, off-
season vegetable, citrus, turmeric, timur, potato, walnut, goat meat and milk value chains.

  Economic viability. The economic viability of the project is assessed by comparing the 
aggregated incremental benefits and costs. The benefit stream is derived from the value of the 
incremental production from the 26,250 VC household models phased in over the implementation

period. The cost stream is based on the same households’ incremental costs plus the value of the 
ASDP investment and recurrent costs. Both cashflow are projected over a 25-year analysis period 
that includes appropriate recurrent costs beyond the ASDP implementation to justify the sustained 
benefits over that period. The incremental net benefit stream so derived, forms the basis of the 
investment appraisal. 
  Economic indicators. The overall ASDP economic net present value (ENPV) is 
147.
USD 95.61 million at a 10% discount rate65 . The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) is 
24 per cent. The benefit cost ratio (BCR) of 1.6 indicating a return of approximately 1.6 dollars for 
every dollar invested. Both results indicate that the project is a worthwhile investment66.  
  Sensitivity analysis. An increase in Programme costs by 10 per cent will reduce the EIRR to 
148.
21.1 per cent, while a decrease in overall Programme benefits by 20 per cent will result in an EIRR of 
17.2 per cent. A one-year delay in benefits reduces the EIRR to 18.7 per cent and a two-year delay to 
15.3 per cent. The switching values show that the Programme will remain economically viable if 
benefits decreased by 36 per cent, or Programme costs increased by 57 per cent. These returns 
based on the production modelling are further supported by the additional non-quantified benefits 
derived from the establishment and/or improvement to public infrastructure as well as the 
development of financial and agricultural extension services across the broader communities. The 
investment in the project is therefore viable from an economic perspective. 
  Sustainability 
  The emphasis of the Programme is on enhancement of private sector activity and 
D.
149.
competitiveness in the specific sub-sectors targeted for investment. The most important determinant 
of sustainability of such investments and, by extension, provision of expected benefits, is their 
continued profitability. The approach adopted will provide strong grounds for the expectation that a 
large majority of investments will endure. The main tools used by the Programme to enhance 
prospects of private business sustainability will be: 
 
 
 
 
 
Enhanced capacity of government staff, farmers and private rural enterprise actors to 
analyse and prioritize investment choices; 
Rigorous scrutiny of business proposals by ASDP, municipal governments and 
collaborating financial institutions; 
The commitment of a substantial proportion of investment from the beneficiaries own 
financial resources; 
The complementary public investment in infrastructure designed to improve market 
access and, thereby, lower costs, and in private sector financial and technical service 
delivery;  
The focussed approach to investment within the wards and municipalities having a 
comparative production advantage.  
  The likelihood of sustainability of the public investments, although not assured, will be further 
150.
enhanced through the following measures which are built into Programme design: 
 
 
 
The operation of investments will largely be through existing institutions; 
The requirement for a relatively significant contribution from the sponsoring agency or 
community groups; and, 
The assurance local ownership and participatory planning through the devolution of 
responsibilities and budgets under the new Constitution of Nepal.

will focus on value chain development as well as diversification of livelihoods with specific attention in 
promoting adaptive cropping and integrated forage production systems. Improved smallholder access 
to market combined with extension services has proven potential to increase and extreme poor 
income. Adaptation measures are to be mainstreaming at institutional and community levels to 
enhance the climate change adaptation potential of the poor households. With this strategy in place, 
the climate risk category of the Programme is assessed as moderate classification.

are less adverse than those for Category A; (ii) are site-specific and few are-irreversible in nature; and (iii) can be readily remedied by 
appropriate preventive actions and/or mitigation measures. While no formal Environment and Social Impact Assessment is required for 
Category B programmes/projects, in many cases further environmental analysis could be undertaken during project preparation or 
implementation. Category B operations usually require an Environment and Social Management Plan, which may be a stand-alone 
document or an output from an environmental analysis.

be moderately sensitive to climate risks and thus requires a basic integration of climate issues to be undertaken during the project 
design phase. This process should result in practical adjustments under the project to reduce losses and damages from climate hazards 
to IFAD's client group, and capitalize on opportunities to strengthen local risk management capacities.

Appendix 1:  Country and rural context background 
Appendix 1:  Country and rural context background 
Development progress at glance.  Nepal had a population of 28.9 million people in 2016, of 
1.
which 81 per cent live in rural areas. The country’s per capita GDP was the second lowest in South 
Asia, recorded as USD 723 in 201669. Nepal has made progress in some key indicators of socio-
economic development after its peace agreement, signed in November 2006.  Although Nepal has 
recorded improvement in its Human Development Index (HDI) in recent decades, it has the lowest 
ranking among the countries of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), aside 
from Pakistan and Afghanistan (2014). Nepal made significant progress in achieving its MDGs (2000 
to 2015). Poverty reduced from 42 per cent to 24.5 per cent and the majority of health-related MDGs 
were achieved, while targets related to hunger, universal primary education, gender equality and 
women’s empowerment were largely met. The latest Nepal Living Standard Survey (NLSS) reported 
improvements in households accessing a number of services and resources, while the overall state of 
economic growth, having fallen sharply after the 2015 earthquake, is now heading toward strong 
recovery, with agriculture remaining as the main driver of economic development.  
2.
Economic Development. Economic growth began to slow in Fiscal Year (FY) 2013/2014, 
principally due to depressed agricultural production and low investment and then fell sharply to 0.6 per 
cent in 2015/16 due to the earthquake disaster and an economic blockade. It is now projected to pick 
up substantially to 4.6 per cent in 2016/17 and then to 4.8 per cent in 2017/18, due to both stronger 
agricultural sector performance and the ongoing reconstruction effort, which will also generate higher 
levels of investment and support domestic consumption70. Agriculture accounts for almost 1/3rd of 
GDP. Agricultural sector growth in FY2012 reached 4.6 per cent, but sector performance then fell to 
1.1 per cent in FY 2013 due to a combination of weak monsoons, inadequate supply of agricultural 
inputs during the peak planting seasons, rose slightly to 2.9 per cent in 2014 in response to better 
monsoon rains, and back to 1.9 per cent in 2015due to the earthquake disruption. Agriculture is 
expected to grow in 2017 on the back of average monsoon rainfall. Growth in the industrial sector 
(which accounts for about 13 per cent of GDP) has historically been held back by a lack of adequate 
electricity and other supply-side bottlenecks. The 2015 earthquake further slowed industrial activities, 
with the severely affected districts accounting for about 20 per cent of total manufacturing 
establishments, manufacturing jobs, and manufacturing value-added in the country. Similarly, nearly a 
quarter of the total hydropower produced in the country is affected by the earthquake. Industrial 
growth in 2016 was projected to be -6.3 per cent. There has, however, been significant growth in the 
services sector in recent years, strengthened by the continuing growth in remittance transfers. It is 
projected that services output will grow by an average annual rate of 5.6 per cent in 2016/17 and 
2017/18 as the sector recovers from the adverse effects of the 2015 earthquakes.  
3.
Strong consumption growth rather than investment is driving economic activities, with both 
public and private investment weak in 2016, with private sector investment particularly constrained by 
the high level of policy uncertainty. Private sector investment is expected to improve in 2017 and 
several large infrastructure Programmes are likely to accelerate economic growth in coming years71. 
Despite the timely approval of the budget, key capital Programmes have not moved as anticipated, 
demonstrating shortcomings in preparation and implementation that affect the broader capital 
Programme portfolio of the government. Owing to high spending pressures, the budget will remain in 
deficit in fiscal years 2016/17 and 2017/18 (July 16th-July 15th). However, improving revenue 
collection will keep the budget shortfall at a manageable level. Consumer prices will rise by an 
average of 8.4 per cent a year in 2017-18, as food price pressures will remain high. Supply 
disruptions, owing to the country's poor road infrastructure and the impact of the 2015 earthquakes, 
69 GDP per capita purchasing power parity (PPP) was USD 2,500 in 2015

will continue to put upward pressure on prices. Import price inflation will also be strong in the forecast 
period. 
The World Bank has advised government that, for growth to accelerate, government will have 
4.
to reduce constraints to public and private investment. Their key recommendations include: 
(i) addressing systemic weaknesses in the budget preparation and execution processes, including a 
closer alignment between policy priorities and budgetary allocations; (ii) amplifying good governance 
initiatives, including more independent audits and strengthened parliamentary processes; 
(ii) developing strategic infrastructure, particularly in the transport sector; and (iv) initiating reform in 
the power sector. 
Agriculture development. Agriculture in Nepal is dominated by small and marginal farmers, 
5.
with 95 percent of land holdings nationally below 2 ha, accounting for 77 percent of cultivated land72. 
The average size of land holdings in Nepal is 0.66 ha, with about 55 percent of land holdings smaller 
than 0.5 ha, 26 percent between 0.5 ha to 1 ha, and about 14 percent 1 ha to 2 ha. Due to limited 
cultivable land, the proportion of marginal and small holdings (below 1 ha) is significantly higher in the 
hilly and mountainous regions compared to the terai73. As five of the 10 districts in State 6 (Surkhet, 
Salyan, Dailekh, Jajarkot and Rukum) are hilly and the other five are mountainous, a vast majority of 
farmers in the State are likely to be small and marginal farmers. 
6.
Nationally, agriculture suffers from low investment, and inadequate commercialization and 
modernization. Two-thirds of people in the labour force are engaged in agriculture production, but the 
majority are unskilled and lack knowledge on updated cultivation practices. The sector largely 
depends on the monsoon, while access to modern inputs and extension service is limited and 
relatively poor in quality. Underemployment is a serious problem with many young people leaving 
farming for foreign employment. Nepal, as a result, has become a net food importer. 
An Agricultural Development Strategy (ADS), supported by a broad donor coalition, which aims 
7.
to guide the agricultural sector of Nepal over the next 20 years, was approved in 2015. The ADS 
envisages a profound shift in the Nepalese economy, from one primarily based on agriculture to an 
economy that derives most of its income from services and industry. The strategy envisages “A self-
reliant, sustainable, competitive, and inclusive agricultural sector that drives economic growth and 
contributes to improved livelihoods and food and nutrition security.” This will be achieved through 
substantial growth in the sector and agro-based exports, underpinned by four strategic pillars of 
agriculture development: governance, productivity, commercialization and competitiveness, while 
promoting: (i) inclusiveness (both social and geographic); (ii) sustainability (both natural resources 
and economic); (iii) development of the private and cooperative sectors, and connectivity to market 
infrastructure (e.g. agricultural roads, collection centres, packing houses, market centres); (iv) 
information infrastructure and ICT; and (v) power infrastructure (e.g. rural electrification, renewable 
and alternative energy sources). Over a 20-year period it envisages agricultural growth rising from the 
current 3 per cent, to 6 per cent per annum, driven by a 400 per cent expansion in irrigated area, a 
400 per cent improvement in soil organic matter and associated 50 per cent reduction in degraded 
land, a 250 per cent expansion in agricultural land productivity and a significant increase in women’s 
ownership of land (from 10 per cent to 50 per cent). This growth is expected to lead, over 20 years, to: 
a 5 per cent surplus in food grain self-sufficiency from a 5 per cent deficit; an 800 per cent increase in 
agricultural exports; the more than doubling of returns to agriculture labour; and a reduction of rural 
poverty from 35 per cent to 10 per cent. 
Climate risk. The climate of Nepal varies significantly from one region to the next because of 
8.
the wide variation in altitude. The variable geo-climatic conditions, unplanned settlements, 
degradation of natural resources and growing population pressure make the country increasingly 
vulnerable to extreme climate events and climate change (CC). Climate model projections indicate 
72  National  Sample  Census  of  Agriculture  2011/12,  Central  Bureau  of  Statistics  (CBS),  GoN.  Fragmentation  due  to  rising  population  in  the 
intervening period is likely to have resulted in a larger proportion of smaller holdings. 
73 Based on http://lib.icimod.org/record/23185/files/c_attachment_213_3038.pdf. Data reported in this publication pertains to CBS 1994 though the 
cross-regional distribution is unlikely to have changed given the limited availability of cultivable land in the hills and mountains. About 83 per cent 
of the holdings in the Mountains and 77 per cent in the Hills were reported to be smaller than 1 ha, compared to 59 per cent in the Terai.

Appendix 1:  Country and rural context background 
that the average annual temperature in Nepal will rise and will vary both spatially and temporally. The 
annual mean temperature is expected to increase by an average of 1.2° C by 2030, 1.7° C by 2050 
and 3° C by 2100 compared with the pre-2000 baseline. Several studies show higher temperature 
increment projections for winter than for the monsoon season. There is also evidence of more 
frequent intense rainfall events, more flood days, more variable river flows, erosion and landslides. 
Warmer winters, particularly at higher altitudes, may mean that less precipitation falls as snow, further 
accelerating glacial retreat but also reducing soil moisture and accelerating erosion and, therefore, 
having an impact on winter crops. Warming also leads to early blossom of fruits trees and higher 
parasites/pests attacks, but increases the altitude at which vegetables can be grown. Greater 
unreliability of dry season flows poses a potentially serious threat to water supplies in the lean 
season. These projected changes are consistent with a range of climate models and are predicted to 
continue.  
Poor and marginalized people are especially vulnerable to climate variability and change. They 
9.
generally are the least able to cope with disaster, live in the most at-risk areas and have limited 
information, knowledge and resources to help reduce their level of risk. The predicted impacts of 
climate change (CC) will intensify existing vulnerabilities, inequalities and exposure to hazards. In the 
agriculture sector, smallholder producers face the greatest risk. They tend to own few livelihood 
assets such as land and livestock, receive a low income, and have a low level of education and 
limited access to community and government services. They are also likely to be dependent on rain-
fed agriculture and occupy land that is prone to floods, drought and landslides. Many of Nepal’s poor 
farmers occupy small parcels of land that barely produce enough food for the family. They rely more 
on local natural resources such as forests and water and will therefore suffer the most from the drying 
up of local water sources and changes in vegetation cover. 
  The Government prepared its National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA) in 2010, which 
10.
led to the formulation of the Local Adaptation Plan of Action (LAPA) framework in 2011. The Nepal 
NAPA describes 9 priority activities, including: (i) promoting community-based adaptation through 
integrated management of agriculture, water, forest and biodiversity; (ii) building and enhancing 
adaptive capacity of vulnerable communities; (iii) community-based disaster management for 
facilitating climate adaptation; (iv) Glacial Lake Outburst Flood monitoring and disaster risk reduction; 
(v) forest and ecosystem management in supporting climate-led adaptation innovations; (vi) Adapting 
to climate challenges in public health; (vii) ecosystem management for climate adaptation; 
(viii) empowering vulnerable communities through sustainable management of water resource and 
clean energy supply; and (ix) promoting climate-smart urban settlements.  The preliminary estimate 
for NAPA implementation is about USD 350 million. 
  Nepal has prepared a national framework for development of Local Adaptation Plans for Action 
11.
(LAPAs), which supports the operationalization of the NAPA priorities by facilitating the integration of 
CC resilience into development planning processes and outcomes from local-to-national levels. The 
LAPA’s purpose is to: (i) enable communities to understand the changing and uncertain future climatic 
conditions and effectively engage them in the process of developing adaptation priorities; 
(ii) implement climate-resilient plans that are flexible enough to respond to changing and uncertain 
climatic conditions (no regrets approach); and (iii) inform sectoral programmes, and catalyse 
integrated approaches between various sectors and sub-sectors. The LAPA ensures that the process 
of integrating CC resilience into national planning is bottom-up, inclusive, responsive and flexible. 
Diverse entry points including agriculture, forestry, public health, water and sanitation, watersheds and 
micro-finance are used to assess the ways climate resilience can be strengthened. 
  Poverty in Nepal is primarily a rural problem, and it is strongly associated with gender, 
12.
ethnicity, caste and region. It is highest in the mid-western and far-western development regions, 
though there are pockets of poverty nationwide. The Human Poverty Index (HPI) value for Nepal in 
2011 is 31.12. Nationally, the HPI fell by 8.5 points between 2001 and 2011, or 21.4 per cent.  There 
are variations by rural and urban residence, and by ecological and development regions. Urban-rural 
differences are considerable, with rural poverty nearly 1.8 times higher than urban poverty. Among 
43 
Nepal 
Agriculture Sector Development Programme 
Final programme design report 
Appendix 1:  Country and rural context background 
ecological regions, the HPI is lowest in the Hills at 29.20 and highest in the Mountains at 38.51. 
Among the development regions, the value is lower than the national average only in the Western 
region at 27.20 and the Eastern region at 29.22. The Mid Western region has the highest rank at 
36.63, which is 1.3 times higher than that of the Western region (State 6). High levels of human 
poverty in the Mid-Western and Far Western regions reflect deprivations in health, education and 
sanitation. Dailekh, Kalikot, Jajarkot and Salyan, in the Mid-West are amongst the poorest districts. 
13.
  The Human Development Index (HDI) score for Nepal in 2011 was 0.458, the lowest ranking 
among the countries of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), aside from 
Afghanistan. Despite Nepal ranking second in terms of life expectancy at birth and improvements in 
education indicators, the country’s HDI score is depressed by the low level of per capita income. HDI 
calculations among the ecological regions show the Hills as having the highest HDI value at 0.520, 
compared to the Terai at 0.468 and the Mountains at 0.440. Within the development regions, the 
Central region, at 0.510, ranks at the top, followed by the Western, Eastern, Mid-Western and Far-
Western regions. The Far-Western region at 0.435 and the Mid-Western region (State 6) at 0.447 
have the lowest HDI values, reflecting very low scores in all three dimensions of life expectancy, 
education and income. Within the mid-west (State 6), Kalikot, Jajarkot and Rolpa districts have HDI 
scores below 0.4, while Dailekh, Rukum and Salyan have scores below 0.449. The 2011 urban-rural 
gap in HDI, at 19.7 per cent, is large, reflecting persistent discrepancies in income and education 
between urban and rural areas. 
14.
Inequalities in human development by gender, caste and ethnicity have been noted since the 
first Nepal Human Development Report in 1998. These remain pronounced, despite some evidence 
that they may be reducing over time. Among the four major caste and ethnic clusters — the 
Brahmans/Chhetris, the Janajatis, the Dalits and the Muslims — the Brahmans/ Chhetris rank at the 
top with an HDI value of 0.538, followed by the Janajatis (excluding the Newars) at 0.482, the Dalits at 
0.434 and the Muslims at 0.422.  
  Nutrition security remains a key concern in Nepal, with 38 per cent of children under 5 years old 
15.
stunted and 11 per cent wasted. Malnutrition rates vary geographically. There are more stunted 
children in rural areas than in urban ones. All rates are highest in State 6), with 50 per cent stunting, 
37 per cent underweight and 11 per cent wasted. The target on the first Millennium Development Goal 
(MDG) on hunger (goal 1, target 1C) is further out of reach in Nepal than the targets for any other 
MDGs74. Nepal’s SDG 1 (No poverty) targets for 2030 are “to reduce extreme poverty to less than five 
percent, reduce poverty gap to 2.8 per cent, raise per capita income to USD 2,500, and raise social 
protection budget to 15 per cent of total budget. 
  Despite this scenario, Nepal has made significant progress in achieving its MDGs. The majority 
16.
of health-related MDGs have already been achieved, or are on track to being achieved, except two 
indicators in MDG 5, the contraceptive prevalence rate and the unmet need for family planning, and 
one in MDG 6, the proportion of the population with advanced HIV receiving antiretroviral combination 
therapy (ART). The targets related to poverty and hunger, universal primary education, gender 
equality and women’s empowerment, are also likely to be achieved by 2015, and though the targets 
concerning environmental sustainability and global partnership are unlikely to be achieved in totality, 
lessons to facilitate their achievement have been learnt. 
74 As Nepal’s SDG Baseline report was only finalised in June 2017, reference is made here to the historic MDGs.

  The Present Status of Agricultural Extension in Nepal. Agriculture extension services in 
18.
Nepal are dominated by the public sector under the Government of Nepal (GoN). There is, however, 
also widespread, though not well documented and researched, presence of the private sector, 
especially as input suppliers and sporadically as freelance specialised technical service providers in 
local communities. NGOs are active in isolated pockets, usually as partners in donor-aided 
Programmes. While the public sector is present more or less uniformly, even if thinly, across the 
country, the presence and strength of private sector service providers tends to vary, depending on the 
level of agriculture development, commercialisation of agriculture and demand for inputs from 
farmers. 
  Public Sector. Agriculture and livestock extension in Nepal is led by the activities of the 
19.
Department of Agriculture (DoA) in the Ministry of Agricultural Development (MoAD) and the 
Department of Livestock Service (DoLS) in the Ministry of Livestock Development (MoLD), 
respectively. Extension services in the districts are led by the District Agriculture Development  Office 
(DADO) and the District Livestock Services Office (DLSO) responsible for agriculture extension and 
livestock service delivery, respectively, in each of the 75 districts in the country. The district staff 
represent various technical areas including horticulture, agronomy, plant protection, agricultural

economics, fisheries, veterinary services, livestock management and agricultural extension. The 
extension function, however, is not necessarily headed by an extension specialist. The required entry 
level qualification for district officers is a graduate in agriculture related sciences (veterinary service or 
livestock management in case of DLSO) or by promotion from Junior Technician (JT) level. Often, as 
in Surkhet district, a majority of the agriculture staff in the district are promoted from the rank of JT 
without a university degree. There is no agro-ecological specialisation by way of training or sustained 
experience. 
  Services in the field are provided through a network of Agricultural Service Centres (ASC) and 
20.
Livestock Service Centres/Sub-Centres (LSC), for agriculture and livestock services, respectively. 
There are 378 ASCs and 999 LSCs (including sub-centres) in the country serving 3 754 Village 
Development Committees (VDCs) and 99 municipalities. The extension network does not reach all the 
VDCs in the country. Presently the number of service centres is four per district in the Terai and 
Highland districts and six per district in the mid-Hills with a service centre serving on an average 
10 VDCs (range 4 to 11) regardless of the population of farmers, level of commercialization, area 
cultivated, extent of irrigation, terrain, the types of crops grown, existence of rural/agricultural 
infrastructure, etc. The service centres principally serve as outreach offices of the district to dispense 
pre-determined programmes, inputs and services. While farmers can and do visit the service centres 
to seek advice, procure inputs available under various government programmes and obtain 
recommendations to the District for available grants/ subsidies, the extension workers do not have to 
visit farmers according to any prescribed schedule. They typically visit villages to collect data and form 
new groups to dispense inputs or subsidies under various programmes. 
  Each service centre should have one JT and up to two JTA, though many centres do not have 
21.
the full complement of staff due to shortage of personnel in the respective departments, with many 
positions vacant. Both the JT and JTA have 36 and 18 months’ training after high school respectively 
in the related discipline (agriculture or livestock) from accredited technical training institutions or 
agricultural colleges, followed by three months’ probation or internship in the field. The training 
provides a broad-brush, generalist’s understanding of the agriculture/livestock field, with very limited 
technical depth; it also does not equip the trainees with social mobilisation, group and business 
development, profitability analysis and business development skills. A JTA normally gets promoted as 
a JT after about four years’ service. As government servants, they can be transferred anywhere in the 
country and there is no specialisation in spite of Nepal’s vast agro-ecological and socio-economic 
diversity. The agriculture and livestock service centres are often located at different places. As 
subordinate, frontline civil servants, the service centre staff are loaded with activities such as 
collection of agricultural statistics, transportation and distribution of agricultural inputs such as seeds 
and fertilizers, form and register groups, maintain records for their area, receive requests from farmers 
for inputs and subsidies and verify the bona fide of beneficiaries. Much of their time is thus taken by 
administrative tasks. Each centre has only one motor cycle for transport between three technical staff, 
no teaching aids, extension materials or ITC support. Each JT/JTA gets a field allowance of NPR 
2,000 monthly which is in the nature of a hardship allowance for being placed in a non-urban locale 
and is not linked to travel to villages; there is no allowance for travel. Overall orientation of extension 
remains introduction of improved technologies (principally seeds) to increase productivity and there is 
little or no focus on integrated pest management, profitability, sustainability, business development, 
post-harvest processes, storage, etc. 
  Nepal follows a group based approach to extension. Farmers have to form themselves into 
22.
groups in order to receive any government support by way of extension, inputs or grants, register 
themselves with the concerned department and renew their registration every two years. Farmers 
may form themselves into a group to avail benefits and request the concerned service centre for 
registration or the extension staff may promote groups in order to distribute inputs and grants. The 
number of groups in each district ranges from 100 to 400 with 22,358 agriculture and 14,360 livestock 
farmer groups reported in 2010. The group approach is cost effective and may facilitate farmer to 
farmer learning, however, unless groups have been nurtured sensitively, the group approach may also

lead to elite capture as the poorer, risk averse and socially disadvantaged sections may not come 
forward. 
  Following the decentralization policy of the GoN and passage of the Local Self Governance Act 
23.
(LSGA) in 1999, agricultural extension was to be devolved to elected local government institutions 
with the ASCs and LSCs to be situated at the Ilaka76 level. That will have made the extension network 
denser with almost two and a half times as many ASCs and LSCs as at present to serve all the 
927 Ilakas. Further, extension priorities were to be set through farmer participation at the VDC and 
Municipality level by setting up the AFEC with representation of farmers and farmer groups. This could 
not be achieved as local elections to the District Development Committees, Municipalities and VDCs 
were not held after 1998 due to insurgency and these became committees of civil servants at 
corresponding levels. In the event, decentralisation stopped at the district level, the departments 
retained control over extension and there is no mechanism presently for farmers to set extension or 
overall sectoral programming priorities. 
  To summarise and as the Agriculture Development Strategy (ADS) 2014 points out, the limited 
24.
number of service centres and poorly trained frontline extension staff in the extension network 
hampers farmer access to extension services. Due to its top-down, delivery and disbursement 
oriented structure farmers have no role in setting extension priorities. The one-size-fits-all approach to 
extension delivery through service centres staffed by transferable, generalist extension personnel also 
ignores the extraordinary agro-ecological and socio-economic diversity of Nepal. 
  Private Sector. Private service providers play an important and steadily growing role in 
25.
provision of services to farmers. Examples include the operation of small-scale poultry hatcheries; fruit 
and vegetable nurseries, animal feed and veterinary services, supply of modern farm inputs (seeds, 
saplings, fertilizers and pesticides) by Agro-Vets; technical guidance by Agro-Vets, traders and 
aggregators; livestock services by freelance JTAs and Village Animal Health Workers (VAHW); 
technical support for on-farm development  by freelance JTAs and Village Agriculture Workers  (VAW); 
and extension support for livestock, agriculture and horticulture; supply of seedlings and services like 
pruning and on-farm development by Local Resource Persons  (LRP). Some Agro-Vets also employ 
VAWs, VAHWs and LRPs as sales agents who dispense technical advice. Agro-Vets selling pesticides 
and herbicides must be registered with the government after successfully completing seven days 
training on the use of pesticides though many do not do so. Though Agro-Vets, VAWs and VAHWs are 
registered with the district agencies, the extent of their presence and scale of their operations is not 
well researched and documented. What does stand out from the HVAP experience, the experience of 
the USAID supported KISAN Programme and field observations is that there is widespread presence 
of private service providers in the field and farmers are willing to pay for quality inputs and services. In 
fact, the extension staff at the government LSCs can themselves charge a fixed fee as approved by 
the DLSO for services like castration, deworming and artificial insemination and farmers routinely pay 
for such services. 
  Field observations indicate that there are many unemployed youths trained as LRPs, VAWs, 
26.
VAHWs and JTs/JTAs. Many work on contractual jobs with NGOs in donor supported Programmes, 
including HVAP as Social Mobilisers and LRPs. Some of them could be the input dealers for fertilizer 
and other inputs, including recommended practices from extension services. 
  NGOs and civil society institutions. There are several national and local NGOs providing 
27.
agriculture and livestock extension services in rural Nepal, primarily as partners in donor-aided 
Programmes in specific pockets. Most rely on VAWs, VAHWs and JTAs as Programme specific staff 
and thus have limited technical capacity. Apart from their limited outreach and capacity, their 
operations remain of doubtful sustainability as their funding is largely from donor-aided Programmes.

Agriculture Sector Development Programme 
Final programme design report 
Appendix 1:  Country and rural context background 
Constitution of Nepal, deep restructuring of the state apparatus ushered in under the new Constitution 
of Nepal and adoption of the new Agriculture Development Strategy (ADS) in 201. 
29.
  The new Constitution of Nepal unambiguously places agricultural extension in the domain of 
the municipalities. Schedule 8 of the Constitution of Nepal, listing powers of the local bodies includes 
‘management, operation and control of agricultural extension’ besides another entry as ‘agriculture 
and animal husbandry, agro-products management, animal health’. While ‘agriculture and livestock 
development’ is included in Schedule 6 pertaining to powers of States and ‘agriculture’ is also listed in 
Schedule 9 pertaining to concurrent powers of the three levels, management of agricultural extension 
is a separate entry only in the list of powers of the local bodies. Thus, with the implementation of the 
new Constitution of Nepal, DADO and DLSO will cease to exist and agriculture and livestock 
extension will devolve to the municipalities. The present service centres (ASC and LSC) will be 
redeployed in municipalities and technical staff will be augmented as the number of service centres 
presently is less than the number of municipalities. There will also be subordinate (JT/JTA) level 
technical staff at the ward level though their number is yet to be decided. 
30.
  Decentralisation and ADS. Nepal adopted a new, 20-year ADS in 2014. Though the ADS 
predates the new Constitution of Nepal, it is largely in harmony with its provisions as it draws on the 
principles of decentralisation embodied in the 1999 LSGA which have been broadly carried forward in 
the Constitution of Nepal. The ADS recognises the extremely limited outreach of the present 
extension system, the ‘progressive policy shift from dominance of public extension system to 
institutional pluralism’ and advocates a ‘transformation of the role of government staff from delivery of 
extension services to overall facilitator of agricultural extension services’ with greater emphasis on the 
delivery at ward level. The ADS, itself, was developed with farmers’ participation and considers 
farmers, their collectives and the private sector as key stakeholders in developing and implementing 
extension and farmer service strategies with the government playing a coordinating and backstopping 
role. 
  Towards that goal, the ADS proposes a flagship programme called DSTEP, which aims at 
31.
decentralizing the extension and research system while fostering coordination of research, extension, 
and education in order to enhance responsiveness to farmers’ and agro-enterprises’ needs. A key 
component of DSTEP is setting up Community Agricultural Extension Service Centres (CAESC) at 
each ward. The CAESC is proposed to have membership of farmers, agro-enterprises and extension 
service providers. The finances of the CAESC were to comprise of contributions by members as 
membership fees, subventions from ward or municipality budget, seed funding from Central and 
Provincial governments, Programmes and service fees or other economic activities it initiates. 
  To summarise, the agricultural extension and service delivery system in Nepal is slated to 
32.
undergo major shifts towards devolution, farmers’ and other stakeholders’ participation, and plurality 
of service providers with the government playing a backstopping and coordination role rather than one 
of direct services delivery. 
Implementation of the new Constitutional provisions and the strategies spelt out in the ADS will 
33.
call for setting up and capacitating mechanisms (regardless of the nomenclature) at the Municipality 
and Wards to manage agriculture and livestock extension services within their territories once 
elections to these local bodies are completed in May 2017 and they assume office. ASDP will build on 
this opportunity to foster establishment of participatory and pluralistic extension and farmer service 
delivery mechanisms in the proposed 10 districts in State 6, with specific focus on the value chains 
selected for development. This represents the vision of how the extension system may pan out once 
the elected governments are in place and have developed their policies, strategies and structure. 
  Farmers’ Organisations (FO) in Nepal. Farmer Organisations in Nepal broadly form into two 
34.
categories, groups and co-operatives. Co-operatives are legal persons as these are incorporated 
under the Co-operatives Act, whereas other groups, though registered with sponsoring government 
departments are informal associations of persons. A large number of groups exist in rural Nepal, 
organised by various sectoral agencies and Programmes. These include farmers’ groups organised 
48 
Nepal 
Agriculture Sector Development Programme 
Final programme design report 
Appendix 1:  Country and rural context background 
by DADO and DLSO, groups organised by the Women’s Development Department and MFIs for 
savings and credit, groups organised by NGOs as part of donor-aided Programmes (usually 
registered with the department sponsoring the Programme), community forestry users’ groups and 
groups formed by the NACCFL as primary units of the Small Farmers’ Agricultural Co-operatives 
affiliated to it. 
  Farmers’ Groups (FG): Farmers have been organised into groups by DADO (farmers’ groups) 
35.
and DLSO (livestock groups) following a commodity group approach to agricultural extension. Major 
programmes of the two departments go through groups, co-operatives or firms. According to ADS 
2014, the number of such FGs in each district ranges from 100 to 400 with 22,358 agriculture and 
14,360 livestock FGs reported in 2010. Records of registered groups are maintained by the ASCs/ 
LSCs and consolidated at their respective district offices, though nationally a system of regular 
reporting and consolidation does not exist and latest data about the number of groups across districts 
is not available. Groups, on their own or stimulated by the ASC/LSC apply for registration to the 
DADO/DLSO in a prescribed application form, affixing a NPR 10 revenue stamp. The application must 
contain the aims and objectives of the groups, pro-forma by-laws, date and place of regular meeting, 
monthly member contribution to the group fund and applications from all members, and must be 
signed by the chairman and secretary. It is forwarded by the JTs at the ASC/LSC to their respective 
district offices with their recommendation. There is no prescribed training curriculum and the JT may 
conduct one to two training sessions on keeping accounts and minutes. Groups must elect office 
bearers every year and renew registration every year but there is no limit prescribed for the number of 
years an individual can hold office through successive elections. There is no evaluation/rating of 
groups and registration is not cancelled except if a group does not apply for renewal of registration. 
There is no prescribed limit regarding the size of the group though groups are encouraged to keep 
membership between 15 and 25, with 25 considered the preferred size. Groups typically tend to have 
20 to 35 members. There is no requirement for FGs to ensure social inclusion. Groups are not 
required to get their finances audited but present the same to a general assembly of the members 
upon completion of the financial year. Overall, the outreach of DADO/DLSO groups is reported to be 
minuscule. 
Left to evolve on their own and with no group process inputs, FGs have largely become 
36.
transactional groups, playing the limited role of facilitating access to/delivery of specific services 
through aggregation. FGs also function as savings and credit groups, collecting monthly savings from 
members and extending loans to them from the pooled funds. Groups met during field visits had 
accumulated significant savings and the facility to save and access larger pools of funds seems to 
have emerged as the key motivation over time for continuation in FGs and individuals are often 
members of multiple groups for this purpose. As the savings and credit function requires recording 
and processing of transactions, groups tend to be headed by someone, usually a male, who can carry 
out these tasks and leadership continues to be perpetuated. 
37.
  Co-operatives: Co-operatives in Nepal are incorporated under the Co-operatives Act, 2048 
(1992) as amended in 2000. A cooperative (preliminary association) must have at least 25 members 
(there is no upper limit) and can further federate into sectoral and/or district associations and national 
associations with prescribed minimum members. Nepal had 33,599 co-operatives at the end of the 
previous Nepali fiscal year (July 2016) with 6,030,857 members (average membership 179); the 
corresponding numbers for State 6 were 4,750, 798,875 and 168, respectively. There were 2,151 co-
operatives in State 6 in the farm sector, broadly defined (agriculture, dairy, fruit and vegetables, 
coffee, medicinal plants and bee keeping), with a total membership of 209,233 and average 
membership of 97. Savings and credit, multi-purpose and agriculture, in that order, predominate the 
themes of co-operatives in the country, including State 6, and together they account for over 82 per 
cent of the co-operatives and 92 per cent of membership. Registration of co-operatives has to done at 
the concerned Divisional Office of the Co-operatives Department. A cooperative must specify its 
intended purpose/activities and territory, must get its finances audited by a Chartered Accountant, 
furnish a copy of its annual report and audited balance sheet to the Divisional Office within three 
months of closing of the financial year and must get its registration renewed every year. Co-operatives 
49 
Nepal 
Agriculture Sector Development Programme 
Final programme design report 
Appendix 1:  Country and rural context background 
with a turnover of over NPR 10 million must report monthly. An individual can be a member of multiple 
co-operatives but can be a member of the executive in only one. As in case of groups, people take 
membership in multiple co-operatives, primarily to access more credit. Often, members of several 
FGs come together to form themselves into a cooperative, and FG members individually also join co-
operatives. Most co-operatives offer savings and credit services to members besides the activities 
aligned to its objectives but must restrict such transactions within 49 percent of their turnover, except 
in case of co-operatives registered for savings and credit, in which case no other activity can be taken 
up. The cooperative department has a provision to conduct training for co-operatives on basic 
accounting, cooperative management, etc. but is constrained by limited budget and staff. Co-
operatives can also seek training inputs from the department for a fee. Besides the divisional offices, 
training is also conducted by the five regional offices and a central training institute run by the 
department. Overall, the department is understaffed to support and regulate co-operatives effectively. 
For example, the Surkhet divisional office responsible for three districts and 1,086 co-operatives has 
only 11 staff, mostly at the sub-ordinate civil service levels and often seeks help from the District 
Cooperative Union in its regulatory function. Co-operatives with larger volume of business and larger 
number of members, mainly the savings and credit and multi-purpose co-operatives, employ office 
staff (average number of employees is 1.68 per cooperative nationally and 1 for State 6). 
  Co-operatives and the new Constitution of Nepal: Co-operatives are not included in the central 
38.
list in the new Constitution of Nepal but are part of the state-level and municipal list of powers and in 
the concurrent lists. Once constituted, the municipal and State assemblies are likely to make laws to 
regulate co-operatives, especially as co-operatives are now considered one of the pillars of the 
Nepalese economy and as people’s institutions, are important politically. The most likely scenario is 
that municipalities will regulate co-operatives that operate within the municipal limits (most agriculture 
co-operatives), provinces will regulate co-operatives working across municipalities and their district/ 
provincial federations and the federal government will regulate co-operatives working across 
provinces and national federations. The present Co-operatives Act is also slated to be amended and 
one expected reform is to limit individual membership to one cooperative. 
  Rural finance access. The 2014 Finscope survey report estimated that 40 per cent of Nepali 
39.
adults are banked and 51 per cent are served by formal institutions (for savings, credit insurance or 
remittance). It also reported that 18 per cent of adults are excluded in the sense that they do not 
access either formal or informal financial services. The Mid-Western region is comparatively 
underdeveloped in terms of access to finance when compared with the rest of Nepal. It has the largest 
proportion of the population excluded from financial services – both formal and informal. It has also 
the least coverage by formal institutions compared to other regions.

  The access to formal credit is for only 15 per cent of the adults in mid-western region while 
41.
36 per cent access credit from informal sources.  Forty-nine per cent of adults do not access any form 
credit, which is likely to preclude many of them from undertaking viable livelihoods.  Any value chain 
activity in the context of low availability and access to credit will be a difficult proposition unless formal 
financial institutions are persuaded to expand operations, with awareness building among the 
population. 
42.
  Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB), the Central Bank, through policy directives, has been encouraging 
the banking institutions to lend to productive sectors77, including agriculture. Banking institutions are 
required to lend at least 12 per cent of their total credit portfolio to productive sector and NRB has 
further directed that, as part of productive sector lending, commercial banks, development banks and 
finance companies are required to provide 5 per cent, 4.5 per cent and 4.0 per cent respectively of 
their total credit portfolio to the deprived sector (loans up to NPR 1 million to poor and vulnerable 
households in rural and urban areas).  
  This fiscal year, NRB has further directed that commercial banks are required to lend at least 
43.
5 per cent of total portfolio to the deprived sector out of which 2 per cent should be lent directly on 
their own to the deprived sector. On representation from the commercial banks, however, this decision 
has been rolled back. NRB has now directed that the banks should provide at least 10 % of the total 
loan portfolio to agriculture which include production credit to farmers and also credit to 
agribusinesses. This policy directive is expected to give a boost to agriculture lending since as per 
NRB at present about 7.5 per cent of the banks’ portfolio is in agriculture. 
  The other policy instruments that NRB is using to improve lending in rural areas are through 
44.
(i) branch licensing policy: banks and financial institutions (BFIs) are required to establish rural 
branches in each municipality during 2017-18 to facilitate treasury operations. With this increase in 
branch network the access to banks for rural households will improve. To assist BFIs to establish 
branch networks in the pre-defined remote districts, an interest free loan is provided; (ii) interest 
subsidy of 6 per cent on agricultural loans for new customers up to a cap of NPR 3 billion loan 
disbursement per bank; and (iii) the promotion of branchless banking and agent networks to mobilise 
savings and remittances.  
45.
  NRB assures that there is no liquidity crunch in the market and that the occasional credit 
crunches that may occur are also addressed with the adjustment of policy instruments. With the 
recent policy directives for agriculture lending, the banks will step up lending to agriculture. A separate 
credit line is, therefore, not warranted. 
  Financial service providers in Programme area. Commercial banks, development banks, 
46.
finance companies and microfinance development banks (MFDBs), financial intermediary NGOs, 
district/multi district financial co-operatives and village level co-operatives are operational in the 
Programme area. District wise, the number of banking and financial institutions as reported by NRB 
are detailed in Table 3.

  While commercial bank branches are urban centric and cover nearby VDCs (now Wards), 
48.
micro finance development banks operate in more rural and remote villages. MFDBs and Co-
operatives have relatively larger presence in the Programme areas.  
  Commercial banks and development banks have offices in the main urban centres. Although 
49.
they finance some agro-processing, agro-trading and related businesses, with the exception of some 
of the largest agricultural conglomerates, financing for primary farming is restricted to walk-in 
customers and usually within a 30-kilometre radius of the branch. With the increase of the branch 
network to each municipality, financial services access is likely to improve during the next two years. 
  Agriculture Development Bank, (AgDB), a state-owned bank, is the major financier of 
50.
agriculture related activities, with about 30 per cent of its total loan portfolio in agriculture. The bank 
has branches in all Programme districts. While individual and informal group lending is carried out 
through the branches, bulk lending to co-operatives is carried out through the bank head office. All 
loans are collateral based. AgDB is one of the major channels for Government’s interest subsidy on 
agriculture loans. Branches are provided budgets under subsidized interest lending, which is usually 
limited and not all branches get such budgets. 
  Private sector banks such as Bank of Kathmandu, Kumari , NMG, Laxmi, Prabhu, Global IME 
51.
and Citizen bank have branches in the Programme districts, where they are opening additional 
branches as well as branchless banking outlets. Some of the donor programmes such as Sakchyam,

funded by DFID are partially covering the costs of branch expansion into mid-western and far-western 
regions. Some banks are using their branchless banking agents for loan documentation, which are 
then verified and sanctioned by the branch manager and the cash dealings of disbursement and 
repayments are carried out through the agent network. That agent network, however, is only 
operational in a radius of 30-kilometers from the branches. While only individuals and sole proprietors 
are at present enrolled as agents, some banks are keen to enrol co-operatives as agents. The 
branches as well as the head offices of these banks were met during the mission. The discussions are 
summarized in Appendix 1, Annex 1. Private sector banks are keen to partner with commercial 
agriculture Programmes of HVAP and the proposed ASDP because: (i) Programme interventions to 
provide forward and backward linkages apart from productivity enhancement support and insurance is 
likely to reduce the risks in agriculture lending; (ii) commercial farmers are expected to have adequate 
income and cash flows to repay loans; and (iii) this provides an opportunity to fulfil the direct lending 
targets for the deprived sector.  
  All the banks are lending to agri businesses such as agro vets, agri input suppliers, traders,

based, or based on an assessment of the receivables, stock and net trading assets.  Financing of 
these entities is mostly on a stand-alone basis, without linking their business to value chains.  Linking 
inputs to outputs, markets and logistics of storage and transport could improve bank understanding of 
the entire value chain and thus enable it to take better credit calls in other parts of the chain, also to 
secure repayments, by trapping the receivables of the borrower. Some commercial banks such as 
NMG bank and Kumari bank are also lending to co-operatives, especially agri-producer co-operatives 
with larger membership and loan needs. Loan processing and sanctions are centralised at head 
offices in commercial banks. 
  A few banks are also providing value chain financing including (i) wholesale lending for dairy 
53.
animals through milk collection centres with agreement from the  Dairy Development Corporation 
(DDC) for the repayment of bank loans through revenue trapping out of milk sale proceeds; 
(ii) financing of farmers for receivables from sugar mills; and (iii) financing of ginger farmers on the 
recommendation of the ginger processing factory, Organic Mountain Flavour (OMF), with the 
proprietor providing assurance for repayment of loans from the payables to farmers supplying ginger. 
These loans have been provided at an interest rate of between 6 per cent to 10 per cent per annum. 
Post-harvest marketing loans through warehouse receipt financing is in a nascent stage, with Banijya 
bank and Global IME lending against warehouse receipts, but banks are keen to explore this security 
mechanism after the stabilisation of warehousing and collateral management system. The key issues 
in financing against warehouse receipts are (i) reliable warehousing facilities in view of the fluctuating 
electricity supply; (ii) limited availability of trustworthy ware houses with good warehousing practices; 
(iii) the limited proximity of warehouses to farmers and their organisations.  
  Branchless Banking. Branchless banking, through the use of agents and part-time offices, as 
54.
well as other forms including mobile internet banking, mobile phone banking, automated teller 
machines and points of sale devices, has been introduced to enhance rural outreach by reducing 
transaction costs and avoiding the high fixed costs of maintaining branches. Many of these 
innovations have been facilitated by new information and communication technologies. Most of these 
innovations still operate on a limited scale and it is too early to assess their financial viability, poverty 
outreach and impact, however, a few are showing promise to` overcoming the boundaries of 
conventional financial services provision based on brick and mortar retail outlets of BFIs. Savings, 
remittances and payments are the usual products offered through branchless banking.  
  Micro finance development banks. The large micro finance development banks (Nirdhan, 
55.
Deprosc, Chhimek, Swalambhan, Gramauththan) are operational in the Programme area, as well as 
other smaller MFDBs. These MFIs provide group based lending largely following the Grameen model 
of joint and several liability (please see Appendix 1, Annex 2 for key discussions with MFDBs). They 
reportedly target women, from more marginalized sections such as Dalits and Janajatis. Compulsory 
savings are mobilized as well as a range of individual savings. A pension product that doubles in value

in 15 years is also offered by some MFDBs. Loans up to NPR 100,000 (USD 943) are collateral free 
and the maximum loan size is NPR 5 million (USD 47,170). The maximum loan term is 3 years. The 
rates of interest range between 18 per cent to 21 per cent for different MFDBs. Nirdhan and Chhimek 
offer agricultural loans that are structured like micro finance loans, with the maximum loan duration of 
2 years. Some MFDBs are offering insurance of livestock, in partnership with insurance companies. 
Twenty-five per cent of the premium collected is provided to the MFDBs as commission (15 per cent) 
and management costs (10 per cent).  MFDBs are operational even in remote wards (formerly VDCs) 
along the road corridors and thus can be potential lenders for value chain households. During mission 
interactions, MFDBs showed keenness to finance the sub-proposals of different value chain groups; 
however, the groups will need to be structured as per MFDB norms (5-member joint liability groups 
(JLGs) and 5 to 6 JLGs to form a centre).  
  Co-operatives. There are 33,599 co-operatives functional in the country with 6.03 million 
56.
members, 50 per cent being women. These co-operatives, as of mid-July 2016, have mobilised 
NPR 71 billion share capital (USD 670 million) and NPR 295 billion (USD 2,78 billion) as savings. The 
loans outstanding are NPR 289 billion (USD 2.7 billion). This amounts to 18 per cent of the combined 
deposit and 20 percent of the combined credit of the commercial banks and financial institutions 
regulated by NRB. This substantiates the significant role played by co-operatives in the financial 
sector. There are 4750 co-operatives functional in the mid-western region with 798,875 members, out 
of which 59 per cent are women. As of mid-July 2016, these co-operatives have mobilised 
NPR 4.5 billion (USD 42 million) as share capital and NPR 14.4 billion (USD 136 million) as savings 
and have loans outstanding of NPR 19.6 billion (USD 185 million). Co-operatives are registered with 
and regulated by Ministry of Cooperation (MoC). While most are functional in the limited area of a 
single ward, some are operational across a district and few have multiple-district operations.  
  Savings and credit, producer and multipurpose co-operatives are more in number and almost 
57.
all co-operatives undertake savings and credit operations. The numbers of agriculture/producer co-
operatives is increasing since further registration of multipurpose co-operatives has been put on hold 
and savings and credit co-operatives are registered only in rural areas. Lending to producer co-
operatives, moreover, is considered as direct deprived sector lending and getting external loans from 
banks is also easier. The membership of co-operatives is largely inclusive and thus co-operatives play 
a key role in financial inclusion as compared to banking and financial institutions. During field visits, it 
was seen that even in remote wards, co-operatives are functional in the Programme area. 
  Village co-operatives. There are multiple co-operatives in a village, each with a small 
58.
membership, ranging between 50 to 350 members, often including overlapping membership. As per 
the present cooperative law, a member can be a Board member in only one cooperative, but can be 
an ordinary member in multiple co-operatives. Co-operatives offer 2 to 3 types of savings and loan 
products. The loans are usually up to NPR 100,000 and rate of interest ranges between 15 per cent to 
18 per cent. The co-operatives need to work within a margin of 6 per cent. About 20 per cent of the 
village co-operatives are estimated to be borrowing externally from different banking and financial 
institutions to fulfil members credit needs. The National Cooperative Development Bank (NCDB) and 
RMDC are the major lenders; NCDB lends only to co-operatives; there are 2 branches in the 
Programme region, which reportedly cover 7 Programme districts. Loans are restricted 5 times the 
share capital. There is no recent study on the status and capacity development needs of the village-
level co-operatives. The Cooperative Department does not grade or rate the co-operatives. Co-
operatives met during the field visits expressed the need for business planning, financial management 
software and external resource mobilisation to fulfil member needs. 
  Small Farmers Agricultural Co-operatives Limited In the Programme area, 31 SFACLs are

operational and are organizationally linked to the SFDB, which provides them with wholesale finance. 
These co-operatives are well nurtured and capacitated by NACCFL and SFDB. The average 
membership is 660, nearly 95 per cent of the members being women. They provide a number of 
savings and loan products suitable for agricultural operations and investments. The maximum loan 
54

term is for 3 years. SFDB lends to very few co-operatives other than the SFACLs formed by them, 
since the bank is conscious of the quality of the institutions.  
60.
  Co-operatives  There  are  few  large  co-operatives  in  each  district,  which  have  operations  in 
many wards in the district and some of them have multi district operations. They form and work with 
groups  of  women,  usually  based  on  the  Grameen  bank-like  joint  and  several  liability  group-model. 
They  offer  a  variety  of  savings  and  loan  products  including  for  education,  house  improvement,  etc. 
These  co-operatives  are  borrowing  from  5  to  6 financial  institutions.  The  Rashtriya  Microfinance 
Development Centre, National cooperative bank, and many commercial banks are wholesale lenders 
to  these  co-operatives.  At  present,  there  is  adequate  funding  from  commercial  and  development 
banks for well-functioning co-operatives, as lending to such co-operatives enables banks to fulfil their 
deprived  sector  lending  targets.  These  co-operatives,  however,  are  planning  to  mobilise  additional 
internal resources of share capital and savings since the funds available are likely to decrease over 
time. These institutions are keen to develop agricultural credit products to cater to the needs of rural 
producers and also to differentiate themselves from MFIs. 
61.
  Cooperative  support  organisations.  RMDC  provides  wholesale  loans  to  MFIs,  including  co-
operatives.  Out  of  their  210 partners,  80 per  cent  are  reported  to  be  co-operatives.  Small  co-
operatives  with  net  worth  of  NPR 500,000  can  also  borrow  from  RMDC  provided  they  are  well 
managed.  RMDC  also  provides  training  and  mentoring  support.  SFDB  usually  promotes  new  Small 
Farmers  Agricultural  Co-operatives  Limited  (SFACLs)  and  lends  to  them.  SFDB  partners  with  the 
National Agriculture Central Cooperative Federation Limited (NACCFL) for initial mobilization, capacity 
building and training of the SFACLs and, once the SFACLs reach maturity, SFDB takes over. NACCFL 
also works with other donor programmes to strengthen agricultural co-operatives. In collaboration with 
Magnus consultancy, NACCFL has also established software adopted by 600 of its  800-member co-
operatives. The software tracks financial services and commodity specific data.   
62.
It is generally perceived that co-operatives, particularly in the Programme area, require intense 
training  and  mentoring  support  to  function  effectively.  The  training  needs  include  accounting  and 
financial  management,  good  governance  and  adoption  of  cooperation  principles,  business  planning 
and  raising  internal  and  external  resources  to  fulfil  member  needs,  product  development,  etc.  
Government should also prioritise consolidation of co-operatives and their membership to bring down 
their  number  and  reduce  multiple  membership  in  order  to  improve  viability.  A  proposed  bill  on  co-
operatives  reportedly  has  provision  of  allowing  membership  to  an  individual  to  only  one  type  of  
cooperative, which is likely to lead to such consolidation.  
63.
  Rural  insurance.  Rural  insurance  is  nascent  in  Nepal  with  only  4 years  of  experience.  The 
Beema  Samiti  (Insurance  Board)  is  an  autonomous  body,  established  to  develop,  and  regulate  the 
insurance  business  of  Nepal.  The  Board  has  developed  crop,  plantation  and  livestock  insurance 
products  in  collaboration  with  departments  of  agriculture  and  livestock,  which  are  distributed  by  the 
17 non-life insurance companies offering rural insurance products. The Insurance Board has allocated 
districts  among  the  insurance  companies  averaging  3  to  5 districts  per  company  where  they  are 
required  to  provide  focused  attention;  but  companies  are  free  to  operate  in  any  district.  Producer 
households  are  free  to  enrol  with  any  insurance  company  operational  in  their  district.  GoN  has  a 
scheme of subsidising 75 per cent of the insurance premium for crops, plantations and livestock, with 
farmers paying only 25 per cent of premium at the time of enrolment. Insurance companies have very 
limited agent network in rural areas. While the Insurance Board and Department of Agriculture have 
been  taking  initiatives  to  improve  farmers’  awareness  about  the  need  for  insurance  and  also  about 
product features of various insurance products, the off take so far has been very limited in rural areas 
including  in  the  Programme  districts  as  seen  during  field  visits.  The  claim  settlement  procedure 
involves  photo  documentation,  ear  tagging  in  case  of  animals,  “panchnama”  (certification  from  5-
member  committee  from  VDC),  and  certification  by  agriculture/livestock  officer  at  agriculture  service 
centre. The Insurance Board is developing a web based reporting system and the data availability will

improve  in  a  year’s  time.  Data  on  overall  premium  collected  and  claims  paid  out  shows  that  the 
payout to premium collected has been 48 per cent to 55 per cent in last two years78
.  
64.
  During field visits it was seen that goat insurance is popular among both farmers and insurance 
companies. Dairy animal insurance faces moral hazard due to inflation of value of animal at the time 
of under writing. Insurance companies are keen to partner with the programme to improve uptake of 
insurance products as well as in reducing moral hazards. Out of the value chains to be supported by 
the  Programme,  insurance  products  are  not  available  for  turmeric,  ginger  and  timur.  For  crops  and 
plantations,  the  sum  insured  at  present  covers  only  input  costs  and  not  the  value  of  outputs. 
Insurance Board mentioned that the Programme could work with Insurance Board and Department of 
Agriculture to develop suitable new products and modify the existing products to cover actual market 
value. The board is also keen to develop group insurance, which  will reduce the transaction cost for 
both the members of groups as well as for insurance companies.  
  A weather-based insurance product is being piloted in select crops and areas including apple in 
65.
Jumla  district.  Shikar  insurance,  which  has  developed  weather  insurance  product  for  apples,  has 
improved  the  features  during  2017-18  for  better  off  take,  and  is  also  expanding  its  weather  based 
insurance to the nearby districts of Kalikot, Mugu, Dailekh for additional crops. The Insurance Board is 
keen  to  develop  weather  index-based  insurance  around  a  25-kilometre  radius  of  existing  weather 
stations since weather data is needed for 30 years to develop new products.  
  Financial  literacy.  NRB  has  been  keen  to  promote  financial  literacy  for  the  vulnerable  and 
66.
deprived  sector  households  and  banking  and  financial  institutions  emphasise  the  need  for  financial 
literacy,  however,  few  financial  institutions  provide  financial  literacy  to  their  members/  clients.  Three 
concerns  are  expressed  by  financial  service  providers:  (i) producers  are  members  in  multiple 
institutions and  are also saving  in  each  of them and they  need  better understanding of savings and 
returns and also safety of savings; (ii) multiple loans can lead to over indebtedness and since women 
are targeted by most of the financial providers, it is necessary to train them on prudent credit off take; 
(iii) money being fungible, members often use credit for multiple purposes much to the discomfort of 
lenders especially when the loan sizes are getting larger.. The Financial Literacy Policy and financial 
literacy materials developed by NRB is in the process of approval from the Government. 
67.
  Rural Infrastructure. In this document, infrastructure refers to the physical links and nodes of 
networks organised in interrelated systems designed to give a service that addresses economic and 
social needs. They are built, operated, maintained and decommissioned. The infrastructure systems 
rely  on  non-physical  services  for  its  functionality.  Rural  infrastructure  facilitates  the  inbound  and 
outbound supply chains for goods and services in rural areas.  
  The Nepal Local Infrastructure Development Policy (2016), categories local infrastructure in the 
68.
following  sectors,  among  others:  (i) Local  transportation  –  district  core  road  network  (DRCN)  and 
village  road  (VR)  networks,  suspension  bridges,  and  tracks  among  other  forms  of  transport; 
(ii) Irrigation  and  river  control  for  irrigation  Programmes  up  to  25 ha  in  the  hills  and  200 ha  in  terai; 
(iii) Micro-hydropower  and  alternative  energy  –  production  and  distribution  of  up  to  500 kw  and 
development  of  alternative  energy;  (iv) Water  supply,  sewerage  and  sanitation  –  rural  water  supply, 
sewerage,  domestic  and  community  sanitation  and  improvement  of  the  environment  Programmes; 
(v) Solid  waste  management  –  collection,  segmentation  and  transportation  of  waste  from  VDC 
centres;  and  (vi) Social  infrastructure  –  construction,  operation  and  maintenance  of  public  building 
such  as  for  health  and  education.  The  road  network  is  divided  into  three:  Strategic  Road  Network 
(SRN),  main  highways  feeder  roads  and  Local  Road  Network  (LRN)  –  rural  and  urban  roads.  The 
LRN  is  made  up  of  the  DRCN  and  VR.  Agricultural  roads,  defined  as  roads  connecting  main 
agricultural production centres79, are placed together with village roads in the National Plan for Rural 
Road  Maintenance  (2001).  This  Programme  will  treat  agriculture  roads  as  in  the  same  category  as 
78 During 2016-17, premium collected is NPR. 19 million and claims paid is NPR 8.3 million (7 months data). During last year, the premium 
collected is NPR. 278.7 million and claims settled NPR 159 million.

village  roads,  and  may  use  the  two  terms  interchangeably.  Municipalities  are  responsible  for  the 
development and maintenance of the local infrastructure, with assistance from DoLIDAR. 
69.
Local  transportation:  The  main  development  corridors  in  Nepal  are  along  the  SRN  transport 
corridors,  especially  in  the  hilly  and  mountainous  areas.  Local  infrastructure  along  these  routes  in 
lowland  areas  are  relatively  well  developed,  with  the  rest  of  the  country  largely  sparsely  populated, 
with  under  developed  infrastructure.  The  main  infrastructure  services  in  rural  areas  supported  by 
government are roads, water supply, energy and telecommunications. It is widely recognised that rural 
infrastructure  is  perhaps  the  biggest  hurdle  of  all  for  the  development  of  rural  areas  in  Nepal.  In 
general, the SRN roads are good, but in the hilly/mountain rural areas, the roads become narrow, turn 
to  mud  or  disappear  altogether  and  there  is  low  coverage  of  the  electricity  grid  or  water  supply 
networks. This leads to high post-harvest losses of surplus production due to lack of transport links, 
refrigeration of produce and inability  to make timely shipments to markets. The LRN road network in 
Nepal currently comprises of 25,728 km of DRCN and 31,904 km of VR roads (57,632 km in total) in 
the  formal  inventory,  of  which  only  2,004 km  are  blacktop,  12,823 km  are  gravel  and  the  remaining 
42,805 km  are  earthen  roads.  The  LRN  is  under  the  responsibility  of  the  DoLIDAR,  under  the 
MoFALD.  Under  the  pre-2017  institutional  framework,  of  the  3,157 VDCs  and  217 municipalities, 
2,789 VDC centres and all municipalities are accessible using the DRCN, but 368 VDC have no road 
access. 
  The development of local roads is urgently needed in Nepal’s rural areas where poor access to 
70.
rural towns and villages prevents rural populations from participating in and benefiting from a range of 
economic  activities  designed  to  benefit  rural  populations  and  poverty  groups,  hence,  “more  than 
80 per cent of the total local government budget is spent on local level roads and bridges”80. The zone 
of influence for road networks in Nepal is taken to be 2 hours walking distance in the terai and   hours 
in the mountainous terrain. During the rainy season, the unpaved roads are mostly impassable due to 
poor drainage, broken or missing structures and slippery surfaces. 
71.
Infrastructure policy and regulatory framework. Under the new Constitution of Nepal, States 
will  be  responsible  for  state  level  electricity,  irrigation  and  water  supply  services,  state  highways, 
agriculture  and  livestock  development,  factories  and  industrialisation.  The  municipalities  will  be 
responsible  for  local  market  management,  environment  protection,  local  roads,  agricultural  roads, 
irrigation, water supply, small hydropower  Programmes and alternative energy, and the protection of 
watershed.  Under  the  local  infrastructure  development  policy  (LIDP)  (2004)  local  bodies  are 
“responsible  for  the  formulation,  implementation,  monitoring  and  evaluation,  maintenance  and 
operation of local infrastructure”, including rural and urban roads and trails and trail bridges. Trails and 
trail  bridges  are  an  important  component  of  the  transportation  system  for  remote  rural  communities 
and a GoN priority.

that  use  traditional  forms  of  irrigation  such  surface  based  methods  (furrow,  and  basins)  and  non-
conventional  use  lifting  technologies  and  solar  power,  drip  and  sprinkler  irrigation.  The  irrigation 
regulation  requires  that  farmers  form  water  user  associations  (WUA)  that  are  registered  with  the 
Department of Irrigation (DoI). In practice WUAs are registered only if they are to receive support from 
government  through  the  DoI.  Farmers  apply  for  assistance  in  irrigation  development  from  the  DoI 
through an application, and payment of a commitment fee NPR 50/ha. The DoI undertakes feasibility 
studies and detailed designs. If the irrigation scheme is feasible, the farmers will pay 5 per cent of the 
investment costs and government will pay the balance.

Appendix 2:  Poverty, targeting and gender 
Poverty 
1. 
Poverty in Nepal is multidimensional, involving a complex interplay between low assets 
(physical, financial and human), years of conflict, insecurity and natural disasters, indebtedness, poor 
infrastructure and public services, traditional roles and other factors. While all the inhabitants of 
specific regions may have a shared vulnerability to these events, the consequences of natural 
hazards, seasonality, infrastructure and social remoteness, are felt more severely by the poorest 
groups as they inhabit the marginal areas and lack the resources to withstand shocks. Though they 
may be considered as the most resilient strata of the rural population, their survival mechanisms have 
resulted in them being highly risk adverse, with low levels of livelihoods and technology adaption. 
Incidence of poverty remains high at 25.2 per cent82 and a large percentage of population live around 
the poverty line making them vulnerable to immediate shocks.  
Social inclusion has, historically, been a part of the political, economic and social development 
2. 
of Nepal. The armed conflict of the Maoists, however, set up the space for a more comprehensive 
vote-based system and gave a chance to address issues of social prohibition. The administration has 
amended several biased laws and provisions and has demonstrated its dedication to gender equality 
and social inclusion by signing several social conventions. Despite progressive laws and a vibrant civil 
society, however, Nepal still has many challenges when it comes to translating these laws into action.  
Social Exclusion: The Nepal Multidimensional Social Inclusion Index, 2014, reports that the 
3. 
social groups that constantly appear at the top ten and bottom ten of the index remain more or less 
the same with Madhesi, Dalit and Hill Dalit ranked low in almost all dimensions. In Nepal, there is a 
great deal of discrimination based on socially constructed values and beliefs which prevents some 
groups from performing certain activities or from participating in the public arena. This indicates a low 
level of social cohesion. The belief that Dalit people are “untouchable”, for example, has fuelled 
various types of discrimination including spatial segregation. Muslims, other Terai castes, Hill Dalits, 
Terai Janajatis, and Terai Dalits score lower than the national average in adult literacy and many have 
not completed basic schooling. This composite group also suffers from a lack of access to health 
services due to affordability, lower child survival rates, food sufficiency etc. While the Madhesi/hill 
Dalits and Muslims are lowest in most human development indicators, the other Madhesi castes and 
Janajati groups also suffer from similar disparities. The Dalits and Muslims are ranked lower than the 
national average in all the domains. 
Using the international poverty line 
4. 
of USD 1.25 per day, the incidence of 
poverty has declined steadily from 
68.0 per cent in 1996 to 53.1 per cent in 
2004 and 24.8 per cent in 2011. Poverty 
monitoring by the Central Bureau of 
Statistics shows that poverty remains high 
in the Mid-western and far-western 
regions, and that poverty rates are higher 
in rural areas (35 per cent) than in urban 
areas (10 per cent). The results of a 
poverty head count computed using the 
cost of basic necessities reveal that one in 
every four Nepali is poor. It is a general assumption that of the more spent on food consumption as a 
proportion of total household expenditure, the higher the level of poverty. Similarly, elementary 
(unskilled) occupations are likely to generate low incomes leading to increased chances of poverty.

Appendix 2:  Poverty, targeting and gender 
The female-headed households in the country have increased by about 11 percentage points from 
14.87 per cent in 2001 to 25.73 per cent in 2011.  
The poverty rate (Table 1) is much lower in the Newar and the Brahmin than other 
5. 
castes/ethnicities. Table 1 below indicates that poverty incidence is least with the Newar (10.25 per 
cent) followed by the Brahmin (10.34 per cent) and highest with the Dalit of the Hills (43.63 per cent). 
Within the Hill area, poverty ranges from 10.34 per cent with the Brahman to 43.63 per cent with the 
Dalit. Similarly, within the Terai area, poverty ranges from as low as 18.61 per cent with the Brahman 
to as high as 38.16 per cent with the Dalit. There is a wide disparity in poverty within each 
caste/ethnicity.83

Poverty is most prevalent in the mountains of Nepal, at 42.3 per cent, in contrast to an average 
6. 
of 8.7 per cent in the urban hills. Poverty incidence in State 6, about 45.6% in 2011,84 is not only the 
highest in Nepal, but is also rising. The poverty gap index in State 6 was also the highest at 10.74 per 
cent in 2011.  
Poverty incidences by caste and ethnicity are highest amongst the hill and Terai Dalits 
7. 
compared to the other social groups. It is not only widely acknowledged that the lack of political 
representation of different social groups causes disparities in economic poverty and human 
development; but also, that participation of these groups in decision making processes is 
indispensable. Studies show that females, Dalits, Janajatis, Madhesis and Muslims were under 
represented in almost all organs of State and society. As a result, these groups are lacking a voice, 
agency and influence necessary for removing barriers and increasing access to development 
opportunities that will result in improved livelihood status. HVAP has, to the extent possible, been able 
to address inclusion, but there is a need to strengthen this approach. Table 2 provides an overview of 
the dimensions and basis for exclusion in Nepal.

The Programme will be implemented in Surkhet, Dailekh, Salyan, Jajarkot, Kalikot, Jumla, 
9. 
Mugu, Dolpa, Humla and Rukum (western) districts in State 6 of Nepal. The four highlighted 
districts are incremental to the HVAP area and will be integrated into the Programme in line with the 
development of the (i) Chhinchu-Jajarkot–Dolpa; (ii) Surkhet-Kalikot-Jumla-Mugu; (iii) Surkhet- 
Dailekh road corridors; and (iv) Mid-hills highway. The programme will commence immediately in the 
six existing HVAP districts and in Mugu and Rukum (Western). Sub-component 4 activities will 
commence initially in Dolpa and Humla with other activities being integrated in to the Programme as 
road access improves. The PCO will be based at Birendranagar in Surkhet district, while three 
corridor-based coordination units will be established in strategic locations for technical backstopping, 
field level coordination and programme monitoring and supervision. The Programme year 3 and 4 will 
see a surge in the interventions when the maximum number of groups will be formed or included.

10.  Poverty will be addressed through the promotion of agribusiness and rural non-farm activities 
aimed at promoting inclusiveness through the acceleration of sustainable, multi-sector and 
connectivity based growth. This will result in increased food and nutrition security benefiting the poor 
rural households.  Improved agribusiness infrastructure and value chain development will help 
establish innovative, integrated linkages with various stakeholders. The improved road connectivity 
will improve physical and economic access, and facilitate the adoption of suitable inputs and 
technologies. Expansion of participatory research and extension that is responsive to the real needs 
of the farmers, including women, poor and disadvantaged will more effectively address the agro-
ecological and socio-economic needs of different types of farmers. Training of public and private 
extension workers on the adoption of climate resilient farming systems and improved access to 
appropriate rural finance and insurance services will provide a cushion to poor farmers and avert 
adverse risks.  
11.  The Programme will target smallholder producers and landless rural people (value chain labour, 
small livestock, etc.) interested to engage in market-driven value chain activities. HVAP experience 
indicates that this is an inclusive process with most households in HVAP-supported hamlets and 
villages progressively participating in value-chain linked production and processing activities. Women 
will form 2/3rds of the Programme beneficiaries and disadvantaged households including Dalits, 
Janajatis, Muslims, youth, landless and other disadvantaged groups will be specifically targeted for 
Programme inclusion (25 per cent target). The Programme will develop specific mechanisms for poor 
households to be able to join appropriate value chains, however, poor and marginalised households 
will also benefit from expanding local agriculture employment opportunities associated with value 
chain-driven growth. It is expected that the ASDP will serve around 35,000 direct beneficiaries 
(producers households and agri-industry entrepreneurs and employees) and around 40,000 indirect 
household beneficiaries (through public infrastructure, financial services and agricultural extension 
development).  
12.  The new Programme will include 25 per cent Dalit households in all activities. Among the 
97 caste/ethnic groups, the Kisan, Nuniya, Chidimar, Khatwe, Bing/Bin, Raji, Chamar, Patharkata, 
Dusadh and Musahar experience the lowest levels of economic inclusion. Many of these groups are 
Madhesi Dalit whom the Programme will target in its inclusion strategy. Table 5 below provides the 
vulnerability characteristics of the target groups that are particularly marginalised.  
85 HVAP beneficiaries will not be eligible for grant co-financing under the ASDP.

 The Programme includes two specific interventions to ensure that poorer, more risk averse 
13. 
households are able to participate and benefit from the Programme,– one that facilitates the 
participation of households which have land suitable for the production of high value commodities but 
did not or were not able to join value chain groups, and the other aimed at landless and near landless 
households and those that prefer employment to production, which will provide vocational training to 
facilitate the take up of jobs either created by the Programme’s interventions or available from the 
market. 
IFADs focus is on “Rural people who are living in poverty and experiencing food insecurity, who 
14. 
have the potential to take advantage of improved access to assets and opportunities for agricultural 
production and rural income-generating activities” ("productive poor"). Targeting is important in order 
to ensure that Programme implementation is executed in such a way that a specific target group (part 
of the larger target population) will have ownership of the Programme, can fully contribute and 
participate in its activities, and will have access to its services and benefits.  
IFAD’s special targeting efforts are based on the recognition that rural poverty reduction and 
15. 
food security will not happen simply as a result of macroeconomic or sectoral growth, although growth 
is necessary. Poverty is not just a condition of low income. It is a condition of vulnerability, exclusion 
and powerlessness. It is the erosion of people’s capability to be free from fear and hunger and to have 
their voices heard. Poverty reduction is about enabling poor women and men to transform their lives 
and livelihoods, and supporting governments and civil society in creating and maintaining the 
67

Appendix 2:  Poverty, targeting and gender 
conditions that allow them to do so (IFAD, 2014). The ASDP intervention strategies focus on 
proactively including the identified target groups.  
16.  The Programme will apply a targeting approach focused on poor and vulnerable households 
within the ten districts that make up the Programme area. In doing so, it will apply an approach of 
social inclusion, ensuring that the target group members have the opportunity to be fully involved in 
and benefit from Programme activities, without, however, excluding other members of the Programme 
communities who may act as leaders, early adopters and risk takers and, in so doing, benefit the 
targeted communities and the poor and vulnerable within these communities. There will be a 
particular emphasis on women’s participation. Taking into account the different dimensions of poverty 
and the country strategy, the overall target group of the Programme will be the members of the poor 
and food insecure households who are facing a lack of access to resources and opportunities. They 
are often women or belong to socially discriminated groups such as the untouchables (Dalits) and 
indigenous groups (Janajatis). HVAP beneficiaries will not be eligible for grant co-financing under the 
ASDP.  
17.  The primary beneficiaries of the Programme also include sector agencies and institutions and 
the market systems, including the traders, and smallholder producers. The Programme will support 
and foster policy reforms to improve the enabling environment for investment in the agriculture sector. 
The investment component will support market outreach through connectivity to rural communities, 
and integrated linkages among stakeholders in the value chains. It will provide needed technologies, 
input, and services in meeting food deficiency and malnutrition. Under the investment component, 
staff competencies will be improved through a capacity development program for 3,000 agriculture 
service centre staff and other field persons, including women. Dalits will be provided with special 
facilities to ensure their inclusion in all Programme-led decision-making forums. If required, separate 
meetings and group discussions will be organised to ensure that their voices are heard. The 
Programme will also focus on both de jure and de facto female headed households with special 
priority given to poor and vulnerable female headed households. The Programme’s overall target 
group can be characterised as: 
  Ultra Poor.  The extreme poor are mostly illiterate, landless or near-landless households that 
have few assets. They survive by seasonal migration, bonded labour, the sex trade, gathering 
from open access resources, pawning or selling possessions and remittances. The 
Programme will assist this group by stimulating employment opportunities in co-operatives 
and value chain operations and improving access to common property resources; 
  Middle Poor.  These households have small landholdings and some livestock, however, they 
are often indebted and generally lack access to irrigation, but can generate small surpluses of 
agricultural products for sale. Remittances when available provide additional disposable 
income. Priorities for this group include measures to increase family income and reduce 
economic isolation by strengthening linkages to markets, technologies and input supplies, 
and, for some, access to irrigated land and financial services (both savings and credit); 
  Not So Poor.  This group includes small farmers suffering from the impact of conflict, debt, 
and land degradation. While they currently are above the poverty line, they are at risk of 
slipping back into poverty. They may have land suitable for cultivation but need higher 
technology or may be entrepreneurs who are willing to be part of the Programme with their 
own contribution.

will be provided through the Programme.

19.  The Programme will focus on the assets, livelihood constraints, productive potential, 
development opportunities and priorities and aspirations of poor people. In this way activities and 
services supported will be keyed to the identified target groups and be within their means. The 
Programme will ensure that the mix of benefits offered and transaction costs involved are more 
attractive to the poor than the better-off and take into account time, labour and capital constraints. 
Conversely, the Programme will also pay attention to factors that may inadvertently exclude certain 
groups of people, such as contributions or attendance at meetings, which may not be feasible in terms 
of cost or time for the poor, especially women. 
20.  Depending on the nature of the sub-component, a range of specific selection criteria for the 
selection of programme’s direct beneficiaries will be applied. The selection process for the 
Programme’s activities will follow a direct targeting approach, whereby CAESCs will conduct poverty 
profiling for their members in a participatory manner, assisted to fine-tune eligibility criteria for the 
identification and final selection of programme participants. Poverty profiling will be based on local 
poverty and vulnerability criteria and will be defined in a participatory manner by each CAESC, and on 
the basis of the Programme’s expressed preference to serve certain target groups for certain 
components and sub components. An index with a guideline for poverty profiling will be developed by 
the Programme to be used in selection of beneficiaries for the various activities related to the rural 
community. Physical verification of the beneficiaries will be carried out by the Programme staff. 
21.  Direct targeting consists of setting eligibility criteria for different types of activities and 
interventions that are to be channelled to specific members of the community like farmers groups, 
cooperative members, producer groups etc. Self-targeting is achieved by providing goods and 
services that respond to the priorities, assets, capacities and livelihood strategies of the identified 
target groups, but which are of less interest to those who are better off. Interventions benefiting whole 
communities will try to include as many poor households as possible in the different aspects of work 
wherever possible. As with the public nature of the productive infrastructure schemes, beneficiaries 
will include an entire community population. The marginalised and vulnerable populations will be 
involved as labour in the infrastructure work.  
22.  To ensure that benefits reach the identified target groups, the Programme will specifically gear 
information and communication to those who are generally less informed:  focusing skills and 
management training on these groups; raising awareness and building confidence; ensuring 
transparency and involvement of Programme participants in decision-making on resource allocation;

Targeting Challenges 
24.  With a programmatic approach to enhanced agricultural productivity and value chain 
development, there may be challenges that accompany such good intentions. The Programme will put 
in place cautionary steps to ensure that the challenges do not outweigh the interventions. Some of the 
challenges and possible interventions to counteract them are: 
 
Elite capture: This is possible within a strongly patriarchal community with uneven 
representation and participation of all groups. The elites may feel inclined to promote 
70 
Nepal 
Agriculture Sector Development Programme 
Final programme design report 
Appendix 2:  Poverty, targeting and gender 
 
 
 
 
their personal choice of development Programmes. In order to counteract this, the 
Programme will use a number of criteria and tools for beneficiary selection; 
Unequal access to assets: In order to be economically active one needs access to 
assets such as land, capital, information and extension services and education. With its 
social rules and institutions, however, Nepalese society often denies women access to 
certain assets and in consequence they remain in the more marginal and less profitable 
business activities. Women and poor households will be capacitated to increase their 
access to assets through the various support mechanisms being provided by the 
Programme;  
Social roles: Beliefs can refer to men and women as economic actors, their role as 
association members and appropriate work for them to engage in and their rights. Often 
such roles can be shaped so that women have less time available and fewer rights to 
participate in certain activities. Women will be encouraged to be part of all community 
decision making processes and in some cases the sole beneficiaries of activities. Female 
extension workers will act as role models for women as they go out and build the 
capacities of rural women to engage at a higher level; 
Risk profile: Women are often more risk adverse than men due to their household 
responsibilities and the fact that they have fewer resources or alternative options to count 
on, such as access to land or finance. This will be counteracted by the provision of 
financial and entrepreneurship capacity building programmes and linkages to markets 
with pro poor arrangements to enable women to move up the value chain; 
Risks of men’s capture of women benefits: Women have limited access and 
command over productive resources, rarely control the marketing of products and have 
almost no control of the incomes generated by them. Men normally take over women’s 
benefits if they are attractive enough for the men. To mitigate marginalisation or 
exclusion of women from planning and implementation process, the Programme will 
introduce measures like gender-balanced staffing of offices; provision of gender-related 
training; using the Household methodologies approach to empower women’s 
involvement in consultations, decision-making and monitoring processes, etc.  
25.  Gender inequality: Socially, Women and girls in Nepal are disadvantaged by traditional 
practices including the dowry system, early marriage, son-preference, stigmatization of widows, 
seclusion of women (purdah), family violence, polygamy, and the segregation of women and girls 
during menstruation (chhaupadi, which was recently declared as illegal in Nepal). The post-conflict 
Government has been legislating for more gender equality: Nepal in 2011 became the first country in 
Asia to develop a National Action Plan on Women Peace and Security, and women and girls’ rights 
are protected in the Comprehensive Peace Accord. Women nevertheless face an onerous triple 
burden as their role of caretaker is taken for granted and thus their economic contribution goes largely 
unnoticed. According to a 2014 Amnesty International report “Unnecessary Burden”, it is estimated 
that more than 600,000 women suffer from conditions related to uterine prolepses due to early 
marriage, early pregnancy, overwork and neglect. There is also wide spread socio-cultural violence 
against women which is manifested in different forms including bonded labour, domestic violence, 
witchcraft accusations etc. A survey by the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) in 2010 
revealed that around 3 per cent of households headed by women used mechanical equipment, 
compared with 8 per cent of those headed by men. 
26.  Gender and Climate Change:  According to a qualitative research in Nepal, the key impact of 
CC-induced events such as drying of ponds and springs, erratic rainfall, extended dry spells and 
droughts, amongst others, has been an increase in women’s workload, particularly for water 
71 
Nepal 
Agriculture Sector Development Programme 
Final programme design report 
Appendix 2:  Poverty, targeting and gender 
collection. Women have to wake up as early as 4:00 am in the morning to queue for scarce water. A 
study conducted by the ADB revealed that each female water carrier in general must reserve 
1.3 hours per day during the monsoon season and an average of two to three hours per day in the dry 
season to meet their daily household supply.86 More women than men are engaged in agriculture in 
Nepal. The percentage of women wage earners in agriculture and non-agriculture are 55.2 per cent 
and 44.8 per cent respectively, whereas men wage earners are 23.6 per cent and 76.4 per cent 
respectively. This indicates that CC impacts on agriculture will be greater for women, rendering 
multiple effects on women’s health, income, safety, nutrition, violence against women, and ultimately 
in women’s social, economic and political empowerment, thereby undermining the transformation in 
women’s empowerment. 
Health and nutrition 
27.  Government initiatives for nutrition security have been underway for more than three decades 
with national nutritional strategies developed in 1978, 1986, 1998, and 2004. A Multi-Sectoral Nutrition 
Plan (MSNP) 2013-2017 serves as a common results framework for improving nutrition outcomes; 
and setting out plans of action for implementing nutrition-sensitive policies and strategies for key 
sectors, including agriculture and food security, public health, and education. Its objectives are to 
reduce the prevalence of stunting among children under five to below 29 per cent, to reduce the 
prevalence of underweight to below 20 per cent to reduce the prevalence of wasting among children 
under five to below 5 per cent, and to reduce under-nutrition among women 15–49 years of age 
(BMI<18.5) by 15 per cent.  
28. 
In 2011, Nepal joined Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN), a global movement that unites national 
leaders, civil society, bilateral and multilateral organizations, donors, businesses, and researchers in a 
collective effort to improve nutrition. The World Bank is the donor convener for SUN in Nepal. SUN’s 
priority commitments in Nepal are to implement and scale up the evidence-based, cost-effective 
nutrition-programs of the MSNP; develop and implement a long-term National Food Security and 
Nutrition Action Plan; strengthen key sectors to implement the MSNP and National Food Security and 
Nutrition Plan; and strengthen monitoring of MSNP implementation, with links to existing food security 
early warning systems. In addition, the SUN Multi-Partner Trust Fund recently funded civil society 
organizations (CSOs) to establish a sustainable and inclusive civil society alliance on nutrition.  
29.  Nutrition-sensitive food value chains (NSVC) potentially have a positive impact on the 
nutrition security in a country or in a defined geographical area. The focus of NSVCs is on shaping 
food systems with regard to availability, affordability, and diversity of food. NSVCs target not only 
producers and other value chain actors but also consumers addressing not only quantity but quality of 
their diets as well. The shift is from the supply side to the demand side by accompanying measures 
such as nutrition education and Behaviour Change Communication (BCC) in nutrition etc. 
30.  Mainstreaming nutrition in IFAD is guided by the Nutrition Action Plan, which specifies goal, 
objective, strategic outcomes, and action areas and, in particular, food systems, which have a 
foundational role in nutrition. In the literature seven pathways linking agriculture and nutrition have 
been developed over time (see below)87. Pathways 5-7 are supported by the global evidence that 
shows income controlled by women has a greater positive effect on children's nutrition than that 
controlled by men88. Empowering women through targeted agricultural interventions can have a 
strong positive effect on child nutrition and household food security (Hawkes and Ruel 2008).

31.  Government departments working on nutrition and health: Since nutrition is inter-linked 
with hygiene and safe environments, the Programme will also work with the State and municipal level 
Public Health Offices and Water Supply and Sewerage Departments on integrating both aspects in 
the Programme’s nutrition interventions. WASH89 interventions are led by the government Water 
Supply and Sewerage Departments, supported in implementation by the donors and NGOs. DCCs 
have developed five-year master plans for of WASH activities, the implementation of which will be 
advanced to municipal responsibility under the new constitutional arrangements. The master plan is 
shared among all stakeholders to ensure that there is no duplication or replication of activities. 
Presently, there is no subsidy to build toilets though there is a material subsidy for the ultra- poor 
households in the form of pipes, cement and skilled labour. The government provides training to 
Social Mobilisers who are the main conduits for implementation of activities in the field and facilitates 
access to information and resources. These Social Mobilisers are generally recruited by the NGO or 
Donor implementing the sanitation programme.  
32.  Behavioural Change Communication (BCC) on WASH and Nutrition: The Public Health 
Office works mainly in the field of maternal and child health. With the thrust on nutrition, they have 
prepared a range of training materials and modules based on the mandate and messages provided by 
the National Health Education, Information and Communication Center (NHEICC). The health 
education and communication section in the regional directorates and regional training and health 
information departments implement BCC activities using various media and methods based on local 
needs90. Local media and language is used to disseminate health messages in the districts. The 
health office’s main means of transferring messages for pregnant and lactating mothers at the village 
level is through the village level female community health volunteer (FCHV). There is also an initiative 
on adolescent girl’s health but this is not prevalent in all the Programme districts. 
33.  The Nepal government is presently focused on implementing the open defecation free (ODF) II 
strategy alternatively called Post-Open Defecation Free (PODF). This is to ensure that household 
regularly use the toilets and continue good hygiene practices. There are six (6) key indicators that the 
government is monitoring on a regular basis including: safe hand washing, safe handling of water, 
personal and environmental hygiene, hygienic use of toilets, etc. The government has designed 
messages, posters and different media products that can be used at the village level. The government 
also issues a certificate of recognition to VDCs that are ODF and continue to be. The difficulties, 
however, lie in ensuring that adults become responsible role models for their children by ensuring best 
practices. The topography of the upper hills also causes issues in proper monitoring.  
Gender mainstreaming interventions in ASDP 
34.  Gender in the Organisation: Unlike HVAP, this Programme will ensure that at least 20 per 
cent women are recruited to middle and senior management levels. There will be additional scores for 
women in the recruitment process and women will paid on par with their equivalently qualified and 
experienced male colleagues. The Programme will maintain the maternity leave rule as applicable to 
all government establishments and ensure access to crèche services where required on a cost

integrated with an overall program) to develop communication strategies to promote positive behaviours which are appropriate to their settings.

sharing basis. The Programme will also apply flexi working hours so as to accommodate the 
household and child care demands of women staff members. The Programme will set up a Sexual 
Harassment Committee to address any complain of sexual harassment across all levels of the 
Programme and will also include the social mobilisers recruited by the NGOs. All Programme staff will 
be provided with training on sexual harassment at the workplace on a yearly basis. There will also be 
annual gender sensitisation and gender-in-value-chain training for all staff across all levels.  
35.  Women in organisational committees: The Programme will ensure that women are present 
in Programme decision making bodies. The Gender Equality and Social Inclusion (GESI) Specialist 
will sit on the Value Chain Management Committee and other programme management committees. 
The Specialist will represent the Programme on all social issues at both national and international 
forums.  The Programme will allocate at least 30 per cent of positions in all Programme-related bodies 
to women. This can be at any level within the federal structure.  
36.  Strategic Investment Plans will include a robust gender analysis. This will help in 
understanding the distribution of labour and workloads of women within the given value chain and 
help in identifying corrective action. Women working on Programme construction sites will be provided 
with social safeguards to prevent any harassment. The GESI Specialist will be responsible for drawing 
up a guideline for the women in construction. The Programme will ensure equal pay for equal work to 
both women and men.  
37.  Women’s Empowerment Index: The 
Programme will apply the Women’s Empowerment 
Index in the operational areas three times in the 
Programme life. This tool is based on the IFPRI 
Women’s Empowerment in Agriculture Index (WEAI), 
but has been made simpler and easier to carry out by 
The Hunger Programme. The main difference between 
the WEAI and the WEI is the survey length, study 
intensity and cost of calculation. The WEI strives to 
seek a balance between precision, cost and timely 
feedback. It considers empowerment to be a factor of both women’s achievements as well as of 
gender parity with men. WEI measures progress on women’s empowerment by aggregating results 
across five key areas (or "domains"). Each domain is comprised of a series of metrics ("indicators") 
that quantify performance in the respective domain. The domains include: agency, income, resources, 
leadership and time. Each domain contains two to three data points that serve as indicators to capture 
critical aspects of performance under that domain.  WEI provides an aggregated community score, 
rather than the individual scores for each household provided by the WEIA. Thus, this tool will be 
used for homogenously ethnic women’s groups.  
The Women’s Empowerment Index (WEI) 
is composed of two parts: the women’s 
achievement ratio (WAR) and the gender 
parity ratio (GPR). WAR WEI tracks the 
progress of women’s achievements, as well 
as compares those to men's achievements, 
over time. The index utilizes randomized 
household surveys to generate its data. A 
higher value of WEI indicates greater 
empowerment for women in that 
community. 
38.  Household Methodology: The Programme will 
implement the HHM as a pilot in about 4,000 households 
initially. As part of the HHM process, household members 
realize that inequalities in gender roles and relations can 
be part of the reason they stay poor. Hence, a household’s 
ability to understand the causes of their current situation – 
and their willingness to act upon the findings – is crucial for 
unlocking a household’s potential. There are several 
different HHMs, which vary in terms of type, cost and 
duration of the activities required to support their 
implementation. The methodologies, however, share 
similar principles, with a focus on people, empowerment, self-generated solutions and equal 
opportunities. The most common feature is the involvement of all household members, who – through 
different strategies and tools – are encouraged to create a household vision, assess their current 
economic and social situation, participate in joint livelihood planning and share the benefits that arise 
ANANDI (Area Networking and 
Development Initiatives), has been 
working with over 10,000 rural poor 
women in Gujarat since 1995. Forming 
women’s collectives and working 
towards changing the nature and 
direction of systemic forces which 
marginalise women has been an 
integral component of their work. They 
have been working on adapting the 
tools and standardised for use on rights 
and entitlements, engendering 
livelihoods 
74

Appendix 2:  Poverty, targeting and gender 
from working towards common goals. Service providers and facilitators support the implementation of 
HHM activities, which need to be embedded within an enabling environment at community level.  
39.  HHMs may be implemented through a wide variety of groups. The group acts as the entry point 
for reaching individual households with the visioning and action planning tools. Group members learn 
the basic skills in visioning and planning and then replicate the process at home, with the support of 
the group facilitator and peers, if necessary. Peer sharing triggers a multiplier effect among a wider 
audience and creates a supportive environment for behaviour change. The group-based approach 
can also be used to develop a group vision and action plan; this can advance the interests of the 
group as a whole and also help members realize their individual household visions. Embedding HHMs 
in existing local groups can make the process more sustainable and provides an opportunity to deliver 
HHMs at scale. The various methodologies share four basic principles:  
  Focus on people. Household strategies are designed by and for household members who 
define whom they want to be and what they want to do. They define and implement their own 
strategies for developing and improving their livelihoods, based on their goals, strengths, 
opportunities and assets; 
  Empowerment. The cornerstone of the HHM empowerment process is strengthening the 
capacity of individuals or groups to make choices and to transform those choices into desired 
actions and outcomes. This can be achieved by building on a mutual understanding of 
different roles and responsibilities; 
  Self-generated solutions. Willingness to change is generated by household members 
themselves (women and men of all ages) by placing them in the driver’s seat of the 
development process. They take responsibility for the changes they want to see and work 
closely with one another, friends and the community to make them happen; 
  Equal opportunities. Women and men, as well as youth, people with disabilities and other 
vulnerable groups, have an equal voice in setting the household vision and equal access to 
development opportunities, productive assets, decision-making and benefits. Some HHMs 
explicitly address gender relations with a “gender justice” lens, making the promotion of 
gender equality an essential goal of any type of intervention. In others, gender inequalities 
emerge as a factor limiting the achievement of household goals and the ability of households 
to better use the productive resources available to them, and participants commit to 
addressing gender issues as their own choice. 
40.  There are a few South Asian organisations that have been working on the same principal. 
Anandi91, based in Gujarat has been instrumental in contextualising the methodology to suit the sub-
continent social and cultural topography. They have used a rights-based approach in the use of the 
tools, which will reflect very well with the given socio-cultural context in Nepal. They have also 
developed a methodology for the facilitation process as this will be a key point in the success of the 
methodology. What works in the African situation as presently seen, will not necessarily work in the 
South Asian context and hence a more contextual framework is required. As their methodology 
includes intense facilitation at the field level, this might be an added advantage as it will be able to 
build the skills of the village volunteer and the community to vocalise their needs. The Programme will 
recruit the services of an agency to provide the training and methodology. The methodology for the 
layout will be discussed with the support agency as there isn’t any prescribed methodology to suit the 
Nepal context. The Programme in association with the service provider will map out the best possible 
implementation methodology.  
41.  Engendering training, capacity building and communication: It has been found that on-site 
demonstrations are the most effective in terms of knowledge retention and replication. Training, 
however, is not a simple activity – requiring an assessment of the trainee’s knowledge and creation of 
an enabling environment and opportunities for women and the poor to fully participate in the process. 
Supporting measures must be taken to ensure that women attend training and in addressing the

Agriculture Sector Development Programme 
Final programme design report 
Appendix 2:  Poverty, targeting and gender 
social balances between the roles of women and men. The Programme will adopt the following 
guidelines for making training and capacity building gender sensitive:  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
adapt programmes to women's needs and skills; 
ensure that the training venue is accessible and safe for women and can accommodate 
children who are under their care, if required; 
allow sufficient time to enable women to acquire new skills and adjust schedules to fit 
women's existing workloads; 
adapt the time of the trainings to the time availability of the women; 
ensure that the language is simple and catered towards the understanding levels of the 
participants; 
make all teaching methods and learning approaches inclusive, participatory and “gender 
transformatory” in order to ensure women's full and equal participation; 
use trainers who are not only technically competent and up-to-date, but who empathise 
with the needs and aspirations of rural women; 
produce messages in written, oral, and visual media, targeted to women farmers and 
presented by women announcers and performers to supplement face-to-face extension 
efforts. 
42.  A fundamental aspect of gender-sensitive communication for training and dissemination relates 
to the words and images we use to communicate. Forms of communication – whether written, oral or 
visual –  will be considered carefully by the Programme since they can perpetuate images of socially-
prescribed gender roles and behaviours. The choice and combination of communication tools will 
therefore take into account cultural, socioeconomic and gender conditions and the specificities and 
capacities of each group, as well as the goal of the initiative. The Programme will utilise a gender 
sensitive approach in all its communication media – resource and information, education and 
communication material, training handouts, policy briefs, internal and external reports etc.  
43.  Women in construction: The Programme will ensure the safety and security of women who 
will work as construction workers in the infrastructure component. Prior to building the infrastructure, a 
robust social and environmental assessment will take place. This assessment will look at all gender 
concerns and map out social constraints. The assessment will be taken very seriously in the 
implementation of the infrastructure. The African Development Bank has come up with a set of 
guidelines92 that will be applied while implementing the infrastructure component.  
44.  Staffing: At the village level, the Gender and Nutrition Social Mobiliser will be responsible for all 
tasks related to health, nutrition and the household methodology. At the PCO level, there will be a 
Senior Gender Equality and Social Inclusion Specialist who will lead the process. This position will be 
filled with an experienced Gender Specialist of not less than seven (7) years of experience. This 
position will be supported by a Health and Nutrition Specialist and a Household Methodology 
Specialist. Terms of reference are provided at the end of this document. The Programme will recruit a 
higher number of female Gender Nutrition Social Mobilisers – at least 60 per cent of them will be 
women and will be recruited from the villages where they will work as mobilisers. They will be 
provided training in nutrition, household methodologies and social mobilisation techniques. The 
Gender and Nutrition Social Mobilisers will be the main conduit for the social aspects of the 
Programme.

Agriculture Sector Development Programme 
Final programme design report 
Appendix 2:  Poverty, targeting and gender 
Annex 1. ASDP targeting checklist 
Key issue 
Design response 
1. Does the main target group - those expected to 
benefit most- correspond to IFAD’s target group as 
defined by the Targeting Policy (poorer 
households and food insecure)? 
Yes, the target groups fall into IFAD’s target group. 
The Programme has been designed to provide food 
security and employment opportunities to the food 
insecure and poor households by providing them with 
appropriate technical assistance and inclusion into the 
value chain. 
2. Have target sub-groups been identified and 
described according to their different socio-
economic characteristics, assets and livelihoods - 
with attention to gender and youth differences?  
Target groups have been identified according to their 
socio-economic status. The analysis includes the rural 
target groups, their characteristics and the Programme 
interventions to help them overcome poverty.  
3. Is evidence provided of interest in and likely 
uptake of the proposed activities by the identified 
target sub-groups? What is the evidence? (matrix 
on analysis of Programme components and 
activities by principal beneficiary groups 
completed?) 
All target groups are involved with agriculture as their 
primary livelihood. The Programme endeavors to 
enhance agricultural productivity to increase incomes 
thereby increase well-being of the households. The 
Programme is an uptake of the successful HVAP which 
has shown good practices in inclusion.  
4. Does the design document describe a feasible 
and operational targeting strategy in line with the 
Targeting Policy, involving some or all of the 
following measures and methods: 
4.1 Geographic targeting – based on poverty 
data or proxy indicators to identify, for area-based 
Programmes or programmes, geographic areas 
(and within these, communities) with high 
concentrations of poor people 
4.2 Direct targeting - when services or resources 
are to be channelled to specific individuals or 
households 
4.3 Self targeting – when goods and services 
respond to the priority needs, resource 
endowments and livelihood strategies of target 
groups 
4.4 Empowering measures - including 
information and communication, focused capacity- 
and confidence-building measures, organisational 
support, in order to empower and encourage the 
more active participation and inclusion in planning 
and decision making of people who traditionally 
have less voice and power 
The Mid Western region is identified as one of the 
most backward regions in Nepal. Poverty incidence in 
the mid-western development region is not only the 
highest but is also on the rise. The percentage of poor 
in the mid-western development region is about 
45.6 per cent in 2011 
There is an element of direct targeting as those who 
have the potential for commercialisation will be 
included in the Programme. There are also quotas for 
technical assistance and inbuilt checks and balances 
to ensure that the poor are also included in 
Programme interventions.  
The Programme will carry out several capacity building 
measures to enable the small holder institutions at the 
grassroots level to access information and services. 
Inclusion of the poor, women headed households and 
chronically poor households in Programme activities 
including community infrastructure will be a strong 
focus to provide space for the traditionally less 
empowered groups. 
4.5 Enabling measures – to strengthen 
stakeholders’ and partners’ attitude and 
commitment to poverty targeting, gender equality 
and women’s empowerment, including policy 
dialogue, awareness-raising and capacity-building 
The Programme includes measures like technical 
assistance, workshops with various value chain 
stakeholders and private sector, policy dialogue, 
partnership with likeminded organisations and 
interventions for strengthening attitudes. 
4.6 Attention to procedural measures- that could 
militate against participation by the intended target 
groups 
Specific focus has been emphasised for the inclusion 
of the target groups.

Key Issue 
Design Response 
1. The Programme design report contains – and 
Programme implementation is based on - gender-
disaggregated poverty data and an analysis of gender 
differences in the activities or sectors concerned, as 
well as an analysis of each Programme activity from 
the gender perspective to address any unintentional 
barriers to women’s participation.  
The analysis is based primarily on secondary data 
backed up by discussions with staff from other 
organisations.  However, there are some credible 
reports and documentation available on the poverty and 
gender situation of the country and were referenced. 
The analysis covers the agricultural sector and its allied 
activities for women and the constraints women face.   
2. The Programme design report articulates – or the 
Programme implements – actions with aim to: 
  Expand women’s economic empowerment 
through access to and control over productive 
and household assets; 
  Strengthen women’s decision-making role in the 
household and community, and their 
representation in membership and leadership of 
local institutions;  
  Achieve a reduced workload and an equitable 
workload balance between women and men.    
The Programme aims to bring women into the 
economic sphere by providing technical and grant 
facilities to leverage her agricultural based livelihoods. 
The Household Methodology will aim to address social 
inequalities within the household, community and group 
and to bring women to the forefront of decision making. 
The MSP will allow for women to voice their concerns 
and to find solutions to address them. There is an 
element of drudgery reduction by way of multipurpose 
water infrastructure, homestead gardens to address 
nutrition and nutrition education to ensure an equitable 
balance among the household individuals.  
3.  The Programme design report includes one 
paragraph in the targeting section that explains what 
the Programme will deliver from a gender perspective. 
4. The Programme design report describes the key 
elements for operationalizing the gender strategy, with 
respect to the relevant Programme components. 
5. The design document describes - and the 
Programme implements - operational measures to 
ensure gender- equitable participation in, and benefit 
from, Programme activities. These will generally 
include: 
5.1  Allocating adequate human and financial 
resources to implement the gender strategy 
5.2 Ensuring and supporting women’s active 
participation in Programme-related activities, decision-
making bodies and committees, including setting 
specific targets for participation 
Women play a key role in the operations of the 
implementing agency and this is reflected in the 
Programme design. The Programme will help poor 
women to engage in economic opportunities and 
enhance their capacity and mobility. 
The gender strategy will be mainstreamed throughout 
the Programme implementation and has laid down 
specific interventions that follow the Gender Policies of 
IFAD.  It will include a mainstreaming process to 
incorporate gender and social inclusion as a cross 
cutting issue with clear deliverables and budgetary 
allocations. This will be done through the integration of 
gender concerns and women’s empowerment in all the 
components and sub components at the operational, 
the organizational and systemic levels. 
There is a substantial budget and human resources 
placed in the current Programme to ensure that gender 
and inclusion are earnestly implemented. The 
Household Methodology will be implemented and will 
have its own budget and staff.  
There are checks and balances included in the gender 
interventions as well as in the implementation modality, 
which the Programme will be closely adhering to, that 
will allow for women’s participation. This is especially 
important to bring to the forefront, the constraints that 
women face in agriculture and the value chain systems 
in order to address them adequately.

Programme M&E unit collects, analyses and 
interprets sex- and age-disaggregated performance 
and impact data, including specific indicators on 
gender equality and women’s empowerment.  
Female mobilisers will be placed at the municipal level 
to facilitate women with the appropriate level of 
extension services required. All TORs of staff will 
include elements of gender sensitivity and the 
recruitment process will assess all candidates for 
gender responsive behaviours. 
There is a special allocation for female social mobilisers 
to ensure that the outreach to women is maintained.  
The value chain component is designed to support 
partnerships for market linkages and enhanced 
productivity. The Programme will also be focusing on 
social responsibility through pro-poor contract farming. 
The programme will ensure women, men, youth and 
farmer groups etc. are involved in discussions around 
agriculture systems for internal and export markets, 
whether individual, as part of a farmers group, or part of 
an out-growers scheme. The programme will look at 
strengthening the social capital and negotiation skills of 
poor farmers in general, and women and young people 
in particular, to enable them to participate effectively in 
value chain relationships 
The Programme logical framework has indicators to 
monitor and evaluate gender-disaggregated 
performance and impact. The PCO will ensure 
establishing the MIS system with sex-disaggregated 
data collection, gender based analysis, and review and 
reporting. The Programme will ensure accurate and 
timely data collected and analysed by sex and gender.  
All planning/programme formats and reports will 
incorporate sex and gender disaggregated data.

Appendix 3:  Country performance and lessons learned 
  Country context. The population in Nepal comprises significant ethnic diversity, with many 
1.
different languages and cultures. Population density varies considerably, as large parts of the country 
are too harsh for human settlement. The natural resource environment is rich and diversified, but also 
highly fragile, following reduction of the forest cover. The country’s per capita GDP was the second 
lowest in South Asia, recorded as USD 723 in 201693. Although Nepal has recorded improvement in 
its Human Development Index (HDI) in recent decades, it has the lowest ranking among the countries 
of SAARC, aside from Pakistan and Afghanistan (2014). Nepal made significant progress in achieving 
its MDGs (2000 to 2015). Poverty reduced from 42 per cent to 24.5 per cent and the majority of 
health-related MDGs were achieved, while targets related to hunger, universal primary education, 
gender equality and women’s empowerment were largely met. The latest NLSS reported 
improvements in households accessing a number of services and resources, while the overall state of 
economic growth, having fallen sharply after the 2015 earthquake, is now heading toward strong 
recovery, with agriculture remaining as the main driver of economic development.  
  Economic Development. Economic growth began to slow in Fiscal Year (FY) 2013/2014, 
2.
principally due to depressed agricultural production and low investment and then fell sharply to 0.6 per 
cent in 2015/16 due to the earthquake disaster and an economic blockade. It is now projected to pick 
up substantially to 4.6 per cent in 2016/17 and then to 4.8 per cent in 2017/18, due to both stronger 
agricultural sector performance and the ongoing reconstruction effort, which will also generate higher 
levels of investment and support domestic consumption94. Agriculture accounts for almost 1/3rd of 
GDP. Agricultural sector growth in FY2012 reached 4.6 per cent, but sector performance then fell to 
1.1 per cent in FY 2013 due to a combination of weak monsoons, inadequate supply of agricultural 
inputs during the peak planting seasons, rose slightly to 2.9 per cent in 2014 in response to better 
monsoon rains, and back to 1.9 per cent in 2015 due to the earthquake disruption. Agriculture is 
expected to grow in 2017 on the back of average monsoon rainfall.  
  Reconstruction efforts will continue to dominate the policy agenda in 2017-18, as large parts of 
3.
the country and its infrastructure were devastated by the 2015 earthquakes. Foreign governments and 
multilateral institutions pledged strong financial and technical support, but progress on reconstruction 
has been held back by political squabbling and a shortage of capacity and skills within the 
bureaucracy. 
  Strong consumption growth rather than investment is driving economic activities, with both public 
4.
and private investment weak in 2016, with private sector investment particularly constrained by the 
high level of policy uncertainty. Private sector investment is expected to improve in 2017 and several 
large infrastructure Programmes are likely to accelerate economic growth in coming years95. Despite 
the timely approval of the budget, key capital Programmes have not moved as anticipated, 
demonstrating shortcomings in preparation and implementation that affect the broader capital 
Programme portfolio of the government. Owing to high spending pressures, the budget will remain in 
deficit in fiscal years 2016/17 and 2017/18 (July 16th-July 15th). However, improving revenue 
collection will keep the budget shortfall at a manageable level. Consumer prices will rise by an 
average of 8.4 per cent a year in 2017-18, as food price pressures will remain high. Supply 
disruptions, owing to the country's poor road infrastructure and the impact of the 2015 earthquakes, 
will continue to put upward pressure on prices. Import price inflation will also be strong in the forecast 
period.

government  for  implementing  activities  in  post-conflict  situations  and  that,  while  it  was  almost 
exclusively  using  government  institutions  as  implementing  agents,  it  failed  to  include  provisions  to 
strengthen their capacities  and  address general disillusionment with the State as a service provider. 
The  CPE  also  found  that  Programmes  were  widely  spread  thematically  and  geographically,  which 
resulted  in  management  and  governance  challenges,  particularly  given  the  weak  government 
institutions  that  contributed  to  slow  implementation  and  disbursement.  Finally,  the  CPE  found  that 
there was a disconnect between the COSOP and the Programmes, and that Programme teams were 
not aware of COSOP  objectives,  did not report  on them and did  not  abide  by  the recommendations 
issued by annual COSOP reviews.  
6.
Programme  efficiency  was  assessed  as  moderately  satisfactory,  with  good  quantitative 
achievements,  particularly  with  regard  to  community-based  social  and  economic  infrastructure.  The 
main  problem  areas  related  to  a  lack  of  sustainability  of  “beneficiary  groups”,  which  had  limited 
incentives  for  continuing  beyond  Programme  completion,  and  of  most  of  the  rural  finance  schemes, 
which focused on savings and credit groups that never reached sufficient maturity. Recently approved 
Programmes were considered to have better chances of success, thanks to their focus on developing 
commercially  viable  groups.  Overall,  the  CPE  noted  that  the  programme  had  made  only  a  modest 
contribution  to  poverty  reduction,  mainly  due  to  the  lack  of  sustainability  of  most  Programmes’ 
achievements. 
Experiences and lessons learned.

IFAD’s  Country  Programme  has  built  and  demonstrated 
its strengthens and competences in a number of thematic  and geographic areas, where successes of 
implementation  were  recognized  as  climate-smart,  including:  (i) community-driven  leasehold  forestry 
management; (ii) community-level infrastructures and facilities for drought and flood risk management; 
(iii) direct  support  to  household  assets  building;  (iv) sustainable  nature  resources  management; 
(v) adoption  of  crop  varieties  and  crop-livestock  systems;

8.
.  Key  lessons  derived  from  the  CPE,  annual  COSOP  reviews,  the  country  programme 
management team (CPMT) and local consultations held during preparation of the new COSOP point 
to the following issues: 
 
 
 
 
 
New Programmes should include measures to strengthen local government capacities to 
provide  responsive  and  inclusive  services  to  the  rural  population,  which  will  improve 
Programme performance and contribute to peace consolidation by restoring public trust 
in government institutions; 
Building  on  past  successful  examples,  new  Programmes  should  build  more  on 
partnerships with non-governmental players, including NGOs and the private sector; 
Grass-roots groups are not sustainable when created for the sole purpose of channelling 
Programme  services.  They  need  to  establish  clear  objectives,  build  their  capacity  to 
achieve  these  objectives  autonomously,  and  develop  networking  in  order  to  obtain 
continued access to services once the Programme is over; 
Migration  of  men  places  additional  demands  on  women.  This  must  be  reflected  in  the 
organization  of  support  services  and  Programme  activities,  which  must  be  compatible

Monitoring  and  evaluation  (M&E)  should  become  a  management  tool  that  assesses 
Programme  outcomes  within  communities  and  groups,  and  between  genders  and 
different social groups; detects successes and shortcomings; and facilitates the adoption 
of  solutions  to  improve  performance.  It  needs  to  be  complemented  by  knowledge 
management to track innovative practices, fuel policy dialogue and support scaling up;

Programme management is affected by the unsustainable turnover of civil servants, who 
compose Programme teams exclusively. Mixed teams composed of hired staff supporting 
civil servants will be an effective solution.

The  opinion  was  also  expressed  among  stakeholders  and  beneficiary  representatives  that 
complex  design  should  be  avoided  in  order  to  ensure  better  effectiveness  and  efficiency  of 
implementation, especially in the context of continued political uncertainties and changing institutional 
dynamics under reform. Institutional support to  the sector-mandated technical agencies needs to be 
further  strengthened  in  order  to  support  and  help  turn  the  country’s  administrative-style  support 
system into a service-centred one.  
  More  contemporarily,  the  Programme  design  mission  explored  lessons  learned  from  the  on-
10.
going portfolio of value chain-focused Programmes in Nepal96. They include: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Programme-supported value chain development should be preceded by detailed value 
chain analysis and strategic investment planning validated through participatory multi-
stakeholder platforms;  
agriculture value chain development should be led by the private sector, namely by key 
“gatekeepers” to customer access, typically private agribusinesses and supermarkets, 
not government agencies; 
incentive payments for business-oriented behavioural change at industry and producer 
levels should be designed and priced to mitigate associate risk and not serve as a credit 
substitute;  
once a desired behavioural change has been profitably demonstrated in an agro-
ecological zone, and financial markets developed, value chain financing should be 
supplied through financial markets; 
initial value chain development is typically driven by middle income farmers who can 
more easily meet the market requirements in terms of quality and quantity of products, 
but often draws in poor household once perceived risks have been mollified and 
transaction costs reduced; 
inequalities are embedded in the rural society and are difficult to level. Marginalised 
people’s role in decision making is still secondary to prominent people (community and 
group leaders) who communicate and respond positively to development interventions 
and embrace economic opportunities; 
farmer groups and agribusinesses are willing to pay for quality services as a part of a 
viable business plan;  
market-linked infrastructure development is an integral part of inclusive value chain 
establishment and growth promotion, but must be well designed, sustainable and climate 
adapted; and  
rural financial services institutions (Banks, MFIs, co-operatives etc.) need capacity 
building, risk management strategies and more diversified loan products to adequately 
service agriculture value chain financing.

Appendix 4:  Detailed Programme description 
The Programme will be implemented in Surkhet, Dailekh, Salyan, Jajarkot, Kalikot, Jumla, 
1. 
Mugu, Dolpa, Humla and Rukum (Western) districts in State 6 of Nepal. The four highlighted districts 
are incremental to the HVAP area and will be integrated into the Programme in line with the 
development of the (i) Chhinchu-Jajarkot–Dolpa; (ii) Surkhet-Kalikot-Jumla-Mugu; (iii) Surkhet- 
Dailekh road corridors; and (iv) Mid-hill highway. The programme will commence immediately in the 
six existing HVAP districts and in Mugu and Rukum. Sub-component 4 activities will commence in 
Dolpa and Humla initially, with further inclusion on other activies as the road access improves. The 
PCO will be based at Birendranagar in Surkhet district, while three corridor-based coordination units 
(work along the Mid-hills highway corridor will be shared) will be established for technical 
backstopping, field level coordination and programme monitoring and supervision (See Appendix 2, 
Annex 3). 
The Programme will target smallholder producers and landless rural people (value chain labour, 
2. 
small livestock, etc.) interested to engage in targeted value chain activities. HVAP experience 
indicates that this is a very inclusive process with most households in HVAP-supported hamlets and 
villages progressively participating in value-chain linked production and processing activities. Women 
will form 2/3rds of the Programme beneficiaries and disadvantaged households including Dalits, 
Janajatis, Muslims, youth, landless and other disadvantaged groups will be specifically targeted for 
Programme inclusion (25 per cent target). The Programme will develop specific mechanisms for poor 
households to be able to join appropriate value chains, however, poor and marginalised households 
will also benefit from expanding local agriculture employment opportunities associated with value 
chain-driven growth. It is expected that the ASDP will serve around 35,000 direct beneficiaries 
(producers households and agri-industry entrepreneurs and employees) and around 40,000 indirect 
household beneficiaries (through public infrastructure, financial services and agricultural services 
development). 
Development objective and impact indicators 
The Goal of the Programme is to: To contribute to the achievement of Nepal’s SDG 197 and 
3. 
SDG 298 targets by reducing poverty and nutrition insecurity amongst women and men in hill and 
mountain areas of State 6. The indicator of Programme success at goal level is:  
 
24,000 more women in Programme area of 15-49 years of age, consume at least five (5 ) 
out of 10 defined food groups daily (disaggregated by ethnicity). 
The Development Objective (DO) is to: contribute to the achievement of Nepal’s SDG 899 
4. 
target through sustainable improvement in the income and food security of smallholders and 
disadvantaged rural groups100 involved in commercially-oriented production and marketing systems in 
selected high value agricultural value chains. The indicators of Programme success at DO level are: 
 
 
Reduction in poverty incidence amongst 35,000 Programme households (measured as a 
lower HFIAS101 score (disaggregated by gender and disadvantaged group);

Appendix 4:  Detailed programme description 
Programme Components 
Component 1, Value chain Development, will include four Sub-components: (i) Inclusive and 
6. 
sustainable agriculture value chains expanded and diversified; (ii) Market-oriented infrastructure 
functional; (iii) Rural financial services for value chain development strengthened; and (iv) Agriculture 
services sustainably support innovation and value chain development. Component 2, Programme 
coordination, will have a single outcome: Stakeholders manage Programme outcomes creatively, 
efficiently and effectively. 
Sub-component 1: Inclusive and sustainable agriculture value chains expanded and 
diversified 
This sub-component (outcome) will identify financially and economically profitable agricultural 
7. 
value chain investment opportunities in the Programme area and provide risk-based co-financing and 
institutional, technical and capacity building support to strengthen value chain cohesion and 
stakeholder profits. The indicator of successful Programme intervention is: 
 
Amount of agribusiness and household investment leveraged by ASDP co-financing 
(USD million) (disaggregated by male and female-headed households and ethnicity). 
This outcome will include two outputs: (i) Strategic Investment Plans prepared; and 
8. 
(ii) Agricultural value chain development co-financed: 
Output 1.1: Strategic Investment Plans prepared. This output includes two activities: 
9. 
(i) Strategic investment plan (SIP); and (ii) DCC-convened Multi-Stakeholders Consultative 
Platform102: 
o  Strategic investment plan: To identify profitable, climate change adapted value chain 
development pathways, the Programme will conduct a comprehensive financial, economic 
and value chain analysis of both existing (to confirm their continuing financial and economic 
viability) and potentially new value chains and associated wholesale markets covering both 
additional products in the existing HVAP districts and key agricultural products in the new 
Programme districts. As part of this analysis, constraints to private sector investment in the 
region will be assessed with a view to improving competitiveness and the environment for 
doing business. For each selected commodity, a SIP will be prepared, including all potential 
activities within the value chains inherent in that commodity segment. In addition to the six 
(6) economically and financially viable value chains established under the HVAP103, the SIP 
will also evaluate, inter alia, milk, citrus fruit, walnut, seed potato, honey and high nutrition 
crop (grain legume, finger millet, buckwheat etc.) value chains. The SIP process will involve 
seven (7) steps (See Appendix 4, Annex 1 for ToRs): 
  background research on the chosen commodity/crop by reviewing websites and other 
secondary sources of information concerning the commodities provincial and national 
importance, environmental requirements, role in household economies, end-markets, 
etc. This will be followed by primary research in the province/municipalities through 
interviews, focus groups, surveys and observation involving value chain actors (farm 
households, processors, input suppliers, advisors etc.); 
 
identify the preliminary MSP stakeholders for the value chains being tested in the 
Programme area and initiate MSP meetings;   
  using the aforementioned information, and with MSP support, map the 
commodity/crop sectors in State 6 municipalities. Value chain mapping enables the 
visualization of the product flow and value addition from conception to end consumer 
103 apple, ginger, goats, off-season vegetables, timur and turmeric 
89

through various actors, as well as the supporting markets and enabling environment 
affecting the value chain; 
  prepare, with MSP support, a table listing the structural and dynamic factors in the 
value chain including identifying a scaling up strategy, and briefly describe the current 
situation, opportunities, constraints and recommendations for addressing those 
constraints including tangible How, Who and Financing; 
 
identifying supporting rural public and collective infrastructure and financial, technical 
and social services required to underpin specific value chain development and ensure 
their integration into Programme outcomes 2-4; 
  prepare a financial and economic analysis of each key value chains detailing the 
estimated potential incremental benefits from investment in their development, 
including, inter alia, rates of return on investment, increased household income, 
number and type of household benefiting; job creation; increased export; import 
substitution, etc.; 
 
in partnership with the respective MSPs, conduct workshops bringing to vet the 
findings of the analysis and discuss if the chosen strategy for increasing value chain 
competitiveness is valid. 
10.  The SIPs will include a robust gender analysis. This will help in understanding the distribution of 
labour and workloads of women within the given value chain and help in identifying corrective action. 
Women who will be working on the construction site will be provided with social safeguards to prevent 
any harassment. The GESI Specialist will be responsible for drawing up a guideline for the women in 
construction. The Programme will ensure equal pay for equal work to both women and men. 
11.  As part of the SIP analysis, the supporting consultants will assess constraints to private sector 
investment in State 6, with a view to improving provincial competitiveness and the environment for 
doing business. They will particularly focus on factors affecting business entry including registration 
time, cost and restrictions as well as assessing the adequacy of provincial incentives and business 
support services. The experience of agri-businesses supported through the HVAP in dealing with local 
administrations will inform this discussion, while new ASDP agri-business investments will be 
monitored to measure changes in benchmarked state-level indicator performance. 
o  DCC-convened Multi-Stakeholders Consultative Platform. The strength of a value chain is 
largely determined by a shared vision and effective communication between the value chain 
stakeholders. The Programme will facilitate the establishment of MSPs to support the 
development of specific value chains. MSPs will also inform the SIP process.  MSPs will 
bring together the key stakeholders, including farmer representatives, private sector actors 
(traders, processors, input suppliers, investors, finance institutions) and government actors 
(municipal governance, research, extension) engaged in the development of specific value 
chains, with a view to strengthening private and public-private relationships across the value 
chains, promoting innovation and providing a conducive environment/space for the 
brokerage of financial agreements between value chain stakeholders. While initially 
convened by the ASDP’s MSP Coordination Unit, MSPs will be assisted to become self-
governing and to align with State-level and Municipal institutions as they establish. 
12.  Output 1.2: Market-oriented infrastructure functional. This output would include three activities: 
(i) co-investment investment both on farm and at agribusiness level; (ii) value chain-led participatory 
and applied production and processing technology development; and (iii) tailored multi-disciplinary 
capacity building. 
13.  Co-investment both on-farm and at agribusiness level. The Programme would establish a 
competitively allocated Value Chain Development Mechanism (VCDM) providing risk-based co-
financing to catalyse private investments by agri-enterprises and farm households into the SIP-
prioritised value chains and associated wholesale markets, with particular attention paid to the 
90 
Nepal 
Agriculture Sector Development Programme 
Final programme design report 
Appendix 4:  Detailed programme description 
inclusion of poor, disadvantaged and women-headed households in the value chain catchment area. 
The priorities for the investment agenda in each value chain would be driven by the private value 
chain actors via the ongoing brokerage and facilitation process organized around the MSP for each 
value chain. The level of co-investment would vary by location and purpose, priced to reflect the 
measured risk to the "innovator" investors, but not set at levels that are likely to distort markets. Once 
“innovator” co-investments are proven to be commercially viable, both in hilly and mountainous 
environments, direct incentive co-investments for that value chain segment would be phased out, 
subject to improved access to rural financial services. The percentage of co-investment offered and 
other terms would be actively monitored and revised if necessary based on actual uptake.  
14.  The competitive co-investment allocation process would reward enterprise and farmer group 
business proposals that offer higher levels of own contribution, better value addition and greater 
engagement of disadvantaged people. 
15.  The Programme would also facilitate “innovator” investor access to financial services, through 
support to business plan development and through the development of innovative finance and 
insurance products in partnership with private banks, co-operatives, MFIs and insurance companies 
(see Sub-component 3). The VCDM, together with all the other Programme instruments, would 
strengthen the credit worthiness of agribusinesses and farmers’ groups linked to ASDP-supported 
value chains. Value chain actors would become more creditworthy clients through improved business 
planning capacities, reduced collateral pressure, participation in profitable value chains, improved 
infrastructure, and overall reduced risk to their production and processing activities, with subsequently 
reduced risks for private financial institutions (PFIs). 
16.  The VCDM will co-finance (a) agribusinesses104 and (b) farmer producer groups. The 
identification of potential agribusiness investors or “gate keepers” is crucial for the sustainable 
development of value chains. The selection of gate keepers with proven technical and financial 
competencies and market performance for specified value chains provides the foundation for 
contractual arrangements with producers. 
17.  Groups and the competitive marketing of value added products. A two-stage approach will be 
adopted in inviting the proposals. As a first step, based on SIP and MSP’s identification of potential 
agri-businesses, (gate keepers) proposals will be invited from them clearly identifying the 
municipalities these businesses will be catering to. Once these are sanctioned, as a next step, 
proposals from farmer groups will be invited from the select municipalities.  
o  Window  1:  Agri-business  co-financing.  The  ASDP  would  generate  at 
least 
USD 5.5 million (including USD 1.7 million of ASDP co-financing and USD 3.8 million 
of  beneficiary  financing)  for  agri-business  financing.  VCDM  supported  agri-business 
investment must be within State 6. 
o  The aim of the VCDM co-financing instrument is to leverage investment in agricultural 
commodity  production  and  processing  in  rural  areas,  initiating  a  process  of  value 
addition by both primary producers and processers. This approach to promoting agri-
business  investment  in  rural  areas  is  consistent  with  prevailing  donor  and  GoN 
agriculture  development  programmes  in  Nepal,  but  uses  a  more  risk-calibrated 
approach  to  co-financing  agri-business  investment  in  public  and  private  goods  and 
staff  and  supplier  capacity  building,  with  the  allocation  of  co-financing  set,  within 
defined  limits,  by  the  investor.    This  approach  simplifies  co-financing  management 
and  has  proven  successful  in  other  IFAD  investment  Programmes  in  Nepal  and  the 
region.  The  Programme  would  work  closely  with  State  and  municipal  authorities  to 
align VCDM co-financing with other GoN support for value chain-driven agri-business 
development (e.g. the Prime Minister’s Agriculture Modernization Programme, USAID 
KISAN II, etc.).  
104 Legally registered cooperative societies and companies of at least 12 months standing would be eligible to apply for VCDF agri-business co-
financing. Entities that are the subject of bankruptcy, criminal investigation, fraud or corruption or are in default of contractual agreements would 
be ineligible. 
91

Agriculture Sector Development Programme 
Final programme design report 
Appendix 4:  Detailed Programme description 
o  The Programme would co-finance investments that generate incremental markets and 
value  addition  for  raw  material,  leading  to  incremental  production  and  increased 
income  and  job  opportunities  among  rural  households,  including  poor  households. 
VCDM  applications  with  higher  levels  of  own  contribution  (including  through  bank 
financing  or  with  a  loan  guarantee)  would  be  assessed  as  more  competitive.  The 
Programme, through the SIP process detailed in Output 1, would identify commodities 
and associated value chains that have investment potential and are aligned with GoN 
development  priorities.  The  selected  commodities/value  chains  would  be  chosen 
based  on  their  having:  (i) significant  potential  for  involving  rural  households, 
particularly  disadvantaged  households,  in  incremental  production  and  job  creation; 
(ii) available  technologies  for  improved  productivity;  (iii) reasonably  assured  national 
or  regional  markets;  and  (iv) potential  for  export  and/or  import  substitution.  At  least 
50 per  cent  of  the  total  number  of  households  benefiting  from  VCDM  supported 
investments should be represented by poor, near poor or women-headed households. 
o  The VCDM would be underpinned by a technical, business and financial management 
and  Information  Communication  Technology  (ICT)  capacity  building  program  for 
participating  agri-business  managers  with  a  view  to  improving  their  farmer  service 
capacity, profitability and enterprise linkages, both at the local level and to upstream 
quality  suppliers  and  markets.  The  business/financial  management  training  would 
include,  inter  alia,  setting  measurable  goals,  developing  business  plans,  identifying 
markets  and  competitors  and  setting  marketing  strategies  and  plans,  financing  your 
business, financial analysis, keeping accounts and managing people. One two-week 
course would be run annually by an experienced business trainer. 
the  remaining 
investment,  with 
o  The VCDM facility would co-financing of up to 30 per cent of total investment cost of 
an  approved  agri-business 
investment  being 
contributed  by  the  benefitting  business.  Up  to  20 per  cent  of  VCDM  co-financing 
would  be  available  for  the  purchase  of  supporting  services  (business  development 
services (BDS), legal, technical, marketing, standards, farmer extension, etc.) for the 
planned  value  chain  investment.  Co-financing  would  start  at  USD 15,000  as  a 
minimum and reach up to USD 100,000 as the maximum. For agri service providers 
such as agro vets, VAHWs, VAW the minimum would be set at USD 1,500 including 
demonstration.  In  the  case  of  production  of  new  commodities,  the  PCO  could 
determine  that  trial  production  could  be  financed  at  a  smaller  amount  than 
USD 15,000,  but  otherwise  follow  the  same  requirement  as  the  mainstream  VCDM 
investments. In cases where the potential export/import substitution and social impact 
of  the  proposed  Programme  is  extremely  high  and/  or  the  investment  is  pivotal  for 
developing  the  respective  commodity  in  the  province,  the  maximum  VCDM  co-
financing could, with IFAD approval, be up to 250 per cent of the aforementioned cap.  
o  In-kind contribution. The contribution from the enterprise in-kind cannot exceed 50 per 
cent  of  total  enterprise  contribution  (i.e.  50 per  cent  of  70 per  cent).  The  in-kind 
contribution must be supported by appropriated documentation stating its value based 
on  market  evaluation  undertaken  by  an  independent  authorized  entirety.  The 
minimum  35 per  cent  (of  total  investment)  enterprise  cash/credit  contribution  for 
VCDM  co-financed  investments  must  be  deposited  into  a  designated  co-financing 
account  held  by  the  lead  enterprise  (LE)  and  be  accounted  for  separately  in  their 
books of accounts. The cash contribution cannot be reduced over the duration of the 
VCDM co-financing period, however, the  enterprise can expand this level  using  own 
resources  or  other  (equity  and  debt)  funding.  In-kind  contribution  may  include: 
equipment,  vehicles,  building  and  other  capital  goods  and/  or  raw  materials 
contributed to build up/ acquire such goods during the agreed sub-project timeframe. 
o  The in-kind contribution must be supported by appropriated documentation stating its 
value.  The  documentation  must  be  based  on  market  evaluation  undertaken  by  an 
independent  authorized  entity  who  would  be  hired  by  the  PCO  to  undertake  the

be  accepted  if  procured/user-rights  have  been  obtained  within  12 months  from  the 
time of submitting the concept note. 
o  The VCDM would not accept the following assets neither as the LE’s contribution nor 
as expenditures eligible for reimbursement: 


o  The  VCDM  would  separate  investment  items  into  Public  Orientation  (PO)  and 
Company Orientation (CO). The VCDM beneficiary can utilise a maximum 20 per cent 
of  its  total  co-financing  for  PO  investments.  There  is  no  limitation  for  the  LE’s  own 
funding  of  PO  activities.  The  PO  investments  are  those  directly  related  to  the 
suppliers  of  raw  material  and  capacity  building  of  rural  households  and  LE’s 
employees including: 
 
 
 
 
documented Technical Advisory Service to rural households and training of rural 
households; 
documented training of LE personnel  
documented provision of production credit in cash or in kind; 
documented joint (LF and rural households) investment in intermediary produce 
collection and processing centres. 
o  A  total  of  80 per  cent  of  VCDM  co-financing  should  be  for  CO  investments.  CO 
investments are capital tied up in plant, equipment, rolling stock related directly to the 
core activity of the LE including:  
 
 
 
 
 
civil works related to storage and processing of raw material; 
processing and packaging equipment;   
transportation  related  to  collection  of  raw  material  from  smallholder  producers 
and shipment of finished product; 
equipment for energy generation for processing plant;  
equipment related to environmental mitigation. 
o  The  investment  supported  by  the  VCDM  shall  assist  a  minimum  of  one  (1)  rural 
household per USD 500 of co-financing (e.g. total VCDM co-financing of USD 50,000 
should provide direct tangible benefits to a minimum of 100 rural households including 
35 disadvantaged households). The direct tangible benefit should be in the form of: 
 
 
 
 
rural household sale of raw material to the LE; 
rural household receiving training and advisory service; 
rural household receiving production credit; 
rural  households  receiving  tools,  equipment’s  as  plastic  crates,  plastic  dokos 
(baskets),  potato  grading  machine,  semi-processing  drums,  gloves  and  others 
(this may be cost shared with the LE in some situations);

Expression of Interest.  The Programme will call for Expressions of Interest (EoI) from 
potential agribusiness /traders/co-operatives interested to work in increasing their supply 
base  and  value  addition  of  the  selected  value  chains  through  improved  marketing 
practices,  establishment  of  processing  units,  etc.  as  identified  in  the  relevant  Strategic 
Investment  Plan  (SIP).  This  is  done  through  advertisements  in  regional,  national  and 
local  newspaper  and  on  district  FM  radio  and  promotion  through  national  commodity 
associations  as  well  as  district  and  federal  chambers  of  commerce  and  industries.  As 
part of the MSP process, the Programme will share information on areas and scale of co-
investment  including  funding  modalities,  and  also  collect  basic  information  of  potential

sub-project in line with the milestones agreed in the contract.  The fund will be released 
from ASDP  as  per  milestones  detailed  in  the  contract.  The  agri-business  will  maintain 
separate  books  of  accounts  for  the  approved  co-investment.  The  ownership  of  assets 
created  under  co-financing  will  that  be  of  the  agri-business. The  responsibility  of  repair 
and  maintenance  of  assets  will  be  that  of  agri-business.  The  agri-business  will  provide 
interim reports on physical and financial progress and final report after completion of co-
investment activities.  
Window  2  -  Farmer  group  investment  co-financing.    The  ASDP  would  provide 
approximately  USD 12.50 million 
farmer 
group/cooperative  value  chain  participation  co-financing.  An  additional  USD 8.2 million 
would  be  available  for  community-based  infrastructure  development.  VCDM  supported 
groups must be within State 6. 
(including  beneficiary  co-financing) 
for 
Farmer  groups  and  eligible  co-operatives  would  be  entitled  to  apply  for  competitively 
allocated,  market-oriented,  value  chain-linked  co-financing  supporting  both  (i) the 
alignment of their agriculture production systems with emerging value chains; and (ii) the 
adoption of climate adapted technologies and practices.  The selection of farmer groups 
and co-operatives to be supported through farmer group financing should be based on a 
competitive  mechanism  in  Wards  identified  as  having  the  potential  to  supply  profitable, 
SIP-identified value chains.  
Eligible investments- Farmer group/cooperatiove co-financing could cover (i) initial capital 
investment  costs,  (ii) upgraded  farming 
inputs  through  revolving  working  capital 
mechanisms,  and/or  (iii) required  technical  assistance.  Co-financing  would  focus  on 
innovative  production,  climate  change  adaptation,  risk  reduction  or  value  addition 
investments.  This  could  include  investment  in,  inter  alia:  afforestation,  climate-resistant 
crop  varieties  and  management  systems,  forage  production,  improved  genetics, 
irrigation106  (both  household  level  as  well  as  group  level),  biogas  and  other  by-product 
utilization,  including  bio-fertilisers,  minimum  tillage  and  organic  agriculture.  Tools  and 
equipment  for  improved  farming  practices  will  be  included.  For  livestock  rearing,  the 
eligible  investments  will  include,  breed  improving  bucks,  veterinary  support  services, 
livestock  equipment,  milk  cooling  tanks,  etc.  The  female  animals  (does,  cows  and 
buffaloes)  will  be  purchased  out  of  loans  from  financial  institutions  or  from  own  funds. 
The  establishment  of  a  sufficient,  designated  forage  field  will  be  a  pre-condition  for  the 
release  of  approved  livestock  co-financing. The  Programme  will  facilitate  low  cost  shed 
construction by members of goat and dairy value chain members by making available the 
plans for the same.  
Membership  -  The  Programme  would  support  both  gender  specific  and  gender 
disaggregated farmer groups and co-operatives. To be eligible for the ASDP competitive 
co-financing,  the  membership  of  farmer’s  groups  must,  in  aggregate  at  Ward  level, 
include  (i) at  least  60 per  cent  of  members  from  poor  and  near  poor  households;  (ii) at 
least 60 per cent female members; and (iii) at least 35% disadvantaged households. All 
VCDM-supported sub-projects, managed and owned by the farmer group or cooperative, 
must  demonstrate  sustainability  beyond  the  initial  ASDP  assistance  and  be  linked  to 
VCDM  co-financed  value  chain  development  as  detailed  above. All  participating  farmer 
groups/co-operatives  would  receive  training  in  group  formation,  participation  and 
governance as required.  
The maximum farmer group co-financing investment will be USD 350 per group member 
and  USD 10,000  per  farmer  group/cooperative  in  the  mid-hills  and  USD 400  per  group 
member  and  USD 12,000  per  farmer  group/cooperative  in  mountainous  municipalities. 
The  co-financing  investment  would  cover  up  to  50 per  cent  of  the  total  cost  of  each

investment, with beneficiaries financing at least 50 per cent including a minimum 25 per 
cent  in  cash  and  the  balance  in  kind.  This  limit  of  USD 10,000/USD 12,000  is  for 
production  costs  and  tools  and  equipment.  Groups  requiring  irrigation  (OSV,  apple, 
walnut, potato, ginger, turmeric etc.,) both at household and group level will have access 
to  an  additional  grant  of  USD 20,000  per  group  with  community  contribution  of 
additional15%.  These  funds  will  be  released  by  the  PCO  from  the  Sub-component 2 
(community infrastructure) budgets.  
The  25 per  cent  cash  contribution  by  group  members  is  important  to  ensure  the 
commitment  to  and  ownership  of  the  investment  by  group  beneficiaries.  The  members 
will  borrow  from  their  co-operatives/MFIs  for  financing  their  cash  contribution.  Where 
feasible,  the  whole  group  will  be  linked  to  a  financial  institution  for  the  financing  of  the 
proposal. The  Programme will  facilitate  such  linkages.  Local  MFIs  have  the  capacity  to 
finance the cash contribution, if required. The project will be supporting co-operatives to 
access  larger  finance  from  banking  institutions  for  on-lending  to  members.  The 
Programme would help reduce barriers to male and female farmer access to finance by: 
(i) reducing collateral pressure through co-financing and development of alternative loan 
securities; (ii) assisting farmer groups and co-operatives to improve business plan quality 
as  per  financiers'  requirements;  (iii) building  MFI  and  commercial  bank  agriculture 
lending capacities; and (iv) supporting the development of more diversified, value chain-
linked financial products (see Sub-component 3). 
For  very  poor  members  who  wish  to  join  groups,  the  co-financing  can,  based  on 
agreements  reached  by  the  group  or  cooperative,  be  increased  to  up  to  60%,  with  at 
least  5%  contribution  in  cash  by  such  members  and  the  rest  in  kind.  The  very  poor 
members  will  be  identified  by  the  community  themselves  applying  Participatory  Rural 
Approach (PRA) tools.  
Availing technical support services. Up to 20 per cent of each grant could be used by the 
group/cooperative  for  the  procurement  of  technical  support  services,  including  LRP 
support,  coordinated  by  Ward  CAESCs.  All  such  service  provision  would  be  through 
standardized,  output  based  contracts  between 
the 
group/cooprtaive. LRPs would be certified under an ASDP developed and GoN managed 
training  and  certification  scheme,  providing  both  technical  and  pedagogic  skills.  The 
Programme would also provide business literacy and entrepreneurship training to group 
members,  participation  in  which  would  be  a  condition  of  Programme  support  to  their 
respective groups. 
the  service  provider  and 
Financial flows for farmer group co-financing. In accordance with current MoF decisions, 
the  Project  Coordination  Office  (PCO)  would  be  the  “Cost  Centre”  for  disbursement  of 
funds  to  beneficiaries  and/or  implementing  agencies.  The  Programme  will  revise  its 
disbursement  strategies  in  accordance  with  prevailing  GoN  regulations,  including 
devolution  of  conditional  funding  for  activities  implemented  by  the  municipality,  on 
completion of a fiduciary due diligence of the municipality as a cost center.  
The  approval  of  ASDP  Investment  Plans  (IPs)  by  Local  Body  (Municipal)  Executives 
would  be  based  on  the  recommendations  of  the  Municipal  Agriculture  Unit  (MAU)  in 
response  to  competitive  farmer  group  IPs  that  have  undergone  a  bipartisan  Field 
Verification  by  the  Ward-level  Community  Agriculture  Extension  Service  Centres 
(CAESCs)  and  PCO/HSI  technical/administration  teams107.  Once  Ward-level  IPs  have 
been prioritised and approved by the MAU in accordance with the budget limits set by the 
PCO,  that  Unit  would  forward  the  IPs  to  the  Local  Body  (Municipal)  Executive  for  no-
objection  and  subsequent  request  to  the  ASDP  Project  Coordinator  (PC)  for  financing. 
The  IPs  would  be  included  in  the  ASDP  results-based  annual  work  programme  and

budget (RB-AWPB), and, the PCO  would  prepare a  quadripartite contract (Municipality, 
Ward,  beneficiary  and  PCO)  on  which  basis  the  PC  would  release  ASDP  funds  to 
contract-identified beneficiaries. 
Implementation  process  for  VCDM  financing  of  Groups  and  Co-operatives:  The  overall 
responsibility of the farmer group/co-operaive competitive co-financing operations under 
ASDP  would  be  with  the  Community Agriculture  Extension  Services  Centre  (CAESCs) 
and Municipality Agriculture Unit (MAU). These institutions would be assisted by the HSI 
technical  team  and  associated  Social  Mobilisers,  the  ASDP  road  corridor  technical 
support  teams  and  the  PCO  technical  experts.  The  Project  Coordinator  would  be 
responsible for the overall leadership and coordination. .  
Strategic Investment Plan (SIP) endorsed by Multi-Stakeholder Platforms (MSPs)108 for a 
specific  commodity  would  list  the  Wards  and  Local  Bodies  eligible  for  ASDP  support 
based  on  viability  criteria.  Based  on  the  endorsed  SIP,  the  PCO  will,  on  a  competitive 
basis, select Lead Entrepreneurs (LE) or Value Chain Gate Keepers for co-financing for 
specific commodity VCs. Once the eligible Wards/Local Bodies and LEs are known for a 
specific  commodity  VC,  the  process  of  selecting  Groups/Co-operatives  for  competitive 
co-financing  under ASDP  would  be  initiated. The  underlying  process  for  identifying  VC-
led IPs would be as follows: 
The  PCO  will  call  for  investment  proposals  (IPs)  from  farmer  groups/co-operatives 
through  local  and  national  newspapers,  local  FM  radio  and  notices  at  the  concerned 
Ward, Municipality  and DCC offices. The call for IPs  would specify the eligibility criteria 
and terms of financing. Municipalities would be informed through workshops facilitated by 
the HSI team, Social Mobilisers (SM) engaged by HSI/ Local Service Providers (LSP)109 
and the project teams about the provision for competitive co-financing of groups and co-
operatives  under  the  Programme,  the  eligibility  criteria  and  the  terms  of  financing.  The 
social mobilizers (SM) for the concerned Municipalities will give wide publicity regarding 
the  call  for  proposals  to  groups,  co-operatives,  CAESCs  and  MAUs.  Templates  for 
submission of IPs will be made available at the concerned Ward offices of the concerned 
Municipalities.  (See  Appendix 4,  Annex 2  for  sample  of  group  proposal  for  OSV  co-
financing). 
The  HSI  team,  Programme  road  corridor  mobile  teams,  business  development  service 
providers and SM will assist the interested groups and  co-operatives to prepare the IPs 
in  the  prescribed  templates,  including  requirements  for  community  infrastructure.  The 
proposals would be submitted to the mobile teams who would carry out a desk review of 
the  IPs  and  identify  IPs  for  field  verification110. A  team  under  the  aegis  of  the  CAESC, 
comprising  of  its  technical  staff,  mobile  team  member,  SM  and  a  representative  of  the 
proposed  private  financing  institution  (PFI)111  would  carry  out  the  field  verification  and 
shortlist viable IPs with necessary modifications in consultation with the proponents and 
send the same to the MAU through the Ward Chairperson. The MAU would review and 
prioritize  the  submitted  IPs  in  accordance  with  the  budget  limits  set  by  the  PCO  and 
recommend the selected IPs to the Chairperson/Mayor for approval and recommendation 
to the PCO for financing. 
The  PCO  would  include  the  recommended  IPs  in  its  Results-Based Annual  Work  Plan 
and Budget (RB-AWPB. Following budget approval, a quadripartite agreement would be 
108 Chairpersons/Mayors and their deputies from the concerned Local Bodies would participate in the MSP so that the selected commodity chains 
have their endorsement. 
109 The PCO and HSI will jointly recruit suitable LSPs to carry out the social mobilization and group/cooperative development activities under HSI 
guidance and supervision. These may be local NGOs. Where suitable LSPs are not available, HSI will directly recruit SMs, thereby assuming the 
role of the LSP. 
110 This responsibility may be transferred to the MAU (with support from the project team and HELETAS during the ASDP tenure) once it has been 
set up and adequately capacitated. 
111 The PFI would come into picture where the IP includes loans for financing a part of the investment.

signed between the Group/Cooperative, the Local Body (Municipality), Ward and PCO112 
and  filed  with  the  PCO  with  copies  to  the  other  three  signatories.  Funds  for  enterprise 
investment  would  then  be  released  by  the  PCO  out  of  the  VCDM,  as  per  an  agreed 
tranche  schedule,  to  the  bank  accounts  of  the  Group/Co-operative  for  disbursement  to 
the  members  with  information  to  the  Local  Body  (Municipality)  and  Ward.  This 
information is also shared with  lending institutions (Proposal Financing Institution  - PFI) 
and  LE  (where  relevant).  Where  included  in  an  IP,  funds  for  household  level  irrigation/ 
group  level  irrigation  will  be  released  by  the  PCO  directly  to  the  group/cooperative 
account out of the community infrastructure fund.  
The  CAESC,  the  Project’s  mobile  teams  and  SM  would,  under  HSI  guidance  provide 
implementation support to the Group/Cooperative and monitor implementation progress. 
The supported Group/Cooperative will furnish periodic reports to the PCO with copies to 
the  Ward  and  Local  Body  (Municipality)  as  per  the  contract.  Releases  of  further 
instalments, if any, would be made by the PCO on the recommendation of the CAESC. A 
project completion report will be filed by the Group/Cooperative to the PCO, Local Body 
(Municipality) and Ward once the planned investments have been completed. 
In  cases  in  which  a  group  or  its  members  do  not  follow  the  co-financing  contracts,  the 
funding to the group would stop immediately and the PCO, through the municipality/ward, 
would  request  the  repayment  of  all  co-financed  funds  issued  to  the  group.  In  the  event 
that a municipality/ward fails in their management and follow-up tasks in the competitive 
co-financing  scheme,  the  ASDP  management  would  stop  the  operations  with  the  co-
financing of farmer groups and co-operatives in that area and re-allocate the funds to the 
other, better performing municipalities/wards in the ASDP target area.  
While  the  aforementioned  principles  were  agreed  to  form  the  core  of  the  farmer  group 
competitive  co-financing  investment  procedure,  the  final  Operations  Manual,  including 
eligibility criteria and detailed co-financing processes, would be developed during 2017 to 
be ready when the actual implementation is expected to commence in early 2018. 
Expected  benefits.  The  household  income  benefits  from  farmer  group/co-operative  co-
financing are expected to be substantial. The number of directly benefiting households is 
expected,  when  calculated  at  an  average  co-financing  of  USD 10,000  equivalent  and 
average  group  size  of  30,  to  be  around  26,000 households,  assuming  a  75%  success 
rate.  Significant  flow-on  benefits  would  accrue  from  technology  demonstration  through 
innovative  farmer  group  co-investments.  As  many  of  the  on-farm  investments  are 
expected  to  follow  tested  methods  for  CC  adaptation,  the  benefits  for  each  household 
and community are expected to be long-lasting and sustainable. 
Exit  strategy  and  scaling-up.  Farmer  group  members  often  use  a  part  of  their  grant  to 
establish  a  revolving  element  to  finance  ongoing  working  capital  requirements  or 
additional lending rounds to the poorer group members. At the same time, if successfully 
implemented, farmer group grants, if not rotated, can have a major demonstration effect 
in their implementation areas, which are, typically, significantly impacted by both poverty 
and CC. This could encourage similar investments by other funding agencies, including 
the government. Importantly, the inclusion of the financial institutions in the scheme from 
the  beginning  aims  at  making  them  aware  of  investment  opportunities  of  this  type,  to 
finance innovative agricultural programmes also in the future, increasingly from their own 
funds. 
Value  chain-led  participatory  and  applied  technology  development.  The  design  mission 
has  identified  significant  technical  constraints  in  the  targeted  value  chains.  Programme 
112 Over time, as the financial management and reporting capabilities and communication infrastructure develop at the level of the Local Bodies, 
funds for the IPs included in their Annual Plans (approved IPs) may be transferred to them for release to concerned IP proponents with 
responsibility for M&E and audit.

co-financing  would  be  available  to  support  applied  and  participatory  research  and 
associated  technology  transfer,  including  farmer-to-famer  and  enterprise-to-farmer 
advisory  services,  to  address  technical  constraints  and  opportunities  mutually  identified 
by  value chain  actors through their  MSP.  Beneficiary enterprises and farmer groups/co-
operatives could apply up to 20% of their investment co-financing for participatory action 
research into identified production or processing constraints related to their value chain. 
The  VC  MSPs  will  also  have  access  to  additional  funding  for  participatory  action 
research.  The  Nepal  Agriculture  Research  Council  (NARC),  universities  and  technical 
institutes  would  be  pre-approved  to  compete  for  outcome-based  participatory  action 
research contracts. 
Tailored  multi-disciplinary  capacity  building.  The  Programme  would  provide  value  chain 
actors  with  specific  training  based  on  capacity  building  needs  identified  by  the  MSPs. 
This  could  include  in-field  and  residential  training  courses;  experiential  regional  study 
tours, etc. Members of farmer groups receiving “innovator” investment co-financing would 
be  required  to  initiate  business  literacy  training  before  the  release  of  the  co-financing 
funds.  Additional  entrepreneurship  training  would  also  be  available  to  agri-business 
managers and agriculture group members.

provide public goods and collective113 benefits essential to the successful development of targeted 
commodity value chain engagement and/or climate change adaptation (see Appendix 4, Annex 5 re. 
infrastructure climate proofing). Public or collective market-linked infrastructure investment schemes 
will be identified and prioritized through: (i) the SIP/MSP process; (ii) subsequent participatory

community planning; and (iii) their alignment with Municipality infrastructure plans. Investments could 
include, inter alia, village and farm access roads, commodity storage, ponds, small-scale irrigation 
and multi-purpose village water supply. As this is a demand driven process, there is the likelihood that 
communities, MSPs and SIPs will identify the need for other types of infrastructure that have not been 
anticipated here. The Programme will be structured to cater for innovative demands as they emerge. 
For public infrastructure (village roads, trails, markets, etc.) funds will be advanced to Municipalities by 
the PCO for municipalities to implement with Programme support. Collective goods infrastructure will 
be primarily built through community action unless their scale or complexity required contracting. All 
infrastructure investments will be climate change adaptive. In line with the Local Infrastructure 
Development Policy (LIDP) of the government, infrastructure development shall follow the following 
process: identification, selection, prioritisation, implementation, operation and maintenance. This 
process has been developed further by HSI for farmer managed irrigation systems development. The 
same approach, with modifications, will be used for all types of local infrastructure to be supported by 
the Programme.. 
19.  The identification of infrastructure sub-projects will be through the high value chain strategic 
investment plans (SIP) and approved by state/municipal authorities. The criteria for selection of 
transport infrastructure will include the criteria in Table 1.

appropriate. Local government and design engineers will determine the best mix of community labour 
and machinery, as allowed by law. The selection of irrigation and water supply development will occur 
in the high potential pockets/cluster areas and will depend on technical feasibility. Rehabilitation and 
upgrading of irrigation schemes will be prioritised depending on the: (i) number of beneficiaries; 
(ii) value of crops to be grown; (iii) number of disadvantaged communities benefitting; (iv) linkage with 
a commercial trader to buy the produce and (v) availability of road access. The process for selection 
and development of local infrastructure is summarised in Table 2. The detailed implementation 
arrangements will be developed in the Programme implementation manual.

This process may take as much as 1½ years to be completed. Detailed surveys for roads and irrigation Programmes need to be done in 
the driest periods – i.e. in the pre-monsoon months of mid-February to mid-May. 
21.  Co-financing of construction costs of public and collective good infrastructure works will be in 
accordance with the accompanying Table 3. Individual infrastructure investments exceeding 
USD 100,000 will require no-objection from IFAD. The Programme will, wherever practicable, use 
force account processes for community infrastructure investments, designed to create local jobs, 
while recognising that most major infrastructure investments will require some machine support. 
22.  Details of Potential Infrastructure and Technology Investments. The rural hill and mountain 
areas of Nepal are among the least developed in the country. Road and electricity connectivity are 
very low, with some village centres having neither road nor electricity access. Life for the poor is 
characterised by long hours of walking, carrying heavy loads. Women spend long hours fetching 
water and travelling to markets, or for other government services. Development of all-year-round 
transportation services and energy access can significantly improve the livelihood of rural 
communities.  
Local transport infrastructure links production areas to market centres, village roads, district 
23. 
roads or strategic road networks. The infrastructure will follow standards as stipulated in the Nepal 
Rural Roads Standards (2010). The Programme will develop transport links that have the least 
investment cost. All transport links should be built to consider a 10-year projected traffic volume. The 
design of the link will aim to achieve the lowest life cycle costing (cost/km), which will include: (i) the 
amortised cost of the investment for the link (new or rehabilitation); (ii) the annual maintenance cost; 
and (iii) any annual operation costs for that link.  
Local transport linkages are categorised into five classes based on the function of the link, 
24. 
traffic volume and type, and topography. The three that are relevant to the Programme include:  
 
District Road Class B (RRB) – linking Grade A market to grade C, linking grade B market 
to Grade C market, connecting Municipal/Ward (VDC) centres, linking Grade B or C 
market to SRN or LRN; connecting a place in a village (river ghat, mini-market, school, 
health post, residential area, forest, etc.) with a village centre or any other road link. 
Village roads are smaller and shorter than RRB roads. The ASDP will invest in RRB 
102 
Nepal 
Agriculture Sector Development Programme 
Final programme design report 
Appendix 4:  Detailed programme description 
roads and village roads that are less than 5km in length and justified with linkage to 
significant production clusters/pockets of targeted high value commodities. It is 
anticipated that the cost of development will be about USD 100,000/km; 
 
 
Rural Road Class C (RRC) – all major non-motorable foot/mule trails which connect a 
Municipal/Ward (VDC) centre with a district headquarters, SRN, DRCN, village road and 
other major location. This class will include trail bridges. The ASDP will invest in RRC 
infrastructure. It is anticipated that the cost of development will be about USD 700/meter 
for trail bridges; and  
Rural Road Class E (RRE) – In the high mountains where construction of trails is not 
feasible, rope ways shall be considered. The rope ways shall be mainly justifies based on 
socio-economic considerations but considering the amortised cost of construction, 
operation and maintenance. 
25.  The preferred approach is to have the infrastructure prioritised in line with the local government 
planning procedures, considering the main objectives of the Programme. 
26.  Under the ASDP, rural transport infrastructure will include motorised and non-motorised traffic 
focussing on RRB, village roads, RRC and RRE transport classes. All roads will fall under the 
jurisdiction of the local municipality, which will be responsible for managing their construction, with the 
support of the PCO-contracted infrastructure design and construction supervision team (See 
Appendix 4, Annex 3 H for detailed ToRs). Priority will be given to upgrading roads from fair weather 
access to all year access, whilst new roads may be included. All village roads to be upgraded or new 
development will be part of the district/municipality transport master plan. The municipality will make 
an undertaking to co-finance the construction and maintain the road after construction, as part of 
condition for selecting the road.  
27.  Trails and trail bridges will also be owned by the municipality and maintained jointly by the 
community and municipality. The municipality will co-finance the construction of the trail bridges and 
associated trails and the community will contribute towards the construction and maintenance of trails 
and trail bridges. 
28.  Road user committees will be formed for all village roads, trails and trail bridges. The 
committees will work together with the local government to ensure that maintenance is carried out for 
the infrastructure. 
29.  Water supply is a key constraint to development in the hill and mountain areas of Nepal. Over 
the years, the government has developed irrigation schemes with the assistance of donor 
organisations. The irrigation policy defines small-scale irrigation as less than 25 ha in mountain areas 
and 200 ha in the Terai. Small-scale irrigation is the responsibility of local government bodies. Larger 
irrigation schemes are the responsibility of the Department of Irrigation. 
30.  The ASDP will invest in new and old farmer managed small-scale irrigation systems. Existing 
small-scale systems will be rehabilitated and upgraded using modern technologies that promote water 
use efficiency and crop productivity. Drip irrigation, under solar, will be preferred where ever feasible. 
In all cases, irrigation development shall include improved domestic water supply systems for the 
community. The Programme will promote the use of water filtration systems that are appropriate for 
the areas to be selected for the supply of water for use at households. Supply of potable water, 
alongside irrigation water, will be a Programme objective in areas with no domestic water supply. 
31.  Marketing and Collection centres. Small towns in rural Nepal act as service centres providing 
for places to market excess farm produce. Local government authorities and the Department of 
Marketing facilitate the development of markets. The markets will be owned by the local government 
(municipality or province), but managed by the users, who will establish a Market Management 
Committee (MMC). The users of the market pay a fee for use, that will be used to finance operation 
and maintenance and depreciation. 
103 
Nepal 
Agriculture Sector Development Programme 
Final programme design report 
Appendix 4:  Detailed Programme description 
32.  The ASDP, will finance the development of marketing infrastructure, according to the needs 
identified in the SIP and in line with local government priorities. The Programme will finance 85 per 
cent of the cost of the market and the local government will finance 15 per cent. This will include 
municipality-owned markets of different sizes depending on location and identified need. Markets will 
have women-friendly and safe spaces. The MMC will be assisted to organise for optimal operation 
and maintenance of the market. 
33.  Community-based collection centres are also proposed to be developed in line with the needs 
of traders. The collection centres will be farmer organisation including co-operative owned and 
operated. The farmers who own a collection centre will be legally registered.  
Sub-component 3. Rural financial services for value chain development strengthened 
34.  Under this Sub-component (outcome), the Programme will facilitate financial linkages for 
agriculture producers and agri-businesses in value chains. Apart from 35,000 households covered 
under ASDP, the 15,200 producers covered under HVAP, and the rural community in general, will also 
receive improved access to financial services, especially the production credit. A primary reason for 
including this sub-component is to providing existing and new value chain stakeholders, at all levels of 
the chain, with access to finance to provide scope for post-programme sustainability and scalability of 
ASDP and HVAP supported and for new value chain development. While the Programme will work 
largely with co-operatives and Micro-finance Development Banks (MFDBs) for financing of producers, 
the commercial banks will be engaged for facilitating credit linkages for agri-businesses. Commercial 
banks will also be supported for new product development, such as financing of farmers with linkages 
to agro-vets, traders and processors, through alternate collateral mechanisms. This outcome will 
include two outputs: (i) Rural financial services development; and (iv) Support to credit access. 
35.  The rural finance strategy has a twin track approach of working with financial institutions to 
develop suitable credit and insurance products that meet producers’ and agri-businesses’ needs and, 
simultaneously, building producers’ capacity to utilise credit effectively and to mitigate production 
risks. The rural finance outcome will initially dovetail with the co-financing proposals of producer 
groups and enable the producers to leverage the bank loans for their viable business proposals. Each 
co financing proposal will have 50% members’ share which will be facilitated though loans and 
members own funds. While the first loan to the individuals/group/agri-business will require facilitation, 
with the proven credit history of the borrowers, the financial institutions will continue to lend to the 
producers for their production and investment needs and also agri-businesses. Similarly, the agri- 
businesses will receive support to access credit. Banks would be informed of the Programme 
interventions, different grant windows and the evaluation mechanisms, which would provide comfort to 
the banks. 
36.  This outcome would include two outputs: (i) Rural financial services development; and 
(iv) Support to credit access. 
37.  Output 3.1. Rural financial services development. This output will be comprised of three 
activities: (i) Product innovation for value chain financing and loan risk management; (ii) Capacity 
development of co-operatives; and (iii) Improving insurance uptake. 
o  Product innovation for value chain financing and loan risk management. It is expected that 
about five (5) commercial banks will develop value chain financing arrangements with the 
Programme and introduce trade and production financing. About 20 value chain financing 
agreements covering about 10,000 primary producers in different value chains are expected 
to be put in place. This initiative will be initiated with HVAP supported agri-businesses and 
producers where the processor/trader and producer’s relationships are well established. 
Thereafter, it will be expanded to the ASDP clientele. 
o  The Programme will convene a MSP for each commodity value chain consisting of major 
stakeholders including input suppliers, producers, research/extension service providers, agri-
businesses and financial institutions. This will help develop a common understanding among 
104 
Nepal 
Agriculture Sector Development Programme 
Final programme design report 
Appendix 4:  Detailed programme description 
the stakeholders on financial requirements. Through the MSP and also Programme 
interventions, value chain agreements will be forged between agri-businesses and farmers 
with clearly established channel relationships, contracts and formal agreements. This will form 
the basis of value chain financing.  
o  The Programme will provide TA to banks intending to implement value chain financing 
solutions.  Technical assistance will include both international and national experts (see 
Appendix 4, Annex 3 for ToRs). The TA will be needs-based and the Programme will have the 
flexibility of hiring on monthly or shorter duration basis. The TA will cover identification of 
agribusinesses willing to adopt transparent practices with farmers and deal with banks for 
financial requirements on own account as well as the farmers, product development 
consistent with the prioritised value chains, developing protocols for products comprising size, 
rate of interest, repayment terms, collateral and repayment mechanisms. 
o  The Programme will engage individual consultant/s to provide TA to interested commercial 
banks to explore and develop value chain financing products. The likely value chain financing 
arrangements for different value chain commodities Include: (i) agro-vet/agro-supplier input 
financing (for seeds and inputs, animal care nutrients and medicines); (ii) processor financing 
(for turmeric, ginger, dairy, honey, apple); and (iii) trader financing (vegetables, apple, millets). 
The Programme will also draw on the development of the products under Sakchyam, UNNATI 
etc., and the proposed loan guarantee fund mechanism under the active consideration of 
donors etc. Sakchyam, being implemented in State 6 and State 7 has offered to partner with 
the Programme in (i) working with 5 to 6 commercial bank partners in value chain financing; 
these partners are showing interest in scaling up their pilot activities, and, hence, can be 
potential partners for ASDP; and (ii) offering Sakchyam’s credit guarantee fund mechanism for 
VC lending by the banks under ASDP.  
o  Both the options of financing production activities of farmers through wholesale lending 
through these agri-businesses with transparent contracts, and directly to individual farmers 
with the guarantee of agri-businesses to ensure repayments from the cash flows between the 
parties will be explored. The consultant will study the existing relationships and internal value 
chain mechanisms between farmers and agri-businesses. Data on producers such as farm 
size, production costs, input supplier, average production, yields, yearly production variations, 
prices, immediate sales points, technical support available, crop/plantation/livestock 
insurance will also be gathered. 
o  The consultants along with Assistant Rural Finance Programme Experts will identify agri-
businesses with good reputation in dealing with farmers. Agri-businesses with clear intention 
of increasing their business through value chain financing (VCF) arrangement will be selected 
and various options of financing including requirements of farmers will be initially discussed 
with agri-businesses. S/he will also carry out a risk assessment of the VCF that can be used 
by the bank in understanding the VCF risks and devising the product. The risk assessment 
will include (i) primary production risks; (ii) side selling risks; (iii) aggregator level risks in 
failing to deliver inputs/lifting the outputs; (iv) chosen client (input dealer, trader, processor) 
level risks analysing the liquidity, payment capacity, solvency; (v) reputation risks if the client 
has bad dealings with the farmers; and (vi) cyclical market risks associated with the 
commodity.  
o  Thereafter, joint consultations among agri-businesses, farmer groups and bank will be held to 
work out the contours of financing and ensuring repayments of bank loans. Cash flow based 
lending mechanisms will be discussed with the banks and collaterals such as first loss default 
guarantee (to be provided by the client and producers) will be explored to provide comfort to 
the banks. Tripartite agreement among banks, agri-business and farmers will be entered 
spelling out the terms of financing – amount, rate of interest, repayment period, etc. The 
consultant will seek to design repayment mechanisms around cash flows receivable by 
105 
Nepal 
Agriculture Sector Development Programme 
Final programme design report 
Appendix 4:  Detailed Programme description 
farmers while selling their products to agri-businesses in case of production loans and cash 
flows receivable by businesses from their buyers in case of trade loans.   
o  Financing of agri-businesses – The Consultants will explore the feasibility of discounting trade 
bills and finance against purchase contracts in the case of trade finance. In particular, the 
focus will be short duration loans that are required in commodity trade.   Part of the value 
chain finance requirements will be in infrastructure for storage, grading, processing, packing, 
etc. for agri-businesses. These also will be examined as part of value chain finance 
requirements and suitable financial products will be developed in the selected value chains 
along with the conditions for such financing to succeed.   Banks will be informed of the 
Programme interventions, different grant windows and evaluation mechanisms, which will 
provide comfort to the banks. TA will facilitate development of banks’ credit policies towards 
VCF including risk assessment tools, due diligence exercise, loan monitoring and early 
warning systems.  Alternatively, government or DPs may offer a first loss buffer fund to banks 
to enable them to reduce their collateral requirements and leverage additional agro-enterprise 
lending 
o  Training and Exposure visits - Apart from TA, the bank staff will be provided in depth training 
on the relevant value chains that Programme is working on to understand the information 
flows, cash flows, the risks and the mitigation mechanisms. Senior managers, branch 
managers, credit managers and other key staff of the participating bank branches will be 
trained by the Programme. The Programme will also organize two study tours to India to 
financial institutions such as, Yes bank, HDFC bank and Samunnati Finance to study their 
agri-value chain financing products. Apart from senior bankers, the Programme key staff and 
relevant stakeholders will also be part of the study tours. The training programmes and study 
tours will be conducted by a training establishment of repute like the National Banking 
Training Institute who have (i) at least 10 years of experience in training senior bankers; 
(ii) have organisational linkages with banks and bankers training institutions in other countries 
in the region specialising in value chain/agri financing; and (iii) have experience in conducting 
agri/VC financing or have strategic interest and capability in designing specific courses. 
o  Capacity development for co-operatives and MFDBs. This activity has two parts: (i) MFDBs 
and co-operatives develop agriculture lending products; and (ii) Capacity development of co-
operatives 
o  MFDBs and co-operatives develop agriculture lending products. MFDBs have wider presence 
in the municipalities, but their products are not suitable for agriculture lending. The 
Programme will engage with the larger MFDBs based in the Programme area and assess 
their keenness to cater to new market segments and develop new products.  There are also 
large co-operatives functioning across the State and some are keen to develop agriculture 
lending products.  The Programme will work with these co-operatives to build their capacity 
for lending to value chain members. The capacity development support will include: (i) TA for 
agri-lending product development; (ii) information technology support for improving monitoring 
and efficiency; and (iii) staff training for agri-lending.  
o  Those co-operatives fulfilling the following criteria will be chosen for product development: 
(i) good governance; (ii) 80 per cent members saving regularly; (iii) at least 50 per cent 
members have availed loans in the last year; (iv) repayment rate of more than 95 per cent 
during last year; (v) functional MIS system with data accuracy; and (vi) assured sources of 
funding for offering agricultural loans. The Programme will enter into a MoU with these 
institutions specifying the nature of the Programme support and expected outputs.  
o  TA will be provided to these institutions in their development of agriculture loan products. 
Individual national consultant/s will be hired to develop suitable products, assist in rolling them 
out and facilitate any modifications necessary (see Annex 3 for ToRs). Agriculture loans will 
address the financing of the sub-projects of groups and co-operatives where partial co-
106

Appendix 4:  Detailed programme description 
financing will be made available from the Programme. The loan products that will be needed 
include loans for irrigation, tools and equipment, crop/plantation production costs and 
livestock financing. The staff of the co-operatives (both head office and branch staff) will also 
be provided training on agriculture lending. Some co-operatives are keen to improve their 
management information systems for better monitoring and cost efficiency through 
information technology such as mobile, tablets, etc. Proven systems and technologies will be 
supported on a 50:50 co-financing basis. 
o  Capacity development of co-operatives. About 200  co-operatives are expected to be 
supported by the Programme. Co-operatives working within the municipalities of the 
Programme area will be facilitated to consolidate/amalgamate to improve their capacity to 
cater to member needs and be credit worthy for wholesale bank loans. While strengthening 
the existing co-operatives will be the primary focus, commodity value chain specific 
aggregation (input supply and output sales) will also require the formation of new co-
operatives. These co-operatives will initially consist of value chain group members and 
expand the scope of membership to include more producers of same commodity. The 
Programme will select the co-operatives based on the following criteria: (i) operational for at 
least 3 years; (ii) functional board; (iii) at least 75 members; (iv) savings regularity of members 
at least 80 per cent; (v) repayment rate on loans above 95 per cent; (vi) at least 50 per cent of 
members have borrowed in the last year; and (vii) preferably agri-producer co-operatives so 
that input and output marketing will be feasible.  
o  The capacity development support will include training, on site mentoring, automated MIS and 
equipment and facilitated access to wholesale credit.  The Programme will engage the 
services of national institutions like NACCFL or a similar for capacity development of co-
operatives for a period of 3 years. The institution should have: (i) mandate and strategic 
interest in capacity development of agriculture and savings and credit co-operatives; (ii) have 
proven experience of 10 years in capacity development; (iii) have capability to facilitate credit 
linkages for wholesale credit with commercial banks, development banks and micro finance 
development banks; and (iv) have established software based MIS and monitoring systems 
for the co-operative to track financial services and commodity specific activities. Apart from 
the programme related costs, a management fee up to 10 per cent of the costs will be 
provided to the institution. 
o  Training - Both new and old co-operatives will receive training on institutional development 
and business development.  The trainings will include; (i) business plan development, raising 
internal resources and managing external borrowings; (ii) design of agriculture credit products 
and (iii) improving governance, co-operative principles; and (iv) accounting and internal audit. 
While the training on business planning and agricultural credit will be conducted at a 
municipality level and cover 2 to 3 persons from each co-operative, the training on improving 
governance will be on-site covering all the board members. The staff will also undergo 
computer operational training. 
o  Mentoring – The co-operatives will also receive on site mentoring support from consultant/s 
engaged by the institution (such as RMDC/NACCFL. etc.). The consultant/s will initially visit 
quarterly which will later be reduced to a quadrimester in the second and third years. They will 
visit each co-operative for a day or two and ensure that business plans are well implemented, 
ensuring adequate growth in membership, commodity related businesses, savings and credit 
and portfolio quality. They will provide advice on improving governance. They will also review 
the loan products, especially agriculture loan products and offer suggestions for improvement.  
o  MIS and related equipment – Co-operatives with more than 400 members will be facilitated to 
improve their accounting and portfolio monitoring through software-based monitoring system. 
The Programme will facilitate the purchase of software as well as equipment such as 
computers, printer, etc. Co-operatives will be cost sharing at 50 per cent. 
107

Appendix 4:  Detailed Programme description 
o  Wholesale credit - The Programme will facilitate need-based credit linkages for these co-
operatives. Regular meetings will be facilitated between banks, wholesale financial institutions 
and the co-operatives needing credit for ensuring an adequate flow of loan funds.

o  Improving insurance uptake. It is expected that at least 50 per cent of the value chain 
households will avail of insurance facilities by the end of the Programme. The Programme 
will adopt a three-pronged strategy for promoting insurance as a risk mitigation strategy for 
farmers. The Programme will (i) work with the Insurance Board to select insurance 
companies to develop/modify the products and enable distribution of the products as well as 
claim settlement; (ii) help in improving the agent network in municipalities by training LRPs 
as insurance agents and capacitating them to deal with insurance products; and 
(iii) increase awareness of farmers about insurance as a risk mitigation strategy and 
facilitate structured learning through literacy facilitators at the villages. Since rural insurance 
is in nascent stages of development in the country, this offers an opportunity for the 
Programme to work closely with the Insurance Board and insurance companies in 
developing and modifying the products. 
o  The Programme will work with Insurance Board, municipal and provincial agriculture 
department to develop/ modify insurance products. The Rural Finance Specialist will interact 
with the Insurance Board and insurance companies and identify 2 or 3 companies with good 
track records of developing/modifying insurance products, claim settlement process and 
willingness to partner with the Programme. The TA providers will carry out field based 
studies on the existing products on offer and features/processes modified to suit the 
requirements of Programme area/ farmers. New products will also be developed with field 
level data (turmeric, ginger, timur). There is potential to develop weather-based insurance 
around the existing weather stations. The Programme will facilitate study tours for Insurance 
Board and select insurance company managers as well as Government officials to India, 
where weather index-based insurance products have been in operation for more than a 
decade. This will offer insights in design and distribution. 
o  The Programme, in coordination with Insurance Board and MAUs and Ward-level CAESC, 
will impart insurance training to Local Resource Persons (LRP). In all, about 100 LRPs will 
be trained for the mandatory hours and the Insurance Board will license them as insurance 
agents. These agents will earn commission on non-life insurance products. LRPs will 
distribute insurance products, enabling farmers to enrol for insurance and also facilitate 
farmers to fill in forms and complete other formalities for claim settlement. LRPs will also be 
trained how to carry out insurance as a business service. LRPs acting as insurance agents 
at local level, will lead to better distribution and also on time filing of claims. 
108

Appendix 4:  Detailed programme description 
o  Building on HVAP’s business literacy training model, the Programme will also include 
modules on insurance literacy for improving farmers’ awareness and knowledge of 
insurance. There will be four modules: (i) the risks farmers face and insurance as risk 
mitigation strategy; (ii) crop/plantation insurance products; (iii) livestock insurance products; 
and (iv) enrolment and claim processing; do’s and don’ts. Business and financial literacy 
facilitators will undergo ToT arranged by the Programme (section below). 
38.  Output 3.2: Support to credit access. In all, about 1,000 facilitators will be trained who, in turn, 
will train the value chain group members. It is assumed that about 70 per cent of the 35,000 value 
chain farmer stakeholders will need and undergo this training. This output has one activity: Business 
and financial literacy for value chain members. 
o  Business and financial literacy for value chain members. HVAP is facilitating business 
literacy class for women, especially from marginalised sections such as Dalit, Janajati and 
the poorest households with the aim of commercialising agriculture. The classes aim for 
improving members’ awareness and skills about various aspects of the value chain in which 
they are participating. Well trained business literacy facilitators, chosen from the groups, 
deliver the training at village level on social dynamics, technical aspects of value chain they 
are participating in, basic numeracy and business aspects of the commodity. This is 
resulting in better awareness and skills among the women about the business aspects of the 
commodity they are producing. This initiative will be scaled up under the ASDP, enlarging 
the scope of the training to include financial literacy aspects as well. 
The Programme will review the existing training modules and materials, improve the content 
to suit the training needs of the participants based on past experience (including more 
pictorial content as compared to text) and include modules on financial literacy. The 
modules on financial literacy will include aspects of: (i) savings and returns; (ii) usage of 
credit for improving income, avoiding multiple loans and over indebtedness; and (iii) 
insurance literacy.  
Value chain groups will select preferably a female facilitator who will be provided a ToT 
course at a centralised location. She will deliver the training to other members of the VC 
group in about 45 modules of 3 hours each delivered twice a week. The learning group will 
consist of women from Dalits, Janajatis, and very poor households and also risk-averse 
members. The group size will be 25 to 30 to facilitate learning. The BFLC facilitator will be 
paid an honorarium for delivering each session. A study to measure the outcomes of the 
training will be carried out after the initial batch is completed to further improve the content 
and efficacy of the training.

Sub-component 4. Agriculture services sustainably support innovation and value chain 
development 
40. 
In line with the provisions of the new Constitution of Nepal and the ADS 2014, ASDP will 
support the development of participatory, pluralistic extension and service delivery systems for 
agriculture and livestock sectors at the municipal and ward levels. It will involve setting up and 
activating sustainable mechanisms at appropriate levels in the Local Bodies for governance, active 
farmer participation and the engagement of the private sector in service delivery. This outcome also 
proposes to build off HVAP achievements on women’s development by further empowering women, 
particularly in their households and by translating improved household income into improved nutrition. 
This outcome includes two outputs: (i) Participatory and pluralistic extension services and 
strengthened farmers organizations; and (iii) Women’s empowerment and household nutrition. 
41.  Output 1. Participatory and pluralistic extension service development. The success of this 
output will be measured by the “number of CAESCs in Programme Wards delivering publicly and 
privately funded services to producers through pluralistic extension providers (disaggregated by 
funding source)”. The objective of this output is to facilitate the establishment of a sustainable, 
pluralistic and participatory institutional mechanism at the level of Local Bodies for the delivery of 
extension services to farmers in consonance with the provisions of the new Constitution of Nepal and 
ADS 2014, to be used by effective farmer organizations. The strategy will be to draw on the new 
constitutional provisions pertaining to local bodies, those of the LSGA 1999 pertaining to decentralised 
participatory extension and service delivery and the proposals outlined in ADS 2014 under DSTEP, 
and the HVAP experience of linking farmers to service providers and businesses. The Swiss 
Development and Cooperation (SDC) supported NASDP is being implemented by HSI in nine districts 
across four States, including three (Dailekh, Jajarkot, Kalikot) of the proposed ASDP districts in 
State 6. The initiatives proposed here are similar to those included in the NASDP. SDC will support 
the ASDP, providing a grant for USD 3.0 million for Technical Assistance (TA) implemented by HSI to 
expand the coverage of NASDP to ASDP impact areas in all 10 districts, with specific focus on 
organising and capacitating farmer groups and co-operatives and provision of pluralistic services to 
farmer’s groups linked to the value chains selected under ASDP. SDC will transfer TA fund to HSI 
directly.

42.  Activity 1. Extension service development: Actions proposed under this activity include: 
(i) establish MAUs at municipal level115; (ii) establish CAESCs at ward level116; and (iii) Private sector 
engagement in agriculture extension and service delivery. 
o  Establish MAUs at municipal level: The LSGA 1999 had envisaged creation of Agriculture, 
Forestry and Environment Committees (AFECs)117 as a sectoral committee at the VDC 
level118 to assist it to plan and manage agriculture, forestry and environment related 
services. As the VDCs no longer exist and local governance functions earlier earmarked for 
it have been brought to the level of municipality, the appropriate location for a similar 
sectoral committee is the municipality.  MAU is being proposed as the sectoral sub-
committee of the municipal executive119 for the agriculture and livestock sector and would 
have five to seven members from among the members of the municipal executive, including 
the Chair120 and with at least 50 percent of the members as women121 and at least one 
Dalit/Janajati person nominated by the municipal executive, and heads of the sectoral 
departments at the municipality. It will be responsible for the agriculture, livestock and 
forestry sector activities in the municipality. Specifically, it will: (i) develop policies for 
approval by the Municipal Assembly; (ii) develop the agriculture extension and service 
delivery systems within the municipality; (iii) identify potential value chain and agri-business 
development opportunities; (iv) facilitate engagement with various stakeholders/service 
providers in the sector; (v) exercise oversight over the sectoral function; (vi) engage with the 
national and regional agricultural research institutions to influence their research priorities; 
(vii) recommend budgets to the Municipal Executive Council; and (viii) register, monitor and 
backstop the CAESCs to be set up at each ward in the municipality. Actual implementation 
of extension and service delivery strategies will be by the CAESCs. ASDP will initially work 
with about 60 municipalities in State 6122, 50 in the first year and 10 in the third year123. The 
following implementation steps are envisaged: 
o  Orienting stakeholders on MAU’s roles and responsibilities: A two-day workshop will be 
conducted in each of the 10 districts for the Municipality Chairpersons/Vice-chairpersons, 
Mayors/Deputy Mayors, Ward Chairpersons, administrative officers and technical staff in the 
selected municipalities and wards. The workshop will deliberate on the Constitutional 
provisions regarding the role of the municipality in agriculture; the concept of MAU in that 
context, its roles and responsibilities, structure, by-laws; various (public, private, co-
115 The Constitution of Nepal does not specify any committees as part of the Municipalities or Wards. It is expected, however, that the 
Municipalities would have a governance and oversight structure for the agriculture sector (as well as other sectors in its domain), such as to 
recommend policies, plans and budgets to the Municipal Executive Committee for presentation to the Municipal Assembly and for management 
and oversight as the subject has been placed in their domain by the Constitution of Nepal. As is the normal practice at municipal levels, such 
structures take the form of a sub-committee of the municipal executive committee. In the course of interactions with the newly elected 
Mayors/Chairpersons in State 6, it was suggested that a committee should be set up exclusively for agriculture (perceived by them to be a key 
sector for the development of the region) so that it receives undivided attention. The precise nomenclature is likely to be known when an Act is 
passed by the Government of Nepal regarding the management procedures at the Local Level, the name tentatively proposed is Municipal 
Agriculture Development Committee (MAU). 
116 ADS 2014 had proposed CAESCs to be set at the VDC level as a key measure to promote pluralistic, decentralised and farmer-responsive 
extension system. ADS is undergoing revision to align itself with the new Constitution of Nepal. However, in line with the policy of decentralisation, 
CAESCs are likely to remain as a part of the policy, regardless of eventual nomenclature. 
117 AFEC was one of five Sectoral Committees, each with three members from the VDC, envisaged as per the Regulations under LSGA 1999; the 
other four were: Infrastructure and Construction Development Committee, Population and Social Committee, Organization and Administration 
Committee and Water Resources and Land Committee. 
118 The same committee structure was envisaged at the Municipality and the District Development Committee. 
119 The Municipal Executive has directly elected Chairperson/Mayor and Vice-chairperson/Deputy Mayor, all Ward Chairs, four women members 
from Wards and two members from Dalit/Janajati nominated by the Municipal Assembly. 
120 As per the Regulations pertaining to LSGA 1999, the AFEC (as other Sectoral Committees of the VDC) was to have been chaired by one of 
the ward members of the VDC. The same arrangement may be followed as the Chairperson/Mayor has other responsibilities and may not be 
burdened with committee responsibilities. That would also ensure the neutrality of the Chairperson/ Mayor with respect to deliberations in the 
committees. 
121 A woman Deputy Chairperson of a Rural Municipality present during consultations with elected Mayors/Chairpersons and their deputies from 
six districts of State 6 held at Surkhet made a strong demand that at least 50 percent of the members of ALL committees of the Local Bodies 
must be women. 
122 There are in all 82 municipalities (26 urban and 56) in the 10 districts, including 8 (6 rural) in Dolpa and 7 (6 rural) in Humla, districts to be 
taken up later. 
123 ASDP would only work in municipalities that are included in any of the approved SIPs. The total number of municipalities to be taken up and 
their phasing over the years will depend on the phasing of SIP implementation.

operative and farmer-to-farmer) mechanisms for agricultural service provision; the 
challenges and opportunities for the development of the sector in the municipality; and the 
concept of CAESC and its structure and financing. As the average size of rural Municipal 
Executive Committees is 10 (urban 14), and including three officials, the average number of 
participants will be about 13 per municipality, there will be about 750 participants in the 
entire State. Therefore, 15 workshops may be organised by splitting the larger districts into 
two events; 
o  Assessment of technical staff capacity at Municipalities and Wards: Pending the passage of 
an Act by the Parliament to specify procedures for the conduct of official business by the 
Local Bodies, MOFALD in June 2017 issued the procedures to be followed by the elected 
Local Bodies. According to these, the physical assets of the government at the Local Levels, 
such as ASCs, LSCs, schools, health centres, etc. are to be transferred to the Local Bodies. 
The corresponding personnel are to report to the Local Bodies. Thus, the sectoral staff from 
the districts, including extension managers and those working at the ASC and LSC will be 
shifted to the municipalities and wards and additional staff may be recruited124. An 
assessment of their technical knowledge in the agro-ecological context of the municipality, 
including organic agriculture, climate change adaptation, various extension methodologies, 
issues of inclusion and exclusion, use of ICT for extension, the roles and responsibilities of 
Local Bodies and wards with respect to agriculture under the new Constitution of Nepal, the 
opportunities and challenges for the development of agriculture and livestock sectors and 
the proposed value chains in the respective municipalities will be carried out and capacity 
development needs, including in technical knowledge, extension methodologies, business 
development, value chain development and community mobilisation will be identified 
through a participatory process; 
o  Resourcing Municipal technical staff: Budgetary support will be provided to the MAU to 
enable the municipal technical staff to engage with the value chain development processes 
(MSPs and selection of value chain actors) and for coordination with and backstopping the 
CAESCs; 
o  Building the capacity of municipal technical staff: Based on the assessment of the capacity 
development needs of the municipal technical staff a capacity development plan will be 
prepared and updated periodically and will, inter alia, include topics such as various 
extension methods, group formation and management, organic and sustainable agricultural 
practices, climate change adaptation, farm budgeting and business plan preparation, use of 
ICT in extension, issues of gender equity and social inclusion, value chain development, etc. 
besides agricultural technologies relevant to the agro-ecological context of the municipality. 
Capacity development activities will be organised yearly for the staff on the basis of these 
plans, updated on a yearly basis; 
o  Support for enabling farmer access to technology: Based on the policies and priorities set by 
the municipalities, resources will be provided to the MAU to augment support provided by 
them to CAESCs at the ward level for providing technology extension services based on the 
latter’s plans on a yearly basis. The plans will include activities supported by the municipality 
out of its extension budget for the ward, resources allocated from ASDP as well as those 
supported from CAESC’s resources, including fees from users. 
o  Establish CAESCs at the ward level: A CAESC will be established at each of the Wards that  
have farming households and a budget for agricultural extension125 in each of the selected 
124 The MOFALD guidelines also specify the number of staff to be appointed at the Local Body and Ward levels. Though elections to the Local 
Bodies, including the DCC have been completed, these transitions have not yet materialized but are likely to be completed by the time ASDP gets 
underway. 
125 While municipalities have been classified as urban and rural, wards have not been so classified. Many urban municipalities have rural 
settlements as is evident from the HVAP experience where about 46 percent of the 14,500 project households are from VDCs now included in 
urban municipalities. It is expected that urban municipalities will provide budgets for agricultural extension in wards with farming households. 
Since CAESC is at the level of wards, ASDP will include all wards that have provision for agricultural extension in selected municipalities.

Municipalities, broadly along the lines proposed in the ADS 2014126 and guided by the 
policies and priorities set by the municipalities. It will be a membership organisation with 
membership open to farmers, private sector/freelance service providers and agro-
enterprises in the Ward. Thus, while the MAU is part of the governance structure at the 
municipality, the CAESC is a community based organisation (CBO) that will both contribute 
to policy and programming at the municipality level through the MAU and facilitate/source 
service delivery127. The CAESC will elect a Board/Executive Committee of seven to nine 
members with at not less than 50 per cent representation of women farmers, small and 
marginal farmers and Dalits and Janajatis. The CAESC will be registered at the Municipal 
level. ASDP will work with about 480 Wards across the 60 chosen municipalities128 to 
establish CAESCs. The following initiatives are proposed to facilitate the establishment of 
CAESCs: 
o  Orientation of stakeholders to the concept of CAESC and its roles and responsibilities: The 
purpose of this activity is to sensitize stakeholders (farmers, their groups, service providers, 
women, youth, etc.) about the need for a multi-stakeholder platform to develop and manage 
sustainable and responsive famer services. The Ward in the municipality set up is largely 
co-terminus with the erstwhile VDC and will have between eight to 12 settlements. As the 
CAESC is a membership organisation, it is imperative that as many stakeholders as 
possible know the plans for its formation so that they can exercise the choice to join it so 
that it becomes an inclusive CBO. To ensure this, the elected and nominated ward members 
and the ward chairperson will conduct informal, neighbourhood meetings in all the 
settlements in their respective wards to familiarise the community about CAESC and plans 
for its formation prior to its formation. In preparation for such interaction, workshops will be 
conducted for the ward members and ward chair to familiarise them about CAESC, its 
purpose, roles, responsibilities, structure, etc. so that they can effectively engage with the 
wider community as mobilisers. The average number of wards per municipality is nine in 
State 6 and, excluding the predominantly urban settlements, on average about eight Wards 
will be taken up for orientation per municipality. There will be about 3 360 participants as 
there are five committee members and about two staff in each Ward and 120 orientation 
workshops will be organised over three years with about 28 participants in each workshop. 
Following the orientation, CAESCs will be formed.  
o  CAESC establishment mechanism: Once formed, the CAESC will be assisted to develop 
work plans for its area of operation, including sources of funds and likely partners. Based on 
a viable plan, the CAESC will be provided seed capital129 for minor equipment and supplies 
and to support pluralistic extension services in the Ward. The recurring costs of CAESC will 
be met through budgetary subventions from the municipality130 via the MAU, membership 
fees and fees for services charged by the CAESC. 
o  Annual CAESC participatory planning: The CAESC will be assisted to develop a 
participatory planning process to identify priorities for agriculture and livestock extension and 
services in the Ward and the modalities for their delivery. This will include plans for the 
delivery of services by the CAESC itself and development of service delivery contracts with 
potential service providers, such as Agro-Vets, traders and aggregators. A participatory plan 
will be developed on a yearly basis and presented to the MAU for mobilising budgetary 
resources from the Municipality. It will include a financial plan. ASDP support and technical 
assistance will be provided to the CAESC for developing the annual plan. 
126 ADS 2014, pp 158 
127 Guidance for the structure of the CAESC will be provided by the municipality based on the recommendations of the MAU. 
128 The likely number of rural wards. 
129 Similar to the seed capital proposed under DSTEP in ADS 2014. The ADS had proposed that seed money would be provided only 
under the condition that it leverages larger investment by the VDC and the community/cooperatives/private sector for the establishment 
of the CAESC. Following the same principle, ASDP contribution would be on a matching basis with contributions from the municipality 
and stakeholders in the CAESC. 
130 A GoN Directive requires that at least 15 per cent of the local block grants should be allocated to agricultural development and 
services and it has been attached with the Minimum Condition Performance Measure.

Appendix 4:  Detailed Programme description 
o  Pilot a voucher system for provision of extension services: ADS 2014 has proposed 
introducing a voucher system to enable farmers the choice of service provider. ASDP will 
pilot a voucher system to be administered by the CAESC in selected municipalities. Based 
on the results, the systems may be expanded at the time of MTR. Though the ADS has 
proposed the voucher system for extension services as well as subsidised inputs, the pilot 
proposed here will be only for extension services to minimise complexity. To minimise abuse 
and encourage payment by farmers for services, the users (farmers’ groups/farmers) will 
buy the vouchers from the CAESC at a price representing their contribution to the cost of 
services. The redemption value of the voucher will comprise of contributions from CAESC 
out of its extension budget, a contribution from the traders/aggregators linked to their 
contract with producers and the users’ contribution. The service provider will receive the 
redemption value from CAESC upon presenting the voucher. In case the farmers do not use 
the voucher, they will receive a refund of the price paid by them. Details of the system will 
be worked out by HSI following further consultations in the field as ASDP implementation 
gets underway. 
o  Private sector engagement in agriculture (including livestock) extension and service 
delivery: In harmony with the strategies outlined in the ADS 2014 and guided by the policies 
and priorities set by the municipality on the basis of MAU recommendations, support will be 
provided to develop the capacity of the private and co-operative sectors to deliver 
agricultural extension and services, both as embedded services as well as standalone 
businesses. ASDP will support one such enterprise in each of 25 rural municipalities131 
chosen through MSP guidance. Support will be provided on the basis of viable business 
plans to agro-vets132 to set up extension and service (including inputs) delivery enterprises 
in the selected municipalities. The following activities are proposed to develop private sector 
engagement in the provision of agriculture extension and service provision: 
o  Training of Agro-Vets in entrepreneurship: Support will be provided to train up to two 
potential Agro-Vet candidates in each of the 25 selected municipalities from among youth 
(women and men) who have already undergone training as VAW, VAHW or JTA. 
Candidates will have demonstrated means to set up Agro-Vet services and interest to do so. 
The seven-day training module will cover entrepreneurship motivation and enterprise plan 
preparation and business management; 
o  Investment support to Agro-Vets: Support will be provided to Agro-Vets to cover 30 per cent 
of the investment, based on a viable business plan. The business plan will include names of 
up to three LRPs with prior training as VAW or VAHW to be engaged by the Agro-Vet to 
work in the chosen municipality with the latter’s consent letters. There will be a tripartite 
contract between CAESC, Agro-Vets and the LRPs to be engaged by the latter; 
o  Support for LRPs to be engaged by Agro-Vets: Support will be provided to the Agro-Vets to 
engage up to three LRPs including at least one woman, each as their sales persons, service 
providers and extension agents. Support will be on a declining basis against pre-set 
performance benchmarks for three years at the rate of 50, 30 and 10 per cent of the cost in 
the first, second and third year of engagement, respectively and will be contingent upon 
signing a tripartite contract between the CAESC, the Agro-Vet and the LRPs; 
o  Training of Agro-Vets and LRPs: Support will be provided to train the contracted Agro-Vets 
and up to three LRPs per Agro-Vet. The training will cover production technologies 
concerning the selected value chains and home gardens. 
131 More municipalities may be included at Mid-term based on implementation experience. 
132 The term Agro-Vet is used to represent providers of inputs, such as seeds, veterinary medicines, small implements as well as services 
pertaining to agriculture and livestock.

HSI  would  facilitate  the  Executive  Committee  at  the  municipality  to  set  up  the  MAU  as 
one of its committees. It is a part of the elected local government. The role of HSI in this 
is  only  to  orient  the  members  of  the  municipal  executive  committee  and  the  public 
officials placed at the municipality to the roles and responsibilities of MAU as outlined in 
the LSGA 1999 and as envisioned by the newly constituted municipal government; 
HSI  will  assess  the  technical  capacity  of  the  sector  staff  within  the  municipality  with 
respect to knowledge of the sectoral  disciplines and the tasks the staff are expected to 
carry out. This will be done by HSI in consultation with key elected representatives of the 
municipality and the concerned staff. HSI will develop detailed terms of references for the 
sectoral function at the municipality as the basis for such an assessment, including topics 
such  as  extension  methods,  organic  and  sustainable  agricultural  practices,  farm 
budgeting  and  business  plan  preparation,  use  of  ICT  in  extension,  issues  of  gender 
equity  and  social 
inclusion,  value  chain  development,  etc.  besides  agricultural 
technologies relevant to the agro-ecological context of the municipality; 
Support for the  MAU to  enable it to engage  with the  value chain development process, 
such as participation in MSPs, contributing to the process of selecting partners, etc.  will 
be provided by the PCO on the basis of planned events and estimates of costs; 
HSI  will  organise  capacity  building  events  for  the  municipal  technical  personnel  in 
collaboration  with  the  experts  in  agriculture  and  livestock  services  sectors  in  the  State 
and  by  hiring  resource  persons  where  necessary  on  the  basis  of  the  capacity  building 
needs; 
Support  to  augment  MAU’s  resources  to  partly  finance  extension  services  facilitated  by 
CAESCs  will  be  provided  by  the  PCO.  These  will  be  based  on  the  SIP  and  matching 
criteria to be developed in the MSP; 
The  elected  Ward  representatives  and  Ward  technical  staff  have  an  important  role  in 
supporting and nurturing the CAESC as a membership association of farmers and other 
sectoral  stakeholders  in  the  ward.  HSI  will  orient  the  elected  representatives  about  the 
CAESC  and  develop  modalities  for  its  formation133,  who  will  in  turn  sensitize  the  wider 
community of stakeholders; 
The CAESC establishment fund will be provided by the PCO on the basis of viable plans 
developed by the CAESC with the assistance of  HSI; 
HSI  will  assist  the  CAESC  to  develop  annual  plans  for  provision  of  farmer  services. 
These will include financing plans, plans for participation of the private service providers 
and the role of municipal and ward level technical staff; 
Entrepreneurship development training for potential Agro-Vets will be organised by  HSI, 
using  material  available 
to  enterprise 
development plans by them, of which 25 will be supported by ASDP; 
in-house  and  other  material134, 
leading 
HSI will assist in developing tripartite contracts between Agro-Vets, CAESCs and LRPs 
for co-financing of up to 30 per cent of investment costs to set up Agro-Vet services and 
support for engaging LRPs to provide services to farmers. The Agro-Vets will be chosen 
in the course of MSP processes, based on value chain development plans; 
133 A possible way to form the forum is for each settlement in the Ward to identify a few (volunteer) members and call an assembly of such 
members at the Ward level to draft by-laws, initial fees, etc. and then canvass/enrol members. 
134 For example, from the Industrial Enterprise Development Institute, Nepal, the ILO-promoted Start and Improve Your Own Business (SIYB), etc. 
India also has a large number of institutes devoted to entrepreneurship training, mostly drawing on the pioneering work by David McClelland in 
the early 1960s in the country.

Number of Agro-Vets functioning as profitable businesses; 
Number of LRPs employed, disaggregated gender-, social and ethnic composition-wise; 
Financial self-sufficiency of CAESCs. 
49.  The key impact from these activities is enhanced farm productivity, reduction in hungry periods 
and enhanced incomes. 
50.  Sustainability. The elected Municipalities and Executives are now in place though an Act 
spelling out the rules and procedures for their business is yet to be passed by the Parliament. Actual 
structure and operating procedures of MAU would emerge once these procedures are in place, 
existing local level personnel are transferred to Local Bodies and the latter become fully functional. Its 
formation and continuance, however, is ensured by virtue of the fact that agriculture extension is the 
responsibility of the Municipality and it will need to create a mechanism to manage the same as it will 
for all other devolved sectoral activities, such as education, health, etc. Finances for its operations will 
be provided through the Municipal budget as part of the sectoral allocation. 
51.  CAESC is envisaged under ADS 2014 to decentralise and devolve agricultural extension, make 
it participatory and pluralistic. ADS 2014 has committed resources to capitalise it. The activities 
proposed will ensure that CAESC is an inclusive and broad-based institution. 
52.  The Programme activities are aimed at developing Agro-Vets as profitable service enterprises, 
delivering agriculture and livestock services to farmers. The Programme has budgeted resources to 
reduce their risk by partially capitalising them, providing capacity building and financial support as 
they begin operations and by embedding them in multi-stakeholder forums, including the CAESC and 
value chain MSPs.  
53.  Activity 2. Strengthening farmer organizations. The objective of the activity is to organise 
farmers into sustainable, self-managed producer groups and commodity co-operatives so that they

can remain engaged with value chains as growing and profitable producer businesses. Building on the 
HVAP experience of working with FGs and co-operatives, ASDP will draw on the rich and extensive 
experience of developing groups and co-operatives in Nepal as well as in neighbouring South Asian 
countrieselsewhere in the world. Farmer mobilisation and group development will be carried out by 
local NGOs136 selected jointly by the PCO and  HSI, contracted by the PCO and suitably oriented by 
the PCO and  HSI. Consolidation of mature groups into commodity co-operatives under extant laws 
and developing their capacity as viable business units will be contracted out to a national TA provider 
with proven expertise in co-operative formation and development. This activity includes five key 
actions: (i) Orienting Governments at the State and in Municipalities to ASDP; (ii) Developing Farmer 
Institutions; (iii) NGO orientation to market-led development; (iv) Strengthening farmer groups; and 
(v) Consolidation of groups into commodity co-operatives. 
o  Orienting Governments at the State and in Municipalities to ASDP: Under the new 
Constitution of Nepal, powers concerning themes that encompass various ASDP activities 
have been placed in the respective domains of municipalities and States. The municipal list 
of powers includes ‘management, operation and control of agricultural extension’, 
‘agriculture and animal husbandry, agro-products management, animal health, co-
operatives’, ‘local roads, rural roads, agro-roads, irrigation’, ‘co-operative institutions’, ‘local 
market management’ and ‘forests, wildlife, birds, water uses, environment, ecology and bio-
diversity’. The list of powers of the States includes ‘agriculture and livestock development, 
trade, business, transportation’, ‘use of forests and waters and management of environment’ 
and ‘co-operative institutions’. States are likely to have ministry and/or departments for 
agriculture, livestock, forestry and co-operatives and municipalities are likely to operate 
through the sub-committee mechanism. It is imperative that the key individuals in 
governments at the State and selected municipalities are fully on board with the ASDP 
concept, design and activities to ensure an enabling environment, budgetary support (e.g. 
for extension, infrastructure) and participation (e.g. in mobilisation at the municipal and ward 
levels). The following activities are proposed: 
 
 
Programme orientation at the State: A two-day workshop will be conducted for the 
heads and key officials of the ministry and/or departments of agriculture, livestock, 
forestry, irrigation and co-operatives and DOLIDAR. The workshop may begin with 
a short general orientation session to provide a brief overview of the HVAP 
experience and an outline of ASDP, where a wider circle of policy makers 
including the Chairpersons of the 10 District Coordination Committees (DCC) may 
also be present137. This will be followed by technical sessions with detailed 
presentations on the Programme concept, design, implementation arrangements 
and support expected from the government at the State. The number of 
participants is likely to be 25 to 30. The workshop will be conducted by the PCO 
with HSI participation; 
Programme orientation at municipalities: A two-day orientation workshop will be 
conducted in each of the 10 districts to orient the Chairperson and Vice-
chairperson of the DCCs, the Members Secretary of the DCC, 
Chairpersons/Mayors, Vice-chairpersons/ Deputy Mayors, Administrative Officers 
and all Technical Officers (up to 4) of the selected municipalities. The number of 
participants will be 25 to 50 per district, depending on the number of municipalities 
chosen in the district. In all, there will about 450 participants. The workshop will be 
136 The term NGO has been used to denote Local Service Providers (LSP) to be engaged for social mobilisation and group development. HVAP 
had used NGOs as LSPs for social mobilisation and group development. As the overall responsibility for social mobilisation and group 
development is with  HSI, they may recruit NGOs as service providers or directly recruit a social mobilisation team, with a coordinator and social 
mobilisers, based on consultations between PCO and  HSI. Contracted by the PCO, the LSPs will be jointly selected by the PCO HSI, and work 
under the guidance and supervision of  HSI. 
137 The precise structure, format and likely participants in the workshop would become clear once elections to the assembly at the State are 
completed later in 2017 and the administrative structure and Rules of Business are decided. Since the event would also serve as the inauguration 
of ASDP, it would be in order to invite the elected heads from the districts. They would also individually participate in the full deliberations during 
orientation for municipalities. 
118

conducted by the PCO with HSI participation and will include a presentation on the 
HVAC experience, the concept, design and implementation modalities of ASDP 
and the expected roles of the DCC and municipal governments in implementation, 
including areas where municipal budgets are expected to contribute. 
o  Developing Farmer Institutions: Mobilisation of farmers, enabling unorganised farmers to 
organise into groups where groups do not exist and developing their capacities would be 
done by local NGOs jointly selected by PCO and HSI and contracted by the PCO, one per 
district, with the support of HSI and Institution Development Specialist (IDS) and Assistant 
IDS (AIDS) of the PCO. The SIP would have identified potential clusters, Municipalities and 
Wards for developing value chains around specific commodities. Based on the SIP, an initial 
inventory of settlements in the wards included in the identified clusters with potential for 
value chain development will be carried out. The NGO coordinator will visit the selected 
Wards with the Social Mobiliser (SM) assigned to the Wards and the Ward chair to ascertain 
the possibility of inclusion in the value chain based on specified parameters, such as road 
access, agro-ecological potential for development, present status of production, interest 
among farmers, presence and quality of groups, etc. The concept and the stipulated process 
for selection will be explained to the farmers138. The NGO coordinator will prepare a brief 
situation paper in a prescribed format provided by the PCO for all the settlements/Wards so 
explored139 to plan targeted publicity when the Expression of Interest (EoI) is floated seeking 
Investment Proposals (IPs) as described in Output 1.2. 
o  Based on the EoIs shortlisted for participation, the NGO coordinator and concerned SM will 
restructure groups, if existing groups are selected, and promote groups where EoIs are 
received from unorganised famers. They will follow the strategies and methodologies 
developed through TA and overall guidance and support of  HSI, the Institution 
Development Specialist (IDS) and Assistant IDS (AIDS) of the PCO. The following 
investments are proposed: 
 
 
International TA Support: Provision has been made for international TA support to 
develop social mobilisation and group development methodologies, including 
training materials to be used for mobilising and strengthening farmer groups. The 
TA provider will work closely with the IDS, review the status of existing HVAP 
groups and co-operatives, review the materials being used by HVAP, identify gaps 
and develop materials for use in ASDP, including training packages and group 
evaluation formats; 
Exposure/study tours: There is extensive experience of organising rural 
communities (farmers, women, artisans, etc.) in India and other Asian countries. It 
includes self-help groups and co-operatives and their associations. Some of the 
more creative work has been done by NGOs and large government programmes, 
such as the National Rural Livelihood Mission that has promoted millions of 
women’s self-help groups across the country. Structured methodologies and 
training materials have been developed for forming and strengthening groups and 
co-operatives. ASDP will facilitate study and exposure tours for the IDS, the 
AIDSs, HSI and NGO coordinators, social mobilisers and selected group leaders 
and ward chairs to nearby Indian States140 to visit. Three study tours each with 30 
to 35 participants will be organised; 
138 This pre-EOI process was not used in HVAP and is included in ASDP in the interest of targeting and inclusion. This would also ensure the 
involvement of the elected local government members in the implementation process. 
139 This pre-EOI process was not used in HVAP and is included in ASDP in the interest of better targeting and inclusion. The data from this would 
be used for targeted publicity about the EoIs and providing handholding support in developing IPs. Over time, as CAESCs and MAUs have been 
established and capacitated, this process would be led by them as an integral part of preparing agriculture development strategies and plans for 
the Ward as inputs to the MAU and data about the potential and constraints for various agricultural commodities would be available from their 
plans and strategies for agriculture development.  
140 There are strong groups and federations in Bihar promoted under the World Bank aided Amerika project and strong groups and producer 
cooperatives exist in Jharkhand, promoted by NGOs.

Appendix 4:  Detailed Programme description 
  NGO support to farmer associations: In HVAP, mobilisation of farmers and farmer 
groups and capacity development of groups was done by NGOs recruited for this 
purpose. NGOs presently are registered in the Districts141, have to set up office 
with an executive committee in every district where they work and have to work in 
coordination with the (erstwhile) District Development Committee. A clear picture 
about how NGOs will in future be registered and regulated in the context of the 
new federal system and whether the States will formulate new laws for registration 
and regulation of NGOs will emerge once the Local Bodies and State 
Governments become fully functional. It is possible that NGOs may be required to 
register with the Local Body where they are based and/or work as districts only 
have a coordination function under the Federal Constitution of Nepal. A fair 
number of NGOs work in the State, including those working in HVAP. One local 
NGO will be recruited for each of the 10 districts for the entire Programme 
duration. The NGOs will be recruited following Fixed Budget basis of selection142. 
The budget will include salaries of one Coordinator and a maximum of five Social 
Mobilisers143 per district as required and overhead/management costs. 
o  NGO orientation to market-led development: Most NGOs in the country, especially the 
smaller ones working locally in or around the district of their registration implement donor 
funded projects, operate from contract to contract and do not have their own stable 
development programmes. Most, with the exception of a few larger ones registered in 
Kathmandu and engaged in consulting and partnerships with multiple donors, do not have 
more than one or two regular staff. Staff are recruited against contracts, typically for social 
mobilisation roles. The Programme coordinators and social mobilisers recruited by the 
NGOs/HSI will therefore need to be oriented to the concept, design and implementation 
modalities of ASDP and their staff. ASDP will support separate orientation events for the 
NGO coordinators and chief executives and SMs as below: 
  Orientation of NGO coordinators and chief executives: One six-day workshop will 
be conducted for the coordinators of NGO and their chief executives/executive 
committee chairs on the Programme concept, theory of change, its activities, 
implementation modalities and roles of different actors including the NGOs, issues 
of inclusion, their reporting requirements and performance evaluation. The 
workshop will be conducted by the PCO with HSI support; 
  Orientation of SMs: Orientation courses of two days each will be conducted for the 
SMs recruited by the NGOs on how to assess groups and co-operatives prior to 
developing capacity building strategies, social mobilisation, value chain 
development and business planning, respectively. The modules will be repeated 
after the Programme MTR. As there will be 50 SMs between the 10 NGOs, the 
courses will be delivered in two batches of 25 participants each. 
o  Strengthening farmer groups: Once mobilised, groups need to be provided adequate 
capacity building inputs so that they will not only function effectively without external props 
and financial support but also grow over time to attain larger goals for their members. These 
pertain to housekeeping functions, such as accounting and keeping minutes that promote 
transparency and trust; group dynamics, such as setting group norms, articulating values, 
defining a shared purpose, conflict resolution and rules of governance that stimulate 
solidarity and cohesion; strategic capacities, such as building a shared vision for the future, 
networking and business development and advocacy to create value for their members. 
Some of these capabilities are developed in the course of interaction/facilitation by 
141 Registration is done under a 2034 (1977) law applicable to all kinds of civil society organisations. They can work outside the district of 
registration by setting up a project office or registering a local branch with a local executive committee. 
142 This is to ensure that NGOs do not quote low budgets and are then unable to recruit and retain quality SMs. 
143 The populations and number of Wards differ considerably across districts and the coverage of households and Wards is likely to vary 
considerably. This may get further skewed due to road access, distance from markets opportunities for value chain development. The number of 
SMs per district would be adjusted once the SIPs are available. 
120

promoters during regular group meetings144 in the early stages while others require formal, 
off-group training using appropriate pedagogies, including games, films, role plays, etc. The 
group development and training schedule and training materials will be developed through 
the TA support specified earlier. These will also feed into the capacity building of the SMs. 
While the exact number of off-line training events will be specified by the TA provider145, two 
have been budgeted as below: 
  Membership training: The objective of membership training is to stimulate 
behaviours among group members that enhance group cohesiveness, solidarity 
and efficiency. Through games, role plays, storytelling and discussions, it 
stimulates members to individually and collectively reflect on the utility and benefits 
of working as groups, articulate the need for norms of member behaviour vis-à-vis 
the group and other members, group values, mutuality, active listening and 
participation in group meetings, need for and systems of transparency, etc. Two 
events of two days each have been planned for all the groups. The training will be 
conducted by the SMs using the training modules developed by the TA provider; 
Leadership training: The objective is to develop strategic capabilities of groups; 
develop resource persons in groups; introduce ideas of participatory planning, 
vision building and decision making; build capacity for conflict resolution, 
negotiation, networking and advocacy; knowledge of relevant 
government/regulatory policies; leadership rotation and good governance 
practices, etc. Four events of two days each have been planned at each value 
chain cluster. 
 
o  Consolidation of groups into commodity co-operatives: In order to realise scale of 
economies and enhance bargaining power, facilitate sharing of services, community 
infrastructure and value addition (sorting, grading, packaging and minor processing), the 
groups will be consolidated into co-operatives, commodity-wise. It is proposed to form co-
operatives with 150 to 200 members, with possibility of expansion in future as more 
households join the respective value chains. Consolidation will be initiated when groups 
have stabilised and expanded as more groups mature in the specific commodity. 
Consolidation around commodities is proposed as services, market linkages, credit delivery 
and value addition (sorting, grading, packaging) opportunities will be commodity-specific. 
Co-operative formation will begin in the second year, expand as new clusters/groups 
develop and will be completed by the fifth year so that the last of the co-operatives have 
time to settle down before Programme completion. As co-operatives are legal entities 
governed by the Co-operatives Act and have to have more elaborate record keeping, 
accounting, audit and reporting requirements than farmer’s groups and the regulatory 
framework itself is slated to undergo changes under the new Constitution of Nepal146, it will 
be necessary to bring on board domain expertise to consolidate groups into new co-
operatives and build their self-management capacity. It is proposed to seek the assistance 
of a national organisation experienced in forming and strengthening co-operatives through a 
TA to assist the PCO and NGOs consolidate the groups into commodity co-operatives. The 
investments proposed as follows: 
 
TA for the consolidation of groups into commodity co-operatives: A national 
organisation with experience in forming and developing co-operatives147 will be 
144 Participation of group promoter/facilitator in the first few (about six) meetings to stimulate discussion/reflection among group members 
(discretely and without imposition/interference) about the functioning of the group and members’ behaviour plays a critical role in group 
development. 
145 Those pertaining to business development would be included in value chain development. 
146 Under the new Constitution of Nepal powers regarding cooperative institutions are in the State-levell, Local as well as concurrent lists, i.e. all 
three levels of government have powers to make laws regarding cooperatives. A Bill to amend the existing Cooperatives Act is presently before 
the Parliament. 
147 This is described in Output 3.1.

 
contracted to work closely with the PCO, HSI and NGOs to form and develop 
commodity co-operatives; 
Preparing detailed plans for consolidating groups into co-operatives: The TA 
provider in consultation with the PCO, HSI and NGOs will map out the status of 
groups across clusters and commodities and develop plans for consolidation, 
identifying groups that will be brought together under one co-operative; 
  Community discussions on group/co-operative consolidation: The SM and PCO 
(IDS) will, with guidance from the TA provider, hold discussions with the leaders 
and members of the groups, explaining the rationale for and benefits from forming 
larger entities as co-operatives and prepare the ground for the TA provider to help 
the groups form themselves into co-operatives. The TA provider will draw up the 
by-laws with the participation of members; help form the executive of the co-
operative and its various sub-committees; help the co-operative get registered with 
appropriate authorities; help set up internal systems, including with respect to 
induction of new members, conduct of meetings, planning, making business and 
investment decisions, savings and loans activities, financial and social audit, 
periodic elections to the executive, etc.; help recruit and train accountants/record 
keepers, help identify auditors and hand-hold the co-operative for a year till it 
becomes stable and capable of managing itself. The executive committee of the 
co-operatives will have at least 50 per cent women and at least one Dalit and one 
Janajati as members and at least one of the three office bearers will be a woman. 
In a nutshell, the TA provider will be responsible to facilitate and nurture the co-
operative into an efficiently run ‘going business’ that is socially inclusive in its 
composition and is accountable to its stakeholders; 
  Consolidated group/co-operative support: Small lump-sum support will be provided 
to each co-operative to meet initial establishment expenses and training costs. 
Implementation Arrangements. Recruitment of international TA to design group development 
54. 
strategy and national TA to carry out consolidation of groups into co-operatives will be done by the 
PCO, based on specified ToR148 (draft ToR provided in Appendix 4, Annex 3). 
55.  The orientation of the Governments at the State and Municipalities will be conducted by the 
PCO with the participation of  HSI. The workshop for the State Government will be at the State capital 
where as those for the Municipal Governments will be conducted in each of the respective District 
Headquarters. PCO will seek the support of the HVAC staff and IFAD Country Office. 
56.  Mobilising and organising the farmers into groups will be done by the SMs of respective NGOs 
for the districts under the overall supervision of the NGO coordinator with the support and guidance of  
HSI, the IDS and AIDS. The SMs will use the methodologies and tools developed by the provider of 
Institutional Development TA. 
57.  The orientation of NGOs and SMs will be done jointly by the PCO and HSI using local trainers 
where necessary. The respective sector specialists at the PCO will anchor the orientation of the SMs 
concerning their domains. For example, the IDS will anchor the orientation pertaining to assessment 
of groups and social mobilisation. 
58.  Exposure and study tours will be organised by the PCO with guidance from the provider of the 
Institutional Development TA and IFAD Country Office. Training of group members will be conducted 
by the AIDSs in their respective road corridors with HSI support, using the training material developed 
by the Institutional Development TA. Plans for consolidation of groups into commodity co-operatives 
will be prepared jointly by the provider of TA for consolidation, the PCO/Road Corridor office and the 
concerned NGO. 
59.  Phasing of Activities. Programme activities will be initiated in eight of the 10 districts in the first 
and second years. Sub-component 4 activities will be initiated in Dolpa and Humla initially, integrating 
148 Drafts have been presented as Annex 2.

the remaining activites after expansion of the road network to these districts.  Orientation of the State 
and Municipal Governments will be the first activity of ASDP soon after the PCO is set up and staffed 
so that governments are on board as implementation begins on the ground. Recruitment of TA 
provider for institution development will be done in parallel with recruitment of NGOs so that NGO 
coordinators are on board before the TA assignment is completed and the TA provider can conduct a 
Training of Trainers (ToT) programme for the IDS, AIDSs and NGO coordinators; they will conduct the 
ToTs for the SMs. The task of consolidation of FGs into co-operatives will begin only in the second 
year once an adequate number of FGs have reached a level of stability in each of the value chains. 
The TA for consolidation of FGs into co-operatives will come on board in the second year and will 
remain engaged till closure. The indicative phasing of activities is presented in Table 5 below.

percent of participants in POs are women, ASDP will ensure that at least two-thirds of the group and 
co-operative members are women and at least 50 percent members of executive committees in the 
co-operatives are women and at least one of the three office bearers in the FGs and co-operatives is 
a woman. ASDP will also ensure representation of Dalit, Janajati and poorest of the poor households 
in groups and co-operatives is at least proportionate to their population. ASDP encourage formation of 
all women groups.

63.  The key result of the activity (besides enhanced income, monitored elsewhere) are the ability of 
poor farmers to participate in value chains, ability of farmer collectives to independently negotiate 
profitable contracts with traders/aggregators, sharing of services (collective marketing, collective 
procurement of inputs, sharing of assets/services, contracts with service providers), graduation up the 
value chain (own transport, storage, diversification into related activities, value addition activities), 
development of leadership among women/Dalits/Janajatis, capital formation (corpus with co-
operatives), access to financial services and advocacy. Some of the outcome indicators are: 
 
 
Number of poor/Dalit/Janajati farmers participating in value chains; 
Co-operatives negotiating value chain contracts independently,

value of their produce as farm-gate price, higher incomes, acquisition of assets and reduction in 
hungry periods.

and Co-operatives: In the context of federal governance under the new Constitution of Nepal, ASDP 
support to farmers and farmer groups for value chain development would be planned and provisioned 
through the budgets of Local Bodies149 and channelized through the Wards, the grassroots level rung 
of government and the lowest level of budget disbursement. The first elections to the Local Bodies, 
however, were held only in May 2017 and there will be by-elections to fill vacancies caused due to the 
election of some of the elected Local Body and Ward representatives to the Executive of the District 
Coordination Committees (DCC)150. An Act to spell out procedures to be followed by Local Bodies for 
the conduct of their business is yet to be passed by the Parliament151, elections to State Assemblies 
are yet to be held152 and the process of placement of staff is yet to be completed153.  
In accordance with current MoF decisions, the PCO would be the “Cost Centre” for 
66. 
disbursement of funds to beneficiaries and/or implementing agencies. While MoF regulations require 
that the loan financing of resulting investments flow through the ASDP, the Programme will revise its 
disbursement strategies in accordance with prevailing GoN regulations, including devolution of 
conditional funding for activities implemented by the municipality, on completion of a fiduciary due 
diligence of the municipality as a cost center.  
67.  The approval of ASDP Investment Plans (IPs)  by Local Body (Municipal) Executives would be 
based on the recommendations of the Municipal Agriculture Unit (MAU) in response to competitive 
farmer group IPs that have undergone a bipartisan Field Verification by the Ward-level Community 
Agriculture Extension Service Centres (CAESCs) and PCO/HSI technical/administration teams154. 
Once Ward-level IPs have been prioritised and approved by the MAU in accordance with the budget 
limits set by the PCO, that Unit would forward the IPs to the Local Body (Municipal) Executive for no-
objection and subsequent request to the ASDP Project Coordinator (PC) for financing. The IPs would 
be included in the ASDP result-based annual work programme and budget (RB-AWPB), and, the PCO 
would prepare a quadripartite contract (Municipality, Ward, beneficiary and PCO) on which basis the 
PC would release funds to contract-identified beneficiaries.  
68.  The underlying process for identifying VC-led IPs would be as follows: 
 
A Strategic Investment Plan (SIP) endorsed by Multi-Stakeholder Platforms (MSPs)155 for 
a specific commodity would list the Wards and Local Bodies eligible for ASDP support 
149 Gaon Palika (rural municipality) or Nagar Palika (urban municipality), as the case may be. 
150 As per the Constitution of Nepal, members, Chairpersons and Vice-Chairpersons of the DCC have to be elected by the District Assembly from 
among the members of Local Body and Ward Assemblies, i.e. all elected persons in the Local Bodies and Wards. Those elected to the DCC 
cease to retain their elected positions in the Local Bodies/Wards and By-Elections would be held to fill these vacancies. 
151 The Ministry of Federal Affairs and Local Development (MOFALD) issued guidelines in June 2017 regarding the procedures to be followed at 
the level of Local Bodies for the current financial year for the conduct of local government business whereby the executive powers are to be 
exercised by the relevant administrative staff till the elected executives take charge. 
152 Following elections, the Provincial Governments would also presumably formulate policies and procedures for the functioning of the Local 
Bodies as they would also be providing budgetary support to them. 
153 The MOFALD guidelines referred above specify the number of staff to be appointed at the Local Body and Ward levels and also requires that 
the personnel from various line agencies previously working at these levels must now report to the newly elected bodies but the transition has not 
yet been completed. 
155 Chairpersons/Mayors and their deputies from the concerned Local Bodies would participate in the MSP so that the selected commodity chains 
have their endorsement.

based on viability criteria. Also, based on the endorsed SIP, the PCO will, on a 
competitive basis, select Lead Entrepreneurs (LE) or Value Chain Gate Keepers for co-
financing for specific commodity VCs. Once the eligible Wards/Local Bodies and LEs are 
known for a specific commodity VC, the process of selecting Groups/Co-operatives for 
competitive co-financing under ASDP would be initiated through a PCO call for 
investment proposals (IPs) from farmer groups/co-operatives through local and national 
newspapers, local FM radio and notices at the concerned Ward, Local Body and DCC 
offices. The call for IPs would specify the eligibility criteria and terms of financing. As 
outlined in Sub-component 4, Local Bodies (municipalities) would be informed through 
workshops facilitated by the HSI team, Social Mobilisers (SM) engaged by HSI/ Local 
Service Providers (LSP)156 and the project teams about the provision for competitive co-
financing of groups and co-operatives under the Programme, the eligibility criteria and 
the terms of financing. The social mobilizers (SM) for the concerned Local Bodies will 
give wide publicity regarding the call for proposals to groups, co-operatives, CAESCs 
and MAUs in the concerned Local Bodies. Templates for submission of IPs will be made 
available at the concerned Ward offices of the concerned Local Bodies; 
The HSI team, Programme’s road corridor  mobile teams, business development service 
providers and SM will assist the interested groups and co-operatives to prepare the IPs 
in the prescribed templates, including requirements for community infrastructure. The 
proposals would be submitted to the mobile teams who would carry out a desk review of 
the IPs and identify IPs for field verification157. A team under the aegis of the CAESC, 
comprising of its technical staff, mobile team member, SM and a representative of the 
proposed private financing institution (PFI)158 would carry out the field verification and 
shortlist viable IPs with necessary modifications in consultation with the proponents and 
send the same to the MAU through the Ward Chairperson. The MAU would review and 
prioritise the submitted IPs in accordance with the budget limits set by the PCO and 
recommend the selected IPs to the Chairperson/Mayor for approval and recommendation 
to the PCO for financing. The PCO would include the recommended IPs in its Results-
based Annual Work Plan and Budget (RB-AWPB). Following budget the approval, a 
quadripartite agreement would be signed between the Group/Co-operative, the Local 
Body, Ward and PCO159 and filed with the PCO with copies to the other three signatories. 
Funds for enterprise investment would then be released by the PCO out of the VCDM, as 
per an agreed tranche schedule, to the bank accounts of the Group/Co-operative for 
disbursement to the members with information to the Local Body, Ward,  PFI and LE 
(where relevant). Where relevant, funds for investment in community infrastructure would 
be released by the PCO out of the Market-led Infrastructure Fund to the Local Body with 
information to the concerned Groups/Co-operatives and Wards; 
The CAESC, the road corridor  mobile teams and SM would, under HSI guidance provide 
implementation support to the Group/Co-operative and monitor implementation progress. 
The supported Group/Co-operative will furnish periodic reports to the PCO with copies to 
the Ward and Local Body as per the contract. Releases of further instalments, if any, 
would be made by the PCO on the recommendation of the CAESC. A project completion 
report will be filed by the Group/Co-operative to the PCO, Local Body and Ward once the 
planned investments have been completed. 
 
 
156 The PCO and  HSIwill jointly recruit suitable LSPs to carry out the social mobilization and group/cooperative development activities under  
HSIguidance and supervision. These may be local NGOs. Where suitable LSPs are not available,  HSI will directly recruit SMs, thereby assuming 
the role of the LSP. 
157 This responsibility may be transferred to the MAU (with support from the project team and HELETAS during the ASDP tenure) once it has been 
set up and adequately capacitated. 
158 The PFI would come into picture where the IP includes loans for financing a part of the investment. 
159 Over time, as the financial management and reporting capabilities and communication infrastructure develop at the level of the Local Bodies, 
funds for the IPs included in their Annual Plans (approved IPs) may be transferred to them for release to concerned IP proponents with 
responsibility for M&E and audit.

Agriculture Sector Development Programme 
Final programme design report 
Appendix 4:  Detailed Programme description 
69.  Output 4.2. Women’s empowerment and household nutrition. The objective of this output 
is to empower women, particularly within their household, and, through that process to enable 
them as managers of household agricultural development and growth, and family nutrition. This 
output has two activities: (i) women’s empowerment; and (ii) household nutrition. 
o  Women’s empowerment. Socially, women and girls in Nepal are disadvantaged by 
traditional practices like the dowry system, early marriage, son-preference, 
stigmatization of widows, seclusion of women (purdah), family violence, polygamy, 
and the segregation of women and girls during menstruation (chhaupadi). The post-
conflict Government has been legislating for more gender equality: Nepal was the first 
country in Asia to develop a National Action Plan on Women Peace and Security in 
2011 and women and girls’ rights are protected in the Comprehensive Peace Accord. 
Women nevertheless face an onerous triple burden as their role of caretaker is taken 
for granted and thus the economic contribution goes largely unnoticed. The 
Programme will begin to address these issues through the following actions: 
  A Gender and social inclusion (GESI) action plan will assess the overall 
situation of women farmers, evaluate disaggregated information on the 
extent of agriculture extension service outreach, and assess the existing 
institutional mechanism and capacity needs of the executing 
agencies/implementing agencies on GESI; 
  Drudgery reduction technology: The Programme will carry out a study 
assessing the various technologies that are available for reducing women’s 
drudgery to come up with simple and reasonably priced toolkits that can be 
distributed as a pilot Programme to some of the women groups. These 
toolkits can be used either at the farm level or the household level and will 
primarily address the reduction of drudgery and to free up valuable time of 
the women. The toolkits can be used in the groups with a small fee for 
maintenance. The Programme will also construct multipurpose water 
infrastructure. This will serve the irrigation, washing and safe drinking 
water needs of the community and will decrease the time women and girl 
children spend in fetching water; 
  Household Methodology: The Programme will implement the Household 
Methodology (HHM) as a pilot in about 4,000 households initially. As part 
of the HHM process, household members realize that inequalities in 
gender roles and relations can be part of the reason they stay poor. Hence, 
a household’s ability to understand the causes of their current situation – 
and their willingness to act upon the findings – is crucial for unlocking a 
household’s potential. The HHM approach, which will be tailored to fit 
cultural norms in the Programme area is expected to include the following 
elements: (i) Focus on people. - household strategies are designed by and 
for household members who define who they want to be and what they 
want to do. They define and implement their own strategies for developing 
and improving their livelihoods, based on their goals, strengths, 
opportunities and assets; (ii) Empowerment - the cornerstone of the HHM 
empowerment process is strengthening the capacity of individuals or 
groups to make choices and to transform those choices into desired 
actions and outcomes. This can be achieved by building on a mutual 
understanding of different roles and responsibilities; (iii) Self-generated 
solutions - willingness to change is generated by household members 
themselves (women and men of all ages) by placing them in the driver’s 
seat of the development process. They take responsibility for the changes 
they want to see and work closely with one another, friends and the 
community to make them happen; and (iv) Equal opportunities. Women 
and men, as well as youth, people with disabilities and other vulnerable 
128 
Nepal 
Agriculture Sector Development Programme

Appendix 4:  Detailed programme description 
groups, have an equal voice in setting the household vision and equal 
access to development opportunities, productive assets, decision-making 
and benefits;  
  Engendering trainings, capacity building and communication: The 
Programme will adopt the following guidelines for making trainings and 
capacity building gender sensitive: (i) adapt programmes to women's 
needs and skills; (ii) ensure that the training venue is accessible and safe 
for women and can accommodate children who are under their care if 
required; (iii) allow sufficient time to enable women to acquire new skills 
and adjust schedules to fit women's existing workloads; (iv) adapt the time 
of the trainings to the time availability of the women; (v) ensure that the 
language is simple and catered towards the understanding levels of the 
participants; (vi) make all teaching methods and learning approaches 
inclusive, participatory and “gender transformatory” in order to ensure 
women's full and equal participation; (vii) use trainers who are not only 
technically competent and up-to-date, but who empathise with the needs 
and aspirations of rural women; and (viii) produce messages in written, 
oral, and visual media, targeted to women farmers and presented by 
women announcers and performers to supplement face-to-face extension 
efforts. 
o  Household nutrition. A Multi-Sectoral Nutrition Plan (MSNP) 2013-2017 serves as a 
common results framework for improving nutrition outcomes; and setting out plans of 
action for implementing nutrition-sensitive policies and strategies for key sectors, 
including agriculture. The Programme proposes to support supply side nutrition 
interventions through homestead gardens for disadvantaged households and the 
evaluation of nutrition-sensitive value chains and the demand side through farmer 
nutrition schools and nutrition behavioural change communication (BCC). 
  Theory of Change for Nutrition: The theory of change identifies the 
pathway applicable for the chosen intervention and defines the activity 
promoted and how this activity leads to better nutritional outcomes. There 
are two critical mediators of impact across the three pathways. First, 
women’s empowerment and gender equality. Given the implications of 
women’s time allocation, decision making and control over resources for 
household nutrition, as well as their own health and nutritional status being 
crucial for child nutrition, women’s empowerment and gender equality are 
essential for catalysing the effects of these pathways. Second, nutrition 
awareness. Without nutrition awareness and appropriate knowledge and 
practices, increases in income and production will have limited effects on 
changing food choices and diets, and so, limited impact on improving 
nutrition. Behaviour change communication, nutrition education and 
information are essential to turn changes in production and income into 
changes in consumption – eating and feeding habits. The importance of 
nutrition education and behaviour change communication counts for the 
entire family and should not be limited to women and girls only. The 
nutrition education component needs to be very explicit on the 
improvement of maternal nutrition and nutrition of adolescent girls. 
  Supply-side nutrition interventions: The Programme will support poor Dalit 
and women-headed households to develop homestead gardens producing 
traditional food crops like nettles, garden cress, traditional tubers, etc. that 
can be grown in small patches of land to supplement diets160. Where 
required, this will be supported by multi-purpose water supply. The 
160  HSI has developed and successfully applied this model in Nepal. 
129 
Nepal 
Agriculture Sector Development Programme 
Final programme design report 
Appendix 4:  Detailed Programme description 
Programme will, as part of the SIP process, also evaluate the market 
potential for nutritious crops including buckwheat, minor millets, upland 
beans and the orange-fleshed sweet potato.   
  Demand-side nutrition interventions: HVAP value chain beneficiaries have 
doubled their household income. In Nepal, higher income, in combination 
with nutrition interventions and gender equality (allocation of the family 
budget and informed decision making on food purchase and dietary 
pattern) leads better household nutrition outcomes. The Programme will 
support the regional training and health information departments to expand 
and intensify their implementation of BCC activities, which uses various 
media and methods and is based on local needs161. The BCC programme, 
which will target women and adolescent girls, will be supported by 
household “nutrition schools,” held every two months, which will be 
facilitated by ASDP gender, nutrition and social mobilisers and the GoN 
health department. Those nutrition schools will cover nutritious food 
production and collection, and food preparation storage and processing to 
retain nutritional value and assure food safety. This will be supported by a 
pilot No Junk Food Campaign, to be conducted in a number of villages with 
the technical support of the health department.   
  Staffing: The Programme will recruit a Health and Nutrition Specialist at the 
PCO, who will report to the Gender and Social Inclusion Specialist. This 
position will be for the full duration of the Programme. The Health and 
Nutrition Specialist will be overall responsible to ensure that the health and 
nutrition interventions are managed and implemented effectively and 
efficiently. This position will ensure that all BCC/nutrition education 
interventions will be in line with the government mandated messages and 
the Programme team to be trained in basic nutrition and nutrition-sensitive 
agriculture and the strong linkages between gender and nutrition. At the 
field level, there will be Gender, Nutrition Social Mobilisers in each Ward 
who will be the main conduit for all the gender and nutrition related 
interventions. This position will be recruited from the village/Ward itself and 
preferably should be female. A total of 60 per cent women social mobilisers 
should be recruited for this position. 
  Monitoring and Evaluation: The current anchor indicator for nutrition is 
“reduced prevalence of childhood malnutrition”. IFAD is addressing all 
forms of malnutrition but the main focus is on chronic undernutrition 
(stunting). Acknowledging that stunting is a result of a combination of 
various underlying causes (food security, care for women and children, and 
environmental health), IFAD’s investments have limitations in addressing 
stunting in its complexity. The current indicator, therefore, cannot really 
reflect on achievements in nutrition. To aid in identifying an indicator, there 
will be a Minimum Dietary Diversity for Women (MDD-W) study carried out 
to establish the baseline for ASDP. This study will identify the new 
indicators for the Programme and recommendations for the integration of 
specific nutrition interventions apart from the ones designed. This will be 
carried out once a year throughout the duration of the Programme to track 
the nutrition levels of women and girls in the reproductive age groups.   
o  Youth interventions in ASDP. The community-based market infrastructure activity will 
be supported by youth-and women-targeted vocational training in skills that could be 
quickly applied through the community infrastructure investments. Presently there is a 
thrust to increase the skills in vocational training across the country and led by the 
161 Behaviour change communication (BCC) is an interactive process of any intervention with individuals, communities and/or societies 
(as integrated with an overall program) to develop communication strategies to promote positive behaviours which are appropriate to their 
settings. This is not to be confused with nutrition education. 
130

government through various donors. Youth targeting will be a two-pronged approach. 
The interventions will target both educated and uneducated youth. The Programme 
will facilitate the trainings with relevant training institutions and identify eligible youth. 
The World Bank Programme Enhanced Vocational Education and Training 
Programme (EVENT), currently being designed for its second phase, provides grants 
for vocational training in government accredited institutions. It is the responsibility of 
the organisation providing/facilitating the training to assure job placement to the 
trainees after the training. The Programme will identify such training where 
employment will be easily available in the rural areas If required, the Programme 
should also re design training curriculums to suit the demands of the profession eg: for 
the Junior Technician Assistants (JTAs), a sub course on entrepreneurship will enable 
the trainees to become more business oriented. 
  Educated youth who are interested in becoming Junior Technician 
 
Assistants in agriculture or livestock will be provided with training and 
certification through credited courses offered by the government approved 
certification courses.  Other opportunities for educated youth include lab 
assistants, local resource persons etc.  For the uneducated youth, 
opportunities lie in developing skills in community infrastructure related 
training. The youth can be trained in on-the-job vocational training, which 
could focus on such skills as concreting, carpentry, road levelling and 
surfacing, brick laying, semi-skilled machine operation, painting and public 
infrastructure maintenance. A quota of 25 per cent will be kept for women 
and 20 per cent for Dalit, Janajati and Muslims for all vocational trainings.  
It is seen in the present Programme that the Social Mobilisers spend up to 
25 per cent of their time in data entry for the Programme demands. This 
significantly reduces their time to be spent productively in the villages. To 
aid in the collection and entry of data, the Programme will introduce an 
internship component whereby young educated youth who have either 
passed high school or who are in school can be paid a small stipend to 
help the Programme collect data. This could also be done by the LRPs, 
JTAs, etc. for a small fee. Not only will the collection of data be expedited, 
but the people involved will also become part of the Programme earning a 
small income. High school girls can be taken on board as the income can 
go towards their higher education and other essentials that need financing.  
o  Women in construction: The Programme will ensure the safety and security of women 
who will work as construction workers in the infrastructure component. Prior to building 
the infrastructure, a robust social and environmental assessment will take place. This 
assessment will look at all gender concerns and map out social constraints. The 
assessment will be taken very seriously in the implementation of the infrastructure. 
The African Development Bank has come up with a set of guidelines162 that will be 
applied while implementing the infrastructure component. 
o  Staffing: At the village level, the Gender and Nutrition Social Mobiliser will be 
responsible for all tasks related to health, nutrition and the household methodology. At 
the PCO level, there will be a Gender and Social Inclusion Specialist who will lead the 
process. This position will be filled with an experienced Gender Specialist of not less 
than 7 years of experience. This position will be supported by a Health and Nutrition 
Specialist and a Household Methodology Specialist. Terms of reference are provided 
at the end of this document. The Programme will recruit a higher number of female 
Gender and Nutrition Social Mobilisers – at least 60 per cent of them will be women 
and will be recruited from the villages where they will work as mobilisers. They will be

techniques. The Gender and Nutrition Social Mobilisers will be the main conduit for the 
social aspects of the Programme. 
Programme preparatory stage 
70.  The Programme will ensure that the Women’s Empowerment Index and the Minimum 
Dietary Diversity for Women will be carried out prior to the development of the Gender Equality 
and Social Inclusion Strategy and Action Plan (GESISAP). The GESISAP will be built on the 
information and recommendations emerging from the two studies. ToRs are detailed in Annex 3 
below. 
71.  Women’s Empowerment Index: A gender specialist will be engaged for technical 
assistance for about 2-person months to carry out the Women’s Empowerment Index in the 
operational areas to understand the present status of the women and to identify 
recommendations that can be included in the Gender Equality and Social Inclusion Strategy and 
Action Plan (GESISAP). 
72.  Women Minimum Dietary Diversity: The Programme will apply, as a baseline for the 
ASDP, the FAO tool on Measuring Women’s Dietary Diversity,163 which focuses on women in the 
reproductive age groups of 15 – 49 years. This age group is nutritionally vulnerable because of 
the physiological demands of pregnancy and lactation. Nepal has been able to address the 
1000 golden days for children pregnant and lactating mothers; however, further work is needed 
on adolescent girls and reproductive aged women. Outside of pregnancy and lactation, other 
than for iron, requirements for this age group may be similar to or lower than those of adult men, 
but because women may be smaller and eat less (fewer calories), they require a more nutrient-
dense diet.  The Minimum Dietary Diversity for Women (MDD-W) is a dichotomous indicator of 
whether or not women in reproductive age (WRA 15–49 years) have consumed at least five out 
of ten defined food groups the previous day or night. The proportion of WRA who reach this 
minimum in a population can be used as a proxy indicator for higher micronutrient adequacy, 
one important dimension of diet quality. The recruitment of this position should be made after 
the studies on women’s empowerment and women-minimum dietary diversity will be completed 
in order to be able to include the recommendations in the GESISAP.  
73.  GESI Action Plan: A social development and gender specialist will be engaged for about 
2-person months to undertake gender and social analysis, including preparing the gender and 
social inclusion (GESI) action plan and a budget for gender and social development related 
activities. The gender equality and social inclusion action plan will assess the overall situation of 
women farmers, disaggregated information on the extent of agriculture extension service 
outreach, and assess the existing institutional mechanism and capacity needs of the executing 
agencies/implementing agencies on GESI. The recruitment of this position should be made after 
the studies on women’s empowerment and minimum dietary diversity will be completed in order 
to be able to include the recommendations in the GESISAP.  If possible, the same person will be 
able to do the Women’s Empowerment Index as well as the GESISAP.

Value Chain Analysis of Opportunities and Constraints Table Guidance Notes: 
The Framework 
Situational analysis: What are the current circumstances? 
Constraints to Upgrading: What problems and issues have the actors described 
Opportunities for upgrading: What does ASDP offer to address the constraint(s) identified? 
Structural Elements 
End market: Describe where the final transaction takes place, including location, buyer characteristics, price and quality. Also consider emerging trends and preferences, regulatory changes 
Business enabling environment: Description of the financial, technical and social services and supporting public and collective rural infrastructure 
Vertical linkages: Are there examples “up the chain” of mutually beneficial relationships between the actors e.g. sharing of quantity and value information, promotion of quality standards, additional 
services offered by lead firms (e.g. supplier credit, working capital loans, leasing services) 
Horizontal  linkages:  Are  there  examples  of  formal  or  informal  cooperative  arrangements  among  firms  at  each  level  that  involve  interdependence,  trust  and  resource  pooling  in  order  to  jointly 
accomplish common goals. Examples could include: bulk purchase of inputs and services, collective learning, new marketing strategies, pooling resources  
Supporting  markets:    Is  there  evidence  of  or  potential  for  services  in  support  or  VC  activities?  Examples  include:  financial  (lending,  leasing),  Cross-cutting  services  (business  advice, 
communications, advertising); and, sector specific (equipment supply, veterinary services, design services) 
Dynamic Elements 
VC governance: Describe the relationships among the buyers, sellers, service providers and regulatory institutions that operate within or influence the range of activities required to bring a product 
or service from inception to its end use. 
Inter-firm relationships: Is there any evidence for relationships: supportive (mutually beneficial, repeated, voluntary); adversarial; and/or social

Changes in governance due to upgrading [Add text here…] 
[Text] 
Value Chain Governance Guidance Note: 
The purpose of this section is twofold. 
The  first  element  is  a  description  of  the  VC  governance.  Value  chain  governance  refers  to  the  relationships  among  the 
buyers, sellers, service providers and regulatory institutions that operate within or influence the range of activities required to 
bring a product or service from inception to its end use. Governance is about power and the ability to exert control along the 
chain  –  at  any  point  in  the  chain,  some  firm  (or  organization  or  institution)  sets  and/or  enforces  parameters  under  which 
others in the chain operate. Governance arrangements help in determining / understanding a range of aspects including: the 
acquisition of production capability, market access, how to influence the distribution of gains and where leverage exists for 
policy change.  
The  table  included  above  is  designed  to  assist  in  thinking  through  the  governance  of  the  commodity  in  question  and 
describing the existing situation. Adapt as required 
The second element is an assessment of how the upgrading strategies defined above in the analysis of opportunities and 
constraints may change these governance arrangements.

The Government of Nepal (GoN) is implementing a Value Chain (VC) Development programme 
titled  Agriculture  Sector  Development  Programme  (ASDP)  in  60  selected  municipalities  (rural  and 
predominantly rural) across all 10 districts of Province 6State 6. The programme is supported by the 
Internal  Fund  for  Agriculture  Development  (IFAD),  GoN  and  contributions  from  the  participating 
farmers.  ASDP  will  scale  up  the  approach  methodologies  developed  to  promote  agricultural  value 
chains and link poor farmers to such VCs to enable them to enhance their incomes in the course of 
another  IFAD  supported  GoN  programme  called  the  High  Value  Agricultural  Programme  (HVAP) 
being implemented in the erstwhile Mid-western Development Region. 
ASDP  has  developed  a  strategic  investment  plan  (SIP)  that  has  identified  several  commodity 
4. 
VCs for development in Province 6State 6 based on local agro-ecological parameters and presence of 
road  networks.  Several  geographic  pockets  have  been  identified  as  potential  production  clusters  for 
specific VCs. ASDP envisages organising farmers with potential to produce specified commodities in 
the  selected  clusters  into  small  groups,  link  them  to  the  relevant  commodity  VC  as  producer 
organisations (PO) and develop the capabilities of the POs to function as self-reliant and autonomous 
organisations and eventually be graduated and consolidated into commodity cooperatives.

INTRODUCTION  
1. 
Government of Nepal (G0N) has received loan and grant to implement the  Agriculture Sector 
Development  Programme  (ASDP),  with  financial  assistance  from  the  International  Fund  for 
Agriculture  Development  (IFAD).  A  Part  of  this  financial  assistance  is  to  be  used  for  hiring  firm  for 
consultancy  services  for  Feasibility,  Design  and  Supervision  of  the  sub-component  2:  Market-
oriented public and community infrastructure functional.  
2. 
The  ASDP  is  a  follow-up  to  the  High  Value  Agriculture  Project  in  Hill  and  Mountain  Areas 
(HVAP). The justification for the ASDP stems from a number of elements: (i) a favourable policy and 
institutional framework originated by the new  Constitution of Nepal and the 2014 ADS, which places 
greater  emphasis  on  market  (value  chain)-driven  agriculture  development;  (ii)  a  significant  stock  of 
knowledge on value chain development produced by a number of Programmes, most of which will be 
completed during 2018, as a source of good practices and lessons learnt for this new operation; and 
(iii)  the  opportunity  of  scaling  up  the  HVAP  approach  through  its  replication  of  proven  value  chain 
interventions  in  a  larger,  including  more  remote,  geographic  area  (enabled  by  improved  rural 
infrastructure, notably the expanding district road corridors) and by further expanding the outreach of 
the activities underway, while ensuring the sustainability of development results.  
the 
(i) Chhinchu-Jajarkot–Dolpa; 
3. 
The  Programme  would  be  implemented  in  Surkhet,  Dailekh,  Salyan,  Jajarkot,  Kalikot,  Jumla, 
Mugu, Dolpa, Humla and Rukum (western) districts in State 6 of Nepal. The four highlighted districts 
are  incremental  to  the  HVAP  area  and  would  be  integrated  into  the  Programme  in  line  with  the 
development  of 
(iii) Surkhet- 
Dalilekh  road  corridors;  and  (iv) Mid-hill  highway.  The  Programme  would  commence  immediately  in 
the  six  existing  HVAP  districts  and  in  Mugu  and  Rukum.  Only  sub-component  4  activities  will 
commence  initially  in  with  Dolpa  and  Humla  and  the  remaining  activities  will  commenced  as  road 
access improves in these districts. The Programme Coordination Office (PCO) would continue to be 
based  at  Birendranagar  in  Surkhet  district,  while  three  corridor-based  coordination  units  would  be 
established  for  technical  backstopping,  field  level  coordination  and  programme  monitoring  and 
supervision. 
(ii) Surkhet-Kalikot-Jumla-Mugu; 
4. 
The  Programme  would  target  smallholder  farmers  and  landless  rural  people  (value  chain 
labour, small livestock, etc.) interested to engage in targeted value chain activities. HVAP experience 
indicates that this is a very inclusive process with most households in HVAP-supported hamlets and 
villages progressively participating in value-chain linked production and processing activities. Women 
would  form  2/3rds  of  the  Programme  beneficiaries  and  disadvantaged  households  including  Dalits, 
Janajatis, Muslims, youth, landless and other disadvantaged groups would be specifically targeted for 
Programme  inclusion  (25 per  cent  target).  The  Programme  would  develop  specific  mechanisms  for 
poor  households  to  be  able  to  join  appropriate  value  chains,  however,  poor  and  marginalised 
households would also benefit from expanding local agriculture employment opportunities associated 
with  value  chain-driven  growth.  It  is  expected  that  the  ASDP  would  serve  around  35,000  direct 
beneficiaries  (producers  households  and  agri-industry  entrepreneurs  and  employees)  and  around 
40,000  indirect  household  beneficiaries  (through  public  infrastructure,  financial  services  and 
agricultural services development). 
The Programme would have two components: (i) Value chain development, and (ii) Programme

Component 1,  Value  chain  Development,  would  include  four  outcomes:  (i) Inclusive  and

infrastructure  established;  (iii) Rural 
(iv) Agriculture  services  sustainably  support

Outcome 2. Market-oriented public and community infrastructure functional 
7. 
Output 2.1.  The  Programme  would  allocate  funds  for  market-linked  infrastructure  investments 
that  provide  public  goods  and  collective166  benefits  essential  to  the  successful  development  of 
targeted  commodity  value  chain  engagement  and/or  climate  change  adaptation.  Public  or  collective 
market-linked  infrastructure  investment  schemes  would  be  identified  and  prioritized  through:  (i) the 
SIP/MSP  process;  (ii) subsequent  participatory  community  planning;  and  (iii) their  alignment  with 
Municipality infrastructure plans. Investments could include, inter alia, village and farm access roads, 
commodity storage, ponds, small-scale irrigation and multi-purpose village water supply. As this is a 
demand driven process, there is the likelihood that communities, MSPs and  SIPs  would  identify  the 
need for other types of infrastructure that have not been anticipated here. The Programme would be 
structured  to  cater  for  innovative  demands  as  they  emerge.  For  public  infrastructure  (village  roads, 
trails, markets, etc.) funds would be transferred to Municipalities as tagged conditional block grants for 
municipalities  to  implement  with  Programme  support.  Collective  goods  infrastructure  would  be 
primarily  built  through  community  action  unless  their  scale  or  complexity  required  contracting.  All 
infrastructure  investments  would  be  climate  change  adaptive.  In  line  with  the  Local  Infrastructure

Infrastructure  construction  would  use  a  mix  of  labour  intensive  methodologies  and  machinery 
as appropriate. Local government and design engineers would determine the best mix of community 
labour  and  machinery,  as  allowed  by  law.  The  selection  of  irrigation  and  water  supply  development 
would  occur  in  the  high  potential  pockets/cluster  areas  and  would  depend  on  technical  feasibility. 
Rehabilitation and upgrading of irrigation schemes would be prioritised depending on the: (i) number 
of beneficiaries; (ii) value of crops to be grown; (iii) number of disadvantaged communities benefitting; 
(iv) linkage  with  a  commercial  trader  to  buy  the  produce  and  (v) availability  of  road  access.  The 
process for selection and development of local infrastructure is summarised in Table 2. The detailed 
implementation arrangements would be developed in the Programme implementation manual.

10.  Co-financing of construction costs of public and collective goods infrastructure works would be 
in  accordance  with  the  accompanying  Table 3.  Individual  infrastructure  investments  (IFAD 
Component)  exceeding  USD 50,000  would  require  no-objection  from  IFAD.  The  Programme  would, 
wherever  practicable,  use  force  account  processes  for  community  infrastructure  investments, 
designed  to  create  local  jobs,  while  recognising  that  most  major  infrastructure  investments  would 
require some machine support. 
11.  Details of Potential Infrastructure and Technology Investments. The rural hill and mountain 
areas  of  Nepal  are  among  the  least  developed  in  the  country.  Road  and  electricity  connectivity  are 
very  low,  with  some  village  centres  having  neither  road  nor  electricity  access.  Life  for  the  poor  is 
characterised  by  long  hours  of  walking,  carrying  heavy  loads.  Women  spend  long  hours  fetching 
water  and  travelling  to  markets,  or  for  other  government  services.  Development  of  all-year-round 
transportation  services  and  energy  access  can  significantly  improve  the  livelihood  of  rural 
communities.  
12. 
Local  transport  infrastructure  links  production  areas  to  market  centres,  village  roads,  district 
roads or strategic road networks. The infrastructure would follow standards as stipulated in the Nepal 
Rural  Roads  Standards  (2010).  The  Programme  would  develop  transport  links  that  have  the  least 
investment cost. All transport links should be built to consider a 10-year projected traffic volume. The 
design of the link would  aim to achieve the  lowest life cycle costing (cost/km), which  would  include: 
(i) the amortised cost of the investment for the link (new or rehabilitation); (ii) the annual maintenance 
cost; and (iii) any annual operation costs for that link.  
Local  transport  linkages  are  categorised  into  five  classes  based  on  the  function  of  the  link, 
13. 
traffic volume and type, and topography. The three that are relevant to the Programme include:  
  District Road Class B (RRB)  – linking Grade A market to grade C, linking grade B market to 
Grade  C  market,  connecting  VDC(Ward)  centres,  linking  Grade  B  or  C  market  to  SRN  or 
LRN; connecting a place in a village (river ghat, mini-market, school, health post, residential 
area,  forest,  etc.)  with  a  village  centre  or  any  other  road  link.  Village  roads  are  smaller  and 
shorter than RRB roads. The ASDP would invest in RRB roads and village roads that are less 
than  5km  in  length  and  justified  with  linkage  to  significant  production  clusters/pockets  of 
targeted high value commodities; 
  Rural  Road Class C (RRC)  – all major non-motorable foot/mule trails  which connect a VDC 
(Ward)  centre  with  a  district/municipality  headquarters,  SRN,  DRCN,  village  road  and  other 
major  location.  This  class  would  include  trail  bridges.  The  ASDP  would  invest  in  RRC 
infrastructure.  It  is  anticipated  that  the  cost  of  development  would  be  about  USD 700/meter 
for trail bridges; and  
  Rural Road Class E (RRE) – In the high mountains where construction of trails is not feasible, 
rope  ways  shall  be  considered.  The  rope  ways  shall  be  mainly  justifies  based  on  socio-
economic  considerations  but  considering  the  amortised  cost  of  construction,  operation  and 
maintenance. 
14.  The preferred approach is to have the infrastructure prioritised in line with the local government 
planning procedures, considering the main objectives of the Programme. 
15.  Under  the  ASDP,  rural  transport  infrastructure  would  include  motorised  and  non-motorised 
traffic focussing  on  RRB,  village  roads,  RRC  and  RRE  transport  classes.  All  roads  would  fall  under 
the jurisdiction of the local municipality, which would be responsible for managing their construction. 
Priority  would  be  given  to  upgrading  roads  from  fair  weather  access  to  all  year  access,  whilst  new 
roads  may  be  included.  All  village  roads  to  be  upgraded  or  new  development  would  be  part  of  the 
district/municipality transport master plan. The municipality would make an undertaking to co-finance 
the construction and maintain the road after construction, as part of condition for selecting the road.  
16.  Trails and trail bridges  would also be owned by the  municipality  and maintained jointly  by the 
community  and  municipality.  The  municipality  would  co-finance  the  construction  of  the  trail  bridges 
and associated trails and the community would contribute towards the construction and maintenance 
of trails and trail bridges; 
165 
17.  Road  user  committees  would  be  formed  for  all  village  roads,  trails  and  trail  bridges.  The 
committees would work together with the local government to ensure that maintenance is carried out 
for the infrastructure. 
18.  Water supply is a key constraint to development in the hill and mountain areas of Nepal. Over 
the  years,  the  government  has  developed  irrigation  schemes  with  the  assistance  of  donor 
organisations. The irrigation policy defines small-scale irrigation as less than 25 ha in mountain areas 
and 200 ha in the Terai. Small-scale irrigation is the responsibility of local government bodies. Larger 
irrigation schemes are the responsibility of the Department of Irrigation. 
19.  The ASDP would invest in new and old farmer managed small-scale irrigation systems. Existing 
small-scale  systems  would  be  rehabilitated  and  upgraded  using  modern  technologies  that  promote 
water use efficiency and crop productivity. Drip irrigation, under solar, would be preferred where ever 
feasible. In all cases, irrigation development shall include improved domestic water supply systems for 
the  community.  The  Programme  would  promote  the  use  of  water  filtration  systems  that  are 
appropriate  for  the  areas  to  be  selected  for  the  supply  of  water  for  use  at  households.  Supply  of 
potable water, alongside irrigation water, would be a Programme objective in areas with no domestic 
water supply. 
20.  Marketing  and  Collection centres.  Small towns  in rural Nepal act as service centres providing 
for  places  to  market  excess  farm  produce.  Local  government  authorities  and  the  Department  of 
Marketing  facilitate  the  development  of  markets.  The  markets  would  be  owned  by  the  local 
government  (municipality  or  State),  but  managed  by  the  users,  who  would  establish  a  Market 
Management  Committee  (MMC).  The  users  of  the  market  pay  a  fee  for  use  that  would  be  used  to 
finance operation and maintenance and depreciation. 
the  cost  of 
21.  The ASDP, would finance the development of marketing infrastructure, according to the needs 
identified in the SIP and in line with local government priorities. The Programme would finance 50 per 
cent  of 
finance  35 per  cent  and 
beneficiaries/private sector would finance 15 per cent. This would include municipality-owned markets 
of different sizes depending on location and identified need. Markets would have women-friendly and 
safe spaces. The MMC would be assisted to organise for optimal operation and maintenance of the 
market. 
local  government  would

the 
22.  Community-based collection centres are also proposed to be developed in line with the needs 
of traders. The collection centres would be farmer organisation owned and operated. The farmers who 
own a collection centre would be legally registered.  
23.  To  facilitate  the  assessment  and  management  of  potential  social  impacts  arising  from  ASDP, 
the  Department  of  Local  Infrastructure  Development  and  Agricultural  Roads  (DoLIDAR)  has 
developed an Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF). This framework formulated 
in  accordance  with  GoN  and  the  World  Bank’s  environmental  and  social  safeguard  policies  will  be 
used to address the social and environmental safeguards in the sub-projects. 
24.  ASDP-PCO  now  wishes  to  hire  firms  for  Feasibility,  Design  and  Supervision  based  in  road 
corridor, for assisting the Project Coordination Office (PCO) and related Urban/Rural municipalities in 
updating feasibility study, survey, design, cost estimation, assist in procurement of works, supervision 
of  construction  work  including  quality  control  procedure,  reporting,  environmental  safeguard 
compliances etc.

Annex 5:  Infrastructure climate proofing 
Since infrastructures such as transport, hydropower, irrigation, water supply and sanitation, 
1. 
housing, and communication are the lifelines of socioeconomic development, it is not surprising that 
about half of the annual development budget is spent on their development and maintenance. Floods, 
landslides, and siltation during the monsoon render many of these lifelines dysfunctional every year 
and their repair and reconstruction costs the nation dearly. In addition, damaged infrastructures 
impede the functioning of other economic sectors-sometimes for long periods-incurring a huge 
economic loss. A damaged road, for example, hinders the movement of people and goods and 
adversely affects industry, business, markets, and all other allied activities. Protecting infrastructure 
against disasters is crucially important to lower the costs of repair and maintenance as well as to 
continue to allow the unobstructed pursuit of business activities. Climate change, which forebodes 
ever more extreme events at ever greater intervals, is likely to pose a great threat to existing as well 
as future infrastructures. Increased instances of drainage congestion, scouring, inundation, slope 
instability, land subsidence, erosion, and collapse of structures are likely. Floods, landslides and 
debris deposits will affect hydropower, roads, bridges, irrigation, settlements, water supply and 
sanitation, while the drying up of water sources will impact drinking water and sanitation, irrigation, 
and micro hydro plants. In addition, temperature variations tend to accelerate structural fatigue and 
materials failure in road pavements and metal structures. The impacts could be severe in areas where 
infrastructures are not designed to cope with the effects of climate change. If investment in 
infrastructure is to be productive and sustainable, it needs to be made climate resilient168 by 
incorporating anticipatory measures during design and implementation. 
Since the majority of the local population predominantly use road transportation, a need to plan 
2. 
and construct roads that can withstand extreme weather conditions is increasingly necessary. This 
cannot be over emphasised when perishable commodity of high value is involved. Adaptation, in 
general, is either adaptation through making changes in the structural design (engineering) such as 
specifying materials, having standard dimensions, constructing proper drainage systems, etc. or 
through non-engineering methods such as planning for maintenance, alignment, land use and 
environmental management. In addition to this, ADB’s report on the “Guidelines for Climate Proofing 
Investment in the Transport Sector” (2011)169 emphasizes that a “do nothing” approach could also be 
one of the actions to take in order to minimize costs on roads that have low economic feasibility. In 
addition, there are two types of responses that can be planned by the government: i) Pre-disaster 
response and ii) Post-disaster response. In the pre-disaster section it is important to discuss about 
policy, resilience design, quality of material use, regular basis inspection and maintenance (I/M), 
research and institutional development, etc to resist with the climate induced disasters and climate 
impacts. Post-disaster includes how to make the people and infrastructure adapt during and after the 
disasters. This part mainly covers management, maintenance, medical facilities, and public 
awareness, etc. for the resilience society. 
At the moment in Nepal, most of the adaptation measures being taken are geared at mitigating 
3. 
the effects of natural disasters such as landslides, which frequently occur in different parts of Nepal. 
Bioengineering has played a major role in stabilizing the slopes of hills in different parts of Nepal. It is 
a cost effective, environmentally friendly and sustainable method that has proven to be successful in 
solving road weathering and blockage caused by landslides170 . However, bioengineering is only one 
way of disaster proofing roads. Other adaptation measures need to be included in the plan in order to 
make the road infrastructure of Nepal disaster as well as climate resilient. Currently, road construction 
and rehabilitation projects in Nepal don’t consider the impacts climate change can have on road 
infrastructures. The only consideration that is made is on flood proofing road sections with priority, 
keeping in mind the 50 years and 100 years flood cycles.

The sensitivity matrix to climate change, as specified in the NPC document for Climate Resilient 
4. 
Planning, will be prepared. Once the matrix is prepared, the most sensitive components will be 
examined. Intervention options needed to reduce the risk for the most sensitive components are then 
identified. In addition to the measures normally taken in the design of infrastructures, the 
infrastructures will be made climate resilient by incorporating the anticipatory measures during design 
and implementation to reduce risk.

Institutional aspects and implementation 
1. 
The overall responsibility for ASDP will be assumed by the MoAD, which is the Lead 
Programme Agency. It will establish a PCO at Birendranagar in Surkhet district of State 6 to 
coordinate Programme implementation and a PSC, which will assist the MoAD in coordinating with  
the government agencies, National Farmers Commission, Service providers (SPs), the private sector 
and communities at all levels to ensure achievement of the Programme objectives. A Technical 
Advisory Group (TAG) will be established at State 6 to guide technical aspects of the ASDP. The TAG 
will be chaired by the State Secretary for Agriculture or equivalent with participation from the 
representatives from  relevant state-level government agencies, private sector and the municipalities.  
The organizational and management structure proposed for ASDP is based on the lessons 
2. 
learnt under HVAP, which can be summarized as follows:  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
TORs specifying positions, roles and functions of the PSC and PCO at all levels and their 
reporting system are critically important to ensure the Programme implementation 
performance in its early stage; 
MSPs were vital in the Programme’s efforts toward the development of value chains and 
private sector partnership; 
Financial management mechanism and flow of funds for all outputs and activities should 
be clearly specified in the Programme design and PIM; 
PCO staff at all levels should be encouraged diversify their interests with a view to 
maximising human resource availability;   
Programme management should not create different systems, parallel with the existing 
local institutional setups, particularly at municipal and ward level;  
The Programme capacity building interventions should focus on improving public 
services at the municipal and ward levels to ensure effective decentralization;   
Sufficient resources should be available to ensure performance accountability and 
competition amongst the Programme municipalities and wards; 
Coordination and information sharing between IFAD project and other donor-funded and 
NGO projects should be identified during the Programme formulation and negotiation; 
Programme M&E systems should be applied as a management tool for planning, 
strategizing and implementation. 
In general, the Programme will adopt similar implementation arrangements to those used for 
3. 
the HVAP, incorporating the operational and managerial experience and lessons learned as detailed 
above., The Programme Management component is designed to maximizing Programme 
effectiveness and efficiency through the implementation of the following principles:  
 
 
 
The Programme management structure will adapt to the new constitutional structure of 
local institutions, building capacity to address poverty through market-based approaches, 
but these will now also incorporate climate-smart criteria to enable an effective response 
to the need for CC adaptation;   
The Programme will decentralize its resources to the municipal and ward levels while 
mobilising private participation and strengthening public market and value chain 
development service providers; 
The Programme will focus its support in about 60 priority municipalities across 
10 districts in State 6 using agreed criteria for selection, particularly through the SIP 
process;

 
 
 
 
Application of the “learning by doing” approach to introduce innovations to value chain 
stakeholders and promoting replication on increasingly larger scales when concepts are 
effectively proven;  
Mainstreaming the participation of the private sector throughout the planning, 
implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the Programme activities; and 
Ensuring the synergies among other investments that are being carried out in State 6. 
Strict implementation of IFAD policies and guidelines in result-based Programme 
management. 
State and municipal governance. Under the new Constitution of Nepal, powers concerning 
4. 
themes that encompass various ASDP activities have been placed in the respective domains of 
municipalities and States. The municipal list of powers includes ‘management, operation and control 
of agricultural extension’, ‘agriculture and animal husbandry, agro-products management, animal 
health, co-operatives’, ‘local roads, rural roads, agro-roads, irrigation’, ‘cooperative institutions’, ‘local 
market management’ and ‘forests, wildlife, birds, water uses, environment, ecology and bio-diversity’. 
The list of powers of the States includes ‘agriculture and livestock development, trade, business, 
transportation’, ‘use of forests and waters and management of environment’ and ‘cooperative 
institutions’. States are likely to have ministry and/or departments for agriculture, livestock, forestry 
and co-operatives and municipalities are likely to operate through the sub-committee mechanism. It is 
imperative that the key individuals in governments at the State and Programme-selected 
municipalities are fully on board with the ASDP concept, design and activities to ensure an enabling 
environment, budgetary support (e.g. for extension, infrastructure) and participation (e.g. in 
mobilisation at the municipal and ward levels). To fast track this process, the Programme will run 
orientation workshops at provincial and municipal level and support the rapid evolution of 
representative farmer organizations (MAUs and CAESCs) to ensure close liaison between farming 
communities and local administrations. 
Programme Steering Committee. The PSC is established by the MoAD for overall execution 
5. 
of Programme implementation and ensure effective coordination/integration/ cooperation among 
parallel government and donor-funded Programmes. The PSC will be chaired by the Secretary, MoAD 
and be comprised of representatives of the federal  ministries, Secretary for Agriculture or equivalent 
for State 6, National Farmers Commission and private sector entities related to the Programme (See 
Appendix 5, Annex 1 for details). The PSC will inform the MoAD/Agriculture ministry or equivalent of 
State 6 on matters concerning the strategic management of the Programme, including the approval of 
the PIM, AWPB, and other decisions related to Programme coordination, orientation and mobilization 
of resources. The PSC will meet each quadrimester (alternatively in Kathmandu and State 6) to 
coordinate Programme implementation, guide planning, review progress, and make recommendations 
for any modifications of AWPB as needed. In addition to the MoAD-chaired PSC, the PCO will be 
supported by a State 6 Agriculture Secretary or equivalent-chaired Technical Advisory Group (TAG) 
that combines state-level, municipal and national technical expertise. 
Technical Advisory Group (TAG) A TAG, chaired by the Agriculture Secretary or equivalent 
6. 
of State 6, will be established  comprising representatives from  State-level  agriculture, livestock, 
forestry, (private sector) agri-business, food technology/safety experts and municipal representatives 
to advise the PCO on technical aspects of Programme implementation. The TAG would meet as 
required, preferably bi-annually in Birendranagar to review the ASDP RB-AWPB before submission to 
MOAD and IFAD and to liaise with MSP groups to discuss technical constraints to efficient VC 
development. The group would advise the MSPs and PCO on technical solutions to identified 
problems or on the development of participatory action research to identify solutions. 
7. 
Programme Coordination Office (PCO). A PCO will be established at Birendranagar in 
Surkhet district of State 6 to coordinate the programme implementation and also to assist the PSC in 
coordination of the participating federal agencies and municipalities and Wards in actual management 
of GoN and IFAD resources. The PCO will report directly to the PSC, acting as its Secretariat The 
182 
Nepal 
Agriculture Sector Development Programme 
Final programme design report 
Appendix 5: 
Institutional aspects and implementation arrangements 
PCO will include a management team of government-deputed officers, a technical team of externally 
recruited experts, and support staffs hired by the PCO. 
The mandate of the PCO will be to ensure: (i) coherence of the Programme approaches and 
8. 
strategies, and integration among Programme activities in order to produce the Programme’s 
expected outcomes, outputs and impact; (ii) coordination and synergy among the implementing 
partners and technical service providers,  the municipal agencies including MAU and CAESC, and 
grassroots communities; (iii) contracting of competent service providers to undertake various forms of 
research, studies, technical assistance and training; (iv) accountable on management of IFAD and 
Government’s resources, including preparation of the PIM, RB-AWPBs, procurement plans, selection 
of technical assistance, establishment and operation of M&E and MIS systems, and other functions of 
the operational and financial management of the Programme; and (vi) knowledge sharing in 
collaboration with implementing agencies on a wider scale. PCO ToRs are detailed in Appendix 5, 
Annex 2. 
PCO staffing.. The PCO is tasked to facilitate Programme implementation both by working 
9. 
through private and public-sector implementation agencies (MSPs, Municipalities, MAUs, CAESCs, 
Agro-vets, LRPs, etc.) and through more direct implementation for activities such as rural financial 
services. With SDC grant funding, HIS will be an implanting partner for sub-component 4.  Key 
Programme staff would include a Programme Coordinator, a senior agriculture officer (deputed from 
State 6), an account officer, a planning officer and support staff (all deputed from the government) and 
a team of technical experts comprising  funds and contract (financial management and procurement) , 
value chain development, engineering, institutional development, financial management, rural finance, 
climate change, gender and social inclusion, nutrition, monitoring and evaluation (M&E) and 
knowledge management (KM), and information technology & MIS and support staff (all contracted). 
The Programme would also establish three corridor-based field teams (all contracted) working along 
the four main road corridors having business, engineering, social/gender, finance institution and 
M&E/KM skills. An ASDP Liaison office would be maintained in Kathmandu. The Programme would be 
governed by a Programme Steering Committee (PSC), chaired by the Secretary, MoAD. Technical 
specialist recruitment will be on a competitive basis and all contracts will be performance-based on a 
two (2) year renewable terms171.  
10.  Municipal-level Programme Implementation Coordination172. Municipal Assemblies and 
Municipal Councils will have overall responsibility for the Programme in their respective municipality. 
Each participating municipality will have municipal-staffed agriculture and livestock officers who, with 
the support of the Programme corridor-based mobile teams and the PCO specialists, will facilitate 
Programme implementation in their municipalities. An MAU will be established in each municipality 
(see Main report, para.  61). The District Coordination Committees (DCCs) will convene the MSPs. 
11.  Elected Ward Committees (WCs) will be involved in the Programme implementation in the 
targeted Wards. The Ward’s CAESC Board (see Main report, para. Error! Reference source not 
found.) will be the focal point for coordinating the overall implementation of Programme interventions 
and activities by the related implementing agencies at Ward level. Wards will not be budget holders 
under the new constitutional arrangements but will be eligible to receive budget advances from the 
municipality or the PCO. 
12.  A Programme Coordinator (PC), a Joint Secretary level cadre of GON  having solid 
experiences in implementing donor-funded projects, will lead the PCO. It would be better that the PC 
shall be fully involved in the Programme design and negotiation to master the Programmes’ new 
approaches and receive proper training from IFAD on new policies and management skills. The PC, 
as the Head of the PCO, will work full-time for the Programme, and will have no additional 
responsibilities within any other State or federal ministry and/or department. The major responsibilities 
of the PC will be to ensure that the involved federal and state-level agencies, municipalities,  wards 
171 HVAP model. 
172 There are both Urban and Rural Municipalities, the latter defined as “Village” in some communications. As the Programme is expected to work 
across both types of Municipalities no distinction is made in this document between the two types of municipality. 
183 
Nepal 
Agriculture Sector Development Programme 
Final programme design report 
Appendix 5: 
Institutional aspects and implementation arrangements 
and other implementing partners carry out the Programme activities in line with the Programme 
approach, operating schedules and procedures. The PC will have adequate executive authorities and 
accountability. The PC will act as Secretary of the PSC and and TAG, and  execute the decisions 
made by PSC and TAG on its behalf. ToRs for key Programme staff are detailed in Appendix 5, 
Annex 3. 
  Programme Management at Municipal Level. In accordance with current MoF decisions, the 
12.
PCO would be the sole Programme “Cost Centre” for disbursement of funds to beneficiaries 
and/or implementing agencies. The Programme will revise its disbursement strategies in 
accordance with prevailing GoN regulations, including devolution of conditional funding for 
activities implemented by the municipality, on completion of a fiduciary due diligence of the 
municipality as a cost center.  
 The approval of ASDP IPs by Local Body Executives would be based on the recommendations 
13.
of the MAU in response to competitive farmer group IPs that have undergone a bipartisan Field 
Evaluation by the Ward-level Community Agriculture Extension Service Centres (CAESCs) and 
PCO/HSI technical/administration teams173. Once Ward-level IPs have been prioritised and approved 
by the MAU in accordance with the budget limits set by the PCO. That committee would forward the 
IPs to the Local Body Executive for no-objection and subsequently request to the ASDP Project 
Coordinator (PC) for financing. The municipal-approved IPs would be included in the ASDP annual 
work programme and budget (AWPB), and, upon MoF approval, the PCO would prepare a 
quadripartite contract (Municipality, Ward, beneficiary and PCO) on which basis the PC would allocate 
ASDP funds to contract-identified beneficiaries.  
14.
  Gender in the Organisation: ASDP will ensure that at least 20 per cent women are recruited 
to middle and senior management levels. There will be additional scores for women in the recruitment 
process. If women candidates are found to excel in the recruitment process, they will be recruited and 
paid on par with their male colleagues. The Programme will maintain the maternity leave rule as 
applicable to all government establishments. If it is seen, that there are a number of small children of 
women staff within the PCO, the Programme will establish/or recruit the services of a crèche and the 
provision of a nanny. The operation and maintenance of the crèche can be equitably shared by the 
Programme and the staff. The Programme will deem to have flexi working hours so as to 
accommodate household and child care chores that the women staff members have to carry out in 
their personal life. The Programme will set up a Sexual Harassment Committee to address any 
complain of sexual harassment across all levels of the Programme and will also include the social 
mobilisers recruited by the NGOs. All Programme staff will be provided with training on sexual 
harassment at workplace on a yearly basis. There will be, on a yearly basis, a gender sensitisation 
and gender in value chain training for all staff across all levels. 
  Partnerships. At present, various development partners are supporting GoN in the 
15.
implementation of market- led agriculture development and rural financial and technical services 
delivery initiatives. With the aim of aligning ASDP with lessons learned from those programmes, 
complementarities and partnerships will be forged where possible. Among such initiatives,  SDC 
financed NASDP working on  extension service development and value chain stakeholder alignment; 
the ADB’s initiative on  district road construction; and the DFiD’s RAP III on community infrastructure 
development are closer to the approaches that ASDP is implementing. There are ample opportunities 
with these initiatives for complementarities and partnership. The PCO should identify other points of 
collaboration  as the Programme implementation matures.  
  Government partners. The Lead Implementing Agency - MoAD is currently the regulatory body 
16.
mandated to implement the ADS in Nepal. The ADS provides the overall strategic guidance 
framework for agriculture sector development, however, its implementation poses a range of technical 
and cultural challenges for MoAD management and staff. The Programme will work with the ADS 
Coordination Unit within the MoAD to support a change in service delivery from its current top-down 
184 
Nepal 
Agriculture Sector Development Programme 
Final programme design report 
Appendix 5: 
Institutional aspects and implementation arrangements 
and public sector service delivery modality to one where MoAD coordinates, technically supervises 
and monitors a pluralistic extension system largely delivered through municipalities, MAUs and 
CAESCs. The Programme will also strengthen government partner skills in the fields of Programme 
management, M&E, gender mainstreaming, nutrition, climate change adaptation and knowledge 
management. 
  NGOs and implementation support. Under the on-going constitutional reforms, municipalities 
17.
will become the key administration and development entity in Nepal. Given that this reform is just 
beginning, it is anticipated that municipalities will need strong support for effective Programme 
implementation. The Programme will work closely with NGOs of proven competence and 
sustainability, particularly in community participatory planning, co-operative and MFI institutional 
reform and gender development and nutrition support at municipal level. 
  Private sector. Private enterprises, co-operatives, farmers’ organizations, lead farmers and 
18.
farmers’ groups engaged in commodity production, the supply of goods and services, commodity 
processing, marketing or related fields will participate in Programme implementation as co-financiers 
and/or service providers. Free standing MSPs will support coordination along value chains. 
  Academic and research organizations. The Programme will, through MSPs, engage academics 
19.
and research organizations under performance-based contracts for capacity building of value chain 
stakeholders and technical problem solving along value chain processes.  
  MAUs and CAESCs. The establishment of MAUs under Municipal Councils and CAESCs under 
20.
Ward Committees will strengthen the grassroots-level management and operational capacity, 
fostering community-governed and equitable representation and participation of the vulnerable groups 
in community decision making structure. 
  Community-level farmers’ organizations. Support to the farmers’ organizations in the forms of 
21.
groups or co-operatives, and the establishment of beneficiary self-managed O&M committees will 
foster grassroots organization of rural women and men, through sustainable, self-governed 
mechanisms, established in pursuit of enhanced self-development, management, and climate 
adapted production and marketing. 
22.
  Programme Contracting. As a general principle, ASDP will use output-based contracts as a 
basic tool for service delivery. An 'output-based' contract is an agreement between the Programme 
and a service provider which will be managed by the PCO for value chain and community level 
service delivery. The driving force behind the contract is that it focuses on deliverables in measurable 
terms, rather than checking that the activities have been undertaken, or assessing the service delivery 
methodologies. This signals a move from payments for inputs or activities (e.g. completing a training 
workshop) to payments for a tangible measurement of the results from such activity.  For example, a 
tangible measure of a training program will be farmers applying some of the knowledge and skills 
attained on their farms to provide some measurable benefits. The main advantages of output-based 
contracts are: 
 
 
 
simplicity in administration as payment is based on delivery of specific milestones and 
milestone deliverables based on an agreed price, rather than on acquittal and 
reconciliation of all expenditure receipts; 
risks of non-performance are reduced, as, if milestones are not delivered, no payment is 
made; 
the definition of milestones based on Programme objectives and outputs makes 
measurement of impact much easier. 
  The main difficulty of output-based contracts is the increased effort required to define and agree 
23.
the milestones, deliverables and price. Milestones have two parts (i) milestone definition and 
(ii) milestone deliverables.  It is easier to define milestones and deliverables for infrastructure 
185 
Nepal 
Agriculture Sector Development Programme 
Final programme design report 
Appendix 5: 
Institutional aspects and implementation arrangements 
contracts than for service delivery contracts (especially “soft services” such as extension where 
impacts are dependent on the recipients of the service making a decision to change or adopt. 
24.
  Output-based contracts are lump sum.  There is agreement on price for service delivery and the 
contract specifies that price and payment schedules.  For the contract owner, the key task is to ensure 
value for money.  Once this has been achieved almost all the risks are borne by the service provider.  
If the service provider can provide specified services at a lower price, then there is additional profit to 
be made.  The reverse applies, however, if the service provider costs are higher than the agreed price 
(budget). An example of an output-based service delivery contract is detailed in of Appendix 5 
Annex 4. 
  Service Providers will be required to self-monitor the implementation of their contracts.  In 
25.
general, this will require delivery of Milestone Reports by the service provider to trigger milestone 
payments and CAESCs, MAUs and municipal administrations to inspect and provide assurance to the 
PCO that Programme milestones and deliverables have been completed to an acceptable level.   
26.
  Service Providers are responsible for evaluation of the benefits the investment (infrastructure 
and service delivery).  The process is to establish baselines prior to the commencement of the sub-
project and at the end of the sub-project the changes in relation to the baselines will be documented.  
Simple formats for baseline surveys of sub-project beneficiaries will be developed as a template for 
infrastructure and service provider sub-projects and trained CAESC staff will assist Service Providers 
to tailor the standard template to their project. Service Providers may appoint (sub-contract) expertise 
(e.g. LRPs) to undertake sub-project baseline and completion surveys. 
  Trained evaluators will conduct an impact evaluation of at least 15 per cent of all service 
27.
delivery sub-projects. Methodologies for impact evaluation will be developed by national specialists, 
but must include key evaluation criteria (relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, impact and 
sustainability).  For service delivery contracts where financial information is available from baseline 
and end of sub-project surveys, estimates of benefit ─ cost ratios should be attempted.

Annex 4. Example Service Delivery Sub-project 
1. 
As  a  general  principle,  ASDP  will  use  output-based  contracts  as  a  basic  tool  for  service 
delivery. An 'output based' contract is an agreement between the Programme and a service provider 
which would be managed by the PCO, creating a relationship for the delivery of services or products. 
The driving force behind the contract is that it focuses deliverables in measurable terms, rather than 
checking that the activities have  been undertaken, or assessing the service delivery methodologies. 
This  signals  a  move  from  payments  for  inputs  or  activities  (e.g.  completing  a  training  workshop)  to 
payments  for  a  tangible  measurement  of  the  results  from  such  activity.    For  example,  a  tangible 
measure of a training program would be farmers applying some of the knowledge and skills attained 
on their farms to provide some measurable benefits. 
2. 
The main advantages of output-based contracts are: 
 
 
 
Simplicity in administration as payment is based on delivery of specific milestones and 
milestone deliverables based on an agreed price, rather than on acquittal and 
reconciliation of all expenditure receipts. 
Risks of non-performance are reduced as if milestones are not delivered, no payment is 
made. 
Definition of milestones based on project objectives and outputs makes measurement of 
impact much easier. 
The main difficulty of output based contracts is the increased effort required to define and agree 
3. 
the  milestones,  deliverables  and  price.  Milestones  have  two  parts  (i) milestone  definition  and 
(ii) milestone  deliverables.    It  is  easier  to  define  milestones  and  deliverables  for  infrastructure 
contracts  than  for  service  delivery  contracts  (especially  “soft  services”  such  as  extension  where 
impacts are dependent on the recipients of the service making a decision to change or adopt. 
4. 
Output-based contracts are lump sum.  There is agreement on price for service delivery and the 
contract  specifies  that  price  and  payment  schedules.    For  the  contract  “owner”  the  key  task  is  to 
ensure value for money.  Once this has been achieved almost all the risks are borne by the service 
provider.  If the service provider can provide specified services at a lower price then there is additional 
profit  to  be  made.    The  reverse  applies,  however,  if  the  service  provider  costs  are  higher  than  the 
agreed price (budget). An example of an output-based service delivery contract is detailed below. 
5. 
Service  Providers  will  be  required  to  self-monitor  the  implementation  of  their  contracts.    In 
general,  this  will  require  delivery  of  Milestone  Reports  by  the  service  provider  to  trigger  milestone 
payments  and  CAESCs  or  MADBs  to  inspect  and  provide  assurance  to  the  PCO  that  project 
milestones  and  deliverables  have  been  completed  to  an  acceptable  level.    In  doing  this  the 
CAESC/MADB  will  sign  a  Declaration  to  the  PCO  that  the  CAESC/MADB  as  project  manager  is 
satisfied that the service  provider has delivered the  milestone deliverables to the standard required.  
The  Declaration,  signed  by  the  CAESC/MADB  Chairperson  and  witnessed  by  2  CAESC/MADB 
members  (at  least  one  from  a  poor  or  disadvantaged  household)  provides  the  trigger  for  milestone 
payments. 
6. 
Declarations for Milestone payments will be delivered to the PCO within two weeks of Milestone 
completion.    Where  delivery  dates  are  delayed  the  CAESC/MADB  will  advise  the  PCO  of  delays, 
reasons for delay, possible implications of delays and actions taken to ensure Milestones delivery. 
7. 
Service  Providers  are  responsible  for  evaluation  of  the  benefits  the  investment  (infrastructure 
and  service  delivery).    The  process  is  to  establish  baselines  prior  to  the  commencement  of  each 
project  and  at  the  end  of  the  project  the  changes  in  relation  to  the  baselines  will  be  documented.  
Project  Baselines  and  Project  Validation  Reports  (comparing  socio-economic  baselines  to  end  of 
project  status)  will  be  payment  milestones.  Simple  formats  for  baseline  surveys  of  all  project 
beneficiaries  will  be  developed  as  a  template  for  infrastructure  and  service  provider  projects  and 
trained CAESC/MADB staff will assist Service Providers to tailor the standard template to their project. 
Service Providers may appoint (sub-contract) expertise (e.g. key farmers) to undertake baseline and 
project completion socio-economic surveys. 
8. 
Trained  evaluators  will  conduct  an  impact  evaluation  of  at  least  15%  of  all  service  delivery 
projects. Methodologies for impact evaluation will be developed by national extension specialists, but 
must  include  key  evaluation  criteria  (relevance,  effectiveness,  efficiency,  impact  and  sustainability).  
For service delivery contracts where financial information is available from baseline and end of project 
surveys estimates of benefit ─ cost ratios should be attempted.

This contract demonstrates some key points about output based contracts for service delivery 
projects:   
  The Owner is the CAESC 
  The above contract includes contributions from project beneficiaries.  Farmer groups are 
not  required  to  contribute  to  the  costs  of  improving  knowledge  and  skills,  but  will  be 
required to contribute if production inputs or small-scale infrastructure (processing, value 
adding etc.) are approved. Where inputs are required the contract will specify the inputs 
and detail the milestone and deliverables required to ensure that the input costs are used 
for their intended purpose. 
  The  contract  is  between  the  CAESC  and  the  Service  Provider  who  is  undertaking  the 
training  and  skills  attainment  and  is  responsible  for  the  implementation  of  the  varietal 
trials. 
  The  implementer  is  the  Service  Provider  who  has  responsibilities  for  self-monitoring  the 
implementation  with  the  CAESC  verifying  and  signing  off  those  services  have  met 
expectations. 
  Evaluation  is  through  a  comparison  between  the  baseline  and  project  validation.    In 
service  contracts,  the  Service  Provider  is  responsible  for  simple  baseline  surveys  and 
project validation.  Assistance to do this will be provided by evaluators from the CAESC or 
Programme road corridor teams.  
174 The cost of undertaking each milestone are examples only and the total contract and payment for each milestone 
should be based on the cost/prices quoted by the preferred service provider

Appendix 6:  Planning, M&E and learning and knowledge management 
Appendix 6:  Planning, M&E and learning and knowledge 
management 
The purpose of the Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) system is to provide reliable information to 
1.
enable a results-oriented management of the Programme with the aim to increase 
Programme/Programme effectiveness and efficiency in achieving its objectives and to share 
information and lessons learned among all stakeholders. In this Programme, data collection and 
analysis efforts will be geared towards ensuring that programme implementation can track progress 
towards achievement of expected outputs, outcomes and impacts and take necessary decisions and 
actions if course correction is required.  
2.
The M&E system will be reviewed in the light of the expansion of the Programme. It will be 
upgraded according to the following principles that derive from lessons learnt from previous IFAD 
funded Programmes/Programmes in Nepal: (i) simple M&E processes and methods; (ii) clear roles 
and responsibilities for stakeholders; (iii) harmonization of information and reporting requirements of 
the stakeholders through alignment to the existing planning, monitoring and reporting processes; 
(iv) sufficient capacity building on gender responsive M&E and KM through targeted trainings; and 
(v) strong linkages between planning, M&E and knowledge management. 
3.
Start up and initial stage of Programme implementation: At start up, the Programme will 
build a detailed logical framework through a participatory process to ensure that stakeholders own 
and agree on the results-chain. The Programme Coordinating Office (PCO) will also develop a 
specific M&E Plan within two months of programme start up. The M&E plan will help to clarify the 
different monitoring and evaluation processes and methodologies with the partners and operationalise 
the indicators. The Programme will assess the gaps in the current management information system 
(MIS) and modify it accordingly. The Programme will also finalisation of Terms of Reference for key 
institutions and their staff and the other implementing agencies. The finalization of the Memoranda of 
Understanding between the key implementing partners will be carried out at this stage. The 
Programme will conduct, at the end of HVAP, a gender sensitive, livelihoods-oriented completion 
survey led by the PCO M&E Specialist and GESI Adviser. There will be arrangements for subsequent 
repeater surveys, Participatory Rapid Rural Appraisals (PRAs) and Participatory Impact Monitoring 
with attention on targeting, gender and socio-economic improvement issues in the duration of the 
Programme.  
4.
M&E Plan: To clarify the different monitoring and evaluation processes and methodologies, the 
Programme will develop an M&E plan at start-up. The M&E plan is essentially a manual that explains 
the M&E system of the Programme in detail and operationalises the indicators in the logframe for 
easy reference for anyone involved in Programme implementation. It should clearly spell out the data 
gathering sources and methods, and roles and responsibilities of different stakeholders. As per the 
three-tier logic in the logical framework and as presented in the below graph the Programme conducts 
monitoring activities at output and outcome levels. At the impact level, different type of evaluations are 
conducted. In addition, the Programme will monitor the physical and financial progress (inputs) and 
performance at the activity level through the integration of the Programme M&E with the government’s 
monitoring system. The M&E system will initially focus on monitoring the physical and financial 
progress, but as the Programme matures will move on to monitoring of outputs. At Mid Term, the 
Programme is expected to start outcome monitoring. The impact created by the Programme is 
evaluated mainly through the IFAD Results and Impact Management System (RIMS) as well as 
through specific impact studies to be conducted by the Programme. 
5.
M&E at PCO: The HVAP M&E has three distinct tools: (i) Result and Impact Management 
System (RIMS), (ii) Programme log frame and (iii) Donor Committee for Enterprise Development 
Standard (DCEDS) which has been developed for all enterprise related Programmes by donors and 
looks mainly at the results chain. These tools will continue to exist and will be built upon to address 
the nuances of the new Programme. The Standard IFAD Monitoring and Evaluation System (SIMES) 
215 
Nepal 
Agriculture Sector Development Programme 
Final programme design report 
Appendix 6:  Planning, M&E and learning and knowledge management 
will no longer apply. The Programme will be responsible for identifying COSOP related indicators in its 
logframe. In conjunction with the trimestral reports, the Programme will report against these indicators 
(in addition to reporting on the RIMS indicators) to the IFAD country office in Nepal. The nutrition and 
women’s empowerment indicators will be developed at the pre-Programme stage with the help of the 
TA Specialists who will be recruited by the Programme to develop and implement the two indices. The 
Programme will identify the relevant indicators for the DCEDS that they must monitor and periodically 
report against. These indicators will be included in the MIS to facilitate collection and analysis.  
The M&E System: The M&E system at PCO level will be designed to collect information from 
6.
Programme staff, implementing and supporting organisations, groups and co-operatives and farmers, 
service providers, and community organisations. This information will be coordinated and synthesised 
to report on the progress on planned activities, targets, expenditures and assess the extent to which 
the intended results at the output, outcome and impact levels are being achieved. The HVAP MIS will 
be revised to meet Programme requirements and will be the source of all data for the various formats 
and reporting that the Programme has to undertake. The M&E system of the Programme will be 
based on a simple three-level framework through which progress towards the different level results is 
monitored and evaluated and need for changes in the Programme implementation identified. The 
Logical framework provides the basis for the M&E system to be developed. The three levels 
mentioned are as follows:  
 
 
 
the first level refers to the regular and continuous monitoring of Programme activities and 
their immediate results (output monitoring);  
the second level relates to the monitoring and assessment of Programme performance in 
achieving expected outcomes (outcome monitoring);  
finally,  the  third  level  refers  to  the  assessment  of  Programme  contribution  towards  the 
achievement of its overall goal (impact evaluation).  
The annual Programme management cycle will include the following processes: (i) scoping, 
7.
validation, initial planning and drafting of Results Oriented Annual Workplan and Budget (RO-AWPB), 
approval of activities; (ii) implementation, monitoring and reporting; (iii) stakeholder review, evaluation 
and lesson learning; and (iv) communication, knowledge management and feedback to planning 
future cycles. A template for the RO-AWPB has been created by IFAD to strengthen the results-
orientation in Programmes and to promote linkages between the M&E and planning and will be used 
by the Programme. The starting point for drafting the RO-AWPB is the Logical Framework, to be 
finalized by Programme management on the basis of the draft logframe. The RIMS and COSOP 
indicators will also be included in the RO-AWPB. 
8.
Programme planning and reporting will both follow the GoN budget cycle. Final AWPBs will be 
prepared according to the IFAD Results-Oriented Annual Workplan and Budget guideline and format 
to be provided to the Programme by the IFAD country office. As to trimestral-based reporting, 
separate standardised formats should be developed. Presently there are gaps between the MIS and 
the logframe, SIMES, RIMS and COSOP. The new Programme will improve the MIS by incorporating 
all indicators from all required reporting formats (IFAD and government) so that the generation of data 
and reports is simple and adheres to the requirements of each institution. The Programme will geo tag 
every household that it monitors. The Programme will continue the use of electronic Tablets for 
monitoring as this has become an efficient way to track progress under the HVAP.  
9.
Annual Work Plan and Budget: Based on the individual Results-Oriented Annual Work Plan 
and Budget (RO-AWP&B) prepared by each Service Provider, the PCO will prepare a consolidated 
plan at the beginning of each fiscal year that will clearly identify expected annual results in relation 
with clearly defined budget requirements. This RO-AWPB will be sent to IFAD for no-objection and the 
PSC for approval. At the end of the fiscal year, the RO-AWP&B - duly completed with annual and 
cumulative achievements will be annexed to the Annual Progress Report. Thus, a link will be created 
between the annual planning exercise, the M&E activities and the annual reporting exercise. The 
Programme level RO-AWPB needs to explain key issues, objectives, focus of the annual work plan 
216 
Nepal 
Agriculture Sector Development Programme 
Final programme design report 
Appendix 6:  Planning, M&E and learning and knowledge management 
and budget, rationale for setting specific targets, and the planning process in a narrative text. The 
RIMS indicators are required to be included in the RO-AWPB so that this becomes the basis for 
preparing the annual RIMS report. It may be noted that the RO-AWPB template is a planning tool at 
the beginning of the year, monitoring tool during implementation and a reporting tool at the end of the 
year. 
  RIMS+ impacts surveys: The RIMS measures and reports on the results and impact of IFAD-
10.
supported Programmes and Programmes. The Programme reports annually on the RIMS indicators to 
IFAD. RIMS+ impact surveys will be conducted at baseline (HVAP Completion), mid-term and 
Programme completion. The RIMS+ impact surveys will be conducted in line with the IFAD’s RIMS 
Impact Survey Guidelines, which lays out a framework and practical guidance for these surveys under 
all IFAD-supported Programmes. Adjustments and modification to the standardised RIMS impact 
survey questionnaires and processes will be made to reflect the characteristics of the Programme 
area and activities. The RIMS surveys will also be adapted to include data related to extra indicators 
from the Programme logframe. As the RIMS is integrated into the Programme M&E system, the 
quality and reliability of the RIMS data depends on the M&E system of the Programme. Thus, the 
RIMS indicators are to be linked to the Annual Workplans and Budget. 
  Annual Outcome Surveys:  While IFAD has developed a standard methodology for impact 
11.
measurement, these impact surveys do not provide the type of results’ information that can allow 
Programme Management Teams to take timely, corrective action during the course of Programme 
implementation. Such impact surveys are primarily intended to document Programme impact at 
completion. In an effort to shift the focus toward outcome measurement during Programme 
implementation, IFAD now encourages all its Programmes to survey annually a small sample of 
beneficiaries in order to: 
 
 
 
 
measure  more  regularly  the  positive  or  negative  changes/outcomes  taking  place  at  the 
household;  
level provide early evidence of Programme success or failure; 
provide  timely  performance  information  so  that  corrective  actions  may  be  taken  if 
required; 
assess targeting efficiency. 
  Outcome monitoring measures the changes occurring as a result of Programme interventions. 
12.
This will entail annually measuring and assessing whether the Programme is moving towards 
achieving its objective. The surveys will also collect data for 2nd level RIMS indicators. To allow 
comparisons to be made, the surveys will gather data from three separate sub-groups and a control 
group of non-Programme households. Additional outcome indicators may be obtained by updating 
village profiles.  This survey will be outsourced to a service provider that will be contracted by the 
PCO.  
  Gender and M&E: The Programme Logframe asks for gender and ethnicity disaggregated 
13.
information for each sub-component. As part of the Programme RO-AWP&B monitoring and 
evaluation process, sex disaggregated formats that capture sex-disaggregated data at all levels and 
record progress against the baseline data will be used. Programme results and impacts will also be 
reported in sex disaggregated and ethnicity wise formats, and gender monitoring tools will need to be 
well integrated into the M&E unit of the Programme, with the inclusion of gender indicators and 
nutrition indicators. Programme staff responsible for data collection and monitoring should be trained 
in understanding and applying gender indicators. Detailed gender-sensitive indicators will need to be 
developed by the Programme’s GESI Adviser during the baseline data collection phase. A key role of 
the GESI Adviser will be to effectively integrate these indicators within the Programme’s performance 
measurement framework and to ensure all personnel with monitoring and evaluation responsibilities 
have the awareness and skills to measure against the gender-specific indicators. As part of the 
Programme M&E activities, gender studies will be conducted to assess impact on gender relations 
and women’s empowerment through the Women’s Empowerment Index.

Appendix 6:  Planning, M&E and learning and knowledge management 
  Nutrition in M&E: As this is the first Programme to address nutrition in value chains for IFAD in 
14.
Nepal, there will be a closely monitored intervention in this field. Through the Women’s Minimum 
Dietary Diversity Index, outcome and output indicators will be identified at the first round that will be 
included in the logframe and the MIS, to be monitored on a regular basis.  The Nutrition Specialist will 
work with the Programme Staff at the field level to closely monitor these indicators to ascertain 
progress on the RO-AWBP. The Specialist will also periodically conduct small studies and research. 
The Tribhuvan University offers a Masters course in Public Health and Nutrition and the students are 
required to do research on a related topic. The Nutrition Specialist can liaise with the University for 
some of the students to do their course work in the Programme’s operational area looking at the 
nutrition interventions.  
  Community participation: Participatory planning, monitoring and evaluation are of crucial 
15.
importance for the Programme as it has several levels and types of key stakeholders. The 
stakeholders will not be considered as mere sources of information, but will have control over the 
content and the process of the monitoring and evaluation engaging in taking or identifying corrective 
actions. The key stakeholders will actively engage in a process of reflection and analysis to ensure 
quality, efficiency and sustainability of the Programme. Only through transfer of knowledge and 
ownership built within the stakeholders this will be reached. The Programme will follow a participatory 
planning approach in the targeted area to ensure that the Programme captures and identifies 
communities’ needs and responds to the identified and prioritised needs of the target groups and the 
local context.  
  The planning will be undertaken in a participatory manner, engaging the different level and 
16.
types of stakeholders from Government, civil society and private sector and, most importantly, the 
beneficiaries at the community level. Through the support provided by Programme staff to the 
Government during the planning process, representation from, and participation by, all intended 
beneficiaries will be ensured - including the poorest and traditionally excluded. Ward level Programme 
staff should have their responsibility to support the planning and participatory monitoring mechanism 
clearly described in their Terms of References. Through periodic review meetings both at national and 
district level, as well as through Multi-Stakeholder Platforms for different commodities, the M&E 
system will feedback information into the planning process described. This participatory planning 
process is to be conducted at start-up to review the different level results defined at design, and again 
annually in conjunction with the annual planning process. During the annual planning process, 
findings and progress should be also presented to the stakeholders for their review.   
  The Programme will also implement a system of Participatory Monitoring and Evaluation 
17.
(PME) to generate feedback from Programme participants on a range of topics. Not only does this 
provide Programme management with valuable feedback on the implementation of activities and 
delivery of outputs, but also on the initial outcome and impact of these outputs in terms of steps taken 
by households to improve their livelihoods. One important issue that will need to be monitored is the 
coverage of the different Programme activities at the household level.  
  A single household may participate in more than one activity (such as different livelihood 
18.
activities), so monitoring is needed to determine how many households are directly participating in 
Programme activities. While PME could take the form of regular monthly or quarterly surveys, this 
may stretch the limited M&E resources of the Programme. A more practical solution may be to 
include some feedback questions in an annual outcome survey and to geo tag the households. The 
geo tagging will help monitor on a real time, the extent that Programme activities are benefiting the 
population.  
  Responsibilities for M&E: Regular and routine M&E activities will be the primary responsibility 
19.
of each of the Programme staff and implementing agencies, who shall establish and maintain the 
relevant systems to collect and analyse data at all the three monitoring levels. In particular, they will 
ensure that the indicators specified in the programme logframe are included in their respective M&E 
Plans. Results data will be compiled by each implementing agency and submitted to the PCO. In 
addition, trimester and Annual Progress Reports on results achieved against planned targets and 
218 
Nepal 
Agriculture Sector Development Programme 
Final programme design report 
Appendix 6:  Planning, M&E and learning and knowledge management 
reflecting on implementation performance will be prepared by each implementing partner and 
submitted to the PCO. The PCO will be responsible for organising and facilitating impact surveys and 
case studies.  
  One of the key lessons learnt from the previous IFAD funded Programmes in Nepal is that there 
20.
is need to establish M&E systems that are able to respond to information needs at different 
administrative levels of the programme, GoN, IFAD, participating private sector companies, civil 
society organisations and beneficiaries. To answer this challenge, the M&E system of the Programme 
will be aligned, to the extent possible, to existing GoN planning, monitoring and reporting processes, 
integrating to the M&E system the various requirements from other stakeholders.  
  Clear lines of communication and authority are needed to ensure the functionality of the M&E 
21.
system, and to avoid problems in relation to data gathering. The M&E and KM staff will also ensure 
that information and analyses developed by the Programme is fed back to the stakeholders.  
It has been observed under the HVAP that the Social Mobilisers spend up to 25 per cent of their 
22.
time in Programme data entry. This significantly reduces their time spent productively in the villages. 
To aid in the collection and entry of data, the Programme will introduce an internship component, 
whereby young educated youth who have either passed high school or who are in school can be paid 
a small stipend to collect Programme data. This could also be done by the LRPs, JTAs, etc. for a fee. 
Not only will the collection of data be expedited, but the people involved will also become part of the 
Programme, earning a small income. High school girls will be particularly targeted as their income can 
contribute to their higher education and other essentials that need financing.  
  Capacity building of Programme staff will be undertaken through a structured orientation 
23.
training programme, refresher training, and information sharing. Orientation training will be undertaken 
during induction of new staff, and the refresher training on an annual basis. In addition, the 
Programme will also facilitate the establishment of partnerships with technical experts (e.g. for KAP 
survey), and other development Programmes, to enhance exchange of information and mutual 
learning. Programme M&E staff are recommended to undertake the IFAD online M&E training.  
KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT 
  An effective knowledge management (KM) strategy should be able to clearly define the 
24.
contributing factors to the effective communication of knowledge between parties. In order to do so, it 
will consider the Programme's focal themes and context, so as to address the questions of what the 
needed information is, and how it may best be communicated. KM will be done systematically across 
the duration of the Programme. To enable effective knowledge sharing and management, results and 
lessons from the Programme will be systematically documented as part of Monitoring and Evaluation 
(M&E) functions. 
  The ASDP will focus on studying and researching the outcomes and impacts of the Programme 
25.
investments. Knowledge, Attitude and Practice (KAP) studies will form part of the KM strategy to 
assess all capacity building and knowledge product use. This new strategy considers KM to permeate 
staff’s tasks at every level, constituting a different approach to the tasks to be carried out by all, rather 
than a specific set of assignments that will be the sole responsibility of a person dedicated to carrying 
the strategy out. This philosophy implies the need for buy-in from all staff, and requires them all to be 
provided with the tools and capacity that will enable them to contribute to the strategy’s 
implementation.

Agriculture Sector Development Programme 
Final programme design report 
Appendix 6:  Planning, M&E and learning and knowledge management 
  M&E and KM: Through a strong link between planning M&E and KM, the Programme feeds 
26.
back its achievements to the stakeholders through which the importance of M&E will be felt. This in 
turn leads to more analysis, information and interest towards the Programme leading to better results. 
The Programme will update its KM strategy to make it more operational and to reflect knowledge 
products emanating from the analysis of the data.  
  Studies and Reports: In addition to the regular trimestral progress and financial reports, the 
27.
Programme will conduct at least the studies listed below. It should be noted that the timing and details 
and methods of data collection in relation to the different reports and studies will be defined by the 
Programme while developing its M&E plan. The Programme will ensure that all reports produced are 
disseminated and discussed through different critical reflection events to be organised both at local 
and national level.  
28.
In addition to the M&E activities conducted by the Programme, IFAD conducts external 
evaluations (at mid-term, as well as joint review missions. Joint Review missions are conducted at 
least annually. During the Joint Review Missions, the overall progress of the Programme is assessed 
and discussed. The missions also provide opportunities – if required – for agreeing to change in the 
annual plans of the Programme. The Programme should therefore see the Joint Review Missions as a 
chance to receive external advisory support and guidance and to discuss any changes that are seen 
as necessary to improve the performance of the Programme. The external mid-term review is a more 
rigorous external review that assesses the overall strategy of the Programme and reviews the 
achievement against the outputs and progress towards the outcomes and overall goal. During the 
Mid-term review changes to the design can be introduced.  
  The PCO will be responsible for collating, analysing, developing and publishing on a periodic 
29.
basis informational and promotional material by way of newsletters, pamphlets, brochures, booklets, 
charts, wall papers, audio-visual products, etc., and their widespread dissemination to the general 
public, related government agencies, the donor community, UN Agencies, NGOs and Programme 
communities, as relevant. For this purpose, web and mail postings, print and digital media, 
periodically organised workshops, conferences and seminars at different levels and public 
broadcasting may be deployed.  
Learning Opportunities:  
  The Programme’s learning system will comprise of district level trimester meetings (based on 
30.
MIS-generated reports) and national annual review meetings, capturing information on progress and 
lessons learned and finding solutions for implementation constraints. 
220

Appendix 6:  Planning, M&E and learning and knowledge management 
  Bi-annual Review Meetings: The semi-annual progress report will be discussed during the Bi-
31.
annual Review Meetings at the national level to be coordinated by the PCO. Over and above 
reviewing physical and financial progress for the period against annual targets, the Programme will 
also review the performance of each province, performance of service providers, implementation 
constraints, document lessons, and recommend and agree on actions to improve implementation.  
  A consolidated Annual Programme Review will be carried out towards the end of each fiscal 
32.
year, in addition to the annual reviews.  It shall assess performance in the achievement of physical 
and financial progress against annual targets. A review of progress towards development objectives 
as reflected in the Outcome Surveys will also be done, assessing success and failures and reasons 
thereof and lessons learned. In order to get feedback from beneficiaries on the Programmes 
relevance, effectiveness and quality of interventions and their impact, the Annual Review Workshops 
could be conducted at the provincial level beginning from the end of the 1st year of Programme 
implementation. The Annual Review Workshops should also go beyond merely being an assessment 
of Programme performance and become truly information sharing and learning events. A fair/ 
exhibition will be organised during these events wherein government schemes, new technologies and 
products that have relevance to improving the quality of life of the villagers as well as improving 
efficiency and productivity of livelihoods can be exhibited and demonstrated. Experts can be invited to 
give presentations and lectures and theme- and issue-based discussions that affect the daily lives of 
communities organised. 
  Mid-Term and Completion reviews: A Mid-term Review will be organised in the beginning of 
33.
PY3 of the Programme jointly between IFAD and the Government. A Completion Review will be 
organised towards the end of PY6. The Review will cover, among other things: (i) physical and 
financial progress as measured against the Programme’s AWPBs; (ii) performance and financial 
management of contracted implementing partners; (iii) an assessment of the efficacy of technical 
assistance (iv) the relevance of the Programme components to livelihoods in the Programme area 
and as a means of attaining Programme objectives (v) the efficacy and efficiency of implementing 
arrangements (vi) expected impact of the Programme on livelihoods, social aspects, gender, nutrition 
and environment (vi) the sustainability and risks associated with the Programme and (vii) 
recommendations to improve expected outcomes and impact (viii) propose changes in the 
components and activities to reflect the findings of the assessment of performance and impact. In 
addition, it is expected that the Review will look at the experience gained from Programme support on 
the policies and regulatory frameworks for its implementation. The Programme completion process 
will include stakeholder workshop(s) to give Programme stakeholders the opportunity to: (i) evaluate 
the performance of the Programme; (ii) to promote accountability; and (iii) to identify factors and 
responsibilities to increase the likelihood of sustainability, together with key success factors and 
shortcomings. 
Impact Studies: Prior to both the Mid-Term and the Completion Reviews, impact assessment 
34.
studies will be carried out to properly inform the review process. Given the short Programme duration, 
IFAD will determine at the end of the PY 2 whether sufficient progress has been achieved to justify the 
undertaking of a RIMS Mid-Term Impact survey, or whether only a RIMS impact survey shall be 
conducted towards the end of PY 5. The Programme should consider third party monitoring and 
remote sensing/GPS tracking for monitoring & supervision. 
  Learning Conferences: It is recommended that two Conferences/ Seminars/ Workshops at the 
35.
National Level should be organised at mid-term and end-Programme term respectively during which 
the learnings, experiences and impacts of the Programme as also of other similar governmental and 
donor supported Programmes can be shared. This will facilitate acquisition and dissemination of 
knowledge as well as institutionalisation of participation-promoting processes and procedures.

Appendix 7:  Financial management and disbursement arrangements 
C.  Financial Management and disbursement arrangements 
1. 
Budgeting. The budget process for ASDP will be conducted in line with national procedures which 
require  consultation  of  all  stakeholders,  including  beneficiaries.  The  budget  will  be  consolidated  by  the 
Planning Specialist or a professional in a similar role in coordination with the Finance Officer. The budget 
preparation at programme level  will need to be completed by the month of March of each  year to allow 
sufficient time for final approval before the beginning of the subsequent financial year (16th of July). 
2. 
Budget approval process will follow national procedures and will be in accordance with the country 
system.  When  budget  will  be  ready  at  ASDP  level,  this  will  be  transmitted  to  Ministry  of  Agriculture 
Development  (MoAD)  for  review  and  discussion. After  MoAD  approval  the  budget  will  be  transmitted  to 
MoF  and  the  National  Planning  Commission  (NPC);  MoF  will  review  and  approve  the  funding  on 
consultation  with  the  MoAD  and  ASDP,  NPC  would  review  and  approve  the  activities.  On  approval  of 
activities  and  budget,  the  ASDP  will  enter  the  budget  in  the  Line  Ministry  Budget  Information  System 
(LMBIS).  
3. 
Upon approval, the budget will be published in the Red Book. ASDP would allocate the budget as 
per Red Book to the various cost centres and intimate to the MoAD, FCGO and respective DTCOs.  The 
Red  Book  would  specify  the  budget  codes  and  funding  source.  The ASDP  should  adhere  to  the  GoN 
budgeting/accounting rules as well as the percentage of financing of activities from the various financiers.  
4. 
The  ASDP  approved  budget  will  be  inserted  into  the  FMIS  by  FCGO.  Budget  allocation  will  be 
available  real  time  at  the  district  branch  of  FCGO,  the  District  Treasury  Comptroller  Office  (DTCO)  for 
ASDP use.  
5. 
Disbursement arrangements and Flow of Funds. Disbursement arrangements for ASDP will be 
set-up using the country system. ASDP will be able to start its activities and spend funds, as soon as the 
first Annual Work programmed and Budget (AWPB) is approved by IFAD and the GoN and subsequently 
input in the FMIS. 
6. 
IFAD  would  make  funds  available  to  the  GoN  under  the  terms  and  conditions  of  the  Financing 
Agreement.  Programme  funds  would  flow  from  IFAD  via  a  single  Designated Account  (DA)  held  by  the 
ASDP  as  authorized  by  MoF  and  established  in  the  Nepal  Rastra  Bank.  Government  will  prefund  the 
project expenditures which would be paid by DTCO through TSA on request of the ASDP. 
Designated Account (DA). In accordance with the Financing Agreement and Section 4.04(d) of the 
7. 
General  Conditions,  immediately  after  entry  into  force  of  the  Financing Agreement,  the  GoN  shall  open 
and thereafter maintain in the Nepal Rastra Bank, an account denominated in US dollars for the purpose 
of financing the Programme, the “Designated Account”. The DA will be held by the ASDP as authorized by 
the Ministry of Finance (MoF) and  will be protected  against set-off, seizure  or attachment on terms and 
conditions proposed by the Borrower and accepted by IFAD.  
Initial Deposit into the Designated Accounts (Authorized Allocation): Upon the entry into force of the 
8. 
IFAD  loan  and  the  Borrower’s  request,  IFAD  will  make  a  withdrawal  of  USD 2.5 million  in  the  aggregate, 
from  the  Loan  Account  and  USD 0.5 million  in  the  aggregate  from  the  grant  account  on  behalf  of  the 
Borrower and deposit such amounts into the DA to carry out the Programme. 
Counterpart  government  contributions  payments  will  be  made  from  the  Federal  budget  by 
9. 
arrangement  of  the  MoF,  and  be  used  specifically  for  the  Nepalese  contributions  to  the  Programme. 
These contributions will be received annually/trimester in accordance with normal budget procedures.

Appendix 7:  Financial management and disbursement arrangements 
10.  The Programme will prepare the first Withdrawal Application (WA) to obtain the disbursement of the 
authorized allocation from IFAD. The initial advance will be transferred by IFAD in the Designated Account 
(DA), denominated in USD maintained at the central bank (Rasta Bank). 
11.  When  subsequent  WAs  will  be  ready  for  submission,  the  ASDP  Programme  Director  and  the 
Finance Officer will submit a letter to Rasta Bank to request the transfer of NPR equivalent of the WA from 
the DA in USD to a GoN account. The bank  will use the official buying exchange rate prevailing on that 
date.  
12.  After the transfer is executed, Nepal Rasta Bank will transmit a debit advice to ASDP together with 
proof  of  the  executed  transfer;  that  amount  will  be  the  USD  counter  value  of  the  WA  that  ASDP  will 
transmit to IFAD. The authorized signatories of ASDP will be the Programme Director and the programme 
Finance Officer whom will be delegated by MoF.  
13.  ASDP PCU would submit WAs on a trimester basis requesting the replenishment of the authorized 
allocation (Imprest Account arrangements). Such withdrawal applications shall be prepared in accordance 
with IFAD requirements with SOEs thresholds fixed at USD 50 000 for all cost categories. All expenditures 
above the established thresholds shall be accompanied by related supporting documentation, as well as 
all  expenditures  of  every  amount  related  to  contracts  of  value  exceeding  USD  50  000.  The  PCU  shall 
prepare and submit the withdrawal application to IFAD on a timely basis within  30 days after the end of 
each  trimester  starting  from  the  first  trimester  after  the  first  disbursement  is  made  or  anytime  when  the 
required amount is minimum USD 1 million. 
14. 
Internal  controls.  At  GoN  level,  the  main  internal  control  to  ensure  use  of  resources  within  the 
approved  budget,  alignment  of  expenditures  to  budget  lines  and  approved  annual  work  programme  is 
represented by the use of the TSA to disburse expenditures incurred for implementation of programme. 
15.  For  ASDP  it  is  not  foreseen  the  opening  of  any  programme  accounts  or  any  petty  cash  as  for 
disbursement purposes the programme will use the TSA hosted by the Surkhet DTCO and other DTCOs 
if there are cost centers apart from PCU. 
16.  When  a  payment  voucher  will  be  signed  off  by  the  Programme  Director,  a  payment  order  will  be 
prepared  and  submitted  to  DTCO.  That  office  will  review  alignment  to  approved  budget,  budget 
availabilities, source of funding and issue a check in the name of the supplier/beneficiary. The programme 
Finance  Officer  will  inform  the  supplier/beneficiary  to  come  to  office  to  collect  the  check.  In  the  future, 
current system may be replaced by bank transfers executed directly by DTCO. 
17.  Financial  management  (FM)  procedures  and  record  maintenance  at  all  level  will  be  properly 
documented in the PIM and consistently applied. The PIM shall include specific provisions regulating  the 
setting  up  of  internal  controls,  effective  monitoring  and  review  of  transactions,  accounting  software 
requirements  and  include  all  other  FM  practices  with  guidance  notes.  A  system  of  joint  signatory  for 
approving  TSA  disbursements,  WA  submissions,  DA  transactions  will  have  to  be  introduced.  Detailed 
procedures  for  adequate  recording,  management  and  safeguard  of  programme  fixed  assets  will  be 
disclosed in the PIM. 
18.  Accounting systems, policies, procedures and financial reporting. Accounting would be done 
using  the  national  chart  of  accounts,  based  on  cash  basis  of  accounting,  and  using  the  accounting 
software developed by ASHA for IFAD projects to meet accounting and reporting requirement of GoN and 
IFAD.P.  
19.  This software, developed by local software developer and being tested for the ASHA and suitable 
for other IFAD funded projects,, will allow the categorization of expenditures by categories, components, 
financier  and  by  percentage  of  financing.  In  addition,  it  will  automatically  prepare    WAs,  monitor 
228 
Nepal 
Agriculture Sector Development Programme 
Final programme design report 
Appendix 7:  Financial management and disbursement arrangements 
expenditures against budget and approved annual work programmes, generate trimester financial reports 
and annual financial statements in a format acceptable to IFAD.  
In  addition  to  IFAD  required  reports,  the  finance  unit  will  produce  monthly,  trimester  and  annual 
20. 
reports for reporting to MoAD as per government accounting and reporting requirement and the Surkhet 
DTCO for reconciliation purposes. 
21. 
Internal Audit. It would be performed in accordance with GoN rules and procedures. DTCO would 
perform internal audit missions to ASDP on a trimester or semi-annual basis. DTCO mandate requires the 
internal  audit  team  to  check  the  background  documentation  related  to  vouchers  to  ensure  compliance 
with  budget  allocation,  annual  work  programme  and  prevailing  Laws,  effectiveness  of  internal  control 
system, use of the financial resources in economical, efficient and effective manner, check actions taken 
to  settle  the  previous  internal  audit  observations  and  subsequent  payment  orders  presented  to  DTCO 
office  for  issuance  of  checks.  At  the  end  of  the  mission  an  internal  audit  report  containing  audit 
observations and relevant recommendations would be issued.  
In order  to  have more specific support and  approval  of MoF, ASDP, on an  six-monthly  basis,  will 
22. 
contract a private internal audit firm to perform internal controls review, propose improvements and issue 
recommendations.  Implementation  of  such  recommendations  shall  be  monitored  during  the  following 
exercise.  Main  duties  to  be  stipulated  in  the  TORs  will  include  monitoring  and  review  of  the  financial 
systems  and  procedures,  their  application  and  adherence  to  the  PIM,  support  the  introduction  of 
administrative  efficiencies.  It  will  be  a  good  practice  to  brief  OAG  audit  team  on  the  programme 
components,  methods  of  implementation,  monitoring  arrangements,  etc.  so  that  they  could  deliver  the 
reports  effectively.  Reports  prepared  by  the  internal  audit  firm  will  be  submitted  to  the  attention  of  the 
Programme Steering Committee and forwarded to IFAD.  
23.  External Financial Audit. It will be performed in accordance with GoN rules and procedures. OAG 
will  perform the  external financial audit of ASDP  using  ISSAI issued by  the INTOSAI. Statutory ToRs of 
OAG may be integrated with specific requests from IFAD.  
24.  Considering the GoN procedures, annual financial statements in accordance with GoN criteria and 
format  will  need  to  be  finalized  within  35 days  after  the  closure  of  the  financial  year  (by  August  20th). 
DTCO will perform its regular internal audit and ensure all observations are duly settled before issuing its 
report and approve annual financial statements (by the end of  September of each year). OAG team  will 
visit ASDP after the completion of DTCO work to perform the external audit and will issue the preliminary 
audit report by the end of the month of October of each financial year.  
25.  Between  the  months  of  October  and  November  ASDP  finance  team  will  complete  the  annual 
programme financial statements to be submitted to IFAD and  will request OAG to issue its audit opinion 
by  the  end  of  December  of  each  financial  year.  These  arrangements  will  ensure  timely  submission  of 
annual financial statements audit reports to IFAD.    
26.  Taxes. The proceeds of the IFAD financing may not be used to pay taxes which  will be part of the 
contribution of GoN to the programme. Considering the current taxation scheme for VAT at 13 per cent, 
GoN contribution to all categories of expenditures foreseeing the purchase of goods and services  will be 
fixed  at  least  at  15 per  cent.  Social  security  benefits  (employee’s  portion)  and  income  tax  (employee 
deductions) are eligible for IFAD financing.

FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT RISK ASSESSMENT 
Inherent risk at country level 
27.  Nepal became a republic in 2008 and has approved a new  Constitution of Nepal in 2015. Despite 
positive trends of development indicators, Nepal remains in absolute terms one of the poorest countries in 
229 
Nepal 
Agriculture Sector Development Programme 
Final programme design report 
Appendix 7:  Financial management and disbursement arrangements 
the world, it ranked 145th (out of 188 countries) in the TI Human Development Index 2015, and corruption 
is perceived to be pervasive.  
28.  Public Financial Management (PFM) system. The Government of Nepal (GoN) has undertaken a 
PFM  reform  programme  to  improve  performance,  transparency  and  accountability  in  the  use  of  public 
funds. The reform has been supported by donor partners who are playing a key role  in the financing  of 
public expenditure by accounting for one quarter of the total National Budget. A Multi Donors Trust Fund 
(MDTF) has been established under the aegis of WB to support the design of the reform on the basis of 
the outcome of the first PEFA assessment, which was released in 2008. 
29.  A second PEFA, published in 2015, recorded substantial improvements. In comparison to the 2008 
one,  out  of  28 performance  indicators,  16 improved,  and  9 received  an  “A”  score.  Improvements  were 
recorded  mainly  in  the  areas  of  credibility  and  comprehensiveness  of  the  budget  and  in  the  budget 
formulation process. 
 Credibility  was  strengthened  by  the  roll  out,  in  all  the  districts,  of  the  Treasury  Single  Account 
30. 
(TSA) system, which streamlined a multitude of state owned bank accounts into a unified single account 
structure  allowing  real  time  centralized  budget  execution  and  providing  up-to-date  information  on  cash 
resources. However, commitment control is still weak and a monitoring system is under development. 
31.  Comprehensiveness  has  been  achieved  with  the  introduction  of  a  budget  classification  in 
accordance  with  the  international  standards,  which  maintains  a  consistent  chart  of  accounts  throughout 
the  budget  cycle  (budgeting,  recording,  accounting,  reporting)  and  put  the  foundations  for  the 
development of a more integrated management information system. 
32.  Budget  formulation  is  set  with  a  clear  process,  in  terms  of  timing  and  responsibilities,  led  by  the 
Ministry  of  Finance  (MoF)  with  a  bottom  up  and  multi-years  planning  approach,  which  consolidates 
information from Ministries, Departments, Agencies and submits the plan to the Parliament for approval. 
However, a serious weakness of the system is represented by extra-budgetary expenditures (other than 
donor-funded  Programme),  accounting  for  more  than  10 per  cent  of  total  expenditure.  These 
expenditures are not captured in the budget cycle, in the annual financial statements, and in the external 
auditing. 
33.  The TSA roll out has strengthened cash basis accounting practices. The government is using cash 
basis accounting for the purposes of preparing annual financial statements and has released, in 2009-10, 
the Nepal Public Sector Accounting standards (NPSAS), based on IPSAS.  
34.  OAG  conducts  financial  audits  in  the  public  sector  (including  IFAD  funded  Programmes)  using       
INTOSAI  standards,  usually  within  8 month  after  financial  year  end.  Audit  reports  are  submitted  to  the 
parliament, through the President's Office, within  9 months after the  end  of the period covered. Reports 
are  also  made  available  to  the  public  on  the  OAG  website.  The  implementation  of  recommendations 
issued  as  well  as  the  settlement  of  irregularities  identified  are  not  yet  promptly  undertaken.  The  weak 
enforcement of corrective measures against irregularities contributes in weakening the PFM system.

35.  Use  of  country  systems.  The  government  Management  Information  System  (MIS)  comprises 
three major sub-systems:  
(i). 
(ii). 
(iii). 
the  Budget  Management  Information  System  (BMIS),  run  by  the  MoF  for  consolidating 
budget requests;  
the  Financial  Management  Information  System  (FMIS)  which  incorporates  the  TSA  system 
and it is run by the Financial Controller General Office (FCGO), under the MoF, in charge of 
treasury management, budget execution, financial reporting;  
the  Aid  Management  Platform  (AMP),  hosted  by  the  International  Economic  Cooperation 
Division  of  the  MoF,  an  on-line  platform  that  provides  public  access  to  information  on  all 
donor-funded development Programmes in Nepal.  
36.  All these systems are used by MoF. At ministerial and  Programme level there is extensive use of 
TSA, while the accounting and reporting functions are run autonomously by all entities using government 
accounting rules. Stand-alone accounting software must be purchased autonomously in the market. The 
single workstations are not linked in a net, nor provide real time info to MoF.  
37.  On AMP, the ministry enters key data for all “on-budget” Programmes, i.e. Programmes for which 
the donor funding passes through the government. On the other hand, development partners enter data 
on  planned  (once  a  year)  and  actual  (four  times  a  year)  disbursements  for  all  Programmes  both  on-
budget and off-budget. This system is used by the Government of Nepal and by development partners to 
ensure that aid is used for the purposes for which it has been planned. 
38.  Use on national procedures. According to the Development Cooperation Report 2014/15 issued 
by MoF, 64 per cent of total external financing was ''on-budget'' (in AMD), but only 29 per cent was ‘'on-
treasury''  (executed  via  TSA).  The  five  major  donors  (WB,  ADB,  DFID,  Japan,  Norway)  represented 
approximately  90 per  cent  of  total  "on-budget''  external  financing  and  overall  they  reach  an  average 
70 per  cent  compliancy  in  the  use  of  country  systems  (which  include  use  of  national  procedure  and 
systems for the management of budget, funds flow, accounting, reporting, audit, procurement). 
39. 
IFAD current portfolio is fully on-budget. IFAD funded Programmes largely use country systems 
in  the  area  of  budget,  accounting,  reporting,  funds  flow,  internal  audit  and  external  audit.  However, 
extensive  use  of  country  systems  still  exposes  IFAD  Programmes  to  fiduciary  risks  given  the  relatively 
weakness  of  certain  PFM  features  like  accounting  and  reporting.  Actual  expenditures  are  reported  into 
AMP  system  for  all  Programmes.  Designated  Accounts  are  all  held  at  the  Central  Bank  (Rasta  Bank). 
Programme financial statements are prepared following the National Standards of Accounting-cash basis. 
External  Audits  are  conducted  by  the  OAG  according  to  INTOSAI  standards  of  auditing  (ISSAI).  Audit 
reports  are  not  consistently  delivered  on  time/in  full  and  the  overall  assessment  rating  was  moderately 
satisfactory in the last few years. 
40.  Although PFM is based on a robust legislative framework and despite the credible PFM reform on-
going,  there  are  still  significant  gaps  in  implementation,  compliance  and  enforcement  to  be  filled.  The 
overall country inherent risk is rated High. 
Risk Control  
41.  Overall, ASDP will be operating in a rather high inherent risk environment due to the persistence of 
some weaknesses in the public sector financial management systems as outlined in the PEFA analysis. 
The proposed financial management arrangements for the programme incorporate a number of measures 
intended to reduce such risks to acceptable levels and ensure that (i) the programme funds are used for 
intended purposes in an efficient and effective way, (ii) reliable and timely financial reports are prepared, 
and (iii) programme assets and resources are safeguarded from unauthorized or wasteful use.

Comment. The programme will build on the capacity of the current HVAP one. HVAP depends on 
1. 
MoAD central office in Kathmandu but has a separate office in the city of Surkhet; from an FM 
perspective, interaction with MoAD is limited to the budget preparation and approval. Programme Director 
has full delegation of authority to operate the DA. The financial architecture for DA management is very 
strong with the possibility of moving out funds from the DA only to transfer these to government treasury 
accounts. Accounting and reporting of HVAP appears to be sufficiently solid even if in need of some 
244

Appendix 7:  Financial management and disbursement arrangements 
further improvements. The internal control environment is adequate considering the number and amount 
of transactions of the programme. The DTCO should increase the scope of internal audit as per Financial 
Procedure Act and regulation to cover all financial management and compliance with the prevailing Law 
and Financing Agreement. The programme should request to the Office of the Auditor General to conduct 
audit on time and issue audit report for submission to the IFAD within due date of six months from the end 
of the fiscal year. 
All the above assessment referred to HVAP constitutes a good foundation for the new ASDP. Risk 
2. 
factors to be considered include possible staff turnover, possible decentralization of activities. 
Considering the High country inherent risk, the fact that the PCU of ASDP still needs to be established, 
and the HVAP FM shortfall identified during the design, the overall FM risk rating is assessed as Medium.

Appendix 8:  Procurement 
Appendix 8:  Procurement 
Procurement and contracting of goods, civil work and services 
1. 
The government reformed the legal and institutional setup of public procurement processes in 2007. These 
reforms included the adoption of a new Public Procurement Act (PPA) and associated regulations, the decentralization 
of procurement, and the creation of the Public Procurement Management Office (PPMO) under the Prime Minister’s 
Office. The PPA follows the UNCITRAL model. Prior to this, procurement was regulated under the Financial 
Administration Act and Regulations, with no designated central oversight apart from the general control role played by 
the Financial Comptroller General’s Office (FCGO). Recently the PPA and associated regulations have been 
amended.  
The introduction of electronic bid submissions for government contracts has started to improve the integrity and 
2. 
value for money of public procurement. Since the PPA was passed in 2007, there have been improvements in the 
openness and fairness of the competitive bidding process, most notably through the introduction of e-bidding and a 
concomitant reduction in intimidation and violence. Prior to the introduction of e-bidding, reports were common of rival 
contractors and political parties hiring people to prevent bidders from entering government buildings to submit their 
bids. 
A centralized e-GP portal for e-submission was launched by the PPMO on a pilot basis in April 2016 in five 
3. 
major departments and rolled out to other departments from 1 January 2017. The current e-GP system requires the 
bidder to enter the unit rates online as opposed to the uploading of the filled-in Bill of Quantities. The use of the e-GP 
system for procurement has been made mandatory from the beginning of next fiscal year (mid-July 2017). It is 
understood that around 2,500 personnel have been trained (government and bidder) on the use of this system. 
According to the PPMO, registration now covers 201 public entities and 375 firms and the numbers are rapidly 
increasing. There have been more than 300 procurements after the launch of e-GP system. The e-GP system has a 
banking interface for verification of securities.  
In spite of progress with bidding procedures, challenges remain in public procurement integrity. First, 
4. 
procurement at local levels has been subject to political “capture” within the more general distortions of public sector 
governance. Local procurement is used to fund contractors connected to the dominant political parties in a particular 
locality, with the strong perception that financial rents flow back to provide funding for party machines. Second, 
collusion and intimidation in the procurement process are still seen as significant problems, even if the exact scale and 
prevalence are difficult to estimate. 
Technical procurement challenges also hamper efforts to improve value for money. First, procurement planning 
5. 
and bidding processes are often delayed, exacerbating the bunching of expenditures towards the end of the fiscal 
year. Second, local private sector firms complain that the provisions of the 2007 PPA are too onerous. Third, there is 
reported to be insufficient capacity for the estimation of program (e.g. consulting costs). 
Related to these technical factors, the law and regulations intentionally favour domestic companies. The Public 
6. 
Procurement Regulations (PPR) state, “In procuring goods by selecting any method as referred to in these 
Regulations, a Public Entity shall have to procure Nepali goods even if the price of the goods produced in Nepal is 
higher by up to fifteen per cent than the foreign goods.” Similarly, the PPR requires that any civil works contract 
between NPR 20 million and NPR 1 billion be only procured from domestic bidders. In an international bid for a civil 
works, between NPR 1 billion to NPR 5 billion, a foreign bidder can only bid as a joint venture with a domestic bidder, 
unless the agreement with the development partner indicates otherwise. 
The recent PPA and associated regulations amendment, inter alia, requires the use of two envelop procedures 
7. 
for civil works for estimates over NPR 20 million. It also removed the requirement of qualification criteria such as 
experience, turnover and cash flows for a contract up to NPR 20 million. Previously the amount was NPR 6 million. 
The change in the provision means that any registered bidder will be eligible to get a contract, mainly based on the 
price it has offered, although it may not have the capacity to do the work.  
User committees are utilized for the implementation of small capital Programmes at the district level, but weak 
8. 
controls and political influences have resulted in fund leakages and compromised Programme quality. To promote 
local resources, the PPR gave construction authority to user committees (UCs) for up to NPR 6 million which in March 
2017 has been increased to NPR 10 million. The increased figure is reportedly a high threshold. Many local officials 
247 
Nepal 
Agriculture Sector Development Programme 
Final programme design report 
Appendix 8:  Procurement 
reported that UCs were awarded a contract for the maximum threshold before subcontracting the Programme for a 
lower amount, receiving a “kick-back” in exchange. Furthermore, several UCs can be involved in the construction of 
one road, with each managing the construction of the section of road that falls within its community. 
Previously the regulation barred UC to use heavy machineries such as a loader, excavator, roller, dozer, grader, 
9. 
bitumen distributor and bitumen boiler in the construction work. The recent amendment allows the use of heavy 
machineries if its use was considered at the time of estimation. The UC are not allowed to subcontract the works and 
are to construct the work themselves, however, it has been found that these provisions have been violated. The recent 
increase in the UC threshold and allowing the use of machineries is being opposed by the Federation of Contractor’s 
Association Nepal (FCAN). 
10.  The PPMO was established in 2007 in accordance with the adoption of a new procurement act and regulations. 
Its central oversight role is primarily facilitative. It is obliged to suggest further reforms in procurement policy and laws, 
issue technical guidelines and manuals and models for standard bidding documents, roll out training for officials at 
public entities involved in procurement and collect statistics on procurement. Recent amendment in the procurement 
act has entrusted the PPMO to prepare database qualification and experience of bidders and consultants, 
accreditation of procurement specialists, recommend the public entity to rectify the defects in the procurement and 
initiate action against officials involved in the procurement process, if the rules and regulation or the directives were 
not adhered to during procurement.  
11.  Recent amendment to the procurement rules has added the responsibility of establishing, operating and 
managing an electronic procurement through a single portal on PPMO. The amendment has also provided for two 
envelop bidding procedures. Although the PPMO has a central procurement portal, it has not been able to build 
capacity of the vast number of staff involved in the procurement unit and the bidder community on the use of the 
electronic (e-GP) system. 
12.  There are numerous challenges facing public procurement in Nepal, including low capacity of the PPMO and 
most procuring entities, and a weak private sector, aggravated by law enforcement issues. The function of public 
procurement at the local levels (e.g., the municipalities under the Federal system), where capacity to implement 
procurement is almost non-existent, needs more attention.  
13.  The Government of Nepal, supported by different development partners active in the country, is implementing 
several initiatives to strengthen the capacity of the PPMO, procuring entities, and oversight bodies, and to modernize 
the system through the introduction of e-GP. It appears however, that the resources needed to successfully complete 
the ongoing and additional initiatives for improving different aspects of public procurement are limited. The Nepal 
Public Procurement Strategic Framework (NPPSF II) 2013-2016, prepared through wider consultation, has listed three 
key areas of intervention/actions to improve the performance of public procurement. They are: (i) Standardization of 
Public Procurement Process and Dissemination; (ii) Capacity Enhancement of Public Procurement System; and 
(iii) Operationalization and Mainstreaming of e-GP. The capacity constraints of procurement entities have been largely 
responsible for executing timely procurement and timely award of contract. The transition of traditional procurement to 
e-GP represents an important phase in the procurement reform process in Nepal. A review of the implementation 
progress reveals that the success of e-GP will greatly depend on: (i) the readiness and acceptability of the bidding 
communities, Procuring Entities (PEs) and oversight agencies; (ii) availability of support including logistics to switch 
over; and (iii) uninterrupted IT services including round the clock access to the central server of e-GP. These are the 
areas where the PPMO, in collaboration with the key sector agencies, has to invest major efforts in terms of training, 
technical backstopping and infrastructure support. With these initiatives, it is imperative that the performance of the 
public procurement is measured and disseminated to the stakeholders with a set of key measurable performance 
indicators and increasing accessibility to the data on public procurement through e-GP. 
14.  The role of the PPMO is limited in two ways that serve to reduce its effectiveness. First, as noted above, it does 
not have a legal mandate to ensure information related to bidding processes is made public. Second, it does not have 
a role in handling procurement complaints. Under a two-stage review process, complaints are submitted first to the 
chief of the concerned public entity and then, if necessary, to a review committee formed by the government. The 
committee comprises a judge/ex-judge/ex-Secretary, an engineer, and a procurement specialist not currently 
employed by a public entity. One power assigned to the PPMO is blacklisting of contractors for a period of one to three 
years, based on misconduct in the bidding process or in Programme execution.

Appendix 8:  Procurement 
Key lessons on procurement in IFAD Country Portfolio 
15.  Performance reviews of IFAD Programmes in Nepal identify weaknesses in Programme procurement 
performance, primarily associated with non-compliances and weaknesses in the preparation of bid documentation, 
technical specifications, evaluation of bids, contract management and performance assessments. These weaknesses 
are further aggravated due to the lack of adequately qualified and trained procurement staff in the programme 
coordination units and weakness in procurement record keeping. As the Programmes/programmes are mainly rural 
development in nature, being implemented in remote and inaccessible areas, the size of the procurement is generally 
small/medium except for the engagement of NGOs or service providers. 
It has been found that turnover of experts proposed by the NGOs recruited, based on the Least Cost Based 
16. 
Selection as provided by the PPA/PPR, to be extensive in the HVAP. The main reason seems to because of the low 
remuneration proposed by the NGO. To mitigate this risk, the method of selection needs to be changed or the 
TOR/contract needs to fix salaries of the expert and request for competitive prices on other items.  
17.  Generally, design and supervision aspects in the Programmes have been found to be lacking due to insufficient 
personnel being deployed. Provision should therefore be made for enough personnel, if these activities are to be 
handled directly by the Programme. 
Procurement arrangements for ASDP 
18.  Procurement. Procurement of goods, works and services under ASDP financed from resources provided or 
administered by IFAD will be undertaken in accordance with the provision of the PPA 2007 and associated 
regulations, the PPR 2007 as amended from time to time to the extent they are consistent with the provisions of 
IFAD’s Procurement Guidelines and Handbook (dated September 2010) and as amended from time to time.  
19.  To assist in mitigating the lack of capacity of the newly formed institutions/municipalities, the PCO will have 
dedicated specialist staff focused on financial, contracts and procurement management. During the program start up, 
a financial management and procurement expert will be provisioned to provide on the job training for the staff involved 
in financial and procurement management, as well as to assist in finalizing the procurement plan.  
20.  There is inadequate technical expertise for infrastructure, for the design and supervision of infrastructure works 
such as roads, small scale irrigation, multipurpose water supply, etc. Additional technical staff are required to design 
and supervise these works. This may be carried out by adding in-house staff in the PCO or outsourcing the work to 
consulting firms.    
21.  National Competitive Bidding, National Shopping and Direct Contracting: Goods, Services (non-consulting) and 
civil works to be procured using NCB, Shopping and Direct Contracting will follow the procedures and processes 
defined in the PIM approved by PSC and IFAD. The PIM shall also include details of selection methods to be applied 
in case of consultancy services such as Quality and Cost Based Selection (QCBS), Fixed Budget Selection (FBS), 
Least Cost Selection (LCS), Consultants Qualification Selection (CQS) and Single Source Selection (SSS). The PIM 
will also outline the procedures for the selection of individual consultants and individual service providers.  
22.  National Competitive Bidding: The procedures to be followed for national competitive bidding shall include the 
clarifications and modifications described in the following paragraphs required for compliance with the provisions of 
the IFAD Procurement Guidelines.  
 
 
 
 
 
Anti-Corruption. Definitions of corrupt, fraudulent, collusive and coercive practices shall reflect the latest 
IFAD Board-approved Anti-Corruption Policy definitions of these terms and related additional provisions 
(such  as  conflict  of  interest,  etc.);  and  IFAD's  right  to  audit  the  contract  and  the  accounts  of  the 
contracted parties; 
Rejection of All Bids and Rebidding. Bids shall not be rejected and new bids solicited without IFAD’s prior 
concurrence; 
Member Country Restrictions. No restriction applicable to IFAD resources unless National Policies apply 
such restriction; 
Qualification  Requirements.  A  successful  bidder  must  be  determined  by  an  assessment  process  that 
shall include the application of qualification requirements to all bids; 
Contract  awards  works,  goods  and  services  (non-consulting)  shall  be  based  on  the  lowest  evaluated 
price of compliant bids from eligible and qualified bidders; and

Appendix 8:  Procurement 
 
A  single-stage  two-envelope  procurement  system  shall  not  be  allowed  for  goods  and  services  (non-
consulting). 
23.  The detailed procedures for procurement will be adapted and adopted in accordance with the provisions 
PPA 2007 and associated regulations, consistent with IFAD Procurement Guidelines and the Procurement Handbook 
with the following emphasis to mitigate risk ensuring compliance to the provisions of the Procurement Guidelines: 
I. 
Registration of Bidders: Registration previous to bidding as a due diligence process for screening bidders 
legal  and  fiscal  capacity.  It  is  also  usual  to  use  registration  as  a  means for  prequalification,  especially  for 
civil works and in some cases service providers; 
II.  Open  Bid  National  Competitive  Bidding:  The  Programme  will  impose  through  the  PIM  the  use  of  well-
formulated bidding documents which will result in bid submissions that are free from qualifications. The PIM 
will expand and articulate the following rules and procedures for the implementation of the ASDP:  
a.  Effective Advertisement. Advertisement should be broad enough (using the appropriate media) and give 
enough time to bidders for preparing their bid. To the extent possible, bidding opportunities should also be 
advertised  electronically.  The  minimum  requirement  should  be:  (i) mandatory  publication  in  one  local 
newspaper in addition to the official gazette (if existent); (ii) web-page: if the borrower (or the Country) has 
a  web-page,  all  bidding  opportunities  should  be  advertised;  (iii) advertisement  in  United  Nations 
Development  Business  or  other  electronic  means  such  as  the  e-Government  Procurement  portal 
(www.bolpatra.gov.np); 
b.  Eligibility.  Eligibility criteria and  procedures should not deny bidders access to  a bidding process  or an 
award for reasons which are not related to their qualification to carry out the contract. Consequently, the 
procedures should: (i) be based on the ability of bidders to carry out the contract and should not include 
additional  restrictions  (not  related  to  such  ability);  (ii) no  restrictions  to  foreign  bidders;  (iii) local 
blacklisting  for  fraud  and  corruption  carried  out  with  due  process  and  with  rights  for  accused  firms  to 
defend themselves; 
c.  Qualification  of  Bidders.  The  procedures  should  define  post  qualification  as  the  preferred  rule. 
Prequalification should be restricted to civil works, especially for large or complex contracts or for  special 
cases  with  due  justification.  The  review  of  bidders’  qualification  should  be  conducted  by  examining 
whether the bidder does or does not meet qualification criteria and not by using a point system reflecting 
the bidders’ qualification. Conducting a pre-selection instead of a pre-qualification should not be accepted, 
i.e.,  pre-qualification  means  that  all  candidates  who  have  been  determined  to  be  qualified  should  be 
invited  to  bid  whereas  pre-selection  means  that  the  government  agency  is  free  to  invite  any  of  those 
candidates but does not have to invite all of them. No bidder should be disqualified due to bureaucratic or 
non-substantial reasons; 
d.  Standard  Bidding  Documents  &  Standard  Contract:  Standard  Bidding  Documents  are  of  paramount 
importance  for  transparency,  speed  of  the  process,  increase  competition  and  creation  of  capacity 
(standardization of procedures). The SBD to be used in all local open bidding processes will be described 
in  the  PIM  and  it  should  include:  (i) time  to  submit  bid:  minimum  30  days;  (ii) bids may  be  submitted  by 
post or by hand or electronically; (iii) budget: could be disclosed (if local legislation so requires); (iv) clear 
instructions on how to buy bidding documents indicating address and price to buy the bidding documents, 
however, bidders who decide to submit a bid without having bought the bidding documents should not be 
disqualified, submitting their bids under their own risk; (v) clarifications to bidding documents should be in 
writing only; (vi) amendments to bidding documents should be advertised with the same procedure used 
for advertisement of bidding documents; (vii) number of Envelopes: Single stage one envelope will be the 
preferred  option.  Single  stage  two  envelope  method  may  be  used  with  no  objection  from  IFAD; 
(viii) evaluation  Criteria:  the  bid  evaluation  criteria  should  be  non-discriminatory.  It  should  be  disclosed 
and  rigorously  quantified  in  monetary  terms  to  define  the  “lowest  evaluated  bidder”.  This  allows  to 
indisputably  identify  the  lowest  evaluated  responsive  bid.  Quantifying  bid  evaluation  criteria  in  monetary 
terms  is  the  only  method  that  leads  to  transparent  evaluation  and  that  allows  bidders  to  submit  an 
effective protest to the awarding authority; 
e.  Language (bidding documents and contract). The language of commercial use in the country; 
250 
Nepal 
Agriculture Sector Development Programme 
Final programme design report 
Appendix 8:  Procurement 
f.  Bid Prices (and Payments): The PIM should define in the bidding documents, the price (and payments) 
conditions: (i) the local (or any internationally used) currency could be used; (ii) for countries with high 
inflation all contracts should have price adjustment; (iii) for countries with stable currency, price 
adjustment should be included for contracts longer than 12 months; (iv) the method of payment should be 
defined in the bidding document; (v) the currency of payment should be the same of the bid prices; (vi) the 
employer should automatically pay interest for late payments; and (vii) price adjustment formulas should 
not be used in bid evaluation;  
g.  Bid & Performance security: The PIM will prescribe the generally accepted practice used in the local 
market (securities issued by banks or by sureties). Alternative methods (like automatic penalty to bidders 
failing to honour a bid) in lieu of bid securities could be accepted. Retention of payment could also be 
used instead of performance security; 
h.  Liquidated damages. Should be similar to the internationally accepted norms. 
i.  Complaints  &  Settlement  of  Disputes.    Losing  bidders  should  be  allowed,  through  an  effective 
mechanism,  to  submit  protests  pertaining  to  contract  award.  More  generally,  the  private  partner  in  a 
government contract must be proactive in implementing competitive mechanisms and, in fact, should be a 
guardian  of  those  mechanisms  exactly  in  the  same  manner  as  government  agencies.  The  goal  in  the 
protest handling system should be:  
1)  complaints should be accepted at any time. Those received before bids are submitted should be 
addressed before bid opening. All others should be taken into account, but the response should 
be announced only after award is recommended; 
2) 
3) 
the  PIM  will  outline  an  administrative  process  for  dealing  with  complaints  including  an 
independent reviewer for the answers provided by the procuring entity;  
the protests should be submitted to an independent entity and not simply to the supervisor of the 
contracting agency. Specifically, bid evaluation committees, which are the arm of the government, 
can  only  carry  administrative  reviews.  Their  membership  does  not  allow  for  arbitration  or  quasi-
arbitration of the dispute and therefore an independent protest mechanism should be provided to 
review award disputes before the contract award is final;  
4)  when  protests  are  submitted  before  award  they  may  lead  to  revisit  the  award  of  the  contract; 
when  protests  are  submitted  after  the  award,  their  only  consequence  should  be  the  bidder’s 
entitlement to compensatory damages for the cost of bid preparation; 
5)  contracts  should  include  a  system  for  settlement  of  disputes.  The  use  of  a  Dispute  Resolution 
Board should be encouraged before disputes be submitted to arbitration or to courts.  
j.  Bid Opening. Public bid opening of all bids, and recording of the opening in minutes signed by all bidders 
in attendance is required. In addition:  
1) 
late Bids should be rejected; 
2)  procedures for bid opening should be the same as those used for ICB; 
3)  minutes should follow the same procedure as for ICB; 
4)  safeguard of price envelope (when two envelopes is used). 
k.  Confidentiality. After bid opening and until contract award, all information about bids and their evaluation 
should be confidential. For transparency reasons, the evaluation report and all non-proprietary information 
could be made available to the public after an award recommendation has been published.  
l.  Evaluation of Bids. Bids should be evaluated by an independent evaluation committee to the defined in 
the PIM at the level of the PCO with special consideration for: 
1)  clarification  of  bids:  To  assist  in  the  examination,  evaluation,  and  comparison  of  the  bids,  and 
qualification of the Bidders, the Employer may, at its discretion, ask any Bidder for a clarification 
of  its  Bid.  Any  clarification  submitted  by  a  Bidder  that  is  not  in  response  to  a  request  by  the 
Employer shall not be considered. The Employer’s request for clarification and the response shall 
be  in  writing.  No  change  in  the  prices  or  substance  of  the  Bid  shall  be  sought,  offered,  or 
permitted, except to confirm the correction of arithmetic errors discovered by the Employer in the 
evaluation of the Bids; 
251 
Nepal 
Agriculture Sector Development Programme 
Final programme design report 
Appendix 8:  Procurement 
2) 
responsiveness:  The  evaluation  committee’s  determination  of  a  bid’s  responsiveness  shall  be 
based on the contents of the bid itself subject to any clarifications received; 
3)  qualification of the bidder should be conducted separately from the evaluation of its bid; 
4) 
lowest  evaluated  cost  criteria:  The  award  should  be  made  to  the  bidder  having  submitted  the 
lowest evaluated responsive bid; 
5)  use of a point system to evaluate bids: scoring is an indirect way to express the outcome of post-
qualification or of the technical analysis of the bid a point system should not be accepted; 
6) 
rejection  of  all  bids:  borrower  may  reject  all  bids  if:  (i) all  bids  are  not  responsive;  (ii) the  price 
offered  by  the  lowest  bidder  is  substantially  higher  than  the  confirmed  good  estimate  for  the 
contract;  (iii) the  process  was  not  competitive,  i.e.,  only  few  bids  (less  than  3)  were  offered 
although several bidders could be interested in bidding. 
m.  Award  Criteria.  The  award  should  be  made  to  the  bidder  having  submitted  the  lowest  evaluated 
responsive bid. Award of contract should be without negotiations, since negotiations  will lead bidders not 
to submit their best bid at the time of bid submission and will affect the perception of transparency, one of 
the main benefits deriving from public bidding.  
24.  National or Local Shopping.  Procurement procedures other than open competitive bidding must be restricted 
and contained within appropriate limits. Restricted bidding is appropriate for small value contracts, and situations in 
which there is only a very small number of potential candidates. Consequently, very specific thresholds should be 
defined below which this method of procurement could be applied. In addition, the following minimum requirements 
should apply: 
a.  Number of invitees & criteria for choosing: 
1)  Minimum of 3 proposals received. However, the process should be open to whoever wants to bid, 
even if not invited; 
Invited firms should not be repeated, if possible. Except if other firms do not exist. 
2) 
b.  Standard  request  for  bids.  Simplified  document  asking  proposals  by  letter,  by  fax  or  using  electronic 
means; 
1)  Evaluation:  
•  
•  
Minimum price; or 
Combination of price and delivery time, in which case delivery time will be evaluated in 
monetary terms added to price. Minimum overall evaluated price will result in award. 
25.  Consultants and Service Provider Selection Process: The PIM shall elaborate the provision as prescribed in 
the Procurement Handbook in term of selection of consultants in line with the Provisions of IFAD Procurement 
Guidelines.  In this case the minimum requirements should prevail: 
a)  Registration: The same conditions described for bidder for goods and works above should be complied 
with; 
b)  Advertising:  Borrowers  should  advertise  the  assignment  for  expression  of  interest  by  firms.  The 
advertisement should include:  
1)  mandatory publication in one local newspaper, in addition to the official gazette (if existent); 
2)  web-page:  if  the  borrower  (or  the  Country)  has  a  web-page  the  bidding  opportunities  should  be 
advertised  including  UN  Development  Business  or  other  electronic  means  as  the  e-Government 
Procurement portal (www.bolpatra.gov.np). 
c)  Short-List: Borrowers should use a short-list of 3 to 6 firms to request proposals. This short-list may result 
from comparing qualifications and experience among firms that have expressed interest; 
d)  Standard RFP & Standard Contract: The standard RFP will be described and included in the PIM similar 
to that used for Selection of consultants;  
e)  Selection Process: Short-list; QCBS (other methods when justified) to be elaborated in the PIM; 
f)  Award  criteria:  highest  combined  score  (preferably  using  the  following  range  between  70 per  cent  to 
90 per cent for the technical score and 30 per cent to 10 per cent for the price);

Appendix 8:  Procurement 
26.  All procurement for goods, works and services financed from resources funded or administered by IFAD require 
bidding documents and the contracts to include a provision requiring suppliers, contractors and consultants ensure 
compliance with IFAD zero tolerance to anticorruption policy and to permit IFAD to inspect their accounts, records and 
other documents relating to the bid submission and contract performance, and to have them audited by IFAD-
appointed auditors.  
Procurement, Procurement Plan and Applicability 
27.  Procurement will be as per the Consolidated Procurement Plan submitted by the PCO, ASDP and approved by 
the PSC and IFAD. The PCO will submit an 18 month Procurement Plan immediately after the Programme enters into 
force and in the subsequent programme years submit an annual Procurement Plan.  
28.  As provided in appendix I, paragraph 1 of IFAD’s Procurement Guidelines, IFAD review of and no objection to 
the consolidated procurement plan is compulsory and the 18 month procurement plans submitted by the Recipient 
must include as a minimum:  
 
 
 
 
a  brief  description  of  each  procurement  activity  to  be  undertaken  during  the  period  and  name  of  the 
implementing agency responsible for the procurement; 
the estimate value of each procurement activity; 
the method of procurement to be adopted for each procurement activity; and  
the  method  of  review  IFAD  will  undertake  for  each  procurement  activity  indicating  either  post  review  or

Appendix 9:  Programme cost and financing 
Appendix 9:  Programme cost and financing 
Programme costs 
The main assumptions underlying the derivation of Programme costs, estimated Programme 
1 
costs and the financing plan are: 
a. 
b. 
c. 
d. 
e. 
f. 
The Programme costs are based on August 2017 prices. 
The proposed Programme will be financed over a six-year period (2018-2023). 
Inflation. Domestic inflation will be about 8.5 per cent in 2016, around which it is 
expected to hover in the medium-term future. A domestic inflation rate of 8 per cent has 
been applied across the Programme life. Foreign inflation was set at 2 per cent p.a. over 
the Programme period, based on the MUV (15) Index.  
Exchange Rate. The Base Exchange rate for this analysis has been set at NPR 102 to 
USD 1 as an official exchange rate prevailing in August 2017 (rounded). 
The Programme costs are presented in both NPR and USD. Conversions from current 
USD values into Nepal Rupees use constant purchasing power exchange rates: 
Taxes and Duties. There is value added tax (VAT) of 13 per cent levied on all imported 
and locally procured goods and services. Vehicles have a tax of up to 230 per cent 
depending on an engine power. International technical assistance does not carry any 
taxes. Social security benefits (employee’s portion) and income tax (employee 
deductions) are eligible for IFAD financing. 
g. 
The Government will finance the cost of all taxes on goods and services procured under 
the Programme. 
The total investment and incremental recurrent Programme costs, including physical and price 
2 
contingencies, as detailed in Table 1, are estimated at about USD 68.1 million (NPR 7.0 billion). 
Physical and price contingencies make up 21 per cent of the total Programme costs. The foreign 
exchange component is estimated at USD 5.7 million or about 8 per cent of the total Programme 
costs. Taxes and duties make up approximately USD 8.3 million (12.1 per cent). Programme 
management costs amount to USD 7.6 million (about 11.2 per cent of the total Programme costs). 
Hard investments in equipment, co-financing value chain development and public and community 
infrastructure, constitute 60 per cent of total Programme costs and 58 per cent of the IFAD loan 
amount. International TA for support forms 0.7 per cent of total Programme costs and 1.1 per cent of 
the IFAD loan and grant financing and is fully covered by grant finance.

Appendix 9:  Programme cost and financing 
Programme financing 
An IFAD Loan of USD 38.2 million will finance 56.1 per cent of total Programme cost, including: 
3 
48.1 per cent of Sub-component 1: Inclusive and sustainable agriculture value chains expanded and 
diversified, for which the total cost is USD 21.7 million; 67.8 per cent of Sub-component 2: Market-
oriented infrastructure functional, for which the total cost is USD 18.6 million; 75 per cent of Sub-
component 3: Rural financial services for value chain development strengthened, for which the total 
cost is USD 4.6 million; 51 per cent of Sub-component 4: Agriculture services sustainably support 
innovation and value chain development, for which the total cost is USD 16.1 million and 49.2 per cent 
of the Programme Coordination Component, which has a total cost of USD 7.6 million. An IFAD grant 
of USD 1.8 million (2.6 per cent of total cost) will support Programme specialised TA, training and 
studies. SDC will provide a grant of USD 3.0 million  
Technical Assistance.  In alignment with IFAD Grant Policy and the Government of Nepal’s 
4 
Development Cooperation Policy (2014), given Nepal’s current status as a highly concessional 
borrower, the Grant funds, of USD 1.8 million, have been specifically sought to finance international 
and national technical assistance in the areas where it could would provide for the capacity 
development of the newly decentralized offices in municipalities and wards, and build the 
sustainability of this programme.  The major activities envisioned under Grant financing include (i) 
development of the Strategic Investment Plans for up to 10 products to ensure their viability for value 
chain development; (ii) Technical Assistance to build the business development services that will be 
offered by ASDP; (iii) Technical assistance to capacitate the devolved DCCs in convening the multi 
stakeholder platforms; (iv) Technical assistance to ensure that the financial service providers have 
sufficient risk appetite and products to promote the move to rural areas and to lending to small holder 
farmers within a value chain; (v) Technical assistance for the implementation of household

FINANCIAL ANALYSIS 
A. Objective and methodology.  
  The objective of the financial analysis is to demonstrate viability of the project’s proposed 
6.
inventions at the enterprise and farming household levels. The methodology employed is to establish 
individual gross margin enterprise budgets for cropping and livestock activities to demonstrate the 
efficiency of investment through positive changes in net income following project implementation. 
These budgets provide the basic building blocks of the household farming business as expressed in 
farm budgets. Farm budgets are developed for each of the value chain commodities identified for the 
ASDP as well as for other farmed crops so as to develop a household perspective. A farm budget is 
therefore a function of the farm’s cropping (and in some cases) livestock production pattern and the 
representative budgets for that household type. The farm budget also reflects the investments, the 
debt service, the on-farm use, household consumption and the labour availability. The financial and 
economic analysis is formulated on an incremental basis and as such compares the with project (WP) 
situation to the without project (WoP). In this way, the incremental net benefit is the basis of the 
appraisal. 
  This section presents the assumptions and the results of the individual enterprise budgets and 
7.
farm budgets178. It is worthy to note that the farm budget analysis examines whole farm not just the 
value chain commodity in question179. Conclusions can therefore be drawn at a household level as 
opposed to an enterprise level. 
  Enterprise and activity production models. A listing of the models developed for the analysis is 
8.
shown in Table 10.1 below. Variants of some models are developed to account for altitude. Note the 
non-value chain “other models” required to develop an overall farm household perspective. The prices 
of the inputs to, and outputs from these models are provided the Annex 1 Table 1.

178 This modelling is undertaken using the World Bank/FAO/IFAD’s FARMOD software Version 4.02, running in Oracle 
VirtualBox Version 5.1.20. 
179 The subsequent economic analysis aggregates the farm budgets according to the adoption phasing, converts the 
values into economic terms and presents net incremental benefits from a project perspective.

B. Value Chain Production Models – Field and Orchard Commodities 
  Apples. Three apple models have been developed for this analysis each describing different 
10.
components of apple production. The models are: current production orchards, current orchards in 
pre-production and new orchards that would be developed under ASDP. The model shown below 
(Table 10.2) is the current production scenario (others are included in the Annex 1 Tables 4 to 7). The 
current orchards are assumed to be producing A and B grade apples at yields of 3.8 and 11.2 tonnes 
per ha respectively. With the ASDP these yields are expected to increase to 10.8 tonnes per ha for the 
Grade A product and decline to 7.2 tonnes per hectare for the B Grade product. Net income before 
and after labour costs is projected to increase by 70 and 58 per cent respectively.

  Formulating a representative household farm according to a typical cropping pattern. Each 
VC farm will then consist of the VC commodity plus other typical crops for such a household.

These crops are: maize, wheat and paddy rice. In addition, for the livestock related models, 
irrigated forage legume and nutritious grasses are also included. Typical cropping patterns 
and household sizes are presented below in Table 10.14 
  Once representative VC households have been formulated the next step is to add the related 
investment costs and credit terms. For example, in the goat production model, goat housing 
and irrigation investment costs are included. Such costs maybe borne solely by an individual 
household or maybe that household’s share of a group investment outlay.  
  Finally, other fixed overheads are added to the farm model, an example of which would be 
annual irrigation or building maintenance. 
  Thus, the household models are constructed in a physical and financial sense. The related 
25.
cashflows form the basis of the investment appraisal at farm level. The following sections present the 
cropping patterns and the required investments for the respective household types. 
D. Value Chain Household Models – Cropping Pattern 
  The cropping pattern for each of the representative VC commodity households is shown in 
26.
Table 10.14. In each case the main VC commodity is shown together with the other typical crops 
grown. Areas are specified in ropani and hectares. In most cases expansion of the VC crop in the WP 
scenario is undertaken on maize areas. The total farm size does not change between WoP and WP.

The grant proportion of the investment amount is assumed 85 per cent for a group related activity 
(e.g. irrigation) and 50 per cent for an individual investment activity (e.g. animal housing). The non-
grant portion of the investment is assumed to be borrowed.182. 
  Financing for loans less than NPR 100,000 is assumed through a local microfinance institution at

182 The procedure adopted to model this in Farmod is to: (a) set the borrowing terms in the Long Term Credit Division; and (b) include the 
investment items under the Area/Family Household Model / Investment Cost Division. In this instance the total household contribution has been 
entered for each item under the Investment Cost Division while the Percent financed parameter in the Long Term Credit Division for both the one 
and two year loan types have been set to 50%. This forces the model to finance the remaining 50% from household resources.

Supplementary Financial Analysis – Ginger Value Chain Case Study 
  The analysis presented above follows the conventional approach to agricultural investment 
31.
appraisals. Given the development objective of the project is to contribute to the achievement of 
Nepal’s SDG 8 target through sustainable improvement in the income and food security of 
smallholders and disadvantaged rural groups184 involved in commercially-oriented production and 
marketing systems in selected high value agricultural value chains, it is appropriate to examine the 
financial viability from the producers’ perspective. A financial analysis can also be undertaken “along” 
individual value chain commodities to identify the value added. 
  In simple terms a value chain can be broken down into individual agents that create value added 
32.
through a production process. Figure 10.1 represents a productive agent as a box into which inputs 
flow and out of which comes a product or an output. Implicit in the notion of a “flow” is a period of time 
(in this context often referred to as the accounting period) which is usually taken to be a year. This 
allows us to divide the inputs of the production process into two groups: 
 
 
factors of production which are totally transformed or consumed during the accounting period, 
intermediate inputs; 
factors of production which are only partially used during the accounting period, where they 
provide inputs to the production process over a number of years before being fully depleted, 
investments goods. 
Figure 10.1 - Productive Agent 
Source: FAO (2005) Commodity Chain Analysis Financial Analysis EASYPol Module 44 
33.
  If II is the value of intermediate inputs used and Y is the value of the output, then the difference, 
Y-II, represents the value which the agent has added during the accounting period to the value of the 
inputs in the process of production or processing. Value added (VA) is defined by the equation: 
VA = Y - II 
  The new wealth created by a productive activity is not, therefore, measured by the gross value Y 
34.
of the product, but by the value Y reduced by the wealth which had to be consumed in the production 
process. Value added measures the creation of wealth, the contribution of the production process to 
the growth of the economy. The tool to analysis the value added by a productive agent is a production 
and trading account that defines and combined both these functions185.    The remainder of this 
section applies this approach to the proposed ASDP ginger value chain. The approach illustrates how 
the production and trading accounts are composed and ultimately consolidated into an estimate of the 
VA. 
  The value along the chain is sum of the individual agents’ value added. The table above 
35.
concludes that the value added by the agents identified in Table 10.17 is NPR 27,000 per tonne of 
ginger. The farm modelling undertaken for the financial analysis described earlier estimates that at full 
development the ginger VC households will be producing an incremental 9,240 tonnes of ginger per 
annum. The value added in the proposed ginger chain is estimated as NPR 246 million or 
USD 2.5 million per annum.

Notes: 
\1 Generally 1 tonne ginger produced from 1 ropani of land. Seed rhizome requirement for 1 ropani is 200 kg. Price is NPR 50 
per kg. 
\2 10-person days are required per ropani. Rate is NPR 500 per day. 
\3 Transportation cost to collection point is NPR 2 per kg. 
\4 Revenue 1 ha NPR 400,000, yield 1 ha 16 tonnes therefore revenue from the sale of 1 tonne = 400/16 or 25 NPR’000. 
\5 The sales of the producer are the input costs of the trader etc.

Appendix 10:  Financial and economic analysis 
A.  Objectives and Methodology 
ECONOMIC ANALYSIS 
  The objective of the economic analysis is to evaluate the expected contribution of the proposed 
36.
project to the economic development of the project districts and economy at large. The purpose of 
such analysis is to determine whether the economic benefits sufficiently justify the use of the project 
resources. The analysis includes all incremental costs and incremental benefits that are quantifiable 
and associated with proposed ASDP investments. Non-quantified benefits are also described. 
  Target population and participation. The Programme would be implemented in Surkhet, 
37.
Dailekh, Salyan, Jajarkot, Kalikot, Jumla, Mugu, Dolpa, Humla and (western) Rukum districts in 
State 6 of Nepal. The later four districts are incremental to the HVAP area and would be integrated 
into the Programme in line with the development of road corridors186 and the Mid-hills highway. The 
programme would commence immediately in the six existing HVAP districts and in Mugu and Rukum, 
with Dolpa and Humla being integrated in to the Programme as road access improves. 
  The programme would target smallholder producers and landless rural people interested to 
38.
engage in targeted value chain activities. It is expected that the ASDP would serve around 35,000 
direct beneficiaries (producers households and agri-industry entrepreneurs and employees) and 
around 40,000 indirect household beneficiaries (through public infrastructure, financial services and 
agricultural extension development). For the purposes of this analysis the 35,000 direct beneficiaries 
are assumed to be producer households. The breakdown for this target group by value chain and 
district is presented below. 
  Approach. The valuation of the incremental production at household level forms the basis of the 
39.
benefit valuation analytical framework. Individual crop production and livestock enterprise models 
representing the likely value chain commodities are established together with the typical household 
staple crops. In the manner described in the financial analysis, crop and livestock enterprise models 
are combined to estimate incremental household production and cashflow. These representative 
households are then aggregated to establish a project level value of incremental production. This is 
then combined with incremental project costs to derive the key appraisal indicators187.

187 The Subproject Division in Farmod is used to phase in the representative models through the Farm Distributions function.  
188 The analysis employs the function available in both Costab and Farmod to generate economic costs and benefits respectively.

Appendix 10:  Financial and economic analysis 
  Quantified Benefits – Incremental Production. The quantified benefits assume a phased 
41.
introduction of the beneficiary households. The assumed uptake in incremental and cumulative terms 
across the value chain types is shown in Table 10.19. The adoption rate assumed is 75%. This is 
justified due to the experiences of the HVAP and the common districts that the ASDP will share. Given 
this adoption rate the expected number of direct beneficiaries is reduced from the target of 35,000 to 
around 26,380. This reduction allows for both non-adoption and drop out over time. The composition 
of the household VC models is described above in the financial analysis. The project incremental 
benefits are derived through the aggregation of the individual household models phased into the 
analysis according to the distributions shown in Table 10.18. 
   The entry of each household into the project is represented in the cashflow by the incremental 
42.
net benefit stream of the related household model. 
  Note on Unquantified Benefits. Unquantified benefits are expected to be realised for around 
43.
40,000 households through the establishment and/or improvement to public infrastructure189 as well 
as the development of financial190 and agricultural extension services191.  
  Benefits from rural roads are foreseen to include: (i) changed patterns of production/increased 
44.
areas; (ii) increased agricultural productivity; (iii) increased marketed output; (iv) increased producer 
prices; (v) reduced losses (on-farm before transport and during transport); (vi) Increased profits for 
vehicle operators; and (vii) social benefits through increased access to health and other social 
services, and information (refer to Annex 3 Table 1 for further details).  
  A cost benefit analysis of a typical scenario foreseen in the ASDP has been developed (refer to 
45.
Annex 3 Table 2) to support the justification for rural roads. The model illustrates the costs and 
benefits of the construction of a gravel road 3 kilometers in length, connecting 2 villages to a district 
road. The costs are based on a rate of USD 100,000 per kilometer and an annual maintenance cost 
estimated at 2.5 per cent of the investment costs. Benefits are derived from the incremental quality 
and marketed volumes of ginger, off-season vegetables, potatoes and goat meat. These benefits are 
justified due to: (a) increased availability and reduced cost of inputs; (b) increased access to support 
services, including extension; (c) reduced transport time and accessibility throughout the year; (d) 
better yearlong access to markets due to improved accessibility; (e) reduced transport costs and 
losses during transport. The results of the analysis indicate the NPV > 0 at NPR 200 million and IRR > 
discount rate at 66 per cent. The conclusion from this analysis is that inclusion of rural road in the 
programme would likely lead to substantial incremental net benefits and is therefore a robust 
investment. 
46.
  Increment economic costs. The costs are based on the full ASDP project costing with the 
elimination of the value of the beneficiaries’ contributions192. Other costs have been adjusted to 
economic terms and taxes, duties and price contingencies removed. Allowances have been made for 
the following ongoing recurrent expenditures: (i) participatory planning and capacity building at 
CAESCs (ward level)193; (ii) capacity building AFECs (municipal level)194; and, (iii) ongoing 
maintenance of public infrastructure195. 
189 Outcome 2: Market-oriented community infrastructure - Output 2.1: Co-financed community market infrastructure 
190 Outcome 3: Rural financial services fund value chain development 
191 Outcome 4: Agriculture services sustainably support innovation and value chain development – Output 4.1 Participatory and pluralistic 
extension service development 
192 The value of the investments included in the household modelling are deducted from the project cost to avoid double counting. 
193 400 CAESC @ USD 250 every third year 
194 60 AFEC @ USD 500 every third year

C.  Project economic viability 
   Three indicators have been used to assess the overall performance of the project. These are 
47.
(i) the economic internal rate of return (EIRR); (ii) the economic net present value (ENPV) and the 
benefit cost ratio (BCR). These were estimated using cash flow of the incremental benefit and cost 
streams as outlined above. A summary of the discount economic cash flow is provided in Annex 3 
Table 3. The overall ASDP project EIRR is 24.1 per cent. The estimated ENPV at a 10 per cent 
discount rate is NPR 9,752 million (USD 95.61 million). The BCR of 1.57 indicating a return of 
approximately 1.6 dollars for every dollar invested. These results indicate that the project investments 
yield a positive rate of return as the EIRR > the hurdle rate (10 per cent) and the ENPV > zero196. 
  These returns described above are further supported by the additional non-quantified benefits

investment in the project is therefore viable from an economic perspective. 
  The main identified risks that may affect the economic outcome of the Project area are shown in 
49.
Table 10.19. A sensitivity analysis has been conducted to assess the potential impact of these risks 
resulting: in (a) reduced benefits; (b) increased costs; and/or (c) delayed benefits (see Table 10.20).

   An increase in programme costs by 10 per cent will reduce the EIRR to 21.1 per cent, while a 
50.
decrease in overall programme benefits by 20 per cent will result in an EIRR of 17.2 per cent. A one-
year delay in benefits reduces the EIRR to 18.7 per cent and a two-year delay to 15.3 per cent. A 
combination of a reduction in benefits of 20 per cent and an increase in costs by 20 per cent reduces 
the EIRR to 11.2 per cent indicating the investment is remains viable in the face of adverse 
circumstances. The switching values show that the programme will remain economically viable if 
benefits decreased by 36 per cent, or programme costs increased by 57 per cent. Table 10.20 below 
provides an overview of the various scenarios of the sensitivity analysis and indicates the economic 
viability of the Project. Based on these results it is fair to conclude that the investment is justified.

detailed Programme Implementation Manual. However, additional inputs are required concerning day-
to-day ASDP financial management. The HVAP PCO will coordinate the preparation of the Final 
Design Report. 
The mission, with HVAP PMU support, has prepared an “ASDP Stakeholder Compendium” to

IFAD’s Climate 
Change Strategy 
The ASDP is strongly aligned with IFAD overarching goal " rural people 
overcome poverty and achieve food security through remunerative, sustainable 
and resilient livelihoods." The program takes into account key IFAD policies and 
strategies relating to targeting, gender, land, ethnic peoples and climate change 
contributing to the overall objectives of the Strategic Framework 2015-2025 and 
in particular to: SO1: Increase rural people’s productive capacities; SO2: 
Increase rural people’s benefits from market participation; and SO3: Strengthen 
the environmental sustainability and climate resilience of rural people’s economic 
activities. Key policy orientation includes natural resources – land, water, energy 
and biodiversity; CC adaptation and mitigation; improved agricultural 
technologies and effective production services; integration of poor rural people 
within value chains; and technical skills development. 
The Country Strategic Opportunities Programme (COSOP), which is aligned with 
the policies and strategies of the GoN, has three main objectives: (i) Increased 
access to Economic Opportunities by poor farmers and producers in hill and 
mountain areas; (ii) Community infrastructure and services improved in hill and 
mountain areas; and; (iii) Gender, ethnic, and  caste-related disparities reduced 
through greater inclusion of disadvantaged groups to development.. The nature 
of the proposed primary target group will be poor rural households, composed 
mainly of subsistence farmers, wage laborers, landless people and market-
participant smallholder producers. The target group will also include “near poor” 
households, which are an income group increasingly vulnerable to shocks, 
especially those associated with climate risk. This group will include the under-
privileged “minority” people. Finally, specific provisions will be made to ensure 
the full participation of women and youth. All of these target group characteristics 
are consistent with IFAD policy. The ASDP funding builds on the HVAP and the 
ADS.  
ASDP supports the primary and secondary objective of this policy by promoting 
sustainable agriculture and livestock production systems resilient to climate 
change. The Programme adheres to the following policy principles: (i) increased 
investment in approaches providing multiple benefits for sustainable 
intensification of agriculture: improved water management / resilient 
infrastructure; (ii) strengthening the governance of natural assets to the rural 
poor through community empowerment; (iii) equality and empowerment of 
women and minority peoples in the context of natural resource management and 
family nutrition; and (iv) Improving access of poor rural communities to financing 
for income generating and climate-proofing of investments. 
ASDP intends to invest in the development of the following key value chains: off 
season vegetables (including potato), rhizome crops (ginger and turmeric), fruits 
(apple, walnut), small livestock (goat) and NTFP. The programme will comply 
with the Value Chain Best-practice statement provided in IFAD’s ENRM Policy 
(IFAD, 2011). Consistent with the goals, purpose and core principles of the 
ENRM Policy, the proposed Programme target groups are largely poor, women-
headed and minority households and communities in the uplands of mid-western 
Nepal and sets out to address CC adaptation, sustainable land management and 
poverty reduction in an integrated fashion.  The target group is disproportionately

Policy 
Strategic Objectives 
poor and highly dependent on staple crops, traditional agriculture and the natural 
resource base (e.g., NTFPs). Living in more remote areas, they have reduced 
access to markets and supporting services and so have low rates of agricultural 
investment and, in consequence, lower productivity. They are also identified as 
being highly sensitive to both CC and natural disaster impacts for all these same 
reasons. In response, the programme supports actions for long-term adaptation 
that address the drivers of vulnerability — such as adaptation options that reduce 
poverty and increase household resilience — and that integrate CC into 
development planning and public and private (VC and enterprise) investment. 
ASDP will systematically address issues of gender equality and women's 
empowerment. It will help women and their organizations in their advocacy for 
access to resources and knowledge. It will strengthen the capacity of 
Programme partners (national, local and decentralized institutions, training 
centers, private sector providers and national and international NGOs) to take 
into account issues of gender equality and community empowerment. This is 
particularly considered a difficult group to reach and therefore will be subject to 
special attention. 
The Programme approach to the minority groups (Dalit, Janajatis, Muslim, etc.) 
is consistent with IFAD’s policy to ethnic minorities. Cultural differences will 
dictate the approach adopted, as well as different poverty levels. Local 
languages will be used in all village meeting, planning and extension sessions. 
Mobile teams responsible for implementation will reflect gender balance, and 
their members will have command of local languages. Capacity building tools will 
be developed in the languages of the main minority groups and take into 
consideration cultural differences. Special efforts will be made to recruit 
facilitators and LRPs speaking local languages.  
The ASDP is aligned with the Knowledge Management strategy, especially in the 
following areas (i) strengthening the process of knowledge sharing and learning; 
(ii) development of partnerships to provide a broader base of knowledge sharing 
and learning: and (iii) promotion of a dynamic platform for knowledge sharing 
and learning. The Programme will use (human and financial) resources to 
enhance its impact by sharing knowledge and learning.
