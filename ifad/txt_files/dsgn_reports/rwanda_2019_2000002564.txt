I.  Executive Summary 
A. 
National context  
1.  Since  the  turn  of  the  century,  Rwanda  has  seen  its  economy  grow  by  7.9%/p.a.  According  to 
the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)'s  analysis,  the  medium-term  macroeconomic  outlook 
remains  favourable  and  Gross  Domestic  Product  (GDP)  growth  is  expected  to  remain  strong. 
Rwanda's debt is assessed to be sustainable, with a continued low risk  of debt distress.  Since 
1994, Rwanda has had a stable enabling policy environment that ensured successful delivery of 
development  programmes.  Despite  strong  economic  growth,  the  country  still  depends  on 
Overseas  Development  Assistance  (ODA)  for  16%  of  its  budget.  The  poverty  rate  has  not 
declined during the last three years, remaining a key challenge especially in rural areas: today, 
poverty is estimated at 43.1% in rural areas, and extreme poverty at 18.1%. 
2.  The Rwandan economy is still dependent on the agricultural sector, which contributes to 32.7% 
of  the  GDP.  Rwandan  agriculture  is  characterized  by  small  production  units  (the  average 
landholding  size  is  0.33  ha),  reflecting  the  high  population  pressure  on  the  natural  resource 
base. Rwanda’s agricultural land is fragile due to its hilly topography, thin soil layers and limited 
vegetative  cover.  Staple  food  production  remains  below  domestic  consumption  and  the  gap  is 
filled by importation.  
3.  The  direct  and  indirect  contribution  of  livestock  to  GDP  in  2016/17  was  estimated  at  4.6%  of 
national  GDP  and  14%  of  agricultural  GDP.  Due  to  agro-ecological  conditions  conducive  to 
intensification,  the  livestock  sector  provides  major  opportunities  to  further  increase  its 
contribution  to  the  economy.  With  a  rapidly  growing  population,  increasing  urbanization  and 
rising incomes, the demand for Animal Source Food (ASF) is expected to increase significantly 
for the foreseeable future. 
4.  Rwanda’s  long-term  development  goals  are  defined  in  its  Vision  2020  and  Vision  2050,  which 
aim to transform the country from a low-income agriculture-based economy into a knowledge-
based,  service-oriented  economy,  with  middle-income  status.  Rwanda’s  Strategic  Plan  for  the 
Transformation of Agriculture (PSTA 4) is the Government's flagship investment programme for 
the sector for the period 2018-2024. PSTA 4 recognizes that agricultural growth must be driven 
by private sector investment and introduces improved nutrition amongst its priority areas. 
5.  The overarching strategic framework guiding the development of the livestock sector in Rwanda 
is  the  Rwanda  Livestock  Master  Plan  (LMP).  The  2017-2022  LMP  comprises  six  sub-sectorial 
master plans, which include dairy, red meat, chicken and pork. For small livestock specifically, a 
strategy  and  investment  plan  for  small  animal  industry  was  developed  in  2012,  but  has  now 
expired and would require a review and update. 
6.  Rwanda  has  adopted  international  and  regional  frameworks  on  women’s  rights,  making  great 
strides  in  promoting  gender  equality,  with  strong  Government  commitment.  The  2015  revised 
Constitution  enshrines  the  principles  of  gender  equality  and  women's  empowerment  (GEWE). 
According  to  the  latest  Agricultural  Households  Survey  (2017),  women  in  agricultural 
households represent 53% of the population. Overall, youth population makes up 26.6% of the 
total population of Rwanda. 
7.  Despite  marked  reductions  in  chronic  malnutrition,  stunting  remains  one  of  the  Rwanda’s 
greatest human and economic development  challenges. The stunting rate remains the highest 
in  the  Western  Province,  at  44%  (Northern  Province  39%  and  Southern  Province  36%)  and 
continues to be a major public health concern.

Rationale for IFAD involvement 
8.  IFAD's  comparative  advantage  for  small  livestock  sector  development.  It  is  to  be 
recalled  that  IFAD  has  extensive  experience  in  the  livestock  sector  in  Rwanda,  thanks  to  its 
support to the dairy sector1. Moreover, IFAD also has a comparative advantage in working with 
smallholder  and  livestock-related  institutions  as  well  as  being  a  knowledge  broker,  by  using 
models, as well as experiences and lessons from across all regions for pro-poor small livestock 
development. 
9.  IFAD  as  a  trusted  partner.  The  Fund  remains  a  trusted  partner  for  the  Government  of 
Rwanda (GoR) having successfully provided its support to the dairy sector (RDDP) and  export 
value chains (PRICE). Against this backdrop, the GoR requested IFAD to support its strategy of 
modernizing  the  small livestock  value  chains.  In  doing  so,  this  will  allow  the  GoR  to  widen  its 
sectorial  coverage  in  livestock  and  balance  its  support  geographically  in  areas  (i.e.  West  and 
South),  which  receive  less  support  and  are  more  affected  by  poverty  and  malnutrition.  It  will 
also  allow  the  targeting  of  the  most  vulnerable  households,  for  which  small  livestock  is  an 
appropriate way out of poverty and can serve as a buffer to mitigate the impact of shocks, thus 
contributing  to  increase  their  resilience.  At  the  same  time,  small  ruminants  can  greatly 
contribute  to  generate  economic  opportunities  for  vulnerable  households  and  especially  for 
women.  Moreover,  in  a  context  where  child  undernutrition  remains  an  important  development 
challenge,  small  livestock  sector  can  contribute  to  play  an  important  role  in  combatting 
malnutrition.   
10. Market  demand  opportunities.  Between  2000  and  20172,  the  domestic  consumption  per 
capita for small livestock products has grown by 688% for poultry meat, 79% for pig meat, and 
111% for small ruminants' meat. This growing market demand thus provides an opportunity for 
rural  livelihood  transformation.  Moreover,  Rwanda's  low  urbanization  level  is  compensated  by 
the  presence,  at  its  doorstep,  of  two  significant  urban  centers  in  the  Democratic  Republic  of 
Congo  (DRC):  Goma  (1.2M  people)  and  Bukavu  (0.9M  people).  The  value  of  small  stock, 
exported to DRC, increased by 27% between 2010 and 20153, and by 140% for pig only over 
the same period. This market is expected to keep growing in the near future. The productivity 
of small livestock in Rwanda could thus be substantially increased to respond to this increasing 
market demand, especially for the traditional systems (extensive small ruminants, backyard pig 
and  chicken).  Specifically,  productivity  could  be  significantly  reduced  by  simple  animal  health 
measures  and  through  genetic  improvement,  although  crossbreeding  should  be  handled  with 
care in order not to affect resistance to diseases and feed scarcity. The other option to respond 
to the increasing market demand would be to establish new production units.  Due to the land 
constraint, farmers cannot easily extend their cultivation area; thus, creating a small poultry or 
a pig unit could be a solution for smallholder farmers to expand their activity, without additional 
land requirement.  
C. 
Lessons Learned  
11. Need to address sanitary risks. The experience of IFAD-funded small livestock development 
projects is that all efforts dedicated to building up a livestock value chain could be constrained 
in  case  of  an  outbreak  of  major  animal  diseases.  The  integration  of  contingency  response 
measures in the programme design could thus contribute to significantly reducing this risk.

12. Approach  to  small  ruminants’  value  chain.  In  Rwanda,  a  significant  proportion  of  the 
households, which were provided with start-up packages including small livestock were not able 
to keep them on the long run and had to sell them when confronted with crisis. With this target 
population,  when  placement  of  animals  is  envisaged,  it  is  important  to  properly  prepare  the 
community before handing over the animals. 
13. Access to finance. One  key lesson  from  IFAD-funded projects in Rwanda is that there is too 
much focus on the management of matching grants, without proper analysis of their rationale. 
This  results  in  low-efficient  use  of  public  resources  and  risk  of  crowding  out  of  the  financial 
sector.  More  needs  to  be  done  to  promote  a  permanent  and  sustainable  access  to  adequate 
financial services. 
14. PRISM  will  strongly  benefit  from  the  experience  and  lessons  learned  with  the  Rwanda  Dairy 
Development  Project  (RDDP),  which  have  informed  the  programme  design,  especially  with 
regard  to  the:  (i)  relevance  of  building  the  capacity  of  both  public  and  private  veterinary 
services at central and district levels; (ii) importance of Field Farmers Schools as an instrument 
to  improve fodder cultivation for dairy cattle and small ruminant producers; (v) need to work 
on both the demand and supply of adequate financial service providers, building trust between  
beneficiaries  and  financial  institutions;  (vi)  importance  of  proactively  supporting  institutional 
reforms,  by  providing  technical  expertise  and  facilitating  inclusive  policy  dialogue  (using  both 
national-and district-level platforms).

Programme description 
15. Partnership  with  ENABEL.  PRISM  is  a  partnership  programme  implemented  by  the  Rwanda 
Agriculture  and  Animal  Resources  Development  Board  (RAB),  and  jointly  funded  by  IFAD  and 
ENABEL, with Heifer International and VSF Belgium as key implementing partners.  
16. Programme  objectives.  The  overall  objective  of  the  programme  is  to  reduce  poverty  by 
empowering  poor  rural  men,  women  and  youth  to  participate  in  the  transformation  of  the 
Rwanda  livestock  sector  and  to  enhance  their  resilience.  The  Programme  Development 
Objective (PDO) is to improve food and nutrition security and incomes of poor rural households 
through better performance of the value chains.  
17. Duration and geographic area. The programme will have a total duration of 5 years. It will 
target a total of 15 districts, distributed across the northern, southern and western provinces of 
Rwanda.  The  selection  of  these  districts  and  their  respective  sectors  will  be  based  on  the 
incidence  of  poverty  and  food  insecurity  as  well  as  the  comparative  advantage  for  the 
development of the targeted small livestock value chains. 
18. Targeting  mechanisms.  Based  on  the  national  wealth  ranking  system  (Ubudehe)4,  and 
consistent  with  the  targeting  strategy,  outlined  in  the  Country  Strategic  Opportunities 
Programme  (COSOP),  PRISM  will  directly  target  26,355  poor  rural  households,  belonging  to 
Ubudehe  categories  1,  2  and  3.  The  programme’s  beneficiaries  will  be  targeted  through 
complementary approaches intended to support their participation in commercial and inclusive 
value  chains,  as  follows:  (a)  with  23,400  poor  and  food  insecure  rural  households  (Ubudehe 
categories  1  and  2),  the  programme  will  deploy  a  pro-poor  graduation  pathway,  tailoring  the 
services  provided  to  the  socio-economic  conditions  and  specific  households’  needs;  (b)  1,530 
rural youth (Ubudehe categories 1, 2, 3) will receive support to organize themselves into small 
livestock  production  cooperatives,  and  (c)  1,425  market-oriented  producers  (mostly  from 
4 Currently, there are 4 Ubudehe categories, with the first category designated for the poorest and food insecure people, the 
second one for poor/vulnerable people, the third one for more resilient households while the fourth category includes the 
wealthiest members of society (like large business owners). PRIMS will not address households in Category 4.

PRISM 
Project Design Report (PDR) 
Ubudehe  categories  2  and  3)  will  be  supported  through  a  combination  of  technical,  business 
and financial capacity building5. PRISM will adopt an inclusive approach to ensure that women 
and  men  benefit  equally  from  programme  interventions.  Indeed,  50%  of  the  targeted 
beneficiaries  will  be  women  and  30%  will  be  youth.  Furthermore,  ENABEL's  intervention  will 
focus    on  supporting  already  established  smallholder  commercial  farmers  and  private  firms 
(suppliers and processors) and will target an additional 21,254 beneficiaries. The IFAD-ENABEL 
partnership will allow to target and support different actors in the small livestock value chains, 
with inclusive  tailored  strategies,  leveraging  the  comparative  advantages  of  the  two  agencies. 
IFAD will concentrate its support to its core target group: the vulnerable rural producers, while 
ENABEL,  leveraging its  comparative  advantage,  will  engage  more  market  oriented  value  chain 
actors. This complementarity allows each partner to operate within its mandate and to leverage 
its  comparative  advantage,  jointly  contributing  to  a  healthy  and  sustainable  growth  of  the 
sector.  
Component 1 - Climate-smart intensification of small livestock production systems.   
19. Social mobilization and graduation of vulnerable households: Through this intervention, 
which will be implemented by Heifer International, the  programme will reach 23,400 poor and 
food insecure rural households (Ubudehe 1 and 2) for whom the programme will adopt a pro-
poor approach, using a graduation pathway (VBHCD6 model), aimed at addressing community 
development,  through  an  integrated  and  holistic  approach.  This  model  builds  on  12 
Cornerstones©  aimed  at  strengthening  the  capacity  of  smallholder  farmers  (including  financial 
literacy,  nutrition  education,  business  management  and  increase  gender  equity)  to  increase 
their  production  and  productivity,  while  connecting  them  to  markets.  Heifer  International  will 
capitalize  on  its  existing  experience  and  expertise  in  Rwanda,  the  African  region  and  globally, 
including within IFAD-financed projects. In parallel, the Farmer Field School (FFS) approach will 
be  implemented  by  ENABEL  for  12,000  households,  which  are  the  most  market  oriented,  and 
will be complementary to the VBHCD approach. 
20. Improve animal health status and genetic potential of small  livestock: In communities 
benefitting 
from  the  graduation  pathway  (Subcomponent  1.1),  Community  Agro-Vet 
Entrepreneurs  (CAVEs)  will  be  identified,  trained  and  deployed  to  support  animal  wellbeing 
across  all  value  chains,  and  community  animal  health  funds  will  be  established  to  manage 
health  risk.  In  the  domain  of  genetics,  the  programme  will  provide  support  to  Rwanda 
Agriculture Board (RAB) and private actors to import, multiply and disseminate improved stock. 
In  the  animal  health  domain,  the  programme  will  also  strengthen  the  epidemio-surveillance 
capacities of veterinary services, with a particular focus on small livestock TADs. PRISM will also 
strengthen preparedness to sanitary crisis by supporting the development of contingency plans, 
the  organization  of  simulation  exercises,  and  the  establishment  of  a  disease  contingency  fund 
for major outbreaks of TADs.  
21. Support  climate  smart  innovations  in  production:  In  order  to  mitigate  potential  negative 
impact  of  small  livestock  production  intensification,  the  programme  will  promote  several 
activities  for  mainstreaming  environmental  management  and  climate  change  adaptation  and 
mitigation,  including:  (i)  enhanced  feed  efficiency  through  the  promotion  of  fodder  trees  and 
shrub  species  (agroforestry)  and  use  of  crop  residues  at  farm  level;  (ii)  manure  management 
through  adoption  of  biogas  systems  and  composting;  and  (iii)  improved  water  efficiency 
through rainwater harvesting facilities installed at farm level.

Component 2: Support to Small Livestock Value Chain Development 
22. Support to animal feed industry: This set of activities will be led and funded by ENABEL and 
will aim at supporting the emergence of a national feed industry, based in as much as possible 
on  quality  locally  produced  raw  materials  (maize  and  soya),  in  order  the  reduce  the  country's 
dependency on imports. The programme will develop a profitable, resilient and sustainable soya 
and  maize  farms  network  connected  to  feed  companies  through  the  out-grower  company 
model.  
23. Productive  Alliances  with  input  suppliers  and  market  facilitation  in  small  livestock 
value chains: Productive alliances will be sought in the poultry and pig value chains, building 
on arrangements that are already used by Rwandan animal feed manufacturers to expand their 
customer  outreach.  The  beneficiaries  of  these  productive  alliances  will  typically  belong  to 
Ubudehe  categories  2  and  3  i.e.  beneficiaries  who  are  already  engaged  in  an  entrepreneurial 
logic.  Poor  smallholder  farmers  (Ubudehe  category  1),  supported  under  Component  1,  who 
manage  to  'graduate'  to  a  higher  level  and  produce  a  surplus,  will  also  be  engaged.    Market 
facilitation in small livestock value chains will be done at two levels: (i) assistance to off-takers 
for  supplier  network  development;  (ii)  support  to  public  good  related  investments  in  essential 
equipment. 
24. Support  to  youth  entrepreneurship  in  production:  The  programme  will  target  1,530 
unemployed rural youth, who are interested to start small livestock production enterprises, by 
assisting them to establish viable and profitable production  units and linking them to markets 
as well as services through productive alliance arrangements. PRISM will support groups of 10 
youth,  on  average.  The  support  package  will  include  initial  intensive  technical  and  business 
management  support,  continuous  tutoring  through  business  coaches,  provision  of  start-up 
capital for investment and working capital, and linkages to financial service providers.  
25. Support  to  Financial  Institutions  (FIs):  The  programme  will  facilitate  linkage  of  the 
smallholder farmers, under productive alliance with the financial sector, to finance investments 
and  working  capital.  It  will  also  contribute  to  linking  vulnerable  households  under  the 
graduation  pathway  in  Component  1  to  access  formal  financial  services,  and  to  linking  youth 
(also  supported  under  Component  1)  as  well  as  private  investors  to  financial  institutions  for 
start-up business development financing.  
Component 3: Policy support and coordination 
26. Policy  and  regulatory  support:  For  the  targeted  value  chains,  the  programme  will  support 
the  review  and  formulation  of  new  sector  strategies  and  policies  and  the  updating  or 
formulation  and  enforcement  of  food  safety  and  animal  welfare  regulatory  frameworks.  The 
programme will also provide capacity building support to RAB to improve skills of selected key 
national staff on technical domains related to small livestock. 
27. Support  national  producers  organizations  and  multi-stakeholder  fora:  The  programme 
will  provide  institutional  support  to  existing  or  emerging  national  farmers  organizations  within 
the  targeted  small  livestock  value  chain,  to  enable  them  to  increase  their  capacity,  visibility, 
and  their  outreach.  Small  livestock  multi-stakeholder  fora  will  be  established  at  regional  and 
national  level  to  facilitate  negotiations  between  value  chain  actors,  as  well  as  participation  of 
value chain actors in policy dialogue. 
E. 
Costs and financing 
28. The  total  PRISM  investment  and  incremental  recurrent  costs,  including  physical  and  price 
contingencies,  are  estimated  at  USD  45.64  million  (RWF  41.07  billion).  The  table  below 
presents the breakdown of the costs by components. The investment in Component 1 (Climate-
smart  intensification  of  small  production  systems)  in  base  costs  stands  at  USD  20.65  million 
xiii 
Partnership for Resilient and Inclusive Small Livestock Markets 
PRISM 
Project Design Report (PDR) 
(42% of total base costs); Component 2 (Support to small livestock value chain development) 
in base costs totals USD 19.40 million (29% of total base costs) and Component 3 (Policy and 
regulatory support and Coordination) in base costs amounts to USD 5.59 million (11% of base 
costs), of which Project Coordination accounts for USD 2.79 million (6.1% of total base costs). 
In  addition  to  the  total  base  costs  of  USD  45.38  million,  price  and  physical  contingencies 
amounting  to  USD  0.26  million  have  been  provided  for.  The  input  currency  in  cost  tables  was 
set as USD minimizing the effect of local inflation. 
29. PRISM will be financed  by: (i) the GoR with USD 3.31 million (about 7.3% of total costs), (ii) 
Districts  with  USD  0.66  million  (about  1.4%  of  total  costs),  (iii)  IFAD  with  USD  14.90  million 
(about  32.7%  of  total  costs,  under  the  current  PBAS-IFAD11),  (iv)  ENABEL  with  USD  17.4 
million  (about  38.2%  of  total  costs),  (v)  Banks  with  USD  1.29  million  (about  2.8%  of  total 
costs),  (vi)  Heifer  International  with  USD  4.68  million  (about  10.2%  of  total  costs),  (vii) 
Beneficiaries  with  USD  2.38  million  (about  5.2%  of  total  costs),  and  (viii)  private  sector  with 
USD 0.99 million (about 2.2% of total costs). 
F. 
Summary of economic and financial analysis 
30. Ten  enterprise models  have been used to estimate the increase in incomes at household level 
as  a  result  of  proposed  programme  investment.  The  overall  Economic  Internal  Rate  of  Return 
(EIRR) of the Programme is estimated at 26% (base case) which is above the opportunity cost 
of  capital  in  Rwanda  estimated  at  9.5%,  indicating  the  economic  convenience  of  the 
Programme.  A  sensitivity  analysis  was  carried  out,  which  indicates  a  strong  resilience  to 
increases in costs and reductions of benefits, which mirror the PRISM risk profile.

Exit strategy, risks, environmental category 
31. Exit  Strategy  and  Sustainability.  The  sustainability  of  programme  outcomes  relies  on  its 
overall  approach,  which  is  based  in  particular  on  the  facilitation  of  partnerships,  social 
mobilization  and  group  formation,  transfer  of  capacity,  institutional  strengthening  and  durable 
market-based financing. 
32. Risks. The overall risk profile is low to medium. The most important risks in terms of potential 
impact  for  the  programme  are:  (i)  a  possible  closure  of  export  markets,  or  source  of  raw 
material for feed, due to a geopolitical event or diplomatic crisis; (ii) a sanitary crisis due to the 
emergence  or  introduction  of  a  contagious  and  deadly  animal  disease  affecting  the  small 
livestock species. Tailored mitigation measures have been introduced in the programme design 
(see page 39 and  Annex IX). 
33. Environment  and  Social  category  and  Climate  Risk  classification.  The  programme  is 
considered  to  be  an  Environment  and  Social  category  B.  The  programme  is  not  expected  to 
have significant adverse environmental or social implications. The programme is expected to be 
moderately  sensitive  to  climate  risks.  In  order  to  mitigate  potential  negative  impact  of  small 
livestock  production  intensification,  the  programme  will  promote  several  activities  for 
mainstreaming  environmental  management  and  climate  change  adaptation  and  mitigation, 
including: (i) enhanced feed efficiency through the promotion of fodder trees and shrub species 
(agroforestry)  and  use  of  crop  residues  at  farm  level;  (ii)  manure  management  through

H. 
Implementation 
34. The  programme  will  be  implemented  through  the  Single  Project  Implementation  Unit  (SPIU), 
under  RAB.  The  IFAD  and  ENABEL  supported  interventions  will  be  managed  by  a  single 
programme  management  team,  co-financed  by  both  partners,  and  placed  under  the  aegis  of 
the  SPIU  coordinator.  In  line  with  the  practice  of  other  IFAD-funded  projects  in  Rwanda,  a 
Project  Steering  Committee  (PSC),  covering  both  ENABEL  and  IFAD  supported  interventions, 
will be established.  
35. The  programme  will  create  partnerships  with  decentralized  entities  in  order  to  cover  activities 
that are under the direct coordination of Districts. The programme will provide logistical support 
to  the  Districts  to  enable  them  to  fulfil  these  tasks.  Same  partnerships  will  be  created  with 
relevant  Government  of  Rwanda’s  specialized  technical  agencies.  The  programme  will  also  be 
engaged into a specific partnership with Heifer International who will be a co-financier but also 
a  key  implementing  partner  (will  be  responsible  for  the  implementation  of  SC  1.1,  and  will 
contribute  to  its  financing).  Heifer  International  will  be  responsible  for  the  implementation  of 
the graduation pathway for vulnerable households under SC1.1. 
36. Procurement arrangements. The overall responsibility will be under RAB, but the function of 
procurement will be delegated to the SPIU. It is to be noted that the internal tender committee 
is already in place at SPIU.  
37. Financial Management (FM) arrangements. A FM assessment of PRISM was carried out in 
accordance  with  IFAD’s  rules.  New  projects  within  the  SPIU  are  required  to  use  the  national 
financial  management  system,  which  does  not  entirely  facilitate  expenditure  classification  and 
will require adaptation of the system. 
38. Planning.  This  will  be  guided  by  the  programme’s  strategy,  logical  framework  and  broader 
results  framework  which  will  inform  the  development  of  annual  work.  A  single  results-based 
annual  work  plan  and  budget  (AWPB),  including  both  IFAD  and  ENABEL  supported 
interventions,  will  be  drawn-up  in  consultation  with  implementing  partners,  including 
beneficiaries. 
39. Monitoring  and  Evaluation  (M&E).  This  will  be  effectively  supported  by  a  Management 
Information  System  (MIS).  The  MIS  will  be  aligned  with  MINAGRI’s  new  MIS  and  with  IFAD’s 
new  Operational  Results  Management  System  (ORMS).  A  baseline,  mid-term  and  completion 
survey  will  be  conducted.  The  Minimum  Diversity  Diet  for  Women  (MDD-W)  will  be  integrated 
into the baseline and follow-up surveys. 
40. Knowledge  Management  (KM).  Systems  for  information  exchanges  will  be  developed  and 
used  on  a  regular  basis,  including  stakeholder  review  meetings,  planning  workshops,  and  a 
newsletter  to  be  shared  with  all  beneficiaries.  Relevant  information  from  the  programme  MIS 
will be used to document lessons learnt, best practices and success stories. In addition, the MIS 
will include a specific module on KM.

II.  Context 
A.  National context and rationale for IFAD involvement 
1.  National Economic Context  
41. Rwanda  is  a  small  landlocked  country,  with  a  population  of  about  12.5  million  people7  and  a 
total  land  area  of  26,338km2  of  which  52%  is  classified  as  arable  agricultural  land.  Since  the 
turn of the century, Rwanda has seen its economy grow by 7.9% per year. In the same period 
(2000-2016), GDP per capita increased from USD 242 to USD 7748. According to International 
Monetary  Fund's  (IMF),  the  medium-term  macroeconomic  outlook  remains  favourable.  GDP 
growth  is  expected  to  remain  strong.  This  is  supported  by  continued  diversification  of  the 
export  base,  public  investment  spending  to  crowd-in  private  sector  investment,  and  more 
resilient  agriculture  as  a  result  of  extensive  irrigation  programmes.  Despite  strong  economic 
growth,  the  country  still  depends  on  Overseas  Development  Assistance  (ODA)  for  16%  of  its 
budget.  Inflation  is  expected  to  remain  within  the  central  bank’s  target  of  5%.  The  Rwanda 
public and publically guaranteed debt has increased in recent years from 37.5% of GDP in 2015 
to 44.4 % in 2016, as per the IMF9. However, Rwanda's debt is expected to remain sustainable, 
with a continued low risk of debt distress10.  
42. Since  1994,  Rwanda  has  enjoyed  political  stability  and  an  enabling  policy  environment,  which 
ensured successful delivery of development programmes. Rwanda has a strong anti-corruption 
policy.  It  is  ranked  48th  out  of  180  countries  in  the  2018  Corruption  Perceptions  Index 
(Transparency  International)11.  Rwanda's  policies  and  institutions  continue  to  be  classified  as 
"strong"  under  the  World  Bank's  Country  Policy  Institutional  Assessment  (CPIA)  index  and  as 
being  robust  by  IFAD's  Rural  Sector  Performance  Assessment  (RSPA).  In  addition,  the  2018 
World Bank Doing Business Report ranked Rwanda 2nd in Africa and 29th globally.  
43. The Rwandan financial sector is characterized by a high level of financial inclusion (89% of the 
population  have  access  to  formal  and  informal  financial  services),  and  there  are  diversified 
players  in  the  market  (Banks,  Microfinance  Institutions,  Savings  and  Credit  Cooperatives, 
Informal  systems  like  Village  Savings  and  Loans  Associations).  Agriculture  remains  largely 
underfinanced, especially smallholder farmers, but there is a growing interest from the financial 
sector  to  venture  into  agricultural  finance.  Some  commercial  banks  and  MFIs  have  set  up 
specialized agricultural finance units. MFIs and banks engaged in agricultural lending confirmed 
they  have  existing  relationships  with  insurers  and,  where  suitable  products  exist,  they  opt  to 
bundle agricultural insurance with credit in order to lend to traditionally high-risk clients. Crop 
insurance and dairy cow insurance are already operational in Rwanda and are due to be scaled-
up under a National Agricultural Insurance Scheme from 2019.  
44. The Rwandan economy is still dependent on the agricultural sector, which employs around 70% 
of the population, provides 91% of the food consumed, accounts for 70% of export revenues, 
and  contributes  32.7%  of  the  GDP.  The  Rwandan  agriculture  is  characterized  by  small 
production units (average landholding size is 0.33 ha), reflecting the high population pressure 
on  the  country's  natural  resource  base.  Rwanda’s  agricultural  land  is  fragile  due  to  its  hilly 
topography, thin soil layers and limited vegetative cover. About 96% of rural households rely on 
agriculture  for  their  livelihoods  and  about  80%  of  the  rural  population  consists  of  subsistence

farmers who use mostly rainfed production systems. The main staple crops are maize, cassava 
and  beans.  Less  than  6%  of  all  cultivated  land  is  irrigated.  Land  remains  a  binding  constraint 
and  generally  calls  for  production  intensification  as  the  only  environmentally  sustainable 
pathway  for  continued  growth.  Since  2010,  significant  Government  of  Rwanda  (GoR) 
interventions  have  driven  productivity  gains,  including  the  Land-Use  Consolidation  Policy 
(LUCP), Crop Intensification Programme (CIP), large-scale anti-erosion measures, expansion of 
irrigation  schemes  and  more  productive  use  of  fertile  marshlands.  However,  staple  food 
production remains below domestic consumption and the gap is filled by importation. 
45. The  direct  and  indirect  contribution  of  livestock  to  GDP  in  2016/17  was  estimated  at  US$321 
million  (i.e.  4.6%  of  GDP  and  14%  of  agricultural  GDP12).  Due  to  agro-ecological  conditions, 
conducive to intensified livestock production, the livestock sector provides major opportunities 
to further increase its contribution to the economy. This potential has already been proven by 
the  GoR's  “One  cow  per  poor  family  program”,  which  has  transformed  the  dairy  industry.  The 
continuous  impressive  growth  in  livestock  production  over  the  last  decade  (11%  per  year  for 
milk, 4.5% for meat13) largely reflects significant productivity gains. In addition, with a rapidly 
growing  population,  as  well  as  an increasing  urbanization  and  rising incomes,  the  demand  for 
meat, milk and eggs is expected to increase significantly in the foreseeable future. 
2.  Socio-economic context of the targeted beneficiaries 
46. Rural  poverty  context.  Rwanda  is  ranked  158th  out  of  189  countries  in  the  2018  Human 
Development Index with an index of 0.52414. According to the Africa Sustainable Development 
Goals  (SDG)  Index,  Rwanda  ranks  120  out  of  156  countries  with  a  score  of  56.1  towards 
achievement of SDGs15 and with an average spillover score against GDP being 97.616. While the 
country has had an impressive record in translating its sustained growth into poverty reduction 
over the past decade, the poverty rate has not declined during the last three years17, remaining 
a key challenge especially in rural areas. The prevalence of poverty is associated mainly to low 
productivity  in  subsistence  agriculture  and  low  purchasing  power  of  households.  Poverty  is 
highest by far (76.6%) among households with little or no land. Rural women and young people 
are  more  likely  to  fall  into  this  category.  In  this  context,  small  livestock  production  can  offer 
economic opportunities especially to the poorest households.  
47. Food security. According to the 2018 Comprehensive Food Security and Vulnerability Analysis 
(CFSVA),  19%  of  households  in  Rwanda18  are  classified  as  food  insecure,  with  an  inadequate 
food consumption score, particularly before the harvest season. The Western Province has the 
highest  prevalence  of  food  insecure  households  (almost  30%),  followed  by  the  Southern 
Province (21%) and  the Northern Province (18%). Overall, in the three provinces, an  average

15 SDG1 End Poverty performance is considered to be moderately increasing; the same progression is found for SDG 2-Zero 
Hunger  and  SDG3-  Good  health  and  well-being.  Outperforming  the  others  is  SDG  5-  Gender  Equality  where  the  trend 
remains at or above SDG achievement.

17  Figures  from  EICV5  (2016/2017)  show  that  growth  in  GDP  did  not  translate  into  poverty  reduction  and  into  higher 
consumption  per  adult  equivalent.  Although  Rwanda  experienced  14%  growth  in  GDP  per  capita  between  2014  and 
2017(when  EICV4  was  published),  equivalent  to  4.5%  annually,  the  poverty  rate  only  fell  from  39.1%  to  38.2%.  In 
contrast,  the  experience  between  2011  and  2014,  was  that  real  GDP  per  capita  rose  and  the  poverty  rate  dropped  from 
44.9% to 39.1%. EICV5 relates this trend to a substantial rise in the price of foods (especially staple foods) and reduction 
of  purchasing  power of  most Rwandans.  Source:  National  Institute  of  Statistics  of  Rwanda  (NISR),  EICV5,  Poverty Profile 
Report 2016/2017.

of  49%  of  households  are  food  insecure.  Food  access  in  Rwanda  is  mainly  determined  by 
seasonal  patterns,  commodity  prices  and  people’s  purchasing  power.  A  large  share  of  the 
population remains dependent on rain-fed agriculture and consumption of home-produced food. 
Hence,  people’s  ability  to  adequately  feed  themselves  is  susceptible  to  periodic  droughts  and 
floods.  In  this  framework,  small  livestock  can  serve  as  a  buffer  to  mitigate  the  impact  of 
fluctuations in crop production. 
3.  Relevant national strategies, policies and programmes 
48. Rwanda’s  long-term  development  goals  are  defined  in  its  Vision  2020  and  Vision  2050,  which 
aim to transform the country from a low-income agriculture-based economy into a knowledge-
based,  service-oriented  economy  with  middle-income  status.  The  National  Strategy  for 
Transformation  (NST  1)  follows  the  Economic  Development  and  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  2 
(EDPRS 2). NST 1 integrates international commitments deriving from the United Nations (UN) 
Sustainable  Development  Goals  (SDG);  African  Union  (AU)  Agenda  2063;  East  African 
Community  (EAC)  Vision  2050  focusing  on  job  creation;  and  Conference  Of  Parties  (COP) 
agreements on climate change.  
49. The  National  Strategy  on  Climate  Change  and  Low-Carbon  Development  (NCCLCD)  underlines 
the need to manage climate variability for the social, environmental and economic development 
of  the  country.  The  Intended  Nationally  Determined  Contributions  (INDCs)  are  built  upon  the 
NCCLCD and aim at achieving Category 2 energy security as well as supports the development 
of  green  industry  and  services,  sustainable  land  and  water  management,  urban  development, 
biodiversity and ecosystem services. 
50. The overarching strategic framework guiding the development of the livestock sector in Rwanda 
is  the  Rwanda  Livestock  Master  Plan  (LMP).  It  covers  a  five-year  period  (2017-2022)  and 
comprises of six sub-sectorial master plans, including for dairy, red meat, chicken and pork. For 
small livestock specifically, a strategy and investment plan was developed in 2012, but has now 
expired and would require review and update. 
51. GoR  has  established  an  Agricultural  Sector  Working  Group  (ASWG),  in  which  GoR  and 
Development  Partners  (DPs),  including  IFAD,  discuss  sector  and  cross-sector  strategies, 
programmes and implementation progress.  
52. Other  development  initiatives  supporting  the  small  livestock  sector:  this  sector  has 
never  received  ample  support  from  development  partners  unlike  the  dairy  sector.  The  only 
significant project supporting the sector during these last decades has been the Belgium funded 
“Small Livestock Development Support”, implemented during 2008 and 2012 (EUR 5.5 M). Its 
focus  was  on  extensive  and  family  production  systems,  and  its  main  activity  was  assets' 
building,  through  distribution  of  animals.  Although  there  are  currently  no  significant  active 
project in small livestock, it is to be noted that in addition to PRISM, USAID/"Feed the Future" 
is  also  launching  a  project  called  "Orora  Wihaze"  which  aims  at  “sustainably  increasing  the 
availability  of,  access  to,  and  consumption  of  Animal-Source  Foods  (ASF),  through  the 
development of a profitable market”, and will operate mostly in Western Rwanda. 
4.  Special aspects relating to IFAD's corporate mainstreaming priorities  
53. Gender.  The  2015  revised  Constitution  enshrines  the  principles  of  gender  equality  and 
women's  rights  and  established  a  minimum  30%  quota  for  women  in  all  decision-making 
3 
Partnership for Resilient and Inclusive Small Livestock Markets 
PRISM 
Project Design Report (PDR) 
positions19. Despite these achievements, gender disparities and traditional patriarchal attitudes 
still  persist,  especially  in  rural  areas.  According  to  the  latest  Agricultural  Households  Survey 
(2017),  women  in  agricultural  households  represent  53%  of  the  population  in  the  three 
provinces  targeted  by  PRISM.  In  rural  areas,  women  concentrate  their  work  in  agriculture 
(almost 90%)20 and rely on agricultural activities as the only source of income. Yet, with lower 
levels  of  schooling  and  higher  rates  of  illiteracy  (23%),  they  are  constrained  to  subsistence 
farming  with  insufficient  skills,  access  to  markets  and  control  over  land  and  other  key  assets 
and  agricultural  services,  compared  to  men.  Time  burden,  lack  of  access  to  finance  and 
technical  trainings  are  amongst  the  main  issues,  which  constrain  women  in  agriculture21. 
Female-headed households are amongst the poorest segments of the population: 2018 CFSVA 
findings  show  that  33%  of  female-headed  households  falls  in  the  Ubudehe22  category  1 
compared to only 11% of male-headed households in the same category23.  
54. At the programme level, and in line with the 2019-2024 COSOP, women will account for at least 
50% of the beneficiaries. Special attention will be given to female-headed households. Women 
will  be  empowered  to  effectively  engage  in  economic  activities  and  to  increase  their  decision-
making power at the household and community level.  To this end, PRISM will  optimize on the 
experience  gained  in  implementing  Gender  Action  Learning  System  (GALS)  and  other 
participative households approaches in the framework of on-going IFAD operations, contributing 
to  increase  equal  access  of  men  and  women  to  economic  opportunities,  decision-making 
processes and share of workload. 
55. Youth.  Youth  is  defined  in  Rwanda  as  population  aged  16  to  30  years24.  Overall,  youth 
population  makes  up  26.6%  of  the  total  population,  while  50%  of  the  population  is  under  20 
years.  In  the  three  provinces  targeted  by  the  programme,  youth  represents  25%  of  the  total 
rural  population  and  30%  of  agricultural  labourers25.  In  the  rural  areas,  80%  of  youth  is 
literate; however, the level of education is low26 and the percentage of young people attending 
tertiary  education  or  technical  and  vocational  schools  is  extremely  limited.  According  to  the 
EICV5, 77.2% of rural youth are workers, mostly engaged as independent farmers (36% male 
and 53% female). The main challenges for youth entrepreneurship and business development, 
besides  access  to  markets,  include:  lack  of  technical  skills,  limited  access  to  information  and 
opportunities, inadequate access to  land and capital  resources, insufficient support services  to 
build  business  and  management  skills,  (e.g.  internships,  apprenticeships).  To  support  youth 
vocational  and  business  skills  training,  the  programme  will  leverage  the  experience  gained  in 
partnering with the Rwanda Youth Agribusiness Forum (RYAF) in the framework of the on-going 
PASP  and  RDDP  projects,  in  the  delivery  of  training  and  extension  services  and  in  the 
establishment of youth business networks. 
56. Nutrition.  Rwanda  joined  the  Scaling  Up  Nutrition  (SUN)  Movement  in  2011  and  since  then 
several multi-stakeholder platforms have been set up at central and local level. All 30 districts 
19 This has resulted in Rwanda having the highest percentage of women in parliament in the world (64%). Rwanda ranked 
6th out of 149 countries and 4th regarding achievements in political empowerment (Global Gender Gap Report, 2018, WEF).

22 Currently, there are 4 Ubudehe categories, with the first category designated for the poorest and food insecure people, 
the second one for poor/vulnerable people, the third one for more resilient households while the fourth category includes 
the wealthiest members of society (like large business owners). PRIMS will not address households in Category 4.    
23 In most cases, women heads of household are widows and have fewer adult household members that can contribute to 
household’s income.

have developed District Plans to Eliminate Malnutrition (DPEM), which will be references for the 
development  of  nutrition-related  activities  in  the  district  targeted  by  the  programme.  Despite 
marked  reductions  in  chronic  malnutrition,  stunting  remains  one  of  the  Rwanda’s  greatest 
human and economic development challenges. According to the CFSVA 2018 national stunting 
prevalence  has  dropped  from  38%  to  35%  between  2015  and  2018.  The  stunting  rate  has 
significantly  decreased  from  24.8%  to  12.9%  in  the  City  of  Kigali,  but  remains  the  highest  in 
the Western Province at 44%, continuing to be above WHO high severity threshold and a major 
public  health  concern.  The  Northern  Province  is  at  39%  and  the  Southern  Province  at  36%. 
Improved  nutrition  is  at  the  core  of  the  IFAD  Country  Programme.  In  the  context  of  the  on-
going projects, and especially in RDDP, specific interventions have been put in place to improve 
diets  of  the  target  population  and  reduce  the  prevalence  of  chronic  undernutrition.  Actions 
include:  (i)  promoting  nutrition-sensitive  agriculture  and  consumption  of  dairy  and  small 
livestock products, vegetables and fruits, (ii) Social Behavioural Change Communication (SBCC) 
on nutrition; and (iii) promotion of good practices in post-harvest handling and storage. PRISM 
will  benefit  from  the  lessons  learned  from  the  on-going  nutrition-sensitive  activities  and  from 
the capacity installed at SPIU level in mainstreaming nutrition. 
57. Environment  and  climate  focus.  The  high  and  increasing  level  of  population  pressure, 
combined with the susceptibility of soils that exacerbates soil erosion (leading to landslides, soil 
loss and  soil nutrient leaching), challenge agricultural productivity growth. Small livestock  can 
effectively  contribute  to  protect  soils  against  erosion  and  even  restore  their  fertility,  through 
the  provision  of  organic  matter  (manure,  compost,  bio  slurry),  and  through  the  utilization  of 
forage  species  (grasses,  trees  and  shrubs),  which  acts  as  anti-erosive  mechanisms.  In  the 
targeted  areas  of  the  northern,  western  and  southern  provinces,  climate  change  will  result  in 
decrease  of  temperature  and  increase  in  rainfall  means  and  intensities  and  number  of  rainy 
days  (GoR,  2018),  which  may  further  exacerbate  land  erosion,  landslides  and  flooding  of 
agricultural lands. Climate change and increased frequency of  flooding could also increase the 
incidence  of  climate  related  animal  diseases  such  as  Rift  Valley  fever  that  affects  small 
ruminants. 
5. 
Constraints in the small livestock sector development 
58. The  small  ruminants'  value  chains  in  particular  are  still  organized  in  a  rudimentary  manner. 
Unlike  the  dairy  sector,  which  is  well  structured,  there  are  very  few  formal  farmers' 
organizations  (e.g.  cooperatives)  in  the  monogastric27  value  chains,  and  none  for  small 
ruminants. Sales are mostly conducted through middlemen, and access to services and inputs 
is done on individual basis, which makes it inefficient. Slaughtering, processing and marketing 
facilities for small livestock are either inadequate or non-existent. Small abattoirs and slaughter 
slabs  exist  in  different  places,  but  they  are  not  sufficient  in  number,  inadequate  to  serve  the 
needs, and do not meet sanitary and animal welfare standards. There are 64 livestock markets 
distributed  in  the  three  target  provinces,  but  all  of  these  markets  lack  basic  infrastructure  for 
animal holding. 
59. Small  ruminants  production  systems:  Small  ruminants  are  mostly  reared  in  extensive 
systems.  Feeding  system  is  essentially  based  on  natural  pastures  and  supplementary  feeding 
with concentrates or cultivated fodder is uncommon. Vaccination and deworming are not usual 
in  traditional  small  ruminants  systems,  and  the  mortality  of  young  animals,  can  as  a 
consequence be high. The small ruminants are mostly of local breed, even if improved breeds 
have  been  introduced  in  some  areas.  These  crossbreeding  attempts  have  been  moderately 
successful,  mostly  because  of  the  poor  resistance  of  imported  breeds  to  sanitary  shocks  and 
27 Monogastric animals are those with a single stomach, as opposed to ruminants, which have several. In this specific case, 
monogastric  refers to pigs and poultry.

PRISM 
Project Design Report (PDR) 
starvation.  As  a  result  of  these  poor  feeding  and  health  conditions,  and  limited  genetic 
potential, the productivity of small ruminants remains in general very low. 
60. Pig production systems: The traditional pig rearing system is based on utilization of kitchen 
waste and agricultural by-products for feeding the animals. Animals used in these systems are 
local  breeds  that  are  characterized  by  a  very  slow  growth,  limited  prolificacy  and  a  significant 
amount  of  fat.  The  traditional  system  has  a  very  low  productivity  because  of  production 
diseases  and  inadequate  feeding  and  housing.  Modern  pig  husbandry  practices  have  recently 
been introduced to Rwanda. In these systems, animals are usually of imported breeds, are kept 
in confinement and fed with concentrate feed. 
61. Poultry  production  systems:  Two  very  distinct  poultry  production  systems  coexist  in 
Rwanda: the traditional backyard dual purpose production system, and the modern commercial 
poultry  systems.  Whilst  backyard  chicken  systems  are  dual  purpose,  their  productivity is  very 
low because of the genetic potential of local breeds, and also because of the sanitary problems 
(Newcastle  disease  is  the  most  prevalent  and  destructive  poultry  disease  in  rural  areas,  that 
leads  to  mortality  rates  of  chicks  of  50%  and  above).  Commercial  modern  layers  and  broilers 
farms have emerged during the last decade. These farms use imported hybrid strains, and the 
production itineraries are intensive. Their productivity is therefore high. The feed used by these 
systems  is  industrial  and  either  produced  at  the  farm  for  the  bigger  integrated  units  or 
purchased  from  specialized  feed  manufacturers  for  others.  The  size  of  these  units  varies  from 
100 to 60,000 birds. 
62. Competition  between  monogastric  animals  and  human  population  over  food 
resources:  monogastric  animaljoints  such  as  poultry  and  pigs,  unlike  ruminants,  mostly  feed 
on  cereals  and  other  grains  that  are  also  consumed  by  people.  It  is  therefore  a  challenge  to 
support monogastric animals in food insecure countries such as Rwanda because of the risk of 
direct  competition  between  animals  and  human  over  food  resources.  However,  this  adverse 
effect  of  development  of  the  small  livestock  sector  would  be  limited  by:  (1)  putting  more 
emphasis  on  poultry,  that  are  better  feed  converters,  than  pigs,  and  (2)  supporting 
family/backyard pigs and poultry that will also consume kitchen waste, crop by-products (bran) 
and industrial by-products (breweries waste, rice bran). 
63. Animal health: The main endemic diseases28 affecting small livestock systems in Rwanda are 
Newcastle  disease  in  backyard  chicken  systems,  swine  erysipelas  in  rural  pig  systems  and 
enterotoxaemia  in  small  ruminants  systems.  All  could  be  controlled  through  vaccination,  but 
there are no systematic vaccination campaigns organized against these three diseases,  mainly 
because of the inadequate human and financial resources of public veterinary services. On the 
other hand, thanks to a well-managed veterinary public health policy and the limited and well 
controlled cross border movements of animals, the country has so far been spared from major 
Transboundary Animal Diseases (TADs). However, for each species (small ruminants, pork and 
poultry), the risk of introduction of a major and deadly TAD remains significant. Three diseases 
in particular pose a high risk for these value chains: Peste des Petits Ruminants (PPR) for goats 
and  sheep,  African  Swine  Fever  (ASF)  for  pigs,  and  Highly  Pathogenic  Avian  Influenza  (HPAI) 
for poultry. 
64. Inputs and services: There are now seven main animal feed producers in the country. None 
of these companies run at full capacity (on average 50% to 60%). Poultry feed represents over 
80%  of  their  sales.  Some  of  these  animal-feed  manufacturers  are  at  the  same  time  either

large-scale  producers  of  chicken,  or  processors/buyers.  The  recently  privatized  National 
Hatchery and private company "Easy Hatch" are the major suppliers of DOCs, but the country 
still relies heavily on imports. In the pig value chain, availability of good quality piglets and gilts 
is a major issue since there are very few specialized breeders with good genetic material on the 
market. 
65. Slaughtering,  marketing  and  processing  facilities  for  small  ruminants,  poultry  and  pigs 
are  either  inadequate  or  non-existent,  except  for  some  major  poultry  producers  who  have 
established  their  own  abattoirs.  Those  that  are  present  do  not  ensure  proper  hygiene  and 
animal  welfare.  The  small  ruminants'  value  chains  are  often  very  rudimentarily  organized  and 
sales are mostly conducted through middlemen at farm gate or local animal markets. There is 
in particular a crucial lack of pig slaughter slabs, with only a handful of them accredited.  
66. Small Livestock Farmers organizations: There are very few formal farmers' organizations in 
the  small  livestock  sector,  and  none  for  small  ruminants.  In  the  poultry  sector,  the  Rwanda 
Poultry  Industry  Association  is  the  main  umbrella  organization.  In  the  pig  sector,  the  Rwanda 
Pig  Farmers  Association  is  the  main  stakeholder  organization.  Its  main  activities  are  the 
organization  of  capacity  building  and  information  sharing  events.  There  are  no  commodity-
based  stakeholder  platforms  in  the  small  livestock  value  chains,  but  this  model  exists  in 
Rwanda for other value chains (crops and dairy). 
67. The Rwandan financial sector is characterized by a high level of financial inclusion (89% of 
the population having access to formal and informal financial services, compared with 85% in 
Kenya)29,  and  diversified  players  in  the  market  (Banks,  MFIs,  SACCOs,  informal  systems  like 
VSLAs). Agriculture remains largely underfinanced, especially for smallholder farmers, but there 
is  a  growing  interest  from  the  financial  sector  to  venture  into  agricultural  finance.  Some 
commercial banks and MFIs have set up specialized agricultural finance units. 
6.  Rationale for IFAD involvement 
68. IFAD  as  a  trusted  partner:  IFAD  remains  a  trusted  partner  for  the  GoR  having  successfully 
provided  its  support  to  the  dairy  sector  (RDDP)  and  export  value  chains  (PRICE).  Against  this 
backdrop  the  GoR  requested  IFAD  to  support  its  strategy  of  modernizing  the  small  livestock 
value chains. In doing so, this will allow the GoR to widen its sectorial coverage in livestock and 
balance  its  support  geographically  in  areas  (i.e.  West  and  South),  which  receive  less  support 
and are more affected by poverty and malnutrition. It will also allow the targeting of the most 
vulnerable households, for which small livestock is an appropriate way out of poverty and can 
serve as a buffer to mitigate the impact of crisis, thus contributing to increase their resilience.  
In  this  context,  a  recent  IFAD  impact  assessment  reported  that  for  an  overall  beneficiary 
population  of  approximately  240  million  reached  by  IFAD-supported  projects  that  were  either 
closing  or  ongoing  between  2010  and  2015,  projections  suggest  that  44  million  beneficiaries 
will  see  positive  gains  in  poultry  asset  ownership  (28.8  million)  and livestock  asset  ownership 
(22.8 million). A joint IFAD - International Goat Association study revealed that the "net income 
before  labour  cost"  increased  on  average  by  120%  in  Nepal,  India  and  Tajikistan  with  IFAD 
project  interventions.  In  Rajasthan  (IMgoat  project),  resource  poor  goat  farmers  earned  250-
300%  higher  incomes  from  goat  rearing  only  by  adopting  improved  goat  management 
practices. In Mauritania, an increase in production of approximately 500 tonnes of white meat a 
year  (for  a  value  of  USD  1.5  million)  was  registered.  In  Senegal,  a  total  of  1,966  women 
29 Finscope Rwanda 2016. High financial inclusion is largely driven by Umurenge SACCOs, promoted by the GoR and 
operating in all administrative sectors, and mobile money providers.

Project Design Report (PDR) 
poultry  producers  have  marketed  1,  1  M  chickens  for  a  turnover  of  about  USD  2,860  per 
household. 
69. Creating economic opportunities for vulnerable households: Small ruminants can greatly 
contribute  to  generate  economic  opportunities  for  vulnerable  households  and  especially  for 
women.  Moreover,  in  a  context  where  child  undernutrition  remains  an  important  development 
challenge,  small  livestock  sector  can  contribute  to  play  an  important  role  in  combatting 
malnutrition. Targeting small livestock will also allow targeting young rural people, unemployed 
and  with  a  low  educational  level,  for  whom  small  livestock  value  chain  development  has 
demonstrated  to  be  an 
important  pathway  to  generate  employment  and  economic 
opportunities. These productions, in fact, are particularly well adapted to youth, as they require 
a  very  limited  amount  of  land,  limited  investment  and  they  can  provide  a  quick  return  on 
investment.  
70. Market  demand  opportunities:  Between  2000  and  201730,  the  domestic  consumption  per 
capita for small livestock products has grown by 688% for poultry meat, 79% for pig meat, and 
111% for small ruminants' meat. This growing market demand thus provides an opportunity for 
rural  livelihood  transformation.  Moreover,  Rwanda's  low  urbanization  level  is  compensated  by 
the  presence  of  two  significant  urban  centers  in  the  Democratic  Republic  of  Congo  (DRC): 
Goma  (1.2M  people)  and  Bukavu  (0.9M  people).  The  value  of  small  stock,  exported  to  DRC, 
increased by 27% between 2010 and 201531, and by 140% for pig only over the same period. 
This  market  is  expected  to  keep  growing  in  the  near  future.  An  assessment  of  the  pig  and 
poultry  markets  will  be  conducted  before  the  project  start-up  by  Palladium,  under  a  DFID 
funded civil society strengthening programme. The outcome will be available before the end of 
2019  and  will  be  a  critical  decision-making  tool  for  PRISM,  in  particular  for  selecting  the 
Districts  of  interventions,  private  sector  partners  and  sites  for  market  access  public 
investments. 
71. Potential for increased production: The productivity of small livestock in Rwanda could thus 
be  substantially increased  to  respond  to  this  external  cross-border  market  demand,  especially 
for the traditional systems (extensive small ruminants, backyard pig and chicken). Specifically, 
productivity  could  be  significantly  enhanced  by  simple  animal  health  measures  as  well  as 
through genetic improvement, although crossbreeding should be handled with care in order not 
to affect resistance to diseases and feed scarcity. The other option to respond to the increasing 
market demand would be to establish new production units. Due to the land constraint, farmers 
cannot easily extend their cultivation area, and creating a small poultry or a pig unit could thus 
be  a  solution  for  smallholder  farmers  to  expand  their  activity,  without  additional  land 
requirement. 
72. IFAD's leading role in ensuring synergies with other development partners to support 
the  Rwandan  small  livestock  sector.  The  engagement  of  other  development  partners 
(ENABEL, USAID/Feed the Future) in supporting the small livestock sector in a Rwanda confirms 
this sector's economic potential and also the GoR's political will to invest in the sector. Indeed, 
PRISM  is  a  partnership  programme,  implemented  by  RAB,  and  jointly  supported  by  IFAD  and 
ENABEL, with Heifer International as implementing partner and co-financer, and VSF Belgium as 
implementing partner  
73. The distribution of roles between IFAD and its partners in supporting the small livestock sector 
builds  on  the  Fund  experience  and  strategic  niche,  and  will  put  emphasis  on  support  to 
vulnerable communities, investing in key public goods necessary for an healthy and sustainable 
30 FAO, 2017

Project Design Report (PDR) 
growth  of  the  livestock  sector.  This  will  complement  and  leverage  the    strong  emphasis  on 
private sector and commercial value chains of the other development partners. 
B.  Lessons Learned  
74. Need  to  address  sanitary  risks:  The  experience  of  other  livestock  development  projects 
indicate that all efforts dedicated to building up a livestock value chain could be ruined in case 
of major animal disease outbreak. The World Bank has now integrated this risk in the design of 
its  livestock  development  projects  through  inclusion  of  contingency  response  measures, 
targeting in particular animal disease  risks, but also sometimes climatic risks. The principle of 
these mechanisms is that in case of crisis, the programme could mobilize programme financial 
resources  to  partially  cover  emergency  response  and  costs,  for  instance  for  vaccinating 
animals, establishing protection zones or compensating stamping out. 
75. Approach  to  small  ruminants’  value  chain:  In  Rwanda,  several  successive  projects 
supporting  small  ruminants’  production  have  been  confronted  with  challenges  in  trying  to 
establish  durable  small  livestock  activities  with  the  most  vulnerable  households.  A  significant 
proportion of the households that were provided with start-up packages which included animals 
were  not  able  to  keep  them  in  the  long-run  and  had  no  other  choice  than  selling  them  when 
confronted with crisis such as sickness, food shortage, or another urgent need for cash. One of 
the  reasons  for  this  failure  is  that  small  ruminants  are  often  not  considered  as  a  long-term 
investment, but more as a safety net, which can be disposed of in case of need. On top of this, 
the  most  vulnerable  households  often  do  not  have  other  alternative  economic  safety  nets  in 
case  of  shock.  With  this  target  population,  and  if  placement  of  animals  is  envisaged,  it  is 
important  to  properly  prepare  the  community  before  handing  over  the  animals,  by 
strengthening social capital of groups as a preliminary. 
76. Cattle  and  small  livestock:  Another  lesson  from  several  IFAD  projects  in  the  region  is  that 
when  projects  target  both  cattle  production  and  small  ruminants  within  the  same  community, 
cattle  are  always  privileged  by  beneficiaries,  and  little  attention  is  given  to  small livestock.  In 
order  to  avoid  this,  the  programme  should  focus  its  activities  in  areas  and  with  communities 
where dairy cattle do not play a central role in the economy of households (such as the Eastern 
Province in particular). Districts targeted by the RDDP should thus not be a priority for PRISM, 
both  because  they  are  more  oriented  towards  dairy  than  other  districts,  and  because  RDDP 
support may attract more interest from beneficiaries than PRISM activities. 
77. Access  to  finance:  The  main  lesson  learned  from  past  and  current  IFAD-funded  projects  in 
Rwanda  is  that  there  is  too  much  focus  on  the  management  of  matching  grants  for  various 
categories of programme beneficiaries, without proper analysis of their rationale in the context 
of  the  Rwandan  financial  sector,  which  is  showing  a  growing  appetite  for  agricultural  finance. 
This results in inefficient use of public resources and risks of crowding out the financial sector. 
PRISM  should  therefore  have  a  sustained  focus  on  supporting  linkages  of  the  beneficiaries  to 
the  financial  sector  for  access  to  sustainable  financial  services.  This  should  be  done  by 
providing adequate capacity building support both on demand and supply sides and structuring 
of the value chains to contribute to risk mitigation for the financial institutions. Use of matching 
grants  should  be  limited  to  incentivize  and  facilitate  access  to  finance  for  high  risk  borrowers 
(such  as  youth),  either  because  of  lack  of  business  track  record  or  lack  of  collateral,  and  to 
incentivize development of public good related investment by the private sector. 
78. Necessary  pre-and  post-financing  support  in  grant  schemes/financial  packages.  The 
particular  experience  of  the  Climate  Resilient  Post-harvest  and  Agribusiness  Support 
Programme (PASP) has shown that when there is insufficient support to follow-up, monitor and 
accompany business promoters along their project once it has been declared eligible to a grant, 
there  is  a  risk  that  the  business  plan  implementation  will  either  fail  to  honour  loan 
commitments,  become  short  of  working  capital,  or  divert  from  the  original  business  idea.  The 
9 
Partnership for Resilient and Inclusive Small Livestock Markets 
PRISM 
Project Design Report (PDR) 
lesson  learned  is  that  grant  facilities  set  to  support  business  development  should  include 
systematically pre- and post-finance support along three  key stages: (i) Pre-financing support 
aimed  at  filling  any  potential  business  gaps  (including  governance);  (ii)  Finance  and  business 
launch facilitation to  assist applicants in developing realistic and fundable business plans; and 
(iii)  Post-finance  support  consisting  in  business  coaching  for  successful  applicants,  including 
follow up on the businesses financed and support on the actual implementation of the business 
plan. PRISM will thus make extensive use of Business Development Service Providers  (BDSPs) 
to  support  youth,  start-up  farmers,  and  private  investors  across  the  various  project 
interventions. 
79. MINAGRI small livestock for the youth project: the main lessons from this project are that 
commercial poultry or pig farming can be very attractive to youth, because it provides a quick 
return  on  investment,  and  responds  to  their  specific  constraints,  because  it  requires  limited 
land and investment. However, the collective ownership and management of farms, which affect 
the ownership and commitment, had some consequences on the performance of the production 
units, and alternative solutions should be tested (such as independent and individual production 
units). 
80. Heifer  Values-Based  Holistic  Community  Development  (VBHCD)  model  (pro-poor 
graduation  approach):  This  model  has  been  successfully  implemented  in  Asia,  and  East 
Africa, within marginalized communities, including sub-groups of different socioeconomic levels. 
One  of  the  lessons  is  that  the  project  group  should  be  open  to  all  of  the  sub-groups  that  are 
present in the community. By building social capital and being inclusive in the group formation, 
the  strengths  of  a  community  can  be  fully  deployed.    When  members  are  excluded  from  this 
process,  this  benefit  cannot  be  ensured.  This  builds  community  solidarity,  combats 
discrimination and ultimately mitigates elite capture. 
81. Productive  Alliances:  in  commercial  pig  and  poultry  value  chains,  regular  supply  in  quality 
feed,  chicks/piglets  and  access  to  market  are  critical.  In  many  countries,  the  solution  for 
enabling smallholder to access services, inputs and market is the cooperative.  The cooperative 
model  is  popular  in  Rwanda  for  dairy,  but  it  does  not  exist  for  monogastric  animals.  What  is 
common  though  in  Rwanda,  are  arrangements  whereby  a  bigger  farmer,  a  feed  miller,  or  a 
hatcher,  supplies  inputs  to  smallholders  located  around  him,  with  advisory  services,  and 
sometimes  market  access  services  too.  This  context  offers  very  good  opportunities  for 
implementing  productive  alliances.  However,  to  ensure  that  these  arrangements  preserve  the 
preserve  the  autonomy  and  incomes  of  smallholders,  the  programme  should  ensure  that  they 
are transparent, predictable, equitable, and mutually beneficial.  
82. Community  Animal  Health  Workers:  IFAD  has  a  very  robust  and  diversified  experience  in 
establishing  networks  of  Community  Animal  Health  Workers  (CAHWs),  in  various  contexts. 
Experience has shown that CAHWs are an adequate response to address animal health needs in 
contexts  where  animal  health  problems  are  relatively  simple  and  can  be  solved  with  easily 
implemented solutions. The vaccination against Newcastle disease is a perfect example of this 
type of  situation.  CAHWS, in particular for small livestock, can include a  significant proportion 
of  women  and  youth.  CAHWS,  because  they  belong  to  the  community,  are  also  more  able  to 
bring behavior  change in remote  and traditional communities, than  external elements.  On the 
other hand, intensive  systems  such as dairy,  intensive broilers  or layers, which require a high 
level  of  technicity  and  involve  substantial  financial  volumes,  require  other  arrangements 
involving veterinarians or veterinary technicians. 
83. Economic  efficiency  of  small-scale  livestock  systems:  small  scale  intensive  systems  are 
usually  less  economically  efficient  than  large  commercial  intensive  systems.  However,  they 
supply  the  market  with  a  fresher  product  (chicken  sold  alive  to  proximity  customers)  and  are 
more  flexible  in  terms  of  reducing  costs  (e.g.  mixing  commercial  feed  with  lower  costs 
10 
Partnership for Resilient and Inclusive Small Livestock Markets 
PRISM 
Project Design Report (PDR) 
feedstuff).    In  addition,  the  problem  of  economy  of  scale  is  less  important  in  Rwanda  than  in 
other African countries for two main reasons:  (1) distances are very short and transport cost of 
feed and products are minimal; access to services and market is thus not a challenge for small 
scale  systems;  and  (2)  Rwandese  rural  producers  have  a  strong  culture  of  small  scale  and 
intensive production, also due to the low availability of land. Small scale intensive systems, in 
dairy,  poultry  and  pig,  have  shown  to  be  a  successful  and  sustainable  model  in  Rwanda.  This 
will be highlighted in the PDR. 
84. Involvement  of  District  Staff  in  Programme  Activities:  the  experience  of  ongoing  IFAD 
funded  projects  shows  that  involvement  of  District  staff  in  implementation  of  project  field 
activities only takes place as per the plans if the project allocates and provides adequate means 
(perdiem  and  transport  allowances)  to  the  Districts  to  enable  the  personnel  to  carry  on  field 
missions. 
85. Single Project Implementation Unit (SPIU). The competitively-staffed SPIU, responsible for the 
implementation  of  all  IFAD  funded  projects  has  proved  to  be  effective  in  providing  a  solid 
foundation  for  quick  implementation  start-up  and  timely  disbursements.  PRISM  will  use  the 
same implementation arrangements. 
86. RDDP  experience.  PRISM  will  strongly  benefit  from  the  experience  and  lessons  learned  with 
the  Rwanda  Dairy  Development  Project  (RDDP),  which  have  informed  the  programme  design, 
especially  with  regard  to  the:  (i)  relevance  of  building  the  capacity  of  both  public  and  private 
veterinary services at central and district levels; (ii) importance of Field Farmers Schools (FFS) 
as  an  instrument  to  improve  fodder  cultivation  for  dairy  cattle  and  small  ruminant  producers; 
(iii)  need  to  work  on  both  the  demand  and  supply  of  adequate  financial  service  providers, 
building  trust  between    beneficiaries  and  financial  institutions;  and  (iv)  importance  of 
proactively  support  institutional  reforms  by  providing  technical  expertise  and  facilitating 
inclusive policy dialogue (using both national-and district-level platforms). 
III.  Project Description 
A. 
Programme structure and partnership principles 
87. PRISM  is  a  partnership  programme  implemented  by  RAB,  and  jointly  supported  by  IFAD  and 
ENABEL, with Heifer International as implementing partner and co-financer, and VSF Belgium as 
implementing  partner  (see  figure  below).  PRISM  is  constituted  of  two  complementary 
interventions, supported respectively by IFAD and ENABEL, whose content and strategies have 
been  aligned,  and  which  will  be  implemented  jointly,  under  a  common  implementation 
mechanism.  Heifer  will  implement  activities  in  the  framework  of  the  IFAD  supported 
intervention,  and  VSFB  will  contribute  to  the  implementation  of  some  ENABEL-  supported 
activities.  In  addition  of  being  an  implementing  partner,  Heifer  is  also  a  co-financier  of  the 
activities  it  will  implement  (this  is  not  the  case  of  VSFB).  RAB/SPIU  will  implement  activities 
under both interventions.

88. The  ENABEL  and  IFAD  interventions  were  initially  designed  separately,  but  in 
agreement  with  the  GoR,  they  have  been  harmonized  and  aligned  under  the  same 
partnership  programme  i.e.  PRISM.  This  alignment  has  been  done  in  accordance  with  the 
respective  mandates  of  the  agencies,  their  comparative  advantages  and  the  nature  of  the 
financing (grant for ENABEL, loan for IFAD), which resulted in the following: 
  At  production  level,  IFAD-supported  interventions  will  target  primarily  smallholder 
livestock  holdings  and  vulnerable  households,  while  ENABEL  will  engage  and  support 
larger scale commercial and industrial actors; 
 
 
In terms of geographical repartition, IFAD-supported interventions will focus on districts 
that are the most affected by poverty and malnutrition; 
In  terms  of  value  chains,  IFAD-supported  interventions  will  target  mainly  the  small 
ruminants,  backyard  pig  and  backyard  chicken  value  chains,  that  correspond  to  its 
priority  target  groups,  when  ENABEL  will  concentrate  on  pig  and  poultry  commercial 
value chains; 
  ENABEL  will  provide  support  to  large  scale  private  businesses  (feed  manufacturers, 
hatcheries, processors) in the pig and poultry value chains; 
 
IFAD-supported interventions will also support public investments and public institutions, 
in particular in the domain of veterinary public health. 
89. The overall growth and strengthening of the small livestock value chain can take place only if all 
value  chain  actors,  at  all  levels,  are  able  to  participate  and  contribute:  the  smallholder  and 
vulnerable  producers,  but  also  the  bigger  private  sector  actors  especially  at  processing  and 
input provision levels. The partnership with ENABEL allows IFAD to concentrate its support to its 
core  target  group:  the  vulnerable  rural  producers,  while  ENABEL,  leveraging  its  comparative 
advantage,  will  also  support  more  market-oriented  value  chain  actors.  This  complementarity 
allows each partner to  operate within its mandate and to leverage its comparative advantage, 
jointly contributing to a healthy and sustainable growth of the sector.

91. Heifer and IFAD are working in partnership on smallholder livestock support in various countries 
(Ghana, Vietnam and Cambodia). IFAD and Heifer have a general MoU, signed in 2017. Heifer 
has been working in Rwanda since 2000; it has been mostly active in the dairy sector and is a 
pivotal  implementing  partner  and  co-financier  of  RDDP.  Heifer  has  successfully  implemented 
two  projects  supporting  small  livestock  value  chains  in  Rwanda,  including  one  supported  by 
IFAD (KWAMP).

92. Vétérinaires Sans Frontières Belgium (VSFB) is a NGO, working in 8 African countries. VSFB has 
been  operating  in  Rwanda  since  2003.  VSFB  facilitates  livestock  farmers'  access  to  veterinary 
services  through  the  establishment  of  private  veterinarians  in  rural  areas  and  supports  the 
development of livestock projects by local groups through access to micro-finance services;  
93. The section below focuses mostly on the description of the IFAD supported interventions, but it 
also reflects the ENABEL contribution and the partnership modalities for each activity, in order 
to highlight the complementarities. 
B. 
Programme objectives, geographic area of intervention and target groups  
1.  Programme objectives  
94. Programme overall objective: PRISM's overall objective is to reduce poverty by empowering 
poor rural men, women and youth to participate in the transformation of the Rwanda livestock 
sector  and  to  enhance  their  resilience.  Specifically,  the  programme  seeks  to  increase 
competitiveness  and  profitability  of  the  small  livestock  sector  for  the  provision  of  quality 
products from smallholder producers to domestic and regional consumers. 
95. Programme  development  objective  (PDO):  The  PDO  is  to  “Improve  food  and  nutrition 
security and incomes of poor rural households and through better performance of the targeted 
value chains”. 
96. Contribution  to  COSOP  SOs:  The  programme  will  directly  contribute  to  the  2019-2024 
COSOP  SOs,  namely  “sustainably  increase  agricultural  productivity  in  priority  food  and  export 
value  chains  and  improve  livelihoods  and  resilience  of  the  rural  population”  (SO1),  through 
activities  aiming  at  intensifying  small  livestock  production  and  strengthening  their  resilience 
against  sanitary,  climatic  or  economic  shocks.  It  will  also  contribute  to  “improve  post-harvest 
processes,  strengthen  market  linkages  and  generate  economic  opportunities  for  men,  women 
and youth in rural areas” (SO2), through promotion of partnership mechanisms to improve the 
inclusion of smallholders in the value chains. 
97. Contribution  to  IFAD’s  SOs:  The  programme  is  also  fully  aligned  to  the  three  IFAD  SOs.  It 
will  contribute  to  SO1  (increased  production)  through  intensification  of  production  systems, 
productivity gains and expansion of production assets; to SO2 ( increased market participation) 
through  promotion  of  partnerships  between  smallholders  and  private  sector  actors  to  improve 
access  to  market  and    services;  and  to  SO3  (greater  resilience)  by  improving  resilience  of 
animals to sanitary crisis on the one hand, and reinforcing the traditional role of small livestock 
as a buffer mechanism in case of shock. 
2.  Programme duration and geographic area 
98. Programme duration: the programme will have a total implementation duration of 5 years. 
99. Targeted  districts  and  Geographical  repartition  between partners:  The  IFAD  supported 
interventions  will  target  a  total  of  15  districts  distributed  across  the  northern,  southern  and 
western  provinces  of  Rwanda32,  where  poverty  and  malnutrition  are  widespread.  The  three 
provinces  together  have  a  population  of  approximately  1,769,000  households  (62.6%  of  the 
total  number  of  households  at  the  national  level)33,  corresponding  to  7,784,000  people34,  of 
32 Other districts, e.g. Bugesera (Eastern province) and the city of Kigali may be targeted for specific activities, such as the 
establishment  of  strategic  partnerships  between  small  holders  and  the  private  sector  and  their  inclusion  in  productive 
alliances or Public Private Producers Partnerships (4P) arrangements.

which  20%  are  in  Ubudehe35  category  1,  38%  in  category  2,  42%  in  category  3  and  only 
0.10%  are  in  category  4,  with  marginal  differences  between  the  provinces.  The  population 
living in rural areas amounts to 89%36. 
100.  ENABEL interventions will have a national coverage but will be concentrating on areas with 
higher  potential  for  market-oriented  poultry  and  pig  production,  and  where  the  larger 
commercial producers are located (such as Kigali, Rwamagana, Musanze, and Lake Kivu region 
(Rubavu and Rusizi).  
101.  Geographical  targeting  criteria.  The  selection  of  the  IFAD  targeted  districts  and  their 
respective sectors will be based on the following criteria: (i) districts with high rates of poverty 
and  food  insecurity;  (ii)  districts  with  comparative  advantage  for  the  development  of  specific 
small  livestock  value  chains,  such  as  the  existence  of  a  traditional  production  basin,  the 
proximity  of  a  strong  market,  favourable  environmental  conditions  or  the  availability  of 
resource  base;  (iii)  sectors  not  targeted  by  other  development  projects.  In  this  regard,  in 
addition  to  the  internal  alignment  and  coordination  between  the  two  PRISM  partners,  the 
programme  will  also  align  and  partner  with  other  development  partners  in  Rwanda37  to  avoid 
the duplication of investments and to seek complementarity among the proposed interventions. 
3.  Target groups 
102.  The  targeting  strategies  deployed  under  the  IFAD  and  ENABEL  interventions  are  fully 
complementary and will allow PRISM to  engage all value chain players, while allowing IFAD to 
reach  the  different  segments  of  its  core  IFAD  target  group.  The  IFAD  outreach  strategy  will 
target  the  poorest  zones  and  households  that  are  affected  by  malnutrition,  while  ENABEL  will 
also target the more market-oriented areas and commercially mature farmers/households. The 
combination of these complementary approaches offer the opportunity to strengthen the entire 
value  chains  (mainly  poultry,  pork  and  goat  meat),  enhancing  the  sustainability,  and  at  the 
same  time  allowing  better  targeting  of  activities  tailored  to  the  specific  needs  of  programme 
beneficiaries, in line with the respective mandates of both institutions. 
103.  The  IFAD  targeting  mechanisms38  will  be  based  on  the  national  wealth  ranking  system 
(Ubudehe)  and  consistent  with  the  targeting  strategy  outlined  in  the  RB-COSOP.  The  IFAD 
supported interventions will directly benefit a total of 26,355 poor rural households belonging to 
Ubudehe categories 1, 2 with the 'graduation approach' promoted with Heifer international  and 
Ubudehe  339  through  the  'productive  alliances'.  Within  the  beneficiaries,  the  programme  will 
address  three  main  target  groups40  that  will  be  reached  through  complementary  approaches 
meant to support their participation in commercial and inclusive value chains:  
   23,400  poor  and  food  insecure  rural  households  (approximately  88,000  household 
members  falling  in  Ubudehe  category  1  and  2)  amongst  whom  the  programme  will  give 
35 Following the Ubudehe ranking system, people in Rwanda are grouped into 4 categories. Cat. 1: People who do not own 
a house or cannot pay a rent, have a poor diet and can hardly afford basic household tools and clothes; Cat. 2: Those who 
have a dwelling of their own or are able to rent one, mostly get food and wages from working for others but rarely get full 
time jobs; and Cat. 3: Those who have a job and farmers who go beyond subsistence farming to produce a surplus, which 
can be sold. The fourth category (not targeted by PRISM) includes people who earn high incomes; people who own houses; 
people who can afford a luxurious lifestyle.

priority to the most vulnerable households, women (and among the latter to women heads 
of  households),  and  youth.  Poorest  households,  composed  of  subsistence  farmers,  mostly 
food insecure and with limited land and access to resources, have few active members and 
are more often headed by a single person. With this target group the programme will deploy 
a  pro-poor  approach  through  a  graduation  pathway41  (Values-Based  Holistic  Community 
Development-  VBHCD-  model)  aiming  at  improving  nutrition,  reducing  inequalities, 
enhancing  production  and  ultimately  market  access  and  income  generation.  The  VBHCD 
model  entails  that,  within  the  targeted  communities,  the  most  vulnerable  households  are 
identified in a participatory way at the beginning of programme’s implementation; although 
the holistic approach and related activities will be open to all community members despite 
their  socio-economic  conditions,  the  package  of  services  provided  will  be  tailored  to  the 
specific households’ needs.  
   1,425  market-oriented  producers  (See  details  in  para.  118,  component  2)  (525 
broiler  farmers,  450  eggs  producers,  450  pig  fatteners),  mostly  in  Ubudehe  category  2 
(graduated  from  VBHCD)  and  3,  who  will  be  targeted  across  all  districts.  These  less 
vulnerable  producers  who  are  already  engaged  in  a  more  entrepreneurial logic  and  will  be 
supported  through  a  combination  of  technical,  business  and  financial  capacity  building 
combined with backward and forward market facilitation. This will be provided in the scope 
of  innovative  value  chain  arrangements  that  facilitate  the  participation  of  smallholders  in 
commercial value chains. 
  1,530  rural  youth  (See  details  in  para.  120,  Component  2)  (at  least  50%  women), 
aged between 16 and 30 years, in including but not limited to Ubudehe categories 1 and 2 
(graduated from VBHCD), unemployed and with low educational level, and 3 (more littered 
and basic agriculture/livestock keeping knowledge). This target group will receive support to 
organize themselves into small livestock production cooperatives and receive a full start-up 
package,  including  initial  technical  and  managerial  training,  provision  of  business 
development services, and assets building will be provided. 
   Other  direct  beneficiaries  will  be  approximately  900,000  households  raising  small 
livestock that will benefit by vaccination campaigns against major small livestock diseases. 
The  programme  will  also  benefit  service  providers,  such  as  the  Community  Agro-Vet 
Entrepreneurs  and  veterinary  services,  through  the  provision  of  training  and  capacity 
strengthening;  members  of  national  producers  organizations  as  well  as  district  staff  and 
RAB trainers that will be trained on matters related to the governance and the management 
of their organizations and to the development of small livestock value chain, respectively.  
104.  The  programme  will  adopt  an  inclusive  approach  to  ensure  that  women  and  men  equally 
benefit  from  programme's  interventions.  Overall,  women  will  account  for  at  least  50  %  of  the 
beneficiaries,  and  female-headed  households  and  women  in  male-headed  households  will  be 
empowered  to  participate  in  programme  activities  or  engage  in  economic  activities.  Young 
people (at least 50% women) will represent at least 30% of the overall number of beneficiaries.  
105.  The number of beneficiaries per value chain will be: 4,500 households for small ruminants, 
4,25042 for poultry and 2,45043 for pigs. 
41 The graduation pathway refers to a set of interventions that target the poorest and vulnerable beneficiaries with 
productive assets and skill development initiatives and that are meant to break out of the poverty cycle. The graduation 
pathway will be based on the Values-Based Holistic Community Development (VBHCD) model designed and implemented 
by Heifer International. A description of the VBHCD model is provided in the Project Implementation Manual.

106.  The number of beneficiaries targeted through the ENABEL supported interventions is 21,254 
in  total,  composed  as  follows:  (a)  12,000  producers  of  chicken  and  pork  supported  through 
FFS;  (b)  9,000  soybean  and  maize  producers  supported  through  FFS;  (c)  25  medium  scale 
producers and 2 large scale producers in the pig sector, and 200 medium scale producers and 2 
large scale producers in the poultry sector will benefit from business development services and 
capital  investment  support;  and  (d)  25  enterprises  operating  in  the  targeted  value  chains. 
ENABEL  beneficiaries  will  be  mostly  in  Ubudehe  3  and  4,  and  some  in  Ubudehe  2.  The  total 
number  of  beneficiaries  targeted  under  the  programme  by  both  implementing  agencies  is 
therefore 47,609.

Components/outcomes and activities  
Component  1  -  Climate-smart  intensification  of  small  livestock  production 
systems   
Sub-component 1.1: Social mobilization and graduation of vulnerable households (to be 
implemented by Heifer International under IFAD intervention) 
107.  Through  this  sub-component,  which  will  be  implemented  by  Heifer  International,  the 
programme  will  reach  23,400  poor  and  food  insecure  rural  households  (Ubudehe  1  and  2)  for 
whom  the  programme  will  use  a  pro-poor  approach,  through  a  graduation  pathway  (VBHCD 
model),  aimed  at  addressing  community  development  through  an  integrated  and  holistic 
approach.  This  model  builds  on  12  Cornerstones©44  aimed  at  strengthening  the  capacity  of 
smallholder farmers (including financial literacy, nutrition education, business management and 
increase gender equity) to increase their production and productivity, while connecting them to 
markets. Heifer International will capitalize on its existing experience and expertise in Rwanda, 
the Africa region and globally, including within IFAD-financed projects. The main features of the 
VBHCD will be as follows: 
108.  Self  Help  Group  (SHG)  Formation:  SHGs  are  the  foundation  for  VBHCD.  Specifically, 
Heifer International will first help community members to organize themselves into SHGs, with 
one representative from each household. Each SHG is generally constituted of 20-30 members. 
Within  a  group,  it  will  be  likely  to  have  representatives  from  different  socio-economic  sub-
groups (extremely vulnerable and food insecure and less vulnerable). The groups will be open 
to  all  sub-groups  present  in  the  community  and  they  will  be  trained  together  in  order  to 
strengthen their social capital. However, the package of services provided will be tailored to the 
specific  households’  needs,  depending  on  their  social  and  economic  situation.  The  12 
Cornerstones© for Just and Sustainable Development are used to focus the group on the shared 
values of the self and community.  
109.  Training  of  Farmers:  Farmers  will  undergo  trainings  in  both  hard  and  soft  skill 
development including on basic nutrition, gender and leadership modules for men and women, 
Values-Based  Financial  Literacy,  and  environmental  management.  Further,  farmers  will  be 
trained  on  small  business  entrepreneurship,  on-and  off-farm  income  generation,  production, 
aggregation,  transportation,  processing,  distribution/retail,  and  marketing.  Finally,  prior  to 
livestock  placement,  technical  assistance  focusing  on  poultry,  sheep,  swine  and  goat  value 
chains (depending on the type of livestock placed) will be provided to farmers to help increase 
their  production  and  productivity.  This  training  includes  capacity  building  in  breeding, 
43 1,500 vulnerable households + 500 youth + 450 commercial producers 
44 The 12 Cornerstones© cover a range of shared values and principles, abbreviated in Passing on the Gift.  Accountability; 
Sharing and Caring; Sustainability and Self Reliance; Improved Animal and Resource Management; Nutrition, Health, and 
Income; Gender and Family Focus; Genuine need and Justice; Improving the Environment; Full Participation; Training, 
Education and Communication; and Spirituality. 
17 
Partnership for Resilient and Inclusive Small Livestock Markets

husbandry,  feeding,  including  zero-grazing,  health  and  reproduction.  Farmers  will  also  be 
trained  on  ways  to  address  seasonality  such  as  post-harvest  storage,  which  will  make  higher 
quality feed available during the dry season. In addition to local trainings, South-South learning 
will be facilitated by conducting exchange visits between Rwanda, Kenya, Nepal, and Cambodia 
so Rwanda may benefit from  successful breeding and feeding models that Heifer  International 
is implementing in the region and in Asia. 
110.  Input  Provision  and  Passing  on  the  Gift  (PoG):  Once  farmers  have  completed  their 
training  series,  female  animals  of  locally-adapted/improved  breeds  will  be  passed  on  from 
household-to-household. In this regard, the selection of the first PoG’s recipients will be done in 
a  participatory  way;  group  members  themselves  will  be  asked  to  identify,  within  each  group, 
the neediest households, which will be prioritized in receiving the first animal. In this context, 
attention will be given to the most food insecure and vulnerable households and, particularly, to 
those  headed  by  women.  In  addition  to  placement  of  animals,  farmers  will  be  provided  with 
initial  starter  packs  (inputs  and  small  equipment).  Smallholders  will  be  trained  in  building 
proper  housing  and  will  receive  most  of  the  materials  necessary  for  the  construction,  co-
investing  about  20%.  Ahead  of  livestock  placement,  farmers  receive  inputs  for  fodder  plots, 
such as grasses and legumes. 
111.  Participatory Self-Review and Planning (PSRP): Throughout the life of the programme, 
farmers will participate in PSRP, a values-based participatory review and planning methodology 
designed  for  assessing  programme  implementation  progress,  community  participation  level, 
and learning and planning for action.  
112.  Complementarities  and  alignment  with  ENABEL  intervention:  The  VBHCD  will  be 
implemented  in  the  IFAD  targeted  Districts  only,  and  will  target  households  from  Ubudehe 
categories 1 and 2. The Farmer Field School (FFS) approach will be implemented by ENABEL at 
national  level,  but  for  12,000  households  selected  among  the  most  market  oriented,  mostly 
from category 3 and located in areas that are more connected to the market. VBHCD will target 
the poorest households and enhance extensive production systems (backyard chicken and pig, 
small  ruminants),  in  line  with  IFAD  mandate  and  targeting  strategy,  focusing  on  local  weekly 
rural  markets  at  village  and  district  levels.  Instead,    FFS  will  focus  on  more  commercially 
oriented producers able to reach processors, butchers and consumers in urban centres.   
113.  The combination of the two complementary  approaches  offer the  opportunity to  effectively 
serve  the  different  segments  of  PRISM  target  group.  The  VBHCD  model  is  considered  more 
effective  for  the  most  vulnerable  group  because  it  focuses  not  only  on  technical  aspects  of 
livestock  production,  but  also  it  includes  modules  such  as  "accountability"    and  "sustainability 
and  self-reliance"  to  facilitate  the  necessary  behavioral  change  among  smallholder  farmers  in 
order for them (i) to pull themselves out of poverty and (ii) to produce surplus products for the 
market.  On  the  other  hand,  the  FFS  approach  is  better  suited  for  more  market-oriented 
farmers..  Thus,  the  two  approaches  differs  in  a  way  that  the  VBHCD  offers  a  graduation  path 
out  of  poverty  and  access  markets  for  resource-poor  smallholder  farmers  whereas  the  FFS  is 
meant to enhance or fill the gaps of knowledge for more advanced farmers.     
114.  The  programme  coordination  team,  and  the  Technical  Coordination  Committee  will  provide 
coordination, exchange of experiences, alignment to national policies, etc. 
Sub-component 1.2: Improve animal health status and genetic potential of small 
livestock  (to be implemented jointly by IFAD and ENABEL)  
115.  Setup  of  Community  Based  Animal  Health  Systems:  In  the  Districts  where 
communities  benefit  from  the  graduation  pathway/VBHCD  (SC  1.1)  Community  Agro-Vet 
entrepreneurs  (CAVE)  will  be  identified,  trained  and  deployed  to  support  animal  well-being 
across  all  targeted  value  chains.  With  knowledge  in  basic  preventive  and  animal  health  care, 
18 
Partnership for Resilient and Inclusive Small Livestock Markets 
PRISM 
Project Design Report (PDR) 
CAVEs  provide  services  to  the  community  under  the  supervision  of  qualified  government 
veterinary  staff.  They  will  be  equipped  with  animal  well-being  starter  kits.  In  order  to  further 
improve access to veterinary healthcare, every beneficiary of the graduation pathway (SC 1.1) 
will be sensitized to contribute towards an animal health insurance scheme.  In this scheme,  a 
famer  contributes  an  annual  fee  and  pays  half  the  price  of  vet  drugs  prescribed  by  qualified 
veterinary technician. With the establishment of this scheme, treatments are made available at 
reduced costs, on a sustainable way. 
116.  Under the ENABEL-led interventions, Veterinaries without Borders Belgium (VSFB) will train 
and  support  development  of  private  veterinary  technicians  and  veterinary  doctors.  These 
veterinary  practitioners  will  have  an  academic  level  and  will  address  the  needs  of  the  more 
commercially oriented farmers, at national level. In addition, they will  be supported to enter in 
"business" relations with the CAVEs trained by Heifer, creating the development of a network of 
mutually reinforcing private players operating under the supervision and guidance of the public 
veterinary service system.    
IFAD and ENABEL complementary approaches on animal health 
Public  veterinary  services  and  veterinary  public  health  issues  will  be  promoted  under  IFAD 
supported  interventions,  only.  For  private  veterinary  services,  the  approaches  deployed  by  Heifer 
(Community  Agro-Vet  entrepreneurs  -  CAVE)  and  by  VSBF  (support  to  networks  of  veterinary 
technicians)  are  complementary  as  they  aim  at  providing  private  services  to  a  different  target 
group i.e. CAVE will operate at village level serving Ubedehe 1-2 mainly, while VSFB will work with 
private  service  providers  addressing  primarily  the  needs  of  Ubudehe  3  producers.  The  two 
approaches  will  allow  to  effectively  serve  the  different  segments  of  the  target  group  with 
sustainable  and  tailored  services.  The  coordination  between  public  and  private  veterinary  sectors 
will also be strengthened as part of the foreseen review of the veterinary legislation in Component 
3.  It  is  also  important  to  mention  that  IFAD  is  already  contributing  to  strengthen  the  National 
health provision services through RDDP. 
117.  Support Production and Dissemination of Improved Breeding Stock: in this domain, 
the  IFAD-supported  interventions  will  address  the  needs  of  the  backyard  poultry  and  small 
ruminants  sectors,  and  ENABEL  those  of  the  commercial  pig  and  poultry  sectors.  For  small 
ruminants, PRISM will provide support to the existing RAB goat breeding station, to enable it 
to  import  new  breeding  stock,  and  to  facilitate  dissemination  of  crossed  offspring  into  the 
programme area. For backyard poultry, PRISM will provide support to RAB to source selected 
breeds  and  strains  of  chicken  and  multiply  them  through  the  specialized  young  hatchers 
established  under  sub-component  1.2.  To  identify  the  most  adequate  breeds  and  strains,  the 
programme  will  support  the  participation  of  RAB  in  the  “African  Chicken  Genetic  Gain45” 
programme  implemented  by  the  International  Livestock  Research  Institute  (ILRI)  and  funded 
by  the  Bill  and  Melinda  Gates  Foundation.  Small  ruminants  and  backyard  poultry  distributed 
under this activity will benefit in priority to VBHCD beneficiaries through the “Pass on the Gift” 
programme.  For  pig  and  commercial  poultry  (broilers  and  layers),  PRISM  will  support  the 
creation  of  development  of  pig  breeding  centers,  hatcheries  and  pullet  producers  through  the 
provision  of  capacity  building,  business  development  services  and  capital  strengthening.  The 
programme  will  ensure  that  these  service  providers  are  providing  breeding  stock  to  all 
programme beneficiaries including those supported under the IFAD interventions. 
118.  Support Surveillance and Control of Small Livestock Diseases: In order to reduce the 
risk  of  introduction  of  TADs,  the  programme  will  strengthen  the  epidemio-surveillance 
capacities  of  veterinary  services,  with  a  particular  focus  on  small  livestock  TADs  that  are 
45 https://africacgg.net/ 
19 
Partnership for Resilient and Inclusive Small Livestock Markets 
PRISM 
Project Design Report (PDR) 
endemic  in  the  region  but  not  present  in  the  country46.  PRISM  will  improve  surveillance 
capacities for these diseases by providing support and capacity building to  districts to mobilize 
communities  to  enable  them  to  participate  actively  in  passive  surveillance  networks,  and  to 
establish  information  circuits  through  efficient  communication  chains  and  designated  focal 
points  (including  CAVEs  and  private  veterinarians).  The  programme  will  also  complement  the 
support provided by RDDP to RAB for the upgrading of the central veterinary laboratory and of 
the  satellite  laboratories  by  providing  specific  equipment  and  kits  for  the  detection  of  small 
livestock diseases. 
119.  Development  of  contingency  plans  and  establishment  of  a  contingency  fund  for 
small ruminants diseases:  In order to mitigate the risk of sanitary crisis that could ruin all 
development  efforts  and  investments  in  the  value  chains,  PRISM  will  support  the  public 
veterinary  services  to  prepare  responses  to  sanitary  crises,  in  particular  for  crises  related  to 
TADs  or  zoonotic  diseases.  In  order  to  test  these  plans  and  prepare  their  deployment, 
simulation exercises will be organized. The programme will also establish a disease contingency 
fund. In case of an eligible sanitary crisis, the  GoR may use part or all these funds to finance 
emergency response, in line with the pre-identified and mutually agreed operational guidelines 
and criteria for eligibility. If the primary allocation is not sufficient, the GoR may also request to 
reallocate  resources  from  the  unallocated  expenditure  category  if  they  are  still  available. 
Detailed operational guidelines, criteria for eligibility of the crisis will be developed to guide the 
utilization  of  the  funds.  Should  this  activity  be  triggered,  all  expenditures  will  be  made  in 
accordance  with  IFAD  procurement  rules  applicable  to  emergency  situations.  An  exit  strategy 
and  sustainability  plan  will  be  developed  at  the  beginning  of  the  activity  to  ensure  the 
sustainability  of  the  fund  beyond  the  programme  lifetime.  This  activity  will  be  implemented 
jointly and co-financed by IFAD and ENABEL. 
Sub-component 1.3: Support climate smart innovations in production (to be implemented 
by IFAD) 
120. 
In  order  to  mitigate  potential  negative  impacts  of  the  intensification  of  small  livestock 
production,  the  programme  will  promote  several  activities  for  mainstreaming  environmental 
management and climate change adaptation and mitigation including: 
  promotion  of  agroforestry,  including  the  setup  of  nurseries  with  self-formed  and  youth 
groups,    for  dissemination  of  fodder  trees  and  shrubs  species  that  can  be  used  in  animal 
feeding; this will be done in parallel under the VBHCD approach and the FFS. 
  manure management through adoption of biogas systems and composting. This activity will 
benefit  to  smallholder  commercial  farmers  supported  by  both  partners  and  will  be  co-
financed and implemented jointly with ENABEL, through VSFB as implementing partner. The 
programme  will  promote  the  both  the  installation  of  flexible  biogas  systems  which  are  low 
cost, easy to install and adapted to small scale farming, and fixed dome systems, which are 
more  durable.  At  household  level,  under  the  graduation  pathway  and  the  FFS,  the 
programme will promote manure composting. 
improved water efficiency through rainwater harvesting facilities installed at farm level with

Component 2: Support to Small Livestock Value Chain Development 
121.  This component will strive to strengthen the organizational and entrepreneurial skills of the 
programme  beneficiaries  and  improve  their  backward  and  forward  linkages  to  access  input, 
service  and  output  markets.  Different  investments  will  support  this  objective,  including  (i) 
support  to  the  development  of  a  local  feed  industry  (ii)  soft  support  (facilitating  “productive 
alliances”,  raising  the  appetite  of  financial  institutions  to  serve  these  specific  value  chains, 
promoting  multi-stakeholder  fora),  and  (iii) investments  in  public  and private  infrastructure  to 
raise the compliance with food safety and animal welfare standards and reduce environmental 
externalities. 
122.  Support to animal feed industry : this set of activities will be led and funded by ENABEL48, 
and will aim at supporting the emergence of a national feed industry based as much as possible 
on  quality  locally  produced  raw  materials  (maize  and  soya),  in  order  the  reduce  the  country 
dependency  on  imports,  which  weakens  the  poultry  and  pig  value  chains.  Through  the 
implementation  of  FFS,  the  programme  will  develop  profitable,  resilient  and  sustainable  soya 
and maize farms which run their farms as business with sustainable links to input suppliers and 
buyers.  It  will  also  develop  a  reliable  and  sustainable  supply  system  of  locally  produced  soya 
bean for feed companies through the out-grower company model and will provide a tailor-made 
technical support and business development support for feed companies. Finally, it will set up a 
feed industry research fund to support innovative research, in particular on technologies aiming 
at incorporating more local ingredients in feed formulas. 
Sub-Component 2.1: Productive Alliances with Input Suppliers and support to 
entrepreneurship in production (to be implemented jointly, but with IFAD intervention 
supporting smallholder farmers including youth, and ENABEL focusing on support to larger industry 
players) 
123.  Productive  alliances49  will  be  sought  in  the  poultry  and  pig  value  chains,  building  on 
arrangements  that  are  already  often  used  by  Rwandan  animal  feed  manufacturers  to  expand 
their  customer  outreach.  Under  these  alliances,  the  programme  aims  to  support  525  broiler 
farmers, 450 layer farmers, and 450 pig fatteners. While the support to productive alliances  in 
broiler and layer farming is foreseen to cover all  15 target districts, the productive alliances in 
pig raising will concentrate on the districts that are natural production basins. The  participants 
to  these  productive  alliances  will  typically  belong  to  Ubudehe  categories  2  and  3,  already 
engaged in an entrepreneurial logic and  with the capacity to contribute to the  start-up capital 
investment. The programme will select the private sector partners, support them to identify the 
participating smallholders, and facilitate the preparation of contracts. 
124. 
In the three models, the feed manufacturer will concurrently play the role of input supplier 
and  technical  service  provider.  The  programme  will  complement  the  technical  advice  provided 
directly by the partners with business development services. For each alliance, the  programme 
will  contribute  to  the  tune  of  30%  in  the  investment  capital  that  will  consist  of  a  package  of 
building, equipment and start-up stock of 100 broilers, or 500 layers, or 10 piglets, depending 
on  the  productive  alliance.  The  beneficiary  will  provide  the  remaining  part  of  the  investment, 
either in cash or through a bank loan. This activity will be implemented in partnership and co-
funded  by  ENABEL50  which  will  finance  the  30%  contribution  of  the  investment  capital.  In 
48 ENABEL sub- component 2.0: The feed industry supplies affordable and quality feed, which includes locally sourced 
ingredients  
49 A productive alliance is a contractual arrangement whereby farmers enter into an agreement with either an input 
supplier, an aggregator or a service provider, who guarantees access to inputs, market or services to the farmers on 
mutually agreed conditions. 
50 ENABEL activity 1.2.4 Access to finance for livestock farmers

addition  to  the  smallholder  commercial  producers  supported  under  this  activity,  ENABEL51  will 
also provide business development support, including investment capital support, to large scale 
industrial farmers. However, financing modalities including % of matching grant will be similar 
for the two sources of financing. 
125.  Support  to  Youth  Entrepreneurship  in  Production:  The  programme  will  target 
unemployed rural youth who are willing to start small livestock production enterprises and will 
assist  them  in  establishing  viable  and  profitable  production  units  and  enter  in  the  productive 
alliance  arrangements.  However,  the  support  package  for  youth  will  be  different  from  other 
ordinary productive alliance beneficiaries, in order to compensate their absence of experience, 
land and capital.  The programme will build on the approach already implemented by MINAGRI 
in the scope of the “small livestock for youth programme” and will support groups of ten youth 
on  average,  located  on  the  same  site  but  with  independent  production  units.  The  support 
package  will  include  initial  intensive  technical  and  business  management  support,  continuous 
tutoring  through  business  coaches,  provision  of  start-up  capital  for  investment  and  initial 
working capital, and linkages to financial service providers for co-financing of investments. 
126.  1,530  young  people  in  total  will  be  targeted  through  PRISM  (100  per  targeted  District  in 
average).  The  programme  will  give  priority  to  young  people  aged  between  16  and  30  years, 
with  low  level  of  education  (without  or  up  to  secondary  education)  and  TVET  graduates. 
Specifically, the programme will support the creation of 450 pig fattening units, 50 pig breeding 
units, 500 broiler production units and 500 layer units, 15 pilot hatcheries and production units 
of pullets and cockerels for backyard chicken production, and 15 goat breeding units. 
127.  The  beneficiaries  will  undergo  an  initial  training  curriculum  addressing  both  the  technical 
aspects and the business and financial management aspects. The training will be organized and 
provided  by  private  Business  Development  Service  Providers  assisted  by  District  Staff.  The 
start-up  package  for  each  beneficiary  will  be  composed  of  the  followings:  (i)  Construction  of 
premises;  (ii)  Small  equipment  (feeders,  drinkers,  tools);  (iii)  Land  will  be  provided  by  local 
authorities;  and  (iv)  Start-up  animal  stock  and  inputs  for  the  first  six  months  including  a 
veterinary  package.  The  youth  financing  package  will  include  a  grant  representing  maximum 
70% of the cash needs to start the enterprise, the residual amount of 30% being financed by a 
loan from a financial institution. The grants will be managed by BDF.  
Sub-Component 2.2: Market Facilitation in Small Livestock Value Chains (to be 
implemented jointly, with IFAD focusing on public market infrastructures, and ENABEL on private 
ones) 
128.  Market appraisal: PRISM will undertake several market appraisal studies in order to fill the 
gap on market demand and opportunities, and guide programme investments. An assessment 
of the pig and poultry (egg and meat) markets will be conducted before the  programme start-
up  under  a  DFID  funded  programme,  but  for  the  benefit  of  PRISM.  The  outcome  will  be 
available  before  the  end  of  2019  and  will  be  a  critical  decision-making  tool,  in  particular  for 
selecting  the  Districts  of  interventions,  private  sector  partners  and  sites  for  market  access 
public investments. However, since this study will only cover pig and poultry value chains, there 
will be a need to undertake a similar exercise for small ruminants during the inception phase of 
PRISM.  A  provision  has  been  made  under  the  ENABEL  financing  to  cater  for  the  needs  for 
further studies  on market and investment  opportunities (including for  selecting the location of 
abattoirs and markets to be funded under the programme) during the programme cycle.

22 
Partnership for Resilient and Inclusive Small Livestock Markets

Project Design Report (PDR) 
129.  Market  facilitation  in  small  livestock  value  chains  will  be  done  at  three  levels:  (i) 
assistance  to  off-takers  for  supplier  network  development;  (ii)  support  to  public  good  related 
investments  in  essential  equipment;  and  (iii)  support  to  small livestock  multi-stakeholder  fora 
at regional and national level.  
130.  To  complement  the  proximity  extension,  coaching  and  business  development  services 
foreseen  under  component  1  and  sub-component  2.1,  BDSPs  will  be  recruited  for  market 
facilitation. Specific tasks will be to engage the producers with other actors of the value chains, 
typically the traders operating at farmgate and market level, the processors, the abattoirs, and 
the  final  off-takers.  The  role  of  these  BDSPs  will  thus  be  the  one  of  a  match-maker,  able  to 
identify the demand and propose adequate products and services along win-win arrangements. 
BDSPs  will  serve  beneficiaries  of  both  IFAD  and  ENABEL  supported  interventions  and  will  be 
financed on ENABEL budget. 
131.  PRISM will support private operators of abattoirs and processing units to launch public good 
related  investments52  in  essential  equipment.  The  first  step  will  be  to  help  them  develop  a 
sound business plan that will back their  eligibility to  access grants and enable them to access 
loans from Participating Financial Institutions (PFIs) if necessary. Once their business plans are 
developed, the private processors/slaughterers will be able to apply for PRISM matching grants. 
This support must be viewed as an incentive to upgrade processing facilities in a context where 
private companies would otherwise prefer to secure their cashflow and not allocate their limited 
investment capital to ‘unproductive’ assets. Eligible investments will be limited to (i) equipment 
meant  to  improve  and  comply  with  national  and  international  standards  on  food  safety  and 
animal  welfare53  and  (ii)  climate-smart  upgrading  of  their  facilities54.  For  the  first  group  of 
investments, the programme will provide a 30% matching grant, with a ceiling of USD 30,000. 
For  the  second  group,  the  programme  will  provide  a  67%  grant  (2/3)  with  a  ceiling  of  USD 
10,000.  Both  types  of  grants  are  conditional  upon  the  sourcing  of  products  from  direct 
programme beneficiaries. Both the development of business plans and the matching grants will 
be entirely co-financed by ENABEL. 
132.  The  programme  will  support  the  development  of  centres  of  excellence  in  pig  and  poultry 
value  chains.  These  will  be  large  scale  production  units  that  also  provide  training  services, 
coaching and mentoring, business development services such as formulation of business plans 
or feasibility studies, in parallel to the provision of inputs such as DOC, pullets, piglets. Some 
embryos of such centers of excellence already exist in the country and the concept is promising 
and deserves to be scaled up. This activity will be led and financed by ENABEL.  
133.  The  programme  also  foresees  either  the  building  or  the  rehabilitation  of  five  pig  slaughter 
slabs, to respond to the crucial lack of pig slaughtering facilities in Rwanda.  Such facilities are 
essential to enable pig producers to shift from farmgate sales of live animals to value addition 
through  the  proceeds  of  pork  meat.  Prior  Environment  and  Social  Impact  Assessment  (ESIA) 
studies will be undertaken and the programme foresees an average budget of USD 100,000 per 
slab,  to  be  complemented  by  a  maximum  of  USD  25,000  to  support  investments  in  bio-
digesters and solar energy. Out of the 64 district markets existing in PRISM target regions,  10 
will be selected for rehabilitation (ideally one per target district), based on the outcomes of the 
market  assessment  and  investment  opportunities  studies.  The  infrastructure  will  be  owned  by 
the districts, but their management will be entrusted to cooperatives or private sector operators 
52 In this case this will apply to investments contributing to improvement of food safety, environmental preservation, or 
animal welfare.

through a PPP. Public investments in both slaughter slabs and markets will be financed entirely 
by IFAD, but the feasibility studies will be co-financed by ENABEL. 
Sub-Component 2.3: Support to Financial Institutions (to be implemented jointly by IFAD 
and ENABEL, with IFAD focusing on smallholder producers and ENABEL on other larger value chain 
actors) 
134.  The  programme  will  facilitate  the  linkage  of  the  smallholder  farmers  under  productive 
alliances with the financial sector, to finance investments and working capital. It will also  help 
link vulnerable households under the graduation pathway under component 1 to access formal 
financial  services,  and  youth  supported  under  component  1  to  financial  institutions  for  the 
financing of the start-up and further development of their business. This will result in a total of 
11,750  households  accessing  formal  financial  services,  including  1,425  smallholder  farmers 
engaged in productive alliances, 1,500 members of youth small livestock production enterprises 
and 8,000 vulnerable households55. 
135.  For smallholder farmers supported under the productive alliance model, PRISM will support 
private  feed  manufacturers  and  off-takers  having  developed  or  in  the  process  of  developing 
productive  alliances  with  farmers  to  identify  and  negotiate  with  financial  institutions  for  the 
financing  of  the  farmers  and  provide  customized  technical  assistance  to  these  institutions. 
Technical  assistance  (TA)  will  be  provided  in  close  consultation  with  the  private  company,  for 
the  development  of  adapted  and  affordable  financial  products  and  secured  delivery  channels 
building  on  the  business  model  of  the  company  and  its  linkages  with  the  farmers.  It  will  also 
include  training  of  the  financial  institution  agents  on  the  farmers  enterprises.  Priority  will  be 
given  to  commercial  banks  and  MFIs  that  have  already  set  up  an  agricultural  finance  unit. 
Technical support to banks and MFIs will be provided by a partner  or  a service provider.  ICCO 
Terrafina, which has an established experience of supporting MFIs and banks in Rwanda with a 
specific  focus  on  rural  and  agricultural  finance  has  expressed  an  interest  in  partnering  with 
PRISM. 
136.  For  linkages  with  other  beneficiaries,  PRISM  will  organize  training  for  interested  financial 
institutions aiming at raising their appetite for small livestock value chains and supporting them 
to  design  or  refine  affordable,  appropriate  products  and  delivery  channels  for  different 
categories  of  beneficiaries.  It  will  include  presentation  of  value  chains  mapping  and  analysis 
with  focus  on  financial  needs,  risks  and  mitigation  strategies,  recommended  product  features 
and  delivery  channels.  It  will  also  include  technical  training  on  production  and  enterprise 
business models for targeted small livestock sub-sectors to enable financial institutions agents 
to  do  a  proper  appraisal  and  monitoring  of  loans.  The  programme  will  then  organize  fora  to 
facilitate  linkages  between  farmers,  value  chain  actors  and  financial  institutions,  who  have 
designed  adapted  products  following  training  by  the  programme.  Insurers  who  have  been 
supported  by  the  programme  to  design  small  livestock  insurance  products,  and  value  chain 
actors like input suppliers and off-takers will also be invited.  
137.  For both approaches, it is expected that a total of 210 financial institutions will be supported 
(5 commercial banks, 5 MFIs and 200 SACCOs). 
138.  The project will also support innovations with a focus on (i) digitalization of transactions and 
operations,  and  (ii)  development  of  small  livestock  insurance  products.  The  rationale  is  that 
both of these tools can help reduce cost and risks for the financial institutions. Several private 
organizations  have  developed  or  are  in  the  process  of  developing  these  kind  of  digital 
innovations  for  the  agricultural  sector.  The  programme  will  support  selected  private 
organizations  on  a  cost-sharing  basis  for  the  adaptation  of  their  existing  tools  to  the 
55 Not counting households that may access finance and insurance indirectly as a result of TA provided by the Project to Financial institutions. 
24 
Partnership for Resilient and Inclusive Small Livestock Markets 
PRISM 
Project Design Report (PDR) 
specificities of the small livestock value chains.  Private organizations are targeted because they 
are likely to commercialize the innovations when proof of concept is carried out.  
139. 
 With  regards  to  insurance  for  small  livestock,  there  are  currently  two  new  insurance 
products for poultry, and one  on the horizon for pigs.  Whilst this is encouraging, they are not 
currently  adapted  to  or  available  for  the  programme  target  groups.  These  are  the  two  value 
chains  most  suitable  for  and  of  interest  to  commercial  insurance.  To  support  better  access  to 
other  financial  services  for  the  programme  target  group(s)  engaged  in  poultry  and/or  pig 
farming,  research  will  be  carried  out  into  these  value  chain  risks  and  insurance  feasibility  for 
the  target  groups.  This  will  help  underpin  technical  assistance  to  two  new  product  designs  – 
carried out on a cost-share basis, and also inform training of members of the Rwanda Insurers’ 
Association.  As  a  result  of  these  activities,  at  least  five  insurers  will  receive  support  from  the 
programme. Although pilot testing and roll-out of these innovations are not directly financed by 
the programme, as much as is possible any operations as a result of programme TA will involve 
financial  institutions  that  the  Programme  has  linked  with  its  beneficiaries  (e.g.  MFIs  providing 
productive loans). This activity will be implemented jointly with, and co-financed by ENABEL. 
3. 
Component 3: Policy support and coordination 
140. 
 All activities related to the formulation  of policies and strategies, the development, review 
and enforcement of legislation and standards will be supported and funded jointly with ENABEL. 
The support provided to the government by PRISM will build on the outcomes of an assessment 
being undertaken under a partner DFID funded programme, which aims at identifying the policy 
and  regulatory  gaps  in  the  pig  and  poultry  value  chain,  and  whose  report  will  be  available  at 
programme startup. 
Sub-component  3.1:  Policy  and  Regulatory  Support  (to  be  implemented  jointly  by  IFAD  and 
ENABEL) 
141.  Support  to  National  farmers  organizations:  Under  this  activity,  the  programme  will 
provide institutional support to existing or emerging national farmers organizations of the small 
livestock  value  chain,  to  enable  them  to  play  a  more  proactive  role  in  the  policy  dialogue 
processes..  The  executives  and  board  members  of  these  organizations  will  be  trained  on 
matters related to governance and management of their organizations, as well as on advocacy 
and  lobbying.  In  addition  to  formal  trainings,  the  programme  will  support  the  organization  of 
exchange  visits  and  study  tours,  to  enable  these  organizations  to  learn  from  sister 
organizations  in  other  countries.  The  programme  will  also  provide  support  to  the  day-to-day 
running  of  these  umbrella  organizations,  to  enable  them  to  increase  their  visibility,  their 
outreach and finally their credibility. This support will be strategically focused on activities that 
could lead to self-generation of incomes and the programme financial contribution will decrease 
over the years.  
142.  Support  to  multi-stakeholder  fora:  Once  the  actors  are  mobilized  around  programme 
intervention, small livestock multi-stakeholder fora will be set-up at both regional and national 
level  to  facilitate  the  business  relations  between  the  various  stakeholders  and  bring  their 
specific  issues/proposals  at  an  upper  level  to  have  weight  in  the  regulatory  and  policy 
discussions. The regional BDSPs will facilitate the establishment of a mechanism for forum self-
sufficiency  through  members  fees,  district  contribution,  etc.  The  programme  will  gradually 
reduce its support since it is expected that the fora will become sustainable.  
143.  Support  to  Development  of  Sector  Strategies:  The  programme  will  support  the 
formulation and updating of relevant sector strategies, including in particular the review of the 
2012-2018  small  livestock  strategy  and  investment  plan.  All  strategies  will  be  aligned  to  the 
overall  strategic  framework  pertaining  to  the  agricultural  sector  (PSTA4)  and  livestock  sector 
(LMP).    To  ensure  that  policies  and  strategies  are  developed  in  an  evidenced-based  and 
25 
Partnership for Resilient and Inclusive Small Livestock Markets 
PRISM 
Project Design Report (PDR) 
inclusive manner, the programme will provide support to MINAGRI in the following domains: (i) 
Provision  of  specialized  expertise;  (ii)  Collation  of  data  and  evidence;  and  (ii)  Support  to 
inclusive  stakeholder  consultation  processes:  the  multi-stakeholder  fora  established  in  the 
scope of component 2 will offer an excellent platform for these consultations. 
144.  Support  to  Development  and  Enforcement  of  Food  Safety  and  Animal  Welfare 
Regulatory  Framework:    the  programme  will  support  the  updating  or  formulation  and 
enforcement  of  food  safety  and  animal  welfare  regulatory  frameworks  pertaining  to  the 
targeted  value  chains.  The  support  provided  will  aim  to:  (i)  Ensure  compliance  of  national 
regulations with international standards; (ii) Improve human public health (reduce transmission 
of  food  borne  diseases  and  zoonoses)  and  veterinary  public  health;  and  (iii)  Enhance  animal 
welfare  and  reduce  unnecessary  animal  suffering  during  critical  stages  of  handling,  transport 
and slaughtering. The choice of regulations updated or formulated will be done in consultation 
with MINAGRI and other development partners. The process will be similar to the one followed 
for policies described above (expertise, data collation and consultation). 
145. 
In  addition  to  the  above-mentioned  activities,  several  complementary  activities  aiming  at 
reinforcing  the  regulatory  environment  will  be  implemented  under  the  ENABEL  supported 
interventions:  (i)  support  will  be  provided  to  RALIS  to  improve  the  delivery  of  meat  and  eggs 
certification  and  inspection  services,  (ii)  RAB  will  be  assisted  to  develop  and  animal 
identification and traceability system for pigs. 
146.  Build  Institutional  Capacities  at  National  and  District  Levels:  The  programme  will 
provide  capacity  building  support  to  RAB  to  improve  skills  of  selected  key  national  staff  on 
technical  domains  related  to  the  development  of  small  livestock  value  chains:  animal  health, 
animal  feeding,  genetics,  housing  and  livestock  infrastructures,  waste  management.  The 
trained staff will then be encouraged to play the role of trainers and train other civil servants or 
private actors at local level.  
147.  ENABEL will lead the implementation of two complementary activities contributing to further 
support  national  institutional  capacities  i.e.  the  establishment  of  a  livestock  research  fund  in 
RAB56,  that  will  address  value  chain  knowledge  gaps  that  may  arise  in  the  course  of 
implementation,  and  the  establishment  of  a  repository  data  base57  on  market  and  investment 
opportunities at RAB. 
D. 
Theory of Change 
148.  The  small  livestock  value  chains  in  Rwanda  are  still  organized  in  a  rudimentary  manner, 
which  leads  to  inadequate  access  to  market  and  services  for  farmers.  Rural  people  have 
inadequate technical capacities, limited production assets and poor access to financial services, 
and  their  level  of  productivity  is  consequently  very  low.  Slaughtering  and  processing  facilities 
are either inadequate, or non-existent, and the feed industry is penalized by the low availability 
of  raw  material  on  the  domestic  market,  and  its  dependency  on  imports.  Public  services  and 
infrastructures  are  also  insufficient.  The  combination  of  all  these  factors  results  in  a  limited 
availability  of  small  livestock  products  in  the  market,  and  therefore  low  consumption  levels. 
Vulnerable  and  food  insecure  households  are  particularly  affected  have  nutrient-low  diets  and 
protein-rich food such as ASF is rarely consumed. 
149.  PRISM  theory  of  change  (Annex  2)  is  based  on  the  hypothesis  that  vulnerable  rural 
households  women  and  youth,  who  are  empowered  with  social  and  technical  capacities,  and 
included  in  the  value  chain  will  increase  their  productivity,  nutrition  practices  and  access  to

150.  PRISM  approach  is  holistic  and  based  on  the  principle  that  the  development  of  the  value 
chain  requires  balanced  support  to  all  value  chain  segments  and  categories  of  actors.    it  is  a 
partnership programme implemented by RAB, and jointly supported by IFAD and ENABEL, with 
Heifer  International  as 
implementing  partner  and  co-financer,  and  VSF  Belgium  as 
implementing  partner  (see  figure  on  Page  12).  PRISM  is  constituted  of  two  complementary 
interventions, supported respectively by IFAD and ENABEL, whose content and strategies have 
been  aligned,  and  which  will  be  implemented  jointly  under  a  common  implementation 
mechanism.  Heifer  will  implement  activities  in  the  framework  of  the  IFAD  supported 
intervention,  and  VSFB  will  contribute  to  the  implementation  of  some  ENABEL  supported 
activities.  In  addition  of  being  an  implementing  partner,  Heifer  is  also  a  co-financer  of  the 
activities  its  implements  (This  is  not  the  case  of  VSFB).  RAB/SPIU  will  implement  activities 
under both interventions. 
151.  The  partnership  between  ENABEL  and  IFAD  will  allow  expanding  the  outreach  of  the 
programmeproject  to  all  VC  actors,  while  ensuring  the  mandates  and  targeting  strategies  of 
both institutions are respected (and for IFAD in particular, that smallholder farmers remain the 
primary  target  group).  The  principle  of  graduation  is  also  critical  to  the  programmeproject 
theory  of  change  and  based  on  the  assumption  that  even  the  most  vulnerable  and  fragile 
households  and  production  systems  are  able,  through  a  combination  of  social  and  economic 
support  activities,  gradually  modify  their  production  systems  and  become  more  market  and 
service  oriented.  At  production  level,  IFAD-supported  interventions  will  target  preferentially 
smallholder livestock holdings and vulnerable households, and ENABEL will engage and support 
larger  scale  commercial  and  industrial  actors.  In  terms  of  geographical  repartition,  IFAD-
supported  interventions  will  focus  on  Districts  that  are  the  most  affected  by  poverty  and 
malnutrition,  while  iIn  terms  of  value  chains,  IFAD-supported  interventions  will  target  mainly 
the  small  ruminants,  backyard  pig  and  backyard  chicken  value  chains,  that  correspond  to  its 
priority  target  groups,  when  ENABEL  will  concentrate  on  pig  and  poultry  commercial  value 
chains.  ENABEL  will  provide  support  to  large  scale  private  businesses  (feed  manufacturers, 
hatcheries, processors) in the pig and poultry value chains while IFAD-supported interventions 
will  also  support  public  investments  and  public  institutions,  in  particular  in  the  domain  of 
veterinary public health. 
152. 
In order to achieve this goal, the programme will have three inter-related components. The 
first component will target the production level and will aim both at increasing the productivity 
of  existing  livestock  systems,  and  at  increasing  their  numbers  by  installing  new  smallholder 
producers. This strategy will ultimately result in increasing the production and the availability of 
animal  source  food,  in  response  to  the  increasing  domestic  and  foreign  demand.    The  second 
component  will  support  participation  of  smallholders  in  the  small  livestock  and  animal  feed 
value  chains,  which  will  on  the  one  hand  facilitate  access  to  the  expanding  market  for  the 
additional  production,  and  on  the  other  hand  assist  farmers  in  accessing  finance  and  inputs, 
that  are  necessary  to  increase  their  production.    The  third  component,  in  addition  to 
programme  coordination,  will  support  the  improvement  of  the  institutional  and  policy 
environment, in order to ensure that the institutional environment is enabling and supportive to 
the value chain transformation. The programme will adopt an inclusive approach to ensure that 
women and rural youth will equally benefit from programme's interventions. 
153.  The  small  livestock  value  chain  development  is  also  an  important  pathway  to  increase  for 
unemployed rural young people that will engage in small livestock production enterprises. The 
27 
Partnership for Resilient and Inclusive Small Livestock Markets 
PRISM 
Project Design Report (PDR) 
programme  theory  of  change  pathway  is  built  on  two  main  assumptions:  i)  Poor  rural  people 
are willing to adopt innovative technologies and practices (also nutritional) and raise the small 
ruminants’  for  production;  and  ii)  Financial  and  private  sector  is  interested  and  willing  to 
partner  with  small  livestock  producers.  A  graphic  representation  of  the  Theory  of  Change  is 
provided in annex 2. 
E. 
Alignment, ownership, and partnerships 
1.  Alignment to National policy and strategic frameworks  
154.  PRISM’s  Development  Goal  is  fully  aligned  with  GoR’s  second  Economic  Development  and 
Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  whose  overarching  goal  is  growth  acceleration  and  poverty 
reduction58.  More  specifically,  PRISM  is  well  aligned  with  Rwanda’s  Strategic  Plan  for  the 
Transformation  of  Agriculture,  the  Government's  flagship  investment  programme  for  the 
agriculture sector. PRISM will contribute in the following ways: 
a.  To  PA1  (Innovation  and  extension)  and  PA2  (Productivity  and  resilience)  through  the 
support  provided  to  improve  animal  health  status  and  genetic  potential  of  small 
livestock  and  the  establishment  of  proximity  extension  services  (Community 
Facilitators, CAVEs, private coaches). 
b.  To  PA3  (Inclusive  markets  and  value  addition)  through  facilitation  of  backward  and 
forward linkages through productive alliances with input suppliers, enhanced marketing 
and processing infrastructure, and support to small livestock value chain financing. 
155.  To  PA4  (Enabling  environment  and  responsive  institutions)  through  support  to  develop 
sector strategies, especially food safety regulations, and the capacity building of RAB  and local 
government  authorities.  The  overarching  strategic  framework  guiding  the  development  of  the 
livestock  sector  in  Rwanda  is  the  Livestock  Master  Plan  (LMP)59.  The  priority  investment 
envisaged  in  the  LMP,  relevant  to  the  small  livestock  value  chains,  and  the  programme 
contribution  to  each  of  these  priorities,  are  as  follows:  (a)  Contributing  to  “improved  animal 
health”,  through  support  to  private  veterinary  practitioners  networks  and  public  veterinary 
services  for  surveillance  and  control  of  TADs;(b)Contributing  to  “Improving  the  quality  and 
quantity  of  feed”  through  capacity  building  of  producers,  promotion  of  forage  trees  and  other 
fodder varieties for small ruminants, support to feed manufacturers and facilitation of business 
partnerships  between  producers  and  feed  millers;  and  (c)Enhancing/upgrading  the  marketing 
and processing facilities for meat and eggs, including the cold chain. 
156. 
 Moreover,  the  programme’s  incentives  to  introduce  climate-smart  technologies  in  small 
livestock infrastructure meets the targets of the National Strategy on Climate Change and Low-
Carbon Development (NCCLCD), particularly to achieve Category 2 energy security and support 
the development of green industry and services.  
157.  The  graduation  pathway  foreseen  in  Component  1  is  fully  aligned  with  the  strong 
commitment of the National Food and Nutrition Policy (NF&NP) to solving food and malnutrition 
and  preventing  stunting  in  children  under  two  years  old.  This  comprehensive  intervention, 
complemented by the specific support to youth entrepreneurship, responds well to the Rwanda 
58 The EDPRS 2 aims to raise GDP per capita to USD 1,000; reduce the percentage of the population living below the poverty 
line to less than 30%; and reduce the percentage of the population living in extreme poverty to less than 9%. 
59 The LMP was developed in 2017, following the implementation of a Livestock Sector Analysis (LSA) 2017. The LMP covers 
a five-year period (2017-2022) and comprises of six sub-sectorial master plans for dairy, red meat, chicken and pork. For 
small  livestock  specifically,  a strategy  and  investment  plan  for  small  animal  industry  was  developed  in  2012 but  has now 
expired and would require a review and update. 
28 
Partnership for Resilient and Inclusive Small Livestock Markets 
PRISM 
Project Design Report (PDR) 
Youth  Strategic  Plan,  the  National  Gender  Policy,  and  in  particular  the  Agriculture  Gender 
Strategy aiming to address the challenges faced by women and youth through a comprehensive 
joint approach. 
158.  Alignment  to  IFAD  strategic  objectives:  The  programme  will  directly  contribute  to  the  two 
COSOP  SOs.  To  SO1  “sustainably  increase  agricultural  productivity  in  priority  food  and  export 
value  chains  and  improve  livelihoods  and  resilience  of  the  rural  population”  through  activities 
aiming  at  intensifying  small  livestock  production  and  strengthening  their  resilience  against 
sanitary,  climatic  or  economic  shocks.  It  will  also  contribute  to  SO2  “improve  post-harvest 
processes,  strengthen  market  linkages  and  generate  economic  opportunities  for  men,  women 
and youth in rural areas” through promotion of partnership mechanisms improving the inclusion 
of smallholders in the value chains. 
159.  Partnerships: In addition to its unique internal partnership arrangements, PRISM will also 
strive  to  avoid  duplication  and  ensure  harmonization  and  complementarity  with  other  projects 
and  programmes.  Strong  opportunities  for  synergies  have  been  identified  with  the  Feed  the 
Future  Rwanda/  USAID  funded  project  "Orora  Wihaze"  which  will  sustainably  increase  the 
availability of, access to, and consumption of animal-source  foods (ASF) through development 
of a profitable market.  
F.  Costs, benefits and financing 
1.  Programme costs 
160.  The  total  PRISM  investment  and  incremental  recurrent  costs,  including  physical  and  price 
contingencies,  are  estimated  at  USD  45.64  million  (RWF  41.07  billion).  The  table  below 
presents a table with the breakdown of the costs by components. The investment in Component 
1(Climate-smart intensification of small production systems) in base costs stands at USD 20.65 
million  (42%  of  total  base  costs);  Component  2  (Support  to  small  livestock  value  chain 
development) in base costs totals USD 19.40 million (29% of total base costs) and Component 
3 (Policy and regulatory support and Coordination) in base costs amounts to USD 5.59 million 
(11% of base costs), of which Programme Coordination accounts for USD 2.79 million (6.1% of 
total  base  costs).  In  addition  to  the  total  base  costs  of  USD  45.38  million,  price  and  physical 
contingencies amounting to USD 0.26 million have been provided for. The input currency in cost 
tables was set as USD minimizing the effect of local inflation.

168.  As ENABEL funded interventions will target more commercially mature producers and larger 
value  chain  actors,  IFAD  funded  interventions  will  focus  on  smallholder  farmers,  vulnerable 
households and youth groups. Combining 100% of IFAD's and Heifer's funding, relevant portion 
of  ENABEL's  funding  and  part  of  contributions  by  beneficiaries,  approximately  US$21  million 
(45%) of the total project cost will be used to support the most vulnerable households.  
3.  Disbursement 
169.  Nature of programme eligible expenditures - PRISM expenditure categories have been 
in  accordance  with  the  standard  Flexcube  expenditure  categories.  Eligible 
allocated 
expenditures  include  the  following  expenditure  categories:  (i)  Works,  (ii)  Vehicles,  (iii) 
Equipment and Materials, (iv) Goods, services and inputs, (v) Credit and guarantee funds, (vi) 
Consultancies (vii) Training, (viii) Salaries & operating costs. Detailed cost tables are presented 
in  Annex  4  .  Transaction-based  disbursement  procedures  will  be  used.  Other  methods  of 
disbursement will include direct payments, special commitments, and reimbursements. Details 
concerning disbursement methods will be detailed out in the letter to the borrower, and IFAD’s 
disbursement  handbook.  The  Fund  will  provide  an  initial  advance  with  a  ceiling  equivalent  to 
expenditure for the first six-months of the AWPB. Subsequently, the implementing entities will 
submit  their  Statements  of  Expenditures  (SoE)  and  the  Fund  will  process  the  withdrawal 
applications and deposit funds into the designated account.

Summary of financial and economic analysis 
170.  Financial  Analysis:  Ten  enterprise  models  have  been  used  to  estimate  the  increase  in 
incomes  at  household  level  as  a  result  of  proposed  programme  investment.  These  have  been 
arranged  by  category  of  beneficiaries  as  follows:  (i)  Vulnerable  households  undergoing  the 
graduation  pathway;  (ii)  Youth  and  (iii)  Productive  Alliance  beneficiaries.  All  the  models  show 
positive returns as shown in the tables below.

Project Design Report (PDR) 
171.  PRISM will support 26,355 households (115,962 individuals) as follows:  
172.  Economic  analysis:  The  overall  Economic  Internal  Rate  of  Return  (EIRR)  of  the 
Programme  is  estimated  at  26%  (base  case)  which is  above  the  opportunity  cost  of  capital in 
Rwanda estimated at 9.5% based on long term bonds rates of returns, indicating the economic 
convenience  of  the  Programme.  This  is  after  factoring  prudent  mortality  rates  and  own

173.  A  sensitivity  analysis  was  carried  out  to  assess  the  likely  impact  of  a  variation  of  some 
key  factors  on  the  economic  return  of  the  programme.  It  indicates  a  strong  resilience  to 
increases  of  costs  and  reductions  of  benefits  which  mirror  the  PRISM  risk  profile.  The 
programme would still yield an EIRR of respectively 25% and 24% if benefits were reduced by 
10%  and  20%.  In  the  extreme  case  of  benefits  being  reduced  by  50%,  the  EIRR  would 
establish at 17%, a value above the social discount rate.  
174.  Additional  benefits:  In  addition  to  benefits  perceived  by  the  26,355  programme 
beneficiaries, the broader rural community in the 3 targeted regions (apprx. 1.5 M people) will 
also  indirectly  benefit  from  the  programme’s  animal  health  and  improved  husbandry 
interventions, which has not been quantified in the EFA.

Exit Strategy and Sustainability 
175.  A draft exit strategy is detailed in Annex 10. In order to take account of lessons learned on 
what  works  and  what  does  not,  the  Programme’s  Exit  Strategy  will  be  further  refined  in  the 
course of the Programme, while gradually shifting focus from sustaining programme benefits to 
scaling-up and scaling-out those benefits. The sustainability of the programme outcomes relies 
on  its  overall  approach  which  is  based  in  particular  on  the  facilitation  of  partnerships,  social 
mobilization  and  group  formation,  transfer  of  competences,  institutional  strengthening  and 
durable financing, as further outlined below: 
176.  Public institutions will be supported to deliver their mandate in a more efficient and focused 
manner,  through  policy  support  and  capacity  building.  The  policy  support  provided  to  the 
Ministry of Agriculture will enable it to plan for the development of the sector in the long-term, 
and the targeted capacity building of staff will enable it to implement those plans. The support 
provided to stakeholders’ umbrella organizations will prioritize the development of mechanisms 
and  activities  that  could  contribute  to  capacity  building,  income  generation  and  thus 
sustainability. 
177.  The  financing  mechanisms  put  in  place  in  the  scope  of  the  programme  will  privilege 
sustainability and will be based as a priority on existing and permanent financing mechanisms, 
either private or governmental. The programme will as much as possible avoid direct financing 
of  investments  and  will  privilege  activities  aiming  at  reconciling  the  demand  in  financial 
products  and  the  supply.  Financial  institutions  will  be  supported  to  develop  adapted  financial 
services  for  small  livestock  value  chains  farmers  and  other  private  actors,  that  they  are 
expected to sustain and scale up after closure of the Programme. 
178.  The  programme  will  promote  production  systems  that  are  suitable  to  local  agro-ecological 
zones  and  climatic  conditions.  Environmental  efficiency  and  climate  adaptation  and  mitigation 
of the selected value chains will be enhanced through the promotion of locally produced  fodder 
and feed, the recycling of farm waste as well as the utilization of renewable sources of energy. 
IV. 
 Risks 
A. 
Programme Risks and mitigation measures 
179.  A  detailed  integrated  risk  framework  (IRF),  is  presented  in  Annex  14Annex  14,  with  the 
financial  risks  reviewed  in  detail  in  Section  A.1.2.  Financial  management.  Identified  risks  are 
either addressed in the programme design through a mitigation measure, or are externalized as 
Logical  Framework  indicators  (see  Annex  1),  which  (i)  are  expected  to  hold,  and  (ii)  will  be 
monitored during implementation so that additional mitigation measures may be taken if needs 
be. Some risks are reflected in a mitigation measure and as a Logical Framework assumption.  
180.  The overall risk profile is low to medium, including for financial and procurement risks which 
are  considered  as  medium.  The  most  important  risks  in  terms  of  potential  impact  for  the 
programme are:

to  reducing  any  harmful  act  based  on  gender  through:  (i)  sensitization  on  the  importance  of 
addressing  GBV,  application  of  IFAD's  no  tolerance  for  Sexual  Harassment  (SH)  /Sexual

communities; (iii) have GBV risks adequately reflected in all safeguards instruments, contracts 
with suppliers and and other third parties to be funded with IFAD funds.  
B. 
Environment and Social category 
182.  The  programme  is  considered  to  be  an  Environment  and  Social  category  B.  The 
programme  is  not  expected  to  have  significant  adverse  environmental  or  social  implications 
because of the nature of the small livestock systems that will be promoted by the programme.  
183.  The  monogastric  systems  (pig  and  poultry)  are  mostly  based  on  the  utilization  of 
concentrate  feed,  produced  mainly  from  maize  and  soya,  that  are  produced  in  family  farming 
systems  in  the  country  and  the  region,  and  which  do  not  have  major  environmental  impacts. 
Besides, because of the limited dimension of the pig and poultry production units supported by 
the programmes, the valorization of waste in the crops fields of the farmer will be easy and will 
help  in  restoring  soil  fertility  without  leading  to  pollution.  Finally,  the  will  support  the  biogas 
technology for pigs, that will increase the value of manure and limit its environmental impact. 
184.  The  small  ruminants  systems  promoted  by  the  programme  under  the  Heifer  graduation 
pathway,  will  have  a  very  limited  scale  (less  than  5  animals  per  family)  and  will  be  based  on 
zero  grazing  production  itineraries,  which  is  a  common  practice  in  Rwanda.  Zero  grazing 
increases  the  production  of  manure,  hence  contributing  to  improving  fertility  and  combatting 
erosion, and it also prevents the animals from damaging the  vegetal cover when grazing. The 
programme  will  also  promote  the  use  of  agroforestry  techniques  for  the  small  ruminant 
farmers,  in  order  to  produce  quality  feed  in  a  way  that  do  not  impinge  on  the  family  food 
production,  and  that  at  the  same  time  preserves  fertility  and  combats  erosion.  Finally,  the 
programme  will  attenuate  the  negative  impact  of  small  livestock  on  water  resources  by 
promoting affordable and durable water harvesting technologies. 
185.  The  respective  environmental  impact  of  each  small  livestock  farming  system  is  further 
detailed in the Annex 5 on Social, Environment and Climate Assessment (SECAP) Review note, 
and  more  specifically  within  Table  2  on  Mainstreaming  environmental  management  best 
practices and climate smart along small livestock value chains as well as in the section 8 related 
to Monitoring and Evaluation.  
C. 
Climate Risk classification 
186. 
In  the  north-west  highlands  and  south-western  regions,  climate  change  is  expected  to 
increase  mean  rainfall  as  well  as  intensities  and  number  of  rainy  days61.  In  various  climate 
projections  scenarios,  northern  highlands  and  southwest  regions  will  more  likely  experience 
extreme  events  such  as  floods  and  landslides.  However,  climate  change  should  have  a  limited 
impact  on  the  small  livestock  production  systems  promoted  by  the  programme:  first  because 
monogastric  systems  mostly  rely  on  animal  feed  produced  outside  the  farm,  for  which 
alternative  sourcing  can  be  found  in  case  of  localised  weather  incident;  concerning  the  small 
ruminants,  their  resilience  to  climate  shocks  is  well  known  and  they  can  easily  accommodate 
periods of water or feed scarcity with limited impact on their productivity. Adding small stock to 
a  production  system  even  reinforces  the  resilience  of  the  small  system  to  climate  variability, 
because  they  are  typically  the  kind  of  assets  that  can  be  disposed  in  case  of  drought  to  buy 
food on the market.  
187.  The main climate related risk that could affect the  programme would be the emergence or 
re-emergence of a climate related disease, in particular a vector borne disease such as the Rift 
61 GoR, 2018. 
37 
Partnership for Resilient and Inclusive Small Livestock Markets 
PRISM 
Project Design Report (PDR) 
Valley fever or anthrax which re-emerges periodically in Rwanda after heavy rains and flooding. 
This  risk  will  be  mitigated  by  the  strengthening  of  epidemio-surveillance  systems  and  disease 
contingency  planning,  that  will  enable  rapid  and  adequate  response  in  case  of  outbreak  of 
climate sensitive disease. 
188.  Emission  intensities  for  small  livestock  are  lower  than  for  dairy  cow  and  beef  production 
systems (Globally, GHG emissions from  small ruminants represent 6.5%  of the  sector’s global 
emissions, pork represents 9%, and chicken 8%). GHG emissions will however be mitigated by 
the  installation  of  biogas  units  both  at  production  and  slaughtering/processing  level.  Because 
processing of animal products will increase energy consumption as well as production of animal 
waste,  the  programme  will  in  response  promote  energy  efficiency  through  adoption  of 
renewable energy such as biogas and solar energy. 
 Considering  the  abovementioned  elements,  the  programme's  climate  risk  classification  is 
considered moderate.  
V.  Implementation 
A. 
1. 
Organizational Framework 
Programme management and coordination 
189.  Programme  implementation:  The  partnership  programme  will  be  implemented  through 
the  Single  Project  Implementation  Unit  (SPIU),  under  Rwanda  Agriculture  and  Animal 
Resources  Development  Board62.    The  IFAD  and  ENABEL  supported  interventions  will  be 
managed by a single programme management team, co-financed by both partners, and placed 
under the coordination of the SPIU coordinator. 
190. 
 The  programme  staff,  in  charge  of  IFAD  supported  interventions,  to  be  financed  by  IFAD 
will  be  composed  of    Programme  Operations  Manager,  Livestock  Specialist,  Finance  Specialist, 
Programme Accountant, M&E Officer and Procurement Officer63 in the SPIU, to be supported by 
existing SPIU staff on the crosscutting aspects64 as well as district Programme Coordinators and 
district  Focal  Points.  The  programme  staff,  to  be  financed  by  ENABEL,  will  be  an  international 
technical  assistant,  livestock  specialist,  two  Private  sector  experts  (one  international  and  one 
local expert), one livestock Specialist, one extension Specialist, one administrator, one finance 
& procurement specialist, and one accountant. 
191.  Programme  oversight:  In-line  with  the  practice  for  other  IFAD  and  ENABEL  funded 
projects in Rwanda, a common Programme Steering Committee (PSC) will be established. The 
PSC  will  be  chaired  by  the  PS,  MINAGRI,  and  it  will  play  an  oversight  and  coordination  role, 
which  is  particularly  critical  because  of  the  specific  setup  of  the  programme.  The  main 
responsibilities of the PSC will be  to provide policy guidance and orientations at national level, 
to  assess  the  implementation  progress  of  the  programme,  to  approve  AWPB  and  progress 
reports  and  to  decide  on  corrective  measures  where  appropriate.  The  PSC  will  meet  at  least 
four times a year. Detailed Terms of Reference (ToRs) and membership of the PSC are included 
in the PIM. 
62 Rwanda Agriculture and Animal Resources Development Board is under the aegis of MINAGRI.  
63 There will be no agribusiness specialist in IFAD team since there are already two in ENABEL team, and since these aspects 
are more under the responsibility of ENABEL.  
64 Animal Health, Gender, KM and Communication, Nutrition, Climate Change and Environment, and Cooperative 
Development 
38 
Partnership for Resilient and Inclusive Small Livestock Markets 
PRISM 
Project Design Report (PDR) 
192.  There  will  also  be  a  Programme  Technical  Coordination  Committee  (PTCC),  which  will 
address  technical  and  implementation  issues,  including  those  related  to  the  coordination 
between partners and alignment between interventions will be composed of all implementation 
partners. It will be chaired by RAB. The PTTC will meet on a quarterly basis, one month ahead 
of the PSC meetings.  
193.  Partnerships:  PRISM  will  create  partnerships  with  decentralized  entities  in  order  to 
cover/finance  activities(e.g.  vaccination  campaigns,  epidemio-surveillance,  and  nutrition 
awareness  campaigns),  which  are  under  the  Districts.  Same  partnerships  will  be  created  with 
relevant  GoR  specialized  technical  agencies,  such  as  the  Rwanda  Standard  Board,  Agriculture 
and  Livestock  Inspection  and  Certification  Services,  and  Rwanda  Cooperative  Agency.  In 
particular, the programme will be engaged in a partnership with Heifer International, which will 
be  a  co-financier  and  a  key  implementing  partner.  A  global  Memorandum  of  Understanding 
(MoU) will be signed between MINAGRI and Heifer International while a detailed annual AWPB 
reflecting  activities  to  be  implemented  by  Heifer  International  and  related  costs  (including  its 
own co-financing) will be developed every fiscal year.   
2. 
Financial Management, Procurement and Governance 
a)  Procurement risk assessment.  
194.  Overarching Country Assessment: Rwanda made substantial progress in developing the 
legal  and  regulatory  framework  by  enacting  a  public  procurement  law  in  2007  (Law  No. 
12/2007 of 27/03/2007) - as revised in 2013. The decree, with the associated Regulations, also 
established  the  Rwanda  Public  Procurement  Authority  (RPPA)  as  a  regulatory  body,  replacing 
the  then  existing  National  Tender  Board  (NTB).  According  to  the  law,  the  RPPA  only  exercises 
regulatory  functions,  and  all  procurement  processes  have  been  devolved  to  government 
procuring entities (Ministries and projects). The procurement regulations require the procuring 
entities  (PEs)  to  undertake  procurement  planning  and  stipulate  the  nature  and  responsibilities 
of  the  Tender  Committee  and  who  is  eligible  to  be  in  the  tender  committee.  The  Government 
has  also  adopted  the  use  of  national  Standard  Bidding  Documents  (SBDs),  and  these  are  all 
published  on  the  RPPA  website  for  public  use.  In  addition,  RPPA  has  prepared  a  Standard 
Manual  for  Public  Procurement  (Public  Procurement  User  Guide)  for  the  benefit  of  procuring 
entities,  and  it  sets  out  all  the  public  procurement  guidelines,  procurement  methods  to  be 
applied and the thresholds.  
195.  PEFA assessment. The 2016 PEFA assessed the effectiveness of the procurement systems, 
which  was  deemed  to  be  aligned  to  international  standards  and  acceptable  to  IFAD.  The  only 
limitation relating to procurement was on ‘public access to procurement information’, which has 
now  been  addressed  with  the  ‘E-procurement’  system.  It  is  an  online  portal  and  a  point  of 
access  for  Rwanda  PEs,  allowing  the  negotiation  of  better  contractual  terms  and  to  realize 
savings  and  achieve  value  for  money.  It  enhances  transparency  and  standardization  of 
electronic  documents,  supplier  registration,  authentication  of  information  and  streamlines  all 
elements  of  public  procurement  transactions.  The  SPIU  is  now  registered  into  the  E-
procurement  system,  where  the  procurement  plan  is  uploaded,  and  all  procurement  related 
actions are posted online for interested parties to view. 
b)  Procurement arrangements.  
196.  Each of the two partners will have its own procurement and its own procurement officer unit 
in order to follow the respective requirements of ENABEL and IFAD which are different on some 
aspects. The overall procurement responsibility will be under RAB, but the Rwanda procurement 
Law  allows  for  the  delegation  of  the  procurement  function  by  the  Accounting  officer  to  a 
Procuring  Entity  (PE).  In  this  regard,  the  SPIU  is  considered  a  PE,  and  will  have  delegated 
39 
Partnership for Resilient and Inclusive Small Livestock Markets 
PRISM 
Project Design Report (PDR) 
authority  from  the  DG  RAB  (herein  referred  to  as  the  accounting  officer)  to  undertake 
procurement processes. A procurement unit exists at the current SPIU and is composed of four 
experienced  staff.  The  roles  of  the  procurement  unit  include;  Procurement  planning, 
Preparation of bidding documents, Publication and distribution of invitation to bid, Receipt and 
safe  keeping  of  bids,  and  Ensuring  adequate  contract  execution  in  collaboration  with  the 
beneficiary  department,  among  others.  The  accounting  officer  however  retains  the  roles  of 
approval  of  bid  documents,  approval  of  procurement  evaluation  reports  and  contract  award, 
sign contracts, and to appoint a contract/programme manager. 
197.  Staffing of the procurement unit. The procurement unit at the SPIU is made up of four 
experienced staff that includes a head of department and one procurement officer attached to 
every  project/programme  within  the  SPIU.  PRISM  too  will  be  required  to  recruit  two 
procurement specialists for both IFAD and ENABEL financing in order to follow their respective 
procurement guidelines which are different on some aspects. However, the procurement officer 
attached  to  IFAD-funded  PRICE  is  set  to  end  his  contract  in  June  2020  at  completion  of  the 
programme, but given the experience and coupled with the institutional memory the employee 
has, the SPIU may consider retaining the same employee to take  on the procurement role for 
PRISM. This will be done after undertaking a performance evaluation by the line manager. 
198.  Internal  Tender  Committee.  The  internal  tender  Committee  is  already  in  place. 
Appointment  of  members  to  the  Tender  Committee  is  the  responsibility  of  the  DG  RAB. 
Currently,  the  Internal  Tender  Committee  is  made  up  of  five  members:  Tea  Specialist 
(Chairperson),  Climate  and  Environment  Specialist  (Vice  Chairperson),  Access  to  Finance 
Specialist,  Market  Support  Specialist,  and  a  Procurement  Officer  (as  the  Secretary  depending 
on the programme issuing the tender). Each member of the Tender Committee has a mandate 
of three years – renewable only once. Half of the internal Tender Committee cannot have their 
membership renewed at the same time. PRISM will use the same Tender Committee. 
199.  Procurement arrangements for partners.  For financing that will be channeled through 
RAB/SPIU bank accounts, as far as possible, national procurement procedures will be applied, 
except for guidelines specific to ENABEL or IFAD e.g threshold for no objection requests and use 
of 
consideration,  however,  will  be  given 
to specialised activities  mentioned  in  the  project  document  which  will  be  co-financed  and 
implemented jointly with ENABEL, through VSFB as an implementing partner. As for funds that 
do  not  flow  through  PRISM  bank  accounts,  co-financiers  such  as  Heifer  will  apply  own 
procurement guidelines.  
thresholds.  Special 
for  given 
ICB 
c)  Financial Management.  
200.  Summary  of  Financial  Management  arrangements.  The  Borrower  and  the  lead 
programme  agency  will  be  required  to  maintain  acceptable  financial  management  systems 
including  accounting,  financial  reporting,  and  auditing  systems  for  PRISM.  A  financial 
management assessment of PRISM was carried out in accordance with IFAD’s Guidance Note on 
Undertaking  Financial  Management  Assessment  (FAM)  at  Design.  The  objective  of  FMA  is  to 
provide  assurance  that  PRISM  will  be  implemented  within  sound  financial  management 
practices  (timely  and  efficient  accounting  systems),  and  punctual  professional  reviews,  both 
internally (internal audit) and externally (external audit).  
201.  Internal  Audit.  The  internal  audit  function  exists  within  the  SPIU,  and  is  in  line  with  the 
purpose,  authority,  and  responsibility  of  the  internal  audit  activity  as  laid  down  in  the 
government Internal Audit (AI) Charter, and AI manual. A risk based internal audit action plan 
for SPIU  – IFAD funded projects/programmes (for financial year 2017/18) as approved by the 
Chairman of MINAGRI Audit Committee exists and has been fully executed.  
40 
Partnership for Resilient and Inclusive Small Livestock Markets 
PRISM 
Project Design Report (PDR) 
202.  External Audit. The current projects/programmes are all being audited by the Office of the 
Auditor General (OAG) as mandated under the Government Law. The Office has legal, financial 
and  administrative  autonomy,  hence,  while  discharging  its  responsibilities,  the  Office  is 
independent  and  does  not  receive  any  injunctions  from  other  entities.  The  OAG  has  been  a 
member of the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI) for the past 
twelve years, and the financial audit methodologies applied conform to international standards.  
B. 
Planning, M&E, Learning, KM and Communication 
203.  Planning  will  be  done  jointly  for  the  IFAD  and  ENABEL  supported  interventions  in  order  to 
avoid  overlapping  and  maximize  complementarities  and  synergies.  A  single  annual  work  plan 
and  budget  (AWPB)  will  be  developed  for  the  programme,  which  will  articulate  interventions 
under  both  financings.  The  start-up  workshop  will  be  a  critical  phase  of  the  joint  planning 
process, and sufficient time and resources will be allocated to this event. 
204.  The  AWPB  will  be  informed  by  an  assessment  of  current  implementation  progress  and  will 
describe  the  strategic  direction  of  the  programme  for  the  coming  year  along  with  results 
expected (targets) under each component and how those results will be achieved. This will be 
complemented  by  a  resource  plan,  budget  and  risk  analysis  for  each  result.  Previous  year 
performance and challenges will be analysed to define review and adjust planning and generate 
lessons.  The  AWPB  will  include  plans  for  training  and  technical  assistance,  M&E,  including  the 
procurement  plan  for  the  year  in  question.  PRISM  will  have  a  common  M&E  system  with  a 
number  of  common  indicators  for  both  interventions,  that  will  feed  into  MINAGRI’s  new 
management  information  system  (MIS),  IFAD’s  new  Operational  Results  Management  System 
(ORMS),  and  ENABEL  “PILOT”  system.  The  M&E  system  will  collect,  collate  and  analyse  data, 
both  qualitative  and  quantitative,  to  inform  decision-makers  and  management  about  the 
programme  progress  against  expected  results,  identify  implementation  bottlenecks  and  take 
timely  corrective  action  when  needed.  M&E  functions  will  be  effectively  supported  by  a 
Management Information System (MIS).  
205.  Reporting.  Reporting  will  be  done  jointly  by  the  two  projects  (funded  by  IFAD  and 
ENABEL).  The  SPIU  will  develop  standard  collecting  data  tools  and  reporting  templates  that 
captured  both  quantitative  and  qualitative  data  for  field  staff  in  the  Districts  where  small 
livestock  project  will  intervene  and  for  the  SPs  to  use.  The  template  will  be  aligned  with  the 
AWPB and the log frame indicators (output and outcome level). The report template should be 
aligned  with  the  semi-annual  and  annual  progress  report  and  should  include  programme 
progress  linked  to  the  AWPB,  the  log  frame  progress,  a  snapshot  of  cumulative  progress  and 
lessons learned from previous years (challenges, solutions provided and results). 
206.  Learning  and  knowledge  management:  Cross-learning  between  IFAD  and  ENABEL-
financed  projects  in  Rwanda  will  be  promoted  by  the  SPIU  through  workshops/meetings  to 
share knowledge and lessons learned on various topics such as M&E, FM, procurement, gender 
and youth, climate change and any other relevant area. South-South learning will be facilitated 
by  conducting  exchange  visits  across  Heifer’s  portfolio  in  Kenya,  Nepal,  and  Cambodia  so 
Rwanda  may  benefit  from  successful  models  that  Heifer  is  implementing  in  the  region  and  in 
Asia. 
207.  The  programme  will  collaborate  with  the  Agricultural  Information  and  Communication 
Centre  (CICA)  within  MINAGRI  to  produce  relevant  knowledge  products  and  ensure 
documentation  of  lessons  learnt,  best  practices  and  success  cases.  Communication  materials, 
such  as  press  releases,  extension  materials,  and  radio  spots  will  be  prepared  and  distributed 
through  a  PRISM  website  and  those  of  relevant  Ministries,  social  media,  local  television,  radio 
and  other  networks  and  used  for  policy  dialogue.  Factsheets  will  also  be  prepared  to  provide 
succinct  summaries  of  lessons  learned  in  the  programme  and  shall  have  a  wide  circulation. 
41 
Partnership for Resilient and Inclusive Small Livestock Markets 
PRISM 
Project Design Report (PDR) 
Relevant  information  from  the  programme  MIS  will  be  used  to  document  lessons  learnt,  best 
practices and c success stories. In addition, the MIS will include a specific module on KM. 
208.  Innovation  and  scaling  up:  PRISM  will  focus  on  innovation  that  have  potential  to  be 
scaled  up.  This  will  include:  (a)  contingency  mechanism  to  cope  with  an  animal  health  crisis; 
(b)    pilot  hatcheries  and  chick  breeding  units  producing  improved  dual-purpose  chicken  for 
backyard production, using renewable  energy  sources (solar), and managed by  youth; (c) For 
the less vulnerable beneficiaries in poultry and pig value chains, PRISM will actively engage the 
private  sector  as  a  service  provider,  and  in  the  case  of  broiler  production  as  a  final  off-taker 
too; (d) financial Innovations, digitalization and insurance; (e) the graduation approach to the 
poorest households.

In  order  to  improve  start-up  and  early  project  performance  through  integration  of  PRISM 
funded  activities  and  processes  into  RAB,  IFAD  will  support  a  start-up  workshop  where  RAB,  the 
SPIU  and  all  implementing  partners  will  have  a  common  understanding  of  the  project 
implementation  strategy.  During  start-up,  the  roles,  responsibilities  and  accountability  of  all 
implementers  will  be  clarified  and  agreed.  Their  capacities  will  be  assessed  and  matched  with 
required  skills  so  that  adequate  capacity  development  plans  can  be  prepared.  Feedback 
mechanisms  will  be  also  developed  to  enable  quick  decisions  on  what  to  adapt  and  improve  in  a 
flexible output-oriented manner.

mechanisms 
211.  Programme supervision: The programme will be supervised jointly by IFAD and ENABEL, 
in  partnership  with  MINAGRI  and  in  accordance  with  IFAD  and  ENABEL  guidelines.  Annual 
implementation  support  and  supervision  missions,  followed  initially  by  shorter  follow-up 
missions  six  months  later,  will  be  organised  every  year  during  the  programme’s  lifetime. 
Implementation support and supervision missions will not be conducted as a general inspection 
42 
Partnership for Resilient and Inclusive Small Livestock Markets 
PRISM 
Project Design Report (PDR) 
or  evaluation, but rather as an opportunity to assess achievements and lessons learnt, and to 
reflect  upon  ways  to  improve  implementation  and  impact.  In  this  context,  the  IFAD  Livestock 
Development  desk  and  ENABEL  technical  support  teams  at  both  HQ  will  provide  continue 
technical  backstopping  support  and  through  direct  implementation  support  to  the  SPIU.  IFAD 
will  also  be  responsible  for  (i)  reviewing  withdrawal  applications  for  IFAD  proceeds;  (ii) 
reviewing  and  approving  requests  for  no-objection;  (iii)  monitoring  compliance  with  the 
Financing  Agreement,  recommending  remedies  for  any  substantial  non-compliance;  and 
(iv) carrying  out  all  other  functions  needed  to  administer  the  financing  and  supervise  the 
programme. 
212.  Reporting arrangements: The SPIU will submit bi-annual progress reports according to a 
format  acceptable  to  both  IFAD  and  ENABEL.  These  reports  will  include  physical  and  financial 
progress  updates.  Physical  reporting  will  be  made  against  a  set  of  indicators  based  on  the 
logframe. Financial reporting will be done against the approved budget.  
213.  Mid-term  review  (MTR):  MINAGRI/RAB,  ENABEL  and  IFAD  shall  jointly  carry  out  an  in-
depth joint mid-term review no later than the third year of the programme based on the terms 
of reference prepared by the SPIU and approved by IFAD and ENABEL. Among other things, the 
MTR will consider the achievements of programme objectives and constraints t and recommend 
any reorientations that might be required. MINAGRI/RAB will ensure that the agreed actions at 
MTR are implemented within the agreed time frame.   
214.  Programme completion: After programme completion date and no later than the closing 
date,  MINAGRI/RAB  will  carry  out  a  programme  completion  report.  In  addition,  the  SPIU  will 
conduct a programme impact evaluation in order to adequately inform the completion report. 
215.  Grievance  redress  mechanisms  (GRM):  Communities  and  individuals  who  believe  that 
they  are  adversely  affected  by  PRISM  can  submit  complaints  through  the  grievance  redress 
mechanism of the programme. The mechanism ensures that complaints are promptly reviewed 
in order to address concerns related to PRISM  (see full detailed description of GRM process in 
the PIM).

71 In the context of VBHCD model, a household is considered to be graduated when it has achieved a living income. The benchmark for this in Rwanda is $3,400. Once a household is achieving this annual salary, they will have sufficient 
resources to enable all members of the household to afford a decent standard of living and will be considered “graduated”.

73 In the communities benefitting from the HBHCD model. The social mobilization full package will include community-based capacity building, saving mobilization, 
linkages to formal financial sector and markets, piloting of community-based mechanisms and nutrition and gender education. The project and the service provider will 
monitor the indicator also disaggregated by activity e.g. number of people receiving training on nutrition, gender, financial literacy, marketing etc.)

Annex 3:  Project cost and financing: Detailed costs tables 
1. Main Assumptions 
1. 
Contingencies. The cost tab has been constructed in USD as the input currency. 
The Current Purchasing Power (CPP) approach has been used to estimate the effects of 
currency  devaluation  between  the  Rwanda  Franc  and  the  United  States  Dollar.    Foreign 
Inflation  was  set  at  2%  while local  price  contingency  at  5%.  Physical contingencies  are 
minimal  given  the  nature  of  the  project  investments  whereby  maximum  ceilings  have 
been provided for the envisaged investment packages. 
2.  Exchange  Rate.  The  Rwanda  Franc  to  USD  exchange  rate  is  projected  to  stabilise 
around 885 during project implementation. This is the rate that has been used in the 
costab. 
3.  Taxes and Duties. VAT rate in Rwanda is at 18% and this has been used on the key 
standard  rated  project  PRISM  budget  items.  In  addition,  Import  duties  on  finished 
goods are 25% while Raw Materials are at 0%.The GoR will finance or waive the tax 
elements in project transactions. 
2. Project costs 
4.  The  total  PRISM  investment  and  incremental  recurrent  costs,  including  physical  and 
price  contingencies,  are  estimated  at  USD  45.64  million  (RWF  41.07  billion).  The 
table  below  presents  a  table  with  the  breakdown  of  the  costs  by  components.  The 
investment  in  Component  1(Climate-smart  intensification  of  small  production 
systems)  in  base  costs  stands  at  USD  20.65  million  (42%  of  total  base  costs); 
Component  2  (Support  to  small  livestock  value  chain  development)  in  base  costs 
totals  USD  19.40  million  (29%  of  total  base  costs)  and  Component  3  (Policy  and 
regulatory  support  and  Coordination)  in  base  costs  amounts  to  USD  5.59  million 
(11%  of  base  costs),  of  which  Project  Coordination  accounts  for  USD  2.79million 
(6.1% of total base costs). In addition to the total base costs of USD 45.38 million, 
price and physical contingencies amounting to USD 0.26 million  have been provided 
for.  The  input  currency  in  cost  tables  was  set  as  USD  minimizing  the  effect  of  local 
inflation.

Annex 4: Financial and Economic Analysis 
INTRODUCION 
1. 
The  Stream  of  Quantifiable  Benefits  from  the  Project  for  Inclusive  Small  Livestock 
Markets  fall  under  three  headings  all  totalling  to  26,355  households  (115,962)  with  a 
cost per individual beneficiary of USD 276: 
a)  Vulnerable  households  undergoing  the  graduation  pathway  (#  Households 
23,400);  
b)   Youth (# of households 1,530) and  
c)   Productive Alliance beneficiaries (# of households 1,425).

Although beneficiaries will supported to start brandy new enterprises like broilers, a 
comparison  of  the  existing  technology  for  other  farmers  was  found  necessary  but  does 
not represent the WOP situation for the actual beneficiaries: 
  Small  ruminants  production  systems:  Traditional  farmers  situation  feeding 
system  is  based  essentially  on  natural  pastures,  supplementary  feeding  is 
uncommon,  and  vaccination  and  deworming  are  not  usual.  As  a  result  of  these 
poor feeding and health conditions, and limited genetic potential, the productivity 
of small ruminants remains low.  
62

Project Design Report (PDR) 
__________________________________________________________________________________________ 
  Pig  production  systems:  The  traditional  pig  rearing  system  is  based  on 
utilization  of  kitchen  waste  and  agricultural  by-products  for  feeding  the  animals.  
PRISM  will  build  on  Modern  pig  husbandry  practices  that  have  been  introduced 
recently to Rwanda. In this system, animals are usually of imported breeds, and 
are kept in claustration, fed with concentrate feed. 
  Poultry  production  systems:  Village  backyard  chickens  have  very  low 
productivity and are generally not financially impressive. Backyard poultry will still 
be  relevant  for  vulnerable  households  undergoing  the  graduation  pathway. 
Commercial modern layers and broilers farms that have emerged during the last 
decade in Rwanda will be the form the bulk of supported investments.  
In the PRISM design, estimating WOP or Baseline income levels is not very straight 
7. 
forward  because  the  interventions  will  be  new  packages  and  not  additive  for  most 
beneficiaries. Proxies have had to be used to represent the WOP income situations. 
 
 In  the  case  of  Vulnerable  households  undergoing  the  graduation  pathway  WOP 
income level considerations were based on: the poverty line of RWF 159,375 per 
adult  equivalent  per  year  in  the  prices  of  January  2014.  Extreme  poverty  line 
(Ubudehe  1)  is  RWF  105,064  (EICV  5,  2016/2017).  The  average  of  these  two  is 
about 12,000 per month. It is well noted that the poverty line is still calculated on 
the prices of 2014 even if life's cost must have increased so far; but there is no 
reliable alternate source of data. 
  For the case of Youth and Productive alliances, again the packages will be new but 
all the same WOP income levels cannot be taken as nil. Proxies have been used to 
estimate  WOP  income  levels.    The  proxy  used  has  been  based  on  Boda  Boda  
which is  the  moto  taxi  that  is  the  main  source  of  employment  for  youth  in  rural 
and urban areas.  
  Without  project  income  levels  adopted:  The  following  considerations  were  made 
in  arriving  at  the  proxy  for  without  project  (WOP)  for  these  brandy  new 
enterprises. (i) the  poverty line (Ubudehe category 2) which is RWF 159,375 per 
adult  equivalent  per  year  in  the  prices  of  January  2014.  Extreme  poverty  line 
(Ubudehe  1)  is  RWF  105,064  (EICV  5,  2016/2017).  On  the  otherhand,  a  boda 
boda  (Motor  Bike  taxi) income  is  regarded  as  reference  for  the  youth.    A  boda 
boda rider earns an average of 12,000 RWF per month has been used as a proxy. 
This  has  however  been  prorated  because  many  of  the  enterprises  such  as  back 
yard poultry do not  require the  keeper to be  full time. Sufficient cross-reference 
to WOP proxy incomes have been made in the respective models. 
  Hire labour and family labor rates:   Labour is a combination between family and 
hired.  The  hired  labor  has  been  valued  at  RWF  1000  per  day.  For  unpaid  family 
labor a daily rate of RWF 750 is used as the financial cost85.  
  For  each  model,  a  loan  amortisation  schedule  has  been  attached  to  see  the 
sustainability  of  the  proposed  interventions.  Apart  from  the  graduation  pathway 
models  (mainly  sheep  and  goats)  which  target  very  vulnerable  beneficiaries, 
other  enterprises  should  that  a  typical  beneficiary  would  still  have  positive  cash 
flow after serving the loans for Capex and initial operating costs. 
8. 
Farm models presented in this annex indicate that the proposed interventions have 
the  potential  to  increase  the  cash  income  of  beneficiary  by  around  26%,  based  on  10 
85 The calculation of family labor wage rate is based on World Bank (2014) Transformation of Agriculture 
Sector Program Phase 3.

enterprise  modes.  This  represents  an  average  increase  in  come  of  RwF  528,000  (USD 
596)  per  year.  This  is  still  sufficient  to  make  a  real  difference  to  the  lives  of  the 
beneficiaries. 
9. 
Costs already included in enterprise models: To avoid double counting of costs, the 
costs already included in enterprise models in arriving the gross margins were computed 
at around 60% as follows: 
10.  Given  this  level  of  financial  benefit  to  the  target  group,  it  is  not  surprising  that 
PRISM will also generate a high economic rate of return (ERR) – estimated to be around 
19%  and  relatively  insensitive  to  cost  escalation,  benefit  reduction  and  delays.  It  is 
emphasised  however  that  this  is  a  minimum  because  it  only  considers  the  economic 
benefits at farm gate level in the value chain. The benefits to downstream actors in the 
value chains from increased trade volumes, quality and value adding opportunities have 
not been considered due to estimation difficulties.   
FINANCIAL ANALYS 
Objectives 
11.  The objectives of this financial analysis are: 
 
 
 
to  assess  the  financial  viability  of  the  improved  production  and  value  addition 
technologies and systems promoted by PRISM for farmers and their households;  
to examine the impact of PRISM interventions on cash flow, and incomes; and 
to use enterprise models to demonstrate that there is sufficient financial incentive 
for  typical  smallholder  households  to  participate  in  the  Project.    The  purpose  of 
enterprise modelling is to illustrate how the project interventions will bring about

summarised below: 
In attachment 1 to this annex, ten priority enterprise budgets   are presented and 
13.  Choice  of  Discount  rate.    Many  options  for  the  choice  of  discount  rate  were 
considered  at  financial  analysis  level.  From  the  table  below  the  opportunity  cost  of 
capital  at  financial  analysis  level  could  have  been  taken  at  5%,  however,  given  the 
agency  banking  approach  commercial  banks  are  using  for  their  outreach  and  the 
typology  of  the  target  beneficiary  capital  levels  for  the  kind  of  investments  the  next 
available rate was taken 8.5%.

From the overall aggregation analysis and factoring the project economic costs results in 
the over Economic Rate of Return and NPV. 
15.  The  results  of  the  economic  analysis  justify  the  PRISM  investments.  The  analysis 
shows that the PRISM has the capacity to generate an economic rate of return (ERR) of 
26%  percent  over  a  20-year  period.  It  is  worth  noting  that,  due  to  estimation-related 
complications, there are some benefits that would accrue to different stakeholders of the 
different  value  chains.    It  is,  nonetheless,  prudent  to  point  out  that  these  other 
additional benefits will make the entire investment that much more viable and beneficial 
to  the  nation  as  a  whole  through  increased  employment  creation  and  tax  revenues.  
Thus, the actual ERR will likely be higher than the 19% reported herein. 
16.  The discount rate is based on more long term bonds as reflected in the table below 
(9.5%) for larger societal level investments 9.5%: 
17.  A  sensitivity  analysis  was  carried  out  to  assess  the  likely  impact  of  a  variation  of 
some key factors on the economic return of the project. It indicates a strong resilience to 
increases  of  costs  and  reductions  of  benefits  which  mirror  the  PRISM  risk  profile.  The 
project  would  still  yield  an  EIRR  of  respectively  18%  and  17% if  benefits  were  reduced 
by  10%  and  20%.  In  the  extreme  case  of  benefits  being  reduced  by  50%,  the  EIRR 
would  establish  at  12%,  a  value  above  the  social  discount  rate.  If  benefits  lag  by  two

Annex 4:  Social Environment and Climate Assessment (SECAP)Review Note 
1. Introduction  
1. 
The objective of the SECAP Review Note was to assess the social, environmental and 
climate  change  issues  relevant  for  the  project,  in  order  to  identify  how  the  project 
might impact them and how IFAD's mainstreaming themes (gender, youth, nutrition, 
environment  and  climate  change)  could  be  addressed  through  an  integrated 
approach.  
2. 
With  this  aim,  consultations  with  relevant  stakeholders  were  undertaken  during  the 
project design mission, including: farmers organizations, women and youth groups engaged 
in  small  livestock  value  chains,  national  authorities  (Ministry  of  infrastructure,  Rwanda 
Energy  Group)  local  authorities  at  the  district  level  (including  Health  and  Environment 
district  officers),  technical  and  development  partners  (Heifer  International,  FAO,  WFP,  SUN 
civil  society  network,  ENABEL,  SNV,  VSF-Belgium),  the  Rwanda  Youth  Agribusiness  Forum 
and the Imbaranga Farmers organizations, among others.  
2. Situational analysis and potential project impacts 
2.1 Socio-economic assessment 
a. Overall poverty situation 
3. 
The  project  area  encompasses  the  Northern,  Southern  and  Western  provinces  of 
Rwanda86.  The  three  provinces  together  have  a  population  of  approximately    1,769,000 
households (62.6% of the total number of households at the national level)87, corresponding 
to 7,784,000 people88, of which 20% are in Ubudehe category 1, 38% in category 2,42% in 
category  3  and  only  0.10%  are  in  category  489,  with  marginal  variations  between  the 
provinces.  89%  of  the  population  live  in  rural  areas90.  Table  1  shows  the  number  of 
households in the four Ubudehe categories in the project area and respective districts.  
4. 
Small  plot  sizes,  limited  land  availability,  and  low  soil  fertility  due  to  erosion  are 
major  constraints  on  farm  productivity  and  profitability  and  prevent  farmers  from  moving 
further  up  the  value  chain.  The  prevalence  of  poverty  among  rural  households  is  primarily 
associated with low productivity in subsistence agriculture and low purchasing power. 60% 
of  households  cultivate  less  than  0.7  ha,  and  30%  cultivate  less  than  0.2  ha91.  Poverty  is 
highest  by  far  (76.6%)  among  households  with  little  or  no  land,  who  obtain  their  income 
mainly from seasonal labour. Resource poor rural households who farm small plots are the 
most food insecure. 
86 Other districts, e.g. Bugesera (Eastern province) and the city of Kigali may be targeted for specific activities, such as the establishment of 
strategic partnership between small holders and the private sector and their inclusion in productive alliances or 4P arrangements. 
87 Source: Ministry of Local Government (MINALOC), data collected on February 2019.  
88 One household = 4,4 household members. 
89  The  estimation  is  made  using  the  national  wealth  ranking  system  (Ubudehe  system),  whose  classification  is  based  on  a  participatory  self-
assessment  (4  revised  categories).  The  data  on  households  falling  in  the  4  different  Ubudehe  categories  have  been  provided  by  MINALOC 
during the project design mission (February 2019). The first category (i) includes the very poor who do not have a house or cannot to pay rent; 
have a poor diet; and can hardly afford basic needs; (ii) the second category includes those who have a dwelling of their own or are able to rent 
one  but  rarely  get  full  time  jobs;  (iii)  the  third  category  includes  those  who  have  a  job  and  farmers  who  go  beyond  subsistence  farming  to 
produce a surplus, which can be sold; (iv) the fourth category includes people who own large-scale business.  
90 Fourth Rwanda Population and Housing Census, 2012. There are differences in the incidence of poverty across districts: the poverty rate rises 
in  the  Southern  and  Western  provinces,  with  higher  incidence  in  Nyaruguro  (South)  and  Nyamasheke  (West)  districts  where  the  number  of 
households living in poverty reaches 74 and 71% respectively, and in Ngororero (West), Gisagara (South) and Gakenke (north) districts where 
more than 65% of the population live in poverty.

5. 
Despite increases to food availability, stability of food throughout the year and at all 
times  remains  an  important  constraint  in  the  project  area.  Findings  from  EICV4 
(2014/2014) and EICV5 (2016/2017) show a correlation between poverty rates with the rise 
in  the  price  of  foods  (especially  staple  vegetables  and  root  crops)  and  the  reduction  of 
purchasing power of households. According to the latest CFSVA (2018) almost 60% of food 
insecure  households  are  in  Ubudehe  category  2  and  30%  are  in  in  Ubudehe  category  1. 
Household food security is strongly related to  food prices with poorer households far more 
vulnerable to fluctuating prices. Food prices for staple commodities such as maize and beans 
are  generally  increasing  at  the  end  of  the  year,  before  the  harvesting  season.  This  is  also 
the  time  of  the  year  when  household  food  stocks  have  run  out  and  market  dependency  is 
highest. 
6. 
Poverty also relates with households' vulnerability to shocks and with their ability to 
cope  with  these  shocks92.  As  the  most  of  the  rural  population  is  dependent  on  rain-fed 
agriculture  and  consumption  of  home  produced  food,  people’s  ability  to  adequately  feed 
themselves  is  susceptible  to  shocks  from  farming  and  the  domestic  harvest,  that  arise  as 
92 Shocks (unusual situations) are mostly related to farming and domestic harvest, as well as problems of high food prices and issues related to 
health.

result of periodic droughts and floods93. Households' low resilience and high vulnerability to 
shocks, therefore, constrain their ability to overcome poverty barriers  and to improve food 
security and nutrition.   
Despite the high rates of poverty and food insecurity, the project area is a traditional 
7. 
production  basin  for  small  livestock  and  poultry:  the  Northern  province  alone  accounts  for 
42%  of  the  national  sheep  production,  Southern  province  of  pig  production  (42%)  and 
poultry  (30%).  Table  2  presents  the  total  number  of  households  in  the  project  area  and 
respective  districts,  vis-à-vis  the  percentage  of  food  insecure  households  and  the  small 
livestock and poultry production.

b. Gender 
8. 
Rwanda has made great strides in promoting gender equality, and significant gains in 
improving  women’s  participation  at  the  political  and  decision-making  levels:  this  has 
resulted  in  Rwanda  having  the  highest  percentage  (64%)  of  women  in  parliament  in  the 
world. In the 2018 World Economic Forum Gender Parity Report, Rwanda ranked 6th out of 
149 countries (global index) and 4th regarding achievements in political empowerment.94  
Despite these achievements, gender disparities still persist, especially in rural areas, 
9. 
where  traditional  patriarchal  attitudes  continue  to  prevail.  Data  from  EICV5  show  that 
39.5%  of  female-headed  households  were  classified  as  poor  compared  to  37.6%  of  male-
93 In response to farm shocks, EICV5 reports, 40% of poor rural households reacted by buying less food, while only 20% used savings or 
borrowed money. Similarly, households' response to high food prices was purchasing less food (70%).

headed households in 2016/17. Among households headed by women, 69% are either food 
insecure  or  marginally  food  secure95.  In  the  project  area,  data  from  the  Ministry  of  Local 
Government  (2019)  show  that,  while  female-headed  households  account  for  20%  of  the 
total  households  in  Ubudehe  category  3  (not  poor),  the  average  increases  up  to  55%  in 
Ubudehe category 1. 
10. 
According  to  the  latest  Agricultural  Household  Survey,  2017,  women  in  agricultural 
households represent 53% of the population in the three provinces targeted by the project. 
In  rural  areas,  women  concentrate  their  work  in  agriculture  (almost  90%)96  and  rely  on 
agricultural  activities  as  the  only  source  of  income.  Yet,  with  lower  levels  of  schooling  and 
higher rates of illiteracy, they are constrained to subsistence farming with insufficient skills, 
access  to  markets  and  control  over  land  and  other  key  assets  and  agricultural  services, 
compared to men. Women also lack the capacity to participate in agri-business and they are 
less employed in non-farm work, relative to men. In male-headed households, women work 
for  more  hours  (15.5  hours)  than  men  (7  hours),  spending  over  three  hours  more  on 
farming activities than the seven hours worked by men, in addition to five hours on unpaid 
reproductive and household work97.  
11. 
  Violence against women was defined in 1993 by the United Nations Declaration on 
the Elimination of Violence against Women as “any act of gender-based violence (GBV) that 
results  in,  or  is  likely  to  result  in,  physical,  sexual  or  psychological  harm  or  suffering  to 
women, including threats of  such acts,  coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether 
occurring in public or in private life”.98 In Rwanda, the Gender Monitoring Office has defined 
four  categories  of  GBV:  (i)  economic  violence  through  denial  of  economic  rights  to 
property, succession, employment or other economic benefits; (ii) physical violence as the 
intentional use of physical force with the potential to cause harm, injury, disability or death; 
(iii)  sexual  violence  as  an  act  of  forcing  another  individual,  through  violence,  threats, 
deception,  cultural  expectation,  weapons  or  economic  circumstances,  to  engage  in  sexual 
behaviour  against  her  or  his  will;  and  (iv)  psychological  violence  as  a  trauma  to  the 
victim caused by acts, threats of acts or coercive tactics; these threats are often related to 
sexual or physical violence. Yet, few data are available on the gender-based violence cases 
in the rural areas.  
Major  issues  that  constrain  women  in  agriculture  are  related  to  (i)  time  burden  (ii) 
12. 
access  to  finance;  (iii)  access  to  inputs  and  technology  and  (iv)  extension  services  and 
trainings99.  Gender  disparities  are  also  evident  in  the  value  addition  and  marketing  of 
agricultural  commodities  where  more  economic  commodities  are  controlled  by  men.  In 
general  women  are  associated  with  marketing  small  quantities  of  production    while  larger 
quantities are marketed by men who also control the income from the sales. 
c. Youth 
Youth  is  defined  in  Rwanda  as  population  aged  16  to  30  years100.  In  the  three 
13. 
provinces  targeted  by  the  project,  youth  represents  25%  of  the  total  rural  population  and 
30%  of  the  agricultural  labourers101.  Among  them,  66%  has  primary  education  while  only 
95 EICV5, 2016/2017, Thematic Report, Gender. Part of  the reason is that  in 70% of cases, women heads of household are widows and have 
fewer adult household members that can contribute to household income 
96 70.5 of women work as independent farmer and 18.3 as wage farmers. NISR, EICV5, 2016/2017

17% has secondary school education102. According to the  EICV5, 77.2%  of  rural youth are 
workers,  mostly  engaged  as  independent  farmers  (36  %  male  and  53  %  female).  Among 
young people working in agriculture, the proportion of male decreases for older age groups 
from  64.5%  (16–20  years  old)  to  46.5  %  (26–30  years  old);  young  male  are  gradually 
engaged  in  other  working  activities,  such  as  construction  or  repair  of  motorcycles  and 
vehicles.  This  pattern  reverses  for  female  as  the  proportion  increases  in  older  age  groups 
from 52.2% (16–20 years old) to 62.2% (26–30 years old).  
Young  people  are  most  amongst  the  most  vulnerable  sectors  of  the  population: 
14. 
almost  30%  of  young  people  (16-30)  live  in  households  that  are  below  poverty  line,  while 
the  rate  of  extreme  poverty  among  youth  is  11.3%  compared  to  the  16%  at  the  national 
level for all ages. More  female were  extremely  poor (12%) compared to males (10,4%) in 
2016/2017103. 
15. 
The major causes of problems in regard to youth’s access to market and challenges 
to youth entrepreneurship and business development include: lack of technical skills, limited 
access  to  information  and  opportunities,  inadequate  access  to  resources  (land  and  capital) 
insufficient  support  services,  business  and  management  skills,  among  others.  Precarious 
forms  of  employment  with  low  level  of  earning  is  the  main  employment  problem  for  the 
youth. 
e. People living with disabilities  
Around 7% of heads of household have a disability104. These households tend to be 
16. 
more food insecure (27% against 18% for the heads of households without disability). The 
majority of people with disabilities live in rural areas. Women with disabilities are less likely 
to be married and they are more isolated than disabled men. Disabled women and girls are 
also more vulnerable to sexual violence and abuse. 
f. Nutrition 
According  to  the  CSFVA,  2018,  there  has  been  a  reduction  of  stunting  prevalence 
17. 
among children under five years at the national level over the last few years, from 43.4% in 
2012 to 36.7% in 2015 and 34.9% in 2018, although the level of stunting remains very high 
according  to  the  WHO  threshold.  In  the  three  provinces  targeted  by  the  project,  the 
prevalence  of  child  stunting  reaches  40%  on  average105.  The  level  of  acute  undernutrition 
(wasting)  for  children  under  5  years  is  2.0  %,  which  is  within  the  WHO  acceptable  limit. 
Infant and young child feeding (IYCF) practices remain inadequate: CSFVA 2018 finds that 
no  more  than  17%  of  children  achieved  the  minimum  acceptable  diet  (MAD)  based  on 
dietary diversity and meal frequency. Moreover, in 2015, 19% of women in reproductive age 
suffered from anaemia as a result of low iron intake (CSFA, 2015).  
18. 
In the project area, there is a clear correlation between poverty rates, food insecurity 
and  prevalence  of  stunting in  children.  In  most  cases,  districts  with  a  higher  proportion  of 
food  insecure  households  have  a  higher  prevalence  of  stunted  children106.  However,  even 
though  stunting  rate  has  decreased  when  households  are  more  food  secure,  findings  from 
CFSVA 2018 show that there is still about 26% stunted children in food secure households. 
102 Proportion between male and female is equal at the primary school level while the number of female attending secondary school is slightly 
higher (18 % compared to 16 % of male). AHS, 2017.  
103 EICV5, 2016/2017, Thematic Report, Youth.  
104 CFSVA, 2018. 
105  According  to  CFSVA  2018,  11  districts  presents  more  than  40%  prevalence  of  child  stunting,  with  Rutsiro,  Nyabihu  and  Rubavu  districts 
(West) presenting over 50% stunting prevalence.  
106  The  four  districts  in  the  project  area,  Rutsiro  and  Ngororero  (west),  Nyamagabe  (South)  and  Burera  (North)  with  30  %  or  more  of  food 
insecure households also have a stunting prevalence above 40%.   
84 
Project for Inclusive Small Livestock Markets

Project Design Report (PDR) 
19. 
An analysis of determinants for chronic malnutrition in the project area suggests that 
poverty and education, especially of the mother, have a clear relationship with prevalence of 
stunting  in  children:  (women  living  in  poverty  and  with  low  level  of  education  are  more 
likely to have stunted children): almost one child out of two whose mother has no education 
is  stunted.107  CFSVA  2018  also  shows  a  significant  correlation  between  the  mother’s  food 
consumption and the child’s food consumption: women’s knowledge and education on food 
diversity has been recognized as a significant factor impacting children’s food consumption, 
especially for achieving the minimum acceptable diet. 
20. 
In  addition,  environmental  factors,  both  behavioural  and  those  linked  to  access  to 
water and sanitation, also contribute to this problem: access to clean drinking water remain 
a  challenge  in  rural  areas  (47%  have  access  to  water  within  500  meters  of  their 
residence)108.  
2.2 Environment and climate context, trends and implications 
a. Environmental assessment 
21. 
Rwanda’s  land  is  fragile  due  to  its  mountainous  topography.  The  Northern  and 
Western  provinces  host  the  Congo-Nile  Ridge  and  volcanic  chains  of  Birunga  (northern 
regions)  with  altitude  varying  between  1,800  m  and  4,507  m  (on  the  top  of  Kalisimbi 
Volcano)  while  the  Western  and  Southern  regions  around  Kivu  Lake  and  Bugarama  plains 
range  between  900  m  to  1800  m.  In  these  regions,  high  level  of  population  pressure 
coupled  with  the  susceptibility  to  landslides  may  increase  soil  loss  and  nutrient  leaching 
from  soil  and  thus  challenging  agricultural  productivity  growth  and  endangering  the  life  of 
about 40 % of total population.109  
22. 
 The small livestock production and family animal farming in Rwanda rely mainly on 
low- input systems and hence have light environmental impact. In addition, small livestock 
production (especially goat and sheep) in rangeland may improve soil and vegetation cover, 
plant  and  animal  biodiversity  by  removing  biomass,  controlling  shrubs  growth  and 
dispersing seeds through their hoofs and manure110.  Depending on the types of production, 
backyard  or  commercial,  the  environmental  impact  of  each  livestock  farming  system  will 
vary  according  to  the  main  source  of  animal  feed  (natural  pastures,  home-based  or  agro-
industry animal feed) and processing techniques and facilities.   
23. 
Small  ruminants  (sheep  and  goats)  are  primary  owned  by  the  poor  sections  of 
rural communities and contribute significantly to subsistence farming. Their meat is largely 
marketed  informally  on  local  and  village  markets. Sheep  and  goats  contribute  significantly 
to  local  livelihoods  development  because  of  their  ability  to  convert  forages  and  crops  and 
household residues into meat, fibre, skins and milk. These value chains are characterized by 
low  environmental  impact  due  to  low  productivity  levels  as  their  main  source  of  feed  is 
grazing  and  browsing  on  natural  pastures.  Due  to  their  grazing  habits  and  physiological 
characteristics, they are able to browse on plants that would normally not be eaten by other 
livestock  species111.  Yet,  the  quantity  and  quality  of  natural  pastures  show  seasonal 
107 CFSVA 2018. Stunting in children living in the poorest households is higher (49%) than among children in the richest households (21%) and is 
higher among children whose mothers have no education (47%) than among those whose mothers have a secondary education or higher (19%). 
More than 40% of children were stunted in households within Ubudehe category 1.

fluctuations.  Poor  nutrition  leads  to  poor  production  and  reproductive  performance  and 
increased susceptibility to diseases and parasites.   
24. 
Poultry  (layers  and  broilers)  value  chains:  Poultry  are  adaptable  to  various 
climates and altitudes. They are well suited to various agro-ecological zones in Rwanda and 
may be combined to other types of farming112. The poultry sector in Rwanda is divided into 
traditional  poultry  farmers  and  industrial  poultry  farmers.  80%  of  small-scale  farmers  are 
rearing  chicken  and  the  estimated  population  of  birds  amount  to  4.8  million  animals, 
majority  of  them  are  indigenous113.  The  traditional  poultry  farmers  are  predominant  and 
produce  mainly  in  village  and  backyard  family  farming,  with  mainly  dual  purposes  (meat 
and  eggs)  chicken  species  fed  with  home-based  formula  (e.g.  mixes  of  by-products,  soya 
and maize bran, etc.). The commercial poultry value chain is highly technical and relies on 
pricey manufactured feed composed of imported raw materials (e.g. cotton seed cake, fish 
meal, lake shells, etc.) or produced in small quantities (e.g. maize) and in competition with 
human  food.  The  expansion  of  the  farming  system  (from  backyard  to  commercial 
enterprises)  increases  the  environmental  impact.  Poultry  large  facilities  produce  strong 
odours
  and  attract  flies,  rodents  and  other  pests  that  create  local  nuisances  and  carry 
disease114.  In  addition,  inadequate  disposal  of  poultry  carcasses  can  contribute  to  water 
pollution especially in areas prone to flooding or where there is a shallow water table115. 
25. 
Pork value chain:  In the project-targeted areas, the pig sector is characterized by 
intensive  and  semi-intensive  productions  systems.  Pig  farming  systems  have  low  cost  of 
production,  require  less  space  than  other  livestock  species  and  are  adaptable  to  various 
environmental  conditions  (Mbuza &  al.,  2016).  Feed  ratio  for  backyard  pig  production  is 
mainly composed of wastes and crop residues. Housing structures are mainly temporary and 
semi-permanent, including a provision of pits for waste disposal to collect manure used for 
fertilization of crop fields. The semi-intensive pig production enterprises rely on commercial 
feedstuff  for  supplementary  feeding  of  on-farm  ratio  formulation.  Manure  and  waste 
disposal is a major environmental challenge in small- and large-scale commercial systems, 
especially  when  not  linked  to  mixed  crop-livestock  system  (Herrero,  2014).  This  is  also  a 
challenge at small slaughterhouses and slabs with no effluent treatment facilities.  
26. 
The project will mainstream environmental management through promotion of agro-
forestry species at vulnerable households, promotion of rainwater harvesting technologies at 
both household and processing and trading facilities. 
b. Climate trends and impacts 
In the north-west highlands and  south-western regions,  climate change is  expected 
27. 
to increase mean rainfall as well as intensities and number of rainy days116. These  regions 
will most likely have a constant supply of water117. In various climate projections scenarios, 
northern highlands and southwest  regions will more likely experience  extreme events such 
as floods and landslides.  
28. 
Global total Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions from livestock supply chains (including 
feed  production  and  processing,  enteric  fermentation  from  ruminants  and  manure 
management) are estimated at 14.5 % from all human induced emissions with the highest 
112 Mbuza & al., 2016

Project Design Report (PDR) 
emissions  produced  by  beef  and  cattle  milk  production  systems  while  pig  and  chicken 
production systems have the lowest GHG emissions118. GHG emissions from small ruminants 
(sheep and goat) represent 6.5% of the sector’s global emissions. Globally pork production 
represents  9%  of  livestock  sector  emissions  and  ninety-five  percent  of  the  production  is 
mainly geographically concentrated in East Asia,  Europe and the Americas. Finally, chicken 
production GHG's emission is estimated at 8% of the livestock sector emissions. 
29. 
Access to energy. In the recent years, access to energy has increased and 34,5 % 
of households had access to electricity as of June 2017. However, the Final Energy Strategy 
(2018)  acknowledges  that  grid  connections  will  be  economically  inefficient  in  the  short-
medium term for households which use small volumes of electricity. The grid expansion is a 
slow  process  and  it  will  take  decades  to  reach  all  households.  Hence,  the  Government  of 
Rwanda  promotes  off-grid  (e.g.  solar  home  systems)  and  sustainable  biomass  solutions 
which  are  considered  as  viable  alternative  to  grid  connections119.The  promotion  of 
renewable energy along small livestock value chain will contribute to the national targets for 
both climate change mitigation and adaptation. 
30. 
During  project  implementation,  emissions  intensities  will  fluctuate  according  to  the 
species (monogastrics are more efficient than ruminants), products (white meats and eggs 
are more GHG-efficient than red meat) and the productivity of the animals (the higher the 
productivity the lower the emissions per unit of product, apart from pig production)120. In all 
production systems, manure storage, processing and applications practices will be adopted 
in order to mitigate GHG  emissions.  In addition, the project will promote energy  efficiency 
along  the  small  livestock  value  chains,  through  promotion  of  biogas  systems  at  both 
households  levels  and  processing  facilities  (e.g.  slaughter  slabs  and  houses),  and  solar 
panels for small scale poultry farms.  
c. Climate change mitigation 
An  EACT121  assessment  shall  be  performed  at  project  inception.  This  will  require 
31. 
collection of data during the baseline survey.  
2.3. Target group profiles 
The  project  will  target  three  main  categories  of  beneficiaries  applying  differentiated 
32. 
and complementary approaches: 
33. 
Poor  and  food  insecure  rural  households:  23,400  rural  households  from  Ubudehe 
category  1  and  2  will  be  targeted.  Poor  and  food  insecure  households  have  few  active 
members  (active  members  are  between  18-60  years  old),  are  more  often  headed  by  a 
person  with  low  level  of  education,  or  a  single  or  a  person  with  disabilities.  They  mainly 
depend  on  agriculture  daily  labour,  on  their  own  agricultural  production  (low-income 
agriculturalist),  unskilled  daily  labour,  or  on  external  support  for  their  livelihoods.  Those 
engaged in agriculture have no land or land of small size, grow fewer crops, are less likely 
to  have  a  vegetable  garden  or  livestock,  and  are  less  likely  to  practice  land  conservation. 
Within poor households, the project will give priority to:

  Female-headed  households:  are  more  prone  to  be  food  insecure  (23%)  then  male-
headed households (17%)122. Among female-headed households, widowed household 
heads  are  more  likely  to  be  poorer  than  other  categories.  CFSVA  2018  found  that 
female-headed  households  have  no  land  or  access  to  small  sized  (<0.5  ha) 
compared to male-headed households. They also  own less or smaller  livestock than 
male  headed  households  and  consume  less  of  their  animal  products  (only  15%  of 
female  headed  households  consume  animal  products).  Also, 
female-headed 
households spend a larger share on food (50 %) than male-headed (45 %).  
  Young women and men: the most of the young people (16-30) are workers, engaged 
in  the  agricultural  sector  independent  farmers,  and  they  have  a  low  level  of 
education.  Female  youths  are  mostly  engaged  in  homestead  income  generation 
activities like poultry,  small livestock rearing and vegetable production. Both female 
and  male  youths  also  support  their  incomes  through  organized  group  activities  like 
livestock fattening, tree planting, irrigation canal and roof catchment construction. 
  Vulnerable households: the poorest and food insecure households, are more likely to 
have  women  with  low  level  of  education  and  children  suffering  from  undernutrition 
and stunting. Although the project will not directly target children, it is expected that 
they  will  benefit  from  project's  initiatives  aimed  at  improving  the  quality  of  women 
and households' diets.  
To  reach  the  poor  and  food  insecure  households,  the  project  will  deploy  a  pro-poor 
34. 
approach  through  a  graduation  pathway,  aimed  at  addressing  community  development 
through  an  integrated  and  holistic  approach.  The  graduation  pathway  will  be  based  on  the 
Values-Based Holistic Community Development (VBHCD) model designed and implemented 
by  Heifer  International.  This  model  builds  on  12  Cornerstones  including  financial  literacy, 
self-help groups, nutrition education, gender and women's empowerment, among others. At 
the core of this approach is the "Passing on the Gift (POG)" practice, through which people 
give  one  of  their  animals’  first  offspring  to  others  in  need123.  With  this  practice,  it  is 
expected  to  significantly  increase  the  number  of  beneficiaries  by  the  end  of  the  project. 
Women  heads  of  households,  young  women  and  men  and  vulnerable  households  will  be 
prioritized  as  first  recipients  of  the  POG  practice.  With  the  poorest  households  the  project 
will  target  the  backyard  poultry  value  chain,  the  family  pig  production  and  the  small 
ruminants production, which are productions particularly suitable for women. 
35. 
Unemployed  rural  youth  (16-30  years  age,  in  Ubudehe  category  1  to  3):  are  youth 
engaged in agriculture, unemployed and with low level of education (primary level). Overall, 
1,530  young  people  (50%  female)  will  be  targeted  through  this  programme  (100  per 
targeted  District  in  average).  The  project  will  support  groups  of  ten  youth  on  average, 
located  on  the  same  site  but  with  independent  production  units.  The  targeted  productions 
will  be  commercial  poultry  (layers  and  broilers),  and  pig  (breeding  and  fattening).  These 
productions  are  particularly  well  adapted  to  youth  because  they  require  a  very  limited 
amount  of  land,  limited  investment  and  they  can  provide  a  very  good  and  quick  return  on 
investment.  The  support  package  will  include  initial  intensive  technical  and  business 
management support, continuous tutoring through business coaches and provision of start-
up capital for investment, and linkages to financial service providers.

Market-oriented producers: less vulnerable producers, mostly in Ubudehe category 2 
and  3.  These  medium-income  producers  usually  obtain  the  vast  majority  of  their  income 
from their own land and from other numerous activities. A total of 1,425 producers will be

targeted  (525  broiler  farmers,  450  eggs  producers,  450  pig  fatteners).  These  farmers, 
already engaged in a more entrepreneurial logic, will be supported through a combination of 
technical,  business  and  financial  capacity  building  combined  with  backward  and  forward 
market  facilitation.  This  will  be  provided  in  the  scope  of  innovative  value  chain 
arrangements that facilitate the participation of smallholders in commercial value chains.  
3. Institutional analysis  
Strategic  institution  and  development  partners  with  whom  the  project  could 
37. 
collaborate to help achieve IFAD’s mainstreaming agenda are listed below:  
Gender 
Youth 
Nutrition  
Ministry  of  Gender  and  Family  Promotion  (MIGEPROF)  plays  a 
leading role in the implementation of the gender agenda in the country. 
The  project  could  coordinate  with  MIGEPROF  on  initiatives  for  gender 
equality and women empowerment at the district level (coordinating with 
the Gender and Family Promotion Officers) in particular. 
The Gender Monitoring Office (GMO) is mandated by the Constitution, 
along  with  the  Ministry  of  Gender  and  Family  Promotion,  and  the 
National Women’s Council for executing several programs and policies 
to address these gender gaps and constraints.  
In  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  a  gender  advisor  supports  capacity 
building  of  staff  through  development  of  performance  contracts  that 
address  gender  integration,  including  identification  of  key  gender-
responsive indicators. 
Rwanda Youth Agribusiness Forum (RYAF) is a platform established 
to bring together different youth organizations, individual youth farmers 
and  entrepreneurs.  RYAF  is  relevant  partner,  already  engaged  in  IFAD-
supported  projects  PASP  and  RDDP  in  the  delivery  of  training  and 
extension  services,  that  could  be  further  involved  to  engage  youth  in 
agriculture,  as  service  providers  as  well  as  beneficiaries  of  capacity 
building, business and financial services.  
District Plans to Eliminate Malnutrition (DPEM). At the district level, 
in  accordance  with  the  National  Decentralization  Policy,  multi-sectoral 
committees  are  established  to  coordinate  the  implementation  of  the 
nutrition  programmes.  Under  the  leadership  of  the  District  Major,  these 
committees  are  composed  of  district  directors  of  health,  nutritionists, 
women  and  youth’  district  representatives,  agronomists  and  social 
protection,  veterinary,  and  hygiene  and  sanitation  officers.  The  district-
level  committees  oversee  the  implementation  of  DPEMs.  All  30  districts 
have  developed  DPEMs  that  will  be  key  references  for  the  development 
and delivery of nutrition-related activities in the districts targeted by the 
project. 
National  Early  Childhood  Care  and  Development  Programme 
(NECDP),  which  operates  under  the  Ministry  of  Gender  and  Family 
Promotion, is a governmental programme already partnering with RDDP 
in the delivery of nutrition education. Collaboration will be established to 
deliver nutrition education to youth production groups and cooperatives. 
Food  and  Agriculture  Organization  (FAO)  in  partnership  with  the 
GoR,  is  currently  developing  national  Food-Based  Dietary  Guidelines

(FBDGs) in Kinyarwanda, that will be used to educate people to consume 
a  more  diverse  and  nutrient-and  balanced  diet  as  well  as  guide 
interventions aimed at addressing nutritional concerns in the country. As 
part  of  its  nutrition-sensitive  activities,  the  project  will  promote  the 
dissemination of FBDGs with the sectors where it will operate. 
The Ministry of Infrastructures (MININFRA) is in charge initiating, 
developing and maintaining sustainable power generation facilities to 
supply clean, cost-effective and uninterrupted energy for the country 
and the region. In addition, the Ministry aims at increasing access to 
affordable energy, water and sanitation infrastructures.  The Ministry 
hosts the Rwanda National Biogas Programme (NDBP) and is responsible 
for the management and implementation of domestic biogas sector 
development in Rwanda. The overall objective of the programme is to 
contribute to poverty eradication, gender equality, health improvement 
and environmental sustainability. NDBP requires private sector 
involvement in the fields of marketing and promotion, training, 
construction, operation and maintenance, monitoring and evaluation, 
quality control, extension, credit and subsidy, etc.  
Within  the  Ministry  of  Infrastructure,  Rwanda  Energy  Group  Limited 
(REG) was created in 2014 to expand, maintain and operate the energy 
infrastructure  in  Rwanda.  The  National  Energy  Policy  and  National 
Energy  Strategy,  recognizes  that  the  use  of  biomass  energy  has 
potentially  serious  environmental 
implications  and  may  be  non-
renewable unless properly managed.  
REG (EDCL124) in partnership with SNV has already provided training of 2 
masons  per  Sector  in  26  Districts  for  the  construction  of  bio-digesters 
plants.  
Under  supervision  of 
the  Ministry  of  Environment,  Rwanda 
Environment  Management  Authority  (REMA),  reserves  the  legal 
mandate for national environmental protection, conservation, promotion 
and  overall  management,  including  advisory  to  the  government  on  all 
matters pertinent to the environment and climate change. REMA aims at

mainstreaming  gender  into  the  national  development  process  and 
outcomes.  The  main  objective  of  the  policy  is  to  integrate  gender  into 
critical  areas  such  as  poverty,  health,  agriculture  and  food  security  and 
education, among others. 
National  Gender  Coordination  and  Partnership  Strategy  (2016-
2020),  guides  the  coordination  of  gender  promotion,  establishing  a 
framework  for  stakeholders’  coordination  and  engagement  and  set 
strategic priorities for action. 
National  Policy  against  Gender-Based  Violence  (2011)  supports 
gender-based  violence  prevention  and  response,  and  provides  an 
opportunity for further advancements. Significant steps have been taken in 
the  country  to  have  dedicated  staff  and  resources  to  provide  services  to 
victims  and  reduce  impunity  for  GBV.  The  existing  One-Stop  Centers 
provide critical support to victims of GBV and can be used as a model for 
integrated care and support.  
National Youth Policy (2015) focuses on youth economic empowerment 
by addressing issues related to unemployment and underemployment, 
limited skills, low rate of access to finance and markets, among others.

Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy (EDPRS2), 
2013-2018: 
food  security  and  nutrition  as  “long-term 
foundational  issues”  and  strategic  country’s  priorities.  One  of  the  main 
goals of the EDPRS2 is reduction of the rates of stunting in children; this is 
being  tackled  through  community-based  nutrition  programmes  and 
campaigns across the country.  
The  Strategic  Plan  for  Agriculture  Transformation  4  (PSTA  IV), 
2018-2023, introduces improved nutrition amongst its priority areas and 
outcomes  and  nutrition-sensitive  agriculture  as  one  of  the  main 
interventions.  
The  National  Food  and  Nutrition  Policy  (2013)  recognizes  the  link 
between  adequate  nutrition  and  household  food  security  and  focuses 
particularly  on  the  “window  of  opportunity”  for  preventing  malnutrition 
(from  conception  to  the  child’s  second  year  of  life).  The  National  Food 
and  Nutrition  Strategic  Plan 
(2013-2018)  orients  Policy’s 
implementation focusing on the prevention of child stunting. 
Rwanda  joined  the  Scaling  Up  Nutrition  (SUN)  movement  in  2011  and 
since then several multi-stakeholder platforms have been set up at central 
and  local  level  to  scale  up  nutrition.  The  Inter-Ministerial  Coordination 
Committee  is  the  highest  level  convening  body  under  the  leadership  of 
MOH  and  co-chaired  by  the  Minister  of  Finance  and  the  United  Nations 
Resident Coordinator. The committee brings government and development 
partners  together.  Staff  from  MOH,  MINAGRI  and  MINALOC,  co-chair  the 
Social  Cluster  Food  and  Nutrition  Steering  Committee  (SCF&NSC).  The 
National Food and Nutrition Technical Working Group (NF&NTWG) was set 
up in 2013 and is Rwanda’s multi-sectoral nutrition coordination platform. 
The  NF&NTWG  includes  representation  from  the  SCF&NSC,  donors,  UN 
agencies,  civil  society,  academia  and  the  private  sector.  UN  REACH  is 
working as the convener for the UN Network,  while the Donor Network is 
convened by USAID.

The  National  Strategy  on  Climate  Change  and  Low-Carbon 
Development  (NCCLCD)  for  Green  Growth  and  Climate  Resilience 
underlines  the  need  to  manage  the  implications  of  climate  variability  for 
the social, environmental and economic development of the country. Given 
that  Rwanda  seasonal  agriculture  is  vulnerable  to  climate  change  and 
population pressure, the strategy recognizes that slight changes in rainfall 
patterns would have significant impacts on crop and livestock production. 
The  strategy  promotes  different  agroforestry  species  to  provide  livestock 
fodder.  Agroforestry  has  multiple  additional  benefits,  namely  reduced  soil 
erosion  and  increased  resilience  to  heavy  rains  through  improved  slope 
stability;  water  management  and  nutrient  recycling  which  improve 
agricultural production and carbon sequestration. 
The Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) are built 
upon  the  NCCLCD  and  advocate  for  a  climate  resilient  economy.  The 
framework  aims  at  achieving  Category  2  energy  security  and  low  carbon 
energy  supply  that  supports  the  development  of  green  industry  and 
services,  sustainable 
resource  management, 
appropriate  urban  development  as  well  as  biodiversity  and  ecosystem 
services.  It  also  promotes  the  development  of  decentralised  local-based 
agricultural  processing  centres  that  incorporate  low-carbon  sources  of 
energy, such as biogas-digesters and solar systems.  
land-use  and  water 
The  phase  4  of  the  Strategic  Plan  for  Agricultural  Transformation 
(PSTA  4)  outlines  the  priority  public  investments  in  agriculture  and 
estimates  required  public  resources  for  the  agricultural  sector  for  the 
period  2018/2024.  As  changes  in  weather  and  climate  patterns  are 
becoming  more  acute,  PSTA  4  seeks  to  build  resilience  through  on-farm 
measures  and  enabling  actions  to  increase  productivity.    The  strategy 
promotes  Opportunities  also  exist  to  improve  livestock  productivity. 
Productivity  gains  can  be  realized  by  improving  availability  and  access  to 
good quality (forage, feed, feed formulation, composition) and quantity of 
animal 
feed,  upgrading  genetic  animal  resources,  and  enhancing 
knowledge  regarding  animal  husbandry,  animal  health  and  disease 
management.  
The  Energy  Sector  Strategic  Plan  (ESSP)  for  2018/19-2023/24 
presents the current status of, and plans for,  the energy  sector,  covering 
its  three  subsectors:  electricity,  biomass  and  petroleum.  The  strategy 
intends  to  halve  the  number  of  HH  using  traditional  cooking  technologies 
to achieve a sustainable balance between supply and demand of biomass 
through promotion of most energy efficient technologies.  
4. Environmental and social category  
39. 
The  project  is  considered  to  be  an  Environment  and  Social  category  B.  The 
project is not expected to have any significant adverse environmental or social implications. 
The  project  will  support  small  livestock  value  chains  which  are  adapted  to  the  needs  of 
vulnerable  populations  and  do  not  engender  major  environmental  impact.  Their  feeding 
requirements are lower, feeding habitats are broader while their reproduction rate is higher. 
The  project  will  promote  climate  smart  innovations  and  practices  as  well  as  energy  and 
resources  efficiency  along  the  selected  value  chains,  from  production  to  domestic 
consumption  and  export  markets  (see  section  6  for  more  details  on  recommendation  for 
project design and implementation).

5. Climate risk category  
40. 
The  project's  climate  risk  classification  is  considered  Moderate.  The  project  is 
expected to be moderately sensitive to climate risks given that small livestock are perceived 
to be relatively heat tolerant, disease tolerant and adaptable to adverse weather conditions. 
Emissions  intensities  for  small  livestock  are  lower  than  for  cattle  and  beef  production 
systems. GHG emissions will vary according to the level of infrastructure development along 
the selected value chains. Processing of animals products will increase energy consumption 
as  well  as  produced  wastes.  The  project  will  then  promote  energy  efficiency  through 
adoption of renewable energy and best practices and technologies waste management.   
6. Recommendations for project design and implementation  
6.1. Recommendations for gender, nutrition and youth issues:  
41. 
Geographical  targeting.  Two  development  partners  (USAID/Feed  the  Future  and  the 
Belgian  Development  Agency  -  ENABEL)  are  currently  designing  new  operations  on  small 
livestock  value  chains  in  the  Western  and  Southern  provinces.  Preliminary  consultations 
have  been  carried  out  during  the  project  design  mission  in  order  to  avoid  duplication  and 
overlap  of  the  interventions  in  the  same  areas  and,  in  turn,  seek  to  complement  efforts. 
Consultations between IFAD, MINAGRI, Heifer International and USAID/Feed the Future and 
ENABLE  will  be  conducted  during  the  project  inception  phase  in  order  to  pre-screen  a 
potential list of districts where projects may implement their respective activities, agree on 
the different areas of interventions and define institutional arrangements for their delivery. 
42.  Women’s workload: women’s burden is worsened by the fact that they are involved 
in  doing  routine  type  of  activities,  which  are  labour  intensive  and  time  consuming.  Small 
stock  is  controlled  and  managed  by  women,  traditionally.  It  is  usually  kept  as  a  side 
business. However, to avoid increasing women’s workload with new productive activities, the 
project will have to implement, at the same time, labour saving technologies (e.g. access to 
water) that will directly benefit women (who are those collecting water).  
43. 
Effective  multi-sectoral  coordination  will  need  to  be  ensured  to  work  on  nutrition-
sensitive  interventions  at  the  district  level.  Coordination  and  collaboration  with  DPEMs  is 
envisaged. At the same time, it is recommended to coordinate with the Gender and Family 
promotion  officers  at  the  district  levels,  in  order  to  harmonize  actions  and  complement 
efforts. 
44. 
Entry  points  for  mainstreaming  issues.  Overall,  the  selected  value  chains 
commodities  (small  ruminants,  pigs  and  poultry)  can  greatly  contribute  to  address  key 
constraints  of  poverty  reduction  while  at  the  same  time  offer  opportunities  to  address 
gender, youth and nutrition sensitive related issues by: 
45. 
Targeting  the  most  vulnerable  and  food  insecure  households:  small  livestock  can 
provide  economic  opportunities  especially  to  the  poorest  and  households  with  limited  land 
availability, as raising small stock don’t require big plot sizes. Small livestock can serve as a 
buffer to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in crop production on the availability of food for 
human  consumption  thus  contributing  to  increase  the  resilience  of  the  most  vulnerable 
households. Small livestock can also contribute to food and nutrition security by, indirectly, 
increasing  crop  output  through  providing  manure,  which  is  a  valuable  source  of  organic 
plant nutrients and reduces the need for chemical fertilizers. 
46. 
Promoting  women's  economic  empowerment,  increasing  their  voice  in  decision-
making  and  promoting  a  more  equable  balance  in  workload:  chicken,  pigs  and  small 
93 
Project for Inclusive Small Livestock Markets 
PRISM 
Project Design Report (PDR) 
ruminants are usually controlled and managed by women125. However, women's role is often 
limited to the production side, having women less  opportunities than men to  participate in 
the  whole  value  chain.  Women  also  have  less  decision-making  power  than  men  about  the 
use of income. The project will address gender disparities and the key constraints that limit 
women’s participation in the value chain by: (a) ensuring that women and men have equal 
access to capacity building, training and productive assets, targeting 50% women as direct 
beneficiaries;  (b)  promoting  labour-saving  technologies  that  can  contribute  to  decreasing 
women’s workload (rainwater harvesting facilities at household level); (c) increase women’s 
voice in decision-making; with this aim, gender-related trainings will be carried out at both 
household and group level; (d) increase women’s access to skills and knowledge: women's 
skills  in  financial  literacy,  managing  and  saving  money  will  be  strengthened;  (e)  develop 
skills  to  improve  the  well-being  of  women  and  other  family  members:  with  this  purpose, 
nutrition  education  will  be  provided  at  both  household  and  groups  level;  (f)  train  project 
staff  and  extension  service  providers  on  gender-related  issues.  To  this  aim,  a  Gender 
specialist will be appointed as part of the SPIU staff126.  
Generating  employment  and  economic  opportunities 
for  young  people:  as 
47. 
experiences from the field have demonstrated, small livestock can benefit youth not only as 
producers,  but  also  as  service  providers  and  entrepreneurs:    youth  small  livestock 
production  enterprises  can  serve  as  a  solid  business  incubator  and  accelerator  for  young 
entrepreneurs and youth-own businesses. To strengthen youth’s entrepreneurial capacities, 
the project will partner with the private sector for training and capacity building. 
48. 
Preventing  gender  based  violence  in  the  agricultural  sector:    the  project  will 
contribute  to  reducing  any  harmful  act  based  on  gender  through:  (i)  sensitization  on  the 
importance  of  addressing  GBV,  application  of  IFAD's  no  tolerance  for  Sexual  Harassment 
(SH)  /Sexual  Exploitation  and  Abuse  (SEA)  for  project  staff  and  project's  activities  and 
operations127; (ii) map out and partner with GBV prevention and response actors in project 
adjoining  communities;  (iii)  have  GBV  risks  adequately  reflected  in  all  safeguards 
instruments,  contracts  with  suppliers  and  and  other  third  parties  to  be  funded  with  IFAD 
funds.  
49. 
Improving  nutrition:  The  project  recognizes  that  the  small  livestock  sector  can 
contribute  to  play  an  important  role  in  combatting  malnutrition,  by  both  increasing 
availability  of  animal  source  foods  at  the  household  level  and  increasing  income. 
Nevertheless,  limited  nutrition  knowledge  among  beneficiaries  may  prevent  producers  to 
translate increased production and income into improved diets. The project will contribute to 
improved  nutrition  by  (a)  increasing  availability  of  animal-source  foods  at  the  household 
level  and  promoting  their  consumption;  (b)  increasing  producers'  income  to  purchase 
nutritious  foods  (e.g.  fruits  and  vegetables  which  have  high  prices  on  the  market  and/or 
meat).  To  support beneficiaries in addressing gaps in nutrition knowledge,  the project will 
carry  out  nutrition  education  at  the  household  level  and  with  the  youth  small  livestock 
production enterprises  128. Nutrition will be mainstreamed not only at the production level: 
sanitary  risks  and  food  safety-related  issues  will  be  addressed  (including  improving 
slaughtering and processing facilities and support to enforce sanitary regulations) along the 
125 Agriculture Gender Strategy, 2012.  
126 Targeting approaches and strategies for gender mainstreaming are included in the PIM's dedicated sections. 
127 IFAD  Policy on Preventing and Responding to Sexual Harassment, Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (2018). 
128  For  the  poorest  households  (Ubudehe  category  1  and  2)  nutrition  education  will  be  embedded  into  the  VBHCD  model  implemented  by 
Heifer  International  and  will  include  training  in  nutrition/  dietary  knowledge,  food  handling  and  storage,  cooking  classes  and  practical 
demonstrations  on  how  to  prepare  a  healthy  and  balanced  meal.  In  the  case  of  youth  cooperative,  nutrition  education  will  be  provided  in 
coordination with districts authorities. Additional details on the implementing arrangements for the delivery of nutrition education are included 
in the PIM.

Specialist t as part of the project staff at the central level.  
6.2. Recommendations for mainstreaming environmental management and climate 
change adaptation and mitigation 
50. 
Under  component  1,  sub-component  1.4  on  support  for  climate  smart-  innovations, 
the  project  will  promote  several  activities  for  mainstreaming  environmental  management 
and climate change adaptation and mitigation in order to mitigate potential negative impact 
of  small livestock production intensification. These activities will include: (i) enhanced feed 
efficiency through the promotion of fodder trees and shrub species (agroforestry) and use of 
crop  residues  at  farm  level;  (ii)  manure  management  through  adoption  of  biogas  systems 
and  composting;  (iii)  improved  water  efficiency  through  rainwater  harvesting  facilities 
installed  at  farm  level;  and  (iv)  promotion  of  the  use  of  solar  energy  for  pig  and  poultry 
farms. 
51. 
Under  component  2,  Sub-Component  2.2  on  Market  Facilitation  in  Small  Livestock 
Value Chains the project will support the alignment of the private sector and compliance to 
national  regulations  pertaining  to  water  and  energy  efficiency,  waste  management  (e.g. 
biogas)  and  wastewater  treatment  or  sewerage  facilities  and  adequate  washing  facilities 
(e.g. running cold and hot or warm water) (See Table 2 for further details).

manure and urea into 
energy 
- Small ruminants have the 
advantage of adapting to 
adverse ecology (grazing 
and browsing) in which 
vegetation vary in space and 
time 
- Promotion of agro-forestry 
(fodder trees, shrubs, 
leguminous trees, etc.) to 
improve animal nutrition 
(higher crude protein than 
cereal crop residues which 
are filled with fiber) 
- Valorisation of fats and skins 
- Promotion of energy efficient 
along the processing 
facilities such solar systems 
Ensure animal well-being 
during transportation 
(including ventilation, 
enough floor space, 
adequate floors, high 
sides of the vehicles, 
roofs, access to water, 
avoid animal suffocation, 
heat stress, dehydration, 
etc..) 
-  Slaughter houses/slabs for 
small ruminants must be 
separated from the pigs 
slaughterhouses/slabs for 
hygiene purposes  
- Manure, solid and water 
waste disposal must be 
considered at slaughter 
slabs and houses (including 
effluent treatment facilities) 
-  Biogas plant will be 
promoted at processing 
facilities to avoid water and 
environmental pollution and 
provide energy for heating 
water for hygiene purposes 
- Valorisation of fats and skins

7. Further studies needed  
  Minimum Dietary Diversity Score – Women (MDD-W): at inception phase (baseline study), mid-term and completion, it has been 
included in a separate budget line129. 
 
 EX-ACT shall be included in the baseline survey. The Ex-ACT is a free Tool developed by FAO. However, this requires proper 
collection of data for estimating of the impact of agriculture and forestry development projects, programmes and policies on the 
carbon-balance.

Introduction 
Overview 
1. 
This  draft  Project  Implementation  Manual  (PIM)  provides  guidelines  for  the 
implementation  of  the  IFAD  funded  interventions  under  the  PRISM  partnership 
programme. The PIM elaborates the procedures and processes that are to be followed 
in  the  implementation  of  IFAD  funded  interventions  (the  project)  and  activities  in 
PRISM.  The  PIM  is  an  annex  of  the  Project  Design  Report  (PDR)  and  thus  processes 
and  procedures  presented  in  this  document  are  to  be  read  in  conjunction  with  the 
relevant sections of the main PDR. 
2. 
The  process  presented  here  are  a  framework  that  is  meant  to  assist  the  PRISM 
implementation staff including those from RAB and the District in thinking through the 
processes  for  the  different  sub-components.  It  is  proposed  that  at  startup,  the 
recruited  staff  be  facilitated  to  review  the  activities  and  processes  presented  herein. 
The review would update, refine and firm up the as activities and processes necessary. 
The  value  in  undertaking  such  a  review  would  be  that  through  the  process,  the 
implementing staff would “own” the PIM. Such ownership would ensure that the staff 
would follow the PIM during the implementation of activities. 
Context, justification and rationale 
Small livestock production systems 
3. 
Small  livestock  populations.  Because  of  the  limited  availability  of  agricultural  land 
and  pasture,  livestock  populations  in  Rwanda  are  limited  and  rural  households  give 
priority to crops, in particular food crops. The country is the home of 2,923,706 heads 
of  goats,  664,703  sheep,  1,716,438  pigs  and  5,272,725  chicken130,  for  a  human 
population  of  around  12,5  million  people.  This  represents  a  ratio  of  around  0.3  small 
ruminants and 0.4 chicken per habitant, which is very little compared with countries in 
the Region like Kenya and Uganda which house respectively 1 and 0.45 heads of small 
ruminant per person, and 0,95 and 0,85 heads of poultry per person. In total, 999,000 
households  (59%  of  total)  own  at  least  one  small  livestock  species,  and  503,000 
(30%) do not own livestock at all131.

7. 
Small  ruminants  production  systems.  Small  ruminants  are  found  everywhere  in 
Rwanda, but their concentration varies according to regions. Goats are mostly reared 
in  the  Eastern  Province132  (all  Districts  except  Kayonza),  where  human  population 
densities  are  low  and  rangelands  are  still  available,  but  also  in  all  districts  of  the 
Southern  Province,  that  has  the  highest  concentration  of  this  species.  Sheep  are 
mostly  found  in  the  Northern  Province,  in  high  altitude  Districts  such  as  Musanze, 
Burera and Gakenke.  
For  both  small  ruminant  species,  the  feeding  system  is  based  essentially  on  natural 
pastures:  goats  are  often  tethered  in  marginal  pasture  lands  such  as  roadsides, 
fallows and harvested fields. In high density areas (North) sheep are usually tethered 
but in pastoral areas (East), they  are usually kept with cows. Supplementary  feeding 
of  small  ruminants  with  concentrates  or  cultivated  fodder  is  uncommon,  including  in 
dry season. 
Vaccination and deworming are not  usual in traditional small ruminants systems, and 
as  a  consequence,  the  mortality  of  youth,  affected  by  enterotoxaemia  and  internal 
parasites, can  be very significant reaching 30 to 60 %. The goats are mostly of local 
breed, but some improved breeds have been introduced through several projects since 
the  90s,  both  for  meat  (Boer)  and  milk  (Saanen  and  Alpine).  These  crossbreeding 
attempts  have  been  only  moderately  successful,  mostly  because  of  the  poor  sanitary 
and  feeding  conditions  and  the  poor  resistance  to  sanitary  and  feeding  shocks  of 
imported  breeds.  Goats  are  usually  not  milked  except  in  some  exceptional  cases  for 
malnourished  and  sick  infants  and  children.  Sheep  are  mostly  of  local  breed  (fat 
tailed)  in  low  altitude  and  pastoral  areas,  but  in  high  altitude  areas  (North),  animals 
crossed  with  European  wool  breeds  are  now  common  and  these  crossbreeds  have 
adapted  well.  As  a  result  of  these  poor  feeding  and  health  conditions,  and  limited 
genetic  potential,  the  productivity  of  small  ruminants  remains  generally  low  and  is 
significantly affected in particular by the mortality of young animals. 
Pig  production  systems.    Pig  rearing  was  not  a  traditional  activity  in  Rwanda  and 
has  been  introduced  by  missionaries  during  the  first  half  of  the  20th  century,  which 
explains  that  the  most  important  production  clusters  can  be  found  around  catholic 
congregations, in the South (around Huye), and the North East (around Gicumbi). The 
traditional system is based on utilization of kitchen waste and agricultural by-products 
for  feeding  the  animals,  that  are  also  sometimes  allowed  to  scavenge  around 
households depending on the season. Animals used in these systems are local breeds 
characterized by a very slow growth, limited prolificacy and significant amount of fat. 
This  type  of  production  system  is  mostly  found  in  the  southern  parts  of  the  Eastern 
and Southern Provinces. 
8.  Modern  pig  husbandry  practices  have  been  introduced  recently  to  Rwanda.  Modern 
and  commercially  oriented  systems  are  found  mostly  in  the  northern  part  of  the 
country around Gicumbi, Musanze and Rubavu. In this system, animals are usually of 
imported  breeds  (Landrace,  Pietrain,  Large  White),  or  crossed,  and  are  kept  in 
claustration, fed with concentrate  feed  often combined with agroindustry by-products 
such as brewery waste, or restaurant waste. A few specialized breeders have emerged 
132 Geographic distribution by species are extracted from the 2008 agricultural survey 
110

Project Implementation Manual (DRAFT) 
recently,  who  supply  piglets  to  fatteners.  There  is  no  national  breeding  programme 
and  no  nationwide  organized  service  delivery  system  for  artificial insemination in  the 
country,  despite  the  increasing  demand  for  quality  animals.  The  main  animal  health 
problem  affecting  pigs  in  Rwanda  are  piglet  scours  and  swine  erysipelas.  Swine 
erysipelas  mainly  affects  the  improved  breeds  and  crossbreeds  and  can  lead  to 
mortality  rates  of  30%  in  young  animals.  The  vaccine  exists  but  are  not  easily 
available in Rwanda. 
9. 
Poultry  production  systems.  Ttwo  very  distinct  poultry  production systems  coexist 
in Rwanda, the traditional backyard dual purpose production system, and the modern 
commercial poultry systems. 
10.  Only 448,000 rural household (26% of total) own chicken133, which is surprisingly low 
compared with the proportion of households owning other small livestock species (pig 
and  small  ruminants  -  52%);  the  common  adage  saying  that  every  rural  household 
owns  chicken  in  Rwanda  is  therefore  far  from  reality.  Backyard  chicken  are  dual 
purpose  (egg  and  meat)  but  their  productivity  is  very  low  because  of  the  genetic 
potential  of  the  local  breed,  but  also  because  of  the  sanitary  problems  (Newcastle 
disease is the most important poultry disease in rural areas, leading to mortality rates 
of  chicks  of  50%  and  above).  Vaccines  against  Newcastle  Disease  are  available  in 
Rwanda,  but  not  easily  accessible  in  remote  rural  areas  and  for  farmers  with  only  a 
handful of birds. 
11.  Commercial  modern  layers  and  broilers  farms  have  emerged  during  the  last  decade. 
These  farms  are  often  owned  by  large  scale  investors  for  the  biggest  units,  and  by 
urban  households  looking  for  investment  opportunities.  These  farms  use  imported 
hybrid  birds,  and  the  production  itineraries  are  intensive  and  based  on  global 
practices. Their productivity is therefore high and comparable to global references. The 
feed used is these systems is industrial and either produced at the farm for the bigger 
integrated units or purchased from specialized feed manufacturers for others. The size 
of  these  units  varies  from  100  to  60,000  birds:  the  very  small  units  are  often  out-
growers  of  bigger  units.  Modern  poultry  farms  are  mostly  located  in  Bugesera, 
Nyagatare  and  neighbouring  districts.  These  systems  usually  have  strict  and  well 
managed prophylactic programmes and are not subject to major sanitary problems. 
12.  Animal  health.    The  main  endemic  diseases134  affecting  small  livestock  systems  in 
Rwanda are  Newcastle disease in backyard chicken systems, swine erysipelas in rural 
pig systems and enterotoxaemia and internal parasites in small ruminants systems. All 
could  be  controlled  through  vaccination  (and  deworming  for  parasites)  but  there  are 
no  systematic  vaccination  campaigns  against  these  3  diseases  organized  in  the 
country,  mostly  because  of  the  inadequate  human  and  financial  resources  of  public 
veterinary  services,  that  logically  prioritize  and  focus  their  efforts  on  the  large 
ruminants and in particular the high potential dairy animals.  
13.  Thanks  to  a  well-managed  veterinary  public  health  policy,  to  the  limited  and  well 
controlled  cross  border  movements  of  animals,  the  country  has  been  spared  from 
major transboundary animal diseases  (TADs); TADs thus do not have a major impact 
133 National agricultural census; 2008 
134 An endemic disease is a disease that is always present in a certain population or region 
111 
Rwanda

on  small  livestock  in  the  country,  as  it  is  the  case  of  most  neighboring  countries. 
However, for each species (small ruminants, pork and poultry), the risk of introduction 
of  major  and  deadly  TAD  is  significant:  these  diseases  are  in  particular:  Peste  des 
Petits  Ruminants  (PPR)  for  goats  and  sheep,  African  Swine  Fever  (ASF)  for  pigs,  and 
Highly  Pathogenic  Avian  Influenza  (HPAI)  for  poultry.  All  these  transboundary  animal 
diseases are present in neighbouring countries and could be accidently (re)introduced, 
leading to major catastrophes. Rift Valley fever affecting all ruminants including sheep 
and goats, which is a climate related disease and a zoonosis, could also re-emerge in 
case of massive flooding. 
14.  Genetics.  Unlike the dairy sector for which the Ministry of Agriculture, through RAB, 
provides  artificial  insemination  and  breeding  services,  breeding,  dissemination  of 
improved  small  livestock  breeds  and  provision  of  AI  services  (for  pigs)  is  mostly 
undertaken  under  the  leadership  of  the  private  sector;  However,  RAB  does  provide 
some  sort  of  institutional  support  to  these  actors.  For  pigs,  exotic  breeds  are  being 
imported  sporadically  by  private  investors,  with  the  support  of  RAB,  but  this  genetic 
material is mostly disseminated in the commercial intensive farms and does not reach 
the  rural  family  systems  which  mostly  relies  on  local  breeds.  For  rural  poultry,  Sasso 
hybrids  are  being  imported  and  disseminated  by  a  private  investor  (Uzima  chicken). 
This strain is adapted to rural conditions and has much better performances than the 
local  chicken,  but  it  is  a  hybrid  which  implies  that  the  birds  are  not  supposed  to  be 
kept  for  breeding;  their  feeding  and  health  requirements  are  also  still  high  and 
challenging  for  rural  households.  For  small  ruminants,  RAB  owns  and  manages  a 
station  in  Nyagatare  district  dedicated  to  goat  breeding.  This  station  regularly 
distributes offspring to  farmers (imported  Boer Goat and Saanen breed).  In addition, 
various  development  partners  implemented  and  disseminated  exotic  animals  (both 
goats  and  sheep),  but  in  a  sporadic  manner  and  without  long  term  and  harmonized 
strategy. 
Access to services, inputs and markets 
15.  Inputs  and  services.  Rwanda  is  a  small  country  with  an  excellent  road  network 
which facilitates access to services and inputs. For monogastric animals, the essential 
inputs are feed and chicks/piglets. The main ingredient for animal feed is maize. Maize 
represents 60% of the volume and 45% of the cost of feed. The second ingredient is 
soya  that  accounts  for  about  20%  of  the  feed  product135.  Maize  and  soya  are  used 
both  for  human  food  and  the  animal  feed  industry,  and  the  local  production  cannot 
satisfy  the  growing  local  demand;  raw  materials  have  thus  to  be  sourced  from 
Uganda, Zambia and Tanzania, and their price is highly volatile, depending on weather 
conditions, but also geopolitical events (such as border closures)136. Besides, Rwanda 
is  facing  serious  problems  of  aflatoxin  contamination  in  its  maize  production,  with 
levels  often  exceeding  the  international  standards  of  10-20  ppb137.  According  to  RAB 
authorities and the feed manufacturers themselves, there is a particular need to better 
control the quality of maize ingredients that enter into the composition of animal feed.

136 At the time of the design mission the price of soya had jumped from RWF 400 to RWF 550/kg in less than a year, 
resulting in a 20% increase in the price of animal feed (now sold at an average price of RWF 350/kg).

16.  There are now 7 main animal feed producers in the country, with production capacity 
ranging  from  30  to  40  MT  per  day.  None  of  these  companies  run  at  full  capacity 
(average 50-60%); poultry feed represents over 80% of their sales; and the demand 
for pig and dairy feed remains very low. Some of these animal feed manufacturers are 
at  the  same  time  either  large-scale  producers  of  chicken138,  or  processors/buyers139. 
The  recently  privatized  National  Hatchery  and  private  company  Easy  Hatch  are  the 
major suppliers of Day Old Chicks (DOC), but the country still relies heavily on imports 
from Europe, Kenya, Uganda or South Africa, and other players140 are also considering 
investing in this segment of the value chain. It is worth noting that in parallel to the 
Rwanda  Poultry  Industry  Association,  the  animal  feed  manufacturers  have  recently 
created their  own body, the Rwanda Animal Feeds Association. De facto, the Rwanda 
poultry value chain is mostly driven by its input suppliers and the project will strive to 
engage  these  key  private  actors  through  productive  alliances  with  target  smallholder 
farmers, building up on arrangements that are already often used in Rwanda by feed 
manufacturers to expand their customer outreach.  
17. 
In  the  pig  value  chain,  there  are  limited  actors  apart  from  the  Rwanda  Pig  Farmers 
Association  whose  members  are  mostly  medium-large  producers  who  may  also 
provide  support  in  the  form  of  technical  advice  and  business  plan  development  for 
would-be  pig  producers.  Availability  of  good  quality  piglets  and  gilts  is  a  major  issue 
since  there  are  very  few  specialized  breeders  with  good  genetic  material  on  the 
market. Small pig producers rarely resort to industrial pig feed mostly because they do 
not  have  the  opportunity  to  make  a  proper  cost-benefit  analysis  and  will  rather 
privilege  low  cost,  home-made  feed.  Productive  alliances  with  input  suppliers  would 
also  benefit  small  pig  producers,  and  the  project  should  build  on  the  partnership 
models already initiated in the poultry sub-sector. 
18.  Slaughtering  and  processing  facilities  for  small  ruminants,  poultry  and  pigs  are 
either  inadequate  or  inexistent,  except  for  some  major  poultry  producers  who  have 
established  their  own  abattoirs  (see  above).  The  small  ruminants  value  chains  in 
particular  are  still  rudimentarily  organized  and  sales  are  mostly  done  through 
middlemen at farmgate or local animal markets (see below). The 7 national abattoirs 
registered  by  RAB  for  beef  and  small  ruminants  are  all  privately  owned,  and  operate 
on  average  at  17%  capacity  for  small  ruminants141.  At  district  level  only  3  abattoirs 
are  considered  in  good  condition,  able  to  be  upgraded  to  national  level  with  minimal 
improvements.  Other  several  small  abattoirs  and  slaughterhouses  exist  in  different 
places  to  serve  the  local  population  (small  commercial  centers  operated  by  either 
private  entities  or  cooperatives)  but  they  are  not  allowed  to  transport/sell  the  meat 
beyond their location. There is in particular a crucial lack of pig slaughter  slabs, with 
only  a  handful  of  them  “accredited”  in  Kigali,  Bugesera  and  Rubavu.  The  project  will 
thus  contribute  to  the  development  of  pig  slaughtering  facilities  that  can  be  easily 
accessed  by  smallholder  producers:  a  target  of  7  pig  slaughter  slabs  has  been  set  in 
PRISM, to be strategically located in districts with high concentration of pig production.

19.  Livestock markets. According to the report on “Strategy for Rwanda Meat Exports to 
DRC” (2016), there are 64 livestock markets distributed in the three target provinces 
(North,  West  and  South),  where  an  estimated  27,620  goats  and  sheep  and  25,920 
pigs  are  sold  every  month.  This  report  highlights  the  fact  that  “there  is  no  link 
between Rwanda abattoirs and these markets. Livestock is sold to the highest bidder, 
who happen, in most cases to be DRC livestock importers”. Indeed all of these markets 
lack  basic  infrastructure  for  animal  holding,  and  do  not  meet  sanitary  standards  that 
are  supportive  of  meat  industry.  The  project  can  thus  play  an  important  role  in 
upgrading  at  least  on  market  per  district  through  the  provision  of  relevant 
infrastructure  (sheds  and  sanitary  facilities),  environmental  standards  and  animal 
health care services that befit animal holding grounds. 
20.  Market  demand.  The  consumption  of  small livestock  products  is  still  low  in  Rwanda 
compared to other countries in the region: 0.7 kg per year per capita for white meat 
(poultry + pork) and 0.6 kg for eggs. However, the rapid urbanization and emergence 
of  a  middle  class  will  inevitably  lead  to  an  increase  in  the  consumption  of  these 
products.  Between  2000  and  2017,  according  to  FAO,  the  domestic  consumption  per 
capita  has  grown  by  688%  for  poultry  meat,  79%  for  pig  meat,  and  111%  for  small 
ruminants meat. Furthermore, the low level of urbanization of Rwanda is compensated 
by  the  presence,  at  its  doorstep,  of  two  significant  urban  centers:  Goma  (1.2  M 
people)  and  Bukavu  (0.9  M).  Every  month,  36,670  heads  of  small  ruminants,  and 
25,920 heads of pigs are exported to DRC. The value of small stock exported to DRC 
has raised by 27% between 2010 and 2015 , and by 140% for pig only over the same 
period, and this market is likely to keep growing in the near future. 
21.  As  for  the  eggs,  domestic  demand  in  Rwanda  totaled  13,200  tons  in  2015,  of  which 
7,500 MT were produced in Rwanda. A further 7,900 tons was imported, mainly from 
Uganda,  and  2,200  tons  exported,  mainly  to  the  DRC’s  Kivu  provinces.  Rwanda’s 
annual  trade  deficit  of  eggs  is  therefore  5,700  tons  –  equivalent  to  43%  of  domestic 
demand (or 87.7 million eggs)142.  The FAO 2015 report  also highlighted the fact that 
when  it  comes  to  supplying  supermarkets  and  hotels,  Rwandan  producers  of  quality 
chicken-meat find it difficult to compete with poultry meat sourced from South Africa 
and  Kenya,  where  producers/suppliers  have  demonstrated  greater  reliability  in 
meeting  specifications  regarding  slaughtering,  weight,  supply  period  and  quantity. 
There is thus a wide scope for improvement through targeted support to both poultry 
meat producers and processors in Rwanda. 
22.  However, detailed market information on  small livestock  value chains  are insufficient, 
especially  those  related  to  market  demand.  To  respond  to  this  gap,  several  market 
appraisal  studies  will  be  conducted  in  the  scope  of  the  programme  (see  sub-
component 2.2 below). 
Access to financial and insurance services 
23.  The Rwandan financial sector is characterized by a high level of financial inclusion 
(89%  of  the  population  having  access  to  formal  and  informal  financial  services, 
142 Source: FAO, 2015. Study of the poultry industry in Rwanda  
114 
Rwanda

Project Implementation Manual (DRAFT) 
compared with 85% in Kenya)143, and diversified players in the market (Banks, MFIs, 
SACCOs,  Informal  systems  like  VSLAs)  with  a  dense  branch  networks,  including 
banking  agents144.  Agriculture  remains  largely  underfinanced,  but  there  is  a  growing 
interest  from  the  financial  sector  to  venture  into  agricultural  finance  including  for 
smallholder  farmers.  Some  commercial  banks  and  MFIs  have  set  up  specialized 
agricultural  finance  units,  usually  with  support  from  partners  like  AFR,  IMSAR,  and 
ICCO Terrafina. 
24.  The  formal  financial  institutions  that  do  currently  have  an  agricultural  loan  portfolio 
propose  flexible  cash  flow  based  products  adapted  to  specificities  of  agriculture,  and 
can  offer  short  term  loans  for  working  capital  as  well  as  mid-term  loans  for 
investments.  Interest  rates  range  from  16  to  24%  depending  on  the  institutions  and 
risk  assessment.  Different  collaterals  and  risk  mitigation  instruments  are  used  like 
cash  collateral,  land  title,  other  non-movable  assets,  group  social  guarantee,  crop  or 
dairy  cow  insurance,  and  financial  institutions  may  also  access  guarantee  from  BDF, 
and  possibly  in  the  near  future  from  the  Agricultural  Risk  Sharing  and  Financing 
Facility.  There  is  also  a  growing  tendency  for  banks  to  mitigate  risk  of  lending  to 
smallholder  farmers  by  building  on  linkages  between  agribusiness  companies  and 
smallholder farmers through various arrangements involving secured access to inputs, 
technical support and access to market (Agricultural Value Chain Financing Approach: 
AVCF). 
25.  However,  these  positive  developments  for  smallholder  farmers  concern  mostly  crops 
like maize, rice, Irish potato, horticulture and export crops like coffee and tea, as well 
as dairy in the livestock sector to some extent. For the small livestock sector, financial 
institutions already finance mostly big commercial farmers, feed  factories, processing 
factories  and  off-takers  in  poultry  and  pig  sub  sectors.  Loans  to  small  farmers  exist 
but  mostly  for  salaried  people  (e.g.  teachers,  veterinarians).  Financial  institutions 
already engaged in agricultural finance have shown an interest for the small livestock 
sector, especially poultry and to a lesser extent pig, but they acknowledge that lack of 
understanding of the sector and of its specific risks impede their engagement.  
26. 
In this context, there is a clear rationale for the Project to provide technical assistance 
to interested financial institutions to better understand the small livestock value chains 
and for the design of adapted products and delivery channels, that should be based on 
AVCF approach for adequate risk mitigation. To ensure  complementarity with existing 
interventions and quick results, the Project should support in priority banks and MFIs 
that  have  already  set  up  an  agricultural  finance  unit.  Specific  support  should  also  be 
provided to selected SACCOs considering their presence in all geographical sectors and 
their high penetration rate, and strong support from the GoR for their development. 
143 Finscope Rwanda 2016. High financial inclusion is largely driven by Umurenge SACCOs, promoted by the GoR 
and operating in all administrative sectors, and mobile money providers. 
144  The  Rwanda  financial  sector  comprises  of  11  commercial  banks,  4  microfinance  banks,  1  development  bank, 
and  1  cooperative  bank.  The  microfinance  sector  counted  472  MFIs,  including  SACCOs.  The  financial  sector  also 
includes 16 insurance companies as well, of which 10 are general insurance companies (4 engaged in agricultural 
insurance),  4  life  insurance  companies  and  2  public  medical  insurers.  Brokers  and  agents  support  the  insurance 
sector,  including  one  agent  –  ACRE  Africa  -  specializing  in  agricultural  insurance  technical  and  implementation 
services and providing support to most insurers involved in agriculture.

27. 
In  addition  to  technical  assistance,  the  Project  may  provide  matching  grants  to 
incentivize  and  facilitate  access  to  investment  finance  for  high  risk  borrowers  like 
youths  and  start-up  businesses, 
is  no  assurance  before 
for  which 
implementation that financial institutions would take full risk. Matching grants will also 
be justified as an incentive for private actors for the development of networks of small 
scale  farmers  to  secure  their  customer  or  supplier  base,  and  for  public  good  related 
investments in essential equipment meant to improve food safety, animal welfare and 
climate-smart upgrading of their facilities, conditional upon their sourcing from project 
beneficiaries.  
there 
28.  Small  Livestock  Insurance.  Another  financial  risk  management  tool  which  will  be 
supported  by  the  project  in  order  to  incentivize  MFIs  and  banks  to  better  serve  the 
small livestock  sector is insurance.  MFIs and banks  engaged in agricultural lending145 
confirmed they have existing relationships with insurers and, where suitable products 
exist,  they  opt  to  bundle  agricultural  insurance  with  credit  in  order  to  lend  to 
traditionally  high-risk  clients.  Crop  insurance  and  dairy  cow  insurance  are  already 
operational  in  Rwanda146  and  are  due  to  be  scaled-up  under  a  National  Agricultural 
Insurance Scheme from 2019. However, as with the rest of the financial sector, there 
is little knowledge amongst insurers about small livestock value chains and even more 
so about how to best serve smallholders and their related organizations within them.  
29.  Finally,  several  private  organizations  are  currently  developing  financial  innovations 
through digitalization of the transactions and operations to contribute to reducing cost 
and risk of reaching out to smallholder farmers and improve quality of service for the 
latter.  These  innovations  are  mostly  developed  for  crops,  and  there  is  a  rationale  to 
support  adaptations  of  these  innovations  for  the  small  livestock  sector,  on  a  cost 
sharing basis to incentivize these organizations to venture into these value chains. 
Institutions and policies 
30.  National  public  institutions.  In  Rwanda,  both  agriculture  and  livestock  are  placed 
under  the  authority  of  the  same  ministry:  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Animal 
Resources  (MINAGRI).  The  Directorate  General  of  Animal  Resources  Development  is 
one of the 4 Directorates in the Ministry. One of the mandates of the Ministry and the 
directorate is to elaborate and monitor policies, strategies, guidelines and instructions 
aimed at improving animal resources in the country. The Ministry does not implement 
activities  directly,  but  the  specialized  implementing  agencies  are  placed  under  its 
authority. 
31. 
 Rwanda  Agriculture  and  Animal  Resources  Development  Board  (RAB)  is  the 
main implementing  agency  of  the  MINAGRI.  It  is in  charge  both  of  the  development, 
extension  and  research,  in  all  agricultural  sectors.  The  Department  of  Animal 
Resources  of  RAB  is  in  charge  of  livestock.  For  the  livestock  sub  sector,  its  main 
145 MFIs and Banks spoken to by the design team. 
146  Experience  with  crop  insurance  includes  multi-peril  crop  insurance,  area-yield  index  insurance,  and  weather 
index insurance. Dairy cow insurance has been offered in the past for health, and is being scaled-up for mortality. 
Overall,  general  insurance  penetration  is  currently  low  at  approximately  2.5%  not  counting  the  national  health 
insurance scheme. However, the National Agricultural Insurance Scheme is set to increase this penetration rate. 
116 
Rwanda

activities are provision of veterinary services, extension and research, and AI services 
for cattle. While RAB activities in the livestock sector are mostly focused on the dairy 
sector  which  has  received  a  lot  of  attention  over  the  last  decades,  RAB  human 
resources specialized in small livestock species remain insufficient.  
32.  Decentralized  public  institutions.  The  Districts  are  in  charge  of  delivering  animal 
health  services  and  livestock  related  extension  services  to  the  communities.  The 
livestock  dedicated  district  field  staff  are  under  the  responsibility  of  District  Animal 
Resource Officers (DARO - most of the time veterinarians) and are composed of sector 
veterinary and animal production technicians. These civil servants are not supposed to 
deliver  private  veterinary  services  but  because  of  the  insufficient  presence  of  private 
service  providers  in  rural  areas,  they  combine  public  and  private  missions.  However, 
because  of  their  restricted  number  and  lack  of  training  on  small  livestock  production 
systems,  they  focus  and  prioritize  their  support  and  services  delivery  to  the  dairy 
cattle owners.  
33.  Farmers  organizations.  Unlike  the  dairy  sector  which  is  well  structured,  there  are 
very few formal farmers organizations in the small livestock sector, and none for small 
ruminants. In the poultry sector, the Rwanda Poultry Industry Association (RPIA) is the 
main  producers  umbrella  organization.  It  was  initially  established  as  a  value  chain 
organization  gathering  all  categories  of  value  chain  actors,  but  it  is  now  mostly 
composed of producers, mainly medium and large scale farmers (above 1,000 birds). 
The  association  however  envisages  to  broaden  its  membership  to  smaller  farmers 
(between  300  and  1,000  birds).  This  organization  is  mostly  active  in  advocacy  and 
lobbying,  information  sharing  and  training  of  members.  It  is  worth  to  note  that  the 
Association  is  frequently  consulted  by  the  Government  on  issues  related  to  the  sub-
sector  and  involved  as  well  in  policy  formulation  processes.  According  to  RPIA,  only 
one local cooperative of poultry farmers exists in the Country (in Rwamagana). In the 
pig  sector,  the  Rwanda  Pig  Farmers  Association  (RPFA)  is  the  main  stakeholder 
organization;  it  gathers  mostly  commercial  pig  farmers  (90  members).  Its  main 
activities  are  the  organization  of  capacity  building  and  information  sharing  events. 
There  is  no  commodity  based  stakeholder  platforms  in  the  small  livestock  value 
chains, but this model exists in Rwanda for other value chains (crops, and dairy). 
34.  Relevant  national  strategies,  policies  and  programmes.  Rwanda’s  long-term 
development goals are defined in the Vision 2020 and Vision 2050 documents that aim 
to  transform  the  country  from  a  low-income  agriculture-based  economy  into  a 
knowledge-based,  service-oriented  economy  with  middle-income  status.  The  National 
Strategy  for  Transformation  (NST  1)  follows  the  Economic  Development  and  Poverty 
Reduction Strategy 2 (EPRDS 2). NST 1 integrates international commitments deriving 
from  the  UN  Sustainable  Development  Goals  (SDGs);  African  Union  (AU)  Agenda 
2063;  East  African  Community  (EAC)  Vision  2050  focusing  on  job  creation;  and  COP 
agreements on climate change. 
35.  Rwanda’s  Strategic  Plan  for  the  Transformation  of  Agriculture  (PSTA  4)  -  the 
Government's  flagship  investment  programme  for  the  sector  -  outlines  the  priority 
public  investments  in  agriculture  and  estimates  the  required  public  resources  for  the 
sector  for  the  period  2018-2024.  Though  PSTA  4  focuses  on  public  investments,  it 
recognizes  that  agricultural  growth  must  be  driven  by  private  sector  investment, 
including farmers, with government becoming a market enabler rather than a market 
117

Project Implementation Manual (DRAFT) 
actor.  PSTA4  introduces  improved  nutrition  amongst  its  priority  areas  and  outcomes 
and nutrition-sensitive agriculture as one of the main interventions. 
36.  At the continental and regional level, the PSTA 4 constitutes Rwanda’s commitment to 
the  African  Union’s  Comprehensive  African  Agriculture  Development  Programme 
(CAADP). Under this framework, the Malabo Declaration 2014  sets specific targets on 
the  agriculture  sector’s  contribution  to  economic  growth,  economic  opportunities, 
nutrition and food security, and resilience. Rwanda is the top performer in the level of 
progress vis-à-vis these targets.  
37.  The Government of Rwanda (GoR) in partnership with World Bank is implementing the 
2nd Programme for Results (PforR) in agriculture (2018–2021) in support of PSTA 4. A 
PforR Multi-Donor Trust Fund (PforR-MDTF) has been established to finance PforR and 
to provide the required technical assistance and institutional support. 
38.  The  National  Strategy  on  Climate  Change  and  Low-Carbon  Development  (NCCLCD) 
underlines the need to manage the climate variability for the social, environmental and 
economic  development  of  the  country.  The  Intended  Nationally  Determined 
Contributions  (INDCs)  are  built  upon  the  NCCLCD  and  aim  at  achieving  Category  2 
energy  security  and  supports  the  development  of  green  industry  and  services, 
sustainable  land  and  water  management,  urban  development,  biodiversity  and 
ecosystem services. 
39.  The  overarching  strategic  framework  guiding  the  development  of  the  livestock  sector 
in  Rwanda  is  the  Livestock  Master  Plan  (LMP).  The  LMP  was  developed  in  2017, 
following  the  implementation  of  a  Livestock  Sector  Analysis  (LSA)  2017.  The  LMP 
covers a five-year period (2017-2022) and comprises of six sub-sectorial master plans 
for  dairy,  red  meat,  chicken  and  pork.  For  small  livestock  specifically,  a  strategy  and 
investment plan for small animal industry was developed in 2012 but has now expired 
and would require a review and update. 
Programme structure and partnership principles 
PRISM is a partnership programme implemented by RAB, and jointly supported by IFAD and 
ENABEL,  with  Heifer  International  as  implementing  partner  and  co-financer,  and  VSF 
Belgium  as  implementing  partner  (see  figure  below).  PRISM  is  constituted  of  two 
complementary  interventions  (projects),  supported  respectively  by  IFAD  and  ENABEL, 
whose  content  and  strategies  have  been  aligned,  and  which  will  be  implemented  jointly 
under  a  common  implementation  mechanism.  Heifer  will  implement  activities  in  the 
framework  of  the  IFAD  supported  intervention,  and  VSFB  will  contribute  to  the 
implementation of some ENABEL supported activities. In addition of being an implementing 
partner,  Heifer  is  also  a  co-financer  of  the  activities  its  implements,  whichi  is  not  the  case 
for VSFB. RAB/SPIU will implement activities under both interventions.

40.  The  two  projects  have  initially  been  designed  separately  but  have  been  harmonized 
and aligned under the same partnership programme later on. This alignment has been 
done  in  accordance  with  the  respective  mandates  of  the  agencies,  their  comparative 
advantages and the nature of the financing (grant for ENABEL, loan for IFAD), that led 
to the following principles: 
 
 
 
 
 
At production level, IFAD-supported interventions will target preferentially 
smallholder livestock holdings and vulnerable households, and ENABEL will 
engage and support larger scale commercial and industrial actors 
In terms of geographical repartition, IFAD-supported interventions will focus on 
Districts that are the most affected by poverty and malnutrition 
In terms of value chains, IFAD-supported interventions will target mainly the 
small ruminants and backyard chicken value chains, that correspond to its 
priority target groups, when ENABEL will concentrate on pig and poultry 
commercial value chains (also targeted by IFAD) 
ENABEL will provide support to large scale private businesses (feed 
manufacturers, hatcheries, processors) in the pig and poultry value chains 
IFAD-supported interventions will also support public investments and public 
institutions, in particular in the domain of veterinary public health 
41.  The  screening  of  respective  project  activities  and  the  application  of  the  above 
principles  has  resulted  in  four  different  harmonization  scenarios  depending  on 
activities: 
 
 
 
In case an activity was initially foreseen by only one partner, it will remain under 
his responsibility 
In case similar field level activities had been planned for by the two partners, but 
with different modalities or methodological approaches (e.g. group mobilization 
and capacity building through FFS for ENABEL, and through Heifer VBHCD for 
IFAD), it was agreed to implement both approaches in parallel but in different 
areas, in order to compare methodologies and share lessons 
Finally, for activities that had been planned on both sides and could potentially 
overlap, two options could apply (i) one partner could delegate the entire 
responsibility to the other, based on comparative advantages and mandates, or 
(ii)  the activity could be implemented jointly (this will be the case for instance 
for policy support)

43.  The  content  of  the  section  below  focuses  mostly  on  the  description  of  the  IFAD 
supported  interventions,  but  it  also  reflects  the  ENABEL  contribution  and  the 
partnership modalities for each activity, in order to highlight the complementarities. 
Programme development objective 
44.  Programme overall objective. The overall objective of the programme is to reduce 
poverty  by  empowering  poor  rural  men,  women  and  youth  to  participate  in  the 
transformation  of  the  Rwanda  livestock  sector  and  to  enhance  their  resilience. 
Specifically, the project seeks to increase competitiveness and profitability of the small 
livestock  sector  for  the  provision  of  quality  products  from  smallholder  producers  to 
domestic and regional consumers. 
45.  Programme  development  objective.  The  PDO  is  to  “Improve  food  and  nutrition 
security  and  incomes  of  poor  rural  households  through  better  performance  of  the 
targeted value chains”. 
Programme Approach 
46.  The programme builds upon a combination of new and tested approaches. It builds on 
the  successful  implementation  of  IFAD-funded  interventions  (the  project)  and  on 
lessons  learnt  from  their  inclusive  development  approaches.  In  terms  of  project 
management,  the  project  maintains  the  same  implementation  structure  through  the 
Single Project Implementation Unit, but with joint arrangements with ENABEL such as 
common  project  team,  and  common  planning  and  implementation  mechanisms.  In 
addition to the partnership with ENABEL, there are also other new elements introduced 
by  the  programme,  such  as  the  pro-poor  approach  through  a  graduation  pathway 
aimed  at  extremely  poor  households,  and  the  productive  alliances  promoted  with 
Rwandan  input  suppliers  who  are  actively  involved  in  the  development  of  small 
livestock value chains. 
47.  By  improving  the  competitiveness  of  small  livestock  smallholder  production  systems, 
the  programme  aims  to  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  and  improved  nutrition.  The 
strengthened access to markets for producers will increase  both availability of animal 
source foods and producers' income.

48.  Three  main  categories  of  beneficiaries  will  be  targeted  through  complementary 
approaches  meant  to  support  their  participation  in  commercial  and  inclusive  value 
chains: 
 
 
 
 
For  extremely  poor  and  poor  rural  households,  the  project  will  target  the 
backyard poultry value chain, the family pig production and the small ruminants 
production. For these beneficiaries, the project will deploy a pro-poor graduation 
pathway  aimed  at  addressing  community  development  through  an  integrated 
and  holistic  approach.  Through  this  approach,  it  is  expected  to  improve  the 
performance of livestock managed at the household level, increase availability of 
animal  source  foods  and  improve  nutrition,  reduce  gender  inequalities,  and 
ultimately increase income generation and market access. 
For  unemployed  rural  youth,  a  specific  support  package  including  group 
formation,  initial  technical  and  managerial  training,  provision  of  business 
development  services,  and  assets  building  will  be  provided.  The  targeted 
productions  will  be  commercial  poultry  (layers  and  broilers),  and  pig  (breeding 
and fattening). These productions are particularly well adapted to youth because 
they  require  a  very  limited  amount  of  land,  limited  investment  and  they  can 
provide  a  very  good  and  quick  return  on  investment,  which  is  what  the  youth 
look for. 
The 
in  a  more 
entrepreneurial  logic  in  the  commercial  poultry  and  pig  value  chains  will  be 
supported  through  a  combination  of  technical,  business  and  financial  capacity 
building  combined  with  backward  and  forward  market  facilitation.  This  will  be 
provided in the scope  of innovative value chain arrangements that facilitate the 
inclusion of smallholder farmers in commercial small livestock value chains.  
While  the  three  categories  of  actors  above  will  be  targeted  through  both  the 
ENABEL  and  IFAD  supported  interventions,  the  industrial  producers  and  private 
sector actors such as feed millers, hatchers and breeders will be targeted trough 
the ENABEL supported interventions. 
that  are  already  engaged 
less  vulnerable  producers 
49.  At production level, the first step for some of the beneficiary groups (in particular the 
most  vulnerable  rural  households  and  the  youth)  will  be  to  establish  the  production 
units: for the rural poor, this will be achieved through the provision of a startup asset 
building  package  composed  of  animals,  materials  for  the  poultry/goat  house,  and 
inputs  for  a  startup  period.  For  these  households,  this  package  will  be  provided 
without  financial  contribution  from  the  recipient,  but  beneficiaries  will  be  required  to 
“pass  on  the  gift”  (give  animals)  to  other  beneficiary  households.  For  youth,  the 
project will also provide the assets and inputs required for startup, but the beneficiary 
will contribute to the costs by contracting a bank loan that will partially cover the cost 
investment. For other producers of the third category above, the project will facilitate 
access  to  startup  or  extension  capital  through  intensive  engagement  with  financial 
institutions, mobilization of contributions from the private sector and the beneficiaries, 
and limited project grants. 
50. 
In  parallel  with  the  setting  up  of  the  production  units,  the  project  will  enable  the 
beneficiaries  to  properly  manage  their  livestock  unit:  the  capacity  building  activities 
will therefore both address technical issues (health and hygiene management, feeding, 
reproduction)  and  management  related  matters  (financial  management,  marketing). 
122 
Rwanda

Project Implementation Manual (DRAFT) 
After  the  initial  training,  the  beneficiaries  will  be  followed  by  community  facilitators 
(for rural households) or business coaches (for the youth or producers involved in the 
productive  alliances),  that  will  provide  continuous  capacity  building  and  coaching  on 
both technical and business management issues. Furthermore, nutrition education and 
gender awareness training will be provided at both household and cooperative level to 
ensure  that,  on  the  one  hand,  increasing  in  production  and  income  would  translate 
into  improved  diets  and  that,  on  the  other  hand,  workload  and  benefits  will  be 
equitably shared amongst female and male producers.  
51.  On the production aspects, the project will also ensure that beneficiaries: 
 
 
 
 
 
access to proximity veterinary services through the establishment of a network 
of community veterinary practitioners; 
are protected against the main animal health risks, through improved 
surveillance and establishment of a diseases contingency mechanism; 
and access good quality genetic material to improve the performance of their 
flocks, through professional private breeders; 
access to locally produced fodder and feed and;  
improve the management of farm effluents, as well as the utilization of 
renewable sources of energy (biogas solar). 
52.  The  project  will  address  the  problem  of  dependency  of  the  domestic  poultry  and  pig 
value chains on imported feed and imported raw material, by contributing to building a 
strong  domestic  feed  value  chain  based  on  a  basis  a  smallholder  producer  of  maize 
and soya, connected to feed manufacturers through contractual arrangements.  It  will 
also  support  research  in  the  feed  domain  in  order  to  improve  the  valorization  of 
alternative local products in animal feed.  
53.  The  issues  related  to  weak  access  to  input/output  markets  and  services  will  be 
addressed  among  others  through  the  promotion  of  “Productive  Alliances”147  between 
smallholder  farmers  and  input  suppliers  in  the  poultry  and  pig  value  chains,  building 
up on arrangements that are already often used in Rwanda by feed manufacturers to 
expand their customer outreach. In the best scenario the private sector would be both 
an input seller and an off-taker of the end product, thus also guaranteeing the market, 
but the project will also support other more common arrangements where the private 
sector would focus on its core business of input provision, while delivering at the same 
time tailor-made technical advices to enhance the productivity of their clients. 
54.  The  programme  support  to  construction/upgrading  of  animal  markets  and  processing 
facilities  at  both  public  and  private  level  will  further  ensure  that  small  livestock 
produce are channeled through market outlets that (i) are locally available; (ii) comply 
with food safety and animal welfare standards; and (iii) incorporate simple, affordable 
climate-resilient  technologies  in  line  with  the  targets  set  in  the  National  Strategy  for 
Climate  Change  and  Low  Carbon  Development.  These  public  works  will  be  conducted 
in  compliance  with  building  code  established  by  Rwanda  Bureau  of  Standards  and 
147 A productive alliance is a contractual arrangement whereby farmers enter into an agreement with either an input supplier, 
an aggregator or a service provider, who guarantees access to inputs, market or services to the farmers on mutually agreed 
conditions.

global  best  practices  pertaining  to  water  and  energy  efficiency,  waste  management 
(e.g. biogas), wastewater and sewerage treatment. 
55.  With regard to access to finance, the overall approach and principle will be to support 
programme  beneficiaries  to  access  finance  from  formal  financial  institutions  (banks, 
MFIs  and  SACCOs)  on  market  terms,  to  ensure  sustainability  of  access  and  avoid 
market  distortion.  Linkage  with  formal  financial  institutions  will  be  promoted  for  (i) 
smallholder poultry and pig farmers in productive alliance to finance capital investment 
and  working  capital,  (ii)  vulnerable  households  under  graduation  pathway  through 
linkages of their savings and loans association with the formal financial sector as one 
step  of  the  graduation  model,  and  (iii)  youth  in  cooperatives  to  finance  and  develop 
their  start  up  business.  This  will  be  done  by  providing  adequate  capacity  building 
support  both  on  demand  and  supply  sides,  and  structuring  of  the  value  chains  to 
contribute  to  risk  mitigation  for  the  financial  institutions.  The  programme  will  work 
with  financial  service  institutions  who  already  have  commitments  to  serving  the 
agricultural sector and have expressed interest in the small livestock sector, and invest 
in  TA  in  order  to  help  them  better  understand  the  target  group  features  and  needs, 
and  design  appropriate  products  and  services.  Fora  organized  by  the  project  to  link 
financial institution and smallholder farmers, and financial literacy training for clients, 
will help break down access barriers and match the target group with the right service 
providers. 
56.  Finally,  the  programme  is  sensitive  to  the  risk  aversion  of  financial  service  providers, 
and  will  link  with  or  help  develop  risk  management  tools  –  these  include  matching 
grants,  access  to  guarantees,  specialist  insurance  products,  and  digital  financial 
services.  Use  of  matching  grants  will  be  restricted  to  incentivize  and  facilitate  access 
to  finance  for  high  risk  borrowers,  either  because  of  lack  of  business  track  record  or 
lack  of  collateral,  which  is  the  case  of  youths  and  start  up  smallholder  farmers.  For 
private sector actors, matching grants will be used only to incentivize development of 
social or public good related investment: development of smallholder farmers network 
to secure their customer or supplier base, investment in essential equipment meant to 
improve  food  safety,  animal  welfare  and  climate-smart  upgrading  of  their  facilities, 
conditional upon their sourcing from programme beneficiaries. Accordingly, the limited 
grants meant to support these investments will be disbursed along the different Public-
Private-Producers  Partnerships  (4P)  models  already  in  use  under  PASP  project  (see 
detailed 4P models in Annex). 
57.  By increasing the business proposition of the clients and helping the financial sector to 
better  understand  and  manage  risks,  it  is  expected  that  adapted  products  will  be 
developed and delivered, with affordable interest rates.  
58.  The programme will contribute to improve the policy formulation process by ensuring 
that  policy  dialogue  is  evidence  based  and  inclusive,  and  involves  all  categories  of 
value  chain  actors,  smallholder  producers  in  particular.  This  will  guarantee  that  the 
policies and strategies developed are based on the actual needs and constraints of the 
value  chain  actors,  and  that  proposed  policy  options  are  acceptable  and 
implementable.  The  main  instrument  to  guarantee  this  inclusivity  and  ownership  will 
be the stakeholders platforms initiated by the project. 
124

59.  The  programme  will  also  support  the  development  and  enforcement  of  regulatory 
framework,  with  a  particular  focus  on  food  safety  and  animal  welfare.  The  same 
approach  as  for  policies  will  be  followed,  and  participation  of  value  chain  actors 
through the platforms will ensure a better ownership and acceptation of regulations by 
the value chain actors, which will facilitate their enforcement by public authorities. 
60. 
 The  programme  will  maintain  close  consultation  and  coordination  with  all  potential 
partners involved in the areas covered by PRISM in order to promote the emergence of 
synergies between activities and avoid duplication. Strong opportunities for  synergies 
have  been  identified  with  the  Feed  the  Future  Rwanda/  USAID  funded  project  called 
"Orora  Wihaze"  which  will  sustainably  increase  the  availability  of,  access  to,  and 
consumption  of  animal-source  foods  (ASF)  through  development  of  a  profitable 
market. In addition, the project will partner with the international organization Heifer 
International  in  co-investing  (approx.  USD3  million)  and  co-implementing  selected 
activities under PRISM, building on successful previous experiences under KWAMP and 
the  grant  project  "Dairy  Hub  Model  integration  into  IFAD  funded  projects  in  Rwanda 
and Tanzania (Zanzibar). 
Targeting strategy 
Geographical targeting and project intervention area 
61.  Targeted districts and Geographical repartition between partners:  the  IFAD  supported 
interventions  (the  project)  will  target  a  total  of  15  districts  distributed  across  the 
Northern, Southern and Western Provinces of Rwanda, where poverty and malnutrition 
are  widespread.  The  ENABEL  intervention  will  have  a  national  coverage  but  will  be 
concentrating its activities where there is potential for market-oriented poultry and pig 
production,  and  where  the  larger  commercial  producers  are  located  (such  as  Kigali, 
Rwamagana, Musanze, and Lake Kivu region (Rubavu and Rusizi).

62.  Within  the  three  provinces,  IFAD  will  select  15  districts  to  implement  its  operations. 
The  selection  criteria  for  the  IFAD  targeted  districts  and  their  respective  sectors  will 
be the following: 
 
 
Districts with high rates of poverty and food insecurity (see Table 2);  
Districts that present comparative advantage for the development of specific 
small livestock value chains, such as the existence of a traditional production 
basin, the proximity of a strong market, favourable environmental conditions or 
the availability of resource base; 
127 
Rwanda 
Partnership for Resilient and Inclusive Small Livestock Markets (PRISM) 
Project Implementation Manual (DRAFT) 
63.  Sectors not targeted by other small livestock value chain development projects. In this 
regard, the programme will align and cooperate with the USAID/ Feed the Future and 
other  possible  development  partners  active  in  the  small  livestock  sector  to  avoid  the 
duplication  of  investments  and  to  seek  complementarity  among  the  proposed 
interventions;  in  this  sense,  it  will  be  possible  have  some  geographical  overlap  in 
terms  of  districts,  but  working  in  different  sectors.  Furthermore,  territorial  contiguity 
among  districts  should  be  sought,  in  order  to  facilitate  implementing  arrangements 
and the delivery of the project's services. 
64.  Other districts, e.g. Bugesera (Eastern province) and the city of Kigali may be targeted 
for  specific  activities,  such  as  the  establishment  of  strategic  partnership  between 
smallholders  and  the  private  sector  and  their  inclusion  in  productive  alliances  or  4P 
arrangements. 
65.  Despite the high rate of poverty, the programme area is a traditional production basin 
for  small livestock  and  poultry:  the  Northern  province  alone  accounts  for  42%  of  the 
national  sheep  production,  Southern  province  of  pig  production  (42%)  and  poultry 
(30%).  The  table  below  shows  the  total  number  of  households  the  project  area 
(provinces  and  respective  districts),  vis-à-vis  the  percentage  of  food  insecure 
households and the small livestock and poultry production.

66.  Data show that districts such as Ngororero (West) or Gisagara (South), with very high 
rates of poverty (66% and 65% respectively) and food insecure households (40% and 
23,5%)  count  with  very  high  production  of  small  livestock  (Ngororero  is  the  first 
district  for  pig  production  at  the  national  level  and  Gisagara  the  second  district  for 
poultry and goat production at the national level). Following the same criteria, districts 
as  Gakenke  and  Giacumbi  may  be  targeted  for  their  sheep  and  goat  production, 
respectively,  being  also  districts  where  more  than  60%  of  the  households  live  in 
poverty. In the South, Nyamagabe has almost 30% of households food insecure but a 
high  level  of  goat  production;  similarly,  Nyanza  and  Ruhango  have  a  strong  poultry 
production and high poverty rates (60%). In the West, Rutsiro has a good production 
of goat and hens and alarming rates of food insecurity (49%) and poverty (60%).  
67.  Process of selection of the districts and sectors. The selection of the districts and 
respective  sectors  will  be  based  on  the  criteria  above  mentioned.  Consultations 
between  MINAGRI,  RAB,  IFAD,  Heifer  International  and  USAID/Feed  the  Future  and 
ENABEL  will  be  conducted  during  the  programme  inception  phase  in  order  to  pre-
screen  a  potential  list  of  districts  where  projects  may  implement  their  respective 
activities,  agree  on  the  different  areas  of  interventions  and  define  institutional 
arrangements for their delivery.

poverty, food insecurity and malnutrition rates. 
Value Chains 
69.  The programme will target 4 small livestock value chains: the poultry value chain, the 
pig value chain, the goat value chain, and the sheep value chain. These value chains 
have  been  selected  because  of  their  potential  for  poverty  reduction  and  improved 
nutrition, their potential for social, gender and youth inclusion, their market potential 
(domestic  and  export  markets),  their  limited  impact  on  environment  and  their 
resilience to climate shocks. 
70.  The  number  of  beneficiaries  per  value  chain  will  be:  4,500  households  for  small 
ruminants, 4,250148 for poultry and 2,450149 for pigs. 
148 2,250 vulnerable HH + 1,000 youth + 1,000 commercial producers.

71. 
IFAD-supported interventions (the project) will target mainly the small ruminants and 
backyard  chicken  value  chains,  that  correspond  to  its  priority  target  groups,  when 
ENABEL will concentrate on pig and poultry commercial value chains (also targeted by 
IFAD); 
72.  For  poultry,  the  project  will  target  both  the  dual  purpose  (meat  and  egg)  backyard 
systems,  in  particular  through  sub-component  1.1,  and  the  commercial  intensive 
systems  (broilers  and  layers),  through  sub-component  1.2  (youth  support)  and  sub-
component 2.1 (productive alliances). However, in the commercial poultry value chain, 
the project will not target directly industrial farmers with more than 1,000 birds. 
73.  For pig, the same approach will apply, and the project will support both the traditional 
family  system,  through  sub-component  1.1,  and  the  commercial  intensive  system 
through  sub  component  1.2  (youth  support)  and  sub  component  2.1  (productive 
alliances). The project will not support industrial units in case some emerge. 
74.  For  small  ruminants,  the  project  will  target  the  goat  value  chain  in  priority,  with  a 
particular focus on meat production. In regions where sheep are in abundance (North 
West),  this  value  chain  will  also  be  supported.  When  feasible,  support  to  these  two 
value  chains  will  be  envisaged  jointly  (support  to  public  infrastructures,  market 
facilitation, support to producers organizations). 
Target group(s)  
75.  Target  groups.  The  targeting  mechanism  will  be  based  on  the  national  wealth 
ranking  system  (Ubudehe)  and  consistent  with  the  targeting  strategy  outlined  in  the 
COSOP.  The  IFAD  supported  interventions  will  directly  benefit  a  total  of  26,355  poor 
rural households belonging to Ubudehe categories 1, 2 and 3. Within the beneficiaries, 
the project will address three main target groups through complementary approaches 
meant to support their participation in commercial and inclusive value chains:  
 
23,400  poor  and  food  insecure  rural  households  (approximately  88,000 
household  members  falling  in  Ubudehe  category  1  and  2)  amongst  whom  the 
project will give priority to the most vulnerable households, women (and among 
them  to  women  heads  of  households)  and  youth.  Poorest  households  are 
composed of subsistence farmers, mostly food insecure and with limited land and 
access  to  resources,  have  few  active  members,  are  more  often  headed  by  a 
single person.  Women will represent at least 50% and youth 30% of  the target 
beneficiaries. To reach the poorest households, the project will deploy a pro-poor 
graduation  pathway,  aimed  at  addressing  community  development  through  an 
integrated  and  holistic  approach.  The  graduation  pathway  will  be  based  on  the 
Values-Based  Holistic  Community  Development  (VBHCD)  model  designed  and 
implemented  by  Heifer  International  (see,  sub-component  1.1.).  The  VBHCD 
model  entails  that,  within  the  targeted  communities,  the  most  vulnerable 
households  are  identified  in  a  participatory  way  at  the  beginning  of  project’s 
implementation; although the holistic approach and related activities will be open 
to all community members despite their socio-economic conditions, the package 
of  services  provided  will  be  tailored  to  the  specific  households’  needs.  Women 
149 1,500 vulnerable households + 500 youth + 450 commercial producers

heads  of  households,  young  women  and  men  and  most  vulnerable  households 
will  be  prioritized  as  first  recipients  of  the  POG  practice.  With  the  poorest 
households  the  project  will  target  the  backyard  poultry  value  chain,  the  family 
pig  production  and  the  small  ruminants  production,  which  are  productions 
particularly suitable for women. 
1,530 rural youth (50% women), aged between 16 and 30 years, in Ubudehe 
categories  1  to  3,  unemployed  and  with  low  educational  level,  will  receive 
support to organize themselves into small livestock production cooperatives and 
receive  a  full  start-up  package,  including:  initial  technical  and  managerial 
training, provision of business development services, and assets building will be 
provided.  Furthermore,  will  be  youth  75%  of  the  CAVEs150  and  50%  of  the 
community facilitators.  
1,425 market-oriented  producers  (525  broiler  farmers,  450  eggs  producers, 
450  pig  fatteners),  in  Ubudehe  categories  2-  3,  will  be  targeted  across  all 
districts.  These  less  vulnerable  producers,  are  already  engaged  in  a  more 
entrepreneurial  logic,  will  be  supported  through  a  combination  of  technical, 
business  and  financial  capacity  building  combined  with  backward  and  forward 
market  facilitation.  This  will  be  provided  in  the  scope  of  innovative  value  chain 
arrangements that facilitate the participation of smallholders in commercial value 
chains.  
76.  Other  direct  beneficiaries  will  be  approximately  900,000  households  raising  small 
livestock that will benefit by vaccination campaigns against major small livestock diseases. 
The  project  will  also  benefit  service  providers,  such  as  the  Community  Agro-Vet 
Entrepreneurs  and  veterinary  services,  through  the  provision  of  training  and  capacity 
strengthening;  members  of  national  producers  organizations  as  well  as  district  staff  and 
RAB trainers that will be trained on matters related to the governance and the management 
of  their  organizations  and  to  the  development  of  small  livestock  value  chain,  respectively. 
Specifically,  and  across  all  components  and  activities,  the  project  will  target  50%  women 
and 30% youth.  
77.  The  number  of  beneficiaries  per  value  chain  will  be  :  4,500  households  for  small 
ruminants, 4,250 for poultry and 2,450 for pigs. 
78.  The  number  of  beneficiaries  targeted  through  the  ENABEL  supported  interventions  is 
21,254  in  total,  composed  as  follows:  (a)  12,000  producers  of  chicken  and  pork 
supported  through  FFS;  (b)  9,000  soybean  and  maize  producers  supported  through 
FFS; (c) 25 medium scale producers and 2 large scale producers in the pig sector, and 
200  medium  scale  producers  and  2  large  scale  producers  in  the  poultry  sector  will 
benefit  from  business  development  services  and  capital  investment  support;  and  (d) 
25  enterprises  operating  in  the  targeted  value  chains.  ENABEL  beneficiaries  will  be 
mostly in Ubudehe categories 2, 3 and 4. 
79.  The  total  number  of  beneficiaries  targeted  under  the  programme  by  both 
implementing agencies is therefore 47,609.  
150 Community Agro-Vet Entrepreneurs that will provide technical assistance to the targeted 
households.

Targeting mechanisms/strategy 
80.  The targeting strategy  for the  IFAD-supported  project to  reach beneficiary population 
will be based on the following targeting mechanisms:  
81.  Complementary  targeting  approach  with  ENABEL:  The  overall  growth  and 
strengthening of the  small livestock  value chain can take place only if all value chain 
actors,  at  all  levels,  are  able  to  participate  and  contribute:  the  smallholder  and 
vulnerable producers, but also the bigger private sector actors especially at processing 
and input provision levels. The partnership with ENABEL allows IFAD to concentrate its 
support  to  its  core  target  group:  the  vulnerable  rural  producers,  while  ENABEL, 
leveraging  its  comparative  advantage,  will  also  engage  more  market-oriented  value 
chain actors. This complementarity allows each partner to operate within its mandate 
and  to  leverage  its  comparative  advantage,  jointly  contributing  to  a  healthy  and 
sustainable growth of the sector.  
82.  Self-targeting.  The  goods  and  services  provided  by  the  project  will  respond  to  the 
priorities, and livelihood strategies of the target groups. Smallholders producers will be 
encouraged  to  join  small  livestock  production  groups/  cooperatives  and  they  will  be 
supported to link to market opportunities. 
83.  Direct  targeting.  The  poorest  households  (from  Ubudehe  category  I)  and,  within 
these,  women-headed  households,  young  women  and  men  and  households  with 
under-nourished children will be targeted directly by the project to be the first recipients 
of  the  POG  practice  (see,  component  1.1).  Young  women  and  men  will  be  directly 
targeted  as  primary  beneficiaries  for  the  development  of  small livestock  cooperatives 
(component 1.2). 
84.  Empowering  measures.  In  addition  to  developing  technical  skills  in  small  livestock 
production,  the  project  will  support  beneficiaries  to  develop  skills  in  household 
nutrition,  basic  literacy  and  numeracy,  business  and  leadership.  Gender  awareness 
training  will  contribute  fostering  more  equitable  gender  roles  and  relations  at 
household and group levels. 
85.  Enabling policy and institutional environment. The project benefits from a highly 
enabling  policy  and  institutional  environment  fully  supportive  of  the  development  of 
the  small  livestock  sector,  with  a  pro-poor  and  inclusive  approach.  Support  to 
formulation  and  enforcement  of  sector  policies  and  regulations  and  standards  will  be 
addressed under component 3. 
86.  Procedural  measures.  Attention  will  be  given  to  costs/beneficiary  contributions, 
timing and administrative procedures required for effective participation of the various 
target groups. 
87.  Operational  measures  and  monitoring.  A  Gender,  Targeting  and  Community 
Mobilisation  Officer  has  been  appointed  in  the  MINAGRI  Single  Project  Management 
Unit  (SPIU)  to  coordinate  implementation  of  the  gender  and  targeting  strategies. 
Similarly, a Nutrition Specialist has been appointed under the on-going Rwanda Diary 
Development  Project  and  will  be  responsible  to  coordinate  nutrition-related  activities 
under  the  project.  The  Minimum  Dietary  Diversity  for  Women-MDD-W  indicator  has 
been  introduced  to  monitor  improvements  in  diets  as  a  direct  result  of  project's 
activities.  Studies  will  be  conducted  at  baseline,  mid-term  and  completion  to  assess 
132 
Rwanda

the  effectiveness  and  relevance  of  the  strategies/mechanisms.  M&E  indicators  will  be 
sex- and age-disaggregated. 
Strategy /approach for gender and youth mainstreaming, social inclusion and nutrition 
88.  Gender.  Despite  the  great  strides  in  promoting  gender  equality  and  achievements 
reached  at  the  national  level,  gender  disparities  still  persist  in  rural  areas,  where 
traditional patriarchal attitudes continue to prevail. Households headed by women tend 
to be the poorest: in the project area, female-headed households account for 55% of 
households in Ubudehe category 1. 
89. 
In the provinces targeted by the project the majority of the female population work in 
agriculture  and  rely  on  agricultural  activities  as  the  only  source  of  income.  Yet,  with 
lower  levels  of  schooling  and  higher  rates  of  illiteracy  they  are  constrained  to 
subsistence  farming  with  insufficient  skills,  access  to  markets  and  control  over  land 
and other key assets and agricultural services, compared to men. Women also lack the 
capacity to participate in agri-business and they are less employed in non-farm work, 
relative to men.  
90.  Major  issues  that  constrain  women  in  agriculture  are  related  to  (i)  time  burden  (ii) 
access to finance; (iii) access to inputs and technology and (iv) extension services and 
trainings.  Gender  disparities  are  also  evident  in  the  value  addition  and  marketing  of 
agricultural commodities where more economic commodities are controlled by men. In 
general women are associated with marketing small quantities of produce while larger 
quantities are marketed by men who also control the income from the sales.  
91.  At the project level, and in line with the latest COSOP, women will account for at least 
50% of the beneficiaries. Special attention will be given to female-headed households. 
Women  will  be  empowered  to  effectively  engage  in  the  economic  activities  and  to 
increase  their  decision-making  power  at  the  household  and  community  level.  To  this 
aim,  PRISM  will  count  on  the  experience  gained  in  implementing  Gender  Action 
Learning  System  (GALS)  and  other  participative  households  approaches  in  the  frame 
of  the  on-going  operations,  contributing  to increase  equal  access  of  men  and  women 
to economic opportunities, decision-making processes and share of workload. 
92.  Approach for gender mainstreaming and social inclusion. To contribute to tackle 
constraints  faced  by  rural  women,  the  project  will  adopt  an  inclusive  approach  to 
ensure  that  women  and  men  equally  benefit  from  project's  interventions.  Overall, 
women  will  account  for  at  least  50%  of  the  beneficiaries,  and  female-headed 
households  and  women  in  male-headed  households  will  be  empowered  to  participate 
in project activities or engage in economic activities. Young people (50% women), will 
represent 30% of the overall number of beneficiaries.  
93.  The targeting and social inclusion strategy will rely on a strong mobilization strategy to 
be  undertaken  at  the  beginning  of  the  project.  With  the  poorest  and  food  insecure 
households (Ubudehe category 1 and 2) the community mobilization will be carried out 
by community facilitators, in the frame of the Heifer's VBHCD model. While mobilizing 
the  communities,  direct  targeting  measures  (see,  targeting  strategy  above)  will  be 
applied to ensure that the most vulnerable groups will be included, that representation 
of female and male participants is equal and that elite capture is avoided. 
133

94.  The project's approach to gender mainstreaming will be aimed to:  
(a) 
(b) 
(c) 
(d) 
Ensure  that  women  and  men  have  equal  access  to  capacity  building,  training  and 
productive  assets.  With  this  objective,  the  project  will  target  50%  women  as  direct 
beneficiaries; 
Promote  labour-saving  technologies  that  can  contribute  to  decreasing  women’s 
workload,  as  time  burden  is  one  of  the  major  issues  that  constrain  women  in 
intensification  of  dairy  production  provides 
agriculture; 
opportunities for biogas systems which can be used for household energy; 
for  example, 
the 
Increase  women’s  voice  in  decision-making  at  the  household  and  community  level. 
Under the VBHCD model, women will be trained to form groups and their leadership 
and  negotiation  skills  will  be  strengthened  to  enable  them  to  make  informed 
decisions.  Gender-awareness  trainings,  including  both  women  and  men,  will  be 
carried out at both household and cooperative levels;  
Increase women’s access to skills and knowledge: women's skills in financial literacy, 
managing  and  saving  money  will  be  strengthened,  encouraging  the  economic 
empowerment  of  women  and  their  participation  throughout  the  whole  value  chain 
(also in areas that are not traditionally in their domain);  
(e)  Develop skills to improve the well-being of women and  other family members: with 
this purpose, nutrition education will be provided at both household and groups level. 
The  training  will  include  training  in  nutrition/  dietary  knowledge,  food  handling  and 
storage,  cooking  classes  and  practical  demonstrations  on  how  to  prepare  a  healthy 
and balanced meal (see, component 1.1). In the case of youth cooperative, nutrition 
education will be provided in coordination with Districts authorities (see, component 
1.2); 
(f) 
Train  project  staff  and  extension  service  providers  on  gender-related  issues 
(component  1.1).  It  will  be  ensured  that  training  modules  include  specific  sections 
related to gender. To this aim, Gender, Targeting and Community Mobilisation Officer 
has  been  appointed  to  oversee  the  training  modules  and  curricula  that  will  be 
delivered to targeted communities/ households under the VBHCD model.  
95. 
In order to harmonize with on-going activities on gender and women's empowerment 
carried out at the district level, the project (through the District Project Coordinators) 
will  articulate  with  local  governmental  authorities  and,  in  particular,  with  the  Gender 
and Family Promotion Officers at the district level.  
96.  Gender  Strategy.  The  Gender,  Targeting  and  Community  Mobilisation  Officer  will  be 
responsible  to  outline  the  Gender  strategy  of  the  project  during  the  project  inception 
phase. The overall objective of the Gender strategy will be to ensure that women and 
men  are  equally  involved  in  decision-making  and  in  sharing  the  benefit  of  project's 
interventions  and  that  gender  will  be  mainstreamed  throughout  all  project  activities. 
The strategy will have to include the following items: 
(i)  Specific objectives, related to project's components; 
(ii) Specific activities foreseen to reach the objectives and expected outcomes/ outputs; 
134 
Rwanda 
Partnership for Resilient and Inclusive Small Livestock Markets (PRISM) 
Project Implementation Manual (DRAFT) 
(iii) Methodological approach;  
(iv) Knowledge  management:  the  strategy  should  explain  how  the  knowledge  and 
experience acquired in mainstreaming gender-related issues in on-going projects will 
be capitalized; 
(v) Coordination strategies: collaborations with external partners (at national and district 
level), service providers, should be included here.  
97.  Coordination  among  ENABEL  and  IFAD-funded  projects  on  gender-related  issues  and 
activities  will  be  foreseen.  This  will  be  facilitated  by  the  fact  that  Gender  and  Family 
Promotion  Officers  appointed  for  RDDP  will  be  also  responsible  to  mainstreaming 
gender  issues  into  PRISM.  The  experience  acquired  in  previous  projects  should  be 
capitalized and used to build the gender strategy of the project. 
98.  Gender  training.  Training  on  gender-related  issues  will  be  included  in  the  VBHCD 
model  addressing  the  poorest  households  in  Ubudehe  category  1  and  2.  (see,  sub-
component 1.2). The training will use a mix approach by addressing women’s groups 
and  mixed-gender  groups.  Gender  sensitivity  training  will  be  offered  to  both  women 
and  men,  which  encourages  husbands  and  wives  to  share  in  decision-making, 
ownership  of  the  animals,  labour  and  the  benefits  of  the  productive  activities.  The 
training will also use family focus, demonstrating how gender equity benefits all family 
members, resulting in improved family harmony. The Gender training will ultimately be 
aimed to: 
(i) 
Equip participants with information on what gender is and how it affects 
the community; 
(ii)  Understand how gender roles and social factors contribute to one’s 
behaviors as a farmer; 
(iii)  Help participant understand the importance of gender in their everyday 
farm activities; 
(iv)  Identify gender appropriate interventions that can be applied to improve 
their participation in and benefit from the hub and at the households. 
99.  The  Community  Facilitators  (CFs)  will  play  an  important  role  in  ensuring  gender 
justice.  They  will  help  mobilize  the  farmers  themselves  and  host  the  sensitization 
trainings  to  strengthen  gender  relations  among  households  and  within  the  groups  of 
producers.  They  also  may  conduct  home  visits,  support  groups  on  ensuring  gender 
balance  during  the  group  formation  and  training  them  on  gender.  CFs  also  document 
best practices among couples and groups and help disseminate learnings.  
100.  Preventing gender based violence in the agricultural sector: the project will contribute 
to  reducing  any  harmful  act  based  on  gender  through:  (i)  sensitization  on  the 
importance  of  addressing  GBV,  application  of  IFAD's  no  tolerance  for  Sexual 
Harassment (SH) /Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (SEA) for project staff and project's 
activities and operations; (ii) map out and partner with GBV prevention and response 
actors in project adjoining communities; (iii) have GBV risks adequately reflected in all 
safeguards  instruments,  contracts  with  suppliers  and  and  other  third  parties  to  be 
funded with IFAD funds.

101.  In youth small livestock enterprises, trainings on gender will be delivered through the 
districts. MoUs will be signed with the Districts during the inception phase in order to 
formalize  the  modalities  of  partnership  between  the  Districts  and  the  project.  The 
Gender, Targeting and Mobilisation Officer will be responsible to outline the contents of 
the trainings and to coordinate their delivery. To this aim, the Officer will be assisted, 
during  the  first  year,  by  a  consultant,  who  will  be  hired  to  support  the  design  of  the 
modules, among other duties (See ToRs in annex).  
102.  Start-up  workshop  (gender  &  nutrition).  The  project  start-up  workshop  will 
provide the opportunity to raise awareness on targeting, gender and nutrition related 
issues,  to  describe  the  strategies  and  approaches  that  the  project  will  apply  to  work 
with women, men and youth and to address nutrition-sensitive issues. To this regard, 
a  specific  session  on  targeting  and  gender,  on  the  one  hand,  and  on  nutrition 
mainstreaming,  on  the  other  hand,  will  be  included  as  part  of  the  workshop.  The 
Gender, Targeting and Community Mobilisation Officer and the Nutrition Specialist, will 
be  responsible  to  prepare  and  present  on  their  related  areas  of  competency. 
Suggestions for presentations are in Annex 13.

104.  Jobs  for  youth.  Job  creation  for  the  youth  (16  to  30  years  age)  will  be  targeted 
throughout  the  project.  Youth  will  represent  30%  of  total  target  beneficiaries  (50% 
women).  In  the  three  provinces  targeted  by  the  IFAD  funded  interventions,  youth 
represents  25%  of  the  total  rural  population.  Although  most  of  the  youth  is  literate, 
the level of education is low (primary school education completed); the majority of the 
rural youth are workers, mostly engaged as independent farmers. 
136

105.  The  agricultural  sector  is  characterized  by  low  productivity,  low  earnings  and 
precarious  working  conditions.  The  major  causes  of  problems  in  regard  to  access  to 
market  and  challenges  to  youth  entrepreneurship  and  business  development  include: 
lack  of  technical  skills,  limited  access  to  information  and  opportunities,  inadequate 
access  to  resources  (land  and  capital)  insufficient  support  services  (internship, 
apprenticeship)  business  and  management  skills,  among  others.  To  contribute  to 
generate  employment  and  economic  opportunities  for  young  people,  a  specific 
package of services (see, component 1.2) will be aimed at youth. 
106.  Nutrition.  Although,  over  the  last  few  years,  there  has  been  a  reduction  of  stunting 
prevalence among children under five years (from 43.4% in 2012 to 34.9% in 2018), 
the  level  of  stunting  remains  very  high.  In  the  three  provinces  targeted  by  the  project,  the 
prevalence  of  child  stunting  reaches  40%  on  average.  Infant  and  young  child  feeding  (IYCF) 
practices  also  remain  inadequate  and  few  children  achieved  the  minimum  acceptable  diet  (MAD) 
based on dietary diversity and meal frequency. 
107.  There is a clear correlation in the project area between poverty rates, food insecurity 
and prevalence of stunting in children. In most cases, districts with a higher proportion 
of  food  insecure  households  have  a  higher  prevalence  of  stunted  children.  Food 
insecure households have nutrient-low diets; protein-rich foods in particular are rarely 
consumed.  An  analysis  of  determinants  for  chronic  malnutrition  in  the  project  area 
suggests  that  poverty  and  education,  especially  of  the  mother,  have  a  clear 
relationship with prevalence of stunting in children (women living in poverty and with 
no  education  are  more  likely  to  have  stunted  children).  There  is  also  a  strong 
correlation between the mother’s food consumption and the child’s food consumption: 
women’s  knowledge  and  education  on  food  diversity  has  been  recognized  as  a 
significant  factor  impacting  children’s  food  consumption,  especially  for  achieving  the 
minimum  acceptable  diet.  In  addition,  environmental  factors,  both  behavioural  and 
those linked to access to water and sanitation, also contribute to this problem: access 
to clean drinking water remain a challenge in rural areas.  
108.  Nutrition  strategy.  The  project  recognizes  that  the  small  livestock  sector  can 
contribute  to  play  an  important  role  in  combatting  malnutrition,  by  both  increasing 
availability  of  animal  source  foods  at  the  household  level  and  increasing  income. 
Nevertheless, limited nutrition knowledge among beneficiaries may prevent producers 
to  translate  increased  production  and  income  into  improved  diets.  The  project  will 
contribute to improved nutrition by (a) increasing availability of animal-source foods at 
the household level and promoting their consumption, especially amongst women and 
children;  (b)  increasing  producers'  income  to  purchase  nutritious  foods.  To  support 
beneficiaries  in  addressing  gaps  in  nutrition  knowledge,  the  project  will  conduct 
nutrition education at the household level and with the youth cooperatives.  
109.  Nutrition  education  aimed  at  the  poorest  and  food  insecure  households  (Ubudehe 
category 1 and 2) will be embedded into the  VBHCD approach implemented by Heifer 
International  (see  component  1.1)  and  will  include  training  in  nutrition/dietary 
knowledge,  livestock  sourced  food,  proper  consumption  pattern  (with  emphasis  to 
pregnant  and  lactating  women  and  children  under  five  to  reduce  malnutrition  and 
food  handling  and  storage,  cooking  classes  and  practical 
stunting  growth), 
demonstrations  on  how  to  prepare  a  healthy  and  balanced  meal.  The  following 
learning areas will be addressed in the nutrition education training: 
137 
Rwanda 
Partnership for Resilient and Inclusive Small Livestock Markets (PRISM) 
Project Implementation Manual (DRAFT) 
-  Definition of nutrition and its related concepts; 
-  Essential nutrients: macronutrients and micronutrients; 
-  Practices  to  maintain  proper  nutrients  (e.g.  food  preparation,  drying 
cereals  after  harvesting  them,  protecting  vegetables  and  fruits  directly 
after removing them from their trees, etc.) 
-  Energy requirements for adults, adolescents, children, and infants; 
-  Causes of under nutrition and its consequences on a society; 
-  Protein energy malnutrition (PEM) and body mass index (BMI); 
-  Minerals and vitamin deficiencies.  
110.  Nutrition  education  sessions  will  be  complemented  by  training  on  gender  aimed  at 
both  husbands  and  wives,  that  will  address  intra-household  dynamics  (decision-
making, sharing of labour): this will help to tackle those challenges that, beyond food, 
may  compromise  improvements  in  diets  at  the  household  level  (e.g.  intra-household 
food distribution, choices on the use of family's income, etc.).  
111.  The  promotion  of  climate-smart  labour-saving  technologies  (such  as  biogas)  would 
contribute to decrease women’s workload and, it is expected, to increase their caring 
capacities.  Trainings  at  the  community  level  will  also  include  raising  awareness  on 
the importance  of  good  hygiene  and  sanitation,  including  actions  to  improve  the 
surrounding environment. 
112.  Nutrition will be mainstreamed not only at the production level: sanitary risks and food 
safety-related  issues  will  be  addressed  (including  improving  slaughtering  and 
processing  facilities  and  support  to  enforce  sanitary  regulations)  along  the  value 
chains (see component 2).  
113.  In the case of youth small livestock  cooperatives, nutrition education will be provided 
in coordination with Districts authorities. A project Nutrition Specialist, already part of 
the  SPIU  project  staff  and  to  mainstreaming  nutrition  in  the  IFAD-supported  project 
RDDP, will be responsible to coordinate the nutrition activities at the national level. The 
Nutrition  Specialist  will  work  in  close  consultation  with  the  Gender,  Targeting  and 
Community  Mobilisation  Officer  to  ensure  that  nutrition  and  gender-related initiatives 
are  aligned  and  coordinated;  furthermore,  the  Specialist  will  be  responsible  to 
facilitate  the  cooperation  with  governmental  programmes  and  key  development 
partners  engaged  in  nutrition  initiatives  at  the  national  and  local  level  and  with  the 
Districts. 
114.  Nutrition training (youth small livestock cooperatives). Nutrition education will be done 
by  conducting  training  at  the  district  level.  Building  on  the  experience  of  RDDP,  the 
training  curriculum  will  be  developed  in  close  collaboration  with  the  National  Early 
Childhood Development Programme (NECDP),  a governmental programme, under the 
Ministry  of  Gender  and  Family  promotion,  currently  in  charge  of  mainstreaming  the 
nutrition  agenda  at  the  country  level,  with  particular  focus  on  stunting  reduction  and 
prevention. NECDP is the institutional partners responsible for the delivery of nutrition 
education under RDDP. Specific contents for the trainings will have to be agreed during 
the programme inception phase. Alignment and harmonization with the District Plan to 
Eliminate  Malnutrition  (DPEM)  should  be  also  sought  at  this  stage  and  maintained 
throughout the programme implementation.

115.  The  Minimum  Dietary  Diversity  for  Women-MDD-W  indicator  has  been  introduced  to 
monitor  improvements  in  diets  in  women  in  reproductive  age,  as  a  direct  result  of 
project's activities. Studies will be conducted at baseline, mid-term and completion to 
assess the effectiveness and relevance of the strategies/mechanisms.  
116.  In partnership with the GoR, FAO is currently developing national Food-Based Dietary 
Guidelines (FBDGs) in Kinyarwanda, that will be used to educate people to consume a 
more  diverse  and  nutrient-and  balanced  diet  as  well  as  guide  interventions  aimed  at 
addressing nutritional concerns in the country. As part of its communication activities, 
the  project  will  promote  the  dissemination  of  FBDGs  with  the  sectors/communities/ 
households where it will operate. 
117.  Activities  described  below  will  be  complemented  by  the  ENABEL  led  activity  2.3.12  – 
“Behaviour  change  for  a  better  balanced  diet  with  sufficient  attention  for  animal 
protein  sources”  whose  objective  is  to  raise  awareness  on  the  importance  of  the 
source  of  animal  proteins  by  conducting  various  activities  of  sensitization  (Media 
campaigns, awareness modules for SHF and at the level of households, etc.)

Detailed description and implementation modalities of SC 1.1 
121.  Through  this  sub-component,  which  will  be  implemented  by  Heifer  International,  the 
project  will  reach  23,400  poor  and  food  insecure  rural  households  with  whom  the 
project  will  deploy  a  pro-poor  approach  through  a  graduation  pathway  (VBHCD 
model),  aimed  at  addressing  community  development  through  an  integrated  and 
140 
Rwanda 
Partnership for Resilient and Inclusive Small Livestock Markets (PRISM) 
Project Implementation Manual (DRAFT) 
holistic  approach.  This  model  builds  on  12  Cornerstones©151  aimed  at  strengthening 
the  capacity  of  smallholder  farmers  (including  financial  literacy,  nutrition  education, 
business  management  and  increase  gender  equity)  to  increase  their  production  and 
productivity,  while  connecting  them  to  markets.  At  the  core  of  this  approach  is  the 
"Passing on the Gift (POG)" practice, through which people give one  of their animals’ 
first  offspring  to  others  in  needs.  Heifer  will  capitalize  on  its  existing  experience  and 
expertise  in  Rwanda,  the  Africa  region  and  globally.  The  main  activities  implemented 
under the VBHCD will be as follows: 
Activity 1.1.1: Self Help Group Formation 
122.  SHG  is  the  foundation  for  VBHCD.  Heifer  first  helps  community  members  to  organize 
themselves  into  SHGs  with  one  representative  from  each  household.  Each  SHG  is 
generally  constituted  of  20-30  members.  Within  a  group,  it  will  be  likely  to  have 
representatives  from  different  socio-economic  sub-groups  (extremely  vulnerable  and 
food insecure and less vulnerable). The groups will be open to all sub-groups present 
in the community and they will be trained together in order to strengthen their social 
capital.  However,  the  package  of  services  provided  will  be  tailored  to  the  specific 
households’  needs,  depending  on  their  social  and  economic  situation.  Once  the  SHCs 
organized,  Heifer  continues  to  provide  capacity  building  training  and  mentoring 
support  to  the  SHGs.  SHGs  offer  project  participants  opportunity  to  create  bonds 
among  members  and  enable  them  to  think  and  work  together  for  a  common  cause. 
SHGs are platforms that facilitate the full participation of individual members in project 
activities, such as group savings and loan, training, leadership skills development, etc. 
After  receiving  training,  the  SHGs  establish  Group  Savings  and  Credit  Funds  and  are 
put  on  a  pathway  towards  graduation  to  form  a  larger  platform  of  a  Cooperative, 
through  which  they  can  achieve  economies  of  scale  by  aggregating  their  agricultural 
goods. Approximately 1,170 groups (~23,400 farmers) will be formed.  
Activity 1.1.2: Training of Farmers in Cornerstones© 
123.  In implementing this project, Heifer will use its VBHCD model to organize and mobilize 
poultry, swine, goat and sheep groups. The 12 Cornerstones© for Just and Sustainable 
Development  are  used  to  focus  the  group  on  the  shared  values  of  the  self  and 
community.  Shared  values  discussed  are  used  for  group  visioning  and  planning.  This 
helps  the  group  to  plan  for  three  types  of  key  activities:  activities  done  by  SHG 
members (without assistance); activities done with Heifer support (e.g., Heifer project 
activities);  activities  done  with  outside  support 
local  government). 
(e.g., 
Approximately 1,170 groups (~23,400 farmers) will be trained. 
Activity 1.1.3: Training of Farmers in Agri-Business and Income Generation  
124.  Farmers will also undergo important trainings to develop both hard and soft skills such 
as basic nutrition, gender and leadership modules for men and women, Values Based 
Financial  Literacy,  and  environmental  management  in  order  to  build  and  strengthen 
151 The 12 Cornerstones© cover a range of shared values and principles, abbreviated in Passing on the Gift. 
Accountability; Sharing and Caring; Sustainability and Self Reliance; Improved Animal and Resource Management;

holistic skills and capacities for long-term success in agri-business. Further, the SHGs 
will  be  introduced  to  income  generating  opportunities  that  exist  in  their  communities 
and undergo skills assessment to determine their strengths, weaknesses, and areas of 
interest.  Based  on  this  assessment,  farmers  will  be  trained  on  skills  related  to 
potential  opportunities,  including  small  business  entrepreneurship,  on-and  off-farm 
income  generation,  and  other  employment  opportunities  that  exist  along  the  value 
chains, 
processing, 
distribution/retail, and marketing. As the project progresses, agri-business workshops 
and  input  fairs  linking  farmers  to  private  sector  partners  will  be  facilitated  to  further 
sharpen the business acumen and prospects of farmers while forging stronger outlets 
to formal markets. Approximately 1,170 groups (~23,400 farmers) will be trained.

Activity 1.1.4: Technical Trainings on Poultry, Swine, Goat and Sheep  
125.  Prior  to  livestock  placement,  specific  technical  assistance  focusing  on  poultry,  sheep, 
swine  and  goat  value  chains  will  be  provided  to  farmers  to  help  increase  their 
production  and  productivity.  These  trainings  include  capacity  building  in:  breeding, 
husbandry,  feeding  including  zero-grazing,  health  and  reproduction.  Farmers  also 
receive  training  in  establishing  a  rotation  scheme  at  the  SHG  level.  Each  SHG  is 
supplied  with  at  least  one  male  animal  used  for  breeding  purposes.  A  carefully 
designed  technique  is  employed  to  avoid  cases  of  inbreeding  and  to  increase  the 
genetic diversity among the animals. Proper record keeping and follow up mechanisms 
are in place to ensure that animals that are closely related do not mate. The ratio of 
male to female per animal is described below: 
 
 
 
Swine, the boar to sow breeding ratio is 1:20 
Goats, the buck to doe ratio is 1:30 
Chicken, the rooster to hen ratio is 1:10 
Approximately 1,170 groups (~23,400 farmers) will be trained. 
Activity 1.1.5: Input Provision and Passing on the Gift  
126.  Once farmers have completed their training series, female animals of improved breeds 
will be placed at the household level. The selection of the first PoG’s recipients will be 
done  in  a  participatory  way;  group’s  members  themselves  will  be  asked  to  identify, 
within the group, the most needy households, which will be prioritize in receiving the 
first  animal.  In  this  context,  attention  will  be  given  to  the  most  food  insecure  and 
vulnerable  households  and,  particularly,  to  those  headed  by  women.  The  selection

129.  In addition to placement of animals, farmers will be provided initial starter packs with 
inputs, including: feeds of grasses and legumes; disinfectants; feed troughs; drinkers; 
and  nests.  At  the  household  level,  smallholders  will  be  trained  in  building  proper 
housing  structures  for  their  animals.  After  training,  farmers  will  receive  most  of  the 
materials necessary  for the construction and will co-invest about 20% of the building 
materials.  No  animal  will  be  placed  before  a  farmer  has  received  training  and 
constructed  an  appropriate  housing  structure  that  will  protect  the  investment  of  the 
animal from elements and pests. 
130.  Heifer’s model of Passing on the Gift© (POG) represents an innovative approach that 
fosters  sustainability  and  produces  a  multiplier  effect  for  impact.  POG©  is  a 
requirement  for  each  Heifer  program  participant  and  involves  the  initial  direct 
beneficiaries  (who  received  the  livestock)  passing  on  the  first  female  offspring,  to 
another person. The group determines who receive the “pass on” animals, training and 
guidance.  This  recipient  will  be  expected  to  do  the  same  for  another  person.  On 
average, Heifer gifts are passed on for four generations in Rwanda.

Activity 1.1.6: Provision and Training for Animal Feed  
132.  Ahead of livestock placement, farmers receive inputs for fodder plots, such as grasses 
and  legumes.  Farmers  will  also  be  trained  on  ways  to  address  seasonality  such  as 
post-harvest  storage,  which  will  make  higher  quality  feed  available  during  the  dry 
season.  Various  strategies  suitable  for  smallholders  such  as  planted  forages,  silage, 
and  improved  conservation  of  crop  residues  will  be  included.  Feed  packages  will  be 
provided to approximately 1,170 groups (~23,400 farmers). 
Activity 1.1.7: Fostering Robust South by South learning  
133.  Throughout  the  life  of  the  programme,  South-South  learning  will  be  facilitated  by 
conducting  exchange  visits  both  at  the  local  farmer  level,  but  also  among  global 
project  staff  across  Heifer’s  portfolio.  Current  plans  are  in  place  to  first  exchange 
between  Rwanda,  Kenya,  Nepal,  and  Cambodia  so  Rwanda  may  benefit  from 
successful breeding and feeding models that Heifer is implementing in the region and 
in  Asia.  Each  exchange  visit  will  articulate  a  clear  learning  agenda  to  enhance  small 
stock  productivity  and  will  capture  and  disseminate  lessons  learned.  Up  to  four 
participants will participate in exchange visits for years 2,3,4. 
Activity 1.1.8: Participatory Self-Review and Planning  
134.  PSRP  is  a  values-based  participatory  review  and  planning  methodology  designed  for 
assessing  project  implementation  progress,  community  participation  level,  and 
learning  and  planning  for  action.  Throughout  the  life  of  the  project,  farmers  will 
participate  in  PSRP,  which  takes  place  at  the  different  levels  and  involves  all  project 
stakeholders.  During  this  process,  farmers  asses  their  goals,  development  actions 
plans and self-monitor their progress. 
Implementation modalities for SC1.1

139.  Complementarities  and  alignment  with  ENABEL  intervention:  The  VBHCD  will  be 
implemented  in  the  IFAD  targeted  Districts  only,  and  will  target  households  from 
categories  1  and  2.  The  Farmer  Field  School  (FFS)  approach  will  be  implemented  by 
ENABEL at national level, but for 12,000 households selected among the most market 
oriented, mostly from categories 2 and 3 and located in areas that are more connected 
to  the  market.  The  commonalities  between  VBHCD  and  FFS  are  that  they  both 
combine groups mobilization, technical capacity building, financial literacy, and support 
to  market  access.  However,  VBHCD  will  target  the  poorest  households  and  the 
extensive  production  systems  (backyard  chicken  and  pig,  small  ruminants),  in  line 
with IFAD mandate and targeting strategy, while FFS will target the more commercially 
oriented  producers.  Because  it  targets  resource  poor  household,  VBHCD  includes 
assets building, which is not the case of FFS. The FFS curricula developed by ENABEL 
includes  business  management  aspects  and  is  therefore  more  intended  for  already

same areas but for different target groups.

Sub component 1.2: Improve animal health status and genetic potential of small livestock 
IFAD and ENABEL complementary approaches on animal health: 
Public veterinary services and veterinary public health issues will be promoted under IFAD supported 
interventions  only,  as  per  the  principles  of  collaboration  mentioned  earlier;  for  private  veterinary 
services, the approach deployed by Heifer (Community Agro-Vet entrepreneurs = CAVE) and by VSBF 
(support  to  networks  of  veterinary  technicians)  approach  are  complementary  as  they  will  aim  at 
providing  private  services  to  a  different  target  group  i.e.  CAVE  at  village  level  serving  Ubedehe  1-2 
mainly, while VSBF will work with more professional private service providers addressing the needs of 
Ubudehe  3  producers  principally.  Thus,  the  approaches  are  not  conflicting  rather  tailored  to 
strategically cover the territory and provide with effective services the different segments of the target 
group. The coordination between public and private veterinary sectors will also be part of issues to be 
discussed in Component 3, especially in the scope of support to veterinary legislation review. It is also 
important  to  mention  that  IFAD  is  already  contributing  to  strengthen  the  National  health  provision 
services through RDDP. 
Detailed description of activities and implementation modalities for sub component 1.3 
Activity 1.2.1. Establish Community based animal health systems 
148 
Rwanda 
Partnership for Resilient and Inclusive Small Livestock Markets (PRISM) 
Project Implementation Manual (DRAFT) 
140.  Training  of  Community  Agro-Vet  entrepreneurs  (CAVE):  In  communities 
benefitting from the graduation pathway (SC 1.1) CAVEs will be identified, trained and 
deployed to support animal wellbeing across all value chains. With knowledge in basic 
preventive  and  animal  health  care,  CAVEs  provide  services  to  the  community  under 
the  supervision  of  qualified  government  veterinary  staff.  CAVEs  have  a  high  school 
education  and  become  registered  service  providers  with  the  government.  This  model 
bridges the gap of government extension services, increases the animal wellbeing and 
productivity  and  generates  income  opportunities,  particularly  for  women  and  youth. 
Each  CAVE  is  trained  in  animal  well-being  and  conducting  basic  animal  care  ranging 
from administering vaccines to simple surgeries. CAVEs are equipped with animal well-
being  starter  kits  for  their  businesses  including:  a  thermometer;  antibiotics,  de-
wormers,  anticoccidials,  multi-vitamins;  ear-tag  applicator;  vaccination  kit;  vaccines; 
AI kits; surgical kits; cool box and icepacks; hoof trimmer; a motorcycle and other key 
supplies. Approximately 31 CAVEs will be trained and equipped.  
141.  Establishing  a  Community  Health  Fund:  Every  animal  beneficiary  is  sensitized  to 
contribute  towards  the  animal  health  insurance  scheme.  In  this  scheme,  a  famer 
contributes  between  Rwf  500  and  2000  (depending  on  the  general  assembly's 
decision)  and  pays  half  the  price  of  vet  drugs  prescribed  by  qualified  veterinary 
technician.  With  the  establishment  of  this  scheme,  animals  belonging  to  qualified 
farmers are treated at a subsidized cost, thereby reducing mortality. 
142.  Under  the  ENABEL-led  interventions,  a  complementary  approach  will  be  deployed  by 
Veterinaries  without  Borders  Belgium  (VSFB).  VSFB  will  train  and  support  the 
installation  of  private  veterinary  technicians  and  veterinary  doctors.  These  veterinary 
practitioners  will  have  a  higher  academic  level  than  the  CAVEs  trained  by  Heifer  and 
will address the needs of the more commercially oriented farmers, at national level. As 
for VBHCD and FFS, the two approaches will be complementary and address the needs 
of  different  producers’  categories.  ENABEL  will  also  train  private  veterinarians  for  the 
larger industrial producers, and these three levels of private veterinary services will be 
complementary and address all the needs of the value chain. 
Activity 1.2.2. Support dissemination of improved breeding stock 
143.  In  this  domain,  the  IFAD  supported  interventions  will  address  the  needs  of  the 
backyard  poultry  and  small  ruminants  sectors,  and  ENABEL  those  of  the  commercial 
pig and poultry sectors. 
144.  The  programme  will  provide  support  to  RAB  to  enable  this  institution  to  play  a  more 
prominent role in the genetic improvement of small ruminants, pigs and poultry. Since 
roles  and  responsibilities  differ  between  breeding  of  monogastric  species  and  small 
ruminants,  the  approach  will  be  different  according  to  species:  for  monogastric, 
breeding  and  genetic  improvement  are  mostly  undertaken  under  the  leadership  and 
responsibility  of  the  private  sector,  and  RAB  mostly  plays  a  role  of  facilitation, 
coordination,  supervision,  and  technical  capacity  building.  For  small  ruminants,  the 
private  sector  is  not  strong  enough,  farmers  are  mostly  smallholders  and  cannot 
handle  operations  of  selection  or  importation  of  improved  breeds.  Importation  of 
parent  stock,  multiplication  and  dissemination  of  improved  stock  must  therefore  be 
undertaken directly by RAB.  
149

Partnership for Resilient and Inclusive Small Livestock Markets (PRISM) 
Project Implementation Manual (DRAFT) 
145.  Support  to  pig  artificial  insemination  and  breeding,  and  production  of  DoC 
and  pullets  for  commercial  poultry.  The  programme  will  support  the  creation  of 
development of pig breeding centers, hatcheries and pullet producers through capacity 
building,  business  development  services  and  capital  strengthening.  The  two 
programme  partners  will  ensure  that  these  service  providers  are  providing  breeding 
stock  to  all  project  beneficiaries  including  those  supported  under  the  IFAD 
interventions.  This  will  be  done  under  the  ENABEL  activity  2.2.2  “Technical  advice, 
business development and financial support to businesses in the pig and poultry value 
chain  such  as  breeding  centres,  centre  of  excellence,  pullet  producers,  slaughter 
houses and meat processors”. 
146.  Support  to  small  ruminants  breeding.  The  IFAD  supported  project  will  provide 
support  to  the  RAB  Nyagatare  breeding  station,  to  enable  it  to  import  new  breeding 
stock  in  order  to  avoid  inbreeding,  and  to  facilitate  dissemination  of  offspring  in  the 
project  area,  in  particular  in  the  Southern  region  where  small  ruminants  are 
concentrated.  The  project  will  give  priority  to  the  Boer  breed,  which  constitutes  the 
largest part of the existing flock in Nyagatare and is the most demanded exotic breed. 
The crossbreeding with the local goats gives good results for meat production, which is 
the  main  purpose  of  goat  rearing  in  Rwanda,  and  does  not  affect  too  much  the 
reproduction  performance  (prolificity  and  fertility)  or  the  resistance  to  diseases  and 
drought.  The  project  will  support  the  upgrading  of  the  Nyagatare  station 
infrastructures,  and  the  dissemination  of  genetic  material.  The  dissemination  scheme 
for  offsprings  will  follow  a  two  layers  mechanism:  the  RAB  station  will  distribute 
crossed  (F1)  males  to  the  15  young  breeders  established  under  sub-component  1.2 
and will provide them with capacity building  top enable them to properly manage the 
reproduction. These young breeders will then cross these F1 males with local females 
and  produce  F2  (25%  boer)  animals,  that  will  be  placed  in  rural  households  in  the 
scope  of  the  Pass  On  the  Gift  Mechanism  implemented  by  Heifer  International  under 
sub-component 1.1., or sold on a private and commercial basis. 
147.  Support  to  genetic  improvement  of  backyard  poultry.  The  programme  will  not 
work  on  genetic  aspects  for  commercial  intensive  poultry  production,  since  these 
aspects  are  totally  handled  by  the  private  sector,  through  importation  of  hatching 
eggs,  day  old  chicks  or  parental  stock  for  the  production  of  highly  productive  hybrid 
strains.  The  programme  will  only  work  on  the  genetic  improvement  of  backyard  dual 
purpose  chicken.  The  programme  will  provide  support  to  RAB  to  source  selected 
breeds  and  strains  of  chicken,  and  multiply  them  through  the  specialized  young 
hatchers  established  under  sub-component  2.  To  identify  the  most  adequate  breeds 
and  strains,  the  project  will  support  the  participation  of  RAB  in  the  “African  Chicken 
Genetic Gain152” project implemented by a consortium of research organizations under 
the leadership of ILRI and funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Selected 
parental  stocks  will  be  sourced  locally  or  imported  (e.g.  Kuroiler  breed)  by  RAB  and 
distributed  to  the  15  breeders  equipped  with  solar  hatcheries.  RAB  will  provide 
technical support to these young entrepreneurs on a regular basis. The young farmers 
will  raise  the  chicks  until  the  age  of  2-3  months,  and  the  offspring  will  then  be 
purchased  by  the  Project  and  distributed  to  selected  households  in  the  scope  of  the 
152 https://africacgg.net/ 
150 
Rwanda 
Partnership for Resilient and Inclusive Small Livestock Markets (PRISM) 
Project Implementation Manual (DRAFT) 
Pass  On  the  Gift  (POG)  embedded  in  the  graduation  pathway  (sub  component  1.1.). 
Since  the  ratio  for  the  POG  will  be  one  male  for  10  females,  the  breeders  will  have 
males in excess that they will sell directly to farmers on a private basis. 
148.  This  activity  will  be  undertaken  under  the  supervision  and  coordination  of  RAB,  since 
animal breeding fully falls under its mandate and mission. 
149.  For small ruminants, the IFAD supported project will provide financial support to RAB 
to  import  the  additional  breeding  stock,  upgrade  the  Nyagatare  breeding  station 
facilities,  and  provide  capacity  building  services  to  the  youth  breeders.  Similar 
modalities will eb applied for poultry. In addition, an MoU could be signed with ILRI to 
formalize the collaboration with the “African Chicken Genetic Gain” project. 
150.  Heifer International will play a key role in the final dissemination of improved genetic 
material  through  the  dissemination  of  off  springs  produced  by  the  young  breeders 
supported under sub component 1.2. 
Activity 1.2.3. Support surveillance and control of small livestock diseases 
151.  In  order to  reduce the  risk of introduction of Transboundary Animal  Diseases (TADs), 
the project will strengthen the epidemio-surveillance capacities of veterinary services, 
with a particular focus on small livestock TADs that are endemic in the region but not 
present in the country: African Swine Fever (ASF), Peste des Petits Ruminants (PPR), 
Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI), and Rift Valley fever (RVF). The project will 
improve  surveillance  capacities  by  providing  support  on  three  important  aspects:  (i) 
the strengthening of passive surveillance networks, in particular in border regions, to 
enable early detection of potential introductions and outbreaks; (ii) the strengthening 
of laboratory capacities, to facilitate active surveillance and confirmation of outbreaks; 
and (iii) the capacity building of field agents. 
152.  Support to passive153 community based surveillance networks. The project will 
provide support to Districts to raise awareness of the communities an mobilize them to 
participate  actively  in  passive  surveillance  networks.  The  Community  Agro-Vet 
Entrepreneurs (CAVE) established under component 1.1  and the private veterinarians 
supported  by  VSFB  will  be  key  components  of  these  networks.  The  Districts  will 
provide information to communities on how to detect the main diseases at risk and will 
establish  information  circuits  through  efficient  communication  chains  and  designated 
focal points to enable the information to reach the veterinary authority in a swift way.  
153.  Strengthening  of  laboratory  capacities.  Rwanda  Dairy  Development  Project 
(RDDP)  is  currently  supporting  RAB  for  the  upgrading  of  the  central  veterinary 
laboratory  and  of  the  satellite  laboratories.  RDDP  also  provides  capacity  building  and 
technical  assistance  to  RAB  personnel.  The  project  will  complement  this  support  by 
providing  specific  equipment  and  kits  for  the  detection  of  small  livestock  diseases 
(PPR, ASF and HPAI). 
154.  Capacity building of field agents in surveillance. The district veterinary staff who 
will be in charge of  raising awareness and training communities will themselves need 
153 Passive surveillance is based on vigilance, observation and reporting of cases and outbreaks; active surveillance 
is based on systematic collection of samples and further analysis. 
151 
Rwanda

Project Implementation Manual (DRAFT) 
to be trained on epidemio-surveillance techniques and methodologies (e.g. syndromic 
epidemio-surveillance,  sampling  and  management  of  samples),  but  also  community 
mobilization and communication techniques.  
155.  Surveillance  of  TADs  is  a  core  public  mission  and  must  be  undertaken  by  the 
Veterinary Authority, which is represented by RAB at National level. RAB will therefore 
ensure the coordination and leadership for the implementation of this activity.  
156.  RAB will actively collaborate with the District Veterinary Services who will be in charge 
of  the  community  mobilization,  and  who  will  represent  the  intermediate  level  in  the 
chain of information and transmission of epidemiological data. The district will receive 
direct  support  from  the  project  for  the  field  activities  they  will  conduct.  For  the 
upgrading  of  laboratories,  the  needs  will  be  assessed  by  RAB  and  submitted  to  the 
project for approval. Trainings of District staff  will be undertaken at Province level by 
RAB scientists. 
Activity 1.2.4. Support preparedness to animal health crisis affecting small livestock species 
157.  The support provided by the IFAD supported project will benefit directly and entirely to 
the public veterinary authority which is mandated for preparing responses to sanitary 
crisis,  in  particular  when  these  crises  are  related  to  TADs  or  zoonotic  diseases.  This 
support will address three important aspects of preparedness: (i) the development of 
contingency  plans  (i)  the  implementation  of  simulation  exercises,  and  (ii)  the 
establishment of a contingency fund. 
158.  Development of contingency plans. In order to be ready to respond to any sanitary 
crisis,  veterinary  services  need  to  have  ready  and  up  to  date  contingency  plans  at 
hand, for each disease at risk (the response will be different depending on the specie 
affected, the epidemiology of the disease). Rwanda has already developed contingency 
plans for most of the major diseases affecting cattle (FMD), for PPR (modeled on the 
Pan African Plan) and for HPAI (developed in 2008 and updated in 2016); The project 
will therefore support the government to develop plans for ASF, which is missing, but 
also any other known or emerging disease depending on the epidemiological situation 
in the region and the actual major risks; It will also provide support to update the PPR 
and  HPAI  plans  when  necessary.  For  the  diseases  affecting  monogastric  species,  the 
project  will  partner  with  ENABEL  which  has  made  provisions  to  support  RAB  for  the 
same  purpose.  For  diseases  affecting  small  ruminants,  PPR  and  possibly  RVF,  the 
project will bear 100 % of the costs. This activity will be implemented jointly and co-
financed  by  ENABEL  under  activity  2.3.2  “Develop  an  animal  epidemic  contingency 
policy”. 
159.  Organization of simulation exercises: once the contingency plans are developed, it 
is  a  recommended  practice  to  undertake  simulation  exercises  to:  (i)  test  the 
Contingency Plan, (ii) build capacity of staff for implementation of the plan in almost 
real  conditions  (on  hands  training);  (iii)  test  operational  response  arrangements  and 
examine the liaison and interdependencies between the key operational partners (the 
deployment of the plan often requires cooperation between veterinary services, police, 
customs,  public  health  for  zoonotic  diseases,  which  makes  its  implementation  very 
complex). During the exercise, all components of the response will be reviewed, such 
as 
investigation,  biosecurity  measures, 
containment  barriers  as  well  as  cleaning  and  disinfection  processes  of  affected 
laboratory  diagnosis,  epidemiological 
152 
Rwanda

Project Implementation Manual (DRAFT) 
holdings.  The  project  will  support  the  organization  of  simulation  exercises  for  two 
diseases:  one  affecting  the  small  ruminants  (probably  PPR),  and  one  affecting 
monogastric  species  (ASF  or  HPAI).  This  activity  will  be  implemented  jointly  and  co-
financed  by  ENABEL  under  activity  2.3.2  “Develop  an  animal  epidemic  contingency 
policy”. 
160.  Establishment  of  a  contingency  fund  for  small  ruminants  diseases:  even  if  a 
contingency  plan  is  available  and  updated,  and  if  capacities  for  response  have  been 
strengthened and tested through simulation exercises, the deployment of an adequate 
response to a sanitary crisis also depend on the availability and accessibility of means, 
including  in  particular  financial  means,  to  implement  the  response  mechanisms.  The 
response  depends  on  the  disease  and  on  the  epidemiological  situation,  but  it  can 
require deployment of measures of containment, protection disinfection, restriction of 
movements,  establishment  of  buffer  zones  and  protection  zones,  preventive 
vaccination,  laboratory  testing,  and  even  in  some  cases  stamping  out  of  animals 
infected  or  at  risk.  All  these  measures  are  costly,  in  particular  stamping  out  which 
requires proper compensation of farmers affected. 
161.  The  project  will  establish  a  reserve  fund  that  will  constitute  the  primary  contingency 
fund.  In  case  of  eligible  sanitary  crisis,  the  government  of  Rwanda  may  use  part  or 
totality of these funds to finance emergency response, in line with the mutually agreed 
operational guidelines and criteria for eligibility of the crisis. If the primary allocation is 
not  sufficient,  the  Government  may  also  request  to  reallocate  resources  from  the 
unallocated  expenditure  category  if  they  are  still  available.  Detailed  operational 
guidelines  and  criteria  for  eligibility  of  the  crisis  will  be  developed  to  guide  the 
utilization of the funds. Should this activity be triggered, all expenditures will be made 
in accordance with IFAD procurement rules applicable to emergency situations.  
162.  The  implementation  of  this  activity  will  be  coordinated  and  overseen  by  the  National 
Veterinary  Services  in  RAB.  For  the  development  of  contingency  plans  and  the 
organization  of  the  simulation  exercises,  they  will  receive  technical  support  from  the 
FAO-ECTAD154 regional team located in Nairobi. FAO-ECTAD is highly specialized in this 
kind of exercise and has a unique comparative advantage. An MoU will be established 
with FAO for this purpose. FAO-ECTAD will involve OIE155 experts in these activities but 
under  their  mutual  arrangements  and  the  project  will  not  enter  in  any  form  of  direct 
partnership  with  OIE.  The  participation  of  OIE  will  ensure  that  all  mechanism 
established are conform to international standards and guidelines. 
163.  The contingency fund will be housed on a bank account owned and managed by RAB. 
The  utilization  of  funds  will  be  made  possible  only  if  the  crisis  fulfills  the  criteria 
mutually  agreed  upon,  and  should  be  done  according  to  the  operational  guidelines. 
These criteria and operational guidelines will be developed the first year of the project 
and submitted to IFAD for approval. The transfer of the funds on the bank account will 
be  done  only  after  approval  of  these  two  sets  of  documents.  Utilization  of  funds 
housed in the special account will also require a preliminary authorization from IFAD.

Sub component 1.3: Support climate smart innovations 
Detailed description of activities and implementation modalities for sub component 1.3 
164.  In  order  to  mitigate  potential  negative  impact  of  small  livestock  production 
intensification,  the  programme  will  promote  several  activities  for  mainstreaming 
environmental  management  and  climate  change  adaptation  and  mitigation  including: 
(i) enhanced feed efficiency through the promotion of fodder trees and shrub species 
(agroforestry)  and  use  of  crop  residues  at  farm  level;  (ii)  manure  management 
through  adoption  of  biogas  systems  and  composting;  (iii)  improved  water  efficiency 
through rainwater harvesting facilities installed at farm level.  
Activity 1.3.1 Promotion of agroforestry with self- formed groups and youth groups  
165.  Nurseries will be established156 to promote fodder trees and shrubs species as animal 
feed.  Agroforestry  has  multiple  additional  benefits,  namely  reduced  soil  erosion  and 
improved  slope  stability;  water 
increased  resilience  to  heavy  rains  through 
management and nutrient recycling which improve agricultural production and carbon 
sequestration.  This  activity  will  be  implemented  together  with  Heifer,  with  50  groups 
targeted in Year 1, 50- groups targeted in year 2 and 40 groups to be targeted in year 
3.  
Activity 1.3.2 Manure management and biogas 
166.  Small  livestock  produce  rich  manure  which  is  a  valuable  source  of  organic  plant 
nutrients, improves soil fertility and reduces the need for chemical fertilizers. The IFAD 
supported project will promote the installation of biogas plant at pigs farm and better 
manure composting and application at household level. The project will promote  both 
the  flexible  biogas  systems  which  are  low  cost,  easy  to  install  and  adapted  to  small 
156 14 nurseries in each of the district in which Heifer will implement the graduation pathway

scale farming, and fixed dome systems, which are more durable.. The beneficiaries will 
contribute  in  form  of  local  labor  (for  digging  the  pit  in  particular)  and  local  material 
(sand  and  gravel),  and  in  cash  for  a  percentage  of  around  20%  (which  could  be 
provided  through  a  loan  with  a  SACCO)This  activity  will  benefit  to  smallholder 
commercial  farmers  supported  by  both  partners  and  will  be  co-financed  and 
implemented jointly with ENABEL (under activity 1.2.3 
specific 
green investments”).  
“Co-financing  of 
Activity 1.4.3 Promotion of rainwater harvesting with youth groups  
167.  All  youth  groups  will  be  supported  to  establish  communal  rainwater  harvesting  and 
storage  systems  in  order  to  increase  access  to  water  at  their  small  livestock 
production sites and improve hygiene.  The youth group will contribute in kind to this 
investment (unskilled labor and local materials). 
Activity 1.3.3 Promotion of low-cost water harvesting technologies at household levels 
168.  Less  than  47%  of  households  in  Rwanda  have  access  to  water  within  500  meters  of 
their residence157. Water harvesting/ fetching is hence a daily burden for both women 
and  children.  In  addition,  small  livestock  rearing  will  increase  water  needs  at 
household  level.  Therefore,  the  project  will  subsidize158  the  construction  of  low-cost 
and small scale water harvesting and small storage technologies (e.g. small scale farm 
ponds) for 3,000 households. The beneficiary household will contribute to 50% of total 
cost  in  kind  (local  materials  and  inputs  and  labour)  and  the  remaining  50%  will  be 
financed  by  the  project  (purchased  materials  and  inputs).  This  activity  will  be 
implemented, together with Heifer, and shall be implemented in year 2 and 3 to allow 
enough  time  for  households  to  save  enough  money  to  contribute  to  the  cost  of  the 
low-cost rainwater harvesting storage units.

Component 2: Support to Small Livestock Value Chain Development  
169.  This  component  will  strive  to  strengthen  the  organizational  and  entrepreneurial  skills 
of the project beneficiaries and improve their backward and forward linkages to access 
input,  service  and  output  markets.  Different  investments  will  support  this  objective, 
including  (i)  support  to  the  development  of  a  local  feed  industry  (ii)  soft  support 
(facilitating “productive alliances”, raising the appetite of financial institutions to serve 
these specific value chains, promoting  multistakeholder fora), and (iii) investments in 
public  and  private  infrastructure  to  raise  the  compliance  to  food  safety  and  animal 
welfare standards and reduce environmental externalities. 
Support to animal feed industry  
170.  This set of activities will be led and funded by ENABEL, and will aim at supporting the 
emergence  of  a  national  feed  industry  based  as  much  as  possible  on  quality  locally 
produced raw materials (maize and soya), in order the reduce the country dependency 
on  imports,  that  weakens  the  whole  poultry  and  pig  value  chains.  Through  the 
implementation  of  FFS,  the  programme  will  develop  profitable,  resilient  and 
sustainable soya and maize farms which run their farms as business with sustainable 
links  to  input  suppliers  and  buyers.  It  will  also  develop  a  reliable  and  sustainable 
supply  system  of  locally  produced  soya  bean  for  feed  companies  through  the  out-
grower company model and will provide a tailor-made technical support and business 
development support for feed companies. Finally, it will set up a feed industry research 
fund  to  support  innovative  research,  in  particular  on  technologies  aiming  at 
incorporating more local ingredients in feed formulas. 
Sub-Component 2.1: Productive Alliances and support to entrepreneurship in production 
Detailed description of activities and implementation modalities for SC2.1. Productive Alliances 
and support to entrepreneurship in production 
171.  A  productive  alliance  is  a  contractual  arrangement  whereby  farmers  enter  into  an 
agreement  with  either  an  input  supplier,  an  aggregator  or  a  service  provider,  who 
guarantees  access  to  inputs,  market  or  services  to  the  farmers  on  mutually  agreed 
conditions. In the case of PRISM, productive alliances will be sought in the poultry and 
pig  value  chains,  building  on  arrangements  that  are  already  often  used  by  Rwandan 
animal  feed  manufacturers  to  expand  their  customer  outreach.  Under  these  alliances 
the IFAD supported project aims at supporting 525 broiler farmers, 450 layer farmers, 
and  450  pig  fatteners.  While  the  support  to  productive  alliances  in  broiler  and  layer 
farming  is  foreseen  to  cover  all  target  15  districts,  the  productive  alliances  in  pig 
raising  will  concentrate  on  the  districts  that  are  natural  production  basins  with  the 
existence  of  significant,  though  often  informal  pig  trade.  The  beneficiaries  of  these 
productive  alliances  will  typically  belong  to  ubudehe  categories  2  and  3;  they  are 
already engaged in more entrepreneurial logic than target beneficiaries in component 
1 and have the capacity to contribute to the start-up capital investment in cash and/or 
through a loan from financial institutions supported by the project (see below activities 
2.1.1 and 2.3.1).  
172.  All activities related to productive alliances will be placed under the direct supervision 
of the Agribusiness Specialist at SPIU, who will work in close coordination with (i) the 
Access  to  Finance  Specialist  to  ensure  active  linkage  with  financial  institutions  (see 
157 
Rwanda 
Partnership for Resilient and Inclusive Small Livestock Markets (PRISM) 
Project Implementation Manual (DRAFT) 
also  sub-component  2.3);  and  (ii)  the  SPIU  Livestock  Specialist  and  RAB  technicians 
for issues related to animal feeding and animal health. 
173.  In  the  first  year  of  the  project,  the  SPIU  will  launch  a  call  for  expression  of  interest 
among  all  input  suppliers  operating  in  Rwanda,  particularly  (but  not  exclusively) 
targeting the major companies such as Zamura Feeds, Premier Animal Feeds Industry 
(PAFI), Gorilla Feeds, Poultry East Africa Ltd (PEAL), Agribusiness Solutions (ABUSOL), 
Pro-Dev  and  Huye  Animal  Feeds,  as  well  as  Uzima  Ckicken  and  Easy  Hatch  for  the 
production  of  Day  Old  Chicks.  The  interested  input  supplier(s)  =  ‘Partner(s)  in 
productive  alliances’  will  then  sign  a  contract  with  RAB/SPIU  to  implement  the 
activities foreseen in this sub-component. 
Activity 2.1.1: Productive alliances in broiler farming 
174.  In  this  model  the  feed  manufacturer  =  ‘Broiler  Partner’  will  be  at  the  same  time  an 
input  supplier  and  a  service  provider,  and  possibly  an  off-taker  of  the  end  product, 
thus also guaranteeing the market for broiler farmers, if he wishes to do so. This type 
of productive alliance is based on the pilot set up by Zamura Feeds with the support of 
Feed  the  Future/USAID-funded  project  Tworore  Inkoko,  Twunguke  (Let's  Raise 
Chickens, and Make a Profit in Kinyarwanda)159.  
175.  Development  of  network  in  poultry  broilers.  The  project  will  support  the  ‘Broiler 
Partner(s)’  (who  could  be  Zamura  Feeds,  or  any  other  feed  manufacturer  willing  and 
capable of engaging in such broiler contractual arrangement) in developing a network 
of  broiler  farmers.  The  mobilization  will  be  made  by  the  ‘Broiler  Partner’  through 
weekly village meetings. The eligibility criteria for beneficiary farmers will particularly 
insist on the ability to comply with bio-security requirements, the level of acceptance 
of the family head (man or woman) to engage in this new economic activity, and the 
capacity to raise a significant contribution to the investment capital.  
176.  Selected beneficiaries will be involved in consecutive batches of maximum 25 farmers 
at a time.  They will initially receive  from the  ‘Broiler Partner’  an intensive 3 to 4-day 
training package  with a blend of classroom and practical on-farm training sessions to 
get  acquainted  with  all  stages  of  broiler  production,  from  the  reception  of  Day  One 
Chicks  (see  support  to  investment  capital  below)  to  the  final  slaughtering  stage.  The 
training  will  also  include  a  specific  topic  on  the  composting  of  chicken  manure  at  the 
end of the first 42-day cycle.  
177.  A  simple,  user  friendly  tool  will  be  developed  by  the  ‘Broiler  Partner’  to  enable  each 
beneficiary to record his/her daily interventions and costs of production. Follow up will 
be  provided  by  the  ‘Broiler  Partner’  on  a  regular  basis  along  the  first  two  cycles  in 
order to ensure proper implementation of technical advices and minimize failure risks. 
A specific training on nutrition will be delivered by the ‘Broiler Partner’ during the last 
159 Feed the Future Tworore Inkoko, Twunguke is a partnership between the University of Tennessee Institute of Agriculture (UTIA) 
and  Zamura  Feeds,  Ltd.  (Rwanda),  with  support  from  USAID/Rwanda  and  the  African  Sustainable  Agriculture Project  (ASAP) 
Foundation, to provide expertise, training, and resources for smallholder broiler chicken production. With the ultimate outcome being 
improvements in both household income and nutrition for participants, the activity seeks to improve the livelihood of farmers living in 
Musanze  District,  Rwanda.  Through  Tworore  Inkoko,  750  men  and  women  will  have  the  training  and  a  support  package  to 
successfully produce broiler chickens. At the end of each grow-out cycle, farmers have a guaranteed market to sell their birds, as 
well as the option to consume some of their chickens, adding protein to the household diet.

week  of  the  cycle,  to  sensitize  the  farmers  on  the  interest  to  complement  their  diet 
with chicken-source food. The content of this training will be shared with the Nutrition 
Specialist at SPIU for approval before it is delivered to broiler farmers. 
178.  To  support this activity, the project will contribute 50% of the cost  estimated at USD 
750 per farmer, including mobilization, training and intensive follow-up during the first 
two cycles. 
179.  Support  to  investment  capital  for  broilers  farmers.  The  start-up  investment 
capital  will  consist  of  a  package  including  the  chicken  building  (standard  3x3m),  the 
necessary equipment (feeders, waterers, wheelbarrow), and a first batch of 100 DOC 
broilers.  This  package  is  estimated  at  a  maximum  of  USD  480,  to  which  the  project 
will  contribute  up  to  30%.  The  beneficiary  will  provide  the  remaining  part  of  the 
investment, either in cash or through a bank loan. The beneficiary will also provide the 
land to erect the chicken house160. The ‘Broiler Partner’ will be in charge of sourcing all 
required  materials,  equipment  and  DOCs  and  ensuring  that  the  chicken  houses  are 
constructed as per its own set of standards.  
180.  Service  fee  to  support  broiler  farmers.  The  ‘Broiler  Partner’  will  guarantee  the 
market  to  project  beneficiaries  supported  under  this  productive  alliance.  The  service 
foreseen in this activity will include the collection of ready-to-kill chicken at farmgate, 
and payment of broiler to the farmer at average market price. The  fee will be USD 5 
per cycle and per farmer, paid 100% by the project over the first five cycles of broiler 
production  (i.e.  over  the  first  year  of  production).  Once  the  marketing  channels  are 
well  established  and  the  broiler  farmer  experienced  enough  to  produce  and  sell  the 
broilers on his/her own, the project will facilitate direct contractual arrangements with 
the ‘Broiler Partner’ and withdraw its service fee support.  
Activity 2.1.2. Productive alliances in layer farming 
181.  In  this  model  the  ‘Layer  Partner’  will  be  first  and  foremost  an  input  supplier  and  a 
technical  service  provider.  This  type  of  productive  alliance  builds  on  the  informal 
arrangements  already  put  in  place  by  companies  like  ABUSOL,  who  started  engaging 
with  egg  producers  by  providing  technical  advice  on  how  best  to  feed  their  layer 
chickens  in  order  to  increase  egg  production.  The  farmers  to  participate  in  these 
productive alliances will be selected following a call for proposal made at district level, 
indicating  precisely  the  eligibility  criteria  and  conditions  of  project  support  under  the 
productive alliance model promoted in layer farming. 
182.  Support to investment capital for 500 layers. The start-up investment capital will 
consist of a package including the chicken building (7 chicken per square meter), the 
necessary equipment (feeders, waterers, wheelbarrow, etc.), and a first batch of 500 
DOC  layers.  This  package  is  estimated  at  a  maximum  of  USD  4,000,  to  which  the 
project will contribute to the tune  of 30%.  The beneficiary will provide the remaining 
part of the investment, either in cash or through a bank loan. The beneficiary will also 
provide  the  land  to  erect  the  layer  house  and  a  room  to  store  the  equipment  and 
inputs (esp. feed). The  standard design of a 500-layer house will be prepared by the 
‘Layer  Partner’  as  part  of  its  technical  support  (see  paragraph  below);  it  will  be 
160 (estimated at about 12m2 including access to the 3x3 chicken house)

reviewed  by  the  SPIU  Civil  Works  Engineer  prior  approval  and  co-financing  by  the 
project. 
183.  Technical support to layer farmers. Besides the provision of standard design for a 
500-layer house (see above), the ‘Layer Partner’ will provide technical advice to layer 
farmers  engaged  in  the  productive  alliance.  The  curriculum  will  be  drafted  by  the 
‘Layer Partner’ based on the best practices that apply to this value chain in Rwanda’s 
context.  Before  approval  by  the  SPIU,  the  curriculum  will  be  revised  by  PRISM 
Livestock  Specialist  at  the  SPIU,  who  may  also  seek  additional  inputs  from  RAB 
specialists  in  layer  feeding  and  veterinary  care  if  necessary.  The  technical  advice  will 
be provided by the ‘Layer Partner’ to farmers on an individual basis, all along the first 
cycle of layers (equivalent to about 18 months), with a particular emphasis on the first 
4-5 months after reception of DOCs, i.e. the critical pre-laying period (requiring about 
60% of the total technical support). The technical advice fee is estimated at USD 100 
per  farmer  in  the  first  cycle  of  layer  production,  to  which  the  project  will  contribute 
50%,  while  the  remaining  50%  will  be  borne  by  the  ‘Layer  Partner’.  Once  the  broiler 
farmer  is  experienced  enough  to  produce  eggs  in  a  commercial  way,  the  project  will 
facilitate direct contractual arrangements with the ‘Layer Partner’ (if technical advice is 
still needed) and withdraw its technical advice fee support. 
184.  Business  development  support  to  enhance  entrepreneurship  skills  and 
financial  literacy  of  Layer  Farmers.  This  support  will  be  delivered  by  Business 
Development Services  Providers (BDSPs) who  will be recruited through a competitive 
process  (e.g.  call  for  proposal)  during  the  first  year  of  the  project,  in  order  to  be 
operational  at  the  beginning  of  Year  2.  The  key  deliverables  of  the  layer  BDSPs  will 
focus  around  the  ability  of  egg  producers  to  (i)  record,  calculate  and  analyse  their 
production  costs;  (ii)  monitor  their  break-even  point  and  make  enlightened  decisions 
as  regards  to  working  capital  needs,  selling  prices,  new  investments,  etc.;  (iii) 
understand the market demand in terms of quality, volumes, timely delivery; and (iv) 
present  bankable  business  plans  to  financial institutions  whenever  a  loan  is  solicited. 
The  layer  BDSPs  will  work  in  very  close  coordination  with  the  other  BDSPs  foreseen 
under sub-component 2.2, who will be in charge of developing the supplier network for 
final off-takers of eggs. 
185.  It  is  foreseen  that  5  such  layer  BDSPs  will  be  contracted,  each  supporting  ultimately 
90  layer  farmers  across  three  districts  on  average.  The  level  of  effort  will  gradually 
raise  along  the  years  as  the  project  supports  more  and  more  layer  farmers  (see 
implementation plan below). The BDSPs’ contract will be established for one year and 
renewed according to their performance. The contract will be based on a lump sum of 
USD  1,200  per  month  including  the  fees  (staff  cost)  and  the  operating  costs 
(transport,  per  diem,  etc.).  All  in  all,  a  total  of  60  man/month  is  foreseen  for  layer 
BDSPs.  The  project  will  not  purchase  vehicles  or  any  other  equipment  for  the  layer 
BDSPs. 
Activity 2.1.3: Productive alliances in pig fattening 
186.  Like  productive  alliances  in  layers,  in  this  model  the  ‘Pig  Partner’  will  be  first  and 
foremost  an  input  supplier  and  a  technical  service  provider.  Companies  like  Vision 
Agribusiness  Farm,  who  started  engaging  with  pig  producers  by  providing  technical 
support and developing their business plans, may be considered as active partners in 
160 
Rwanda 
Partnership for Resilient and Inclusive Small Livestock Markets (PRISM) 
Project Implementation Manual (DRAFT) 
the  pig  productive  alliances.  The  farmers  to  participate  in  these  productive  alliances 
will be selected following a call for proposal made at district level, indicating precisely 
the eligibility criteria and conditions of project support under productive alliance in pig 
fattening. 
187.  Support  to  investment  capital  for  10  fattening  pigs.  The  start-up  investment 
capital  will  consist  of  a  package  including  the  pigsty  (2  cages  for  10  pigs),  the 
necessary  equipment  (feeders,  waterers,  wheelbarrow,  etc.),  and  a  start-up  batch  of 
10  piglets.  This  package  is  estimated  at  a  maximum  of  USD  1,500,  of  which  the 
project will contribute 30%. The beneficiary will contribute to the remaining part of the 
investment, either in cash or through a bank loan. The beneficiary will also provide the 
land to erect the pigsty and a room to store the equipment and inputs (esp. feed). The 
standard design of a 10-head pigsty will be prepared by the ‘Pig Partner’ as part of its 
technical  support  (see  paragraph  below);  it  will  be  reviewed  by  the  SPIU  Civil  Works 
Engineer prior approval and co-financing by the project. 
188.  Technical  support  to  pig  farmers.  Besides  the  provision  of  standard  design  for  a 
10-head  pigsty  (see  above),  the  ‘Pig  Partner’  will  provide  technical  advice  to  pig 
farmers engaged in a productive alliance, along the same principle as the layer model. 
The  curriculum  will  be  drafted  by  the  ‘Pig  Partner’  based  on  the  best  practices  that 
apply  to  this  value  chain  in  Rwanda’s  context.  Before  approval  by  the  SPIU,  the 
curriculum  will  be  revised  by  PRISM  Livestock  Specialist  at  the  SPIU,  who  may  also 
seek  additional  inputs  from  RAB  specialists  in  layer  feeding  and  veterinary  care  if 
necessary.  The  technical  advice  will  be  provided  to  farmers  on  an  individual  basis 
along 2 cycles  of production (equivalent to about one year).  The technical advice fee 
will be USD 100 per farmer, paid 50% by the project and 50% by the ‘Pig Partner’ over 
the first two cycles of pig production (i.e. over the first year of pig fattening). Once the 
pig  farmer  is  experienced  enough  to  fatten  his/her  pigs  in  a  commercial  way,  the 
project will facilitate direct contractual arrangements with the ‘Pig Partner’ (if technical 
advice is still needed) and withdraw its technical advice fee support. 
189.  Business  development  support  to  enhance  entrepreneurship  skills  and 
financial  literacy  of  Pig  Farmers.  This  support  will  be  delivered  by  Business 
Development Services  Providers (BDSPs) who  will be recruited through a competitive 
process  (Call  for  Proposal)  the  first  year  of  the  project,  in  order  to  be  operational  at 
the  beginning  of  Year  2.  The  key  deliverables  of  the  pig  BDSPs  will  focus  around  the 
ability  of  pig  fatteners  to  (i)  record,  calculate  and  analyse  their  production  costs;  (ii) 
monitor their break-even point and make enlightened decisions as regards to working 
capital  needs,  selling  prices,  new  investments,  etc.;  (iii)  understand  the  market 
demand  in  terms  of  quality,  volumes,  timely  delivery;  and  (iv)  present  bankable 
business plans to financial institutions whenever a loan is solicited. The pig BDSPs will 
work in very close  coordination with the other  BDSPs foreseen under  sub-component 
2.2,  who  will  be  in  charge  of  developing  the  supplier  network  for  processors, 
public/private abattoirs and final off-takers of pig meat. 
190.  It is  foreseen that up to 5 such BDSPs will be contracted,  each  supporting ultimately 
90 pig farmers in the targeted districts. However, given that the productive alliance in 
pig fattening will be concentrated on a few districts that are the traditional production 
161 
Rwanda 
Partnership for Resilient and Inclusive Small Livestock Markets (PRISM) 
Project Implementation Manual (DRAFT) 
basins,  one  can  envisage  that  the  project  will  hire  less  than  5  BDSPs,  in  which  case 
each  BDSP  will  be  in  charge  of  more  than  90  pig  farmers161.  The  level  of  effort  will 
gradually  raise  along  the  years  as  the  project  supports  more  and  more  pig  farmers 
(see implementation plan below). The BDSPs’ contract will be established for one year 
and  renewed  according  to  their  performance.  The  contract  will  be  based  on  a  lump 
sum  of  USD  1,200  per  month  including  the  fees  (staff  cost)  and  the  operating  costs 
(transport,  per  diem,  etc.).  All  in  all,  a  total  of  60  man/month  is  foreseen  for  layer 
BDSPs.  The  project  will  not  purchase  vehicles  or  any  other  equipment  for  the  pig 
BDSPs. 
Activity 2.1.4: Support to youth entrepreneurship in production  
191.  The project will target unemployed rural youth that are willing to start small livestock 
production  enterprises  and  will  assist  them  to  establish  viable  and  profitable 
production  units  for  pigs  and  poultry,  that  could  ultimately  graduate  to  commercially 
oriented  producers  and  enter  in  productive  alliance  arrangements.  However,  to 
compensate  the  handicaps  of  youth  compared  to  “ordinary”  productive  alliance 
beneficiaries  (lack  of  experience,  skills,  land  and  capital),  the  project  will  provide  a 
more  incentivized  specific  support  package.  The  project  will  build  on  the  approach 
already  implemented  by  MINAGRI  in  the  scope  of  the  “small  livestock  for  youth 
programme” and will support groups of ten youth on average, located on the same site 
but  with  independent  production  units.  The  support  package  will  include  initial 
intensive  technical  and  business  management  support,  continuous  tutoring  through 
business coaches, provision of start-up capital for investment and working capital, and 
linkages to financial service providers. 
192.  1,530  young  people  in  total  will  be  targeted  through  this  programme  (100  per 
targeted District in average). These youth will be selected through a call for expression 
of interest launched in all Districts. They will have to be aged between 16 and 30, to 
demonstrate interest in agriculture and livestock, to be un-employed, and to belong to 
Ubedehe  category  1,  2  or  3.  The  project  will  give  priority  to  young  people  with  low 
level  of  education  (primary  level  completed  and/or  enrolled  in  secondary  education) 
and TVET graduates.  
193.  For  these  1,530  beneficiaries,  the  project  will  support  the  creation  of  the  following 
startup businesses: 
 
 
 
 
Pig fattening: 450 units will be established. Each unit will accommodate 10 pigs and 2 
batches will be fattened per year. 
Pig breeding: 50 units will be established. Each unit will accommodate 3 sows. The breeders 
will supply the fatteners with piglets but will also produce piglets that will be placed under the 
POG programme for vulnerable households under sub-component 1.1. 
Broiler production: 500 unit will be established; Each unit will accommodate 250 broilers per 
batch; depending on the cycle duration, they will produce 4 to 6 batches per year. 
Egg production (layers): 500 unit will be established; Each unit will accommodate 250 layers 
per batch and the duration of each cycle will be around 18 months. 
161 Note : if less BDSPs are used in the pig productive alliances, the overall budget for this support will remain the 
same, but the share to each BDSP will increase according to the level of effort required to support more farmers.

Project Implementation Manual (DRAFT) 
194.  Production  of  pullets  and  cockerels  for  backyard  chicken  production.  15  pilot 
units  will  be  established  (one  per  District).  Each  unit  will  include  a  small  building 
accommodating  the  parental  stock  for  egg  production,  a  solar  hatchery,  and  a  chick 
raising unit where chicks will be raised until the age of 2 months. Some of the pullets 
and cockerels will be purchased by the project and placed under the POG programme 
for vulnerable households under SC 1.1. Others (males in excess in particular) will be 
sold directly to farmers for backyard poultry meat production. The parental stock will 
be provided by RAB under activity 1.3.2. described further. 
195.  Goat breeding units. 15 units will be established. These units will produce improved 
goats  (25%  Boer,  75  %  local)  that  will  then  be  purchased  by  the  project  and  placed 
under the POG programme for  vulnerable households under SC 1.1. The males (50% 
Boer) will be provided by RAB under activity 1.3.2. described further. The females will 
be of local breed. 
196.  For  the  selection  of  the  1,530  beneficiaries,  a  full  set  of  selection  criteria  will  be 
developed  during  the  inception  phase  by  SPIU  and  validated  by  the  project  steering 
committee.  The  selection  beneficiaries  will  be  done  by  District  committees  following 
the launch of the call. The District committees will be composed of Project focal points 
at  District  level,  project  local  coordinators,  the  District  Cooperative  Development 
Officers, the District Agribusiness officers, and the District Animal Resources Officers. 
197.  The  1,530  youth  will  be  installed  in  a  progressive  and  phase  manner.  A  proposed 
phasing is shown below:

198.  Initial  technical  and  business  capacity  building.  Before  the  reception  of  animals  and 
attribution  of  the  startup  package,  the  beneficiaries  will  undergo  an  initial  training 
curriculum of two weeks.  Each training will gather the 8 to 12 members  of the  same 
group. The training will be organized at the District level for the theoretical part, and 
on selected voluntary farms for the practical aspects. The first week of the training will 
be dedicated to technical aspects: production itineraries, health management including 
hygiene and biosecurity, feeding, animal welfare, waste management, production data 
recording,  among  other  topics.  The  second  week  will  be  dedicated  to  business, 
financial management and social-related aspects: book keeping, financial management 
and  planning,  marketing,  nutrition  education  and  gender  awareness  training.  The 
technical  and  business  training  will  be  organized  and  provided  by  private  Business 
Development  Service  providers  with  both  technical  competences  pertaining  to  the 
groups activities, and business and financial management support capacities. They will 
be assisted by the District Cooperative Development Officers, the District Agribusiness 
163 
Rwanda 
Partnership for Resilient and Inclusive Small Livestock Markets (PRISM) 
Project Implementation Manual (DRAFT) 
officers, and the District Animal Resources Officers. In the case of nutrition and gender 
awareness trainings, these will be implemented by the Districts. 
199.  Coaching  and  provision  of  Business  Development  Services  nutrition  and  gender  training. 
The  same  private  Business  Development  Services  Provider  (BDSP)  as  for  other 
productive alliance beneficiaries will be contracted as well to provide continuous BDS / 
coaching  to  the  youth.  Each  group  will be  visited  every  week  by  a  business  coaches, 
who  will  provide  a  close  follow  up  and  individual  support  to  each  beneficiary 
individually, and to the  group. The coaches  will also provide feedback  to the  Districts 
staff and the project on the performance of the youth businesses. 
200.  The  BDSP  providing  the  initial  training  (activity  1.2.1.)  and  the  coaching  (activity 
1.2.2.) to the 150 youth groups will be recruited during the inception phase through a 
competitive process (Call for Proposal). A maximum of three service providers will be 
contracted (1 for 5 Districts and for each 50 groups). The contract will be established 
for one  year and  renewed according to performance.  The  contract will be based  on a 
lump  sum  per  beneficiary  including  the  fees  (staff  cost)  and  the  operating  costs 
(transport).  The  project  will  not  purchase  vehicles  or  any  other  equipment  for  the 
BDSP. 
201.  The project will participate to the cost incurred by the Districts for their contribution to 
the initial training and the continuous coaching. Annual lumpsum based on the number 
of groups supported will be allocated to Districts to cover the costs of transport of their 
contributing  staff  (covering  fuel  costs  and  DSA).  The  staff  salaries  will  constitute  the 
contribution of Districts. 
202.  Assets building and provision of startup package for youth. The startup package for each 
beneficiary will be composed of the followings: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Construction of the premises: each youth will have its own independent production unit 
(poultry house, pigsty), to enable the beneficiaries to manage their own business 
independently, improve their ownership and responsibility, but also to enhance biosecurity 
and reduce sanitary risks. For broilers and layers, each site will gather 10 units in average, of 
the same nature. For pigs, each site will gather 9 fatteners and one breeder (who will supply 
the 9 fatteners). The goat breeding units and hatcheries for village chicken will be 
established as standalone units. 
Even if the production units themselves will be independent, on collective sites, common 
infrastructures will also be established: a feed store for all groups, an egg store for layers 
production groups, a small slaughtering room with solar refrigeration facility for broiler 
production groups. 
The collective sites will all be equipped with water harvesting systems, and the pig 
production sites will be equipped with a collective biogas unit (see S.C. 1.4). 
Small equipment (feeders, drinkers, tools) will be provided by the project. 
The land will be provided by local authorities. 
The project will also provide the startup animal stock and inputs for the first six months 
(chicks and piglets, feed for 6 months, a 6-month veterinary package (follow up and standard 
prophylactic program including drugs). 
203.  The youth financing package will include a grant representing 70% of the cash needs 
to  start  the  enterprise  (excluding  land  to  be  provided  by  the  District),  the  residual 
amount of 30% being financed by  a loan in case the  beneficiary cannot mobilize this 
amount,  which  is  highly  likely.  Grant  will  be  managed  by  BDF.  To  facilitate  access  to 
164 
Rwanda 
Partnership for Resilient and Inclusive Small Livestock Markets (PRISM) 
Project Implementation Manual (DRAFT) 
the  loan,  the  project  will  organize  training  sessions  at  district  level  for  shortlisted 
financial  institutions  (Banks,  MFIs  and  SACCOs)  aiming  at  raising  their  appetite  for 
small  livestock  value  chains  and  supporting  them  to  design  or  refine  affordable 
products  and  delivery  channels  for  different  categories  of  beneficiaries  supported  by 
the project, including the youth. During the training, the youth financing model will be 
presented,  including  matching  grant  of  70%  to  be  provided  by  the  project,  and 
suggested loan features for the residual 30% to be financed by the FI. This will include 
loan  amount,  purpose  of  the  loan,  required  graced  period  and  repayment  modalities 
based on cash flow analysis for each type of business, and possible collaterals (group 
joint liability and possible guarantee by BDF or other guarantee mechanism). Technical 
and business development support provided by the project will also be presented since 
it  will  contribute  to  mitigate  lending  risk.  The  project  will  then  organize  fora  to 
facilitate  linkages  between  farmers  and  FIs  that  have  confirmed  interest  to  increase 
their engagement in the sector and have designed adapted products following training 
by  the  project  which  are  ready  for  promotion,  including  for  the  youth.  Youth  will  be 
invited  by  the  project  and  will  thus  have  the  opportunity  to identify  and  engage  with 
FIs for the financing of their enterprise. 
204.  A  specialized  service  provider  will  be  contracted  during  the  inception  phase  to  draft 
standard blue prints for the infrastructures that will be built for youth.  
205.  The  construction  of  infrastructures,  including  livestock  keeping  premises,  stores, 
biogas units, water harvesting systems will be contracted to specialized private public 
works contractors.  
206.  The  provision  of  equipment  and  feed  startup  packages  will  be  contracted  to  private 
sector firms and the veterinary packages (services and drugs) to private veterinarians, 
preferably those established in the project area. 
207.  The  project  will  facilitate  linkage  of  the  youths  with  BDF  to  access  matching  grant 
funded by the project,  under an addendum to  the MoU already  signed between SPIU 
and BDF. 
208.  To  facilitate  access  to  loans  from  the  financial  sector  in  complement  to  the  matching 
grant if required, the project will deploy various measures described into details under 
sub component 2.3. 
209.  Complementarities  and  alignment  with  ENABEL  supporter  intervention:  ENABEL 
pursues the objective of targeting at least 30% of youth under its activities supporting 
producers.  These  activities  are  activity  1.2.4  –  “Access  to  finance  for  livestock 
farmers”,  and  activity  2.2.1  –  “Support  the  creation  of  industrial  pig  and  poultry 
farms”.  The  support  provided  under  these  activities  will,  as  under  IFAD  intervention, 
combine  technical  and  business  training  and  coaching,  facilitation  of  access  to  credit 
and  matching  grants.  The  maximum  percentage  of  matching  grant  will  be  aligned 
under both interventions to 70% maximum.

Sub-Component 2.2: Market Facilitation in Small Livestock Value Chains 
Detailed description of activities and implementation modalities for sub-component .2: Market 
Facilitation in Small Livestock Value Chains 
210.  Market  facilitation  in  small  livestock  value  chains  will  be  done  at  three  levels:  (i) 
assistance  to  off-takers  for  supplier  network  development;  and  (ii)  support  to  public 
good related investments in essential equipment meant to improve food safety, animal 
welfare and climate-smart upgrading of their facilities, conditional upon their sourcing 
from project beneficiaries.  
211.  All activities related to market facilitation will be placed under the direct supervision of 
the  Agribusiness  Specialist  at  SPIU,  who  will  work  in  close  coordination  with  (i)  the 
Access  to  Finance  Specialist  to  ensure  active  linkage  with  financial  institutions  (see 
also  sub-component  2.3);  and  (ii)  the  SPIU  Livestock  Specialist  and  RAB  technicians 
for issues related to compliance to food and animal welfare standards. 
Activity 2.2.1: Business Development services 
212.  Market  appraisal  for  commercial  pig  and  poultry  value  chains.  An  assessment 
of  the  pig  and  poultry  (egg  and  meat)  markets  will  be  conducted  before  the  project 
start-up  by  Palladium,  under  a  DFID  funded  civil  society  strengthening  programme. 
The  outcome  will  be  available  before  the  end  of  2019  and  will  be  a  critical  decision-
making tool for PRISM, in particular for selecting the Districts of interventions, private 
sector  partners  and  sites  for  market  access  public  investments.  However,  since  this 
study will only cover pig and poultry value chains, there will be a need to undertake a 
similar exercise for small ruminants during the inception phase of PRISM. A provision 
has  been  made  under  the  ENABEL  financing  (ENABEL  activity  2.1.1.  Studies  on 
modernisation  of  the  pig  and  poultry  value  chain  to  cater  for  the  needs  for  further 
studies on market and investment opportunities), including for selecting the location of 
abattoirs and markets to be funded under the programme, during the project cycle. 
213.  Rapid  market  appraisal  for  the  small  ruminants  value  chains:  Very  little 
information is available on Rwanda Small Ruminants value chains, and the project will 
168 
Rwanda 
Partnership for Resilient and Inclusive Small Livestock Markets (PRISM) 
Project Implementation Manual (DRAFT) 
thus conduct a rapid market appraisal for this sub-sector. The key overall objectives of 
this study are: 
 
 
 
 
 
To analyse the markets both national and regional, with a specific focus on the DRC 
market; 
To assess the markets systems and characteristics of private and public actors; 
To define the current small ruminants chains, identify current bottlenecks as well as 
business opportunities available for smallholder farmers; 
To provide recommendations on how to facilitate/broker market-based interventions that 
focus on adding value to small ruminants products and connecting smallholder farmers 
with the market; 
The terms of reference for this study will be developed at the inception of the project by 
the SPIU Agribusiness Specialist in close collaboration with RAB and Heifer. A specialized 
consultant will be recruited to undertake this assignment in the first year of the project. 
214.  BDSP  support  to  the  development  of  supplier  network.  This  market  facilitation 
support  will  complement  the  proximity  extension  services,  coaching  and  business 
development  services  foreseen  (i)  under  the  component  1  (graduation  package  and 
support  to  young  entrepreneurs)  and  (ii)  under  sub-component  2.1  for  the  farmers 
engaged  in  pig  and  layers  productive  alliances.  Three  BDSPs  will  be  recruited  under 
this activity: 1 poultry BDSP, 1 pig BDSP, and 1 small ruminant BDSP (for both goats 
and sheep). Specific tasks will be to engage the producers with the other actors of the 
value  chains,  typically  the  traders  operating  at  farmgate  and  market  level,  the 
processors, the abattoirs/slaughter slabs, and the final off-takers (butchers, exporters, 
etc.). The role of these BDSPs will thus be the one of a match-maker, able to identify 
the demand and propose adequate products along win-win arrangements.  
215.  The  terms  of  reference  for  these  BDSPs  will  be  developed  at  the  inception  of  the 
project by the SPIU Agribusiness Specialist. Selection criteria for these BDSPs include 
inter alia market experience and intelligence; staff capabilities to use a comprehensive 
value  chain  approach  inclusive  of  smallholder  farmers,  women  and  youth;  and 
adequacy of the proposed work plan. For this activity he project has set aside a BDSP 
budget equivalent to 153 person/month at a monthly rate of USD 1,200, starting from 
year 1. Ninety percent of the cost will be borne by the project, but it is also expected 
that  the  private  sector  will  contribute  to  the  remaining  10%  part,  given  that  this 
support is meant to increase substantially their supplier outreach, which is for instance 
in the best interest  of  abattoir operators who  are currently running at less than 20% 
capacity in the small ruminant value chain.  
216.  The same three BDSPs will also be engaged in the development of business plans for 
the private sector (see below), and in the support to small livestock multi-stakeholder 
fora (see activity 2.2.4). 
217.  BDSPs  will  serve  beneficiaries  of  both  IFAD  and  ENABEL  supported  interventions  and 
will be financed on ENABEL budget (ENABEL activity 2.2.2. Technical advice, business 
development  and  financial  support  to  businesses  in  the  pig  and  poultry  value  chain 
and  activity  1.2.5  Provide  business  development  support  to  egg  collectors,  traders, 
meat processors, depending of nature of business supported by BDSP). 
218.  Business  Plan  (BP)  development  and  linkage  to  financial  institutions  to 
modernize/upgrade  private  processing  facilities.  PRISM  will  support  private 
operators of abattoirs and processing units to launch public good related investments 
169

Project Implementation Manual (DRAFT) 
in  essential  equipment  meant  to  improve  food  safety,  animal  welfare  and  climate-
smart upgrading of their facilities. The first step will be to help them develop a sound 
business  plan  that  will  back  their  eligibility  to  grants  (see  activity  2.2.2  below)  and 
enable  them  to  access  loans  from  Participating  Financial  Institutions  (PFIs)  if 
necessary. To meet this latter objective, the BDSPs will work in very close collaboration 
with the technical assistants foreseen in sub-component 2.3 (see activity 2.3.1).  
219.  The  three  Pig,  Poultry  and  SR  BDSPs  engaged  for  market  facilitation  under  activity 
2.1.2.  will  also  be  in  charge  of  developing  these  business  plans,  with  an  additional 
service fee of USD 1,000 per BP that will be paid 100% by the project. PRISM intends 
to develop 25 business plans under this activity. 
Activity 2.2.2: Financial support to modernize/upgrade private processing facilities  
220.  Once  their  business  plans  are  developed,  the  private  processors/slaughterers  will  be 
able  to  apply  for  PRISM  matching  grants,  that  are  meant  to  ease  the  investment 
efforts  mentioned  above.  This  support  must  be  viewed  as  an  incentive,  a  ‘stimulus 
package’ to upgrade processing facilities in a context where private companies would 
otherwise  prefer  to  secure  their  cashflow  and  not  allocate  their  limited  investment 
capital to ‘unproductive’ assets.  
221.  Eligible  investments  will  be  limited  to  (i)  essential  equipment  meant  to  improve  food 
safety  and  animal  welfare  (such  as  cold  rooms/cool  trucks,  ventilated  vans  to 
transport  live  chicken,  stainless  steel  machinery/furniture)  and  (ii)  climate-smart 
upgrading of their facilities (such as bio-digesters, solar energy). For the first group of 
investments,  the  project  will  provide  a  30%  matching  grant,  with  a  ceiling  of  USD 
30,000. For the second group (climate smart technologies), the project will provide a 
67% grant with a ceiling of USD 10,000. Both types of grants are conditional upon the 
sourcing of products from direct project beneficiaries, along the same principles as the 
4P models implemented in PASP project and summarized in the table below. 
222.  Both  the  development  of  business  plans  and  the  matching  grants  will  be  entirely  co-
financed  by  ENABEL  under  activity  2.1.2.  Feasibility  studies  and  development  of 
investment  profiles  and  business  plans  and  Activity  2.2.2  Technical  advice,  business 
development  and  financial  support  to  businesses  in  the  pig  and  poultry  value  chain. 
The  project  will  support  the  development  of  centres  of  excellence  in  pig  and  poultry 
value  chains.  These  will  be  large  scale  production  units  that  also  provide  training 
services, coaching and mentoring, business development services such as formulation 
of  business  plans  or  feasibility  studies,  in  parallel  to  the  provision  of  inputs  such  as 
DoC, pullets, piglets. Some embryos of such centers of excellence already exist in the 
country  and  the  concept  is  promising  and  deserves  to  be  scaled  up.  This  activity  will 
be  led  and  financed  by  ENABEL  under  activity  2.2.2  Technical  advice,  business 
development and financial support to businesses in the pig and poultry value chain.

Activity 2.2.3: Support to pig slaughter slabs and livestock markets 
223.  ESIA  for  public  pig  slaughter  slabs.  According  to  Rwanda  regulations,  any  new 
infrastructure, even slaughter slabs, should be subject to prior Environment and Social 
Impact  Study.  The  project  foresees  either  the  building  or  the  rehabilitation  of  5  such 
infrastructure  for  the  pig  value  chain  (see  below),  the  latter  (rehabilitation)  not 
necessarily  needing  an  ESIA.  However,  given  the  nature  of  the  investment,  and  the 
anticipated  support  in  climate-smart  adaptations,  the  project  will  systematically  fund 
ESIA  studies  for  all  5  pig  slaughter  slabs.  Consultant(s)  will  be  recruited  for  that 
purpose,  and  ESIAs  are  expected  to  be  delivered  between  year  1  and  year  3,  as  a 
preliminary phase to infrastructures activities described below. 
224.  Build/rehabilitate  public  pig  slaughter  slabs  and  support  climate-smart 
innovation.  This  activity  is  meant  to  respond  to  the  crucial  lack  of  pig  slaughtering 
facilities  in  Rwanda,  that  is  seen  as  a  major  impediment  to  the  development  of  the 
value  chain.  Even  when  they  exist,  pig  slaughter  slabs  in  Rwanda  remain  very 
rudimentary  and  rarely  comply  with  the  basic  hygiene  and  animal  welfare 
requirements.  Yet,  such  facilities  are  essential  to  enable  pig  producers  to  shift  from 
farmgate  sales  of  live  animals  to  value  addition  through  the  proceeds  of  pork  meat. 
PRISM  will  thus  build  or  rehabilitate  5  pig  slaughter  slabs  in  strategic  production 
basins;  the  facilities  will  be  owned  by  the  districts,  but  their  management  will  be 
entrusted to cooperatives or private sector operators (see below). 
225.  The  exact  locations  of  these  facilities  will  be  determined  )  based  on  the  outcomes  of 
the  market  assessment  and  investment  opportunities  studies  and  after  wide 
consultation  between  the  district  authorities,  the  SPIU,  the  pig  producers  and  the 
private  sector  actors.  A  call  for  tender  will  be  launched  for  civil  works,  taking  into 
account  the  results  of  the  ESIAs.  The  project  foresees  an  average  budget  of  USD 
164 Note: all investments supported by grants are not to be used as collateral for a duration 
of at least 5 years 
171

100,000  per  slab,  to  be  complemented  by  a  maximum  allocation  of  USD  25,000  to 
support  investments  in  bio-digesters  and  solar  energy  for  hot-water  supply.  These 
costs will 100% borne by the project. Should these facilities cost less than the budget 
allocation, more pig slaughter slabs will be rehabilitated.  
226.  Rehabilitate district livestock markets and support climate-smart innovation. 
As  highlighted  in  the  “Strategy  for  Rwanda  Meat  Exports  to  DRC”  (2016),  all  of  the 
district markets lack basic infrastructure for animal holding, and do not meet sanitary 
standards  that  are  supportive  of  the  meat  industry.  Out  of  the  64  district  markets 
existing in PRISM target regions, 10 will thus be selected for rehabilitation (ideally one 
per target district), based on the outcomes of the market assessment and investment 
opportunities studies. Like for pig slaughter slabs, the exact locations of these markets 
will  be  determined  after  wide  consultation  between  the  district  authorities,  the  SPIU, 
the small livestock producers and the private sector actors. The markets will be owned 
by  the  districts,  but  their  management  will  be  entrusted  to  cooperatives  or  private 
sector operators (see below). 
227.  A  call  for  tender  will  be  launched  for  civil  works.  The  project  foresees  an  average 
budget  of  USD  50,000  per  market,  to  be  complemented  by  a  maximum  allocation  of 
USD  10,000  to  support  investments  in  solar  pumps.  These  costs  will 100%  borne  by 
the project. Should these markets cost less than the budget allocation, more markets 
will be rehabilitated.  
228.  Public  investments  in  both  slaughter  slabs  and  markets  will  be  financed  entirely  by 
IFAD. 
229.  BDSP support to set up contractual arrangements for the operation of public 
pig  slaughter  slabs  and  livestock  markets.  This  support  will  ensure  that  the 
management  of  public  infrastructure  supported  by  the  project  is  undertaken  in  a 
professional  and  sustainable  manner  that  meets  the  interests  of  PRISM  primary 
beneficiaries. To this effect, a specialist Business Development Service Provided will be 
recruited in Y2, whose task will be spread along the last 4 years of the project as the 
15 facilities (5 pig slaughter slabs and 10 markets) are being built/rehabilitated.

Sub-Component 2.3: Support to Financial Institutions 
230.  The project will facilitate linkage of the smallholder farmers under productive alliance 
with  the  financial  sector,  to  finance  investments  and  working  capital.  It  will  also 
contribute  to  linking  vulnerable  households  under  the  graduation  pathway  under 
component  1  to  access  formal  financial  services  as  one  of  the  graduation  indicators, 
and  to  linking  youths  supported  under  component  1  to  financial  institutions  for  the 
financing of their start up business and further development of the business.

231.  It  is  expected  that  at  least  2  innovations  for  digitalization  of  financial  services  and  2 
insurance  products  (poultry  and  pig)  will  be  developed  and  rolled  out.  As  much  as 
possible, pilot testing and roll out of these innovations will involve financial institutions 
that the Project has contributed to link with its beneficiaries. 
232.  All activities related to productive alliances will be placed under the direct supervision 
of  the  Access  to  Finance  Specialist,  who  will  work  in  close  coordination  with  the 
Agribusiness  Specialist  and  Livestock  Specialist  at  SPIU  to  ensure  active  linkage  with 
producers  engaged  in  productive  alliances  (see  also  sub-component  2.1)  and  other 
small  livestock  producers  supported  by  the  project  under  component  1  (esp.  the 
young entrepreneurs). 
Detailed description of activities and implementation modalities for SC 2.3: Support to Financial 
Institutions 
Activity 2.3.1: Enhancing access to financial services in the small livestock sector 
233.  Update  mapping  of  the  financial  sector.  A  study  will  be  implemented  during  the 
inception phase to map the financial institutions (Banks, MFIs, SACCOs, Mobile money 
providers  and  Insurers)  providing  services  (current  and  prospective),  with 
specifications  of  the  services  provided,  for  each  administrative  sector  where  the 
project  will  intervene.  Interest  of  the  financial  institutions  for  the  development  of  a 
portfolio  for  small  livestock  value  chains  also  be  assessed,  specifically  for  each  value 
chain targeted (poultry, pig, goat and sheep). The study will be used by the Project to 
identify and contact potential partners for technical assistance and partnerships under 
the two approaches described below.  
234.  The  study  will  be  carried  out  by  a  local  consultant  recruited  on  competitive  basis, 
under  supervision of the  project AFS. Required profile should be a  senior expert with 
experience  in  the  Rwandan  financial  sector,  with  previous  experience  in  carrying  out 
similar study or research. 
235.  Technical  assistance  to  financial  institutions  under  the  productive  alliance 
models. For smallholder farmers supported under the productive alliance models, the 
project will support private feed manufacturers and off-takers having developed or in 
the  process  of  developing  productive  alliances  with  farmers  to  identify  and  negotiate 
with financial institutions (FI) for the financing of the farmers, and provide customized 
technical  assistance  to  these  institutions.  One  FI  will  be  selected  for  each  productive 
alliance.  
236.  Technical  assistance  will  be  provided  to  the  FI  in  close  consultation  with  the  private 
company,  for  the  development  of  adapted  and  affordable  financial  products  and 
secured  delivery  channels  building  on  the  business  model  of  the  company  and  the 
farmers and modalities of their linkages. TA will include training of relevant FI agents 
on poultry and/or pig farm enterprise on production, business model and cash flow, to 
enable  them  to  do  proper  appraisal  and  monitoring  of  the  loans.  A  quadripartite 
agreement  will  be  signed  between  the  private  company,  representatives  of  the 
farmers,  the  FI  and  the  project.  The  agreement  will  specify  features  of  the  financial 
services to the farmers, targets and loan disbursement plan, conditions for delivery of 
the  services  and  respective  responsibilities  of  the  parties  for  their  delivery.  It  will  in 
particular  include  specific  responsibilities  of  the  company  for  the  loan  repayments 
(check  off  procedures  when  feasible),  and  of  the  farmers  (especially  in  case  group 
174 
Rwanda 
Partnership for Resilient and Inclusive Small Livestock Markets (PRISM) 
Project Implementation Manual (DRAFT) 
joint  liability  for  loan  repayment  is  implemented).  Project  responsibilities  will  be 
specified regarding TA to the FI and support to be provided to the private company for 
the  development  or  strengthening  of  the  farmers  network  and  to  the  farmers  in 
enterprise skills and financial literacy. 
237.  The  project  will  issue  competitive  calls  for  proposal  to  shortlisted  banks  or  MFIs. 
SACCOs will not be targeted for this approach since they lack financial and managerial 
capacities  to  manage  this  kind  of  partnership,  knowing  also  that  their  geographical 
coverage  is  restricted  to  one  sector.  Priority  will  be  given  to  commercial  banks  and 
MFIs  that  have  set  up  an  agricultural  finance  unit,  and  have  expressed  interest  to 
develop  their  portfolio  for  poultry  or  pig  value  chains.  Banks  and  MFIs  should  in 
particular  specify  in  their  proposal  conditions  to  finance  investment  and  working 
capital  for  smallholder  farmers,  including  interest  rates  and  other  fees,  and  what 
technical assistance they would require from the project to design products and deliver 
the services in partnership with the company. 
238.  Selection  will  be  made  using  the  following  main  eligibility  and  evaluation  criteria:  (i) 
compliance  with  National  Bank  regulations,  (ii)  financial  performance  and  financial 
capacity to deliver the services, (iii) experience in agricultural lending, (iv) operational 
presence in the area  of operations  of the company and  farmers, (v)  relevance  of the 
financial  products  and  delivery  channels  proposed,  including  required  collaterals,  and 
interest and fees proposed, and scope of TA requested. Negotiations will be conducted 
between the selected FI, the company, farmers representatives when possible and the 
project before signing of the agreement.  
239.  ICCO  Terrafina  has  been  identified  as  potential  partner  for  implementation  of  this 
activity. In case partnership does not materialized, a service provider will be recruited 
on  competitive  basis.  Priority  will  be  given  to  locally  based  service  providers,  but 
international  tender  may  be  issued  if  local  tender  is  not  conclusive.  ToRs  (see  in 
annex) will include the main following activities: (i) conduct value chain mapping and 
studies for poultry and pig with focus on financing needs and gaps, lending risks and 
risk  mitigation  strategies,  (ii)  support  private  companies  under  productive  alliance  to 
identify,  recruit  and  negotiate  with  a  partner  FIs,  (iii)  provide  TA  to  the  FI  to  design 
adapted products and delivery channels for the farmers, (iv) provide training to the FI 
agents  on  understanding  of  the  poultry  or  pig  farmer  enterprise  (on  production  and 
business  model),  with  recourse  to  specialized  service  providers  if  needed,  and  (v) 
support and monitor delivery of the financial services to the farmers. 
240.  Technical  assistance  to  financial 
institutions  for 
linkage  with  Project 
beneficiaries  (out  of  productive  alliance).  For  linkages  with  other  beneficiaries, 
the  project  will  organize  training  for  interested  financial  institutions  aiming  at  raising 
their appetite for small livestock value chains and supporting them to design or refine 
affordable  products  and  delivery  channels  for  different  categories  of  beneficiaries. 
Training  will  be  organized  for  managers  and  loan  agents  of  banks,  MFIs  and  SACCOs 
operating  in  areas  of  intervention  of  the  project.  It  will  include  presentation  of  value 
chains  mapping  and  analysis  with  focus  on  financial  needs,  risks  and  risks  mitigating 
strategies,  and  recommended  product  features  and  delivery  channels  for  different 
categories  of  beneficiaries.  It  will  also  include  a  training  on  farm  enterprise  on 
production, business model and cash flow, to enable FI agents to do proper appraisal 
and monitoring of the loans.  
175 
Rwanda 
Partnership for Resilient and Inclusive Small Livestock Markets (PRISM) 
Project Implementation Manual (DRAFT) 
241.  Training sessions will be organized at district level to ensure participation of the sector 
based  SACCOs.  The  project  will  invite  shortlisted  FI  based  on  the  mapping  study 
carried out during the inception phase (noting that regular updates should be made by 
the  project  to  include  possible  new  entrants  in  the  agricultural  sector).  Each  session 
will  last  3  days,  with  a  maximum  number  of  participants  of  30  (between  2  and  3 
participants  per  FI,  including  a  manager  and  a  loan  agent).  Each  participating  FI  will 
be  requested  to  specify  after  the  training  session  its  plan  to  develop  small  livestock 
portfolio, including for the project beneficiaries. 
242.  Training of FI will be implemented by the partner (see above TA), or a service provider 
recruited under the productive alliance model, to ensure synergies and cross learning 
between the two activities. 
243.  Organization  of  fora  to  link  beneficiaries,  value  chain  actors  and  financial 
institutions.  The  project  will  then  organize  fora  to  facilitate  linkages  between 
farmers,  value  chain  actors  and  FI  that  have  confirmed  interest  to  increase  their 
engagement  in  the  sector,  and  have  designed  adapted  products  following  training  by 
the project which are ready for promotion. Insurers that have been supported by the 
project to design small livestock insurance products will also be invited once products 
are ready for roll out. The project will specifically invite supported beneficiaries under 
component 1 and private actors supported or partnering under component 2. However, 
the fora will be opened to the public to allow for indirect impact, and the event will be 
promoted in collaboration with the relevant district authorities. Value chain actors like 
input suppliers and off-takers will also be invited. It will be an opportunity for them to 
interact  with  farmers  as  potential  clients  or  suppliers,  and  to  interact  with  financial 
institutions  for  possible  access  to  finance  (assumptions  being  that  FIs  trained  by  the 
project  will  also  be  incentivized  to  finance  other  actors  than  farmers  in  the  small 
livestock  value  chains).  2  fora  per  district  will  be  organized  (total  of  30  for  15 
districts).  
244.  Fora  will be  organized  by  the  project  under  responsibility  of  the  AFS,  in  collaboration 
with the district authorities. 
Activity 2.3.2: Support to financial innovations and small livestock insurance 
245.  TA  to  insurers,  development  and  delivery  of  'small  livestock  insurance 
product  development/operation'  course.  With  regards  to  insurance  for  small 
livestock,  insurance  products  available  are  not  suitable  or  available  for  the  project 
target  groups.  To  support  better  access  to  other  financial  services  for  the  project 
target  group(s)  engaged  in  poultry  and/or  pig  farming,  research  will  be  carried  out 
into  these  value  chain  risks  and  insurance  feasibility  for  the  target  groups.  This  will 
help underpin technical assistance to two new product designs – carried out on a cost-
share basis, and also inform training of members of the Rwanda Insurers’ Association. 
As a result of these activities, at least 5 insurers will receive support from the project - 
one or two will be selected for intensive product design support, and more will benefit 
from sector training. 
246.  For  support  to  development  of  small  livestock  insurance  innovations,  there  are  three 
main  sub-activities:  (i)  two  market  and  feasibility  studies,  one  for  poultry,  one  for 
pigs;  (ii)  TA  to  two  product  designs  based  on  market  /feasibility  studies  –  one  for 
176 
Rwanda 
Partnership for Resilient and Inclusive Small Livestock Markets (PRISM) 
Project Implementation Manual (DRAFT) 
poultry,  one  for  pigs  (providing  feasibility  is  positive),  and  (iii)  development  and 
delivery of small livestock insurance training for members of ASSAR.  
247.  To  ensure  reliable  conclusions  on  the  feasibility,  the  tasks  will  be  split  into  two 
separate contracts. One service provider/consultancy firm will be selected to carry out 
the feasibility studies. If the outcomes are positive, a second selection process will be 
launched  for  a  separate  service  provider  to  provide  TA  to  two  product  designs  based 
on  market  /feasibility,  and  development  and  delivery  of  small  livestock  insurance 
training for members of ASSAR. Two draft ToR to support selection of these specialist 
service providers are provided in Annex. An additional selection process will take place 
to  determine  which  one  or  two  insurers  receive  TA  to  develop  a  poultry  and  a  pig 
product. It could be one insurer receiving support for poultry and another one for pig, 
or  only  one  receiving  support  to  design  and  adjust  both  products.  Insurer(s)  will  be 
selected  based  on  (i)  proposal  for  scale  up  and  commercial  viability,  (ii)  potential  for 
impact  on  smallholder  farmers  in  small  livestock  value  chains,  (iii)  compliance  with 
social and environmental standards, and responsible finance principles, (iv) capacity of 
the organization to develop the product, (v) commitment of the organization to cover 
at least 30% of the development costs. The insurer(s) selected will be eligible for TA to 
both  product  development,  and  following  the  first  year  of  roll-out,  product 
review/adjustments. 
248.  Like for innovations for digital financial services, decision on partnership will be made 
by  a  screening  committee  comprising  Project  management,  recognized  experts  with 
thorough  knowledge  of  the  Rwandan  financial  sectors  (for  instance  from  Access  to 
Finance Rwanda), representative of the National Bank of Rwanda to ensure compliance 
of the innovation with national regulations, and representatives of the insurance sector 
like ASSAR. Monitoring of development of the innovations will be done by the specialist 
service  provider  under  overall  supervision  of  the  AFS  through  desk  review  of  reports 
and  regular  meetings  with  the  supported  organizations,  and  on  site  visits  to  assess 
implementation  and  impact  of  the  solutions  developed.  Senior  experts  may  be 
mobilized  by  the  project  to  conduct  thorough  assessment  of  the  development  of  the 
innovation.  
249.  Training  of  Rwanda  Insurers'  Association  technical  members.  To  support  the 
rest  of  the  sector,  in  project  year  three,  a  five-day  training  course  will  be  developed 
and  delivered  by  the  same  specialist  service  provider  who  is  selected  to  support 
product development. The training will be focused on small livestock insurance product 
and  scheme  development  for  smallholder  value  chains  in  the  project.  It  will  highlight 
international  experiences  with  small  livestock  insurance,  as  well  as  the  Rwandan 
context of small livestock value chains and existing products/schemes (both for large 
and  small-scale  farmers),  embodied  by  learning  from  the  feasibility  studies  and 
product  development  activities.  This  course  will  be  delivered  in  two  sittings  over  a 
period of two-working weeks. It will be targeted at ASSAR members, especially those 
involved  or  with  an  interest  in  agricultural  insurance.  The  target  group  is  one  or  two 
agricultural insurance focal points from each of these insurers. 
250.  This  activity  will  be  implemented  jointly  with,  and  co-financed  by  ENABEL  (activity 
2.3.2.  Support  to  financial  innovations  and  small  livestock  insurance,  and  activity 
2.4.3.  Set  up  a  Innovation  fund  to  implement  innovative  ideas  (IT  solutions, 
insurance, financing, etc.)

254.  All  activities  related  to  support  to  national  farmers  organizations,  stakeholder  for  a, 
formulation  of  policies  and  strategies,  development,  review  and  enforcement  of 
legislation  and  standards  will  be  supported  and  funded  jointly  with  ENABEL  (Activity 
and 
2.3.1. Develop laws, strategies, policies, guidelines and 2.3.3 
harmonize  international  export  standards/certification  for  pork  and  poultry).  The 
support  provided  to  the  government  by  PRISM  will  build  on  the  outcomes  of  an 
assessment  being  undertaken  (by  Palladium,  under  a  DFID  funding),  which  aims  at 
identifying  the  policy  and  regulatory  gaps  in  the  pig  and  poultry  value  chain,  and 
whose report will be available at the beginning of the programme. 
Develop 
Sub component 3.1: Policy and regulatory support 
Detailed description of activities and implementation modalities for S.C. 3.1. policy and 
regulatory support 
255.  Under  this  sub-component,  the  programme  will  provide  institutional  support  to 
existing or emerging national farmers organizations of the small livestock value chain, 
in order to enable them to play a more proactive role in the policy dialogue process.  
256.  The programme will also establish stakeholder for a at both regional and national level 
to  facilitate  the  business  relations  between  the  various  stakeholders  and  bring  their 
specific  issues/proposals  at  an  upper  level  to  have  weight  in  the  livestock  regulatory 
framework discussions 
257.  The  programme  will  support  institutional  reforms  in  order  to  create  an  enabling 
environment  for  the  development  of  the  targeted  value  chains.  National  policies  and 
strategies pertaining to the sector will be reviewed and updated when necessary, and 
the regulatory environment, particularly for aspects related to food safety and animal 
welfare,  will  be  strengthened.  Finally,  targeted  capacity  building  will  be  provided  to 
national  institutions  in  charge  of  the  sector  to  enhance  their  technical  capacities 
related to the small livestock value chains. 
258.  In  the  process  of  policy  formulation,  the  programme  will  pay  particular  attention  to 
strengthen  the  role  of  the  private  sector/VC  stakeholder  and  their  contribution  to 
policy  dialogue,  through  their  national  organizations  and  through  the  value  chain 
platforms. 
259.  This  sub-component  will  be  implementing  jointly  and  co-financed  by  both  ENABEL 
(under activity 2.4.1  Strengthen  the  capability  of  existing  industry  and  sector 
representative  bodies  to  advocate  for  improvements  within  the  value  chains)  and 
IFAD. 
Activity 3.1.1. Support national producers organizations 
260.   Build  capacities  of  umbrella  organizations  executives:  Three  farmers  umbrella 
organizations could benefit from this support: the Rwanda Poultry Industry association 
(RPIA),  the  Rwanda  Pig  Farmers  Association  (RPFA),  the  Rwanda  Animal  Feed 
Association  (RAFA)165  ,  and  a  potential  emerging  umbrella  organization  for  the  small 
ruminants  value  chain  (covering  both  goats  and  sheep).  The  executives  and  board 
165 Will be supported by ENABEL only since IFAD does not support directly the feed industry and has entirely 
delegated this aspect 
179 
Rwanda 
Partnership for Resilient and Inclusive Small Livestock Markets (PRISM) 
Project Implementation Manual (DRAFT) 
members of these  organizations will be trained on matters  related to  the governance 
and the management of their organizations, in order to ensure inclusivity, participation 
of smaller farmers, women and youth in the governance, and avoid elite capture. They 
will  also  be  trained  in  financial  management,  with  special  emphasis  on  possible 
approaches  to  improve  the  sustainability  of  these  organizations  and  reduce  their 
dependency  on  external  partners.  Finally,  the  members  will  be  trained  on  advocacy 
and lobbying techniques, to enhance the weight of producers in negotiation processes 
and policy dialogue. 
261.  In  addition  to  formal  trainings,  the  project  will  support  the  organization  of  exchange 
visits and study tours, in priority within the East and Central African Region, to enable 
these organizations to learn from sister organizations in other countries. The trainings 
undertaken  under  this  activity  will  be  contracted  to  a  local  NGO  specialized  in 
governance and support to civil society organizations. This NGO will be recruited at the 
beginning of the project and contracted for  one year,  renewable  every year based on 
performance. 
262.  The  same  service  provider  will  also  be  in  charge  of  preparing,  organizing, 
accompanying and debriefing the exchange visits. 
263.  Support  operations  of  farmers  umbrella  organizations:  The  programme  will 
provide support to the  day to day  running of these umbrella organizations, to enable 
them to increase their visibility, their outreach and finally their credibility. This support 
will be strategically focused on activities that could lead to self-generation of incomes 
and improve the sustainability of the organization. The support will be decreasing over 
the  years  to  encourage  the  organizations  to  mobilize  alternative  and  more  stable 
resources. 
264.  The  contribution  to  the  operations  of  the  umbrella  organizations  will be  channeled  to 
the organization in the scope of a Memorandum of Understanding established between 
the  programme  and  the  organization  during  the  first  year  of  implementation.  The 
organization will manage its funds independently and will report to the project as per 
the financial rules in force.  
Activities 3.1.2.: Support to Small Livestock Multi-stakeholder Fora 
265.  Once  the  actors  are  mobilized  around  programme  intervention,  small  livestock 
multi-stakeholder fora will be set up at both regional and national level to facilitate 
the  business  relations  between  the  various  stakeholders  and  bring  their  specific 
issues/proposals  at  an  upper  level  to  have  weight  in  the  livestock  regulatory 
framework  discussions.  From  Y3  of  the  programme,  it  is  thus  expected  that  forum 
members  with  different  backgrounds  and  interests  (farmers,  traders,  processors, 
researchers,  government  officials,  development  partners,  etc.)  will  come  together  to 
diagnose problems, identify opportunities and find ways to achieve their goals.  
266.  The programme will facilitate this gathering, first at regional level, and then at national 
level. The  cost of these fora will be 100% borne by the project in the first two  years 
for regional fora and in the first year for the national  forum (due to be established in 
Y4).  During  this  period,  the  fora  will  be  led  by  the  SPIU  Agribusiness  Specialist, 
supported by the BDSPs hired under activity 2.2.1. Their task will also be to facilitate 
the  establishment  of  a  mechanism  for  self-sufficiency  through  members  fees,  district 
180 
Rwanda 
Partnership for Resilient and Inclusive Small Livestock Markets (PRISM) 
Project Implementation Manual (DRAFT) 
contribution, etc.  In the last year the project will reduce its support by half, and it is 
then  expected  that  the  fora  will  be  sustainable,  i.e.  that  the  comparative  advantage 
that they offer will sufficiently attract the interest of the members that they will accept 
to contribute to its ‘maintenance’.  
267.  This activity will be implemented and financed jointly by IFAD and ENABEL. 
Activity 3.1.3: Support to development of sector strategies and policies 
268.  Under  this  activity,  the  programme  will  support  the  formulation  of  relevant  sector 
strategies and policies, for instance the small livestock strategy which is outdated and 
needs  updating.  All  policies  and  strategies  will  be  aligned  to  the  overall  strategic 
framework pertaining to the agricultural sector (PSTA4) and livestock sector (LMP). To 
ensure that policies and strategies are developed in an evidenced based and inclusive 
manner, the programme will provide support to MINAGRI in the following domains: 
 
 
 
Provision of specialized expertise (consultancies); 
Collation of data and evidences (baseline and diagnostic studies when 
necessary); 
Support to inclusive stakeholder consultation processes: organization of 
stakeholder consultation workshops for needs assessment or validation of draft 
documents; the stakeholder fora established in the scope of component 2 will 
offer an excellent opportunity and platform for these consultations. 
Activity 3.1.4: Support to development and enforcement of food safety and animal welfare 
regulatory framework 
269.  Under  this  activity,  the  programme  will  support  the  updating  or  formulation  and 
enforcement  of  food  safety  and  animal  welfare  regulatory  frameworks  pertaining  to 
the targeted value chains. The support provided will aim at: 
 
 
 
Ensuring compliance of national regulations with international standards (Codex 
Alimentarius for food safety standards, OIE for animal health and animal welfare 
standards) and facilitate international trade 
Improve human public health (reduce transmission of food borne diseases and 
zoonoses) and veterinary public health 
Improve animal welfare and reduce animal suffering during critical stages of 
transport and slaughtering 
270.  The  choice  of  regulations  updated  or  formulated  will  be  done  in  consultation  with 
MINAGRI and other development partners such as ENABEL. The process will be similar 
to the one followed for policies and will include the following stages:  
 
 
 
Provision of specialized expertise: the project will recruit specialized consultant 
but may also recourse to the expertise of FAO and OIE experts, in order to 
ensure the alignment of regulations developed with international standards and 
guidelines; 
Support to inclusive stakeholder consultation processes: organization of 
stakeholder consultation workshops for needs assessment or validation of draft 
documents (using the stakeholder fora established under component 2); 
Awareness raising to facilitate adoption of new regulations by value chain actors: 
publication of guidelines, leaflets, posters, and organization of public meetings 
181 
Rwanda 
Partnership for Resilient and Inclusive Small Livestock Markets (PRISM) 
Project Implementation Manual (DRAFT) 
where the purpose and the content of the regulations will be explained; done by 
ENABEL 
271.  The main beneficiary of these activities 3.1.1.  and 3.1.2. will be MINAGRI who is the 
institution  mandated  for  formulation  of  policies,  strategies  and  regulations.  The 
expertise  will  be  provided  either  by  private  consultants  recruited  on  a  competitive 
basis, or by FAO and OIE experts, recruited in the scope of MoUs. FAO and OIE experts 
will  be  preferred  for  regulations  where  alignment  with  international  standards  is 
critical.  The  consultation  workshops  will  be  organized  by  MINAGRI  and  expenditures 
related  to  the  organization  of  workshops  (DSA  of  participants,  meeting  room  rental) 
will be covered directly by the programme. 
272.  In addition to the above-mentioned activities, several complementary activities aiming 
at  reinforcing  the  regulatory  environment  will  be  implemented  under  the  ENABEL 
supported interventions: (i) support will be provided to RALIS to improve the delivery 
of meat and eggs certification and inspection services (ENABEL activity 2.3.6. Support 
the  implement  the  meat  certification/inspection  services),  (ii)  RAB  will  be  assisted  to 
develop  and  animal  identification  and  traceability  system  for  pigs  (ENABEL  activity 
2.3.5. Design and implement an animal identification in pig/pork value chain). 
Activity 3.1.5: Build institutional capacities at national and District levels 
273.  As mentioned in the problem analysis, MINAGRI faces a problem of deficit of technical 
staff  specialized  in  small  livestock  production.  The  project  will  thus  provide  capacity 
building  support  to  RAB  to  improve  skills  of  selected  key  national  staff  on  technical 
domains  related  to  the  development  of  small  livestock  value  chains:  animal  health, 
animal  feeding,  genetics,  housing  and  livestock  infrastructures,  waste  management. 
Six  staff  will  be  selected  and  will  undergo  short  trainings  (less  than  2  months)  in 
foreign countries. 
274.  The  trained  staff  will  then  be  encouraged  to  play  the  role  of  trainers  and  train  other 
civil  servants  or  private  actors  at  local level.  Local  training  will  be  organized  in  the  3 
targeted provinces, to disseminate the skills acquired in the scope of the international 
trainings. 12 training sessions for an average of 15 participants will be organized over 
the project duration.  
275.  Training institutions that will provide the  short  courses  for RAB staff will be identified 
jointly  by  RAB  and  SPIU  according  to  the  training  needs.  The  project  will  establish 
contract or MoUs directly with the training institutions and will cover directly the other 
costs of the training (plane ticket and DSA). 
276.  For secondary trainings organized at Province level, the local coordination units will be 
in  charge  of  the  practical  organization  in  partnership  with  the  District  housing  the 
training,  and  expenditures  will  be  covered  directly  by  the  project  through  the  local 
coordinators. 
277.  ENABEL  will  led  the  implementation  of  two  complementary  activities  contributing  to 
further  support  national  institutional  capacities  i.e.  the  establishment  of  a  livestock 
research  fund  in  RAB  (ENABEL  Activity  2.3.11.  Set  up  a  livestock  research  fund  in 
RAB),  that  will  address  value  chain  knowledge  gaps  that  may  arise  in  the  course  of 
182

278.  Rwanda’s long-term development goals are defined in the Vision 2020 and Vision 2050 
documents  that  aim  to  transform  the  country  from  a  low-income  agriculture-based 
economy  into  a  knowledge-based,  service-oriented  economy  with  middle-income 
status.  The  National  Strategy  for  Transformation  (NST  1)  follows  the  Economic 
Development  and  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  2  (EPRDS  2).  NST  1  integrates 
international  commitments  deriving  from  the  UN  Sustainable  Development  Goals 
(SDGs); African Union (AU) Agenda 2063; East African Community (EAC) Vision 2050 
focusing on job creation; and COP agreements on climate change. 
279.  The  Strategic  Plan  for  Agriculture  Transformation  2018-2024  (PSTA  4)  guides  the 
strategic  thrusts  and  priority  investments  to  transform  the  sector.  PSTA  4  is  the 
implementation  plan  of  the  National  Agricultural  Policy  (2017-2030)  and  Sector 
Strategic  Plan  (SSP)  for  Agriculture.  PSTA  4  recognises  the  private  sector,  including 
farmers  and  their  cooperatives,  as  a  driver  for  transformation,  with  MINAGRI  and 
public sector providing an enabling environment. 
280.  At the continental and regional level, the PSTA 4 constitutes Rwanda’s commitment to 
the  African  Union’s  Comprehensive  African  Agriculture  Development  Programme 
(CAADP).  Under  this  framework,  the  Malabo  Declaration  2014166  sets  specific  targets 
on  the  agriculture  sector’s  contribution  to  economic  growth,  economic  opportunities, 
nutrition and food security, and resilience. Rwanda is the top performer in the level of 
progress vis-à-vis these targets.167

281.  The  support  to  improve  animal  health  status  and  genetic  potential  of  small  livestock 
foreseen  in  component  1  and  the  establishment  of  proximity  extension  services 
(Community  Facilitators,  Community  Agro-Vet  Entrepreneurs,  private  coaches) 
respond well to the first two Priority Areas (PAs): 
 
 
PA  1:  Innovation  and  extension  provide  the  knowledge  base  for  PAs  2-3.  The 
focus  is  on  improving  agronomic  knowledge  and  technology  in  terms  of  basic 
research and innovation, development of efficient extension services,  as well as 
promoting knowledge and skills of value chain actors.  
PA  2:  Productivity  and  resilience  focus  on  promoting  sustainable  and  resilient 
production systems for crops and animal resources. 
282.  The backward and forward linkages facilitated under component 2 through productive 
alliances with input suppliers, enhanced marketing and processing infrastructure, and 
support to small livestock value chain financing are well aligned with the third PA: 
 
PA  3:  Inclusive  markets  and  value  addition  seek  to  improve  markets  and 
linkages  between  production  and  processing.  This  includes  key  input  markets 
such  as  fertilisers,  insurance  and  finance  as  well  as  upstream  activities  such  as 
aggregation,  promotion  of  value  addition,  market  infrastructure  and  export 
readiness.  
283.  Under  Component  3  the  support  to  develop  sector  strategies,  esp.  food  safety 
regulations,  and  the  capacity  building  of  RAB  and  local  government  authorities  align 
with the fourth PA: 
 
PA  4:  Enabling  environment  and  responsive  institutions  provide  the  regulatory 
framework and define and coordinate public sector involvement. 
284.   The overarching strategic framework guiding the development of the livestock sector 
in  Rwanda  is  the  Livestock  Master  Plan  (LMP).  The  LMP  was  developed  in  2017, 
following  the  implementation  of  a  Livestock  Sector  Analysis  (LSA)  2017.  The  LMP 
covers a five-year period (2017-2022) and comprises of six sub-sectorial master plans 
for  dairy,  red  meat,  chicken  and  pork.  For  small  livestock  specifically,  a  strategy  and 
investment plan for small animal industry was developed in 2012 but has now expired 
and would require a review and update. 
285.  The  priority  investment  envisaged  in  the  LMP,  relevant  to  the  small  livestock  value 
chains, and the project contribution to each of these priorities, are as follows:  
 
 
improved  productivity, 
Targeting  animal  health  interventions  for  young  and  adult  stock  mortality 
thereby 
(vaccinations,  parasite  control)  ensuring 
increasing  animal  and  product  off  take  of  meat  and  dairy :  the  project  will 
contribute  to  this  through  the  support  to  private  veterinary  practitioners 
networks  (CAVE)  and  through  support  to  public  veterinary  services  for 
surveillance and control of TADs. 
Improving  the  quality  and  quantity  of  livestock  feed  resources  through 
introducing  improved  forage  crops  and  improved  animal  feed  management 
practices,  feed  production  on  irrigated  land,  as  well  as  increased  access  to 
existing lands appropriate for grazing; the Project will contribute to this through 
capacity building of producers, support to feed manufacturers and facilitation of

business partnerships between producers and feed millers; For small ruminants, 
the project will promote the utilization of forage trees and other fodder varieties. 
Contributing  to  “Improving  collection,  marketing  and  processing”  by  enhancing 
the  marketing  and  processing  facilities  for  meat  and  eggs,  including  the  cold 
chain.  
286.  The  National  Strategy  on  Climate  Change  and  Low-Carbon  Development  (NCCLCD) 
underlines the need to manage the climate variability for the social, environmental and 
economic  development  of  the  country.  The  Intended  Nationally  Determined 
Contributions  (INDCs)  are  built  upon  the  NCCLCD  and  aim  at  achieving  Category  2 
energy  security  and  supports  the  development  of  green  industry  and  services, 
sustainable  land  and  water  management,  urban  development,  biodiversity  and 
ecosystem services.  
287.  The  National  Food  and  Nutrition  Policy  (NF&NP)  reaffirms  the  strong  commitment  to 
solving  food  and  malnutrition  and  preventing  stunting  in  children  under  two  years. 
Furthermore,  the  Rwanda  Youth  Strategic  Plan,  the  National  Gender  Policy,  and  in 
particular  the  Agriculture  Gender  Strategy  aim  to  address  the  challenges  faced  by 
women and youth through a comprehensive joint approach. 
288.  Other  government  policies  and  strategies  related  to  the  project  include  the  National 
Policy  on  Promotion  of  Cooperatives  (under  revision),  Post-Harvest  Sector  Strategy, 
and National ICT4Ag Strategy.  
Alignment to IFAD strategic objectives  
289.  Contribution  to  COSOP  SOs.  The  programme  will  directly  contribute  to  the  two 
COSOP SOs: to SO1 “sustainably increase agricultural productivity in priority food and 
export  value  chains  and  improve  livelihoods  and  resilience  of  the  rural  population” 
through  activities  aiming  at  intensifying  small  livestock  production  and  strengthening 
their resilience against sanitary, climatic or economic shocks. It will also contribute to 
SO2  “improve  post-harvest  processes,  strengthen  market  linkages  and  generate 
economic opportunities for men, women and youth in rural areas” through promotion 
of partnership mechanisms improving the inclusion of smallholders in the value chains. 
290.  Contribution to IFAD’s SOs. The programme is also fully aligned to the three IFAD’s 
SOs:  (i)  it  will  contribute  to  SO1(increased  production)  through  intensification  of 
production systems, productivity gains and expansion of production assets, (ii) to SO2 
(  increased  market  participation)  through  promotion  of  partnerships  between 
smallholders and private sector actors to improve access to market and services; and 
(iii) to SO3 (greater resilience) by improving resilience of animals to sanitary crisis on 
the  one  hand,  and  reinforcing  the  traditional  role  of  small  livestock  as  a  buffer 
mechanism in case of shock. 
291.  The  programme  reflects  IFAD’s  mainstreaming  agenda  covering  gender,  nutrition, 
youth,  and  climate  change  resilience.  In  particular,  the  project  is  aligned  with  IFAD 
Targeting Policy, adopting an inclusive and differentiated approach to  ensure that the 
most  vulnerable  segments  of  the  population  will  be  able  to  benefit  from  project's 
initiatives; with IFAD Policy on Gender equality and Women's empowerment, aimed at 
promoting equitable participation and share of benefits for women and men involved in 
small  livestock  value  chains;  with  the  IFAD  Youth  Action  Plan,  supporting  youth 
employment  and  entrepreneurship;  with  the  Nutrition  Action  Plan,  contributing  to 
186 
Rwanda 
Partnership for Resilient and Inclusive Small Livestock Markets (PRISM) 
Project Implementation Manual (DRAFT) 
improved nutrition of targeted households. Finally, the  programme is aligned with the 
IFAD ENRM policy, particularly with principle 3 – promote climate-smart approaches to 
rural development. 
Programme implementation 
292.  The  partnership  programme  will  be  implemented  through  the  Single  Project 
Implementation  Unit  (SPIU)  under  MINAGRI’s  main  implementing  agency  for 
agriculture  and livestock  programmes:  the  Rwanda  Agriculture  and  Animal  Resources 
Development  Board.  This  arrangement  is  considered  relevant  as  it  places  the  SPIU 
strategically  to  manage  ongoing  and  future  projects  under  MINAGRI’s  implementing 
agencies. The advantages of the SPIU model also include i) improved coordination and 
synergies among ongoing projects/programmes; ii) improved staff retention leading to 
reduction  in  staff  turnover  and  increase  in  institutional  memory;  iii)  and  increased 
knowledge and expertise as well as best practices in project/programme management. 
293.  The overall fiduciary aspects, procurement and M&E functions will continue to be under 
the  core  team  of  the  SPIU  as  they  have  been  key  element  contributing  to  the  good 
performance of the IFAD portfolio in Rwanda. 
Project oversight and strategic guidance 
294.  Role  of  MINAGRI  and  RAB:  MINAGRI  will  provide  overall  guidance  for  programme 
implementation  in  order  to  ensure  its  alignment  to  PSTA  IV.  In  line  with  the  practice 
for  other  IFAD-funded  projects  in  Rwanda,  MINAGRI  will  put  in  place  a  Programme 
Steering Committee chaired by the PS of MINAGRI. In addition, MINAGRI will lead all 
activities related to the formulation of policies, strategies and regulations. 
295.  RAB  will  be  responsible  for  the  project  implementation.  It  will  supervise  the  overall 
planning  of  programme  activities  and  guide  project  implementation.  In  addition,  RAB 
will  be  responsible  for  signing  MoUs  with  implementing  partners  as  well  as  contracts 
with service providers. Lastly, RAB will implement directly activities under its mandate 
in the areas of animal health, genetics, research, and capacity building of District staff. 
296.  Programme  Steering  Committee:  In-line  with  the  practice  for  other  IFAD  and 
ENABEL funded projects in Rwanda, a common Programme Steering Committee (PSC) 
will  be  established.  The  PSC  will  be  common  to  the  two  interventions  and  will  play  a 
both  an  oversight  and  coordination  role,  which  is  particularly  critical  because  of  the 
specific  setup  of  the  programme.  The  main  responsibilities  of  the  PSC  will  be  to 
provide  policy  guidance  and  orientations  at  national 
the 
implementation progress of the project, to approve AWPB and progress reports and to 
decide on corrective measures where appropriate. Membership of the PSC will include: 
PS  MINAGRI  (Chair),  DG  RAB  (Vice  Chair),  DG  Animal  Resources  and  DG  Strategic 
planning  (MINAGRI),  MINECOFIN,  MINICOM,  MINALOC,  SPIU  Coordinator,  PRISM 
project  coordinators  (Secretaries),  Representatives  of  RCA,  RSB,  RALIS,  BDF,  NIRDA, 
RAFA,  RPA,  RPFA,  VSFB,  Heifer  International,  Private  Sector  Foundation  (PSF)  and 
National Cooperative Confederation of Rwanda (NCCR). The PSC will meet at least four 
times  a  year.  Detailed  Terms  of  Reference  (ToRs)  and  membership  of  the  PSC  are 
included in the PIM. 
to  assess 
level, 
297.  The  programme  will  also  have  a  technical  coordination  committee  (PTCC),  which  will 
address  technical  and  implementation  issues,  including  those  related  to  the 
coordination between partners and alignment between the two projects. The PTCC will 
187 
Rwanda 
Partnership for Resilient and Inclusive Small Livestock Markets (PRISM) 
Project Implementation Manual (DRAFT) 
also  prepare  the  ground  for  the  steering  committee  by  identifying  issues  and 
bottlenecks,  as  well  as  success  stories,  that  need  to  be  addressed  at  a  higher 
institutional level. The membership of the technical coordination committee will include 
all  implementation  partners.  It  will  be  chaired  by  RAB.  The  PTTC  will  meet  on  a 
quarterly basis, one month ahead of the PSC meetings.  
298.  The  PSC  shall  meet  at  least  four  times  a  year  in  June  to  examine  the  AWPB  and  to 
assess  the  progress  made  against  targets,  and  respectively  in  October,  January  and 
April  to  examine  and  approve  the  different  progress  reports.  The  Minister  of 
Agriculture and Animal Resources has the sole responsibility of appointing members of 
PSC. 
299.  The programme will also participate in the technical coordination committees set in the 
scope  of  RDDP  (Animal  nutrition  and  genetics  committee,  Scientific  Committee  for 
Research, animal health technical committee), since matters discussed in the scope of 
these  committees  pertain  to  both  projects  and  all  livestock  value  chains.  The 
participation of both projects in those committees will also ensure better coordination 
and  sharing  of  lessons  and  knowledge.  RDDP  will  cover  the  costs  related  to  these 
meetings until its closure planned for 2022. 
300.  Role of IFAD. IFAD will carry out supervision missions jointly with MINAGRI ENABEL 
and  and  implementing  agencies  (Heifer,  VSFB).  One  or  two  implementation  support 
and supervision missions will be conducted by IFAD every year to review effectiveness 
of  the  programme  approach  in  targeted  districts;  planning,  gender  and  targeting, 
procurement  and  financial  management,  partnerships,  and  monitor  the  achievement 
of outputs, outcomes and impact. 
301.  IFAD  country  office  will  play  a  key  role  in  supervising  the  project  by  continually 
assessing  bottlenecks  and  risks  in  order  to  ensure  successful  implementation  and 
sustainability;  monitoring  changes  in  implementation  circumstances  that  require 
adjustments  to  programme  design;  appraising  the  continued  relevance  of  the 
programme  objective  to  the  country,  target  groups  and  IFAD  development  priorities; 
and  proactively  proposing  adjustments  to  the  project  design,  implementation 
arrangements  and  log-frame  when  appropriate.  In  addition,  IFAD  will  review  and 
provide  prior  no-objection  to  the  following  documents:  AWPB,  Procurement  Plan, 
tender  documents  and  evaluation  reports.  In  addition,  the  IFAD  Livestock 
Development desk at HQ will provide continue technical backstopping support from HQ 
and through direct implementation support to the SPIU. 
Programme coordination 
National level 
302.  The IFAD and ENABEL supported interventions (projects) will be managed by a single 
programme  management  team,  composed  of  two  project  teams  working  in  close 
collaboration.  Each of the two project teams will have its own coordinator and will be 
specifically  in  charge  of  the  activities  led  and  funded  under  its  project,  but  some 
activities (as indicated in the description of activities) will also be implemented jointly 
by the two project teams. Staff of the  respective two teams has been rationalized to 
avoid  duplication  of  efforts.  Technical  specialists  will  also  be  shared  to  reduce  costs 
and  enhance  coordination.  The  coordination  between  the  two  project  teams  will  be  a 
common  responsibility  of  the  two  project  coordinators  and  will  be  overseen  by  the 
188 
Rwanda 
Partnership for Resilient and Inclusive Small Livestock Markets (PRISM) 
Project Implementation Manual (DRAFT) 
SPIU  CoordinatorThe  project  staffing  will  be  composed  of  specific  staff  at  SPIU  level 
(Project Operations Manager, Livestock Specialist, Access to Finance Specialist, Project 
Accountant,  M&E  Officer,  Procurement  Officer  )  supported  by  SPIU  shared  staff  for 
crosscutting issues (Animal Health, Gender, KM and Communication, Nutrition, Climate 
Change  and  Environment,  and  Cooperative  Development),  and  District  staff  (District 
Project Coordinators and District Focal Points). 
303.  The ENABEL project team, will be led by a Project Intervention Manager (international 
technical  assistant,  livestock  specialist).  It  will  be  composed  of  two  Private  sector 
experts  (one  international  technical  assistant,  one  local  expert),  one  livestock 
Specialist,  one  extension  Specialist,  one  administrator,  one  finance  &  procurement 
specialist, and one accountant. 
304.  The  IFAD  project  coordination  team  will  be  equipped  with  two  4x4  vehicles;  in 
addition, a budget for car hire will be availed for Kigali movements. 
305.  Additional  staff  will  be  shared  with  other  projects,  for  crosscutting  and  shared 
functions  that  do  not  require  a  full  time  staff  as  follows;  the  percentage  of  the  cost 
covered  by  PRISM  and  other  projects  will  depend  on  the  time  allocated  to  each 
project, and on the number of active projects (probably 5 in 2020, 3 from 2021): 


Project Implementation Manual (DRAFT) 
District level 
308.  Co-implementation with decentralized entities: based on the experience from ongoing 
projects  under  RAB/MINAGRI,  the  project  will  create  partnerships  with  decentralized 
entities  (mostly  Districts)  in  order  to  implement  and  co-finance  activities  that  are 
under  their  direct  coordination:  vaccination  campaigns,  epidemio-surveillance, 
nutrition education and gender awareness trainings, etc.  
309.  PRISM  will  have  dedicated  staff  (District  Programme  Coordinators)  in  all  the  15 
Districts where it operates. The District Coordinators will be equipped with motorcycles 
and a monthly lumpsum budget for transport costs will be allocated to each of them. 
310.  In each District, a programme focal point will be designated. It should normally be the 
District  Animal  Resources  Officer,  but  depending  on  the  District  context,  it  could  also 
be  the  District  agribusiness  Officer  or  the  District  Cooperative  Development  Officer. 
The programme will allocate a lumpsum transport fee to the District Focal Point. 
311.  Any  district  staff  technical  staff  could  be  mobilized  for  programme  activities,  in 
particular  the  District  staff  in  charge  or  Animal  Resources  and  Animal  Health,  of 
nutrition, of cooperative development and of agribusiness. The programme will in this 
case  cover  their  transport  costs,  through  the  budget  related  to  the  specific  activity 
they are involved in. 
312.  MoUs will be signed with the Districts during the inception phase in order to formalize 
the modalities of partnership between the Districts and the project. 
313.  At  the  district  level,  the  Joint  Action  Development  Forum  (JADF),  made  up  of  district 
authorities,  local  and  international  NGOs,  farmer  and  community  organizations,  and 
traditional  and  religious  leaders,  meets  regularly  to  discuss  sectoral  issues.  The 
implementation  of  the  District  Development  Plan  is  overseen  by  the  JADF.  These 
forums are also essential in the implantation of the project. 
314.  In  order to facilitate the cooperation with the Districts, but also create synergies and 
exchanges  knowledge  between  Districts,  a  platform  will  be  established  at  Province 
level, where districts and SPIU will discuss about their cooperation. Two meetings will 
take place every year: one before commencing each fiscal year and one before project 
the  budget  review.  The  platform  shall  include  District  Vice  Mayors  in  charge  of 
economics affairs, District  animal Resource Officers, a  representative  of  the Province, 
RAB  deputy  Director  General  in  charge  of  animal  resources,  research  and  technology 
transfer, and the SPIU team. 
Partnerships 
Strategic partnerships  
315.  The implementation of  the PRISM will be structured around performance-based MoUs 
with  key  government  agencies,  partnership  agreement  with  key  partners  (HPI  and 
FAO)  and  service  contracts  with  recruited  service  providers.  To  ensure  uninterrupted 
service  delivery  during  project  implementation,  MINAGRI  will  draw  multi-year 
agreements with the key government implementing partners and  HPI  but provide for 
annual reviews to ensure strict adherence to achievement of results. 
316.  Partnerships  with  specialized  national  technical  agencies.  Partnerships  will  be 
established with relevant Government of Rwanda’s specialized technical agencies such 
as

RAB, in addition to being the implementing agency, will also play the role of 
implementing partner especially in the areas of animal health, genetics, 
research, and capacity building of District staff  
MINAGRI, in addition to its essential role for project supervision, will also be an 
implementing partner, in particular for activities related to policy and regulatory 
development 
Rwanda Standard Board and Rwanda Agriculture and Livestock Inspection and 
Certification Services for the support to the development and enforcement of 
food safety and animal welfare standards related to slaughtering, processing and 
transport facilities 
The Rwanda Cooperative Agency will be involved in support to cooperatives 
including in particular the youth cooperatives 
The National Early Childhood Development Programme (NECDP) will be involved 
in the delivery of nutrition education to youth cooperatives 
317.  When the partnership with a specialized agency implies a transfer of funds and a sub-
delegation  of  project  activities,  an  MoU  will  be  established  (except  for  RAB  and 
MINAGRI).  The  partner  agencies  will  be  requested  to  formulate  an  annual  work  plan 
and  budget  that  will  be  approved  by  the  OPSC  and  included  in  the  overall  project 
AWPB. 
318.  Synergies  and  partnership  with  other  development  partners  and  projects.
  In addition to its unique internal partnership arrangements, PRISM will also strive to 
avoid  duplication  and  ensure  harmonization/complementarity  with  other  projects. 
Strong opportunities for synergies have been identified in particular with the Feed the 
Future  Rwanda/  USAID  funded  project  called  "Orora  Wihaze"  which  will  sustainably 
increase  the  availability  of,  access  to,  and  consumption  of  animal-source  foods  (ASF) 
through development of a profitable market. The Feed the Future Rwanda/USAID office has 
launched a "Call for proposal" in order to identify a suitable local institution to implement the project 
"Orora Wihaze". See bow below: 
USAID - Feed the Future Rwanda "Orora Wihaze" ("Let's do it") 
The  purpose  of  the  project  is  to  sustainably  increase  the  availability  of,  access  to,  and 
consumption of animal-source foods (ASF) through development of a profitable market. The 
main  project's  targets  are:  (i)  income  for  at  least  125,000  households  increased;  (ii) 
prevalence of children 6-23 months receiving a minimum acceptable diet increased by 40%, 
and  (iii)  prevalence  of  women  of  reproductive  age  consuming  a  diet  of  minimum  diversity 
increased  by  40%.  The  focus  value  chains  will  include  poultry,  fish,  pig  and  goat  and  the 
project target area will cover eight districts included in the Feed the Future Rwanda Zone of 
Influence  (ZOI):  Rutsiro,  Nyabihu,  Ngororero,  Karongi,  Rubavu,Nyamasheke,  Nyamagabe, 
Burera, Gakenke, Kayonza, Gatsibo, Ngoma, and Bugesera. The total budget is between $12 
to $15 million for a 5 years period. 
The  project  seeks  to  remove  production,  marketing  and  consumption  constraints  affecting 
dietary diversity women of reproductive age (15-49 years of age), especially pregnant and 
lactating women (PLW), and of children between the ages  of 6 to 23  months in poor,  rural 
households. The Orora Wihaze project will use a private sector oriented, market facilitation 
approach  to  achieve  the  intended  goal.  The  approach  must  sustainably  increase  livestock 
productivity,  improve  relationships  across  actors  in  the  ASF  value  chains,  build  capacity  of 
191 
Rwanda 
Partnership for Resilient and Inclusive Small Livestock Markets (PRISM) 
Project Implementation Manual (DRAFT) 
enterprises  in  the  ASF  sector,  facilitate  access  to  finance  and  increase  private  sector 
investments  in  ASF  value  chains.  At  the  time  of  the  finalization  of  the  PRISM  project 
document, the  selected implementing institution is not known yet.  Therefore the  IFAD  ICO 
will  immediately  seek  alignment  as  soon  as  Feed  the  Future  Rwanda/USAID  will  publicly 
announce the implementing agency. 
319.  In the financial sector, other strategic partners will be ICCO Terrafina, which has been 
supporting the financial sector since several years, especially in the field of agriculture 
finance;  and  IMSAR  ,  a  DFID-funded  project  providing  technical  assistance  and 
financial instruments for the financial sector and agribusiness companies. 
320.  The programme will of course work in close partnership with two IFAD funded projects 
implemented under the SPIU as well, which it will share resources and means: 
321.  The  IFAD-funded  “Climate  Resilient  Post-Harvest  and  Agribusiness  Support 
Project”  (PASP)  will  play  an  important  role  through  its  efforts  to  curb  aflatoxin 
contamination  in  the  maize  value  chain.  The  introduction  of  appropriate  drying 
facilities/equipment (including large mobile dryers) is indeed expected to significantly 
reduce  moisture  levels  and  generally  improve  maize  drying  operations  countrywide, 
which  in  turn  will  increase  the  quality  of  maize  that  is  the  main  ingredient  in  animal 
feed produced in Rwanda.  
322.  The  IFAD-funded  Rwanda  Dairy  Development  Program  (RDDP)  covers  12 
districts  countrywide168,  focusing  on  developing  the  dairy  value  chain  through 
improving  cattle  productivity,  milk  quality  and  processing  capacity  of  the  dairy 
industry.  RDDP  is  also  strengthening  the  policy  and  institutional  framework  for  the 
sector.  PRISM  will  build  on  the  lessons  learned  along  RDDP  implementation,  and 
harmonize its interventions in the livestock sector. Whenever possible, the project will 
avoid  overlapping  with  RDDP  districts,  except  when  there  is  definite  comparative 
advantage  (e.g.  Rubavu  that  is  a  key  location  for  exports  to  DRC),  or  when  the 
poverty and malnutrition levels are the highest (e.g. Nyabihu or Rutsiro).  
Implementing partners 
323.  The  IFAD  supported  project  will  partner  with  the  international  organization  Heifer 
International in  co-investing  (approx.  USD  4.7  million)  and  co-implementing  selected 
activities under PRISM, building on successful previous experiences under KWAMP and 
the  grant  project  "Dairy  Hub  Model  integration  into  IFAD  funded  projects  in  Rwanda 
and Tanzania (Zanzibar)”. 
324.  Heifer  International  will  be  responsible  for  the  implementation  of  the  Values-Based 
Holistic  Community  Development  (VBHCD)  model  that  leads  to  sustainable  results  in 
community  transformation  through  enhanced  small  livestock  development  practices 
and  access  to  services  (veterinary,  inputs,  financial  and  marketing  services)  in  the 
context  of  vibrant  value  chains.  A  global  MOU  will  be  signed  between  MINAGRI  and 
Heifer  International  while  a  detailed  annual  AWPB  reflecting  activities  to  be 
implemented  by  Heifer  International  and  related  cost  (including its  own  co-financing) 
will be developed every fiscal year. 
168 Of which 3 districts in the North (Gicumbi, Burera and Musanze), 3 districts in the South (Nyanza, Huye and 
Ruhango) and 3 districts in the West (Nyabihu, Rubavu and Rutsiro). 
192

Partnership for Resilient and Inclusive Small Livestock Markets (PRISM) 
Project Implementation Manual (DRAFT) 
325.  The programme will enter into an MoU with FAO to implement activities in the animal 
health and food safety area where FAO has a very clear comparative advantage: FAO 
will provide support to RAB to develop the diseases contingency plans, to organize the 
simulation exercises of sanitary crisis, and support the development of food safety and 
animal  welfare  regulations  and  standards.  For  food  safety  related  support,  FAO  will 
mobilize  experts  from  the  “Codex  Alimentarius  Committee”  which  sets  international 
standards on food safety, and for contingency plans and simulation exercises, experts 
from  the  regional  and  global  ECTAD  (Emergency  Centre  for  Transboundary  Animal 
Diseases)  teams.  FAO-ECTAD  will  involve  OIE  experts  in  these  activities  but  under 
their  mutual  arrangements  and  the  project  will  not  enter  in  any  form  of  direct 
partnership  with  OIE.  The  participation  of  OIE  will  ensure  that  all  mechanism 
established  are  conform  to  international  standards  and  guidelines  related  to  animal 
health and welfare. 
326.  Finally, the programme will enter in an MoU with ILRI to ensure collaboration with the 
“African Chicken Genetic Gain ” funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. 
327.  VSFB  will  be  a  major  implementing  partner  for  the  ENABEL  funded  intervention  at 
production  level  (FFS,  biogas  and  animal  health).  VSFB  and  Heifer  will  be  invited  to 
closely  coordinate  their  activities  and  exchange  lessons,  even  if  they  will  not  be 
operating in the same geographic areas. 
Service providers 
328.  For the implementation of some of its activities that cannot be implemented by SPIU, 
RAB, or the Districts, the project will recourse to specialized service providers. Service 
providers  could  be  private  entities,  or  civil  society  organizations.  Private  service 
providers  will  be  preferred  when  the  purpose  is  to  provide  support  to  private  actors 
(producers  in  particular),  on  management  of  private  businesses.  NGOs  will  be 
preferred when the support is related to public or collective goods such as community 
development, support to civil society and stakeholders organizations. 
329.  The main service providers that will need to be mobilized by the project are as follows: 
 
 
 
 
 
Business  Development  Service  providers  (BDSP)  for  provision  of  initial  training 
(technical and business management) to youth groups, and continuous coaching 
(activity 1.2.1 and 1.2.2)

PRISM funded activities and processes into RAB, IFAD will support a start-up workshop 
where  RAB,  the  SPIU  and  all  implementing  partners  will  have  a  common 
understanding of the programme implementation strategy. During start-up, the roles, 
responsibilities  and  accountability  of  all  implementers  will  be  clarified  and  agreed. 
Their  capacities  will  be  assessed  and  matched  with  required  skills  so  that  adequate 
capacity  development  plans  can  be  prepared.  Feedback  mechanisms  will  be  also 
developed to enable quick decisions on what to adapt and improve in a flexible output-
oriented manner.

Planning and Budget Development 
332.  Planning  will  be  done  jointly  by  the  two  projects  in  order  to  avoid  overlapping  and  maximize 
complementarities and synergies. A single annual work plan and budget (AWPB) will be developed 
for the programme, which will articulate interventions under both fundings.  
333.  Planning  will  be  guided  by  the  project’s  strategy,  log-frame  and  broader  results 
framework  which  will  inform  the  development  of  annual  work  plans  and  budgets 
oriented towards planned results with clear identification of how planned activities are 
expected  to  lead  to  those  results.  Key  documents  for  planning  at  the  start  of  the 
Programme  are  the  Programme’s  Logical  Framework,  its  budget  and  the  initial 
agreements with implementing partners. 
334.  Logical  Framework.  The  format  for  the  annual  supervision  reports  includes  an 
appendix  for  revision  of  the  Logical  Framework.  The  log  frame  format  should  be 
aligned  with  the  ORMS.  Proposals  for  revision  (if  needed)  are  prepared  by  the  PMU 
(through  its  M&E  specialist)  and  reviewed  and  processed  by  the  annual  Supervision 
Missions. The log frame will be updated constantly, discussed and adequately analysed 
with  project  staff  especially  components  managers.  The  supervision  mission  is  in 
charge of reviewing and validating progress and data reported in the log frame.  
335.  Annual Work Plan and Budget (AWPB). The PMU in collaboration with the SPIU is 
responsible  to  allocate  Programme  resources  to  activities  through  annual  work  plans 
and  budgets.  The  PDR  includes  a  draft  AWPB  for  the  first  18  months  of  Programme 
Implementation  and  needs  to  be  updated  at  the  Programme’s  start,  following  the 
guidance given in the Financial Management Manual.  The results-based AWPB will be 
drawn  up  in  consultation  with  implementing  partners,  including  beneficiaries  (e.g. 
cooperatives) where relevant. The SPIU will be responsible for the process and for the 
inclusion  of  and  collaboration  with  key  stakeholders  in  the  planning  process.  AWPBs 
will be approved by the project steering committee and sent to IFAD for no objection 
60 days prior to the end of each fiscal year. IFAD will have 30 days for reviewing and 
196 
Rwanda 
Partnership for Resilient and Inclusive Small Livestock Markets (PRISM) 
Project Implementation Manual (DRAFT) 
provision  of  “No  Objection”  and  the  PMU  will  have  30  days  to  revise  and  finalize  the 
AWPB.  Following  GOR’s  planning  cycle,  the  fiscal  year  will  go  from  July  to  June.  To 
ensure  timely  submission  of  the  draft  AWPB  budget  preparation  will begin in January 
and end in April with the submission to the programme steering committee.  
336.  Procurement  Plans.  Each  AWPB  is  accompanied  by  a  procurement  plan,  which 
details  which  procurement  processes  will  take  place  in  the  upcoming period.  The  PPs 
derive  from  the  AWPBs  and  are  prepared  by  the  Procurement  specialist,  with  due 
inputs from the technical coordinators and M&E specialist. Due care should be taken to 
reflect the time requirement for procurement processes in the activity planning in the 
AWPBs. 
337.  Both the AWPB and the PP should be submitted to IFAD for no-objection after approval 
by  the  project  steering  committee.  Both  AWPB  and  PP  will  be  prepared  at  the 
beginning of each fiscal year but can be revised during the year based on the needs to 
be addressed. 
Financial Management 
Financial Responsibilities of Parties to the IFAD Loan Agreement 
338.  The  parties  to  the  loan  are  the  Government  of  Rwanda,  MINECOFIN  (the  designated 
Borrower)  and  IFAD  (designated  Lender),  and  the  Lead  project  Agency  (RAB),  and 
they all bear specific responsibility in project execution. The responsible offices will be 
held accountable for the achievement of project objectives within the framework of the 
law, prevailing constraints, and limits of authority and by embracing the best principles 
of public expenditure management.  
339.  MINECOFIN,  the  borrower,  will  be  fully  responsible  to  IFAD  for  the  due  and  timely 
performance  of  all  obligations  ascribed  to  in  the  Project  Loan  Agreement.  The 
obligations include: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Appointing the signatory to sign the Withdrawal Application  
Apply to the fund for the transfer of Funds from the project’s loan accounts into 
special accounts;  
Ensure that all parties perform their obligations; 
Open and operate the Special Accounts in a bank acceptable to the IFAD; 
Confirm to the Fund that GoR contributions have been availed and issued to the 
project as per AWPB; 
Appoint account signatories to the Special Account and operation accounts; and 
Pay the Loan service charge and the Principal. 
340.  The  Lead  Project  Agency  (RAB)  will  provide  oversight  role  and  policy  direction  to 
the  project,  review  the  project’s  AWPB  progress  against  set  targets  and  approve 
accordingly.  It  will  also  ensure  the  funds  are  used  economically  and  efficiently  to 
deliver project goals.  
341.  RAB will ensure that the project funds (from both GoR/IFAD) are budgeted for properly 
and captured in the IFIMS in the acceptable format. It shall also facilitate the Project 
to  access  both  GoR  and  IFAD  funds  in  time  for  smooth  implementation  of  project 
activities. 
342.  IFAD on the other hand, shall be responsible for:

 
 
 
Ensure the project is coordinated and implemented as per Loan Agreement; 
Responsible for overall financial management (budgeting, procurement,

system etc; 
Effect timely and accurate financial reporting and disclosures – publicity; and 
Preparation of withdrawal application and funds disbursement to implementing 
partners/agencies.  
Management and mitigation of fiduciary risks 
344.  The  accounting  system  and  the  chart  of  accounts  of  the  PRISM  will  be  based  on 
government  financial  and  accounting  procedures,  and  the  chart  of  account  to  be 
adopted  is  based  on  the  MINECOFIN  Standard  Chart  of  Accounts.  Currently  the 
accounting  method/basis  applicable  for  reporting  in  GoR  is  cash  basis  of  Accounting. 
The project shall account to IFAD on Generally Acceptable Accounting Practice (GAAP) 
and IPSAS cash based accounting method in line with GoR Financial Procedures.  
345.  Financial Management Systems (FMS). The GoR has widened the coverage of the 
Integrated  Financial  Management  System  (IFMIS)  to  include  non-budget  entities  and 
extra  budgetary  units  (these  include  recipients  of  external  grants  and  loans).  It  is  in 
this  context  that,  newly  designed  projects  within  the  IFAD/RAB  SPIU  are  required  to 
use the IFMIS as the accounting software.  The IFIMIS is a highly structured Financial 
Management  System  (FMS),  and  it  entails  careful  assignment  of  responsibilities  and 
approval processes (based on the existing SPIU expenditure approval structures). This 
will ensure effective internal control processes, financial reporting, budget monitoring, 
and commitment control for PRISM.  
346.  Financial  reporting.  The  set-up  of  the  chart  of  accounts  in  the  IFMIS  however,  is 
mainly  tailored  to  suit  government  reporting  requirements,  and  does  not  entirely 
facilitate  expenditure  classification  that  will  result  into  additional  disclosures  to  the 
financial reports required by IFAD (both interim and end of financial year). In order to 
capture  the  project  AWPB  into  the  IFIMIS,  the  activity  layout  in  the  AWPB  has  to  be 
re-ligned  to  the  layout  of  activities  in  the  MTEF.  MTEF  classification  of  activities  is  in 
198 
Rwanda 
Partnership for Resilient and Inclusive Small Livestock Markets (PRISM) 
Project Implementation Manual (DRAFT) 
the  form  of;  outcome,  output,  and  activity.  While  outcome  and  output  can  easily  be 
equated  to  a  component(s)  and  a  sub-component(s),  it  would  be  difficult  to  match 
activities  and  sub-activities  to  expenditure  classification  by  categories.  This  poses  a 
challenge  in  loan  administration  since  semi-automated  FM  systems  could  result  in 
untimely, inconsistent and error prone financial data. The Office of Budget formulation 
& Reform should explore the possibility of using the IFIMIS ‘reporting analysis tools’ to 
mitigate  this  risk  by;  (a)  configuring  a  reporting  template  for  AWPB  execution  by 
component within in the IFMIS, (b) include ‘Category’ as an expenditure classification 
which will be applicable to IFAD and other donors, (c) IFIMIS coordinator to meet IFAD 
team to agree on the applicability and timing of these changes. 
Financing flows and disbursement plan 
347.  The  ENABEL  and  IFAD  financing  will  have  distinct  financing  flows  and  financing 
reporting mechanisms.  
348.  To facilitate flow of PRISM funds to the SPIU, the following steps will be followed: 
 
 
 
 
Appropriate Project Bank Accounts will be opened and operated in line with the 
ENABEL/IFAD/Government procedures.  
The accounts are operated by the SPIU and HPI. 
The special accounts will be replenished by timely submitting Statements of 
Expenditure (SOEs) accompanied with bank statements, Special account 
reconciliations, cash book to bank reconciliations, among others to IFAD, and for 
ENABEL, the SPIU will follow the specified disbursement procedures. 
Only PRISM project funds will be transacted through these bank accounts, which 
clearly demarcate funds for the project rather than pool them with all other SPIU 
funds. 
349.  The SPIU will open and maintain five bank accounts for PRISM;  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Counterpart Account in FRW for the government counterpart funds  
IFAD Designated Account (DA) in US$ 
ENABEL Designated Account in US$ 
Operations Account in FRW/ENABEL 
Operations Account in FRW/IFAD 
HPI will open a PRISM dedicated operation bank in FRW to which PRISM will 
transfer funds, and receive funds for PRISM related activities from the HPI 
headquarters  
350.  All  five  bank  accounts  shall  be  held  in  the  National  Bank  of  Rwanda  (BNR),  with  the 
following signatories; 
 
 
 
 
The Director General (DG) of RAB 
The RAB DG of Corporate Services  
The SPIU Coordinator  
And SPIU/Head of Finance and Fiduciary aspects  
351.  The  DAs  are  maintained  by  the  SPIU  in  US$.  They  will  operate  with  an  advance 
payment from IFAD/ENABEL (Authorized Allocation) which will be in line with expected 
timeframes,  and 
patterns  of  expenditure,  withdrawal  application  processing 
199 
Rwanda 
Partnership for Resilient and Inclusive Small Livestock Markets (PRISM) 
Project Implementation Manual (DRAFT) 
requirements for financial efficiency. The DAs will be replenished following the rules set 
out in the IFAD Disbursement Handbook and the Letter to the Borrower.  
352.  In  order to  avoid difficulties in the replenishment of funds, the SPIU Head of Finance 
and  Chief  Accountant  must  ensure  that  all  expenditures  made  with  project  funds  by 
the various offices of the SPIU and by the other contracted service providers are duly 
justified by proper documentation on a strict regular basis. 
353.  To avoid funds flow constraints, since transfer of funds to HPI will be tagged to specific 
activities  as  per  the  approved  AWPB,  the  project  should  replenish  the  designated 
account immediately. To ensure that funds are used for intended purposes, the project 
should  provide  a  reporting  format  for  financial  management,  which  will  be 
accompanied  by  monthly  reconciled  cashbooks  on  a  quarterly  basis,  and/or  at  the 
request of the next transfer – whichever comes earlier.   
354.  The  following  conditions  need  to  be  met  by  RAB  for  IFAD/ENABEL  to  make  the  first 
disbursement of project funds to the DA:  
 
 
 
First AWPB receives IFAD no objection 
RAB opens project Designated Accounts in US$ and Operations Accounts in FRW 
in the National Bank of Rwanda; 
 Appointment of the Operations Manager; and Project Steering Committee is 
established. 
355.  The  SPIU  Operations  Accounts  will  be  used  to  make  payments  directly  to  suppliers, 
service  providers  and  contractors.  The  SPIU  Counterpart  Account  is  used  to  make 
payments  of  local  taxes  and  activities  fully  funded  by  government,  again  directly  to 
suppliers, service providers and contractors.  
356.  As  a  control  measure,  thresholds  for  the  management  of  project  bank  accounts  may 
be instituted by RAB. In such a case, the DG RAB - as the Chief Budget Manager, will 
delegate  power  to  the  signatories  as  per  the  provisions  of  the  Organic  law  on  State 
finances.  
357.  Currently, For all inter accounts transfer and payments, the national bank has adopted 
internet banking system. Within the SPIU, the documentation and initial operations are 
done by the accountants at the first level, verification and first authorized by the chief 
accountant at the second level, and signed off by the signatories of the bank accounts 
(SPIU DAF, Coordinator, and DG RAB or DG Corporate Services) at the third level and 
last level.  
358.  The  Designated  Accounts  and  the  SPIU  Operations  Accounts  would  be  the  preferred 
accounts  for  making  payments  to  local  and  international  contractors,  suppliers  and 
service providers.

Audit 
298.  External Audit. The current projects are all being audited by the Office of the Auditor 
General  (OAG)  as  mandated  under  the  government  Act/Law.  The  Office  has  legal 
personality  and  financial  and  administrative  autonomy;  hence,  while  discharging  its 
responsibilities,  the  Office  is  independent  and  does  not  receive  any  injunctions  from 
other  organs.  The  OAG  has  been  a  member  of  INTOSAI  and  AFROSAI  for  the  past 
twelve  years,  and  the  financial  audit  methodologies  applied  conform  to  international 
standards.  
201 
Rwanda 
Partnership for Resilient and Inclusive Small Livestock Markets (PRISM) 
Project Implementation Manual (DRAFT) 
299.  Reviews  of  the  quality  of  the  OAG  reports  for  existing  projects  indicate  highly 
satisfactory  performance  ratings,  with  positive comments  given  for  the  level  of  detail 
of  the  audits  and  use  of  acceptable  standards  (INTOSAI  auditing  standards).  It  is 
recommended therefore that RDDP will also be audited by the OAG. A complete set of 
Financial  Statements  specific  to  PRISM  will  be  prepared  in  accordance  with 
International  Public  Sector  Accounting  Standards  (IPSAS)  –  modified  cash  basis, 
audited by the OAG and submitted to IFAD before the 31st December.  
Procurement Procedures and Management 
359.  Introduction.  The  overall  procurement  responsibility  will  be  under  RAB,  but  the 
Rwanda procurement Law allows for the delegation of the procurement function by the 
Accounting officer to a Procuring Entity (PE). In this regard, the SPIU is considered a 
PE,  and  will  have  delegated  authority  from  the  DG  RAB  (herein  referred  to  as  the 
accounting officer) to undertake procurement processes. The procurement unit at the 
SPIU is made up of four experienced staff that includes a head of department and one 
procurement  officer  attached  to  every  project  within  the  SPIU.  PRISM  too  will  be 
required to recruit two procurement specialists for both IFAD and ENABEL financing in 
order  to  follow  their  respective  procurement  guidelines  which  are  different  on  some 
aspects.  
guidelines.  Special 
360.  According to the  IFAD  general conditions for  financing, ‘Procurement  of goods, works 
and  services  shall  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  the 
Borrower/Recipient’s  procurement  regulations;  to  the  extent  such  are  consistent  with 
the  IFAD  Procurement  Guidelines.  Therefore,  for  financing  that  will  be  channeled 
through RAB/SPIU bank accounts, as far as possible, national procurement procedures 
will be applied, except for guidelines specific to ENABEL or IFAD (e.g. threshold for no 
objection requests and use of ICB for given thresholds). As for funds that do not flow 
through  PRISM  bank  accounts,  co-financiers  such  as  Heifer  will  apply  own 
given 
procurement 
to specialized activities  mentioned  in  the  project  document  which  will  be  co-financed 
and  implemented  jointly  with  ENABEL,  through  VSFB  as  an  implementing  partner.  In 
such instances direct contracting method of procurement will be applied. As for funds 
that  do  not  flow through  PRISM  bank  accounts, co-financiers  will  apply  own 
procurement  guidelines.  General  conditions  further  state  that  each  Procurement  Plan 
shall  identify  procedures  which  must  be  implemented  by  the  Borrower/Recipient  in 
order to ensure consistency with the IFAD Procurement Guidelines’. By specifying that 
the  borrower’s  or  recipient’s  procurement  regulations  must  be  consistent  with  IFAD’s 
procurement  guidelines,  and  by  requiring  the  borrower/recipient  and  the  Fund  to 
agree on mandatory procedures, it ensures that there is consistency, and that the is a 
more predictable and coherent approach to procurement processes.  
consideration,  however,  will

followed at all times. In addition;

IFAD  may  permit  the  adoption  of  the  Borrower’s  national  procurement 
regulations provided that such regulations are compatible with IFAD’s guidelines. 
362.  Project Specific principles are; 
 
 
 
 
 
Procurement is carried out in accordance with the  Financing Agreement and the 
Letter  to  the  Borrower  (and  PIM)  and  any  amendments  thereto  as  reflected  in 
the Fund’s Mission Reports (e.g. supervision reports, mid-term reviews, back-to-
office reports, aide- memoires, and correspondence);  
Procurement  is  to  be  conducted  within  the  project  implementation  period  (from 
the  date  of  effectiveness  to  the  date  of  completion).  Procurement  cannot  be 
undertaken between the date of completion and the closing date;  
Does  not  exceed  the  availability  of  funds  duly  allocated  by  the  financial 
agreement  
Is consistent with the approved Annual Work Plan and Budget; and  
Provides  the  best  value  for  money:  Best  value  does  not  necessarily  mean  the 
lowest initial SPIU option, but rather represents the best return on investments, 
taking  into  consideration  the  unique  and  specific  circumstances  of  each 
procurement  activity;  the  balance  of  time,  cost  and  quality  required;  and  the 
successful overall outcome of the contract in meeting its original objectives.  
363.  National  rules  and  regulations.  Public  procurement  in  Rwanda  is  governed  by  the 
Law  on  Public  Procurement  no.  12/2007  of  29/03/2007  and  ministerial  order  no. 
001/08/10/MIN  of  16/01/2008  establishing  the  procurement  regulations.  The  Law  on 
Public  Procurement  applies  to  procurement  conducted  by  Central  Government 
authorities,  Local  Government  authorities,  public 
institutions,  Commissions, 
Government  projects, parastatals, agencies  or  specialized institutions.  The 2007  Law, 
based  on  the  UNCITRAL  model  brings  to  a  new  level  the  existing  public  procurement 
framework and is generally consistent with international standards. 
364.  The Government has also undertaken the use of national Standard Bidding Documents 
(SBDs), modeled after the World Bank’s SBDs. All are published on the RPPA website 
(http://www.rppa.gov.rw/)  for  public  use.  In  addition  to  the  amendment  to  the  law, 
RPPA  has  prepared  a  Standard  Manual  for  Public  Procurement  (User’s  Guide)  for  the 
benefit  of  practitioners.  With  this  action  one  of  the  gaps  identified  under  the  current 
assessment (lack of a unique national manual for procuring entities) has been filled.  
365.  According  to  the  Law,  RPPA  retained  the  responsibility  for  conducting  procurement 
processes  (except  preparation  of  the  bidding  documents)  for  a  three  years  transition 
period  for  agreed  thresholds.  The  final  move  to  decentralization  in  February  2011 
followed  a  period  of  gradual  devolution  (with  an  annual  increase  in  authority  for  the 
decentralized  entities).  It  is  now  enacted  that  as  from  20  March  2012,  RPPA  only 
exercise  regulatory  functions,  and  has  devolved  all  procurement  processes  to  the 
government procuring agencies (Ministries and projects i.e.). It is on this basis that for 
all  IFAD  funded  projects  there  is  no  longer  need  for  "no  objection"  request  from  the 
RPPA.  
Procurement and prior review thresholds. The following procurement and prior review 
thresholds shall apply:

366.  Internal  Tender  Committee.  The  Internal  Tender  Committee  is  already  in  place. 
Appointment of members to the tender committee is the responsibility of the DG RAB. 
Currently, the Internal Tender Committee is made up of five members; Tea Specialist 
(Chairperson),  Climate  and  Environment  Specialist  (Vice  chairperson),  Access  to 
Finance Specialist, Market Support Specialist, and a procurement officer (as secretary 
depending on the project issuing the tender). A member of the tender committee has 
a  mandate  of  3  years  –  renewable  only  once.  Half  of  the  Internal  Tender  Committee 
cannot  have  their  membership  renewed  at  the  same  time.  PRISM  will  use  the  same 
tender committee. 
367.  Contract management. Contract management will be regulated by the law on public 
procurement.  There  is  however,  one  specific  arrangement  with  regard  to  practices  of 
the  SPIU  where;  if  a  contract  is  amended  with  the  increase  of  contract  amount,  the 
amendment  will  be  signed  by  both  parties,  whereas  when  the  contract  is  extended 
without  increase  of  contract  amount,  a  letter  will  be  signed  by  the  DG  RAB  notifying 
the  contractor  of  the  extension  of  contract  period  and  indicating  the  reasons  of  this 
extension. 
368.  Fraud and Corruption : The Revised IFAD Policy on Preventing Fraud and Corruption 
in Its Activities and Operations (hereinafter, the "Revised Policy") applies to individuals 
and entities that receive,  apply to  receive, are responsible for the deposit or transfer 
of, or take or influence decisions regarding the use of proceeds from IFAD financing or 
financing  managed  by  IFAD,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  implementing  partners, 
service  providers,  contractors,  suppliers,  subcontractors,  sub-suppliers,  bidders, 
consultant  and  any  of  their  agents  or  personnel  (all  such  individuals  and  entities  are 
collectively  referred  to  as  "Third  Parties"  or  "Third  Party").  Pursuant  to  the  Revised 
Policy,  third  parties  shall  refrain  from  engaging  in  the  following  practices,  which  are 
204 
Rwanda 
Partnership for Resilient and Inclusive Small Livestock Markets (PRISM) 
Project Implementation Manual (DRAFT) 
considered  to  be  prohibited  practices  when  engaged  in  connection  with  an  IFAD-
financed and/or IFAD-managed operation or activity: 
(i)  a  “corrupt  practice”  is  the  offering,  giving,  receiving  or  soliciting,  directly  or 
indirectly,  of  anything  of  value  in  order  to  improperly  influence  the  actions  of 
another party; 
(ii)  a “fraudulent practice” is any act or omission, including a misrepresentation, that 
knowingly  or  recklessly  misleads,  or  attempts  to  mislead,  a  party  in  order  to 
obtain a financial or other benefit or to avoid an obligation; 
(iii)  a  “collusive  practice”  is  an  arrangement  between  two  or  more  parties  designed 
to  achieve  an  improper  purpose,  including  improperly  influencing  the  actions  of 
another party; 
(iv) a “coercive practice” is impairing or harming, or threatening to impair or harm, 
directly or indirectly, any party or the property of the party to improperly 
influence the actions of that or another party; 
(v) an “obstructive practice” is: 
(a) deliberately destroying, falsifying, altering or concealing evidence that may 
be material to an investigation by IFAD or making false statements to 
investigators in order to materially impede an investigation by IFAD; 
(b) threatening, harassing or intimidating any party in order to prevent that 
party from disclosing its knowledge of matters relevant to an investigation 
by IFAD or from pursuing such an investigation; and/or 
(c) the commission of any act intended to materially impede the exercise of 
IFAD's contractual rights of audit, inspection and access to information, 
provided for under clause 62 below. 
In pursuance of this policy: 
(i)  Third Parties shall disclose, in the course  of a  procurement process  or any time 
thereafter,  information  relating  to  themselves  or  any  of  their  key  personnel 
concerning: 
(aa) relevant criminal convictions, administrative sanctions and/or temporary 
suspensions; 
(bb) agents engaged in connection with a procurement process or the execution 
of a contract, including the commissions or fees paid or to be paid; and 
(cc) any actual or potential conflict of interest in connection with a procurement 
process or the execution of a contract; 
(ii)  Third Parties shall promptly report to IFAD any allegations or other indications of 
prohibited practices that come to their attention by virtue of their involvement in 
an IFAD-financed and/or IFAD-managed operation or activity; 
(iii)  IFAD  possesses  jurisdiction  to  investigate  allegations  and  other  indications  of 
prohibited  practises  and  to  impose  sanctions  on  Third  Parties  for  such  practices 
in connection with an IFAD-financed and/or IFAD-managed operation or activity; 
(iv) Third  Parties  shall  fully  cooperate  with  any  investigation  conducted  by  IFAD, 
205 
Rwanda 
Partnership for Resilient and Inclusive Small Livestock Markets (PRISM) 
Project Implementation Manual (DRAFT) 
including  by  making  personnel  available  for  interviews  and  by  providing  full 
access  to  any  and  all  accounts,  premises,  documents  and  records  (including 
electronic records)  relating to the relevant IFAD-financed and/or IFAD-managed 
operation  or  activity  and  to  have  such  accounts,  premises,  records  and 
documents  audited  and/or  inspected  by  auditors  and/or  investigators  appointed 
by IFAD; 
(v)  Third  Parties  shall  maintain  all  accounts,  documents  and  records  relating  to  an 
IFAD-financed and/or IFAD-managed operation or activity for a period of 3 years 
after completion of the bid; 
(vi) Should  IFAD  determine  that  a  Third  Party  has  engaged  in  any  of  the  prohibited 
practices defined under clause 61 above, it may impose on the Third Party any of 
the administrative sanctions provided by the Revised Policy, Section F, (ii); 
(vii) During the course of an IFAD review or investigation, or pending the conclusion 
of a sanctioning process, IFAD may decide, at any time, to temporarily suspend 
payments  to  a  Third  Party  or  to  temporarily  suspend  its  eligibility  to  participate 
in  IFAD-financed  and/or  IFAD  managed  operations  and  activities  for  an  initial 
period  of  six  (6)  months,  subject  to  a  possible  extension  of  that  suspension  for 
an additional period of six (6) months, as provided by the Revised Policy, Section 
F, (i); 
(viii)  Public entities receiving IFAD financing or financing managed by IFAD and any 
of  their  agents  or  personnel  and  private  entities  receiving  IFAD  financing  or 
financing managed by IFAD and any of their agents or personnel shall terminate 
or  suspend  the  contract  if  such  termination  or  suspension  is  required  as  a 
consequence  of  a  temporary  suspension  or  sanction  imposed  or  recognized  by 
IFAD; 
369.  Furthermore,  the  project's  attention  is  drawn  to  IFAD's  policy  of  unilaterally 
recognizing  debarments  imposed  by  other  International  Financial  Institutions  if  such 
debarments  meet  the  requirements  for  mutual  recognition  under  the  Agreement  for 
Mutual Enforcement of Debarment Decisions. 
Monitoring and Evaluation 
Monitoring and evaluation 
370.  The programme will have a common M&E system with a number of common indicators 
for  both  interventions,  that  will  feed  into  MINAGRI’s  new  management  information 
system  (MIS),  IFAD’s  new  Operational  Results  Management  System  (ORMS),  and 
ENABEL “PILOT” system. 
371.  Monitoring  &  evaluation  (M&E)  are  closely  linked  to  the  plans  described  above.  The 
M&E system will collect, collate and analyse data, both qualitative and quantitative, to 
inform decision-makers and management about the project progress against expected 
result,  identify  implementation  bottlenecks  and  take  timely  corrective  action  when 
needed.  
372.  The  IFAD  supported  project  employs  several  complementary  mechanisms  to  keep 
track  of  and  analyse  its  achievements:  a  Management  Information  System  (MIS), 
206 
Rwanda 
Partnership for Resilient and Inclusive Small Livestock Markets (PRISM) 
Project Implementation Manual (DRAFT) 
baseline,  mid  -term  and  completion  surveys,  thematic  studies  and  joint  reviews 
(participatory  assessments);  as  well  as  less  standardised  mechanisms,  including 
feedback on the implementation of agreements. The MIS will act as database to track 
and analyse implementation achievements of outputs, outcomes and impacts. 
373.  Management  information  system  (MIS).  The  MIS  keeps  track  of  implementation 
progress  and  is  chiefly  concerned  with  tracking  activities  and  results  (outputs  and 
outcomes). The MIS is developed by the SPIU and the project M&E officer and aligned 
with  the  MINAGRI’s  MIS.  It  will  collect  information  and  report  on  the  project 
components, Logical Framework and AWPBs progress. The MIS is updated on an as & 
when-basis, and reports are produced at least quarterly.  
374.  The  risks  identified  in  the  PRISM  risks  matrix,  as  well  as  other  external  factors  that 
come  to  affect  the  Programme  during  its  implementation  are  monitored  as  well,  and 
indicators gauging the effect and likelihood of these risks are included in the MIS.  
375.  IFAD  Core  Indicators.  Relevant  indicators  have  been  identified  in  the  PRISM  log 
frame and targets estimated. Each intervention/project will have its own log frame but 
it  will  reflect  the  partner’s  indicator  too.  The  indicators  relate  to  the  different  levels 
(output,  outcome  and  impact),  and  include  IFAD  Core  Indicators  (CIs),  relevant 
COSOP indicators, as well as project specific indicators. The log frame will be updated 
constantly  and  presented  to  the  supervision  mission  which  is  in  charge  of  reviewing 
and validating progress and data reported in the log frame. 
376.  Baseline,  mid-term  and  completion  surveys.  In  order  to  capture  information  on 
PRISM  effects  and  impacts,  separate  studies  will  be  undertaken  jointly  by  IFAD  and 
ENABEL  to  evaluate  how  successful  PRISM  is  vis-à-vis  its  overall  goal.  These  studies 
inter  alia  show  whether  the  economic  and  financial  benefits  of  the  programme  have 
been  predicted  correctly.  The  baseline  studies  and  follow-up  surveys  combine 
collection  of  basic  demographic  and  socio-economic  data  with  application  of  the 
Minimum  Diversity  Diet  for  women  analysis,  in  order  to  understand  and  assess 
impacts on poverty reduction.  
377.  Studies. Good monitoring and evaluation requires understanding how an intervention 
translates into an impact on poverty, nutrition and resilience. To this end, PRISM has 
funds  to  undertake  in-depth  studies  into  the  mechanisms  that  are  expected  to 
increase the small livestock production and the access to market (e.g. mapping of the 
financial sector, market assessment). The studies will be outsourced based on a term 
of reference and an appropriate procurement process. For the tracer studies into land 
tenure a single source has been identified during programme design. 
Learning and knowledge management 
378.  The  core  relevance  of  the  M&E  system  is  in  the  use  of  the  information  to  improve 
current project performance and results and inform the Government and development 
partners on future investments.  
379.  A  knowledge  management  strategy  for  the  drought-prone  agricultural  sectors  (in 
alignment  with  the  broad  KM  and  communication  strategy  of  MINAGRI)  will  be 
developed  built  on  three  core  pillars  of  knowledge  management:  people,  processes 
and  technology.  The  strategy  will  outline  systems,  processes  and  responsibilities  to 
207 
Rwanda 
Partnership for Resilient and Inclusive Small Livestock Markets (PRISM) 
Project Implementation Manual (DRAFT) 
ensure  that  the  project  will  generate,  capture,  analyse,  document,  package  and 
disseminate knowledge and lessons learnt throughout the project as well as externally.  
380.  Learning and knowledge management is a cross-cutting activity and derives its lessons 
from  knowledge  management,  monitoring  and  evaluation  in  all  components  of  the 
Programme.  This  implies  that  all  technical  coordinators  are  party  in  the  knowledge 
management process and responsible for drawing lessons for the sub-set of activities 
that they are responsible for. 
Communication and Reporting 
381.  Reporting will be done jointly by the two projects. The programme will collaborate with 
the  Agricultural  Information  and  Communication  Centre  (CICA)  within  MINAGRI  to 
produce  relevant  knowledge  products  and  ensure  documentation  of  lessons  learnt, 
best  practices  and  success  cases.  Communication  materials,  such  as  press  releases, 
extension materials, and radio spots will be prepared and distributed through a PRISM 
and relevant. 
382.  The  SPIU  KM  Officer  is  responsible  for  a  good  presentation  of  the  external 
communication. Whereas the technical coordinators and the M&E officer (and at times 
the Project Coordinator) will contribute most of the substance, she/he will structure all 
standard  external  communications,  such  as  recurrent  reports,  study  reports,  website 
material,  factsheets  and  press  releases.  This  includes  attention  to  branding,  lay-out 
and text editing.  
383.  Reports.  Reporting  will  be  done  jointly  by  the  two  projects.  The  programme  will 
prepare quarterly, semi-annual and annual progress reports. The progress reports will 
include  a  qualitative  and  quantitative  discussion  of  progress;  a  review  of  programme 
management  and  a  section  dedicated  to  issues  affecting  the  effective  programme 
implementation. This section shall include proposals on how to resolve the issue, and 
will serve to inform decision-making in the PSC.  
384.  Website. A  simple website will be developed for PRIMS, preferably  embedded within 
the  website  of  MINAGRI.  The  website  will  provide  access  to  the  reports  published  by 
the project. Links will be provided to relevant departments.  
385.  Factsheets.  These  provide  succinct  summaries  of  lessons  learned  in the  programme 
and  shall  have  a  wide  circulation.  They  are  essentially  brief  and  should  lead  the 
interested  reader  to  the  concerned  key  informant  (technical  coordinator)  and  the 
relevant  technical  documentation.  Factsheets  describe  lessons  that  the  PMU  thinks 
should  be  incorporated  into  relevant  programmes  and  policies;  and  are  produced  to 
influence decisions.  
Supervision and implementation support 
386.  IFAD  and  ENABEL  will  undertake  jointly  one  supervision  mission  and  one  follow  up 
mission  each  on  a  six-monthly  arrangement  are  proposed  as  per  current  IFAD 
supervision and implementation support arrangements.  
387.  Supervision  missions  will  adhere  to  the  standard  approach  set  by  IFAD.  Outcomes 
of the Mission will be recorded in an Aide-Memoire that is signed by Government and 
IFAD;  followed  shortly  by  a  more  detailed  Supervision  Report  and  a  Management 
Letter from IFAD. Supervision missions will focus on the AWPB and will help adjust the 
Logical Framework, if and when needed. Each  mission will include review  of fiduciary 
208 
Rwanda 
Partnership for Resilient and Inclusive Small Livestock Markets (PRISM) 
Project Implementation Manual (DRAFT) 
management  and  procurement  processes.  For  reasons  of  continuity,  there  will  be  as 
much continuity in the mission members as possible.  
388.  Implementation  support  is  more  flexible  and  can  focus  on  issues  identified  by  the 
PMU and / or the supervision missions. Mission composition is, however, decided upon 
by IFAD. 
Grievance and redressal procedures/ complaints handling 
PRISM grievance redress mechanisms  
389.  Communities  and  individuals  who  believe  that  they  are  adversely  affected  by  PRISM 
can  submit  complaints  through  the  grievance  redress  mechanism  of  the  project.  The 
mechanism  ensures  that  complaints  are  promptly  reviewed  in  order  to  address 
concerns  related  to  PRISM.  Complaints  are  submitted  to  an  assigned  person  in  the 
SPIU who determines whether harm occurred, or could occur, as a result of IFAD non-
compliance  with  its  policies  and  procedures.  For  more  information  on  IFAD's

and 
1.1 Mechanism for resolving grievances and complaints at community level 
390.  Grievance  redress  mechanisms  provide  an  avenue  to  express  concerns,  achieve 
remedies for communities, promote a mutually constructive relationship and enhance 
the  achievement  of  project  development  objectives.  Grievance  redress  mechanisms 
are  increasingly  important  for  development  projects  where  ongoing  risks  or  adverse 
impacts  are  anticipated.  They  serve  as  a  way  to  prevent  and  address  community 
concerns,  reduce  risk,  and  assist  larger  processes  that  create  positive  social  change. 
They  support  building  strong  and  effective  relationships  with  all  those  directly 
impacted  by  project  activities.  The  management  of  grievances  is  therefore  a  vital 
element of stakeholder management and an important aspect of risk management for 
the project. 
1.2 Grievance redress mechanism 
391.  Stage 1: The grievance /complaint is made by a minimum of two people, who should 
be nationals of the country concerned and/or living in the project area. Complainants 
should first bring the matter before Project District focal point to explain their concern. 
The  District  focal  point  will  then  review  the  complaint  and  will  assist  in  filling  in  the 
Project  Complaint  Register  Form,  that  SPIU  will  provide,  that  will  specify  the  reasons 
for  the  concern(s)  with  a  possible/preferable  settlement  proposal.  The  complaint  and 
settlement  proposal  in  writing  will  be  signed  by  the  complainant(s)  and  the  District 
focal point. 
392.  The  issue  may  be  brought  straight  to  IFAD  if  the  complainants  feel  they  may  be 
subject  to  retaliation  if  they  were  to  go  to  the  government/lead  agency  first.  IFAD 
guarantees confidentiality if requested by the complainants. 
209 
Rwanda 
Partnership for Resilient and Inclusive Small Livestock Markets (PRISM) 
Project Implementation Manual (DRAFT) 
393.  Stage 2: One copy of the Project Complaint Register Form will be filed at the  District 
project  focal  point  level,  one  copy  given  to  the  complainant(s)  and  one  will  be 
submitted  to  SPIU.  Within  15  working  days  after  receiving  the  official  complaint,  a 
member  of  SPIU,  related  field  specialists  and  the  District  focal  point  will  visit  the 
complainant  to  evaluate  the  severity  of  the  grievance  and  determine  the  appropriate 
management response. This may include commencing an investigation into the causes 
of the concern. If a solution is found, it will be captured in writing and the document 
signed by all concerned parties. 
394.  Stage  3:  In  cases  where  the  complainant  is  dissatisfied  with  the  outcome  of  the 
intervention in stage two, an official complaint appeal will be submitted to the SPIU for 
settlement within 10 working days. If a solution is reached, it will then be signed by all 
concerned parties. 
395.  Stage  4:  In  cases  where  the  settlement  or  solution  of  the  grievance/complaint is  not 
acceptable to the complainant, the next step will be TWO OPTIONS:  
396.  OPTION 1: To take the matter to an appropriate court. This implies that the matter at 
this  point is  a  judicial issue  to  which  the  applicable  Rwandan  laws  will  be  applied.  At 
this stage, the responsibility will be with the courts and not with the SPIU. 
397.  OPTION2: To bring the matter to IFAD. Complaints are received by IFAD’s Programme 
Management  Department  (PMD),  which  will  refer  the  complaint  to  the  responsible 
regional division director and country programme manager. The regional division then 
examines  the  complaint  and  if  eligible  contacts  the  lead  agency  (SPIU),  or 
governmental body overseeing the lead agency, to decide if the complaint is justified. 
If  the  complaint  is  not  justified,  the  regional  division  informs  the  complainants  in 
writing.  If  the  regional  division  finds  the  complaint  justified  with  proof  of  actual  or 
likely harm through IFAD’s failure to follow its policies and procedures, IFAD will take 
action. This may consist of making changes to the project or requiring the government 
to  observe  its  obligations  under  the  Financing  Agreement.  The  regional  division 
informs the complainants of the outcome.  
398.  If  complainants  disagree  with  IFAD’s  response  through  the  above  offices,  they  may 
request that an impartial review be conducted by the Office of the President and Vice-
President  (OPV).  The  OPV  decides  how  such  complaints  are  examined,  including  if 
necessary,  contracting  external  experts  to  review  the  matter.  Complainants  are 
informed of the results of the review. 
Anticipated grievances 
399.  Potential grievances could include: 
 
 
 
 
Conflicts over land ownership involving project beneficiaries 
Negative Impact of public/private infrastructures supported by the project (e.g. 
smell) 
Degradations caused by animals supplied by the project 
Distorsion of competition  
Grievance prevention 
210

Project Implementation Manual (DRAFT) 
400.  There  are  ways  to  proactively  solve  issues  before  they  even  become  grievances. 
Project implementers  should be aware and accept that grievances are likely to  occur. 
Dealing with them is part of the work and they should be  considered in a work plan. 
Project implementers can prevent complaints by the following: 
 
 
 
Providing sufficient and timely information to communities 
Conducting meaningful community consultations involving all stakeholders 
Building capacity for project staff, particularly in community facilitations and 
other field-related issues 
Timeframe 
401.  There is no standard model for grievance  resolution. The best ways to solve conflicts 
are in most cases through local mechanisms that take into account the specific cultural 
context,  local  customs,  and  project  conditions  and  scale.  In  its  simplest  form,  a 
grievance mechanism can be broken down into the following components: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Receipt and register of a complaint 
Formulate a response 
Select a resolution approach, based on consultation with affected person/group.  
Implement the approach  
Settle the issues 
Track and evaluate results 
Learn from the experience and communicate back to all parties involved.

Once  the  farmers  have  received  their  investment  package,  the  BDSP  will 
organize for the farmer groups a 1-day session on a selected voluntary farm, 
dedicated to the calculation of production costs and establishment of simple, 
user-friendly  monitoring  forms  that  will  be  used  by  the  farmers  to  record 
their  expenditures  and  interventions  on  a  daily  basis.  On  this  occasion,  the 
BDSP  will  seek  the  presence  of  a  representative  of  the  input  supplier 
involved  in  productive  alliances  (i.e.  ‘Layer  Partner’;  ‘Pig  Partner’),  who  will 
provide his insight on input-related costs. 
Continuous  provision  of  Business  Development  Services:  each  individual 
farmer  will  then  be  visited  at  least  once  per  month  over  a  period  of  12 
months  (for  pigs)  or  18  months  (for  layers),  to  ensure  close  follow-up  of 
operations  and  provide  backstopping  support  where  needed.  Particular 
emphasis  will  be  put  on  the  cost-benefit  analysis  and  adequation  of 
quantities, quality and prices to the market demand. For the latter, the BDSP 
in  productive  alliance  will  work  in  very  close  relation  with  the  other  BDSPs 
(the ‘Pig BDSP’ and the ‘Poultry BDSP’) recruited for market facilitation under 
sub-component 2.2 of the project.  
The  last  part  of  the  support  will  be  dedicated  to  a  1-day  group  session  for 
the  development  of  simple,  bankable  business  plans  meant  to  back  loan 
applications for the renewal of the investment package (layer/pig stock) and 
related working capital (esp. for input-feed purchase).  
Deliverables 
The key deliverables of the BDSPs in productive alliances will focus around 
the ability of farmers engaged in productive alliances to:  
1) Record, calculate and analyse their production costs;  
2) Monitor their break-even point and make enlightened decisions as regards to 
working capital needs, selling prices, new investments, etc.;  
3) Understand the market demand in terms of quality, volumes, timely delivery; 
and

1.1 Project background and context [To update as needed] 
234 
Rwanda 
Partnership for Resilient and Inclusive Small Livestock Markets (PRISM) 
Project Implementation Manual (DRAFT) 
PRISM  is  a  5  years  Project  implemented  by  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and 
Animal  Resources  through  the  Rwanda  Agricultural  Board  and  funded  by 
IFAD.  The  overall  objective  of  the  project  is  to  reduce  poverty  by 
empowering  poor  rural  men,  women  and  youth  to  participate  in  the 
transformation  of  the  Rwanda  agriculture  sector  and  to  enhance  their 
resilience.  Specifically,  the  project  seeks  to  increase  competitiveness  and 
profitability of the small livestock sector for the provision of quality products 
from smallholder producers to domestic and regional consumers. 
The  project  expects  to  reach  at  least  50,000  households  by  2024, 
representing 120,000 household members. The targeting mechanism will be 
based  on  the  national  Ubudehe  system.  The  main  direct  beneficiary  group 
will  be  the  poor  and  food  insecure  rural  households  in  Categories  2  and  3. 
Category  1  -  most  vulnerable  and  landless)  will  be  targeted  through  social 
mobilization  activities  and  for  small  ruminants  and  backyard  chicken 
production.  Category  4  “those  who  own  large-scale  businesses”  could  be 
targeted  as  sources  of  training,  supplier  credit  of  inputs  or  buyer  credit  for 
access to more lucrative market outlets and could as well be involved as will 
be involved as drivers in 4P models. 
In order to improve the competitiveness of the value chain, the project will 
develop  three  groups  of  activities.  The  first  group  of  activities  will  establish 
clusters  and  help  VC  actors  from  the  same  cluster  to  address  the  poor 
organization  of  the  value  chain,  and  the  insufficient  access  to  services  and 
markets,  through  promotion  of  innovative  value  chain  arrangements  and 
improved  access  to  finance.  The  second  group  of  activities  will  aim  at 
building  technical  and  business  capacities  of  value  chain  actors  in  order  to 
improve  the  productivity  of  the  production  systems,  the  management  of 
farms and service provision enterprises, as well as the sanitary conditions of 
slaughtering and processing facilities. The third group of activities will aim at 
improving the institutional framework (policy, regulations) in order to make 
the context more enabling for the proposed changes.  
The  project  will  help  smallholder  farmers,  who  are  the  primary  targets,  to 
benefit  from  the  opportunity  offered  by  the  increasing  demand  for  animal 
products,  in  particular  those  from  small  livestock  (eggs,  white  meat,  small 
ruminant meat), by helping them take an active part in this emerging value 
chain. 
In  order  to  play  a  more  active  role  in  the  value  chain,  smallholder  farmers 
have  to  improve  their  competitiveness  and  their  technical  and  economical 
performance;  this  will  be  achieved  through  various  means  including  in 
particular: 
  strengthening  their  technical  capacities  to  enable  them  to  intensify  the 
production and improve the productivity of their small stock 
235 
Rwanda 
Partnership for Resilient and Inclusive Small Livestock Markets (PRISM) 
Project Implementation Manual (DRAFT) 
  strengthening  their  business  management  capacities  to  enable  them  to 
envisage farming as a business 
The  project  outcome  will  be  achieved  through  the  implementation  of  3 
components: 
  Component 1: Facilitating access to services, finance and market in targeted 
clusters 
  Component 2: Supporting the competitiveness of value chain actors  
  Component 3: strengthening the institutional environment 
Within ‘Component 2: Supporting the competitiveness of value chain actors’ 
access  to  finance  is  being  supported  under  the  project.  The  project  will 
facilitate linkage of the smallholder farmers under productive alliance170 with 
the  financial  sector,  to  finance  investments  and  working  capital.  It  will  also 
contribute  to  linking  vulnerable  households  under  the  graduation  pathway 
under  component  1  to  access  formal  financial  services  as  one  of  the 
graduation indicators, and to linking youths supported under component 1 to 
financial  institutions  for  the  financing  of  their  start  up  business  and  further 
development of the business.  
1.2 Overview of the assignment 
It  is  within  this  context  that  a  specialized  service  provider  is  sought  to 
provide  technical  assistance  to  selected  financial  institutions  to  develop 
adapted  financial  products  and  delivery  channels  for  the  beneficiaries  the 
Project, with different approaches for farmers under productive alliances and 
other  beneficiaries  of  the  Project  (vulnerable  households  under  graduation 
pathway and youths). 
As  a  result  of  these  activities  it  is  expected  that  a  total  of  210  financial 
institutions  will  be  supported  (x  commercial  banks,  x  MFIs  and  x  SACCOs), 
for linkages with at least xx farmers under productive alliance, xx vulnerable 
households and xx youths. 
2. Scope of work 
The  service  provider  shall  carry  out  the  following  key  activities,  in  close 
consultation  with  and  under  supervision  by  the  Project  Access  to  Finance 
Specialist: 
2.1 For farmers under productive alliances  
170  A  productive  alliance  is  a  contractual  arrangement  whereby  a  group  of  farmers  enters  into  an  agreement  with  either  an 
aggregator, or a service provider, who guarantees access to market or services to the group, on mutually agreed conditions.

A  quadripartite  agreement  will  be  signed  between  the  private  company, 
representatives  of  the  farmers,  the  FI  and  the  Project.  The  agreement  will 
specify  features  of  the  financial  services  to  the  farmers,  targets  and  loan 
disbursement  plan,  conditions  for  delivery  of  the  services  and  respective 
responsibilities  of  the  parties  for  their  delivery.  It  will  in  particular  include 
specific  responsibilities  of  the  company  for  the  loan  repayments  (check  off 
procedures when feasible), and of the farmers (especially in case group joint 
liability  for  loan  repayment  is  implemented).  Project  responsibilities  will  be 
specified  regarding  TA  to  the  FI  and  support  to  be  provided  to  the  private 
company for the development or strengthening of  the farmers network and 
to the farmers in enterprise skills and financial literacy. 
The  Service  Provider  will  issue  competitive  calls  for  proposal  to  shortlisted 
banks or MFIs. SACCOs will not be targeted for this approach since they lack 
financial  and  managerial  capacities  to  manage  this  kind  of  partnership, 
knowing  also  that  their  geographical  coverage  is  restricted  to  one  sector. 
Priority  will  be  given  to  commercial  banks  and  MFIs  that  have  set  up  an 
agricultural  finance  unit,  and  have  expressed  interest  to  develop  their 
portfolio for poultry or pig value chains. Banks and MFIs should in particular 
specify in their proposal conditions to finance investment and working capital 
for  smallholder  farmers,  including  interest  rates  and  other  fees,  and  what 
technical assistance they would require from the Project to design  products 
and deliver the services in partnership with the company. 
Selection  will  be  made  using  the  following  main  eligibility  and  evaluation 
criteria:  (i)  Compliance  with  National  Bank  regulations,  (ii)  Financial 
performance and financial capacity to deliver the services, (iii) Experience in 
agricultural  lending,  (iv)  Operational  presence  in  the  area  of  operations  of 
the  company  and  farmers,  (v)  Relevance  of  the  financial  products  and 
delivery  channels  proposed,  including  required  collaterals,  and  interest  and 
fees  proposed,  and  scope  of  TA  requested.  Negotiations  will  be  conducted 
237

Project Implementation Manual (DRAFT) 
between  the  selected  FI,  the  company,  farmers  representatives  when 
possible and the Project before signing of the agreement.  
Main activities to be conducted are summarized below: 
- Conduct value chain mapping and studies for poultry and pig with focus on 
financing needs and gaps, lending risks and risk mitigation strategies,  
-  Support  private  companies  under  productive  alliance  to  identify,  recruit 
and negotiate with a partner FI,  
- Provide TA to the FI to design adapted products and delivery channels for 
the farmers, 
-  Provide  training  to  the  FI  agents  on  understanding  of  the  poultry  or  pig 
farmer  enterprise  (on  production  and  business  model),  with  recourse  to 
specialized service providers if needed,  
- Support and monitor delivery of the financial services to the farmers. 
2.2  For  other  beneficiaries  of  the  Project  (vulnerable  households 
under gradation pathway and youths)  
a) Training of financial institutions 
For  linkages  with  other  beneficiaries,  the  Service  Provider  will  organize 
training  for  interested  financial  institutions  aiming  at  raising  their  appetite 
for  small  livestock  value  chains  and  supporting  them  to  design  or  refine 
affordable  products  and  delivery  channels  for  different  categories  of 
beneficiaries.  Training  will  be  organized  for  managers  and  loan  agents  of 
banks, MFIs and SACCOs operating in areas of intervention of the Project. It 
will include presentation of value chains mapping and analysis with focus on 
financial  needs,  risks  and  risks  mitigating  strategies,  and  recommended 
for  different  categories  of 
product 
beneficiaries. It will also include a training on farm enterprise on production, 
business  model  and  cash  flow,  to  enable  FI  agents  to  do  proper  appraisal 
and monitoring of the loans.  
features  and  delivery  channels 
Training sessions will be organized at district level to ensure participation of 
the sector based SACCOs. The Project will invite shortlisted FI based on the 
mapping  study  carried  out  during  the  inception  phase  (noting  that  regular 
updates  should  be  made  by  the  Project  to  include  possible  new  entrants  in 
the  agricultural  sector).  Each  session  will  last  3  days,  with  a  maximum 
number of participants of 30 (between 2 and 3 participants per FI, including 
a  manager  and  a  loan  agent).  Each  participating  FI  will  be  requested  to 
specify after the training session its plan to develop small livestock portfolio, 
including for the Project beneficiaries. 
b) Organization of fora to link beneficiaries, value chain actors and financial 
institutions 
238 
Rwanda 
Partnership for Resilient and Inclusive Small Livestock Markets (PRISM) 
Project Implementation Manual (DRAFT) 
The  Service  Provider  will  then  organize  fora  to  facilitate  linkages  between 
farmers,  value  chain  actors  and  FI  that  have  confirmed  interest  to  increase 
their  engagement  in  the  sector,  and  have  designed  adapted  products 
following training by the Project which are ready for promotion. Insurers that 
have  been  supported  by  the  Project  to  design  small  livestock  insurance 
products will also be invited once products are ready for roll out. The Project 
will specifically invite supported beneficiaries under component 1 and private 
actors supported or partnering under component 2. However, the fora will be 
opened  to  the  public  to  allow  for  indirect  impact,  and  the  event  will  be 
promoted  in  collaboration  with  the  relevant  district  authorities.  Value  chain 
actors  like  input  suppliers  and  offtakers  will  also  be  invited.  It  will  be  an 
opportunity  for  them  to  interact  with  farmers  as  potential  clients  or 
suppliers,  and  to  interact  with  financial  institutions  for  possible  access  to 
finance  (assumptions  being  that  FIs  trained  by  the  Project  will  also  be 
incentivized to finance other actors than farmers in the small livestock value 
chains). 2 fora per district will be organized (total of x for x districts).

Provider for: Feasibility studies on small livestock insurance for 
smallholder development in Rwanda 
1. Background to the assignment  
1.1 Project background and context [To update as needed] 
The overall objective of the project is to reduce poverty by empowering poor 
rural  men,  women  and  youth  to  participate  in  the  transformation  of  the 
Rwanda  agriculture  sector  and  to  enhance  their  resilience.  Specifically,  the 
project  seeks  to  increase  competitiveness  and  profitability  of  the  small 
livestock  sector  for  the  provision  of  quality  products  from  smallholder 
producers to domestic and regional consumers. 
The  project  expects  to  reach  at  least  50,000  households  by  2024, 
representing 120,000 household members. The targeting mechanism will be 
based  on  the  national  Ubudehe  system.  The  main  direct  beneficiary  group 
will  be  the  poor  and  food  insecure  rural  households  in  Categories  2  and  3. 
Category  1  -  most  vulnerable  and  landless)  will  be  targeted  through  social 
mobilization  activities  and  for  small  ruminants  and  backyard  chicken 
production.  Category  4  “those  who  own  large-scale  businesses”  could  be 
targeted  as  sources  of  training,  supplier  credit  of  inputs  or  buyer  credit  for 
access to more lucrative market outlets and could as well be involved as will 
be involved as drivers in 4P models. 
In order to improve the competitiveness of the value chain, the project will 
develop  three  groups  of  activities.  The  first  group  of  activities  will  establish 
clusters  and  help  VC  actors  from  the  same  cluster  to  address  the  poor 
organization  of  the  value  chain,  and  the  insufficient  access  to  services  and 
markets,  through  promotion  of  innovative  value  chain  arrangements  and 
improved  access  to  finance.  The  second  group  of  activities  will  aim  at 
building  technical  and  business  capacities  of  value  chain  actors  in  order  to 
improve  the  productivity  of  the  production  systems,  the  management  of 
farms and service provision enterprises, as well as the sanitary conditions of 
slaughtering and processing facilities. The third group of activities will aim at 
improving the institutional framework (policy, regulations) in order to make 
the context more enabling for the proposed changes.  
The  project  will  help  smallholder  farmers,  who  are  the  primary  targets,  to 
benefit  from  the  opportunity  offered  by  the  increasing  demand  for  animal 
241 
Rwanda

Project Implementation Manual (DRAFT) 
products,  in  particular  those  from  small  livestock  (eggs,  white  meat,  small 
ruminant meat), by helping them take an active part in this emerging value 
chain. 
In  order  to  play  a  more  active  role  in  the  value  chain,  smallholder  farmers 
have  to  improve  their  competitiveness  and  their  technical  and  economical 
performance;  this  will  be  achieved  through  various  means  including  in 
particular: 
  strengthening  their  technical  capacities  to  enable  them  to  intensify  the 
production and improve the productivity of their small stock 
  strengthening  their  business  management  capacities  to  enable  them  to 
envisage farming as a business 
The  project  outcome  will  be  achieved  through  the  implementation  of  3 
components: 
  Component 1: Facilitating access to services, finance and market in targeted 
clusters 
  Component 2: Supporting the competitiveness of value chain actors  
  Component 3: strengthening the institutional environment 
Within ‘Component 2: Supporting the competitiveness of value chain actors’ 
access  to  finance  is  being  supported  under  the  project.  The  project  will 
facilitate  linkage  of  the  smallholder  farmers  under  productive  alliance  with 
the  financial  sector,  to  finance  investments  and  working  capital.  It  will  also 
contribute  to  linking  vulnerable  households  under  the  graduation  pathway 
under  component  1  to  access  formal  financial  services  as  one  of  the 
graduation indicators, and to linking youths supported under component 1 to 
financial  institutions  for  the  financing  of  their  start  up  business  and  further 
development of the business.  
Insurance  for  small  livestock  is  one  tool  the  project  will  support  by  way  of 
providing  technical  assistance  to  the  insurance  sector.  The  assumption  is 
that  on  the  supply  side,  appropriate  insurance  products  could  help  reduce 
cost  and  risks  for  the  financial  institutions,  which  will  contribute  to  further 
raise their appetite for the sector, and improve quality of the service for the 
smallholder farmers. On the demand side it will contribute to raise demand 
for and increase access to financial services. The specific focus for insurance 
technical  assistance  is  on  poultry  and  pig  farming  within  the  context  of  the 
target groups of the project.  
1.2 Overview of the assignment 
It  is  within  this  context  that  a  specialized  service  provider  is  sought  to 
implement  all  technical  assistance  activities  relating  to  small  livestock 
insurance for smallholder development in Rwanda. 
242 
Rwanda 
Partnership for Resilient and Inclusive Small Livestock Markets (PRISM) 
Project Implementation Manual (DRAFT) 
Research  will  be  conducted  into  the  value  chain  risks  for  poultry  and  pig 
smallholders,  and  insurance  feasibility  for  the  target  groups.  This  will  help 
underpin technical assistance to two new product designs – carried out on a 
cost-share basis with insurers, and also training of members of the Rwanda 
Insurers’  Association.  It  is  expected  that  at  least  two  insurance  products 
(poultry and pig) will be developed and rolled out. As much as possible, pilot 
testing and roll out of these innovations will involve financial institutions that 
the project has contributed to link with its beneficiaries. 
As a result of these activities, it is expected at least five insurers will receive 
support from the project - one or two will be selected for intensive product 
design support, and more will benefit from sector training. 
2.Objectives of the study 
The  specific  objective  of  the  feasibility  studies  are  to  reach  a  conclusion  as  to  whether 
insurance  is  feasible  for  the  target  group  engaged  in  the  identified  small  livestock  value 
chains  and  to  support  the  broader  rural  and  agricultural  development  strategy  in  the 
project.  
The outcomes of the studies should be: i. Conclusion on whether there is a need for poultry 
and/or pig insurance for the target group(s); ii. If there is a need, conclusion on whether it 
is  feasible;  iii.  Recommendations  for  possible  existing/new  products;  iv.  Recommendations 
for  possible  scheme  design  and  operation;  v.  If  insurance  is  not  currently  feasible,  then 
recommendations  for  what  is  needed  to  advance  the  market  or  what  could  be  possible 
alternative mechanisms. 
Any  feasibility  study  should  consider  what  would  be  required  to  not  only  meet  the  needs 
identified  in  the  project,  but  also  what  would  help  support  any  initiative  that  may  be 
implemented as a result of the study to go beyond project end, and to reach scalability and 
sustainability  of  the  agricultural  market  in  Rwanda.  Therefore,  the  needs  and  interest  of 
insurers and their related partners such as insurance intermediaries; delivery channels and 
aggregators,  such  as  financial  service  providers,  value  chain  actors,  mobile  telephone 
operators;  the  low-income  market,  as  individuals  or  in  groups  such  as  producer 
cooperatives; and of policy makers and donors like IFAD, should all be considered. 
3. Scope of work 
The service provider shall carry out the following key activities: 
Conduct two feasibility studies for small livestock insurance 
Two  feasibility  studies  will  be  carried  out,  one  for  the  poultry  value  chain, 
and one for pig value chain. They should be comprised of desk research, and 
field visits to conduct focus groups and in-depth interviews within the project 
areas  with  target  farmers,  value  chain  operators,  financial  institutions,  and 
partner  organizations;  as  well  as  interviews  with  project  staff.  The  studies 
will  focus  on  supply  and  demand  opportunities  and  constraints  relative  to 
introducing small livestock poultry and pig insurance for the target group(s) 
in the project.  
243 
Rwanda 
Partnership for Resilient and Inclusive Small Livestock Markets (PRISM) 
Project Implementation Manual (DRAFT) 
Whilst  they  will  consider  the  state-of-the-art  in  small  livestock  insurance 
internationally and the overall agricultural insurance context in the Rwanda, 
they  should  have  a  specific  focus  on  the  feasibility  of  small  livestock 
insurance  for  the  target  group(s),  their  partners,  value  chains,  and 
geographical areas within the project and help propose potential product and 
scheme solutions. Particular consideration should be given to poultry and pig 
products  and  schemes  that  can  be  sustainable  and  scalable  within  the 
market and governmental context. 
The studies should analyse: 
  Production characteristics, including: 
o  Risks: main production risks and constraints within the relevant value 
target 
chain(s), 
groups/partners  of  the  project/programme,  including  an  analysis  of 
frequency and causes of losses.  
relevant  geographical  areas,  and  amongst 
o  Production  features:  type  of  production,  average  level  of  production, 
species,  inputs,  typical  sanitary,  farm-  and  animal  management 
practices  
  Demand  and  need  of  different  target  group(s)  and  partners, 
including: 
o  Farmers  and  their  cooperatives/groups,  financial  service  providers, 
value chain actors like input suppliers, buyers etc. 
o  Financial inclusion: shocks preventing access to finance and productive 
investment; default issues which could be mitigated with insurance  
o  Income  characteristics  of  the  target  group(s)/value  chain(s)  and  any 
links to markets etc. 
o  Impact of losses  
  Supply side, including: 
o  Analysis of the existing agricultural insurance provision in Rwanda 
o  Analysis  of  any  relevant  international  small  livestock  insurance 
experience for pig and poultry smallholders 
o  Intermediaries  and  distribution  channels: 
links  different 
intermediaries/distribution  channels  have  with  the  target  group  and 
potential  interest  and  capacity  in  playing  a  role  in  insurance  scheme 
delivery;  possible  opportunities  for  bundling  of  insurance  with  other 
services 
o  Government: 
relevant  enabling/restrictive  policies; 
legal  and 
the 
regulatory frameworks; roles of the government and possible gaps 
244

o  Development 
initiatives:  other 
relevant  existing  or  upcoming 
development initiatives  
  Supplementary 
requirements 
for  successful  product  design, 
including: 
o  Any  disease  or  loss  data  available  or  potentially  available  through 
different actors working in small livestock value chains in the country 
The focus of the feasibility studies should be the constraints and 
opportunities relevant to poultry and pig insurance within smallholder value 
chains. The studies would be expected to highlight and analyse the 
following: country background; value chain risk assessments; agricultural 
and chicken/pig insurance opportunities and challenges in the country; 
institutional, operational and financial considerations for poultry/pig 
insurance; conclusions and recommendations/next steps

It  is  within  this  context  that  a  specialized  service  provider  is  sought  to 
implement technical assistance activities relating to small livestock insurance 
for smallholder development in Rwanda. 
Based  on  existing  assessments  conducted  on  the  value  chain  risks  for 
poultry and pig smallholders, and insurance feasibility for the target groups 
technical  assistance  will  be  provided  to  two  new  product  designs  –  carried 
out on a cost-share basis with insurers, and also training of members of the 
Rwanda  Insurers’  Association.  It  is  expected  that  at  least  two  insurance 
products  (poultry  and  pig)  will  be  developed  and  rolled  out.  As  much  as 
possible,  pilot  testing  and  roll  out  of  these  innovations  will  involve  financial 
institutions that the project has linked with its beneficiaries. 
As a result of these activities, it is expected at least five insurers will receive 
support from the project - one or two will be selected for intensive product 
design support, and more will benefit from sector training. 
2. Scope of work 
The service provider shall carry out the following key activities: 
2.1 Seek partner insurers  
For one or two insurers, the service provider will supply technical assistance 
to  product  development  and  adjustment,  and  connection  of  the  insurer(s) 
with the relevant project target group(s) at the fora organized by the project 
to link beneficiaries, value chain actors and financial institutions. 
The  service  provider  will  support  the  Access  to  Finance  Specialist  (AFS)  of 
the  project  to  identify  potential  partner  insurers  and  invite  them  to 
participate  to  receive  technical  assistance  on  a  cost-share  basis  (at  least 
30% commitment of private sector insurer(s). 
Given  technical  assistance  is  aimed  at  developing  one  product  for  poultry 
and  one  product  for  pig,  the  partnership  may  take  place  with  two  insurers, 
or one insurer for both products. 
Specifically,  and  in  close  cooperation  with  the  AFS,  the  service  provider 
shall: 
  Map potential insurers 
  Help design selection procedures

Annex 10: Draft Letter of Intent with ENABEL 
LETTER OF INTENT 
between 
INTERNATIONAL FUND FOR AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT 
and 
ENABEL – BELGIAN DEVELOPMENT AGENCY 
Whereas  the  International  Fund  for  Agricultural  Development  (IFAD)  is  a  specialized  agency  of  the 
United Nations and an International Financial Institution (IFI) established to mobilize additional resources 
to be made available on concessional terms for agricultural development in developing Member States.  
Whereas  ENABEL  is  the  Belgian  development  agency  mandated  to  implement  and  coordinate  the 
Belgian international development policy.  
Whereas, both IFAD and ENABEL, (each a “Party” and both of them collectively the “Parties”) seek to 
promote  the  productivity  of  smallholder  farmers,  increasing  their  benefits  from  market  participation, 
strengthening the environmental sustainability and climate resilience of their economic activities.  
Whereas, the Parties are trusted partner for the Government of Rwanda and through their respective 
funded projects and programmes, have been contributing to the transformation of agriculture from a 
subsistence sector to a knowledge-based value creating sector that contributes to the national economy 
and ensures food and nutrition security, aligning their interventions with the Strategic Plan for the 
Transformation of Agriculture phase 4 (PSTA-4), 2018-2024.  
Whereas, the Parties recognize the important role that an healthy growth of the small livestock sector can 
play to reduce poverty, enhance food and nutrition security of poor rural men, women and youth. 
Now, therefore, the Parties, within the limitation of their respective mandates, intend the following: 
1.  Jointly support the Partnership for Resilient and Inclusive Small Livestock Markets 
(PRISM), a programme implemented under MINAGRI’s main implementing agency for agriculture 
and livestock programmes: the Rwanda Agriculture and Animal Resources Development Board 
(RAB). 
2.  Align the proposed interventions in support of the livestock sector, in accordance with their respective 
mandates of the agencies, their comparative advantages and their financial resources. In this regard, 
respective interventions will follow the below general principles: 
-  At production level, IFAD-supported interventions will target preferentially smallholder 
livestock  holdings  and  vulnerable  households,  and  ENABEL  will  engage  and  support 
also commercial and industrial actors; 
- 
- 
In  terms  of  geographical  repartition,  IFAD-supported  interventions  will  focus  on 
Northern,  Southern  and  Western  Provinces  of  Rwanda,  in  Districts  that  are  the  most 
affected by poverty and malnutrition ; 
In  terms  of  value  chains,  IFAD-supported  interventions  will  target  mainly  the  small 
ruminants,  pig  and  backyard  chicken  value  chains,  that  correspond  to  its  priority  target

Project Implementation Manual (DRAFT) 
CHAPTER I: GENERAL PROVISIONS  
Article 1: Principles of collaboration 
The objective of this Agreement is to provide MINAGRI and Heifer International Rwanda with a 
framework to jointly facilitate joint implementation of PRISM. 
Collaboration is based on: 
-  Equality  and  understanding  between  the  Parties  involved  in  the  implementation  of  the 
RDDP; 
-  Safeguarding mutual interests of various Parties; and 
-  Respect of reciprocal commitments.  
Article 2: Purpose of the Agreement 
The purpose of the Agreement is to: 
1.1.  Define methods and conditions of the fulfilment of mutual responsibilities for the PRISM 
within the Project Area; 
1.2.  Define, clarify and specify reciprocal commitments of the two contracting Parties; and 
1.3.  Explain  the  flow  of  the  Funds  between  the  Parties  as  defined  in  the  “Flow  of  Funds 
Diagram” attached hereto as Appendix 1 and incorporated herein by this reference. 
Article 3: Objectives of this Agreement 
Heifer’s  share  of  the  PRISM  impelemntation  is  strengthening  the  capacity  and  asset  base  of 
participating farmers to enable them achieve a living income. Living income is defined as all the 
incomes  of  a  household  earned/generated  or  transferred  whether  cash  or  in‐kind,  sufficient  to 
enable  all  members  of  the  household  to  afford  a  decent  standard  of  living.  In  Rwanda  the 
benchmark  for  living  income  is  $6.08/day  while  the  current  average  income  in  the  targeted 
implementation zones is closer to $3.11/day. Heifer has co-designed this intervention with IFAD 
and  the  Rwandan  Ministry  of  Agriculture  in  order  to  help  farmers  diversify  their  incomes 
through  smallstock  value  chains  including  poultry,  swine,  goat  and  sheep.  The  main  direct 
beneficiary  group  of  the  project  will  be  within  the  Northern,  Southern  and  Western  provinces 
and  composed  of  22,000  households  who  will  receive  training  and  livestock.  The  project  will 
give  priority  to  three  categories  of  people:  women  heads  of  households,  households  with 
malnourished children, and young adolescent girls.  
258 
Rwanda 
Partnership for Resilient and Inclusive Small Livestock Markets (PRISM) 
Project Implementation Manual (DRAFT) 
Heifer’s focus on this project will be on strengthening capacity of smallholders to increase their 
production and productivity while connecting them to markets by prioritizing three different, but 
inter-related elements of the livestock production system. These are: the farmer, the animal and 
the  resources  for  animal  feeding  and  wellbeing.  Heifer  will  employ  its  Values  Based  Holistic 
Community  Development  (VBHCD)  model,  which  mobilizes  and  organizes  communities  and 
builds their capacity to stir-up their potentials for development. This helps them to harness their 
indigenous  and  accumulated  knowledge  with  limited  development  resources  to  improve  their 
livelihoods, reduce economic and climatic vulnerability and increase resilience. Heifer will  
capitalize on its existing experience and expertise in Rwanda, the Africa region and globally to 
ensure this project is implemented with utmost quality.  
This Agreement is based on the premise of the objective of improving food and nutrition security 
and  incomes  of  poor  rural  households  and  through  better  performance  of  the  targeted  small 
livestock value chains.  
The following activities are designed to be implemented by Heifer in order to achieve the 
set objectives of the project.  
Self Help Group Formation (Year 1) - SHG is the foundation for VBHCD. Heifer first helps 
community members to organize themselves into SHGs with one representative from each 
household. Each SHG is generally constituted of 20-30 members. Once the SHCs organized, 
Heifer continues to provide capacity building training and mentoring support to the SHGs. SHGs 
offer project participants opportunity to create bonds among members and enable them to think 
and work together for a common cause. SHGs are platforms that facilitate the full participation 
of individual members in project activities, such as group savings and loan, training, leadership 
skills development, etc. After receiving training, the SHGs establish Group Savings and Credit 
Funds and are put on a pathway towards graduation to form a larger platform of a Cooperative, 
through which they can achieve economies of scale by aggregating their agricultural goods.  
Training of Farmers in Cornerstones© (Year 1) 
In implementing this project, Heifer will use its VBHCD model to organize and mobilize 
poultry, swine, goat and sheep groups. The 12 Cornerstones©171 for Just and Sustainable 
Development are used to focus the group on the shared values of the self and community. Shared 
values discussed are used for group visioning and planning. This helps the group to plan for three 
types of key activities: activities done by SHG members (without assistance); activities done 
with Heifer support (e.g., Heifer project activities); activities done with outside support (e.g., 
local government).  
171 The 12 Cornerstones© cover a range of shared values and principles, abbreviated in Passing on the gifts. 
Accountability; Sharing and Caring; Sustainability and Self Reliance; Improved Animal and Resource Management; 
Nutrition, Health, and Income; Gender and Family Focus; Genuine need and Justice; Improving the Environment; 
Full Participation; Training, Education and Communication; and Spirituality.

Rwanda 
Partnership for Resilient and Inclusive Small Livestock Markets (PRISM) 
Project Implementation Manual (DRAFT) 
Training of Farmers in Agri-Business and Income Generation (Years 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) 
Farmers will also undergo important trainings to develop both hard and soft skills such as basic 
nutrition, gender and leadership modules for men and women, Values Based Financial Literacy, 
and environmental management in order to build and strengthen holistic skills and capacities for 
long-term success in agri-business. Further, the SHGs will be introduced to income generating 
opportunities that exist in their communities and undergo skills assessment to determine their 
strengths, weaknesses, and areas of interest. Based on this assessment, farmers will be trained on 
skills related to potential opportunities, including small business entrepreneurship, on-and off-
farm income generation, and other employment opportunities that exist along the value chains, 
including: production, aggregation, transportation, processing, distribution/retail, and marketing. 
As the project progresses, agri-business workshops and input fairs linking farmers to private 
sector partners will be facilitated to further sharpen the business acumen and prospects of 
farmers while forging stronger outlets to formal markets.  
Technical Trainings on Poultry, Swine, Goat and Sheep (Year 1) 
Prior to livestock placement, specific technical assistance focusing on poultry, sheep, swine and 
goat value chains will be provided to farmers to help increase their production and productivity. 
These trainings include capacity building in: breeding; husbandry; feeding, including zero-
grazing, health and reproduction. Farmers also receive training in establishing a rotation scheme 
at the SHG level. Each SHG is supplied with at least one male animal used for breeding 
purposes. A carefully designed technique is employed to avoid cases of inbreeding and to 
increase the genetic diversity among the animals. Proper record keeping and follow up 
mechanisms are in place to ensure that animals that are closely related do not mate. The ratio of 
male to female per animal is described below: 
  Swine, the boar to sow breeding ratio is 1:20 
  Goats, the buck to doe ratio is 1:30 
  Chicken, the rooster to hen ratio is 1:10 
Provision of Training and Equipment to Community Agrovet Entrepreneurs (CAVEs) 
(Years 1,2)  
CAVEs will be identified, trained and deployed to support animal wellbeing across all value 
chains. With knowledge in basic preventive and animal health care, CAVEs provide services to 
the community under the supervision of qualified government veterinary staff. CAVEs have a 
high school education and become registered service providers with the government. This model 
bridges the gap of government extension services, increases the animal wellbeing and 
productivity and generates income opportunities, particularly for women and youth. Each CAVE 
is trained in animal well-being and conducting basic animal care ranging from administering 
vaccines to simple surgeries. CAVEs are equipped with animal well-being starter kits for their 
businesses including: a thermometer; antibiotics, de-wormers, anticoccidials, multi-vitamins; 
ear-tag applicator; vaccination kit; vaccines; AI kits; surgical kits; cool box and icepacks; hoof 
trimmer; a motorcycle and other key supplies.  
Input Provision and Passing on the Gift (Years 2, 3, 4, 5) 
Once farmers have completed their training series, female animals of improved breeds will be 
placed at the household level. The selection criteria for households to receive livestock is 
described below: 
260 
Rwanda 
Partnership for Resilient and Inclusive Small Livestock Markets (PRISM) 
Project Implementation Manual (DRAFT) 
  Resides in the Project Implementation Zone 
  Be in the category of resource-poor  
  Completed and participated in Year 1 trainings 
  Constructed a modern animal shed 
  Willing and committed to pass on the first-born female animal together with construction material to 
new a beneficiary 
  Socially well integrated in community and active participation in development activities  
The smallstock are placed with households in the following packages with each family receiving 
and specializing in one type of animal:  
Animal 
# placed per household 
Poultry 
10 
Swine 
3 
Sheep 
3 
Goat 
3 
In addition to placement of animals, farmers will be provided initial starter packs with inputs, 
including: feeds of grasses and legumes; disinfectants; feed troughs; drinkers; and nests. At the 
household level, smallholders will be trained in building proper housing structures for their 
animals. After training, farmers will receive most of the materials necessary for the construction 
and will co-invest about 20% of the building materials. No animal will be placed before a farmer 
has received training and constructed an appropriate housing structure that will protect the 
investment of the animal from elements and pests. 
Heifer’s model of Passing on the Gift© (POG) represents an innovative approach that fosters 
sustainability and produces a multiplier effect for impact. POG© is a requirement for each Heifer 
program participant and involves the initial direct beneficiaries (who received the livestock) 
passing on the first female offspring, to another person. The group determines who receive the 
“pass on” animals, training and guidance. This recipient will be expected to do the same for 
another person. On average, Heifer gifts are passed on for four generations in Rwanda.  
The table below describes the overall schedule of initial smallstock procurement, placement and 
pass on scheme.

Establishing a Community Health Fund (Years 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) 
Every animal beneficiary is sensitized to contribute towards the animal health insurance scheme. 
In this scheme, a famer contributes between Rwf 500 and 2000 (depending on the general 
assembly's decision) and pays half the price of vet drugs prescribed by qualified veterinary 
technician. With the establishment of this scheme, animals belonging to qualified farmers are 
treated at a subsidized cost, thereby reducing mortality. 
Provision and Training for Animal Feed (Years 1, 2, 3, 4) 
Ahead of livestock placement, farmers receive inputs for fodder plots, such as grasses and 
legumes. Farmers will also be trained on ways to address seasonality such as post-harvest 
storage, which will make higher quality feed available during the dry season. Various strategies 
suitable for smallholders such as planted forages, silage, and improved conservation of crop 
residues will be included.  
Fostering Robust South by South learning (Years 2, 3, 4) 
Throughout the life of the project, South-South learning will be facilitated by conducting 
exchange visits both at the local farmer level, but also among global project staff across Heifer’s 
portfolio. Current plans are in place to first exchange between Rwanda, Kenya, Nepal, and 
Cambodia so Rwanda may benefit from successful breeding and feeding models that Heifer is 
implementing in the region and in Asia. Each exchange visit will articulate a clear learning 
agenda to enhance smallstock productivity and will capture and disseminate lessons learned.  
Participatory Self-Review and Planning (PSRP) (Years 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) 
PSRP is a values-based participatory review and planning methodology designed for assessing 
project implementation progress, community participation level, and learning and planning for 
action. Throughout the life of the project, farmers will participate in PSRP, which takes place at 
the different levels and involves all project stakeholders. During this process, farmers asses their 
goals, development actions plans and self-monitor their progress.

Annex  13:  Draft  Terms  of  Reference  of  awareness  raising  on 
targeting,  gender  and  nutrition  during  the  project’s  start-up 
workshop 
Start-up  workshops  represent  the  official  launch  of  the  project  with  key  partners  and 
stakeholders,  including  SPIU  staff,  implementing  partner  organizations,  representatives  of 
government,  service  providers,  NGOs  and  the  private  sector.  Eventually,  IFAD  staff  from 
Regional  Hubs,  headquarters  and  technical  experts  who  have  worked  in  the  project  design  or 
have specific relevant expertise on singular project areas may be also present. Project’s start-up 
workshops  can  provide  a  good  platform  to  raise  awareness  on  targeting,  gender  and  nutrition 
with  project  staff  and  implementing  partner  organizations  and  present  implementation 
procedures  and  arrangements  to  ensure  that  nutrition  will  be  mainstreamed  throughout  the 
project cycle. 
To  organize  a  dedicated  session  on  targeting,  gender  and  nutrition-related  issues  as  part  of  the 
project’s start-up workshop:  
a.  Identify the main objective(s) of the session to be included in the workshop agenda; 
b.  Understand the profile of the audience, in order to shape the presentations accordingly; 
c.  If  possible,  co-share  this  session  with  other  key  institutional  partners  (e.g.  Ministry  of 
Gender  and  Family  promotion,  National  Early  Childhood  Development  Programme, 
Heifer  International,  etc.) that will have  a key  role in supporting the implementation of 
nutrition-sensitive intervention; 
d.  Consider dividing the session in two parts: (1) the first part would provide an overview of 
the  targeting,  gender  and  nutrition-sensitive  agriculture  respectively,  covering  basic 
gender  and  nutrition  concepts,  the  linkages  with  other  cross-cutting  issues  (linkages 
between  gender  and  nutrition,  with  climate);  (2)  the  second  part  could  explore  the 
specific  approach  adopted  by  the  project  to  address  gender  and  nutrition-related  issues, 
presenting the main interventions and institutional arrangements for their implementation. 
Suggestions for presentations on nutrition-sensitive projects are provided in the boxes;  
e.  Allocate  time  for  key  institutional  partners  to  present  their  experience  in  addressing 
gender  and  nutrition  problems  in  the  area/with  the  population  groups  targeted  by  the 
project; 
f.  Dedicate  enough  time  for  Q&A  and  to  identify  knowledge  gaps  and  technical  capacity 
needs  from  the  project  staff  and  key  implementing  partners  on  gender  and  nutrition 
related issues, respectively; 
g.  Finally,  agree  on  the  next  steps  and  on  a  roadmap  for  essential  follow-up  actions  and 
responsibilities.  
The same process may be repeated if orientation workshops are held at regional or district levels 
as part of the project start-up process. A lighter format may be used at the community level. 
Suggestions for presentations on nutrition-sensitive projects at start-up workshops 
  Provide  an  overview  of  the  different  types  of  malnutrition  and  describe  the 
278 
Rwanda 
Partnership for Resilient and Inclusive Small Livestock Markets (PRISM) 
Project Implementation Manual (DRAFT) 
nutrition  situation  in  the  project  area  (prevalence  rates,  causes  and  target 
groups affected) relevant to the thematic focus of the project; 
  Explain  why  addressing  nutrition  is  relevant  in  agriculture  development 
projects and how agriculture can contribute to improved nutrition; 
  Explain  how  the  project  will  address  nutrition-related  problems  and  how 
nutrition-sensitive activities are framed within the project’s components; 
  Explain  implementation  procedures  and  arrangements,  human  and  financial 
resources  available  and  the  need  to  track  progresses  against  nutrition  outputs 
and outcomes in the M&E system; 
  Present  lessons  learned  and  good  practices  form  the  on-going  projects  that 
might be applied in PRIMS. 
  Identify  next  steps  for  ensuring  that  nutrition  is  fully  mainstreamed  in  the 
project  and  renew  the  invitation  to  strengthen  multisectoral  collaboration  to 
ensure that nutrition-sensitive interventions are adequately implemented. 
Suggestions for presentations on gender at start-up workshop 
  Describe  the  target  group  (who  they  are,  where  they  are  located  and  their 
livelihoods)  and  note  specific  opportunities  and  challenges  they  face  that  are 
relevant to the project; 
  Describe  key  gender,  youth  and  social  inclusion  issues  that  are  relevant  to 
project's components; 
  Outline  the  main  elements  of  targeting  and  gender  strategies  and  approaches 
that  will  be  used  by  the  project  to  ensure  project  engagement  with  the  target 
group, and activities to promote women's empowerment and gender equality; 
  Explain  implementation  procedures,  human  and  financial  resources,  and  the 
need  to  track  target  groups  and  report  sex-disaggregated  data  in  the  M&E 
system; 
  Present  lessons  learned  and  good  practices  form  the  on-going  projects  that 
might be applied in PRIMS.

Annex 15 : Exit Strategy 
52. 
The  Project’s  Exit  Strategy  needs  to  be  refined  in  the  course  of  the  Project,  taking 
benefit  of  lessons  learned  on  what  works  and  what  doesn’t;  while  gradually  shifting  focus 
from  sustaining  Project’s  benefits  to  scaling-up  and  scaling-out  those  benefits.  A  draft  exit 
strategy is detailed in Annex 10 of this document.  
53. The sustainability of the project outcomes relies on its overall approach which is based in 
particular  on  the  facilitation  of  partnerships,  social  mobilization  and  group  formation, 
transfer of competences, institutional strengthening and durable financing: 
54. Partnerships:  facilitation  of  partnerships  between  smallholder  producers  and  private 
value  chain  actors  is  at  the  core  of  the  project.  Through  the  establishment  of  these 
partnerships,  smallholder  farmers  will  gain  access  to  services,  markets,  inputs  and 
technical know how in a sustainable way. The project will ensure that these partnerships 
are  mutually  beneficial,  and  generate  economic  benefits  for  both  parties,  which  will 
encourage partners to maintain them active, and to support part of their costs.  
55. Improved infrastructure environment: the construction/upgrading of marketing and 
processing facilities at both public and private level will ensure that the increased small 
livestock production find its way to the market through outlets that are locally available 
(increased proximity) and comply with food safety and animal welfare standards that are 
expected to be raised by the GoR in the forthcoming years.  
56. Social mobilization and group formation: shared initiatives have a greater likelihood 
of  being  continued,  as  partners  keep  each  other  committed.  For  a  vast  majority  of  the 
beneficiaries,  especially  the  most  vulnerable  ones,  the  creation  of  self-help  groups, 
youth groups, producers groups and  cooperatives, will enable smallholders to access to 
market,  services  and  finance  in  a  sustainable  way,  which  could  not  be  the  case  for 
individuals.  The  project  will  channel  most  of  its  support  and  implement  majority  of  its 
activities  through  the  groups,  which  will  contribute  to  strengthen  the  group  capacities 
and cohesion and will ensure that groups remain active and keep delivering services to 
their members after the project closure. 
57. Graduation  pathway  for  the  poorest:  the  graduation  approach  deployed  with  the 
poorest  and  food  insecure  households  will  enable  them  to  move  out  of  poverty  by 
providing  a  comprehensive  package,  including  a  combination  of  livelihoods  promotion, 
asset  transfers,  financial  literacy  and  technical  training.  Combining  support  for 
immediate needs with a long-term plan would ultimately contribute to increase food and 
nutrition security and social empowerment of the poorest households. 
58. Transfer  of  competences:  the  project  will  strengthen  both  public  institutions  and 
private  actors  in  order  to  enable  them  to  play  their  role  after  the  project  closure.  The 
private  Business  Development  Service  Providers  will  be  a  central  element  of  this 
strategy: these actors  will be supported and  capacitated by the project to  enable them 
to  add  a  real  economic  value  to  the  businesses  they  support.  This  will  enable  them  to 
remain  in  place  after  the  project  and  continue  to  deliver  their  services  to  the 
commercially-oriented  producers  on  a  private  basis.  The  Community  Facilitators  and 
Community  Agro-Vet  Entrepreneurs  trained  and  established  under  the  graduation 
pathway  will  remain  in  place  after  project  end  and  operate  as  a  recognized  extension 
arm  of  the  Rwandan  veterinary  services,  with  a  particular  ability  to  reach  the  most 
remote  smallholder  farmers.  The  project  will  also  strengthen  the  national  and  the 
devolved  public  institutions  to  enable  them  to  extend  the  support  to  communities  and 
value chains after the project.   
283

Project Implementation Manual (DRAFT) 
59. Institutional  strengthening:  public  institutions  will  be  supported  to  deliver  their 
mandate in a more efficient and focused manner, in line with their mandate. The policy 
support provided to the Ministry of Agriculture will enable it to plan for the development 
of  the  sector  in  the  long  term.  The  support  provided  to  stakeholders  umbrella 
organizations  will  prioritize  the  development  of  mechanisms  and  activities  that  could 
contribute to income generation and thus sustainability. 
60. Sustainable  financing:  the  financing  mechanisms  put  in  place  in  the  scope  of  the 
project  will  privilege  sustainability  and  will  be  based  in  priority  on  existing  and 
permanent  financing  mechanisms,  either  private  or  governmental.  The  project  will  as 
much as possible avoid direct financing of investments and will privilege activities aiming 
at  reconciling  the  demand  in  financial  products  and  the  supply.  To  achieve  this,  the 
financial  institutions  will  be  supported  to  develop  adapted  financial  services  for  small 
livestock  value  chains  farmers  and  other  private  actors,  that  they  are  expected  to

61. Environmental  sustainability:  the  project  will  promote  production  and  processing 
systems  that  are  environmentally  sustainable: the  utilization  of locally  produced  fodder
